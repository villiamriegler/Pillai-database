2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Dapagliflozin is a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, previously approved for the 
treatment of patients with T1DM or T2DM. In the current variation, the MAH is applying for a new 
indication (X is indicated in adults for the treatment of symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction) based on the results of one pivotal phase III study; D1699C00001, hereafter referred to as 
DAPA-HF. 
Inhibition of SGLT2 by dapagliflozin reduces reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate in the 
proximal renal tubule along with a concomitant reduction in sodium reabsorption leading to urinary 
excretion of glucose and osmotic diuresis (Kasichayanula et al 2014). Based on this mechanism, a 
beneficial effect in patients with heart failure (HF) could be expected. However, the glycosuric effect 
decreases with decreasing renal function and additional effects have been proposed to be relevant for 
patients with heart failure.  
In addition to the osmotic diuretic and related hemodynamic actions of SGLT2 inhibition, potential 
secondary effects on myocardial metabolism, ion channels, fibrosis, adipokines and uric acid have been 
discussed to be relevant for cardio-renal effects of dapagliflozin (e.g. Esterline RL, et al., European journal 
of endocrinology. 2018;178(4): R113-r25., Ferrannini et al., Diabetes Care. 2016;39(7):1108-14; 2016, 
Hallow et al 2018, Am J Physiol Renal Physiol. 2018;315(5): F1295-F306.  Lytvyn et al 2017; Circulation. 
2017;136(17):1643-58.). Lytvyn et al. provided an overview over the multiplicity of proposed 
mechanisms of cardiorenal protection with SGLT2 inhibition (Figure 3). At present, it is obvious that 
actions beyond a blood glucose lowering effect are of key relevance for CV protection but the individual 
contribution of the different effects to cardiovascular protection is unclear.

EMA/574301/2020

The prevalence of HF is estimated at 1% to 2% in the Western world (GBD 2016 Disease and Injury 
Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators 2017) and in a report from US community-based samples, 5-year 
mortality in HFrEF patients was 66%(Tsao et al 2018). The core symptoms of HF include shortness of 
breath, fatigue, and peripheral oedema and hospitalisations due to decompensations are frequently 
occurring. Current standard of care includes renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade, Beta blockade,

and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) (if deemed appropriate). In addition to these 
therapies, diuretics are used to reduce symptoms from fluid overload. More recently, neprilysin inhibition 
(in conjunction with RAS blockade) was added as a new treatment option. 
CHMP scientific advice 
The MAH applied for a scientific advice from the CHMP in May 2016. The main topics covered in the advice 
letter were; appropriateness of the proposed study design for a heart failure indication, choice of primary 
endpoints, treatment regimens, background medication, statistical testing strategy and safety data 
collection. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
This application is an extension of indication variation for Edistride/Forxiga and the active 
substance is dapagliflozin. The current therapeutic indications are insufficiently controlled type 1 
and type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct for maintaining a sufficient glycaemic control according 
to the summary of product characteristics. The applied new indication is chronic heart failure with 
reduced ejection fraction. 
The applicant has submitted three non-clinical studies. 
 Introduction 
Dapagliflozin is a selective sodium- glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor and prevents the 
renal reabsorption of glucose and is thus reducing the blood glucose levels in hyperglycaemic 
patients. The applicant has submitted three non-clinical reports investigating whether treatment 
of dapagliflozin may attenuate the deterioration of heart function in two different mouse models 
of diabetes, i.e. BTBR.Cg-LepOB/WiscJ and C57Bl/6 J-lepOB mice. In vitro studies using cardiac 
fibroblasts was performed to elucidate whether attenuation of inflammasome activation may play 
a role in the mechanism of action by dapagliflozin. 
In addition, since the initial marketing authorization approval, a toxicology study has been 
performed to date. Applicant has provided an Addendum to Non-clinical Written Summary, a 
toxicology report where a 6-month cancer study with regard to urinary bladder cancer is 
presented.  
 Pharmacology 
AZ13219875, dapagliflozin, is a selective SGLT2 inhibitor. Applicant has submitted three non-
clinical studies proving target engagement and proof of mechanism for SGLT2 inhibition.

 Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Three new non-clinical studies with the compound AZ13219875 (dapagliflozin), a selective SGLT2 
inhibitor, have been provided by applicant and are summarized below. 
2.2.3.1.  Study number: Nonclinical HF 001 
In one study, (study number: Nonclinical HF 001) insulin resistant homozygous male C57BL/6J-lepob 
mice (ob/ob−/− mice) was treated with two dose levels, 1.5 and 4.0 mg/kg/day , delivered in 
drinking water for 10 weeks. A vehicle control group was also included  (n= 18 per group). 
Effect of dapagliflozin on urinary glucose excretion 
Treatment with AZ13219875, dapagliflozin, resulted in a dose-dependent increase in urinary 
glucose excretion at weeks 5 and 10 (Table 1).  This result indicates that both dapagliflozin dose

Dapagliflozin improved coronary function (CFVR) of the left ventricle 
The coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR), as a measure of microvascular function, was 
investigated. Dapagliflozin improved the CFVR in the 4.0mg/kg/day treated group, at 5 and 10 
weeks after intervention, compared with vehicle group. Figure 1 shows a trend toward dose-
dependent changes in CFVR at 5 and 10 weeks compared to the vehicle treated group.

Effect of dapagliflozin on coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) 
Figure 1. Coronary flow was studied over time in ob/ob−/− mice, treated with either 
dapagliflozin or vehicle, using noninvasive transthoracic ultrasound (N = 18 mice for each 
treatment group).  Statistical significance for the difference of the mean between groups was 
assessed using ANOVA, and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.  Each bar 
represents Mean ± SEM. 
Dapagliflozin improved left ventricular contractility (FAC) 
Left ventricle fractional area change (FAC) is the percent change in left ventricular cross-sectional 
area between diastole and systole. At 10 weeks both treatment groups showed significantly higher 
cardiac contractile function compared with the vehicle group (figure 2).

2.2.3.2.  Study number: Nonclinical HF 002 
In the second study,BTBR ob/ob−/− mouse model was administrated with 1 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks 
to determine (1) whether treatment with dapagliflozin may attenuate the deterioration of heart 
function; (2) whether dapagliflozin treatment affects the cardiac remodelling; and (3) whether 
inflammasome activation may play a role in the mechanism of action for the observed 
cardioprotective effect of dapagliflozin.

End systolic volume (ESV) is the lowest volume of blood in the ventricle at any point in the cardiac 
cycle.  Left ventricular ESV is a marker of ventricular contractility that is relatively insensitive to 
loading conditions.  It is also an indicator of remodeling after myocardial necrosis, such as resulting 
from infarction.  High left ventricular ESV is associated with the mortality and incident heart 
failure. 
End-diastolic volume (EDV) is the volume of blood in the left or right ventricle at end load or filling 
in (diastole) or the amount of blood in the ventricles just before systole.  Larger ventricular 
distension results in the increase of the length of the sarcomeres in the cardiac muscle prior to 
contraction (systole).  The more the heart muscle fibers are stretched (enlarged EDV), the harder 
the heart will squeeze.  Squeezing harder may cause the heart muscle to thicken over time, 
resulting in cardiac remodelling.

pathways involved. This is an in vitro study of NLRP3 inflammasome expression in cardiofibroblasts 
isolated from BTBR ob/ob-/- and WT mice.

 Toxicology 
Since the initial marketing authorization approval, a toxicology study has been performed to date. 
Applicant has provided an Addendum to Non-clinical Written Summary, a toxicology report where a 6-
month cancer study with regard to urinary bladder cancer is presented. The objective was to determine 
potential effects of dapagliflozin incidence and degree of invasiveness of urinary bladder carcinomas 
induced with N-Butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) in a rat model for initiation/promotion of 
tumours in the urinary bladder.  
Briefly, animals were treated with BBN (100 or 400 mg/kg/dose) for 6 weeks and following a washout 
period of 2 weeks, divided in groups receiving either vehicle, dapagliflozin (0.5 mg/kg/day) or uracil (3% 
via diet as positive control) for additional 26 weeks before necropsy. While a slight increase in urothelial 
hyperplasia was noted in animals pre-treated with BBN (100 mg/kg/dose) followed by dapagliflozin when 
compared to corresponding controls, no effects on incidence or invasiveness of transitional cell carcinoma 
could be associated to dapagliflozin treatment in animals pre-treated with BBN. 
 Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

 Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In Vivo studies 
Applicant has shown convincing results with regard to mechanism of action (MoA) in inhibition of SGLT2 
by an increased urinary glucose excretion followed by an improvement in the glycaemic control with 
reduced HbA1c, fasting blood glucose and insulin levels as well as improved glucose tolerance with 
restored β-secretory function. In addition, an improved cardiac function was observed in a number of 
tests. The degree of cardiac fibrosis was reduced with dapagliflozin treatment as well as the number of 
apoptotic cells. However, whether these improved effects on cardiac function are dependent on 
stabilisation of the glycaemic control or if dapagliflozin has an independent beneficial effect, can not be 
evaluated from these in vivo studies.  
In Vitro studies 
Mechanistic explanation, at least in part, is due to the attenuation of the NLRP3-mediated inflammasome 
activity. In addition, the in vitro studies suggest that AMPK phosphorylation and activation play a key role 
in the dapagliflozin induced attenuation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. However, the 
pharmacological effects seen by dapagliflozin in the in vitro studies were reached at rather high 
concentrations. The clinical importance of this mechanism is yet unknown and other mechanisms of 
action can therefore not be excluded. However, this would not prevent MA in the presence of convincing 
clinical data. 
In conclusion, the non-clinical studies provided by Applicant have shown that dapagliflozin treatment in 
obese diabetic mouse models improves the structural defects in the cardiac fibroblasts associated with 
these mouse models. In addition, an increase in the function of left cardiac ventricle was shown.  
Overall, the non-clinical pharmacology studies appear to support the rationale to use dapagliflozin in the 
intended disease indication and no further non-clinical testing is considered necessary. 
 Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects (ERA) 
The PEC/PNEC ratio for microorganisms was <0.1. The PEC/PNEC ratios for groundwater and surface 
water were <1. These risk quotients indicate that dapagliflozin is unlikely to present a risk to 
microorganisms or the aquatic and groundwater environments. 
The effect of dapagliflozin on the sediment dwelling organism Chironomus riparius is investigated in Tier 
B. The PEC/PNEC ratio for sediment was <1, indicating that dapagliflozin is unlikely to present a risk to 
sediment dwelling organisms. 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the new/extended indication does not lead to a 
significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of dapagliflozin.  
Considering the above data, dapagliflozin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

 Pharmacokinetics

 Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Dapagliflozin is a reversible inhibitor of SGLT2. Inhibition of SGLT2 by dapagliflozin reduces reabsorption 
of glucose from the glomerular filtrate in the proximal renal tubule along with a concomitant reduction in 
sodium reabsorption leading to urinary excretion of glucose and osmotic diuresis. Dapagliflozin therefore 
increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule which is believed to increase tubuloglomerular 
feedback and reduce intraglomerular pressure (Thomson et al 2012). Secondary effects observed 
following SGLT2 inhibition with dapagliflozin include a reduction in blood pressure (Sjostrom et al 2015), 
reduction in body weight (Bolinder et al 2014), and an increase in haematocrit (Lambers Heerspink et al 
2013, List et al 2009). In addition to the osmotic diuretic and related haemodynamic actions of SGLT2 
inhibition, potential secondary effects on myocardial metabolism, ion channels, fibrosis, adipokines and 
uric acid have been discussed (Esterline et al 2018, Ferrannini et al 2016, Hallow et al 2018, Lytvyn et al 
2017). 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
No specific discussion is submitted, but this is acceptable. By its mechanism of action, dapagliflozin 
lowers blood glucose and is approved for treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus. The osmotic 
diuresis is known to increase the risk of hypotension. There is also an increased risk of genital infections 
and diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with diabetes. See further the safety section of this report.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
 Dose response study(ies) 
Justification of the doses selected in the pivotal trial 
No results of dose response studies for the administration in patients with heart failure were submitted. 
The marketed 10 mg dose of dapagliflozin has demonstrated a favourable benefit/risk balance for the 
treatment of T2DM in the clinical development programme. 10 mg once daily is the recommended dose in 
patients with T2DM. A dose of 10 mg once daily was also investigated in the  cardiovascular outcome 
study (DECLARE) showing non-inferiority vs. placebo for the composite of cardiovascular death, 
myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke. In this study all patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
additional cardiovascular risk factors. At baseline, 10.0% of patients in the study had a history of heart 
failure. dapagliflozin 10 mg demonstrated superiority versus placebo in preventing the composite of 
hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death. The difference in treatment effect was driven by 
hospitalisation for heart failure, with no difference in cardiovascular death. The treatment benefit of 
dapagliflozin over placebo was observed both in patients with and without established cardiovascular 
disease, with and without heart failure at baseline, and was consistent across key subgroups, including 
age, gender, renal function (eGFR) and region. Based on these data the choice of the same 10 mg once 
daily dose appears to be reasonable. 
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data previously showed that 10 mg dapagliflozin near maximally 
inhibits SGLT2 in the kidney. Whether this is relevant for the heart failure indication is unclear. As 
discussed below efficacy in the treatment of heart failure is likely not due to its glucose lowering effect. 
Every attempt was made to maintain patients on a 10 mg dose of dapagliflozin or matching placebo in the 
pivotal trial. In specific cases that could not be resolved by reducing the dose of, or stopping concomitant, 
non-essential medications, reduction of dapagliflozin to 5 mg or matching placebo was allowed per 
protocol. All patients received the current available standard of care treatment for HFrEF. Therefore, 
placebo was an appropriate comparator. 
In the pivotal study (DAPA HF) few patients received dapagliflozin 5 mg or matching placebo at any time 
during the study; 1.9% and 1.6% in the dapagliflozin and placebo group, respectively and 1.8% and 
1.2%, respectively, had AEs leading to a dose reduction to the 5 mg dose, of which only 4 dose 
reductions were caused by an SAE. The main AE leading to dose reduction was hypotension. The small 
number of patients exposed to dapagliflozin 5 mg prevents conclusions about the efficacy of this dose in 
patients with HFrEF.

Methods 
Study Design 
The study’s primary objective was to determine superiority of dapagliflozin versus placebo in reducing the 
first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, hospitalisation for HF, or an urgent HF visit 
(hospitalisation for HF and urgent HF visit are hereafter jointly referred to as HF event).  
DAPA-HF  was  a  Phase  III,  international,  multi-centre,  parallel  group,  event  driven,  randomised,  double-
blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) 
evaluating  the  effect  of  dapagliflozin  compared  to  placebo,  given  once  daily  in  addition  to  background 
regional  standard  of  care  therapy  for  reduction  of  cardiovascular  death  or  heart  failure  (HF)  events 
(hospitalisation for HF or an urgent HF visit).

•  Type 1 diabetes mellitus 
Treatments 
Dapagliflozin 5m and 10 mg film-coated tablets and its matching placebo were packaged in bottles. Each 
bottle contained 155 tablets.  
One tablet daily at approximately the same time was administered (oral). If a dose was missed, the next 
regularly scheduled dose was to be taken and was not to be doubled by way of compensation. Patients 
were randomised to the preferred 10 mg dose of dapagliflozin or matching placebo. Every attempt was 
made to maintain patients on a 10-mg dose , but in specific cases, where a relevant event of volume 
depletion, hypotension or unexpected worsening of kidney function was seen, and when these could not 
be resolved by reducing the dose of, or stopping concomitant non-essential medications, as assessed on 
an individual basis  by the investigator, reduction of dapagliflozin to 5mg or matching placebo was 
allowed. 
Patients in the study were treated with background standard of care for HFrEF according to treatment 
guidelines. Treatment included angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor 
blockers (ARB) or sacubitril/valsartan and beta-blockers, as well as a mineralocorticoid receptor

antagonist (MRA), where appropriate, unless contraindicated or not tolerated. Most patients required a 
diuretic, generally a loop diuretic, to control symptoms. 
Concomitant treatment with any SGLT2 inhibitor, together with study drug, was prohibited during the 
study. Also in cases when study drug was interrupted or discontinued, open-label SGLT2 inhibitors were 
only to be administered when all other possibilities to treat the patient had been considered, as they 
could interfere with the interpretation of study results.

To determine whether dapagliflozin, 
compared with placebo, reduces the 
incidence of all-cause mortality. 
Time to death from any cause. 
The KCCQ (a self-administered 23-item disease-specific instrument for patients with heart failure) was 
first developed in 1996  and assessments were performed in the DAPA-HF study at randomisation, month 
4 (day120), month 8 (day 240), month 12 (Day 360) and every 12 months thereafter at Premature 
Treatment Discontinuation Visit (PTDV) and at Study Closure Visit (SCV).  
The KCCQ TSS subscale quantifies the frequency of four cardinal HF-symptoms (fatigue, peripheral 
oedema, dyspnoea, and orthopnoea) and how bothersome three of the cardinal HF symptoms 
(fatigue, peripheral oedema, and dyspnoea) are to patients.  
A 5-point threshold was selected as the primary threshold for meaningful within-patient change on the 
KCCQ TSS at month 8. This threshold was recommended by the KCCQ author based on unpublished 
analysis of the KCCQ development and validation studies. The 5-point threshold consistent with the 
threshold for the KCCQ Clinical Summary Score (CSS), which includes the TSS, has been established in 
the published literature. The Sponsor’s independent derivation of thresholds for within-patient meaningful 
change using anchor-based approaches in two NIH datasets (HF-ACTION and TOPCAT) and 
in blinded DAPA-HF data, informed additional thresholds used for supportive responder analyses. 
Responder analyses were conducted on final DAPA-HF data using a 5-point improvement (vs. no 
improvement or death) and 5-point deterioration or death (vs. no deterioration) from baseline at 8 
months in TSS for the main responder analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted with thresholds of a 
10-point deterioration to account for moderate or large deterioration, a 10-point improvement to account 
for moderate or large improvement and a 15-point improvement to account for large improvement. 
The KCCQ is a well-defined PRO instrument for measuring the experience of HF patients. It has been 
validated in patients with HF since its initial development in the mid-1990s. The MAH has submitted 
justifications for the clinical relevance of a 5 point improvement as being clinically relevant.

Sample size 
The primary objective of the study was to determine the superiority of dapagliflozin versus placebo in 
reducing the incidence of the primary composite endpoint. Assuming a true hazard ratio (HR) of 0.80 
between dapagliflozin and placebo, using a one-sided alpha of 2.5%, 844 primary endpoint events would 
provide a statistical power of 90% for the test of the primary composite endpoint. This was based on an 
overall 1:1 allocation between dapagliflozin and placebo. 
With an annual event rate of 11% in the placebo group, 4500 patients were estimated to provide the 
required number of primary events, based on an anticipated recruitment period of 18 months and an 
average follow-up period of approximately 24 months. 
4744 patients were actually randomised in this trial and the primary analysis was performed on 888 
primary endpoint events. The event rate in the placebo group was slightly higher than expected in the 
sample size calculation, 15.6 per 100 patient years. The assumptions to support the sample size are 
considered as adequate and clinically relevant. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation of patients was performed using an IxRS to balanced blocks to ensure an approximate 
balance between treatment groups (1:1). Patients were stratified by T2DM status at randomisation to 
ensure balance between treatment groups T2D at the time of randomization was based on established 
diagnosis of T2D or HbA1c more or equal to 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) shown at central laboratory test at

enrolment (visit 1). Randomisation was also monitored for geographic region, LVEF value, NYHA class and 
AF status, the results of which could have led to capping in the IxRS to avoid over- or under-
representation in patient sub-groups. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was conducted as a double blind trial. An SAP outlining all planned analyses was prepared before 
un-blinding of the data. The DMC had access to the individual treatment codes and could merge these with 
the collected study data while the study was ongoing. A DMC charter was prepared detailing the precise 
roles, responsibilities and procedures that ensured maintenance of the blinding and integrity of the study 
for the review of accumulating data and interactions with the Executive Committee. 
Statistical methods 
An SAP outlining all planned analyses was prepared before un-blinding of the data. All analyses were 
performed with Statistical Analysis System® (SAS®), version 9.4. 
No multiplicity adjustment was made to confidence intervals as they were interpreted descriptively and 
used as a measure of precision. All p-values were unadjusted. P-values for variables not included in the 
confirmatory testing sequence or following a non-significant test in the sequence were regarded as 
nominal. 
The event-based efficacy analyses included events which occurred on or prior to the Primary analysis 
censoring date (PACD). Only CV death, HF hospitalisations and urgent HF visits, confirmed by the CEA, 
were used in the analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints and their components. Deaths 
adjudicated as ‘cause undetermined’ were considered CV deaths in these analyses. 
Stratification of analyses for T2DM status was performed using the stratification values as entered in the 
IxRS to determine the randomisation assignment. 
Analysis sets 
All patients who were randomised to study treatment were included in the FAS irrespective of their 
protocol adherence and continued participation in the study. Patients were analysed according to their 
randomised study drug assignment, irrespective of the treatment received. 
Interim analysis 
One interim analysis was planned to be performed when approximately 75% of the primary events had 
been adjudicated, using the Haybittle-Peto rule. The significance level for the final analysis was 
determined by the Haybittle-Peto function based on the actual number and timing of interim analyses. 
The Sponsor and Investigators remained blinded to the results. 
The interim analysis included 74.8% (664 events) of the final number of 888 events. Superiority of 
dapagliflozin to placebo was tested at a one-sided alpha level of 0.001. If superiority was achieved for the 
primary endpoint, then superiority of dapagliflozin to placebo on CV death was to be tested at a one-sided 
level of 0.001. Following the interim analysis, the recommendation for the study was for it to continue as 
planned.

Type I error control 
To control the overall type I error rate at 0.025 one-sided, the significance level was adjusted for one 
interim analysis of efficacy. The final analysis was performed at the 0.02496 one-sided significance level. 
For clarity 2-sided p-values are presented and the threshold for statistical significance in the confirmatory 
testing was 0.04992 (corresponding to the one-sided 0.02496 level). The primary and secondary 
endpoints included in confirmatory statistical testing used a hierarchical test sequence at the 0.04992 
significance level in the following order. 
Primary: 
• 
The composite of CV death, hospitalisation for HF, or urgent HF visit 
Secondary:

•  Change from baseline at 8 months in the KCCQ-TSS

Time to death from any cause. 
Primary analysis 
In the analysis of the primary composite endpoint, treatments (dapagliflozin versus placebo) were 
compared using a Cox proportional hazards model with a factor for treatment group, stratified by T2DM 
status at randomisation, and adjusting for history of hospitalisation for heart failure. The analysis used 
withdrawal of consent (WoC), non-CV death, date of last clinical event assessment and PACD for 
censoring of patients without any primary event. The Efron method for ties and p-value based on the 
score statistic was used. Event rates (number of patients with event per 100 patient-years), p-value, HR, 
and 95% confidence interval were reported. 
The contribution of each component of the primary composite endpoint to the overall treatment effect 
was examined. In the analysis of the components, all first event of the given type were included 
irrespective of any preceding non-fatal composite event of a different type. Consequently, the sum of the 
number of patients with events in the component analysis was larger than the number of patients with 
composite events. Methods similar to those described for the primary analysis were used to separately 
analyse the time from randomisation to the first occurrence of each component of the primary composite 
endpoint as well as for secondary time to event endpoints. 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative proportion of patients with event were calculated and plotted 
for the composite endpoint and for the individual components. 
Sensitivity analyses 
Undetermined cause of death: A sensitivity analysis of the primary analysis was performed, where 
deaths adjudicated as ‘undetermined’ were not included as endpoint events but were treated as censoring 
events. 
Missing data and informative censoring: The time-to-event analysis using the Cox regression 
depended on the assumption of non-informative or ignorable censoring, corresponding to the missing-at-
Extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 38/114 
  
  
 
 
 
 
random assumption. The missing data in this context were patients who were prematurely censored due 
to withdrawal of consent, were lost to follow-up, or had otherwise incomplete follow-up of endpoints. 
A tipping point analysis was pre-specified to assess the robustness of the statistical significance of the 
primary analysis with respect to prematurely censored subjects. Due to the size of the observed 
treatment effect and the low frequency of incomplete follow-up, the tipping point analysis was replaced 
by a post-hoc "worst case analysis". Patients in the dapagliflozin group, censored before PACD, including 
those censored due to non-CV death, were considered having experienced the composite endpoint, using 
their censoring time as the time of the imputed event. Patients in the placebo group, censored before 
PACD, were considered censored and event free. 
Analysis of recurrent HF events and CV death 
The composite outcome of recurrent HF hospitalisations or CV death was analysed by the semi-parametric 
proportional rates model (Lin et al 2000) to test the treatment effect and to quantify the treatment 
difference in terms of the rate ratio with 95% confidence interval and p-value. 
In addition, the 2 components in the composite endpoint (total HF hospitalisations and CV death) were 
analysed separately to quantify the respective treatment effects and check the consistency between the 
composite and the components. To account for the correlation between the 2 components, the joint 
modelling (frailty model) approach (Rogers et al 2016) was used for the component analyses. Non-
parametric estimates of HF hospitalisation rates over time allowing for death as terminal event were also 
provided (Ghosh and Lin 2000). 
Analysis of change from baseline at 8 months in the KCCQ total symptom score 
Change from baseline at 8 months in KCCQ TSS at baseline was transformed to a composite endpoint 
with fractional ranks, using the mean method for ties and stratified by T2DM status at randomisation. 
Deaths prior to the 8-month assessment were assigned the worst ranks within each stratum. Of the 
patients who died the relative ranking was based on their last value of change from baseline in TSS while 
alive before deriving fractional ranks. This composite endpoint was analysed using the rank ANCOVA 
method (Stokes et al 2012), adjusted for ranked baseline TSS value, to test the null hypothesis of no 
differences in the distributions of ranked outcomes between the 2 treatment groups. The Cochran Mantel 
Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified for the T2DM status at randomisation, was used to compare treatment 
groups. The p value from the CMH test of treatment effect at 8 months was used for the confirmatory 
statistical testing of this secondary endpoint. 
The win ratio and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (Wang and Pocock 2016) adjusted for 
baseline KCCQ-TSS and stratified by T2DM were reported as a summary statistic using the same ranking 
approach as in the KCCQ TSS hypothesis test. The win ratio represents the odds of having a more 
favourable outcome versus a less favourable outcome when assigned to the dapagliflozin 10 mg 
treatment group as opposed to placebo. This was accomplished by creating all possible pairs of patients 
across arms and labelling patients ondapagliflozin 10 mg in each pair as “winner”, “loser” or “tied”, based 
on their ranks. The crude win ratio is defined as the ratio of the number of “winner” pairs divided by the 
number of “loser” pairs and an estimated win ratio greater than 1 favours dapagliflozin. 
Number and percentage of patients in each treatment group were summarized across the following 
categories: 5-point improvement from baseline to 8 months in KCCQ-TSS and 5-point deterioration from 
baseline to 8 months in KCCQ-TSS. If a patient had a baseline value of TSS ≥ 95 points, i.e. near the “
ceiling”, they were defined as having a 5-point improvement only if they had TSS ≥ 95 points at 8 
months. Similarly, for deterioration. The proportion of TSS responder categories were compared between 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 39/114 
  
  
 
 
 
 
treatment groups using a logistic regression model including treatment group, stratification variable (T2D 
at randomisation) and baseline TSS value. Additional responder analyses were performed in the same 
way as for 5 points improvement and deterioration described above, using the thresholds of clinically 
meaningful within-patient change from baseline TSS derived from anchor-based analyses (10 point 
improvement, 10 point deterioration, 15 point improvement. 
Patients with missing data in KCCQ-TSS for other reasons than death will have their missing TSS imputed 
using the multiple imputation (MI) methodology under the Missing at Random (MAR) assumption.

Conduct of the study 
One amendment to the study protocol was made after start of recruitment; it had no negative impact on 
the robustness of the study.   
Protocol deviations 
The  number  of  subjects  with  important  protocol  deviations  in  each  treatment  group  are  summarised  in 
Table 9. Important protocol deviations were balanced between treatment groups with respect to frequency 
and type.  
While  only  1  patient  with  LVEF  >40%  was  randomised,  a  total  of  92  (1.9%)  patients  were  randomised 
despite failing the inclusion criterion of LVEF ≤40% within the last 12 months prior to enrolment, 54 (2.3%) 
in the dapagliflozin treatment group and 38 (1.6%) in the placebo group. Most of these patients had an 
intervention (eg surgical, device, or pharmacological), with the potential to improve LVEF, within that 12- 
month period without the mandated repeat LVEF assessment ≥3 months post intervention. 
14 (0.6%) and 18 (0.8%) patients (Dapa10 mg/placebo) were randomized despite of failing the NT-proBNP 
inclusion criterion. Symptomatic hypotension or systolic BP <95 mmHg at 2 out of 3 measurements at visit 
1 or visit 2 as an exclusion criterion was present in 13 ( 0.5%) and 15 ( 0.6%) of patients respectively. 
Other reasons for not meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria were less frequent. A total of 26 (0.5%) patients 
took  open-label  SGLT2  inhibitors  (other  than the  study  drug)  during the  study  (see  Table  14.1.5.5);  13 
(0.3%) were considered prohibited medication (ie, concomitant treatment in combination with study drug.

The calculation of treatment compliance included only patients with a complete record of the number of 
tablets  returned.  Treatment  compliance  was  high  and  similar  between  treatment  groups.  In  the 
dapagliflozin and placebo groups, 81.2% and 79.5% of patients, respectively, had a compliance of >80%, 
and  75.1%  and  74.2%,  respectively,  had  a  compliance  of  >90%.  Median  (IQR)  compliance  was  98.8% 
(95.6%to 100%) and 98.7% (95.5% to 100%) in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy variable – CV death or HF event 
Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of any event in the composite of CV death 
or an HF event, with a 26% relative risk reduction (95% CI 15% to 35 %). 
Figure 3 Kaplan-Meier plot of the primary composite endpoint time to first CV death or HF 
event (FAS) 
All 3 components of the primary composite endpoint individually contributed to the overall treatment effect 
observed, as evidenced by the lower incidence of CV deaths, hospitalizations for HF, and urgent HF visits 
in the dapagliflozin treatment group compared to placebo. Although not formally tested for significance, 
treatment with dapagliflozin was associated with an 18% (95% CI 2% to 31%) relative risk reduction in 
CV death, a 30% (95% 17% to 41%) relative risk reduction in hospitalization for HF, and a 57% (95% CI 
10% to 80%) relative risk reduction in urgent HF visits, compared with placebo. (Figure 4 ).

Sensitivity analyses 
A sensitivity analysis, in which deaths adjudicated as ‘undetermined’ were not included as endpoint 
events but were treated as censoring events, was conducted, and the result was consistent with that of 
the primary analysis. 
A tipping point analysis, to assess the robustness of the observed result for the primary endpoint with 
regard to censoring prior to PACD (Primary analysis censoring date) due to incomplete follow-up and due 
to non-CV death was pre-specified. In light of the magnitude of the observed treatment effect and the low 
frequency of incomplete follow-up, with <3% of patients in each treatment group censored before PACD 
the tipping-point analysis was not performed. Instead, a “worst case scenario” analysis was performed; 
patients in the dapagliflozin treatment group, censored before PACD, including those censored due to 
non-CV death, were considered having experienced the composite endpoint, using their censoring time as 
the time of the imputed event. This rendered in total 54 new events in the dapagliflozin treatment group. 
Patients in the placebo group, censored before PACD, were considered censored and event free. In this 
analysis, the resulting treatment effect estimate remained statistically significant (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.74, 
0.96], p=0.0103).

Hazard ratio for CV death as an individual component is derived from Cox proportional hazards regression. Event rates 
are presented as the average number of events per 100 patient-years of follow-up 
Rate ratio for dapa 10mg versus placebo, confidence interval and 2-sided p-value are calculated from the LWYY 
proportional rates model stratified by T2DM status at randomisation, with factors for treatment group and history of 
HF hospitalisation.If HF hospitalisation and CV death occurred at the same day, then only the CV death is counted in 
this table. 
Fewer patients in the dapagliflozin group, compared with placebo, had ≥1 and ≥2 events of hospitalisation 
for HF or CV death (Table 21). Results of a supportive analysis, using a joint frailty model, were consistent 
with the main analysis of the endpoint. 
Patient reported outcome questionnaires 
At 8 months, the KCCQ compliance was 88.7% and 87.6% in the dapagliflozin and placebo treatment 
group, respectively. Treatment with dapagliflozin resulted in a statistically significant benefit over placebo

Renal endpoints 
No statistically significant difference was observed for the predefined renal composite endpoint between 
Dapa 10 mg and placebo. There were 28 endpoint events in the dapagliflozin treatment group and 39 
endpoint events in the placebo group (Figure 5 and Table 15).

There were no significant differences in the incidence of renal events. In particular there was even no 
numerical difference in patients reaching end stage renal disease or requiring dialysis. The cases were 
few. No conclusions can be drawn and no data should be included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

Figure 6 Time to death from any cause 
The hierarchical testing sequence stopped before the endpoint of time to death from any cause could be 
assessed. Hence, the analysis of all-cause mortality was not conducted as part of the confirmatory testing 
sequence. All-cause mortality was driven by CV death. There were 173 and 207 deaths in the 
dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, adjudicated as CV death, and 48 and 54 death adjudicated 
as non-CV deaths in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively. Undetermined cause of death was 
counted as CV death; there were 54 and 66 deaths in the dapagliflozin and placebo group, respectively, 
adjudicated as undetermined cause of death. Death occurring after withdrawal of consent were not 
adjudicated; there was 1 death in the dapagliflozin treatment group and 2 deaths in the placebo group 
after withdrawal of consent.

Ancillary analyses 
Exploratory variables 
Treatment with dapagliflozin numerically reduced the incidence of time to the first occurrence of any of the 
components of the expanded composite endpoint of worsening HF (Table 14.2.7.1) 
In addition, 3 adjudicated exploratory endpoints are reported: time to first fatal or non-fatal MI; time to 
first fatal or non-fatal stroke of any cause; and number of events with doubling of serum creatinine. There 
was no difference between dapagliflozin and placebo groups in time to first fatal or non-fatal MI and time 
to first fatal or non-fatal stroke of any cause (Tables 14.2.7.10 and 11) 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/574301/2020 
Page 55/114 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There were fewer patients with events of doubling of serum creatinine in the dapagliflozin treatment group 
(43 [1.8%]) compared with placebo (77 [3.2%]). The total number of events was 44 and 83 respectively 
in the two groups. 
The  exploratory  composite  endpoint  including  the  weaker  and  less  clearly  defined  component  of 
documented evidence of worsening HF was in line with the primary endpoint. This endpoint is influenced 
by the antidiuretic effect leading to reduction of oedemas. The clinical benefit per se is less clear and the 
results less robust compared with the primary analysis.  
The Analysis of change from baseline of EQ-5D-5L mobility score, care score (washing and dressing), usual 
activity score, pain/discomfort score, anxiety/depression score, VAS score and utility scores did not show 
significant or clinically relevant differences between Dapa 10 mg and Placebo over 24 months. The measure 
is  not  specifically  designed  to investigate  patients with  chronic  heart  failure and  does  not  contradict  the 
results  of  the  Kansas  City  Cardiomyopathy  Questionnaire  that  indicated  a  significant  improvement  in 
symptom frequency and symptom burden. 
The  results  for  the  effect  of  Dapagliflozin  vs.  Placebo  on  HbA1c,  weight  and  systolic  blood  pressure  are 
summarized below (Table 12 – 14) analyses 
Table 12: Analysis of change from baseline in HbA1c - Subjects with T2DM at baseline (FAS)

Table  14:  Analysis  of  change 
from  baseline 
in  systolic  blood  pressure  (FAS) 
The observed reductions induced by dapagliflozin on HbA1c, body weight and systolic blood pressure are 
consistent with previous results and are reflected in the current Dapagliflozin SPC labelling.  
However, the magnitude of the effect size of dapagliflozin on HbA1c (placebo-adjusted LS mean 
difference of -0.2% to -0.3% during the DAPA-HF trial) was modest, which might be explained by the low 
baseline HbA1c (7.41%) and a higher use of additional antidiabetic agents in the placebo group over the 
study duration. An LS Mean difference in SBP in the range of 1 – 2 mmHg is of clinical relevance for 
cardiovascular events in patients with arterial hypertension but cannot explain the magnitude of the 
clinical effect as observed in DAPA HF (risk reduction by 26% for the primary endpoint). E.g. Fuchs and 
Welton (Hypertension 2020; 75: 285–292 discussed data from cohort studies indicating a doubling of the 
risk for CVD for a 20 mm Hg higher level of SBP and 10 mm Hg higher level of DBP. Similarly, the 
moderate weight loss and of the moderate reduction in HbA1c in patients with T2DM may only contribute 
to a minor degree if at all.

HF medication did not change much during the study and it seems as if patients in the placebo group had 
a relevant treatment with 94 % being treated with diuretics.

 Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Dapagliflozin is a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, previously approved for the 
treatment of patients with T1DM or T2DM. In the current variation, the MAH is applying for a new 
indication (X is indicated in adults for the treatment of symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction) based on the results of one pivotal phase III study; D1699C00001, hereafter referred to as 
DAPA-HF. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Dose finding 
No results of dose response studies for the administration in patients with heart failure were submitted. 
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data previously showed that 10 mg dapagliflozin near maximally 
inhibits  SGLT2  in  the  kidney.  The  marketed  10  mg dose  of  dapagliflozin has demonstrated  a  favourable 
benefit/risk balance for the treatment of T2DM in the clinical development programme. 10 mg once daily is 
the recommended dose in patients with T2DM. A dose of 10 mg once daily was also investigated in the 
cardiovascular  outcome  study  (DECLARE)  showing  non-inferiority  vs.  placebo  for  the  composite  of 
cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke. At baseline, 10.0% of patients in the study 
had a history of heart failure. Dapagliflozin 10 mg demonstrated superiority versus placebo in preventing 
the composite of hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death. The difference in treatment effect 
was driven by hospitalisation for heart failure, with no difference in cardiovascular death. Based on these 
data 10 mg once daily was selected as a dose to be investigated in the DAPA HF trial.  In the CHMP advice, 
the MAH aimed for a 3 arm study, testing both the 5 and 10 mg dose of dapagliflozin. No in depth rational 
is given why the 5mg dose was eventually not included in the DAPA-HF. In addition, no dose finding studies 
have been performed. 
Efficacy 
The application was based on one pivotal trial (DAPA-HF trial (Study Code D1699C00001). 
The MAH has not submitted any results from clinical studies supporting the mechanism of action of 
dapagliflozin in patients with heart failure (HF), but only a discussion based on published references. In 
addition to the osmotic diuretic and related hemodynamic actions of SGLT2 inhibition, potential secondary 
effects on myocardial metabolism, ion channels, fibrosis, adipokines and uric acid have been discussed to 
be relevant for cardio-renal effects of dapagliflozin In the CHMP advice given in 2016, it was expected 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/574301/2020 
Page 66/114 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that the results of the pivotal would be supported by adequate data to elucidate the mechanism of action. 
This advice has not been followed, but the issue is not further pursued based on the rather convincing 
results of the pivotal study. 
The DAPA-HF study 
DAPA-HF was a global, event-driven, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study 
conducted at 410 sites across 20 countries, and included 4744 randomised patients. It was designed to 
evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg, compared with placebo, on the primary composite endpoint of 
CV death or HF events, when added to background standard of care, in patients with HFrEF in NYHA class 
II-IV, with T2DM or without diabetes. 
The primary variable was time from randomisation to the first event included in the composite endpoint of 
CV death, hospitalisation for HF, or urgent HF visit. Secondary variables included  time to first occurrence 
of either component of the primary endpoint; total number of (first and recurrent) HF hospitalisations and 
CV death; change from baseline, measured at 8 months, in the total symptom score (TSS) of the Kansas 
City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ); time to first occurrence of any component of the composite 
≥50% sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), end stage renal disease, or renal 
death; and time to death from any cause. Eligible patients were randomised (1:1) to dapagliflozin or 
placebo; randomisation was stratified based on T2DM status. Following randomisation, study visits 
occurred at Day 14, 60, 120, 240, and then every fourth month. 
The study was event-driven; 844 primary composite endpoint events were required to have 90% power 
to demonstrate superiority of dapagliflozin to placebo assuming a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.80. 
The study aimed to include patients with HFrEF  NYHA II- IV that were optimally treated according to 
guidelines and that did not have hypotension or recent worsening of the condition. Patients with eGFR 
<30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were excluded. 
The primary endpoint is relevant and in line with CHMP guidelines. It could have been more relevant to 
choose all cause instead of cardiovascular mortality and such an analysis was provided at CHMP request. 
However, ACM is included as a secondary endpoint. Recurrent HF hospitalisations are included as a 
secondary endpoint. This may be a complicated endpoint from a methodological point of view due to 
competing risks. The KCCQ is a well-defined PRO instrument for measuring the experience of HF patients. 
It has been validated in patients with HF since its initial development in the mid-1990s. The MAH has 
submitted justifications for the clinical relevance of a 5 point improvement as being clinically relevant. 
Treatment compliance was comparable in both groups. Approx 11 % discontinued treatment, with similar 
reasons in both groups.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose finding 
The rationale for the dose selection appears to be reasonable. Based on the data as outlined above 10 mg 
once daily was selected as a dose to be investigated in the DAPA HF trial. Few patients received dapagliflozin 
5 mg once daily or matching placebo at any time during the study 1.9% and 1.6% in the dapagliflozin and 
placebo group, respectively, mainly due to AEs. The small number of patients exposed to dapagliflozin 5 
mg prevents conclusions about the efficacy of this dose in patients with HFrEF. Although investigating an 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/574301/2020 
Page 67/114 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
additional lower dose would have been of scientific interest, the lack of such data is not considered a major 
issue of concern. 
Whereas the dose of 10 mg once daily matches the dose that is recommended for the treatment of T2DM, 
it is higher than the dose recommended in patients with T1DM (5 mg once daily). The lower dose in T1DM 
was  recommended  based  on  a  lack  of  additional  efficacy  at  higher  dose  and  considering  that  in  light  of 
possible safety concerns (DKA) the lower dose might be more appropriate. Patients with T1DM were not 
included  in  the  DAPA  HF  trial.  In the  absence  of  data  on  efficacy  and  safety,  treatment  of  patients  with 
T1DM and heart failure with dapagliflozin is not recommended. 
Efficacy 
The mean age of the study population was 66 years and the majority (77%) of the subjects were male. 
Almost 50% were recruited in Europe. The median eGFR was 64 ml/min/1.73m2, 15% had eGFR below 
45. The inclusion criteria stated that time since diagnosis should be at least 2 months. However, the 
majority had their diagnosis of HF since at least 1 year. About 50% had been hospitalised because of HF. 
67.5% / 31.6% of patients had NYHA class II / III at baseline respectively, while a very small proportion 
were in class IV (n=43, 1% of study population). Median LVEF was 32%, 56% had an ischemic aetiology, 
non-ischemic 35.6% and unknown in 8.1%. 24% had AF. 42 % had T2 diabetes. The treatment groups 
were well balanced for all these characteristics. Median NT-proBNP was 1437 (Q1, Q3 857, 2650). 93.6% 
were treated with an ACEi/ARB/ARNI, 96.1% with a beta blocker, 71.0% with an MRA, and 93.4% were 
treated with a diuretic, most commonly a loop diuretic. HF treatment at randomisation was balanced 
between treatment groups. Device therapy was balanced between treatment groups: CRT-D or CRT-P ( n 
(%) Dapa vs. Placebo): 190 (8.0) vs. 164 (6.9), ICD: 467 (19.7) 486 (20.5), ICD or CRT-D: 622 (26.2) 
620 (26.1). There was little change in the administration of concomitant heart failure specific additional 
therapy over the course of the study (24 months) in both treatment arms with the exception of a 
moderate increase in the administration of Neprilysin inhibitor/ARB (ARNI). Thus, baseline treatment 
seems to have been adequate and according to treatment guidelines.  
Primary efficacy result: 
Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of the composite of CV death or a HF event 
with a 26% relative risk reduction (95% CI 15% to 35%), p<0.0001. The event rate of primary endpoint 
events was 11.6 in the dapagliflozin treatment group and 15.6 in the placebo group. The median duration 
of  follow-up  time  was  18.2  months.    The  effect  size  is  considered  clinically  relevant  and  sufficiently 
compelling to support an application based on one pivotal trial. 
The performed sensitivity analysis did not have a large influence on the results 
Results for the individual components 
All 3 components of the primary composite endpoint individually contributed to the overall treatment effect 
observed, as evidenced by the lower incidence of CV deaths, hospitalizations for HF, and urgent HF visits 
in the dapagliflozin treatment group compared to placebo. Although not formally tested for significance, 
treatment with dapagliflozin was associated with an 18% (95% CI 2% to 31%) relative risk reduction in 
CV death, a 30% (95% 17% to 41%) relative risk reduction in hospitalization for HF, and a 57% (95% CI 
10% to 80%) relative risk reduction in urgent HF visits, compared with placebo. 
The major cause of death was cardiovascular. When adding deaths from other causes, the difference is 
still in favour of dapagliflozin.

Secondary efficacy results 
Treatment with dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in time to first event of CV death or 
hospitalisation for HF. Dapa 10 mg (n = 2373) vs. Placebo (n = 2371), n = 382 vs. 495 events, HR 
0.75 (0.65, 0.85) p <0.0001 and in reducing the total numbers of events in the composite of CV death 
and recurrent HF hospitalisation. There were 567 and 742 events of CV death or hospitalisation for HF 
in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, corresponding to event rates per 100 patient-years 
of 16.3 and 21.6, respectively (p= 0.0002). Although the effect on recurrent events is not easily 
interpreted in the presence of terminal events it is in this case considered to support the analyses of time 
to first event endpoints. 
The incidence of all-cause mortality was numerically lower in the dapagliflozin treatment group 
compared with the placebo group (nominal p-value 0.0217). There were 276 and 329 patients who died 
in the dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo groups, respectively, corresponding to event rates per 100 
patient-years of 7.9 and 9.5. In line with the predefined hierarchical testing procedure the result is 
considered exploratory only. The numerical difference was largely driven by CV deaths, but also the 
numbers non-CV deaths and of deaths of undetermined cause were lower in the dapagliflozin treatment 
group. 
In the DAPA-HF study, the main PRO was the KCCQ, for which the MAH investigated the clinically 
meaningful levels of individual change from baseline at 8 months in KCCQ-TSS. A clinically relevant 
improvement or deterioration in KCCQ-TSS was defined as a change from baseline of ≥5 points. The 
difference in responders based on this cut off (as well as for the 10 and 15% improvement cut off) 
compared to placebo was of statistical significance.  
There were no significant differences in the incidence of the composite of ≥50% sustained decline in 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), end stage renal disease, or renal death; or death from any 
cause. However, the cases were few.  
Subgroups 
Overall, the results for the primary endpoint were consistent with the overall beneficial result in most but 
not all of the pre-defined subgroups (age, sex, race, geographical region, NYHA class, LVEF, NTproBNP, 
prior hospitalisation, MRA use, diabetes status, AF, aetiology, BMI, eGFR). Consistent results for most of 
the subgroups were observed for the heart failure events (hospitalization for HF or urgent visit). However, 
there was some heterogeneity for CV and all cause deaths that in turn translated into some heterogeneity 
for the primary efficacy endpoint. For the primary endpoint efficacy tended to be lower in the European 
population (HR 0.84 (0.69, 1.01)) than in other patients, which was due to a lack of an effect on CV 
mortality in the European population (HR 0.97 (0.76 – 1.25)). In addition, relative efficacy was lower in 
patients at advanced stages of heart failure as defined by higher NYHA class (NYHA class III or IV, p for 
interaction 0.0087) or higher baseline NT-proBNP levels (p for interaction 0.1238). This was due to a 
numerically higher rate of CV deaths in patients at NYHA stage III and IV (HR 1.09 (0.85-1.41 p value for 
interaction 0.0023). The MAH has carefully analysed the data, without finding any credible explanation to 
this finding. These findings are not supported by a biological rationale, and not consistently found when 
other disease severity markers (LVEF, NT-proBNP, MAGGIC score and KCCQ-TSS) are used.  Further, an 
increased risk of mortality is not supported by other safety findings in the DAPA HF study.

Page 69/114 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, data in this subgroup support a positive effect on reducing hospitalisations for HF which is 
indeed a clinically relevant outcome. Therefore, a benefit of treatment is expected also in patients with 
more severe heart failure.  
The effect did not seem to be influenced by eGFR at baseline, but patients with eGFR <30 were excluded 
from  the  study.  Provided  analyses  do  not  indicate  a  risk  of  reduced  effect  based  in  patients  with  lower 
eGFR, but the fact that the experience is very limited is reflected in the SmPC.  
 Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The MAH for dapagliflozin is applying for a new indication; treatment of symptomatic heart failure with 
reduced ejection fraction based on one pivotal study. The study was large, multinational, randomised and 
placebo controlled and overall of acceptable design and conduct. Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in 
reducing the incidence of the composite of CV death or a HF event with a 26% relative risk reduction 
(95% CI 15% to 35%), p<0.0001. This is considered as a clinically relevant effect. The effect was in 
general consistent in subgroups (eg in patients with and without type 2 diabetes), even if a beneficial 
effect on CV mortality was not seen in patients with more severe HF. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The current safety evaluation is based on data from the recently completed CV outcome study DAPA-HF. 
The study population was patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction 
(HFrEF) and included subjects with and without T2DM. 
Patient exposure 
The safety analysis set (SAS) included all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of 
randomised study drug, i.e. 4,736 patients; 2,368 patients in the dapagliflozin group and the placebo 
group, respectively. 
On-treatment: any event with an onset date on, or after, first dose of randomised study drug and on, or 
before, 30 days after last dose of study drug. 
On and off treatment: any event with onset on, or after, first dose of randomised study drug regardless of 
whether the patient was on, or off, study treatment at the time of the event. 
All summaries of AEs were presented for the SAS for both treatment periods and safety laboratory data 
were presented for the SAS for the on-treatment period. 
Duration of exposure to study drug 
The duration of exposure to study drug ranged from 0 to 28.3 months. In total, there were 3,310 patient-
years of exposure to dapagliflozin in the study. The median duration of exposure to study drug was

similar between treatment groups: 17.8 months in the dapagliflozin treatment group and 17.6 months in 
the placebo group.

Study dose reduction 
In specific cases, where a clinically relevant event of volume depletion, hypotension and/or unexpected 
worsening of kidney function was seen, and when these could not be resolved by reducing the dose of, or 
stopping concomitant, non-essential medications, reduction of dapagliflozin to 5 mg or matching placebo 
was allowed per protocol. 
The number of patients with dose reduction of study drug was low and balanced between treatment 
groups. Less than 2% of patients in both treatment groups had dose reduction (45 [1.9%] patients in the 
dapagliflozin treatment group and 39 [1.6%] patients in the placebo group) and most of these patients 
did not return to the 10 mg dose of dapagliflozin or matching placebo. 
The most frequent reason for dose reduction was AE: 42 (1.8%) patients in the dapagliflozin treatment 
group and 28 (1.2%) patients in the placebo group; SAEs that led to dose reduction were observed in 3 
(0.1%) patients in the dapagliflozin treatment group and 1 (0.0%) patient in the placebo group. The most 
common AE that led to dose reduction of study drug was hypotension: 20 (0.8%) patients in the 
dapagliflozin treatment group and 11 (0.5%) patients in the placebo group. 
Study drug interruption 
The frequency of temporary interruption of study drug was lower in the dapagliflozin treatment group 
compared with the placebo group: 341 (14.4%) patients and 396 (16.7%) patients, respectively. Most 
patients had only 1 period of interruption. The median number of days per interruption was 13 days in 
the dapagliflozin treatment group and 18 days in the placebo group. The reasons for interruption were 
similar between treatment groups. The most common reason for interruption of study drug was AE: 
277(11.7%) patients in the dapagliflozin treatment group and 330 (13.9%) patients in the placebo group. 
The only AE, by PT, that led to interruption of study drug in ≥1% patients overall was cardiac failure: 
50 (2.1%) patients in the dapagliflozin treatment group and 78 (3.3%) patients in the placebo group. 
Demographic and other characteristics of study population 
At screening, the DAPA-HF study included patients with HFrEF in NYHA class II-IV, including patients with 
T2DM and without diabetes, and patients with baseline eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2.  
Baseline patient characteristics were balanced between treatment groups and there were nearly equal 
proportions of patients with T2DM, 45.3% and 44.9%, in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, 
respectively. 
Adverse events 
Data collection in this study focused on the following safety variables: serious AEs (SAEs), AEs leading to 
discontinuation (DAEs), AEs leading to dose interruption or dose reduction, and AEs of special interest, 
and clinical chemistry and haematological parameters. 
A summary of AEs for subjects on-treatment and on and off treatment is presented in Table 19.

Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
During the on and off treatment period, the number of patients who died were fewer in the dapagliflozin 
treatment group compared with the placebo group: 286 (12.1%) patients and 333 (14.1%) patients, 
respectively. The 3 most commonly reported AEs with an outcome of death in the dapagliflozin treatment 
group were: cardiac failure, death and sudden death; and in the placebo group they were: cardiac failure, 
death and sudden cardiac death. 
During the on-treatment period, there were 227 patients (9.6%) in the dapagliflozin treatment group and 
250 patients (10.6%) in the placebo group who died.

During the on-treatment period, the numbers of patients with SAEs were fewer in the dapagliflozin 
treatment group compared with the placebo group: 846 (35.7%) patients and 951 (40.2%) patients, 
respectively.  The most frequently reported SAEs for dapagliflozin vs placebo were cardiac failure (10% vs 
14%), pneumonia (3.0% vs 3.1%), cardiac failure congestive (2.4% vs 2.7%) and cardiac failure acute 
(1.5% vs 2.2%).

Adverse events of special interest and other analysis 
AEs of special interest: AEs suggestive of volume depletion, renal AEs, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), major 
hypoglycaemic events and fractures. 
Additional safety analysis: UTIs, genital infections and Fournier’s gangrene. 
Results from all pre-specified sub-group analyses (age [≤65, >65], baseline eGFR [<60, ≥60 
mL/min/1.73 m2], and baseline systolic BP [<130, ≥130 mmHg]) and additional post-hoc subgroup 
analyses (baseline renal function and baseline diabetes status) are presented in section Special 
populations. 
AEs suggestive of volume depletion 
During the on-treatment period, the frequency of any AEs suggestive of volume depletion was 7.2% 
(n=170) in the dapagliflozin treatment group and 6.5% (n=153) in the placebo group, corresponding to 
event rates of 5.09 and 4.64 events per 100 patient-years, respectively. DAEs were <0.5% patients in 
both treatment groups. There were fewer patients with SAEs in the dapagliflozin treatment group 
compared with the placebo group: 23 (1.0%) patients and 38 (1.6%) patients, respectively. 
The most commonly reported AEs were hypotension, dehydration, and hypovolaemia. Results from sub-
group analyses, see section Special population. 
MAHs proposal to remove volume depletion from the SmPC 
In the DECLARE study, in patients with T2DM, the event rates of volume depletion were 0.7 events per 
100 patient-years in both the dapagliflozin treatment group and the placebo group. The event rate of 
volume depletion in the DAPA-HF study was substantially higher, corresponding to 5.1 and 4.6 events per 
100 patient-years in the dapagliflozin treatment group and placebo group, respectively. The higher 
incidence of volume depletion reflects that HFrEF patients are susceptible to side effects like volume

EMA/574301/2020

depletion and renal events when treated with currently approved and guidelines recommended therapy. 
Despite this, the DAPA-HF study showed no increase in the incidence of volume depletion with 
dapagliflozin treatment compared with the placebo group. The numbers of AEs and DAEs suggestive of 
volume depletion were balanced between treatment groups and there were fewer patients with SAEs in 
the dapagliflozin treatment group (23 patients) compared with the placebo group (38 patients).  
It is the MAH’s position that the combined findings of these 2 CVOTs allow the conclusion that treatment 
with dapagliflozin does not increase the risk for volume depletion. This conclusion is supported by the 
fewer SAEs suggestive of volume depletion with dapagliflozin treatment in the DAPA-HF population, which 
was at high risk for volume depletion both due to the intercurrent condition and concomitant medication. 
Thus, the MAH considers that there is no longer a need for a recommendation to interrupt treatment with 
dapagliflozin in patients with volume depletion. 
The Applicant was requested to provide a further justification for the removal of  volume depletion from 
section 4.4.  
Assessment of the Response concluded that in the DAPA-HF study, events suggestive of volume depletion 
was overall increased compared to the clinical development programme, most likely reflecting treatment 
in a more vulnerable patient population. However, the incidence of volume depletion was slightly higher 
for dapagliflozin compared with placebo in both the clinical development programme (1.1% vs 0.7%) and 
the DAPA-HF study (7.2% vs 6.5%), indicating that dapagliflozin contributes to the events of volume 
depletion; most of the events were non-serious.  
The adverse event ‘volume depletion’ includes several predefined preferred terms, e.g. dehydration, 
hypovolaemia and hypotension. One single predefined PT might have been reported as a non-serious 
event; however, the consequence of the contributed volume depletion with dapagliflozin treatment is still 
considered to be a risk that could become serious, especially in vulnerable patients or in case of 
intercurrent conditions due to gastrointestinal illness. Moreover, the increased risk of haematocrit with 
dapagliflozin is most likely due to volume depletion. Therefore, the following warning in section 4.4 
regarding the risk of volume depletion on an individual basis should be kept: 
“In case of intercurrent conditions that may lead to volume depletion (e.g. gastrointestinal illness), 
careful monitoring of volume status (e.g. physical examination, blood pressure measurements, laboratory 
tests including haematocrit and electrolytes) is recommended. Temporary interruption of treatment with 
dapagliflozin is recommended for patients who develop volume depletion until the depletion is corrected 
(see section 4.8)” 
Renal adverse events 
During the on-treatment period, the frequency of renal events was 6.0% (n=141) in the dapagliflozin 
treatment group and 6.7% (n=158) patients in the placebo group, corresponding to event rates of 4.22 
and 4.79 events per 100 patient-years, respectively. DAEs were <0.5% patients in both treatment 
groups. SAEs were fewer in the dapagliflozin treatment group compared with the placebo group: 34 
(1.4%) patients and 58 (2.4%) patients, respectively.

SAEs of AKI were reported for 20 [1.0%] patients in the dapagliflozin treatment group and 41 [1.7%] 
patients in the placebo group (Table 20). 
The most commonly reported AEs for dapagliflozin vs placebo were renal impairment (2.8% vs 2.7%), 
AKI (1.8% vs 2.6%), and renal failure (1.6% vs 1.6%).  
Results from sub-group analyses, see section Special population. 
Diabetic ketoacidosis 
All potential events of DKA were submitted to an independent, blinded DKA Adjudication Committee and 
assigned a likelihood of being DKA. 
Three patients had an event adjudicated as definite DKA; no events were adjudicated as probable DKA. 
All 3 events were from the dapagliflozin treatment group during the on-treatment period.  
All 3 patients were treated with anti-diabetic medication during the study, of which 1 patient was on 
concomitant insulin treatment. Contributing factors reported were: infection, illness, poor intake of 
food/drink, and dehydration. 
One event had a fatal outcome. An elderly female patient with a history of T2DM treated with metformin 
and gliclazide, was hospitalised on day 399, after being found unconscious at home. At admission, the 
laboratory data revealed hyperglycaemia, ketonaemia, and ketonuria. The patient was suspected to have 
stopped her antidiabetic treatment. Concurrently, the patient was diagnosed with renal insufficiency and 
exacerbation of chronic pyelonephritis. The patient died 8 days later with a primary cause of death 
reported as diabetic ketoacidotic hyperglycaemic coma and secondary cause of death reported as 
polyorganic insufficiency. 
Major hypoglycaemic events 
Major hypoglycaemia was defined as an event that required assistance of another person to actively 
administer carbohydrates, glucagon, or to take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose concentrations 
may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following the corrective actions was 
considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration. Major 
hypoglycaemic episodes were recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) as an AE and on an 
additional eCRF page. 
During the on-treatment period, there were 9 major hypoglycaemic events in 8 patients, 4 patients in 
each treatment group.

All patients with major hypoglycaemic events had T2DM at baseline; see section Special populations. 
Patients with major hypoglycaemic events in both treatment groups were using sulphonylureas or insulin, 
or a combination, at the time of event, except for 1 patient in the placebo group who was not taking anti-
diabetic medication at the time of the event. 
Fractures 
During the on and off treatment period, the frequency of fractures was 2.1% (n=49) in the dapagliflozin 
treatment group and 2.1% (n=50) in the placebo group, corresponding to event rates of 1.38 and 1.42 
events per 100 patient-years, respectively. 
Results from sub-group analyses, see section Special population. 
Amputations 
During the on and off treatment period, the number of patients who underwent at least 1 surgical 
amputation were balanced between treatment groups: 13 (0.5%) and 12 (0.5%) patients in the 
dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively. Most patients had one amputation (7 patients in the 
dapagliflozin treatment group and 9 patients in the placebo group); all were lower limb surgical 
amputations.

Conditions that triggered amputation were similar between treatment groups. The most common 
condition that triggered amputation was infection, occurring in 9 patients in both the dapagliflozin and 
placebo groups.  
Events leading to a risk for lower limb amputation (“preceding events”) 
Collection of data on events leading to a risk for lower limb amputations “preceding events”, including 
cases that did not result in an amputation, was added as a regulatory requirement by the EMA/PRAC for 
all clinical trials which included SGLT2 inhibitors and were more than 12 weeks in duration.  
During the on and off treatment period, the number of patients with “preceding events” was 155 (6.5%) 
patients in the dapagliflozin treatment group and 120 (5.1%) patients in the placebo group. Of these 
patients, the number of patients who underwent subsequent amputations was 13 patients in the 
dapagliflozin treatment group, and 10 patients in the placebo group.

SAEs or DAEs indicating genital area infections or necrotising fasciitis were identified based on a pre-
specified list of PTs. The identified events were then medically assessed by Applicant using pre-defined 
criteria to confirm cases of Fournier’s gangrene. All assessments were made prior to unblinding of 
treatment allocation. 
Six cases indicating genital area infections or necrotizing fasciitis were identified for medical assessment; 
3 cases in the dapagliflozin group and 3 cases in the placebo group. None of these events were confirmed 
as Fournier’s gangrene. 
Urinary tract infections 
During the on-treatment period, the number of patients with SAEs and DAEs of UTI was 18 (0.8%) for 
dapagliflozin and 22 (0.9%) for placebo. Most patients only experienced 1 event (18 patients in the 
dapagliflozin group and 20 patients in the placebo group). Recurrent events were experienced by 2 
patients, both of whom were in the placebo group. 
The effect of diabetes status is discussed in section Special populations. 
Genital infections 
During the on-treatment period, SAEs and DAEs of genital infections were rare. Only 1 patient had an 
SAE of genital infection, in the placebo group. Seven patients, all in the dapagliflozin treatment group, 
had a DAE of genital infection. 
The effect of diabetes status is discussed as an intrinsic factor in section Special populations. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Mean haematocrit levels increased early and plateaued after month 4 in the dapagliflozin treatment 
group. The increase was not considered clinically relevant. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/574301/2020 
Page 80/114 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An increase from baseline to week 52 in haematocrit concentration was observed for dapagliflozin (7.3%) 
compared to placebo (0%). At 28 months, the increase was 4.9% for dapagliflozin relative 0% for 
placebo. Increased haematocrit is adequately labelled (frequency ‘common’) for dapagliflozin. 
Table 25 Hematocrite values over time in SI units - on treatment  
Clinical chemistry 
Mean changes in blood alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase 
(AST), total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), N-terminal 
pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), phosphate, potassium, sodium, and eGFR were presented at 
baseline and over time. 
There were no clinically relevant mean changes in blood ALT, ALP, AST, and total bilirubin, and blood urea 
nitrogen in either treatment group. 
Creatinine/ eGFR 
There were increases in mean serum creatinine in both treatment groups over time. This mean increase 
occurred early in the dapagliflozin treatment group. Consequently, there was a decrease in eGFR, which 
was initially more pronounced, in the dapagliflozin treatment group compared with the placebo group. At 
20 months, change from baseline in eGFR was similar between the treatment groups.

Table 26 Creatinine values over time in SI units - on treatment  
Table 27 eGFR values over time in SI units - on treatment  
There was an increase in serum creatinine (6.5% vs 0.9%) and a decrease in eGFR (-6.5% vs -1.7%) for 
dapagliflozin vs placebo 14 days after treatment was initiated. The eGFR values for dapagliflozin vs 
placebo changed over time as follows: At 2 months: -5.3% vs -1.4%, 4 months: -5.3% vs -2.0%,  
8 months: -5.6% vs -4.1%, 12 months: -6.1% vs -4.7%, 16 months: -7.9% vs -6.6%,  
20 months: -8.0% vs -7.0%, 24 months: -9.4% vs -8.1% and 28 months: -10% vs -7.9%). The serum 
creatinine increased similarly over time. In the DAPA-HF study, eGFR decreased over time in both the 
dapagliflozin and the placebo group. The change in eGFR was initially (within 2 weeks) more pronounced

for dapagliflozin compared to placebo (-6.5% vs -1.7%); however, the difference between dapagliflozin 
and placebo was less noticeable at month 20 (-8.0% vs -7.0%) and onwards. 
HbA1C 
Mean changes in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was presented at baseline and over time. 
Marked laboratory abnormalities 
Marked laboratory abnormalities of ALT, AST and bilirubin below 
Table 28 Marked abnormalities of ALT, AST and bilirubin 
There were 0.3% in both treatment groups meeting the criteria of ALT >3x upper limit of normal and 
0.2% vs 0.3% for dapagliflozin vs placebo meeting the criteria of AST >3x ULN. Total bilirubin >3x ULN 
was 1.9% and 1.5% for dapagliflozin and placebo, respectively. 
Vital signs and physical findings 
Body weight 
There was a decrease in mean body weight in the dapagliflozin treatment group compared to the placebo 
treatment group (-1.4 kg in the dapagliflozin treatment group and -0.0 kg in the placebo group at month 
20).  
Table 29 (update) Vital signs variables over time - on treatment (SAS); change in weight 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/574301/2020

There was a decrease in mean body weight over time in the dapagliflozin group compared to placebo;  
-1.4% vs 0.1% at 16 months, -1.7% vs 0% at 20 months, -2.0% vs 0.2% at 24 months and -3.6% vs  
-0.2% at 28 months. Weight loss in HF patients could be associated with increased mortality. The 
Applicant was asked to present weight loss in different BMI-strata and to address if mortality was 
increased in subjects with weight loss.  Assessment of the applicant`s response showed that weight loss 
over time was more pronounced in subjects with higher BMI at baseline (>35 and 30-35 kg/m2) 
compared with subjects with lower baseline BMI (25-30 and 20-25 kg/m2). However, the incidence of all-
cause mortality was numerically lower in the dapagliflozin group compared with placebo; overall and 
across BMI strata. 
Blood pressure 
Systolic blood pressure (SBP) declined from baseline in the dapa group. The decline was most pronounced 
(-3.1 mmHg) early in the study (at Day 14). Thereafter, SBP tended to increase again with some 
fluctuation up to Month 20.

Effect of T2DM 
At baseline, 2,136 (45.1%) patients had T2DM and 2,600 (54.9%) patients did not have diabetes. The 
effect of diabetes at baseline was analysed for SAEs, DAEs and the AEs of special interest and additionally 
for UTIs and genital infections (Table 31).

Post-hoc analysis by baseline eGFR (<45, ≥45 – <60, ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
Renal function was analysed through post-hoc sub-group analysis of baseline eGFR (<45, ≥45–<60,  
≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2) to further characterise the safety profile of dapagliflozin in patients with HF.  
A summary of AEs for the sub-group analyses by baseline eGFR (<45, ≥45 –<60, ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
is presented in Table 33. 
The results of sub-group analysis by baseline eGFR (<45, ≥45 –<60, ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2) were 
generally consistent with the overall results. Similar to the overall results, there were fewer patients with 
SAEs suggestive of volume depletion and renal SAEs in the dapagliflozin treatment group. The number of 
patients with fractures was small, with numerically more patients in the dapagliflozin treatment group (15 
[4.1%] patients) compared with the placebo group (10 [2.8%] patients) in the sub-group of baseline GFR 
<45mL/min/1.73 m2. Manual review of fractures in this sub-group did not identify any patterns with 
regard to patient characteristics, time-to-onset, cause or type of fractures. 
An eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at enrolment was an inclusion criterion and 24 patients with an eGFR <30 
mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline were randomised. According to the Applicant, manual review of these 
patients did not reveal any safety concerns.

Effect by sex 
Of the 4,744 patients in the DAPA-HF study, 76.6% were male and 23.4% were female. Pre-specified 
sub-group analysis by sex was performed for fractures. The number of patients with fractures in the sub-
group analysis by sex were in females 3.4% vs 2.2% and in males 1.7% vs 2.1%, for dapagliflozin vs 
placebo. 
Effect by baseline blood pressure 
Pre-specified sub-group analysis by systolic blood pressure at baseline (<130, ≥130 mmHg) was 
performed for AEs suggestive of volume depletion. The incidence of volume depletion was 8.3% vs 7.2% 
(SAEs: 1.2% vs 1.6%) in subjects <130 mmHg and 4.7% vs 4.7% (SAEs: 0.4% vs 1.6%) in subjects 
≥130 mmHg for dapagliflozin vs placebo. 
Extrinsic factors 
No extrinsic factors were analysed in the DAPA-HF study. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Interactions between dapagliflozin and other drugs or food were addressed in the original dapagliflozin 
T2DM clinical programme. No new information is available on the potential impact on safety of such 
interactions in HFrEF patients. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
During the on-treatment period, the number of patients with DAEs were 111 (4.7%) patients and 116 
(4.9%) patients in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively (Table 36). The most common AEs 
that led to permanent discontinuation of study drug were cardiac failure, dizziness and hypotension for 
the dapagliflozin treatment group and cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive and renal impairment for 
the placebo group.

Pregnant patients were excluded from participating in the DAPA-HF study. There were no pregnancies 
reported during the DAPA-HF study. 
Overdose 
There were no events of overdose of study drug during the DAPA-HF study. 
Drug abuse 
The potential for drug abuse for dapagliflozin has not been studied.  
Withdrawal and rebound 
The effect of dapagliflozin withdrawal and rebound has not been studied.  
Post marketing experience 
Post-marketing experience in the approved indications is summarised in regular periodic benefit-risk 
evaluation reports (PBRERs) that are submitted to regulatory authorities worldwide. The annual 
dapagliflozin PBRER with data lock 04 October 2019, including approximately 7,926,295 patient-years of 
post-marketing exposure (cumulative until 30 September 2019), is currently under preparation. At the 
data lock of the dapagliflozin PBRER (04 October 2019), there was according to the Applicant no new 
information to alter the overall positive benefit-risk profile for dapagliflozin in the approved indications. 
 Discussion on clinical safety 
The established safety profile of dapagliflozin is based on the original dapagliflozin (submission for 
treatment of T2DM), including the DECLARE CV outcome study. The evaluation of the DAPA-HF CV 
outcome study provides information on the safety profile of dapagliflozin in subjects with heart failure and 
reduced ejection fraction. The study population included patients with T2DM (45%) and without diabetes 
(55%). 
In study DAPA-HF, 2,368 subjects were treated with dapagliflozin for a total exposure of 3,310 PY, 
regardless of interruptions (i.e. ‘on and off’ treatment), with 1,955 subjects (83%) for at least 52 weeks, 
1,168 subjects (49%) for at least 1,5 years and 261 subjects (11%) for at least 2 years. The mean 
duration of exposure was 16.8 and 16.6 months and the median duration of exposure was 17.8 and 17.6 
months for dapagliflozin and placebo, respectively. The actual mean/median duration of exposure, 
excluding interruptions (i.e. on-treatment) was similar to ‘on and off treatment’ with a total exposure of 
3,285 PY for dapagliflozin. The median duration of follow-up was 18.2 months. 
Data collection in this study focused on serious AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation (DAEs) and AEs of 
special interest. The safety profile with regards to SAEs did not differ in any substantial way between 
patients with diabetes and the new target population, i.e. non-diabetic patients. 
The number of SAEs was lower in the dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group. The most frequently 
reported SAEs for dapagliflozin vs placebo were cardiac failure (10% vs 14%), pneumonia (3.0% vs 
3.1%), cardiac failure congestive (2.4% vs 2.7%) and cardiac failure acute (1.5% vs 2.2%). 
Urinary tract infections 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/574301/2020 
Page 92/114 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
The incidence of SAEs of UTI was low and balanced for dapagliflozin vs placebo (0.6% vs 0.7%), including 
the subgroups with T2DM (0.7% vs 0.9%) and without T2DM (0.5% vs 0.5%). There were 4 SAEs of 
pyelonephritis; 3 cases in the dapagliflozin group. The incidence of events of UTI leading to 
discontinuation was balanced and equal in the overall population and two subgroups with and without 
T2DM (0.2% vs 0.2%).   
Genital infections 
Only 1 SAE of genital infections (placebo group) in a subject with T2DM was reported. Seven patients 
(0.3%), all in the dapagliflozin treatment group, had an event of genital infection leading to 
discontinuation.  
Volume depletion 
The incidence of adverse events suggestive of volume depletion was slightly increased for dapagliflozin vs 
placebo (7.2% vs 6.5%). However, there were fewer subjects with SAEs in the dapagliflozin treatment 
group (1.0%) compared with the placebo group (1.6%). 
Events of volume depletion was reported more frequently with dapagliflozin (7.0%) than with placebo 
(5.6%) in subjects without T2DM (7.0% vs 5.6%) and was reported equally frequent in subjects with 
T2DM (7.4% vs 7.5%).  
Across the eGFR strata, the incidence of volume depletion for dapagliflozin relative placebo was slightly 
increased: eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (5.8% vs 5.2%), eGFR 60–45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (8.4% vs 7.1%) 
and eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (11% vs 10%).  
Renal events  
Renal events occurred slightly more frequently in the placebo group (6.7%) than in the dapagliflozin 
group (6.0%) in the overall population and for subjects with T2DM (7.8% vs 8.2% for DAPA vs placebo) 
and without T2DM (4.4% vs 5.4% for DAPA vs placebo). SAEs of renal events were also higher in the 
placebo relative the dapagliflozin group; overall and in both subgroups. The same pattern was observed 
for AEs and SAEs of acute kidney injury, i.e. more frequently reported for placebo than for dapagliflozin. 
The  frequency  of  renal  events  was  higher  for  placebo  relative  dapagliflozin  in  subjects  with  eGFR  <45 
mL/min/1.73  m2  (13%  vs  16%)  and  eGFR  60–45  mL/min/1.73  m2  (7.0%  vs  8.9%)  and  was  slightly 
increased for dapagliflozin (3.8%) vs placebo (3.3%) in subjects with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2.  
Fractures 
The incidence of fractures was balanced between the dapagliflozin and placebo group in the overall 
population (2.1% respectively), in subjects with T2DM (2.1% vs 2.4%) and without T2DM (2.1% vs 
1.9%) and in subjects with eGFR 60–45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (2.2% vs 2.5%) and eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 
(1.5% vs 1.8%). However, in subjects with eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (4.1% vs 2.8%), the incidence of 
fractures was increased for dapagliflozin compared to placebo.  In this subgroup, no obvious differences 
between the treatment groups were identified with regards to subject characteristics, apart from more 
subjects with osteoporosis in the medical history in the dapagliflozin group (5 of 15) compared with the 
placebo group (1 of 10). Most of the cases for dapagliflozin was caused by fall; however, none of the 
subjects had reported events suggestive of volume depletion (e.g. dehydration, orthostatic hypotension) 
that could have contributed to or caused the fall.   
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/574301/2020 
Page 93/114 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Pre-specified sub-group analysis by sex was performed for fractures. The number of patients with 
fractures in the sub-group analysis by sex were in females 3.4% vs 2.2% and in males 1.7% vs 2.1%, for 
dapagliflozin vs placebo. 
Diabetic ketoacidosis 
In total 5 subjects had an event adjudicated as an DKA, all in the dapagliflozin group; 3 events were 
adjudicated as a definite DKA (all serious of which one fatal outcome) and 2 events as a possible DKA 
(both non-serious). All subjects had T2DM and were treated with anti-diabetic medication of which 4 
subjects were on concomitant insulin treatment. The 3 events adjudicated as a definite DKA occurred in 
subjects with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
Major hypoglycaemic events 
In the DAPA-HF study only major hypoglycaemic events were collected. Subjects with major 
hypoglycaemic events were balanced; 0.2% in the dapagliflozin (n=4) and placebo (n=4) group, 
respectively. One serious case in the placebo group and none in the dapagliflozin group. No subject 
discontinued due to any major hypoglycaemic event.  All patients with major hypoglycaemic events had 
T2DM at baseline.  
Based on the mechanism of action, it is not expected that dapagliflozin poses an unwarranted risk of 
hypoglycaemia in subjects without diabetes. Dapagliflozin acts insulin-independently and does not impair 
normal endogenous glucose production. Thus, the amount of glucose excreted into the urine is not 
considered sufficient to induce hypoglycaemia in normoglycemic subjects. Reassuringly, HbA1c was not 
reduced in non-diabetic subjects. 
Amputations 
The incidence of surgical amputations was overall low and balanced (0.5% vs 0.5%); however, slightly 
more subjects in the T2DM group (1.1% vs 0.8%) than in the non-T2DM group (0.1% vs 0.2%) 
experienced any amputation for dapagliflozin vs placebo. The event rate for dapagliflozin vs placebo was 
0.62 vs 0.43 amputation evets per 100 subject years in the total population and 1.31 and 0.77 
amputation events per 100 subject years in the T2DM subjects. The SmPC has been appropriately 
reworded . 
In the eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 group there was a higher incidence of amputations for dapagliflozin 
(0.4%) compared to placebo (0.2%); however, in the eGFR 60–45 mL/min/1.73 m2 the incidence was 
balanced (0.8% vs 0.7%) and in the eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 the incidence was higher in the placebo 
(1.4%) group relative dapagliflozin (0.8%). 
The number of patients with an AE related to risk for lower amputation was 6.5% for dapagliflozin and 
5.1% for placebo. All subjects in the dapagliflozin group (13/13) and most of the subjects in the placebo 
group (10/12) who experienced amputation/-s had preceding events, i.e. AEs related to risk for lower 
limb amputations.  Diabetic foot related conditions and vascular events/PAD were the most predominating 
reported preceding events and occurred equally frequent in the dapagliflozin group and placebo group. 
Fournier’s gangrene 
In total 6 cases with any SAE or DAE indicating genital area infections or necrotising fasciitis were 
identified; 3 (0.1%) in the dapagliflozin groups (1 anal abscess, 1 penile infection and 1 rectal abscess) 
and 3 (0.1%) in the placebo group (2 anal abscess and 1 Fournier’s gangrene). However, none of the 
events was confirmed by the Applicant as Fournier’s gangrene.

Laboratory findings/ vital signs 
In the DAPA-HF study, eGFR decreased over time in both the dapagliflozin and the placebo group. The 
change in eGFR was initially (within 2 weeks) more pronounced for dapagliflozin compared to placebo (-
6.5% vs -1.7%); however, the difference between dapagliflozin and placebo was less noticeable at month 
20 (-8.0% vs -7.0%) and onwards. 
In T2DM subjects, the glycaemic effect of dapagliflozin over time was modest (placebo-adjusted LS mean 
difference in HbA1c reduction of -0.2% to -0.3% during the study). However, this could be explained by 
the low mean baseline HbA1c (7.41%) for dapagliflozin and slightly higher use of antidiabetic drugs as 
concomitant medication in the placebo group. 
There was a decrease in mean body weight over time in the dapagliflozin group compared to placebo;  
-1.4% vs 0.1% at 16 months, -1.7% vs 0% at 20 months, -2.0% vs 0.2% at 24 months and -3.6% vs  
-0.2% at 28 months.  Weight loss over time was more pronounced in subjects with higher BMI at baseline 
(>35 and 30-35 kg/m2) compared with subjects with lower baseline BMI (25-30 and 20-25 kg/m2). The 
incidence of all-cause mortality was numerically lower in the dapagliflozin group compared with placebo; 
overall (11.6% vs 13.9%) and across BMI strata, including the subgroups with BMI >35 kg/m2 (11.6% vs 
15.1%) and 30-35 kg/m2 (9.4% vs 12.4%). Reassuringly, there is no indication that all-cause mortality 
was increased with weight loss in dapagliflozin-treated subjects. 
Subgroups 
Effect by age 
In the DAPA-HF study, 43% were ≤65 years of age, 36% were 66-75 years of age and 21% were >75 
years old. The study included 1,003 subjects >75 years of age, of which 516 were treated with 
dapagliflozin. Pre-specified sub-groups by age (≤65, >65 years) were analysed for the AEs suggestive of 
volume depletion, renal AEs and fractures. A slightly higher reporting rate was noted in the older age 
group; however, the safety profile for dapagliflozin did not differ in the older age group compared to the 
younger age group.  
Effect by sex 
Pre-specified sub-group analysis by sex was performed for fractures. The number of patients with 
fractures in the sub-group analysis by sex were in females 3.4% vs 2.2% and in males 1.7% vs 2.1%, for 
dapagliflozin vs placebo. 
Effect by baseline blood pressure 
Pre-specified sub-group analysis by systolic blood pressure at baseline (<130, ≥130 mmHg) was 
performed for AEs suggestive of volume depletion. The incidence of volume depletion was 8.3% vs 7.2% 
(SAEs: 1.2% vs 1.6%) in subjects <130 mmHg and 4.7% vs 4.7% (SAEs: 0.4% vs 1.6%) in subjects 
≥130 mmHg for dapagliflozin vs placebo. 
Effect by renal function 
The incidence of any SAE was higher in the eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 subgroup (48%) compared to the 
eGFR 60–45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (42%) and eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (34%) subgroups; the incidence was 
higher in the placebo group vs the dapagliflozin group in all subgroups. Overall, subjects with eGFR <45 
mL/min/1.73 m2 had a higher incidence of volume depletion, renal events and fractures compared to 
subjects with eGFR 60–45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/574301/2020 
Page 95/114 
  
  
 
 
 
 
There was no indication of a worsening of the safety profile with declining renal function apart from 
events of fractures (4.1% vs 2.8%) that were more common in subjects with eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 
treated with dapagliflozin than in those on placebo. The incidence of fractures was balanced in subjects 
with eGFR 60–45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2.  In this subgroup, no obvious 
differences between the treatment groups were identified with respect to subject characteristics, apart 
from more subjects with osteoporosis in the medical history in the dapagliflozin group (33%) compared 
with the placebo group (10%). 
Effect of T2DM 
The incidence of any SAE was higher in the T2DM subgroup (43%) compared to the non-diabetes 
subgroup (34%); however, the incidence was higher in the placebo group vs the dapagliflozin group in 
both subgroups.  
Apart from events suggestive of volume depletion, that were increased for dapagliflozin vs placebo in 
subjects without T2DM (7.0% vs 5.6%) and were balanced in subjects with T2DM (7.4% vs 7.5%), there 
was no difference in safety profile for subjects with and without T2DM.  
The incidence of UTI and fractures were balanced for dapagliflozin relative placebo in subjects with and 
without T2DM. Slightly more subjects in the T2DM group (balanced; 1.1% vs 0.8%) than in the non-
T2DM group (more events for placebo; 0.1% vs 0.2%) experienced any amputation. Subjects with T2DM 
had a higher frequency of renal events compared to subjects with non-diabetes; however, the incidence 
of renal events was higher in the placebo group in both subgroups.  
There were no events of genital infections, major hypoglycaemic events or DKA in the non-T2DM group. 
Effect of NYHA class 
Due to the limited number of subjects with NYHA IV (n=43) included in the study, no conclusions could 
be drawn regarding safety in this subgroup. The safety profile for dapagliflozin, with regards to SAEs, 
volume depletion renal events and fractures, was similar in the NYHA II and NYHA III subgroups, and in 
line with to the overall population (Table 37). The incidence of SAEs was lower with dapagliflozin 
compared with placebo in subjects with NYHA II and was more balanced between the groups in subjects 
with NYHA III. In the NYHA II and NYHA III groups, adverse events suggestive of volume depletion 
occurred with a slightly higher incidence for dapagliflozin relative placebo while renal events were 
somewhat less frequent with dapagliflozin than with placebo. The rate of fractures was balanced in the 
subgroup with NYHA II and slightly imbalance in the NYHA III group (favouring placebo).

 Conclusions on clinical safety 
The DAPA-HF study provides information on the safety profile of dapagliflozin in subjects with heart 
failure and reduced ejection fraction. No new safety concerns arise from the provided data.  
The overall safety profile for dapagliflozin in the DAPA-HF study was similar compared with previously 
identified adverse drug reactions. The safety profile with regards to SAEs did not differ in any substantial 
way between patients with diabetes and the new target population, i.e. non-diabetic patients. Based on 
the mechanism of action, it is not expected that dapagliflozin poses an unwarranted risk of 
hypoglycaemia in subjects without diabetes. Reassuringly, HbA1c was not reduced in non-diabetic 
subjects. 
In T2DM subjects, there was a numerical imbalance in subjects suffering amputation between the 
dapagliflozin and the placebo group (1.1% (n=12) vs 0.8% (n=9)). Furthermore, the number of patients 
undergoing more than one amputation was higher for dapagliflozin compared with placebo (6 vs 3) with 
an event rate of 1.31 vs. 0.77 amputation events per 100 subject years for dapagliflozin vs placebo. The 
numerical imbalances together with the assumption of a class effect should be reflected in the SmPC. 
Rewording of the SmPC is considered appropriate.  
In the overall population and in the additional subgroup analyses on baseline diabetes status and renal 
function, the number of SAEs was lower in the dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group.  
The incidence of SAEs and renal events was higher in subjects with T2DM compared to subjects without 
T2DM; however, the safety profiles did not differ in the subgroups. The glycaemic effect of dapagliflozin 
over time was modest. This might be explained by the low mean baseline HbA1c for dapagliflozin and 
slightly higher use of antidiabetic drugs as concomitant medication in the placebo group. 
The incidence of SAEs, events of volume depletion, renal events and fractures increased with decreasing 
baseline eGFR. However, there was no indication of a worsening of the safety profile with declining renal 
function apart from events of fractures that were more common in subjects with eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 
m2 treated with dapagliflozin than in those on placebo.  In this subgroup, no obvious differences between 
the treatment groups were identified with regards to subject characteristics, apart from more subjects 
with osteoporosis in the medical history in the dapagliflozin group (33%) compared with the placebo 
group (10%).  
There was a decrease in mean body weight over time in the dapagliflozin group compared to placebo.  
Weight loss over time was more pronounced in subjects with higher BMI at baseline (>35 and 30-35 
kg/m2) compared with subjects with lower baseline BMI (25-30 and 20-25 kg/m2). However, the 
incidence of all-cause mortality was numerically lower in the dapagliflozin group compared with placebo; 
overall and across BMI strata. Reassuringly, there is no indication that all-cause mortality was increased 
with weight loss in dapagliflozin-treated subjects. 
Only a limited number of subjects with NYHA IV (n=43) were included in the study, which did not allow to 
draw  conclusions regarding the safety profile specifically in this subgroup.  Use in patients with NYHA

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
 Disease or condition and available therapies/unmet need 
The prevalence of heart failure (HF) is estimated at 1% to 2% in the Western world. The core symptoms 
of HF include shortness of breath, fatigue, and peripheral oedema and hospitalisations due to 
decompensations are frequently occurring. Current standard of care includes renin-angiotensin system 
(RAS) blockade, Beta blockade, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) (if deemed appropriate). 
In addition to these therapies, diuretics are used to reduce symptoms from fluid overload and cardiac 
glycosides improve hospitalisation rate and provide symptomatic relief. More recently, neprilysin inhibition 
(in conjunction with RAS blockade) has been approved as a treatment option. Despite these treatments, 
mortality rates in patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) remain high. 
Dapagliflozin is a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, previously approved for the 
treatment of patients with T1DM or T2DM. In the current variation, the MAH is applying for a new 
indication (X is indicated in adults for the treatment of symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction) based on the results of one pivotal phase III study; D1699C00001, hereafter referred to as 
DAPA-HF.

EMA/574301/2020

 Main clinical study 
DAPA-HF was a global, event-driven, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study 
conducted at 410 sites across 20 countries including 4744 randomised patients. It was designed to 
evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg, compared with placebo, on the primary composite endpoint of 
CV death or HF events, when added to background standard of care, in patients with HFrEF in NYHA class 
II-IV, with T2DM or without diabetes. 
Secondary variables included  time to first occurrence of either component of the primary endpoint; total 
number of (first and recurrent) HF hospitalisations and CV death; change from baseline, measured at 8 
months, in the total symptom score (TSS) of the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ); 
time to first occurrence of any component of the composite ≥50% sustained decline in estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), end stage renal disease, or renal death; and time to death from any 
cause.  
The study was event-driven; 844 primary composite endpoint events were required to have 90% power 
to demonstrate superiority of dapagliflozin to placebo assuming a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.80. 
The study aimed to include patients with HFrEF, NYHA II- IV that were optimally treated according to 
guidelines and that did not have hypotension or recent worsening of the condition. Patients with eGFR 
<30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were excluded. 
The mean age of the study population was 66 years and the majority (77%) of the subjects were male. 
Almost 50% of the subjects were recruited in Europe. 67.5% / 31.6% of patients had NYHA class II / III at 
baseline respectively, while a very small proportion were in class IV (n=43, 1% of study population). Median 
LVEF was 32%, aetiology of heart failure was ischemic in 56.4%, non-ischemic in 35.6% and unknown in 
8.1% of cases. Twenty-four percent of the patients had atrial fibrillation and  42 % of the subjects had type 
2 diabetes. Patients with type 1 diabetes were not included in the trial. The treatment groups were well 
balanced for all these characteristics. The vast majority of patients were treated with ACEi/ARB/ARNI and 
beta blocker in line with the inclusion criteria. In addition, 71% were on MRA and 93% were treated with 
diuretics.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of the composite of CV death or a HF 
event (hospitalisation for heart failure or urgent heart failure related visit) with a 26% relative risk 
reduction (95% CI 15% to 35%), p<0.0001. All three components of the primary endpoint contributed to 
the effect; HR for CV death 0.82 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.98); HR for hospitalisation for HF and urgent HF visits 
0.70 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.83).  The event rate of primary endpoint events was 11.6 in the dapagliflozin 
treatment group and 15.6 in the placebo group. The major cause of death was cardiovascular. When 
adding deaths from other causes, the difference in favour of dapagliflozin was preserved. 
Treatment with dapagliflozin was superior to placebo in reducing the total numbers of events in the 
composite of CV death or recurrent HF hospitalisation/urgent HF visits. There were 567 and 742 events of 
CV death or hospitalisation for HF/ urgent HF visits in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, 
corresponding to event rates per 100 patient-years of 16.3 and 21.6, respectively (p= 0.0002).  
For the evaluation of the KCCQ questionnaire, the MAH investigated the clinically meaningful levels of 
individual change from baseline at 8 months in KCCQ-TSS. A clinically relevant improvement or 
deterioration in KCCQ-TSS was defined as a change from baseline of ≥5 points. The difference in

responders based on this cut off (as well as for the 10 and 15% improvement cut off) compared to 
placebo was of statistical significance. 
In the pre specified subgroups (age, sex, race, geographical region, NYHA class, LVEF, NTproBNP, prior 
hospitalisation, MRA use, diabetes status, AF, aetiology, BMI, eGFR) the effect in most of the groups was 
consistent with the one in the overall population. Subgroup analyses supported that neither diabetic 
status nor BMI influenced the results. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The MAH has not submitted any results from studies supporting the mechanism of action of dapagliflozin 
in patients with heart failure (HF), but only a discussion based on published references. The most 
plausible relevant mechanism in patients with HF is the known propensity of dapagliflozin to induce 
osmotic diuresis. In the CHMP advice given in 2016, it was expected that the results of the pivotal would 
be supported by adequate data to elucidate the mechanism of action. The MAH has referred to published 
data discussing the mechanism of action in relation to treatment of heart failure. The MAH´s 
interpretation of these results is that dapagliflozin inhibits SGLT2 in the proximal tubules of the kidneys, 
leading to glucosuria and increased sodium delivery to more distal parts of the nephron, which leads to 
restored tubuloglomerular feedback, and osmotic diuresis. This leads to a decrease in volume overload, 
and reduced blood pressure, reducing preload and afterload of the heart. This off-loading of the left 
ventricle leads to beneficial effects on cardiac remodelling, which leads to improved diastolic parameters. 
No imaging data or information on cardiac function was submitted and echo data from the public domain 
were not considered meaningful. An echocardiographic substudy was included in Dapa HF but, data were 
insufficient to draw any conclusions.  This issue is not further pursued in this procedure. 
There were no significant differences in the incidence of the composite of ≥50% sustained decline in 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), end stage renal disease, or renal death; or death from any 
cause, but the cases were few.  
The effect did not seem to be influenced by eGFR at baseline, but patients with eGFR <30 was excluded 
from the study. Provided analyses do not indicate a risk of reduced effect based in patients with lower 
eGFR, but the fact that the experience is very limited is reflected in the SmPC. 
In the subgroup analyses, the result of the primary endpoint was less convincing in patients with severe 
heart failure i.e. patients in NYHA class III-IV and patients with higher baseline NT-proBNP levels 
compared to the total study population. In particular, the estimate for CV death was above 1 (HR 1.09, 
95%CI 0.85-1.41) compared to 0.82 (95%CI 0.69-0.98) in the total population. The MAH has carefully 
analysed the data, without finding a credible explanation to this finding. These findings are not supported 
by a biological rationale, and not consistently found when other disease severity markers (LVEF, NT-
proBNP, MAGGIC score and KCCQ-TSS) are used. 
The number of patients with NYHA class IV was very limited (only 1% of the study population). 
Information has been included in the SmPC.  
No specific reason was detected for the lower efficacy in the European population that was mainly due to 
a lack of efficacy on the CV mortality component. Some factors at least numerically associated with a 
lower efficacy were more frequently present in the European population: NYHA class distribution was less

favourable in European patients than overall, atrial fibrillation and ischaemic aetiology were more 
common. Possibly the lower efficacy observed in the European patients was related to the higher 
representation of these subgroups where efficacy was at least numerically lower. 
There is uncertainty with respect to patients with chronic heart failure and T1DM. These patients were not 
included in the study and no data on efficacy in the heart failure indication are available. For the 
treatment of T1DM, dapagliflozin is also approved (add on insulin, BMI >= 27 kg/m2) but at a lower 
recommended dose of 5 mg once daily. In the absence of data on efficacy and safety at the 10 mg once 
daily dose, B/R cannot be considered positive in this population. Treatment of these patients is not 
recommended, therefore. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In total in the HF-study, 2,368 subjects were treated with dapagliflozin for a total exposure of 3,310 PY, 
with 1,955 subjects (83%) for at least 52 weeks and 1,168 subjects (49%) for at least 1,5 years and 261 
subjects (11%) for at least 2 years. The median duration of exposure was 17.8 and 17.6 months for 
dapagliflozin and placebo, respectively. The median duration of follow-up was 18.2 months. 
The number of SAEs was lower in the dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group. The most frequently 
reported SAEs for dapagliflozin vs placebo were cardiac failure (10% vs 14%), pneumonia (3.0% vs 
3.1%), cardiac failure congestive (2.4% vs 2.7%) and cardiac failure acute (1.5% vs 2.2%). 
The incidence of SAEs of urinary tract infections (0.6% vs 0.7%) and events of UTI leading to 
discontinuation (0.2% vs 0.2%) were low and balanced. There were 4 SAEs of pyelonephritis; 3 cases in 
the dapagliflozin group.   
Only 1 SAE of genital infections (placebo group) was reported. Seven patients (0.3%), all in the 
dapagliflozin treatment group, had an event of genital infection leading to discontinuation.  
Events of volume depletion was reported slightly more frequently with dapagliflozin (7.2%) than with 
placebo (6.5%). However, there were fewer patients with SAEs in the dapagliflozin treatment group 
(1.0%) compared with the placebo group (1.6%). 
Renal events occurred slightly more frequently in the placebo group (6.7%) than in the dapagliflozin 
group (6.0%). The incidence of SAEs of renal events were also higher in the placebo relative the 
dapagliflozin group. 
The incidence of fractures was balanced between the dapagliflozin and placebo group in the overall 
population (2.1% respectively). 
In total 5 subjects had an event adjudicated as an DKA, all in the dapagliflozin group; 3 events were 
adjudicated as a definite DKA (all serious of which one fatal outcome) and 2 events as a possible DKA 
(both non-serious). All subjects had T2DM and were treated with anti-diabetic medication of which 4 
subjects were on concomitant insulin treatment.  
In the DAPA-HF study only major hypoglycaemic events were collected. Subjects with major 
hypoglycaemic events were balanced; 0.2% in the dapagliflozin (n=4) and placebo (n=4) group, 
respectively. One serious case in the placebo group and none in the dapagliflozin group. No subject 
discontinued due to any major hypoglycaemic event.  All patients with major hypoglycaemic events had 
T2DM at baseline. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/574301/2020 
Page 106/114 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The incidence of surgical amputations was overall low and balanced (0.5% vs 0.5%); however, slightly 
more subjects in the T2DM group (1.1% vs 0.8%) than in the non-T2DM group (0.1% vs 0.2%) 
experienced any amputation for dapagliflozin vs placebo. The event rate for dapagliflozin vs placebo was 
0.62 vs 0.43 amputation evets per 100 subject years in the total population and 1.31 and 0.77 
amputation events per 100 subject years in the T2DM subjects. Rewording of the SmPC is considered 
appropriate. 
Laboratory findings/ vital signs 
In the DAPA-HF study, eGFR decreased over time in both the dapagliflozin and the placebo group. The 
change in eGFR was initially (within 2 weeks) more pronounced for dapagliflozin compared to placebo  
(-6.5% vs -1.7%); however, the difference between dapagliflozin and placebo was less noticeable at 
month 20 (-8.0% vs -7.0%) and onwards. 
There was a decrease in mean body weight over time in the dapagliflozin group compared to placebo;  
-1.7% vs 0% at 20 months and -3.6% vs -0.2% at 28 months.  Weight loss over time was more 
pronounced in subjects with higher BMI at baseline (>35 and 30-35 kg/m2) compared with subjects with 
lower baseline BMI (25-30 and 20-25 kg/m2). However, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 
numerically lower in the dapagliflozin group compared with placebo; overall and across BMI strata. 
Reassuringly, there is no indication that all-cause mortality was increased with weight loss in 
dapagliflozin-treated subjects. 
Subgroups 
Pre-specified sub-groups by age (≤65, >65 years) were analysed for the AEs suggestive of volume 
depletion, renal AEs and fractures. A slightly higher reporting rate was noted in the older age group; 
however, the safety profile for dapagliflozin did not differ in the older age group compared to the younger 
age group.  
Overall, subjects with eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 had a higher incidence of volume depletion, renal 
events and fractures compared to subjects with eGFR 60–45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and eGFR ≥60 
mL/min/1.73 m2. There was no indication of a worsening of the safety profile with declining renal function 
apart from events of fractures that were more common in subjects with eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 
treated with dapagliflozin (4.1%) than in those on placebo (2.8%). No obvious differences between the 
treatment groups were identified with regards to subject characteristics in this subgroup, apart from more 
subjects with osteoporosis in the medical history in the dapagliflozin group (33%) compared with the 
placebo group (10%). 
The incidence of any SAE was higher in the T2DM subgroup (43%) compared to the non-diabetes 
subgroup (34%); however, the incidence was higher in the placebo group vs the dapagliflozin group in 
both subgroups. There was no difference in safety profile for subjects with and without T2DM apart from 
events suggestive of volume depletion that were increased for dapagliflozin vs placebo in subjects without 
T2DM (7.0% vs 5.6%) and were balanced in subjects with T2DM (7.4% vs 7.5%). In diabetic subjects, 
the glycaemic effect of dapagliflozin over time was modest (placebo-adjusted LS mean difference in 
HbA1c reduction of -0.2% to -0.3% during the study). However, this could be explained by the low mean 
baseline HbA1c (7.41%) for dapagliflozin and slightly higher use of antidiabetic drugs as concomitant 
medication in the placebo group. 
The incidence of SAEs was lower with dapagliflozin compared with placebo in subjects with NYHA II (31% 
vs 37%) and was more balanced between the groups in subjects with NYHA III (45% vs 46%). Adverse 
events suggestive of volume depletion occurred with a slightly higher incidence for dapagliflozin relative 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/574301/2020 
Page 107/114 
  
  
 
 
 
 
placebo (7.1% vs 6.6% and 7.4% vs 6.3% for NYHA II and NYHA III, respectively) while renal events 
were somewhat less frequent with dapagliflozin than with placebo for NYHA II (5.4% vs 6.2%) and NYHA 
III (7.0% vs 7.9%). The rate of fractures was low (≤2%) and balanced in the subgroup with NYHA II and 
slightly imbalance in the NYHA III group (favouring placebo). Due to the limited number of subjects with 
NYHA IV included in the study (n=43), no conclusions could be drawn regarding safety in this subgroup. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The data collection in this study focused on serious AEs and AEs of special interest.  The safety profile 
with regards to SAEs did not differ in any substantial way between patients with diabetes and the new 
target population, i.e. non-diabetic patients. Based on the mechanism of action, it is not expected that 
dapagliflozin poses an unwarranted risk of hypoglycaemia in subjects without diabetes. Dapagliflozin acts 
insulin-independently and does not impair normal endogenous glucose production. Thus, the amount of 
glucose excreted into the urine is not considered sufficient to induce hypoglycaemia in normoglycemic 
subjects. Reassuringly, HbA1c was not reduced in non-diabetic subjects. 
The incidence of SAEs and renal events was higher in subjects with T2DM compared to subjects without 
T2DM and in subjects with NYHA II compared with NYHA III; however, the safety profile for dapagliflozin 
within the subgroups, respectively, was in line with the overall population. No conclusions could be drawn 
regarding safety in the NYHA IV subgroup due to the limited number of subjects. 
In T2DM subjects, there was a numerical imbalance in subjects suffering amputation between the 
dapagliflozin and the placebo group (1.1% (n=12) vs 0.8% (n=9)). Furthermore, the number of patients 
undergoing more than one amputation was higher for dapagliflozin compared with placebo (6 vs 3) with 
an event rate of 1.31 vs. 0.77 amputation events per 100 subject years for dapagliflozin vs placebo. The 
numerical imbalances together with the assumption of a class effect are reflected in the SmPC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
 Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Despite the availability of a number of treatments for patients with HFrEF, morbidity and mortality are 
high and new treatment options are welcomed. Dapagliflozin reduced the incidence of CV death and HF 
worsening with 26% compared to placebo in a population with HFrEF on adequate background treatment

in line with current treatment recommendations. Use of ARNIs increased to some degree during the 
course of the study, but otherwise HF medication did not change much and patients in the placebo group 
had a relevant treatment with 94 % being treated with diuretics. Thus, it is likely that a reduced incidence 
of the primary variable could have been achieved in the placebo group with increased use of diuretics or 
other HF treatments.  
The pivotal study is considered to be of adequate design and conduct and the results with respect to 
reduced risk of CV death and worsening of HF are considered as robust and of clinical relevance. 
 The effect was consistent in subgroups such as patients with and without type 2 diabetes. However, 
analyses in patients with severe heart failure (NYHA III- IV) indicate a lower effect compared to patients 
with NYHA II. Actually, the incidence of all cause and CV death was higher in patients treated with 
dapagliflozin compared to placebo. The MAH has carefully analysed the data, without finding any credible 
explanation to this finding. These findings are not supported by a biological rationale, and not consistently 
found when other disease severity markers (LVEF, NT-proBNP, MAGGIC score and KCCQ-TSS) are used.  
Further, an increased risk of mortality is not supported by other safety findings in the DAPA HF study. 
In addition, data in this subgroup support a positive effect on reducing hospitalisations for HF which is 
indeed a clinically relevant outcome. Therefore, a benefit of treatment is expected also in patients with 
more severe heart failure.   
Data collection in this study focused on serious AEs and AEs of special interest. No new safety concerns 
arise from the data provided. In the overall population and in the additional subgroup analyses on 
baseline diabetes status, renal function and NYHA class, the number of SAEs was lower in the 
dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group. The incidence of SAEs and renal events was higher in 
subjects with T2DM compared to subjects without T2DM and in subjects with NYHA II compared with 
NYHA III . However, the safety profile for dapagliflozin within the subgroups, respectively, was in line with 
the overall population, though no conclusions could be drawn regarding safety specifically in the NYHA IV 
subgroup due to the limited number of subjects. Use in patients with NYHA class IV has been included as 
missing information in the RMP, as requested by the CHMP.  
In conclusion, the safety profile in patients with HF seems to be rather similar to the one previously 
documented in patients with diabetes and does not differ in any substantial way between patients with 
and without diabetes or between patients with moderate (NYHA II) and severe heart failure (NYHA III). 
Dapagliflozin acts insulin-independently and does not impair normal endogenous glucose production. 
Thus, the amount of glucose excreted into the urine is not considered sufficient to induce hypoglycaemia 
in normoglycemic subjects. Reassuringly, HbA1c was not reduced in non-diabetic subjects. However, it 
should be remembered that the safety profile of dapagliflozin is not innocuous; e.g. there is an increased 
risk of DKA (confirmed also in the current study), lower limb amputation and initial decline of eGFR. 
 Balance of benefits and risks 
The documented benefits in the study population included in the DAPA HF trial are considered to be of 
clinical relevance and to outweigh risks. With respect to patients with NYHA III-IV, a somewhat less 
pronounced effect was observed. However, the totality of data do not support that the observation of an 
increased risk of mortality in patients with more severe HF is a finding considered robust enough to 
exclude this subgroup. In addition, data support a positive effect on reducing hospitalisations for HF 
which is indeed a clinically relevant outcome. Since the safety profile is considered similar irrespective of 
NYHA class, this benefit outweighs the uncertainty regarding risk in patients with more severe HF.

 Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The vast majority of the study population in the pivotal study was treated with standard background 
therapy according to treatment guidelines. The MAH was requested to discuss the adequacy of restricting 
the indication to patients on standard therapy. The MAH did not find this adequate considering that the 
data of DAPA-HF support a positive treatment effect of dapagliflozin that is independent of which 
background HF treatment a patient receives and that the observation that neither of these agents 
modified the response to dapagliflozin supports the view that SGLT2 inhibition acts in a mechanistically 
independent and complementary way to other therapies for HFrEF. 
The argumentation is not fully agreed with; a statement in section 4.1 that dapagliflozin is an add-on 
treatment does not contradict the specific mechanism of dapagliflozin. However, it can be agreed that the 
aim of the DAPA-HF was not to study a specific combination. Thus, other medications can be seen as 
“background therapy” rather than “combination therapy” and may therefore not necessarily be included in 
section 4.1. Further, other recently approved heart failure treatments have information about background 
treatment in section 4.2 and not in section 4.1.. Thus, the proposed indication has been accepted by the 
CHMP considering the updated text in 4.2 (In the DAPA-HF study, dapagliflozin was administered in 
conjunction with other heart failure therapies (see section 5.1). 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The benefit/risk balance is positive.

assessment report of the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to 
the authorisation, after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. 
Should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains commercially confidential 
information, please provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of 
commercially confidential information (CCI) in “track changes” and with detailed justification by 
30 October 2020. The principles to be applied for the deletion of CCI are published on the EMA 
website at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/heads-medicines-agencies/european-
medicines-agency-guidance-document-identification-commercially-confidential-information_en.pdf. 
In addition, should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains personal data, please 
provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of these data in “track changes” and 
with detailed justification by 30 October 2020. We would like to remind you that, according to 
Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, “GDPR”) ‘personal 
data’ means any information, relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (the ‘data 
subject’). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in 
particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an 
online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, 
economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. 
It is important to clarify that pseudonymised data are also considered personal data. According to 
Article 4(5) of GDPR pseudonymisation means that personal data is processed in a manner that the 
personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional 
information (e.g. key-coded data).  
Accordingly, the name and the patient identification number are two examples of personal data 
which may relate to an identified or identifiable natural person. The definitions also encompass for 
instance: office e-mail address or phone number of a company, data concerning health, e.g. 
information in medical records, clinical reports or case narratives which relates to an identifiable 
individual.”

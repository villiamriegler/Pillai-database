Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update 
16/03/2023 
SmPC 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC is updated to include a brief 
efficacy information upon the request by the CHMP 
following the outcome of P46/026 based on final 
description of the exploratory PTC124-GD-045-DMD aiming 
to explore quantitative levels of dystrophin in muscle tissue 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

results from study PTC124-GD-045-DMD (Study 
045); this is an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 
study designed to evaluate the ability of ataluren 
treatment to increase dystrophin protein levels in 
muscle cells of subjects with nonsense mutation 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (nmDMD).

assessment done under A 45/46 - Change(s) with 
new additional data submitted by the MAH 
before and after 40 weeks of treatment with ataluren in 20 
subjects with nmDMD aged 2-7 years. The baseline median 
dystrophin level as measured by electrochemiluminescence 
assay was 0.42% of normal (range 0.00% to 41.85%). At 
the end of the study, the median dystrophin level was 
0.33% of normal (range 0.04% to 48.55%). For 
immunohistochemistry assay, the median percentage of 
positive fibres at baseline was 73% (range 0.42% to 
99.6%). At the end of the study, the median percentage of 
positive fibres was 66% (range 0.51% to 99.77%). At the 
end of the study, the mean (median) worsening from 
baseline on the rNSAA was 0.1 (1.0) points in total score 
and the mean (median) change from baseline for the time 
to stand, to run or walk 10 meters, climb 4 stairs, and 
descend 4 stairs was -1.56 (-0.6), -0.41 (-0.35), -1.09 (-
0.5), and -2.43 (-0.7) seconds, respectively.

moderate renal impairment. Treatment of patients with 
severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min) or end-stage 
renal disease is not recommended. 
An increase in ataluren exposure and in ataluren metabolite 
has been reported in patients with severe renal impairment 
(eGFR <30 ml/min). The toxicity of the metabolite is 
unknown. Higher ataluren exposure was associated with 
potential decrease in efficacy. Therefore, patients with 
severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease should 
be treated with ataluren only if the anticipated clinical 
benefit outweighs the potential risk, and should be closely 
monitored for possible metabolite toxicity and decrease in 
efficacy. A lower ataluren dose should be considered. 
Treatment should not be initiated in previously untreated 
patients with eGFR <30 ml/min.

the treatment of ambulant patients with nmDMD aged 5 
years or older, the MAH should conduct and submit the

co-administration of ataluren with substrates of 
UGT1A9 and to add results from studies PTC124-GD-

The efficacy and safety of Translarna were assessed in 2 
in order to reflect the results from the submitted 
study TC124-GD-020-DMD object of the specific 
obligation (SOB 001) for the conditional marketing 
authorisation. The Package Leaflet and the RMP are 
updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to 
include some minor editorial changes throughout the 
Product information.

randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, trials in 
nmDMD. The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was 
change in 6 Minute Walk Distance (6MWD) at Week 48. 
Other endpoints included in both trials were time to 
persistent 10% worsening in 6MWD, change in time to 
run/walk 10 meters at Week 48, change in time to climb 4 
stairs at Week 48, and change in time to descend 4 stairs 
at Week 48. 
Study 2 evaluated 230 male patients, ages 7 to 14 years. 
Ataluren-treated patients experienced clinical benefit as 
measured by numerically favorable differences versus 
placebo across the primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints. As the primary endpoint (change in 6MWD from 
baseline to Week 48) did not reach statistical significance 
(p≤0.05), all other p values should be considered nominal. 
Separation between ataluren and placebo was maintained 
from Week 16 through the end of the study.   
The most common adverse reactions in the 2 placebo-
controlled studies were vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea, 
headache, upper abdominal pain, and flatulence, all 
occurring in ≥5% of all ataluren-treated patients. Lipid 
levels shifted from normal at baseline to high (above the 
upper limit of normal) at Week 48 in slightly higher 
percentages of patients receiving ataluren compared to 
those receiving placebo (total cholesterol 15.1% vs. 6.1%, 
Page 17/22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
triglycerides 21.1% vs. 13.4%, respectively). In both 
studies, 1/232 (0.43%) patients treated with ataluren 
discontinued due to an adverse reaction of constipation and 
1/172 (0.58%) placebo patients discontinued treatment 
due to an adverse reaction of disease progression (loss of 
ambulation). Adverse reactions were generally mild or 
moderate in severity, and no treatment-related serious 
adverse events were reported among ataluren-treated 
patients in these 2 studies.

The CHMP, having reviewed the available information on 
the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations and 
having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, is of the 
opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this 
medicinal product continue to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore recommends the 
renewal of the conditional MA for Translarna, subject to the 
Specific Obligations and Conditions as laid down in Annex II 
to the Opinion.

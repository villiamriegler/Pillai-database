methods) prior to starting therapy with this combination 
drug regimen. EVRA can be restarted 2 weeks following

section 4.3 “Contraindications” of the SPC. Evra is 
contraindicated in patients with severe hypertension, i.e. 
with persistent blood pressure values equal or greater of 
160 mm Hg for the systolic or equal or greater than 100 
mm Hg for the diastolic.   
Following literature reports referring to a clinical trial as 
well as the search of the safety database of the MAH, the 
information of interaction of the combined contraceptives 
and lamotrigine has been added in section 4.5 “Interactions 
with Other Medicinal Products and Other Forms of 
Interaction” of the SPC. Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant 
agent. Combined hormonal contraceptives have been 
shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of 
lamotrigine when co-administered. This may reduce seizure 
control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may

In addition the Adverse Drug Reaction of “colitis” is added 
in the section 4.8 of the SPC based on data from the 
literature and class effect consistent with an ADR in

of any combined hormonal contraceptive, including EVRA, 
compared to no use as recommended by the PhVWP and 
the CHMP. The results of the retrospective cohort analysis 
suggest, that the incidence rates for overall VTE risk in 
women who use EVRA are slightly increased in comparison 
with users of a levonorgestrel-containing Oral 
Contraceptives. 
Section 4.8 ‘Undesirable effects’ was also restructured in 
accordance to the SPC Guideline. In addition, following the 
assessment of published data, Section 4.5 ‘Interaction with 
other medicinal products and other forms of interaction’ 
was amended to include the active substance ‘bosentan’ as

approval of this product. The benefit/risk profile of EVRA 
remains favourable in the indication for female 
contraception. 
The CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance of EVRA 
remains positive, but that its safety profile is to be closely 
monitored in particular with regards to the Thromboembolic 
events.  
Based upon the above defined safety issues of EVRA, the 
CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to submit 
yearly PSURs. 
Finally, considering the above, the CHMP concluded that 
the MAH should submit one additional renewal application 
in 5 years time.

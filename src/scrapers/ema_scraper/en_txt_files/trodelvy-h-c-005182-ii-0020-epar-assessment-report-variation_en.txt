2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The proposed indication for Trodelvy was “as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2)-negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH–) breast cancer who have received endocrine-based 
therapy and at least two additional systemic therapies in the metastatic setting (see section 5.1).” 
Following recommendation by the CHMP the recommended indication is:  
“Trodelvy as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or 
metastatic hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who have received 
Assessment report  
EMA/319185/2023  
Page 8/163 
 
 
 
 
 
 
endocrine-based therapy, and at least two additional systemic therapies in the advanced setting (see 
section 5.1)”. 
Epidemiology  
The most commonly diagnosed cancer is breast cancer, accounting for 11.7% of all cancer diagnoses. 
There were approximately 530,000 new cases of breast cancer and 140,000 deaths reported in the EU 
in 2020 (Dyba 2021). HR+/HER2− breast cancer (BC) is the most common breast cancer subtype, 
representing approximately 70% of all new cases (Howlader 2014). The median age at diagnosis of 
HR+/HER2− breast cancer is 61 years (range: 51-70 years), which is older than all other subtypes 
(Kong 2020). Incidence of HR+/HER2− mBC increases with age, especially after 65 years, and 
prognosis is worse in older age groups (National Cancer Institute 2021). 
Biologic features 
HR+/HER2− breast cancer is characterized by hormone receptor positivity (> 1% IHC expression of 
the estrogen receptor [ER] and/or progesterone receptor [PR]) and lack of HER2 expression (IHC score 
of 0, 1+, or 2+ confirmed as negative by fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]) (Allison 2020, Wolff 
2018)). 
In early stages, HR+/HER2− breast cancer is less aggressive than other breast cancer subtypes; 
however, once it has progressed to metastatic disease, it becomes more aggressive and treatment 
resistant with higher tumor grade and change in biomarker status after treatment progression 
(American Cancer Society 2019, Dunnwald 2007, Grinda 2021). 
High expression of Trop-2 protein in breast cancers, including the HR+/HER2− subtype, has been 
shown by polyclonal IHC testing (Ambrogi 2014). Monoclonal antibody data showed high (> 90%) 
expression of Trop 2 protein in TNBC linked with tumor progression and poor prognosis (Bardia 2021), 
and a recent study showed that TROP2 gene expression is high and appears similar across all breast 
cancer subtypes (Vidula 2017). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The majority of patients with advanced HR+ breast cancer will have a history of early-stage breast 
cancer, with just a minority of patients presenting with advanced disease de novo. The most frequent 
initial site of metastases in patients with HR+/HER2− breast cancer is bone (77.6%), but this breast 
cancer subtype is also associated with metastases to visceral sites, including lung (28.5%), liver 
(20.6%), and brain (5.8%), which are related to even poorer prognosis (Bertho 2021, Li 2021, Lobbezoo 
2013). In Stage IV (metastatic disease), HR+/HER2− has the second worst prognosis after metastatic 
TNBC with a 5-year survival rate of 30% (National Cancer Institute 2021). 
Management 
Endocrine therapy combined with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor is the current standard of care for patients with 
newly diagnosed HR+/HER2− mBC.Subsequent treatment options for patients with HR+/HER2− 
metastatic breast cancer after progression on endocrine therapy and a CDK 4/6 inhibitor include 
sequential endocrine therapy with an alternative endocrine regimen as a single agent or in combination 
with targeted agents including mTOR inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors, depending on PI3K mutation status 
(Cardoso 2020, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 2022). 
Assessment report  
EMA/319185/2023  
Page 9/163 
 
 
 
In a subset of patients (< 10%) with HR+/HER2− mBC and BRCA1/2 mutations, PARP inhibitor 
monotherapy may be a suitable treatment option after progression on endocrine therapies (Gennari 
2021, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 2022, O'Shaughnessy 2020). 
Treatment options for endocrine resistant/refractory disease include single-agent chemotherapy such 
as anthracyclines, taxanes, antimetabolites, and microtubule inhibitors (Cardoso 2020, National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 2022). Combination chemotherapy may be used in patients with 
more advanced disease or a high disease burden; however, a superior OS benefit was not shown and it 
is generally more toxic (Dear 2013, Gennari 2021). 
Efficacy in patients with HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer treated with chemotherapy in the 
metastatic setting is limited. Objective response rates (ORRs) ranged from 14% to 32% in patients 
treated with single-agent chemotherapy, including eribulin, capecitabine, vinorelbine, paclitaxel, or 
gemcitabine (Paclitaxel Summary of product characteristics, Rha 2005, Twelves 2014, Yuan 2019). Reported 
PFS ranges from 4 to 5 months (Twelves 2016, Twelves 2014, Yuan 2019). Similar to PFS, reported median 
OS is low following treatment with single agent gemcitabine (6.4 months), capecitabine (9.1 months), 
or eribulin (11 months) (Kazmi 2020). Many of these studies were conducted before the CDK 4/6 
inhibitor class of drug was available to patients. As patients progress following each successive 
treatment, the efficacy of subsequent treatments decreases (Park 2015, Planchat 2011). Moreover, 
treatments increasingly have a negative impact upon HRQOL (Davie 2020, Wood 2017, De Laurentiis 2018). 
The recent Phase 3 DESTINY-Breast04 study compared the anti-drug conjugate (ADC) trastuzumab 
deruxtecan with chemotherapy of physician’s choice in a new population of patients with 
metastatic/unresectable breast cancer and low HER2 expression (defined as an IHC score of 1+ or 2+/ 
ISH−) (Modi 2022b). Patients had received 1 to 2 prior lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting 
and 70% had received prior treatment with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor. In the HR+ cohort, treatment with 
trastuzumab deruxtecan resulted in statistically significant improvements in PFS (10.1 months vs 5.4 
months; HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.64; P < 0.001) and OS (23.9 months vs 17.5 months; HR: 0.64; 
95% CI: 0.48, 0.86; P = 0.003) compared with chemotherapy.  
Based on results reported with ADC in breast cancer, the future standard of care for a number of 
breast cancer subtypes may include treatment with ADCs with differing targets such as trastuzumab 
deruxtecan (targeting HER2) and SG (targeting Trop 2).  
In summary, given the poor outcomes (limited effectiveness and poor tolerability) and limited 
remaining treatment options available, there remains a high unmet need for patients with HR+/HER2− 
metastatic breast cancer who have received prior endocrine therapy and chemotherapy for locally 
advanced or metastatic disease. Prolonging OS, improving efficacy, and maintaining or improving 
quality of life (QOL) with manageable toxicities continues to represent an area of unmet medical need 
in HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Sacituzumab govitecan is a first-in-class ADC composed of the following 3 components: 
1) 
2) 
3) 
hRS7 IgG1κ: humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the cell-surface receptor, Trop 2 
SN-38: camptothecin derived topoisomerase I inhibitor and active metabolite of irinotecan 
CL2A: hydrolyzable linker that couples SN 38 to hRS7 IgG1κ 
Sacituzumab govitecan binds to Trop-2-expressing cancer cells and is internalised with the subsequent 
release of SN-38 from a hydrolysable linker. SN-38 interacts with topoisomerase I and prevents 
Assessment report  
EMA/319185/2023  
Page 10/163 
 
 
 
re-ligation of topoisomerase I-induced single strand breaks. The resulting DNA damage leads to 
apoptosis and cell death.  
Sacituzumab govitecan was granted a marketing authorization from the European Commission (EU) on 
22 November 2021 for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic triple-negative 
breast cancer who have received two or more prior systemic therapies, including at least one of them 
for advanced disease. 
The recommended dose of sacituzumab govitecan is 10 mg/kg body weight administered as an 
intravenous infusion once weekly on Day 1 and Day 8 of 21-day treatment cycles. Treatment should be 
continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.   
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
EMA scientific advice for HR+/HER2- breast cancer, 2018 
The MAH received Scientific advice from the CHMP on 13 December 2018 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/852346/2018). The Scientific advice pertained to design elements of Study IMMU-
132-09, including the proposed eligibility criteria, use of TPC monotherapy as comparator, local 
determination of HR status, 2:1 randomization scheme, stratification factors, PFS as primary endpoint 
with OS as key secondary endpoint, QoL assessments, statistical analysis, and planned interim analysis 
for ORR. The proposed study design was overall considered acceptable; however, following CHMP 
recommendations, the MAH introduced a blinded independent review of PFS, removed taxanes as a 
comparator treatment option, removed the interim analysis based on ORR, and revised the 
requirement that at least 50% of randomized patients should have received 1 prior line of 
chemotherapy to the need of at least 2 prior systemic chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No updated environmental risk assessment (ERA) was submitted (see discussion on non-clinical 
aspects). 
2.2.1.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The environmental risk assessment (ERA) was previously submitted for Trodelvy as part of the EU 
initial MAA. This ERA considered all available data relating to sacituzumab govitecan in accordance with 
the CHMP guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00).  
The EMA guideline on the ERA states that “the evaluation of the environmental impact should be made 
if there is an increase in the environmental exposure, e.g. a new indication may result in a significant 
increase in the extent of the use.” 
The calculation made in the existing ERA used the default fraction market penetration value which was 
refined based on the proposed dosing regimen i.e. maximum dose of 10 mg/kg sacituzumab govitecan 
Assessment report  
EMA/319185/2023  
Page 11/163 
 
 
 
given twice every three weeks. The Predicted Environmental Concentration in Surface Water (PECsw) 
in the existing ERA was based on an estimation of exposure to the payload SN-38, the active 
compound, which was below the trigger value of 0.01 μg/L. 
An update of the ERA was not submitted as the indication extension is within the environmental 
exposure predicted by the prior ERA, since the dosing regimen will not change for the extension of 
indication and the calculation is thus independent of the indication. Furthermore, a more detailed 
calculation was provided to justify that the PECsw for SN-38 is 2-fold below the action limit of 0.01 
μg/L as defined for any indication and the indication extension is within the environmental exposure 
predicted by the ERA approved for the initial EU MAA.  
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of sacituzumab govitecan.  
Considering the above data, sacituzumab govitecan is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

The integrated safety dataset includes all available data up to the data cutoff dates from Studies IMMU-132-06 
(30 October 2020) and IMMU-132-09 (01 July 2022), and final safety data from Studies IMMU-132-01 (02 April 2021) and 
IMMU-132-05 (25 February 2021). 
Participants received SG 10 mg/kg IV infusion on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day treatment cycle. 
b 
TPC was eribulin, capecitabine, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine administered per standard of care.

d 
Starting doses of 8, 10, 12, and 18 mg/kg were evaluated during the dose escalation phase (Phase 1) of Study IMMU-132-01. 
e  Of the 515 participants enrolled in Study IMMU-132-01, 495 participants were included in the Overall Safety Population. Of 
these, 402 participants received SG 10 mg/kg, 81 participants received SG 8 mg/kg, 9 participants received SG 12 mg/kg, 
and 3 participants received SG 18 mg/kg. The population included the following tumor types: ovarian, endometrial, cervical, 
TNBC, HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, NSCLC, SCLC, head 
and neck squamous cell cancer, esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, hepatocellular, renal (clear cell), thyroid (papillary), and 
metastatic UC. Patients with GBM were also eligible, but were not required to have metastatic disease. 
f  Overall, 68 participants with non-TNBC were enrolled in Study IMMU-132-01 and received at least 1 dose of SG. Of these 
68 participants, 54 were confirmed as HR+/HER2− who had progressed on at least 1 prior hormonal therapy in the metastatic 
setting, and had received at least 1 dose of SG 10 mg/kg. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods 
Four analytes were measured to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SG:  
1) 
total antibody (hRS7 + hRS7-SN-38) 
A validated assay that is capable of distinguishing naked (unconjugated; drug-to-antibody ratio 
(DAR) 0) hRS7-IgG from SN-38-conjugated SG (DAR 1-8) is not available. Therefore, the amount 
of SG in serum was calculated using the concentrations of measured total SN-38 and free SN-38. A 
fixed DAR of 8 was used for calculation purposes only. The amount of circulating SG in serum was 
then estimated as follows SG = 161 kDa/8 × 392 Da × (Concentration of Bound SN - 38) 
2)  free SN-38 (the cytotoxic payload, not covalently bound to SG) 
3)  SN-38G (an inactive metabolite of SN-38, not covalently bound to SG) 
4)  total SN-38 (free SN-38 + hRS7-SN-38)  
Bioanalytical methods for the quantitation of total SN-38, free SN-38, SN-38G, and hRS7-IgG in 
human serum were developed and fully validated at KCAS, LLC (Shawnee, Kansas, USA).  
Quantification of the analytes in serum were conducted using the same validated bioanalytical methods 
that were used in the initial breast cancer application.

Immunogenicity 
To assess the immunogenicity of SG or its components, assay methods to detect the presence of anti-
drug antibodies (ADAs) and neutralising antibodies (Nabs) were developed and validated in accordance 
with agency guidance (European Medicines Agency (EMA) 2017, U.S. Department of Health & Human 
Services (DHHS) 2019), as stated by the Applicant. 
In addition to Studies IMMU 132 01 and IMMU 132 05, the following studies contributed only to the 
assessment of the immunogenicity of SG. 
• 
Study IMMU 132 06: A Phase II Open-Label, Study of IMMU 132 in Metastatic Urothelial Cancer 
After Failure of Platinum-Based Regimen or Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Based Immunotherapy (Cohorts 1 and 2) 
• 
Study IMMU 132 09 (TROPiCS 02): Phase 3 Study of Sacituzumab Govitecan (IMMU 132) 
Versus Treatment of Physician’s Choice (TPC) in Subjects with Hormonal Receptor Positive (HR+) 
Human Epidermal Grown Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) Who 
Have Failed at least Two Prior Chemotherapy Regimens 
Distribution 
Based on the PopPK analysis of SG using data from Studies IMMU-132-01, IMMU-132-05, and IMMU-
132-09, the Vc and Vp of SG were estimated to be 2.65 and 0.929 L, respectively, corresponding to an 
estimated Vss of 3.58 L. 
Elimination 
Based on the PopPK analysis of SG using data from Studies IMMU-132-01, IMMU-132-05, and IMMU-
132-09, the CL of SG was estimated to be 0.128 L/h (SG PopPK 2022-02). The median t1/2 of SG and 
free SN-38 was 23.4 and 17.6 hours, respectively, based on the noncompartmental analyses for Study 
IMMU-132-05. 
Population Pharmacokinetics  
Concentration-time data from Studies IMMU-132-01 and IMMU-132-05 were used to develop the 
PopPK models, and concentration-time data from Study IMMU-132-09 were used for external 
validation and re-estimation of PK parameters. The PK of SG, free SN-38, and total antibody from 
Study IMMU-132-09 were described by the previously developed PopPK models based on Studies 
IMMU-132-01 and IMMU-132-05. 
The re-estimated PK parameter values and associated variability using combined data from Studies 
IMMU-132-01, IMMU-132-05, and IMMU-132-09 were similar to those of the previously developed 
model (Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4). Serum concentration data from a total of 784, 770, and 786 
participants were used for the final PopPK model of SG, free SN-38, and total antibody, respectively. 
There was no change in the model structure or statistical significance of the previously identified 
covariates for any of the 3 analytes after inclusion of the Study IMMU-132-09 dataset.  
The prediction-corrected visual predictive checks for the final PopPK models of SG, free SN-38, and 
total antibody (including data from Study IMMU-132-09) are presented in Figure 1.

Special populations 
Effect of Intrinsic Factors 
The PopPK analysis of SG evaluated the broader potential impact of demographic and disease-related 
factors on PK as covariates in participants with various advanced epithelial cancers, participants with 
metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, and participants with HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer 
from Studies IMMU-132-01, IMMU-132-05, and IMMU-132-09, respectively. A forest plot analysis was 
performed to further assess the correlations between covariates and SG, free SN-38, and total 
antibody exposures (AUC and Cmax) over the first treatment cycle relative to exposures in a 
participant with reference covariate values. The individual-estimated PK parameters from the final 
PopPK models were used to predict individual AUC and Cmax over the first treatment cycle for the SG 
10-mg/kg dose. The exposures for participants were predicted using participants’ respective covariate 
values (including body weight). Covariate correlations for all continuous and categorical covariates 
were subsequently analyzed based on linear models and predicted at the 5th and 95th percentiles of 
continuous covariate values or for all categories of categorical covariates. Relative exposures were 
normalized by the predictions at the median of continuous covariate values and the most common 
category of categorical covariates. The effect of intrinsic factors on SG, free SN-38, and total antibody 
exposures is summarized below. 
Renal Impairment 
Mild or moderate renal impairment had no clinically relevant effect on SG, free SN-38, or total antibody 
exposure. 
Hepatic Impairment 
The exposure of sacituzumab govitecan was similar in patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin 
≤ ULN and AST > ULN, or bilirubin > 1.0 to ≤ 1.5 ULN and AST of any level; n = 257) to patients with 
normal hepatic function (bilirubin and AST ≤ ULN; n = 526). Mild hepatic impairment had no clinically 
relevant effect on SG, free SN-38, or total antibody exposure. Sacituzumab govitecan and free SN-38 
exposures are unknown in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.  
A Phase 1 study evaluating the PK and safety of SG in participants with moderate hepatic impairment 
is currently ongoing (Study IMMU-132-15). 
Age 
Age had no effect on SG, free SN-38, or total antibody exposure. 
Body Weight 
The effect of body weight on model-predicted SG and free SN-38 AUC was within 80% to 125% of the 
predicted exposures in a typical participant (body weight of 70 kg), with a body weight of 105 kg (95th 
percentile) estimated to result in 22% higher AUC than a typical participant (Figure 2 and Figure 3). 
For total antibody, the model-predicted AUC for a body weight of 105 kg (95th percentile) was 
estimated to be 26% higher than that in a typical participant (Figure 4).

UGT1A1 Genotype 
No significant differences in SG or free SN-38 exposure were observed in participants with the 
UGT1A1*28/*28 genotype compared with participants with the UGT1A1*1/*1 or UGT1A1*1/*28 
genotype. 
Baseline Trop-2 Expression Level 
A continuous covariate representing Trop-2 expression based on the staining H-score was available for 
participants from Studies IMMU-132-05 and IMMU-132-09. Baseline Trop-2 expression level was not 
found to be meaningfully correlated with individual-predicted exposures based on the final PopPK 
models of SG and total antibody. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Effect of Extrinsic Factors 
No drug-drug interaction studies with SG were submitted. 
Concomitant administration of SG with UGT1A1 inhibitors may increase the incidence of adverse 
reactions due to the potential increase in systemic exposure to SN-38. Exposure to SN-38 may be 
reduced in patients concomitantly receiving UGT1A1 enzyme inducers. 
Among the 789 participants assessed in the PopPK analyses, only a few participants received either 
UGT1A1 inhibitors (N = 16) or inducers (N = 5) during SG treatment. The model-estimated individual 
SG and free SN-38 exposures in participants who received UGT1A1 inhibitors or inducers were 
comparable and within the range of exposures in participants who did not receive UGT1A1 inhibitors or 
inducers. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Integrated Antidrug Antibody Responses 
An overall summary and cross-study comparison of ADA responses to SG in participants who received 
at least 1 dose of SG 10 mg/kg are presented in Table 5. Immunogenicity samples for ADA prevalence 
and incidence assessments were evaluable for 869 and 785 participants, respectively, across Studies 
IMMU-132-01, IMMU-132-05, IMMU-132-06, and IMMU-132-09.  
Only 9 of 785 participants evaluable for ADA incidence (1.1%) had treatment-emergent ADAs to SG. 
Among participants with treatment-emergent ADAs, the onset of ADAs was typically observed at their 
last visit (range: 36 to 245 days after first SG dose). The maximum reportable ADA titer observed 
across the studies was low and varied in range from 10 to 30. 
No participant had treatment-boosted ADAs. Six of the 9 participants (0.8% of all patients treated with 
sacituzumab govitecan) with treatment-emergent ADAs also had positive NAb assessments.

Antibody Response to Sacituzumab Govitecan (IMMU-132 ISI Populations) 
Impact of Antidrug Antibodies on Sacituzumab Govitecan and Total Antibody Pharmacokinetics 
The impact of immunogenicity on the PK of SG and total antibody was evaluated using available serum 
concentration and ADA data from Studies IMMU-132-01, IMMU-132-05, IMMU 132 06, and IMMU-132-
09. Pharmacokinetic data were available for 8 of 9 participants with treatment-emergent ADA 
responses. An overlay of time course of SG and total antibody concentrations in ADA-positive (solid-
colored symbols) and ADA-negative (solid gray circles) participants is presented in Figure 4. Overall, 
SG exposures in ADA positive participants were within the range of exposures observed in ADA-
negative participants. 
Due to the very low incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs (1.1%), a quantitative assessment of the 
impact of ADAs on SG or total antibody exposure could not be performed in the PopPK analyses.

Total Antibody Serum Concentrations Versus Time Since Last Dose by Antidrug 
Antibody Status Based on Pooled Data 
Impact of Antidrug Antibodies on Efficacy 
Given the small number of participants with positive ADA responses to SG across Studies IMMU 132-
01, IMMU-132-05, IMMU-132-06, and IMMU-132-09, no formal analysis was performed to assess the 
impact of ADAs on the efficacy of SG. Overall, there was no clear impact of ADA on efficacy. 
Impact of Antidrug Antibodies on Safety 
All 9 participants (1.1%) with treatment-emergent ADAs received a starting dose of SG 10 mg/kg. 
None of these participants had treatment-emergent serious adverse events considered related to SG or 
treatment-emergent AEs that led to premature discontinuation of study drug. Among the participants 
with treatment-emergent ADAs, only 2 participants had treatment-emergent hypersensitivity+ AEs (1 
participant in Study IMMU 132 05 and 1 participant in Study IMMU 132 06), and these did not begin in 
the time frame of positive ADA results; both participants also had positive NAb assessments. No 
participant had treatment-emergent immune-mediated AEs. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-Response Relationships 
Exposure-response analyses were previously conducted using data from a total of 277 participants with 
metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. These analyses characterized the relationships between SG, 
free SN-38, and total antibody exposures and the efficacy and safety of SG in participants with 
metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, based on clinical data from Studies IMMU-132-01 and IMMU-
Assessment report

132-05. The exposure-response analyses showed exposure-dependent increases in the probability of 
response (complete response [CR] and objective response [OR]) and survival (PFS and OS) for the 
evaluated efficacy endpoints and exposure-dependent increases in the probability of the evaluated AEs 
(neutropenia, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and hypersensitivity reactions). Relative to lower doses, 
greater efficacy and a manageable safety profile were estimated with the exposures associated with 
the SG 10-mg/kg dosing regimen.  
Using a similar modeling framework, exposure-response for efficacy analyses were conducted using 
data from a total of 260 participants with HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer from Study IMMU-132-
09 and exposure-response for safety and dose reductions/dose delays analyses were conducted using 
data from a total of 569 participants with metastatic breast cancer who received SG (those with 
HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in Study IMMU-132-
01, those with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in Study IMMU-132-05, and those with 
HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer in Study IMMU- 132-09). Data from the primary (final) analysis 
of PFS and first planned interim superiority analysis of OS (OS IA1, data cutoff date of 03 January 
2022) for IMMU-132-09 was used for exposure-response analyses of all endpoints except OS. 
Exploratory analyses using data from the second planned interim analysis of OS (OS IA2, data cutoff 
date of 01 July 2022) for IMMU- 132-09 indicated that few, if any, new events were reported for CR, 
ORR, CBR, and PFS and the only meaningful data addition occurred for the OS endpoint. Hence, data 
from OS IA2 was only used for exposure-response analysis of OS. For all other efficacy and safety 
endpoints, exposure response analyses were conducted using data from the primary analysis.  
Exposure-Efficacy Analyses 
Exposure-efficacy relationships were evaluated in participants with HR+/HER2− metastatic breast 
cancer who received a starting dose of SG 10 mg/kg on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle in Study 
IMMU-132-09 (SG E-R 2022-03). The exposure-efficacy analysis dataset included a total of 260 
participants with HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer from Study IMMU-132-09 who had PopPK 
parameter estimates to enable estimation of exposure metrics related to SG dosing and had data for 
the respective efficacy endpoints. 
The evaluated efficacy endpoints included CR, ORR, CBR, PFS, and OS.  
The exposure-efficacy relationships were analyzed using binomial logistic regression models for CR, 
ORR, and CBR and Cox proportional-hazards time-to-event models for PFS and OS. 
The CAVG was derived based on the individual-estimated concentration of the respective analyte (SG, 
free SN-38, or total antibody) as follows: 
In the equation above, tevent is the time to observing the endpoint of interest. 
In addition to CAVG, the Cmax and AUC during the first treatment cycle (21 days after the first SG 
dose) and cumulative exposure (AUC) until the observed response (CR, ORR, and CBR only) for each 
of the 3 analytes (SG, free SN-38, and total antibody) were also evaluated as exposure metrics related 
to the efficacy endpoints, and the most statistically significant exposure metric was retained in the 
model. In addition to exposure, the effect of other covariates was characterized within the modeling 
framework. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319185/2023  
Page 25/163 
 
 
 
 
 
Within the evaluated exposure range, SG average concentration (CAVGSG) was identified as the most 
statistically significant exposure metric correlated with CR, ORR, and CBR, such that higher values of 
CAVGSG were statistically significantly associated with an increased probability of CR, OR, and CB (see 
Figures below). A comparison of the observed proportions of participants and model-predicted 
probabilities of CR, OR, and CB for the SG 10-mg/kg starting dose group is presented in Table 6. Once 
CAVGSG was included in the models of CR, ORR, and CBR, no additional statistically significant 
covariates were identified.

For PFS and OS, total antibody average concentration (CAVGtAB) was found to be the most statistically 
significant exposure metric, such that higher values of CAVGtAB were statistically significantly 
associated with longer PFS and OS. The median survival times across quartiles of CAVGtAB suggested 
that higher exposure was associated with longer PFS and OS in participants with HR+/HER2− 
metastatic breast cancer.  
The median survival times for both PFS and OS were longer for participants in the highest quartile of 
CAVGtAB compared with those in the lower quartiles of CAVGtAB.

Antibody Average Concentration (OS IA2) 
The demographics and baseline disease characteristics appeared to be comparable among participants 
in the 4 CAVGtAB quartiles depicted in Figure 9, with the exception of a slightly higher proportion of 
participants with an ECOG performance status of 1 in the lowest CAVGtAB quartile. 
Dose reductions (from a starting dose of SG 10 mg/kg to 7.5 and 5 mg/kg) due to AEs contributed to 
the spread of exposures among the 4 CAVGtAB quartiles with the lower exposures observed in the first 
and second CAVGtAB quartiles (Figure 9). The PopPK model-predicted typical CAVGtAB for the 10-
mg/kg dose (213 μg/mL, assuming no dose reductions) was more consistent with the exposures 
observed for the third and fourth CAVGtAB quartiles shown in Figure 9 and Table 6. 
For PFS, once CAVGtAB was included in the model, no additional statistically significant covariates were 
identified. For OS, only higher baseline lactate dehydrogenase levels were found to be statistically 
significantly associated with shorter OS. Higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase at baseline are known 
to be associated with worse outcomes across a wide variety of solid tumors, including breast cancer 
(Forkasiewicz 2020, Pelizzari 2019).

performance status, prior cancer treatment, baseline Trop-2 expression level, UGT1A1 genotype, prior

CDK 4/6 inhibitor treatment duration, and number of prior lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic 
setting, were not found to be significantly associated with any of the evaluated efficacy endpoints. 
Exposure-Safety Analyses 
Exposure-safety relationships were evaluated in participants with metastatic breast cancer 
(HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer) who received a 
starting dose of SG 8 mg/kg (16 participants from Studies IMMU-132-01 and IMMU-132-05), 10 mg/kg 
(550 participants from Studies IMMU-132-01, IMMU-132-05, and IMMU-132-09), or 12 mg/kg (3 
participants from Study IMMU-132-01) on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle (SG E-R 2022-03). The 
exposure-safety analysis dataset included a total of 569 participants (96.7% in the SG 10-mg/kg 
starting dose group) from Studies IMMU-132-01, IMMU-132-05, and IMMU-132-09 who had PopPK 
parameter estimates to enable estimation of exposure metrics related to SG dosing and had data for 
the respective safety endpoints. 
The evaluated safety endpoints included the following selected AEs associated with SG (based on the 
highest severity grade of the AE reported for each participant): neutropenia (preferred terms: 
neutropenia and neutrophil count decreased), diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and hypersensitivity+ 
(hypersensitivity Standardized MedDRA Query [SMQ] [broad and narrow] and anaphylactic reaction 
SMQ [broad and narrow] and only events with onset dates on the day of or 1 day after study drug 
administration). Other AEs of special interest evaluated as a part of the exposure-safety analyses were 
neutropenia+ (preferred terms: neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased, and febrile neutropenia) and 
febrile neutropenia. The exposure-safety relationships were analyzed using nonproportional odds 
logistic regression models jointly describing the incidence of any grade, Grade 3 or higher, and Grade 4 
adverse events (AEs). Nonproportional odds models with grade-specific intercepts and grade-specific 
slopes were used for diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and hypersensitivity+. The observed neutropenia, 
neutropenia+, and febrile neutropenia events were not adequately described by this model; thus, 
alternative models based on a common intercept and log-transformed exposure metric were selected 
for these neutropenia-related AEs. 
The average concentration (CAVG) and the Cmax and AUC during the first treatment cycle (21 days 
after the first SG dose) for each of the 3 analytes (SG, free SN-38, and total antibody) were evaluated 
as exposure metrics related to the safety endpoints, and the most statistically significant exposure 
metric was retained in the model; the effect of other covariates was also characterized within the 
modeling framework. 
Overall, CAVGSG was identified as the most statistically significant exposure metric correlated with the 
evaluated AEs. 
Neutropenia 
Higher values of CAVGSG were statistically significantly associated with an increased probability of any 
grade, Grade 3 or higher, and Grade 4 neutropenia. Neutropenia was the only AE where the effect of 
exposure was significantly associated with the probability of Grade 3 or higher or Grade 4 evaluated 
AEs. UGT1A1 genotype had a statistically significant effect on the probability of any grade, Grade 3 or 
higher, and Grade 4 neutropenia, such that participants with the UGT1A1*28/*28 genotype were 
associated with an increased probability of any grade, Grade 3 or higher, and Grade 4 events 
compared with participants without the UGT1A1*28/*28 genotype (UGT1A1*1/*1, UGT1A1*1/*28, all 
others, or missing) ().

Higher values of CAVGSG were statistically significantly associated with an increased probability of any 
grade diarrhoea (Figure 11). Once CAVGSG was included in the model of diarrhoea, no additional 
statistically significant covariates were identified. 
Nausea 
Higher values of CAVGSG were statistically significantly associated with an increased probability of any 
grade nausea. Region had a statistically significant effect on the probability of any grade nausea, such 
that participants in North America were associated with an increased probability of any grade events 
compared with participants in Europe. Despite the statistically significant effect of region, plots of the 
exposure-response relationships indicated that the model-predicted probability of nausea showed 
considerable overlap between relevant covariate strata. As such, the identified region effect was not 
considered clinically relevant. 
Vomiting 
Higher values of CAVGSG were statistically significantly associated with an increased probability of any 
grade vomiting. Study was found to have a statistically significant effect on the probability of any 
grade vomiting, such that participants from Study IMMU-132-01 were associated with an increased 
probability of any grade events compared with participants from Studies IMMU-132-05 and IMMU-132-
09. Despite the statistically significant effect of study, plots of the exposure-response relationships 
indicated that the model-predicted probability of vomiting showed considerable overlap between 
relevant covariate strata. 
Hypersensitivity+ 
Higher values of CAVGSG were statistically significantly associated with an increased probability of any 
grade hypersensitivity+. Once CAVGSG was included in the model of hypersensitivity+, no additional 
statistically significant covariates were identified. 
Other Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Higher values of CAVGSG were statistically significantly associated with an increased probability of any 
grade, Grade 3 or higher, and Grade 4 neutropenia+, as well as Grade 3 or higher and Grade 4 febrile 
neutropenia. UGT1A1 genotype had a statistically significant effect on the probability of any grade, 
Grade 3 or higher, and Grade 4 neutropenia+, such that participants with the UGT1A1*28/*28 
genotype were associated with an increased probability of any grade, Grade 3 or higher, and Grade 4 
events compared with participants without the UGT1A1*28/*28 genotype (UGT1A1*1/*1, 
UGT1A1*1/*28, all others, or missing). Once CAVGSG was included in the model of febrile 
neutropenia, no additional statistically significant covariates were identified. 
The estimated odds ratios associated with increases in CAVGSG for models based on log-transformed 
or linear exposure and the model-predicted probabilities of any grade and Grade 3 or higher selected 
AEs associated with SG for the SG 10-mg/kg starting dose group are presented in Table 7 and Table 8. 
Other evaluated covariates, including race, ECOG performance status, prior cancer treatment, baseline 
Trop-2 expression level, prior CDK 4/6 inhibitor treatment duration, and number of prior lines of 
chemotherapy in the metastatic setting, were not found to be significantly associated with any of the 
evaluated safety endpoints.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology package of sacituzumab govitecan so far comprised three clinical studies 
(study IMMU-132-01, study IMMU-132-05 and IMMU-132-09) contributing to the characterization of PK 
of the 5 analytes SG, free SN-38, total SN-38, SN-38G, and total antibody. In study IMMU-132-01, 
doses of 4.5 to 18 mg/kg IV were investigated. 
The proposed standard dose of SG is 10 mg/kg administered IV once weekly on Days 1 and 8 of 21-
day treatment cycles.  
The bioanalytical methods used for quantification of SG, free SN-38, total SN-38, SN-38G, and total 
antibody in serum were conducted using the same methods that were used in the initial BC application 
and are considered acceptable.  
The previous Pop PK model for BC was updated with data from Study IMMU-132-09. Serum 
concentration data from a total of 784, 770, and 786 participants were used for the final PopPK model 
of SG, free SN-38, and total antibody, respectively. There was no change in the model structure or 
statistical significance of the previously identified covariates for any of the 3 analytes after inclusion of 
the Study IMMU-132-09 dataset. No new covariates were identified. While statistically significant 
relationships between region and nausea, and study and vomiting were identified and included in 
addition to CAVGSG in the respective final AE models, the impact of these covariates on the associated 
AEs was not considered clinically relevant. The final Pop PK model could adequately describe the data 
from HR+/HER2- BC patients. 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of SG, total antibody and free SN-38, total SN-
38, SN-38G, is well-characterised and described in the initial TNBC application. The recommended 10 
mg/kg weekly dose regimen for HER2-low BC patients applied in Study IMMU-132-09 resulted in 
comparable exposures to the approved regimen of SG subjects with unresectable or metastatic TNBC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319185/2023  
Page 34/163 
 
 
 
  
The recommended dose regimen is weight-based and resulted in increased Cmax and AUC with 
increasing body weight.  
A summary of individual-predicted SG exposures for participants receiving 10 mg/kg estimated based 
on the final model and stratified by body weight categories was provided (data not shown) and 
participants with body weight < 49 kg were estimated to have approximately 17% lower SG AUC over 
the first treatment cycle compared with participants with body weights ranging from 49 to 105 kg, 
while participants with body weight > 105 kg were estimated to have approximately 24% higher SG 
AUC than participants with body weights ranging from 49 to 105 kg. However, this difference could be 
regarded as within the range of the middle weight patients, and it is acknowledged that these 
differences could be regarded as non-significant. 
Exposures of SG, free SN-38, or total antibody were comparable between HR+ HER2-negative subjects 
with normal hepatic function and mild hepatic impairment and between HR+ HER2-negative subjects 
with normal renal function, mild or moderate renal impairment. No significant differences in SG or free 
SN-38 exposure were observed in participants with the UGT1A1*28/*28 genotype compared with 
participants with the UGT1A1*1/*1 or UGT1A1*1/*28 genotype. 
Overall, pharmacokinetic analyses in patients treated with sacituzumab govitecan (n = 789) did not 
identify an effect of age, race, and mild or moderate renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of 
sacituzumab govitecan (see SmPC section 5.2). No adjustment to the starting dose is required when 
administering sacituzumab govitecan to patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see SmPC 
section 4.2). There are no data on the pharmacokinetics of sacituzumab govitecan in patients with 
severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (CrCl < 15 mL/min) (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 
5.2). 
The exposure of sacituzumab govitecan was similar in patients with mild hepatic impairment to 
patients with normal hepatic function (see SmPC section 5.2). Sacituzumab govitecan and free SN-38 
exposures are unknown in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. A Phase 1 study 
evaluating the PK and safety of SG in participants with moderate hepatic impairment is currently 
ongoing (Study IMMU-132-15) (see RMP). 
No drug-drug interaction studies with SG were submitted which is acceptable. 
The incidence of post-baseline ADAs and NAbs was low, 1.2% in the total SG treated pool. 
Exposure-response (E-R) analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationships between SG-related 
exposure and its efficacy (as described by CR, ORR, CBR, PFS, and OS) (study included IMMU-09) and 
safety (as described by AEs of vomiting, diarrhoea, ‘hypersensitivity+’, nausea, neutropenia, febrile 
neutropenia, and ‘neutropenia+’). The previous exposure-response analyses were updated with the 
data from Study IMMU-132-09.   
The E-R relationships were consistent with those detected previously. The exposure-response analyses 
showed that an OS benefit of SG is dependent on exposure. No additional effect of investigated 
covariates (e.g., age body weight, race, UGT1A1 genotype, baseline Trop-2 expression level, ECOG 
performance status, prior cancer treatment, prior CDK 4/6 inhibitor treatment duration, number of 
prior lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting) was identified. Only higher baseline lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were found to be statistically significantly associated with shorter OS, 
which was expected as LDH is a known predictive marker in this setting (Forkasiewicz 2020, Pelizzari 
2019). 
Sacituzumab govitecan average concentration (CAVGSG) was correlated with Grade 3 or higher and 
Grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and ‘neutropenia+’. The risk of neutropenia and associated

dose reductions was largest for the UGT1A1 genotype *28/*28 in comparison to other genotype 
categories evaluated (see clinical safety).  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology is considered adequately described for treatment of HR+HER2-
negative BC subjects with SG at the recommended dose weekly 10 mg/kg.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Dose selection for SG in participants with HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer was based on efficacy 
and safety data from Study IMMU-132-01. In the Phase 1 part of Study IMMU 132 01, dose escalation 
was performed according to a standard 3 + 3 design and based on planned initial dose levels of 8, 12, 
and 18 mg/kg administered on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. An SG dose of 12 mg/kg was formally 
identified as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), but was associated with dose delays and dose 
reductions in several participants. In order to determine a maximum acceptable dose, participants in 
Phase 2 of Study IMMU 132 01 were enrolled in a sequential manner to the 8 mg/kg dose, and 
subsequently to the 10 mg/kg dose. An interim analysis was performed when 81 and 97 participants 
with different tumor types had been treated at the 2 dose levels, respectively. Both dose levels were 
shown to be better tolerated in the first cycle than the formally determined MTD of 12 mg/kg, allowing 
repeated cycles with a better safety profile. The duration of treatment at the 2 dose levels was similar, 
and no important differences in safety were observed. However, the 10-mg/kg dose was associated 
with better efficacy compared with the 8-mg/kg dose in participants with various tumor types (ORR 
22% versus 10%, respectively) (Ocean 2017).

Treatments 
SG arm 
Sacituzumab govitecan 10 mg/kg administered as an IV infusion on Days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles.  
Treatment continued until disease progression as determined by local investigator review (LIR) using 
RECIST v1.1, unacceptable toxicity, or another treatment discontinuation criterion was met. 
Participants were permitted to continue in the treatment period beyond initial RECIST v1.1-defined 
progression as long as investigator-assessed clinical benefit was observed and the participant was 
tolerating study drug. Participants were to discontinue study treatment upon evidence of further 
progression and/or loss of clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator. 
The initial infusion should proceed over 3 hours. Subsequent infusions could either be administered 
over 3 hours or 1-2 hours if vital signs remained stable and no infusion reactions occur. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319185/2023

Participants receiving SG were to be monitored during and for at least 30 minutes after infusion. 
Participants in the SG group also received premedications for prevention of infusion-related reactions 
(ie, antipyretics, H1 blockers, and H2 blockers) and a 2- or 3-drug combination regimen for prevention 
and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. 
•  Dose delays  
Scheduled Day 1 and Day 8 dosing could have been delayed for up to 1 week for treatment-related 
toxicities; however, if the toxicity did not resolve to Grade 2 or lower within 1 week of Day 8, then the 
scheduled Day 8 dosing could have been cancelled and dosing was to resume with Day 1 of the 
following cycle. There was to be a minimum of 14 days and a maximum of 21 days between the Day 8 
infusion and the Day 1 infusion of the next cycle.

Scoring and Interpretation 
The following interpretation criteria were used to assess each breast cancer sample used in study 
TROPiCS-02: 
•  Approximate number of viable tumor cells ≥ 100. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319185/2023  
Page 42/163 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Scoring included all areas of evaluable viable tumor in the section, even if tumor was 
discontinuous or in separate tissue fragments in the section.  
Necrotic: areas, poorly preserved, poorly fixed areas, or areas exhibiting artifactual changes 
were excluded from scoring. 
• 
Intensity of Trop-2 staining and percent of tumor cells demonstrating staining at various levels 
from 0 to 3+ for membrane staining. Determination of a standard H-score used as a measure 
of both intensity and percent of positive tumor cells for membrane staining.  
•  Staining intensity was categorized in standard manner and is described in the validation report. 
For the validation studies, the H-score was calculated for the tumor membrane staining using 
the following formula: 
The H score combines components of staining intensity with the percentage of positive cells.  
It has a value between 0 and 300.  
For the validation studies, the H-score was calculated for the tumor membrane staining using the 
following formula: 
• 
The approximate percent tumor necrosis was noted and overall staining intensity in necrotic 
areas was noted in the comment section; however, this was not included in the H-score.

An overall sample size of approximately 520 participants was planned for randomization in a 1:1 ratio 
to either SG or TPC. 
The sample size was estimated based on the primary endpoint of PFS, but also took into account OS as 
the main secondary endpoint. 
For PFS, assuming an HR of 0.70 (median PFS of 5.3 months for SG and 3.7 months for TPC), a total 
of 350 PFS events were needed to detect a statistically significant difference at a 2-sided alpha of 0.05 
with 92% power. With an estimated average accrual rate of 22 participants per month, a total of 520 
participants would provide approximately 350 PFS events approximately 27 months after the first 
participant was randomized, after accounting for events being censored because of participants 
missing tumor assessments or starting subsequent anticancer therapies. 
For OS, assuming an HR of 0.73 (median OS of 16.5 months for SG and 12 months for TPC), a total of 
438 OS events were needed to detect a statistically significant difference at a 2-sided alpha of 0.05 
with 86.7% power, based on a recruitment period of 24 months and survival follow-up period of 52 
months (from the time of first participant randomized). 
It was planned that the Sponsor would closely monitor the number of subjects randomized and 
discontinued, including subjects who refuse study treatment assigned. As the primary analysis was to 
be triggered by a targeted number of PFS events, subjects who prematurely discontinue from the 
study or whose events are censored were not to be counted toward the targeted number. To 
compensate for such cases, an additional number of subjects was planned to be enrolled to ensure the 
Assessment report

targeted number of events is reached within a reasonable timeframe. The additional number of 
subjects was planned to be determined by the Sponsor on the basis of the number and pattern of 
accumulated and censored events at the appropriate times as the study progresses. 
Initially, a smaller sample size of n=400 patients was planned to be recruited, based on similar 
assumptions. The number if PFS events was planned to be 350 in the initial study protocol and was not 
changed. 
• 
Randomisation  
Participants were planned for randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 of the 2 following treatments: 
SG or TPC. 
Randomization was planned to be stratified based on prior chemotherapy regimens for treatment of 
metastatic disease (2 or 3/4 lines), visceral metastasis (yes or no), and endocrine therapy in the 
metastatic setting for at least 6 months (yes or no). 
• 
Blinding (masking) 
IMMU-132-09 was an open-label study; however, the independent central reviewer of imaging for 
primary and secondary endpoints and the sponsor’s medical monitors, statisticians, programmers, and 
personnel directly involved with study analysis remained blinded to study data, including participant 
treatment assignment, until after data finalization for the combined PFS final analysis and OS IA1. The 
sponsor’s and contract research organization’s (CRO) operations and data management personnel and 
the CRO’s medical monitor personnel directly involved with study conduct remained unblinded to study 
data. 
• 
Statistical methods  
Analysis sets 
The following analysis sets were planned to be used: 
•  Screened Set was planned to be the group of all subjects who have signed an informed 
consent and participated in screening procedures at the investigative site to assess eligibility. 
• 
Full Analysis Set (Intent-to-Treat Analysis [ITT] Population) is the group of all randomized 
subjects. This was planned to be the primary analysis population for all efficacy analyses which 
were planned to be based on the ITT principle, with subjects analyzed according to the 
randomized treatment assignment. 
•  Safety Analysis Set was planned to be the group of subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
study drug. This was planned to be the analysis population for all safety analyses which will be 
based on the actual treatment received. 
•  HRQoL- Evaluable Set was planned to be the all ITT population who had an evaluable 
assessment of the HRQoL at baseline and at least one evaluable assessment at post-baseline 
visits. An evaluable assessment at a given visit was to be defined as at least one of the 15 
domains/scales were non-missing at that scheduled assessment visit. 
• 
PK Set was planned to be the Safety population subjects who have completed at least one 
cycle of sacituzumab govitecan treatment and have at least one non-missing PK concentration 
of total SN-38, free SN-38, total antibody (hRS7 IgG) and/or SN-38G. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319185/2023  
Page 44/163 
 
 
 
Primary outcome variable 
Primary analysis of PFS were planned to be based on BICR assessments. PFS, ORR, CBR and DOR 
analyses were planned to be produced for both BICR and LIR. PFS was defined as the time from the 
date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or death 
(whichever occurs first) according to BICR using RECIST 1.1. 
Censoring 
Any subject who progresses or dies after more than one missed scheduled visit was planned to be 
censored at the last date of radiographic assessment prior to the missed visit. Any subject who 
receives alternative anticancer treatment before documented PD was planned to be censored at the 
last date of radiographic assessment prior to receiving alternative anticancer treatment. Otherwise, 
subjects who do not have progression and are alive were planned to be censored at the last date of 
radiographic assessment without documented PD. Subjects who did not have any on study tumor 
assessments and did not die were planned to be censored on their date of randomization. 
Analysis model 
PFS was planned to be described using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimates. The primary analysis of PFS for 
the comparison between treatment arms was planned to be performed using a stratified log rank test 
with the stratification factors used in the randomization. Median PFS and its 95% CI as determined by 
the Brookmeyer and Crowley method with log-log transformation was planned to be presented and the 
K-M estimates of PFS were planned to be plotted over time. Hazard ratio of PFS and its 95% CI was 
planned to be estimated using Cox proportional-hazards model stratified by the same stratification 
factors used in the randomization. 
Timing of the primary analysis 
The primary analysis of PFS was planned to be carried out after approximately 350 subjects experience 
disease progression or death events according to the primary definition of PFS as assessed by BICR. 
4 analyses for the key secondary endpoint OS were planned (a descriptive analysis at the time of PFS 
analysis), two interim analyses for efficacy, performed when approximately a total of 272 (62% 
information fraction) and 350 (80% information fraction) death events have occurred, respectively, 
and a final OS analysis at 438 events. 
Multiplicity and interim analyses 
The overall type I error rate for this study was planned to be strictly controlled at a 2-sided alpha of 
0.05. 
The primary end point analysis of PFS assessed by BICR was planned to serve as the gatekeeper for 
the secondary end point analyses and be tested at the 2-sided alpha of 0.05. At PFS final analysis, OS 
was planned to be summarized descriptively only. 
The nominal 2-sided alpha of 0.00001 was planned to be spent even without formal hypothesis testing. 
If the primary PFS analysis is positive, analysis of the main secondary end point of OS was planned to 
be formally tested sequentially at the 2-sided alpha of 0.04999, ORR (assessed by BICR) and analysis 
for QOL was planned to be formally tested sequentially at the 2-sided alpha of 0.05, respectively, when 
the above hypotheses in the hierarchy are also statistically significant. For analysis of QOL, TTD of 
global health status/QOL, pain, and fatigue domains as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30 was planned to 
be tested using graphical approach of Maurer and Bretz to control multiplicity (Maurer 2013). A 
Assessment report  
EMA/319185/2023  
Page 45/163 
 
 
 
 
Bonferroni approach was planned to be used to control the type I error rate at 0.05 (2-sided) alpha for 
the 3 TTD hypothesis tests. 
The Lan-DeMets alpha spending function that approximates a Pocock approach was planned to be used 
to account for multiplicity introduced by including OS interim analyses for superiority. The first OS 
efficacy interim analysis was to be tested at the 2-sided significance level of 0.0363 if 62% of the 
death events (272/438) is available at the time of the analysis. If the first OS interim analysis is not 
positive, the second OS efficacy interim analysis was planned to be tested at the 2-sided significance 
level of 0.0206 if 80% of death events (350/438) is available at the time of the analysis. If neither of 
the interim analyses are positive, final analysis was planned to be tested at the 2-sided significance 
level of 0.0195. Alpha levels for the OS interim and final analyses were planned to be based on the 
actual observed events and be adjusted accordingly. 
Secondary efficacy analyses were planned to include the following: 
•  OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any 
cause. Subjects who are lost to follow-up and those who are alive at the date of data cut-off 
were planned to be censored at the date the subject was last known alive or date of data cut-
off, whichever occurs first. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319185/2023  
Page 46/163 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  ORR was defined as the proportion of subjects who have a best overall response of either CR 
or PR that is confirmed ≥ 4 weeks later according to BICR using RECIST 1.1. 
• 
TTD of global health status/QOL, pain, and fatigue domains of the EORTC QLQ-C30 was 
defined as the time between randomization and the time a subject experienced a deterioration 
(i.e., ≥ 10 points worsening from baseline in a given domain). 
At the time of primary analysis of PFS is performed, OS was planned to be summarized descriptively. 
No other formal treatment comparison for OS was planned to be performed at this time. 
The analysis of OS was planned to be described using K-M estimates. The primary analysis of OS for 
comparison between treatment arms was planned to be performed using a stratified log rank test with 
the same stratification factors used in the randomization. Median OS and the associated 95% CI as 
determined by the Brookmeyer and Crowley method with log-log transformation was to be presented. 
Hazard ratio and the associated 95% CI was planned to be estimated using a Cox proportional-hazards 
model stratified by the same stratification factors used in the randomization. 
ORR was planned to be analyzed and compared between the treatment arms using the Cochran 
Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by the stratification factors used in the randomization. The 2-
sided 95% CIs was planned to be calculated using the Clopper-Pearson exact method. 
Time to deterioration of global health status/QOL, pain, and fatigue domains as measured by EORTC 
QLQ-C30 was planned to be analyzed similarly as the primary analysis of PFS. 
Selected exploratory endpoints: Efficacy in relation to Trop-2 expression  
The Trop-2 Evaluable Population, defined as all participants in the Study IMMU-132-09 Intent-to-Treat 
(ITT) Population with baseline Trop-2 H-score values, was used for all analyses of Trop-2. The ITT 
Population included all participants who were randomized in the study, regardless of whether they 
received the study drug or not. 
To explore association of Trop-2 expression and clinical benefit, efficacy of SG versus TPC across Trop-
2 expression levels was assessed by dividing participants in the Trop-2 Evaluable Population into the 
following subgroups: 
Two subgroups with Trop-2 H-score < 100 and ≥ 100 
To further explore clinical benefit in participants with low or no Trop-2 expression, efficacy of SG 
versus TPC at lower Trop-2–expressing levels was assessed in the following subgroups: 
Trop-2 H-score ≤ 38 
  Quartile 1 of 4 equal-participant quartile subgroups (Trop-2 H-score ≤ 38, > 38 to ≤ 132, 
> 132 to ≤ 190, and > 190) 
 
Trop-2 H-score ≤ 10 
  A very low or no Trop-2–expressing subgroup of the quartile 1 subgroup above 
Trop-2 H-score 0 
For the subgroups of Trop-2 described above, PFS and OS were plotted using Kaplan-Meier curves, and 
median PFS and OS were derived by the Kaplan-Meier estimate with the associated 95% CI calculated 
by the Brookmeyer and Crowley method with log-log transformation. Hazard ratios of SG relative to 
TPC were estimated using an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model. 
Objective response rate and clinical benefit rate with 95% CI were calculated based on the Clopper-
Assessment report

Page 47/163 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pearson method. Medians of duration of response were derived based on the Kaplan-Meier method and 
the associated 95% CIs were based on the Brookmeyer and Crowley method with log-log 
transformation. 
The median Trop-2 H-score was 131.5 (range: 0-290).

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol (21 December 2018) was amended 7 times:  
Amendment 1 (France-specific; 03 July 2019)  
Amendment 2 (Germany-specific; 10 July 2019) 
Amendment 3 (global; never implemented; 04 February 2020) 
Assessment report  
EMA/319185/2023  
Page 50/163 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Amendment 4 (global; 13 March 2020) incorporated Amendments 1-3 
Key changes were (excerpt):  
•  Decreased the number of required unstained slides from archived biopsy/surgical specimens at 
screening from 12 to 6 slides 
•  Deleted the requirement that the archival tumor tissue had to be derived within 12 months 
prior to randomisation; new wording: “Availability of archival tumor tissue in a FFPE block 
(preferably within 12 months prior to consent)”. 
•  Added the infusion duration for SG 
•  Updated inclusion and exclusion criteria based on health authority recommendations and 
investigator questions and to ensure consistency with the investigator’s brochure and safety 
guidance (e.g., removal of Gilbert´s disease as exclusion criterion; entry criteria for ALP 
increased to ≤ 5.0 x IULN; contraception required for 6 months instead of 120 days after study 
drug discontinuation for females and for 3 months instead of 6 months for males; exclusion of 
subjects with blood uracil level ≥ 150 ng/ml from receiving capecitabine) 
•  Decreased the frequency of CT/MRI scans after the start of study drug (every 12 weeks after 
week 54 instead of every 9 weeks) 
•  Removed requirement for serum chemistry assessment on each treatment day for participants 
who received SG and removed PK sample collection on Day 8 
•  Added text to the determination of sample size to reflect the loss of events due to potential 
censoring 
Amendment 5 (global; 08 October 2020)  
• 
• 
• 
Increased the sample size from approximately 400 to 520 participants to account for withdrawal of 
consent, COVID-19 discontinuations, and possible dosing interruptions, and updated sample size 
assumptions in the Statistical Considerations section accordingly 
Increased the duration of enrolment from 17 to 24 months and the overall duration of the study 
from 48 to 52 months to be consistent with changes in sample size 
Increased the number of required death events for the secondary endpoint of OS (from 335 to 438 
OS events) and adjusted power assumptions accordingly (from 83% power to 91% power at a 2-
sided alpha of 0.05) 
Reason for change as provided in the protocol amendment: Sample size has been increased to account 
for withdrawal of consent, COVID 19 discontinuations and possible dosing interruptions. The power 
used for the secondary endpoint (OS) has been increased to reduce the possible risk of crossover 
effect when sacituzumab govitecan become commercially available on 22 Apr 2020. This risk of 
crossover effect was not considered at the time of initial statistical consideration 2 years ago. 
Amendment 6 (global; 27 January 2021) 
•  Revised the primary objective/endpoint to be assessed by BICR instead of LIR  
Reason for change as provided in the protocol amendment: To align with Health Authority 
requirements 
•  Removed the interim analysis based on ORR 
Assessment report  
EMA/319185/2023  
Page 51/163 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Moved ORR from a coprimary objective/endpoint to a secondary objective/endpoint 
Clarification as provided in the protocol amendment: Due to the increase in sample size and the actual 
enrolment rate, the Sponsor deem the time interval between the interim analysis and the targeted 
final PFS events not sufficiently long to warrant conducting the interim, thus elect not to conduct this 
interim analysis based on ORR, as originally specified in the protocol above. Thus, the ORR will be 
analyzed as a secondary endpoint. 
•  Revised alpha allocation to evaluate the primary endpoint of PFS and secondary endpoint of OS 
given that ORR was removed as a coprimary endpoint (“As the Sponsor elects to not conduct the 
planned interim analysis, 0.01 alpha allocated to evaluate ORR will be reverted back to primary 
endpoint PFS, which will be tested at the two-sided alpha of 0.05”). 
• 
Provided additional detail regarding the OS statistical analysis (“A descriptive, non-comparative 
analysis of OS will be performed when the primary analysis of PFS is performed; an administrative 
alpha of 0.00001 will be spent on this non-comparative analysis of OS. If PFS is positive, the 
secondary endpoint of OS will be formally tested when approximately 438 subjects have died at 
the alpha level of 0.04999 (i.e., step-down)”.)  
•  Added BICR assessment for the secondary objectives/endpoints of ORR, DOR, and CBR 
•  Added text to define PFS sensitivity analyses (“All three sensitivity analyses will be conducted on 
both BICR and LIR assessments”). 
•  Added text allowing for remote study monitoring due to COVID-19 
Amendment 7 (global; 23 August 2021) 
•  Added 2 interim analyses of OS between the PFS final analysis and the OS final analysis “to 
accommodate the long time-interval between PFS final analysis and OS final analysis”. Multiplicity 
control procedures have been added to control study level type I error rate at a 2-sided alpha of 
0.05.  
•  Removed PFS2 exploratory endpoint and analysis.  
•  Revised secondary and exploratory patient reported outcomes (PRO) objectives/endpoints such 
that only TTD in global health status/QOL, pain, and fatigue as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30 
remained secondary endpoints, and all other domains of the EORTC QLQ-C30 as well as EQ-5D-5L 
and PRO-CTCAE were moved from secondary endpoints to exploratory endpoints. 
•  Moved EQ-5D-5L and PRO-CTCAE from secondary objectives/endpoints to exploratory 
objectives/endpoints. 
•  Added 3 new subgroup analyses (early progressors [defined as progressing to metastatic disease 
within 1 year of neo/adjuvant therapy] [yes or no], baseline documented target or nontarget liver 
lesions per RECIST 1.1 [yes or no], and chemotherapy in neo/adjuvant setting [yes or no]). 
•  COVID related changes: Added text regarding the COVID-19 vaccine; clarified that off-site 
monitoring visits and remote source data verification were allowed if permitted by local regulation; 
Added an appendix describing the Pandemic Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plan. 
Changes from Planned Analyses 
Per the study protocol, at the time of the primary (final) PFS analysis, OS was to be summarized 
descriptively only, and the first interim OS analysis was estimated to occur after the primary (final) 
Assessment report  
EMA/319185/2023  
Page 52/163 
 
 
 
 
PFS analysis. However, as of 03 January 2022, the target number of events required for the first 
interim OS analysis was reached. At that time, 329 PFS events for the final PFS analysis were reached. 
Per the SAP, the sponsor conducted the final (and only) analysis of PFS and the first interim superiority 
analysis of OS together. 
Progression-free survival per LIR was a planned analysis as described in the study protocol, but was 
not listed as an endpoint in the study protocol. Progression-free survival per LIR was added as a 
secondary endpoint in the SAP.  
Sensitivity analyses of PFS per LIR were included in the study protocol. However, because sensitivity 
analyses were only required for the primary endpoint of PFS per BICR, sensitivity analyses of PFS per 
LIR were not planned in the SAP.  
The COVID-19 pandemic that began in early 2020 affected the operation of the study, and 
consequently, data collection. Some protocol-specified data points may not have been collected on 
schedule or even at all for participants who remain on treatment or for those who discontinued 
treatment but are still in follow-up. Listings of premature study drug or study discontinuation due to 
COVID-19, protocol deviations due to COVID-19, and AEs due to COVID-19 were provided to explore 
the extent to which COVID-19 may have affected inference from study results. Based on these listings, 
only a few participants were impacted by COVID-19; therefore, the impact of COVID-19 on the study 
results was considered minimal and no additional analyses were performed. 
Additional analyses not specified in the SAP were planned before data finalization of OS IA2 to further 
characterize the benefit and risk of the study treatment, including additional baseline characteristics, 
analyses of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) use, additional subgroup analyses of efficacy 
endpoints, subgroup analyses of key safety endpoints, summary of potential Hy’s Law cases, 
exposure-adjusted incidence rate (EAIR) of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and analyses 
of physical and role functioning per EORTC QLQ-C30 by mixed-effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM). After data finalization of PFS analysis (final) and OS IA1, the subgroup definition for early 
relapse was updated such that participants without chemotherapy in the neo/adjuvant setting were not 
considered as having had early relapse, instead of being categorized as unknown early relapse status. 
Ad hoc subgroup analyses of efficacy endpoints were provided using this updated definition. 
Conducted analyses 
Initially, ORR and PFS were planned as primary endpoints, with alpha=0.01 allocated to ORR and 
alpha=0.04 allocated to PFS. This was changed in amendment 6 and ORR was no longer planned as 
primary endpoint. 
Eventually, the analyses were conducted as indicated in the table below.

[a]   Analyses are prespecified in the Protocol Amendment 7 and statistical analysis plan Version 5.0. 
[b]   Actual number of primary PFS events was within ± 10% of the target 350 events. Full alpha is used at the final (and only) 
analysis for primary endpoint PFS.  
[c]   The P value boundaries at each analysis time point are adjusted by the Lan-DeMets alpha spending function that 
approximates a Pocock approach. 
[d]  Because statistical significance of OS was demonstrated, OS IA2 was considered the final test for OS. Any future analysis of 
OS will be considered descriptive only. 
Protocol deviations 
Table 14: Important Protocol Deviations (ITT Population) 
The denominator for percentages was the number of participants in the ITT Population for each treatment group. 
Participants with multiple IPDs were counted once in each category. 
Protocol Deviations Related to COVID-19 Pandemic Study Disruption 
Important protocol deviations due to COVID-19 were reported for 7 patients; 6/7 were related to 
efficacy assessments (3 patients had Week 6 or Week 12 scan not collected, 1 patient performed CT

Baseline data 
The median age of participants was 56.0 years (range: 27-86), and 25.8% of participants were ≥ 65 
years of age. Almost all participants were female (99.1%). The majority of participants were White 
(66.7%), 3.9% were Black or African American, and 2.9% were Asian. Participants were from the 
geographical regions of Europe (57.8%) and North America (42.2%). 
More participants had a screening ECOG performance status of 1 (55.6%) versus 0 (44.4%). The 
median time from metastatic disease diagnosis to randomization was approximately 4 years (47.8 
months [range: 1.2-248.8]). 
At baseline, participants had received a median of 7.0 prior systemic anticancer regimens (range: 3-
17), a median of 4.0 prior systemic chemotherapy regimens in any setting (range: 1-9), and a median 
of 3.0 prior systemic chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting (range: 0-8). The majority of 
participants had received chemotherapy in the neo/adjuvant setting (65.7%). Approximately 42% of 
patients had 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease compared to 58% of patients who 
had 3 to 4 prior chemotherapy regimens. All participants had received prior treatment with a CDK 4/6 
inhibitor, 66.5% were treated with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor for ≥ 6 months and 38.3% were treated with a 
CDK 4/6 inhibitor for > 12 months. All participants had received prior endocrine therapy, 86.4% of 
whom were treated with endocrine therapy for ≥ 6 months in the metastatic setting.

PFS per BICR  
At the primary PFS analysis (data cutoff date 03 January 2022), a statistically significant improvement 
in PFS per BICR using RECIST 1.1 was demonstrated with SG versus TPC (HR: 0.661; 95% CI: 0.529, 
0.826; P = 0.0003). Median PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI: 4.2, 7.0) in the SG group vs 4.0 months 
(95% CI: 3.1, 4.4) in the TPC group.

Because a statistically significant improvement in ORR was demonstrated in the SG group versus the 
TPC group, the time to deterioration of QOL endpoints was tested per the hierarchical testing strategy 
(a boundary of 0.05/3 for each of the 3 TTD hypothesis tests was used to control multiplicity). 
Analyses of TTD in the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/QOL, pain, and fatigue scales were 
conducted for participants in the HRQOL-Evaluable Population who had baseline global health 
status/QOL score ≥ 10, baseline pain score ≤ 90, and baseline fatigue score ≤ 90, respectively. 
A statistically significantly longer time to first deterioration in the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health 
status/QOL and fatigue domains was demonstrated in the SG group versus the TPC group (event rates 
90% vs 89% for SG vs TPC).  
No statistically significant difference in TTD in the EORTC QLQ-C30 pain domain was observed between 
the SG and TPC groups.

Exploratory endpoints  
PRO – Change from baseline in physical and role functioning domains 
An ad hoc exploratory analysis was conducted to evaluate the change from baseline in the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 physical functioning and role functioning domains using a mixed-effects model for repeated 
measures (MMRM). Between-group differences (SG vs TPC) in the overall least-squares mean (LSM) 
change from baseline were as follows: 
• 
• 
Physical Functioning: LSM difference 3.9; 95% CI: 0.87, 6.86; nominal P = 0.012 
Role Functioning: LSM difference 3.1; 95% CI: −1.15, 7.37; nominal P = 0.152 
Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analyses of PFS 
Results from predefined sensitivity analyses of PFS per BICR and additionally, results of ad hoc 
sensitivity analyses assessing the impact of imaging interval on PFS results were provided. These were 
overall consistent with the primary PFS analysis results (PFS HR 0.661 [0.53, 0.83]; median PFS 5.5 vs 
4 months for SG vs TPC in the primary PFS analysis).

Sensitivity Analyses of Overall Survival 
Two ad hoc sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of the timing of the OS analyses 
on the OS results. 
Ad Hoc Sensitivity Analysis Based on the First 351 OS Events 
At OS IA1, 12.2% (n=66) of participants was noted to be censored due to unknown/missing survival 
status. Additional public data searches (consistent with local regulations) were conducted to determine 
participant survival status; therefore, a number of additional OS events that occurred prior to the data 
cutoff date for OS IA1 (03 January 2022) were collected and included in OS IA2. 
The targeted number of events required for the OS IA2, approximately 350, was reached as of 01 July 
2022. Any events that occurred before the data cutoff date (01 July 2022) and were entered before 
database lock (09 August 2022) were included in the OS interim analyses. Therefore, OS IA2 was 
conducted based on a total of 390 OS events observed as of 01 July 2022. Given the observed number 
of OS events was greater than 110% of the targeted number of events, a sensitivity analysis was 
conducted based on the first 351 events (the 350th and 351st deaths occurred on the same date). 
Results of this ad hoc sensitivity analysis showed an improvement in OS in the SG group versus the 
TPC group (nominal P = 0.0060).

a  Based on the data cut at the 351st event date (27 January 2022) (350th and 351st deaths occurred on the same date). 
Ad Hoc Sensitivity Analysis Based on OS Events That Occurred Before the Data Cutoff for OS IA1 
Between OS IA1 and OS IA2, 97 OS events were entered into the clinical database. Of those 97 OS 
events, 40 had occurred before the data cutoff date for OS IA1 (03 January 2022). Therefore, a 
sensitivity analysis was conducted based on 333 (293 [number of observed events at OS IA1]+40) OS 
events that occurred before the data cutoff date for OS IA1 (03 January 2022). Results of this ad hoc 
sensitivity analysis showed an improvement in OS in the SG group versus the TPC group (nominal P = 
0.0158).

Ad Hoc OS Sensitivity Analysis in the Safety Population  
In line with PFS sensitivity analysis 3, an ad hoc sensitivity analysis was provided for OS in the safety 
population (all participants in the ITT Population who received at least 1 dose of study drug) to address 
the higher number of participants in the TPC group that were randomized but did not receive study 
drug.

PFS on next-line therapy (PFS2) at final analysis 
A longer median PFS2 was observed in the SG group versus the TPC group (hazard ratio: 0.709; 95% 
CI: 0.584, 0.860), median PFS was 9.8 months (95% CI: 8.2, 11.4) vs 7.4 months (95% CI: 6.7, 8.9) 
for SG arm vs TPC, respectively (data cutoff date 01 Dec 2022).

The HR was from an unstratified Cox regression analysis (including overall and subgroups). For each subgroup, the bar is the 
95% CI for the HR. An arrow indicates that the 95% CI was beyond the HR range in the forest plot. Prior chemotherapy regimens 
for treatment of metastatic disease, visceral metastasis, and endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting for ≥ 6 months were from 
IXRS. Early relapse was defined as relapse to metastatic disease within 1 year of the end of neo/adjuvant chemotherapy. 
Participants without chemotherapy in the neo/adjuvant setting were not considered as having had early relapse. For the 
investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (TPC) subgroup, the HR was obtained from comparison between SG and each TPC drug.

Trop-2 expression   
Exploratory analyses of the association of clinical benefit with Trop-2 expression  
The planned exploratory analyses of the association of clinical benefit with Trop-2 expression in 
participants treated with SG in Study IMMU-132-09 were based on tertile subgroups by Trop-2 H-
scores of < 100, ≥ 100 to ≤ 200, and > 200; however, there was an uneven distribution of 
participants between these subgroups: low Trop-2 expression (H-score < 100) was observed in 41.6% 
of participants, medium Trop-2 expression (H-score ≥ 100 to ≤ 200) in 40.0 % of participants, and 
high Trop-2 expression (H-score > 200) in 18.4% of participants in the Trop-2 Evaluable Population. 
Baseline Trop-2 expression was missing in 14.9% of participants.

Figure 27: Distribution of Trop-2 H-Scores in Tumor Tissue Samples from Participants in Study IMMU-
132-09 (Trop-2–Evaluable Population)  
Since Trop-2 expression status was not a stratification factor, the proportions of tertile H-Scores were 
not fully balanced between treatment arms (eg, H-Score > 200: n=50 (21%) in the SG group and 
n=35 (15.6%) in the TCP group) (Ad Hoc 11223 Table 1.1, not copied).    
Efficacy results by tertile subgroups of Trop-2 H-scores are presented as part of the forest plots of the 
subgroup analyses (see figures below):

SG Versus TPC in Trop-2 H-Score < 100 and ≥ 100 Subgroups 
Efficacy of SG versus TPC was assessed by dividing participants into two subgroups with Trop-2 H-
score instead of 3. The ≥ 100 to ≤ 200 and > 200 H-score subgroups from the tertile analysis were 
combined to define a single H-score ≥ 100 subgroup for comparison with the H-score < 100 subgroup.

SG Versus TPC in Trop-2 H-Score 0 Subgroup 
Overall, 25 participants (5.4%) were Trop-2 negative (n=10 in the SG arm and n=15 in the TPC arm). 
The ORR in participants in the SG group whose tumor tissues had no detectable Trop-2 expression by 
IHC (H-score 0) was 10%.

Design 
This study is an ongoing, open-label, randomized, multicenter, international 
Phase 3 study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of SG versus TPC 
in participants with metastatic or locally recurrent inoperable HR+/HER2− 
breast cancer who had progressed after a CDK 4/6 inhibitor, endocrine 
therapy, taxane, and at least 2 but no more than 4 prior chemotherapy 
treatment regimens for metastatic disease (1 of which could have been in the 
neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting if the development of unresectable, locally 
advanced, or metastatic disease occurred within 12 months) 
Duration of main phase: 
08 May 2019 – 03 January 2022 (last 
participant last visit for the primary analysis)

i.e, 1 of the following 
single-agent treatments 
SG 10 mg/kg was administered as an 
intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1 and Day 8 
of a 21-day treatment cycle. Treatment was 
continued until disease progression as 
determined by local investigator review (LIR) 
using RECIST 1.1, unacceptable toxicity, or 
other treatment discontinuation criterion was 
met. 
Eribulin (1.4 mg/m2 for North American sites, 
1.23 mg/m2 for European sites, or per 
institution) administered IV on Days 1 and 8 of a 
21-day cycle 
Capecitabine (1000 to 1250 mg/m2) 
administered orally twice daily for 2 weeks 
followed by a 1-week rest period given as a 21-
day cycle 
Gemcitabine (800 to 1200 mg/m2) administered 
IV on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle or 
per institution 
Vinorelbine (25 mg/m2) administered IV on Day 
1 of a weekly cycle or per institution (Note: 
participants with Grade 2 neuropathy were 
eligible for the study, but were not to receive 
vinorelbine as TPC.) 
Treatment was continued until disease 
progression as determined by LIR using RECIST 
1.1, unacceptable toxicity, or other treatment 
discontinuation criterion was met.

Study IMMU-132-01 was an uncontrolled, Phase 1/2 basket study in which SG monotherapy was 
evaluated in metastatic epithelial cancers who had either relapsed or were refractory after at least 1 
standard therapeutic regimen for their tumor type.  
The study included 54 participants with HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer, whose disease 
progressed on endocrine-based therapy and at least 1 prior chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer 
in the metastatic setting and who were treated with the 10 mg/kg dose regimen.

study. Dose escalation halted after the 18-mg/kg dose, and the 10-mg/kg dose was determined as the 
recommended Phase 2 dose for the remainder of the study.

esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, hepatocellular, renal (clear cell), papillary thyroid, and urothelial cancers. 
Participants with glioblastoma multiforme were also eligible but were not required to have metastatic disease. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of Phase 2 in Study IMMU 132 01 was ORR per RECIST v1.1 as assessed 
by local investigator review (LIR). Key secondary efficacy endpoints included OS, PFS, and DOR. 
Baseline characteristics in Study IMMU-132-01 were similar to those of participants in the pivotal 
Study IMMU-132-09 with the majority of patients being White (78%) and ≤65 years of age (80%). 
About 60% had received prior CDK 4/6 inhibitor treatment in Study IMMU-132-01 (as opposed to 
100% in IMMU-132-09).  Patients had to have received at least 1 prior chemotherapy for metastatic 
breast cancer (as opposed to 2 prior lines in Study IMMU-132-09).

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The open-label, randomized Phase 3 study IMMU-132-09 evaluated the efficacy of SG versus TPC as 
control in 543 participants with metastatic HR+/HER2− breast cancer. Patients had been treated with a 
CDK 4/6 inhibitor, endocrine therapy, taxane, and at least 2 but no more than 4 prior chemotherapy 
treatment regimens for metastatic disease (1 of which could be in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting 
if development of unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease occurred within 12 months). 
The dose regimen of SG for Study IMMU-132-09 (10 mg/kg D1 and D8, Q3W) is the same as already 
approved for the treatment of patients with TNBC. It was selected based on results from the dose 
escalation and expansion phases of Study IMMU-132-01 in metastatic epithelial cancers, which is 
acceptable.

The randomized study design of IMMU-132-09 and the stratification factors are overall endorsed. Given 
the choice of different treatment options in the control arm, the open-label design is acceptable. 
Overall, the eligibility criteria were considered adequate to select an advanced HR+/HER2- mBC 
population and the choice of comparator treatments were acceptable for this pre-treated patient 
population. However, it is noted that patients were required to be pre-treated with a taxane, but not 
with an anthracycline, which is also recommended as preferable and efficacious treatment options for 
HR+/HER2- BC. Anthracycline was not included as a possible treatment option in the control arm, since 
“these agents are typically given earlier for breast cancer” as claimed by the MAH. The majority of 
study participants had received prior anthracycline, but 20% had not. Considering the toxicity profile of 
anthracyclines, this proportion of patients might represent clinical practice.  Given the consistent 
efficacy outcomes across both subgroups, the risk of undertreatment in the comparator arm could be 
considered limited.   
HER2 and hormonal receptor status was determined locally on a recently or newly obtained tumor 
biopsy, as agreed in the scientific advice. It is however noted that HER2 negativity was defined as IHC 
≤ 2+ or fluorescence in situ hybridization negative. The IMMU-132-09 protocol did not require HER2 
IHC2+ patients to be tested negative by fluorescence in situ hybridization (ISH) to confirm HER2-
negativity which is not fully in line with the definition of HER2-negativity according to the ASCO/CAP 
criteria. Thirty-nine participants (17 participants in the SG group and 22 participants in the TPC group) 
were verified to have IHC2+ only without ISH-negative confirmation captured in the database. 
Sensitivity analyses of PFS and OS at the final OS data cutoff (01 December 2022) excluding the 39 
participants with IHC2+ only without ISH negative confirmation were overall consistent with the results 
of the ITT population. This suggests that the inclusion of these patients did not have a major impact on 
the study results. It is however relevant that the SmPC reflects the correct definition of HER2-
negativity according to current standard. 
An archival tumor tissue or a newly acquired biopsy from a metastatic site had to be submitted to the 
Sponsor´s central laboratory by C2D1, but analysis results were not required from the central 
laboratory prior to enrolment. Thus, adequacy of the tumor biopsy for e.g. determination of Trop-2 
expression status could not be guaranteed for all patients.  
The MAH initially proposed following indication: “Trodelvy as monotherapy is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH–) breast cancer 
who have received endocrine-based therapy and at least two additional systemic therapies in the 
metastatic setting (see section 5.1)”. The indication wording aims at a population with an advanced 
endocrine-resistant HR+/HER2− breast cancer population after prior standard treatments. It is 
considered acceptable not to explicitly state that patients need to have exhausted all possible 
hormonal treatments, since several lines of endocrine-based therapies (± targeted therapies) are 
recommended as standard treatments before chemotherapy (for patients without risk of organ failure, 
ESMO guidelines).  
Since the eligibility criteria for Study IMMU-132-09 required at least 2 prior systemic chemotherapy 
regimens for metastatic disease, the more general wording of “at least two additional systemic 
therapies” required further justification. Given the recent approval of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) 
for the treatment of HER2-low (IHC 1+ or 2+/FISH−) breast cancer, T-DXd is a valid treatment option 
for patients with HER2-low BC prior to the use of SG and CHMP questioned whether an extrapolation 
could be acceptable to allow prior treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan as one prior systemic 
therapy instead of conventional chemotherapy. It has to be considered that both ADCs (SG and T-DXd) 
have different targets but similar payloads with similar mechanism of action (both topoisomerase 
inhibitors) which make resistance very likely. The MAH argued that, with a different antigen target and 
Assessment report  
EMA/319185/2023  
Page 96/163 
 
 
 
evidence suggesting that resistance is not entirely determined by the payload (Abelman et al, Cancers, 
2023), SG may be effective after T-DXd. Currently, there are no clinical data to determine the benefit 
of SG after T-DXd. While the concerns regarding expected resistance to the similar payload are still 
considered valid, it is acknowledged that other mechanisms of resistance to T-DXd might leave SG as 
an effective treatment option even after failure of T-DXd.  
Further, in the context of required pre-treatments the MAH revised “metastatic” to “advanced” since 
the current indication wording could include patients with unresectable BC that could not have received 
prior treatment for metastatic disease. Finally, the Applicant accepted deletion of spelling out “human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2” and the definition of HER2-negativity from the indication to 
improve readability.  
The claim to treat patients with unresectable BC in the advanced setting has not been supported by 
data, because the pivotal study explicitly required inclusion of patients with metastatic disease; 2 
participants were enrolled with M0 disease as protocol deviations. Nonetheless, an extrapolation can be 
considered acceptable, since locally advanced disease are not treated differently in clinical practice and 
the assumption of a heterogeneous treatment effect between disease settings would not be likely.   
The planned efficacy analyses are overall considered adequate. However, relevant planned and 
unplanned changes were introduced rather late in this open-label study. The sample size and number 
of required OS events was increased, eventually the primary PFS analysis was conducted before 
reaching the prespecified number of PFS events (329/350). Initially, ORR and PFS had been planned as 
primary endpoints, with α=0.01 allocated to ORR and α=0.04 to PFS. ORR was downgraded to a 
secondary endpoint in a late amendment, following Scientific Advice. The applicant provided 
reassurance that PFS results were robust and the choice of timing of the analysis did not relevantly 
affect the interpretation. Results of an updated analysis using PFS data from the “final” data cut-off 
were consistent with the primary results. Further, the Applicant conducted a tipping point analysis as 
requested to investigate the sensitivity of the primary PFS analysis to the decision to analyse or wait. 
These analyses suggest that results could not have been substantially different, even if the sponsor 
had waited until 350 PFS events. This provides reassurance that the timing of data-cut-off/analysis did 
not matter. 
The study randomized 543 patients across 82 centers in Europe and the US during May 2019 and April 
2021. A higher proportion of patients in the control arm were randomized but not treated or 
discontinued treatment early due to consent withdrawal (16% in the TPC group vs 5% in the SG 
group). In view of the open-label study, this is likely due to patients´ preference for experimental 
treatment. Tipping-point analyses (data not shown) provided by the applicant provided good 
reassurance that results are robust despite this imbalance.  
Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between both treatment 
arms and reflect a heavily pre-treated patient population with a median of 7 prior systemic anticancer 
regimens overall and 3 prior chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting. Although the study 
population can be considered overall representative of the target population, some characteristics still 
suggest selection of a study population with overall more favourable prognosis compared to a general 
metastatic HR+/HER2− BC population (e.g. long median time of approximately 4 years from 
metastatic disease diagnosis to randomization, 30% screen failures, low proportions of patients with 
≥75 years of age (4.4%) and brain metastasis (4.6%)). Moreover, the low proportion of Black study 
participants (3.9%) is considered a drawback, given the high rate of patients homozygous for the 
UGT1A1*28 allele (please refer to safety in special populations). While the proportion of men in the 
study program is very low, it is still considered possible to extrapolate results to men, based on the 
common biological and pharmacological rationale.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy data were provided for two data cutoff dates. The primary (final) analysis for PFS was 
conducted with a cutoff date of 03 Jan 2022. The PFS analysis per BICR met statistical significance 
with a HR of 0.661 (95% CI 0.54, 0.83) in favour of SG vs TPS; an only modest improvement of 1.5 
months was observed for median PFS (5.5 vs 4.0 months in the SG and TPC groups). PFS sensitivity 
analyses provided consistent results.  
The first interim analysis of OS was performed together with primary PFS analysis and showed a trend 
of improved OS in the SG group versus the TPC group (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.67, 1.06). At the data 
cutoff of 01 July 2022, the second interim analysis of OS met statistical significance for SG vs TPC (OS 
HR 0.789; 95% CI: 0.646, 0.964; P = 0.0200; [P-value boundary 0.0223]). An improvement of 3.2 
months in median OS was observed for SG over TPC (14.4 vs 11.2 months) which can be considered 
clinically relevant also in view of the heavily pre-treated study population. Two ad hoc sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to assess the impact of deviations from the planned timing of the OS 
analyses; these indicated that the changes appeared not to have a relevant impact on the OS results.  
Updated PFS and OS data at the final data cutoff of 01 December 2022 were provided and confirmed 
the previous results. PFS2 data also supported the benefit of SG over TPC: A longer median PFS2 was 
shown in the SG group versus the TPC group (9.8 [95% CI: 8.2, 11.4] vs 7.4 months [95% CI: 6.7, 
8.9] for SG arm vs TPC; HR 0.709 [95% CI: 0.584, 0.860], data cutoff date 01 Dec 2022).  
Analyses of other secondary endpoints have been presented with the later data cutoff of 01 July 2022 
and can be considered overall supportive. Statistically significant more patients had an ORR per BICR 
in the SG group than in the TPC group (n=57 [21%] vs n=38 [14%]). However, the considerably 
higher number of not evaluable patients in the TPC group (n=51 for TPC vs n=15 for SG) raised some 
uncertainty on the extent of effect of SG on ORR. The MAH provided sensitivity analyses to address 
uncertainty due to imbalances in patients with not evaluable response. A conservative sensitivity 
analysis with a “jump to reference” like imputation for NE response resulted in a considerably smaller 
but still favourable effect estimate (Odds Ratio under conservative assumptions: 1.38). 
Response assessment by local investigator review and results for DOR showed numerically higher 
response rates and longer response duration in the SG group versus the TPC group.  
Time to deterioration of QOL endpoints was tested per the hierarchical testing strategy. A statistically 
significantly longer time to first deterioration in the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/QOL and 
fatigue domains was demonstrated in the SG group versus the TPC group (median 4.3 vs 3 and 2.2 vs 
1.1 months for GHS/QOL and fatigue, respectively).  No statistically significant difference was observed 
for the pain domain between both treatment groups (3.8 vs 3.5 months for SG vs TPC, respectively). 
Exploratory analysis of change from baseline in the physical functioning and role functioning domains 
showed similar results for both treatment arms with a small trend in favour of the SG group versus the 
TPC group. It is considered reassuring that for the average of study population, the toxicity of SG did 
not appear to have negatively impacted quality of life as compared to the control arm. However, the 
validity of the PRO results has to be viewed in the context of the open-label trial design. The PRO data 
were not included in the SmPC due to the concern that PRO results might be impacted by a possible 
bias introduced by the open-label study design. 
Overall, subgroup analyses showed longer median PFS and OS and higher ORR values in the SG 
groups versus the TPC groups with some exceptions. In participants without visceral metastases OS 
HR was 2.63 (95% CI 0.95, 7.29; n = 26) and no PFS benefit was observed for participants who 
received prior endocrine therapy for less than 6 months (n = 74). However, results were not fully 
consistent across endpoints and the small sample sizes hampers a conclusive interpretation of these 
findings.  
Assessment report  
EMA/319185/2023  
Page 98/163 
 
 
 
TPC was determined by the investigator before randomization, but TPC was not included as 
stratification factor. Eribulin was used most commonly (48.0%), followed by vinorelbine (23%), 
gemcitabine (21%), and capecitabine (8%). Highly variable efficacy results were observed. The worst 
outcome was detected for patients treated with vinorelbine (ORR 3.2%, and 1.5 and 8.3 months for 
median PFS and OS) and the most favourable outcome was detected for patients treated with 
capecitabine (ORR 27.3%, and 5.6 and 20.1 months for median PFS and OS). SG did not appear to 
derive any benefit compared to treatment with capecitabine. These results are difficult to interpret due 
to the small sample size and differences in prognostic factors in the capecitabine subgroup (n=22). 
HRs were obtained from comparison between SG (overall) and each TPC drug, which did not take 
potential differences in baseline characteristics into account. Results from efficacy analyses of PFS, OS 
and ORR stratified by physician’s choice of chemotherapy agent in the ITT population (evaluating the 
treatment effect of SG vs TPC by providing odds ratio for ORR and HRs for PFS and OS for the 
subgroups of patients as determined to be treated by each chemotherapy agent prior to 
randomization) were provided. These analyses did not provide substantially different results. The 
heterogeneous subgroup results by TPC remain difficult to interpret also with the updated analysis. 
Overall, it has to be acknowledged that the subgroup results do not appear plausible, and the sample 
sizes are too small to draw reliable conclusions on a differential effect in subgroups by TPC. 
Efficacy analyses by Trop-2 expression were performed in the Trop-2 Evaluable Population (baseline 
Trop-2 expression was missing in 14.9%). Questions were raised to the MAH regarding the analytical 
validation of the used Trop-2 Immunohistochemistry Assay to evaluate whether patient’s Trop-2 
testing results are sufficiently robust and reliable, considering also the retrospectively defined clinical 
cut-offs.  
It was clarified that the analytical validation approach for the Trop-2 expression IHC assay for the 
concerned IMMU-132-09 trial was intended for a retrospective / explorative testing setting. Regarding 
this “retrospective / exploratory” intended purpose the assay could be considered as suitable. 
However, since some essential analytical validation studies were not fully performed (e.g. full 
validation of “precision” [Intra- and Inter-Assay Reproducibility] for ER+ BC, full analytical validation at 
the different clinical cut-offs, or epitope stability evaluation), the (retrospectively/exploratory) obtained 
results in the IMMU-132-09 trial cannot be considered as being similarly robust and reliable as 
achievable for an assay analytically fully validated at pre-specified cut-offs in the (HR+ BC) target 
cells. In addition, age of used tumor tissue FFPE blocks was between 2 and 5 years for 28% and 8% of 
tumor tissue was more than 5 years old.  Apart from the technical question of uncertain epitope 
stability, it might be questioned whether the biomarker status of a >5-year-old sample is still 
representative of the tumor at the time of enrolment. A dynamic change of the tumor biology and its 
environment may be assumed that is also likely impacted by prior treatments. In consequence, these 
limitations regarding an adequate robustness of the data should be considered when interpreting the 
testing result data (see below). 
Planned exploratory subgroup analyses were based on tertile subgroups by Trop-2 H-scores of < 100, 
≥ 100 to ≤ 200, and > 200, leading to an uneven distribution with 41.6% of participants in the low 
Trop-2 expression group and 18.4% in the high Trop-2 expression group. Efficacy data indicated a 
possible association of benefit with Trop-2 expression levels, as there was a numerical increase in 
median PFS with higher Trop-2 expression (median PFS was 5.3, 5.8, and 6.4 months for the < 100, ≥ 
100 to ≤ 200, and > 200 subgroups, respectively). PFS and OS HRs favoured treatment with SG over 
the control arm in the low and medium Trop-2 subgroups; however, for patients with high Trop-2-
expressing tumors, no PFS and OS benefit of SG relative to TPC was observed that did not appear 
plausible considering the mechanism of action of SG. Moreover, in view of the large size of the low 
Trop-2 expression group, a more in-depth analysis was considered necessary to analyse clinical benefit 
of SG in participants with low or no Trop-2 expression.

The MAH provided results from additional exploratory analyses to further explore association of Trop-2 
expression and clinical benefit. Efficacy of SG versus TPC was assessed by dividing participants into 
two subgroups with Trop-2 H-score < 100 and ≥ 100. To examine whether a minimum level of Trop-2 
expression is required for clinical benefit with SG, efficacy of SG versus TPC at lower Trop-2–
expressing levels was assessed in participants with H-score ≤ 38 (Quartile 1 of 4 equal-participant 
quartile subgroups), in participants with Trop-2 H-score ≤ 10, as well as in participants without Trop-2 
expression (see Trop-2 expression data in section “ancillary analyses” for detailed results). 
The additionally provided efficacy data indicate that patients with low and no Trop-2 expression might 
benefit less from SG compared to patients with higher Trop-2 tumor expression levels. This is 
suggested by higher PFS HRs for SG vs TPC in the lower Trop-2 expression groups (PFS HR 0.74 vs 
0.59 and 0.49 for Q1, Q2 and Q3, respectively). In the subgroup of patients with even lower Trop-2 
expression of ≤ 10, the PFS HR was 0.89 (95% CI 0.51, 1.57). For patients with no detectable Trop-2 
expression (H-Score 0, n=10), SG resulted in an ORR of 10% (as compared to 21% in the ITT). 
However, it is acknowledged that results from small subgroups have to be interpreted with caution and 
are more likely to be impacted by heterogeneity.  
Overall, Trop-2 expression data suggest an association of Trop2 expression with efficacy of SG, but the 
evidence of the provided data is not considered valid enough to determine a cutoff of Trop-2 
expression below that patients would certainly not derive any benefit from SG. Thus, a restriction of 
the indication to a subgroup of patients with higher Trop-2 tumor expression is not considered 
justified. It has however to be emphasized that any conclusions on efficacy by Trop-2 expression is 
hampered by the retrospective/explorative testing and the described deficiencies regarding analytical 
and clinical validation.   
Efficacy results in the small cohort of 54 HR+/HER2− mBC patients of Study IMMU-132-01 can be 
overall considered supportive for the proposed indication. Response rates of SG, as evaluated by local 
assessment, were higher compared to results in the pivotal Study IMMU-132-09 (ORR by LIR 31.5% in 
IMMU-132-01 vs 16.2% ORR by LIR and 21% ORR per BICR in IMMU-132-09). However, these 
differences might be attributed to the small sample size in the non-randomized cohort of Study IMMU-
132-01 and due to differences in patient populations with more intensive pre-treatment in the pivotal 
study.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy data were provided from a randomized Phase 3 study in heavily pre-treated patients with 
HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer. Sacituzumab govitecan demonstrated statistically significant 
improvements in PFS and OS over an acceptable comparator of TPC with single-agent chemotherapies. 
The overall data package can be considered relevant to demonstrate the efficacy of SG in this 
advanced disease setting.    
2.5.  Clinical safety 
All safety analyses were conducted based on the Safety Population, which was defined as all 
participants in the ITT Population who received at least 1 dose of study drug and included data up to 
the cutoff date of 01 July 2022.

[1]  The ISS populations called the Study IMMU-132-01 HR+/HER2− mBC group and Overall Targeted HR+/HER2− mBC 
pool are not presented in the table. 
EAIR is defined as the number of participants with a specific event divided by the total exposure time (in years) in each group (ie, 
PYE). For participants without specific events, exposure time was calculated from first dose date up to data cutoff date if the 
participants were on study drug, or up to last dose if the participant discontinued study drug. For each specific event, total 
exposure time is the sum of exposure time over all participants in each group. Poisson distribution with exact method was applied 
to compute the 95% CI of EAIR. The method of variance estimates recovery was used to compute the 95% CI of the difference 
between 2 EAIRs.

[1]  The ISS populations called the Study IMMU-132-01 HR+/HER2− mBC group and Overall Targeted HR+/HER2− mBC 
pool are not presented in the table. 
[2]  This table presents only those PTs that occurred in ≥ 10% of participants in the ISS groups shown. In the source table, the 
frequencies of the SOCs are based on all PTs under the SOC, not only the PTs of treatment-related AEs reported in ≥ 10% of 
participants. 
Denominator for percentages was big N. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events are defined as any AEs that started on or after the first dose date and up to 30 days after the 
last dose date. 
Treatment-related is defined as events reported as “Possibly Related,” “Related,” or missing; “Unlikely Related” or “Not Related” 
is not included. 
Multiple adverse events are counted only once per participant for each SOC and PT. MedDRA Version 25.0 was used for coding. 
System organ classes were presented alphabetically and PTs within SOC were presented by descending order of the total 
frequencies. 
The following terms are mapped: Neutrophil count decreased  Neutropenia, White blood cell count decreased  Leukopenia, 
Lymphocyte count decreased  Lymphopenia, Haemoglobin decreased  Anaemia, Red blood cell count decreased  
Anaemia, Platelet count decreased  Thrombocytopenia.

Diarrhoea 
Adverse Events of Diarrhoea 
Adverse events and treatment-related AEs of diarrhoea occurred in a higher percentage of participants 
in the SG group (61.9% and 56.7% of participants, respectively) than in the TPC group (22.9% and 
16.9% of participants, respectively) in Study IMMU-132-09. One participant (0.4%) discontinued SG 
treatment in Study IMMU-132-09 because of diarrhoea (Table 57). 
The percentage of participants with diarrhoea was generally similar in participants across the Overall 
Targeted HR+/HER2– mBC, Overall Targeted mBC, and All Treated SG pools.

Time to Onset and Duration of Diarrhoea 
Median time to onset of the first event of diarrhoea was shorter in the SG group versus the TPC group 
(15 vs 38 days, respectively), and the median time to onset of the first event of Grade 3 or higher 
diarrhoea was shorter in the SG group compared with the TPC group (16 versus 28 days, respectively) 
in Study IMMU-132-09.  
The median time to first onset, median duration of diarrhoea, and Grade 3 or higher diarrhoea were 
similar in the individual Study IMMU-132-01 HR+/HER2− mBC group, the Overall Targeted 
HR+/HER2– mBC pool, and the broader Overall Targeted mBC and All Treated SG pools.  
Management of Diarrhoea 
In Study IMMU-132-09, a higher percentage of participants in the SG group (88.6%, 109 participants) 
compared with the TPC group (81.8%, 18 participants) received antidiarrheal medication. In the SG 
group, 1 participant (0.8%), who was on antidiarrheal medication, permanently discontinued study 
drug due to diarrhoea. For participants in the SG group receiving antidiarrheal medication, 
6 participants (4.9%) experienced diarrhoea events leading to study drug interruption and 
21 participants (17.1%) experienced diarrhoea events leading to study drug dose reduction. 
Demographic characteristics and prior systemic anticancer therapy were similar in participants who 
used antidiarrheal medications and participants who did not use antidiarrheal medications.

Time to Onset and Duration of Neutropenia+ 
Median time to onset of the first event of neutropenia+ in the SG and TPC groups in 
Study IMMU-132-09 was 19 and 15 days, respectively, and the median time to onset of the first event 
of Grade 3 or higher neutropenia+ was 16 and 15 days, respectively.  
The median time to first onset and duration of TEAEs and treatment-related TEAEs of neutropenia+ 
and Grade 3 or higher neutropenia+ were similar across individual Study IMMU-132-01 HR+/HER2− 
mBC group, Overall Targeted HR+/HER– mBC pool, and the broader Overall Targeted mBC and All 
Treated SG pools.  
Management of Neutropenia+ 
G-CSF use at any time during the study includes participants with at least 1 G-CSF medication taken 
before the first dose date and ongoing while on treatment, or G-CSF medications taken on or after the 
first dose date and up to 30 days after the last dose. G-CSF initiation is defined as the start date of 
G-CSF administration between the first study drug dose date up to 30 days after the last study drug 
dose date.

The number of participants with G-CSF use and G-CSF initiation at any time during the study was 
higher in the SG group compared with the TPC group in Study IMMU-132-09 (G-CSF use: 54.1% vs 
34.1%, respectively; G-CSF initiation: 53.7% vs 33.7%, respectively). In the SG group, 32.8% and 
31.7% of participants used and initiated G-CSF in Cycle 1, respectively, compared with 18.9% and 
18.5% in the TPC group, respectively, in Study IMMU-132-09.  
The percentage of participants who received G-CSF as prophylaxis at any time during the study was 
higher in the SG group compared with the TPC group (35.4% vs 21.7%, respectively) (ISS IA2, 
Table 14.1.5.4). The majority of participants in the SG and TPC groups with Grade 3 or higher 
neutropenia+ initiated G-CSF in Cycle 1.

Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as any AEs that started on or after the first dose date and up to 30 days after the last dose 
date. 
Treatment-related is defined as events reported as “Possibly Related,” “Related,” or missing; “Unlikely Related” or “Not Related” 
is not included. 
Severity grades were defined by CTCAE: 1 = Mild; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Severe; 4 = Life-Threatening; 5 = Death. 
Adverse events leading to study drug dose reduction were not collected in IMMU-132-01, therefore IMMU-132-01 participants 
were excluded from denominator for percentages of TEAEs leading to study drug dose reduction. 
See definitions of AEs of special interest in the statistical analysis plan, clinical study report, and/or Summary of Clinical Safety.

Severity grades were defined by CTCAE Version 5.0. 
For maximum postbaseline toxicity grade, the most severe graded abnormality from all tests was counted for each participant. 
For each individual laboratory test, the most severe graded abnormality for that test was counted for a participant. 
A treatment-emergent laboratory abnormality was defined as an increase of at least 1 toxicity grade from baseline at any time 
postbaseline up to and including the date of last study drug dose plus 30 days. If the relevant baseline laboratory value is 
missing, any abnormality of at least Grade 1 observed within the time frame specified above will be considered treatment 
emergent.

The majority of participants had at least 1 graded laboratory abnormality; the incidence of laboratory 
abnormalities was similar in individual Study IMMU 132 09 SG group, Study IMMU 132 01 HR+/HER2− 
mBC group, and the 3 ISS pooled populations.  
In Study IMMU 132 09, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities was 64.9% (172 
participants) in the SG group and 49.2% (119 participants) in the TPC group. The incidence of Grade 4 
laboratory abnormalities was 26.0% (69 participants) in the SG group and 18.6% (45 participants) in 
the TPC group.  
The most commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 haematology laboratory abnormalities in both treatment 
groups were decreased neutrophils (SG: 52.5%; TPC: 40.2%), decreased leukocytes (SG: 38.1%; 
TPC: 25.7%), and decreased lymphocytes (SG: 21.1%; TPC: 13.7%) in Study IMMU-132-09.  
The percentage of SG-treated participants with Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities was similar in 
individual Study IMMU 132 09 SG group, Study IMMU 132 01 HR+/HER2− mBC group, and the 3 ISS 
pooled populations.  
Adverse drug reactions 
The analysis of safety from the clinical development of Trodelvy for the treatment of hormone 
receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2−) metastatic 
breast cancer (mBC) comprised 6 cohorts as presented in the Integrated Analysis of Safety.  
CIOMS frequency provided in the List of Adverse Reactions (Table 66) are that of the frequency 
observed with the larger pooled population of the Overall Targeted mBC sample size (n=688). The 
crude frequencies of potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were based on all events coded to 
individual Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms with the exception of 
the terms anaemia, dyspnoea, fatigue, hypersensitivity, leukopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, 
neutropenic colitis, and thrombocytopenia. The counting of these ADRs was based on a defined 
collection of preferred terms with similar medical concept to attempt to provide a complete and 
inclusive estimate of crude frequency for these ADRs. 
To identify potential new ADRs, the same algorithm was applied to the new Overall Targeted 
HR+/HER2- mBC that was utilized for the initial Trodelvy EU marketing authorization application: 
- TEAEs observed in ≥1.0% of participants in the Overall Targeted mBC pooled population (n=688) 
and 
- with a ≥2.0% higher frequency in the Overall Targeted HR+/HER2− pooled population (N=322) than 
the treatment of physician’s choice (TPC) group (n=249) of IMMU-132-09 TEAEs meeting this 
algorithm were considered to be a potential ADR for inclusion in the List of Adverse Reactions.

Safety in special populations 
Race 
Only 19 Black or African American were included (7 participants [2.6%] and 12 participants [4.8%] in 
the SG vs TPC arm, respectively). All black patients had a neutropenia, 86% nausea and 57% 
diarrhoea, fatigue, and leukopenia.  
Age 
Most participants in the SG and TPC groups in Study IMMU 132 09 were < 65 years of age (73.1% and 
75.5%, respectively). The incidence of common AEs across the age subgroups was similar in the SG 
and TPC groups in Study IMMU 132 09. Within the SG group, the most common AEs in the < 65 years 
of age group were neutropenia (72.4%), nausea (59.7%), and diarrhoea (57.1%). The most common

AEs in the ≥ 65 years of age group were diarrhoea (75.0%), neutropenia (65.3%), and nausea 
(55.6%).

Within the SG group, the incidence of AEs, Grade 3 or higher AEs, AEs leading to dose reduction, AEs 
leading to dose interruption, and AEs leading to death were similar across the age subgroups in Study 
IMMU-132-09.  Serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed with SG with increasing age: For 
patients with age <65 years 21.9% and for the patients of more than 65 years of age, the incidences 
were 43.1%.

AE = adverse event; CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; ISS = integrated summary of safety; 
mBC = metastatic breast cancer; SAE = serious adverse event; SG = sacituzumab govitecan; TEAE = treatment-emergent 
adverse event 
The denominator for percentages was the number of participants in each subgroup. 
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as any AEs that started on or after the first dose date and up to 30 days after the last dose 
date. 
Treatment-related is defined as events reported as 'Possibly Related', 'Related' or missing; 'Unlikely Related' or 'Not Related' is not 
included. 
Severity grades were defined by CTCAE: 1 = Mild; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Severe; 4 = Life-Threatening; 5 = Death. 
AEs Leading to Study Drug Dose Reduction were not collected in IMMU-132-01, therefore IMMU-132-01 subjects were 
excluded from denominator for percentages of TEAEs Leading to Study Drug Dose Reduction.

[1]  The ISS populations called the Study IMMU-132-01 HR+/HER2− mBC group, Study IMMU-132-09 TPC group, and 
Overall Targeted HR+/HER2− mBC pool are not presented in the table. 
The denominator for percentages was the number of patients in each subgroup. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events are defined as any AEs that started on or after the first dose date and up to 30 days after the 
last dose date. 
Treatment-related is defined as events reported as “Possibly Related,” “Related,” or missing; “Unlikely Related” or “Not Related” 
is not included. 
AEs Leading to Study Drug Dose Reduction were not collected in IMMU-132-01, therefore IMMU-132-01 participants were 
excluded from denominator for percentages of TEAEs Leading to Study Drug Dose Reduction.

Multiple adverse events are counted only once per participant for each SOC and PT. MedDRA Version 25.0 was used for coding. 
System organ classes are presented alphabetically and PTs within SOC are presented by descending order of the total frequencies. 
The following terms are mapped: Neutrophil count decreased  Neutropenia, White blood cell count decreased  Leukopenia, 
Lymphocyte count decreased  Lymphopenia, Haemoglobin decreased  Anaemia, Red blood cell count decreased  
Anaemia, Platelet count decreased  Thrombocytopenia.

Febrile neutropenia was the only AE leading to discontinuation in > 1 participant; it was reported in 
2 participants (1.8%) with the UGT1A1*28/*28 allele and 1 participant (0.2%) with the UGT1A1*1/*1 
allele in the All Treated SG pooled population  
Adverse Events Leading to Dose Reduction 
Adverse events leading to dose reduction were reported in a higher percentage of participants who 
were either homozygous or heterozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele compared with participants who 
were homozygous for the UGT1A1*1 allele (40.0% and 41.2% vs 25.2%, respectively) in Study IMMU-
132-09  
Adverse Events Leading to Study Drug Interruption 
Adverse events leading to study drug interruption were reported in a higher percentage of participants 
who were homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele compared with participants who were either 
heterozygous or homozygous for the UGT1A1*1 allele (76.0% vs 63.9% and 68.0%, respectively) in

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data has been provided for 688 patients that received SG 10 mg/kg in the breast cancer pool 
(BC pool: HR+/HER2- BC (proposed indication) and TNBC patients (approved indication)). The other 
safety population of interest are patients from the pivotal study IMMU-132-09 (HR+/HER2- breast 
cancer; n=268 who received SG). The size of the safety data available on breast cancer patients who 
have received SG at the proposed dose of 10 mg/kg Q3W is considered acceptable. The median 
treatment duration of SG in study IMMU-132-09 and the mBC pool were 4.11 months and 4.63 
months, respectively. A total of 37% of the patients in the mBC pool, which includes the SG-treated 
patients from study IMMU-132-09, had an exposure of SG for more than 6 months and 13% were 
exposed for more than 12 months, which is acceptable and considered a relevant exposure for the 
safety assessment.  
All patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE) in the pivotal study IMMU-132-09 and the 
most frequently observed adverse events in the SG arm vs the TPC arm were neutropenia (70.5% vs 
54.6%), diarrhoea (61.9% vs 22.9%), nausea (58.6% vs 34%) and alopecia (47.8% vs 18.5%). 
Treatment-related AEs (ADRs) with SG vs TPC were also neutropenia (70.1% vs 23.8%), diarrhoea 
(56.7% vs 16.9%) and nausea (55.2% vs 30.9%). Hematotoxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity was 
markedly increased with SG vs TPC and clinically significantly more commonly observed.  
Grade ≥3 AEs in the SG arm vs the TPC arm were neutropenia (51.5% and 39.0%), diarrhoea 
(10.1% vs 1.2%), leukopenia (8.6% vs 6.0%), anaemia (7.5% and 3.6%), febrile neutropenia (6.0% 
vs 4.4%) and fatigue (6.0% vs 3.6%). Treatment-related grade ≥3 adverse events were more 
frequent in the SG arm (64.6% vs. 51.4%). 
Adverse events of special interest included neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, infections, diarrhoea, 
hypersensitivity, pulmonary events and neuropathy, which are important identified risks of treatment 
with SG.  Neutropenia was as expected commonly observed in both the pivotal study IMMU-132-09 
(72.8%) and in the BC pool (62.5%) and these events were most often of grade 3 or higher (54.9% vs 
53.3%). The majority of these events were assessed to be treatment-related and often led to study 
drug interruptions and reductions.  Febrile neutropenia was observed as grade 3 or higher and the 
incidences were similar in the SG arm and the BC pool, 6% vs 6.3% respectively. Section 4.2 of the 
SmPC has been updated to reflect the need to administer G-CSF as soon as clinically indicated in case 
of severe neutropenia, which is considered more conservative and supported. Section 4.4. has also 
been updated to reflect that fatal infections in the setting of neutropenia have been observed in clinical 
studies with sacituzumab govitecan. 
Adverse events and treatment-related AEs of diarrhoea occurred in a higher percentage of 
participants in the SG group (61.9% and 56.7% of participants, respectively) than in the TPC group 
(22.9% and 16.9% of participants, respectively) in Study IMMU 132 09. 10.1% had grade 3 or higher 
events. One participant (0.4%) discontinued SG treatment in Study IMMU 132-09 because of 
diarrhoea. Incidences and severity of diarrhoea are similar in the SG arm compared to the mBC pool. 
The SmPC section 4.4 has been updated to reflect that diarrhoea in some cases was observed to have 
led to dehydration and subsequent acute kidney injury. 
Serious Adverse events (SAEs) were observed with 27.6% in SG arm, which was similar to the 
incidences observed in the mBC pool (28.3%) but considerably higher compared to the TPC arm 
(19.3%). The most commonly observed SAEs in the BC pool and the SG arm were diarrhoea in 4.1% 
vs 4.9%, respectively, febrile neutropenia (4.8% vs 4.1%) and neutropenia (2.4% vs 3.0%). 
Remarkably, approximately 10 % of SAEs were infections and infestations and approximately 2% 
experienced a sepsis or a septic shock. In the TPC arm, the most common SAEs were febrile 
neutropenia (4.0%), nausea and pneumonia (2 % each).

Serious infections secondary to neutropenia and severe diarrhoea are currently important identified 
risk for sacituzumab govitecan. The observed high incidences and frequencies do not warrant any 
additional updates to the RMP. 
In the SG arm, 70.1% had died, 63.4% of disease progression and 3.0% of an adverse event. In 
comparison, more patients had died in the TPC arm, 66.3% of disease progression and no patients 
died from an adverse event. Hence, treatment with SG carries more severe toxicity, which could be 
outweighed by fewer cases of disease progression and death compared to standard of care (TPC). Only 
one out of ten fatal AEs was classified as possibly related to SG treatment. This is considered unlikely, 
as there were no fatal AEs in the TPC arm. In addition, all, but one patient who died of an AE were at 
least heterozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele (patient who died was homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 
allele). Considering that this genomic disposition could lead to less tolerability of SG, the higher deaths 
rates in the SG arm are probably not coincidental. Adequate warnings on the use in patients with 
reduced UGT1A1 activity are already included in the SmPC section 4.4 (see discussion below on 
UGT1A1 *28 allele). 
In Study IMMU-132-09, 6.3% of the patients in the SG arm discontinued treatment due to adverse 
events, which was only little higher compared to the TPC arm (4.4%) and in line with the rate for the 
SG-BG pool. Discontinuations rates appeared low taken the high SAE rates into consideration. 
Dose reductions of SG were common, and the rates were similar in both SG arm (33.6%) and the TPC 
arm (32.9%). Most frequent AEs leading to dose reductions were neutropenia and diarrhoea, which is 
consistent with the known safety profile of SG.  
Dose  interruptions  were  even  more  common  and  higher  the  SG  arm  (66.4%)  and  the  TPC  arm 
(43.8%). Most frequent AEs leading to dose interruptions were neutropenia, leukopenia, and anaemia. 
The rate of dose reductions and interruptions with SG were high but acceptable considering the targeted 
non-curative setting.  
Regarding laboratory findings, the level of haematological toxicity with SG was high, also compared 
to the haematotoxic TPC (eribulin, vinorelbine, gemcitabine or capecitabine). Regarding shifts in 
chemistry, the most grade 3 or 4 events in the SG vs the TPC arm were decreased potassium (4.2% vs 
0.4%), increased bilirubin (2.3% vs 0.8%) and decreased creatinine (2.3% vs 1.3%). This is 
considered acceptable. Overall, laboratory findings were in line with the reported AEs. 
The incidence of ADAs was low in participants who received SG (see clinical pharmacology). Overall, 
safety was similar between participants with or without ADAs to SG across individual studies and 
pooled populations. There was no clear impact of ADA on safety. 
Data on the elderly population are limited. Although there was no difference in discontinuation rate 
due to adverse events in patients aged 65 years or older compared with younger patients with mTNBC, 
there was a higher discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions in patients aged 65 years or older 
(14%) compared with younger patients (3%) with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. There was a 
higher incidence rate of serious adverse events in patients aged 75 years or older (67%) compared to 
patients aged 65 years or older (43%) and patients younger than 65 years (24%) with HR+/HER2- 
metastatic breast cancer (see SmPC section 4.8). Overall, increasing toxicity of SG could be observed 
with increasing age regarding serious adverse events (SAEs) both in the IMMU-132-09 study and the 
mBC pool. In addition, all but two patients who died of an adverse event were older than 65 years old, 
which could be indicating that SG is not tolerable for elderly patients. Section 4.8 of the SmPC has 
been updated to reflect the increased toxicity observed with age in patients with HR+/HER2- 
metastatic breast cancer.

An overall summary of TEAEs by race suggested comparable safety profile, so far. Overall, the most 
common TEAEs reported with SG treatment occurred at a similar incidence rate between Black and 
White participants in the Overall Targeted mBC and the All Treated SG 10 mg/kg populations. 
However, interpretation of safety results by racial subgroups was hampered by the small number of 
participants who were Asian or Black or African American. Given the fact that approximately 20% of 
the Black or African American population is homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele, limited data in this 
subgroup are of concern (see discussion below on UGT1A1 *28 allele).  
SN-38 (the small molecule moiety of sacituzumab govitecan) is metabolised via UGT1A1. The UGT1A1 
*28 allele is associated with decreased rates of transcription, initiation, expression, and enzyme 
activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1 (see EPAR Trodelvy). No significant differences in SG or 
free SN-38 exposure were observed in participants with the UGT1A1*28/*28 genotype compared with 
participants with the UGT1A1*1/*1 or UGT1A1*1/*28 genotype. Incidences of AES were high in 
patients regardless of genotype, however, Grade 3 or higher AEs were reported in a significant higher 
percentage of participants who were homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele (92.0%) compared with 
participants who were either heterozygous (74.8%) or were homozygous for the UGT1A1*1 allele 
(67.0%). This applies also to the serious AEs which were reported in half of participants who were 
homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele (48.0%) compared with participants who were either 
heterozygous (26.9%) or homozygous for the UGT1A1*1 allele (25.2%). This refers also to the ‘all SG 
treated group’, were more than 54% of the patients experienced a SAE. Furthermore, compared to 
patients homozygous for the wild-type allele, earlier median onset of neutropenia and anaemia was 
observed in patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele and in patients heterozygous for the 
UGT1A1*28 allele.  
In study IMMU-132-09 this correlation was even more pronounced. Although data are limited (n=25 
for the UGT1A1*28/*28 genotype), data suggested that SG could be not tolerable for those patients. 
Almost all patients (92%) experienced AEs Grade 3 or higher, 48 % an SAE and 1 patient died. 75% of 
these patients had dose interruptions and 12% discontinued the study due to AEs.  
In the approved TNBC population only slightly elevated Grade 3-4 AEs and SAEs were described. With 
the present variation, the incidences of AEs in patients with reduced UGT1A1 activity have been 
updated in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The SmPC adequately reflects that individuals who are 
homozygous for UGT1A1*28 allele are at increased risk for neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and 
anaemia and other adverse reactions following initiation of sacituzumab govitecan treatment. Patients 
with known reduced UGT1A1 activity should be closely monitored for adverse reactions (see SmPC 
section 4.4). 
The overall toxicity observed with SG mg/kg is considered manageable and in line with what has 
previously been observed in other clinical trials and the incidences reflected in the BC pool. No new 
toxicities were observed in the pivotal study. Adequate warnings and recommendations in the SmPC 
are considered sufficient to mitigate the risks. No additional pharmacovigilance activities are 
considered necessary, as the risks are sufficiently characterised. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. The frequencies of the existing ADRs in the 
approved Trodelvy product information were updated with the frequencies of treatment emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) observed in the Overall Targeted mBC pooled population (n=688) which is 
acceptable. 
No new safety concerns have been identified and no changes are made to the pharmacovigilance plan, 
which is agreed. There is currently one category 3 study ongoing to determine an appropriate starting

dose for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, already agreed at the initial marketing 
authorisation, which is also considered relevant for the proposed indication (see section 2.6).  
As part of the present variation, the MAH has also proposed the removal of 500 mL limit for the 
infusion bags and specific instruction for patient whose body weight exceeds 170 kg from section 6.6 
of the SmPC based on low risk of endotoxin exposure from Trodelvy. The endotoxin acceptance limit of 
Trodelvy is at 0.05 EU/mg, therefore, the maximum endotoxin exposure introduced from the drug 
product (at a dose of 10mg/kg) would be 0.5 EU/kg patient weight, which is ≤ 10% of the compendial 
limit of 5 EU/kg patient weight per hour. As the endotoxin from Trodelvy is significantly low (10% 
compendial limit of 5 EU/kg), 500 mL limit for the infusion bags and the patient weight limit were 
removed to allow hospitals to choose appropriate size bags based on the site practices and preference 
as long as product concentration is within 1.1 – 3.4 mg/mL. Accordingly, the MAH proposed not to 
include a statement regarding specific instruction for obese patients. This is considered acceptable. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of SG is considered rather unfavourable mainly due to high rates of haematological 
events (severe neutropenia) and gastrointestinal disorders (severe diarrhoea). Nonetheless, toxicities 
can be regarded as manageable by support with GCS-factor and dose modifications and overall 
acceptable in the proposed indication of advanced HR+Her2-BC. Given the generally high rates of AEs, 
Grade 3 AEs, SAEs and deaths, the SmPC has been updated to adequately reflect the tolerability of SG 
in the fragile elderly population and in the population wit UGT1A1*28 allele. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated. The 
Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. The MAH has also taken the opportunity to introduce minor 
modifications related to the QRD Template and SmPC guideline.

Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet or a focus test with target patient groups on the updated package leaflet has been submitted by 
the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The package leaflet (PL) has been amended with minimal wording to include a new indication for 
treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-
negative breast cancer who have received endocrine-based therapy, and at least two additional 
systemic therapies in the advanced setting.  
Therefore, the updates to the PL in this variation consequential to the extension of indication are slight. 
The key safety messages as well as the design and layout of the package leaflet are not significantly 
affected. Overall, there seems no negative impact on the readability.  
A full user consultation was provided with the dossier of the initial marketing authorisation which 
demonstrates the success criteria. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The final indication is as follows: “Trodelvy as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer 
who have received endocrine-based therapy, and at least two additional systemic therapies in the 
advanced setting (see section 5.1).” 
HR+/HER2− breast cancer, characterized by hormone receptor positivity (> 1% IHC ER and/or PR) 
and lack of HER2 expression (IHC score of 0, 1+, or 2+/FISH−), is the most commonly diagnosed 
breast cancer type.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Endocrine therapy combined with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor is the current standard of care for patients with 
newly diagnosed HR+/HER2− metastatic BC (mBC). Subsequent treatment options include sequential 
alternative endocrine regimens as a single agent or in combination with targeted agents including 
mTOR inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors, depending on PI3K mutation status.  
Treatment options for endocrine resistant/refractory disease include single-agent chemotherapy. PARP 
inhibitor monotherapy is an option for a subset of patients (< 10%) with HR+/HER2− mBC and 
BRCA1/2 mutations. 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan was approved in January 2023 for the treatment of HER2-low breast cancer 
(IHC score of 1+ or 2+/ISH−) who have received prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or 
developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/319185/2023  
Page 158/163 
 
 
 
In metastatic disease stage, HR+/HER2− has the second worst prognosis after metastatic TNBC with a 
5-year survival rate of 30%, so there remains an unmet medical need for endocrine-resistant, 
chemotherapy experienced HR+/HER2- mBC patients. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical study 
Study IMMU-132-09 is an ongoing, open-label, randomized, global Phase 3 study to compare SG 
versus treatment physician’s choice (single-agent treatment of eribulin, capecitabine, gemcitabine or 
vinorelbine) in participants with metastatic HR+/HER2− breast cancer who have been treated with a 
CDK 4/6 inhibitor, endocrine therapy, taxane, and at least 2 but no more than 4 prior chemotherapy 
treatment regimens for metastatic disease. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) 
as determined by BICR using RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints in the hierarchical testing procedure 
for multiplicity adjustment included overall survival, objective response rate (ORR) as determined by 
BICR using RECIST v1.1 and time to deterioration (TTD) in QOL assessments.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The open-label, randomized Phase 3 study IMMU-132-09 evaluated the efficacy of SG versus TPC as 
control in 543 participants with metastatic HR+/HER2− breast cancer (SG n=272; TPC n=271). As of 
the data cutoff date (01 July 2022, OS IA2), the median follow-up duration was 12.48 months (13.80 
months [range: 0.03-35.48] in the SG arm and 10.68 months [range: 0.03-33.15] in the TPC arm). 
The data cutoff date for primary PFS analysis was 03-Jan-2022. 
Statistically significant improvements in the SG group vs the TPC group were observed in: 
• 
• 
• 
PFS per BIRC (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.53, 0.83; P = 0.0003);  
Median 5.5 vs 4.0 months (at primary PFS analysis; 03 Jan 2022) 
OS (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.65, 0.96; P = 0.02), significant at nominal α=0.0223),  
Median 14.4 vs 11.2 months (at OS IA2; 01 Jul 2022) 
ORR per BICR (21% vs 14%; OR 1.63; 95% CI 1.03, 2.56, P = 0.0348) 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Highly variable efficacy results were observed for subgroups by TPC chemotherapy agents that remain 
difficult to interpret. Overall, it has to be acknowledged that the heterogeneous subgroup results do 
not appear to be plausible and the sample sizes are too small to draw reliable conclusions on a 
differential effect of SG. 
Only a low proportion of patients with brain metastasis (4.6%) and age ≥ 75 years (4.4%) were 
recruited; thus, no valid conclusions on efficacy can be drawn in these subgroups. These limitations 
are reflected in the SmPC. 
Efficacy endpoints (PFS, ORR, OS, DOR, CBR) were analyzed according to Trop-2 expression to identify 
any potential correlation with clinical outcome-related endpoints (selected exploratory endpoints). 
Conclusions on efficacy by Trop-2 expression is hampered by the retrospective/explorative testing and 
deficiencies regarding analytical and clinical validation (see section 3.7.3).

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Almost all of the patients experienced adverse events in the pivotal study and both safety pools and 
most adverse events were treatment-related. Common AEs were neutropenia (70.5%), diarrhoea 
(61.9%), nausea (58.8%), fatigue and alopecia (47.8%) anaemia (39.5%). Neutropenia was the most 
common Grade ≥ 3 AE; other Grade ≥ 3 AEs occurring in at least 5% of patients were:  diarrhoea, 
leukopenia, anaemia, febrile neutropenia and fatigue. 
Events of special interest included diarrhoea, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, infections, 
neuropathy hypersensitivity and interstitial lung disease.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed with a frequency of 27.6% in the SG arm. The most 
common (>2%) SAEs in the SG arm were febrile neutropenia (4.1%), neutropenia (3.0%) and 
diarrhoea (4.9%). 
Overall, 70.1% had died, 63.4% of disease progression and 3.0% of an adverse event, mostly 
occurring more than 30 days after last study drug administration.   
The percentage of patients with an AE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was low 
(6.3%). Asthenia and neutropenia (0.7% each) were the only AEs leading to permanent 
discontinuation of study drug that occurred in more than 1 patient in the SG group in Study IMMU-
132-09. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Only a low proportion of patients with age ≥ 75 years (4.4%) were recruited; therefore, no firm 
conclusions can be drawn based on these limited numbers. However available data suggest worse 
tolerability and increased SAEs in elderly patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. This is 
reflected in the SmPC. 
Safety according to the UGT1A1 genotype was provided indicating a decreased tolerability in patients 
with UGT1A1*28 allele. Adequate information and warnings are included in the SmPC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Sacituzumab govitecan demonstrated statistically significant improvements in PFS and OS over an 
acceptable comparator of TPC with single agent chemotherapies in heavily pre-treated patients with 
HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer. The overall data package supports a clinically relevant benefit of 
SG in this advanced disease setting.  
The safety profile of SG is considered rather unfavourable compared to the chemotherapeutic agents of 
the control arm, mainly due to high rates of haematological events (severe neutropenia) and 
gastrointestinal disorders (severe diarrhoea). Nonetheless, toxicities can be regarded as manageable 
by support with GCS-factor and dose modifications. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The observed improvement of 3.2 months in median overall survival in this advanced patient 
population can be considered a clinically relevant benefit which outweighs the increased toxicities 
compared to standard chemotherapy options in the overall study population. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Overall, Trop-2 expression data suggest an association of Trop2 expression with efficacy of SG, but the 
evidence of the provided data is not considered valid enough to determine a cutoff of Trop-2 
expression below that patients would certainly not derive any benefit from SG. Thus, a restriction of 
the indication to a subgroup of patients with higher Trop-2 tumor expression is not considered 
justified. It has however to be emphasized that any conclusions on efficacy by Trop-2 expression is 
hampered by the retrospective/explorative testing and the described deficiencies regarding analytical 
and clinical validation.     
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Trodelvy as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or 
metastatic hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who have received 
endocrine-based therapy, and at least two additional systemic therapies in the advanced setting is

considered positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change:

of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic hormone 
receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who have received endocrine-based therapy, and 
at least two additional systemic therapies in the advanced setting based on final results from study 
IMMU-132-09 (TROPiCS-02); this is an open-label, randomized, multicenter phase 3 study of 
sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132) versus treatment of physician's choice (TPC) in subjects with 
hormonal receptor-positive (HR+) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative 
metastatic breast cancer (mBC) who have failed at least two prior chemotherapy regimens. As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated. The Package 
Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. Version 3.0 of the RMP is approved. The MAH has also taken the 
opportunity to introduce minor modifications to the product information related to the QRD Template 
and SmPC guideline.  
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication 
brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

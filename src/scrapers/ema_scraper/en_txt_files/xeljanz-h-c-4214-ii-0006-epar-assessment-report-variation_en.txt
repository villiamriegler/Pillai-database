2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This procedure concerns an extension of indication to include treatment of adult patients with active 
psoriatic arthritis for Xeljanz (tofacitinib). 
Tofacitinib is a selective reversible inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) family. Tofacitinib inhibits JAK1, 
JAK2, JAK3 and to a lesser extent tyrosine kinase 2 (TyK2). In a cellular setting where JAKs signal in 
combinations, tofacitinib preferentially inhibits cytokines which use JAK1 and/or JAK3 to signal. The 
cytokines inhibited at clinical doses are known to have a role in multiple inflammatory diseases such as 
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA), ulcerative colitis (UC), ankylosing spondylitis, and 
Assessment report

psoriasis (PsO). Many of the cytokines that are associated specifically with the pathogenesis of PsA (e.g. 
IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-23) are modulated directly by JAK inhibition with tofacitinib.  
PsA is a chronic progressive inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis, which may result in 
permanent joint damage and disability1,2. Peak onset is between the ages of 30 and 60, and it affects 
men and women equally1. Prevalence estimates in Europe range from 0.05% to 0.21%2.  
Except for the distal interphalangeal joints, there are no predictable joints for involvement in PsA and the 
signs of inflammation are often non-symmetrical. In addition to peripheral joint arthritis and irreversible 
progressive articular damage, patients may have concurrent psoriasis, enthesitis, dactylitis, and 
spondylitis. The inflammation of PsA is characterised by infiltration of dendritic cells, B cells, T cells, and 
macrophages into the peripheral or axial joints, entheses, and tenosynovial sheaths. This infiltration is 
driven by inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-2, IL-10, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and tumour 
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)3,4.  
For most patients, skin manifestations predate the arthritis. Prognosis of PsA may range widely from a 
mild monoarthritic form with good prognosis to an erosive and destructive polyarticular form, comparable 
with that in patients with RA. Axial forms may also range from mild to severe and disabling. Flares and 
remissions usually characterise the course of PsA.  
Mild PsA is generally treated with NSAIDs. When only few joints are involved, local injections of steroids 
might be effective. For more extensive or severe PsA, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) 
are recommended.  Conventional synthetic DMARDs (csCMARDs) such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine and 
leflunomide, are standard therapies. For patients in whom csDMARDs are not effective, biological DMARDs 
(bDMARDs) or targeted DMARDs are recommended by guidelines such as EULAR5. These include tumour 
necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) (e.g. etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab 
pegol), bDMARDs with novel mechanisms of action such as ustekinumab (IL-12/23 antagonist) and 
secukinumab (IL-17A antagonist), and the PDE4 inhibitor apremilast. 
Evidence of medical need for improvement of today’s PsA treatment has been published in a study of 
real-life data from 141 PsA outpatients fulfilling the CASPAR criteria and examined between January 2013 
and May 2014. Musculoskeletal inflammatory involvement was more prominent than psoriatic skin 
involvement in these patients. The study showed that although the treatment options in PsA have been 
revolutionized in the last decade with the introduction of TNFi, there are still a substantial proportion of 
patients who do not achieve satisfactory results. There is a need for new treatments with new MOAs in 
PsA patients who are not responding to currently available treatment options for PsA6. 
The claimed indication was: 
XELJANZ in combination with a conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (csDMARD) 
is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult patients who have had an 
inadequate response or who have been intolerant to a prior disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug 
(DMARD) therapy (see section 5.1).

The approved indication is: 
XELJANZ in combination with MTX is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult 
patients who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to a prior disease-modifying 
antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy (see section 5.1). 
The proposed dose is 5 mg twice daily, the same as for rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
No new non-clinical studies have been performed in the context of this variation. 
The nonclinical assessment for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) has been supported by the nonclinical overview for 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), based on similarity of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters between RA and PsA 
patients as measured by Cmax and AUC24. The exposure margins to assess nonclinical safety in PsA are 
assumed to be the same as those in RA patients using the geometric mean Cmax and AUC24 estimates in 
RA patients.  
Also, literature references have been provided in order to complement the information, already submitted 
for Rheumatoid Arthritis at the time of the initial MA, on non-clinical pharmacology. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Although there are limited animal models of PsA, tofacitinib is efficacious in models of RA and psoriasis 
which have been used to characterize agents such as antibodies to TNF in RA and IL-17 and IL-23 in 
psoriasis respectively, which are also efficacious in various domains of PsA. Tofacitinib has been shown to 
be efficacious in rodent models of arthritis as assessed by clinical and histological measures of disease 
progression in the mouse collagen induced arthritis (CIA) and rat adjuvant induced arthritis (AIA). At 
efficacious doses, significant reduction in inflammatory proteins and gene sets were also observed. 
Tofacitinib is efficacious in mouse models of skin inflammation induced by imiquimod application and IL-
23 injection as assessed by clinical, histological and gene expression measures in the mouse ear. 
Tofacitinib is also efficacious in a CD4+CD45RBhighCD25- T-cell transfer model that mimics aspects of 
psoriasis pathology and in a xenograft model where human psoriatic skin from psoriasis patients was 
transplanted onto SCID mice.  
In a publication resulting from an IIR, selective deletion of A20 in myeloid cells of mice (A20myelko mice) 
results in spontaneous development of inflammation of the synovioentheseal complex (region of the 
Achilles tendon and proximal tarsal region). STAT1 expression is elevated in the A20myelko mouse 
macrophages resulting in enhanced production of STAT1-dependent gene expression in response to IFNα 
and IL-6. Treatment of A20myelko mice with tofacitinib (50 mg/kg BID) attenuated inflammation in the 
synovio-entheseal complex and reduced STAT1 gene expression (De Wilde et al, 2016). PsA is 
characterized by altered bone remodeling with both bone formation and erosion (Barnas & Ritchlin, 
2015). In unpublished work from an IIR, tofacitinib did not have an effect on mesenchymal stem cell 
proliferation or osteogenic or chondrogenic differentiation (report on file from Prof. McGonagle, Leeds 
Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine). 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics

2.2.4.  Toxicology 
No new data has been submitted. This was considered acceptable by CHMP. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH has submitted an ERA (dated May 2017) as part of the application for a MA for Xeljanz for 
treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The recommended dose of tofacitinib is 5 
mg administered twice daily in combination with a conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-
rheumatic drug (csDMARD). 
For the purposes of this assessment, tofacitinib is considered the primary entity released into the 
environment following patient use and is therefore considered a valid model for assessing environmental 
fate and effects resulting from use. Tofacitinib has a log D value < 4.5 at all environmentally relevant 
pHs, therefore screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT) is not required. However, the 
PECsw value is greater than the 0.01 µg/L action limit. Based on the PEC value, a Phase II environmental 
fate and effects analysis for tofacitinib is required. 
Environmental Fate Summary 
Biodegradation studies conducted in sludge indicate tofacitinib may undergo moderate degradation during 
the wastewater treatment process via mineralization and primary biodegradation. Based on a sludge 
sorption coefficient (Kd) of 37, a minimal amount (0.6%) may be removed through sorption to sludge 
during the wastewater treatment process. Therefore exposure to the terrestrial compartment as a result 
of sludge application to land is not a concern. Upon release of wastewater effluents into the aquatic 
environment, tofacitinib residues will reside in the water and sediment compartments. Based on an 
aqueous dissipation half-life of 6.3 –19 days under aerobic conditions, tofacitinib is expected to quickly 
dissipate from the water to the sediment and continue to degrade once in the environment (primary 
degradation half-life total system of 26.3 to 52.8 days). Multiple degradation products, all present at < 
10%, were observed in the sediment compartment sampled throughout the study, indicating that 
tofacitinib is expected to undergo primary degradation under the aerobic conditions present in the water-
sediment system; it is not expected to persist. Tofacitinib is not volatile and therefore will not enter the

The chronic aquatic effects of tofacitinib were assessed in green algae, fish and daphnia. Based on these 
data, the fathead minnow was determined to be the most sensitive species tested. Therefore, the 
PNECsurfacewater will be calculated using the NOEC for this species. The fathead minnow NOEC, based 
on sub-lethal effects related to observations of crocked tails was more conservative than the NOEC 
established for population relevant of survival. As per guidance, the chronic NOEC for Daphnia magna was 
used to calculate the PNECgroundwater and the NOEC for sludge was used to calculate the PNECmicro-
organisms. 
Aquatic Sediment Organism Effects 
Based on a PEC/PNECsurfacewater < 1, it may be concluded that tofacitinib is unlikely to represent a risk 
to the aquatic environment. No further testing is required. 
Based on a PEC/PNECgroundwater < 1, it may be concluded that tofacitinib is unlikely to represent a risk 
to the aquatic environment. No further testing is required. 
Based on a PEC/PNEC < 0.1, it may be concluded that tofacitinib is unlikely to represent a risk to 
wastewater microorganisms. No further testing is required.

Results of Phase II Tier A 
Following a single oral administration of tofacitinib to healthy humans, 30% of the dose is excreted as 
unchanged drug in urine and faeces, with 21.2 % excreted as a hydroxylated metabolite. Tofacitinib is 
considered the primary entity released into the environment following patient use. The presence of 
tofacitinib in the sewage treatment plant (STP) following excretion will not impact the performance of the 
microorganisms. Tofacitinib is biodegradable and based on the outcome of the sludge die away study, is 
expected to undergo degradation in the STP. With a primary biodegradation half-life of 23.8 hours, 
tofacitinib is expected to be moderately removed during the wastewater treatment process. Based on a 
sludge sorption coefficient (Kd) of 37, a minimal amount (0.6%) may be removed through sorption to 
sludge during the wastewater treatment process. Therefore, exposure to the terrestrial compartment, as 
a result of sludge application to land, is not a concern. 
Following wastewater treatment and discharge of effluents, tofacitinib and its residues are expected to 
reside in the water compartment and subsequently dissipate into the sediment compartment (aqueous 
dissipation half-life of 6.3 - 19.0 days). Once in the sediment compartment, it will continue to degrade 
with a primary degradation half-life of 26.3 - 52.8 days. Based on wastewater and water-sediment 
biodegradation, tofacitinib is unlikely to persist in the environment. 
Based on log D values < 4.5 at environmentally relevant pHs (4-9) tofacitinib is unlikely to 
bioaccumulate. The PECsurfacewater was not refined for human metabolism and excretion, for removal 
during wastewater treatment or for biodegradation in the water-sediment environment. In this 
conservative estimate, the PEC is more than 4 orders of magnitude less than the lowest chronic NOEC 
obtained with fish. In addition, the PEC/PNEC values for surface water (1.7 x 10-4), groundwater (2.6 x 
10-5), micro-organisms (5.0 x 10-7) and sediment dwelling organisms (1.7 x 10-2), are all significantly 
below the respective action limits.

The additional non-clinical information submitted as part of this variation does not affect the 
interpretation and assessment of the nonclinical data previously submitted for the RA MAA.  
Concerning the ERA, based on the outcome of the Phase II assessment, tofacitinib will not present an 
environmental risk following the proposed therapeutic use.

The non-clinical data is considered by the CHMP to be acceptable to support this variation. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The tofacitinib PsA development programme is based on 3 global studies, including 2 completed Phase 3 
double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety studies investigating tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg 
BID (Studies A3921125 and A3921091, also referred to as pivotal studies) and one ongoing Phase 3 
open-label, long-term extension (LTE) study (Study A3921092). 
The clinical pharmacology of tofacitinib has been previously characterised. Cross reference is made to the 
data submitted at the time of the original MAA submission for Rheumatoid Arthritis. These clinical 
pharmacology data support the use of tofacitinib in PSA. 
No new clinical pharmacology studies have been submitted in this application. However, data from the 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) development programme focusing on population pharmacokinetics (PK), 
exposure-response (E-R) relationships for selected efficacy and safety outcomes, and PK data supporting 
the recommended dosing for PsA patients as well as dose modifications for special populations, such as 
PsA patients with renal and hepatic impairment, and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are presented below. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Population Pharmacokinetics in Patients with PsA 
The PK of tofacitinib in PsA patients is based upon pooled population PK analysis of 2 Phase 3 studies. The 
objectives of this analysis were: (a) to characterise the PK of tofacitinib in patients with active PsA, (b) to 
identify intrinsic factors (covariates) that impact the PK of tofacitinib in PsA patients, and (c) to obtain 
individual steady-state exposures for subsequent E-R analyses. 
Table 1 – Overview of tofacitinib phase 3 studies in patients with PsA included in the population PK 
analysis 
Data from 2 Phase 3 studies, A3921091, a 12-month study, in patients with active PsA who were 
conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (csDMARD) inadequate responders (IR) 
and TNFi-naïve, and A3921125, a second study, of 6-month duration, in patients who were TNFi IR, 
comprising of 3252 observations from 650 patients, were pooled and analysed using nonlinear mixed-
effects modelling approaches. Two (2) tofacitinib doses of 5 mg and 10 mg BID were evaluated in both 
PsA Phase 3 studies. Both studies required patients to be on a background of stable csDMARDs during the 
trial. The study population in the population PK dataset consisted of 290 males and 360 females with 
ages ranging from 18 to 78 years and weights ranging from 38.1 to 159.7 kg. This included 93.9% White, 
0.5% Black, 3.1% Asian, and 2.6% patients belonging to other races. Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients 
represented 10.6% and 89.4% of the study population, respectively.

Page 18/150 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The dose-normalized plasma concentration versus time after dose plots for the 2 studies suggests that 
the PK of tofacitinib is linear in psoriatic arthritis patients. 
Population PK analysis was conducted using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling method with NONMEM, 
and Perl-speaks-NONMEM  was used as a supporting software. The estimation method used was first-
order conditional estimation with interaction (FOCEI). Model building was undertaken in the following 
steps: a) base structural model development, b) random effects model development, c) full model 
development, d) assessment of model adequacy and predictive performance. 
A full covariate modelling approach was used, emphasising parameter estimation rather than stepwise 
hypothesis testing. Inferences regarding the clinical relevance of covariate effects were based on 
parameter estimates from the full model and measures of estimated precision. No model-reduction 
techniques were applied to the full model. Hence, the full model was considered to be the final model. 
Covariates evaluated in the population PK analysis included race (White, Black, Asian, Others), sex, 
ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic), and continuous covariates including baseline age, baseline body 
weight, creatinine clearance (CLcr) at baseline, and baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) as potential 
predictors of oral clearance (CL/F); and baseline age and baseline body weight as potential predictors of 
volume of distribution (V/F). Body weight and age were incorporated as power functions, normalised to 
the reference (approximate median) values of 83.3 kg and 50 years, respectively. To characterise the 
effects of CLcr on tofacitinib CL/F, a power function was incorporated to estimate effects. A disease 
related covariate, baseline CRP, was added as power function (as was done for body weight and age), 
normalised to the reference value of 0.49 mg/dL (median value in the dataset). 
Base Model 
A one compartment model parameterised in terms of CL/F and V/F with first-order absorption (Ka) and 
absorption lag time was chosen as the base model. Inter-individual variability (IIV) for CL/F and V/F was 
modelled using exponential variance models with a covariance term. Residual random effects were 
described with 2 proportional error models for observations collected before or after 5 hours and IIV was 
introduced into residual error. 
The typical estimates of CL/F and V/F from the base model were 23.5 L/h and 113 L with relative 
standard errors of <2%. The absorption rate was estimated to be 13.7/hr with a relative standard error 
of 8.46%. IIV estimates (% CV) for CL/F and Ka were 35% and 199%, respectively. The scaling 
parameter to describe IIV of V/F on IIV of CL was 0.52. Residual variability for observations collected 
before or after 5 hours were 24% and 60%, respectively, with IIV estimated at 60%. Shrinkage 
estimates from the base model were 4.24% for IIV of CL/F, 35.0% for IIV of Ka and ~0% for IIV of 
residual error, respectively. 
Full Model 
The population PK parameters estimates (95% CI) for a reference (typical) individual (defined as White, 
Male, 83.3 kg, 50 years, baseline CLcr 120 ml/min, Hispanic, and baseline CRP 0.49 mg/dL) were 20.4 
L/h (18.6, 21.8) for CL/F, 110 L (108, 113) for V/F, and 13.8/ h (12.1,16.6) for Ka. The inter-individual 
variability (% CV) estimates from final model were 32% for CL/F and 198% for Ka. Residual variability 
(% CV) for observations collected before or after 5 hours was 22.9% and 52.6%, respectively, with an 
IIV of 66%.

Table 2 – Parameter estimates from the population pharmacokinetic model 
The covariate parameter estimates are summarised in table 3. Based on the covariate assessment: 
•  An 80-year-old patient was predicted to have a 9.0% lower CL/F compared to a 50-year-old 
(median value). 
• 
Females were predicted to have a 5.4 % higher CL/F compared to males. 
•  Asian patients were predicted to have a 4.7% lower CL/F compared to White patients. 
•  Non-Hispanics were predicted to have a 12.3% higher CL/F compared to Hispanics. 
•  A patient with a CLcr of 50 mL/min was estimated to have 24.3 % lower CL/F compared to a 
patient with a CLcr of 120 mL/min (median value). 
•  A patient with baseline CRP of 3.0 mg/dL was predicted to have a 3.6% lower CL/F compared to a 
patient with baseline CRP of 0.49 mg/dL (median value). 
•  V/F estimates for patients weighing 61 or 109 kg (corresponding to the 10th and 90th percentiles 
of the weight distribution in the PK dataset) were approximately 19% lower or 20% higher, 
respectively, relative to a patient weighing 83.3 kg (median value). 
•  V/F was estimated to be 9.9% lower for an elderly patient, 80 years of age, compared to that of a 
50-year-old patient (median).

The effects of the aforementioned intrinsic factors on AUC and Cmax are presented in figure 1. Data are 
presented as ratios (with 90% CI) for AUC and Cmax for each covariate of interest, relative to a reference 
patient (white male, Hispanic, body weight 83.3 kg, baseline CRP 0.49 mg/dL, baseline CLcr 120 mL/min, 
age 50 years). For continuous covariates, the 10th and 90th percentile values from the population PK 
dataset were used to calculate the expected magnitude of change at the tails of the distribution in this 
population. 
Figure 1 – Impact of covariates on the pharmacokinetics of tofacitinib in PsA patients 
With the exception of baseline CLcr, point estimates of AUC and Cmax ratios ranged between 0.88 and 
1.10, and between 0.89 and 1.16, respectively. For a patient with a CLcr of 50 mL/min, AUC was 
estimated to be 32% higher relative to a reference patient with baseline CLcr of 120 mL/min. However, 
as no patients with baseline CLcr values (estimated by CG equation) below 49 mL/min were included in 
the PsA population PK dataset, the need for dose adjustments in renal impairment was assessed using 
Phase 1 data from Studies A3921004 and A3921006. 
The point estimates of the AUC and Cmax ratios and the associated 90% CI, excluded ≥19% difference 
(except patients of Black race), indicating no major differences in tofacitinib exposure over the range of 
ages and body weights studied as well as race, ethnicity and gender. Only 3 patients of Black race were 
in this dataset and therefore the CIs for the AUC and Cmax ratios for this covariate were large. Data from

the population PK evaluation in RA patients which included 19 Black patients, showed ≤ 5% difference 
(CIs excluded ≥ 25% difference) in AUC and Cmax relative to patients of White race. 
Similar results were observed in Black psoriasis (PsO) patients. Taken together, the data suggests that no 
major differences in tofacitinib exposure are expected in PsA patients of Black race.

Comparison of Systemic Exposures Among PsA, RA and PsO Patients 
Population PK analysis results indicated that tofacitinib exposure, as measured by the steady-state AUC24 
after 5 mg BID is similar (differences between geometric means within 20%) among PsA (419 ng•hr/mL), 
RA (507 ng•hr/mL) and PsO (404 ng•hr/mL) patients. 
Evaluation of covariates across the PsA, RA and PsO patient populations showed consistent results in that 
none of these patient populations require dose modification or restrictions with respect to age, body 
weight, sex, race, or ethnicity. 
While the time-dependence of oral clearance was not evaluated in the PsA population (inter-occasion 
variability could not be evaluated in the model, and also PK data collection in most patients was less than 
4 months after start of tofacitinib treatment), these evaluations in the RA and PsO populations showed 
that tofacitinib clearance was not time-dependent. 
Population PK analysis results indicated comparable inter-subject variability (%CV) in AUC across PsA, RA 
and PsO patients (32%, 27% and 28%, respectively). Across these patient populations, systemic 
exposures are increased relative to healthy patients (geometric means of steady-state AUC24 in healthy 
volunteers is 311 ng•hr/mL, which is significantly lower than exposures in the patient populations 
presented above. This may be related to the inflammation burden in the disease populations versus 
healthy patients as a consequence of down-regulation of CYP450s by inflammation stimuli (Schmitt et al, 
2010).

2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
Rationale for Selection of Doses for PsA Phase 3 Studies 
The PsA Phase 3 programme evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID doses, 
which were the same as those studied in the RA and PsO Phase 3 development programmes. No Phase 2 
dose-ranging studies were conducted with tofacitinib in the PsA programme. 
Dose-selection in the RA and PsO tofacitinib programmes were based on modelling of Phase 2 dose-
response data of those efficacy and safety outcomes that were identified to be key drivers for dose-
selection. ACR responses for RA, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 and Physician’s Global 
Assessment (PGA) responses for PsO were identified as endpoints to evaluate for efficacy. E-R 
relationships for decreases in Hgb and associated risk of anaemia were useful to discriminate among 
doses in both RA and PsO programmes for safety. The probability of achieving a clinically meaningful 
target effect (PTE), where the target effect was defined in terms of a placebo-adjusted difference at a 
specific time point considered to be clinically meaningful (for example, 20% for ACR20), was utilised. 
Doses that were considered for Phase 3 evaluation were those that achieved a PTE of approximately 50% 
or higher on each endpoint. The tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID doses met the criteria (PTE of 
approximately 50% or higher on nearly all endpoints) for progression into Phase 3 for both indications. 
The RA dose-selection was based primarily on longitudinal dose-response modelling of the ACR20, ACR50 
and ACR70 responses for efficacy and change in Hgb (and associated anaemia incidence) for safety using 
data from Study A3921025 (which evaluated doses of 1 mg, 3 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg BID of 
tofacitinib and placebo for up to 24 weeks). The inclusion of tofacitinib 5 mg BID as the lowest dose for 
Phase 3 reflected the predicted increased PTE over, for example, the 3 mg BID dose on ACR50 (76% for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/197115/2018 
Page 24/150 
 
  
  
 
 
5 mg BID versus 47% for 3 mg BID) and ACR70 (40% for 5 mg BID versus 9% for 3 mg BID), without 
any loss in the PTE for anaemia (figure 5). The inclusion of tofacitinib 10 mg BID in the Phase 3 
programme reflected the possibility of increased benefit over the 5 mg BID dose on ACR70, while still 
maintaining a sufficiently conservative safety profile. ACR20/50/70 results observed in the RA Phase 3 
studies confirmed the selection of tofacitinib 5 mg BID dose in that population. 
Figure 5 – Probability of achieving a target effect for efficacy (ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response rates) 
and change in haemoglobin (anaemia) based on dose-response modelling (AR3921025 in RA) 
In PsO, the Phase 2 data was derived from Study A3921047, where doses of 2 mg, 5 mg and 15 mg BID 
of tofacitinib and placebo up to 12 weeks, were evaluated. Similar to RA, the selection of doses for PsO 
was based on modelling of efficacy responses (PASI75 and PGA) and changes in Hgb for safety. The 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID doses provided acceptable PTE for PASI75 responses (49% and 99%, 
respectively) and a high probability of observing a placebo-adjusted incidence rate of <5% for a Hgb 
decrease of >2 g/dL from baseline (100% and 87%, respectively), although 5 mg BID did not achieve the 
desired PTE for PGA response of clear or almost clear (23% ie, less than the target of 50%). However, 
the model predictions for the 5 mg BID suggested an adequate placebo-adjusted response rate for both 
PASI75 and PGA response (50% and 46%, respectively) at this dose level. 
Thus, the inclusion of the tofacitinib 5 mg BID dose as the lowest dose for Phase 3 reflected the lowest 
dose that could achieve efficacy with the desired product profile. The inclusion of tofacitinib 10 mg BID in 
the Phase 3 studies reflected an increased benefit over the 5 mg BID dose on both PASI75 and PGA 
responses; predicted response rates were over 10% higher in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID dose group 
compared to the 5 mg BID group. 
In summary, the 5 mg and 10 mg BID doses of tofacitinib were chosen based on the assumption that the 
dose/exposure-response relationships derived from the RA studies will be applicable to PsA patients.

Specifically, evaluation of a 30-fold dose range (1-30 mg BID) in RA patients over durations ranging from 
6 weeks to 6 months across 5 Phase 2 studies, showed that the 5 mg BID dose provided clinically 
meaningful and comparable efficacy as compared to standard of care therapies such as TNFi. Doses lower 
than 5 mg BID did not consistently demonstrate clinically meaningful efficacy, particularly in the more 
stringent measures of efficacy, while doses greater than 10 mg BID did not provide meaningful 
improvements beyond those observed in the 5 to 10 mg BID dose range. Similar results were obtained in 
the PsO programme. Exposure-response relationships for changes in Hgb were also consistent in both RA 
and in PsO. The internal consistency of these results in both indications supported the selection of the 
same doses (5 mg and 10 mg BID) for the PsA programme. 
Considering the collective model-based dose-selection rationale and experience from the RA and PsO 
programmes and the similarities that could be drawn between these 2 diseases and PsA, 5 mg BID and 
10 mg BID were the 2 tofacitinib doses selected and subsequently evaluated in Phase 3 in PsA patients 
(Studies A3921091 and A3921125). 
Following the completion of the PsA Phase 3 studies, E-R analyses were conducted and the results 
indicate that E-R relationships in PsA are consistent with those observed in RA and PsO. These E-R 
relationships for efficacy (ACR responses) and for changes in Hgb using data from the Phase 3 PsA 
studies (A3921091 and A3921125) are summarised below. 
Exposure-Response Relationships for Efficacy and Change in Haemoglobin from PsA Phase 3 
Studies 
Efficacy 
ACR responses from 2 Phase 3 studies in patients with active PsA, A3921091 and A3921125, were pooled 
to support a landmark exposure-response (E-R) analysis. An ordered categorical E-R model was 
developed to jointly model 20%, 50% and 70% ACR response levels (ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70) using 
data captured at Month 3 after administration of placebo, or tofacitinib doses of 5 mg or 10 mg BID. 
Figure 6 illustrates the exposure (Cavg)-response profiles for the proportion of ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 
responders, for Studies A3921091 and A3921125 at Month 3. For each endpoint, information with regard 
to the distribution of individual Cavg values as well as the prediction and CIs, are shown in Figure 7 
(ACR20), Figure 8 (ACR50), and Figure 9 (ACR70), respectively. 
The key findings from the E-R evaluation for efficacy are as follows: 
• 
The E-R model (an ordered categorical model) for efficacy endpoints, ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 
adequately described the relationship between tofacitinib exposure and clinical response. 
•  As shown in Figure 6, there is evidence of an E-R relationship for ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70. The 
model-predicted proportion of ACR20 responders for exposures (median Cavg) corresponding to 5 
mg and 10 mg BID at Month 3 were 51% and 58%, respectively, for ACR20; 29% and 36% for 
ACR50; and 15% and 20% for ACR70. The predicted proportion of responders for placebo was 
30%, 14% and 7%, for ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70, respectively. 
•  Cavg values corresponding to 5 mg and 10 mg BID doses of tofacitinib were estimated to provide 
approximately 51% (EC51) and 68% (EC68) of the maximum drug effect (Emax) respectively. 
This is consistent with the E-R analysis in the RA programme, which showed that Cavg values 
corresponding to 5 mg and 10 mg BID doses provided approximately 62% (EC62) and 77% 
(EC77) of the Emax, from a similar model of ACR responses. 
• 
The location of the 5 mg BID dose on the linear part of the E-R curve in PsA suggests that doses 
lower than 5 mg BID are likely to show reduced efficacy.

• 
Two specified covariates of interest, body weight (identified as an important covariate in PsO) and 
prior biologic use were evaluated. Neither covariate was found to influence the model parameters, 
Emax or EC50. 
•  Based on the E-R model, the relative benefits of tofacitinib 10 mg BID over 5 mg BID, expressed 
in terms of the ratio of the estimated proportion of responders, were 1.14, 1.22 and 1.27 for 
ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70, respectively. This is consistent with results from modelled ACR 
responses in RA, where the point estimates for the relative benefits of 10 mg over 5 mg BID 
across 4 dose-response studies ranged between 1.04-1.11 for ACR20, 1.17- 1.47 for ACR50, and 
1.27-1.77 for ACR70.

Change in Haemoglobin 
The results of the E-R characterisation of Hgb change after tofacitinib treatment as well as the incidence 
of Hgb decrease from baseline of >2 g/dL are also summarised. Change in Hgb (a mechanistic marker of 
JAK2 inhibition by tofacitinib) was previously identified as a useful biomarker to discriminate among doses 
and support Phase 3 dose-selection in both RA and PsO programmes. 
Hgb data from patients who received placebo, tofacitinib 5 mg or 10 mg BID from 2 Phase 3 studies 
A3921091 and A3921125 were pooled and used in this E-R analysis. For the placebo treated patients, 
data up to Month 3 was included in the analysis. For the 5 mg and 10 mg BID dose groups, data up to 
end of tofacitinib treatment (up to Month 12 for A3921091 and up to Month 6 for A3921125) were 
included. The dataset comprised of 685 patients, 309 of whom were males and 376 were females. The 
median weight, age and baseline Hgb levels of the patients were 83 kg, 50 years and 13.8 g/dL, 
respectively. 
The key findings for each outcome are summarised below: 
• 
The longitudinal E-R model used, which was an indirect response model, described the Hgb time-
course in PsA patients receiving placebo, tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID (Figure 10). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/197115/2018 
Page 30/150 
 
  
  
 
 
• 
The model-predicted median (95% CI) Hgb change from baseline, at Month 3 is - 0.2 (-0.3, 0.0) 
g/dL and -0.3 (-0.4, -0.2) g/dL for 5 mg and 10 mg BID tofacitinib doses respectively, compared 
to 0.0 (-0.1, 0.1) for placebo. 
Figure 10 – Observed and model-predicted time-course of change in haemoglobin from baseline in PsA 
phase 3 studies 
Based on a logistic regression analysis of Cavg versus the occurrence of a >2 g/dL decrease (from 
baseline) in Hgb, placebo-adjusted incidences (90% CI) were predicted to be 1.08% (0.61, 1.64) and 
3.02% (1.48, 4.93) at median Cavg values of 17.6 ng/mL and 36.1 ng/mL respectively, corresponding to 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID (Figure 11). 
Individual Cavg exposures in the upper quartile of the 10 mg BID dose group showed an increase in the 
proportion of patients experiencing a decrease in Hgb of >2 g/dL. For example, at the 90th percentile 
Cavg (54.8 ng/mL) in the 10 mg BID group, the estimated incidence was ~8%. 
The proportion of patients experiencing a decrease in Hgb of >2 g/dL is similar (point estimates within 
1.1%) between placebo and tofacitinib 5 mg BID dose. Based on the upper limit of the 90% CI for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/197115/2018 
Page 31/150 
 
  
  
 
difference between 5 mg BID and placebo, a greater than 2% increase in incidence can be excluded at 
the 5 mg BID dose in comparison to placebo. 
Figure 11 – Model-predicted incidence of Hgb decrease of>2g/dL vs C avg. 
The results are consistent with RA and with PsO that showed that a trend toward higher concentrations 
(Cavg) was associated with decreases in Hgb. Moreover, similar to RA and PsO, the results suggest that 
the 5 mg BID dose of tofacitinib is associated with similar levels of clinically important decrease (>2g/dL) 
in Hgb as those occurring with placebo in PsA patients. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Data from the 2 PsA Phase 3 studies suggest that the PK of tofacitinib is linear also in PsA patients. 
The population modelling is considered to be well developed.  Data is sparse from the clinical studies 
however data from the previous model in RA patients is used to inform the model and the fit of the data 
and estimation of parameters is acceptable. Inter-individual variability (IIV) for CL/F and V/F was 
modelled using exponential variance models with a covariance term. 
VPCs demonstrated that the simulated distributions matched the observed concentrations which indicated 
the full model described the concentrations at 2 dose levels adequately except a bit over-predicted 5 mg 
at early phase.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/197115/2018 
Page 32/150 
 
  
  
 
 
The model is considered suitable to simulate exposure in special populations and for exposure response 
modelling. The recommended dose of tofacitinib 5 mg BID in PsA patients is the same that is currently 
approved for RA patients. 
The evaluation of population pharmacokinetics of tofacitinib in PsA patients based on the popPK 
modelling, showed that, consistent with RA, no dosing modifications are needed for the covariates 
evaluated, including age, body weight, race, ethnicity and gender. 
Based on the demonstrated similarity in the tofacitinib PK profile between PsA and RA patients, it is 
considered that dosing modifications derived for RA patients, primarily based on Phase 1 clinical 
pharmacology studies, are also applicable in patients with PsA. 
As such, the recommended total daily dose of tofacitinib is also reduced by half (i.e. reduced from 5 mg 
BID to 5 mg once daily [QD]) for PsA patients with: 
•  Severe renal impairment 
•  Moderate hepatic impairment 
• 
• 
Patients receiving potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (for example, ketoconazole) 
Patients receiving one or more concomitant medications that result in both moderate inhibition of 
CYP3A4 and potent inhibition of CYP2C19 (for eg, fluconazole) 
Tofacitinib is not recommended in PsA patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Co-administration of tofacitinib and potent inducers of CYP3A4, such as rifampicin, to PsA patients may 
result in loss of or reduced clinical response. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Sparse sampling data from the phase 3 studies were used in a population PK analysis. The results of this 
analysis show similar exposure and variability to that seen in other patient groups e.g. RA and PsO 
patients. The exploration of covariates is also in agreement and suggests the same dose adjustments are 
appropriate in PsA patients. This is reflected in section 5.2 of the SmPC, where is stated that Results from 
population PK analysis in patients with active PsA were consistent with those in patients with RA. 
Analyzing the results of the E-R analysis a relative higher benefit for tofacitinib 10 mg BID over 5 mg BID 
can be observed for data from study A3921091; instead the E-R relationship for ACR20, ACR50 and 
ACR70 is less evident for study A3921125. Logistic regression analysis of Cavg versus the occurrence of a 
>2 g/dL decrease in Hgb predicted higher incidences with 10 mg BID tofacitinib dose compared to 5 mg 
BID. The proportion of patients experiencing a decrease in Hgb of >2 g/dL is similar between placebo and 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID dose. The proposed dose of 5 mg BID has been justified based on safety 
considerations, in particular the dose dependency of serious infections, opportunistic infections and 
laboratory parameters.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose response studies have been performed. This was considered acceptable by CHMP since the dose 
is expected to be the same as for RA, based on experience with conventional DMARDs and TNF inhibitors.

Treatments 
Subjects were randomised in a 2:2:2:1:1 ratio to one of the following 5 parallel treatment groups:

Figure 12 - Overview of Study Design 
BID = twice daily; SC = subcutaneous; q = every; wk = week. At the Month 3 visit, subjects in Treatment Sequence D and E advanced 
to the second predetermined treatment in a blinded fashion for the remainder of the study. 
The placebo controlled period was 3 months.  At Month 3 (primary time point), all subjects randomised to 
placebo were advanced to tofacitinib 5 mg BID or 10 mg BID in a blinded manner for the remainder of 
the study. 
•  Tofacitinib 5 mg BID (n = 107) 
•  Tofacitinib 10 mg BID (n = 104) 
•  Adalimumab 40 mg SC q2w (n = 106) 
The active control study medication, adalimumab, was administered at 40 mg subcutaneously (SC) once 
every 2 weeks (q2w) per PsA dosage. Adalimumab and matching placebo were provided by the Sponsor 
as prefilled syringes with instructions for self-injection.   
Subjects continued a stable dose of their background csDMARD (e.g. methotrexate, sulfasalazine, 
leflunomide) dosed in accordance with the local regulatory label, for the duration of the study (see 
inclusion criteria). Subjects on methotrexate must have received folate supplementation per local 
methotrexate label guidelines and standard of care. Subjects were also permitted to remain on a stable 
dose of NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitor, corticosteroid, opioids (up to potency equivalent of 30 mg oral 
morphine) and acetaminophen/paracetamol (up to 2.6 g daily) from 1 week prior to first study dose. The 
only exception was adjustment for safety reasons.  
Certain medications were permitted for rescue. Increases of acetaminophen/paracetamol and opioids 
were allowable as rescue medication. Subjects who required rescue for more than 10 consecutive days 
were discontinued from the study. Intra-articular corticosteroids or hyaluronate sodium could be 
administered at or after the Month 3 visit (after study assessments) in no more than 2 joints. Injected 
joints were considered as having their pre-injection status (tender/painful and swollen joint count) and 
were not counted for the remainder of the study.

Objectives 
The primary study objectives were: 
• 
• 
• 
To compare the efficacy of tofacitinib at doses of 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID versus placebo for the 
treatment of rheumatological signs and symptoms of PsA, in subjects with active PsA who have 
had an inadequate response to a conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs 
(csDMARD) 
To compare physical function status of subjects with active PsA who have had an inadequate 
response to a csDMARD after administration of tofacitinib at doses of 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID 
versus placebo  
To compare the safety and tolerability of 2 doses (5 mg BID and 10 mg BID) of tofacitinib versus 
placebo in subjects with active PsA who have had an inadequate response to a csDMARD  
Secondary objectives were, relating to efficacy for health outcome measures, dermatological signs and 
symptoms, and durability of treatment responses, as well as comparisons with adalimumab and 
pharmacokinetic (PK) characterisation. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy evaluation 
There were two primary efficacy endpoints: ACR20 responder rates at Month 3, and change from baseline 
in Health Assessment Quality-Disability Index (ΔHAQ-DI) at Month 3.  
ACR20 was calculated as a ≥20% improvement in tender/painful and swollen joint counts and ≥20% 
improvement in 3 of the 5 remaining ACR-core set measures: patient and physician global assessments, 
pain, disability, and an acute-phase reactant. The specific components of the ACR assessments used in 
this study were: Tender/Painful Joint count (68); Swollen Joint Count (66); Patient’s Assessment of 
Arthritis Pain (Visual Analog Scale [VAS]); Patient’s Global Assessment of Arthritis (VAS); Physician’s 
Global Assessment of Arthritis (VAS); CRP; HAQ-DI. 
Secondary efficacy evaluation 
Radiographs were taken at baseline and Month 12. For subjects with early termination, radiographs were 
obtained at the Early Termination visit. Radiographic changes scored by modified Total Sharp Score 
(ΔmTSS) at Month 12 and progressor rates (defined as ΔmTSS >0.5) at Month 12 were evaluated by 2 
independent central, blinded assessors. 
Signs and symptoms were evaluated by: 
•  ACR50 and ACR70 responder rates at all time points  
•  ACR20 responder rates at all time points other than Month 3  
•  ACR response criteria components (except HAQ-DI) at Month 3  
•

Sample size 
The sample size and power analyses for all primary endpoints were based on subjects randomised in a 
2:2:2:1:1 ratio to the 5 treatment sequences, effectively resulting in a 1:1:1:1 randomisation for the 
primary analysis at 3 months. All hypotheses were tested at the nominal alpha level of 2.5% (5% 2-
sided). 
The normal approximation to the binomial was used to calculate the power of the test statistic for the 
ACR20. Assuming a placebo response rate of about 15%, a sample size of 100 per arm would yield 
approximately 92% power for a difference between a tofacitinib dose and placebo of at least 20%. 
For the analysis of the ΔHAQ-DI, the sample size of 100 per arm results in over 94% power for 
differences of 0.3 or greater between a tofacitinib dose and placebo, assuming a SD of 0.6. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was conducted using an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). The randomisation 
was not stratified. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-dummy design where all patients received either tofacitinib 5 mg tablets or a matching 
placebo. Similarly, patients received either an adalimumab injection or injection with a matching placebo. 
The Sponsor provided tofacitinib as 5 mg tablets with corresponding matching placebo tablets. The 
blinded assignment consisted of 1 active 5 mg tablet and 1 placebo tablet for the 5 mg dose sequence or 
2 active 5 mg tablets for the 10 mg dose sequence or 2 placebo tablets for the placebo sequences. Active 
control study drug was provided by the Sponsor as prefilled syringes with corresponding matching 
placebo. 
All rheumatological and dermatological assessments including the physician’s global efficacy assessments 
were performed by qualified assessors who were blinded to study drug treatment, laboratory values 
(including CRP), subject safety and prior efficacy data. The same qualified assessor was requested to 
score all evaluations for a particular assessment for a given subject throughout the study. Laboratory 
samples were analysed by a central laboratory. Radiographic images were evaluated by 2 independent 
central, blinded assessors.

Statistical methods 
General Considerations 
The primary efficacy analysis was conducted on data collected during the first 3 months where inferential 
comparisons to placebo entailed combining treatment sequences D and E to form 1 placebo group. The 
primary comparisons were between each tofacitinib dose and placebo at Month 3. 
All statistical tests for efficacy endpoints were 2-sided at a significance level of 0.05.  
In order to control the Type I error, a step-wise testing procedure was used. This implied that a given 
endpoint for a given dose can only achieve significance (i.e., conclude superiority) if the prior endpoint 
was significant. The order or fixed sequence for testing against placebo was as follows: tofacitinib 10 mg 
ACR20 response rate at Month 3, tofacitinib 5 mg ACR20 response rate at Month 3, tofacitinib 10 mg 
ΔHAQ-DI at Month 3 and tofacitinib 5 mg ΔHAQ-DI at Month 3. 
A step-down approach was also applied to certain secondary efficacy endpoints. Key secondary efficacy 
variables were as follows: PASI75, ΔLEI, ΔDSS, ΔPhysical Functioning Domain of SF-36 and FACIT-F (3 
endpoints in order of testing priority: ΔFACIT-F total score, ΔFACIT-F experience domain score and 
ΔFACIT-F impact domain score) at Month 3. In order to strongly protect the study-wise Type I error rate 
at the 0.05 (2-sided) level with respect to these key secondary endpoints and the primary endpoints, 
these endpoints were tested only if all endpoints/doses for the primary endpoints were statistically 
significant. The order of testing was as listed above; for each endpoint, tofacitinib 10 mg was tested 
versus placebo first, followed by tofacitinib 5 mg versus placebo. Testing stopped at the first instance in 
which statistical significance was not achieved. 
Analysis sets 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS): All subjects who were randomized to the study and received at least 1 
dose of the randomized study drug (tofacitinib, adalimumab, or placebo). The FAS was used for all 
analyses of all efficacy and PRO endpoints, and was the primary dataset for the primary endpoints. 
The Per-Protocol (PP) Analysis Set: The PP Analysis Set excluded all subjects who had a protocol 
deviation thought to have a material impact on the primary efficacy analysis The PP Analysis Set was 
used in a sensitivity analysis for each of the 2 primary endpoints. 
Endpoint Specific Analysis Sets: Subjects were excluded from FAS for a specific endpoint if certain 
conditions were met for the endpoints based upon baseline criteria. These criteria were used to ensure 
that only patients with the condition present or severe enough to allow room for response were included 
in analyses for endpoints where presence of that condition was not an inclusion criterion. 
Analysis of the primary endpoints 
The normal approximation for the difference in binomial proportions was used to test the superiority of 
each dose of tofacitinib to placebo for ACR20 response at Month 3 on the FAS with missing value 
considered as non-response. 
As a supportive analysis, a generalized marginal linear model for correlated data (due to repeated 
measures; also known as, GMMRM) was used. This model included fixed effects for treatment, visit 
(discrete, up to Month 3) and treatment by visit interaction; the dependent variable was logit of the 
probability of “response.” A common first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) variance-covariance matrix for all 
treatment groups was used to model the variability among observations within a subject. 
The ΔHAQ-DI data from baseline through Month 3 on the FAS was analysed using a MMRM that included 
the fixed effects of treatment, visit (discrete, up to Month 3), treatment by visit interaction, geographic

location and baseline value. A common unstructured variance-covariance matrix was used for all 
treatment groups. There was no imputation for missing data. This analysis was referred to as MMRM1.  
As a supportive analysis for ΔHAQ-DI through Month 3, a missing not at random (MNAR) multiple 
imputation (MI) approach was used. The specific MI that was implemented applies the “jump to 
reference” (JTR) imputation approach to the active dose groups but missing at random imputation 
approach to the combined placebo group. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, that included 
treatment and geographical location as fixed effects, and baseline value as a covariate was used to 
analyse the data after imputation. This analysis was referred to as MI-JTR.  
Additional analyses of the HAQ-DI included a responder analysis at Month 3 where subjects with a change 
(i.e., decrease) of ≥ 0.30 were considered responders. Another responder analysis was conducted using a 
change (i.e., decrease) of ≥ 0.35 as the cut-point for response. The normal approximation for the 
difference in binomial proportions was used for these responder analyses. 
For both primary endpoints sensitivity analyses were done using the PP analysis set, and using the FAS 
with 1 subject excluded whose data were not fully source verified. 
Interim analyses 
No interim analyses were conducted for this study.

Recruitment 
This global study was conducted in 94 centres in Australia, Canada, Mexico, Russian Federation, Taiwan, 
US and EU. 
The study dates were 20/01/2014 (first subject first visit) to 18/12/2015 (last subject last visit).  
Conduct of the study 
There were 3 amendments to the final protocol (dated 21/12/2012). Amendments 1 and 2 were made 
prior to the first subject first visit and mainly included minor changes to the eligibility criteria following 
agency feedback. Amendment 3 (dated 09/01/2015) specified that subjects in Canada who were women 
of childbearing potential, and sexually active, were required to use 2 methods of contraception.  
The SAP was amended 3 times after the original version (dated 17 May 2013). All updates were made 
prior to the treatment code unblinding and study database release. 
The most common key protocol deviations were related to procedures/tests (16[3.8%]), 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (16[3.8%]) and study drug (14[3.3%]). Six subjects were excluded from the 
PP Analysis Set.  
Three subjects were withdrawn due to under-compliance (1 subject each in tofacitinib 5 mg, tofacitinib 10 
mg and adalimumab groups).

Prior drug treatment 
All subjects were required have ongoing treatment with a stable dose of csDMARD at baseline. Therefore 
100% of subjects had prior csDMARD treatment. In addition, 11 subjects (2.6%) had prior biological 
DMARD treatment. Prior treatment with TNFi was not permitted; however, one subject in the placebo arm 
had prior TNFi therapy.

3, suggesting at least maintenance of effect.   
Tender/painful joint count 
A statistically significant reduction in tender/painful joint count was only observed for the comparison of 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID vs placebo at Month 3.   
Swollen joint count 
There was a statistically significant reduction in swollen joint count for the 3 active treatments vs placebo 
at Month 3. For the comparison of tofacitinib 5 mg BID vs placebo, the LS mean difference was -1.7 (95% 
CI: -3.3, -0.2; p=0.0265).

Physical function and health outcome measures 
SF36v2 
For the physical functioning domain, physical component and bodily pain domain at Month 3, LS mean 
changes are increased for all 3 active treatments vs placebo, reaching statistical significance. The 
improvements are maintained over the 12-month study.  
For the vitality domain at Month 3, LS mean changes are increased for tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg vs 
placebo, reaching statistical significance. The improvements are maintained over the 12-month study. 
For the social functioning domain at Month 3, LS mean changes are increased for tofacitinib 5 mg vs 
placebo, reaching statistical significance. The improvements are maintained over the 12-month study. 
For the mental component and role – emotional domain, there is a trend in favour of tofacitinib 5 mg and 
10 mg at Month 3.   
For role-physical domain, mental health domain and general health domain, there is a trend in favour of 
all 3 active treatments at Month 3. 
EuroQol-5 Dimension Health State Profile (EQ-5D-3-level) 
For the mobility domain and the pain/discomfort domain, the LS mean change from baseline at Month 3 
was greater for the active treatment groups vs placebo to a statistically significant extent. The changes 
were maintained during the 12-month study.  
For the self-care domain, the usual activities domain and the anxiety/depression domain, there was no 
statistically significant difference compared to placebo.  
Regarding the VAS score (mm) on the subjects’ health care state today, the Month 3 LS mean scores 
(change from baseline) were 14.00, 15.83 and 13.10 for tofacitinib 5 mg, tofacitinib 10 mg and 
adalimumab, compared to 6.37 for placebo. These treatment differences reached statistical significance. 
The scores were maintained during the 12-month study.

PASDAS 
PASDAS is a composite PsA disease activity score that includes the following components: Patient’s Global 
Joint and Skin Assessment (VAS: 0-100 mm), Physician’s Global Assessment of Psoriatic Arthritis (VAS: 
0-100 mm), swollen and tender/painful joint counts (66/68), LEI score, tender dactylitic digit score, PCS 
of SF-36v2 and CRP (mg/L).   
The ∆PASDAS at Month 3 in Study A3921091 was greater for subjects receiving tofacitinib 5 mg BID (-
1.99), tofacitinib 10 mg BID (-2.39), adalimumab (-2.17) versus placebo (-1.21) (the 2-sided 95% CI for 
the difference between each active treatment group and placebo excluded 0).  The improvement in 
PASDAS was sustained or increased for the 3 active treatment groups at time points after Month 3 
through Month 12.

In order to establish if the indication population should be restricted to patients with MTX inadequate 
response (IR), additional subgroup analyses were performed. At baseline, around 6% of the population of 
study A3921091 (csDMARD-IR) had an inadequate response to one csDMARD other than MTX. In 
addition, 1.4% had an inadequate response to >1 csDMARD that did not include MTX. These subgroups 
are too small for meaningful efficacy or safety analyses. However, the subgroup with an inadequate 
response to >1 csDMARD can provide supportive information, since patients in this subgroup (>1 
csDMARD-IR) had an inadequate response to a csDMARD other than MTX and should represent a more 
difficult to treat population.  
The efficacy outcomes of the >1 csDMARD subgroup vs 1 csDMARD-IR subgroup (predominantly MTX-IR) 
are presented below:

*Primary study endpoints of American College of Rheumatology Response Criteria ≥ 20% and change from baseline in score on the 
Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index were obtained at Month 3. All subjects randomized to placebo treatment sequences 
were to receive tofacitinib (5 or 10 mg BID, Treatment sequences C and D, respectively) in a blinded manner after Month 3.  
At the end of Month 6, eligible subjects may have enrolled into the open-label, long-term extension study 
A3921092. 
During the study, subjects remained on a stable dose of 1 csDMARD, e.g., methotrexate, sulfasalazine, 
leflunomide, or other drug as approved by the Study Clinician, dosed in accordance with the local 
regulatory label. Subjects on methotrexate must have received folate supplementation per local 
methotrexate label guidelines and standard of care. Subjects were also permitted to remain on a stable 
dose of NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitor, corticosteroid, opioids (up to potency equivalent of 30 mg oral 
morphine) and acetaminophen/paracetamol (up to 2.6 g daily) from 1 week prior to first study dose. The 
only exception was adjustment for safety reasons.  
Certain medications were permitted for rescue. Increases of acetaminophen/paracetamol and opioids 
were allowable as rescue medication. Subjects who required rescue for more than 10 consecutive days 
were discontinued from the study. Intra-articular corticosteroids or hyaluronate sodium could be 
administered at or after the Month 3 visit (after study assessments) in no more than 2 joints. Injected 
joints were considered as having their pre-injection status (tender/painful and swollen joint count) and 
were not counted for the remainder of the study. 
Objectives 
Primary objectives:  
1.  To compare efficacy of tofacitinib at doses of 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID versus placebo for 
treatment of rheumatological signs and symptoms of active PsA in subjects who have had an 
inadequate response in PsA to at least 1 TNFi. 
2.  To compare physical function status after administration of tofacitinib at doses of 5 mg BID and 
10 mg BID versus placebo in subjects with active PsA who have had an inadequate response in 
PsA to at least 1 TNFi. 
3.  To compare the safety and tolerability of tofacitinib at doses of 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID versus 
placebo in subjects with active PsA who have had an inadequate response in PsA to at least 1 
TNFi. 
Secondary objectives were also listed, relating to efficacy for health outcome measures, dermatological 
signs and symptoms, and pharmacokinetic (PK) characterisation. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy evaluation 
There were two primary efficacy endpoints: ACR20 responder rates at Month 3, and Δ HAQ-DI at Month 
3.  
ACR20 was calculated as a ≥20% improvement in tender/painful and swollen joint counts and ≥20% 
improvement in 3 of the 5 remaining ACR-core set measures: patient and physician global assessments, 
pain, disability, and an acute-phase reactant. The specific components of the ACR assessments used in 
this study were: Tender/Painful Joint count (68); Swollen Joint Count (66); Patient’s Assessment of 
Arthritis Pain (Visual Analog Scale [VAS]); Patient’s Global Assessment of Arthritis (VAS); Physician’s 
Global Assessment of Arthritis (VAS); CRP; HAQ-DI.

Secondary efficacy evaluation 
Signs and symptoms evaluated by: 
•  ACR50 and ACR70 responder rates at all time points  
•  ACR20 responder rates at all time points other than Month 3  
•  ΔACR response criteria components (except HAQ-DI) at Month 3  
• 
Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) at all Months 1, 3 and 6  
•  Δ Physician’s Global Assessment of Psoriasis (PGA-PsO) response at Months 1, 3 and 6 
• 
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI75) response at Months 1, 3 and 6  
•  ΔDactylitis Severity Score (DSS) at Months 1, 3 and 6  
•  ΔEnthesitis (using the Leeds Enthesitis Index [LEI] and Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of 
Canada [SPARCC] Enthesitis Index) at Months 1, 3 and 6 
Secondary Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) of Physical Function and Health Outcome Measures 
(assessed at Months 1, 3 and 6):   
•  ΔShort-Form 36 (SF-36) Version 2, Acute   
•  ΔEuroQol-5 Dimension health state profile (EQ-5D) and ΔEQ-VAS  
• 
FACIT-F (3 endpoints: total score, experience domain score and impact domain score) 
Evaluation of spondylitis using ΔBath Anklyosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) 
Sample size 
The sample size and power analysis for the 2 primary endpoints were based on subjects randomised in a 
2:2:1:1 ratio where the 2 placebo groups were combined, effectively resulting in a 1:1:1 randomisation 
for the primary analysis at 3 months. All hypotheses were tested at the nominal alpha level of 2.5% (5% 
2-sided). 
The sample size for this study was driven by the ACR20 response rate. On the assumption of a placebo 
response rate of 15%, a sample size of 130 subjects per treatment arm yields approximately 84% power 
to detect a difference of 15% from placebo in ACR20 response; this sample size would also yield 
approximately 97% power to detect an ACR20 response difference of at least 20%. 
For the analysis of HAQ-DI, the sample size of 130 subjects per treatment arm results in approximately 
98% power to detect a difference between the 2 means of 0.3 or greater, assuming a SD of 0.6. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was conducted by means of an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). The 
randomisation was not stratified. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. Subjects were assigned a combination of active and placebo 5 mg tablets 
according to the randomisation schedule.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/197115/2018 
Page 72/150 
 
  
  
All rheumatological and dermatological assessments including the physician’s global efficacy assessments 
were performed by qualified assessors who were blinded to study drug treatment, laboratory values 
(including CRP), subject safety and prior efficacy data. The same qualified assessor was requested to 
score all evaluations for a particular assessment for a given subject throughout the study. Laboratory 
samples were analysed by a central laboratory. 
Statistical methods 
General Considerations 
The primary efficacy analysis was conducted on data collected during the first 3 months where inferential 
comparisons to placebo entailed combining treatment sequences C and D to form 1 placebo group. The 
primary comparisons were between each tofacitinib dose and placebo at Month 3. 
All statistical tests for efficacy endpoints were 2-sided at a significance level of 0.05.  
In order to control the Type I error, a step-wise testing procedure was used. This implied that a given 
endpoint for a given dose can only achieve significance (i.e., conclude superiority) if the prior endpoint 
was significant. The order or fixed sequence for testing against placebo was as follows: tofacitinib 10 mg 
ACR20 response rate at Month 3, tofacitinib 5 mg ACR20 response rate at Month 3, tofacitinib 10 mg 
ΔHAQ-DI at Month 3 and tofacitinib 5 mg ΔHAQ-DI at Month 3. 
A step-down approach was also applied to certain secondary efficacy endpoints. Key secondary efficacy 
variables were as follows: PASI75, ΔLEI, ΔDSS, ΔPhysical Functioning Domain of SF-36 and FACIT-F (3 
endpoints in order of testing priority: ΔFACIT-F total score, ΔFACIT-F experience domain score and 
ΔFACIT-F impact domain score) at Month 3. In order to strongly protect the study-wise Type I error rate 
at the 0.05 (2-sided) level with respect to these key secondary endpoints and the primary endpoints, 
these endpoints were tested only if all endpoints/doses for the primary endpoints were statistically 
significant. The order of testing was as listed above; for each endpoint, tofacitinib 10 mg was tested 
versus placebo first, followed by tofacitinib 5 mg versus placebo. Testing stopped at the first instance in 
which statistical significance was not achieved. 
Analysis sets 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS): All subjects who were randomized to the study and received at least 1 
dose of the randomized study drug (tofacitinib, or placebo). The FAS was used for all analyses of all 
efficacy and PRO endpoints and was the primary dataset for the primary endpoints. 
The Per-Protocol (PP) Analysis Set: The PP Analysis Set excluded all subjects who had a protocol 
deviation thought to have a material impact on the primary efficacy analysis The PP Analysis Set was 
used in a sensitivity analysis for each of the 2 primary endpoints. 
Endpoint Specific Analysis Sets: Subjects were excluded from FAS for a specific endpoint if certain 
conditions were met for the endpoints based upon baseline criteria. These criteria were used to ensure 
that only patients with the condition present or severe enough to allow room for response were included 
in analyses for endpoints where presence of that condition was not an inclusion criterion. 
The Safety Analysis Set (Safety): this set included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the 
randomized study drug (tofacitinib or placebo). 
Analysis of the primary endpoints 
The analysis methods were identical to those used for study A3921091, please see above.

Results 
Participant flow 
Of 546 subjects screened for entry into the study, 395 subjects were randomized to double-blind 
treatment; 132 subjects to tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 132 subjects to tofacitinib 10 mg BID, 66 subjects to 
placebo → tofacitinib 5 mg BID, and 65 subjects to placebo → tofacitinib 10 mg BID.  
There were 394 treated subjects included in the FAS as 1 subject in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID sequence 
was randomized but was not treated; all 394 subjects in the FAS were analysed for safety data and 393 
subjects were analysed for laboratory data.

Recruitment 
The study was conducted in 98 centres in Australia, Brazil, Canada, EU, Mexico, Russian Federation, 
Taiwan and US.  
22/08/2013 (first patient first visit) to 04/04/2016 (last patient last visit). 
Conduct of the study 
The final protocol document (dated 21 December 2012) had 4 amendments. The amendments were made 
prior to the first subject first visit and mainly included minor changes to the eligibility criteria. None of the 
changes made were deemed to impact the primary objective of the study.  The SAP was amended 4 
times. All updates were made prior to the treatment code unblinding and study database release. 
Protocol deviations 
Upon entry into the study, 6 subjects were receiving >1 allowable csDMARD: 3 subjects in the tofacitinib 
5 mg BID group, 2 subjects in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group, and one subject in the placebo → 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID sequence. All but one of these subjects discontinued 1 of the csDMARDs after the 
Month 3 visit. The most common protocol deviations were related to concomitant medication (40 [10.2%] 
deviations). Protocol deviations were also identified for inclusion/exclusion criteria (35 [8.9%] 
deviations). Three subjects were not taking csDMARDs at baseline (2 subjects in the tofacitinib 10 mg 
BID group and 1 subject in the placebo → tofacitinib 5 mg BID sequence); no csDMARD was initiated 
during the study. In addition, protocol deviations were identified for procedures/tests (17 [4.3%]). Key 
protocol deviations that were viewed by the Sponsor to impact the primary efficacy results were excluded 
from the PP Analysis Set. Twenty-three subjects were excluded from the PP Analysis Set.

Study A3921092: A Long-Term, Open-Label Extension Study of Tofacitinib (CP-690,550) for 
the Treatment of Psoriatic Arthritis 
This extension study for protocols A3921091 and A3921125 (see under ‘main studies’) was initiated 17 
February 2014 and is ongoing. A report has been provided based on an interim cut-off date of 04 April 
2016. The primary objective was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of treatment with 
tofacitinib (5 mg BID and 10 mg BID) in adult subjects with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The secondary 
objective was to evaluate long-term efficacy.

All eligible subjects from qualifying Studies A3921091 and A3921125 received open-label tofacitinib 5 mg 
BID upon entry into A3921092. Starting at Month 1, tofacitinib dose may have been increased to 10 mg 
BID at study visits if, based upon the Investigator’s discretion, subjects receiving tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
would have benefited from a higher dose and were not experiencing any tofacitinib-related adverse 
events (AEs), including abnormalities in laboratory parameters that were judged to be related to 
tofacitinib. Subjects had to be receiving permitted background csDMARDs, eg, methotrexate, 
sulfasalazine or leflunomide, in accordance with the local regulatory label. Stable doses of oral steroids 
and NSAIDs were permitted, in line with the protocols of the qualifying studies. The efficacy endpoints 
matched those evaluated in the qualifying studies, and was evaluated every 3 months.  
A total of 685 subjects were enrolled (363 from study 1091 and 322 from study 1125). Of these, 680 
were treated and 72 (10.6%) have discontinued at data cut-off. All 680 treated patients were evaluated 
for efficacy. A total of 661 (97.2%) reported concomitant DMARD treatment on day 1.  
Efficacy data is provided up to Month 15:

Study A3921119: A Phase 2, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Dose Ranging 
Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Tofacitinib in Subjects with Active Ankylosing Spondylitis 
(AS) 
This study was conducted between April 2013 and March 2015.  This multi-centre study was designed to 
characterise the dose-response of tofacitinib in adult subjects with active AS per New York classification 
criteria. Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive either tofacitinib 2 mg, 5 mg, or 
10 mg BID or placebo for 12 weeks. Subjects had to have active AS defined as Bath Ankylosing 
Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score of ≥4 and back pain score (BASDAI Question 2) of ≥4 
despite treatment with NSAIDs (or intolerance to NSAIDs). The primary efficacy endpoint was ASAS20 
response rate at 12 weeks of treatment. 
A total of 208 subjects were randomised, 52 to each treatment group. Eleven subjects discontinued.

The ASAS 40 response at Week 12 was 42.31%, 46.15%, 38.46% and 19.61% for the tofacitinib 2 mg

Study A3921137: A Phase 3, Multi Site, Randomized, Double-Blind Study of the Long-Term 
Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of 2 Oral Doses of CP 690,550 in Subjects with Moderate to 
Severe Plaque Psoriasis and/or Psoriatic Arthritis 
This study was conducted at 16 centres in Japan. A total of 94 subjects were treated, 87 with psoriasis 
and 12 with PsA (5 subjects were included in both disease populations). Subjects were randomised 1:1 to 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID or tofacitinib 10 mg BID. There was a 16-week double-blind period followed by a 36-
week open-label period.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The PsA clinical development programme was designed to evaluate the efficacy of tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
and 10 mg BID in patients with active PsA with inadequate response or intolerance to csDMARD (TNFi 
naïve) (study 1091) or TNFi (study 1125). Both studies were multi-centre, phase 3 randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety studies. Study 1091 lasted one year whereas study 1125 
lasted 6 months. Both studies were too short to support claims related to structural progression. 
Subjects were selected based on CASPAR criteria, ≥3 tender/painful and ≥3 swollen joints, the presence 
of signs and symptoms for at least 6 months, and the presence of active psoriasis. These are established 
criteria with high specificity for PsA diagnosis although are mainly used in research and clinical trials and 
at a lesser extent in clinical practice. The eligibility criteria were adequate to define a population with 
active PsA and an inadequate response to a prior DMARD. 
Of note, PsA has a multifaceted phenotype that may include arthritis of peripheral joints, skin and nail 
disease, entheseal involvement, dactylitis and axial disease; however, no formal requirement for skin 
manifestations, enthesitis, or dactylitis at baseline was included in the studies. Therefore, the target 
population mainly reflects the PsA phenotype with polyarticular peripheral joint involvement with or 
without axial disease. This pattern of disease represents the predominant one in the clinical setting, and 
for this reason it is agreed to be the main population of PsA to be enrolled in clinical trials.  
All subjects were required to remain on background csDMARD for the duration of the studies, of which 
88% were treated with MTX. Both studies included a 3-month placebo phase, after which placebo patients 
were allocated (per baseline randomisation) tofacitinib 5 mg BID or 10 mg BID. In addition, study 1091 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/197115/2018 
Page 102/150 
 
  
  
 
included the active comparator adalimumab, a TNFα inhibitor approved in Europe for the treatment of 
active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous DMARD therapy has 
been inadequate. The inclusion of an active control arm allows contextualisation of study results. The 
study designs are in line with CHMP scientific advice and are acceptable to demonstrate an effect on 
signs, symptoms, function and health outcomes, including maintenance of effect. Subjects could continue 
a stable dose of corticosteroids, opioids, acetaminophen or NSAIDs during the study. 
For both studies, the co-primary endpoints were ACR20 response rate and ΔHAQ-DI at Month 3. These 
primary endpoints measure signs, symptoms, and function. ACR20 has been widely used as a primary 
endpoint in PsA registration studies. Secondary endpoints further evaluated the signs and symptoms of 
psoriasis, enthesitis, dactylitis and axial spondylitis, as well as health outcomes and quality of life. In 
addition, change from baseline in mTSS at one year was evaluated in study 1091, to assess prevention of 
structural progression. The choice of primary and secondary endpoints was in line with CHMP advice, and 
with the EMA Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of psoriatic 
arthritis (CHMP/EWP/438/04).  
A total of 422 subjects were randomised in study 1091, and 395 in study 1125. More than two-thirds of 
subjects in Study 1091 (TNFi-naïve) were recruited in Eastern Europe and Russia (68.2%), while in Study 
A3921125 (TNFi-IR), the geographical distribution of subjects was more balanced. This may be due to 
differences in access to TNFi across regions. Across both studies, the number of EU subjects studied 
(n=462) was adequate. Across both studies, mean age was 49 years, 54% of subjects were female and 
95% of subjects were white. The baseline disease characteristics were consistent with a population with 
active PsA, and a severity level recognised to require treatment change. Baseline characteristics were 
generally balanced between treatment groups.  
The full analysis set was analysed in both studies. This corresponded to an ITT population and is 
acceptable. The overall discontinuation rates were low (3.8 - 5.6% in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID arm up to 
Month 3). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study 1091 outcomes 
For the co-primary endpoint of ACR20 at Month 3, the response rate for the proposed dose of tofacitinib 5 
mg BID was 50.5%, in line with the active comparator adalimumab. This represented a 17.1% increase 
over placebo, which is statistically significant and clinically relevant. The ACR20 response is maintained 
up to Month 12 for the active treatment groups. A separation from placebo is observed as early as 2 
weeks for tofacitinib 5 mg BID. A dose response is evident.  
For the co-primary endpoint of ΔHAQ-DI at Month 3, the LS mean treatment difference for tofacitinib 5 
mg BID vs placebo was -0.17. This difference was in line with that observed for adalimumab. The effects 
are maintained until Month 12. The MCID (change from baseline) for HAQ-DI is 0.35. For the 90% of 
subjects with baseline HAQ-DI ≥0.35, 53.1% of the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group reported a decrease of 
≥0.35, the minimum clinically relevant difference, compared to 30.9% for the placebo group. This 
responder analysis supports the clinical relevance of the HAQ-DI results. 
Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the results on the primary endpoints, and generally 
consistent findings were seen across subgroups. 
Secondary endpoints included the ACR50, for which a clear separation from placebo was observed, with a 
treatment difference of 28.0% for tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 33.0% for adalimumab at Month 3, and a 
maintenance of the effect until Month 12. A dose response is evident. For ACR70, the respective 
treatment differences were 16.8% and 18.9%. For MDA, the respective treatment differences were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/197115/2018 
Page 103/150 
 
  
  
19.5% and 18.8%. Regarding the radiographic evaluations, the mean changes from baseline and the 
progressor rates were low, providing reassurance of a lack of deleterious effect. No specific claim on 
treatment effect on joint damage is possible based on these data. In general, the secondary endpoint 
results were supportive of the primary outcomes. In particular, there was evidence of consistent benefit 
for health outcome measures such as SF36 and FACIT-F.   
Study 1125 outcomes 
For the co-primary endpoint of ACR20 at Month 3, the response rate for the proposed dose of tofacitinib 5 
mg BID was 49.6%, in line with study 1091. This represented a 26.0% increase over placebo, which is 
statistically significant and clinically relevant. The ACR20 response is maintained up to Month 12 for the 
active treatment groups. A separation from placebo is observed as early as 2 weeks for tofacitinib 5 mg 
BID.  
For the co-primary endpoint of ΔHAQ-DI at Month 3, the LS mean treatment difference for tofacitinib 5 
mg BID vs placebo was -0.25. This difference was in line with that observed for study 1092. The effects 
are maintained until Month 12. For the 90% of subjects with baseline HAQ-DI ≥0.35, 50.0% of the 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID group reported a decrease of ≥0.35, the MCID, compared to 27.6% for the placebo 
group. This responder analysis supports the clinical relevance of the HAQ-DI results. 
Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the results on the primary endpoints, and generally 
consistent findings were seen across subgroups. 
Secondary endpoints included the ACR50, for which a clear separation from placebo was observed, with a 
treatment difference of 15.3% for tofacitinib 5 mg BID, and maintenance of the effect until Month 12. 
Benefits for tofacitinib 5 mg BID in terms of ACR70 response rate and % subjects with MDA were less 
clear. This may reflect a more treatment resistant population, compared to study 1091. In general, the 
other secondary endpoint results were supportive of the primary outcomes. In particular, there was 
evidence of consistent benefit for health outcome measures such as SF36, FACIT-F and EQ-5D.  
Skin involvement 
The evaluation of tofacitinib treatment effect on skin manifestations is partially hampered by the lack of a 
pre-determined minimum number of psoriatic plaques at baseline. The main endpoint to test tofacitinib 
efficacy on skin manifestations was PASI75 at month 3. Patients were evaluated only if their body surface 
area was affected by psoriasis for > 3% (BSA >3%), and their PASI score was >0. Although BSA >3% 
cut-off includes patients with a relatively low involvement of skin in their clinical presentation of the 
disease, recent data from the Consortium of Rheumatology Investigators of North America (Corrona) 
indicate a direct relation between skin and joint disease and show a link between BSA > 3% and worse 
outcomes in PsA patients.  
In the csDMARD-IR subjects, both 5mg (PASI75 met by 42.68% of patients) and 10mg (PASI75 met by 
44.29% of patients) tofacitinib doses were statistically superior to placebo (PASI75 met by 14.63%) at a 
similar extend.  The effect increased over time, resulting more pronounced with the 10 mg BID dose at 
both 6 and 12 months after treatment initiation (10 mg BID dose: 44.29% at month 3; 60% at month 6 
and 67.14% at month 12; 5mg dose:42.68% at month 3; 46.34% at month 6 and 56.10% at month 12).   
In the TNF-IR population, only the high tofacitinib dose showed superiority over placebo at month 3. 
Treatment effect was stable, with no substantial increase at month 6 observed with the 10 mg BID dose. 
The low tofacitinib dose did show some improvement in the response rate over time.  
Enthesitis 
Enthesitis is a major feature of PsA, and is generally measured both as an indicator of disease activity 
and treatment response. No specific requirement for enthesitis was included in the eligibility rules. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/197115/2018 
Page 104/150 
 
  
  
Consequently, only a proportion of enrolled subjects presented at baseline with enthesitis (66.4%and 
70.1% of subjects in Study A3921091 and A3921125, respectively), and were thus assessed for 
treatment effect. Mean baseline LEI values ranged from 2.3 to 3 across the 4 treatment groups of study 
A3921091 and from 2.8 to 3.4 across the 3 treatment groups of study A3921125. 
In the csDMARD-IR population, only the 10 mg BID tofacitinib dose proved statistically superior to 
placebo at month 3, albeit with a difference in mean LEI of only 1.0 (0.29) point, rather similar the 0.7 
point that was observed as maximal difference of LEI values across treatment groups at baseline. 
Treatment effect slightly increased over time for both tofacitinib doses, resulting in similar differences 
from placebo at both 6 and 12 months of treatment (6 months: -1.2 and -1.3 for 10 mg BID and 5 mg 
BID respectively; 12 months:  1.6 and -1.7 for 10 mg BID and 5 mg BID respectively). 
A post hoc supportive analysis on enthesitis resolution showed consistent results.  Moreover, results 
obtained using the SPARCC index for the evaluation of enthesitis were in line with those obtained using 
the LEI index, with tofacitinib 5 mg BID (-1.84) not achieving nominal statistical significance compared to 
placebo.  
In the TNF-IR population the effect on enthesitis (mean ∆LEI at Month 3) was nominally superior (the 
step wise approach was stopped at prior step, therefore P are nominal) to placebo for both doses, of 
similar extent, and maintained over time. However, the difference from placebo was 0.9 and 0.8 for 
tofacitinib 5 mgBID and 10 mg BID, respectively, again rather similar to the maximum difference in mean 
LEI baseline values (0.6) observed across the 3 treatment groups at baseline. Evaluation of enthesitis 
using the ∆SPARCC index at month 3, and the supportive analysis of the enthesitis resolution rate 
resulted in overall consistent results with the ∆LEI analysis, although an expected worse performance of 
the 10 mg BID dose was observed at 3 months in terms of resolution of enthesitis. In conclusion, 
tofacitinib effect on enthesitis appears of limited magnitude. Indeed, low mean baseline values prevent 
the evaluation of treatment effect in patients with larger enthesitis burden.   
The MAH provided stratified data on tofacitinib effect on enthesitis according to baseline Leeds Enthesitis 
Index (LEI) (≤3, >3 and ≤4, >4) and Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) 
Enthesitis Index scores (≤4, >4 and ≤10, >10) to facilitate assessment of the impact of baseline disease 
burden on patient responsiveness to tofacitinib. For both indexes the highest cutoffs (>4 or >10 for the 
LEI and SPARCC, respectively) were not provided due to the low number of patients per treatment group. 
In general, the maximum response observed for improvements in enthesitis occurred later on treatment, 
beyond the placebo-controlled period of 3 months, indicating a lower onset of clinically relevant effect. 
The comparison with adalimumab further confirmed the tofacitinib delayed onset of action, particularly 
when absence of enthesitis was selected as outcome measure. When LSM change from baseline in LEI 
and SPARCC enthesitis index scores are considered, tofacitinib 5 mg BID treatment effect is observed 
independently of disease burden, with a trend towards larger magnitude of effect in patients with higher 
burden of the disease, similar to what observed in the adalimumab group. However, when the more 
stringent endpoint, absence of enthesitis, is considered, patients with higher burden of the disease tended 
to respond to tofacitinib treatment with smaller improvement (especially in terms of SPARCC score) and 
much more slowly compared to those with lower disease burden.  
In conclusion, efficacy towards enthesitis appears limited and delayed in onset. 
Dactylitis 
Dactylitis is a common and painful extra-articular manifestation of PsA, representing a combination of 
synovitis and inflammation of tendon and ligament insertions. It has been shown that digits with dactylitis 
are associated with a greater degree of radiological damage than those which occur in digits not affected 
by dactylitis, thus treatment efficacy on dactylitis is a relevant outcome measure for patients with PsA. No 
baseline pre-requisite for dactylitis was specified in the inclusion criteria of the pivotal studies, thus only a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/197115/2018 
Page 105/150 
 
  
  
proportion of patients were affected with dactylitis at baseline (56% and 49% of subjects in A3921091 
and A3921125 study, respectively), and differences in baseline ranges of the Dactylitis Severity Score 
were observed among treatment groups, with the lowest severity range of dactylitis detected in the 
placebo group of study A3921125.   
In the csDMARD-IR population at month 3, only the tofacitinib 10 mg BID dose was nominally superior 
(the step wise approach was stopped at prior step, therefore P are nominal) to placebo in ameliorating 
the Dactylitis Severity Score (DSS). However, the effect of the tofacitinib 5 mg BID dose improved over 
time, reaching magnitudes similar to those obtained with the 10 mg BID dose from month 6 onwards. 
Similar slower onset of treatment effect was observed with the 5 mg BID dose also in terms of resolution 
rates, although in this case the magnitude of treatment effect was always lower than that obtained with 
the 10 mg BID dose. In TNFi-IR patients, improvements in ∆DSS at month 3 were similar and nominally 
higher than placebo for both tofacitinib doses (-5.2 and -5.4 LS mean for the 5mg and 10mg bid, 
respectively), with only minor further improvements over time. Consistent results were seen when 
resolution rates were analyzed. Differences in baseline dactylitis severity, with a greater number of 
affected digits and greater DSS at baseline in TNFi naïve pts vs TNFi experienced patients, may have 
contributed to the different outcomes in the two study populations.  
CHMP considered that the discussion provided by the MAH satisfactorily addressed the different 
performance of tofacitinib 5mg bid in the two studies. 
Axial domain 
The numbers included in the BASDAI analysis were small, due to the low numbers with spondylitis that 
were enrolled. Even more important, the BASDAI is not considered the optimal tool to investigate 
treatment induced amelioration of axial spondylitis and no confirmation of treatment effect on axial 
damage by imaging data has been provided.  
Results are considered not satisfactory with only the 10 mg BID dose showing some effect in the 
csDMARD-IR population, and no nominal difference from placebo for both tofacitinib doses in the TNFi-IR 
population. In both cases, no substantial improvement of treatment effect over time was observed. 
Negative results for both tofacitinib doses were also obtained in the subset of csDMARD-IR and TNFalpha-
IR subjects with higher disease activity (BASDAI >4 cm), where the mean ∆BASDAI at Month 3 was not 
nominally higher than placebo. On the contrary, nominally significant differences from placebo were 
obtained, in this setting, with adalimumab. 
In the attempt to support the limited information on treatment effect on axial spondylitis, the MAH 
provided results from the A3921119 study, investigating tofacitinib efficacy in adult subjects with 
imaging-verified axial spondylitis, and suggesting efficacy of both tofacitinib doses in axial disease. 
However, supportive data in AS patients, although overall supporting of tofacitinib efficacy on axial 
disease, cannot overcome the limitations in the assessment of axial damage in PsA patients of the two 
pivotal studies (small sample size, lack of imaging verification and specific assessment for axial 
spondylitis). As such, at present, it is difficult to soundly conclude on tofacitinib efficacy in axial disease, 
on the basis of the data provided. 
A statement has been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC that the number of PsA patients with axial 
involvement/predominant spondylitis was too small to allow meaningful assessment. 
Supportive studies 
Study 1092 is the on-going extension study for protocols A3921091 and A3921125. Eligible subjects 
received open-label tofacitinib 5 mg BID with concomitant csDMARD on entry for up to 3 years. A total of 
685 subjects were enrolled (363 from study 1091 and 322 from study 1125). Of these, 680 were treated 
and 72 (10.6%) have discontinued at data cut-off. In general, the improvements observed during the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/197115/2018 
Page 106/150 
 
  
  
main studies were maintained over the 12-month observation period of the extension study. For this 
interim analysis, numbers of subjects included in the analyses at each visit decreased over time because 
of staggered entry in the study and subject discontinuation from the study. However, the results provide 
reassurance regarding long-term efficacy. 
Target population 
Most data derive from (i) subjects that were taking methotrexate at baseline and/or (ii) subjects that 
were treated with methotrexate concomitantly.   
Around 6% of the population of study A3921091 (csDMARD-IR) had an inadequate response to one 
csDMARD other than MTX. In addition, 1.4% had an inadequate response to >1 csDMARD that did not 
include MTX. These subgroups are too small for meaningful efficacy analyses. However, the subgroup 
with an inadequate response to >1 csDMARD can provide supportive information, since this patients in 
this subgroup (>1 csDMARD-IR) had an inadequate response to a csDMARD other than MTX, and should 
represent a more difficult to treat population. The MAH has compared the efficacy outcomes of the >1 
csDMARD subgroup vs 1 csDMARD-IR subgroup (predominantly MTX-IR). Regarding efficacy at Month 3, 
the >1 csDMARD subgroup appear to derive more benefit from tofacitinib but less benefit from 
adalimumab, compared to the 1 csDMARD subgroup, across most of the relevant endpoints. The MAH 
also provided a supportive analysis of the RA clinical efficacy dataset. The ACR response rates and HAQ-
DI change from baseline at Month 3 were comparable for ‘csDMARD-IR but not MTX-IR or bDMARD-IR’ 
and MTX-IR subgroups. This provides additional evidence that patients who are csDMARD-IR but not 
MTX-IR would be expected to benefit from tofacitinib. The low level of recruitment to study A3921091 of 
patients who failed a csDMARD other than MTX reflects clinical practice. Most patients will receive MTX as 
first-line. Patients with a contraindication or intolerance to MTX, and an inadequate response to an 
alternative csDMARD, were not studied in large numbers. It would be difficult to design a study to include 
more of these patients, given current treatment guidelines. It seems unlikely that this group would 
benefit less from tofacitinib treatment compared to MTX-IR patients.  
To address concerns regarding the evidence for use in combination with csDMARDs other than MTX, the 
MAH has pooled data from study A3921091 (csDMARD-IR) and A3921125 (bDMARD-IR). This strategy is 
acceptable since the studies were similar in design. Across both studies 21.8% received concomitant 
csDMARD other than MTX. The pooled group corresponding to ‘other csDMARD’ included 52 patients in 
the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group and 43 in the placebo group. Of the 52 patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
group, 30 patients took sulfasalazine and 19 patients took leflunomide. Overall the efficacy outcomes 
across a range of endpoints were comparable. Efficacy as measured by ACR response rates favoured the 
‘MTX only’ group but efficacy as measured by ΔHAQ-DI, ΔLEI and ΔDSS favoured the ‘other csDMARD’ 
group. Supportive evidence from the RA database also suggests comparable efficacy outcomes 
irrespective of concomitant csDMARD. However, there is insufficient data to conclude on the safety of 
Xeljanz, in combination with csDMARDs other than MTX (see benefit risk discussion).  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
For the co-primary endpoints of ACR20 response rate and ΔHAQ-DI, superiority to placebo has been 
demonstrated for the 5 mg BID dose, on background csDMARD therapy, in PsA subjects with inadequate 
response to or intolerance to prior DMARDs. These endpoints relate mainly to signs and symptoms of 
peripheral arthritis which however are predominant in most PsA patients compared to other clinical 
manifestations of the disease. A statement has been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC that the number 
of PsA patients with axial involvement/predominant spondylitis was too small to allow meaningful 
assessment. There is no evidence of a deleterious effect on joint structure.

Outcomes for the secondary endpoints are generally in line with the primary endpoints. However, for 
disease manifestations of skin involvement, dactylitis and enthesitis, the outcomes are less convincing 
and less consistent across the two pivotal studies. This may be due in part to the inclusion of patients 
without these manifestations, and therefore reduced power to demonstrate statistically significant 
treatment effects within study. The secondary endpoint outcomes are adequately reflected in section 5.1 
of the SmPC.  
There is some evidence that a dose of 10 mg BID may be associated with increased benefit compared to 
5 mg BID, although a difference is not consistently observed across all endpoints. This finding is in line 
with the PK-PD modelling (see section 2.3.4). The proposed dose of 5 mg BID has been justified based on 
safety considerations, in particular the dose dependency of serious infections, opportunistic infections and 
laboratory parameters. 
The approved indication and posology are adequately supported by the available clinical efficacy data. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Tofacitinib is already approved for the treatment of moderate to severe RA. Tofacitinib causes 
neutropenia and lymphopenia, and is associated with a risk of serious infections (e.g. pneumonia) and 
opportunistic infections (e.g. herpes zoster). The incidence rate for serious infection was 3.6 per 100 
patient year (PY) during the RA programme compared to 1.7 for placebo; there was a higher incidence in 
the elderly. Neoplasms represent an important potential risk due to the mechanism of action. Common 
ADRs include headache, URTI, nasopharyngitis, diarrhoea, nausea, hypertension.  
Studies A3921125 and A3921091, the two pivotal studies for this application, were pooled for the 
evaluation of safety, as follows: 
-  Cohort 1 (placebo-controlled comparison) is derived from the 0-3 month placebo-controlled phase 
of both studies, and is used to compare tofacitinib with placebo (and with adalimumab for study 
1091) 
-  Cohort 2 (6-month dose comparison) is derived from the 6 months of active treatment in both 
studies, and is used to compare tofacitinib doses (and with adalimumab for study 1091); subjects 
originally allocated to placebo are not included.  
-  Cohort 2a (12-month dose comparison) is derived from 6 months of treatment in study 1125 and 
12 months of treatment in study 1091 and is used to compare tofacitinib doses (and with 
adalimumab for study 1091). This cohort includes the active treatment phase of subjects 
originally allocated to placebo (‘All Tofa 5mg’ and ‘All Tofa 10mg’).  
-  Cohort 3 (All PsA) is derived from the entire tofacitinib experience for subjects with PsA, including 
extension study 1092. The 5 mg and 10 mg doses are combined. Using this cohort, analyses were 
conducted based on average total daily dose, and for subjects while receiving tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
(constant 5 mg BID dosing group). This cohort was used to evaluate AEs over time.  
External independent adjudication committees were established for reviews of potential AEs of 
opportunistic infections (OIs), malignancies, cardiovascular (CV) events, hepatic events, and 
gastrointestinal (GI) perforations.  
In addition, the following sets of supportive safety data, to complement the main safety data set, have 
also been provided:

- 
Integrated safety datasets of Tofacitinib in the Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriasis Development 
Programs. These data will provide context to compare the similarity of rates, risk factor analysis, 
and to assess rates of certain safety events, especially those with long-latency periods (such as 
malignancies) after exposures to tofacitinib for longer periods than have been studied in PsA to 
date. 
-  Safety Data from the Literature (Clinical Trial and Observational). These data will allow to 
contextualize IR for infections of interest, malignancies and CV events in the tofacitinib PsA 
programme and to complement the adalimumab active control from the A3921091 study. 
Safety Data from an External Comparison Cohort. Since the type of data available from published 
observational sources or published clinical study are limited, in terms of populations and outcomes, data 
from an external population (‘comparison cohort’) are presented. This comparison cohort is a 
retrospective descriptive cohort of adults age 18 years of age and older with moderate to severe PsA from 
the Antirheumatic Therapies in Sweden (ARTIS) database, a Swedish biologics registry. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 738 PsA subjects were treated with tofacitinib in the clinical development programme. There 
were 1237.89 patient-years of exposure, as of the data lock point of 07/03/2017. The exposure to 
tofacitinib is summarised in the following table:

Adverse events 
Definitions and calculations 
Incidence rate (IR) estimates and the corresponding number (%) of subjects with an event are calculated 
by inclusion of events occurring up to 28 days beyond the last dose (or to the data-lock point date for 
ongoing studies).  
Exposure (PY) is defined as the total follow-up time calculated up to the day of the first event within the 
event counting period for subjects with the event or the last dose day plus a risk period of 28 days 
beyond the last dose (or to the data data-lock point date for ongoing studies) for subjects without events.  
These definitions were chosen because reporting to the company safety database may occur at any time 
regardless of the time elapsed from the last administration of study drug or since study completion. 
Inclusion of all events without regard to elapsed time may inflate IR estimations as the exposure time 
(denominator) is not similarly increased.  
In order to provide a measure of comparison (controlled for study) of the estimated IRs between 
treatment groups in Cohorts 1, 2 and 2a, hazard ratio (HR) for the treatment effect were calculated from 
a Cox regression model with treatment arm and study as covariates. 
Placebo-controlled comparison 
Treatment-emergent AEs were reported by 47.9%, 49.6%, 40.3% and 46.2% of subjects in the 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID, tofacitinib 10 mg BID, placebo and adalimumab groups respectively. Severe AEs 
were reported by 1.7%, 2.5%, 2.5% and 1.9%, respectively.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Five deaths were reported up to 07/03/2017 during the PsA clinical development programme, all in 
subjects receiving tofacitinib 5 mg BID. The preferred terms were: pancreatic cell carcinoma metastatic, 
cardiac arrest, acute cardiac failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary embolus.  
Three deaths occurred more than 28 days after the last dose. All deaths were considered by the 
Investigator to be unrelated to study drug.  
Serious adverse events 
There were 4 (1.7%) subjects with SAEs in each of the tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 10 mg BID and placebo 
treatment groups, and 1 subject (0.9%) with a SAE for adalimumab during the 3-month placebo-
controlled period.  
For the 12-month dose comparison cohort, there were 15 events each in the All Tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
(4.3%) and All Tofacitinib 10 mg BID (4.4%) groups. For study 1091, the incidence rates for SAEs over 
12 months were 8 (7.5%), 4 (3.8%), and 9 (8.5%).  
There were three SAEs of malignancy in the 12-month cohort, all in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group. These 
are discussed in more detail below under ‘adverse events of special interest’. The incidence rates of 
infections and infestations SAEs during this time were low and comparable between tofacitinib and 
adalimumab, affecting 2 (0.8%), 3 (1.3%) and 1 (0.9%) of subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID and adalimumab groups, respectively.  
For the all PsA cohort, the incidence rates for SAEs were 12.7% (61 subjects) and 11.6% (35 subjects) in 
the Average Tofacitinib 5 mg BID and Average Tofacitinib 10 mg BID groups.

Adverse events of special interest 
Serious infections (SIs) 
In the PsA program, SIs was defined, per protocol, as infections that required parenteral antimicrobial 
therapy or hospitalisation for treatment or management, or met other criteria that required that the 
event be classified as serious. 
During the 3-month placebo-controlled period, two subjects, both on tofacitinib 10 mg BID, reported a SI.  
For the 12-month dose comparison cohort (including tofacitinib-exposed period for subjects that were 
initially randomised to placebo), the incidence rates (per 100 patient year) were 1.99, 1.53 and 1.08 for 
All Tofacitinib 5 mg BID, All Tofacitinib 10 mg BID and adalimumab. An analysis of incidence rates for SIs 
in the psoriasis, RA and PsA tofacitinib development programmes in comparable cohorts (NB the PsA 
cohort does not include subjects initially randomised to placebo) was provided: 
Figure 37 - Incidence Rates for Serious Infections in PsA, RA, and psoriasis 12-month dose-comparison 
For the All PsA cohort, including longer-term treatment, the incidence rate for SI was 1.43 per 100 PY for 
all doses, with little difference between the Average Tofacitinib 5 mg BID group and the Average 
Tofacitinib 10 mg BID group (1.53 vs 1.28).  
Incidence rates of SIs by months of exposure, at 6-monthly intervals has also been presented. There is 
no evidence of an association between duration of exposure and incidence rate. A risk factor analysis was 
also conducted. Trends are observed for higher incidence rates for subjects with a history of diabetes, 
prior TNFi experience (versus the TNFi naïve population), and concomitant systemic corticosteroid use at 
baseline. 
Eighteen SIs were reported during the PsA clinical development programme; none were fatal. By PT, the 
commonest SI was pneumonia (4 cases). 
Neutrophils 
For the 6-month dose comparison cohort, the incidence rate (per 100 PY) for neutropenia was 1.68, 1.71 
and 1.71 for tofacitinib 5 mg BID, tofacitinib 10 mg BID and adalimumab. There was one discontinuation 
due to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1000 x 103/mm3. There was no clear association between the 
incidence of SI, and the confirmed ANC prior to the event.

Figure 39 - Mean Change from Baseline (+/- SE) in Absolute Lymphocyte Count (103/mm3) (6-month dose 
comparison, Cohort 2) 
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) evaluation of lymphocyte subsets in tofacitinib-treated patients 
(6-month dose comparison cohort) showed an increase in B cell (CD19+) counts and a decrease in T cell 
(CD3+, CD4+, CD8+) counts and natural killer (NK) (CD16+CD56+) counts. The largest mean % 
reduction from baseline was for NK (-9.68% in the combined tofacitinib group). In general, the reductions 
from baseline were greater at 6 months compared to 3 months. 
Herpes zoster 
For the 3-month placebo-controlled cohort, there were 2 herpes zoster (HZ) events for tofacitinib 5 mg 
BID, one for tofacitinib 10 mg BID and none for adalimumab or placebo. For the 12-month dose 
comparison (cohort 2a), the incidence rates (per 100 PY) were 1.50, 2.04, and 0.00 for All Tofacitinib 5 
mg BID, All Tofacitinib 10 mg BID and adalimumab. An analysis of incidence rates for SIs in the psoriasis, 
RA and PsA tofacitinib development programmes in comparable cohorts (NB the PsA cohort does not 
include subjects initially randomised to placebo) has been provided:

Figure 40 - Incidence Rates for HZ in PsA, RA, and psoriasis 12-month dose- comparison 
In the All PsA cohort (cohort 3), 26 cases (in 26 subjects) of HZ were reported, with incidence rates 2.07 
and 2.17 (per 100 PY) in Average Tofacitinib 5 mg BID and Average Tofacitinib 10 mg BID, respectively. 
The majority of cases (22) involved a single dermatome. One event was graded severe. None were 
disseminated, as determined by the adjudication committee.    
Incidence rates of SIs by months of exposure, at 6-monthly intervals has also been presented. There is 
no evidence of an association between duration of exposure and incidence rate.  A risk factor analysis 
was also conducted. Trends are observed for higher incidence rates for subjects with a history of prior 
TNFi experience (versus the TNFi naïve population), age and Asian ethnicity. 
Opportunistic infections (including tuberculosis) 
Three HZ cases were classified as opportunistic infection. No other types of opportunistic infection were 
identified during the PsA programme. No subjects were reported to have developed an active TB infection 
during the PsA programme.  
Malignancies 
All treatment-emergent reports of malignancies (eg, those occurring following at least one dose of study 
drug) are described regardless of how long study drug was discontinued prior to event onset. However, 
only events occurring within the 28 days after the last dose of study drug are included in the IR 
calculations. All events identified as potential malignancies were assessed by a Malignancy Adjudication 
Committee.  
For the 3-month placebo-controlled cohort, 2 malignancies (bladder transitional cell carcinoma and vulva 
squamous cell carcinoma) were reported in subjects taking tofacitinib 5 mg BID. No additional cases were 
seen for the 6-month dose comparison cohort. One additional malignancy was reported for the 12-month 
dose comparison cohort (invasive ductal breast cancer) in a subject taking tofacitinib 5 mg BID, giving an 
incidence rate of 1.49 per 100 PY for All Tofacitinib 5 mg BID, compared to 0.00 for tofacitinib 10 mg BID 
or adalimumab.

A total of 9 malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) were identified during tofacitinib 
treatment of up to 28 days after stopping treatment. Eight cases occurred in subjects receiving tofacitinib 
5 mg BID and one case occurred in a subject receiving tofacitinib 10 mg BID at the time of the events. 
Two cases were randomised to adalimumab prior to the extension study. The six cases identified during 
the extension study were: renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, 
medullary thyroid carcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma and Huerthle cell carcinoma of the thyroid.   This 
gives an overall incidence rate for tofacitinib of 0.72 per 100 PY. An analysis of incidence rates for SIs in 
the psoriasis, RA and PsA tofacitinib development programmes has been provided: 
Figure 41 - Exposure Estimates and Incidence Rates for Malignancies (Excluding NMSC) in PsA, RA, and 
PsO 
Incidence rates of SIs by months of exposure, at 6-monthly intervals has also been presented. There is 
no evidence of an association between duration of exposure and incidence rate.  
An additional case (bladder papillary transitional cell carcinoma) was identified after the 28-day post-
treatment period and was therefore not included in the incidence rate calculations. 
Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) 
No cases were reported for the 3-month placebo-controlled cohort. One case was reported in the 12-
month dose comparison cohort, in a subject taking tofacitinib 10 mg BID. This equates to an incidence 
rate of 0.66 per 100 PY, which is in line with the rates of 0.58 (5 mg BID) and 0.50 (10 mg BID) 
observed for RA in a similar cohort.  
Seven cases were reported for the All PsA cohort, 2 squamous cell carcinomas and 5 basal cell 
carcinomas. Of these, 3 were reported in the first year. This equates to an incidence rate of 0.51 
(Average 5 mg BID) and 0.64 (Average 10 mg BID).

For the 3-month placebo-controlled cohort, the mean % increase in total cholesterol at Month 3 was 8.48, 
12.13, 1.87 and 9.88 for tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 10 mg BID, placebo and adalimumab respectively. Data 
from the 12-month cohort shows that levels stabilise at Month 3. For LDL-cholesterol, the respective 
mean % changes are 9.20, 14.03, 3.98 and 9.17. For HDL-cholesterol, the respective mean % changes 
are 10.02, 13.95, -0.81 and 6.91.

There is some evidence of increase after 18 months, although confidence intervals are wide.  
AEs of hypertension were identified based on the standardised MedDRA query (SMQ) for Hypertension 
(narrow). For the 12-month dose comparison cohort (2), the incidence rate was 8.55, 7.00 and 6.93 per 
100 PY for tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 10 mg BID and adalimumab, respectively. For the All PsA cohort, the 
incidence rate was 4.81 for all tofacitinib doses, with no difference between average doses. Four 
hypertension events resulted in discontinuation from tofacitinib for the All PsA cohort. There were 3 SAEs 
of hypertension.  
MACE 
Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) were adjudicated externally. For the 12-month dose 
comparison period (cohort 2a), there were 3 MACE events, one each for tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 10 mg BID 
and adalimumab. For All PsA (cohort 3), there was one additional MACE, which equates to an incidence 
rate of 0.24 per 100 PY (all doses). This is in line with the incidence rate of 0.38 observed for tofacitinib 
in RA. A further 2 MACE occurred after 28 days from the last dose of tofacitinib. The 5 MACE events 
associated with tofacitinib were 2 sudden cardiac deaths, 2 myocardial infarctions and one ischaemic 
stroke.  
Rates of MACE in PsA from observational studies were presented. The UK THIN database reported an 
incidence rate of 0.46 per 100 PY among DMARD-exposed PsA patients. Rates were 0.49 – 0.55 for ARTIS 
cohorts. 
Gastrointestinal perforations 
The PsA programme specifically excluded subjects considered at increased risk for GI perforations, e.g. 
those with a history of diverticulitis. A single event of GI perforation occurred during the PsA programme

up to the data-lock point of 07/03/2017. This was a perforated appendix in a 45-year-old male subject on 
day 18 of tofacitinib 5 mg BID. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Table 50 - Number (%) of Subjects with Confirmed Liver Function Test Values as Multiples of Upper Limit 
of Normal, without Regard to Baseline Abnormality: 6-month dose comparison (Cohort 2) 
For the All PsA cohort, 6 subjects (0.8%) had 2 consecutive elevated ALT ≥3x ULN; 2 subjects had 2 
consecutive elevated ALT ≥5x ULN; one subjects had 2 consecutive elevated ALT ≥10x ULN. One subject 
had 2 consecutive AST ≥3x ULN and one subject had 2 consecutive elevated AST ≥5x ULN. No subjects 
had 2 consecutive bilirubin ≥2x ULN. There were no discontinuations due to liver enzyme elevations in 
tofacitinib-treated subjects.    
There were 4 reported cases of hepatic steatosis in the 6-month dose comparison cohort, one case each 
for tofacitinib 5 mg BID and adalimumab, and 2 cases for the tofacitinib 10 mg BID. Nine cases were 
reported in the All PsA cohort; giving an incidence rate of 0.64 per 100 PY for all tofacitinib doses. In 
addition, there were 3 cases of ‘liver disorder’ in the PsA cohort. One case was assessed by the external 
adjudication committee as a possible drug-induced liver injury, but did not meet the criteria for Hy’s Law.

Figure 44 - Mean (SE) Change from Baseline in Hb (g/dL) by Visit: 6-month dose comparison (Cohort 2) 
In the All PsA cohort, the median change from baseline to last visit for all doses was -0.1 g/dL. Eleven 
subjects (1.4%) had confirmed Hb decreases of 3g/dL or Hb <7 g/dL. Thirteen (1.7%) AEs of anaemia 
were reported, of which 12 were mild.  
An exposure-response analysis for change in Hb has been submitted. Placebo-adjusted incidences of >2 
g/dL decrease in Hb (90% CI) were predicted to be 1.08% (0.61, 1.64) and 3.01% (1.48, 4.93) at 
median Cavg values of 17.6 ng/mL and 36.1 ng/mL respectively, corresponding to tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
and 10 mg BID. Individual Cavg exposures in the upper quartile of the 10 mg BID dose group showed an 
increase in the proportion of patients experiencing a decrease in Hb of > 2 g/dL. For example, at the 90th 
percentile Cavg (54.8 ng/mL) in the 10 mg BID group, the estimated incidence was ~8%. 
Platelets 
For the 3-month placebo-controlled cohort, median changes in platelets were -16.0 x 103/mm3, -5.0 x 
103/mm3, -3.5 x 103/mm3 and -27.0 x 103/mm3 for tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 10 mg BID, placebo and 
adalimumab. There were 2 events of thrombocytopenia in subjects treated with tofacitinib 10 mg BID and 
one in a subject treated with placebo.   
Changes in all treatment groups remained relatively stable after Month 3. In All PsA (cohort 3), overall 
the median change from baseline in platelets was -4 x 103/mm3. There was 1 subject receiving tofacitinib 
who had confirmed platelet counts <75 x 103/mm3. There were 3 events of thrombocytopenia. 
Creatine kinase 
For the 3-month placebo-controlled cohort, the median increase in creatine kinase from baseline was 31 
U/L, 49 U/L, 2 U/L and 6.0 U/L for tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 10 mg BID, placebo and adalimumab, 
respectively. Up to Month 6, the tofacitinib-associated increases remained stable. For All PsA (cohort 3), 
the median change from baseline to last visit was 73 U/L (all doses). Four (4) subjects (0.5%) in Cohort 3 
who received either tofacitinib dose had confirmed CK levels >5x ULN; no subjects had CK levels >10x 
ULN. There were no subjects reporting AE in the SMQ of rhabdomyolysis in the PsA programme.

Serum creatinine 
For the 3-month placebo-controlled cohort, the median increase in creatine kinase from baseline was 
0.011 mg/dL, 0.034 mg/dL, 0 U/L and 0 U/L for tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 10 mg BID, placebo and 
adalimumab, respectively. Up to Month 6, the tofacitinib-associated increases remained stable. In the All 
PsA cohort (cohort 3), the median change from baseline in serum creatinine was 0.0. In this cohort, 3 
(0.4%) subjects reported AE of increased creatinine by Acute Renal Failure SMQ. The incidence rate for 
all doses was of 0.24 per 100 PY. 
Heart rate 
There were no clinically meaningful changes in heart rate in subjects from either tofacitinib treatment 
group, and decreases in heart rate of approximately 1 beat per minute. No significant changes were seen 
when evaluating the All PsA experience (cohort 3) values.  
Body weight 
There were mean changes from baseline of 1.99 kg for subjects receiving tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 2.2 kg for 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID, and 0.77 kg for adalimumab up to Month 6. 
Electrocardiogram 
A maximum QTcF interval of ≥500 msec was reported for one subject in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group, 
in the 6-month dose comparison cohort. There were two AEs of Electrocardiogram QT prolonged, both of 
mild severity, in the All PsA cohort, all doses. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
A total of 72 subjects ≥65 years received tofacitinib in the PsA programme. The proportion of subjects 
with adverse events, SAEs, severe AEs and discontinuations due to AE was generally increased for 
subjects ≥65 years compared with subjects <65 years for tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 10 mg BID, placebo and 
adalimumab. Subjects on tofacitinib (All PsA) who were ≥65 years of age also experienced increased 
rates of several specific AEs compared with those in the <65 years, including SI (incidence rate 2.63 vs 
1.31 per 100 PY), HZ (3.52 vs 1.96) and MACE (2.64 vs 0). 
Gender 
Overall, the proportion of subjects with adverse events, SAEs, severe AEs and discontinuations due to AE 
was similar for male and female subjects. 
Race 
Most subjects were White. No consistent pattern of difference in AEs or SAEs was evident regarding race.  
Pregnancy and lactation 
In the PsA clinical development programme, there were 7 cases of exposure to tofacitinib during 
pregnancy; of these 7 cases, 4 involved maternal exposure and 3 involved paternal exposure. Exposure 
to tofacitinib occurred in the first trimester in all 7 cases. In 2 of the maternal exposure cases, the 
tofacitinib dose taken was 5 mg BID; the outcomes were 1 spontaneous abortion and 1 premature birth 
(37 weeks with normal newborn). In the other 2 maternal exposure cases, the tofacitinib dose taken was 
10 mg BID, and the outcomes were elective abortion and normal newborn. The dose taken in the paternal 
exposure cases was 5 mg BID in 1 case and 10 mg BID in the other 2 cases. The outcomes of the 
paternal exposure cases were 1 normal newborn, 1 spontaneous abortion, and 1 outcome pending.

Prior TNFi therapy 
In terms of TEAEs the TNFi inadequate responder population tended to have a higher proportion of 
subjects reporting AE (all causalities) compared to the TNFi naïve subjects. Up to 6 months of exposure, 
the pooled data displayed a higher number of events reported for the 5 mg BID dose compared to the 10 
mg BID and placebo groups (Cohort 2).  In Cohort 3, SOC distribution was overall similar with two 
exceptions: there were fewer percentages of subjects with events reported in the Neoplasms benign, 
malignant and unknown including cysts and polyps in the TNFi inadequate responder population, and 
there were a higher percentage of events in the Infections and Infestations SOC. 
SAEs reported in the programme showed a different trend between the 2 subpopulations with the TNFi 
inadequate responder population (A3921125 study) reporting 8 events in the 10 mg BID dose and 5 in 
the 5 mg BID dose, while in the TNFi naïve population (A3921091 study) more events were reported for 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID relative to 10 mg BID (8 versus 4).   
AE leading to discontinuation occurred in 27 subjects the TNFi inadequate responder population compared 
to 25 subjects in the TNFi naïve populations, and was more frequent in subjects receiving tofacitinib 10 
mg BID versus 5 mg BID in the TNFi inadequate responder population.  
Risk factor analysis for SIs showed an IR of 1.83 per 100 PY for TNFi experienced subjects compared to 
an IR of 1.13 per 100 PY for TNFi naïve subjects.  With regards to HZ, the IR was 2.80 per 100 PY for 
TNFi experienced subjects and 1.57 per 100 PY for TNFi naïve subjects.  With regards to OI, the IR was 
0.37 per 100 PY for TNFi experienced subjects and 0.14 per 100 PY for TNFi naïve subjects. 
Additional sub-group analyses 
The CHMP discussed whether the indication should be restricted to patients with an inadequate response 
to MTX, since only around 6% of the population of study A3921091 (csDMARD-IR) had an inadequate 
response to one csDMARD other than MTX. In addition, 1.4% had an inadequate response to >1 
csDMARD that did not include MTX. These subgroups are too small for meaningful safety analyses. 
However, the subgroup with an inadequate response to >1 csDMARD could provide supportive 
information, since this patients in this subgroup (>1 csDMARD-IR) had an inadequate response to a 
csDMARD other than MTX, and should represent a more difficult to treat population. The MAH has 
compared the efficacy and safety outcomes of the >1 csDMARD subgroup vs 1 csDMARD-IR subgroup 
(predominantly MTX-IR). Safety outcomes were comparable between the 1 csDMARD and >1 csDMARD 
subgroups of study A3921091.   
CHMP were also concerned regarding the evidence for use in combination with csDMARDs other than 
MTX. The MAH has pooled data from study A3921091 (csDMARD-IR) and A3921125 (bDMARD-IR). This 
strategy is acceptable since the studies were similar in design. Across both studies 21.8% received 
concomitant csDMARD other than MTX. Of the 52 patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID who used a non-
MTX csDMARD, 30 patients took sulfasalazine and 19 patients took leflunomide. The MAH pooled 6-month 
(Cohort 2) data across the 2 pivotal studies. Safety outcomes were comparable for the ‘MTX only’ and 
‘other csDMARD’ groups. Over 12 months, the percentage of subjects reporting SAEs was higher for the 
‘MTX only’ group compared to the ‘other csDMARD’ group. Hepatic enzyme outcomes were also 
comparable between the subgroups. 
The csDMARDs cannot be considered a single class of drug. Due to the small numbers of patients using 
individual non-MTX csDMARD at the proposed dose, it is not possible to extrapolate safety conclusions for 
the combination with MTX. Therefore, the indications is restricted to combination with MTX. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new data was submitted which was considered acceptable by CHMP.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
During the 3-month placebo-controlled period, the AEs leading to discontinuation were reported for 5 
(2.1%), 10 (4.2%), 6 (2.5%) and 2 (1.9%) subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID, tofacitinib 10 mg BID, 
placebo and adalimumab groups, respectively. AEs leading to dose reductions or interruptions were 
reported for 19 (8.0%), 33 (14.0%), 18 (7.6%) and 3 (2.8%) respectively. Most discontinuations were 
reported in the SOC of infections and infestations. Five (2.1%) of subjects receiving tofacitinib 10 mg BID 
group were discontinued due to this SOC, compared to one (0.4%) receiving tofacitinib 5 mg BID group; 
no subjects receiving placebo or adalimumab discontinued for this reason.  
For the 6-month dose comparison, discontinuations due to AE were reported for 10 (4.2%), 14 (5.9%) 
and 4 (3.8%) for the Tofacitinib 5 mg BID, Tofacitinib 10 mg BID and adalimumab groups, respectively. 
AEs leading to dose reductions or interruptions were reported for 32 (13.4%), 50 (21.2%), and 14 
(13.2%) respectively. In the Infections and Infestations SOC, there were 5 events, 4 events and one 
event leading to discontinuation in subjects receiving tofacitinib 10 mg BID, tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 
adalimumab, respectively. There were 3 events in the Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified SOC, 
in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group.  
When the All PsA cohort is considered, discontinuations due to AE were reported for 48 (10.0%) and 35 
(11.6%) for the Average Tofacitinib 5 mg BID and Average Tofacitinib 10 mg BID groups, respectively. 
The commonest SOC was Infections and Infestations SOC: 15 (3.1%) and 13 (4.3%) affected subjects in 
the Average Tofacitinib 5 mg BID and Average Tofacitinib 10 mg BID groups, respectively. The 
Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified SOC also featured: 11 (2.3%) and 2 (0.7%) affected 
subjects in the Average Tofacitinib 5 mg BID and Average Tofacitinib 10 mg BID groups, respectively. 
Post marketing experience 
Xeljanz was first approved in the US in 2012 at a dose of 5 mg BID for the treatment of RA in adults. As 
of 05/11/2016, cumulatively, there have been approximately 61,043 PY of exposure to tofacitinib from 
post-marketing experience. There have been a total of 20,074 case reports received by the MAH during 
this 4-year reporting period. The most common AEs reported in the 20,074 cases were drug ineffective 
(14.0%), headache (8.2%), condition aggravated (7.1%), arthralgia (6.5%), pain (6.2%), fatigue 
(5.9%), nausea (5.4%) and diarrhoea (5.4%). The most common SAEs reported in the 20,074 cases 
(≥1%) were RA (3.9%), condition aggravated (3.3%) and pneumonia (2.3%). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 738 PsA subjects were treated with tofacitinib 5 mg BID or 10 mg BID during the clinical 
development programme; 713 PsA subjects were exposed to ≥6 months and 635 subjects were exposed 
to ≥12 months of tofacitinib, corresponding to 1237.89 patient-years of exposure. The exposure is 
considered to be adequate.   
To supplement the relatively short exposure time and to contextualize the safety profile of tofacitinib in 
PsA, the MAH has performed comparisons with integrated safety datasets of tofacitinib in the Rheumatoid 
Arthritis and Psoriasis Development Programmes, and with safety data from the literature and from a 
Swedish biologics registry (the ARTIS database). These comparisons are of some interest as they provide 
a more comprehensive picture of tofacitinib safety profile, although there are significant differences in the 
study populations, study designs and exposures by dose that need to be considered when analysing 
results.

Overall the safety profile of tofacitinib in the PsA population does not differ significantly in terms of both 
AE types as well as AE incidence rates from what is already known in the RA indication, and no new 
safety concerns have emerged from the analysis of safety data provided in the present extension of 
indication.  
The most common AEs (up to ~ 5%) by preferred term (PT) in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group were 
nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache and diarrhoea. The frequencies are in line 
with the RA safety profile; no new safety signal is identified. Severe AEs were reported by 11.0% of the 
All PsA cohort (combined doses, including extension study data).  
Five deaths were reported up to 07/03/2017 during the PsA clinical development programme, all in 
subjects receiving tofacitinib 5 mg BID. The causes of death (i.e., CV events, malignancies and COPD) 
were consistent with what is expected in the PsA population as reported in the literature. It was 
considered that the deaths were likely to be due to causes other than study drug.  
SAEs and AEs graded as severe were few and occurred with generally similar frequency in all treatment 
groups in the first 6 months of treatment. However, the IRs per 100 PY for SAEs were lower for the 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID dose than for the 10 mg BID, both in the csDMARD-IR as well as the TNFi-IR 
patients.   
For the 12-month dose comparison cohort (including tofacitinib-exposed period for subjects that were 
initially randomised to placebo), the incidence rate for serious infection (per 100 patient year) were 1.99, 
1.53 and 1.08 for tofacitinib 5 mg BID, tofacitinib 10 mg BID and adalimumab. This suggests that the risk 
is higher for tofacitinib compared to adalimumab. For the All PsA cohort, the incidence rate for serious 
infection was 1.43 per 100 PY. The commonest serious infection was pneumonia. There was no evidence 
of an association between duration of exposure and incidence rate. Trends were observed for higher 
incidence rates for subjects with a history of diabetes, prior TNFi experience (versus the TNFi naïve 
population), and concomitant systemic corticosteroid use at baseline. The rates of serious infection 
appear lower than those observed for RA, although confidence intervals are wide. This could possibly be 
due to the larger use of corticosteroids in the RA programme. A dose response trend is evident for PsA 
and PsO but not RA.    
Tofacitinib is associated with a dose-dependent decrease in neutrophil and lymphocyte counts; the latter 
was found to be associated with an increased risk of SI or HZ for the RA database. These reductions were 
reproduced in the PsA database. The incidence rate for neutropenia was around 1.7 per 100 PY. 
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) evaluation of lymphocyte subsets in tofacitinib-treated patients 
(6-month dose comparison cohort) showed an increase in B cell (CD19+) counts and a decrease in T cell 
(CD3+, CD4+, CD8+) counts and natural killer (NK) (CD16+CD56+) counts. The largest mean % 
reduction from baseline was for NK (-9.68% in the combined tofacitinib group). Median change in 
haemoglobin (Hb) was negligible, but 11 subjects (1.4%) had confirmed Hb decreases of 3g/dL or Hb <7 
g/dL, in line with an ADR frequency of common in the current SmPC. An exposure-response analysis 
suggests that the risk of anaemia is increased with increasing exposure; this may reflect JAK2 inhibition.  
Higher IRs were observed for TNFi experienced (2.80) versus TNFi naïve subjects (1.57), and for subjects 
who were 65 years of age or older (3.52) compared to subjects in the <65 age (1.96). 
The incidence rate of herpes zoster, based on data up to Month 12, was 1.5 per 100 PY for tofacitinib 5 
mg BID. Incidence rates of HZ in PsA were higher for tofacitinib 10 mg BID than tofacitinib 5 mg BID. 
Rates appeared comparable to PsO and lower than RA. No cases of HZ were reported in adalimumab or 
placebo-treated subjects. Of the 26 cases reported for the All PsA cohort, 22 cases involved a single 
dermatome and no case was disseminated. There is no evidence of an association between duration of 
exposure and incidence rate.  A risk factor analysis was also conducted. Trends are observed for higher 
incidence rates for subjects with a history of prior TNFi experience (versus the TNFi naïve population),

age and Asian ethnicity. Information on prophylactic zoster vaccination as mitigation prior to tofacitinib 
treatment in accordance with vaccination guidelines is also included in the current SmPC. No other types 
of opportunistic infection were identified, and there were no cases of active TB, during the PsA 
programme. 
A total of 10 malignancies have been identified for the PsA programme; no lymphomas were reported. 
Observational studies of similar PsA populations treated with other therapies report incidence rates of 
around 0.35-0.50 per 100 PY. The rate for tofacitinib is higher at 0.72, and its mechanism of action 
provides some biological plausibility for causation.  However, this rate is in line with that observed for the 
tofacitinib RA program (0.75 per 100 PY). Malignancy remains an important potential risk, for which there 
are additional pharmacovigilance activities including a post-authorisation safety study in RA (A3921133). 
Effects on lipids were in line with those observed for RA. Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and HDL-
cholesterol showed a mean % increase of 8-10%, stabilising at Month 3. Mean blood pressure was 
essentially unchanged, but incidence rates of hypertension AEs were 4.81 per 100 PY for the All PsA 
cohort, in line with the ADR frequency based on the RA database. For the 12-month dose comparison 
period (cohort), there were 3 MACE events, one each for tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 10 mg BID and 
adalimumab. For All PsA, there was one additional MACE, which equates to an incidence rate of 0.24 per 
100 PY (both doses). This is in line with the incidence rate of 0.38 observed for tofacitinib in RA. A PASS 
is planned. 
Transaminase elevations were in line with the ADR frequencies as stated in the approved SmPC. There 
were 4 cases of hepatic steatosis, listed as an uncommon ADR currently. ‘Transaminase elevation and 
potential for drug-induced liver injury’ is retained as an important identified risk.’ Elevations in creatine 
kinase and creatinine were also observed, in line with the known safety profile.  
A total of 72 subjects ≥65 years received tofacitinib in the PsA programme. The proportion of subjects 
with adverse events, SAEs, severe AEs and discontinuations due to AE was generally increased for 
subjects ≥65 years compared with subjects <65 years for tofacitinib and comparators, reflecting 
increased morbidity in older subjects. Serious infections are a particular concern in this subgroup; 
appropriate warnings are included in the SmPC.  
There were 7 cases of exposure during pregnancy, but no definite evidence of teratogenicity. Tofacitinib is 
contraindicated in pregnancy.  
During the 3-month placebo-controlled period, AEs leading to discontinuation were reported for 2.1%, 
4.2%, 2.5% and 1.9% subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID, tofacitinib 10 mg BID, placebo and 
adalimumab groups, respectively. This suggests that tofacitinib was well-tolerated, particularly at the 5 
mg BID dose level. Discontinuations from tofacitinib were most commonly due to infections. Considering 
the All PsA cohort, the rate was 10.0% for subjects averaging 5 mg BID.  
Cumulative post-marketing data from 2012 to 2016 was consistent with the current SmPC table of ADRs. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The observed safety profile for the PsA population is in line with the known safety profile based on the RA 
clinical database and post-marketing experience. No new safety concerns are identified.  
Regarding section 4.8, the proposed ADR table is based on pooled datasets for RA and PsA. The MAH has 
clarified that the ADR frequencies at the time of initial MAA were calculated from long-term extension 
(LTE) studies only. The MAH has revised the ADR frequencies, based on data from LTEs and RCTs in RA 
and PsA. This has resulted in the reduction of some ADR frequencies. A concern might be that the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/197115/2018 
Page 131/150 
 
  
  
frequencies are biased by the pooling strategy, if they are lower in the PsA population. However, the MAH 
has presented the frequencies from RA (RCT + LTE) only. This demonstrates that the PsA data has no 
effect on the frequency calculations. The pooling strategy, which includes data from RCTs and LTE 
studies, although different to the methodology used at the time of initial MAA, is in line with the SmPC 
guideline, and can be accepted.  
No new safety concerns are proposed for inclusion in the RMP; this is appropriate.     
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 3.2 is acceptable.  
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 3.2 with the following content:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
PsA is a chronic progressive inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis, which may result in 
permanent joint damage and disability. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Mild PsA is generally treated with NSAIDs. When only few joints are involved, local injections of steroids 
might be effective. For more extensive or severe PsA, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) 
are recommended.  Conventional synthetic DMARDs (csCMARDs) such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine and 
leflunomide, are standard therapies. For patients in whom csDMARDs are not effective, biological DMARDs 
(bDMARDs) or targeted DMARDs are recommended by guidelines such as EULAR. These include tumour 
necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) (e.g. etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab 
pegol), bDMARDs with novel mechanisms of action such as ustekinumab (IL-12/23 antagonist) and 
secukinumab (IL-17A antagonist), and the PDE4 inhibitor apremilast.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The tofacitinib PsA development programme is based on 3 global studies, including 2 completed Phase 3 
double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety studies investigating tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg 
BID (Studies A3921125 and A3921091, also referred to as pivotal studies) and one ongoing Phase 3 
open-label, long-term extension (LTE) study (Study A3921092). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The benefit of tofacitinib on PsA has been shown both in terms of signs and symptoms of peripheral 
arthritis, measured by the ACR20 response, as well as on the decrease in physical function associated 
with the PsA disease, measured by HAQ-DI, in both csDMARD-IR and TNFi-IR patient populations. 
Study 1091 (csDMARD non-responders, TNFi naïve) 
For the co-primary endpoint of ACR20 at Month 3, the response rate for the proposed dose of tofacitinib 5 
mg BID was 50.5%, in line with the active comparator adalimumab. This represented a 17.1% increase 
over placebo, which is statistically significant and clinically relevant. The ACR20 response is maintained 
up to Month 12.  
For the co-primary endpoint of ΔHAQ-DI at Month 3, the LS mean treatment difference for tofacitinib 5 
mg BID vs placebo was -0.17. This difference was in line with that observed for adalimumab. The effects 
are maintained until Month 12. The MCID (change from baseline) for HAQ-DI is 0.35. For the 90% of 
subjects with baseline HAQ-DI ≥0.35, 53.1% of the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group reported a decrease of 
≥0.35, the minimum clinically relevant difference, compared to 30.9% for the placebo group. This 
responder analysis supports the clinical relevance of the HAQ-DI results. 
Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the results on the primary endpoints, and generally 
consistent findings were seen across subgroups. 
Secondary endpoints included the ACR50, for which a clear separation from placebo was observed, with a 
treatment difference of 28.0% for tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 33.0% for adalimumab at Month 3, and 
maintenance of the effect until Month 12. For ACR70, the respective treatment differences were 16.8% 
and 18.9%. For MDA, the respective treatment differences were 19.5% and 18.8%. Regarding the 
radiographic evaluations, the mean changes from baseline and the progressor rates were low, providing 
reassurance of a lack of deleterious effect.  In general, the secondary endpoint results were supportive of 
the primary outcomes. There was evidence of consistent benefit for health outcome measures such as 
SF36 and FACIT-F. 
Study 1125 (TNFi non-responders) 
For the co-primary endpoint of ACR20 at Month 3, the response rate for the proposed dose of tofacitinib 5 
mg BID was 49.6%, in line with study 1091. This represented a 26.0% increase over placebo, which is 
statistically significant and clinically relevant. The ACR20 response is maintained up to Month 12.  
For the co-primary endpoint of ΔHAQ-DI at Month 3, the LS mean treatment difference for tofacitinib 5 
mg BID vs placebo was -0.25. This difference was in line with that observed for study 1092. The effects 
are maintained until Month 12. For the 90% of subjects with baseline HAQ-DI ≥0.35, 50.0% of the 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID group reported a decrease of ≥0.35, the MCID, compared to 27.6% for the placebo 
group. This responder analysis supports the clinical relevance of the HAQ-DI results. 
Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the results on the primary endpoints, and generally 
consistent findings were seen across subgroups.

Secondary endpoints included the ACR50, for which a clear separation from placebo was observed, with a 
treatment difference of 15.3% for tofacitinib 5 mg BID, and maintenance of the effect until Month 12. In 
general, the secondary endpoint results were supportive of the primary outcomes. There was evidence of 
consistent benefit for health outcome measures such as SF36 and FACIT-F. 
Target population 
Around 6% of the population of study A3921091 (csDMARD-IR) had an inadequate response to one 
csDMARD other than MTX. In addition, 1.4% had an inadequate response to >1 csDMARD that did not 
include MTX. These subgroups are too small for meaningful efficacy or safety analyses. However, the 
subgroup with an inadequate response to >1 csDMARD can provide supportive information, since this 
patients in this subgroup (>1 csDMARD-IR) had an inadequate response to a csDMARD other than MTX, 
and should represent a more difficult to treat population. The MAH has compared the efficacy and safety 
outcomes of the >1 csDMARD subgroup vs 1 csDMARD-IR subgroup (predominantly MTX-IR). Regarding 
efficacy at Month 3, the >1 csDMARD subgroup appear to derive more benefit from tofacitinib but less 
benefit from adalimumab, compared to the 1 csDMARD subgroup, across most of the relevant endpoints. 
In the RA clinical efficacy dataset, ACR response rates and HAQ-DI change from baseline at Month 3 were 
comparable for ‘csDMARD-IR but not MTX-IR or bDMARD-IR’ and MTX-IR subgroups. This provides 
additional supportive evidence that patients who are csDMARD-IR but not MTX-IR would be expected to 
benefit from tofacitinib. Regarding safety, outcomes are comparable between the 1 csDMARD and >1 
csDMARD subgroups of study A3921091. Regarding the RA safety dataset, as for the efficacy comparison, 
there is no evidence of a worse safety outcomes for ‘csDMARD-IR but not MTX-IR or bDMARD-IR’ vs MTX-
IR subgroups. 
The low level of recruitment to study A3921091 of patients who failed a csDMARD other than MTX reflects 
clinical practice. Most patients will receive MTX as first-line. Patients with a contraindication or intolerance 
to MTX, and an inadequate response to an alternative csDMARD, were not studied in large numbers. It 
would be difficult to design a study to include more of these patients, given current treatment guidelines. 
It seems unlikely that this group would benefit less, or be at more risk, from tofacitinib treatment 
compared to MTX-IR patients.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
A benefit for tofacitinib 5 mg BID in terms of ACR70 response rate and MDA was not demonstrated for 
study 1125. This may reflect a more treatment resistant population, compared to study 1091. 
For disease manifestations of skin involvement, dactylitis and enthesitis, the outcomes are less convincing 
and less consistent across the two pivotal studies. This may be due in part to the inclusion of patients 
without these manifestations, and therefore reduced power to demonstrate statistically significant 
treatment effects within study.   
Only a small number of patients with predominantly axial PsA were recruited to the pivotal studies. 
Therefore, a meaningful assessment of efficacy in this sub-group is not possible. Study 1119 in AS 
patients provides some supportive evidence for the efficacy of tofacitinib 5 mg BID in predominantly axial 
PsA. 
Combination treatment 
In order to provide evidence for use in combination with csDMARDs other than MTX, the MAH has pooled 
data from study A3921091 (csDMARD-IR) and A3921125 (bDMARD-IR). This strategy is acceptable since 
the studies were similar in design. Across both studies 21.8% received concomitant csDMARD other than 
MTX. The pooled group corresponding to ‘other csDMARD’ included 52 patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
group and 43 in the placebo group. Of the 52 patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group who used a non-

MTX csDMARD, 30 patients took sulfasalazine and 19 patients took leflunomide. Although efficacy 
outcomes in the non-MTX group were generally in line with the outcomes in the MTX groups, the numbers 
were considered too small to support robust efficacy conclusions in the non-MTX group (see also section 
3.5).  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The key risks for tofacitinib are serious infections and opportunistic infections. During the first 12 months 
of treatment the incidence rate of serious infection was 2.0 per 100 PY for the 5 mg BID dose. The 
commonest serious infection was pneumonia. No fatal serious infections were reported. The incidence 
rate for herpes zoster during the first 12 months was 1.5 per 100 PY for the 5 mg BID dose. 85% of the 
cases in the tofacitinib PsA database involved one dermatome, and no cases were disseminated. No other 
types of opportunistic infection were identified, and there were no cases of active TB, during the PsA 
programme. Rates of serious infection and herpes zoster were lower than those observed for RA, 
although confidence intervals are wide. 
The commonest AEs (up to ~ 5%) by preferred term (PT) in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group were 
nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache and diarrhoea. The frequencies are in line 
with the RA safety profile; no new safety signal is identified. Discontinuation rates for tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
were 2.1% during the first 3 months, rising to 10.0% for the long-term all dose cohort. Tofacitinib 
appears to be relatively well-tolerated in PsA patients. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The number of events of HZ observed in the PsA programme was limited, and robust conclusions on risk 
factors for HZ in the PsA population is not possible at present.  
A total of 10 malignancies have been identified for the PsA programme; no lymphomas were reported. 
Observational studies of similar PsA populations treated with other therapies report incidence rates of 
around 0.35-0.50 per 100 PY. The rate for tofacitinib is higher at 0.72, and its mechanism of action 
provides some biological plausibility for causation. Malignancy remains an important potential risk, for 
which there are additional pharmacovigilance activities including a post-authorisation safety study in RA 
(A3921133). 
Combination treatment 
To provide evidence for use in combination with csDMARDs other than MTX, the MAH has pooled data 
from study A3921091 (csDMARD-IR) and A3921125 (bDMARD-IR). This strategy is acceptable since the 
studies were similar in design. Across both studies 21.8% received concomitant csDMARD other than 
MTX. The pooled group corresponding to ‘other csDMARD’ included 52 patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
group and 43 in the placebo group. Of the 52 patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group who used a non-
MTX csDMARD, 30 patients took sulfasalazine and 19 patients took leflunomide.  
Safety outcomes were comparable for the ‘MTX only’ and other csDMARD’ groups. Over 12 months, the 
percentage of subjects reporting SAEs was higher for the ‘MTX only’ group compared to the ‘other 
csDMARD’ group. Hepatic enzyme outcomes were also comparable between the subgroups. Supportive 
evidence from the RA database also suggests comparable safety outcomes irrespective of concomitant 
csDMARD. However, csDMARDs cannot be considered a single class. For individual non-MTX csDMARDs, 
the patient numbers are small. Therefore, it is not possible to extrapolate safety conclusions from the 
combination with MTX.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A clinically relevant benefit for tofacitinib in combination with MTX has been demonstrated for signs, 
symptoms, function and health outcomes in patients with active PsA who have not responded to, or are 
intolerant of, a csDMARD or TNF. Tofacitinib offers a different mode of action and safety profile, compared 
to other targeted treatments for this setting. The oral formulation may also be an advantage for some 
patients.

The risks of serious or opportunistic infections are important. However, these risks are mitigated by the 
precautions and warnings included in the SmPC, and these adverse reactions are generally manageable. 
Tofacitinib was well-tolerated. The potential risk of malignancy continues to be investigated. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefits of Xeljanz 5 mg film-coated tablets outweigh the risks, when used in combination with MTX 
for the treatment of adult acive PsA patients who have had an inadequate response or who have been 
intolerant to a DMARD. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Xeljanz is positive.

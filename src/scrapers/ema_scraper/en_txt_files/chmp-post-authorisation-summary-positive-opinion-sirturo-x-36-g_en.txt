Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Sirturo 
bedaquiline 
On 28 January 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Sirturo. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Janssen-Cilag International NV. 
The CHMP adopted a new 20 mg strength (tablet) and an extension to the existing indication as follows2: 
Sirturo is indicated for use as part of an appropriate combination regimen for pulmonary 
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adults and adolescents and paediatric patients 
(12 5 years to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 30 15 kg) when an effective 
treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of resistance or tolerability (see 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

days from adoption of the opinion

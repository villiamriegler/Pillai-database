2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Introduction
2.1.1.  Problem statement
Disease or condition
Claimed therapeutic indication:
Psoriatic arthritis
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 11/179
 
 
Tremfya, alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the treatment of active 
psoriatic arthritis in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to 
a prior disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy (see section 5.1).
Epidemiology
Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory arthropathy of the peripheral and axial joints associated with 
psoriasis. The estimated prevalence of PsA in the general population varies from 0.02% to 1.0% across 
the world; in patients with psoriasis, the prevalence of PsA ranges from 6% to 42%. PsA impacts the 
joints, bone and cartilage, periarticular tissues (dactylitis), entheses, and skin, and can result in 
functional disability and impaired quality of life. 
Biologic features
The severity of PsA can vary substantially among patients, with some patients developing destructive 
arthritis leading to bony erosion and loss of joint architecture. In long-term cohort studies of patients with 
PsA, it has been estimated that approximately 50% to 60% of patients with PsA will not exhibit structural 
damage over time.
Clinical presentation
Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory arthropathy of the peripheral and axial joints associated with 
psoriasis. The estimated prevalence of PsA in the general population varies from 0.02% to 1.0% across 
the world; in patients with psoriasis, the prevalence of PsA ranges from 6% to 42%. As a multifaceted 
disease, PsA impacts the joints, bone and cartilage (progressive structural joint damage), periarticular 
tissues (dactylitis), entheses, and skin and can result in functional disability and impaired quality of life. 
The severity of disease can vary substantially among patients, with some patients developing destructive 
arthritis leading to bony erosion and loss of joint architecture; some patients even require surgical 
intervention to alleviate pain and restore function of severely damaged joints. In long-term cohort studies 
of patients with PsA, it has been estimated that approximately 50% to 60% of patients with PsA will not 
exhibit structural damage over time.
Management
Anti-TNFα agents were the first biologic agents approved for the treatment of PsA. Ustekinumab, an 
inhibitor of IL-12/23, apremilast, an inhibitor of PDE4, secukinumab and ixekizumab, antibody directed 
against IL-17, were also recently approved for PsA. These therapies have greatly improved the 
management of patients with PsA. Unfortunately, 40% to 60% of patients treated with current therapies 
do not reach a minimal improvement in their joint disease (ie, ACR 20) based on clinical trial data. In 
addition, TNFi-exposed patients may be more resistant to treatment, as the proportion of subjects 
achieving an ACR 20 was lower for TNFi-exposed than in TNFi-naive subjects in trials of ustekinumab, 
apremilast, and secukinumab.
2.1.2.  About the product
The mechanism of action of guselkumab is inhibition of IL-23 bioactivity by binding to the p19 subunit of 
this IL. By binding to the p19 subunit of IL-23, guselkumab blocks the binding of extracellular IL-23 to 
the cell surface IL-23 receptor (IL-23R), inhibiting IL-23 mediated intracellular signaling, activation, and 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

cytokine production. 
Guselkumab (Tremfya) has been approved in the EU for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. The initial approvals were based primarily on 
the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic, and immunogenicity data from three pivotal Phase 3 studies 
(CNTO1959PSO3001, CNTO1959PSO3002, and CNTO1959PSO3003, hereinafter referred as PSO3001 
PSO3002 and PSO3003 studies respectively). 
2.1.3.  The development programme
The clinical development program for guselkumab in the treatment of adults with active PsA was designed 
in consideration of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) Guideline on Clinical 
Investigation of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of PsA (CHMP/EWP/438/04, 2006). 
The guselkumab clinical development program for PsA includes a completed Phase 2 
(CNTO1959PSA2001) and two Phase 3 (CNTO1959PSA3001 and CNTO1959PSA3002 (ongoing)) studies in 
adult subjects with PsA who had inadequate response to, or were intolerant of conventional therapy (ie, 
non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs [DMARDs], apremilast, or nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), and/or anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) therapies (PSA2001 and 
PSA3001 only). The guselkumab 100 mg SC at Weeks 0, 4, and every 8 weeks (q8w) thereafter dose 
regimen was evaluated in study PSA2001. Both the guselkumab q8w and guselkumab SC 100 mg every 4 
weeks (q4w) dose regimens were evaluated in studies PSA3001 and PSA3002.
An European Medicines Agency decision (P/0025/2019) was adopted on 22 February 2019, on the 
agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (EMEA-001523-PIP03-18) and on the granting of a deferral 
for 5-18 years old children and adolescents with active juvenile psoriatic arthritis (jPsA) and on the 
granting of a waiver for the paediatric population 0-5 years of age on the grounds that the specific 
medicinal product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit as clinical studies(s) are not 
feasible.
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
Guselkumab is a monoclonal antibody and is consequently classified as a protein. According to the 
Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), amino acids, peptides and proteins are exempted because they are unlikely 
to result in significant risk to the environment. Consequently, no Environmental Risk Assessment for 
guselkumab is required which is acceptable to the CHMP.
2.3.  Clinical aspects
2.3.1.  Introduction
Guselkumab has been marketed since 13 July 2017 and has received marketing approval for the 
treatment of adult patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in the United States (US), 
European Union (EU), and other countries worldwide. The approved dose of guselkumab for the treatment 
of plaque psoriasis is 100 mg administered subcutaneously (SC) at Week 0, Week 4, and every 8 weeks 
(q8w) thereafter. This was primarily based on 2 large, Phase 3, placebo-controlled clinical studies 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 13/179
 
 
(CNTO1959PSO3001 and CNTO1959PSO3002) in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. 
The clinical development program for guselkumab in the treatment of active PsA includes a completed 
Phase 2 global study (CNTO1959PSA2001 [hereafter referred to as PSA2001]) and two Phase 3 global 
studies (CNTO1959PSA3001 [hereafter referred to as PSA3001] and CNTO1959PSA3002 (ongoing) 
[hereafter referred to as PSA3002]). The results from the full 1-year dataset from both PsA studies is 
anticipated post authorisation. 
GCP
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics
The PK properties and immunogenicity of guselkumab have been characterized in healthy subjects and in 
subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and were presented the initial marketing application for 
the treatment of psoriasis. In this extension of indication application, information on the PK, 
pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of guselkumab is presented to support the application for 
the indication for treatment of active PsA.
Phase 2 Study in Subjects with Psoriatic Arthritis (Study PSA2001)
The study is described in detail in the efficacy part of this report (supportive 
Pharmacokinetic Summary
For subjects who received 100 mg q8w and did not qualify for EE at Week 16, trough serum guselkumab 
concentrations reached steady state by Week 20 (median: 0.94 μg/mL; mean±SD: 1.15±0.82 μg/mL) 
and were maintained through Week 44 (median: 0.89 µg/mL; mean±SD: 1.08±0.78 μg/mL). The trough 
serum guselkumab concentrations were above quantifiable levels in almost all samples from subjects. 
Only 1 subject in the guselkumab only group had a trough serum guselkumab concentration at Week 12 
that was below the lowest quantifiable concentration (<0.01 µg/mL).
In the guselkumab only group, trough serum guselkumab concentrations appeared to decrease slightly 
with increasing body weight. Concomitant use of MTX did not have an apparent impact on serum 
guselkumab concentrations.
Immunogenicity Summary
For subjects who received at least 1 administration of guselkumab and had evaluable serum samples, the 
incidence of antibodies to guselkumab was 4.7% (6 of 128 subjects) through Week 56 and the highest 
titer of antibodies to guselkumab was 1:2560. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 15/179
 
 
None of the 6 subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab were positive for NAbs to 
guselkumab. No apparent difference in mean serum guselkumab concentrations was observed between 
subjects who were positive and negative for antibodies to guselkumab; however, the number of subjects 
who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab was very small (n=5 in the guselkumab only group and 
n=1 in the placebo crossover group) which limits a definitive conclusion

Pharmacokinetic Summary
Following SC administration of guselkumab, trough serum guselkumab concentrations generally reached 
steady state by Week 20 (median: 0.95 μg/mL; mean±SD: 1.12±0.77 μg/mL) for the 100 mg q8w dose 
group and by Week 12 (median: 3.90 μg/mL; mean±SD: 4.08±1.88 μg/mL) for the 100 mg q4w dose

group. None of the subjects had trough serum guselkumab concentrations below the lowest quantifiable 
concentration (<0.01 μg/mL) through Week 24 for both guselkumab dose groups.
Median trough steady-state serum guselkumab concentrations appeared to decrease with increasing body 
weight. Median trough serum guselkumab concentrations appeared to decrease slightly with increasing 
CRP levels at baseline. Concomitant use of MTX or non-biologic DMARDs did not have an apparent impact 
on serum guselkumab concentrations. There was no apparent impact of prior anti-TNFα use on median 
serum guselkumab concentrations.

Immunogenicity Summary
The overall incidence of antibodies to guselkumab through Week 24 was low (2.0%, 5 of 254 subjects) 
and the highest titer of antibodies to guselkumab was 1:5120. Concomitant use of MTX or non-biologic 
DMARDs appeared to lower the incidence of antibodies to guselkumab. Prior anti-TNFα use did not have 
an apparent impact on the incidence of antibodies to guselkumab. However, the small number of subjects 
who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab limits a definitive conclusion.
One of the 5 subjects (20%) who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab was positive for NAbs to 
guselkumab.
Median serum guselkumab concentrations tended to be lower in subjects with positive antibodies to 
guselkumab compared with subjects negative for antibodies to guselkumab. It should be noted that the 
number of subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab was very small (n=5), which limits a 
definitive conclusion of the effect of immunogenicity on guselkumab PK.

Objectives and Study Design are described in the chapter on clinical efficacy of this report
Pharmacokinetic Summary
Following SC administration of guselkumab, trough serum guselkumab concentrations generally reached 
steady state by Week 20 (median: 1.05 μg/mL; mean±SD: 1.28±1.03 μg/mL) for the guselkumab 
100 mg q8w dose group and by Week 12 (median: 3.35 μg/mL; mean±SD: 3.70±1.92μg/mL) for the 
100 mg q4w dose group. The percentage of subjects with serum guselkumab concentrations below the 
lowest quantifiable concentration (<0.01 µg/mL) at each visit through Week 24 was very low (≤0.5% for 
the 100 mg q8w group and ≤0.4% for the 100 mg q4w group).
Median trough steady-state serum guselkumab concentrations appeared to decrease with increasing body 
weight. Median trough serum guselkumab concentrations appeared to decrease slightly with increasing 
CRP levels at baseline. Concomitant use of MTX or non-biologic DMARDs did not have an apparent impact 
on serum guselkumab concentrations.
Immunogenicity Summary
The overall incidence of antibodies to guselkumab through Week 24 was low (2.0%, 10 of 490 subjects) 
and the highest titer of antibodies to guselkumab observed was 1:640. Concomitant use of MTX or non-
biologic DMARDs appeared to lower the incidence of antibodies to guselkumab through Week 24. 
However, the small number of subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab limits a definitive 
conclusion.
None of the 10 subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab were positive for NAbs to 
guselkumab.
Median serum guselkumab concentrations tended to be lower in subjects who were positive for antibodies 
to guselkumab compared with subjects who were negative for antibodies to guselkumab. The small 
number of subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab (n=10) limits a definitive conclusion 
of the effect of immunogenicity on guselkumab PK.

The pooled data set comprised 254 subjects from PSA3001 and 492 subjects from PSA3002. A total of 
5,626 quantifiable serum guselkumab concentration-time records were included in the population PK 
analysis. Nine samples (0.16%) were below the limit of quantitation and were excluded from the 
population PK analysis.
The guselkumab concentration-time profiles in PsA subjects were adequately described by a 
1-compartment linear population PK model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination.
A stable covariate model was developed which included the covariate effects of weight, baseline albumin, 
diabetes, and WBC on CL/F and weight on V/F. Covariates with an effect size of less than 10% including 
baseline albumin and WBC were removed from the covariate model, resulting in the final population PK 
model consisting of the effects of body weight on CL/F and V/F and the effects of diabetes on CL/F.

Effects of covariates were assessed using the stable covariate model. The effect sizes for discrete covariates (less 
common category/the most common category) were the parameter estimates of the less common category relative to 
the most common category. The effect size for continuous covariates (covariate values at 75th percentile/covariate 
values at 25th percentile) were calculated as the ratio of E75/E25, where E75 and E25 were PK parameter values with 
covariate values at 75th percentile and 25th percentile of the population respectively. Blue points represent model 
predictions and black line segments are the corresponding 90% confidence intervals. The associated values are shown 
on the right column. The gray long-dash and dotted vertical lines are the 80% to 125% and the 90% to 110% 
boundaries.
Covariate effects by simulations
The model-predicted median Ctrough,ss and AUCτ of guselkumab in PsA subjects with a body weight ≥90 
kg were about 33.4% and 28.8% lower than in subjects <90 kg, respectively, at 100 mg q8w. The 
model-predicted median Ctrough,ss and AUCτ of guselkumab in PsA subjects with a body weight ≥90 kg 
were about 30.4% and 28.8% lower than in subjects <90 kg, respectively, at 100 mg q4w.
The model-predicted median Ctrough,ss and AUCτ of guselkumab in subjects with diabetic comorbidity 
were approximately 30.3% and 18.9% lower than in subjects without diabetic comorbidity, respectively, 
at 100 mg q8w. The model predicted median Ctrough,ss and AUCτ of guselkumab in subjects with 
diabetic comorbidity were approximately 22.6% and 18.9% lower than in subjects without diabetic 
comorbidity, respectively, at 100 mg q4w.

Antibodies to Guselkumab and Pharmacokinetics
In the population PK covariate analysis, the presence of antibodies and the impact of antibodies to  
guselkumab as a time-varying variable did not have an apparent effect on the CL/F of guselkumab. The 
small number of subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab (total n=15) limited to draw  
definitive conclusion of the effect of immunogenicity on guselkumab PK.  In study PSA3001 only  1 
subject was positive for antibodies to guselkumab but in study  PSA3002, in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w 
group, median serum guselkumab concentrations seems to be lower in subjects who were positive for 
antibodies to guselkumab compared with subjects who were negative. At same time, in the 100 mg q4w 
group, such difference cannot be observed. (Figure 5.3.2.5).

The mean absolute bioavailability (F) of guselkumab following a single 100 mg SC administration was 
estimated to be approximately 47.6%, 48.7%, and 54.9%, respectively, for lyophilized formulation, liquid 
formulation in PFS-U, and liquid formulation in PFS-FID.
Distribution
The population estimate for apparent volume of distribution (V/F)  is 15.5 L. This value is very close what 
was obtained in RA patients (13.5L)
Elimination
The population estimate for r apparent clearance (CL/F) is 0.596 L/day.  This value is very close to what 
was obtained in RA patients (0.516 L/day) 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies
There is no new data in this regard. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.
Special populations
Of the 746 psoriatic arthritis patients exposed to guselkumab in phase III clinical studies, a total of 38 
patients were 65 years of age or older, and no patients were 75 years of age or older. No consistent

differences were observed in the overall safety profile of guselkumab among age subgroups through 
Week 24 and the data cut (please refer to assessment of clinical safety).

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics
Mechanism of action
Guselkumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 lambda (IgG1λ) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds 
to the p19 protein subunit of human interleukin (IL)-23 with high affinity. By binding to the p19 subunit 
of IL-23, guselkumab blocks the binding of extracellular IL-23 to the cell surface IL-23 receptor (IL-23R), 
inhibiting IL-23 mediated intracellular signaling, activation, and cytokine production.
Primary and secondary pharmacology
Biomarkers
Clinical characteristics at baseline 
In PSA3001 and PSA3002, 21 serum proteins were measured from a subpopulation of 50 subjects per 
treatment group per study (n=300 subjects in total) at Weeks 0 (pretreatment), 4, and 24. Additionally, 
serum samples were evaluated from 34 healthy control subjects procured independently of these studies. 
The control subjects were selected to reflect the demographics of the PsA studies (age, sex, and 
race/ethnicity). 
At baseline, serum levels of acute phase proteins CRP, serum amyloid A (SAA), and IL-6, and Th17 
effector cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F were elevated in PsA study subjects compared with healthy control 
subjects in both studies (Figure 5.3.3.1)  There was no significant dysregulation in soluble ICAM-1, 
soluble VCAM-1, CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL22 (MDC), CCL4 (MIP-1-β), IFN-γ, IL-8, TNFα, YKL-40, or IL-22 in 
PsA subjects compared with healthy subjects. Effector cytokines associated with the IL-23/Th-17 (IL-17A, 
IL-17F, and IL-22) and inflammatory protein CCL22 were significantly correlated with baseline psoriasis 
disease activity, including BSA and PASI (Spearman Signed Rank p<0.05 and r>0.25). Acute phase 
proteins CRP, SAA, and IL-6 and inflammatory protein YKL40 were significantly associated with baseline 
joint disease as measured by DAS28 (CRP) (Spearman Signed Rank p<0.05 and r>0.25). 
The PSA3001 study included subjects previously treated with one or more biologic anti-TNF agent. This 
subpopulation of subjects had significantly higher levels of SAA, IL-6, IL-17A, and IL-17F compared with 
subjects in PSA3001 without prior exposure to anti-TNF agents (p<0.05 and geometric mean ≥40% 
higher), although these proteins were significantly up-regulated compared with the healthy control set for 
both groups. 
There was so significant difference in baseline serum biomarkers between subjects with or without 
baseline methotrexate usage (MTX)

Guselkumab effect on biomarkers
A strong pharmacodynamic effect was observed with both 100mg q4w and 100mg q8w dosing regimens 
of guselkumab (Figures 5.3.3.2). Guselkumab treatment decreased levels of acute phase proteins CRP, 
SAA and IL-6, and Th17 effector cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 within 4 weeks of initiation of 
treatment. Guselkumab treatment further reduced levels by week 24, and to a greater extent than 
observed with placebo. In guselkumab treated subjects at week 24, serum IL-17A and IL-17F levels were 
not significantly different from those observed in a demographically matched healthy cohort (Figure 
5.3.3.2).  IL-6 is only reduced to healthy levels by the guselkumab q4w dose at Week 24, though the 
trend was similar for the q8w dose as well (p=0.0405, fold difference= 1.4).

The E-R relationships between trough serum guselkumab concentration and selected efficacy endpoints 
were assessed for each individual Phase 3 PsA study. Clinical efficacy data including ACR 20 and ACR 50 
at Week 24, change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) at Week 24 and IGA response at Week 24 were used 
in the E-R analyses because these were either the primary or major secondary endpoints in both studies. 
In addition, clinical responses measured by these endpoints at Week 20 were also used in the E-R 
analyses because Week 20 matched the time of steady-state trough concentrations for both dose 
regimens. The steady-state trough serum guselkumab concentrations from both dose groups at Week 20 
were divided into 4 groups based on quartiles with approximately equal numbers of subjects in each 
group for each dose group.
ACR20 response and Trough Serum Guselkumab Concentrations
There appeared to be a weak E-R relationship for ACR 20 response rate at Week 20 by trough 
guselkumab concentration quartiles at Week 20 in PSA3001, while no apparent E-R relationship was 
observed for ACR 20 response rate at Week 20 in PSA3002. (Figures 5.3.4.1)

Only subjects with ≥3% BSA psoriatic involvement and an IGA score of ≥2 at baseline were used in this 
analysis. For the major secondary endpoint of IGA response (ie, an IGA psoriasis score of 0 [cleared] or 1 
[minimal] and ≥2-grade reduction from baseline) at Week 24 by steady-state trough guselkumab 
concentration quartiles at Week 20, an apparent E-R relationship was observed in subjects with ≥3% BSA 
psoriatic involvement and an IGA score of ≥2 at baseline in PSA3001, while no apparent E-R relationship 
for IGA response was observed in PSA3002.

Exposure-response modelling
Data from a total of 1,120 subjects in the 2 Phase 3 studies (PSA3001 and PSA3002) were included in the 
final dataset for the E-R modelling analyses. 
Method
Data from 1,120 subjects were included in the final dataset for the E-R analyses. Analyses were 
conducted using a landmark analysis approach, which used ordinal logistic regression to correlate 
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) or the Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) responses at 
Week 20 and Week 24 with guselkumab pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure metrics. These metrics included 
model-predicted cumulative area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from Week 0 to Week 24 
(AUC0-24w), model-predicted average concentration at steady state (Cavess), and observed trough 
serum concentration at Week 20 (Ctrough,wk20). The probability of achieving 20%, 50%, or 70% 
improvement in arthritis activity relative to baseline (ACR20, ACR50, or ACR70) was simultaneously 
modelled by re-parametrizing the ACR response to 1 ordered categorical variable with 4 possible 
outcomes (=0 if ACR70 achieved; =1 if ACR50 achieved, but not ACR70; =2 if ACR20 achieved, but not 
ACR50; =3 if ACR20 not achieved). The probability of achieving Investigator’s Global Assessment score of 
cleared (0) or minimal (1) (IGA0/1; IGA≤1) and Investigator’s Global Assessment score of cleared (0) 
(IGA0; IGA=0) was also simultaneously modelled by re-parametrizing the IGA response to 1 ordered 
categorical variable with 3 possible outcomes (=0 if IGA score =0; =1 if IGA score =1; =2 if IGA score 
>1). Subjects with a baseline IGA score of ≤1 were excluded from IGA analyses.
Based on graphical exploration, logistic regression models, which assumed a maximum drug effect 
(Emax) relationship between PK exposure metrics and efficacy response rates, were used for the 
landmark analysis base models. Covariate models were then developed through a standard Stepwise 
Covariate Modelling (SCM) development approach. The covariates tested included body weight [BWT], 
diabetes comorbidity status [DIAB], baseline disease characteristics (ie, baseline C-reactive protein 
[BCRP], baseline Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) [BDAS], baseline IGA score [BIGA], baseline 
Psoriasis Area and Severity
Index (PASI) score [BPAS], disease duration [DDUR]), prior anti-TNFα treatment [TNFT], and 
concomitant medications (ie, methotrexate [MTX], disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs other than 
methotrexate [DMAR2], corticosteroid [CORT], and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAD]). 
Covariate searches were performed on the intercept (clinical response in the absence of drug exposure), 
the guselkumab exposure at half maximum drug effect (EC50), and Emax. Model performance was 
evaluated by goodness-of-fit plots, generated by overlaying the observed and model-predicted 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 31/179
 
 
probabilities of achieving a given efficacy outcome.
Simulations were conducted to predict ACR20/50/70, IGA0/1, and IGA0 responses to the 2 different dose 
regimens (100 mg q8w and 100 mg q4w) using the final E-R models. The simulated results were 
stratified by the covariates in the final models, and parameter uncertainties were included in the 
simulations to produce 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the predicted responses.
Results
Logistic regression models, assuming an Emax relationship between the PK exposure metrics and efficacy 
response rates, adequately described the observed data, as indicated by goodness-of-fit plots. For the 3 
E-R models of the ACR20/50/70 responses using different exposure metrics (AUC0-24w, Cavess, and 
Ctrough,wk20), the baseline DAS28 score was identified as a covariate based on Emax, with a trend 
indicating that subjects with lower baseline DAS28 scores had higher ACR20/50/70 responses. The 
baseline PASI score was also identified as a covariate on Emax for 2 landmark models (using Cavess and 
Ctrough,wk20 as exposure metrics); subjects with higher baseline PASI scores tended to have higher 
ACR20/50/70 responses. The parameter estimates from the final E-R models for ACR20/50/70 responses 
are summarized in Table 5.3.4.1.

Final performance of the models of ACR responses were assessed via the goodness-of-fit plots displayed 
in Figures  5.4.3.5-7. Overall, these models provide an adequate fit to the observed E-R data. The wider 
90% CIs of the predicted ACR responses in the lower exposure quartiles are consistent with the relatively 
higher %RSE of EC50, which indicates a lack of efficacy data in the lower exposure range.

general, reasonably estimated. Overall, the modeling results for IGA 0/1 and IGA 0 at Week 24, including 
the covariates effects identified, were consistent between the 2 exposure metrics (ie, model-predicted

Exposure-response Analysis for Safety
The proportions of subjects who had AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent, infections 
and serious infections through Week 24 were evaluated with respect to observed steady-state trough 
serum guselkumab concentration quartiles for each dose group using pooled data from PSA3001 and 
PSA3002. The steady-state trough serum guselkumab concentrations at Week 20/24 were divided into 4 
groups with approximately equal numbers of subjects in each group based on quartiles for each dose 
group.
For both dose groups, no apparent relationships were observed between the incidence of AEs, SAEs, AEs 
leading to discontinuation of study agent, infections and serious infections through Week 24 and quartiles 
of trough steady-state serum guselkumab concentrations at Week 20 (100 mg q8w) or Week 24 (100 mg 
q4w). In addition, no apparent differences in the incidence of these safety parameters of interest between 
the 2 dose groups were observed.

Overall, the incidence of these safety parameters of interest were not associated with steady-state trough 
serum guselkumab concentrations.
To further explore the relationships between guselkumab PK exposure and safety, incidence of safety 
parameters of interest (ie, AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent, infections, and 
serious infections) through Week 24 were evaluated with respect to model-predicted exposure 
parameters (ie, Cmax, Cave,ss, and AUC0-24w) by dose group using the pooled data from the Phase 3 
studies (PSA3001 and PSA3002). All PK exposure parameters were derived from the final population PK 
model using individual post hoc PK parameter estimates and the actual administration information for 
each individual subject.
For both dose groups, no apparent relationships were observed between the incidence of AEs, SAEs, AEs

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
Guselkumab displays PK properties typical of a human IgG1-type immunoglobulin interacting with a 
soluble target, i.e. a low clearance and a low total volume of distribution. Therefore, it was not expected 
that guselkumab kinetics in PsA patients would be different from PsO patients. Indeed across the Phase 3 
PsA studies (ie, the pooled data set), the median steady state trough serum guselkumab concentrations 
were 1.01 µg/mL (mean±SD: 1.18±0.87 µg/mL) in the 100 mg q8w group and 3.50 µg/mL (mean±SD: 
3.83±1.92 µg/mL) in the 100 mg q4w group.  These values are very close to the trough concentration 
values reported in the PsO Phase III studies.  Similarly, in both patient groups trough serum guselkumab 
concentrations reached steady state by Week 20 for the 100 mg q8w group and by Week 12 for the 100 
mg q4w group. Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that concomitant use of NSAIDs, oral 
corticosteroids and csDMARDs such as methotrexate, did not affect the clearance of guselkumab.
Not only the observed concentrations but also the POP-PK parameter estimates are essentially the same. 
The methods used for the development and evaluation of the population PK model were appropriate and 
the model diagnostics indicated that the model describes the data adequately. All parameters were 
estimated with good precision (RSE<17%). The eta-shrinkages for CL/F and V/F was relatively low 
(<15%). The eta-shrinkage for Ka was relatively large. This is not pursued since maintaining adequate 
exposure levels (eg. trough or AUC) is mainly driven by CL/F. The VPCs show that the predictive ability of 
the model is adequate. 
The typical population estimates for apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) 
were 0.596 L/day and 15.5 L, respectively, with a median body weight of 84 kg. The model-derived 
elimination half-life was approximately 18.1 days.  The corresponding values in PsO patients were 0.516 
L/day, 13.5 L and 18.1 days which again demonstrates close similarity. 
Body weight and diabetic comorbidity were identified as significant covariates on guselkumab PK. 
Exposures (trough and AUC) were around 30% lower in PsA subjects with a body weight ≥90 kg than in 
subjects <90 kg. Exposures in subjects with diabetic comorbidity were around 20-30% lower than in 
subjects without diabetic comorbidity.
In this analysis, body weights of subjects ranged from 46.0 to 203 kg. The MAH showed that despite 
differences in PK exposure in different body weight subgroups, the efficacy and safety were generally 
comparable between the two dose regimens.  Also, in subjects with diabetic comorbidity and body weight 
>100 kg, simulated exposure metrics were lower versus subjects without diabetic comorbidity and body 
weight <100 kg. However, subgroup analyses showed comparable efficacy between the 2 dose regimens 
in subjects with diabetic comorbidity and high body weight (>100 kg). Therefore, the CHMP agreed that 
body weight-based dose adjustment is not needed.
No specific studies have been conducted in elderly patients. Of the 1384 plaque psoriasis patients 
exposed to guselkumab in phase III clinical studies and included in the population pharmacokinetic 
analysis, 70 patients were 65 years of age or older, including 4 patients who were 75 years of age or 
older. Of the 746 psoriatic arthritis patients exposed to guselkumab in phase III clinical studies, a total of 
38 patients were 65 years of age or older, and no patients were 75 years of age or older. Accordingly 4.2 
of the SmPC outlines that there is limited information in subjects aged ≥ 65 years and very limited 
information in subjects aged ≥ 75 years.

Population pharmacokinetic analyses in plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients indicated no 
apparent changes in CL/F estimate in patients ≥ 65 years of age compared to patients < 65 years of age, 
suggesting no dose adjustment is needed for elderly patients. 
Prior exposure to anti-TNFα agents did not have an apparent impact on the incidence of antibodies to 
guselkumab and the overall incidence of antibodies to guselkumab through Week 24 was low in subjects 
with PsA (2.0%, 15 of 744 subjects).  This value is comparable to PsO patients (5.4%) considering later 
value represent a pooled estimate from the Phase 2 dose-ranging study (PSO2001 through Week 40) and 
2 Phase 3 studies (PSO3001 through Week 44 and PSO3002 through Week 48). The longer duration 
justifies the higher antibody incidence rates. Concomitant use of methotrexate (MTX), non-biologic 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), corticosteroids, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs did not have an apparent impact on the CL/F of guselkumab. However, the incidence of antibodies 
to guselkumab appeared to be lower in subjects with concomitant use of MTX (1.4%) or non-biologic 
DMARDs (1.6%) compared to subjects without concomitant use of MTX (2.8%) or non-biologic DMARDs 
(2.9%).  The SmPC currently reports the 24 weeks immunogenicity results of the two-Phase III studies.  
It was agreed that SmPC should be updated with the final immunogenicity results when both studies are 
finalized. The final study report for PSA3001 is planned to be submitted by December 2021 as outlined in 
the RMP.
While from a PK perspective there is no difference between PsA and PsO patients, the two patient 
populations can be different regarding the needed skill to self-administer the product.   In the Type II 
variation II/0002/G the MAH introduced a new delivery device called SelfDoseTM while in the three PsA 
trials an injection device called UltraSafe PLUS™ was used. The CHMP accepted then that there is no 
difference between the two devices in PsO patients, including the potential for self-administration. The 
MAH also clarified that a Summative Human Factors Study (HFS) already has been conducted  with  the 
SelfDose  (PFS-S) device in PsA patients.   This study included hand impaired patients and psoriatic 
patients. In this study all participants (45/45, 100%) stated that they had no difficulty using the 
SelfDoseTM device.  Therefore, the CHMP agreed that the use of the PFS-S device in the clinical studies 
supporting the PsA indication was not required. 
The pattern of changes in the biomarker levels is consistent with the presumed mode of action of 
guselkumab. In the combined biomarker study population subset, a strong pharmacodynamic effect was 
observed with both 100mg q4w and 100mg q8w dosing regimens of guselkumab. Guselkumab resulted in 
decreases in serum CRP, SAA, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22 as early as Week 4, while no significant 
change was observed in the placebo arms at Week 4. Expression of these proteins continued to decrease 
further by Week 24 (p<0.05 and geometric mean decrease from baseline ≥ 33%) in guselkumab treated 
subjects on either dosing regimen. These results are reflected in 5.1 of the SmPC. Further, week 24, IL-
17A and IL-17F expression was no longer significantly different for subjects treated with either dose of 
guselkumab suggesting a normalization of peripheral effector cytokines associated with the IL-23/Th17 
axis following treatment with guselkumab.  There was no significant treatment-specific Week 24 ACR20 or 
IGA response association with change from baseline in serum proteins. Therefore, the PD effect on 
biomarkers is unquestionable but this effect does not seem directly related to clinical PsA specific clinical 
response (ACR20, IGA) except that IL-17F levels were reduced to a greater extent in PASI75 responders 
compared to PASI75 non-responders, indicating a response specific association. No difference can be 
seen between the q4w and q8w regimens’ PD effects. A plausible hypothesis that the PD effects in both 
cases are maximal, on the plateau. The mechanistic explanation of this plateau effect is missing. To 
better understand of this missing link, investigating the guselkumab /IL23 plasma concentration ratio 
following the 100 mg q8w dose regimen and the 100 mg q4w dose regimens was suggested. However, 
this suggestion could not be followed due to the inability of the assay to detect free IL-23 versus that 
which is guselkumab-bound. This issue was not further pursued by the CHMP.

Ordered logistic regression (also called the logit model or cumulative link model) was used to model the 
relationship between the ordered ACR20/50/70 responses and the PK metrics such as the observed 
Ctrough and the population PK model-predicted AUC0-24w and Cavess.  Similar analysis was conducted 
for IGA0/1, and IGA0 responses at Week 24 using pooled data from Studies PSA3001 and PSA3002. 
Logistic regression models, assuming an Emax relationship between the PK exposure metrics and efficacy 
response rates, adequately described the observed data, as indicated by goodness-of-fit plots. 
ACR20/50/70 responses using different exposure metrics (AUC0-24w, Cavess, and Ctrough) the baseline 
DAS28 score was identified as a covariate based on Emax, with a trend indicating that subjects with lower 
baseline DAS28 scores had higher ACR20/50/70 responses. The DAS28 effect is quite remarkable 
particularly if ACR response is corrected with the placebo response. For ACR20 the corresponding values 
are 29.9% and 21.7% in the q8w group and 35.0% and 26% in q4w group. Thus, the placebo corrected 
response rates are 27% and 25% lower in the high DAS28 (>5.1) patient group compared the low DAS28 
group (<5.1).  The MAH conducted additional simulations which showed that the ACR20 difference 
between the low and high BDAS groups is about 5%-6%. These data indicate that the effect of 
guselkumab is additive rather than multiplicative. Therefore, at lower disease activity (lower BDAS) the 
effect on relative metrics such as ACR20 is higher. This seems to be a class effect shown by other anti-
PSA biologicals .  
The E-R models also predict that dose regimen of 100 mg q4w would result in minor increases in IGA0/1 
and IGA0 responses compared to 100 mg q8w. For the overall population, the E-R models predict that the 
differences between the 2 dose regimens are less than 4% for IGA0/1 response and approximately 4% to 
8% for IGA0 response. Similar magnitudes of differences were predicted between the 2 dose regimens for 
the baseline PASI subgroups: less than 5% for IGA0/1 response and approximately 4% to 9% for IGA0 
response. Overall, model-predicted differences between the 100 mg q8w and 100 mg q4w dose regimens 
were less than 5% to achieve IGA0/1, and 4% to 9% to achieve IGA0. These results indicate that 100 mg 
q4w only have a small incremental benefit on achieving IGA0 response compared to 100 mg q8w. It is 
however acknowledged that in the overall PsA study population, the effect of q4w maintenance dose on 
inhibition of radiographic progression was higher (and significant) than with q8w maintenance dose (non 
significant) at week 24. This supports an incremental benefit of the guselkumab q4w maintenance dose 
regimen on inhibition of structural damage compared to the q8w regimen for patients at high risk for joint 
damage according to clinical judgement. It is agreed that in some patients’ a deeper suppression of the 
disease activity is needed as well as a need to be controlled as soon as possible, which would not be 
sufficient with Q8W regimen. While there are potential risks associated with the q4w regimen, these can 
be managed by frequent liver monitoring. (See discussions on efficacy and safety).
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
The MAH adequately characterized the PK of guselkumab using sample collected in 1 Phase II and 2 
Phase III trials. Descriptive and POP-PK analysis did not reveal difference from the previous results in PsO 
patients. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy
The 3 PsA studies included a target population of adult subjects diagnosed with active PsA and who met 
ClASsification criteria for Psoriatic ARthritis (CASPAR) at screening (Taylor et al, 2006). 
Subjects with prior exposure to anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) agents were allowed in 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 40/179
 
 
studies PSA2001 (1 anti-TNFα agent limited to 20% of the study population) and PSA3001 (up to 2 
anti-TNFα agents and limited to approximately 30% of the study population). 
Subjects in study PSA3002 were required to be biologic-naïve in order to enrol a population with 
higher disease burden and to increase the power for detection of a treatment effect for guselkumab on 
the radiographic endpoints.
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies)
No specific dose-response studies were performed.
Two different posologies were proposed: 1. guselkumab 100 mg at Weeks 0 and 4 then every 8 Weeks; 
2. 100 mg Every 4 Weeks
Rationale for Guselkumab 100 mg at Weeks 0 and 4 then Every 8 Weeks Dose Regimen

This dose regimen was evaluated in the Phase 2 PsA study (CNTO1959PSA2001) and in the 2 
global Phase 3 studies in psoriasis. In the CNTO1959PSA2001 study, clinically meaningful 
improvement was observed with this dose regimen in all important domains of PsA in patients 
with active PsA and ≥3% BSA of psoriasis. Additionally, significant benefit was also observed with 
this dose regimen on plaque psoriasis in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis in the Phase 
3 psoriasis studies.

An additional dose was included at Week 4 to ensure that trough guselkumab levels do not fall 
below those obtained at steady-state levels. This additional Week 4 dose results in a slightly 
higher Cmax and Ctrough in the first 12 weeks than those at steady state (~21% and ~18%, 
respectively) and may result in a more rapid onset of response. 

The safety of this dose regimen has been established in a large psoriasis development program as 
well as in PsA and RA Phase 2 studies.
Rationale for Guselkumab 100 mg Every 4 Weeks Dose Regimen


A dose regimen of 100 mg q4w was included to determine if more frequent dosing may achieve 
higher efficacy in PsA.
In the overall PsA study population, the effect of q4w dose on inhibiton of radiographic 
progression was higher (and significant) than with q8w dose (non significant) at week 24. some 
patients’ a deeper suppression of the disease activity is needed as well as a need to be controlled 
as soon as possible, which would not be sufficient with Q8W regimen.
 Modeling analyses based on data from CNTO1959PSA2001 suggested that a higher or more 
frequent dose regimen may achieve better efficacy in PsA.

Literature data (Husted et al, 1998) suggested that patients who have had inadequate response 
to anti-TNFα or other biologic treatments may benefit from a higher dose.
However, subgroup analysis of prior TNF-alfa I use in studies PSA2001 and PSA3001 showed no impact of 
prior TNF alfa use on the efficacy of guselkumab. This finding also should be handled with caution, since 
there was only a few (much less than the prespecified limit) patients with prior TNF-alfa experience. 
Guselkumab has been shown to have an acceptable safety profile in multiple patient populations, 
including with a higher dose regimen that was studied in a Phase 2 RA study (200 mg q8w).

Objectives
Primary Objective
To evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of guselkumab in subjects with active psoriatic arthritis 
(PsA) 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 44/179
 
 
Secondary Objectives
The secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of guselkumab in improving physical function and 
quality of life and on psoriatic skin lesions as well as to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), 
pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of guselkumab in subjects with active PsA. In 
PSA3002 study the evaluation of the effect of guselkumab on progression of structural damage was also 
a secondary objective.
Outcomes/endpoints
Primary endpoint
The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of subjects who achieve an ACR 20 response at 
Week 24.
Major Secondary Endpoints
Major secondary endpoints were the change from baseline in the HAQ-DI score at Week 24, ACR20 
response rate at Week 16, ACR50 response rate at Week 24, percent improvement in dactylitis scores at 
Week 24 among subjects with dactylitis, enthesitis scores (LEI) at Week 24 among subjects with 
enthesitis at baseline, DAS28(CRP) -related endpoints, PASI75 response rate at Week 24 and modified 
van der Heijde Sharp (vdH-S) score for PSA3002 only.
Further measures of PsA disease activity included:ACR components, proportion of patients with Minimal 
Disease Activity (MDA) and Very Low Disease Activity (VLDA), Psoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity Score 
(PASDAS), Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) Composite 
Score (GRACE), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) , Disease Activity Index for 
Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA), Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 Scores (RAPID 3), Assessment of 
Skin Disease Activity included Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity, HAQ-DI, dactylitis and 
ethesitis assessment (resolution of dactylitis/enthesitis, dactylitis score, LEI enthesitis score), 36-item 
Short Form Health survey (SF-36), PASI and IGA scores, and Modified Composite Psoriatic Disease 
Activity Index (mCPDAI, PSA3002 only), EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D)(PSA3002 only).
Pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity evaluations
Venous blood samples were collected for the determination of serum guselkumab concentrations and 
detection of antibodies to guselkumab or antibodies to ustekinumab.
Sample size
Study PSA3001
In order to ensure a statistical power of >90% at the significance level of 0.05 (2-sided), assuming that 
each of guselkumab 100 mg groups achieves an ACR 20 response of 40% compared with the placebo 
group response of 20% at Week 24, a total of 360 subjects were planned to be randomized in a 1:1:1 
ratio to each of treatment groups.
Study PSA3002
Assuming a 45% ACR 20 response rate (primary endpoint) in the guselkumab group and a 25% ACR 
20 response rate in the placebo group, a sample size of 228 subjects per treatment group (684 in total) 
would provide a power of approximately 99% to detect a significant treatment difference at a 2-sided 
significance level of 0.05.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 45/179
 
 
Assuming an overall mean change of 0.9 from baseline in vdH-S score (major secondary endpoint) in 
the placebo group, and an overall mean change of 0.3 in the guselkumab group, and a standard deviation 
(SD) of 2.5 for each treatment group, a sample size of 228 subjects per treatment group (684 in total) 
would provide a power of approximately 90% to detect a significant treatment difference at a 2-sided 
significance level of 0.05.
Randomisation
Central randomization was implemented in the Phase-3 studies. At Week 0, subjects were randomly 
assigned (1:1:1) to 1 of 3 treatment groups (guselkumab 100 mg q4w, guselkumab 100 mg at Weeks 0 
and 4 then q8w, or placebo) based on a permuted block randomization method.
Stratification factors were baseline non-biologic DMARD use (yes, no), prior exposure to anti-TNFα agents 
(yes, no, PSA3001 only) and the most recently available CRP value prior to randomization (<2.0 mg/dL 
versus ≥2.0 mg/dL; PSA3002 only). 
Blinding (masking)
Blinding procedures were identical for both Phase-3 studies. Through week 24, the studies were double-
blind. At week 24, the data was unblinded for analysis while subjects were still participating in the study. 
Identification of sponsor personnel who had access to the unblinded subject level data was documented 
prior to unblinding.
Statistical methods
In general, descriptive statistics, such as mean, standard deviation, median, IQ range, minimum, and 
maximum for continuous variables, and counts and percentages for discrete variables were used to 
summarize most data. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieve an ACR 20 
response at Week 24.
Estimands
Composite Strategy
The composite strategy assessed the treatment effect not only based on the variable measurements, but 
also based on intercurrent events defined as a treatment failure from the earliest date that the subject 
met any of the following treatment failure criteria onward through Week 24:
Discontinued study agent injections due to any reason.
Terminated study participation due to any reason.
Initiated or increased the dose of non-biologic DMARD (MTX, SSZ, HCQ, LEF) or oral 
corticosteroids over baseline for PsA.
Initiated protocol-prohibited medications/therapies for PsA.
If a subject met any of the treatment failure criteria, the subject was considered a non-responder for 
response variables and had a score of no improvement (ie, no change from baseline) for continuous 
variables from the time the subject met any treatment failure criteria. This estimand acknowledged that 
meeting the treatment failure criteria was an unfavorable outcome.
The composite estimand was the main estimand analyzed for all efficacy endpoints through Week 24 
except for endpoints related to joint structural damage.
Treatment policy estimand
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 46/179
 
 
The treatment policy strategy was to use all observed data collected for the endpoint, regardless of 
whether or not the subject had met any treatment failure criterion. The treatment policy estimand was 
analyzed as a supplementary estimand for all primary and major secondary endpoints and selected 
endpoints analyzed at Week 16. The treatment policy estimand was the main estimand analyzed for 
endpoints related to joint structural damage.
Binary Response Efficacy Endpoints
For binary response efficacy endpoints, treatment comparisons were generally performed using a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by the randomization stratification factors. The magnitude 
of the treatment difference was estimated by the difference in response rates between the 
guselkumab and placebo groups with a 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated based on Wald statistics. 
In these analyses, subjects with missing data were imputed as not achieving the response unless 
otherwise specified. The Mantel Fleiss criterion was used to determine the appropriateness of using the 
CMH test at each visit for each treatment pair under comparison. In the event that the Mantel Fleiss 
criterion was not satisfied, Fisher’s exact test was used instead of the CMH test to compare the two 
treatment groups. 
Various sensitivity and supplemental analyses for the primary endpoint were performed. These evaluated 
the robustness of the endpoint and the impact of treatment failure criteria and missing data, and the 
effect of major protocol deviations that could have impacted efficacy assessment per clinical judgement.
Continuous Endpoints
For the major secondary continuous endpoints (HAQ-DI score, DAS28 [CRP], enthesitis score, dactylitis 
score, SF-36 PCS score, SF-36 MCS score, and change from baseline in modified vdH S score [PSAO3002 
only]) and related continuous efficacy endpoints, treatment comparisons were performed using an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model based on multiple imputation (MI) data under the assumption 
that missing data was missing at random (MAR). The ANCOVA model included treatment group, baseline 
score and randomization stratification factors as the explanatory factors. 
For all other continuous efficacy endpoints, treatment comparisons were performed using a Mixed Effect 
Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) model. Missing data were not imputed. For the endpoints of resolution 
of dactylitis and resolution of enthesitis, the analysis was stratified by the combination of study and 
randomization stratification factors, including treatment group. The endpoints of the change from baseline 
in dactylitis and change from baseline in enthesitis scores were also tested using a combination of study 
and randomization stratification factors as covariates in the ANCOVA model.
Hypothesis testing and Multiplicity Adjustment
The overall type I error of treatment comparison for the primary endpoint, ACR 20 at Week 24, of both 
guselkumab doses compared with placebo was controlled at a significance level of ≤ 0.05 using a fixed 
sequence procedure in the order of: 
1. guselkumab 100 mg q4w group versus placebo. 
2. guselkumab 100 mg q8w group versus placebo. 
If the primary endpoint was significant for a guselkumab dose regimen, the overall Type I error of 
treatment comparison for selected major secondary endpoints was controlled at a significance level of ≤ 
0.05 using a graphical multiplicity control procedure for that dose. Statistical significance was only to be 
claimed for multiplicity-controlled endpoints. 
For all endpoints specified in the multiplicity control procedure that do not achieve statistical significance, 
both adjusted and nominal (unadjusted) p-values are provided. In this case, the nominal (unadjusted) p-
value will be interpreted as supportive. For endpoints not included in the multiplicity control procedure, or

those that were not formally tested due to the fact that a prior endpoint did not achieve statistical 
significance, numerical results and nominal (unadjusted) p values are presented.
Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint (ACR 20 response at Week 24) was analyzed at the Week 24 DBL based on the 
composite estimand in the full analysis set 1 (FAS1) which included all randomized subjects who received 
at least 1 dose (complete or partial) of study agent according to randomized treatment group, regardless 
of the treatment actually received. Subjects who met any treatment failure criteria prior to Week 24 were 
considered non-responders at Week 24, regardless of the observed ACR 20 response status. Missing data 
were imputed as non-responders at Week 24.The treatment difference between each guselkumab group 
versus the placebo group was tested using a CMH test stratified by baseline use of non-biologic DMARD 
(yes, no) and most recent CRP value prior to randomization (<2.0 mg/dL, ≥2.0 mg/dL). The magnitude 
of the treatment difference was estimated by the difference in ACR 20 response rates between the 
guselkumab and placebo groups with a 95% CI calculated based on Wald statistics.
Major Secondary Endpoints
All the major secondary endpoints were analyzed at the Week 24 DBL according to the randomized 
treatment groups. Data from all subjects in FAS1 were included with the following exceptions where 
endpoints were only meaningful in a subpopulation of subjects with baseline diseases:
• the analysis of the psoriasis response of IGA was based on FAS1 among the subjects with a ≥3% BSA 
psoriatic involvement and an IGA score of ≥2 (mild) at baseline.
• the analysis of change from baseline in enthesitis score and resolution of enthesitis was based on FAS1 
among the subjects who had at least one tender enthesis among the 6 sites included in the LEI at 
baseline based on data pooled from studies CNTO1959PSA3001 and CNTO1959PSA3002.
• the analysis of change from baseline in dactylitis score and resolution of dactylitis was based on FAS1 
among the subjects with dactylitis at baseline based on data pooled from studies CNTO1959PSA3001 and 
CNTO1959PSA3002.
Sensitivity and Supplementary Analyses
To test the robustness of the primary endpoint analysis, the following sensitivity and supplementary 
analyses were performed.
1. To evaluate the robustness of the composite estimand regarding the assumption of all missing data as 
non-responder, sensitivity analyses with the exhaustive scenario tipping point analyses were performed. 
The analysis was conducted for an ‘exhaustive approach’ testing all combinations of missing data 
imputation as responder and non-responders.
2.To evaluate the impact of treatment failure and missing data handling rules, the treatment policy 
estimand was evaluated as a supplementary analysis. In this analysis, the observed ACR 20 response for 
all subjects was used regardless of whether or not treatment failure criteria were met prior to Week 24, 
and the missing ACR 20 response for all subjects was imputed by MI method under the assumption that 
data are MAR.
3. Two-dimensional tipping point analyses based on MI imputed data were included for the treatment 
policy estimand to assess the robustness for treatment policy estimand regarding the assumption that 
data are MAR.
4. The alternative composite estimand was also evaluated as a supplemental analysis. The alternative 
composite strategy is similar to the composite strategy however, discontinuation of study agent due to 
reasons other than lack of efficacy (including adverse events caused by worsening of PsA) were not

Page 48/179
 
 
considered treatment failures. Subjects with missing data were considered non-responders. The same 
analysis method that was used for the primary analysis was applied.
5. A supplemental analysis based on the per-protocol strategy estimand was also performed. In this 
analysis, ACR response status was determined based on the last assessment up to Week 24 while 
subjects were on randomized treatment or the last non-missing assessment prior to meeting treatment 
failure criteria. This analysis used the per-protocol analysis set which included all subjects in FAS1 who 
met all inclusion and exclusion criteria and had no major protocol deviations that could have impacted 
efficacy assessment per clinical judgement.
Subgroup Analyses
Subgroup analyses were performed using a logistic regression model to evaluate treatment consistency in 
proportion of subjects who achieved an ACR 20 response at Week 24 over baseline demographics, 
baseline disease characteristics, and prior and baseline medication use. A forest plot was produced for all 
subgroups listed in Section 2.4 of the SAP. Odds ratios and the corresponding 95% CIs were also 
provided for each of the subgroups. In addition, the p-values for interaction of the treatment groups and 
the subgroups were provided when a subgroup had at least 2 categories.
Missing values 
For all efficacy endpoints through Week 24, except for endpoints related to structural damage, subjects 
who met any treatment failure criteria prior to a visit were considered nonresponders (composite 
estimand) from that point forward. For the endpoints related to progression of structural damage in study 
PSA3002, all observed data collected for an endpoint were used regardless of treatment failure status 
(treatment policy strategy). The treatment policy estimand was used for radiographic endpoints because 
radiographic progression is generally a slow process and treatment discontinuation or changes in baseline 
medications are not anticipated to have an impact on this endpoint within the 24-week study period. The 
treatment policy estimand was also used for all non-radiographic major secondary endpoints as 
supplementary analyses to evaluate the robustness of the results with respect to the handling of 
treatment failure.
Subjects with missing data at Week 24 were imputed as non-responders. Sensitivity and supplementary 
analyses of the primary endpoint were performed to examine the robustness of the primary analysis 
results. Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate consistency of treatment effect in ACR 20 
response at Week 24 over baseline demographics, baseline disease characteristics, and prior and baseline 
medication use. All of the major secondary and other secondary binary endpoints were analyzed similarly 
to the primary endpoint based on the composite estimand. All endpoints were descriptively summarized 
by treatment groups. Treatment comparisons were performed by visit through Week 24. Nominal p-
values and 95% CIs for the difference between each guselkumab group and placebo group were 
provided. For secondary continuous endpoints of change from baseline in HAQ-DI, DAS28 (CRP), 
dactylitis, enthesitis, SF-36 PCS, and SF-36 MCS, treatment comparisons were performed using an 
ANCOVA model based on multiple imputation (MI) data. The MI method was applied to impute the 
missing value(s) under the assumption of missing at random (MAR). For all other continuous efficacy 
endpoints, treatment comparisons were performed using a Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measures 
(MMRM) model.
Pooled efficacy data
The appropriateness of pooling data from the 2 Phase 3 studies PSA3001 and PSA3002, was thought to 
be supported by their similar study populations , similar study designs including the same dosing 
regimens, the same length of placebo-controlled DB period and the same EE timing and criteria, and 
contemporaneous conduct. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 49/179
 
 
There were two differences in the inclusion/excusion criteria: 1. CRP and joint count requirements were 
higher in PSA3002 than in PSA3001; 2. PSA3002 enrolled Biological DMARD-naive subjects only, whereas 
in PSA3001, TNF-alfa inhibitor-experienced patients were also included in a prespecified proportion. 
Post-hoc analysis
Results for the analysis of the change from baseline in modified vdH-S score at Week 24 in study 
PSA3002 led to a series of additional analyses to determine which clinical disease characteristics are 
predictive variables that may identify subjects at risk of structural damage progression who might 
differentially benefit from the guselkumab 100 mg q4w dose regimen. Classification and regression tree 
(CART) analyses applied to historical placebo data were used to evaluate clinical disease characteristics in 
subjects with PsA to identify a subpopulation of subjects who are at high risk of structural damage 
progression. The analyses were performed using clinical data from placebo-treated subjects from previous 
clinical studies conducted by the Applicant in subjects with active PsA. The following clinical studies were 
included: C0168T50 (REMICADE®), C0524T08 (SIMPONI®), CNTO148PSA3001 (SIMPONI ARIA®,), 
CNTO1275PSA3001 (STELARA®), and CNTO1275PSA3002 (STELARA®). A total of 746 subjects who 
received placebo were included in this analysis. The dependent variable was based on the change from 
baseline in the modified vdH-S score (>0 or ≤0) at Week 24. An initial set of eight predictive variables 
were used: baseline values for CRP, dactylitis count, enthesitis (yes/no), PsA subtype, PsA duration, 
number of joints with erosion, number of joints with joint space narrowing, and number of swollen joints 
(based on 28 joints). These variables were chosen based on literature which suggests that subjects with 
worse disease characteristics are more likely to have greater radiographic progression.
Two CART analyses were completed, the first with the inclusion of baseline radiographic factors and a 
second without those factors. Specifically, the first analysis included radiographic data (ie, number of 
joints with erosion and number of joints with JSN) at baseline as predictive variables and the second was 
completed without these two variables. These analyses were done to reflect that in practice, radiographic 
information is not always available at baseline for all patients. The RPART package in R was to be used to 
conduct the CART analyses.

Additionally, due to a programming error on the SitePad for the LEI score, the medial epicondyle humerus 
enthesis was included instead of the medial femoral condyle enthesis. This affected data for 10 
randomized subjects prior to correction. 
Resolution status at Week 24 was assessable for those subjects who had enthesitis in at least one of the 
4 assessed sites at baseline, otherwise the resolution status was set to missing. Only 2 of the 10 subjects 
had missing post-baseline data for enthesitis due to the error and their enthesitis resolution status at 
Week 24 could not be assessed.
Deviation Impact Summary for PSA 3001 and PSA3002 studies
On the identification of the deviations, assessment of subject safety and whether or not it was clinically 
appropriate for the subject to remain in the study was carried out. The majority of subjects reported to 
have deviations to study entry criteria were generally detected during monitoring and based upon the 
safety evaluation all were allowed to continue in the study. Subjects with deviations related to 
concomitant medications were further evaluated to determine if they were treatment failures for the 
primary and major secondary analyses. In Study PSA3001, no subjects were required to be 
discontinued due to deviations related to safety, while in Study PSA3002, subjects with deviations 
related to safety and who remained under treatment when the deviation was identified were 
discontinued.

In summary, the deviations noted were managed to protect subject safety and overall, these deviations 
did not impact the integrity of the study. The MPDs were considered not to have impacted the overall 
study results.

Among the subjects with spondylitis, median BASDAI were 5.9 in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, 5.7 
in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, and 6.8 in the placebo group.
Baseline BSA and PASI measurements suggested the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group had more severe 
psoriasis compared to the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group and the placebo group. In addition, the 
proportion of subjects with IGA ≥2 (mild to severe) was higher in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group 
(85.9%) compared to the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group (78.7%) and placebo (73.0%). Scalp and nail 
psoriasis occurred more frequently at baseline in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w and 100 mg q8w groups 
(79.2% and 71.0%, respectively) compared with the placebo group (67.5% and 59.5%, respectively), 
while the frequencies of hand/foot psoriasis were comparable between the combined guselkumab group 
and the placebo group. Baseline nail and hand/foot psoriasis occurred more frequently in the guselkumab 
100 mg q8w group (74.8% and 47.2%, respectively) compared with the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group 
(67.2% and 40.6%, respectively).
Relevant Medical History and Tuberculosis Screening
The most common conditions (≥5% in the overall population) reported by subjects were hypertension 
(38.1%), low back pain (34.1%), hyperlipidemia (18.4%), diabetes mellitus 10.2%), depression (8.1%), 
chronic liver disease (7.1%), and coronary artery disease (5.5%).
The distribution of study population comorbidities was generally similar across all treatment groups, with 
the exception of chronic liver disease: 5.5% in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, 10.2% in the 
guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, and 5.6% in the placebo group.
Prior to screening, 9 (2.4%) subjects had a known history of latent TB: 4 (1.0%) subjects were receiving 
treatment for latent TB at the time of the first study agent administration and 5 (1.3%) subjects had 
completed appropriate treatment for latent TB in the past 5 years. A total of 22 (5.8%) subjects required 
treatment for latent TB prior to the first study agent administration. Overall, 54.1% of subjects had a 
previous Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination.

Baseline PsA disease characteristics were generally similar across the treatment groups and were 
consistent with a PsA population. The only exception was spondylitis, which occurred with higher 
frequency in placebo and Q4W groups than in Q8W group.The median PsA duration was 3.43 years and 
the majority (56.3%) of subjects had a PsA disease duration of ≥3 years.
Baseline PsA disease characteristics for these subgroups were generally consistent with that of the overall 
population and generally well balanced among the treatment groups.
Baseline clinical characteristics of PsA from the ACR core set of outcome measurements were indicative of 
subjects with PsA of moderate to severe activity and were comparable across the treatment groups; 
however, median CRP was slightly higher in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group (1.310 mg/dL) compared 
with the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group (1.160 mg/dL) and the placebo group (1.155 mg/dL) (OC).
Baseline disease characteristics of psoriasis measurements (BSA, IGA, and PASI) were indicative of 
significant psoriatic skin involvement in a majority of subjects.
In the overall population, the majority of subjects reported scalp psoriasis (82.5%) followed by nail 
psoriasis (61.3%), and hand and/or foot psoriasis (49.0%). 
Relevant Medical History and Tuberculosis Screening
The most common conditions (≥5% in the overall population) reported by subjects were lower back pain 
(43.2%), hypertension (37.1%), hyperlipidemia (13.7%), and diabetes mellitus (8.5%). Chronic liver 
disease was reported by 4.3% of subjects.
Prior to screening, 15 (2.0%) subjects had a known history of latent TB: 12 (1.6%) subjects were 
receiving treatment for latent TB at the time of study agent administration and 3 (0.4%) subjects had

completed appropriate treatment for latent TB in the past 5 years. A total of 75 (10.1%) subjects 
required treatment for latent TB prior to the first dose of study agent administration
Overall, 474 (64.1%) subjects had a previous Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination.
The mean baseline CRP values in study PSA3002 were 2.116 mg/dL in the placebo group, 2.036 mg/dL in 
the guselkumab q8w group, and 1.807 mg/dL in the guselkumab q4w arm. Since the baseline CRP 
distribution in study PSA3002 is not normally distributed, the mean value is subject to influence by 
outliers. In this case, the median may provide more reliable information. The median CRP value was 
slightly higher in the guselkumab q8w group (1.310 mg/dL) compared with the guselkumab q4w group 
(1.160 mg/dL) and the placebo group (1.155 mg/dL). Other baseline disease characteristics in study 
PSA3002, including ACR components of swollen and tender joint counts, patient’s assessment of pain, 
patient’s global assessment of disease activity, physician’s global assessment of disease activity, and 
HAQ-DI, were comparable across treatment groups. Further, composite measures of baseline disease 
activity, including median Psoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity Score (PASDAS), Group of Research and 
Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Composite Score, (GRACE) index, mCPDAI, and DAPSA 
scores, were also comparable across the treatment groups.
All planned analyses included screening CRP (<2 or ≥2 mg/dL) as a stratification factor in the CMH test or 
as an explanatory factor in ANCOVA. To further address the Assessor’s question, a new sensitivity 
analysis was done to include log (baseline CRP +1) as a continuous covariate in the logistic regression 
model to analyze the primary endpoint of ACR 20 as well as change from baseline in modified vdH-S 
score at Week 24. These analyses confirmed the robustness of the results.
Prior and Concomitant Therapies
Study PSA3001
Prior Anti-TNFα Agents
At baseline, 31.0% of subjects had prior exposure to up to 2 anti-TNFα agents and prior exposure to 
anti-TNFα agents was balanced across the treatment groups. Among subjects with prior exposure to anti-
TNFα agents, 37.3% discontinued anti-TNFα agents due to inadequate responses and 62.7% 
discontinued for other reasons including AE accurrence (below 10% for each treatment groups) and 
financial reasons (from 25-35%in each treatment groups). The most frequently used anti-TNFα agents 
among these subjects were etanercept (33.9%) and adalimumab (31.4%).
Prior Non-biologic PsA Medications
The majority (91.3%) of subjects had received prior non-biologic treatments, including DMARDs (90.3%), 
immunosuppressives (4.5%), or apremilast (3.1%). In addition, 41.5% of the subjects had used systemic 
corticosteroids and 85.3% of the subjects had taken NSAIDs previously. 
Prior to baseline, the most commonly used DMARD was MTX (80.8%), followed by SSZ (29.4%), LEF 
(17.6%), and HCQ (1.6%). The median maximal MTX dose in the 3 months prior to baseline was 15.0 
mg/week. The majority of subjects with prior exposure to MTX (68.5%) continued use of MTX at baseline. 
Selected Baseline Medications for PsA
At baseline, 64.8% of the overall study population were receiving DMARDs, including 55.4% of 
subjects on MTX (median dose 15.0 mg/week), 5.5% on SSZ (median dose 2.0 g/day), and 3.9% on LEF 
(median dose 20 mg/day). In addition, 14.2% of subjects in the overall population were receiving oral 
corticosteroids (median dose 5.0 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) and 57.0% were receiving NSAIDs for 
PsA at baseline.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 59/179
 
 
The proportions of subjects receiving these medications at baseline were well balanced across treatment 
groups.
Concomitant Medication Modifications at Early Escape
At Week 16, 31 (8.1%) subjects met EE criteria and were allowed to initiate or increase the dose of their 
permitted concomitant medications up to the maximum allowed dose as selected by the investigator: 3 
(2.3%) subjects in guselkumab group 100 mg q4w, 4 (3.1%) subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w 
group, and 24 (19.0%) subjects in the placebo group. In guselkumab Q8W group and in the placebo 
group one of the 4 subjects and 13 of the 24 subjects, respectively, elected to adjust their concomitant 
medication for PsA.
Study PSA3002
Prior and Concomitant Therapies
Prior Medications or Therapies for PsA
The huge majority of subjects with prior PsA medication received NSAIDs (93.2%), followed by DMARDs 
(90.8%) and systemic corticosteroids (47.0%)
The majority of subjects in the study had prior exposure to MTX (85.0%) and the proportion was well 
balanced across the treatment groups. The majority of subjects (70.5%) continued use of MTX at BL.
Prior Medications or Therapies for Psoriasis
The proportion of subjects with prior exposure to medications and therapies for psoriasis was 64.5% in 
the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, 62.5% in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, and 63.4% in the 
placebo group. The type of medications or therapies used and length of exposure was well balanced 
across the treatment groups. As prior psoriasis medication, topical agent were used in 61.3% of the 
patients followed by UVB (9.5%) and PUVA (5.8%)
Selected Baseline Medications for PsA
For subjects receiving non-biologic DMARDs at baseline, the majority of subjects were receiving MTX 
(59.9%), followed by LEF (4.7%), SSZ (4.2%), and HCQ (0.4%). The median dose of MTX was 15.0 
mg/week and was the same across the treatment groups. The median dose of oral corticosteroids 
(prednisone or equivalent dose) was 5.0 mg/day in both guselkumab groups compared with 10.0 mg/day 
in the placebo group.
Concomitant Medication Modifications at Early Escape
At Week 16, 63 (8.5%) subjects met EE criteria and were allowed to initiate or increase the dose of 1 of 
the permitted concomitant medications up to the maximum protocol-allowed dose as selected by the 
investigator. Of these subjects, 27 (3.7%) subjects initiated or increased dose of permitted concomitant 
medications.

Subgroup Analyses for ACR20 response (PSA3001)
Subgroup analyses were carried out for ACR 20 response at Week 24 over subgroups defined by 
demography, baseline disease characteristics, and prior and concomitant use of medications for PsA. A 
consistent treatment benefit was observed for ACR 20 response in each of the two guselkumab dose 
groups among the subgroups defined by baseline demographics, baseline disease characteristics, and

prior and baseline medication use. For the majority of baseline demography and disease characteristics 
subgroups, the lower bound of the 95% CI of the difference in proportion of ACR 20 responders was 
above 0 for each guselkumab treatment compared with placebo, in favor of guselkumab. 
Improvement over placebo was consistently observed for ACR 20 response at Week 24 in each of the 2 
guselkumab dose groups in the subgroups defined by prior anti-TNFα agent exposure. In these 
subgroups, the lower bound of the 95% CI of the odds ratio was above 1 and the lower bound of the 95% 
CI of the difference in proportion of ACR 20 responders was above 0 for each guselkumab treatment 
compared with placebo, in favor of guselkumab. Improvement over placebo was also observed in subjects 
who had prior inadequate response to anti-TNFα agents.
For each of the 2 guselkumab dose regimens, the treatment effect was comparable among subjects with 
or without prior exposure to anti-TNFα agents.

As early as the first evaluation at Week 4, a greater reduction in DAS28 (CRP) score from baseline was 
observed in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups compared with the placebo group. The treatment effect 
increased over time and through Week 24 for both guselkumab q8w and q4w groups versus placebo. At 
Week 24, a significantly greater reduction from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) score was observed in both 
guselkumab groups, compared with placebo (both global adjusted p<0.001.
At Week 24, the proportion of subjects achieving a DAS28 (CRP) good or moderate response was 
70.9% and 76.6% in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups, respectively, compared with 44.4% (both 
nominal p<0.001) in the placebo group.
At Week 24, DAS28 (CRP) remission was observed for a greater proportion of subjects in the 
guselkumab q8w and q4w groups (23.6% and 35.9%, respectively) compared with the placebo group 
(12.7%; nominal p<0.001 and p=0.025, respectively.

Summary of the Change from Baseline in DAS 28 (CRP) Score at Week 24 Based on the
Composite Estimand Using MI and an ANCOVA Model; Full Analysis Set 1 (Study
CNTO1959PSA3001)
In study PSA3001, the proportions of subjects who achieved a DAS28 (CRP) LDA (defined as DAS28 
(CRP) score ≤3.2 or remission) at Week 24 were 43.3% and 57.8% in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w and 
q4w groups, respectively compared with 17.5% in the placebo group (both nominal p<0.001). The 
proportions of subjects who achieved a DAS28 (CRP) remission (defined as DAS28 (CRP) score <2.6) at 
Week 24 were 23.6% and 35.9% in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w and q4w groups, respectively 
compared with 12.7% in the placebo group (nominal p=0.025 and p<0.001, respectively).
At Week 52, the proportions of subjects who achieved DAS28 (CRP) LDA or remission were 65.2%, 
73.2%, and 61.2% in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w, q4w, and placebo→guselkumab 100 mg q4w groups, 
respectively. The proportions of subjects who achieved DAS28 (CRP) remission at Week 52 were 
43.8%, 56.1%, and 37.9% in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w, q4w, and placebo→guselkumab 100 mg q4w 
groups, respectively.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 66/179
 
 
Among those subjects who achieved DAS28 (CRP) LDA or remission and DAS28 (CRP) remission at Week 
24 with evaluable data at Week 52, the proportions of subjects who maintained DAS28 (CRP) LDA or 
remission and DAS28 (CRP) remission at Week 52 were 96.2% and 75.0%, respectively, in the 
guselkumab 100 mg q8w group and 91.8% and 86.7%, respectively, in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w 
group.
The greater proportion of subjects who achieved DAS28 (CRP) LDA or remission in both guselkumab dose 
groups at Week 24 in study PSA3002 is clinically meaningful, as is the high proportion of subjects who 
maintained this response from Week 24 to Week 52. This is further supported by the substantially greater 
proportions of subjects who achieved DAPSA LDA or remission in both Q4W and Q8W dosing groups in 
study PSA3002.
Dactylitis
At baseline, 37.4% (n=142) of subjects randomized were diagnosed with dactylitis and included in the 
efficacy analyses pertaining to dactylitis. 
At Week 24, numerically greater proportions of subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group (63.2%, 
nominal p=0.212) and the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group (65.3%, nominal p=0.088) achieved 
dactylitis resolution compared to the placebo group (49.1%) among the subjects diagnosed with 
dactylitis at BL.
At Week 24, a numerically greater reduction from baseline in dactylitis score was observed in the 
guselkumab 100 mg q4w group (LSmean change from baseline: −5.82, nominal p=0.225) and the 
guselkumab 100 mg q8w group (LSmean change from baseline: −6.11, nominal p=0.121) compared to 
the placebo group (LSmean change from baseline: −4.30.)
Enthesitis 
At baseline, 222 (58.3%) of subjects randomized were diagnosed with enthesitis and included in the 
efficacy analyses pertaining to enthesitis. 
At Week 24, 47.9% of subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group and 40.3% of subjects in the 
guselkumab 100 mg q8w group achieved enthesitis resolution compared to 27.3% of subjects in the 
placebo group (nominal p=0.013 and p=0.094, respectively).
At Week 24 LSmean change from baseline in LEI scores were −1.75 in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w 
group and −1.35 in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group compared to −1.01 in the placebo group 
(nominal p=0.004 and nominal p=0.185, respectively.
As preplanned, efficacy data for both enthesitis and dactylitis endpoints were pooled with data from study 
PSA3002 to improve precision with increased the sample size. Results from the analyses of the pooled 
data are reported in Analysis performed across trials subsection.
Other Measures of (PsA) Disease Activity
In general, greater improvement from baseline or greater proportions of subjects with a response were 
observed in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w and q4w groups compared with the placebo group for other 
measures of disease activity at Week 24, including DAPSA, PASDAS, MDA, VLDA, GRACE, and PsARC.

Patient proportions achieving low disease activity or remission based on DAPSA criteria or minimal 
disease activity (MDA) increased further from Week 24 through Week 52 in both dosing regimen. 
In Study PSA3001 proportions of patients achieving low disease activity and /or remission based on 
DAPSA or DAS28 criteria was somewhat lower in Q8W group compared to Q4W group, and this 
difference was maintained through Week 52. DAPSA LDA or remission rates in Q8W group were 42.6% 
and 59.8% at Week 24 and Week52, respectively and in Q4W group were 50.4% and 62.6% at Week24 
and Week52, respectively (Table TEFDAPSA02 in PSA3001/W60CSR). DAS28 remission rates in Q8W 
group were 24.6% and 43.8% at Week 24 and Week 52, respectively and in Q4W group were 36.8% and 
56.1% at Week 24 and Week 52, respectively. (Table TEFDAS03 in PSA3001/W60CSR). In Study 
PSA3002, however, CRP and DAPSA remission/LDA rates as well as their changes through Week 52 were 
similar for the two guselkumab dosing regimens. Namely, DAPSA LDA or remission rates at Week 24 were 
40.3% and 36.8% for Q8W and Q4W groups, respectively. At Week52, 55.6% and 55.1% DAPSA LDA or 
remission rates were observed for Q8W and Q4W groups, respectively. (Table TEFDAPSA02 in

PSA3002/W52CSR). DAS28 remission rates TEFDAS03 in PSA3002/W52CSR). DAS28 remission rates at 
Week 24 were 25.6% and 24.4% for Q8W andQ4W groups, respectively. At Week52, 39.7% and 39.6% 
DAS28 or remission rates were observed for Q8W and Q4W groups, respectively.
Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)
At baseline, 19.7% (75/381 overall) of subjects presented with the PsA subset of spondylitis with 
peripheral arthritis as their primary arthritic presentation as judged by the investigator. Among 
these subjects, a greater mean reduction (SD) from baseline in BASDAI at Week 24 was observed in the 
guselkumab q8w group (-2.630 (2.4939)) compared with the placebo group (-0.881 (1.5480), nominal 
p=0.004), and a numerically greater reduction was observed for the guselkumab q4w group (-1.837 
(2.0792), nominal p=0.067). 
Among the 17.3% (66/381) subjects with spondylitis and peripheral arthritis at baseline and 
imaging confirmation at screening, a greater mean reduction from baseline (SD) in BASDAI at 
Week 24 was observed for both the guselkumab q8w (-2.619 (2.5871)) and q4w groups (-2.189 
(1.9079)) compared with the placebo group (-0.929 (1.6007), nominal p=0.007 and p=0.038, 
respectively.).
Higher BASDAI scores indicate greater disease severity and a score decrease of ≥50% or ≥2 points from 
baseline is considered clinically meaningful.39 For the threshold response of ≥50% improvement from 
baseline (a prespecified analysis), studies PSA3001 and PSA3002 show similar results for the two 
guselkumab dose regimens. At Week 24 in study PSA3001, among subjects with the primary PsA subtype 
of spondylitis and peripheral arthritis and BASDAI score>0 at baseline, 42% and 35% of subjects in the 
guselkumab 100 mg q8w and q4w groups, respectively, met the 50% threshold, compared to 13% of 
subjects in the placebo group (Mod5.3.5.1/PSA3001/W24CSR/AttTEFBASDAI09). 
In the 23 subjects who were anti-TNFα experienced, all of whom were in study PSA3001, 3 of 7 subjects 
(43%) in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group and 2 of 5 subjects (40%) in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w 
group, and none of the subjects in the placebo group achieved BASDAI 50. 
In the small number of subjects (n=23) that were anti-TNFα experienced in study PSA3001, placebo-
treated subjects showed a much smaller change from baseline BASDAI score at Week 24 than did the 
guselkumab-treated subjects. Additionally, the anti- TNFα-experienced placebo-treated subjects showed a 
smaller mean change from baseline than did the anti-TNFα-naïve placebo-treated subjects

criteria prior to Week 24.
bSubjects either have an observed change from baseline at this visit or met TF criteria prior to this visit.
cMissing data is assumed to be Missing at Random (MAR) and is imputed using Multiple Imputation (MI).
dThe average of the mean, taken over all the MI data sets, is presented. The variance of the mean is the weighted sum 
of the average within-imputation variance and the between-imputation variance.
The mean reduction from baseline was numerically greater in the guselkumab q4w group compared with 
the q8w group. Improvements in HAQ-DI were observed as early as Week 4 in subjects receiving 
guselkumab. The improvement was numerically greater in both guselkumab groups compared with the 
placebo group at all visits from Week 4 through Week 24. 
Greater proportions of subjects in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups were observed to achieve a 
clinically meaningful HAQ-DI response (defined as ≥0.35 improvement in HAQ-DI from baseline) at 
Week 16 as well as at Week 24 (57.3% and 50.9% for Q4W and Q8W, respectively) compared with the 
placebo group (29.1%; nominal p=0.001 and p<0.001) respectively at Week 24. 
Improvement in Health-related Quality of Life
Improvement in Health-related quality of life was assessed using SF-36 PCS and MSC scores, FACIT-
Fatigue scores, and PROMIS-29 scores. At week 24, significant (SF-36 PCS,) or numeric difference was 
observed for both dosing schemes compared to PBO. Proportion of subjects reaching a clinically 
meaningful improvement on the above mentioned Health quality of life endpoints was also assessed, but 
no equivocal conclusion can be drawn from it.
MDA and VLDA
Minimal disease activity (MDA) was considered achieved if 5 of the following 7 criteria were met: tender 
joint count ≤1; swollen joint count ≤1; PASI ≤1; patient pain VAS score of ≤15; patient global disease 
activity VAS (arthritis and psoriasis) score of ≤20; HAQ ≤0.5; and LEI ≤1.
Very Low Disease Activity (VLDA) was considered achieved if all 7 criteria were met. Both MDA and VLDA 
were evaluated at Weeks 0, 16, and 24.

The proportions of subjects who met VLDA criteria at Week 16 were low and comparable among all 
treatment groups. At Week 24, 12 (9.4%) subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group and 5 (3.9%) 
subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group achieved VLDA compared with 2 (1.6%) subjects in the 
placebo group (nominal p=0.007 and p=0.447, respectively)
Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics
Exposure-Response analyses are discussed in detail in the PK/PD modelling subsection of this AR.
Efficacy and Immunogenicity
The incidence of antibodies to guselkumab across all guselkumab treatment groups through Week 24 was 
2.0%. Among the 5 subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab, 3 (60.0%) achieved an ACR 
20 response compared with 55.8% of subjects who were negative for antibodies to guselkumab. None of 
the subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab achieved ACR 50 response at Week 24. 
However, it should be noted that the number of subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab 
was small (n=5), which limits a definitive conclusion on the impact of antibodies to guselkumab on clinical 
efficacy.
In study PSA3001, the overall incidence of antibodies to guselkumab was 5.4% (20/367 subjects) 
through Week 52 and 8.7% (32/367 subjects) through Week 60 (final DBL) in subjects with PsA 
(Mod5.3.5.1/PSA3001/W60CSR/Tab5 and /AttTIR01A). Through Week 52, the incidence of antibodies to 
guselkumab was 3.2% (4/126 subjects) in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, 7.0% (9/128 subjects) in 
the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, and 6.2% (7/113 subjects) in the placebo→100 mg q4w group. Two 
(10.0%) of the 20 subjects positive for antibodies to guselkumab were positive for neutralizing antibodies 
(Nabs) to guselkumab through Week 52 (Mod5.3.5.1/PSA3001/W60CSR/AttTIR02). Five (15.6%) of the 
32 subjects positive for antibodies to guselkumab were positive for NAbs to guselkumab through Week 60 
(Mod5.3.5.1/PSA3001/W60CSR/AttTIR02A).
Efficacy data (observed) with no missing data imputation were used in this analysis. The proportions of 
subjects who achieved ACR 20 or ACR 50 responses at Week 52 were evaluated by antibodies to 
guselkumab status through Week 52 for subjects who were treated with guselkumab. For subjects who 
were positive for antibodies to guselkumab through Week 52, the presence of antibodies to guselkumab 
did not seem to preclude ACR 20 or ACR 50 responses (Mod5.3.5.1/PSA3001/W60CSR/AttTIRACR01 and 
/AttTIRACR02, respectively). Among the 13 subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab 
through Week 52 and had an ACR evaluation at Week 52, 9 subjects achieved ACR 20 response and 4 
subjects achieved ACR 50 response at Week 52.

ACR Response
Since the mean change from baseline in the total modified vdH-S score at Week 24 was not significant for 
the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group (adjusted p=0.068), the key secondary ACR response endpoints for 
the guselkumab q8w group (ie, ACR 50 and ACR 70 at Week 24 and ACR 20 and ACR 50 at Week 16), 
which were all placed below the modified vdH-S score test in the graphical procedure (Assessor’s note:

Subgroup Analyses for ACR20 response
Subgroup analyses were carried out for ACR 20 response at Week 24 over subgroups defined by 
demography, baseline disease characteristics, and prior and concomitant use of medications for PsA. A 
consistent treatment benefit was observed for ACR 20 response in each of the two guselkumab dose 
groups among the subgroups defined by baseline demographics, baseline disease characteristics, and 
prior and baseline medication use. For the majority of subgroups, the lower bound of the 95% CI of the 
difference in proportion of ACR 20 responders was above 0 for each guselkumab treatment compared 
with placebo, in favor of guselkumab.

Sensitivity analysis for ACR20 response (PSA3002)
To test the robustness of the primary endpoint analysis, the following sensitivity and supplementary 
analyses were performed:


Tipping point analyses via exhaustive scenario (all nominal p<0.001 for both doses)
Treatment policy estimand using MI imputed data (both nominal p<0.001).
Extension of indication variation assessment report




Tipping point analyses for the treatment policy estimand (all nominal p<0.001 for both doses). 
Alternative composite estimand (both nominal p<0.001).
Per-protocol estimand (both nominal p<0.001).
The results from these sensitivity and supplemental analyses including the evaluation of the impact of 
treatment failure and missing data imputation rules were consistent with the primary analysis, 
demonstrating the robustness of the primary analysis results.
Disease Activity Index Score 28 Response
At Week 24, a significantly greater reduction in the mean change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) score was 
observed in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group (LSmean: −1.59) and q4w group (LSmean: −1.62)  
compared with the placebo group (LSmean: −0.97; both adjusted p<0.001).
As early as the first evaluation at Week 2, a greater reduction in DAS28 (CRP) score from baseline was 
observed in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w and q4w groups compared with the placebo group, which 
increased by time. 
At Week 24, the proportions of subjects achieving a DAS28 (CRP) good or moderate response were 
75.4% and 80.0% in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups, respectively, compared with 52.4% (both 
nominal p<0.001) in the placebo group.
Greater proportions of subjects with DAS28 (CRP) remission at Week 24 were observed in the 
guselkumab q8w and q4w groups (24.6% and 23.3%, respectively) compared with the placebo group 
(8.5%; both nominal p<0.001).

At baseline, overall 44.9% of the subjects in study PSA3002 were diagnosed with dactylitis. Distribution 
of subjects with dactylitis at baseline was well-balanced over treatment groups. (See Baseline disease 
characteristics/Study PSA3002 subsection of this clinical AR.)
Greater proportions of subjects who achieved dactylitis resolution were observed in the q8w (56.8%) and 
q4w (63.6%) groups at Week 24 compared with placebo (38.4%; nominal p=0.007 and p<0.001, 
respectively). The number of subjects achieving dactylitis resolution was larger in both guselkumab 
treatment groups compared with the placebo group and was higher for Q4W group than for Q8W group at 
each visit from Week 2 through Week 24.
Among subjects with dactylitis at baseline, a greater reduction from baseline in dactylitis score at Week 
24 was observed in both the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups compared with the placebo group (both 
nominal p=0.002).
Enthesitis Endpoints Analyzed with Data from Study CNTO1959PSA3002 Only
At baseline, overall 68.6% of the subjects in study PSA3002 were diagnosed with enthesitis.
Greater proportions of subjects who achieved enthesitis resolution were observed in the q8w (53.8%) and 
q4w groups (43.5%) at Week 24 compared with placebo (30.3%; nominal p<0.001 and p=0.017, 
respectively). The number of subjects achieving enthesitis resolution was larger in both guselkumab 
treatment groups compared with the placebo group at each visit from Week 4 through Week 24.
At Week 24, a greater reduction from baseline in LEI score was observed for subjects in both the 
guselkumab q8w (LSmean: -1.60) and q4w groups (LSmean: -1.52) compared with placebo (LSmean: -
1.03; nominal p<0.001 and p=0.002, respectively. A greater reduction from baseline in LEI score was 
observed in both the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups compared with the placebo group at each visit 
when enthesitis was assessed through Week 24.

PSA3001 and PSA3002 showed similar results for the two guselkumab dose regimens.
Improvement in Skin Disease
Investigator’s Global Assessment of Psoriasis
In subjects with a ≥3% BSA of psoriatic involvement and an IGA score ≥2 at baseline (n=543), a 
significantly greater proportion of subjects in both the guselkumab 100 mg q8w and q4w groups (70.5% 
and 68.5%, respectively) achieved an IGA response of 0 (cleared) or 1 (minimal) and ≥2- grade 
reduction from baseline in IGA score at Week 24 compared with the placebo group (19.1%; adjusted 
p<0.001).
Greater proportions of subjects who achieved an IGA score of 0 (cleared) at Week 24 were observed in

Impact on Structural Damage
Change From Baseline in Total Modified vdH-S Score at Week 24
At baseline, the median erosion, joint space narrowing (JSN), and vdH-S scores for hands and feet 
were generally similar across the treatment groups; however, the median total modified vdH-S and 
erosion scores were slightly higher in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group (11.50 and 5.50, 
respectively) compared with the guselkumab q4w group (10.00 and 4.62, respectively) and the placebo 
group (10.50 and 4.36, respectively).
At Week 24, the mean change from baseline in total modified vdH-S score was significantly smaller 
(less progression of structural damage) in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group and numerically smaller in 
the guselkumab q8w group compared with the placebo group (adjusted p=0.006 and p=0.068, 
respectively)

Sensitivity Analyses
To test the robustness of the major secondary endpoint analysis for change from baseline in modified 
vdH-S score at Week 24, sensitivity analyses were performed.  In each of these analyses at Week 24, a 
numerically smaller change from baseline (less progression) was observed in both guselkumab treatment 
groups compared with the placebo group. These analyses also confirmed the robustness of the finding of 
a smaller change from baseline in vdH-S (less radiographic progression) for the guselkumab 100 mg q4w 
group compared with the placebo group.

A smaller change from baseline (less radiographic progression) in modified vdH-S erosion score at Week 
24 was observed in the guselkumab q4w group (LSmean: 0.13) compared with the placebo group 
(LSmean: 0.58; nominal p=0.010). A numerically smaller change from baseline was observed in the 
guselkumab q8w group (LSmean change: 0.36; nominal p=0.199) compared with the placebo group. A 
smaller change from baseline (less radiographic progression) in modified vdH-S JSN score was observed 
in both the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups (both LSmean: 0.16) compared with the placebo group 
(LSmean: 0.37; nominal p=0.028 and p=0.031, respectively.
The proportions of subjects who had no progression of structural damage at Week 24, analyzed as 
subjects who had either a change from baseline in total modified vdH-S score of ≤0 or ≤0.5 or the SDC 
showed:



The proportions of subjects with a change of ≤0 from baseline in modified vdH-S scores were 63.5% 
and 67.3% in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups compared with 64.7% in the placebo group 
(nominal p=0.752 and p=0.558, respectively. 
The proportions of subjects with a change of ≤0.5 from baseline in modified vdH-S scores were 
74.4% and 78.0% in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups compared with 72.1% in the placebo 
group (nominal p=0.577 and p=0.125, respectively. 
At Week 24, the proportions of subjects without radiographic progression based on the SDC were 
consistent with those reported above.
The separations between the guselkumab groups and the placebo group are more distinct both above 
SDC and below -SDC.
There are 3 outliers with change from baseline >15: 2 in placebo group and 1 in the guselkumab 100 mg 
q8w group. There is 1 outlier with change from baseline <−10 in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group.
Structural Damage Benefit at Week 52: Read Campaign 2 Results
For the q4w dose regimen, the mean change in total modified vdH-S score in Period 2 (0.62) was similar 
to that observed in Period 1 (0.46), as were the mean changes in erosion (0.39 and 0.31, respectively) 
and JSN (0.23 and 0.15, respectively) scores.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020

In the q8w group, a smaller mean change in total modified vdH-S score was observed in Period 2, from 
Week 24 to Week 52, (0.23) compared with Period 1, from baseline to Week 24, (0.73). This finding of a 
smaller mean change in total vdH S score in Period 2 compared with Period 1 was also observed in the 
erosion score (0.10 and 0.57, respectively), while a similar mean change was noted in the JSN score 
across the 2 periods (0.16 and 0.13, respectively). These data indicate that the effect of the guselkumab 
q8w dose regimen on inhibition of radiographic progression appears to increase beyond Week 24.

Improvement in Health-related Quality of Life
36-Item Short Form Health Survey
At Week 24, a significantly greater improvement from baseline in the SF-36 PCS and SF-36 MCS scores 
was demonstrated in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group compared with the placebo group (adjusted 
p=0.006 for both). 
A numerically greater improvement from baseline in the SF-36 PCS and MCS scores at Week 24 was 
observed for the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group compared with the placebo group (nominal p<0.001). 
Since the mean change from baseline in total modified vdH-S score at Week 24 was not significant for the 
guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, the change from baseline in the SF-36 PCS score at Week 24 was not 
formally tested for the guselkumab q8w group. SF-36 PCS and MCS scores were larger in the 
guselkumab q8w group compared with the guselkumab q4w group at each visit.  
At Week 24, the proportions of subjects who achieved ≥5-point improvement from baseline in SF-36 PCS 
score were 60.1% and 55.9% in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups, respectively, compared with 
40.2% in the placebo group.
At Week 24, the proportion of subjects who achieved ≥5-point improvement from baseline in SF-36 MCS 
score was 37.5% and 34.3% in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups, respectively, compared with 30.9% 
in the placebo group.
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue
A greater increase from baseline (improvement) in FACIT-Fatigue scores was observed in both 
guselkumab groups compared with the placebo group at each visit the FACIT-Fatigue was evaluated 
(Weeks 8, 16, and 24; all nominal p<0.001). The scores in the guselkumab q8w were comparable with 
the q4w group at Week 24.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 89/179
 
 
Similarly, the percentage of subjects with clinically meaningful improvement (≥4 points) from baseline in 
FACIT-Fatigue at Week 24 was observed to be greater in the guselkumab q8w (60.5%) and q4w (59.6%) 
groups compared with the placebo group (45.5%; nominal p<0.001 and p=0.002, respectively). 
Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics
Exposure-Response analyses are discussed in details in the PK/PD modelling subsection of this AR.
Efficacy and Immunogenicity
The incidence of antibodies to guselkumab across all guselkumab treatment groups through Week 24 was 
2.0%. The limited number of subjects positive for antibodies to guselkumab precludes a definitive 
conclusion regarding the impact of antibodies to guselkumab on efficacy.
In study PSA3002, the overall incidence of antibodies to guselkumab was 4.0%, (29/727 subjects) 
through Week 52 in subjects with PsA. Through Week 52, the incidence of antibodies to guselkumab was 
5.7% (14/247 subjects) in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, 3.3% (8/243 subjects) in the guselkumab 
100 mg q4w group, and 3.0% (7/237 subjects) in the placebo→100 mg q4w group. Three (10.3%) of the 
29 subjects with positive antibodies to guselkumab status were positive for NAbs to guselkumab.
The proportions of subjects who achieved ACR 20 or ACR 50 responses at Week 52 were evaluated by 
antibodies to guselkumab status through Week 52 for subjects who were treated with guselkumab. For 
subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab through Week 52, the presence of antibodies to 
guselkumab did not seem to preclude ACR 20 or ACR 50 responses. Among the 20 subjects who were 
positive for antibodies to guselkumab through Week 52 and had an ACR evaluation at Week 52, 15 
subjects achieved ACR 20 response and 11 subjects achieved ACR 50 response at Week 52.
Ancillary analyses
Risk Factor Analysis for Structural Damage Progression
In long-term cohort studies of PsA patients, it has been estimated that approximately 50% to 60% of 
patients with PsA will not exhibit structural damage progression over time. In study PSA3002, 35.1% (86 
of 245) of subjects in the placebo group exhibited structural damage progression, defined as a >0 
change from baseline in modified vdH-S score, at Week 24. Since many patients with PsA do not 
experience structural joint damage, and the q8w and q4w dose regimens appear to have similar benefit in 
signs and symptoms, additional analyses were performed to examine which patients may derive 
additional benefit from the q4w dose regimen in terms of inhibition of structural damage progression 
and risk factors were identified that may predict  the risk for structural damage progression.
Risk Factor Identification
Two CART analyses of radiographic progression were conducted to assess the predictive capability of 
eight risk factors.
The first CART analysis was conducted using historical data from placebo-treated subjects from 5 
clinical studies in PsA conducted by the Applicant to identify predictive factors in a population with 
active PsA. This analysis identified the number of joints with erosion at baseline as the risk factor 
with highest predictive value for identifying subjects at greater risk for progression of structural 
damage. 
The second CART analysis, which excluded the 2 radiographic based risk factors (number of joints 
with erosion and number of joints with JSN), identified baseline CRP level as the risk factor with 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 90/179
 
 
highest predictive value for identifying subjects at greater risk for progression of structural damage. 
These final CART analyses identified (i) ≤5 versus >5 joints with erosions and (ii) CRP ≤1.4 versus 
>1.4 as the cutoffs that identified patients at low risk.  
Next, the 2 independently identified risk factors were evaluated for predictive potential in PSA3002 
study. Results obtained in the analyses of radiographic data from placebo-treated subjects in study 
PSA3002 using the risk factors identified above were comparable to those observed for the historical 
placebo data analyses from prior PsA clinical studies. 
CRP Risk Factor
CRP effectively discriminated high and low erosion risk subjects in the placebo group; Figure . 5.4.2.9 
In the placebo group, subjects with a CRP level ≤1.4 mg/dL (n=137) showed change from baseline in the 
total modified vdH-S score at Week 24 of LSmean change 0.31, while subjects with CRP >1.4 mg/dL 
(n=109) showed a change from baseline in the total modified vdH-S score at Week 24 of LSmean change 
1.74; Figure 10; Appendix AH_TEFXRAY01_CRP). These observations suggest that CRP provides good 
discriminatory value in identifying patients at low versus high risk of structural damage progression.
Figure 5.4.2.9:
Mean Change from Baseline in Modified vdH-S Score at Week 24 by 
Baseline CRP Level (mg/dL); Subjects Randomized in Study CNTO1959PSA3002
Additional analyses were conducted to evaluate radiographic outcomes by treatment group in subjects at 
low versus high risk of structural damage progression based on baseline CRP level. No difference 
was observed between the guselkumab q8w and q4w dose regimens, suggesting that in this population, 
the guselkumab q4w dose regimen does not add incremental benefit over the q8w regimen.
In contrast, for subjects at high risk (ie, CRP >1.4 mg/dL), subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w 
group (n=108) had less progression as reflected by the change from baseline in the total modified vdH-S 
score at Week 24 of 0.54 compared with 1.01 for subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group (n=117) 
and 1.74 for subjects in the placebo group (n=109).
Erosion Risk Factor
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 91/179
 
 
Subjects with ≤5 joints with erosions (n=163) had an LSmean change of 0.54 from baseline in the 
total modified vdH-S score at Week 24, while subjects with >5 joints with erosions (n=83) had an 
LSmean change of 1.66 from baseline in the total modified vdH-S score at Week 24 (Figure 
5.4.2.10.). For subjects with ≤5 joints with erosions, a comparable effect was observed for both the 
guselkumab q4w (LSmean change: 0.45) and q8w (LSmean change: 0.25) dose regimens: 
In contrast, for subjects at high risk (ie, >5 joints with erosions), those in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w 
group (n=98) had less progression as reflected by the change from baseline in the total modified vdH-S 
score at Week 24 (LSmean change: 0.08) compared with subjects in the guselkumab q8w group (n=96, 
LSmean change: 0.94) and the placebo group (n=83, LSmean change: 1.66; Figure 11 and Appendix 
AH_TEFXRAY01_VECNT). These observations show that the q4w dose regimen has greater impact on 
structural damage progression than the guselkumab q8w regimen in this subpopulation.

with Erosion; Subjects Randomized in Study CNTO1959PSA3002
Adapted from: AH_TEFXRAY01_VECNT.RTF, 19FEB2020, 15:43
Regardless of whether a single risk factor or a combination of both risk factors were used, the same 
pattern emerged with: (1) higher structural damage progression for subjects receiving placebo in the 
high-risk group when compared to those in the low-risk group, (2) a similar effect for the guselkumab 
q8w and q4w dose regimens within the low-risk group, and (3) greater inhibition of progression of q4w 
compared to q8w within the high-risk group. Further, the least restrictive versus most restrictive 
definitions of low-risk subjects (ie, subjects who had either CRP ≤1.4 mg/dL or ≤5 joints with erosions, 
which represented almost 80% of subjects versus subjects who had both CRP ≤1.4 mg/dL and ≤5 joints 
with erosions, which represented approximately 40% of patients) performed equally well in identifying a 
subpopulation who had a minimal risk of structural damage progression and who did equally well with 
guselkumab q8w or q4w dose regimens. Thus, many patients may be sufficiently treated with the q8w 
regimen and would not require q4w dosing for structural damage benefit.

population were considered at the planning stage of the PsA Phase 3 program, with particular focus on 
factors for which there are reasons to believe that they are prognostic for radiographic outcomes based 
on prior evidence and/or biological plausibility.
As C-reactive protein (CRP) is a well-known predictor for radiographic progression, it was selected as a 
stratification factor in PSA3002 to ensure that subjects with high CRP were balanced across the treatment 
groups to minimize potential bias in evaluation of radiographic endpoints. Further, prespecified subgroup 
analyses included baseline demographics, baseline disease characteristics, and prior baseline medication 
use where relevant baseline disease characteristics which predict risk for radiographic progression in PsA 
were also included, i.e.:




PsA disease duration (<1, >1 ≤3, or >3 years);
CRP (<1, 1 to <2, ≥ 2 mg/dL and by tertile);
number of swollen joint counts (<10, 10 to 15, or >15); and
presence or absence of dactylitis.
For the endpoint of mean change from baseline in total modified vdH-S score at Week 24, there was an 
apparent dose-response in the following 4 subgroups defined at baseline (hereafter referred as the ‘
clinical risk factors’): PsA disease duration >3 years, CRP ≥2 mg/dL, number of swollen joint counts >15, 
or presence of dactylitis. These data are summarized in Figure 3 with the corresponding reciprocal 
subgroups pooled for clarity (hereafter referred to as ‘complementary subgroup’).
Additional post-hoc analyses were conducted in subgroups with baseline total modified vdH-S score, 
erosion score or joint space narrowing score ≤ versus > than the median of the overall study population. 
A dose-response was also observed in subgroups with > median baseline radiographic scores, but not in 
the subgroups with ≤ median baseline radiographic scores, suggesting that the protective effect of the 
q4w regimen is particularly relevant for patients with higher baseline total modified vdH-S, erosion, and 
joint space narrowing scores (Figure 3)

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)
Cross-study comparisons of efficacy focused on comparing results from the two Phase 3 studies, and 
evaluating consistency in the overall population for:

The magnitude of treatment effect versus placebo.
 Dose-response in efficacy, focusing on the primary, major secondary and selected other 
endpoints.

Time to onset of efficacy and response over time.
The pooled analyses of efficacy data across the 2 Phase 3 studies were performed to provide more precise 
estimates for treatment differences between each individual guselkumab dose group and the placebo 
group, and between the 2 guselkumab dose groups at each visit over time to support efficacy assessment 
and dose selection.

a: Defined as all responders who had not met any treatment failure (TF) criteria prior to the specified visit. Subjects with missing 
data at the given visit are assumed to be non-responders.
b: The adjusted p-value was obtained using the global multiplicity control procedure (PSA/W24/Mod2.7.3/Att3 [PSA3001], 
PSA/W24/Mod2.7.3/Att4 [PSA3002]). The nominal p-value is based on the CMH test. 
c: Defined as a psoriasis IGA response of 0 (cleared) or 1 (minimal) and ≥2-grade reduction from baseline in the IGA psoriasis 
score at Week 24 in subjects with ≥3% BSA psoriatic involvement and an IGA score ≥2 (mild) at baseline.
d: Defined as the change from baseline using observed data or 0 (no improvement) if a subject met treatment failure (TF) criteria 
prior to Week 24. 
e: Missing data is assumed to be missing at random (MAR) and is imputed using multiple imputation (MI). The LS mean is based 
on the combined results of the analysis of on covariance (ANCOVA) models over all of the MI data sets. 
f: The adjusted p-value was obtained using the global multiplicity control procedure (PSA/W24/Mod2.7.3/Att3 [PSA3001] 
,PSA/W24/Mod2.7.3/Att4 [PSA3002]). The nominal p-value is based on the approximately normal distribution of the 
combined LSmean.  
g: Subjects with dactylitis at baseline.
h: Subjects with resolution of dactylitis (dactylitis score >0 at baseline and a dactylitis score of 0 at the analysis visit). 
i: Analysis based on the pooled data from PSA3001 and PSA3002 were included in the multiplicity control procedure in PSA3002 
and reported in the PSA3002 CSR. 
j: Subjects with enthesitis at baseline.
k: Subjects with resolution of enthesitis are those who had a LEI enthesitis score >0 at baseline and an LEI of 0 at the analysis 
visit. 
l: Not formally tested (nft) in the hierarchical testing procedure because a prior endpoint did not achieve statistical significance.
m: The LS mean and p-value are based on the mixed effect model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis. 
For the guselkumab q4w group, all multiplicity-controlled endpoints demonstrated statistical 
significance in both studies PSA3001 and PSA3002. For the guselkumab q8w group in PSA3001, all 
multiplicity-controlled endpoints except ACR 50 response at Week 16 and ACR 70 response at Week 24 
were statistically significant. There were also an apparent modest dose-response relationship between the

two guselkumab groups at ACR20 responder rate and DAS28 remission rate endpoints over time. Note 
that all ACR components showed numerically better mean baseline values for Q4W group.
For the guselkumab q8w group in PSA3002, due to the fact that the mean change from baseline in 
total modified vdH-S score was not statistically significant, subsequent endpoints including ACR 20 and 
ACR 50 responses at Week 16, ACR 50 and ACR 70 responses at Week 24, change from baseline in SF-36 
PCS at Week 24, change from baseline in SF-36 MCS at Week 24, and resolution of dactylitis and 
resolution of enthesitis at Week 24 were not formally tested and nominal p-values are presented even if 
most of these response rate data are close to or even higher than those for guselkumab Q4W outcomes 
in PSA3002 study.
Dactylitis Endpoints Analyzed with Pooled Data from Studies CNTO1959PSA3001 and 
CNTO1959PSA3002
In both Phase 3 studies, numerically greater proportions of subjects in the guselkumab q8w and q4w 
groups achieved resolution of dactylitis at Week 24 compared with placebo . In the pooled analyses, a 
significantly greater proportion of subjects in the guselkumab q4w group and a numerically greater 
proportion of subjects in the guselkumab q8w group achieved resolution of dactylitis compared with 
placebo. The treatment effects were comparable for between the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups 
(18.0% and 21.3%, respectively). 
Numerically greater decreases (improvement) from baseline in dactylitis scores at Week 24 were 
observed for both the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups compared with placebo for both Phase 3 studies. 
In the pooled analyses, the treatment effects were comparable for the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups 
compared with placebo (LSmean difference: -1.89 and -1.77, respectively). 
Enthesitis Endpoints Analyzed with Pooled Data from Studies CNTO1959PSA3001 and 
CNTO1959PSA3002
In both Phase 3 studies, numerically greater proportions of subjects in the guselkumab q8w and q4w 
groups achieved resolution of enthesitis at Week 24 compared with placebo. In the pooled analyses, a 
significantly greater proportion of subjects in the guselkumab q4w group and a numerically greater 
proportion of subjects in the guselkumab q8w group achieved resolution of enthesitis compared with 
placebo. The treatment effect was numerically larger in the q8w group (20.1%) compared with the q4w 
group (14.6%). However, since the mean change from baseline in the total modified vdH-S score at Week 
24 was not significant for the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, the proportion of subjects achieving 
enthesitis resolution at Week 24 in the q8w group was not formally compared with the placebo group.
Numerically greater decreases (improvement) from baseline in enthesitis scores at Week 24 were 
observed for both the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups compared with placebo for both Phase 3 studies. 
In the pooled analyses, a significantly greater proportion of subjects in the guselkumab q4w group and a 
numerically greater proportion of subjects in the q8w group achieved enthesitis resolution at Week 24 
compared with placebo. In the pooled analyses, the treatment effects were comparable for the 
guselkumab q8w and q4w groups compared with placebo (LSmean difference: -0.50 and -0.57, 
respectively).
Among subjects with enthesitis at baseline, a greater reduction from baseline in LEI score at Week 24 
was observed in both the guselkumab 100 mg q8w (LSmean: −1.52) and q4w (LSmean: −1.59) groups 
compared with the placebo group (LSmean: −1.02; both nominal p<0.001) based on pooled data from 
PSA3001 and PSA3002.
Other Efficacy Endpoints Related to BASDAI
Only subjects with spondylitis with peripheral arthritis as their primary arthritic presentation of PsA 
completed the BASDAI. Subjects with spondylitis and peripheral arthritis at baseline included 86, 73, and 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 105/179
 
 
99 subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w, guselkumab 100 mg q8w, and placebo. Subjects with 
spondylitis and peripheral arthritis at baseline and BASDAI score >0 at baseline included 83, 67, and 92 
subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w, guselkumab 100 mg q8w, and placebo groups, respectively.
Among these subjects, 34, 25, and 41 subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w, guselkumab 100 mg 
q8w, and placebo groups, respectively also had pelvic x-ray confirmation at screening.
Change From Baseline in BASDAI Through Week 24
Among the 258 (34.9%) subjects with spondylitis and peripheral arthritis at baseline, a numerically 
greater reduction from baseline in BASDAI was observed in both guselkumab groups compared with the 
placebo group at each visit BASDAI was evaluated from Week 8 through Week 24.
At Week 24, a numerically greater reduction from baseline in BASDAI was observed in both the 
guselkumab 100 mg q4w group and the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group compared with the placebo 
group (both nominal p<0.001) based on the composite estimand.
Efficacy Data Through 1 Year from Studies CNTO1959PSA3001 and CNTO1959PSA3002
Efficacy and safety findings from studies PSA3001 and PSA3002 through 1 year of treatment became 
available during procedure and the MAH submitted new data with its D120 responses. 
The Week 24 efficacy analyses across both Phase 3 PsA studies with guselkumab demonstrated that 
treatment with guselkumab 100 mg q8w and q4w led to clinically meaningful improvements across 
multiple PsA disease domains. Data through 1 year demonstrated maintenance of benefit across joint and 
skin responses, soft-tissue (ie, improvements in dactylitis and enthesitis), physical function (Disability 
Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ-DI] score) and health-related quality of life (eg, SF-
36 Physical Component Summary [PCS], FACIT). In the majority of these clinical endpoints numerically 
greater clinical responses, which were generally comparable between the 2 dose groups, were observed 
at timepoints beyond Week 24 in those subjects who continued guselkumab q8w or q4w treatment 
through Week 52.

Regarding the clinically meaningful improvement of change in BASDAI score ≥2,it is the Applicant’s 
understanding that this references a decrease of ≥2 points at the individual subject level (20 mm on a 
100 mm visual analogue scale), and not a difference of ≥2 points between the mean changes of groups of 
subjects. New analyses were performed to identify the number and percent of subjects with an 
improvement in BASDAI of ≥2 points from baseline.
The results from each study and from the pooled studies are shown in Table 24 below. In both the 
individual and pooled studies, greater proportions of subjects in the guselkumab groups achieved the 
clinically meaningful improvement in BASDAI of ≥2 points from baseline compared with the placebo 
group. Although there was a difference in the placebo response rates between the 2 studies, no apparent 
differences were observed in the response rates between the guselkumab q8w and q4w dose groups or 
across the 2 studies.

Subpopulation Analyses for the Pooled Phase 3 Studies
With a few exceptions, subpopulation (subgroup) analyses generally showed similar ACR responses 
between various subgroups. Therefore, only the subgroups with ACR response deviations are presented 
below. 
For diabetes status, consistently higher ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70 responses were observed over 
time in the guselkumab groups compared with the placebo group, regardless of diabetes status. For ACR 
20 and 50, response rates trended higher in subjects with diabetes compared with those without 
diabetes, while results were generally comparable for ACR 70. Results were generally comparable for the 
guselkumab 100 mg q8w and q4w groups across ACR responses within each subgroup. 
For BMI categories, there were no different response on ACR20 endpoint by BMI categories in the Phase-3 
PSA studies.
For baseline DMARD and MTX use, subgroup of subjects achieving an ACR 20 response in both 
guselkumab groups group were comparable with results on subjects not receiving DMARDs at BL.
For baseline DMARD use, subgroup of subjects achieving an ACR 50 response in the q8w group who 
were receiving a DMARD at baseline was somewhat smaller (28.5%) compared with subjects not 
receiving DMARDs at BL (36.1%).
For baseline MTX use, subgroup of subjects achieving an ACR 50 response in the q8w group who 
were receiving MTX at baseline was somewhat smaller (26.8%) compared with subjects not receiving 
MTX at BL (36.1%).

According to the pooled subgroup analysis, prior TNF alfa i use seemed to have no effect on ACR 
response rates. (In this analysis, TNF-alfa i naive patients from PSA3001 and patients from PSA3002 
were pooled.)
Clinical studies in special populations
No clinical studies in special populations were submitted this was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Efficacy and Safety of Guselkumab in the Treatment of Subjects With Active Psoriatic Arthritis 
Figure 5.4.2.11 Study Schema for the Phase 2 PsA Study CNTO1959PSA2001
Methods
Study participants
Subjects eligible for the study were adult men or women at least 18 years of age with active PsA for at 
least 6 months prior to the first administration of study drug who meet ClASsification criteria for Psoriatic 
ARthritis (CASPAR) criteria at screening. They had an inadequate response to current or prior standard 
therapies (eg, MTX, corticosteroids). Subjects must have symptoms of active PsA at screening and 
baseline and have a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of ≥0.3 mg/dL at screening. Subjects must not have 
been treated with guselkumab or ustekinumab in the past. Subjects must have had plaque psoriasis in at 
least 3% of BSA Subjects with prior biologic treatments (other than 1 anti-TNFα agent) or JAK-inhibitors 
for PsA or psoriasis were excluded, including but not limited to guselkumab, ustekinumab, or any other 
therapeutic agent targeted at IL-12, IL-17, or IL-23. Up to 20% of subjects with prior exposure to 1 anti-
TNFα agent were permitted. Anti-TNFα agents received prior to the study entry must have been washed 
out within 8 weeks (adalimumab, golimumab SC, certolizumab pegol or etanercept or biosimilars to these

agents) or 12 weeks (infliximab [or its biosimilars] or golimumab IV) before the first study agent 
administration. 
Approximately 150 subjects who satisfied all inclusion and exclusion criteria were to be randomized using 
permuted block randomization stratified by prior anti-TNF use in a 2:1 ratio to receive either guselkumab 
100 mg or placebo SC at Weeks 0, 4, 12, and 20. Subjects with prior exposure to 1 anti-TNFα agent were 
permitted but limited to 20% of the study population. A stable dose of MTX, oral corticosteroids, or 
NSAIDs/analgesics was permitted but not required during the study. At Week 24, subjects randomized to 
placebo crossed over to guselkumab and receive guselkumab 100 mg at Weeks 24, 28, 36 and 44. 
Subjects randomized to guselkumab received a placebo injection at Week 24, then continued to receive 
guselkumab at Weeks 28, 36 and 44. Subjects in both treatment groups who had <5% improvement 
from baseline in both tender and swollen joint counts at Week 16 qualified for early escape (EE) and 
received open-label ustekinumab (STELARA®) 45 mg or 90 mg at Weeks 16, 20, 32, and 44 based on the 
approved dosage for the PsA indication in the particular country of study. There was a post treatment 
follow-up period from Week 44 to Week 56. Database locks were at Weeks 24 and 56.

Table 5.4.2.31 Number of Subjects Who Discontinued Study Agent through Week 44; Full 
Analysis Set (Study CNTO1959PSA2001) 
Recruitment
A total of 149 subjects were enrolled at 34 sites in 7 countries: Canada (n=6), Germany (n=4), Poland 
(n=25), Romania (n=5), Russia (n=89), Spain (n=9), and the US (n=11).
The study was initiated on 27 March 2015 when the first subject consented to participate in the study. 
The last study-related procedure was performed on 17 January 2017. 
Baseline data
Study PSA2001 randomly assigned a total of 149 subjects across 2 treatment groups with 100 subjects in 
the guselkumab 100 mg group and 49 subjects in the placebo group. The demographic characteristics of 
the enrolled population were generally well balanced between randomized groups . All subjects were 
white and 51.0% of the subjects were male. The median age was 47.0 years and the median weight was 
82.0 kg.
Baseline disease characteristics were similar across treatment groups and indicative of a study population 
with active PsA. The most prevalent PsA subtypes were polyarticular arthritis with no rheumatoid nodules 
(39.6%) and asymmetric peripheral arthritis (26.8%). Similar to other PsA populations, the median 
duration of psoriasis (12.8 years) was substantially greater than the median duration of PsA (4.0 years). 
The ACR core set of outcome measurements were indicative of subjects with active PsA and were 
generally comparable across the treatment groups. Subjects had median numbers of swollen and tender 
joints of 9.0 and 17.0, respectively, a median HAQ-DI score of 1.5, and a median CRP of 0.91 mg/dL. At 
baseline, 54.4% of subjects had dactylitis with a mean score (1-60) of 5.7 and 71.8% of subjects had 
enthesitis at baseline, with a mean enthesitis score (1-6) of 2.7. Subjects had a median percent of BSA 
skin involvement of 10.0% and the median PASI score was 7.85.  Mean BSA and PASI were higher in the 
guselkumab group (17.2 and 12.03, respectively) compared to the placebo group (13.6 and 9.88, 
respectively). a higher proportion in the guselkumab group had hand/foot psoriasis (45.0% vs 34.7% in 
the placebo group).A higher proportion of subjects in the guselkumab group reported DIP joint arthritis 
(63.0% vs 44.9% in the placebo group) and asymmetric peripheral arthritis (61.0% vs 46.9% in the 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

placebo group). More subjects in the guselkumab group (6 [6.0%]) than in the placebo group (1 [2.0%]) 
reported prior joint procedures,
At baseline, 44.3% of subjects were taking MTX at a median dose of 15.0 mg/week and 13.4% of 
subjects were taking oral corticosteroids at a median dose of 6.25 mg/day. A majority of subjects 
(71.1%) were taking NSAIDs at baseline and 87.9% of subjects had prior DMARD experience. A total of 
13 subjects (8.7%) had prior exposure to anti-TNFα therapies 
Numbers analysed
Through Week 24, the efficacy analysis data set (Full Analysis Set) included all subjects who were 
randomized into the study and received at least 1 administration of study treatment (guselkumab or 
placebo), ie, modified Intent-to-Treat population.

In guselkumab patients, further improvement on ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70 response rates from 
Week 24 was observed, and the improvement was maintained through Week 44 (77.4%, 46.4%, and 
26.2%, respectively).
For placebo → guselkumab crossover group patients, rapid improvement on ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 
70 response rates was observed at Week 28 compared to Week 24, 4 weeks after receiving the first 
injection of guselkumab. Improvement continued over time and by Week 44, the ACR 20, ACR 50, and 
ACR 70 response rates (75.0%, 46.4%, and 25.0%, respectively) were numerically comparable to those 
in the guselkumab group (Figure 5.4.2.13.).
For subjects in the guselkumab group, the proportion of subjects with unresolved enthesitis was 
38.8% at Week 24 and it was maintained through Week 44 (37.9%) and through Week 56.
For subjects in the placebo → guselkumab crossover group, the proportion of subjects with 
unresolved enthesitis was 66.7% at Week 24, 35.3% at Week 32. After some increase through Week 44 
(47.1%) it decreased again through Week 56 (37.5%).
For subjects in the guselkumab group, the proportion of subjects with unresolved dactylitis was 
40.0% at Week 24 and 20.4% at Week 44, maintained through Week 56.
For subjects in the placebo → guselkumab crossover group, the proportion of subjects with 
unresolved dactylitis was 81.3% at Week 24, 62.5% at Week 28, and 6.3% at Week 56.
For subjects in the guselkumab group, PASI 50, PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100 responses at 
Week 44 were 94.0%, 90.4%, 81.9%, and 63.9%, respectively at Week 44. The skin response was

For subjects in the placebo → guselkumab crossover group, only one subject (3.4%) achieved MDA 
at Week 24 prior to receiving guselkumab. After the switch, 14.3% and 28.6% of these patients achieved 
MDA at Week 28 and Week 44, respectively. Further remarkable improvement could be observed through 
Week 56 with 44.4% of the crossover subjects achieving MDA.
Improvement in Physical Function
At baseline, both the placebo and the guselkumab groups had a similar HAQ-DI. The change from 
baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 24 was significantly greater in the guselkumab group compared with the 
placebo group (mean: -0.42 and -0.06, respectively; adjusted p<0.001. 
Improvement in Health-related Quality of Life
At Week 24, the change from baseline in SF-36 PCS was greater in the guselkumab group (mean: 6.59) 
compared with the placebo group (mean: 0.46, nominal p<0.001); the mean change from baseline in SF-
36 MCS was 4.95 in the guselkumab group compared with 0.42 in the placebo group (nominal p=0.002). 
The improvements were well maintained through Week 44 and Week 56.
Subgroup Analyses
Consistency of treatment effect for the primary endpoint of ACR 20 at Week 24 was examined across:



Baseline demographic and geographic subgroups , 
Baseline disease characteristics subgroups, 
Prior or concomitant medication use subgroups
In subgroup analyses, significantly or numerically higher treatment effect was observed in the 
guselkumab group on the primary endpoint ACR20 for almost subgroups. The exceptions were few 
subgroups in which a small sample size limited the interpretation. According to the Applicant's 
explanation, these effects had similar route cause: namely, the low patient number coupled with a higher 
placebo effect in some of the concerned subgroups.
Efficacy and Immunogenicity 
To evaluate the impact of antibodies to guselkumab on clinical efficacy in study PSA2001, ACR responses 
and PASI responses were evaluated according to antibody status for all subjects with appropriate 
samples. The incidence of antibodies to guselkumab was 4.7% (6/128) through Week 44 and Week 56.
For subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab through Week 44, the presence of antibodies 
to guselkumab had no apparent impact on ACR 20 or ACR 50 responses or PASI 75 response. However, it 
should be noted that the number of subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab was too 
small (n=6) to draw any conclusion on the effect of antibody development on clinical efficacy.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
Design and conduct of clinical studies
Tremfya (guselkumab) is already approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. Now, the MAH seeks for 
an approval of an extended indication for guselkumab alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) 
for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult patients who have had an inadequate response 
or who have been intolerant to a prior disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy. 
Recommendations of the EMA guideline (Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products indicated 
for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, CHMP/EWP/438/04) have mostly been taken into account. The 
MAH did not seek Scientific Advice from either EMA or NCAs.  The clinical development program includes 
one completed Phase 2 study (PSA2001), and two global Phase 3 studies (PSA3001 and PSA3002 
(ongoing)) in subjects with active PsA. This submission contains efficacy and safety data through Week 
56 of guselkumab treatment from the Phase 2 trial and mainly 24 week-data from the two Phase 3 trials. 
With the responses to the first RSI, the MAH provided preliminary efficacy and safety data from phase 3 
studies through week 52.
The three PsA studies included a target population of adult subjects diagnosed with active PsA for at least 
6 months prior to the first administration of study agent and who met ClASsification criteria for Psoriatic 
ARthritis (CASPAR) at screening. Active PsA was defined in studies PSA2001 and PSA3001: ≥3 swollen 
joints, ≥3 tender joints, and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of ≥0.3 mg/dL; in study PSA3002: ≥5 
swollen joints, ≥5 tender joints, and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of ≥0.6 mg/dL. Subjects must have 
had inadequate response or evidence of intolerance to current or previous PsA treatments including non-
biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) treatment (≥3 months), apremilast (≥4 
months), and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy (≥4 weeks) prior to the first 
administration of study agent. 
Subjects with prior exposure to anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) agents were allowed in studies 
PSA2001 (1 anti-TNFα agent limited to 20% of the study population) and PSA3001 (up to 2 anti-TNFα 
agents and limited to approximately 30% of the study population). Subjects in study PSA3002 were 
required to be biologic-naïve and with higher PsA activity. The requirements for a fully biologic naïve 
population in this study, along with higher CRP levels and higher joint counts compared with other studies 
(PsA2001 and PsA3001), were selected in order to enrol a population appropriate for assessment of 
radiographic progression and to increase the power for detection of a treatment effect for guselkumab on 
the radiographic endpoints.
Based upon the clinical efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) data, and exposure-response modeling 
analysis using data from the Phase 2 study of guselkumab in subjects with PsA, 2 guselkumab s.c. dose 
regimens were chosen for evaluation in the guselkumab Phase 3 PsA program: 100 mg s.c. at Weeks 0 
and 4, then q8w thereafter (q8w), i.e. the same as for approved for plaque psoriasis OR 100 mg s.c. q4w.  
In the Phase 2 study subjects were randomised in 1:2 ratio to placebo or to guselkumab q8w, through 
Week 44. At Week 24, subjects on placebo were crossed over to double blind guselkumab through week 
52. 
In the Phase 3 studies, patients were randomised in 1:1:1 ratio to placebo or to one of the guselkumab 
treatment groups q8w or q4w. Randomization was stratified by baseline non-biologic DMARD use in both 
Phase 3 studies. In addition, randomization was also stratified by prior exposure to anti-TNFα agents in 
study PSA3001 and in addition by CRP (<2.0 mg/dL or ≥2.0mg/dL) in study PSO3002. 
At Week 16, all subjects with <5% improvement from baseline in both tender and swollen joint counts 
were considered as meeting EE criteria and received open-label ustekinumab in Study PsA2001 or 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 119/179
 
 
remained on the dosing regimen they were randomized to at Week 0 and allowed to initiate or increase 
the dose of one of the permitted concomitant medications up to the maximum allowed dose specified in 
the protocol in studies PsA3301 and PsA3002.
At Week 24, subjects on placebo were crossed over to double blind guselkumab q4w. This study design 
hampers robust assessment of efficacy and safety, as it allows evaluation effects to placebo only short-
term (week 24) and not until one year. However, the CHMP understand the rationale of this design from 
an ethical perspective.
For both studies, the primary endpoint was American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at 
Week 24.
The full length of the treatment period of the Phase-3 studies will be 48 weeks with a final efficacy visit at 
Week 52 and an 8-week follow-up through Week 60. 
Key secondary endpoints included IGA, DAS 28 (CRP), HAQDI as well as higher ACR responses 50, 70, 
effects on BASDAI, dactylitis, enthesitis and QoL. In study 3002 an additional key secondary endpoint 
was the change from baseline in modified vdH-S score at Week 24.
Neither pivotal studies in PsA had an active control arm but placebo control is acceptable to the CHMP. At 
the CHMP’s request, the Applicant provided skin psoriasis-related efficacy data from guselkumab PSO 
studies PSO3001, 3002, 3003 and 3009 for PSO patients with history of PsA. In these Phase-3 PSO 
studies patients reported about their PsA diagnosis at the screening. There was no information provided 
in the CSRs of Phase 3 PSO studies whether or not patients with PsA diagnosis met the CASPAR criteria of 
active PsA at the screening/BL.
The efficacy assessments included standard and approved measures of the signs and symptoms of PsA, 
including assessment of effect in soft tissue involvements (enthesitis and dactylitis) and axial 
manifestations. Inhibition of structural damage by using usual radiographic endpoints was also assessed, 
together with physical function, psoriatic skin, nail and scalp manifestations, health-related quality of life 
and health economics assessments.
Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary endpoint of the proportion of subjects who achieved 
an ACR 20 response at Week 24 over baseline demographics, baseline disease characteristics, and prior 
and baseline medication use.
Design and conduct of clinical studies were overall considered acceptable to the CHMP.
Efficacy data and additional analyses
Phase 2 study included 149 patients while Phase 3 studies 360 and 684 patients, into studies PSA3001 
and PSA3002, respectively. 
Overall completion rates were high in phase 3 studies: more than 97% of guselkumab-patients completed 
studies, among patients with placebo the discontinuation rates were 7 and 0.8% in PSO3001 and 3002 
studies, respectively. More subject with placebo-treatment had an early escape: around 3% and 5% in 
guselkumab-arms, 15 % and 19% in placebo-arms in PSO3001 and 3002, respectively. Completion of 
Phase 2 trial was similarly high but considerably more subjects had early escape at week 16: 35% and 
10% for placebo and guselkumab, respectively. Negligible proportion of subjects dropped out due to lack 
of efficacy and proportion of early escape -patients were generally low with the active treatment. 
Proportion of patients with treatment failure with guselkumab in the phase 3 studies were low (cca 2-5% 
in guselkumab-arms), however, treatment failure rates differed considerably across studies for placebo-
patients: 16.7% vs. 6.9% in studies PSA3001 and 3002, respectively. The MAH explained it with 
differences in treatment duration, differences in number of subjects with prior bDMARD and TNF-alfa 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 120/179
 
 
inhibitor experiences (prior bDMARD medication incl. TNF-alfa I agents was allowed in Study PSA3001 
only) and differences in ACR 20 response rate in the placebo groups of studies PSA3001 and 3002. This 
was considered acceptable to the CHMP.
In PSA3001, Baseline BSA and PASI measurements suggested the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group had 
more severe psoriasis compared to the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group and the placebo group. In 
addition, the proportion of subjects with IGA ≥2 (mild to severe) was higher in the guselkumab 100 mg 
q4w group (85.9%) compared to the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group (78.7%) and placebo (73.0%).
In the Phase 3 studies, a significantly greater proportion of subjects met the criteria for ACR 20 response 
at week 24 in the guselkumab groups, compared to the placebo group. The ACR20 responder rates were 
clinically relevant: cca. 29% vs cca 60% in the placebo and guselkumab arms, respectively. 
Results on most of the main secondary endpoints support efficacy. Significantly higher improvement was 
shown with all endpoints relevant for signs and symptoms of PsA, such as ACR50, ACR70 response rates 
or DAS28 change from baseline. Secondary endpoints for psoriatic skin disease such as PASI and IGA 0-1 
responder rates, and health-related general measures, as HQI-DI, SF-36 PCS and FACIT-fatigue scores 
have been met. Effect on skin manifestations was somewhat smaller but overall robust and similar to the 
efficacy observed in the guselkumab psoriasis studies. However, efficacy seems to increase over time.
For soft tissue inflammation, such as dactylitis or enthesitis some slight inconsistencies can be observed. 
Improvement for these endpoints was mostly significant vs. placebo, however, in study PSA3001, the 
improvement of dactylitis was not significant with either guselkumab dose regimens vs. placebo. The q8w 
dose regimen was not significantly better than placebo in study PSA3002. The same was observed for 
enthesitis in PSA3002, although a pronounced numerical difference in enthesitis resolution was observed 
in both guselkumab groups compared to placebo. In the CHMP’s view, these observations do not impair 
the overall favourable efficacy of guselkumab in soft tissue manifestations of PsA. 
For QoL scores such as HAQ-DI, SF-36 PCS and FACIT Fatigue, both Q8W and Q4W regimens achieved a 
statistically significant difference at week 24. However, for mental subscale of SF-36 in Study PSA3001, 
change from baseline was not significant for either guselkumab groups compared to placebo.
According to the prespecified testing hierarchy in study PSA3002, statistical significance of secondary 
endpoints, which were at lower rank in the testing hierarchy than vdH-SS was not controlled for 
multiplicity. Therefore, difference between placebo and these secondary endpoints observed for Q8W 
treatment group were handled as numerical ones which was acceptable to the CHMP. 
The proportion of study subject had moderate to severe axial involvement at baseline: 20% and 35% of 
patients had spondylitis with peripheral arthritis at baseline in studies 3001 and 3002, respectively. This 
reflects general PsA population, whose 20-50% have involvement of both the spine and peripheral joints, 
usually with more prominent peripheral joint features-as the EMA Guideline mentions. Among these 
subjects, a significantly greater reduction from baseline in BASDAI was observed in the guselkumab q8w 
groups compared with the placebo group in both studies and with q4w dose in study PSA3002; and a 
numerically greater reduction was observed for the guselkumab q4w group in study PSA3001. At Week 
24 in study PSA3001, among subjects with the primary PsA subtype of spondylitis and peripheral arthritis 
and BASDAI score>0 at baseline, 42% and 35% of subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w and q4w 
groups, respectively, met the 50% threshold of clinically relevant BASDAI score change, compared to 
13% of subjects in the placebo group. In the 23 subjects who were anti-TNFα experienced, all of whom 
were in study PSA3001, proportions of subjects met the 50% threshold of clinically relevant BASDAI score 
change were similar. As study 3002 contained a larger sample size of patients with spondylitis the results 
are considered as significant and clinically relevant. In study PSA3002, 39% and 37% of subjects in the 
guselkumab q8w and q4w groups, respectively, met the threshold at Week 24, compared to 22% of 
subjects in the placebo group. In both the individual and pooled studies, greater proportions of subjects 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 121/179
 
 
in the guselkumab groups achieved the clinically meaningful improvement in BASDAI of ≥2 points from 
baseline compared with the placebo group. The results of the analyses described above appear to be 
consistent and seem to support the hypothesis that guselkumab 100 mg q8w or q4w improves the 
symptoms of spondylitis in subjects with spondylitis and peripheral arthritis as their primary presentation 
of PsA.
Greater improvement was consistently observed in the guselkumab group compared with the placebo 
group across different subgroups, with the exception of a few subgroups in which a small sample size 
limited the interpretation. Improvement in ACR 20 response at Week 24 was consistently observed in 
both subgroups with or without concomitant PsA medications including non-biologic DMARDs (eg, MTX), 
oral corticosteroids, and NSAIDs. Prior exposure to anti-TNFα therapies did not have an impact on ACR 20 
and ACR50 response rates and HAQ-DI improvement. Subgroup of patients with prior inadequate 
response to TNFα-i showed similar efficacy than the overall study population. Efficacy was consistent 
regardless of baseline MTX (or other DMARD) use (yes/no). The vast majority of subjects who received 
concomitant cDMARD, received actually MTX 58.4%) and the minority other DMARDs (9.4%). Those data 
are supportive of the claimed indication. 
Guselkumab treatment led to an onset of clinical responses as early as 4 weeks after initiating treatment, 
with clinically significant improvements through 24 weeks of treatment as assessed by ACR responses 
and IGA for both the q8w and q4w dose regimens. A similar trend was observed for the change from 
baseline in DAS28 (CRP) and the change from baseline in HAQ-DI. While lower threshold responses (e.g., 
ACR 20) usually reached a plateau effect around week 16-week 20 (in PSA3001) or Week 24 (in 
PSA3002); higher threshold responses (e.g., ACR 70) continued to increase through Week 24. 
In study PSA2001, guselkumab demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo in subjects with active PsA 
across all efficacy endpoints on joint signs and symptoms, enthesitis, dactylitis, physical function, skin 
disease, and health-related quality of life. Efficacy of guselkumab in the treatment of PsA was maintained 
through Week 56 of the study. Longer term efficacy of guselkumab in PsA beyond 24 weeks will become 
available as study PSA3002 is still ongoing, through 112 Weeks, respectively. However, assessed 
comprehensively in a longer-term data from Phase 3 studies were provided to support maintenance of 
efficacy over time. Data for joint disease activity and some measures for psoriatic skin disease were 
provided. These data suggest that efficacy on joint disease activity, radiographic endpoints and on skin 
disease was maintained and even improved further beyond 24 weeks with both q4w and q8w dose 
regimens. Long-term data will be assessed comprehensively in a separate variation once also the final 
CSRs of studyPSA3002 will be available.
Studies PSA3001 and PSA3002 were designed to study the efficacy of guselkumab 100 mg s.c. with 
either q4w or q8w maintenance dosing and therefore do not allow for an assessment of response after 
discontinuation from therapy. The MAH explains that guselkumab q8w dose regimen maintained PASI 
responses and IGA scores through Week 156 in the ongoing long-term extension of psoriasis studies. 
Supportive data from the randomized withdrawal phase of a large Phase 3 psoriasis study (PSO3002) 
demonstrated that subjects receiving q8w maintenance therapy generally maintained response while 
subjects randomized to withdrawal from therapy lost response over time. To date, no signal for decrease 
in efficacy over time has be observed with guselkumab.  No further data on PsA-related endpoints in the 
subset of psoriatic patients with PsA involvement in long-term extension psoriasis studies are available. 
With regards to the lack of active control arm in PsA studies, the MAH refers to psoriasis studies which 
involved psoriatic patients with PsA, as well. In pivotal PSO studies PSO3001 and 3002 guselkumab was 
found superior to adalimumab,in Study 3009 (ECLIPSE), guselkumab was superior to secukinumab and in 
study PSO3003 (NAVIGATE) guselkumab was superior to ustekinumab on psoriasis skin disease-related 
endpoints also in subgroup of patients with (earlier) PsA diagnosis. Moreover, according to the results of a 
network meta-analysis for PsA clinical trials both guselkumab Q4W and Q8W dosing regimens were 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 122/179
 
 
favourable over or at least comparable to several bDMARDS (including TNFi –s and IL-17 and or IL-23i-s) 
and tofacitinib in ACR20 response rates. 
The incidence rates of antibody formation to guselkumab were small: 4.7%, 2.0% and 2.0% in studies 
PSA2001, 3001 and 3002, respectively. For subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab, the 
presence of antibodies to guselkumab had no apparent impact on ACR 20 or ACR 50 in PSA2001 and 
3001. However, ACR 20 response rate was lower for subjects who were ADA- positive for ADA (55.6% 
(n=5) compared with 64.7% of subjects who were ADA- negative. Similarly, ACR 50 response rate was 
lower for ADA-positives than for ADA-negatives (22.2% (n=2) vs. 32.8%, respectively). In study 3001 
through Week 52, the incidence of antibodies to guselkumab was 3.2% (4/126 subjects) in the 
guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, 7.0% (9/128 subjects) in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, and 6.2% 
(7/113 subjects) in the placebo→100 mg q4w group. In study 3002 through Week 52, the incidence of 
antibodies to guselkumab was 5.7% (14/247 subjects) in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, 3.3% 
(8/243 subjects) in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, and 3.0% (7/237 subjects) in the placebo→100 
mg q4w group. The CHMP concluded that while the presence of antibodies to guselkumab did not seem to 
impact on ACR 20 or ACR 50 responses, the numbers are too low to be conclusive. Therefore, this issue 
will be further monitored for in the post marketing setting.
For signs and symptoms of PsA, the cumulative evidence did not suggest a clear dose difference in clinical 
efficacy between the guselkumab 100 mg q8w and q4w dose regimens. Both Q8W and Q4W regimens 
achieved significantly better results vs placebo for boths in DAS28 (CRP) LDA or remission at weeks 24 
and 52. Numerically higher responses and maintenance of both LDA and remission are noted for the Q4W 
regimen. In the overall study population, dose response was not supported by exposure-response 
analyses. In PD endpoints, no difference can be seen between the q4w and q8w regimens’ PD effects. 
In the overall PsA study population, the effect of q4w dose on inhibiton of radiographic progression was 
higher (and significant) than with q8w dose (non significant) at week 24. The effect of the guselkumab 
q8w dose regimen on inhibition of radiographic progression was higher than with q4w dose beyond Week 
24 (to week 52), suggesting that the benefit of q8w dosing on radiographic endpoints increases with 
longer exposure. Thus, altogether, the mean change in total mvdH-S was similar in the guselkumab q4w 
(1.07) and q8w groups (0.97) over 1 year of treatment in the overall PsA study population.
The MAH argues that due to the imbalance across q8w and q4w groups in radiographic score at baseline 
(with higher BL scores in in q4w group),  the benefit of guselkumab q4w may have been underestimated 
at both Week 24 compared to placebo and at Week 52 compared to guselkumab q8w dose regimen. 
The proportions of subjects showing no progression (change of ≤0 from baseline in modified vdH-S 
scores) based on the vdH-S scores were 63.5% and 67.3% in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups 
compared with 64.7% in the placebo group (nominal p=0.752 and p=0.558, respectively) at week 24. 
The MAH proposed more frequent posology (100 mg s.c. every 4 weeks) for patients at high risk for joint 
damage according to clinical judgement. To support it, a subgroup whom a more frequent posology can 
be more appropriate was identified post hoc, based on study PSA3002 results. In this study, structural 
damage progression was measured radiographically and expressed as the mean change from baseline in 
the total modified van der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) scores. To define PsA patient subgroups who may or 
may not have a high risk for radiographic progression and may benefit from the q4w dosing regimen the 
MAH provided post-hoc analyses by relevant baseline disease characteristics which predict risk for 
radiographic progression in PsA, by baseline radiographic scores and performed risk factor identification 
via CART analysis. Radiographic results from three separate approaches all supported an incremental 
benefit of the guselkumab q4w dose regimen on inhibition of structural damage compared to the q8w 
regimen. The interpretation of additional analyses to identify patients at high risk of radiographic 
progression is supported by the data presented and it is in line somewhat with EULAR guidelines; 
however, these guidelines are for patients to commence on csDMARDS and not patients for biological 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 123/179
 
 
therapies.  The initiation of a biological therapy is recommended in patients not being controlled on a cs 
DMARD but the CHMP agreed that the same poor prognostic feature should also apply in patients failing 
cs DMARDS and they can be identified by the treating rheumatologists. In the CHMP’s opinion, the MAH 
has provided sufficient evidence to support the Q4W regimen in patients at high risk for joint damage 
according to clinical judgement. It is agreed that in some patients’ a deeper suppression of the disease 
activity is needed as well as a need to be controlled as soon as possible, which would not be sufficient 
with Q8W regimen. 
The CHMP asked the MAH to further discuss which parameters should be considered for characterisation 
of a patient subgroup for whom the q4w dose regimen is more appropriate. The MAH clarified that EULAR, 
GRAPPA and ACR stresses the importance of individual treatment approach. Specific cut-offs are generally 
not specified in PsA treatment guidelines but the importance of elevated CRP and the presence of 
structural damage as evidence of severe disease for treatment considerations are noted. For example, 
ACR states that “Examples of severe PsA disease include the presence of ≥1 of the following: a poor 
prognostic factor (erosive disease, elevated levels of inflammation markers such as C-reactive protein or 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate attributable to PsA”. This can be agreed. In addition, using of some of the 
factors are not feasible in everyday clinical practice for patient selection. At the CHMP’s request, Section 
5.1 of the SmPC was updated to provide details on the subset of subjects who would benefit most from 
q4w dose regimen to inhibit radiographic progression. This update was accepted by the CHMP..
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
The totality of the data provided show that the guselkumab 100 mg s.c. q8w and q4w dose regimens 
showed benefits over placebo for the treatment of the 3 major manifestations of psoriatic disease (joint, 
soft tissue and skin), and provided improvement of physical function and health-related quality of life in 
adults with active psoriatic arthritis. Therefore the claimed indication is considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. Based on the totality of the efficacy data and analysis, the recommended guselkumab posology for 
PsA can be the same as approved for the treatment of psoriasis, i.e. 100 mg s.c. q8w after subcutaneous 
injection at weeks 0 and 4. The MAH proposed a dose regimen q4w for a subgroup of patients at high risk 
for joint damage defined post-hoc. The MAH has provided a sound rationale for the Q4W maintenance 
regimen for patients at high risk for joint damage according to clinical judgement and appropriate 
information was added in 5.1 of the SmPC for the attention of the prescriber i.e. that (in In DISCOVER 2) 
the observed benefit with the guselkumab q4w dosing regimen on inhibition of radiographic progression 
(i.e., statistical significant difference in mean change from baseline in total modified vdH-S score in the 
q4w group versus placebo) was most pronounced in subjects with both an elevated C-reactive protein 
value and high number of joints with erosions at baseline. 
2.5.  Clinical safety
Introduction
Guselkumab has received marketing approval in the United States, the European Union, and other 
countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and has 
been marketed since 13 July 2017. The overall safety profile of guselkumab was in line with compounds 
in the similar therapeutic class interfering with the IL-pathway in psoriasis. In general, the incidence of 
adverse events was low. The long-term extension data from the Phase 3 psoriasis studies through 3 years 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 124/179
 
 
demonstrated that the 3-year safety profile was consistent with the 1-year safety data reported in the 
original psoriasis marketing application.
The clinical development program of guselkumab for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) 
includes a completed global Phase 2 study (PSA2001) and 2 global Phase 3 studies (PSA3001 and 
PSA3002 (ongoing)).
Safety data from all subjects treated in the two global Phase 3 PsA studies, PSA3001 and PSA3002, were 
pooled and served as the primary analysis set for safety in this submission. Key presentations include 
safety data from the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies through the placebo-controlled period (Week 24) and 
through the safety data cutoff of 01 May 2019. Data from the Phase 2 study, PSA2001 were not pooled 
due to differences in dose regimens and study designs. 
Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs; including injection site and allergic reactions), clinical 
laboratory tests, physical examinations, vital signs, suicidal ideation or behavior (SIB; using the electronic 
Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale [eC-SSRS]), electrocardiogram (ECG; Week 0 only) findings, 
concomitant medication review, and early detection of tuberculosis.
To determine if the safety profile of guselkumab in subjects with PsA is comparable with the safety profile 
for guselkumab in subjects with psoriasis, AEs and clinical laboratory data through the placebo-controlled 
period for the pivotal Phase 3 studies in psoriasis (PSO3001 and PSO3002) were assessed alongside those 
from the pooled Phase 3 studies in PsA (PSA3001 and PSA3002) through the common placebo-controlled 
period (ie, Week 16) across all four studies and through the entire placebo-controlled period (ie, Week 
24) for the Phase 3 PsA studies.
Patient exposure
Through the data cut (01 May 2019), a total of 1,229 subjects with active PsA were exposed to 
guselkumab across the Phase 2 (PSA2001) and Phase 3 PsA studies (PSA3001 and PSA3002), including 
1,093 (88.9%) subjects treated for at least 6 months and 588 (47.8%) subjects treated for at least 1 
year.
In the Phase 2 PsA (PSA2001) safety analysis set, 129 subjects with active PsA were exposed to 
guselkumab, including 115 (89.1%) subjects treated for at least 6 months (87 and 28 subjects in the 
guselkumab q8w and placebo →guselkumab q8w groups, respectively), and 70 (54.3%) subjects treated 
for at least 1 year.
In the pooled Phase 3 PsA (PSA3001 and PSA3002) safety analysis set, through the data cut, 1,100 
subjects with active PsA were exposed to guselkumab, including 978 (88.9%) subjects treated for at least 
6 months (364 and 614 subjects in the guselkumab q8w and q4w combined groups, respectively), and 
518 (47.1%) subjects treated for at least 1 year (253 and 265 subjects in the guselkumab q8w and q4w 
combined groups, respectively). Through the data cut, 67.5% (253 of the 375) of subjects randomized to 
guselkumab q8w and 63.0% (235 of 373) of subjects randomized to guselkumab q4w were treated for at 
least 1 year.
Through Week 16, in PSO3001 and PSO3002, a total of 823 subjects with psoriasis were exposed to 
guselkumab.
Through Week 24, in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies, 42 (3.8%) subjects discontinued study agent, 
including 12 (3.2%) subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, 12 (3.2%) subjects in the 
guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, and 18 (4.8%) subjects in the placebo group. The most common reasons 
for discontinuation of study agent were AEs (1.6% [n=18]) and lack of efficacy (0.9% [n=10]).

For PSA3001 through the data cut, 30 (7.9%) subjects discontinued study agent, including 9 (7.1%) 
subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, 4 (3.1%) subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, 
5 (4.4%) subjects in the placebo→guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, and 12 (9.5%) subjects in the placebo 
group. The most common reasons for discontinuation of study agent were lack of efficacy (2.9% [n=11]) 
followed by AEs (2.4% [n=9]). 
For PSA3002 through the data cut, 51 (6.9%) subjects discontinued study agent, including 15 (6.0%) 
subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, 18 (7.3%) subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w 
group, 10 (4.2%) subjects in the placebo→guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, and 8 (3.3%) subjects in the 
placebo group. The most common reasons for discontinuation of study agent were AEs (2.6% [n=19]) 
and lack of efficacy (2.6% [n=19]). 
Through the data cut in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies, 81 (7.2%) subjects discontinued study agent, 
including 24 (6.4%) subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, 22 (5.9%) subjects in the 
guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, 15 (4.3%) subjects in the placebo→guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, and 
20 (5.4%) subjects in the placebo group. The most common reasons for discontinuation of study agent 
were lack of efficacy (2.7% [n=30]) followed by AEs (2.5% [n=28]).
The proportion of treated subjects in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies who had prior exposure to PsA 
medications was generally similar across all treatment groups. All subjects had prior exposure to 
medication and/or therapy for PsA and 91.1% had prior treatment with non-biologic DMARDs, 
immunosuppressives or apremilast; the majority of subjects received 1 treatment (59.8%) followed by 2 
treatments (23.9%), and ≥3 treatments (7.3%).
The proportions of treated subjects in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies who received non-biologic DMARDs, 
oral corticosteroids for PsA, or NSAIDs for PsA at baseline were well balanced across treatment groups. 
Among subjects receiving non-biologic DMARDs at baseline, the majority of subjects were receiving MTX.
Adverse events
 Study PSA2001
•
The proportions of subjects with 1 or more AEs were comparable between the placebo group and 
the guselkumab group through Week 16 (28.6% and 27.0%, respectively) and through Week 24 (32.7% 
and 36.0%, respectively). Through Week 56, the frequency of overall AEs in the guselkumab group did 
not increase disproportionally (ie, >2-fold) with >2-fold longer exposure of guselkumab compared to 
Week 24. Through Week 56, 17.2% of subjects in the placebo → guselkumab crossover group, 46.0% of 
subjects in the guselkumab, and 39.5% in the guselkumab combined group reported 1 or more AEs. 
•
Adverse events in the Infections and infestations SOC were most frequently reported throughout 
the study, and the proportions were comparable between the placebo group and the guselkumab group 
through Week 16 (18.4% and 14.0%, respectively) and through Week 24 (20.4% and 17.0%, 
respectively). Through Week 56, the frequency of Infections and infestations in the guselkumab group did 
not increase disproportionally (ie, >2 fold) with >2 fold longer exposure of guselkumab compared to 
Week 24. Through Week 56, 3.4% in the placebo → guselkumab crossover group, 27.0% of subjects in 
the guselkumab group, and 21.7% in the guselkumab combined group reported 1 or more AEs in the SOC 
of Infections and infestations.
•
The most common AE in both treatment groups was nasopharyngitis which was reported in 
10.2% of the subjects in the placebo group and 6.0% in the guselkumab group through Week 24, and 0 
in the placebo → guselkumab crossover group, 10.0% in the guselkumab group, and 7.8% in the

The concomitant use of MTX with guselkumab did not appear to have a large impact on the 
overall frequency of AEs or AE profiles through Weeks 16, 24, and 56.
Infections

The proportions of subjects who reported 1 or more infections (as assessed by the investigators) were 
comparable between the placebo group and the guselkumab group through Week 16 (18.4% and 
13.0%, respectively) and through Week 24 (20.4% and 16.0%, respectively). Through Week 56, the 
frequency of overall infections in the guselkumab group did not increase disproportionally (ie, 
>2-fold) with >2-fold longer exposure of guselkumab compared to Week 24. Through Week 56, 3.4% 
in the placebo → guselkumab crossover group, 26.0% of subjects in the guselkumab, and 20.9% in 
the guselkumab combined group reported 1 or more infections. 


Through Week 56, 1 (0.8%) subject in the guselkumab combined group reported serious infections of 
pneumonia.
No cases of TB or opportunistic infections were reported through Week 56.

56. 
Injection-site Reactions

Through Week 44, there was no ISR reported in the guselkumab group. 
Pooled Phase 3 Psoriatic Arthritis Studies
Through Week 24, the average duration of follow-up and the frequency of key safety events in the pooled 
Phase 3 PsA studies was similar across the guselkumab 100 mg q8w, guselkumab 100 mg q4w, and 
placebo groups except for ISRs which were more common in the guselkumab groups. In addition, the 
number of subjects with AEs, serious AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent, infections, and 
serious infections per 100 subject-years of follow-up in the guselkumab groups were generally

Note: Adverse events are coded using MedDRA Version 21.1. Subjects are counted only once for any given event, regardless of the 
number of times they actually experienced the event.
a: For subjects in all treatment groups who discontinued study treatment early with the last study treatment (placebo or guselkumab) 
administrated prior to Week 24 and who did not receive any study agent (placebo or guselkumab) at or after Week 24, all data including 
the final safety follow-up visit collected through data cut were included in this period.
b: For subjects in placebo group who changed treatment from placebo to guselkumab due to cross-over or inadvertently, only data prior 
to first administration of guselkumab were included in this group. Data on and after the first administration of guselkumab were not 
included in this group.

Any Adverse Events
The proportions of subjects reporting 1 or more AEs through Week 24 were similar in the guselkumab 
100 mg q8w, guselkumab 100 mg q4w, and placebo groups: 48.5%, 48.8%, and 47.3%, respectively. 
Infections and infestations was the SOC with the highest proportion of reported AEs in the guselkumab 
q8w (19.5%) and q4w (19.3%) groups, and the proportion was comparable in the placebo (19.9%) 
group. Other SOCs in which the proportions of subjects with AEs in either the guselkumab q8w or q4w 
groups were >10% were Investigations (q8w [13.6%], q4w [11.5%], and placebo [7.0%]) and 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (q8w [9.9%], q4w [10.2%], and placebo [12.6%]).

The most frequently reported AEs in subjects treated with guselkumab were ALT increased, 
nasopharyngitis, AST increased, and URTI. 

Alanine aminotransferase increased was reported in 6.1%, 7.5%, and 3.8% of subjects in the 
guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and placebo groups, respectively.
 Nasopharyngitis was reported in 6.9%, 5.1%, and 4.6% of subjects in the guselkumab q8w, 
guselkumab q4w, and placebo groups, respectively.

Aspartate aminotransferase increased was reported in 6.1%, 3.8%, and 2.4% of subjects in the 
guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and placebo groups, respectively.

 Upper respiratory tract infection was reported in 3.5%, 6.2%, and 4.6% of subjects in the 
guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and placebo groups, respectively.

For most AEs, the frequencies of AEs were comparable in the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and 
placebo groups. The most frequently reported AEs in subjects treated with guselkumab were alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) increased, nasopharyngitis, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, and 
upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). The following AEs were reported more frequently in the 
guselkumab groups compared with the placebo group (ie, in ≥1% of subjects in any guselkumab 
group and ≥2 times more frequently in the guselkumab combined group compared with the placebo 
group): AST increased, bronchitis, headache, respiratory tract infection, injection site erythema and 
oropharyngeal pain. Headache and injection site erythema were previously identified as ADRs and 
respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, and transaminases increased were identified as new ADRs for 
guselkumab. Upon further review, oropharyngeal pain is not considered a new ADR for guselkumab.

The following AEs were reported more frequently in the guselkumab q4w group compared with the 
q8w group (ie, in ≥1% of subjects in any guselkumab group and ≥2 times more frequently in the 
guselkumab q4w group compared with the guselkumab q8w group): neutrophil count decreased, 
hyperuricaemia, and hepatic steatosis. Neutrophil count decreased was identified as a new ADR for 
guselkumab. Upon further review, hyperuricaemia and hepatic steatosis are not considered new ADRs 
for guselkumab.

Through Week 24, the majority of AEs were of mild intensity (61.0%, 65.4%, and 55.1% of AEs 
reported in the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and placebo groups, respectively). The number of 
subjects reporting 1 or more AEs of severe intensity was low: 3 (0.8%) subjects in the guselkumab 
q8w group, 2 (0.5%) subjects in the guselkumab q4w group, and 6 (1.6%) subjects in the placebo 
group.

The safety profile of guselkumab through the data cut is similar to the safety profile of guselkumab 
through Week 24 and the frequency of individual AEs were generally comparable between the 
guselkumab q8w and q4w groups.
Through the data cut, the proportions of subjects reporting 1 or more AEs were similar across treatment 
groups; 64.8% in the guselkumab q8w group and 64.1% in the guselkumab q4w group. Infections and 
infestations was the SOC with the highest proportion of AEs in the guselkumab q8w (33.1%) and q4w 
(29.0%) groups. Other SOCs in which the proportions of subjects with AEs in either the guselkumab q8w 
or q4w groups were >10% were Investigations (q8w [17.1%] and q4w [15.8%]) and Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (q8w [14.7%] and q4w [13.7%]).

The most frequently reported AEs in subjects treated with guselkumab were nasopharyngitis, ALT 
increased, URTI, and AST increased. 
 Nasopharyngitis was reported in 10.9% of subjects in the guselkumab q8w group and 8.6% of 
subjects in the q4w group. 

Alanine aminotransferase increased was reported in 8.3% of subjects in the guselkumab q8w 
group and 10.2% of subjects in the q4w group.
 Upper respiratory tract infection was reported in 7.2% of subjects in the guselkumab q8w group 
and 7.8% of subjects in the q4w group.

Aspartate aminotransferase increased was reported in 7.5% of subjects in the guselkumab q8w 
group and 6.2% of subjects in the q4w group. 
As through Week 24, through the data cut there were no reports of new onset or exacerbation of 
inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis in guselkumab-treated 
subjects.
Through the data cut, the overall AE rates per 100 subject-years of follow-up were 211.92, 179.17, and 
175.39, for the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and guselkumab q4w combined groups, respectively. 
The SOC with the highest AE rates per 100 subject-years of follow-up was Infections and infestations; 
55.53, 47.69, and 48.72 for the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and guselkumab q4w combined 
groups, respectively. 
Through the data cut, the proportions of subjects with mild, moderate, or severe AEs, were generally 
similar in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups. The number of subjects reporting 1 or more AEs of 
severe intensity was low: 8 (2.1%) subjects in the guselkumab q8w group and 10 (2.7%) subjects in the 
guselkumab q4w group.
A greater frequency of decreases in neutrophil counts and WBC counts was observed with longer duration 
of exposure through 1 year. The proportions of subjects who experienced neutrophil count decreases of 
CTCAE Grade ≥1 were 12.9% and 11.6% in the guselkumab q8w and every 4 weeks (q4w) groups, 
respectively, and 10.2% in all guselkumab-treated subjects through 1 year. The proportions of subjects 
who experienced WBC count decreases of CTCAE Grade ≥1 were 10.5% and 10.3% in the guselkumab 
q8w and q4w groups, respectively, and 9.2% in all guselkumab-treated subjects through 1 year.  No 
Grade 3 or higher WBC count decrease was observed through 1 year. Grade ≥2 neutrophil count 
decreases and Grade 2 WBC count decreases in guselkumab-treated subjects were generally not 
associated with infections. Mean values for neutrophil counts and WBC counts in the guselkumab q8w and 
q4w groups did not further decrease from Week 24 through 1 year of treatment.
Through 1 year, most post-baseline increases in ALT and AST were Grade 1 and the proportions of 
subjects with Grade 1 or higher post-baseline increases in ALT were higher in the guselkumab q4w 
(46.9%) group compared with the q8w group (36.2%). The proportions of subjects with Grade 1 or

higher post-baseline increases in AST were also slightly higher in the guselkumab q4w (33.2%) group 
compared with the q8w group (26.3%). A greater frequency was observed with the longer duration of 
exposure through 1 year. 
AEs reported in the Hepatobiliary disorders SOC were comparable between the guselkumab q4w (3.5%) 
and q8w (2.7%) groups. The majority of AEs reported through 1 year were preferred terms (PTs) related 
to hepatic steatosis for both the q4w (2.7%) and q8w (1.3%) groups. Through 1 year, 3 subjects in the 
guselkumab q4w group reported PTs of Drug-induced liver injury (DILI), Hepatitis toxic, and 
Hepatocellular injury (one subject each) and causality was assessed as related to the concomitant anti-TB 
therapy in all 3 subjects. 
There were no events that satisfied the criteria for Hy’s Law in guselkumab-treated subjects through 1 
year.
In subjects with baseline MTX use, Grade 1 or higher increases in ALT were more frequent than in 
subjects without baseline MTX use.
A review of all postmarketing events reported with laboratory test results and/or with PTs relevant for 
liver injury did not identify any event of potential DILI attributed to guselkumab.
Infections
Through Week 24, the proportion of subjects reporting at least 1 AE categorized as an infection by the 
investigator was 19.5% in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, 21.4% in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w 
group, and 20.7% in the placebo group.
The most frequently reported AEs of infection through Week 24 were nasopharyngitis (6.9%, 5.1%, and 
4.6% in the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and placebo groups, respectively), URTI (3.5%, 6.2%, 
and 4.6% in the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and placebo groups, respectively), and bronchitis 
(1.6%, 2.9%, and 1.1% in the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and placebo groups, respectively). All 
other infections were reported in <2% of subjects in both of the guselkumab groups. 
Serious infections were reported in 1 subject in the guselkumab q8w group (pyrexia), 3 subjects in the 
guselkumab q4w group (acute hepatitis B, oophoritis, and pneumonia influenzal), and 3 subjects in the 
placebo group (pustular psoriasis, pneumonia bacterial, and URTI were reported in 1 subject, abscess 
limb infection was reported in 1 subject, and post-procedural fistula was reported in 1 subject). There 
was no increased risk of a serious infection in the guselkumab q8w, q4w, or combined (q8w and q4w) 
groups compared with the placebo group or in the guselkumab q4w group compared with the guselkumab 
q8w group.
Through Week 24, the overall AEs of infection rates per 100 subject-years of follow-up were 58.27, 
62.71, and 58.48, for the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and placebo groups, respectively. Through 
Week 24, the overall AEs of serious infections rates per 100 subject-years of follow-up were 0.58, 1.74, 
and 4.05 for the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and placebo groups, respectively.
Through the data cut, AEs of infections were reported at a frequency of 33.9% in the guselkumab 100 
mg q8w group and 31.1% in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group. The most frequently reported AEs of 
infection through the data cut were nasopharyngitis (10.9% and 8.6% in the guselkumab q8w and q4w 
groups, respectively), URTI (7.2% and 7.8% in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups, respectively), 
bronchitis (4.0% and 4.3% in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups, respectively), and viral URTI (2.4% 
and 1.3% in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups, respectively). All other infections were reported in 
<2% of subjects in both of the guselkumab groups.
Through the data cut, the overall AE of infection rates per 100 subject-years of follow-up were 57.94, 
52.81, 53.15 for the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and guselkumab q4w combined groups. Through 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 133/179
 
 
the data cut, the overall AEs of serious infections rates per 100 subject-years of follow-up were 1.61, 
1.08, and 1.77 for the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and guselkumab q4w combined groups, 
respectively.
No cases of active TB, opportunistic infections, or candida infections were reported through the data cut 
in PSA3001 and PSA3002.
Injection-site Reactions
Through Week 24, the number of subjects that reported 1 or more ISRs was low and slightly higher in 
the guselkumab groups than in the placebo group; 5 (1.3%) subjects in the guselkumab q8w group, 
4 (1.1%) subjects in the guselkumab q4w group, and 1 (0.3%) subject in the placebo group. The most 
frequently reported ISR was injection site erythema. 
Through Week 24, there were no serious ISRs. All subjects who reported guselkumab ISRs reported ISRs 
of mild intensity with the exception of 1 subject in the guselkumab q4w group who reported 3 ISRs of 
moderate intensity. This subject discontinued study agent after the first dose due to injection site 
erythema, injection site swelling, and injection site warmth. 
Through the data cut, the number of subjects that reported 1 or more ISRs was low and generally 
similar across the treatment groups; 8 (2.1%) subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group and 11 
(2.9%) subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group. The most frequently reported ISR was injection 
site erythema.
Through the data cut, there were no serious ISRs. All subjects with guselkumab ISRs reported ISRs of 
mild intensity with the exception of 3 subjects in the guselkumab q4w group who reported ISRs of 
moderate intensity. Through the data cut, 2 of these subjects with ISRs of moderate intensity 
discontinued study agent due to ISRs; 1 subject discontinued study agent prior to Week 24 and an 
additional subject in the guselkumab group q4w group discontinued study agent after Week 24 and 
through the data cut, due to 2 ISRs of moderate intensity, injection site erythema and injection site rash.
Malignancies
Through Week 24, malignancies were reported in 2 (0.5%) subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w 
group (plasma cell myeloma [reported 15 days after the first study agent administration] and malignant 
melanoma in situ [reported 41 days after the first study agent administration]) and 1 subject in the 
placebo group (clear cell renal cell carcinoma. In the subject who reported plasma cell myeloma, clinical 
laboratory analysis of a serum sample collected prior to the first administration of guselkumab indicated 
an elevated level of gamma globulin and M protein, excess free kappa light chain production, and a 
marked abnormal kappa/lambda ratio. The subject diagnosed with malignant melanoma in situ had a 
history of the skin lesion for 1 year prior to biopsy and diagnosis and was receiving MTX at baseline. 
There were no reports of NMSC.
Through the data cut, in addition to the malignancies described through Week 24, squamous cell 
carcinoma in situ and malignant melanoma in situ were reported in 1 subject in the placebo→guselkumab 
100 mg q4w group. This >65 year-old subject with a history of actinic keratoses and in situ squamous 
cell carcinoma 3 months prior to enrollment and a maternal history of 2 lesions of malignant melanoma 
was diagnosed through biopsy at a routine skin check. 
The numbers of subjects reporting malignancies through the data cut were as follows:
 All malignancies:
 Guselkumab q8w: 0.54/100 subject-years of follow-up (95% CI: 0.07, 1.94) 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 134/179
 
 
 Guselkumab q4w: 0.00/100 subject-years of follow-up (95% CI: 0.00, 0.81) 
 Guselkumab q4w combined: 0.18/100 subject-years of follow-up (95% CI: 0.00, 0.99) 
 NMSC: 
 Guselkumab q8w: 0.00/100 subject-years of follow-up (95% CI: 0.00, 0.80)
 Guselkumab q4w: 0.00/100 subject-years of follow-up (95% CI: 0.00, 0.81) 
 Guselkumab q4w combined: 0.18/100 subject-years of follow-up (95% CI: 0.00, 0.99)
 Malignancies other than NMSC: 
 Guselkumab q8w: 0.54/100 subject-years of follow-up (95% CI: 0.07, 1.94) 
 Guselkumab q4w: 0.00/100 subject-years of follow-up (95% CI: 0.00, 0.81) 
 Guselkumab q4w combined: 0.18/100 subject-years of follow-up (95% CI: 0.00, 0.99) 
Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events
Through Week 24 of the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies, 1 MACE (ie, nonfatal ischemic stroke) was reported 
in a subject in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group and 1 MACE (ie, fatal cardiac failure) was reported in a 
subject in the placebo group. There were no additional reports of MACE reported after Week 24 and 
through the data cut. 
Suicidal Ideation and Behaviors
Through Week 24, 4 subjects reported eC-SSRS level 1 suicidal ideation of “wish to be dead”; 1 subject 
in each of the guselkumab groups and 2 subjects in the placebo group. Through the data cut, an 
additional 4 subjects (2 subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, 1 subject in the guselkumab 100 
mg q4w group, and 1 subject in the placebo→guselkumab 100 mg q4w group), reported eC-SSRS level 1 
suicidal ideation of “wish to be dead”. There were no abnormal eC-SSRS findings for events of suicidal 
behavior or self-injurious behavior without suicidal intent. Two of the 6 reports of abnormal eC SSRS 
scores in guselkumab-treated subjects were also reported as AEs. A history of suicidal ideation was 
reported before screening for 2 of the 6 guselkumab-treated subjects. A history of depression or other 
social or economic contributing factors (e.g., loss of employment) was noted in 4 of the 6 guselkumab-
treated subjects. 
Through Week 24, the number of subjects reporting SIB or self-injurious behavior without suicidal intent 
was 0.58/100 subject-years of follow-up for both the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups and 1.16/100 
subject-years of follow-up for the placebo group. Through the data cut, there was no evidence for an 
increase in the follow-up adjusted number of subjects reporting SIB over time and the follow-up adjusted 
number of subjects reporting SIB in both the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups remained lower than the 
placebo group through Week 24. No subjects discontinued study agent due to SIB.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events
Study PSA2001
•
•
No deaths occurred in the study through Week 56. 
Through Week 24, 1 (2.0%) subject in the placebo group reported an SAE of joint injury and 1 
(1.0%) subject in the guselkumab group reported a SAE of MI. After Week 24, 5 additional SAEs 
(osteoarthritis, unequal pupils, radius fracture, pneumonia, and ulcerative keratitis) were reported in the 
guselkumab group. Through Week 56, 6.0% of the guselkumab group (4.7% of the guselkumab 
combined group) reported 1 or more SAEs. All events were singular in nature and there was no evident 
pattern observed.
Pooled Phase 3 Psoriatic Arthritis Studies
Deaths
In PSA3001 through Week 24 cardiac failure leading to death on Study Day 166 was reported in a subject 
in the placebo group who did not receive any guselkumab prior to death. Additionally, through the data 
cut pneumonia leading to a death was reported in a subject in the placebo group who did not receive any 
guselkumab. In PSA3002, no deaths were reported.
Other Serious Adverse Events
Through Week 24, SAEs were reported in 7 (1.9%), 8 (2.1%), and 12 (3.2%) subjects in the 
guselkumab 100 mg q8w, guselkumab 100 mg q4w, and placebo groups, respectively. There was no 
increased risk of a SAE in the guselkumab q8w, q4w, or combined groups compared with the placebo 
group or in the guselkumab q4w group compared with the guselkumab q8w group.
•
Infections and infestations was the SOC in which the highest proportions of subjects reported 
SAEs; 0, 3 (0.8%), and 2 (0.5%) subjects in the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and placebo groups, 
respectively.
•
•
All individual SAEs were reported in single subjects treated with guselkumab.
No specific pattern of SAEs was identified.
Through Week 24, the overall SAE rates per 100 subject-years of follow-up were low and comparable 
across the treatment groups; 4.04, 5.23, and 9.26 for the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and 
placebo groups, respectively.  The SOC with the highest SAE rates was Infections and infestations with 
similar rates per 100 subject years of follow-up for the guselkumab q8w (0), guselkumab q4w (1.74), and 
placebo (2.89) groups.
Through the data cut, SAEs were reported at a frequency of 5.3% in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w 
group and 4.8% in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group. There was no increased risk of an SAE in the 
guselkumab q4w group compared with the guselkumab q8w group. 
•
Infections and infestations was the SOC in which the highest proportions of subjects reported 
SAEs; 4 (1.1%) subjects in the guselkumab q8w group and 4 (1.1%) subjects in the guselkumab q4w 
group.
•
All individual SAEs were reported in single subjects in either the guselkumab q8w or the 
guselkumab q4w group, except for foot deformity and pulmonary embolism both of which were reported 
in 2 subjects in the guselkumab q4w group.

•
No specific pattern of SAEs was identified.
The event rates (per 100 subject-years of follow-up) for SAEs in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups 
through the data cut were consistent with those in the same groups through Week 24. Through the data 
cut, the overall SAE rates per 100 subject-years of follow-up were similar for the guselkumab q8w (5.90) 
and q4w (5.12) groups, as well as for the combined guselkumab q4w group (6.55). The SOC with the 
highest SAE rates was Infections and infestations with similar rates per 100 subject-years of follow-up for 
the guselkumab q8w (1.34), guselkumab q4w (1.08), and the guselkumab q4w combined (1.59) groups. 
SAEs listed in PSA3001
In the Guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, SAEs included cervical dysplasia, adhesion ileus, cellulitis left 
hand, multiple myeloma, supraventricular arrhythmia, hand fracture, right renal colic, acute bronchitis 
with bronchospasm. In the Guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, SAEs included foot deformity, worsening of 
breast enlargement and iliofemoral venous thrombosis. All outcomes were reported as recovered with the 
exception of the subjects with multiple myeloma and iliofemoral venous thrombosis, the drug was 
withdrawn from the subject with multiple myeloma. Cervical dysplasia and cellulitis were reported as 
possibly related to the study drug and all other SAEs were assessed by the investigator as 
unrelated/doubtful related to the study drug. In the Placebo to Guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, SAEs 
included head injury due to motor vehicle accident, atrial fibrillation and left-sided pyelonephritis which 
were all assessed by the investigator as unrelated to the study drug, the outcomes reported as 
recovered.

obesity, pyrexia of probable urinary origin, endometriosis, urolithiasis, exacerbation of psoriatic 
arthropathy, ankle fracture, unstable angina and diverticulitis in the same subject, coronary artery 
disease, pancreatitis, cholecystitis and post cholecystectomy syndrome in the same subject. Cystitis and 
pneumonia in the same subject were assessed by the investigator as possibly related to the study drug, 
Pyrexia of probable urinary origin was assessed as having a probable relation to the study drug otherwise 
the remaining SAEs were reported as unrelated or doubtful related. The outcomes of all possibly related 
SAEs were reported as recovered/resolved. 
In the Guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, SAEs included Influenza B pneumonia, umbilical hernia, blue toe 
syndrome, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, Rupture of the biceps brachii muscle, ischaemic stroke,

Laboratory findings
Hematology
Study PSA2001
•
A numerical trend of greater reduction in mean change from baseline in WBC and neutrophil 
counts in the guselkumab group compared to placebo was observed over time through Week 24. At Week 
24, the mean change from baseline for WBC count was -0.755 x 109/L for the guselkumab group and 
0.188 x 109/L for the placebo group and the mean change from baseline for neutrophil count was -0.860 
x 109/L for the guselkumab group and 0.038 x 109/L for the placebo group. After Week 24, the numerical 
trend was also observed in the placebo → guselkumab crossover group. A shift in neutrophil count from 
within normal reference range to below normal reference range was more frequently observed in the 
guselkumab group (15.7%) compared with the placebo group (4.3%) through Week 24.  Neutrophil count 
decreases meeting NCI-CTCAE Grade 2 or 3 were infrequent through Week 24, occurring in 3 (3.0%) 
subjects and 1 (1.0%) subject, respectively, in the guselkumab group. Neutrophil count decreases 
meeting NCI-CTCAE Grade 2 or 3 were also infrequent through Week 56, occurring in 3 (2.3%) subjects 
and 1 (0.8%) subject, respectively, in the combined guselkumab group. The majority of cases of 
neutrophil count decrease were transient and reversible, resolved spontaneously without treatment and 
were not associated with infections, and did not result in discontinuation of study agent or study, except 
for 1 subject.
•
A numerical trend of greater reduction in mean change from baseline in platelets in the 
guselkumab group compared to placebo was observed over time through Week 24. At Week 24, the 
mean change from baseline for platelet count was -17.7 x 109/L for the guselkumab group and 4.8 x 
109/L for the placebo group. After Week 24, the numerical trend was also observed in the placebo → 
guselkumab crossover group. Through Week 24, a total of 2 (1.7%) subjects in the combined 
guselkumab group had a shift in platelets to below normal reference range. In both subjects, the 
decrease in platelets occurred before Week 16 and was transient and reversible. Through Week 56, 1 
additional subject in the placebo → guselkumab crossover group, shifted from within normal reference 
range to below normal reference range. Of the 3 cases, none met NCI-CTCAE Grade 2 or more.
•
Through Week 24 and through Week 56, no consistent, potentially clinically meaningful 
differences or trends were observed between guselkumab and placebo on other hematology parameters.
Pooled Phase 3 Psoriatic Arthritis Studies
Through Week 24, there were no clinically important trends observed in changes from baseline between 
the guselkumab and placebo groups for hemoglobin or lymphocytes. 
Changes from baseline through Week 24 in neutrophil, WBC, and platelet counts are described below.

Neutrophils
Through Week 24, the proportion of subjects with a Grade 1 or higher post-baseline decrease in 
neutrophil count was slightly higher in the guselkumab q8w (7.2%) and q4w (7.8%) groups compared 
with the placebo group (4.3%) and most post-baseline decreases in neutrophil counts were Grade 1. 
Grade 2 or higher decreases in neutrophil counts were reported in few subjects treated with guselkumab 
(13 [1.7%] subjects) in the combined guselkumab group) and slightly more frequently in subjects in the 
guselkumab 100 mg q8w (1.6%) and 100 mg q4w (1.9%) groups compared with the placebo group 
(1.1%). Among guselkumab-treated subjects, there were no Grade 3 decreases in neutrophil counts. 
There was 1 Grade 4 decrease in neutrophil count in a subject in the guselkumab q4w group with 
concomitant etoricoxib treatment; a neutrophil count of 0.47 x 109/L was reported at the Week 8 visit. A 
retest performed 6 days later showed the neutrophil count had returned to within normal limits (2.59 
×109/L). The subject had other Grade 2 or higher neutrophil counts decreased (Grade 2: 1.03 ×1 09/L at 
Week 4 and Grade 3: 0.64×109/L at Week 12) that returned to normal limits when retests were 
performed prior to the next dosing visit and the study agent was not interrupted. The Grade 1 or higher 
decreases in neutrophil counts were comparable in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups, generally 
resolved spontaneously without treatment, and were not associated with study agent interruption or 
discontinuation.
Through Week 24, among subjects with a Grade 2 or higher decrease in neutrophil count, no serious 
infections were reported and a single case of a nonserious viral URTI infection was reported in a 
guselkumab-treated subject. 
A numerical trend of a greater mean reduction from baseline in neutrophil counts in the guselkumab 
groups compared with the placebo group was observed through Week 24. At Week 24, the mean change 
from baseline in neutrophil count was -0.7 x 109/L in the guselkumab q8w group and -0.6 x 109/L in the 
guselkumab q4w group compared with -0.2 x 109/L in the placebo group. 
From baseline to Week 24, a shift in neutrophil count from within the normal range to below the normal 
range was reported in a greater proportion of subjects in the guselkumab groups (2.2% for q8w and 
2.8% for q4w) compared with the placebo group (0.7%).
Through Week 24, guselkumab had no consistent effect on neutrophil count decreases across age and 
BMI subgroups. Among subjects using MTX at baseline, Grade 2 or higher decreases in neutrophil counts 
were reported more frequently in the guselkumab q8w (2.9%) and guselkumab q4w (1.9%) groups 
compared with the placebo group (0.9%). Among subjects using no non-biologic DMARDs at baseline, 
Grade 2 or higher decreases in neutrophil counts were 0, 2.5%, and 1.7% in the guselkumab q8w, 
guselkumab q4w, and placebo groups, respectively. Guselkumab had no consistent effect on neutrophil 
count decreases across subgroups with or without baseline use of oral corticosteroids or latent TB 
treatment.
WBCs
Through Week 24, the proportion of subjects with a Grade 1 or higher post-baseline decreases in WBC 
counts was slightly higher in the guselkumab q8w (8.0%) and q4w (6.7%) groups compared with the 
placebo group (3.5%) and most post-baseline decreases in WBC counts were Grade 1. Grade 2 decreases 
in WBC counts were reported in few subjects treated with guselkumab (1.5% in the combined 
guselkumab group) and slightly more frequently in subjects in the guselkumab q8w (1.1%) and 
guselkumab q4w (1.9%) groups compared with the placebo group (0.8%). There were no Grade 3 or 4 
decreases in WBC counts. The Grade 1 or higher decreases in WBC counts were comparable in the 
guselkumab q8w and q4w groups, generally resolved spontaneously without additional treatment, were 
not associated with study agent interruption or discontinuation. The decreases in WBC counts were 
primarily due to decreases in neutrophil counts.

A numerical trend of a greater mean reduction from baseline in WBC counts in the guselkumab groups 
compared with the placebo group was observed through Week 24. At Week 24, the mean change from 
baseline in WBC count was -0.7 x 109/L in the guselkumab q8w group, -0.6 x 109/L in the guselkumab 
q4w group, and -0.2 x 109/L in the placebo group. 
Through Week 24, guselkumab had no consistent effect on WBC count decreases across age and BMI 
subgroups. As observed with neutrophil counts, among subjects using MTX at baseline, Grade 2 or higher 
decreases in WBC counts were reported more frequently in the guselkumab q8w (1.9%) and guselkumab 
q4w (2.3%) groups compared with the placebo group (0.9%). Among subjects using no non-biologic 
DMARDs at baseline, Grade 2 or higher decreases in WBC counts were 0, 1.7%, and 0.8% in the 
guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and placebo groups, respectively. Guselkumab had no consistent 
effect on WBC count decreases across subgroups with or without baseline use of oral corticosteroids or 
latent TB treatment.
Platelets
Through Week 24, the proportions of subjects with Grade 1 or higher decreases in platelet counts were 
low and comparable across each of the guselkumab q8w (2.6%) and q4w (1.6%) groups and the placebo 
group (1.6%) as well as between the guselkumab q4w and guselkumab q8w groups. Most decreases in 
platelets were Grade 1. Grade 2 decreases in platelet counts were infrequent (2 subjects in the 
guselkumab q8w group) and there were no Grade 3 or 4 decreases in platelet counts. The Grade 1 or 
higher decreases in platelet counts were transient, resolved spontaneously without treatment, did not 
lead to study agent interruption or discontinuation, and were not associated with bleeding events.
A numerical trend of a greater mean reduction from baseline in platelets in the guselkumab groups 
compared with the placebo group was observed through Week 24. At Week 24, the mean change in 
platelet count from baseline was -21.7 x 109/L in the guselkumab q8w group, -21.0 x 109/L in the 
guselkumab q4w group, and -3.4 x 109/L in the placebo group. 
Through Week 24, guselkumab had no consistent effect on platelet count decreases across age, BMI, and 
baseline medication use subgroups.

Through the data cut, there were no clinically important trends observed in change from baseline for 
hemoglobin or lymphocytes. 
Neutrophils
As through Week 24, through the data cut, the proportion of subjects reporting a decrease in neutrophil 
counts was low and most post-baseline decreases in neutrophil counts were Grade 1. The proportions of 
subjects who reported Grade 1 or greater decreases in neutrophil counts were comparable in the 
guselkumab q8w and guselkumab q4w groups. As through Week 24, decreases in neutrophil counts 
generally resolved spontaneously without additional treatment, and were not associated with study agent 
interruption or discontinuation. Compared with through Week 24, through the data cut, there was no 
disproportional increase in the proportions of subjects reporting a decrease in neutrophil counts.
Among guselkumab-treated subjects with a Grade 2 or higher decrease in neutrophil count there were no 
serious infections and few nonserious infections were reported.

Among all guselkumab-treated subjects, at most timepoints through the data cut, the mean change from 
baseline in neutrophil count was -0.4 to -0.7 x 109/L; the mean decrease was slightly greater at later 
timepoints (ie, Week 68 and later) that included fewer subjects. The mean change from baseline in 
neutrophil count was similar in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups through the data cut.
Through the data cut, guselkumab had no consistent effect on neutrophil count decreases across age and 
BMI subgroups. Among subjects not using non-biologic DMARDs, Grade 2 or higher decreases in 
neutrophil counts were reported in 0.8% of subjects in the guselkumab q8w group and 4.1% of subjects 
in the guselkumab q4w group while in subjects using MTX, Grade 2 or higher decreases in neutrophil 
counts were reported in 4.4% of subjects in the guselkumab q8w group and 4.7% of subjects in the 
guselkumab q4w group. Guselkumab had no consistent effect on neutrophil count decreases across 
subjects with or without baseline use of oral corticosteroids or latent TB treatment.
WBCs
As through Week 24, through the data cut, the proportion of subjects reporting a decrease in WBC counts 
was low and most post-baseline decreases in WBC counts were Grade 1. The proportions of subjects who 
reported Grade 1 and 2 decreases in WBC counts were comparable in the guselkumab q8w and 
guselkumab q4w groups and no subjects reported Grade 3 or 4 decreases in WBC counts. As through 
Week 24, the decreases in WBC counts generally resolved spontaneously without additional treatment, 
were not associated with study agent interruption or discontinuation, and were primarily due to decreases 
in neutrophil counts. 
Among all guselkumab-treated subjects, at most timepoints through the data cut the mean change from 
baseline in WBC count was -0.3 to 0.7 x 109/L; the mean decrease was slightly greater at later timepoints 
(ie, Week 68 and later) that included fewer subjects. The mean change from baseline in WBC count was 
similar in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups through the data cut.
Through the data cut, guselkumab had no consistent effect on WBC count decreases across age and BMI 
subgroups. Among subjects not using non-biologic DMARDs, Grade 2 or higher decreases in WBC counts 
were reported in 0.8% of subjects in the guselkumab q8w group and 2.5% of subjects in the guselkumab 
q4w group while in subjects using MTX, Grade 2 or higher decreases in WBC counts were reported in 
2.9% of subjects in the guselkumab q8w and 2.8% of subjects in the guselkumab q4w groups. 
Guselkumab had no consistent effect on WBC count decreases across subjects with or without baseline 
use of oral corticosteroids or latent TB treatment.
Platelets
The proportions of subjects with decreases in platelet counts through the data cut, as through Week 24, 
were low and comparable across all treatment groups. As through Week 24, through the data cut, the 
majority of the decreases in platelet counts were Grade 1 and there were few Grade 2 decreases in 
platelet counts. After Week 24 and through the data cut, a Grade 3 decrease in platelet counts was 
observed in 1 subject in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group. This subject had Grade 1 thrombocytopenia 
at baseline and was then observed to have transient decreases in platelet counts at Weeks 20 and 28 
which returned to baseline upon repeat testing prior to the next dosing visit without interruption of 
dosing. As through Week 24, the decreases in platelet counts recovered spontaneously without treatment 
and were not associated with study agent interruption or discontinuation. No bleeding events were 
reported in subjects with decreased platelet counts.
Among all guselkumab-treated subjects, at most timepoints through the data cut the mean decrease from 
baseline in platelet count was <25 x 109/L; the mean decrease was slightly greater at later timepoints 
(ie, Week 84 and later) that included fewer subjects. The mean change from baseline in platelet count 
was similar in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups through the data cut.

Across Psoriatic Arthritis and Psoriasis
In the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies,  through Week 16, the proportion of subjects with a Grade 2 or higher 
post-baseline decrease in neutrophil count was comparable across treatment groups; 1.1%, 1.6%, and 
1.1% for the guselkumab 100 mg q8w, guselkumab 100 mg q4w, and placebo groups, respectively; 
through Week 24, the proportion of subjects with a Grade 2 or higher post-baseline decrease in 
neutrophil count was slightly higher in the guselkumab groups than the placebo group. Through Week 16 
in the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies, the proportion of subjects with a Grade 2 or higher post-
baseline decrease in neutrophil count was comparable between the guselkumab 100 mg sq8w group 
(0.7%) and the placebo group (0.7%). 
Through Week 16 in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies, the proportion of subjects with a Grade 2 or higher 
post-baseline decrease in WBC count was higher in the guselkumab q4w group (1.9%) compared with the 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

guselkumab q8w (0.8%) and placebo (0.5%) groups. Through Week 16 in the pooled PSO3001 and 
PSO3002 studies, 0.4% of subjects in the guselkumab q8w group and no subjects in the placebo group 
had a Grade 2 or higher post-baseline decrease in WBC count. 
Through Week 16 in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies, no subjects had Grade 2 or greater decreases in 
platelet counts. Through Week 16 in the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies, Grade 2 decreases in 
platelet counts were reported in 1 (0.1%) subject in the guselkumab q8w group and 1 (0.2%) subject in 
the placebo group and there were no Grade 3 or 4 platelet count decreases.
A greater frequency of decreases in neutrophil counts and WBC counts was observed with longer 
duration of exposure through 1 year. The proportions of subjects who experienced neutrophil count 
decreases of CTCAE Grade ≥1 were 12.9% and 11.6% in the guselkumab q8w and every 4 weeks (q4w) 
groups, respectively, and 10.2% in all guselkumab-treated subjects through 1 year. The proportions of 
subjects who experienced WBC count decreases of CTCAE Grade ≥1 were 10.5% and 10.3% in the 
guselkumab q8w and q4w groups, respectively, and 9.2% in all guselkumab-treated subjects through 1 
year.  No Grade 3 or higher WBC count decrease was observed through 1 year. Grade ≥2 neutrophil count 
decreases and Grade 2 WBC count decreases in guselkumab-treated subjects were generally not 
associated with infections. Mean values for neutrophil counts and WBC counts in the guselkumab q8w and 
q4w groups did not further decrease from Week 24 through 1 year of treatment.
Compared to the proportion of subjects with a shift in platelet count from within/above reference range 
at baseline to below reference range post baseline in the placebo-controlled period, as expected, a 
greater proportion of subjects with shifts was observed with longer duration of exposure through 1 year. 
The proportions of subjects with a shift in platelet count from within/above reference range at baseline to 
below reference range post baseline in the placebo-controlled period or through 1 year were 1.9% and 
3.0% in the q8w group, and 1.6% and 3.0% in the q4w group, respectively. There was no further 
decrease of mean platelet counts from Week 24 through 1 year. Mean platelet counts appeared to plateau 
12 to 16 weeks after first treatment of guselkumab at Week 0.
Chemistry
Study PSA2001

Through Week 24 and through Week 56, no consistent, potentially clinically meaningful differences or 
trends were observed to suggest an effect of guselkumab on any of the chemistry laboratory 
parameters evaluated, including fasting glucose and fasting lipids (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and 
triglycerides). Abnormal chemistry laboratory values with the NCI-CTCAE toxicity grade ≥2 were 
infrequent through Week 56 in the guselkumab-treated subjects.

The mean change from baseline in ALT at Week 24 was 1.8 U/L in the guselkumab group and -0.4 
U/L in the placebo group and at Week 56 the mean change from baseline was 3.2 U/L in the 
guselkumab group.



The mean change from baseline in AST at Week 24 was 1.3 U/L in the guselkumab group and 1.0 U/L 
in the placebo group and at Week 56 the mean change from baseline was 2.3 U/L in the guselkumab 
group.
Through Week 24, a Grade 2 or higher increase in ALT was reported 1 (2.0%) subject in the placebo 
group. Through Week 56, a Grade 2 or higher increase in ALT was reported in 4 (4.0%) subjects in 
the guselkumab group and 1 (2.0%) subject in the placebo group.
Through Week 24, a Grade 2 or higher increase in AST was reported 3 (3.0%) subjects in the placebo 
group. Through Week 56, a Grade 2 or higher increase in AST was reported in 4 (4.0%) subjects in 
the guselkumab group, 1 (3.6%) subject who crossed over from placebo to guselkumab, and no 
subjects in the placebo group.

Pooled Phase 3 Psoriatic Arthritis Studies
Through Week 24, there were no clinically important trends observed in change from baseline for alkaline 
phosphatase, bilirubin, creatinine, glucose, potassium, sodium, albumin, and urate. 
Increases in ALT and AST through Week 24 are discussed below.
Increased ALT and AST
Through Week 24, the proportions of subjects with Grade 1 or higher post-baseline increases in ALT 
were slightly higher in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w (38.8%) group compared with the guselkumab 100 
mg q8w (30.1%) and placebo (32.3%) groups. The proportions of subjects with Grade 1 or higher post-
baseline increases in AST were also slightly higher in the guselkumab q4w (24.8%) group compared with 
the guselkumab q8w (20.9%) and placebo (21.7%) groups. Most post-baseline increases in ALT and AST 
were Grade 1. The Grade 1 or higher increases in ALT and AST were generally transient, mostly less than 
2 times the upper limit of normal, did not result in study agent interruption or discontinuation, and were 
not associated with clinically significant increases in bilirubin.     
Grade 2 or higher increases in ALT and AST occurred infrequently through Week 24. Grade 2 or higher 
increases in ALT were reported slightly more frequently in the guselkumab q4w (3.8%) group compared 
with the guselkumab q8w (1.9%) and placebo (2.1%) groups. Grade 2 or higher increases in AST were 
reported slightly more frequently in the guselkumab q8w (2.1%) and guselkumab q4w (3.2%) groups 
compared with the placebo (1.6%) group and slightly more frequently in the guselkumab q4w group 
compared with the guselkumab q8w group. Grade 2 or higher increases in ALT or AST were generally 
transient, not associated with clinically significant increases in bilirubin, and did not result in study agent 
interruption or discontinuation, except in 3 subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group in PSA3002. In 
1 of these subjects, who had a history of alcohol use and MTX use at baseline, study agent was 
interrupted due to the AEs of AST increased, ALT increased, cholecystitis chronic, chronic pancreatitis, 
and fatty liver; this subject was discontinued after the Week 24 visit. In the other 2 subjects, the study 
agent was discontinued due to an AE of drug-induced liver injury (drug [isoniazid]- induced hepatitis) in 1 
subject and an SAE of acute hepatitis B in 1 subject. 
Evaluations of individual cases with Grade 2 or higher elevations in ALT or AST indicated that there were 
no apparent patterns with regard to timing of onset and duration of elevations, most events were 
transient and resolved without interruption of study agent, and most subjects had confounding 
concomitant medications, alcohol use, and or medical conditions.
At Week 24, the mean change from baseline in ALT was 3.5 U/L in the guselkumab q8w group, 2.9 U/L in 
the guselkumab q4w group, and 0.8 U/L in the placebo group. At Week 24, the mean change from 
baseline in AST was 3.7 U/L in the guselkumab q8w group, 2.4 U/L in the guselkumab q4w group, and 
1.4 U/L in the placebo group.
In general, through Week 24, guselkumab had no consistent effect on ALT and AST increases across age 
and BMI subgroups.
Through Week 24, across all treatment groups, Grade 2 or higher increases in ALT were generally 
reported more frequently in subjects using MTX at baseline than in subjects not using non-biologic 
DMARDs at baseline. In subjects with baseline use of MTX, Grade 2 or higher increases in ALT were 
reported slightly more frequently in subjects in the guselkumab q4w group (4.2%) compared with the 
guselkumab q8w (2.4%) and placebo (2.7%) groups. 
Through Week 24, in subjects with baseline use of MTX, Grade 2 or higher increases in AST were reported 
slightly more frequently in subjects in the guselkumab q8w (1.9%) and guselkumab q4w (2.8%) groups 
compared with the placebo (0.9%) group.

Through Week 24, in the small number of subjects with baseline use of oral corticosteroids, Grade 2 or 
higher increases in ALT and AST increases were reported in a slightly higher proportion of subjects in the 
guselkumab combined (q8w and q4w) group compared with the placebo group. 
Through Week 24, in subjects without baseline use of latent TB treatment, Grade 2 or higher increases in 
ALT and AST increases were reported in a slightly higher proportion of subjects in the guselkumab 
combined (q8w and q4w) group compared with the placebo group. This trend was not observed in the 
small number of subjects with baseline use of latent TB treatment.

Through the data cut, there were no clinically important trends observed in change from baseline for 
alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, creatinine, glucose, potassium, sodium, urate, and albumin.
Increased ALT and AST
Through the data cut, most increases in ALT and AST were Grade 1. The frequencies of Grade 1 and 
higher increases in ALT and AST were slightly higher in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group compared 
with the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group. The frequencies of Grade 2 and higher increases in ALT and AST 
were also slightly higher in the guselkumab q4w group compared with the q8w group. Increases in ALT or 
AST were generally transient and did not result in study agent interruption or discontinuation, apart from 
what was described through Week 24.

Among all guselkumab-treated subjects, the mean change from baseline in ALT was generally an increase 
of approximately 1 to 3 U/L at all timepoints through the data cut; the mean increase was slightly greater 
at later timepoints (ie, Week 68 and later) that included fewer subjects at all timepoints through the data 
cut. Among all guselkumab-treated subjects, the mean change from baseline in AST was generally an 
increase of approximately 1.5 to 3.5 U/L at all timepoints through the data cut; the mean increase was 
slightly greater at later timepoints (ie, Week 76 and later) that included fewer subjects.
Through the data cut, guselkumab had no consistent effect on ALT and AST increases across age and BMI 
subgroups.
As through Week 24, increases in ALT and AST were generally reported more frequently in subjects 
treated with MTX at baseline than in subjects who did not use non-biologic DMARDs at baseline. In 
subjects with baseline use of MTX, Grade 2 or greater increases in ALT and AST were reported more 
frequently in the guselkumab q4w group (5.1% and 4.6%, respectively) compared with the q8w group 
(3.8% and 3.4%, respectively). In subjects who did not use non-biologic DMARDs at baseline, Grade 2 or 
greater increases in ALT were reported more frequently in the guselkumab q4w group (4.1%) compared 
with the q8w group (2.5%) and Grade 2 or greater increases in AST were similar between the 
guselkumab q8w (4.9%) and q4w (4.1%) groups.
Through the data cut, ALT and AST increases of Grade 2 or higher were reported in a slightly higher 
proportion of subjects in the guselkumab q4w group compared with q8w group in both subjects with and 
without baseline use of oral corticosteroids as well as subjects with and without baseline use of latent TB 
treatment.

Across Psoriatic Arthritis and Psoriasis
Through Week 16 in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies, as well as through Week 16 in the pooled PSO3001 
and PSO3002 studies, abnormal post-baseline chemistry laboratory values with CTCAE toxicity Grade ≥2 
were infrequent and except for ALT and AST in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies the rates were generally 
comparable across the treatment groups. 
In the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies, through Week 16, the proportions of subjects with a Grade 2 or higher 
post-baseline increases in ALT was slightly higher in the guselkumab q4w group (2.4%) compared with 
the guselkumab q8w (1.1%), and placebo (1.6%) groups, this is consistent with data through Week 24. 
In the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies, through Week 16, Grade 2 or higher post-baseline 
increases in ALT were similar in the guselkumab q8w (1.6%) and placebo (1.2%) groups. 
In the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies, through Week 16, the proportions of subjects with a Grade 2 or higher 
post-baseline increases in AST was slightly higher in the guselkumab q4w group (2.4%) compared with 
the guselkumab q8w (1.3%), and placebo (1.4%) groups; this is consistent with data through Week 24. 
Through Week 16 in the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies, Grade 2 or higher post-baseline increases 
in AST were similar in the guselkumab q8w (1.3%) and placebo (1.4%) groups.

Through 1 year, most post-baseline increases in ALT and AST were Grade 1 and the proportions of 
subjects with Grade 1 or higher post-baseline increases in ALT were higher in the guselkumab q4w 
(46.9%) group compared with the q8w group (36.2%). The proportions of subjects with Grade 1 or 
higher post-baseline increases in AST were also slightly higher in the guselkumab q4w (33.2%) group 
compared with the q8w group (26.3%). A greater frequency was observed with the longer duration of 
exposure through 1 year. 
AEs reported in the Hepatobiliary disorders SOC were comparable between the guselkumab q4w (3.5%) 
and q8w (2.7%) groups. The majority of AEs reported through 1 year were preferred terms (PTs) related 
to hepatic steatosis for both the q4w (2.7%) and q8w (1.3%) groups. Through 1 year, 3 subjects in the 
guselkumab q4w group reported PTs of Drug-induced liver injury (DILI), Hepatitis toxic, and 
Hepatocellular injury (one subject each) and causality was assessed as related to the concomitant anti-TB 
therapy in all 3 subjects. 
There were no events that satisfied the criteria for Hy’s Law in guselkumab-treated subjects through 1 
year.
In subjects with baseline MTX use, Grade 1 or higher increases in ALT were more frequent than in 
subjects without baseline MTX use.
In the guselkumab Phase 2/3 study in Crohn’s disease, CNTO1959CRD3001 (EudraCT number: 2017 
002195-13), a single case of toxic hepatitis with severe elevation of liver function tests meeting Hy’s law 
criteria occurred in a subject who was randomized to receive guselkumab 1200 mg IV at Weeks 0, 4, and 
8 followed by 200 mg SC q4w. A thorough review of the case and a comprehensive signal evaluation, 
including review of the biological plausibility of IL-23 blockade and DILI, and preclinical, clinical, and 
postmarketing data, was performed. Neither the detailed evaluation of the biological plausibility of IL-23 
blockade and DILI that focused on possible genetic associations between the IL-23 pathway and liver 
injury, IL-23 pathway links to viral infections that might be associated with liver injury, and the role of IL-
23 and IL-22 in liver biology, nor the toxicology findings for the compound, nor the clinical study data 
evaluation, demonstrated a biological basis for a causal relationship between this event and exposure to 
guselkumab.
A review of all postmarketing events reported with laboratory test results and/or with PTs relevant for 
liver injury did not identify any event of potential DILI attributed to guselkumab.
Safety in special populations
Intrinsic Factors
Age
Overall, in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies safety analysis set, 42.9% of subjects were <45 years of age, 
51.6% of subjects were ≥45 and <65 years of age, and 5.5% of subjects were ≥65 years of age. 
In the <45 years of age subgroup only, AEs were reported more frequently in each of the guselkumab 
groups (48.3% for q8w and 48.4% for q4w) compared with the placebo group (40.3%). The proportions 
of subjects with SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent, infections, and serious infections 
were generally similar between the guselkumab groups and the placebo group (through Week 24) and 
between the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups (through the data cut) in all age subgroups (ie, <45 years 
of age, ≥45 and <65 years of age, and ≥65 years of age). 
No consistent differences were observed in the overall safety profile of guselkumab among age subgroups 
through Week 24 and the data cut.

EMA/600660/2020
Page 150/179
 
 
Sex
Overall, in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies safety analysis set, 52.1% of subjects were males. 
The proportions of subjects with AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent, infections, and 
serious infections were generally similar between the guselkumab groups and the placebo group (through 
Week 24) and between the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups (through the data cut) in both of the gender 
subgroups. 
No consistent differences were observed in the overall safety profile of guselkumab between gender 
subgroups through Week 24 and the data cut. 
Race
Overall, in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies safety analysis set, approximately 96% of the subjects were 
white most of the other subjects were Asian; thus interpretation of data regarding the impact of race 
upon safety is limited due to the small number of subjects who were a race other than white.
Weight
Overall, 62% of subjects in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies safety analysis set weighed ≤90 kg and 38% 
weighed >90 kg. 
The proportions of subjects with AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent, infections, and 
serious infections were generally similar between the guselkumab groups and the placebo group (through 
Week 24) and between the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups (through the data cut) in both of the weight 
subgroups (ie, ≤90 kg or >90 kg). 
Overall, 40% of subjects in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies safety analysis set were obese with a BMI ≥30 
kg/m2, 34.5% were overweight with BMI ≥25 to <30 kg/m2, and 25.5% had a normal BMI (<25 kg/m2).
The proportions of subjects with AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent, infections, and 
serious infections were generally similar between the guselkumab groups and the placebo group (through 
Week 24) and between the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups (through the data cut) in all BMI subgroups 
(ie, (<25 kg/m2, ≥25 to <30 kg/m2, or ≥30 kg/m2). 
No consistent differences were observed in the overall safety profile of guselkumab among weight or BMI 
subgroups through Week 24 and the data cut. 
C-Reactive Protein
At baseline, 52.9% of subjects in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies safety analysis set had a CRP <1 mg/dL, 
19.1% had a CRP of ≥1 to <2 mg/dL, and 28.0% had a CRP of ≥2 mg/dL. 
The proportions of subjects with AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent, infections, and 
serious infections were generally similar between the guselkumab groups and the placebo group (through 
Week 24) and between the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups (through the data cut) in all CRP subgroups 
(ie, <1 mg/dL, ≥1 to <2 mg/dL, and ≥2 mg/dL). 
No consistent differences were observed in the overall safety profile of guselkumab among CRP subgroups 
through Week 24 and the data cut.

Body Surface Area Affected by Psoriasis
In the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies safety analysis set, the BSA affected by psoriasis at baseline was <3% 
in 21.1% of subjects, ≥3% to <10% in 32.4% of subjects, ≥10% to <20% in 19.9% of subjects, and 
≥20% in 26.6% of subjects. 
The proportions of subjects with AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent, infections, and 
serious infections were generally similar between the guselkumab groups and the placebo group (through 
Week 24) and between the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups (through the data cut) in all subgroups of 
BSA affected by psoriasis (ie, <3%, ≥3% to <10%, ≥10% to <20%, and ≥20%). 
No consistent differences were observed in the overall safety profile of guselkumab among BSA affected 
by psoriasis subgroups through Week 24 and the data cut. 
Extrinsic Factors
Geographic Region
At baseline, 30% of subjects were from sites in Russia, 26% were from sites in Ukraine, 17% were from 
sites in Poland, 8% were from sites in Western countries (USA, Canada, Spain, and Germany), and 19% 
were from sites in other countries (combining countries of Asia Pacific and Eastern European countries 
other than Russia, Ukraine, and Poland). 
No consistent differences were observed in the overall safety profile of guselkumab among geographic 
regions through Week 24 and the data cut. 
Oral Corticosteroid Use at Baseline
At baseline, 17.8% of subjects in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies safety analysis set used oral 
corticosteroids. 
In the small number of subjects with baseline use of oral corticosteroids, SAEs were reported more 
frequently in the guselkumab q4w (4.8%) group compared with the q8w (1.5%) and placebo (1.4%) 
groups through Week 24 and more frequently in the guselkumab q4w group (11.3%) compared with the 
guselkumab q8w group (5.9%) through the data cut. Also, among subjects with baseline use of oral 
corticosteroids, infections were reported more frequently in the guselkumab q4w group (24.2%) 
compared with the guselkumab q8w (11.8%) and placebo (15.9%) groups through Week 24; through the 
data cut, infections were reported at comparable frequencies in the guselkumab q8w (32.4%) and 
guselkumab q4w (33.9%) groups. 
The proportions of subjects with AEs and serious infections were similar between the guselkumab groups 
and the placebo group (through Week 24) and between the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups (through 
the data cut) in both subjects with and without baseline use of oral corticosteroids. 
Although the number of subjects who used oral corticosteroids at baseline was small, no consistent 
differences were observed in the overall safety profile of guselkumab by baseline use of corticosteroids 
through Week 24 and the data cut. 
Baseline Use of Non-biologic DMARDs, Including MTX
Baseline use of non-biologic DMARDs (ie, MTX, SSZ, HCQ, and LEF) was reported in 67.8% of subjects 
(86.1% [n=654] used MTX and 13.8% [n=105] used non-MTX DMARDs) in the pooled Phase 3 PsA 
studies safety analysis set. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 152/179
 
 
There was a general trend across the treatment groups for a slightly higher frequency of AEs and 
infections in subjects who reported baseline use of non-biologic DMARDs or MTX compared with subjects 
without baseline use of non-biologic DMARDs through Week 24 and the data cut.
Among the small number of subjects without baseline use of non-biologic DMARDs, through Week 24 
infections were reported more frequently in the guselkumab q4w (23.1%) group compared with the 
guselkumab q8w (16.4%) and placebo (15.3%) groups; the difference between the guselkumab q8w and 
q4w groups was not seen through the data cut. In subjects with baseline use of MTX, through Week 24 
and the data cut, the frequency of infection was not higher in the guselkumab q4w group (20.6% and 
30.7%, respectively) compared with the guselkumab q8w group (23.0% and 38.3%, respectively). 
The proportions of subjects with AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent, and serious 
infections were similar between the guselkumab groups and the placebo group (through Week 24) and 
between the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups (through the data cut) both in subjects with and without 
baseline use of non-biologic DMARDs, including subjects with baseline use of MTX. 
No consistent differences were observed in the overall safety profile of guselkumab by baseline use of 
non-biologic DMARDs, including MTX, through Week 24 and the data cut.
Prior Use of Non-biologic Treatments
Prior use of non-biological treatments including DMARDs, systemic immunosuppressives, and oral 
apremilast was reported in 91% of subjects (1 treatment 59.8%, 2 treatments 23.9%, and 
≥3 treatments 7.3%) in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies safety analysis set. 
There was a general trend across the treatment groups for a higher frequency of AEs and infections with 
an increase in the number of prior non-biological treatments to which subjects were exposed through 
Week 24 and the data cut.
In the small number of subjects without prior use of non-biologic treatments, through Week 24 AEs were 
reported more frequently in the guselkumab q4w group (58.3%) compared with the guselkumab q8w 
(33.3%) and placebo (50.0%) groups, and through the data cut AEs were reported more frequently in the 
guselkumab q4w group (69.4%) compared with the guselkumab q8w (52.8%) group. This trend was not 
observed in subjects with prior use of non-biological treatments.
In the small number of subjects without prior use of non-biologic treatments, through Week 24, infections 
were reported more frequently in the guselkumab q4w group (33.3%) compared with the guselkumab 
q8w (13.9%) and placebo (7.1%) groups, and through the data cut, infections were reported more 
frequently in the guselkumab q4w group (36.1%) compared with the guselkumab q8w group (22.2%). 
This trend was not observed in subjects with prior use of non-biological treatments.
The proportions of subjects with SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent, and serious 
infections were similar between the guselkumab groups and the placebo group (through Week 24) and 
between the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups (through the data cut) in all subgroups of prior use of non-
biologic treatments. 
No consistent differences were observed in the overall safety profile of guselkumab by prior use of non-
biologic treatments through Week 24 and the data cut.
Prior Exposure to anti-TNFα Agents
Prior exposure to anti-TNFα agents was reported in 118 (31%) of the 381 subjects in PSA3001 (all 
subjects were biologic naïve in PSA3002). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 153/179
 
 
Among subjects who reported prior exposure to anti-TNFα agents, infections were reported more 
frequently in the guselkumab q4w group (34.2%) compared with the guselkumab q8w (24.4%) and 
placebo (23.1%) groups through Week 24 and more frequently in the guselkumab q4w (50.0%) 
compared with the guselkumab q8w group (31.7%) through the data cut; this was not observed in 
subjects who did not have prior exposure to anti-TNFα agents. 
The proportions of subjects with AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent, and serious 
infections were similar between the guselkumab groups and the placebo group (through Week 24) and 
between the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups (through the data cut) both in subjects with and without 
prior exposure to anti-TNFα agents. 
No consistent differences were observed in the overall safety profile of guselkumab by prior exposure to 
anti-TNFα agents through Week 24 and the data cut.
Through 1 year, SAEs were more frequent in the guselkumab q4w group compared with the q8w group. 
The rates of infections and serious infections in subjects using corticosteroids at baseline were similar 
between the guselkumab q4w and q8w groups through 1 year. The differences observed at Week 24 in 
the frequency of AEs and infections between the guselkumab q4w and q8w groups in subjects using non-
biologic DMARDs at baseline were no longer present at 1 year, and the frequency of serious infections in 
subjects using non-biologic DMARDs at baseline was also comparable between the guselkumab q4w and 
q8w groups at 1 year. Through 1 year, among subjects who reported prior exposure to anti-TNFα agents, 
infections (but not serious infections) and AEs were reported more frequently in the guselkumab q4w 
group compared with the q8w group.
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
As presented for the initial marketing application for psoriasis, an in vitro study using human hepatocytes 
showed that IL-23 at levels of 10 ng/mL did not alter human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activities 
(CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4). In a Phase 1 study in subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque 
psoriasis, changes in systemic exposures (maximum plasma concentration and area under the 
concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity) of midazolam, S-warfarin, omeprazole, 
dextromethorphan, and caffeine after a single dose of guselkumab were not clinically relevant, indicating 
that drug interactions between guselkumab and substrates of various CYP enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2) are unlikely.
Discontinuation due to adverse events
Study PSA2001
•
Through Week 44, 2 (2.0%) subjects in the guselkumab group (1.6% in the guselkumab 
combined group) had AEs that subsequently resulted in discontinuation of study agent administration. 
One subject was discontinued due to leukopenia and neutropenia, and 1 subject was discontinued due to 
repeated episodes of pneumonia.
Pooled Phase 3 Psoriatic Arthritis Studies
The number of subjects who discontinued study agent due to an AE through Week 24 was low across all 
treatment groups; 5 (1.3%) subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, 8 (2.1%) subjects in the 
guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, and 7 (1.9%) subjects in the placebo group.

No individual AE led to discontinuation of guselkumab in more than 1 subject.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020


Four subjects treated with guselkumab reported infections that led to discontinuation of study agent; 
bronchitis was reported in 1 subject in the guselkumab q8w group and acute hepatitis B, pneumonia 
influenzal, and rhinovirus infection were each reported in 1 subject in the guselkumab q4w group.
Through Week 24, the overall rates of AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent per 100 subject-
years of follow-up were 2.88, 6.97, and 4.05 for the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and placebo 
groups, respectively. 
The number of subjects who discontinued study agent due to an AE through the data cut was low in 
both the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group (8 [2.1%]) and the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group (10 [2.7%] 
subjects.


Injection site erythema resulted in discontinuation of guselkumab in 2 subjects in the guselkumab 
q4w group; no other AEs resulted in discontinuation of guselkumab in more than 1 subject in either 
the guselkumab q8w or q4w groups. 
Six subjects in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups reported infections that led to discontinuation of 
study agent; in addition to acute hepatitis B, bronchitis, pneumonia influenzal, and rhinovirus 
infection reported through Week 24, paronychia (guselkumab q8w), and pneumonia necrotizing 
(guselkumab q8w), were reported through the data cut. 
The event rates (per 100 subject-years of follow-up) for AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent in 
the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups through the data cut were consistent with those in the same groups 
through Week 24. Through the data cut, the overall rates of AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent 
per 100 subject-years of follow-up were 2.15, 4.04, and 3.72 for the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, 
and guselkumab q4w combined groups, respectively.
Comparisons of Safety in Psoriatic Arthritis and Psoriasis
The overall proportions of subjects reporting AEs and AEs of infection through Week 16 were comparable 
across the guselkumab and placebo groups in both the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies and the pooled 
PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies. Through Week 16, the proportions of subjects reporting SAEs, AEs 
resulting in discontinuation of study agent, serious infections, AEs with severe intensity, and malignancies 
were low and comparable across the guselkumab and placebo groups in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies 
as well as in the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies. Injection-site reactions were reported at a 
slightly higher frequency with guselkumab injections compared with placebo injections in both the pooled 
Phase 3 PsA studies and in the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies through Week 16.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020

Through Week 16, AEs reported in ≥5% of subjects in a guselkumab-treated group included ALT 
increased and nasopharyngitis in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies and nasopharyngitis and URTI in the 
pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies. 
Adverse events reported more frequently with guselkumab compared with placebo (ie, in ≥1% of subjects 
in any guselkumab group and ≥2 times more frequently in the guselkumab combined group compared 
with the placebo group) in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies through Week 16 included nasopharyngitis, 
ALT increased, AST increased, bronchitis, respiratory tract infection, injection site erythema, leukopenia, 
and neutrophil count decreased which is generally consistent with PsA data through Week 24. 
Nasopharyngitis and injection site erythema were previously identified as ADRs. Respiratory tract 
infection, bronchitis, transaminases increased, and neutrophil count decreased were identified as new 
ADRs from the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies. Adverse events of leukopenia were most commonly 
associated with decreased neutrophil count and were considered together with neutrophil count 
decreased. Through Week 16 in the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies, injection site erythema was 
reported more frequently with guselkumab compared with placebo (ie, in ≥1% of subjects in the 
guselkumab group and ≥2 times more frequently in the guselkumab group compared with the placebo 
group). 
Through Week 16, the overall AE rates (per 100 subject-years of follow-up) in the guselkumab groups 
were comparable with those in the placebo groups in both the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies and the pooled 
PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies. Through Week 16, the overall AE rates per 100 subject-years of follow-
up were 252.59, 238.27, and 228.68 for the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and placebo groups, 
respectively, in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies, and 330.11 and 316.87 for the guselkumab q8w and 
placebo groups, respectively, in the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies. 
Through Week 16, the majority of AEs were of mild intensity in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies (63.6%, 
67.8%, and 60.7%  of AEs reported in the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and placebo groups, 
respectively) and in the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies (61.5% and 58.9% of AEs reported in the 
guselkumab q8w and placebo groups, respectively). The numbers of subjects reporting 1 or more AEs of 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

severe intensity were low and similar across treatment groups in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies (3 
[0.8%] subjects in the guselkumab q8w group, 2 [0.5%] subjects in guselkumab q4w group, and 2 
[0.5%] subjects in the placebo group) as well as in the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies (9 [1.1%] 
subjects in the guselkumab q8w group and 8 [1.9%] subjects in the placebo group).
Serious Adverse Events
Through Week 16, the proportions of subjects reporting SAEs were low and similar between the 
guselkumab and placebo groups in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies, as well as in the pooled PSO3001 and 
PSO3002 studies. In the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies through Week 16, SAEs were reported in 5 (1.3%) 
subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, 5 (1.3%) subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, 
and 7 (1.9%) subjects in the placebo group. In the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies through Week 
16, SAEs were reported in 16 (1.9%) subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group and 6 (1.4%) 
subjects in the placebo group. Through Week 16 in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies and the pooled 
PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies, all individual SAEs were reported in single subjects; except non-cardiac 
chest pain which was reported in 2 subjects in the guselkumab group in the pooled PSO3001 and 
PSO3002 studies. 
Through Week 16 in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies and the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies, the 
overall SAE rates (per 100 subject-years of follow-up) were low and comparable in the guselkumab and 
placebo groups. Through Week 16, the overall SAE rates per 100 subject-years of follow-up were 4.31, 
4.35, and 6.09 for the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and placebo groups, respectively, in the 
pooled Phase 3 PsA studies and 6.27 and 4.67 for the guselkumab q8w and placebo groups, respectively, 
in the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies.
Adverse Events Resulting in Discontinuation of Study Agent Administration
The proportions of subjects reporting AEs resulting in discontinuation of study agent through Week 16 
were low and similar between the guselkumab and placebo groups in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies as 
well as in the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies. In the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies through Week 16, 
AEs resulting in discontinuation of study agent were reported in 4 (1.1%) subjects in the guselkumab 100 
mg q8w group, 5 (1.3%) subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, and 4 (1.1%) subjects in the 
placebo group. In the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies through Week 16, AEs resulting in 
discontinuation of study agent were reported in 11 (1.3%) subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group 
and 4 (0.9%) subjects in the placebo group. Through Week 16 in both the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies 
and the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies, no individual AE led to discontinuation of guselkumab in 
more than 1 subject. 
Infection
Through Week 16 in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies and the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies, the 
overall proportions of subjects reporting AEs of infection were similar in the guselkumab and placebo 
groups. The proportions of subjects reporting at least 1 AE categorized as an infection by the investigator 
in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies through Week 16 were 14.1% for the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, 
16.4% for the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, and 13.4% for the placebo group. The proportions of 
subjects reporting at least 1 AE categorized as an infection by the investigator in the pooled PSO3001 and 
PSO3002 studies through Week 16 were 23.2% for the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group and 21.3% for 
the placebo group. Through Week 16 in both the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies and the pooled PSO3001 and 
PSO3002 studies, the most frequently reported AEs of infection were nasopharyngitis and URTI. 
Through Week 16, the overall AEs of infection rates per 100 subject-years of follow-up were 58.62, 
60.00, and 48.69 for the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and placebo groups, respectively, in the 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

pooled Phase 3 PsA studies, and 97.90 and 86.42 for the guselkumab q8w and placebo groups, 
respectively in the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies. 
Through Week 16, the proportions of subjects reporting serious infections during the placebo controlled 
periods were low and similar between the guselkumab and placebo groups in the pooled Phase 3 PsA 
studies as well as in the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies. In the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies 
through Week 16, serious infections were reported in no subjects in the guselkumab q8w group, 1 (0.3%) 
subject in the guselkumab q4w group, and 1 (0.3%) subject in the placebo group. In the pooled PSO3001 
and PSO3002 studies through Week 16, serious infections were reported in 1 (0.1%) subject in the 
guselkumab q8w group and 1 (0.2%) subject in the placebo group. Through Week 16 in both the pooled 
Phase 3 PsA studies and the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies, all individual serious infections were 
reported in single subjects.
Through Week 16 in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies and in the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies, 
there were no reports of TB or opportunistic infections.
Injection-site Reactions
Through Week 16, the proportions of subjects reporting ISRs were low in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies 
as well as in the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies. In the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies through Week 
16, ISRs were reported in 5 (1.3%) subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group, 4 (1.1%) subjects in 
the guselkumab 100 mg q4w group, and no subjects in the placebo group. In the pooled PSO3001 and 
PSO3002 studies through Week 16, ISRs were reported in 37 (4.5%) subjects in the guselkumab q8w 
group and 13 (3.1%) subjects in the placebo group. Through Week 16 in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies, 
as well as in the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies, the most frequently reported ISR was injection 
site erythema.
Through Week 16 in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies and the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies, all 
subjects with guselkumab ISRs reported ISRs of mild intensity with the exception of 1 subject in the 
guselkumab q4w group in the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies who reported 3 ISRs of moderate intensity. This 
subject discontinued study agent after the first dose due to injection site erythema, injection site 
swelling, and injection site warmth.
Malignancies
In the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies, no subjects reported NMSC and malignancies other than NMSC, were 
reported in 2 subjects in the guselkumab 100 mg q8w group (malignant melanoma in situ and plasma cell 
myeloma) and 1 subject in the placebo group (clear cell renal cell carcinoma). 
When PSO3001 and PSO3002 were pooled through Week 16, NMSC was reported in 1 subject in the 
guselkumab group (basal cell carcinoma) and no other malignancies were reported in guselkumab- or 
placebo-treated subjects. 
MACE
In the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies through Week 24, there was 1 report of MACE in a subject treated with 
guselkumab and 1 report of MACE in a subject who received only placebo. In the pooled PSO3001 and 
PSO3002 studies through Week 16, MACE was reported in 1 subject treated with guselkumab. 
Anaphylactic and Serum Sickness Reactions
In the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies through Week 24 and in the pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies 
through Week 16 there were no reports of anaphylaxis or serum sickness reactions.

Relationship Between Antibodies to Guselkumab and Safety in Psoriatic 
Arthritis
The overall incidence of antibodies to guselkumab through Week 24 was low (2.0%, 15 of 744 subjects) 
in subjects with PsA. The highest titers of antibodies to guselkumab observed were 1:5,120. In addition, 
the incidence of antibodies to guselkumab through Week 24 was comparable between the 2 dose groups 
(100 mg q8w: 1.6% [6 of 373 subjects]; 100 mg q4w: 2.4% [9 of 371 subjects]).
Only 1 of the 15 subjects (6.7%) who was positive for antibodies to guselkumab was also positive for 
neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to guselkumab. In PSA3001, 1 of the 5 subjects who was positive for 
antibodies to guselkumab was positive for NAbs to guselkumab. In PSA3002, none of the 10 subjects who 
were positive for antibodies to guselkumab status were positive for NAbs to guselkumab.
For subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab, 9 of 15 (60%) subjects had 1 or more AEs 
through Week 24. For subjects who were negative for antibodies to guselkumab, 354 of 729 (48.6%) 
subjects had 1 or more AEs through Week 24. 
None of the 15 subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab had an ISR through Week 24, 
while 7 (1.0%) of the 729 subjects who were negative for antibodies to guselkumab had at least one ISR. 
No events of hypersensitivity (Type 1) were reported through Week 24 in the Phase 3 PsA studies.
Post marketing experience
Post-marketing information has been accruing since the first approval of guselkumab for the treatment of 
adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis by the United States Food and Drug 
Administration on 13 July 2017. As of 12 July 2019, guselkumab is approved in the European Union, the 
United States, Japan, Canada, and many other countries worldwide. 
The estimated cumulative global exposure to guselkumab from launch through 30 June 2019 is 34,505 
person-years. The evaluation of post-marketing data is part of the Sponsor’s comprehensive safety 
surveillance program, which also includes review of data from ongoing clinical studies and registries. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports generated for guselkumab reflect ongoing post marketing safety 
surveillance, as well as assessments of all important identified and potential risks. 
The cutoff date for post-marketing data in this SCS is 12 July 2019, which coincides with the most recent 
Periodic Safety Update Report cutoff date. No new ADRs were identified in the most recent Periodic Safety 
Update Report. Guselkumab continues to have a favorable benefit-risk profile for the treatment of adult 
patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The Sponsor will continue to monitor the safety profile 
of guselkumab and report the safety findings as appropriate. There is no post marketing data for the Q4W 
regimen
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety
The approved dose of guselkumab for the treatment of plaque psoriasis is 100 mg administered 
subcutaneously (SC) at Week 0, Week 4, and every 8 weeks (q8w) thereafter. This was based primarily 
on two large, Phase 3, placebo-controlled clinical studies (PSO3001 and PSO3002). The overall safety 
profile of guselkumab was in line with compounds in the similar therapeutic class interfering with the IL-
pathway in psoriasis. In general, the incidence of adverse events was low, mostly similar to placebo, 
similar to or more favourable than the active comparator adalimumab or ustekinumab and they were 
mainly mild in severity. The long-term extension data from the Phase 3 psoriasis studies through 3 years 
demonstrated that the 3-year safety profile was consistent with the 1-year safety data reported in the 
original psoriasis marketing application.

EMA/600660/2020

The clinical development program of guselkumab for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) 
includes a completed global Phase 2 study (PSA2001) and 2 global Phase 3 studies (PSA3001 and 
PSA3002). Through the data cut (01 May 2019), a total of 1,229 subjects with active PsA were exposed 
to guselkumab across the Phase 2 (PSA2001) and Phase 3 PsA studies (PSA3001 and PSA3002), including 
1,093 (88.9%) subjects treated for at least 6 months and 588 (47.8%) subjects treated for at least 1 
year.
The safety profile in the PsA population was generally comparable with that established in the psoriasis 
population.
The overall frequency of AEs was similar in the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and placebo groups 
through Week 24. The most common AEs in subjects exposed to guselkumab were in the Infections and 
infestations SOC; and the frequencies of AEs in this SOC were generally comparable across the 
guselkumab and placebo groups with no dose dependency. Through Week 24, the most frequently 
reported AEs in subjects treated with guselkumab were ALT increased, nasopharyngitis, AST increased, 
and URTI. AST increased, bronchitis, headache, respiratory tract infection, injection site erythema and 
oropharyngeal pain were reported more frequently in the guselkumab groups compared with the placebo 
group. Neutrophil count decreased, hyperuricaemia, and hepatic steatosis were reported more frequently 
in the guselkumab q4w group compared with the q8w group. Respiratory tract infection (very common), 
transaminases increased (common), and neutrophil count decreased (uncommon) were identified as a 
new ADRs for guselkumab and added to 4.8 of the SmPC. Furthermore the frequencies of Urticaria, Tinea 
infections, Gastroenteritis and Herpes simplex infections were updated in their frequencies from common 
to uncommon.
Through the data cut, both the overall frequency of AEs and the frequency of AEs in the Infections and 
infestations SOC were similar in the guselkumab q8w and guselkumab q4w groups. Through the data cut, 
there was no evidence for an increase in the overall follow-up adjusted AE rates in subjects treated with 
guselkumab q8w or guselkumab q4w when compared with data through Week 24. The most frequently 
reported AEs in subjects treated with guselkumab were nasopharyngitis, ALT increased, URTI, and AST 
increased.
The overall frequency of AEs of infections was similar in the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and 
placebo groups through Week 24 and in the guselkumab q8w and guselkumab q4w groups through the 
data cut. Serious infections occurred infrequently in all treatment groups through the data cut and all AEs 
of serious infection were reported in single subjects. Through the data cut, there was no evidence for an 
increase in the overall follow-up adjusted rates of AEs of infections or serious infections in subjects 
treated when compared with data through Week 24. There were no reports of active TB or an 
opportunistic infection in any of the guselkumab-treated subjects.
In the two phase III psoriatic arthritis clinical studies through Week 24, the number of subjects that 
reported 1 or more injection site reactions was low and slightly higher in the Tremfya groups than in the 
placebo group; 5 (1.3%) subjects in the Tremfya q8w group, 4 (1.1%) subjects in the Tremfya q4w 
group, and 1 (0.3%) subject in the placebo group. One subject discontinued Tremfya due to an injection 
site reaction during the placebo-controlled period of the psoriatic arthritis clinical studies. Overall, the rate 
of injections associated with injection site reactions observed in psoriatic arthritis clinical studies through 
the placebo-controlled period were similar to those observed in the psoriasis clinical studies. This 
information has been added to the SmPC.Most ISRs were of mild intensity, there were no serious ISRs, 2 
subjects in the guselkumab q4w group discontinued study agent due to ISRs of moderate intensity.
The data from the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies demonstrate a small number of malignancies, with 
corresponding rates similar to what would be expected in the general population.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020

There was no evidence for an increase in the rate of subjects reporting MACE in the pooled Phase 3 PsA 
studies.
There was no evidence for an increase in the reporting rate of SIB over time through the data cut and the 
follow-up adjusted number of subjects reporting SIB in both guselkumab groups remained lower than the 
placebo group through Week 24.
No cases of anaphylaxis or serum sickness reaction were reported through the data cut in PSA3001 and 
PSA3002.
Through Week 24, there were no reports of new onset or exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease, 
including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, in guselkumab-treated subjects. More long-term data will 
become available when final data from clinical study PSA3002 will be submitted as defined in the RMP . 
No deaths were reported in any of the guselkumab treated groups.
The overall follow-up adjusted SAE rates in the guselkumab q8w, guselkumab q4w, and guselkumab q4w 
combined groups were low and similar across groups. Through the data cut, there was no evidence for an 
increase in the overall follow-up adjusted SAE rates in subjects treated with guselkumab q8w or 
guselkumab q4w when compared with data through Week 24. Most SAEs reported in subjects exposed to 
guselkumab were reported in single subjects.
Overall, any abnormal hematology laboratory parameters of Grade 2 or higher were infrequent (≤3.4% in 
the combined guselkumab groups). Through Week 24 and the data cut decreases in neutrophil, WBC and 
platelet counts were observed in the guselkumab groups. From baseline to Week 24, a shift in neutrophil 
count from within the normal reference range to below the normal reference range was reported in a 
greater proportion of subjects in the guselkumab groups compared with the placebo group. A numerical 
trend of a greater mean reduction from baseline in neutrophil and WBC counts in the guselkumab groups 
compared with the placebo group was observed over time through Week 24. Through the data cut, the 
mean change from baseline in neutrophil and WBC counts was similar between the guselkumab q8w and 
q4w groups.  A greater frequency of decreases in neutrophil counts and WBC counts was observed with 
longer duration of exposure through 1 year. No Grade 3 or higher WBC count decrease was observed 
through 1 year. Grade ≥2 neutrophil count decreases and Grade 2 WBC count decreases in guselkumab-
treated subjects were generally not associated with infections. Mean values for neutrophil counts and 
WBC counts in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups did not further decrease from Week 24 through 1 
year of treatment. The majority of cases of neutrophil and WBC count decreases were transient and 
reversible, resolved spontaneously without treatment and were not associated with infections. At the 
Week 24 assessment neutropenia was not the reason of discontinuation of study agent administration but 
at Week 44 one case is mentioned.  The number of neutrophils decreased, although not seriously during 
the psoriasis clinical studies as well. ‘Neutrophil count decreased’ is considered as a new adverse drug 
reaction and reflected in 4.8 of the SmPC. The clinical consequences of neutropenia is addressed in the 
RMP under the important potential risk: “serious infection”.
A numerical trend of a greater mean reduction from baseline in platelets in the guselkumab groups 
compared with the placebo group was observed over time through Week 24. Through the data cut, the 
mean decrease from baseline in platelet counts was comparable in the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups. 
The proportions of subjects with Grade 1 or higher decreases in platelet counts were low and comparable 
across the guselkumab q4w, guselkumab q8w, and placebo groups. Among all guselkumab-treated 
subjects, at most timepoints through the data cut the mean decrease from baseline in platelet count was 
<25 x 109/L; the mean decrease was slightly greater at later timepoints (ie, Week 84 and later) that 
included fewer subjects. Compared to the proportion of subjects with a shift in platelet count from 
within/above reference range at baseline to below reference range post baseline in the placebo-controlled 
period, as expected, a greater proportion of subjects with shifts was observed with longer duration of

exposure through 1 year. There was no further decrease of mean platelet counts from Week 24 through 1 
year. The decreases in platelet counts were transient, resolved spontaneously without treatment, did not 
lead to study agent interruption or discontinuation, and were not associated with bleeding events. Mean 
platelet counts appeared to plateau 12 to 16 weeks after first treatment of guselkumab at Week 0 and 
were consistent with expected changes due to a decrease in inflammatory response following anti-
inflammatory treatment.
Overall, there were no clinically significant trends for chemistry laboratory parameters other than 
Increases in ALT and AST, that were observed with a higher frequency in the guselkumab groups 
compared with the placebo group. Through Week 24, Grade 2 or higher increases in ALT and AST were 
reported infrequently (<3%) and were reported more frequently in the guselkumab q4w group compared 
with the guselkumab q8w and placebo groups. Through the data cut, Grade 2 increases in ALT and Grade 
2 and Grade 3 increases in AST were reported more frequently in the q4w group compared with the q8w 
group giving the impression of being dose related. Among all guselkumab-treated subjects, the mean 
change from baseline in ALT was generally an increase of approximately 1 to 3 U/L at all timepoints 
through the data cut; the mean increase was slightly greater at later timepoints (ie, Week 68 and later). 
It is noted that the increases from baseline were generally transient without an apparent pattern in onset, 
resolved spontaneously, and did not result in study agent interruptions or discontinuations except in 3 
subjects (not related), and were generally not associated with clinically significant increases in bilirubin.  
Through 1 year, most post-baseline increases in ALT and AST were Grade 1 and the proportions of 
subjects with Grade 1 or higher post-baseline increases in ALT were higher in the guselkumab q4w 
(46.9%) group compared with the q8w group (36.2%). The proportions of subjects with Grade 1 or 
higher post-baseline increases in AST were also slightly higher in the guselkumab q4w (33.2%) group 
compared with the q8w group (26.3%). A higher frequency was observed with the longer duration of 
exposure through 1 year. No events that satisfied the criteria for Hy’s Law (total bilirubin >2×ULN and 
either ALT or AST ≥3×ULN) in guselkumab-treated subjects through 1 year were reported. 
AEs reported in the Hepatobiliary disorders SOC were comparable between the guselkumab q4w (3.5%) 
and q8w (2.7%) groups. The majority of AEs reported through 1 year were preferred terms (PTs) related 
to hepatic steatosis for both the q4w (2.7%) and q8w (1.3%) groups. The majority of the hepatic 
steatosis events was reported as mild and considered not related to study treatment by the investigator 
and confounded by several other factors such as obesity, use of other hepatotoxic concomitant 
medications (ie, MTX, NSAIDs), and reported alcohol use. Through 1 year, 3 subjects in the guselkumab 
q4w group reported PTs of Drug-induced liver injury (DILI), Hepatitis toxic, and Hepatocellular injury (one 
subject each) and causality was assessed as related to the concomitant anti-TB therapy in all 3 subjects. 
A comprehensive review of the guselkumab safety database, performed for the evaluation of a potential 
DILI case reported in the Crohn’s disease study, did not identify any concerns of DILI in guselkumab-
treated subjects either in clinical studies across all indications or in postmarketing experience. In subjects 
with baseline MTX use, Grade 1 or higher increases in ALT were more frequent than in subjects without 
baseline MTX use.  In subjects with baseline use of MTX and NSAIDs, Grade 1 or higher increases in ALT 
and AST were reported more frequently in the guselkumab q4w group compared with the q8w group and 
were comparable to the frequency of elevations seen in subjects with baseline use of MTX alone. As in the 
overall population, the majority of these increases was Grade 1 and the frequencies of Grade 2 or higher 
increases remained low through 1 year.
Emergency Safety Issue of DILI observed in GALAXI study was a serious liver injury event occurring after 
i.v. exposure of 1200 mg guselkumab dose, without co-administration of other liver-damaging medicinal 
products, it was a single event observed in a Crohn's disease patient.
In PSO studies, slight tendencies of transaminase increases were observed in guselkumab 100 mg sc at 
Week 0, 4 and every 8 weeks thereafter even in long-term setting.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 162/179
 
 
In the RA study, there was no dose-related effect on shifts in ALT or AST from below or within normal 
range to above normal range in guselkumab-treated subjects. There was also no dose-related increase in 
frequencies in guselkumab-treated subjects with .Grade 1 increases in ALT or AST.
The PRAC accepted the Applicant's position that no additional risk minimalisation measures should be 
included into RMP. 
Nevertheless, slight increases of frequencies of ALT and AST elevations in guselkumab groups in PSO 
studies vs placebo, the difference in frequencies of transaminase increases in PsA and the DILI event 
after high i.v. dose of guselkumab in a Crohn's disease patient refer for possibility of dose dependence of 
incidence of transaminase elevation AEs and an elevated risk of liver injury.
Thus information on increased transaminases has been added to 4.8 and a warning on liver function 
monitoring in patients receiving Q4W therapy was added to 4.4 of the SmPC at the CHMP’s request.  
Overall through Week 24 and through the data cut, no trends were observed with regard to differences 
between the guselkumab and placebo groups or between the guselkumab q8w and q4w groups in the 
proportions of subjects with AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent, infections, or 
serious infections when evaluated by intrinsic factors related to baseline demographic or disease 
characteristics or by extrinsic factors of geographic region. 
In subjects using corticosteroids at baseline, SAEs and infections were seen in greater proportions of 
subjects in the guselkumab q4w group compared with the q8w group through Week 24. Through 1 year, 
SAEs were more frequent in the guselkumab q4w group compared with the q8w group although it should 
be noted that there were few events, and the majority of these events was not related to infection. The 
rates of infections and serious infections in subjects using corticosteroids at baseline were similar 
between the guselkumab q4w and q8w groups through 1 year.
The differences observed at Week 24 in the frequency of AEs and infections between the guselkumab q4w 
and q8w groups in subjects using non-biologic DMARDs at baseline were no longer present at 1 year, and 
the frequency of serious infections in subjects using non-biologic DMARDs at baseline was also 
comparable between the guselkumab q4w and q8w groups at 1 year.
In subjects with prior anti-TNFα exposure, the increase in AEs and infections (but not serious infections) 
in the guselkumab q4w group compared with the q8w group through 1 year was likely related to the 
small number of subjects in this subgroup.
Discontinuation of treatment with guselkumab q8w and guselkumab q4w for an AE(s) was infrequent. 
Through Week 24, as well as through the data cut the overall rates of AEs leading to discontinuation of 
study agent per 100 subject-years of follow up were higher for the guselkumab q4w treated group than 
for the guselkumab q8w and placebo groups.
There was no apparent association between the development of antibodies to guselkumab and the 
incidence of AEs. However, the small number of subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab 
limits a definitive conclusion regarding the impact of antibodies to guselkumab on the incidence of AEs.
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety
The safety profile in the PsA population was generally comparable with that established in the psoriasis 
population and data on long term safety will be complemented post authorisation with final results of 
study PSA3002 which is defined as a category 3 study in the RMP. Based on the review of the pooled 
Phase 3 PsA studies through Week 24, additional ADRs of Respiratory tract infection, Transaminases 
increased, and Neutrophil count decreased were identified and added to the SmPC. Adverse event profile 
was rather mild, guselkumab can be considered well-tolerated. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 163/179
 
 
There was a marginal trend with increases in transaminases slightly higher in the guselkumab q4w group 
compared with the q8w group, the numbers are low. However, a consistent safety profile with the 
majority of subjects experiencing increases in transaminases of Grade 1 increases, no events that 
satisfied the criteria for Hy’s Law (total bilirubin >2×ULN and either ALT or AST ≥3×ULN) in guselkumab-
treated subjects through 1 year were reported. Increase of transaminases was added as a new ADR in 
4.8 of the SmPC as well as differences observed in liver function tests between the q4w and q8w dose. 
Furthermore cautionary statements were added in 4.4 of the SmPC including the recommendation to 
evaluate liver enzymes at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management when 
prescribing Tremfya q4w in psoriatic arthritis and to interrupt treatment with  Tremfya if increases in ALT 
or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected until this diagnosis is excluded..

2.7.  Update of the Product information
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. Additionally, minor QRD changes are introduced in annex II. The Package Leaflet has been 
updated accordingly.
2.7.1.  User consultation
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:
Same pharmaceutical form and presentations will be used for the Psoriatic Arthritis indication as those 
already licensed for use in the Psoriasis indication (solution for injection in pre-filled syringe, and solution 
for injection in pre-filled pen). 
PsA patient population is not considered different from psoriasis patient population in terms of visual 
and reading capabilities
Only minor changes are proposed in Tremfya PL, its design and layout remain unchanged.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory arthropathy of the peripheral and axial joints associated with 
psoriasis. The estimated prevalence of PsA in the general population varies from 0.02% to 1.0% across 
the world; in patients with psoriasis, the prevalence of PsA ranges from 6% to 42%. PsA impacts the 
joints, bone and cartilage, periarticular tissues (dactylitis), entheses, and skin, and can result in 
functional disability and impaired quality of life. 
The severity of disease can vary substantially among patients, with some patients developing destructive 
arthritis leading to bony erosion and loss of joint architecture. In long-term cohort studies of patients with 
PsA, it has been estimated that approximately 50% to 60% of patients with PsA will not exhibit structural 
damage over time.
Guselkumab (Tremfya) has been approved in the EU for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
This submission presents data to support the use of guselkumab in adult patients with active psoriatic 
arthritis (PsA). The indication claimed is as follows:
Psoriatic arthritis
Tremfya, alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the treatment of active 
psoriatic arthritis in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to 
a prior disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy (see section 5.1).
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
Anti-TNFα agents were the first biologic agents approved for the treatment of PsA. Ustekinumab, an 
inhibitor of IL-12/23, apremilast, an inhibitor of PDE4, secukinumab and ixekizumab, antibody directed 
against IL-17, were also recently approved for PsA. These therapies have greatly improved the 
management of patients with PsA. Unfortunately, 40% to 60% of patients treated with current therapies 
do not reach a minimal improvement in their joint disease (ie, ACR 20) based on clinical trial data. In 
addition, TNFi-exposed patients may be more resistant to treatment, as the proportion of subjects 
achieving an ACR 20 was lower for TNFi-exposed than in TNFi-naive subjects in trials of ustekinumab, 
apremilast, and secukinumab.
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
The guselkumab clinical development program for PsA includes a completed Phase 2 
(CNTO1959PSA2001) and two Phase 3 (CNTO1959PSA3001 and CNTO1959PSA3002 (ongoing)) studies in 
adult subjects with PsA who had inadequate response to, or were intolerant of conventional therapy (ie, 
non biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs [DMARDs], apremilast, or nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), and/or anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) therapies (PSA2001 and 
PSA3001 only). The guselkumab 100 mg SC at Weeks 0, 4, and every 8 weeks (q8w) thereafter dose 
regimen was evaluated in study PSA2001. Both the guselkumab q8w and guselkumab SC 100 mg every 4 
weeks (q4w) dose regimens were evaluated in studies PSA3001 and PSA3002.The MAH provided 
preliminary efficacy and safety data from the phase 3 studies through week 52. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 171/179
 
 
The primary endpoint in theses studies, ACR 20 at week 24, is in line with the current PsA guidelines and 
with previous applications authorised in this condition.
The key secondary endpoints examined effects on a range of efficacy measurements such as HAQ DI, 
DAS 28 CRP, ACR 50, 70 effects on dactylitis and enthesitis. 
The 3002 study examined effects on Mtss radiographic changes, this was an enriched population who had 
active disease defined by high CRP and ≥5 tender and swollen joints and had an inadequate response to 
DMARDs. 
Additional endpoints included quality of life measurements, minimal and very low disease activity, PK 
exposure response relationship, antibody responses and subgroup analysis.
3.2.  Favourable effects
In the 2 large placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies (PSA3001 and PSA3002), guselkumab 100 mg at Weeks 
0, 4 and q8w thereafter as well as guselkumab 100 mg q4w demonstrated significant and clinically 
meaningful efficacy relative to placebo across multiple endpoints and subpopulations of PsA.
At the primary endpoint ACR20 response rate at Week 24 as well as at key secondary endpoints ACR50 
and ACR70 response rates at Week 24 guselkumab Q4W and Q8W dosing regimens reached statistically 
significant therapeutic response over placebo in study PSA3001. In study PSA3002, both dosing regimens 
reached statistical significance at ACR20 response rate. 
As for psoriasis-related endpoints, PASI75 responder rate was between 70-85% during the two Phase-3 
study, PASI90, was between 50-60%. 
Efficacy endpoints characterising dactylitis, enthesetis and spondylitis demonstrated improvement for 
both treatment regimens in PSA3001 study, and for Q4W treatment group in PSA3002 study. 
According to Phase-2 study PSA2001 and the preliminary long-term data submitted with D121 responses, 
effect on ACR-endpoints and several other endpoints for PsA disease activity, psoriatic skin disease and 
joint disease progression was maintained or efficacy was even increased through Week 52.
In DISCOVER 2, inhibition of structural damage progression was measured radiographically and 
expressed as the mean change from baseline in the total modified van der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) score. 
At Week 24, the guselkumab q4w group demonstrated statistically significantly less radiographic 
progression and the guselkumab q8w group showed numerically less progression than placebo (Table 9). 
The observed benefit with the guselkumab q4w dosing regimen on inhibition of radiographic progression 
(ie, smaller mean change from baseline in total modified vdH-S score in the q4w group versus placebo) 
was most pronounced in subjects with both a high C-reactive protein value and high number of joints 
with erosions at baseline. Based on DISCOVER 2 study results, the MAH proposed a more frequent 
posology (100 mg s.c. every 4 weeks) for patients at high risk for joint damage according to clinical 
judgement. To define PsA patient subgroups who may or may not have a high risk for radiographic 
progression and may benefit from the q4w dosing regimen the MAH provided post-hoc analyses by 
relevant baseline disease characteristics which predict risk for radiographic progression in PsA, by 
baseline radiographic scores and performed risk factor identification via CART analysis. Radiographic 
results from three separate approaches all supported an incremental benefit of the guselkumab q4w dose 
regimen on inhibition of structural damage compared to the q8w regimen.

EMA/600660/2020

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
The pattern of changes in the biomarker levels is consistent with the presumed mode of action of 
guselkumab. However, connection between the change in biomarker levels and clinical outcomes had not 
been shown. The PD effect on biomarkers is unquestionable but this effect does not seem directly related 
to clinical PsA specific clinical response (ACR20, IGA). Furthermore, no difference can be seen between 
the Q4W and Q8W regimens' PD effects. A plausible hypothesis that the PD effects in both cases are 
maximal, on the plateau however, direct experimental evidence to support this notion is lacking.
The baseline DAS28 score was identified as a covariate based on Emax, with a trend indicating that 
subjects with lower baseline DAS28 scores had higher ACR20/50/70 responses. This seems to be a class 
effect characteristic of other anti-PSA biologicals. 
In the overall PsA study population, the effect of q4w dose on inhibiton of radiographic progression was 
higher (and significant) than with q8w dose (no- significant) at week 24. The effect of the guselkumab 
q8w dose regimen on inhibition of radiographic progression was higher than with q4w dose beyond Week 
24 (to week 52), suggesting that the benefit of q8w dosing on radiographic endpoints increases with 
longer exposure. Thus, altogether, the mean change in total mvdH-S was similar in the guselkumab q4w 
(1.07) and q8w groups (0.97) over 1 year of treatment in the overall PsA study population. Appropriate 
information has been added to 5.1 of the SmPC.
The MAH explained that due to the baseline imbalance in radiographic scores, the benefit of guselkumab 
q4w may have been underestimated at both Week 24 compared to placebo and at Week 52 compared to 
guselkumab q8w dose regimen. Further data on immunogenicity and long-term safety and efficacy, in 
particular for higher threshold parameters and disease progression will become available with the final 
data on the Phase 3 study PSA3002 which is defined as a category 3 study in the RMP 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
The overall safety profile of guselkumab from previously completed studies appeared in line with 
compounds in the similar therapeutic class interfering with the IL-pathway in psoriasis. In general, the 
incidence of adverse events was low, mostly similar to placebo, similar to the active comparator 
adalimumab or ustekinumab and they were mainly mild in severity. The long-term extension data from 
the Phase 3 psoriasis studies through 3 years demonstrated that the 3-year safety profile was consistent 
with the 1-year safety data reported in the original psoriasis marketing application.
The safety profile in the PsA population was generally comparable with that established in the psoriasis 
population.
Based on the review of the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies through Week 24, additional ADRs of Respiratory 
tract infection, Transaminases increased, and Neutrophil count decreased were identified and added to 
the SmPC.
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
Longer-term safety of guselkumab in the PsA and moderate to severe plaque psoriasis population will be 
monitored in the ongoing studies PSA3002, PSO3001, and PSO3002, and through appropriate registries 
as defined as additional pharmacovigilance activities (category 3 studies) in the RMP.
Clinical haematology laboratory values assessed during the Phase 3 PsA studies show decrease in 
neutrophil and platelet count the decrease in blood neutrophil count was mild, transient, not associated

with infection and did not lead to discontinuation of treatment. This information was added to the SmPC 
and is addressed in the RMP under the potential risk “serious infection”.
In pooled phase III analyses in patients with psoriatic arthritis, 2% (n=15) of patients treated with 
Tremfya developed antidrug antibodies in up to 24 weeks of treatment. Of these patients, 1 patient had 
antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. None of these patients developed injection site reactions. 
Overall, the small number of patients with antidrug antibodies limits definitive conclusion of the effect of 
immunogenicity on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety of guselkumab in patients with psoriatic 
arthritis. This information has been added to the SmPC.
Possibly dose related transaminase elevations were observed: there was marginal trends with increases 
in transaminases slightly higher in the guselkumab q4w group compared with the q8w group, the 
numbers are low but appropriate information was added to 4.8 of the SmPC for the awareness of the 
prescriber. Guselkumab shows a consistent safety profile in PsA and PsO trials, with the majority of 
subjects experiencing increases in transaminases of Grade 1 increases, no events that satisfied the 
criteria for Hy’s Law (total bilirubin >2×ULN and either ALT or AST ≥3×ULN) in guselkumab-treated 
subjects through 1 year were reported. Through 1 year, 3 subjects in the guselkumab q4w group 
reported PTs of Drug-induced liver injury (DILI), Hepatitis toxic, and Hepatocellular injury (one subject 
each) and causality was assessed as related to the concomitant anti-TB therapy in all 3 subjects. A 
comprehensive review of the guselkumab safety database, performed for the evaluation of a potential 
DILI case reported in the Crohn’s disease study, did not identify any concerns of DILI in guselkumab-
treated subjects either in clinical studies across all indications or in postmarketing experience. Therefore, 
further pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation measures are currently not warranted but the issue is to 
be followed up in future PSURs. Still, a higher incidence of liver dysfunction with Q4W vs Q8W regimen 
was observed in PsA studies through Week 24. Also, in PSO studies, slight tendencies of transaminase 
increases were observed in guselkumab 100 mg sc at Week 0, 4 and every 8 weeks thereafter even in 
long-term setting. In an ongoing RA study, however, there was no dose-related effect on shifts in ALT or 
AST from below or within normal range to above normal range in guselkumab-treated subjects.
Accordingly, precautionary statements were included in section 4.4 for liver function monitoring in 
patients receiving Q4W therapy.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
Guselkumab treatment showed benefits over placebo for the treatment of the 3 major manifestations of 
psoriatic disease (joint, soft tissue and skin), and provided improvement of physical function and health-
related quality of life in adults with active psoriatic arthritis. Both dosing regimens (q4w and q8w) 
reached statistical significance at ACR20 response rate. According to Phase-2 study PSA2001 and 
preliminary data through 1 year from the Phase 3 PsA trials, the favourable effects were maintained to 
Week 52.
Safety data through the data cut includes long-term safety data from 588 subjects with PsA subjects in 
the Phase 2 (70 subjects) and two Phase 3 (518 subjects) studies who were treated with guselkumab 100 
mg q8w or q4w continuously for at least 1 year and no specific safety concerns were observed with 
respect to long-term safety. Longer-term safety data (through 3 years of treatment) available from the 
ongoing clinical studies of guselkumab in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PSO3001 and PSO3002), 
along with more than 2 years of postmarketing safety data, show that in overall, the benefit-risk profile 
remains favorable since the approval of guselkumab for plaque psoriasis. Additional ADRs of Respiratory 
tract infection, Transaminases increased, and Neutrophil count decreased were identified in PsA trials and 
added to the SmPC. 
A higher incidence of liver dysfunction with Q4W vs Q8W regimen was observed in PsA studies through 
Week 24. Also, in PSO studies, slight tendencies of transaminase increases were observed in guselkumab 
100 mg sc at Week 0, 4 and every 8 weeks thereafter even in long-term setting. In an ongoing RA study, 
however, there was no dose-related effect on shifts in ALT or AST from below or within normal range to 
above normal range in guselkumab-treated subjects. The information on liver dysfunction and monitoring 
included in the SmPC 4.4. and 4.8 for the attention of the prescriber is considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
Guselkumab may be administered alone or in combination with a non-biologic DMARD (eg, 
methotrexate). The Phase 3 studies PSA3001 and PSA3002 demonstrated that both guselkumab 100 mg 
SC q8w and q4w dose regimens are effective in improvement in the joint, soft tissue and skin 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/600660/2020
Page 177/179
 
 
manifestations of active PsA over time through the 24-week observation period for subjects with active 
PsA.
Based on baseline number of joints with erosion and CRP data, the applicant provided a post-hoc analysis 
on the identification of the patient subpopulation gaining a clinically relevant therapeutic benefit from the 
Q4W dosing regimen. It is agreed that in some patients with higher risk of joint damage a deeper 
suppression of the disease activity as well as a need to control disease activity as soon as possible is 
required. While the activity of q8w regimen demonstrates efficacy beyond 24 weeks to week 52 
(Discover-2) this may not be sufficient in some patients with highly active PsA who are at risk of joint 
erosion, therefore allowing both a q4w and q8w posology can provide more therapeutic options for 
patients depending on their circumstances. To guide clinicians to judge which patients need higher dose, 
further information to the product information is included in Section 5.1.
 With regards to safety in general, the frequency and character of AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to 
discontinuation are comparable between the q8w and q4w dosing regimens and a dose effect is not 
apparent in the overall safety profile. Increases in transaminases from baseline were noted, which were 
slightly higher in the guselkumab q4w group compared with the q8w group but the numbers are low. 
Overall the increases were generally transient without an apparent pattern in onset, resolved 
spontaneously, did not result in study agent discontinuation and were generally not associated with 
clinically significant increases in bilirubin. There were no cases that met Hy’s Law criteria. While additional 
data will be gathered post approval as per pharmacovigilance plan potential increases in liver parameters 
are considered manageable for specialists, with frequent liver monitoring as described in the SmPC. The 
long-term safety data on the higher dose is limited. However, this limited data does not suggest an 
overall worse safety profile of the q4w dose regimen compared to the q8w does regimen. The benefit-risk 
balance of guselkumab in PsA is positive for both q4w and q8w dose regimens.

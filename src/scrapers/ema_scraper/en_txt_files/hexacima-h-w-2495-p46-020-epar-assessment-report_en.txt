1. Introduction 
On 30 October 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study A3L40 for Hexaxim/ Hexacima/ 
Hexyon, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk balance for 
Hexaxim™/Hexacima™/Hexyon™ and that no consequential regulatory action is required. 
2. Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that A3L40 “Booster Effect and Safety of a DTaP-IPV-Hib Combined Vaccine, with or 
without Hep B, in Healthy Subjects 11 to 18 Months of Age Who Received a Hexavalent or 
Hexavalent/Pentavalent Combined Vaccine during the Primary Series” is a standalone study. 
This study is the immunogenicity follow-up and booster study for the previously assessed 
study A3L39. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
As in initial MAA 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Hexaxim™/Hexacima™/Hexyon™ is indicated for active immunisation (primary and booster 
vaccination) of infants and toddlers from six weeks of age against diphtheria (D), tetanus (T), 
pertussis, Hepatitis B (Hep B), poliomyelitis and invasive diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae 
type b (Hib). 
The MAH submitted the final report for: 
A3L40:  
“Booster Effect and Safety of a DTaP-IPV-Hib Combined Vaccine, with or without Hep B, in 
Healthy Subjects 11 to 18 Months of Age Who Received a Hexavalent or 
Hexavalent/Pentavalent Combined Vaccine during the Primary Series”  
This clinical study A3L40 is a Phase III long-term antibody persistence and booster effect study and 
was conducted in Czech Republic, Germany and Spain with 663 children who completed a 3-dose 
primary series (DTaPIPV-Hep B-PRP-T or Infanrix™ hexa), concomitantly administered with Prevenar™ 
(PCV7) (3 doses) and Rotateq™ (3 doses) in study A3L39.

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
A3L40: “Booster Effect and Safety of a DTaP-IPV-Hib Combined Vaccine, 
with or without Hep B, in Healthy Subjects 11 to 18 Months of Age Who 
Received a Hexavalent or Hexavalent/Pentavalent Combined Vaccine 
during the Primary Series” 
Description 
Primary immunization (Hexacim or Infanrix hexa both concomitantly given with Prevenar and RotaTeq) 
had been done in study A3L39. Subjects now in this study kept the subject number from A3L39 and 
received a booster vaccination.  Of note is the age of participants in the different groups: Groups 1 + 2 
were~12 months old children whilst in Group 3 the children were ~18 months old. This was due to the 
structure of the different vaccination schedules used in study A3L39.  
Methods 
Study design 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria followed that of the previous studies. Medical history was checked prior 
to inclusion as well as further vaccinations made between studies (HepA vaccination allowed). 
Diary cards were provided. 
Laboratory assays were the same as for the previous studies; analysis was done at the sponsor’s 
laboratory in Swiftwater, USA or at Institute of Child Health in the United Kingdom (University College 
London).

Study population /Sample size 
As this was the extension study of the then not yet analysed A3L39 the group allocation of the subjects 
(G1 and G2 observer-blind in DE and CS, G3 open only in ES) stayed the same for all children 
continuing with this study.  Allocation numbers in DE and CS were requested via IVRS. 
Concomitant use of Prevenar 13 was only done for G1 and G2, for G3 this was optional. 
Vaccination scheme:  
G1: Hexyon + Prevenar13 at 11-15 Month of Age (MoA) 
G2: Infanrix hexa + Prevenar13 at 11-15 MoA 
G3: Pentavac + Prevenar13 at 18 MoA 
The different booster vaccines are due to the previous study’s conduct. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria continue from study A3L39, mainly all subjects are still to be generally 
healthy. Prerequisite was participation in study A3L39. 
Blood draws for immunogenicity were planned for D0 (baseline) and D30 post vaccination. 
Reactogenicity was assessed during the first 7 days after vaccination, unsolicited AEs for 30 days and 
SAEs as well as AESIs during the complete trial duration.

Statistical Methods 
Table 2 Descriptive statistics produced (source: Table 3.6, study report) 
Ab persistence at 11 to 18 months of age following a three-dose primary series vaccination was one of 
the main objectives, the immunogenicity data and group variables from the A3L39 study were used. 
Immunogenicity endpoints were described for available blood samples before the booster dose and 1 
month after the booster dose of either study combined vaccine. The following parameters were used: 
Ab Persistence (Pre-Booster Dose): 
• GM of Ab concentrations/titers before the booster dose (pre-booster dose) for all antigens except 
PCV13 antigens 
• Percentage of subjects with concentrations/titers above predefined thresholds at pre-booster dose, 
including thresholds used to define seroprotection for all antigens except PCV13 antigens 
Booster Effect Post-Vaccination: 
• GM of Ab concentrations/titers after the booster dose (post-booster dose) for all antigens in Groups 1 
and 2 and for all antigens except PCV13 antigens in Group 3 
• GM of individual Ab concentrations/titers ratio post/pre-booster dose for all antigens, except for 
PCV13 antigens 
• Percentage of subjects with concentrations/titers above predefined thresholds at post-booster dose, 
including those thresholds that define seroprotection for all antigens in Groups 1 and 2 and for all 
antigens except PCV13 and Hep B antigens in Group 3 
• Seroconversion rates for PT and FHA antigens 
• Booster vaccine response rate for PT and FHA antigens 
Subjects who received a dose of pneumococcal vaccine between the end of the primary series and 
before the booster dose were excluded from the analysis of PCV13 antigens.

95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated: 
• using the exact binomial method (Clopper-Pearson method) for single proportions 
• using the normal approximation of the Log10 titers, followed by a back transformation for geometric 
mean concentrations/titers (GMCs/GMTs)  
Reverse cumulative distribution curves for each Ab criterion are presented. 
Additionally for each Ab criterion, kinetic curves based on GMC or GMT at each time point were plotted 
including the primary series and booster time points. 
Results 
Number analysed 
There were 662 subjects (99.8%) included in the FAS. 
A total of 648 subjects (97.7%) were included in the FAS for Ab persistence, i.e., 229 subjects 
(97.9%), 224 subjects (97.0%), and 195 subjects (98.5%) in Group 1, 2, and 3, respectively. 
A total of 632 subjects (95.3%) were included in the PP analysis set, i.e., 225 subjects (96.2%) in 
Group 1, 218 subjects (94.4%) in Group 2, and 189 subjects (95.5%) in Group 3. 
After booster injection, 662 subjects (99.8%) were included in the SafAS, i.e., 236 subjects in Group 
1, 228 subjects in Group 2 and 198 subjects in Group 3. 
Male/Female ratio was near 50% in all three groups.  
The mean age of the subjects was 12.4 months (± 0.5 months) in Group 1, 12.5 months (± 0.6 
months) in Group 2 and 18.1 months (± 0.3 months) in Group 3.

Immunogenicity results 
Groups 1+2 (2, 3, 4 months primary immunization) 
Persistence of antibodies was similar in both groups for most antigens. After the booster dose the percentage of subjects achieving the predefined 
seroprotection or seroconversion threshold for each antigen is similar across the groups for most antigens regardless whether Hexyon or Infanrix hexa had 
been used for priming and booster. For HepB and IPV1 the lower titres known from the post primary stage of study A3L39 are continued in the Hexon groups 
ending in statistical significantly lower GMs pre-booster as well as after the booster dose. For HepB the rate of subjects showing seroprotection of 
≥10mIU/ml is ~10% lower in the Hexyon group than in the Infanrix hexa group and for ≥100mIU/ml it is even ~20% lower (<50%). The reverse 
cumulation curve for HepB can be found below in Figure 1; what is important is that both curves follow the same kinetic, both curves show the same fold-
increase of titres and thus a low or negative anti-HBs result does not necessarily indicate lack of immunity in vaccinated persons: it is immune memory that 
matters and an anamnestic response was measured shortly after offering a booster dose.   
Anti-PT GMs are also lower in the Hexyon group but not as pronounced as for HepB and IPV1. A clinically relevant impact is not expected here. 
Details can be found in Table 3, GMTs/GMCs are shown further below in Table 4. 
Serotypes 3, 6B, 7f, 19A, 19F show statistically significantly lower GMs in the Hexyon concomitant use than with Infanrix hexa but the CI are mostly just 
missing the overlap. As the seroprotection rates are similar in both groups no clinical relevance is attributed to this observation. Details can be found in Table 
5 and Table 6.

Group 3 (2,4,6 months primary immunization) – Pentavac+PPV13 
12 months after the primary series HepB antibody titres ≥10 mIU/ml are still seen in 92.4% of the 
subjects of group 3 with a GM of 189 (95%CI: 144; 248). HepB is not included in Pentavac, thus no 
booster effect is measured. 
All other antigens are present in the booster vaccine Pentavac and antibodies rise as expected post 
booster. In comparison with groups 1+2 GMs are widely in the same range, but for individual antigens 
lower or higher in the respective groups without clear relation to the vaccination scheme or vaccine 
used. 
Defined thresholds of protection and seroconversion rates are achieved for all antigens. Details can be 
found in Table 7 and Table 8.

Safety results 
No deaths or other SAEs related to the vaccines were reported. One subject in Group 2 reported 
extensive swelling of the limb after vaccination (Infanrix hexa); the event was resolved after 7 days 
One subject in Group 1 reported leg pain (Grade 1, both legs) within 30 minutes after vaccination; the 
event was resolved after 3 days. 
Otherwise similar event rates were seen for solicited local and systemic events in all groups in known 
frequencies. No safety issues are identified. 
The safety profile remains unchanged. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects  
The data provided show the titres and concentrations following the booster dose of Hexyon versus 
Infanrix hexa with priming Hexyon versus Infanrix hexa and concomitantly used PCV13. 
The seroprotection levels of antibodies against Diphtheria, Tetanus, HepB and Polio are adequate and 
similar to what is known from other vaccines.  
The titres and concentrations of antibodies against all antigens vary significantly only for IPV1 and 
HepB depending on which vaccine has been used for priming and booster. The Infanrix hexa primed 
subjects show statistically significantly higher anti Hep B antibody titres post dose 3 after the primary 
series as well as pre and post booster. However, the general antibody kinetic is identical. Higher anti-
HBs concentrations are known to take longer to decline below the minimum threshold for protection of 
≤ 10mlU/ml. Of note, a low or negative anti-HBs result does not necessarily indicate lack of immunity 
in vaccinated persons: it is immune memory that matters and an anamnestic response was measured 
shortly after offering a booster dose.  The clinical immunogenicity data currently do not necessarily 
suggest a lack of protection. To further investigate the lower anti Hep B antibody titres the applicant 
intents to submit clinical data of study A3L49. This study was conducted in Thailand and recently 
completed. The study evaluates the persistence of Anti-Hep B antibodies at 9 to 10 Years of age in 
subjects having received Hep B Vaccine at birth and a DTaPIPV-Hep B-PRP-T Hexavalent Vaccine at 2, 
4 and 6 Months of Age. Results are not yet available but will be provided as soon as possible. The 
statistically significant lower GMTS for polivirus 1 and 3 are currently not considered of clinical 
relevance. GMTs by far exceeded the threshold of ≥ 8 (1/dil) and a good booster ability has been 
shown. Sufficiently high seroprotection rates have been observed. Comparable results for the polio 
component of DTaPIPV-Hep B-PRP-T have already been observed during licensure. 
The safety profile remains unchanged as no vaccination related SAEs or even deaths occurred during 
this study.

3.  Rapporteur’s conclusion and recommendation 
  Not fulfilled: 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide description of the additional clarifications 
requested per study as part of this procedure. (see section “Additional clarification requested”) 
4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1.  Regarding a potential impact of lower anti HBs antibody titres on the clinical protection against 
Hepatitis B infection the MAH is requested to provide a plan to further evaluate this issue. 
2.  The applicant is further asked to discuss the relevance of statistically significant lower anti-
Polio 1 GMTs pre- and post-booster. 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop. 
5.  MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Question 1 
Regarding a potential impact of lower anti HBs antibody titres on the clinical protection against 
Hepatitis B infection the MAH is requested to provide a plan to further evaluate this issue. 
MAH Response to Question 1 
As pointed out by the reviewer, a low or negative (<10 mIU/mL) anti-HBs result does not necessarily 
indicate a lack of immunity in vaccinated persons. 
The concept that it is immune memory that matters is now largely recognized. The existence of 
persisting immune memory against HBsAg, evidenced by anamnestic response to a booster (challenge) 
vaccination with a Hepatitis B containing vaccine, has been documented on several occasions in 
multiple cohorts of children following infant/toddler primary immunization with several types of 
Hepatitis B containing combination vaccine (pentavalent or hexavalent) and particularly in cohorts in 
which a large proportion of vaccinees presented negative (<10 mIU/mL) anti-HBs results (1-6)1. 
This topic had been in the mind of the MAH since a while, and the plan to address this point has been 
addressed through a clinical trial (A3L492) that has been recently completed in Thailand. 
The MAH plans to submit these data early next year within the context of a labelling variation which, 
among other objectives, will enrich the label with data on persistence of immunity. 
Assessor`s comment: 
The applicant intents to submit results from recently completed clinical trial A3L492 early this year to 
further evaluate the persistence of immunity to HBsAg. The study will evaluate persistence of Anti-Hep 
B Antibodies at 9 to 10 Years of Age in subjects having received Hep B Vaccine at birth and a DTaPIPV-

Hep B-PRP-T Hexavalent Vaccine at 2, 4 and 6 Months of Age. More detailed information regarding 
objectives and trial design of the study were not provided. The submission of the clinical trial data is 
appreciated. Further conclusions will depend on the submitted clinical data. 
Conclusion: 
The issue is solved. 
Question 2 
The applicant is further asked to discuss the relevance of statistically significant lower anti-Polio 1 
GMTs pre- and post-booster. 
MAH Response to Question 2 
For trial A3L40 (as well as for trial A3L39), the immune responses against the poliovirus antigens 
contained in the vaccines have not been used to support pre-specified statistical comparisons, but 
rather to support purely descriptive analysis. The study has not been powered (sample size) for 
assessing the non-inferiority of the poliovirus responses between the two groups (1 and 2), therefore 
all post-hoc statistical comparisons are not relevant. 
Nevertheless, it is true that lower responses against the three poliovirus serotypes have been observed 
during the course of the trial (A3L39 and A3L40) between the DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T 
(Hexyon/Hexacima/Hexaxim) vaccinees and the DTaP-IPV-HB/PRPT~T vaccinees (Infanrix hexa), and 
that these differences were the most marked with poliovirus type 1. 
The clinical relevance of this observation can be analyzed through the following elements: 
• 
• 
It is well established that a level of poliovirus neutralizing antibodies above the threshold of 
1/8 is a good correlate of protection against paralysis (7), and that this parameter is the most 
clinically relevant compared to GMT that can be achieved during the course of immunization. 
The observation that GMT and consequently proportions of subjects with poliovirus neutralizing 
antibodies ≥ 1/8 can decrease from post-dose 3 to the pre-dose 4 (booster) is not new (8), and 
it is known that the type of infant regimen (2,3,4 months of age versus 2,4,6 months of age) is 
a key driver of this observation (9). 
•  While it is true that 83.7 % of the DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T (Hexyon/Hexacima/Hexaxim) vaccinees 
presented poliovirus neutralizing antibodies below the 1/8 threshold before booster (as well as 
93.6% of the Infanrix hexa subjects), and with as expected lower GMT, all of them (except 
one) did develop antibodies above this threshold after booster, indicating a good persisting 
immune memory. Since the early fifties Jonas Salk hypothetized that as immune memory is 
established by primary vaccination, and that no further immunizations (boosters) are 
necessary (10-12). 
• 
In the two countries where the trial has been conducted (Germany and Czech Republic), the 
polio immunization regimen is a "3+1+1" regimen that is to say that a pre-school vaccination 
for boosting immunity against polio is recommended (generally with a DTaP-IPV vaccine). 
Therefore, this will further increase antibodies levels in infants who may have developed the 
lowest level of antibodies following their initial infant/toddler immunization. In addition, in

some circumstances, additional boosters with IPV-containing vaccines may be given in older 
ages with Tdap-IPV or Td-IPV products. 
• 
The current epidemiological data regarding poliovirus circulation (13) do show that the level of 
risk has drastically decreased in all countries. The absence of Sabin-like viruses isolated in 
environmental sampling done in many European countries (indicative of the presence of a low 
number of recently OPV-vaccinees and/ or of recently OPV-vaccinees' contacts), the high polio 
vaccination coverage reached in these countries, and the lowest ever reported number of AFP 
cases (only due to WPV1) in the last two remaining endemic countries (Pakistan and 
Afghanistan) do illustrate this low risk. 
Based on all these elements, the MAH consider this observation as clinically not relevant. 
Assessor`s comment: 
The applicant`s conclusion not considering the finding of statistically significant lower GMTS for 
poliovirus type 1 and 3 as clinical relevant is comprehensible explained. References were provided. The 
conclusion can be agreed upon. 
The GMTs post dose 3 and pre-booster by far exceeded the threshold of ≥ 8 (1/dil) and booster ability 
was shown. Furthermore sufficiently high seroprotection rates were shown.  
Conclusion: 
The issue is solved.

Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Mekinist 
trametinib 
On 23 July 2015 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion 
recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Mekinist. The 
marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Novartis Europharm Ltd. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows2:  
“Trametinib as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation (see sections 4.4 and 
5.1.).  
Trametinib monotherapy has not demonstrated clinical activity in patients who have progressed on a prior 
BRAF inhibitor therapy (see section 5.1).” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 days 
from adoption of the opinion

SmPC, Annex 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
II, Labelling 
granting of the initial Marketing authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Defitelio remains 
positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely 
Page 6/17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
monitored for the following reasons: 
The specific obligation to set up a patient registry to 
investigate long-term safety, health outcomes and patterns 
of utilisation of defibrotide under normal use has not been 
fulfilled and post-marketing experience remains limited, 
particularly with respect to long-term safety. Therefore, the 
CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to collect long-
term safety information about Defitelio, as described in 
annex II.  
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Defitelio, the 
CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional 
renewal application in 5 years time. 
II/0027 
Submission of an update RMP version 4.3 in order to 
28/06/2018 
11/07/2019 
Annex II 
Following the MAH’s request to consider SOB 001as fulfilled 
replace the remaining imposed non-interventional 
PASS (an observational registry, study DF-VOD2013-
03-REG, which aims to record safety and outcome 
data in patients diagnosed with severe VOD following 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) treated or 
not with Defitelio) listed as a category 2 study in the 
RMP (specific obligation 001) by two new specific 
obligations: one to provide comparative safety data 
based on the final results of study 15-007 (a phase 
3, randomised, adaptive study of defibrotide versus 
best supportive care in the prevention of hepatic 
veno-occlusive disease in adult and paediatric 
patients undergoing HSCT); the other to provide 
comparative data on efficacy based on a systematic 
literature reviews and analyses, and on data analysis 
from Center for International Blood and Marrow 
Transplant Research (CIBMTR) for patients treated 
and not treated with defibrotide. The Annex II.E of 
as this non-interventional PASS was considered by the MAH 
as no longer feasible in its current form due to ethical 
concerns in recruiting patients to the control arm, the 
CHMP concluded that based on the data provided, the 
currently available clinical study and post-marketing data 
cannot be considered as having adequately address the 
outstanding specific obligation for Defitelio. Therefore the 
current SOB 001 is being replaced by two new SOBs: an 
ongoing randomised phase 3 trial of Defitelio against best 
supportive care for prevention of VOD in patients (adults 
and paediatrics) undergoing HSCT (study 15-007) in order 
to collect comparative safety data and a systematic 
literature review, in conjunction with a data analyses from 
international blood and marrow transplantation registries, 
to collect comparative efficacy data.

SmPC, 
Based on the results of the open label treatment IND study, 
to update the frequencies of adverse reactions 
included in the tabulated list of adverse reactions 
and to update the clinical efficacy and safety 
information based on the results from study 2006-05 
listed as category 3 in the risk management plan 
(RMP). This is a phase 3, open-label expanded 
access study designed to provide access to 
defibrotide as an investigational new drug to patients 
with severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease. The final 
study report has been submitted. The RMP (version 
3.4) and package leaflet are updated accordingly. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to bring the 
Labelling and 
the complete response by Day+100 has been revised to 
PL 
39.3% (201/512) and the survival has been revised to 
49.5% (*Kaplan Meier estimates for time-to-event analysis 
by Day+100) in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
In addition, the frequencies of the adverse drug reactions 
have been revised. In section 4.8 of the SmPC, the 
tabulated list of adverse reactions incorporates the adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs) observed in study 2005-01 [ADR = 
any event reported as possibly related on at least two 
occasions] and treatment emergent adverse events

SmPC and 
In vitro studies demonstrate that 93% of Defitelio is bound 
based on information from a pharmacokinetic study 
in patients with renal impairment. Further, 
corrections to existing information on plasma protein 
binding and excretion of defibrotide are introduced in 
section 5.2 of the SmPC. In addition, the Marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to 
bring the SmPC and Annex II in line with the latest 
QRD template version 9.1. Moreover, section 6.4 of 
the SmPC has been amended to comply with QRD 
template and CHMP guideline on declaration of 
storage conditions. 
Annex II 
to plasma proteins. 
After administration of the therapeutic dose (6.25 mg/kg) 
to healthy subjects, an average of 9.48% of the total dose 
administered is excreted in urine as unchanged defibrotide 
in 24 hours, with the majority excreted during the first 
collection interval of 0-4 hours (approximately 98%). 
Accumulation of defibrotide over 4 doses was not found. 
Difference in exposure is not considered clinically relevant 
and so dose adjustment is not required for patients with 
renal impairment or who are on intermittent haemodialysis. 
Defibrotide is not removed by dialysis.

The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) applied for an extension of the indication for the treatment of 
schizoaffective disorder. Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of sections 4.1, 4.2, and 5.1 of the 
SmPC to reflect also on the data from the long-term study on paliperidone palmitate effects in the 
maintenance of symptom control. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet. 
Furthermore, the MAH proposed minor editorial changes throughout the PI. 
The variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package 
Leaflet. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/149/2009 on the granting of a product-specific waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Invega tablets contain the active substance paliperidone, an antipsychotic substance that is the active 
9-hydroxy-metabolite of risperidone. Janssen-Cilag International NV submits a Type II Variation for 
Invega prolonged release tablets 1.5, 3, 6, 9, and 12 mg concerning a fulfillment of a previously agreed 
post-authorisation measure (MEA 012.1) with a proposal for a modification of the schizoaffective disorder 
indication.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No updated Environmental Risk Assessment has been submitted. The applicant has argued that no 
significant increase in drug usage of INVEGA prolonged-release tablets is anticipated in relation to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213560/2015  
Page 5/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
broadening of the current schizoaffective disorder indication (psychotic and manic symptoms) to include 
depressive symptoms. Little is known about the incidence, prevalence, and demographic factors 
associated with schizoaffective disorders specifically, partially due to the different definitions used in the 
various studies. As many studies of schizophrenia include patients with schizoaffective disorders, there is 
a large degree of overlap in the literature. Therefore, some of the epidemiologic data on schizophrenia 
may be applicable to patients with schizoaffective disorders. As a consequence, it is highly likely that the 
previous estimates for drug usage in schizophrenia have included usage in schizoaffective disorder. As 
such, it has been agreed that the approval of this application is not expected to impact the total 
environmental impact to paliperidone, and no update to the Environmental Risk Assessment dossier has 
been considered necessary for the product. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The broadening of the INVEGA schizoaffective indication to include treatment of the depressive symptoms 
of schizoaffective disorder in addition to the currently approved psychotic and maniac domains is not 
expected to cause a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of Invega. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Following the CHMP assessment of the application for the indication schizoaffective disorder approved in 
April 2011, the MAH committed to provide a long-term maintenance study on paliperidone palmitate and 
to submit relevant pharmacokinetic data on switching from oral paliperidone to paliperidone palmitate as 
a post-authorization measure. The applicant submitted to the CHMP a draft protocol for the long-term 
maintenance study R092670-SCA-3004 (SCA-3004. Following assessment, the protocol was adopted by 
CHMP (EMEA/H/C/746-MEA-012.1) on 18 August 2011. As there were no pharmacokinetic evaluations in 
the study SCA-3004, a pharmacokinetic report was requested by the CHMP to evaluate the similarity of 
the pharmacokinetics of plasma paliperidone after treatment with paliperidone prolonged-release tablets 
and paliperidone palmitate long-acting injection. 
With the current submission of the results of study SCA-3004 and PK data the commitment is considered 
fulfilled. 
The results of study SCA-3004 are also intended to support broadening of the INVEGA schizoaffective 
indication, to include treatment of the depressive symptoms of schizoaffective disorder, and to update 
maintenance data on the basis that Study SCA-3004 was a long-term maintenance study including a 15 
months double-blind relapse prevention period. Also a summary of the study SCA-3004 is proposed to be 
added to the PI. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
In order to support the extrapolation of effect data between formulations a meta-analysis was conducted 
to compare the plasma paliperidone exposure after administration of paliperidone palmitate LAI (studies 
PSY-3005 and PSY-3007) with the exposure observed after daily administration of corresponding doses of 
paliperidone PR (study SCH-201). Population PK modeling techniques were applied to support the 
comparison.

Figure 1 and Figure 2 illustrates the comparability in exposure following 6 mg OD oral dose and 75 mg IM 
every 28 days and 12 mg OD oral dose and 150 mg every 28 days respectively. Graphs A and B are VPCs 
illustrating the model fit. Figure 2 shows the simulated comparability of high and low doses of 
paliperidone PR vs paliperidone palmitate LAI.

Additional simulations have been performed in which switching from oral paliperidone PR to paliperidone 
palmitate LAI was addressed. Oral paliperidone PR has a half-life of around 25 hours. During the first 
week of initiation with paliperidone palmitate LAI, drug concentrations from the oral paliperidone PR will 
decline within the first week. Therefore, the loading dose of 100 mg eq. paliperidone palmitate LAI on Day 
8 would still be needed to maintain the paliperidone concentrations within therapeutic range when 
switching from oral paliperidone PR. Figure 3 demonstrates that when patients are switched from the 
recommended 6 mg paliperidone PR dose to paliperidone palmitate LAI using the recommended 
Day1/Day8 initiation regimen, drug concentrations are maintained during the first week after switching.

patients stabilized on oral paliperidone PR and continuing oral therapy. (A) Hatched area 
represents patients switched to paliperidone palmitate LAI on Day -1 using the Day 1/Day 8 
initiation. (B) Hatched area represents patients switched to paliperidone palmitate LAI on Day 
1 using a single initiation dose alone 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Paliperidone is a selective blocking agent of monoamine effects, whose pharmacological properties are 
different from that of traditional neuroleptics. Paliperidone binds strongly to serotonergic 5-HT2- and 
dopaminergic D2-receptors. Paliperidone also blocks alfa1-adrenergic receptors and blocks, to a lesser 
extent, H1-histaminergic and alfa2-adrenergic receptors. The pharmacological activity of the 
(+)- and (-)-paliperidone enantiomers are qualitatively and quantitatively similar. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The population pharmacokinetic model appears to be adequately validated to use in simulations and the 
claim that similar steady state exposures are achieved with oral paliperidone PR and paliperidone 
palmitate LAI is supported. It would have been valuable to see the exposure during a dosing interval for 
the oral formulation at steady state. However, given the considerable accumulation it appears unlikely 
that the Cmax/Ctrough ratio at steady state is of clinical significance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213560/2015  
Page 9/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The recommended dosing during a switch between oral paliperidone PR and paliperidone palmitate LAI is 
also supported by the present model. While the proposed dosing results in temporarily higher exposures 
for patients switching from a maintenance treatment of 3 mg oral paliperidone PR, the possibility to 
individualize the dosing, as stated in the current SmPC, appears adequate. 
No new data regarding drug-drug interactions for the potentially new patient population has been 
submitted. Given the known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of paliperidone this appears 
to be acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
The main study SCA-3004 was not designed to assess a dose-response of the efficacy of paliperidone 
palmitate. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
 Study R092670-SCA-3004: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 
paliperidone palmitate evaluating time to relapse in subjects with schizoaffective disorder” 
Study SCA-3004 was a Phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
international, multicentre study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PP1M (long-acting 
injectable formulation of paliperidone palmitate), as monotherapy or as an adjunct to mood stabilizers or 
antidepressants (continue their pre-study stable doses of mood stabilizers or antidepressants), relative to 
placebo in subjects with schizoaffective disorder. This was the first controlled maintenance study of an 
atypical long-acting injectable antipsychotic in subjects with schizoaffective disorder.  
The study was a post-authorization measure for the approval of the schizoaffective indication for INVEGA 
tablets (EMEA/H/C/746/II/0023), requested by the CHMP in April 2011. The Company submitted a draft 
protocol for study R092670-SCA-3004 for assessment and the protocol was adopted by CHMP 
(EMEA/H/C/746-MEA-012.1). The results of study R092670-SCA-3004 are also intended to support an 
amendment of the PI for Invega with a broadening of the existing indication for schizoaffective disorder 
to include both psychotic and manic domains as well as depressive symptoms of schizoaffective disorder. 
Methods 
Study participants 
Patients were enrolled from 31 sites in the United States, 19 sites in Romania, 14 sites in India, 13 sites 
in the Ukraine, 6 sites in Bulgaria, 3 sites in Malaysia, 4 sites in the Philippines, and 5 sites in the Republic 
of South Africa. A total of 921 subjects were screened, 667 subjects were enrolled in the open-label 
Lead-in period, and 432 subjects entered the open-label Stabilization period. Of the 432 subjects who 
entered the open-label Stabilization period, 334 subjects were randomized to the double-blind Relapse 
Prevention period (170 subjects to the placebo group and 164 subjects to the paliperidone palmitate 
group). 
To be enrolled the patients should be male or female, above18 years of age and have a lifetime and 
current diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV-TR 295.70), as confirmed by the Structured Clinical 
Interview for DSM-IV Disorders (Clinician’s Version) (SCID) at screening. Ninety-five percent of the 
randomized subjects also met the DSM-5 diagnosis criteria based on investigators’ assessments following 
the release of DSM-5 in May 2013. Subjects must have been experiencing an acute exacerbation of 
psychotic symptoms no less than 4 days and no more than 4 weeks in duration prior to screening, 
showing a score of ≥4 on at least 3 of the following 9 items from the PANSS: Delusions, Conceptual 
Disorganization, Hallucinatory Behaviour, Excitement, Suspiciousness/Persecution, Hostility, Tension, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213560/2015  
Page 10/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Uncooperativeness, and Poor Impulse Control. Furthermore, subjects were to have prominent mood 
symptoms, with a score of ≥16 on the YMRS and/or a score of ≥16 on the HAM-D-21 at screening. 
To be eligible for randomization to the double-blind Relapse Prevention period, subjects were required to 
have a PANSS total score ≤70, and YMRS and HAM-D-21 ≤12 at each visit during the 12-week 
Stabilization period.  
Among the exclusion criteria were subjects who met the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder, 
bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia; had an Axis II diagnosis of Mental Retardation or Borderline 
Personality Disorder; met the DSM-IV criteria for substance dependence (except for nicotine and caffeine 
dependence) in the 3 months before the screening visit; or had attempted suicide within 12 months 
before the screening visit or were at imminent risk of suicide or violent behavior according to the 
investigator’s clinical judgment. For a complete list of exclusion criteria see study protocol. 
Treatments 
With the exception of study medication and approved rescue medications, no psychotropic medications 
were to be initiated during the course of the study. Other medications for treatment of emerging illnesses 
that began after study entry were allowed at the discretion of the investigator. 
Continuation of ongoing therapy with either mood stabilizers (lithium, valproate, or lamotrigine) or 
antidepressants (except monoamine oxidase inhibitors) was permitted. Subjects in the adjunctive 
therapy group must have been on generally stable doses of mood stabilizers or antidepressants for at 
least 30 days prior to screening (eg, no more than 5 daily doses differing from the subject’s usual dose 
within 30 days prior to screening). These subjects were to continue on these mood stabilizers or 
antidepressants throughout the study. Subjects in the study drug monotherapy group must have been 
essentially free of mood stabilizers or antidepressants for 30 days prior to screening (eg, no more than 5 
daily doses of either mood stabilizers or antidepressants within 30 days prior to screening). These 
subjects were on study drug monotherapy throughout the study. 
Subjects receiving therapy with both mood stabilizers and antidepressants were excluded from entering 
the study. Initiation of new therapy with mood stabilizers or antidepressants was not allowed. The 
enrollment of subjects who were taking mood stabilizers or antidepressants versus those taking none was 
monitored. Subjects being treated with lithium and/or valproate had blood samples taken for the 
assessment of these plasma levels at time points specified in the protocol. 
Recommended therapeutic plasma levels are 0.6-1.2 mEq/L for lithium and 50-125 μg/mL for valproate. 
Subjects who were given stable doses of lithium and/or valproate, but their plasma levels were outside 
the therapeutic range, were allowed to enter the study. The dose of lithium and valproate may have been 
adjusted, if necessary, to maintain therapeutic blood levels. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of paliperidone palmitate compared 
with placebo in the delay of relapse of the symptoms of schizoaffective disorder and to assess the safety 
and tolerability of paliperidone palmitate in subjects with schizoaffective disorder. 
The key secondary objective of this study was to evaluate change in subject functioning using the 
Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) during the double-blind Relapse Prevention period with 
paliperidone palmitate compared with placebo. 
The other secondary objectives of this study were: 
▪ To evaluate symptom change as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total 
and PANSS factor scores during the double-blind Relapse Prevention period with paliperidone palmitate 
compared with placebo 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213560/2015  
Page 11/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
▪ To evaluate illness severity change as measured by Clinical Global Impression of Severity for 
Schizoaffective Disorder (CGI-S-SCA) during the double-blind Relapse Prevention period with 
paliperidone palmitate compared with placebo 
▪ To evaluate change in subject medication satisfaction using the Medication Satisfaction 
Questionnaire during the double-blind Relapse Prevention period with paliperidone palmitate 
compared with placebo 
▪ To evaluate change in mood symptoms as measured by Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 21-item version (HAM-D-21), and HAM-D, 17-item version 
(HAM-D-17; the first 17 items from the HAM-D-21) during the double-blind Relapse Prevention 
period with paliperidone palmitate compared with placebo 
▪ To explore the consistency of treatment effect across subjects receiving paliperidone palmitate as 
monotherapy and as an adjunct to mood stabilizers or antidepressants during the double-blind 
Relapse Prevention period 
▪ To explore symptom change (ie, PANSS, YMRS, HAM-D-21, HAM-D-17), illness severity 
(CGI-S-SCA), subject functioning (PSP) and medication satisfaction (MSQ) with paliperidone 
palmitate during the Lead-in and Stabilization periods 
▪ To explore the overall healthcare resource utilization using the Resource Utilization Questionnaire 
during the double-blind Relapse Prevention period with paliperidone palmitate compared 
with placebo 
▪ To evaluate and explore genetic markers associated with paliperidone efficacy, safety and tolerability 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy Criteria (Relapse Criteria) 
The primary efficacy end point for the SCA-3004 study was the time between subject randomization 
to treatment and the first occurrence of a relapse during the Relapse Prevention period. 
Relapse was defined as the first occurrence of ANY ONE of the following: 
▪ Psychiatric hospitalization due to worsening symptoms (including ER visit ≥23 hours, and not including 
hospitalizations for social reasons) 
▪ Any intervention employed to avert imminent hospitalization due to worsening symptoms 
(eg, increase in the level of psychiatric care from office visit to day hospitalization [not including increased 
level of care for social reasons], or need for additional antipsychotic, 
antidepressants, or mood stabilizing medication) Deliberate self-injury, suicidal or homicidal ideation that 
is clinically significant as determined by the investigator, or violent behavior resulting in clinically 
significant injury to another person or property damage 
▪ Worsening of any one or more of the following PANSS items: P1 (delusions), P2 (conceptual 
disorganization), P3 (hallucinatory behavior), P4 (Excitement), P6 (suspiciousness/persecution), P7 
(hostility), G8 (uncooperativeness), or G14 (Poor Impulse Control) to a score of ≥6 after randomization 
if the score on the corresponding item was ≤4 at randomization 
▪ Worsening, as specified below, in any of the following measures at two consecutive visits.

(moderately ill or worse) 
Key secondary endpoint 
Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) 
The PSP scale was designed to assess the degree of dysfunction a subject exhibits during the month prior 
to the visit within 4 domains of behavior: a) socially useful activities, b) personal and social relationships, 
c) self-care, and d) disturbing and aggressive behavior. The results of the assessment are converted to a 
numerical score following the PSP scoring guideline. A score lying between 71 and 100 indicates a good 
functioning; one between 31 and 70 indicates varying degrees of difficulty, and a subject with a score of 
≤30 has functioning so poor that he or she requires intensive supervision. 
Other secondary endpoints 
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 
The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, 
grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 
30 symptoms are rated, at the time of the visit and for the week prior to the visit, on a 7-point scale that 
ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). This scale has been shown to be sensitive to 
medication treatment, provide a balanced representation of positive and negative symptoms, and gauge 
their relationship to one another and to global psychopathology. 
Clinical Global Impression of Severity for Schizoaffective Disorder (CGI-S-SCA) 
The CGI-S-SCA is a syndrome-specific 7-point scale (from 1 indicating not ill to 7 indicating 
very severely ill) that includes an overall severity score as well as scores for the positive, negative, manic, 
and depressive domains of the illness. The CGI-S-SCA is used to assess the 
level of overall impairment, as well as that related to each domain, at the time of the visit and for 
the week prior to the visit. 
Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-21) 
The HAM-D-21 is a 21-item, clinician-rated scale to evaluate depressed mood as well as the 
vegetative and cognitive symptoms of depression. The items are rated, at the time of the visit and 
for the week prior to the visit, on either a 5-point (0 to 4) or a 3-point (0 to 2) scale. The 5-point 
scale items use a rating of 0 (absent), 1 (doubtful to mild), 2 (mild to moderate), 3 (moderate to 
severe), and 4 (very severe). A rating of 4 is usually reserved for extreme symptoms. The 3-point 
scale items use a rating of 0 (absent), 1 (probable), and 2 (definite). 
Rating scale for depression (HAM-D-17) 
The HAM-D-17 is based on the first 17 items of the HAM-D-21 rating scale.

Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) 
The YMRS was designed to measure the severity of manic symptoms and to gauge the effect of 
treatment on mania severity. It can also be used to detect a return of manic symptoms (eg, 
relapse or recurrence). The YMRS is a checklist of 11 items that are ranked, at the time of the 
visit and for the week prior to the visit, on a scale of 0 to 4 or 0 to 8. Seven of the items are 
ranked 0 to 4 and have descriptors associated with each severity level (ie, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). Four of 
the items (irritability, speech, content, and disruptive-aggressive behavior) are scored 0 to 8 and 
have descriptors for every other increment (ie, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8) to allow for the poor cooperation 
seen in severely ill subjects. 
Sample size 
The sample size calculations for this study were based on information from previous studies of 
paliperidone palmitate, paliperidone ER, and Risperdal CONSTA in schizoaffective disorder, 
schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder (CSR R076477-SCA-3001 2008, CSR R076477-SCA-3002 2008, CSR 
R076477-SCH-301 2006, CSR R092670-PSY-3001 2009, RIS-BIP-302 2008, RIS-BIM-3003 2008). 
With these assumptions, it was planned to randomize 286 subjects in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
paliperidone palmitate or placebo to obtain at least 95 relapses (events) to show that paliperidone 
palmitate was significantly different from placebo at the 2 sided significance level of 0.05, with 
90% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.51 based on an estimated 12-month relapse rate of 
approximately 50% in the placebo group and 30% in the paliperidone palmitate group. 
It was assumed that approximately 45% of the subjects who entered the open-label Lead-in period while 
being treated with paliperidone palmitate would not meet the stabilization criteria at the end of the 
Stabilization period for randomization in the double-blind Relapse Prevention period. To meet the 
expected number of 286 subjects (143 per group) randomized in the double blind Relapse Prevention 
period, a total of at least 520 subjects were to be enrolled in the open label Lead-in period. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was not employed in the screening or open-label Lead-in or open-label Stabilization 
periods. At the start of the double-blind Relapse Prevention period on Day 176, enrolled patients were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive placebo or paliperidone palmitate based on a 
computer-generated stratified randomization schedule prepared at J&JPRD before initiation of the study. 
The randomization was balanced by using permuted blocks of 4 patients per block and was stratified by 
study center and by treatment with or without adjunctive mood stabilizers or antidepressants. Central 
randomization was implemented for this study. An Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) or 
Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) were used to randomly assign subjects to study treatment, 
dispense study drug, and to track subject dose changes.  
Medication code numbers were preprinted on the study drug labels and assigned as subjects qualified for 
the study and were randomly assigned to treatment.  
Blinding (masking) 
Placebo for every active dose was prepared to matching size pre-filled syringes. The active and placebo 
drugs differed slightly in appearance. Therefore, to maintain the blind, both paliperidone palmitate and 
placebo study drug were wrapped so the content was not visible to either the blinded study drug 
administrator or the subject. Injections were administered by the blinded study drug administrator.  
During the double-blind period of the study, prolactin levels were not available to the investigators, site 
personnel, or the sponsor, as knowledge of these levels could have potentially unblinded the treatment 
group to which the subject was assigned.

Statistical methods 
The primary population for efficacy was the double-blind ITT analysis set which included all randomized 
subjects who received at least one injection of double-blind study medication. 
The primary efficacy null hypothesis was that there is no difference in the distribution of time to relapse 
between the paliperidone palmitate and placebo groups during the Relapse Prevention period. Treatment 
differences were compared using a log-rank test stratified by concomitant medication stratum (treatment 
with mood stabilizers or antidepressants or no such treatment). Subjects who met at least 1 of the criteria 
for relapse while on double-blind treatment at the time of or before study completion for the primary 
analysis were considered to have had an event. All other subjects without documentation of relapse for 
the primary analysis were censored at the time of last study drug administration or the last visit date. This 
included also subjects who died while on study drug. 
The cumulative distribution function of the time to relapse was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. 
The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the median relapse rates, as well as the relapse rates at 3 months, 
6 months, 9 months, 1 year, and at 15 months were provided. Standard Error (SE) estimates were based 
on Greenwood’s formula. The hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval was estimated using the Cox 
proportional hazards model with factor concomitant medication stratum. In addition, time to relapse was 
examined within each of the two concomitant medication stratum (treatment with MS/AD or no such 
treatment). In addition, a Cox proportional hazards model was extended to include 3 types of mood 
events: manic, depressive and mixed. Test of hypotheses for any difference in risk of relapse in mood 
event types was examined by the Global Competing Risk test. An additional analysis was carried out for 
time to early discontinuation for any reason including relapse using a methodology similar to the primary 
efficacy analysis. 
The key secondary endpoint, change from double-blind baseline in PSP score, was analyzed using a mixed 
model repeated measures (MMRM) Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model. Robustness and consistency 
of findings at the Month 15 end point was assessed through a number of supportive and sensitivity 
analyses (pattern mixture model, tipping-point analysis, and pattern mixture modeling with multiple 
imputation). 
The overall type I error rate for testing the primary efficacy endpoint and the key secondary efficacy 
endpoint was controlled at the 2-sided 0.05 significance level using a fixed sequence gatekeeper 
approach. Time to first relapse was tested first, followed by change from baseline in PSP. No further 
adjustments for multiplicity were planned. 
Other secondary efficacy end points (PANSS [total, factor scores, and subscales], HAM-D-21, YMRS, and 
CGI-S-SCA) were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model using both Last Observation 
Carried Forward (LOCF) and observed cases. The model included treatment, concomitant medication 
stratum, and country as fixed-effect design factors, and corresponding baseline scale score as a 
covariate.  
Efficacy and safety summaries for the open-label periods were based on the open-label intent to treat 
(ITT) analysis set, which included all subjects who received at least one injection of open-label study 
drug. The change from open-label baseline during the open-label treatment period for efficacy variables 
was summarized descriptively and examined using paired t-tests. These summaries were repeated for 
those subjects who were on monotherapy and adjunctive therapy.

Results 
A total of 667 subjects were enrolled into the open-label period, 347 subjects received paliperidone 
palmitate as adjunctive therapy to mood stabilizers or antidepressants and 320 subjects received 
paliperidone palmitate as monotherapy. Of the 667 subjects enrolled, 432 subjects entered the 
Stabilization period and 334 of these subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either placebo 
(170 subjects) or to continue receiving paliperidone palmitate (164 subjects) in the double-blind  
Relapse Prevention period. The majority of subjects enrolled in the open-label period were white 
(53.1%). There were a higher percentage of male (53.5%) subjects than female (46.5%) subjects and 
the mean age was 39.5 years (range: 19 to 66 years). The demographic and baseline characteristics of 
the 334 subjects randomized to the double-blind Relapse Prevention period were similar to those 
described for subjects enrolled in the open-label period. The most common reason for discontinuation 
among all open-label subjects was withdrawal of consent (14.7%). Additional reasons for discontinuation 
in >5% of subjects included adverse events (7.5%), failure of criteria to enter the Stabilization period 
(7.0%), loss to follow-up (6.3%), and failure of criteria to enter the double-blind Relapse Prevention 
period (5.2%). During the double-blind period, the most common reason for discontinuation in both the 
placebo and paliperidone palmitate groups was withdrawal of consent, 17.6% and 11.6%, respectively. A 
greater proportion of subjects in the paliperidone palmitate group (7.3%) discontinued the study due to 
an adverse event compared to subjects in the placebo group (1.8%). A diagram of the participant flow is 
shown below:

Participant flow 
More subjects in the paliperidone palmitate, 59.9% (100/164), than in the placebo group 38.2% 
(65/170) completed the study. The difference in the number of subjects discontinuing early was foremost 
due to the difference in the number of subjects experiencing a relapse. The most prominent other reasons 
for early discontinuations were, in both groups, withdrawal of consent besides lost to follow-up in the 
placebo group and adverse events in the active group. While reason for early withdrawals has been 
summarized, the CHMP requested the applicant to provide the median follow-up (and range) in the 
double-blind period of the study. 
While both the mean and the median was approximately 9 months in the placebo arm, mean exposure in 
the paliperidone palmitate arm was 11 months with a median of >14 months mirroring that 61% 
(100/164) completed the study (i.e. the 15 month treatment period) in the paliperidone palmitate group 
to be compared to 38.2% (65/170) in the placebo arm. The difference between the groups was, as

already concluded, mainly due to the difference in relapse pattern. Regarding time to withdrawal of 
consent (the most prominent reason for early discontinuation besides relapse), both the mean and 
median was similar in both groups but concerned more subjects in the placebo arm, 30/170 (17.6%), 
than in the active arm, 19/164 (11.6%). The CHMP considered that the median follow-up time for each 
treatment arm had been clarified. 
Recruitment 
Conduct of the study 
There were 4 amendments to the protocol. The original protocol issued on 24 November 2009. 
The first amendment (INT-1; 24 March 2010) included the following changes: 
- PANSS component of the stabilization criteria was changed from PANSS total score ≤65 to 
PANSS total score ≤70); 
- Clarify that the timeframe in which subjects must be experiencing an acute exacerbation of psychotic 
symptoms is in relation to “screening” and not “enrollment”; 
- Laboratory tests added to criteria for “subjects must be healthy” to provide consistency between 
screening procedures and Inclusion Criterion #9; 
- Phenylcyclohexylpiperidine (PCP) was added to the list of drugs included in the urine drug screen to be 
consistent with past paliperidone ER studies of schizoaffective disorder; 
- Revised Exclusion Criterion #17 to allow entry of subjects who had previous treatment with low dose 
clozapine used for treatment of insomnia; 
- Revised relapse criteria as follows: “An increase of ≥25% in total PANSS score from randomization if the 
score at randomization was >45” and “A ≥10 point increase in total 
PANSS score from randomization if the score at randomization was ≤ 45”; 
- Clarified relapse criteria to specify worsening of one or more of the 8 individual PANSS items and 
increase of ≥ 2 points if the score at randomization was 1 (not ill) to 3 (mildly ill) or Increase of ≥ 1 point 
if the score at randomization was ≥4 (moderately ill or worse); 
- Assessment of tobacco use every 12 weeks was added; 
- Clarification that the MSQ will be administered by a study staff member; 
- Clarification that Vital sign evaluation will consist of body temperature, sitting systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure and pulse; 
- Added hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) lab testing to randomization visit and end of study visit; 
- Clarification that any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must be promptly withdrawn from 
the study; 
- HAM-D-21 form in Attachment 6 was replaced with the correct HAM-D-21 form; 
- Corrections to the anchoring scores of the YMRS Items 1-6, 8 and 9; 
- Replaced the RUQ with the correct version; 
- and some minor editorial changes. 
The protocol changes defined in the second amendment (INT-2; 03 May 2010) included the 
following changes: 
- Change to the dose administration regimen for Day 36 (Week 5). The 117 mg (75 mg eq.) dose was 
changed to a flexible dose. This allows titration to an optimally efficacious and tolerable dose that will 
control an acute exacerbation of a subject’s schizoaffective disorder; 
- Extension of the window around the second injection (Day 8) of paliperidone palmitate from 
±2 days to ±4 days to allow more scheduling flexibility; 
- The statement about 13 weeks being needed to reach an upper limit of dose was deleted as it was only 
applicable when the Day 36 dose was 117 mg and not when the Day 36 dose was made flexible; 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213560/2015  
Page 18/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Clarification that serious adverse events will be reported within 30 days after the last visit, whenever 
that occurs; 
- Change made that all sites will now be provided with an electrocardiogram device with required supplies 
by a central vendor; 
- Clarification that data that could be entered directly into the eCRF includes the CGI-S-SCA, 
HAM-D-21, PANSS, and YMRS data; 
- Statement added that backup paper source documents for the scale assessment data should be used 
and then transcribed into the eDC as soon as the system becomes available. 
The protocol changes defined in the third amendment (INT-3; 04 January 2011) included the following: 
- Additional analysis of the long-term antidepressants effects of paliperidone palmitate to be performed at 
the request of the European Regulatory Authority using the HAM-D-17, which is the first 17 items in the 
currently collected HAM-D-21. In addition, switch-to-depression, worsening of preexisting depression, 
and de novo depression will be evaluated at the request of the European Regulatory Authority; 
- Change in the upper limit of age for inclusion in the study has been removed to allow for evaluation of 
efficacy and safety in subjects older than 65 years of age made at the request of the European Regulatory 
Authority; 
- Modification of inclusion criterion 6, Added Conceptual Disorganization (P2) and 
Suspiciousness/Persecution (P6), to increase the generalizability of the study population; 
- Clarification of adjunctive therapy including stable dose definition and addition of definition for 
essentially free of mood stabilizers or antidepressants use to allow for subjects with limited use of mood 
stabilizers or antidepressants within 30 days prior to screening to be enrolled in the monotherapy group; 
- At the request of the European Regulatory Authority, additional analysis were carried out for time to 
early discontinuation of study medication during the double-blind period for any reason including relapse 
(not including termination of the study by the sponsor) and for any reason not including relapse; 
- minor editorial changes. 
The protocol changes defined in the fourth amendment (INT-4; 14 January 2011) were generated to 
document that after further review of the European Commission's guidance document, it was determined 
that the changes made in amendment INT-3 should be considered substantial. 
A description of the specific changes in applicable sections and rationale for each of the 
4 amendments is presented in the protocol amendments section of the protocol (Appendix 1). 
In addition, the PSP was declared as a key secondary efficacy variable in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) 
submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 29 August 2013 (Serial Number 425).  
Baseline data 
Open label period 
Demographic characteristics for subjects in the open-label ITT analysis set are summarized in Table 1 and 
baseline social demographics are summarized in Table 2. 
The majority of all open-label subjects were White (53.1%). There were more male (53.5%) than female 
(46.5%) subjects in the open-label ITT population, and the mean age was 39.5 years (range: 19 to 66 
years). Based on BMI, 34.9% of subjects were classified as having normal body weight, 31.2% of subjects 
were overweight, and 33.9% were obese. 
The majority of all open-label subjects (61.8%) had completed a level of education up to high school or 
equivalent and were not employed (68.2%) (Table 2). Most subjects (66.4%) were living in a private 
residence with a spouse, domestic partner, family, or caregiver. In general, the demographic 
characteristics and the baseline social demographcis were well balanced between the active and placebo 
groups. A sufficient number of subjects from the SEU were included in Study SCA-3004.

The psychiatric history of subjects in the open-label ITT population 
For all open-label subjects, the mean age of first psychiatric diagnosis was 26.1 years and mean age of 
first pharmacological treatment for psychiatric symptoms was 26.6 years. The mean age of first 
schizoaffective diagnosis was 31.5 years. Most subjects (99.0%) had a pre-existing schizoaffective 
diagnosis prior to screening. The majority of subjects (64.5%) had a diagnosis of bipolar subtype of 
schizoaffective disorder confirmed by SCID and 24.3% of subjects had history of prior suicide attempt. 
The mean number of known psychiatric hospitalizations was 4.8 (median of 3.0) and the mean number of 
psychiatric hospitalizations in the past 12 months was 0.6. Of the 667 enrolled subjects, 200 subjects 
were inpatients at the time of screening. At screening, 48.0% of subjects had a depressive mood episode, 
26.8% of subjects had a manic mood episode, and 25.2% of subjects had a mixed mood episode. For 
additional details on the psychiatric history, see Table 6 in the CSR. 
Baseline symptoms 
The mean and median baseline symptom scores for each scale assessment were similar among subjects 
in the adjunctive therapy and monotherapy groups (For details see Table 7 in the CSR). At baseline, the 
mean PANSS total score was 85.8 for all open-label subjects. Based on CGI-S-SCA overall score, most 
subjects were moderately ill (57.7%) or markedly ill (37.6%) at baseline. The mean baseline PSP score 
Assessment report

was 51.4 with 93.3% of subjects classified as variable functioning impairment, 4.5% of subjects classified 
as poor functioning, and 2.2% of subjects classified as good functioning. 
The most common used class of psychotropic medication was the atypical antipsychotics which were used 
by 73.3 % of all open-label subjects. The psychotropic medications taken by subjects at baseline (taken 
within 7 days prior to first injection) are summarized in Table 3. At baseline, 104 open-label subjects 
(15.6 %) were not taking any psychotropic medication. The most commonly used class of psychotropic 
medication was the atypical antipsychotics (57.1 % of all open-label subjects). Of subjects on mood 
stabilizers or antiepileptics in the adjunctive therapy stratum, 54.2 % were on mood stabilizers or 
antiepileptics and 46.7 % were on antidepressants. 
Table 3.  Baseline psychotropic medications - OL ITT Analysis Set (Study R092670-SCA-3004). 
Note: Percentages are based on the number of subjects in the OL ITT population. Psychotropic medication class is 
based on SAP defined classes. Medications are coded to generic name using the WHO Drug Dictionary, version 
01SEP2012 classic. A subject taking more than one medication in the same class or coding to the same generic name 
is counted only once within that class. Baseline medications are defined as medications present within 7 days prior to 
first injection date. Paliperidone taken for oral tolerability testing during screening is not included.

Concomitant psychotropic medications taken during the open-label period are provided in Table 4. With 
the exception of mood stabilizers and antidepressants taken by the adjunctive therapy group, the most 
common class of concomitant psychotropic medications taken by subjects was non-benzodiazepines 
(hypnotic and anxiolytics), 22 % of all open-label subjects. A greater percentage of subjects in the 
adjunctive therapy group compared to the monotherapy groups were taking benzodiazepines (27.7 % 
and 15.6 %, respectively) and anti-EPS medications (25.6 % and 13.4 % respectively) during the 
open-label period.

The majority of all double-blind subjects were White (54.8%). There was an equivalent proportion of male 
(50.6%) and female (49.4%) subjects in the double-blind ITT population. The mean age was 38.6 years 
(range: 19 to 66 years). Based on BMI, 39.5% of subjects were classified as having normal body weight, 
29.9% of subjects were overweight, and 30.5% of subjects were obese. A smaller proportion of subjects 
in the placebo group (28.2%) were classified as obese (BMI ≥30) compared to subjects in the 
paliperidone palmitate group (32.9%).

subjects (73.7%) were living in a private residence with a spouse, domestic partner, family, or caregiver. 
Table 6. Baseline social demographics – DB ITT analysis set (Study SCA-3004) 
Psychiatric history 
The mean age of first psychiatric diagnosis for all double-blind subjects was 26.4 years and mean age of 
first schizoaffective diagnosis was 30.9 years. The majority of subjects (69.8%) had a diagnosis of bipolar 
subtype of schizoaffective disorder confirmed by SCID. The mean number of known psychiatric 
hospitalizations was 3.9 (median of 2.0) and the mean number of psychiatric hospitalizations in the past 
12 months was 0.6. Of the 334 randomized subjects, 105 (31.4%) subjects were in-patients at study 
entry. All double-blind subjects (100%) had a current episode of psychotic symptoms. For the subjects 
randomized to double-blind treatment, mood symptoms were classified as manic (32.6%), depressive 
(44.0%), or mixed (23.4%) at screening. A total of 60 subjects (18.0%) had a prior history of suicide 
attempt. There was a slightly unbalanced distribution of subjects by type of index/current episode at 
baseline with regard to mood symptoms with 84/170 (49.4 %) and 63/164 (38.4 %) with depressive 
symptoms in the placebo and paliperidone palmitate group, respectively. It is also noted that there were 
more subjects in the placebo group than in the paliperidone palmitate group with a diagnosis at baseline 
of depressive subtype; 59/170 (34.7%) and 42/164 (25.6%). For details on the psychiatric history for the 
DB ITT Analysis Set, see Table 41 in Study Report. For details on Baseline symptom scores, see Table 42

Concomitant psychotropic medications 
A summary of concomitant psychotropic medications started after double-blind Day 1 (first double-blind 
injection) is provided in Table 7. The majority of subjects in both the adjunctive therapy and monotherapy 
groups did not start additional psychotropic concomitant medications after double-blind Day 1. After 
double-blind Day 1, 40 of 170 placebo subjects and 32 of 164 paliperidone palmitate subjects took one or 
more concomitant psychotropic medications. The most common class of concomitant psychotropic 
medications started after double-blind Day 1 was non-benzodiazepines (hypnotics and anxiolytics) taken 
by 6.5% and 6.7% of subjects in the placebo and paliperidone palmitate groups, respectively.

(Study R092670-SCA-3004) 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 667 subjects were enrolled into the open-label period, 347 subjects received paliperidone 
palmitate as adjunctive therapy to mood stabilizers or antidepressants and 320 subjects received 
paliperidone palmitate as monotherapy. Of the 667 subjects enrolled, 432 subjects entered the 
Stabilization period and 334 of these subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either placebo 
(170 subjects) or to continue receiving paliperidone palmitate (164 subjects) in the double-blind Relapse 
Prevention period.

The most common reason for discontinuation among all open-label subjects was withdrawal of consent 
(14.7%). Additional reasons for discontinuation in >5% of subjects included adverse events (7.5%), 
failure of criteria to enter the Stabilization period (7.0%), loss to follow-up (6.3%), and failure of criteria 
to enter the double-blind Relapse Prevention period (5.2%). During the double-blind period, the most 
common reason for discontinuation in both the placebo and paliperidone palmitate groups was withdrawal 
of consent, 17.6% and 11.6%, respectively. A greater proportion of subjects in the paliperidone palmitate 
group (7.3%) discontinued the study due to an adverse event compared to subjects in the placebo group 
(1.8%). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Open label period 
The change from open-label baseline during the open-label treatment period for efficacy variables was 
summarized descriptively and examined using paired t-tests or rank tests. No adjustments were made for 
multiplicity since this period was used to determine acceptability for entry to the double-blind period. 
Personal and social performance scale (PSP) 
The mean (standard deviation [SD]) baseline PSP total score for subjects entering the open label period 
was 51.4 (11.02) suggesting impaired functioning that significantly interfered with role functioning. After 
subjects had been stabilized during the 6-month open label treatment, the PSP total score for subjects 
who were randomized improved to 72.0 (8.97. The mean (SD) increase (i.e. improvement) in PSP total 
score from the open label baseline was 20.8 (13.32). This finding indicates improvement in functioning 
during the lead-in and stabilization treatment periods for the group of subjects who were randomized. The 
PSP score change from baseline over time is shown graphically in Figure 5. Based on the mean change in 
PSP total score, statistically significant improvements (p <0. 001) were observed from baseline to all time 
points examined. There were only small differences between the adjunctive therapy and monotherapy 
groups.

Positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) 
Subjects were enrolled in the study with acute exacerbation of their schizoaffective symptoms. The 
PANSS total scores (based on 30 items) change from baseline over time showed statistically significant 
improvements (p<0.001) from baseline to all time points examined based on the mean change in PANSS 
total score. The means (95% CI) of PANSS total scores over time showed a decrease (ie, improvement) 
in the mean PANSS total score over time for the overall open label ITT population as well as the adjunctive 
therapy and monotherapy groups. 
The PANSS total score changes from baseline to Week 13, endpoint Lead-in (last observation carried 
forward [LOCF]), Week 25, and endpoint open-label (LOCF) show statistically significant improvement 
(p<0.001) in mean PANSS total score at each of the defined endpoints for the overall open-label ITT 
population as well as the adjunctive therapy and monotherapy groups. 
Changes from baseline in the PANSS subscale and factor scores showed that the change from baseline to 
endpoint open-label (LOCF) was statistically significant (p<0.001) for all 3 of the PANSS subscale scores 
and all 5 of the PANSS factor scores for the all open-label group as well as the adjunctive therapy and 
monotherapy groups. The means (95% CI) of PANSS total scores over time are presented graphically in 
Fig. 6. A similar decrease in the mean PANSS total score over time was observed for the overall open-label 
ITT population as well as the adjunctive therapy and monotherapy groups.

Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D) 
Statistically significant improvements (p<0.001) were observed from baseline to all time points examined 
based on HAM-D-21 total score for the all open-label subject population in addition to the adjunctive 
therapy and monotherapy groups therapy and monotherapy groups. For subjects with a HAM-D-21 score 
at baseline of 16 or greater, the decrease (i.e., improvement) in mean change of HAM-D-21 at Week 13, 
endpoint Lead-in (LOCF), Week 25, and end of open-label (LOCF) were all statistically significant.

Statistically significant changes from baseline (p<0.001) were observed at all time points examined 
based on HAM-D-17 total score for the all open-label subject population in addition to the adjunctive 
therapy and monotherapy groups. 
For subjects with a HAM-D-17 score at baseline of 16 or greater, the decrease in mean change of 
HAMD-17 at Week 13, endpoint Lead-in (LOCF), Week 25, and end of open-label (LOCF) were all 
statistically significant. 
The MAH examined the direct and indirect effect of treatment based on change in HAM-D-17 total score 
using a series of regression models in the open-label period. The analysis focused on subjects with 
prominent depressive symptoms, defined as a HAM-D-17 total score ≥16 at baseline. 
The results of these regression analyses indicated that there was a direct treatment effect on depressive 
symptoms as measured by HAM-D-17 when the effects from potential mediators were accounted for. 
Young mania rating scale (YMRS) 
Statistically significant decreases (i.e., improvements) from baseline in YMRS total scores (p<0.001) 
were observed from all the time points analyzed for the all open-label subject population, as well as the 
adjunctive therapy and monotherapy groups. 
CGI-S-SCA, MSQ 
Statistically significant changes from baseline in CGI-S-SCA overall scores, and CGI-S-SCA Domain 
Scores (p<0.001) were observed at all the time points analyzed for the all open-label subject population, 
as well as the adjunctive therapy and monotherapy groups. 
For the MSQ, 38.2% of all open-label subjects at baseline reported being satisfied with their medication, 
whereas at endpoint open-label (LOCF) the proportion of all open-label subjects satisfied with their study 
medication increased to 75.4%. A statistically significant (p<0.001) change from baseline in medication 
satisfaction was reported for subjects in both the adjunctive therapy and monotherapy groups at each 
study week evaluated. 
The results of the efficacy evaluations during the open-label period  indicate that treatment with 
paliperidone palmitate as monotherapy or adjunctive to mood stabilizers or antidepressants improves 
both functioning and psychotic and manic/depressive mood symptoms in acutely ill subjects with 
schizoaffective disorder.  
Double-blind period 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
A total of 82 subjects (24.6%) experienced a relapse during the double-blind period. The proportion of 
subjects who experienced a relapse was greater in the placebo group (57 subjects [33.5%]) compared to 
the paliperidone palmitate group (25 subjects [15.2%]). Due to the fact that less than 50% of subjects 
relapsed in each treatment group, median time to relapse could not be computed (Table 8). For the 
primary efficacy evaluation, the log-rank p-value compared all subjects taking paliperidone palmitate vs. 
those taking placebo, stratified by concomitant medication stratum. Continued treatment with 
paliperidone palmitate was associated with a significant delay in time to relapse compared with placebo 
(p<0.001) using the log-rank test controlling for concomitant medication strata (with or without 
adjunctive mood stabilizers/antidepressants). A significant delay in time to relapse of schizoaffective 
symptoms (p<0.001) was observed for subjects in the paliperidone palmitate group compared with 
subjects in the placebo group using a log rank test without stratification for concomitant medication 
stratum. 
The null hypothesis that there was no difference in the distribution of time to relapse between the 2 
treatment groups was rejected.

The risk of relapse (hazard ratio) was 2.49 (95% CI: 1.55, 3.99; p<0.001) fold higher for a subject who 
was switched to placebo than for a subject who continued to receive paliperidone palmitate in the 
double-blind period (Table 9). For patients in monotherapy and adjunctive subgroups the risk of relapse 
was not statistically significantly different after controlling for treatment (hazard ratio=1.28, 95% CI: 
0.82, 1.99; p=0.274).  
Table 9. Time to relapse, Cox proportional hazards regression model – double-blind ITT analysis set 
(Study R092670-SCA-3004). 
The most common reasons for relapse for subjects who experienced a relapse in the double-blind period 
were worsening of clinical scores at 2 consecutive visits, and interventions employed to avert 
hospitalizations. A higher proportion of subjects in the placebo group (7.1%, 12 subjects) than the 
paliperidone palmitate group (3.0%, 5 subjects) were hospitalized for decompensating of the subjects’ 
schizoaffective symptoms. A higher proportion of subjects in the placebo group (13.5%, 23 subjects) 
than in the paliperidone palmitate group (5.5%, 9 subjects) had an intervention employed to avoid their 
hospitalization. The majority of relapses were with both psychotic and mood symptoms. The frequency 
distribution of reasons for relapse is shown in Table 10.

Table 10. Frequency distribution of reason for relapse – DB ITT analysis set (Study SCA-3004) 
Time to relapse in subjects on monotherapy or adjunctive therapy 
For subjects on monotherapy, the proportion who experienced a relapse in the double-blind period was 
32.9% (24 subjects) in the placebo group and 11.5 % (9 subjects) in the paliperidone palmitate group. 
The Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to relapse showed a significantly longer time to relapse for subjects 
who continued to receive paliperidone palmitate in the double-blind period compared to placebo 
(p<0.001) The risk of relapse (hazard ratio) was 3.38 (95% CI: 1.57, 7.28; p=0.002) times higher for a 
subject in the placebo group than for a subject continuing to receive paliperidone palmitate as 
monotherapy in the double-blind period. 
For subjects on  
 therapy of mood stabilizers or antidepressants, 33 subjects 
(34.0%) in the placebo group and 16 subjects (18.6%) in the paliperidone palmitate group experienced 
a relapse in the double-blind period. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to relapse showed a significantly 
longer time to relapse for subjects who continued to receive paliperidone palmitate in the double-blind 
period compared to placebo (p=0.018). The risk of relapse (hazard ratio) was 2.03 (95% CI: 1.11, 3.68;

Time to relapse related to mood symptoms and psychotic symptoms 
Mood Symptoms: The risk of relapse due to mood symptoms was higher for subjects in the placebo group 
than for subjects continuing paliperidone palmitate treatment. Risk of relapse was 2.93 (95% CI: 1.70, 
5.04; p<0.001) times higher for relapse due to any mood symptom; 3.62 (95% CI: 1.32, 9.89; p=0.012) 
times higher for relapse due to manic symptoms; 3.12 (95% CI: 1.39, 6.98; p=0.006) times higher for

relapse due to depressive symptoms; and 1.93 (95% CI: 0.65, 5.78; p=0.238) for relapse due to mixed 
symptoms (Table 11). 
Table 11. Summary of Cox competing risk proportional hazards models on relapse types – DB ITT 
analysis set (Study SCA-3004) 
For subjects with manic and depressive type relapses, analysis by type of relapse unadjusted for the 
presence of competing risks, Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to relapse showed a significantly longer time 
to relapse for subjects who continued to receive paliperidone palmitate in the double-blind period 
compared to placebo (p=0.009 and p=0.004, respectively). For subjects with mixed type relapses, the 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to relapse did not show a significant difference between the placebo and 
paliperidone palmitate groups (p=0.277), however the number of subjects for this category was low. 
Psychotic Symptoms: Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to relapse based on psychotic relapses, showed a 
significantly longer time to relapse for subjects who continued to receive paliperidone palmitate in the 
double-blind period compared to placebo (p<0.001). The risk of relapse (hazard ratio) was 2.82 (95% CI: 
1.70, 4.67; p<0.001) times higher for a subject in the placebo group than for a subject continuing to 
receive paliperidone palmitate in the double-blind period. 
Time to all cause discontinuation (early discontinuation of study medication for any reason, 
including relapse) 
A Kaplan-Meier plot of the time to all cause discontinuation, including relapses for the 2 double-blind 
treatment groups is presented in Figure 9. The time to all cause discontinuation was significantly longer 
(p<0.001) for the subjects who were randomized to continue to receive paliperidone palmitate in the 
double-blind period compared to placebo. 
Overall, 169 subjects (50.6%) discontinued from the double-blind period of the study. A greater number 
of subjects in the placebo group (105 subjects [61.8%]) discontinued the study compared to the 
paliperidone palmitate group (64 subjects [39.0%]). There was a statistically significant difference in 
time to discontinuation (p<0.001 based on the long-rank test controlling for concomitant medication 
strata) between the treatment groups in favor of subjects who were randomized to continue to receive 
paliperidone palmitate in the double-blind period.

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Personal and social performance scale (PSP) 
The PSP scale was used to capture information around the degree of dysfunction a subject exhibited 
during the month prior to the time of examination. Functioning was assessed within 4 domains: a) socially 
useful activities, b) personal and social relationships, c) self-care, and d) disturbing and aggressive 
behavior. The change from double-blind baseline in PSP score was analyzed using a mixed model 
repeated measures (MMRM) ANCOVA model. The analysis was based on observed data (ie, data collected 
at each time point without carrying forward previous values). Within-subject repeated measures were 
modeled using unstructured covariance matrix. 
A significant difference (p=0.014) in favor of paliperidone palmitate was demonstrated when comparing 
the mean change from baseline at Month 15 (Week 64) using the MMRM approach. The least square 
(LS)-mean (95% CI) difference in change scores between the 2 treatment groups at Month 15 was 3.3 
(0.68, 5.95). Thus, the null hypothesis that there was no difference in the mean change from baseline in 
the PSP score between paliperidone palmitate and placebo at Month 15 end point was rejected. 
A summary of observed PSP scores over time in both the open label and double-blind periods is provided 
graphically in Figure 10.

Sensitivity analyses for PSP 
To evaluate the validity of the MAR assumption, several sensitivity analyses based on missing not at 
random (MNAR) were performed to assess the robustness and consistency of findings at the Month 15 end 
point. These analyses were based on Pattern Mixture Models (PMM), a Tipping-Point Analysis and a 
Pattern Mixture Model with Multiple Imputation approaches. A summary of LS-mean differences using the 
sensitivity analyses of PMM, Tipping Point analysis, and PMM with multiple imputation is provided in Table 
12.

Positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) 
Subjects were eligible for randomization into the double-blind Relapse Prevention period if they 
maintained stabilization criteria throughout the 12-week Stabilization period. One of prospectively 
defined stabilization criteria was a PANSS total score ≤70. The mean PANSS total score at double-blind 
baseline was 51.8 for subjects randomized to receive placebo and 51.1 for subjects randomized to 
continue receiving paliperidone palmitate in the double-blind period (Table 67). Subjects who continued 
to receive paliperidone palmitate remained stable based on change in PANSS total score from 
double-blind baseline to end point. 
The mean PANSS score for subjects who received placebo worsened by 7.4 points at double-blind end 
point and this change was significant (p<0.001). The difference between the 2 treatment groups was 
statistically significant (p<0.001) in favor of the paliperidone palmitate group. Changes in PANSS total 
scores over time during the open-label and double-blind phases are presented graphically in Figure 11.

Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D) 
Subjects were eligible for randomization into the double-blind Relapse Prevention period if they had a 
HAM-D-21 rating ≤12. The mean HAM-D-21 total score at double blind baseline was 5.6 for subjects 
randomized to receive placebo and 5.7 for subjects randomized to continue receiving paliperidone 
palmitate in the double-blind period. At double-blind end point the mean HAM-D-21 total score had 
worsened to 6.5 for subjects in the paliperidone palmitate group and to 9.0 for subjects in the placebo 
group. There was a significant difference (p<0.001) between the 2 treatment groups in favor of 
paliperidone palmitate when comparing the mean change in HAM-D-21 total score from double-blind 
baseline to end point.  
Also for HAM-D-17 there was a significant difference (p=0.001) between the 2 treatment groups in favor 
of paliperidone palmitate when comparing the mean change in HAM-D-17 total score from double-blind 
baseline to end point (Fig.12).

Young mania rating scale (YMRS) 
Subjects were eligible for randomization into the double-blind Relapse Prevention period if they had an 
YMRS rating ≤12. The mean YMRS total score at double-blind baseline was 4.4 for subjects randomized 
to both the placebo and paliperidone palmitate groups. At double-blind end point the mean YMRS total 
score for subjects in the paliperidone palmitate group had decreased to 4.3 and for subjects in the placebo 
group it worsened to 7.5. There was a significant difference (p<0.001) between the 2 treatment groups 
in favor of paliperidone palmitate when comparing the mean change in YMRS total score from 
double-blind baseline to end point. 
Clinical Global Impression of Severity for Schizoaffective Disorder(CGI-S-SCA) 
CGI-S-SCA Overall Score 
The mean CGI-S-SCA overall score remained relatively stable from double-blind baseline to end point for 
subjects in the paliperidone palmitate group while a mean increase of 0.4 (p<0.001) at double-blind end 
point was observed for subjects in the placebo group. There was a significant difference (p<0.001) 
between the two treatment groups in favor of paliperidone palmitate when comparing the mean change 
in CGI-S-SCA overall score from double-blind baseline to end point.

Hypotheses 
Randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group  study  evaluating 
the efficacy and safety of paliperidone palmitate, as monotherapy or as an adjunct 
to mood stabilizers or antidepressants, relative to placebo in delaying the time to 
relapse in subjects with schizoaffective disorder. Key secondary objective was to 
evaluate change in subject functioning using the PSP during the DB Period with 
paliperidone palmitate compared with placebo.

Superiority: The primary efficacy null hypothesis was that there is no difference 
in the distribution of time to relapse between the paliperidone palmitate and 
placebo groups. 
The  key  secondary  efficacy  variable  was  the  mean  change  from  double-blind 
baseline  in  PSP  score  at  DB  endpoint  (Month  15).  The  corresponding  null 
hypothesis for the key secondary endpoint was that there is no difference in mean 
change  from  double-blind  baseline  in  the  PSP  score  between  paliperidone 
palmitate and placebo at endpoint.

Primary Analysis 
Efficacy and safety summaries for the DB Relapse Prevention Period of the study 
were based on the double-blind ITT analysis set which included all randomized

primary population for efficacy was the double-blind ITT analysis set. 
Difference between treatment groups for the key secondary endpoint, changes

Analysis 
description 
each 
subgroup, 
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the time between Day 1 of the 
DB period and the first documentation of a relapse. Treatment differences for 
time to relapse were compared using a log-rank test stratified by concomitant 
medication stratum (treatment with mood stabilizers or antidepressants or no 
such treatment). Time to relapse between treatment groups was also evaluated 
within 
concomitant  medications 
treatment  with 
(antidepressants  or  mood  stabilizers)  and  no  concomitant  treatment.  Risk  of 
relapse  for  the  subgroup  of  subjects  on  monotherapy  and  adjunctive  therapy 
were also examined using Cox proportional hazards models. In addition, a Cox 
proportional hazards model was extended to include 3 types of mood events: 
manic,  depressive  and  mixed.  The  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  was  also 
used to examine differences between treatment groups for psychotic relapses. 
Test of hypotheses for any difference in risk of relapse in mood event types was 
examined by the Global Competing Risk test. 
The  key  secondary  efficacy  variable  was  the  mean  change  from  double-blind 
baseline in PSP score at double-blind endpoint (Month 15).  
The overall type I error rate for testing paliperidone palmitate versus placebo for 
both the primary efficacy and key secondary efficacy endpoint was controlled at 
the 2-sided 0.05 significance level using a fixed sequence gatekeeper approach. 
Time to first relapse was tested first, followed by change from baseline in PSP. If 
the null hypothesis corresponding to time to first relapse was rejected, then the 
PSP would be tested at the 5% level, thus maintaining an overall Type I error 
rate of 5%.  
The change from double-blind baseline in PSP score was analyzed using a mixed 
model repeated measures (MMRM) Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model. 
The model included baseline PSP score as a fixed-effect covariate; treatment, 
concomitant medication stratum (treatment with antidepressants or mood 
stabilizers or no such treatment), country, and time (scheduled assessment 
visits) as fixed-effect (categorical) factors, and the interaction between time and 
treatment. Using this model, treatment effects at the Month 15 endpoint were 
estimated based on differences between least squares (LS) means. 
Accompanying 95% CIs for the LS mean differences between paliperidone 
palmitate, and placebo were presented.  
The change from double-blind baseline in HAM-D-17 score was analyzed using 
ANCOVA model. The treatment group differences were analyzed using an 
ANCOVA model. The model will include treatment, concomitant 
medication stratum, and country as fixed effect design factors, and baseline 
HAM-D-17 total score as a covariate. Using this model, treatment effects 
estimated based on differences between LS means. Accompanying 95% CIs for 
the LS mean differences was presented. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
As requested by the CHMP, the MAH has submitted pharmacokinetic data on switch from oral paliperidone 
to paliperidone palmitate with the current application. The population pharmacokinetic model is 
adequately validated and appears to support the claim that the steady state exposures are similar 
between oral paliperidone PR and paliperidone palmitate LAI. The recommended dosing during a switch 
between oral paliperidone PR and paliperidone palmitate LAI is also supported by the present model. 
While the proposed dosing results in temporarily higher exposures for patients switching from a 
Assessment report

maintenance treatment of 3 mg oral paliperidone PR, the possibility to individualize the dosing, as stated 
in the current SmPC, appears adequate. 
Study SCA-3004 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of paliperidone palmitate, as monotherapy or as an adjunct to mood stabilizers or 
antidepressants, relative to placebo in delaying the time to relapse in subjects with schizoaffective 
disorder. The study consisted of 4 periods: Screening (up to 7 days), Lead-in (13 weeks), stabilization (12 
weeks), and relapse prevention (15 months). A total of 921 subjects were screened, 667 subjects were 
enrolled in the open-label lead-in period, and 432 subjects entered the open-label stabilization period. Of 
the 432 subjects who entered the open-label stabilization period, 334 subjects were randomized to the 
double-blind relapse prevention period (170 subjects to the placebo group and 164 subjects to the 
paliperidone palmitate group). The randomisation and the measures taken to preserve the blinding seem 
adequate. Subjects were men and women ≥18 years of age with a lifetime and current diagnosis of 
schizoaffective disorder.  
More subjects in the paliperidone palmitate, 59.9% (100/164), than in the placebo group 38.2% 
(65/170) completed the study. The difference in the number of subjects discontinuing early was foremost 
due to the difference in the number of subjects experiencing a relapse. The most prominent other reasons 
for early discontinuations were, in both groups, withdrawal of consent followed by lost to follow-up in the 
placebo group and adverse events in the active group respectively. Reasons for early withdrawals have 
been summarized and median follow-up time (including range) in the double-blind period of the study has 
been provided by the company after CHMP request (RSI). While both the mean and the median was 
approximately 9 months in the placebo arm, mean exposure in the paliperidone palmitate arm was 11 
months with a median of >14 months mirroring that 61% (100/164) completed the study (i.e. the 15 
month treatment period) in the paliperidone palmitate group to be compared to 38.2% (65/170) in the 
placebo arm. The difference between the groups was, as already concluded, mainly due to the difference 
in relapse pattern. Regarding time to withdrawal of consent (the most prominent reason for early 
discontinuation besides relapse), both the mean and median was similar in both groups but concerned 
more subjects in the placebo arm, 30/170 (17.6%), than in the active arm, 19/164 (11.6%). 
The primary efficacy end point for the study was the time between day 1 of the double-blind period and 
the first documentation of a relapse during the double-blind relapse prevention period. 
A greater proportion of subjects in the placebo group (57 subjects [33.5%]) experienced a relapse 
compared to the paliperidone palmitate group (25 subjects [15.2%]). Continued treatment with 
paliperidone palmitate was associated with a significant delay in time to relapse compared with placebo 
(p<0.001). The risk (hazard) of relapse was 2.49 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55, 3.99; p<0.001) 
fold higher for a subject who was switched to placebo than for a subject who continued to receive 
paliperidone palmitate in the double-blind period. 
In addition, a Cox proportional hazards model was extended to include 3 types of mood events: manic, 
depressive and mixed. For subjects with manic and depressive type relapses, analysis by type of relapse 
showed a significantly longer time to relapse for subjects who continued on paliperidone palmitate in the 
double-blind period compared to placebo (p=0.009 and p=0.004, respectively).  
Analysis of the subgroup of subjects on adjunctive therapy and monotherapy demonstrated that the risk 
of relapse was 2.03 or 3.38 times greater with the placebo group in adjunctive antidepressant/mood 
stabilizer treatment or in monotherapy, respectively (hazard ratio (HR) 2.03; 95% CI 1.11-3.68; p=0. 
021 and HR 3.38; 95% CI 1.57-7.28; p=0.002). The difference in efficacy between the two groups was 
less pronounced in the concomitant medication stratum probably due to a higher relapse rate in this 
stratum (compared to the monotherapy stratum) in the paliperidone palmitate group. For subjects who 
received antidepressants as adjunctive therapy, 15 subjects (37.5%) in the placebo group and 7 subjects 
(18.4%) in the paliperidone palmitate group experienced a relapse in the double-blind period (p=0.051).

This is considered to contribute to a conclusion of a benefit of paliperidone palmitate regarding effect on 
also depressive symptoms. 
An analysis of time to early discontinuation for any reason, including relapses, was performed. Median 
time to all cause discontinuation in the placebo group was less than 9 months while not reached and 
hence, could not be estimated in the active group. According to the SAP an analysis of early 
discontinuation not including relapses was also planned but has not been found in the study report. For 
completeness, and to clarify time to early discontinuations for reason besides relapses, this analysis was 
requested by the CHMP (RSI).  Besides the difference in relapse pattern, there was a difference, although 
smaller, also in the proportion of subjects discontinuing treatment for other reasons than relapses; in the 
paliperidone palmitate group 23.8% (39/164) compared to 28.2% (48/170) in the placebo group. The 
MAH has performed two analyses of time to early discontinuation not including relapses. The analysis not 
including relapses as event and with subjects experiencing a relapse censored is considered the most 
appropriate since those with a relapse contribute to the subjects in risk of discontinuing. Looking at the 
Kaplan-Meier curves, there was a difference between the treatment arms with the survival curves 
separating after approximately 5 to 6 months of follow-up. The CHMP considered this issue as resolved. 
For the key secondary endpoint, Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP), the change in score from 
double-blind baseline was analyzed using a MMRM model. The analysis was pre-identified as the primary 
analysis, and was based on observed data collected at each time point without carrying forward previous 
values. A significant difference (p=0.014) in favor of paliperidone palmitate was demonstrated when 
comparing the mean change from baseline at Month 15 (Week 64) using the MMRM approach (treatment 
difference 3.3; 95% CI: 0.68, 5.95). While the MMRM analysis can be questioned considering the missing 
at random (MAR) assumption, several sensitivity analyses were performed based on missing not at 
random (MNAR). Overall, the results were consistent in that the outcome was in favor of paliperidone 
palmitate although not always statistically significant. The estimated difference between the groups did 
hence differ depending on analysis with the “worst” outcome in two sensitivity analyses using imputation 
of worsening LOCF values in the paliperidone palmitate group only. Overall, they are considered to 
support a difference in favour of paliperidone palmitate, although the size of treatment efficacy could be 
discussed.  
For each of the additional secondary efficacy analyses of PANSS total score, HAM-D-21 score, HAM-D-17 
score, YMRS score, and CGI-S-SCA overall score in the DB period there was a statistically significant 
difference between treatment groups (change from double-blind baseline to end point) in favor of 
paliperidone palmitate. Analyses were performed with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model using 
both Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) and observed cases. No additional sensitivity analyses 
were planned. While the results for secondary efficacy endpoints in the analyses based on LOCF all 
showed statistically significantly differences in favour of paliperidone, the same was not true for the 
analyses based on completed subjects (observed cases). This concerned foremost PANSS total score, 
HAM-D-21 and HAM-D-17 respectively. The difference seen may hence to some extent have depended on 
a difference between groups in withdrawal pattern and, the use of LOCF. While more subjects 
experiencing a relapse is proof of benefit for paliperidone palmitate, treatment discontinuations for other 
reasons (than relapses) may have contributed to the differences shown. The difference in proportion of 
subjects discontinuing was not substantial, 48/170 (28.2%) in the placebo group and 39/164 (23.8%) in 
the active group but the reasons for early discontinuations differed.  The CHMP requested a discussion 
and additional (sensitivity) analyses for clarification regarding the potential impact on the outcome 
considering the use of LOCF was requested ( RSI). The MAH  provided additional sensitivity analyses. 
While LOCF in this case may have been conservative with subjects in the placebo arm dropping-out 
earlier, the appropriateness of using LOCF is also depending on the reason for withdrawal. While foremost 
due to relapse the difference in proportion of subjects discontinuing was considered in support of active 
treatment in the primary analysis. The additional analyses provided all seem to support that there was a 
statistically significant difference between paliperidone palmitate and placebo also regarding HAM-D-17 
outcomes.  While the difference shown may be considered modest, the interpretation may need to take 
into account the limitations due to the design of study SCA-3004; i.e. of those who were randomised into

the double-blind relapse period, approximately 80% were in remission at baseline and, relapse criteria 
were designed to identify early indicators of relapse. 
There was a statistically significant (p=0.010) difference between treatment groups in favor of 
paliperidone palmitate also on the patient reported outcome, Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire. 
The HAM-D 21 scale has been criticized because it is not validated for schizoaffective disorder and also 
includes symptoms that could be attributed to psychosis/mania. For that reason, the CHMP recommended 
in a previous procedure [EMEA/H/C/000746/II/00239] that the HAM-D-17 scale should be used. For the 
current application, both HAM-D-21 and HAM-D-17 were used, and statistically significant results in favor 
of the active group were shown for both scales. 
In the two 6-week studies submitted in 2009 for the schizoaffective indication, the change in PANSS total 
score was clearly less pronounced in patients on concomitant treatment with antidepressants/mood 
stabilizers compared with patients on monotherapy. In the current study SCA-3004, the results for the 
PANSS in the OL phase were similar for both groups. The MAH did not present a separate analysis for the 
DB phase regarding PANSS and YMRS, this should be provided.  Of note, in the two 6-week studies 
mentioned above no effect was observed in patients who were treated with both antidepressants and 
mood stabilizers. These patients were excluded from the current study SCA-3004. For relapse rate, a 
trend for a more pronounced effect was noted in the monotherapy group (hazard ratio 3.38) vs. the 
adjunctive therapy group (hazard ratio 2.03) in study SCA-3004 (Fig. 7). The effect on relapse rate was 
statistically significant vs. placebo for both groups. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  submitted  study  SCA-3004  has  demonstrated  that  paliperidone  palmitate  when  compared  with 
placebo  significantly  delays  relapse  in  subjects  with  schizoaffective  disorder  which  supports 
maintenance of efficacy for paliperidone palmitate. 
Analysis of the subgroup of subjects on adjunctive therapy and monotherapy demonstrated that the risk 
of relapse was greater with the placebo group in adjunctive antidepressant/mood stabilizer treatment or 
in monotherapy, respectively. A benefit for paliperidone palmitate compared to placebo was also shown, 
although borderline (p=0.051), in the subgroup of subjects who received antidepressants as adjunctive 
therapy. In addition, a Cox proportional hazards model was extended to include 3 types of mood events: 
manic, depressive and mixed. For subjects with manic and depressive type relapses, analysis by type of 
relapse  showed  a  significantly  longer  time  to  relapse  for  subjects  who  continued  on  paliperidone 
palmitate in the double-blind period compared to placebo. Overall, those analyses are considered to 
contribute  to  a  conclusion  of  a  benefit  of  paliperidone  palmitate  regarding  effect  on  also  depressive 
symptoms. 
The results for secondary efficacy variables, including PANSS, YMRS and HAM-D, show a statistically 
significant effect in favour of paliperidone palmitate and seem to support a conclusion of the benefit of 
paliperidone palmitate as maintenance treatment.

Adverse events 
Treatment emergent adverse events 
Open-label 
In the open-label period, 62.5% of the 667 subjects reported at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse 
event (TEAE). Moreover, there were 50 subjects (7.5%) who reported TEAEs that resulted in treatment

discontinuation, and 54 subjects (8.1%) who experienced 1 or more serious adverse events (SAEs). 
Three subjects (0.4%) died during the open-label period (Table 1). 
Treatment emergent adverse events 
Double-blind 
The numbers of subjects who reported at least 1 TEAE were 95 subjects (55.9%) and 106 
subjects (64.6%) in the placebo group and the paliperidone palmitate group, respectively. Furthermore, 
subjects in the placebo group reported a higher incidence of SAEs (16 subjects [9.4%]), compared to 
subjects in the paliperidone palmitate group (9 subjects [5.5%]). In addition, 2 subjects (1.2%) in the 
paliperidone palmitate group died during the double-blind period (Table 2). 
Adverse Events  
Treatment emergence adverse events 
Open-label 
The occurrence of common TEAEs (in at least 2% of subjects) is summarized in Table 3. The 
most frequently observed adverse events were coded to the Nervous System and Psychiatric 
Disorders system organ classes (SOCs) in 29.8% and 21.9% of subjects, respectively. The most common 
TEAEs (in ≥5% of subjects) were akathisia (11.1%), injection site pain (10.6%), insomnia (10.0%), 
Assessment report

weight increased (8.5%), parkinsonism (6.4%), and headache (5.4%). Most adverse events were mild or 
moderate in intensity. 
There were no notable differences between subjects in the monotherapy groups and adjunctive therapy. 
In the open-label period, the investigator considered majority of TEAEs (48.1%) to be related to study 
drug). The TEAEs that were most frequently considered probably related to study drug coded to th SOCs 
of Nervous System Disorders (47 subjects, 7.0%), and General Disorders and Administration Site 
Conditions (11 subjects, 1.6%).

Double-blind 
The prevalence of common TEAEs (in at least 2% of subjects) is described in Table 4. The 
TEAEs that were reported with a higher frequency in the paliperidone palmitate group than in the placebo 
group (a 2% difference or more between groups) were: weight increased (8.5% vs. 4.7%), 
nasopharyngitis (5.5% vs. 3.5%), headache (5.5% vs. 3.5%), hyperprolactinaemia (4.3% vs. 
1.2%), and pyrexia (3.7% vs. 1.2%). There was a higher incidence of the following TEAEs in the 
placebo group than in the paliperidone palmitate group (a 2% difference or more between groups): 
insomnia (7.1% vs. 4.9%) and schizoaffective disorder (5.9% vs. 3.0%). It should be noted that most 
adverse events were mild or moderate in intensity. In the placebo group, there were 66 subjects 
(38.8%) and 43 subjects (25.3%) who reported adverse events that were mild and moderate in 
intensity, respectively. In the paliperidone palmitate, there were 84 subjects (51.2%) and 52 subjects 
(31.7%) who reported adverse events that were mild and moderate in intensity, respectively. 
In the double-blind period, the investigator identified 69 subjects (42.1%) in the paliperidone palmitate 
group as having TEAEs considered not related to study drug, and 64 subjects (39.0%) as having TEAEs 
considered related to study drug. In the placebo group, the investigator determined that the majority of 
subjects (79 subjects, 46.5%) had TEAEs considered not related to study drug in contrast to 38 subjects 
(22.4%) who had TEAEs considered related to study drug. Furthermore, TEAEs considered related to 
study drug with the highest number of subjects in both the placebo and PP1M groups (12 subjects [7.1%] 
in placebo and 16 subjects [9.8%] in paliperidone palmitate  were coded to the SOC of Nervous System 
Disorders.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Open-label 
During the open-label period of the study, 3 subjects died. 
A 55-year-old white woman died as a consequence of cardiogenic shock and 
coma. It should be noted that the subject had a history of anemia, pneumonia, candidiasis of the 
esophagus, and chronic nonspecific esophagitis that were ongoing at the time of enrollment. 
Nine days after the first dose of open-label study drug, the subject became unexpectedly sedated 
and was hospitalized. She died the following day. The autopsy report determined the cause of 
death as bilateral pneumonia. This contributed to dystrophic changes in the myocardium and

acute cardiovascular failure. The investigator provided an alternative etiology that Ascaris 
lumbricoides contamination resulted in the inhalation of Ascaris larvae. This led to chronic 
pneumonia with dystrophic changes in the myocardium. In turn, this contributed to the 
development of Frederick syndrome and shock condition. Resultantly, the subject lapsed into a 
coma and died. The investigator considered the cardiogenic shock to be doubtfully related to the 
study drug whereas the coma was considered not to be related to the study drug. 
A 52-year-old white man died from completed suicide. At the time of study 
entry, the subject displayed symptoms of mania and acute psychosis. Fourteen days after 
receiving his last dose of study drug, the subject committed suicide. It should be noted that the 
subject had no prior history of suicidal behavior and C-SSRS was negative for suicidal thoughts 
and suicidal behavior throughout the study. The investigator considered the event as possibly 
related to study drug. 
A 59-year-old African-American woman died from a myocardial infarction. 
The subject had a history of osteoarthritis, obesity, hypothyroidism, HIV infection and insomnia 
that were ongoing at the time of enrollment. She was on concomitant treatment (Viramune® and 
Trizivir®). The subject died 13 days after her last dose of study drug. The investigator considered 
the event doubtfully related to study drug.  
Double-blind 
During the double-blind period of the study, 2 subjects (both in the PP1M group) died. 
A 58-year-old African-American man with a history of hypertension and 
type 2 diabetes mellitus died from coronary artery disease. Following completion of the open label period 
of the study, the subject was randomized to continue receiving PP1M in the doubleblind 
period. The death certificate identified the cause of death as coronary artery disease 
secondary to hypertension. The investigator considered the event not related to study drug. 
A 40-year-old African-American man who died due to an unknown event. 
His death occurred on an unspecified date approximately 4 months after the last injection of 
study drug (placebo). The investigator considered the event not related to study drug. As the 
timing of the event fell outside the allocated study window, the death of this subject was not 
included in the clinical database. The death of the subject is documented in a subject narrative as 
having experienced a SAE of suicidal ideation before being withdrawn from the study due to 
missing a scheduled study visit. 
In addition, there was another death reported for a subject who had withdrawn from the study. 
Subject was a 28-year-old white man who died from an overdose of an unknown type 
of sleeping pill. Having completed the open-label period of the study, the subject was 
randomized to continue receiving paliperidone palmitate in the double-blind period. The investigator 
determined the event as not related to study drug. 
Serious Adverse Events 
Open-label 
During the open-label period, there was at least 1 SAE reported in 54 subjects (8.1 %). The majority 
(77.8%) of reported SAEs belonged to the Psychiatric Disorders SOC. The most frequently occurring 
events (in ≥2% of open-label subjects) were schizoaffective disorder and suicidal ideation in 16 subjects 
(2.4%) and 15 subjects (2.2%), respectively (Table 5).

Double-blind 
During the double-blind period, the number of subjects that reported at least 1 SAE in the paliperidone 
palmitate group and the placebo group was 9 subjects (5.5%) and 16 subjects (9.4%), respectively. In 
addition,  the  greater  proportion  of  reported  SAEs  belonged  to  the  Psychiatric  Disorders  SOC. 
Furthermore,  schizoaffective  disorder  was  the  only  SAE  that  was  reported  by  more  than  2  subjects 
(placebo group, 7 subjects [4.1%]) (Table 6).

Other Adverse Events of Clinical Interest 
Open-label 
Extrapyramidal Syndrome(EPS)-related Adverse Events 
The prevalence of EPS-related TEAEs in subjects during the open-label period was 23.2%. This 
included a similar percentage of subjects from the monotherapy groups (24.4%) and adjunctive 
therapy (22.2%). Akathisia (11.1%), parkinsonism (6.4%), tremor (3.4%) and dyskinesia (2.1%) 
constituted the most frequently reported EPS-related TEAEs (in >2% of open-label subjects). It should be 
noted that EPS-related TEAEs resulted in discontinuation for 3 subjects (0.4%) with akathisia, 2 subjects 
(0.3%) with parkinsonism, and subject (0.1%) with dystonia. 
Glucose-related Adverse Events 
Glucose-related TEAEs were observed in 6 subjects (0.9%). Three subjects (0.4%) reported 
diabetes mellitus while the remaining events were reported by 1 subject (0.1%) each. None of these 
events contributed to discontinuation from the study. An adverse event of glycosylated haemoglobin 
increased was reported in 1 subject (0.3%) from the monotherapy groups. The adverse event was not

serious and did not result in discontinuation from the study. Moreover, the investigator considered the 
event to be not related to study drug. 
Prolactin-related Adverse Events 
A prolactin-related adverse event was reported in 31 female subjects (10.0%) and 32 male 
subjects (9.0%). The most frequently reported prolactin-related adverse events in female subjects 
were amenorrhoea (5.8%) and galactorrhoea (2.9%). The most commonly reported prolactin-related 
adverse events in male subjects were libido decreased (2.8%) and erectile dysfunction (2.5%). 
Prolactin-related TEAEs resulted in discontinuation from the study for: 4 subjects (0.6%) who 
experienced erectile dysfunction, 2 subjects (0.3%) with hyperprolactinaemia (1 subject also had a TEAE 
of amenorrhoea), 1 subject (0.1%) with galactorrhoea, 1 subject (0.1%) with sexual dysfunction, 
and 1 subject (0.1%) with libido decreased. Narratives for the subjects who discontinued from the study 
as a result of the prolactin-related AE are provided. 
Double-blind 
EPS-related Adverse Events 
Extrapyramidal syndrome-related TEAEs were reported in both the placebo (12 subjects, 7.1%) and 
paliperidone palmitate groups  (14  subjects,  8.5%).  The  EPS-related  TEAEs  that  were  reported  at  a 
higher incidence  in  the  placebo  than  the  PP1M  group  were  tremor  (2.4%  vs.  1.2%,  respectively), 
dyskinesia (1.8% vs. 0.6%, respectively), and restlessness (1.2% and 0.6%, respectively). Moreover, 
akathisia was reported more frequently in the paliperidone palmitate group than in the placebo group 
(3.0%  vs.  1.8%,  respectively).  In  the  paliperidone palmitate group,  the  following EPS-related TEAEs 
were reported in 1 subject (0.6%) each: restless leg syndrome, bradykinesia, and  musculoskeletal 
stiffness.  In  the  placebo  group,  the  following  EPS-related  TEAEs  were reported in 1 subject (0.6%) 
each: dystonia, muscle spasm, and torticolis. Two subjects (1.2%) in the PP1M group discontinued from 
the  study  due  to  EPS-related  TEAEs.  Narratives  for  the  2 subjects are provided in. 
Glucose-related Adverse Events 
Glucose-related TEAEs were reported in both the placebo (4 subjects, 2.4%) and paliperidone palmitate 
groups (3 subjects, 1.8%). In the paliperidone palmitate group, Type 2 diabetes mellitus was reported 
by 2 subjects (1.2%). The remaining events were reported by 1 subject (0.6%) per treatment group. 
Furthermore, 1 subject (0.6%) in the paliperidone palmitate group discontinued the study due to an 
adverse event of blood glucose increased. Four subjects (2.4%) from the placebo group and 2 subjects 
(1.2%) from the paliperidone palmitate  group reported an adverse event of glycosylated haemoglobin 
increased, that  was  considered  related to  study drug.  None of the events  was serious,  and  none led 
to discontinuation from the study. 
Prolactin-related Adverse Events 
Prolactin-related  TEAEs  were  reported  in  the  placebo  (5  female  subjects,  5.8%)  and  paliperidone 
palmitate groups (11 female subjects, 13.9%). Blood prolactin increased was the most prevalent 
prolactin-related TEAE among women, as reported in 5.1% of paliperidone palmitate  subjects and 1.2% 
of placebo subjects.  Prolactin-related TEAEs were reported in 1 male subject (1.2%) in  the  placebo 
group and 6 male subjects (7.1%) in the paliperidone palmitate group. The most frequently reported 
prolactin-related  TEAE  among  men  was hyperprolactinaemia, reported by 4.7% of subjects in the 
paliperidone palmitate group only. No other prolactin- related TEAE was reported by more than 1 male 
subject.  The  occurrence  of  a  prolactin-related TEAE of galactorrhoea contributed in 1 subject 
discontinuing from the study.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
No new safety concerns are identified. The adverse events reported in open-label and double-blind period 
were similar to previously conducted studies with paliperidone. 
During the open-label period the majority of adverse events were related to the Nervous System and 
Psychiatric Disorders. 
During the double-blind period TEAEs that occurred more frequently in the paliperidone palmitate group 
than the placebo group were weight increased, nasopharyngitis, headache, hyperprolactinaemia, and 
pyrexia. 
There were 5 cases of death described, 3 in the open- label period and 2 in the double blind period. The 
case reports regarding death were described as not related to the study drug, which is endorsed 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
There are no new safety concerns. 
The current SmPC describes the known safety profile and there is no need for further update of the 
Product information 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
No new safety concerns have been identified as part of this extension of indication application.  
Long-term safety in patients with schizoaffective disorder has now been provided with results of study 
SCA-3004, therefore “long-term safety in patients with schizoaffective disorder” is no longer listed as 
missing information.   
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 6.0 is acceptable. The PRAC endorsed PRAC 
Rapporteur assessment report is attached. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
Following the results obtained in study SCA-3004, the MAH proposes to amend sections 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 
of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Other minor editorial and formatting 
corrections are also proposed to be made.  
The MAH’s proposed amendments of these sections are shown below. 
In section 4.1, the sentence “Effect on depressive symptoms has not been demonstrated” is proposed to 
be deleted, and also the restriction to treat only “psychotic and manic symptoms” of schizoaffective 
disorder in adults. In addition, an editorial correction is proposed to be made, since the statement “Invega 
is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults” is a duplication error.  The first paragraph of the 
indication already states that Invega is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia in the adult population. 
The following changes to section 4.1 are proposed: 
“4.1. Therapeutic indications 
INVEGA is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents 15 years and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213560/2015

older. 
INVEGA is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. 
INVEGA is indicated for the treatment of psychotic or manic symptoms of schizoaffective disorder in 
adults. Effect on depressive symptoms has not been demonstrated.” 
In section 4.2, the statement “Maintenance of effect has not been studied” is proposed to be deleted: 
“4.2.  Posology and method of administration 
Schizoaffective disorder (adults) 
The recommended dose of INVEGA for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder in adults is 6 mg 
once daily, administered in the morning. Initial dose titration is not required. Some patients may 
benefit from higher doses within the recommended range of 6 mg to 12 mg once daily. Dosage 
adjustment, if indicated, should occur only after clinical reassessment. When dose increases are 
indicated, increments of 3 mg/day are recommended and generally should occur at intervals of more 
than 4 days. Maintenance of effect has not been studied.” 
A summary of the study results of Study SCA-3004 is proposed to be added to section 5.1: 
“5.1.  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Effect on depressive symptoms of schizoaffective disorder and maintenance of effect have were not been 
studied with INVEGA, but have been demonstrated with the long-acting injectable formulation of 
paliperidone. 
An effect of INVEGA on depressive symptoms has was not been demonstrated in this study, but has been 
demonstrated with the long-acting injectable formulation of paliperidone (described further down in this 
section). 
In a long-term trial designed to assess the maintenance of effect, the long-acting injectable formulation 
of paliperidone was significantly more effective than placebo in maintaining symptom control and 
delaying relapse of psychotic, manic, and depressive symptoms of schizoaffective disorder. After having 
been successfully treated for an acute psychotic or mood episode for 13 weeks and stabilised for an 
additional 12 weeks with the long-acting injectable formulation of paliperidone (doses ranging from 50 to 
150 mg) patients were then randomised to a 15-month double-blind relapse prevention period of the 
study to either continue on the long-acting injectable formulation of paliperidone or on placebo until they 
experienced a relapse of schizoaffective symptoms. The study showed a significantly longer time to 
relapse in patients treated with the long-acting injectable formulation of paliperidone compared to 
placebo (p<0.001). 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representatives of FR and IS. 
Rapporteur’s assessment of the update of product information: 
The proposed changes by the MAH are considered acceptable. An annotated SmPC is attached.

Not applicable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Invega (paliperidone) was approved in April 2011 for the treatment of psychotic or manic symptoms in 
schizoaffective disorder in adults based mainly on two 6-week phase III studies in subjects with 
schizoaffective disorder (type II variation EMEA/H/C/746/II/0023). As part of the approval of the 
schizoaffective indication, the MAH committed to provide a maintenance study (R092670-SCA-3004) on 
Assessment report

paliperidone palmitate in patients with schizoaffective disorders, and relevant pharmacokinetic data on 
switch from oral paliperidone to paliperidone palmitate. The population pharmacokinetic model suggests 
that steady state exposures are similar between the two formulations thus supporting the extrapolation 
of efficacy between formulations.  
The MAH has now provided the clinical study report for the relapse-prevention study SCA-3004 and a PK 
report on switch from oral paliperidone to paliperidone palmitate. The results of study SCA-3004 show 
that treatment with paliperidone palmitate resulted in a statistically significant delay in the time to relapse 
in subjects with schizoaffective disorder. The risk of relapse was 2.49 (95 % CI 1.55, 3.99) higher for a 
subject who switched to placebo than for a subject who continued to receive paliperidone in the 
double-blind period. Analysis of the subgroups of subjects on adjunctive therapy and monotherapy 
demonstrated that the risk of relapse was 2.03 or 3.38 times greater with the placebo group in adjunctive 
antidepressant/mood stabilizer treatment or in monotherapy, respectively (hazard ratio (HR) 2.03; 95% 
CI 1.11-3.68; p=0. 021 and HR 3.38; 95% CI 1.57-7.28; p=0.002). A Cox proportional hazards model 
was extended to include 3 types of mood events: manic, depressive and mixed. For subjects with manic 
and depressive type relapses, analysis by type of relapse showed a significantly longer time to relapse for 
subjects who continued on paliperidone palmitate in the double-blind period compared to placebo 
(p=0.009 and p=0.004, respectively). 
For the key secondary endpoint, Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP), a significant difference 
(p=0.014) in favor of paliperidone palmitate was demonstrated when comparing the mean change from 
baseline at Month 15 (Week 64) using the MMRM approach. For each of the additional secondary efficacy 
analyses of PANSS total score, HAM-D-21 score, HAM-D-17 score, YMRS score, and CGI-S-SCA overall 
score there was a statistically significant difference between treatment groups (change from double-blind 
baseline to end point) in favor of paliperidone palmitate. 
After re-evaluation of acute antidepressant efficacy in subgroup of subjects with prominent depressive 
symptoms in pooled data from previously submitted short-term, placebo controlled studies, a statistical 
and clinically significant improvement in HAM-D-17 total score is shown at the group level. Results were 
based on LOCF and confirmed with sensitivity analyses (tipping point analysis: up to 10% worsening of all 
paliperidone palmitate patients who discontinued). The difference in reduction in HAM-D-17 total score 
between active and placebo group was 3.0 (p=0.002), which is a clinical relevant difference in favor for 
paliperidone which decreased to 2.0 (p=0.048) after sensitivity analyses. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In obese patients there was almost no difference between groups in the proportion of patients with 
relapse. The MAH clarified the reasons for this result. The pharmacokinetic analysis does not indicate a 
significant difference in exposure in obese patients.   
In the 6-week studies in schizoaffective disorder submitted with Invega type II variation II-23 
(SCA-3001, SCA-3002), it was noted that for psychotic symptoms rated with PANSS total score the effect 
seen in the overall population was entirely attributed to the subgroup with no lithium use. The applicant 
provided subgroup analysis based on the concomitant antidepressants which suggested that treatment 
with paliperidone provided additional antidepressant efficacy in short-term (SCA-3001, SCA-3002) as 
well as long-term (SCA-3004) studies.  
Although the remission analysis (HAM-D-17 total score ≤7) and responder analysis (≥50% improvement 
in HAM-D-17 score at end point) presented differences favouring paliperidone palmitate treatment, 11.1 
%-points (p=0.041) and 11.4 (p=0.054), respectively), the differences decreased to 6.8 and 8.5, 
respectively when discontinuing patients were assumed as non-responders (data not presented).

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most frequently observed adverse events were coded to the Nervous System and Psychiatric 
Disorders system organ classes (SOCs) in 29.8% and 21.9% of subjects, respectively. The most common 
TEAEs (in ≥5% of subjects) were akathisia (11.1%), injection site pain (10.6%), insomnia (10.0%), 
weight increased (8.5%), parkinsonism (6.4%), and headache (5.4%). 
In the double-blind period compared to placebo weight increased (8.5% vs. 4.7%), nasopharyngitis 
(5.5% vs. 3.5%), headache (5.5% vs. 3.5%), hyperprolactinaemia (4.3% vs. 1.2%), and pyrexia (3.7% 
vs. 1.2%) were described. 
Regarding serious adverse events (SAE) in the open label period the majority of reported SAEs belonged 
to psychiatric disorders SOC - schizoaffective disorders and suicidal ideation. In the double blind period 
the greater proportion of reported SAE were psychiatric disorders SOC- schizoaffective disorders in 2 
subjects, compared to 7 subjects in the placebo group. 
Other adverse events of clinical interest were extrapyramidal syndrome (akatisia, parkinsonism, tremor 
and dyskinesia), glucose related adverse events and prolactin-related adverse events.  
There are no new safety concerns. Reported adverse events in the study SCA 3004 are relevantly 
described and labeled in the SmPC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There are no known uncertainties about any unfavourable effects. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The results of study SCA-3004 show that treatment with paliperidone palmitate resulted in a statistically 
significant delay in the time to relapse in subjects with schizoaffective disorder.  
For each of the secondary efficacy analyses of PSP, PANSS total score, HAM-D-21 score, HAM-D-17 score, 
YMRS score, and CGI-S-SCA overall score there was a statistically significant (p<0.001) difference 
between treatment groups  in favor of paliperidone palmitate. 
After re-evaluation of acute antidepressant efficacy in subgroup of subjects with prominent depressive 
symptoms in pooled data from short-term, placebo controlled studies, the difference in reduction in 
HAM-D-17 total score between active and placebo group was 3.0 (p=0.002), is a clinical relevant 
difference in favor for paliperidone. 
There are no new safety concerns. There is no need for any update of the SmPC. The adverse events 
reported are described in the SmPC. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
For the current application, the MAH has submitted a long-term maintenance study with paliperidone 
palmitate and relevant pharmacokinetic data on switching from oral paliperidone to paliperidone 
palmitate as a post-authorization measure. The population pharmacokinetic model suggests that steady 
Assessment report

Page 58/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
state exposures are similar between the two formulations thus supporting the extrapolation of efficacy 
and safety between formulations. 
The long-term maintenance study SCA-3004 has demonstrated that paliperidone palmitate when 
compared with placebo significantly delays relapse in subjects with schizoaffective disorder which 
supports maintenance of efficacy for paliperidone palmitate. An effect on depressive symptoms of 
schizoaffective disorder is supported by time to relapse analysis (manic and depressive type) which was 
longer for subjects who continued on paliperidone palmitate in the double-blind period compared to 
placebo(p=0.009 and p=0.004, respectively, for manic and depressive type). Moreover, a lower risk of 
relapse has been observed in paliperidone palmitate group than the placebo group during double-blind 
period and risk of relapse due to depressive symptoms was higher for the patients in the placebo group 
(relative risk 3,13 (95% CI: 1.39; 6.98). The mean change in HAM-D-17 total score from baseline of the 
double-blind period was favourable for active treatment as a significant difference of -2.1 (p=0.001) has 
been observed.  
Supportive results are also demonstrated with the analysis of CGI-S-SCA Depressive symptom domain. 
The subgroup analyses based on the concomitant antidepressants also suggested that treatment with 
paliperidone provided additional antidepressant efficacy. 
The pooled subgroup (HAM-D-17>16) analysis of previously submitted studies SCA-3001 and SCA-3002 
is crucial for evaluation of antidepressant efficacy efficacy following short-term treatment. A statistical 
and clinically significant improvement in HAM-D-17 total score is shown at the group level. A clinical 
relevant difference in reduction of HAM-D-17 total score between active and placebo group was 3.0 
(p=0.002) in favour for paliperidone, which is comparable with the results presented by antidepressants 
in placebo-controlled studies in major depression. This key result is more or less supported in the other 
presented analyses. The remission analysis (HAM-D-17 total score ≤7) and responder analysis (≥50% 
improvement in HAM-D-17 score at end point), presented differences favouring paliperidone palmitate 
treatment, 11.1 %-points (p=0.041) and 11.4 (p=0.054), respectively. However, when discontinuing 
patients were assumed as non-responders (data not presented by the MAH) the differences decreased to 
6.8 and 8.5, respectively.  As a secondary end-point, improvement in CGI-S-SCA Depressive score has 
also been evaluated in the pooled data from studies SCA-3001 and -3002 that resulted in favour of 
paliperidone palmitate. 
In summary, the totality of the provided data from short-term and long-term studies supports the efficacy 
of Invega in reduction of depressive symptoms in schizoaffective disorder as a monotherapy or additional 
to treatment with antidepressants or mood stabilizers. This conclusion is not only based on statistically 
and clinically significant improvement in HAM D-17 score in patients with prominent depressive 
symptoms in the SCA-3004 study. The applicant was also requested to demonstrate via a detailed and 
comprehensive analysis the short and long-term effects on depressive symptoms and discuss their 
clinical relevance.  
The MAH provided indeed additional analyses of data from patients with prominent depressive symptoms 
that have participated in the short-term studies SCA-3001 and SCA-3002 as well as the long-term study 
SCA-3004. The HAM D-17 scale includes the first 17 items in the HAM-D-21 and therefore excludes those 
items that may be attributed to psychosis/mania. The provided additional analyses have shown 
significant reduction in HAM D-17 score and favorable remission and response rate in Invega treated 
patients compared to placebo. Moreover, a lower risk of relapse, particularly due to depressive 
symptoms, has been shown with long-term treatment in study SCA-3004. These findings are supported 
by the significant improvements in CGI-S-SCA Depressive score and subgroup analyses based on the 
concomitant antidepressants which overall suggesting antidepressant efficacy of Invega treatment. 
Having reviewed the available data, the CHMP considered that the proposed removal of caveats on the 
effect on depressive symptoms in the SmPc is supported. 
There are no new safety concerns. There is no need for any update of the safety sections of the SmPC.  
The adverse events reported are described in the SmPC.

Conclusion 
The benefit risk for Invega in treatment of schizoaffective disorder is positive. Efficacy and safety in 
maintenance therapy has been demonstrated, as effects on depressive symptoms. The variation is 
considered approvable.

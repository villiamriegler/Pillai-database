INTRODUCTION 
On 24 October 2011, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Evoltra (clofarabine), in 
accordance with Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended on medicinal products 
for paediatric use. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Evoltra 
(clofarabine) and that there is no consequential regulatory action. 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the clinical study(ies) 
According to the MAH, Clofarabine finished product, 1 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion, is 
formulated in 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline), and is diluted for injection in 0.9% sodium 
chloride. The finished product formulation does not contain antioxidants or antimicrobial preservatives 
and is considered suitable for the paediatric use. The IV formulation of clofarabine used in CLO08808 is 
the same formulation that has been extensively studied and approved in the US and EU for single-
agent clofarabine therapy in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory ALL.

  Methods 
  Objectives :  
The  primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  of  1  cycle  of  the  5-drug  regimen  (clofarabine, 
etoposide,  cyclophosphamide,  PEG-asparaginase,  and  vincristine)  in  paediatric  patients  with  ALL  who 
were in first bone marrow relapse.  
The secondary objectives  were to  evaluate the tolerability of the 5-drug regimen and to  examine the 
efficacy of the 5-drug regimen in paediatric patients with ALL who were in first bone marrow relapse. 
The exploratory objectives were to determine the proportion of paediatric patients with ALL who were 
able  to  proceed  to  hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplant  after  receiving  the  5-drug  regimen  and  to 
quantify the amount of minimal residual disease after 1 cycle of the 5-drug regimen. 
  Study design 
Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, safety and tolerability pilot combination study. 
  Study population /Sample size 
Main criteria for inclusion/exclusion:  
Patients ≥1 and ≤30 years old with a diagnosis of pre-B or T-cell ALL in first relapse with a duration of 
remission of ≥6 months (and have received no more than 2 prior induction regimens prior to the date 
of first relapse) with >25% blasts in the bone marrow; no active central nervous system leukemia or 
Burkitt’s lymphoma; Karnofsky Performance Status of ≥50 for patients >10 years of age or a Lansky 
Performance  Status  of  ≥50  for  patients  ≤  10  years  of  age;  adequate  liver,  renal,  pancreatic,  and 
cardiac function as defined by the protocol; and no previous stem cell transplantation, treatment with 
clofarabine, or high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue regimen.  
Sample size: 
Six patients were to be initially enrolled to receive a cycle of study drugs. If no excessive toxicity was 
seen (as defined by dose-limiting toxicities [DLTs]), up to 6 additional patients were to be enrolled for 
a total of 12 patients who were evaluable for toxicity. 
 
Treatments 
Treatment:  Patients  received  a  maximum  of  2  cycles  of  the  intravenous  (IV)  5-drug  regimen 
(clofarabine,  etoposide,  cyclophosphamide,  PEG-asparaginase,  and  vincristine)  plus  intrathecal 
methotrexate, and then entered follow-up. Patients who achieved complete remission (CR) or complete 
remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) after 1 cycle of study drugs were eligible to receive 
a second cycle of study drugs upon recovery of peripheral blood counts, and patients who did not have 
leukemic progression were eligible to receive a second treatment cycle at the investigator’s discretion. 
After treatment with 2 cycles of the study regimen, any further treatment was to be at the discretion of 
the investigator. After the study treatment period, all patients were to be followed for a minimum of 4 
months beyond the final study visit.

Clofarabine IV 40 mg/m2 (lot # 09-001132 and 10-001565) on Days 1-5. 
Commercially available: etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV on Days 1-5, cyclophosphamide 440 mg/m2 IV on 
Days 1-5, PEG-asparaginase 2500 IU/m2 IV on Day 15, vincristine 1.5 mg/m2 (maximum dose: 2 mg) 
IV on Days 15 and 22. 
Intrathecal methotrexate (dosing based on age) on Day 1 and Day 15 (Cycle 1) and Day 1 (Cycle 2). 
  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint:  
-  Safety  of  1  cycle  of  the  5-drug  regimen,  as  assessed  by  the  incidence  of  dose-limiting  toxicities 
(DLTs) reported in this patient population. 
Secondary endpoints:  
-  Tolerability  of  the  5-drug  regimen,  as  assessed  by  the  overall  toxicity  profile  (i.e.,  incidence  of 
adverse  events  [AEs],  serious  adverse  events  [SAEs],  and/or  DLTs),  in  patients  who  were  able  to 
receive  at  least  80%  of  the  total  planned  doses  of  clofarabine,  etoposide,  and  cyclophosphamide  in 
addition to the Day 15 PEG-asparaginase and vincristine doses 
- Efficacy of the 5-drug regimen, as assessed by: 
Complete remission (CR) 
Time to remission 
Duration of remission 
Event-free survival (EFS), 4-month EFS, disease-free survival, and overall survival 
Exploratory endpoints: 
- Proportion of patients who were able to proceed to HSCT 
- Quantification of MRD after 1 cycle of the 5-drug regimen 
  Statistical Methods 
Descriptive  statistics  were  provided  for  the  patient  disposition,  demographics,  clofarabine  exposure, 
and  safety  data.  Continuous  variables  were  summarized  using  N,  mean,  standard  deviation  (SD), 
median,  range;  and  categorical  variables  were  summarized  using  the  frequency  count  and  the 
percentage of patients in each category. Efficacy data were listed by patient. All 8 enrolled and treated 
patients were included in the analyses. 
  Results 
  Recruitment/ Number analysed

8 patients were enrolled, treated, and analyzed. 
All 8 patients initiated the 5-drug regimen (all 8 patients received clofarabine, etoposide, and 
clyclophosphamide; 6 of the patients also received vincristine; 5 of the patients also received PEG-
asparaginase), and 7 of the patients also received IT methotrexate. 
  Baseline data 
The patients ranged from 4 to 23 years old (mean age 11.0 years, standard deviation 7.09 years). Two 
patients  were  male  and  6  patients  were  female.  Five  patients  were  White,  2  patients  were  Black  or 
African American, and 1 patient was El Salvadorian/Mexican. Each of the 8 patients initiated 1 cycle of 
study drugs.  
  Efficacy results 
Of  the  8  treated  patients,  3  achieved  CR,  1  achieved  CRp,  and  2  achieved  partial  remission  (PR).  Of 
the  patients  with  CR,  time  to  remission  ranged  from  5.7  to  6.7  weeks,  duration  of  remission  ranged 
from  0.1  to  2.7  weeks,  and  DFS  ranged  from  12.3  to  35.0  weeks.  Among  all  8  patients,  EFS  and 
overall survival each ranged from 7.7 to 45.4 weeks, and 6 of  the 8 patients achieved  4-month EFS. 
Two of the 3 patients who achieved CR (002-0002 and 003-0006) were alive at last follow-up. One of 
the  patients  with  CR  and  1  of  the  patients  with  PR  (002-0002  and  001-0001,  respectively)  received 
post-study hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allogeneic bone marrow transplant), and both achieved 
successful neutrophil engraftment (in 21 days and 30 days, respectively). Both patients were alive at 
last follow-up. 
A  total  of  4  patients  died,  all  during  the  study  follow-up  period.  One  patient  died  because  of  an  AE, 
fungal (mucormycosis) pneumonia; the other 3 patients died due to progression of ALL.  
No  summary  analyses  of  efficacy  data  were  performed  since  no  efficacy  conclusions  could  be  drawn 
from the study due to the small number of patients enrolled. 
  Safety results 
Four  of  the  8  patients  experienced  a  DLT,  which  met  the  protocol-specified  criterion  for  stopping  the 
study (DLTs in >3 of 9 patients).  
For 3 of the 4 patients with DLTs, the DLT occurred after the patient received clofarabine, etoposide, 
and cyclophosphamide but before receipt of any vincristine or PEG-asparaginase. Each of the DLTs was 
considered by the investigator to be related to clofarabine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide. All of the 
DLTs  were  SAEs:  1  patient  had  Grade  3  bone  marrow  aplasia,  1  patient  had  Grade  4  bone  marrow 
aplasia, 1 patient had Grade 4 increased total bilirubin, and 1 patient had Grade 4 increased lipase.  
Each  of  the  8  enrolled  patients  experienced  at  least  1  AE  during  the  study.  Blood  and  Lymphatic 
System  Disorders,  Gastrointestinal  Disorders,  Metabolism  and  Nutrition  Disorders,  and  Skin  and 
Subcutaneous  Tissue  Disorders  were  the  most  commonly  affected  system  organ  classes.  The  AEs 
occurring in the majority of patients (at least 5 of 8 patients) were nausea (8 [100.0%] patients each); 
anemia,  decreased  appetite,  and  vomiting  (7  [87.5%]  patients  each);  abdominal  pain,  febrile 
neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia (6 [75.0%] patients each); and diarrhea (5 [62.5%] patients). The 
most frequent Grade 3 AEs were febrile neutropenia (6 [75.0%] patients) and anemia and decreased 
appetite (3 [37.5%] patients each); and the most common Grade 4 events were thrombocytopenia (6 
[75.0%]  patients),  anemia  (4  [50.0%]  patients),  leukopenia  and  neutropenia  (3  [37.5%]  patients

each), and lipase increased and lymphopenia (2 [25.0%] patients each. One patient had a Grade 5 AE 
(fungal pneumonia), which was considered related to clofarabine, etoposide, and  cyclophosphamide.  
Among  the  most  common  AEs,  most  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  the  study 
regimen (i.e., related to at least 1 of the drugs in the 5-drug regimen and/or methotrexate). Most of 
the AEs were considered related to clofarabine as well as at least 1 of the other study drugs. The AEs 
that  were  considered  related  to  clofarabine  only  were  headache  (Patient  001-0001);  mucosal 
inflammation (Patient 003-0006); dry skin, palmar erythema, skin exfoliation, and blister (Patient 003-
0008); and pyrexia, chills, and rash (Patient 006-0007). All of the AEs related to clofarabine only were 
nonserious and Grade 1 or 2 with the exception of pyrexia, which was nonserious and Grade 3.  
Four  patients  had  SAEs.  The  most  common  SAE  was  bone  marrow  aplasia,  which  occurred  in  2 
patients.  Most  of  the  SAEs  were  considered  related  to  clofarabine,  etoposide,  and  cyclophosphamide. 
Two patients discontinued study treatment because of AEs (increased bilirubin; bone marrow aplasia); 
both of these events were SAEs and DLTs.  
With  respect  to  AEs  of  particular  interest,  4  patients  had  hepatic  AEs  (increased  transaminases  or 
bilirubin),  which  were  considered  related  to  clofarabine,  etoposide,  and  cyclophosphamide;  however, 
there were no incidences of veno-occlusive disease. Three patients had AEs of increased lipase. For 1 
of these patients, the increase in lipase was an SAE and a DLT. This patient had a concomitant increase 
in amylase, and an abdominal ultrasound revealed a mildly swollen pancreas. The increased lipase for 
the  other  2  patients  was  considered  nonserious;  1  of  these  patients  had  a  concomitant  increase  in 
amylase.  
Three  patients  had  at  least  1  infection  during  the  study,  and  most  of  the  infections  were  considered 
related to clofarabine and at least 1 of the other study drugs.  
A  total  of  4  patients  died,  all  during  the  study  follow-up  period.  One  patient  died  because  of  an  AE, 
fungal (mucormycosis) pneumonia, 54 days after the first dose of study drug and 50 days after the last 
dose. The other 3 patients died due to progression of ALL, ≥118 days after the first dose and ≥97 days 
after the last dose.  
Hematology  and  chemistry  laboratory  parameters  were  assessed  at  baseline  and  post  baseline.  For 
hematology,  most  patients  had  treatment-emergent  worsening  to  Grade  3  or  Grade  4  lymphopenia, 
leukopenia,  thrombocytopenia,  and  anemia.  For  neutropenia,  4  patients  had  treatment-emergent 
worsening  to  Grade  4,  and  the  other  4  patients  had  Grade  4  neutropenia  at  both  baseline  and  post-
baseline.  For  chemistry,  the  worst  post-baseline  grade  for  most  patients  was  ≤  Grade  2,  with  the 
exception of lipase. Five patients had a treatment- emergent worsening to Grade 3 or Grade 4 lipase. 
3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Along  with  the  results  of  the  Phase  I/II  CLO21800205  study,  this  study  was  designed  to  inform  the 
detailed  design  of  an  upcoming  Phase  III  randomized  controlled  trial  (AALL1131),  which  is  being 
planned  by  the  Children’s  Cancer  Group  (COG)  to  confirm  clinical  benefit  in  a  population  of  pediatric 
patients with newly diagnosed very high risk ALL. In CLO21800205, the recommended Phase II doses 
(RP2Ds) of the 3-drug regimen of clofarabine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide were determined and 
showed promising efficacy results and an acceptable toxicity profile in pediatric patients with relapsed 
or refractory ALL or acute myeloid leukemia. However, there was a high incidence of severe infections 
in Phase II of the study, and outcomes were particularly poor in patients with poor performance status 
at baseline.  
The current study was designed to assess the feasibility of adding vincristine and PEG-asparaginase to 
the  RP2Ds  of  clofarabine,  etoposide,  and  cyclophosphamide  as  determined  in  CLO21800205.  If

the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

acceptable  safety  and  tolerability  were  demonstrated  in  this  study,  the  5-drug  regimen  would  then 
serve  as  the  experimental  arm  of  the  proposed  COG  Phase  III  trial.  In  this  study,  4  of  the  first  8 
patients had DLTs. The DLTs were bone marrow aplasia (2 patients), increased lipase (1 patient), and 
increased  bilirubin  (1  patient).  For  3  of  the  4  patients  with  DLTs,  the  DLT  occurred  after  the  patient 
received  clofarabine,  etoposide,  and  cyclophosphamide  but  before  receipt  of  any  vincristine  or  PEG-
asparaginase.  These  events  are  expected  for  clofarabine  and  do  not  represent  a  new  safety  signal. 
However,  the  frequency  of  DLTs  met  the  criteria  for  stopping  the  study,  and  the  study  was  closed. 
Because of the toxicity profile observed during this pilot study, the COG determined that the doses of 
clofarabine, etoposide, and/or cyclophosphamide in the 3-drug backbone should be modified for their 
upcoming AALL1131 randomized Phase III trial. Specifically, the dose of clofarabine for that study will 
be  reduced  to  30  mg/m2.  Data  from  the  current  study,  as  well  as  from  the  CLO21800205  study, 
suggest 
the  3-drug  backbone  (clofarabine,  etoposide,  and 
cyclophosphamide)  warrants  careful  consideration  of  the  patient  eligibility  criteria  and  study  drug 
doses.

Rapporteur’s Overall Conclusion AND RECOMMENDATION 
  Overall conclusion 
Clofarabine  is  approved  in  the  EU  for  the  treatment  of  acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  (ALL)  in 
paediatric patients who have relapsed or are refractory after receiving at least two prior regimens and 
where  there  is  no  other  treatment  option  anticipated  to  result  in  a  durable  response.  Safety  and 
efficacy  have  been  assessed  in  studies  of  patients  ≤  21  years  old  at  initial  diagnosis.  The 
recommended  dose  is  52 mg/m2  of  body  surface  area  administered  in  monotherapy,  by  intravenous 
infusion over 2 hours daily for 5 consecutive days. 
Phase  I  study  CLO08808  was  designed  to  assess  safety  and  tolerability  of  a  5-drug  regimen 
(clofarabine, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, PEG-asparaginase) for patients with relapsed or 
refractory  ALL.  The  results  were  to  inform  the  design  of  an  upcoming  phase  III  trial  in  first  line 
treatment of newly diagnosed very high risk ALL in paediatric patients (AALL1131).  
Patients ranged from 4 to 23 years old (mean 11.0, SD 7.09). In the frame of a report on a paediatric 
study, submitted in accordance with Article 46 of regulation (EC) N01901/2006, the MAH should have 
presented results specifically in the paediatric population. 
The  primary  outcome  of  study  CLO08808  was  the  incidence  of  DLTs  during  1  cycle  of  the  5-drug 
regimen. The study was closed due to occurrence of 4 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) among 8 included 
patients,  meeting  the  protocol-specified  criterion  for  stopping  the  study  (>  3  DLTs  for  9  patients). 
Three  of  the  4  DLTs  occurred  while  patients  had  only  received  the  3-drug  backbone  association 
(clofarabine  +  etoposide  +  cyclophosphamide)  but  before  receipt  of  the  two  complementary  drugs 
(vincristine and PEG-asparaginase). Four patients had one SAE. Seven patients experienced AE, Grade 
4 or 5. Five patients had a treatment- emergent worsening to Grade 3 or Grade 4 lipase. 
Overall,  safety  results  from  study  CLO08808  are  consistent  with  results  from  study  CLO21800205 
(please  refer  to  Evoltra  P46  –  Paediatric  Article  46  Follow  Up  Measure  033  AR),  showing  a  high  – 
toxicity  profile  of  the  3-drug  backbone  combination  (Recommended  Phase  2  Doses  (RP2Ds)  : 
Clofarabine 40mg/m² + Etoposide 100mg/m² + Cyclophosphamide 440 mg/m²), let alone the 5-drug 
combination.  
In  the  dose-escalation  study  CLO21800205,  safety  results  showed  that  the  combined  regimen  at  the 
RP2Ds is associated with a very high toxicity as evidenced by the 80.0% patients who experienced at 
least 1 related SAE and 3 cases of veno-occlusive disease reported in the phase II study. Last patient 
completed  study  drug  in  November  2009.  Hence,  it  is  unclear  why  the  same  R2PD,  known  to  induce

high  toxicity,  was  used  in  a  5-drug  regimen  in  study  CLO08808  (First  Patient  Consented:  January 
2010). 
No  efficacy  conclusions  could  be  drawn  from  CLO08808  study  due  to  the  small  number  of  patients 
included.  
With respects to these findings, further investigations with both drug combinations (3 or 5 drugs) are 
needed  but  require  particular  caution,  especially  for  the  upcoming  AALL1131  phase  III  trial.  Even  if 
dosing  of  clofarabine  will  be  reduced  from  40  to  30mg/m²  for  this  trial,  as  mentioned  by  the  MAH, 
safety and tolerability of clofarabine in drug combinations remain a key issue to be closely monitored. 
The  high  toxicity  profile  of  the  combinations  can  only  be  balanced  by  a  clear  efficacy  benefit  that 
remains to be shown in the studied (first relapse) and targeted (first line) populations. 
  Recommendation  
  Fulfilled –  
However, within the next PSUR, the MAH should provide detailed information concerning: 
- 
- 
the four censored patients,  
the two patients who received post-study allogeneic bone marrow transplant, with follow-up 
data.

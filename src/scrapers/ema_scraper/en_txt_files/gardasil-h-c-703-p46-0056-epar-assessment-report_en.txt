I.INTRODUCTION 
On  October  5,  2009,  the  MAH  submitted  two  completed  paediatric  studies  for  Gardasil/Silgard  in 
accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  amended,  on  medicinal  products  for 
paediatric use. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The  MAH  stated  that  the  submitted  paediatric  studies  do  not  influence  the  benefit  risk  for 
Gardasil/Silgard and that there is no consequential regulatory action. 
II.SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This study was planned to prove that rate of serious vaccine

to achieve this objective

Treatments 
Participants  received  a  total  of  3  intramuscular  injections  of  Gardasil/Silgard,  the    quadrivalent 
HPV  VLP  Vaccine  (HPV  types  6/11/16/18)  which  contained  20/40/40/20  mcg  in  a  0.5  mL  dose. 
Vaccine was administered at time 0, Month 2 and Month 6. 
Serological response using the competitive Luminex Immunoassay was measured at Month 7. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
• 
The main immunogenicity measurements used to address this objective were:  
1.  Among  subjects  who  were  baseline  naïve  to  HPV  6,  HPV  11,  HPV  16,  and/or  HPV  18,  the 
proportion who became seropositive to the relevant vaccine HPV type by Month 7.

Month 7.  
The  quadrivalent  human  papillomavirus  (HPV)  competitive  Luminex  immunoassay  (cLIA)  was 
used to detect antibody to HPV virus-like particles (VLPs), serotypes 6, 11, 16, 18 before and 
after  vaccination  with  the  HPV  quadrivalent  vaccine.  The  seropositivity  cutoffs  for  the  HPV  6, 
11,  16,  and  18  cLIAs  are  20  mMU/mL,  16  mMU/mL,  20  mMU/mL,and  24  mMU/mL, 
respectively.

Serum samples were to be collected from all subjects at Day 1 and Month 7. 
Safety  was  assessed  by  injection  site  reactions,  systemic  adverse  reactions  (up  to  14  days 
after each injection), and serious adverse events.  
•  Statistical Methods 
Continuous  variables  were  summarized  using  mean,  standard  deviation,  median,  minimum, 
and  maximum,  while  categorical  variables  were  summarized  using  proportions  (counts  and 
percentages). 
Data on subject disposition (number of subjects enrolled, number of dropouts, and reasons for 
dropout),  demographics  (gender,  age,  weight,  height  and  BMI),  and  other  baseline 
characteristics were summarized. 
The seroconversion rates and geometric mean titers (GMTs) to each of HPV type 6, 11, 16, and 
18  were  summarized  by  time
point  with  95%  confidence  intervals.  Exact  95%  confidence 
intervals were provided for the seroconversion rates. For the GMTs, 95% confidence intervals 
were provided based on the asymptotic t
distribution.

Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 110 subjects were enrolled for participation at 7 investigative sites. One hundred and 
eight subjects who had follow-up data were included in the safety analyses.  Two subjects did 
not  complete  the  vaccination  regimen.  One  subject  had  month  7  serum  sample  for 
study 
Immunogenicity collected outside the acceptable day range and one subject received non
vaccine  (Tetanus  toxoid)  during  the  study.  Hence  106  subjects  were  eligible 
for 
Immunogenicity analysis.

Table  3  presents  a  summary  of  the  percentages  of  subjects  who  seroconverted  for  each 
vaccine  HPV  type  at  4  weeks  postdose  3,  in  different  age  groups,  in  the  per-protocol 
immunogenicity  group.  Estimated  seroconversion  rates  and  associated  95%  confidence 
intervals  are  shown  for  each  vaccine  HPV  type.  Overall,  >96%  of  subjects  seroconverted  by 
Week  4  Postdose  3,  for  each  of  the  4  HPV  types  summarized  in  the  per-protocol 
immunogenicity  group.  Therefore,  GARDASIL®  induced  acceptable  anti-HPV  6,  11,  16,  18 
responses in females 9 to 15 years of age in India.

GMTs  measured  4  weeks  Postdose  3  in  the  per-protocol  immunogenicity  group.  Analysis  per 
age  group  revealed  that  GMTs  in  younger  subjects  (9  to  12  years  of  age)  were  more  robust 
than those in older subjects (13 to 15 years of age).

Safety results 
Overall, 63(58%) subjects who received GARDASIL® reported at least one adverse experience. 
The  most  frequent  adverse  experience  was  injection  site  adverse  experience,  which  was 
reported for 50 (46%) subjects.  
There  were  35  (32%)  subjects  with  systemic  adverse  experiences.  Pyrexia  was  the  most 
common  systemic  adverse  experience  observed  in  25  (23%)  subjects.  The  next  common 
systemic AE was nasopharyngitis reported by 8 (7%) subjects. Two subjects (2%) had severe 
systemic adverse experience (diarrhoea and vomiting).

Most  of  the  injection  site  adverse  experiences  were  reported  after  the  first  dose  of  vaccine. 
These  injection  site  adverse  experiences  decreased  after  the  second  and  third  vaccination 
doses. 
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
Among  healthy  subjects  between  the  ages  of  9  years  and  15  years  in  India  who  received 
GARDASIL®, the following conclusions can be drawn: 
1.  The administration of a 3-dose regimen of quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 
VLP vaccine to 9 to 15 year old female induces over 96% seroconversion rate for anti-
HPV 6, anti- HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18. 
2.  The administration of a 3-dose regimen of quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 
VLP vaccine to 9 to15 year old female induces robust geometric titers for anti-HPV 6, 
anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18. 
3.  The administration of a 3-dose regimen of quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 
VLP vaccine to 9 to 15 year old female is generally well tolerated.

Recruitment/ Number analysed 
All  40  subjects  were  included  in  the  safety  set.  Generally,  during  the  whole  observation  period 
(14-day  follow  up),  21  subjects  occurred  at  least  1  monitored  adverse  experience  (local  and/or 
systemic), 10 subjects in Group 1 (50%), 11 subjects in Group 2 (55%). 
Safety results 
During 14 days follow up, the rate of observed local and systemic adverse reaction was 52.50%, 
and the rate of adverse events related to vaccine was 40.00%. All adverse events were expected 
common reactions, mild in intensity, and medical treatments were not required.  
No  serious  adverse  experiences  or  vaccine-related  adverse  experiences  occurred  during  study 
period, none of severe local or systemic adverse experiences was observed. No acute allergic was 
observed within 30 minutes after first dosage in two groups. In one subject in group aged 9-17, 
occurred  mild  fever,  there  was  no  reaction  in  other  subjects.  The  systemic  adverse  experiences 
incidence  rate  was  43%,  the  incidence  rate  of  all  systemic  adverse  experiences  related  to 
vaccination  was  18%.  Generally  all  systemic  adverse  experiences  were  mild.  Table  1  presents  a

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The current guidelines for antiretroviral (ARV) treatment of HIV infection recommend initial treatment 
with a combination of 3 drugs, 2 of which should be nucleoside / nucleotide reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors (NRTI/NtRTI) and a third drug that may be a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor 
(NNRTI) or protease inhibitor. Studies have demonstrated the therapeutic benefit of a NNRTI-combined 
regimen including nevirapine. In addition, several published studies revealed that the primary factor 
leading to long term treatment success was adherence to treatment along with the potency of the drug 
combination. In order to increase adherence, once a day treatment regimens are now favoured by both 
physicians and patients. 
Nevirapine was developed as the first non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). 
Nevirapine binds directly to reverse transcriptase and blocks the RNA-dependant and DNA-dependant 
polymerase activities by causing disruption of the enzyme’s catalytic site. HIV-2 reverse transcriptase 
and eukaryotic DNA polymerases (such as human DNA polymerases α, β, γ or δ) are not inhibited by 
nevirapine. 
The efficacy of nevirapine was demonstrated in adequate and well controlled clinical studies to support 
approval for use in HIV infected patients at 200 mg BID in the US and in the European Union (EU). 
Since then, BI and external investigators have continued to study the safety and efficacy of nevirapine. 
Nevirapine tablets (immediate release [IR]) received first marketing authorization in the USA in June 
1996 (marketed as Viramune) and subsequently in the European Union in February 1998 through the 
centralised procedure. An oral suspension formulation was firstly approved in the US in September 
1998 and in the European Union in June 1999. Subsequent approvals for the tablets and the oral 
suspension have been obtained in over 100 countries. 
The nevirapine XR programme was developed to improve treatment convenience, and thus, potentially 
adherence, by providing once daily administration, while maintaining the efficacy provided by an 
adequate Cmin,ss as well as safety.  
Based on the 2NN study efficacy and pharmacokinetic data, the Marketing Authorisation Holder for 
Viramune developed a strategy for development of a prolonged release formulation in adults and 
children, targeting a reduced nevirapine exposure with a lower nevirapine Cmax and AUC while 
maintaining adequate nevirapine Cmin levels. In adults, the target PK profile of the prolonged release 
formulation was a median Cmin,ss of 3 μg/ml +/- 0.5 (>15 fold higher than the IC95 for wild type-

virus [710nM]) with a Cmax/Cmin ratio <1.5. In the paediatric population, the applicant targeted 
comparable PK parameters. Based on these PK data, the nevirapine XR formulation was expected to 
produce at least comparable efficacy and safety to the marketed product as described previously (P06-
05584).  
Based on these hypotheses and objectives, the clinical programme was developed to examine different 
XR formulations, test and verify the pharmacokinetic characteristic of each of them and select the final 
formulation for confirmatory testing in an adequately powered placebo-controlled, randomised study in 
treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adult patients, as well as in a comparative clinical study of adult 
patients switching over from nevirapine IR to Nevirapine XR. This programme includes the first major 
study of >1000 randomised patients that has applied the CD4+ thresholds prospectively.  
Nevirapine XR tablet was investigated to support the same therapeutic indication as the nevirapine IR 
tablet. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
By this extension procedure, a new pharmaceutical form – prolonged-release tablet – is introduced. 
Three strengths of the product, 50 mg, 100 mg and 400 mg, were developed.  They are yellow, 
distinguished by shape and debossing: the 50 mg tablets are round, biconvex with “V5” on one side 
and “BI” on the other; the 100 mg strength is round, biconvex, debossed with “V01” on one side and 
BI tower logo on the other side and the 400 mg tablets are oval, biconvex, debossed with “V04” on 
one side and BI tower logo on the other side.  
The prolonged-release tablets are composed of the active substance nevirapine (in anhydrous form) 
and excipients, defined in the SmPC Section 6.1.  
The tablets are packaged in HDPE bottles and PVC/alu blisters (400 mg strength only). 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance, nevirapine, anhydrous is identical to the substance already authorised in 
Viramune immediate-release tablets 200 mg. The active substance’s physicochemical properties, 
synthesis, controls, and stability are fully described in the approved marketing authorization 
application for the 200 mg tablets. Reference is therefore made to this approved information. 
Figure 1: 
The drug substance is classified as a Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Class II compound 
due to its low solubility and high intestinal permeability. Nevirapine is a weak base and solubility within 
the physiologic range is strongly pH dependent, with increased solubility at acidic pH.

Particle size is controlled in the drug substance specification. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Formulation development focused on the adult strength 400 mg prolonged-release tablets. All three 
strengths, 50 mg, 100 mg, and 400 mg, have identical relative proportion of excipients. Thus, the 
formulation studies, while performed for the 400 mg, also apply directly to the lower strength tablets, 
intended for paediatric use. 
All excipients in the nevirapine prolonged-release tablets are of compendial quality and are 
commercially available. The excipients selected for the formulation are: lactose monohydrate as a 
soluble diluent; hypromellose; magnesium stearate (vegetable origin) as a lubricant; purified water as 
a granulating agent and iron oxide yellow (E172) as a colorant.  
A hydrophilic matrix system tablet design was developed using hypromellose (HPMC) as the rate-
controlling polymer. Hypromellose is a methyl- and hydroxypropyl- mixed ether of cellulose and is 
differentiated based on its substitution type, in a range of viscosities. During a series of formulation 
studies, several types of prototype tablets were designed.  
Hypromellose is commonly used in modified release products. The polymer is uniformly incorporated 
throughout the tablet. Upon contact with water, the polymer hydrates on the outer tablet surface to 
form a gel layer. The rate controlling mechanism for drug release in vivo is tablet erosion.  
Compatibility of nevirapine with hypromellose and the other formulation components lactose, 
magnesium stearate and yellow iron oxide was confirmed. 
Adventitious agents 
The only excipient of human or animal origin is lactose monohydrate. All appropriate information on 
TSE safety for this excipient was provided.  
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process for nevirapine prolonged-release tablets is a conventional high shear wet 
granulation process, followed by fluid bed drying, milling, final blending, and compression into tablets 
using a rotary tablet press. In-process controls include loss on drying in granulate and weight, 
hardness, thickness and friability of final tablets. The description of the manufacturing process is now 
sufficient, after updates requested during the evaluation process.  
The manufacturing process validation of Nevirapine prolonged-release tablets was performed with 
three successive full production scale batches of Nevirapine 50 mg and 100 mg prolonged-release 
tablets and six full production scale batches of Nevirapine 400 mg prolonged-release tablets.  
Product specification 
The specification for all strengths of the finished product includes standard testing parameters typical 
for this kind of dosage form. The finished product is tested for identification, description, assay, 
degradation products, uniformity of dosage units by mass variation and dissolution.  The specification 
tests and limits are acceptable. 
Impurities/degradation products have been evaluated and found to be acceptable from the safety 
perspective. 
Assessment report  
EMA/838269/2011  
Page 8/84
 
 
 
Analytical methods used for the finished product control were sufficiently described and appropriately 
validated.  
Batch results confirm compliance with the proposed product specifications and show good 
manufacturing consistency.  
The dissolution method used was discussed during the procedure. The applicant does not use sink 
conditions for the highest strength; in addition, phosphate buffer with pH of 6.8 was used as the 
medium instead of acidic conditions, with 2% of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). A clarification was 
requested to justify these parameters.  
Due to prolonged-release characteristics of the tablets, the predominant environment where the tablet 
would be absorbed is small intestine, thus justifying pH of the media to be 6.8. Dissolution in the acidic 
conditions at pH 1 (without SDS) was examined and found to be much slower than in the pH 6.8 and 
incomplete after 24 hours in contrast to the in vivo behaviour. No dose dumping is seen. The choice of 
pH 6.8 was therefore fully supported.     
Biorelevance of the dissolution test was also studied. The release rate from 50 mg tablets is faster than 
from 100 mg and 400 mg prolonged-release tablet, depending on the tablet volume and surface area; 
this was proved in vivo by pharmacokinetic studies. The in vitro dissolution behaviour of the product 
was extensively tested, using different media volumes and SDS concentrations. SDS in the 
concentration of 2% adds discriminatory value to the dissolution method used and reflects release rate 
of the active substance in plasma. The sink conditions for the 400 mg tablets were not considered 
optimal by the applicant, as the applicant considered more important to have a biorelevant test closely 
simulating the environment in the gastrointestinal tract rather than artificially imposed sink conditions 
The assessment of the applicant’s responses confirmed that the dissolution method is correctly chosen 
on the basis of physiologic relevancy and correlation to in vivo pharmacokinetic results.  
Stability of the product 
The stability studies are carried out in accordance with the current ICH/CHMP guidelines. All tests were 
carried out by validated, stability indicating analytical methods. The parameters tested are description, 
assay, dissolution and degradation products. In addition, tablet hardness, loss on drying and microbial 
quality were monitored for purposes of product characterisation.  
Prolonged-release tablets of all three strengths were placed on stability, three pilot batches (400 mg) 
or three full scale batches (50 mg and 100 mg) per strength.  
Accelerated  studies  (40ºC/75%  RH)  have  been  completed  for  all  monitored  batches.  At  present 
12-month long-term stability results (at 25ºC/60% RH) are available for 50 mg and 100 strengths in 
HDPE bottles and 6-month results are available for 400 mg strength in both HDPE bottles and PVC/alu 
blisters.  No  significant  changes  or  trends  were  observed  so  far.  All  results  comply  with  the  shelf-life 
specifications.  
Results from stress studies and photostability studies show that the product does not need any special 
storage conditions.  
Based on in-use stability study, the product should be used by 2 months from the first opening of the 
bottle. 
The results support the shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
No major objections related to quality were raised during the assessment of this extension application. 
All  other  concerns  were  satisfactorily  addressed  by  the  applicant.  The  quality  of  the  product  is 
considered satisfactory.   
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects  
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  and  drug  product  have 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory 
consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No further non-clinical development was considered necessary. 
All non-clinical data available to date for nevirapine do not change the positive benefit-risk ratio. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  market  introduction  of  this  new  pharmaceutical  form,  Viramune  prolonged-release  tablets, 
developed  to  offer  long-term  treated  HIV-1  patients  a  once-a-day  formulation  for  their  convenience, 
without  a  proposal  for  new  indications  and  without  a  change  in  total  daily  dose,  will  not  result  in  a 
significant increase of environmental exposure to the drug substance, nevirapine and thus an updated 
ERA is not necessary as part of the application.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
The clinical development programme of nevirapine XR for the proposed indication included three Phase 
I studies (Studies 1100. 1484, 1100. 1485 and 1100.1489) and two Phase III studies (Study 1100. 
1486, in treatment-naïve adults, and Study 1526, in adults switching from IR to XR).  
The Phase I studies determined the intestinal absorption of nevirapine, the PK profile, and the optimal 
formulation. 
Three additional Phase I studies were designed to support the use of nevirapine XR in children. Two of 
these were single-dose PK studies in adult healthy volunteers (Studies 1100. 1517 and 1100.1531) 
and evaluated the pharmacokinetics, extended release characteristics and bioavailability of the

paediatric formulation (50 and 100 mg tablets). This was followed by a steady state pharmacokinetic 
study in nevirapine IR treated HIV-1 infected children (Study 1100.1518). 
The following tables summarize the most relevant clinical studies.

Absorption 
  Bioavailability 
Trial 1100.1484: 
A single dose, 2-part, open-label, randomised, pharmacoscintigraphic investigation into the absorption 
of nevirapine when released into different parts of the gastro-intestinal tract 
Objective:  
To determine the absorption of nevirapine from different regions of the gastro-intestinal tract 
Method: 
The study compared the bioavailability of nevirapine when delivered to the following regions of the 
gastrointestinal tract: ascending colon, descending colon, ileum and jejunum. A comparator arm was 
included, in which a solution was given orally. The test product, 50 mg of nevirapine (suspended in 1 
ml of pH 2 0.1M phosphate buffer), was delivered to different regions of the gastrointestinal tract by 
EnterionTM capsule. Movement of the EnterionTM capsule through the gut was assessed by 
incorporating an 111In (1MBq) marker in the radioactive tracer port of the capsule; this marker 
remained in the device throughout gastrointestinal transit. In order to provide an outline of the 
anatomy of the gastrointestinal tract 30mL of water administered with the capsule contained 4 MBq of 
radiolabelled marker (99mTc-DTPA).The different treatments are:

For quantitation of drug plasma concentrations, blood was collected at the following time points: pre-
dose, 5, 15 and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-
dose/activation. 
Results: 
The mean gastric emptying time of capsules ranged from 0.88-3.35 h. The small intestinal and colon 
transit time ranged from 4.08-7.76 h and 17.6-21.2 h, respectively, and capsule recovery time ranged 
from 27.6-34.4 h. The relative bioavailability ratio of nevirapine in the jejunum was 1.06 (90% CI 
1.00-1.12) compared to suspension dosing. In ileum, ascending, and descending colon, bioavailability 
decreased to 0.89 (0.80-0.99), 0.82 (0.71-0.95), and 0.58 (0.22-1.53), respectively. The absorption 
rate decreased (see Figure and table below) by about 10-fold from jejunum (3.83 h-1) to descending 
colon (0.338 h-1) and tmax increased from 2.42 h (jejunum) to 16.3 h (descending colon). 
Problems occurred for capsule activations at the different locations. This resulted in a number of 
protocol deviations as well as an exposure to drug during treatment periods smaller or larger than 
initially planned.  
It is clearly stated in the report that this study was a qualitative study to investigate the regional 
absorption of nevirapine. The results of the study indicate that nevirapine is absorbed from all sites in 
the gastrointestinal tract that were studied, i.e. jejunum, ileum, ascending colon and descending colon 
(see table below). Relative bioavailability decreased in the order oral administration of a suspension by 
mouth>administration in the jejunum> administration in the ileum>administration in the ascending 
colon>administration in the descending colon. The rate of nevirapine absorption decreases from the 
jejunum to the descending colon.

Conclusion: 
This study confirms that nevirapine was absorbed throughout the intestinal tract. Absorption of 82% 
was observed from the ascending colon, and these results seem to support the development of a 
prolonged release formulation of nevirapine. 
Trial 1100.1485: 
Relative bioavailability of different nevirapine prolonged release formulations compared to 200 mg of 
nevirapine oral tablet following oral administration in healthy male volunteers; an open-label, not 
randomized, parallel group study.

Objective: 
To determine the relative bioavailability of different oral nevirapine extended release (XR) formulations 
compared to nevirapine immediate release (IR) tablet as well as to establish a level A in vitro/in vivo 
correlation (study u07-3362) 
Method: 
The pharmacokinetics of extended release formulations were assessed in a parallel group study with 17 
healthy volunteers per dose group and compared with corresponding in vitro dissolution data obtained 
using a USP apparatus Type 1. In vitro samples were analyzed using HPLC with UV detection and in

Bioavailabilities of nevirapine administered as single 300 mg and 400 mg dose extended release 
formulations were lower compared to a single dose of 2x200 mg nevirapine IR. These lower 
bioavailabilities were characterized by lower total plasma exposures, lower peak plasma nevirapine 
concentrations, and lower plasma nevirapine concentrations at 24 hours post-dose (see Figure below).

Conclusion: 
The nevirapine prolonged release formulations showed a lower bioavailability after single dose 
administration compared to nevirapine IR 2x200 mg. Relative bioavailability, assessed by geometric 
mean test/reference ratios ranged between 62.1 and 87.1% for dose-normalized AUC0-∞, between 
51.4 and 75.5% for dose normalized Cmax and between 62.6 and 92.8% for dose-normalized 
concentrations at 24 hours in relation to nevirapine IR 2x200 mg. A Level A in vitro/in vivo correlation 
was developed and validated for nevirapine extended release formulations providing robust predictions

bioavailability of the nevirapine 100 mg XR tablet compared to 200 mg nevirapine IR tablet as well as 
to the 400 mg nevirapine extended release tablet. 
Method: 
The study was performed as an open-label, non-randomised, single-dose, parallel-group trial. Each 
subject was treated only once. The treatments (n = 24 male subjects each) were 200 mg and 300 mg 
nevirapine extended release doses, given as 2 x 100 mg tablets or 3 x 100 mg tablets in the fasting 
state for test formulations, and one 400 mg nevirapine extended release tablet or one 200 mg 
nevirapine IR tablet in the fasting state for reference formulations. Blood was taken from a forearm 
vein at the following time points: before treatment, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 
24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 144 hours after administration. Groups and treatments were as follows:

Results: 
The paediatric 100 mg nevirapine prolonged release tablet strength administered either as two tablets 
(200 mg) or three tablets (300 mg) displayed prolonged absorption (median tmax ~24 h) compared to 
the nevirapine IR profile (median tmax 2 h). The absorption was more rapid for the 100 mg extended 
release tablet strength compared to the 400 mg prolonged release tablet strength (see Figure below).

Conclusions 
In summary, the paediatric 100 mg XR tablet strength administered either as 2 tablets or 3 tablets 
showed very slow absorption (median tmax ~24 h) compared to the IR profile (median tmax 2 h). The 
absorption is slightly faster for the 100 mg XR tablet strength compared to the 400 mg XR tablet 
strength. No dose dumping was observed from the individual profiles and interindividual variability is 
similar to the IR tablet. Drug exposure (AUC0-∞ and Cmax) appear to be linear between the XR dose 
groups. Based on the dose normalized AUC0-∞, the relative bioavailability of the 100 mg XR tablet 
strength was 83% (2x100 mg XR) and 98.5% (3x100 mg XR) compared to IR tablet (1x200 mg), and 
was 95.1% (2x100 mg XR) and 112.9% (3x100 mg XR) compared to the 400 XR tablet strength.

Method: 
The study was performed as an open-label, randomised, single-dose, parallel-group trial. Each subject 
was treated only once. The test treatment was 4 x 50 mg nevirapine prolonged release tablets while 
the reference treatment was 2 x 100 mg nevirapine prolonged release tablets. Both treatments were 
taken in the fasted state. 
The inclusion criteria consisted of healthy males of 21 to 50 years of age. For quantitation of plasma 
nevirapine concentrations, blood was drawn before treatment and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 
14, 16, 20, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 144 h after dosing. 
Results: 
The plasma concentration-time profiles of nevirapine were similar in shape after single doses of 4 x 50 
mg and 2 x 100 mg nevirapine extended release tablets. Absorption rates from both tablets were slow 
compared to historical nevirapine IR tablets, but the extent of absorption following the administration 
of the 50 mg tablet was 6 - 11% greater than that of the 100 mg tablet. 
Elimination of nevirapine was monophasic after single doses of both 4 x 50 mg and 2 x 100 mg 
nevirapine extended release tablets and no treatment differences in the elimination phase were 
observed (Figure 2.4: 1). No dose dumping was observed in individual profiles, suggesting that the 
rate of absorption of nevirapine was consistent. Geometric mean plasma concentration-time profiles of 
nevirapine for both treatments are shown in Figure below.

Conclusion: 
As with the paediatric 100 mg nevirapine prolonged release tablet strength (administered as two 
tablets) single dose plasma nevirapine concentration-time profiles, the smaller paediatric 50 mg 
nevirapine prolonged release tablet strength administered as four tablets showed prolonged absorption 
(median tmax ~18 h) compared to historical nevirapine IR profiles (median tmax ~2 h). The 50 mg 
nevirapine prolonged release strength (a round 7 mm tablet) is the same common formulation blend 
(Methocel Type 2208, 4000 cPs, KCR 25%) as the 100 mg nevirapine prolonged release tablet (a round 
9 mm tablet). Dividing the 200 mg total dose into four 50 mg units rather than two 100 mg units 
produced a greater overall absorption, but with comparable drug release rates. Although criteria for 
bioequivalence was not fulfilled, the higher exposure observed with the 4x50 mg nevirapine XR tablets 
compensates for the lower bioavailability observed with the 2x100 mg nevirapine XR tablets compared 
with 200 mg nevirapine IR (see parallel group trial 1100.1517).  
The applicant summarises the results from these two trials (1100.1531 & 1100.1517) as follows:

not considered clinically relevant, and the 50 mg nevirapine XR tablet can be used as an alternative in 
children not able to swallow the slightly larger 100 mg nevirapine XR tablet.

Steady state relative bioavailability and food effect of two different nevirapine prolonged release 
prototype formulations compared to steady state 400 mg of Viramune (200 mg BID), in HIV-1 infected 
subjects, an open label, non randomised, multidose and multistage parallel group study  
Objective: 
To establish the steady state pharmacokinetic profiles and relative bioavailability of 2 different 
nevirapine XR formulations (KCR 20 and 25%), in two dose strengths (300 and 400 mg), under fasting 
and fed conditions, in comparison to nevirapine IR  
Method: 
This was an international, open label, multistage, parallel group, crossover study. HIV-1 infected 
patients treated for >12 weeks with nevirapine IR (Viramune) 200 mg BID without protease inhibitors. 
After obtaining intensive PK plasma samples for nevirapine IR over a 24 hour period on study Day 3, 
patients were switched to two different formulations of nevirapine XR 400 mg QD (Group A: KCR 25%, 
Group B: KCR 20%) or 300 mg QD (Group C: KCR 25%, Group D: KCR 20%) on Day 4 for 19 days to 
evaluate relative bioavailability compared to nevirapine IR. Intensive PK plasma samples for XR 
administrations were collected over a 24 h period on study Day 18 without food and on Day 22 with 
food. Background ARV medication was maintained throughout the study. 
Trough plasma samples were also collected for several days preceding the intensive PK sampling days. 
Plasma nevirapine concentrations were determined by a validated HPLC-MS/MS assay with a lower 
limit of quantitation of 25 ng/mL; while plasma concentrations of 5 metabolites were determined by a 
separate validated HPLC-MS/MS assay method.

Results

Mean (SD) nevirapine plasma concentration-time profiles after administration of nevirapine 
XR KCR 25% 400 mg QD in fasted and fed state versus nevirapine IR 200 mg BID in fasted 
state 
For all nevirapine XR formulations (300 mg and 400 mg QD), slightly lower mean exposures (Cmax,ss, 
AUC0-24,ss) were observed compared to the nevirapine IR 200 mg BID formulation. Mean (SD) 
plasma concentration-time profiles of nevirapine at steady-state after repeated once-daily oral 
administration of the KCR 25% nevirapine XR 400 mg formulation given with and without food 
compared with those of nevirapine IR 400 mg/day are shown in Figure above. As expected, nevirapine 
IR exhibited two peak/trough cycles over the 24-hour period, with the morning profile slightly higher 
than the evening profile. 
Mean plasma concentrations of nevirapine moderately increased when the XR formulations were 
administered with a high fat breakfast compared to administration in the fasted state, which was 
consistent for all four prototypes. The plasma concentration-time profile for the finally selected 
nevirapine XR KCR 25% formulation in the fed state was slightly higher than in the fasted state, but 
still below the IR’s two peak/trough cycles for most of the time points over the 24-hour period (Figure 
above). No dose dumping was observed for any of the nevirapine XR individual profiles with and 
without food co-administration. 
Plasma nevirapine concentrations increased with dose from 300 mg to 400 mg for both prototype 
nevirapine XR formulations. Nevirapine pharmacokinetics parameters for all treatment groups are 
listed in Tables below.

The mean plasma concentration ratios of three nevirapine metabolites appeared similar after oral

food did not show any effects on nevirapine metabolite ratios compared with administration of the drug 
product in the fasted state (see Table below). Note that only three metabolites are summarized since 
2-hydroxynevirapine and 8-hydroxynevirapine plasma concentrations were below limit of quantitation 
for both nevirapine XR and nevirapine IR.

Conclusions 
Administration of nevirapine from both XR formulations 400 mg QD resulted in extended absorption 
and moderate reductions in peak levels at steady state with minimal reductions in Cmin,ss values 
compared to nevirapine IR 200 mg BID. When nevirapine XR formulations were administered with 
food, the relative bioavailability of nevirapine tended to be slightly higher than in the fasted state, 
close to exposures observed with the nevirapine IR formulation. However, the extent of the increase 
was not clinically relevant and was not sufficient to warrant a recommendation with regard to food 
intake. Based on these results, the KCR 25% 400 mg formulation exhibited better relative 
bioavailability and less variability than the KCR 20% formulation and was selected as the final XR 
tablet formulation for the Phase III studies. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
  Dose proportionality 
Dose proportionality was demonstrated on the basis of trial 1100-1517 discussed under 
Bioequivalence. 
The 100 mg paediatric nevirapine XR tablets are round, approximately 9 mm diameter, to facilitate 
dosing requirements in children who are able to reliably swallow such tablets. These tablets were 
based on the same formulation blend (KCR 25%) as the 400 mg adult nevirapine XR tablet with oval, 
biconvex dimensions of 9.3 x 19.1 mm. Therefore, because bioavailability is comparable to the 400 mg 
strength, the in vitro dissolution for the 100 mg paediatric nevirapine XR tablet strength correlates 
with the in vivo performance in a manner consistent with the 400 mg adult nevirapine XR tablet.  
The 50 mg nevirapine prolonged release strength (a round 7 mm tablet) is also the same common 
formulation blend (Methocel Type 2208, 4000 cPs, KCR 25%) as the 100 mg nevirapine extended 
release tablet (a round 9 mm tablet) and the 400 mg nevirapine extended release tablet (oval, 
dimensions of 9.3 x 19.1 mm). The smaller 50 mg tablet unit produced a 7 - 11% greater overall dose-
normalized exposure compared with the 100 mg tablet units, but with a comparable drug release rate. 
The in vivo drug release rates were consistent with the in vitro drug release dissolution profiles (Figure 
below). 
Figure 10:

1100.1485, 1517, and 1531 
Assessment report  
EMA/838269/2011  
Page 29/84
 
 
 
 
  Time dependency 
Single dose bioavailability studies were conducted in healthy male volunteers. Nevirapine terminal 
elimination half life in plasma following a single dose administration was approximately 40 to 45 h. The 
half life did not differ between nevirapine XR and nevirapine IR formulations. 
Nevirapine is an enzyme inducer and can induce its own CYP3A and CYP2B6 mediated metabolism, 
which leads to an approximately 1.5- to 2-fold increase in the apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of 
nevirapine as treatment continues from the first dose to steady state. Auto-induction also results in a 
corresponding decrease in the terminal half life of nevirapine in plasma to approximately 25-30 hours 
following multiple dosing with 200-400 mg/day. In the multiple dose study with intensive PK sampling 
(1100.1489) in HIV-1 patients, half life was not obtainable because no washout period could be 
included. Other available steady state PK parameters from this study compared with their 
corresponding single dose PK parameters (for the same XR KCR 25% formulation) obtained in the 
bioavailability study (1100.1485) are summarized in Table below. 
Table 20: 
Across study comparisons between single dose (SD) and multiple dose (MD) 
pharmacokinetic parameters (gMean) of nevirapine IR and nevirapine XR 
(KCR 25%) tablets 
Since steady state half-life is still relatively long (25-30 h), accumulation of plasma concentrations 
would be expected for nevirapine independent of formulation as shown in Table above. Accumulation 
ratios for pharmacokinetic parameters over a constant dosing interval were estimated as 
Cmax,ss/Cmax,1, Cmin,ss/Cmin,1 and AUCτ,ss/AUC0-24,1, where 1 denotes the single (or first) dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/838269/2011  
Page 30/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is an approximately 2-fold accumulation for Cmax and Cmin, and approximately 3-fold 
accumulation in AUC at steady state for both nevirapine XR and IR tablets. 
The combination of nevirapine’s relatively long steady state half life and the BID dosing of the IR tablet 
results in a small peak-to-trough ratio of 1.9. Development of the nevirapine XR once-daily formulation 
results in a further reduction of the peak-to-trough ratio to 1.5, attaining more stable plasma 
concentrations despite the larger dosing interval (24 h instead of 12 h). 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
From studies presented in the bioavailability/bioequivalence sections, the overall variability of the 400 
mg prolonged release nevirapine dosage formulations were 20–47% for rate and extent of absorption 
indicating that some absorption occurs in the colonic regions of the gastrointestinal tract despite the 
presence of a high pH environment. Additionally, the relative systemic bioavailability is lower for the 
prolonged release formulations compared to the commercial tablet standard. For the 400 mg prolonged 
release nevirapine tablet intended for marketing (KCR 25%), the variability was 29% (AUC) to 37% 
(C24) with a relative bioavailability of approximately 70%.

Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Study 1100.1486: 
A randomised, double blind, double dummy, parallel group, active controlled trial to evaluate the 
antiviral efficacy of 400 mg QD nevirapine Extended Release formulation in comparison to 200 mg BID 
nevirapine immediate release in combination with Truvada®, including a PK Sub-study at week 4. 
Objective: 
Secondary objectives were to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics of nevirapine XR compared to 
nevirapine IR. 
Methods: 
A pharmacokinetic sub-study was also included in a total of 49 patients who had intensive PK blood 
sample collection over 24 hours at Week 4 (Day 28), i.e. 2 weeks after randomization. Plasma 
nevirapine concentrations were determined by a validated HPLC-MS/MS assay with a lower limit of

quantitation of 25 ng/mL. PK results were compared by treatment, and summarised by gender, race 
and study region, and baseline viral load stratum. 
PK Results: 
From the PK sub-study at Week 4, the relative bioavailability of nevirapine XR based on the geometric 
mean ratio (Table below) was 76.7% for AUC0-24,ss, 82.7% for Cmin,ss, and 68.9% for Cmax,ss. A 
lower Cmax,ss is expected and desirable for nevirapine XR by formulation design.

In patients with intensive PK sampling, mean ( SD) steady state plasma concentrations of nevirapine 
after oral administration of nevirapine XR 400 mg QD (N=24) demonstrated extended release 
characteristics with less fluctuation (i. e., lower peak-trough ratio) than those observed in patients on 
nevirapine IR 200 mg BID (N=25) as shown in Figure below. The peak-to-trough fluctuation was 
34.6% for nevirapine XR and 55.2% for nevirapine IR.

Conclusions: 
In 1100.1486, plasma concentrations of nevirapine XR 400 mg QD further demonstrated extended 
release characteristics of the nevirapine XR tablet formulation with less peak- to-trough fluctuation, 
and were generally lower than those of the nevirapine IR 200 mg BID. 
Nevirapine XR to IR trough geometric mean ratio was 81.7% for the geometric mean of Weeks 4 to 48, 
and 76.9% for Week 48. The 10th percentile trough concentrations for nevirapine XR from Week 4 to 
Week 48 were all above 1,800 ng/mL, which is at least 13-fold higher than the IC90 for wild type HIV-
1 virus. The nevirapine XR group showed non-inferior efficacy compared to the nevirapine IR group 
with a trend toward superiority, indicative of nevirapine XR delivering adequate nevirapine exposure. 
The relative trough exposure of nevirapine XR (compared to IR) was consistent among gender, race, 
region and baseline viral load stratum. 
Study 1100.1518: 
Title: An open-label, multiple dose, cross-over study to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetic 
parameters of nevirapine extended release tablets in HIV-1 infected children, with an optional 
extension phase 
Objective: 
To establish the pharmacokinetic parameters at steady-state of once-daily nevirapine prolonged 
release in children aged 3 to <18 years under fasting conditions  
Methods: 
This was an open label, multiple dose, non-randomised, cross-over study. HIV-1 infected patients 
treated for at least 18 weeks with nevirapine IR based regimen without protease inhibitors, and viral 
load <50 copies/mL. Patients were stratified into 3 age groups: ≥3 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 
12 to <18 years of age. Approximately 75 patients were to enter the study with 25 patients per each 
age group. All patients had trough plasma and saliva sampling to determine nevirapine concentrations. 
For the PK sub-study, at least the first 12 patients entered into the 3 to <6 years old age group and 
the first 10 patients entered into each of the two remaining age groups were assigned to perform post-
dose plasma and saliva PK sampling to determine a full nevirapine profile at steady state. Following 
screening at baseline, qualified children and adolescents were stratified according to age and received 
nevirapine IR for at least 10 days (run-in phase) prior to the collection of a 12-hour nevirapine 
concentration-time profile on study Day 11 for PK analysis. On Day 12 nevirapine IR treatment was 
switched to nevirapine XR. All patients received nevirapine XR for 9 days prior to the collection of a 24-
hour nevirapine concentration-time profile on study Days 21 and 22 for pharmacokinetic analysis. 
Plasma and saliva nevirapine concentrations were determined by a validated HPLC-MS/MS assay at 
with a lower limit of quantitation of 50 ng/mL. Full details of the assay can be found in the study 
report. 
Results: 
Geometric mean nevirapine plasma concentration-time profiles after oral administration of nevirapine 
XR QD and IR BID in paediatric patients aged 3 to <18 years are depicted in Figure below. The 
nevirapine XR QD profile appears to be more constant than the IR BID profile, suggesting nevirapine 
was slowly released and absorbed from XR tablets.

In conclusion, the results of this study support the XR once daily dosing and demonstrate that the 100 
mg nevirapine XR dose increment is appropriate and provides adequate dose adjustment for paediatric 
patients switching from twice daily nevirapine IR to once daily XR dosage forms. The target Cmin was 
achieved with the nevirapine XR formulation. Further, in children taking the XR formulation, the 
nevirapine exposure is similar to that observed in adult treatment-naive patients in the 48-week study 
(Study 1100.1486) as well as to that observed in patients switching from a nevirapine IR BID 
treatment in the 24-weeks study (Study 1100.1526). The efficacy results from these two studies 
demonstrate that this level of exposure is sufficient to ensure long term efficacy. Therefore, the data 
suggest that the XR formulation can also be used in paediatric populations. 
Study 1100.1526: 
An open label, phase IIIb, randomized parallel group study to assess the efficacy and safety of 
switching HIV-1 infected patients successfully treated with a nevirapine IR based regimen to nevirapine 
XR 400 mg QD or remaining on nevirapine IR 200 mg BID based regimen  
Objective: 
To assess the efficacy and safety of switching HIV-1 infected patients from a nevirapine IR based 
regimen to a nevirapine XR based regimen. 
Method: 
Open label, randomised, parallel group study. After successful screening, patients on a nevirapine IR-
based HAART therapy were randomised with a 2:1 allocation ratio to either nevirapine XR 400 mg QD 
or nevirapine IR 200 mg BID. Patients remained on their previous background therapy. 
Trough plasma samples were obtained at each visit and PK results until Week 24 (primary efficacy 
endpoint) are reported. Plasma nevirapine concentrations were determined by a validated HPLC-
MS/MS assay with a lower limit of quantitation of 25 ng/mL Results were compared by treatment 
group, and summarized by gender, race, study region and background ARV therapy.

PK Results: 
The mean trough concentrations were above 3,000 ng/ml and appeared to be relatively stable over the 
24 week period for both nevirapine XR and nevirapine IR treatments (see Table below). The adjusted 
geometric mean of nevirapine XR was 3,493 ng/ml for trough concentrations of all weeks, and was 
3,729 ng/mL for Week 24 (2nd table below). The nevirapine XR to IR ratio was 81.7% for the geometric 
mean of all troughs from all weeks was 82.9% for Week 24. The nevirapine XR trough concentrations 
were slightly lower than the nevirapine IR concentrations based on either the geometric mean of 
Weeks 2 to 24.

Conclusion: 
In Study 1100.1526, nevirapine XR 400 mg QD trough concentrations were approximately 90% of 
nevirapine IR 200 mg BID. The nevirapine XR group showed non-inferiority to nevirapine IR group, 
indicative of nevirapine XR delivering adequate trough drug exposure. Pharmacokinetic as well as 
efficacy results support the switch from nevirapine IR twice-daily to nevirapine XR once-daily

Special populations 
  Gender and Race 
The plasma nevirapine trough concentrations from Phase III Study 1100.1486 were stratified by 
demographics at different weeks during the study. Compared to nevirapine IR, the XR drug product 
demonstrated consistent in vivo performance. Relative trough nevirapine concentrations in patients 
with different demographic backgrounds are summarized in Table below. The relative trough ratios of 
nevirapine XR to IR are mostly around 80% from Week 4 through Week 48 for Study 1100.1486. The 
XR/IR trough concentration ratios by demographics are found to be also consistent, albeit slightly 
higher (around 90%), for Study 1100.1526 
Table 30: 
Nevirapine XR/IR geometric mean ratios (%) of trough plasma 
concentrations in HIV-1 patients with different demographic background and 
baseline viral load stratum in Study 1100.1486 
The demographic differences in nevirapine drug exposure are summarized in Table below, in which the 
geometric mean of trough concentrations between different demographic groups are compared (both 
for nevirapine XR and IR) by means of a ratio. Both nevirapine IR and XR show the same trend in 
demographic difference when two specific demographic groups are compared. Black patients tend to 
have higher nevirapine trough concentrations (approximately 30%) than white patients, whereas 
female patients appear to have higher concentrations (approximately 20-30%) than male patients in 
both XR and IR treatment groups. Also, Latin American patients appeared to have higher nevirapine 
trough concentrations than either European or North American-Australian patients in both XR and IR 
treatment groups. No apparent differences were observed between European and North American-
Australian patients or patients with different baseline viral load stratum.

No apparent relationship was found between nevirapine trough concentrations and age or body weight 
in both XR and IR treatment groups in adult patients from Studies 1100-1486 and 1526 
  Elderly 
No apparent relationship was found between nevirapine trough concentrations and age or body weight 
in both XR and IR treatment groups in adult patients from Studies 1100-1486 and 1526 
  Children 
In study 1100.1518 it is noted that children taking the XR formulation, the nevirapine exposure is 
similar to that observed in adult treatment-naïve patients in the 48-week study (Study 1100.1486) as 
well as to that observed in patients switching from a nevirapine IR BID treatment in the weeks study 
(study 1100.1526). The efficacy results from these studies show that this level of exposure is sufficient 
to ensure long term efficacy. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
As this submission concerns an extension of marketing authorisation for a product with known 
mechanism of action and pharmacology for its active compound, no new pharmacodynamic data has 
been provided. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant determined the extent and rate of absorption from different regions of the gastro-
intestinal tract. Only the descending colon showed a low value for relative bioavailability as compared 
to an oral suspension, all the other (jejunum, ileum and ascending colon) showing a comparable 
degree of absorption (1.06 to 0.82). 
By comparing the bioavailability with respect to the IR 200 mg form for 4 different XR formulations in 2 
strengths (300 mg and 400 mg) yielding fast, medium and slow release rates, the applicant selected 
the KCR 20% and KCR 25% formulations for further development. The data obtained were used to 
Assessment report

develop a level A in vitro/in vivo correlation (IVIVC), which was validated and used to establish 
dissolution specifications, on the basis of the prediction of AUC and Cmax. The validity of the in vivo 
drug release and in vitro drug release correlation (IVIVC) was confirmed. 
Two other strengths for paediatric use (50 mg and 100 mg) were developed using the same 
formulation blend and shown to yield comparable bioavailability in 2 Phase I studies, but not strict 
bioequivalence, the 50 mg tablet being 6-11% greater in exposure than that of the 100 mg tablet. 
Results from PK sub-studies included in 3 Phase III clinical efficacy and safety studies suggest that 
these differences have no impact on the performance of these formulations. 
No dose dumping was observed from the individual profiles and inter-individual variability was similar 
to the IR tablet. 
Food effect was studied by establishing the steady state pharmacokinetic profiles and relative 
bioavailability of 2 different nevirapine XR formulations (KCR 20 and 25%), in two dose strengths (300 
and 400 mg), under fasting and fed conditions, in comparison to nevirapine IR. The KCR 25%, 400 mg 
formulation was selected for clinical development sowing extended release characteristics.  Exposure 
and rate of absorption were ca. 20% higher in fed state and Cmin,ss was ca. 10% higher. On the other 
hand this formulation in fed state is strictly bioequivalent to the IR formulation in fasted state.  The 
applicant justified the use of a steady-state study because it is not ethical to give more than one dose 
to healthy volunteers (due to tolerability reasons) or to perform a cross-over study with a wash-out 
period in HIV infected patients (risk of generating resistance). Therefore, steady-state conditions are 
more relevant to test the food effect. Furthermore, during these steady-state studies, no clinical 
relevant food effect has been noted after administration of a high-fat meal. Thus it was concluded that 
the SmPC should not be amended.  
Dose proportionality has been established for the 100 mg tablet but not for the 50 mg one. However, 
the applicant provided further reassurance regarding dose proportionality between the 100 mg and the 
400 mg strength by providing sound reasons for excluding subject # 4. Furthermore, the 100 mg 
tablet intended for paediatric use is dose proportional to the 400 mg tablet and both the 100 mg and 
50 mg strengths are made from the common formulation blend. It is stated that the in vivo drug 
release rates were consistent with the in vitro drug release dissolution profiles for the 50 mg and 100 
mg strengths. Since the applicant states that: “From a pharmacokinetic perspective the nevirapine 50 
and 100 mg XR tablets are clinically interchangeable and can be used once-daily in place of nevirapine 
IR twice daily tablets or suspension on a paediatric daily dose basis”, still some doubts persist on the 
extrapolation of the investigated properties of the 400 mg strength, in particular the IVIVC and 
dissolution specifications, to the 100 mg and 50 mg strengths, because they are not strictly 
bioequivalent and dose proportionality was not investigated for the 50 mg strength. The applicant 
however argued that it has been demonstrated similar relative bioavailability between the 50mg and 
the 100mg XR tablets and claims interchangeability between the two tablets for paediatric use only. 
This is acceptable, as long as the IVIVC established for the 400mg tablet is not extended to the 50mg 
and 100mg tablets.  Waiving the requirement for future BE-studies in case of major formulation 
changes for the 400 mg strength on the basis of the established IVIVC is not granted. 
A summary of available data for overall and intra-subject variability is compiled in the table below. 
These values are similar or somewhat lower than the values observed for nevirapine 200 mg IR.

Nevirapine terminal elimination half-life in plasma following a single dose administration was 
approximately 40 to 45 h. The half-life did not differ between nevirapine XR and nevirapine IR 
formulations. 
The combination of nevirapine relatively long steady state half life and the BID dosing of the IR tablet 
results in a small peak-to-trough ratio of 1.9. Development of the nevirapine prolonged release once-
daily formulation results in a further reduction of the peak-to-trough ratio to 1.5, attaining more stable 
plasma concentrations despite the larger dosing interval (24 h instead of 12 h). 
Nevirapine is an enzyme inducer and can induce its own CYP3A and CYP2B6 mediated metabolism, 
which leads to an approximately 1.5- to 2-fold increase in the apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of 
nevirapine as treatment continues from the first dose to steady state. Auto-induction also results in a 
corresponding decrease in the terminal half life of nevirapine in plasma to approximately 25-30 hours 
following multiple dosing with 200-400 mg/day.  
In spite of auto-induction of CYP3A and 2B6, the reduction in half-life (from 40-45 h to 25-30 h), there 
is no impact on the slow release characteristics of nevirapine XR and the accumulation is therefore 
independent of formulation. 
Three Phase III studies included PK intensive sub-studies in adult (1100.1486 and 1526) and 
paediatric populations (1100.1518).  
Nevirapine prolonged release tablets show release characteristics with a lower (81.7%) trough 
concentration as compared to the IR formulation, still well above IC90 for wild type HIV 1 virus in 
study 1100-1486. From studies 1100.1518 and 1100.1526, both the paediatric 100 mg XR and the 
adult 400 mg XR formulations showed similar performance when compared to the IR formulation. The 
following issues have been further addressed by the applicant during the procedure (detailed 
discussion not provided in this assessment report):  
(1) In order to support the statement that trough concentration is still well above IC90 for wild type 
HIV 1 virus, the MAH clarified how the threshold for Ctrough of the XR formulation was established.  
It is stated that it is 13-fold higher than IC90 for wild-type HIV. The MAH clarified that this holds true 
also for (laboratory) virus strains with any resistance mutations by arguing that all the major 
nevirapine resistance mutations, such as Y181C or K103N, result in large shifts in susceptibility, and so 
marginal differences in trough concentrations will not result in meaningfully different barriers to 
resistance and that, since the once daily dosing is more convenient, adherence may be improved, and 
with improvement in adherence we would expect less emergence of resistance and improvement in 
antiviral efficacy of the XR formulation. 
(2) the percentage of patients not achieving the PK target has been provided by the MAH, reassuring 
that this percentage was below clinical significance; and  
Assessment report  
EMA/838269/2011  
Page 41/84
 
 
 
 
 
(3) the applicant discussed the fact that no trough effect was found on the proportion of virologic 
responders by arguing that, as nevirapine binds directly to reverse transcriptase and blocks the RNA-
dependant and DNA-dependant polymerase activities, as nNRTIs are active without transformation and 
their plasma concentration reflects the intracellular concentration of the drug, nevirapine plasma 
trough concentrations from 1.0 μg/ml (10 fold>IC90 of nevirapine for wild type virus) and above are 
comparable to nevirapine intracellular concentrations and therefore explain why no trough effect can 
be found for virologic responders. 
Only race, gender, age and body weight have been analysed for nevirapine XR in comparison with data 
from the IR formulation. The findings point to the conclusion that both nevirapine IR and XR show the 
same trend in demographic difference when two specific demographic groups are compared. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics of the final nevirapine XR formulation administered as 400 mg QD in HIV-1 patients 
demonstrated consistent prolonged release characteristics with less fluctuation in the 24 hour PK 
profile than observed with the nevirapine IR 200 mg product. Nevirapine XR delivers nevirapine slowly 
in a controlled manner, resulting in extending the absorption to the entire intestinal tract (including the 
colon) without affecting the pharmacokinetic variability. No dose dumping was observed for nevirapine 
XR, neither following single dose nor during multiple administrations.  
Food co-administration with nevirapine prolonged release tablets resulted in a slight increase of 
bioavailability by approximately 20% for AUC0-24,ss and Cmax,ss without any evidence of dose 
dumping or increase in variability. The extent of the increase due to a high fat meal was considered 
not clinically relevant and the nevirapine XR drug product can be taken without any food restrictions. 
Drug metabolism of nevirapine was found to be unchanged independent of the type of formulation 
administered. 
Nevirapine XR drug product has slightly lower relative bioavailability (around 80% of AUC) compared 
to the nevirapine IR tablet. However, nevirapine prolonged release tablets perform consistently well 
during multiple dosing in HIV-1 patients along with background antiretroviral therapy with adequate 
drug exposure, meeting the target steady state exposure (trough concentration and Cmin,ss) expected 
to provide good viral suppression. 
The relative bioavailability of nevirapine XR drug product was also consistent among HIV-1 patients 
with different demographics or background ARV therapy. Overall, the once-a-day nevirapine XR drug 
product resulted in adequate and more uniform plasma concentrations compared to the twice-a-day 
nevirapine IR product, and is expected to improve convenience and facilitate treatment adherence. 
In paediatric HIV-1 patients aged 3 to <18 years the nevirapine prolonged release drug products 
performed equally well, achieving similar or slightly higher exposure levels in children as previously 
established in adult patients. Pharmacokinetic results support the once daily dosing of nevirapine XR in 
paediatric patients.  
The steady state trough concentration (Cpre,ss) of the drug in plasma is considered the most 
important pharmacokinetic parameter for achieving and maintaining HIV-1 virus suppression with an 
NNRTI based regimen. Previous studies with nevirapine showed that maintenance of Cpre,ss above a 
lowest limit of 1,000 ng/mL should result in no loss of efficacy. The main phase III trial, which 
evaluated safety, efficacy and PK of nevirapine IR versus nevirapine XR in HIV-1 infected adult patients 
(Study 1100.1486) showed that nevirapine XR trough (Cpre,ss) concentrations over the 48 week 
period were stable (gMean across the weeks was 3,354 ng/mL). In the paediatric study, study 
1100.1518, the overall steady state nevirapine gMean Cpre,ss was 4,160 ng/mL (n=78). The gMean 
Assessment report

Page 42/84
 
 
 
Cpre,ss for XR analyzed either by age group or dose group was well above the target concentration of 
above 3,000 ng/ml. 
Level A IVIVIC has been established on the basis of a parallel study. This has been justified and the 
internal and external validation provided prediction errors of < 10%. This can be used to establish 
dissolution testing specifications. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1.  Dose response studies and main clinical studies 
The clinical efficacy for the nevirapine prolonged release (XR) programme is established based on two 
Phase III controlled studies conducted in adult patients with human immunodeficiency virus, Type 1 
(HIV-1) infection: Studies 1100.1486 “VERxVE” [U10-3212-01] and 1100.1526 “TRANxITION” [U10-
3028-01]. The formulation and dose for these Phase III studies were based on a multiple-dose Phase 
Ib study, Study 1100.1489 [U08-2197-01], which evaluated 2 formulations in 2 dose strengths. 
Additionally, a Phase I clinical trial was conducted in HIV-1 infected children ages 3 to <18 years who 
were already on a nevirapine based antiretroviral regimen, in which the pharmacokinetic parameters of 
nevirapine XR were evaluated and short term efficacy was observed; Study 1100.1518 [U10-3350-01]. 
Study 1100.1486: A randomised, double blind, double dummy, parallel group, active 
controlled trial to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of 400 mg QD neVirapine Extended Release 
formulation in comparison to 200 mgBID neVirapinE immediate release in combination with 
Truvada in antiretroviral therapy naïve HIV-1 infected patients (VERXVE) 
Study 1100.1486 is a randomised, double blind non-inferiority study assessing the efficacy and safety 
of nevirapine XR tablets administered once daily (QD) versus nevirapine immediate release (IR) tablets 
administered twice daily (BID), on a fixed background antiretroviral (ARV) regimen of tenofovir (TDF) 
and emtricitabine (FTC) (Truvada®) in treatment-naïve, HIV-1 infected patients [U10-3212-01]. The 
objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of nevirapine XR tablets, 400 mg QD, versus 
nevirapine IR tablets, 200 mg BID, in ARV-naïve HIV-1 infected patients after 48 weeks of treatment. 
The study duration is 48 weeks, with extended treatment up to 144 weeks. 1068 patients entered the 
lead-in phase of the study, and 1013 patients were randomized to one of the two treatments in a 1:1 
ratio. Of these 1013 patients, 1011 were treated with blinded study drugs. 
Methods 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint for Study 1100.1486 is a sustained virologic response at Week 48, using the 
LLOQ of 50 copies/ml HIV-1 RNA for viral load. 
A virologic response is defined as two consecutive measurements of viral load <50 copies/ml, at least 
2 weeks apart. A sustained virologic response had no virologic rebound or change of ARV therapy 
through Week 48. The time window of Week 48 is defined as 48 ± 4 weeks from the day a patient 
started the lead-in treatment (nevirapine IR QD for 2 weeks).  
A virologic rebound is defined as two consecutive measurements of a viral load of ≥50 copies/ml, at 
least 2 weeks apart, following a virologic response. 
Assessment report  
EMA/838269/2011  
Page 43/84
 
 
 
 
Patients, who died, were lost to follow-up, or changed ARV drugs due to toxicity/intolerance that was 
not attributable to the allowed background ARV therapies, were considered treatment failures at the 
time of those events. 
Supplemental SNAPSHOT analyses 
Patients with a viral load < LLOQ in the week window [48 – 4, 48 + 6] were classified as virologic 
responders. 
Virologic outcome at the specified week window was classified into the following categories: 
  Virologic Success (Virologic Responder) 
  Virologic Failure 
  No virologic Data in the Window: 
  Discontinued study due to AE or death, 
  Discontinued study for other reasons, 
  Missing data during window but on study. 
Antiretroviral background therapy substitutions, permitted per protocol for documented toxicity 
reasons, were permitted on or before the first trial visit without penalty. If the ARV background 
therapy substitutions for toxicity reasons occurred after the first trial visit, then patients were 
considered virologic failures if they had a HIV-1 viral load >50 copies/ml at the time of the switch. 
Key secondary endpoint was: time to loss of virologic response (LLOQ=50 copies/ml) - The time to 
loss of virologic response is defined as the time between the start of treatment and the confirmed 
virologic rebound.  
Other secondary endpoints 
Sustained virologic response at Week 48 (LLOQ=400 copies/ml) 
The definition for this endpoint is the same as the primary endpoint, except that the LLOQ of 
400 copies/ml is used.  
Time to loss of virologic response (LLOQ=400 copies/ml) 
The definition for this endpoint is the same as the key secondary endpoint, except that the 
LLOQ of 400 copies/ml is used.  
Sustained virologic response at each visit (LLOQ=50 copies/ml) 
The proportion of patients with a sustained virologic response at each visit for each treatment 
group was calculated using the definitions of a non-responder noted below.  
Definitions of a Non-responder 
For each visit, a subject with the following events prior to or at this visit will be 
considered as a non-responder or failure for that visit if any of the following events

a)  Death 
b)  Permanent discontinuation of the study drug or lost to follow-up 
c)  Introducing a new drug to the regimen

d)  Have not achieved < LLOQ that was confirmed later for achieved confirmed < LLOQ 
status but rebounded (i.e., two consecutive ≥ LLOQ copies/mL [the latter one 
possibly after the visit of interest], or one ≥ LLOQ copies/mL for the last available 
visit) 
Time to confirmed virologic response 
This is defined as the time between the start of lead-in treatment and the first viral load < LLOQ of a 
confirmed virologic response (two consecutive measurements of viral load < LLOQ, at least 2 weeks 
apart) prior to the time when the last patient is on treatment for 48 weeks. Patients without confirmed 
virologic response were considered censored at their last on-treatment visit.  
Time to new AIDS or AIDS-related progression event or death (TAIDS) 
Time to new AIDS or AIDS-related progression event or death is defined as the time from the start of 
treatment to the time when the new AIDS or AIDS-related progression event or death occurred, 
whichever came first. Patients with none of these events were considered censored at their last 
available follow-up visit. 
Change from baseline in CD4+ cell count 
The CD4+ cell counts were analyzed as absolute counts. The baseline for a CD4+ cell count was 
calculated based on the arithmetic mean of the last two measurements (if available) before the start of 
treatment with study drug; this value was used to calculate the change from baseline. 
Treatment-emergent mutations 
To characterize nevirapine resistance, patients failing virologically in Study 1100.1486 were selected 
for genotypic and phenotypic testing. For the purpose of classifying patients from whom on-treatment 
retention samples were selected for genotyping, virologic failure was defined as follows: viral load was 
never suppressed, viral load rebounded, or viral load was partially suppressed.  
Viral samples successfully amplified were genotyped by Monogram Biosciences using their 
commercially available GeneSeq HIV assay. The GeneSeq algorithm for identifying resistance-
associated amino acids and predicting resistance is based on published scientific literature and 
proprietary information from the Monogram Biosciences' phenotype-genotype database. 
Of those patients genotyped, virus samples with amino acid substitutions other than those known to be 
associated with nevirapine resistance were phenotyped. All phenotypic testing was conducted by 
Monogram Biosciences using their commercially available Phenosense Assay. The phenotypic testing 
was performed to determine if previously unrecognized amino acid substitutions that confer reduced 
nevirapine susceptibility and could lead to virologic failure were observed with virologic failures in 
Study 1100.1486. 
Blinding (masking) 
Only study 1100.1486 is double blind.  
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was the test of the non-inferiority of the nevirapine XR formulation to 
nevirapine IR with a non-inferiority margin Δ = -10%. A 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference 
in the proportions of virologic response between nevirapine XR and nevirapine IR treatment groups 
was constructed using Cochran’s statistic, stratified by baseline HIV-1 viral load, and with continuity 
correction for the variance. Non-inferiority of nevirapine XR to nevirapine IR treatment was established 
Assessment report  
EMA/838269/2011  
Page 45/84
 
 
 
if the lower bound of the CI was greater than -10%. Superiority was to be tested if non-inferiority was 
established. For the pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, relative bioavailability was assessed, and the 
minimum and geometric mean (gMean) trough concentrations were calculated for all patients. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 1626 patients were enrolled into the 1100.1486 study. Of the 1068 patients who entered the 
study and were treated with the nevirapine IR 200 mg QD dose in the lead-in phase, 55 patients were 
not randomized. The majority of these 55 patients were not randomized due to AEs (38 patients).  
The following table summarizes the disposition of patients after randomization through Week 48 in 
Study 1100.1486.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
Sustained virologic response at Week 48 (LLOQ = 50 copies/ml) 
As showed in the table below the adjusted difference was 4.9% (95% CI -0.1%, 10.0%), favoring 
nevirapine XR treatment. The lower bound of -0.1% indicated a trend toward superiority of nevirapine 
XR to nevirapine IR treatment.

Secondary analyses of the primary endpoint 
Secondary analyses of the primary endpoint were performed using combinations of different assay 
profiles (TaqMan, Amplicor-corrected), different algorithms to define virologic responders (TLOVR 
algorithm, SNAPSHOT approach), and different analysis data sets (FAS, PPS,) to test the non-inferiority 
of nevirapine XR to nevirapine IR (Table 36).

Supplemental SNAPSHOT analysis of the primary endpoint 
Using the supplemental SNAPSHOT approach and the Amplicor-corrected profile, 75.1% (380/506) and 
80.2% (405/505) of patients in the nevirapine IR and XR groups, respectively, were considered 
virologic responders at Week 48. This finding was consistent with the results from the primary analysis 
of the primary endpoint.  
The virologic failure rates were 13.2% and 10.7% in the nevirapine IR and XR groups, respectively. 
There were 11.7% and 9.1% patients in the nevirapine IR and XR groups, respectively, who had no 
virologic data in the Week 48 window (44-54 weeks). 
Key secondary endpoint 
Time to loss of virologic response 
For the baseline viral load ≤100,000 copies/mL stratum the proportion of patients 
without loss of virologic response using LLOQ = 50 copies/mL was greater for the 
nevirapine XR group than the nevirapine IR group for all time points through Week 72 
using the Amplicor-corrected assay profile. For the baseline viral load >100,000 
copies/mL stratum, the proportions were comparable in the two treatment groups. The 
same pattern was observed when using the TaqMan-only assay profile. 
Other secondary endpoints 
Sustained virologic response at Week 24 (LLOQ = 50 copies/ml) 
The nevirapine XR group tended to have a higher proportion of patients with a 
sustained virologic response (LLOQ=50 copies/mL) at Week 24 compared with the 
nevirapine IR group.  
Sustained virologic response at Week 48 (LLOQ = 400 copies/ml) 
The nevirapine XR group tended to have a higher proportion of patients with a 
sustained virologic response (using LLOQ=400 copies/mL) compared with the 
nevirapine IR group, when analyzed using the TLOVR algorithm. This finding at Week 
48 was independent of the algorithms used to define virologic response and HIV-1 RNA 
assays. The fact that the lower limits of the 95% CIs were greater than -2% confirmed 
the non-inferiority of nevirapine XR to nevirapine IR at Week 48. 
Sustained virologic response by visit 
In the analysis of virologic responders (LLOQ = 50 copies/mL) at each visit using the 
TLOVR algorithm and the Amplicor-corrected assay, the proportion of virologic 
responders increased steeply from Week 0 to Week 24 for both the nevirapine IR and 
XR groups. Starting from Week 24, the proportion of responders in the nevirapine XR 
group kept increasing and peaked at Week 48. A similar pattern was observed for the 
TaqMan only assay. When LLOQ = 400 copies/ml was used for the definition of 
virologic response, the response proportion peaked at Week 16 for both groups (84.6% 
for nevirapine IR and 88.3% for nevirapine XR) then gradually decreased to 78.9% for 
the IR group and 83.2% for the XR group. Overall, the nevirapine XR group tended to 
have a higher response proportion than the IR group from Week 2 to Week 48.  
Time to confirmed virologic response 
Assessment report  
EMA/838269/2011  
Page 49/84
 
 
 
 
Based on the Kaplan-Meier curves, the time it took for a patient to become a virologic 
responder (LLOQ = 50 copies/mL, Amplicor-corrected profile) was comparable for the 
nevirapine IR and XR groups for each baseline HIV-1 viral load stratum. The finding 
was consistent when using the TaqMan-only assay. Adjusted for baseline HIV-1 viral 
load stratum, there was no meaningful difference for time to confirmed virologic 
response between the two treatment groups for the Amplicor-corrected assay profile 
(LLOQ = 50 copies/mL). The finding was consistent when using the TaqMan-only assay 
profile (LLOQ = 50 copies/mL). 
Change from baseline in CD4+ cell count at each visit 
For mean changes in CD4+ cell count from baseline using LOCF values, a steep 
increase in CD4+ cell count from baseline was observed in the first 8 weeks for both 
treatment groups (+107 cells/mm3 for nevirapine IR and +111 cells/mm3 for 
nevirapine XR. At Week 48, the mean increase was +181 cells/mm3 for nevirapine IR 
and +192 cells/mm3 for nevirapine XR. Using the least square mean, the mean 
increase in CD4+ cell count at Week 48 was +184 cells/mm3 for the nevirapine IR 
group and +197 cells/mm3 for the nevirapine XR group. In general, when adjusted for 
baseline HIV-1 viral load stratum, the difference in the increase in CD4+ cell count for 
the two treatment groups was similar at Week 48 for the nevirapine XR group 
compared with the nevirapine IR group, regardless of whether using observed or LOCF 
values. 
Time to new AIDS or AIDS-related progression event or death 
There were 19 (3.8%) patients with new AIDS events in the nevirapine IR group 
versus 12 (2.4%) in the nevirapine XR group; there were 2 AIDS-related deaths in the 
nevirapine IR group versus none in the nevirapine XR group. Based on the Kaplan-
Meier curves, the cumulative probability of having a new AIDS or AIDS-related 
progression event or death was comparable between the nevirapine IR and XR groups 
during the first 6 weeks of treatment. The probability tended to be higher in the 
nevirapine IR group than the nevirapine XR group starting from Week 6 to the pre-
specified Week 72. The hazard of having a new AIDS or AIDS-related progression 
event or death in the nevirapine XR group was 57% that of the nevirapine IR group, 
with a 95% CI of 28%, 116%, indicating the difference observed was not conclusive.

CDC class; 


Virologic response and trough plasma concentrations 
The effect of trough concentrations on the sustained virologic response at Week 48 was evaluated 
using gMean trough level, which was defined as the geometric mean of all available steady-state 
troughs from Week 4 to Week 48 for each patient. 
Overall, there were no race, gender or region interactions with trough levels when the minimum 
steady-state trough was used.  
Virological resistance 
During Study 1100.1486, 86 patients had on-treatment retention samples selected for genotyping 
based on a review of their virologic profiles. These included 54 patients in the nevirapine IR treatment 
group and 32 patients in the nevirapine XR group. The majority of these patients had discontinued 
study drug treatment due to lack of efficacy (24 and 16 patients in the nevirapine IR and XR group, 
respectively) and AEs (15 and 6 patients in the nevirapine IR and XR group, respectively), and for 
other reasons, such as noncompliance, loss to follow-up or consent withdrawal (5 and 7 patients in the 
nevirapine IR and XR group, respectively). Three (3) patients (all in the nevirapine IR group) had viral 
loads that which were never suppressed through Week 48, and 6 patients (4 in the nevirapine IR and 2 
in the nevirapine XR group) were rebounders, having achieved a viral load nadir of HIV-1 RNA of <400 
copies/mL, with a subsequent viral load increase to >1000 copies/mL. In addition, 4 patients (3 in the 
nevirapine IR and 1 in the nevirapine XR group) were actually responders, but experienced a transient 
increase in viral load during the course of the study, and thus, had on-treatment genotyping.  
The pattern of resistance developed to the drugs used in the treatment regimen was the same in both 
the nevirapine IR and nevirapine XR group. Overall, 41.9% (36/86) of the resistance testing patients 
did not have resistant virus at failure. All of the remaining resistance testing patients (50/86, 58.1%) 
showed resistance to nevirapine, with the majority showing resistance to FTC (43 patients, 50% of all 
Assessment report

resistance testing patients). Tenofovir (TDF) resistance was observed in 13 of the 43 resistance testing 
patients whose virus was resistant to nevirapine and FTC, 15.1% of all resistance testing patients). 
In further evaluation of cross resistance among the more widely used NNRTIs (nevirapine, efavirenz 
[EFV], and etravirine [ETR]) at failure, no difference in resistance related to the study treatment, 
nevirapine IR or XR was observed. Etravirine resistance was observed in 5 patients who had not 
developed nevirapine resistance. Of the 50 patients with nevirapine-resistant virus at failure, 22.0% 
(11/50) were also resistant to EFV but not ETR, 44.0% (22/50) were also resistant to ETR but not EFV, 
and the remaining 34% (17/50) were resistant to all 3 NNRTIs. 
Two new substitutions on nevirapine resistance codons were identified: Y181I and Y188N. Patients with 
these substitutions had substantial decreases in nevirapine susceptibility associated with the 
emergence of these substitutions. 
Study 1100.1526: An open label, phase IIIb, randomized parallel group study to assess the 
efficacy and safety of switching HIV-1 infected patients successfully treated with a 
Nevirapine IR based regimen to Nevirapine XR 400 mg QD or remaining on Nevirapine IR 
200 mg BID based regimen 
Study 1100.1526 is an open-label, randomised, parallel-group study [U10-3028-01]. The objective of 
this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of switching treatment-experienced HIV-1infected 
patients from a Viramune (nevirapine IR) administered 200 mg BID regimen to nevirapine XR 400 mg 
tablets administered QD.  Treatment-experienced patients, who were already on a nevirapine IR BID 
regimen and were virologically suppressed for at least 18 weeks at the time of enrollment and had a 
viral load of <50 copies/mL, were randomized to either nevirapine XR 400 mg QD or nevirapine IR 200 
mg BID. The duration of the study is 48 weeks, with extended treatment up to 144 weeks. A total of 
445 patients entered the study and were randomised in a 2:1 ratio (nevirapine XR : nevirapine IR), 
and 443 were treated with study drugs. 
Methods 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint for Study 1100.1526 is a sustained virologic response through Week 24, using 
the LLOQ=50 copies/ml for viral load. 
A virologic response is defined as two consecutive measurements of viral load <50 copies/ml, at least 
2 weeks apart. A sustained virologic response had no virologic rebound or change of ARV therapy 
(defined below) through Week 24. For Study 1100.1526, the time window of Week 24 is defined as 24 
± 4 weeks from the day a patient started study treatment. 
A virologic rebound is defined as two consecutive measurements of a viral load of ≥50 copies/ml, at 
least 2 weeks apart, following a virologic response. 
Patients, who died, were lost to follow-up, or changed ARV drugs due to toxicity/intolerance that was 
not attributable to the allowed background ARV therapies, were considered treatment failures at the 
time of those events. 
Supplemental SNAPSHOT analyses 
Patients with a viral load < LLOQ in the 24 ± 6 week window were classified as virologic 
responders. 
Virologic outcome at the specified week window was classified into the following categories: 
Assessment report  
EMA/838269/2011  
Page 53/84
 
 
 
  Virologic Success (Virologic Responder) 
  Virologic Failure 
  No virologic Data in the Window: 
  Discontinued study due to AE or death, 
  Discontinued study for other reasons, 
  Missing data during window but on study. 
Antiretroviral background therapy substitutions, permitted per protocol for documented toxicity 
reasons, were permitted on or before the first trial visit without penalty. If the ARV background 
therapy substitutions for toxicity reasons occurred after the first trial visit, then patients were 
considered virologic failures if they had a HIV-1 viral load >50 copies/ml at the time of the switch. 
Key secondary endpoint was: time to loss of virologic response (LLOQ=50 copies/ ml) - The time to 
loss of virologic response is defined as the time between the start of treatment and the confirmed 
virologic rebound.  
Other secondary endpoints 
Sustained virologic response at each visit (LLOQ=50 copies/ml) 
The proportion of patients with a sustained virologic response at each visit for each treatment 
group was calculated using the definitions of a non-responder noted below. 
Definitions of a Non-responder 
For each visit, a subject with the following events prior to or at this visit will be 
considered as a non-responder or failure for that visit if any of the following events 
occur: 
a)  Death 
b)  Permanent discontinuation of the study drug or lost to follow-up 
c)  Introducing a new drug to the regimen 
d)  Have not achieved < LLOQ that was confirmed later for achieved confirmed < 
LLOQ status but rebounded (i.e., two consecutive ≥ LLOQ copies/mL [the latter 
one possibly after the visit of interest], or one ≥ LLOQ copies/mL for the last 
available visit) 
Change from baseline in CD4+ cell count 
The CD4+ cell counts were analyzed as absolute counts. The baseline for a CD4+ cell count was 
calculated based on the arithmetic mean of the last two measurements (if available) before the start of 
treatment with study drug; this value was used to calculate the change from baseline.

virologic response between nevirapine XR and nevirapine IR treatment groups was constructed using 
Cochran’s statistic, stratified by background therapy, and with continuity correction for the variance. 
Non-inferiority of nevirapine XR to nevirapine IR was established if the lower bound of the CI was 
greater than -12%. The -10% non-inferiority margin was added to the Trial Statistical Analysis Plan 
prior to the 24-week database lock and was used for secondary analyses. For the PK analysis, relative 
bioavailability was assessed and minimum and gMean steady state trough concentrations were 
determined. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Of the 443 subjects who received at least one dose of study drug, 432 (97.5%) completed 24 weeks of 
study treatment. The proportion of patients completing 24 weeks of treatment was similar for the two 
groups: nevirapine IR group (97.3%) and nevirapine XR group (97.6%).

Secondary analyses of the primary endpoint 
Secondary analyses for the primary endpoint were performed using combinations of different analysis 
datasets, assays and methods (Table 42).

LLOQ=50 copies/mL, Study 1100.1526 
Supplemental SNAPSHOT analysis of the primary endpoint 
Using the supplemental SNAPSHOT approach with the 18-30 week window and the Amplicor-corrected 
profile, 93.9% (139/148) and 95.9% (283/295) patients in the nevirapine IR and XR groups, 
respectively, were virologic responders at Week 24. Compared with the pre-specified SNAPSHOT 
approach with the 20-28 week window for the primary endpoint, this broader window captured the 
same number of virologic responders for the nevirapine IR group but two additional virologic 
responders for the nevirapine XR group. The virologic failure rates were 2.0% and 1.7% for the 
nevirapine IR and XR groups, respectively. There were 4.1% and 2.4% patients in the nevirapine IR 
and XR groups, respectively, who had no virologic data in the Week 24 window (18-30 weeks). 
Key secondary endpoint  
Time to loss of virologic response 
Based on the Kaplan-Meier curves, the proportion of patients without loss of virologic response 
(LLOQ=50 copies/mL, Amplicor-corrected assay profile) was similar for both treatment groups through 
Week 24. No significant difference in time to loss of virologic response was detected between the two 
treatment groups based on the Cox model, adjusting for background ARV therapy. For the Amplicor-
corrected profile, the hazard ratio of nevirapine XR compared with nevirapine IR was 0.88 (95% CI 
0.42, 1.86). The TaqMan-only analysis supported these findings with a hazard ratio of 0.89 (95% CI 
0.47, 1.68). 
Other secondary endpoints 
Sustained virologic response by visit 
The proportion of sustained virologic responders decreased slightly and gradually from 
Week 0 to Week 24. The two treatments showed very little difference. 
Change from baseline in CD4+ cell count at each visit 
Assessment report

At Week 24, the mean increase from baseline in CD4+ count was +50 cells/mm3 for 
nevirapine IR and +45 cells/mm3 for nevirapine XR, when LOCF values were used. The 
findings were similar when observed values were used for analysis. In general, when 
adjusted for background ARV therapy stratum, the difference in the increase in CD4+ 
cell count from baseline for the two treatment groups was similar at Week 24 for the 
nevirapine XR group compared with the nevirapine IR group, regardless of whether 
using observed or LOCF values.

Subgroup analyses 
The primary endpoint was investigated in the following subgroups: 
  Baseline demographic characteristics, including age, gender, race, ethnicity, and region; 
  Baseline characteristics, including baseline background therapy, CD4+ cell count, and

Study 1100.1518: An open-label, multiple dose, cross-over study to evaluate the steady 
state pharmacokinetic parameters of nevirapine extended release tablets in HIV-1 infected 
children, with an optional extension phase (Phase I) 
Study 1100.1518 is an open-label, multiple dose, cross-over study to evaluate the steady-state 
pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of nevirapine extended release tablets in HIV-1 infected children 3 to 
<18 years of age who had been treated for at least 18 weeks with a nevirapine IR based regimen 
without protease inhibitors and had a screening viral load (VL) <50 copies/ml.  Patients remained on 
their previous background antiretroviral regimen and were treated with Viramune (nevirapine IR) for a 
10-day run-in phase, after which nevirapine XR was administrated once daily for 10 days for PK 
evaluation. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to establish the pharmacokinetic profile at steady state of 
nevirapine XR in children 3 to <18 years of age by obtaining morning trough (pre-dose) plasma and/or 
saliva concentrations in all patients during the PK evaluation phase of the study as well as serial PK 
samples from a subset of patients. Efficacy was evaluated by the proportion of patients maintaining a 
viral load <50 copies/mL at the end of the PK evaluation (Day 22).

Results 
Baseline data 
A total of 85 patients were entered into the study having been treated with a nevirapine IR based 
regimen for at least 18 weeks. The majority of patients, 83.5%, had been on a nevirapine IR based 
regimen for 2 or more years.  Either AZT or D4T plus 3TC were the main NRTI background therapies 
patients taken (87.1%). Patients belonged to the following age categories: 26 patients were 3 to <6 
years old, 26 patients were 6 to <12 years old and 33 patients were 12 to <18 years old. 
Overall, 55.3% of the patients were female; 92.9% were black due to the fact that the majority of 
subjects were enrolled in South Africa and Botswana. 
Key baseline characteristics relative to HIV-1 disease showed that the majority of patients, 87.1%, had 
baseline CD4+ cell counts greater than 500 cells/mm3 and all of the patients with known cell counts 
had counts greater than 200 cells/mm3. Most patients, 90.6%, had baseline CD4+ cell percentage 
greater than 25%.

Outcomes and estimation 
The HIV-1 viral load and CD4+ cell count and percentage were measured at baseline, Visit 3 (Day 11, 
end of nevirapine IR PK run-in phase), and Visit 7 (Day 22, immediately after the nevirapine XR PK 
phase). The proportions of patients with viral load < 50 copies/ml by visit are summarized in Table 46.

Table 46: 
Proportion of patients in Study 1100.1518 with viral load < 50 copies/mL by 
visit - FAS 
Most measurements of VL > 50 copies/ml were isolated and therefore considered “blips” (Table 2.3: 
3). The highest VL measurement was 239 copies/ml in one patient. Viral load measurements from this 
patient returned to VL < 50 copies/ml in subsequent visits. 
No patients met criteria for virologic failure as defined by two consecutive measurements of VL > 50 
copies/ml. 
Geometric mean steady-state nevirapine XR pre-dose trough concentrations (Cpre,ss) were 3880 
ng/ml, 3310 ng/ml and 5350 ng/ml in age groups 3 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 to <18 years 
of age, respectively.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
Special populations were not addressed in the clinical separate studies except for children. Please refer 
to the relevant points.  
In Study 1100.1486, analyses of subpopulations revealed that no relationship was observed between 
age group, gender, race, ethnicity or region and sustained virologic response at Week 48 for the two 
treatment groups.  
In Study 1100.1526, analyses of subpopulations revealed that no relationship was observed between 
age group, gender, race, ethnicity or region and sustained virologic response at Week 24 for the two 
treatment groups.

Treatments groups 
Eligible patients were stratified by their baseline HIV-1 viral load (defined 
as the maximum of screening viral load or Day 0 viral load) to 
≤100,000 copies/mL or >100,000 copies/mL strata. Within each stratum, 
they were randomised to receive 400 mg QD nevirapine XR or 200 mg BID 
nevirapine IR, after a 14-day lead-in period in which all the patients 
received 200 mg QD nevirapine IR formulation. Background ARV therapy 
was Truvada® (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) QD in both 
treatment groups. Treatment duration for the primary endpoint was 48 
weeks with an extension through 144 weeks.  Efficacy, safety, and 
pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated at each study visit.  An 
optional pharmacokinetic substudy included intensive PK blood collection on 
Day 28.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The characteristics and number of study participants are adequate for the proposed objectives in each 
study, taking in consideration that these clinical trials should be regarded as bridging studies in order 
to support an application to extend the Marketing Authorisation. Overall, the demographic and baseline 
characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups for both studies (1100.1486 and 
1100.1526). 
The Study objectives were in line with the proposed methodology. The randomisation methodology is 
adequately described for the presented studies. Only study 1100.1486 is double blind. Studies 
1100.1526 and 1100.1518 are open label studies. Although ideally all the studies should be blinded, 
the primary variables are based on laboratory determinations reducing potential bias. 
The statistical methods and performed analysis were adequate in the trials.  
According to the sample size determination mentioned in the protocol of the study 1100.1526, it was 
planned to randomise 200 patients in the nevirapine XR arm and 100 patients in the nevirapine IR 
arm. The applicant has nevertheless judged necessary to increase the sample size leading to enrol 296 
patients in the nevirapine XR arm and 149 in the in the nevirapine IR arm.  
As patients could have dropped out of the studies before they reached the planned observation time, 
various methods were used to assess the impact of missing data on the efficacy endpoints of the 
studies. In particular, patients with a lack of efficacy would be expected to drop out with a higher 
probability than patients showing a good response. In study 1100.1486 the most frequent reason for 
discontinuation prior to 48 weeks was AE occurrence in 7.3% of all patients (8.3% patients in the 
nevirapine IR group and 6.3% patients in the nevirapine XR group), followed by lack of efficacy in 
4.9% of all patients (5.1% patients in the nevirapine IR group and 4.8% patients in the nevirapine XR 
group). The reason for discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was based on the investigator’s 
Assessment report  
EMA/838269/2011  
Page 70/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
assessment. As it is a double blind study, the risk of bias introduced by the investigator’s judgment 
could be considered acceptable. In general, the frequency of premature discontinuation was 
comparable between the two treatment groups, with the exception of 6 pregnancies, which all occurred 
in the nevirapine XR group. No conclusions can be derived from these figures in pregnant women as 
one case occurred during the Lead in phase and only one pregnancy was treated with NVP IR. In Study 
1100.1526, the most frequent reason for discontinuation prior to 24 weeks was AE occurrence for 3 
patients in the nevirapine XR group, followed by lost to follow up for 2 patients (1 in each treatment 
group) and noncompliance (2 patients in the nevirapine XR group).  
It would have been appropriate to perform a sensitivity analysis to take into account missing data at 
week 48 due to a premature discontinuation of treatment, all the more that the number of treatment 
discontinuation is somewhat more important in the nevirapine IR arm than in the XR arm (92 vs 80).  
Due to NVP XR dosing schedule (once a day) it was expected that compliance would be better for the 
XR than in IR group. In general, the frequency of premature discontinuation was comparable between 
the two treatment groups.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The MAH presented a short clinical programme in order to support the Extension Application for three 
new formulations (Nevirapine prolonged-release tablets 400 mg, 100 mg and 50 mg).  
In addition to PK/PD studies, three clinical studies were presented.  
The efficacy data showed that the XR formulation was not inferior to the IR presentations. For some of 
the evaluated variables there was a trend in favour of the XR tablets. One of the potential advantages 
of the once a day regimen is the better compliance. This was however not shown in the provided 
clinical studies. Nevertheless, this could perhaps be explained by the “controlled” environment in 
clinical trials.  
The presented clinical programme should be regarded as a bridging programme towards the new 
prolonged-release forms since it would be insufficient on its own to support the nevirapine indication 
on HIV infection treatment. 
Study 1100.1486 
Since the pre-specified non-inferiority margin was -10%, the -0.1% lower bound demonstrated the 
non-inferiority of nevirapine XR to nevirapine IR treatment (p-value <0.0001 for the non-inferiority 
test). The results of the secondary analyses of the primary endpoint also support the non-inferiority of 
nevirapine XR to nevirapine IR, according to the pre-specified –10% non-inferiority margin. 
The analysis of the secondary endpoints supports the findings on the main endpoint.  
For trough concentrations above 1 μg/ml, there appeared to be no effect of the nevirapine trough level 
on the proportion of virologic responders when using the gMean trough level. Patients in the 1 to<2 
μg/ml trough group had comparable virologic response rates with those in the ≥2 μg/ml trough 
groups. These findings were consistent when the minimum steady-state nevirapine trough from Week 
4 to Week 48 for each patient was used as the trough level.  
For nevirapine XR, the 10th percentile trough concentrations were all above 1,800 ng/ml (Week 4 to 
Week 48). This concentration was at least 13.4-fold higher than the concentration necessary to inhibit 
90% of viral replication (IC90) for wild type HIV-1 virus. The CHMP agrees on that the concentration 
results, along with the efficacy results, suggesting that treatment with nevirapine XR 400 mg QD was 
effective even though lower nevirapine exposures were observed compared with those for nevirapine 
IR treatment.

Study 1100.1526 
Primary endpoint analysis demonstrated the non-inferiority of nevirapine XR to nevirapine IR 
treatment.  
Results from all of the secondary analyses of the primary endpoint also demonstrate the non-inferiority 
of nevirapine XR to nevirapine IR treatment, based on the pre-specified -12% non-inferiority margin 
and the more stringent -10% non-inferiority margin. 
There was a small difference on CD4+ cell counts in favour of NVP IR group (see table below) that is 
probably not clinically relevant.  
Table 50: 
Change from baseline in CD4+ count (cells/mm3) at Week 24, Study 
1100.1526 - FAS 
There was no trough effect found on the proportion of virologic responders for either treatment group. 
Subgroup analysis (Study 1100.1486 and Study 1100.1526) 
For Study 1100.1486, there appeared to be no relationship between the proportion of sustained 
virologic response at Week 48 and any baseline demographic characteristic (age group, gender, race, 
ethnicity and region) or other baseline characteristic (CD4+ cell count, HIV-1 sub-type, CDC class, and 
lead-in duration). Descriptive statistics showed that patients with a baseline HIV-1 viral load ≤100,000 
copies/ml had a higher proportion of sustained virologic response at Week 48 (79.2% in the nevirapine 
IR and 85.9% in the nevirapine XR group) than those with >100,000 copies/ml (70.9% in the 
nevirapine IR and 73.2% in the nevirapine XR group). For each viral load stratum, the nevirapine XR 
group had a higher proportion of virologic responders than the nevirapine IR group. 
For Study 1100.1526 there was no apparent relationship between the proportion of sustained virologic 
response at Week 24 and any baseline demographic characteristic (age group, gender, race, ethnicity 
and region) or baseline characteristic, including type of background therapy received, nevirapine as the 
first HAART regimen, duration of previous nevirapine IR treatment, and type of previous background 
therapy prior to study medication. Nevertheless a trend to more favorable results on XR group was 
found in patients on Kivexa/Epzicom background therapy (86.1% in the nevirapine IR and 97.3 % in 
the nevirapine XR group). 
Virological resistance 
Based on the analyses for the 86 resistance testing patients, the observed mutations were those that 
would be expected with a nevirapine-based regimen according to the current nevirapine label and the 
IAS list of nevirapine-associated mutations. Two new amino acid substitutions were identified as being 
associated with nevirapine failure and phenotypic resistance to nevirapine in this study: Y181I and 
Y188N. No difference in resistance related to the formulation type (nevirapine IR and nevirapine XR)

was observed. Thus, XR formulation does not appear to induce virological resistance in excess when 
compared to IR formulation.  
Study 1100.1518 
The main study conclusions are endorsed as the administration of nevirapine XR once daily formulation 
either as 2 or 3 tablets of 100 mg strength or 1 tablet of 400 mg strength achieved the target trough 
concentrations across doses and age groups, which have been demonstrated to be effective in adults. 
These trough concentrations are above a pre-established target concentration of approximately 3,000 
ng/ml with a once-daily dosing regimen. 
Viral load suppression during the short duration of dosing with neviraine XR in this PK study was 
maintained. Overall, nevirapine XR was safe and well tolerated in patients 3 years of age or older who 
were able to swallow tablets. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of nevirapine prolonged-release tablet is considered non-inferior to that of nevirapine IR 
tablet in both treatment-naïve and treatment–experienced (switch) HIV-1 infected patients.  For 
paediatric patients, study 1100.1518 demonstrates that the 100 mg nevirapine XR dose increment is 
appropriate and provides adequate dose adjustment for paediatric patients switching from twice daily 
nevirapine IR to once daily XR dosage forms. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The overall extent of exposure for nevirapine XR was 1,265 subjects. This included 1,182 adults and 83 
children. 
In Phase I studies, single doses of nevirapine XR prototypes were received by 242 male volunteers; 
and nevirapine XR prototypes were administered for 21 days to 92 patients. Forty-eight male 
volunteers received single doses of nevirapine XR in a Phase I bioequivalence study. 
There were 85 children enrolled in a multiple-dose 10-day Phase I pharmacokinetic study.  There were 
83 children exposed to nevirapine XR. The mean duration of exposure was 10 days, and most children 
were exposed for at least 7 days.  
In Phase III studies, 800 patients received the final 400 mg nevirapine XR formulation proposed for 
registration, 736 patients for at least 24 weeks, 423 patients for at least 48 weeks, and 165 patients 
for at least 72 weeks 
Adverse events  
Phase I studies 
The nevirapine XR safety data reported in 3 short-term exposure clinical studies (treatment duration 1 
to 21 days; Study 1100.1485, Study 1100.1489, and Study 1100.1517) did not reveal any new or 
unexpected safety issue and were consistent with the list of side effects expected with nevirapine IR as 
described in the labeling. These studies (Study 1100.1485, Study 1100.1489) were conducted to test 
and select the formulation and dose of the nevirapine XR formulation for further development. As no 
obvious safety signals arose, the clinical program progressed to Phase III. 
Assessment report  
EMA/838269/2011  
Page 73/84
 
 
 
 
Additional Phase I studies were performed in support of the paediatric indication (Study 1100.1531 and 
Study 1100.1518).  No safety issues arose in these studies.  
Single-dose studies in healthy volunteers 
Across the single-dose PK studies, no deaths occurred, there were 2 SAEs reported, and 2 subjects 
discontinued due to adverse events. The investigator-defined drug-related AEs were generally mild or 
moderate in intensity. One subject had a mild drug-related rash during treatment with nevirapine IR. 
No obvious dose or formulation relationships with AE rates were observed. The single-dose Phase I 
studies demonstrated adequate safety and tolerability to proceed with the clinical evaluation of 
selected nevirapine XR prototypes in Study 1100.1489 and Study 1100.1518. 
Study 1100.1489 - multiple-dose PK study in HIV+ patients (n = 92) 
One subject experienced an SAE (moderate hypoacusis), but this SAE was not considered related to 
drug. No subjects experienced severe or life-threatening AEs and no subjects experienced AEs that led 
to discontinuation of study treatment. No subjects died during the study. Twenty-four (26.1%) of the 
92 patients reported at least 1 AE during the (baseline) nevirapine IR period. During treatment with 
nevirapine XR, the incidence of AEs ranged from 28.6% in subjects in the nevirapine XR 300 mg HPMC 
25% group to 58.3% in the nevirapine XR 400 mg HPMC 25% group. All AEs were categorized as 
DAIDS Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate). The most frequently reported SOCs were Infections and 
Infestations (24 subjects), followed by Gastrointestinal Disorders (15 subjects), and Nervous System 
Disorders (14 subjects). The most frequently reported preferred term was nasopharyngitis (10 
subjects). AEs considered related to the study drug were reported in 6 subjects.  
Study 1100.1518 - Multiple-dose PK study in HIV-1 infected children (IR, n = 85; XR, n = 83)  
There were no deaths and no SAEs during the nevirapine IR or XR treatment period.  One subject 
discontinued for an SAE in the post-treatment phase. This event was not considered by the 
investigator to be drug-related. No patient discontinued due to an adverse event. There were no Grade 
4 adverse events. There was one patient with Grade 3 pyrexia; however, the pyrexia was categorized 
as unrelated to study drug by the Investigator.  
The percentage of patients who experienced at least one adverse event was 28.2% (24/85) in the IR 
treatment phase and 47.0% (39/83) of patients in the XR treatment phase. The difference between 
the percentage of patients reporting adverse events in the IR and XR treatment periods was largely 
due to the increased number of infections during the XR treatment period. None of these infections 
were considered related to study drug.  
The most frequently reported AEs by system organ class were infections and infestations (IR, 8/85 
patients, 9.4%; XR, 20/83 patients, 24.1%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (IR, 5/85 
patients, 5.9%; XR, 9/83 patients, 10.8%) and respiratory disorders (IR, 9/85 patients, 10.6%; XR, 
5/83 patients, 6.0%). The frequency of reported AEs by system organ class was similar among the 
three age groups during the nevirapine IR run-in and nevirapine XR phases. 
There were 10 patients during each treatment phase who experienced AEs considered by the 
investigator to be related to the study drug (IR, 10/85 patients, 11.8%, XR, 10/83 patients, 12%).  
The most frequent AEs considered by the investigator to be possibly drug-related were headache (IR, 
4/85 patients, 4.7%; XR 1/83 patients, 1.2%) and rash (IR 4/85 patients, 4.7%; XR 7/83 patients, 
8.4%]. 
There were 7 subjects with drug-related rash during the XR treatment phase or within 10 days of the 
last dose of XR. Although these patients had rashes that were considered possibly related to nevirapine 
by the investigator, all of the events occurred in patients after more than 18 weeks of nevirapine IR 
treatment (usual time-frame of nevirapine-related occurrences). Further, all but 1 of the patients with 
Assessment report

a rash were from the same study site, in a community which had experienced an outbreak of measles. 
There were no concomitant increases in LFTs. Most events were rated as mild, and no patient 
discontinued nevirapine due to the events. This information supports that the clinical likelihood of 
these events being related to nevirapine is low.   
Phase III studies 
The AE data were presented separately for the two Phase III studies due to major differences in: study 
design (double-blind, double-dummy [Study 1100.1486] vs. open-label [Study 1100.1526]), patient 
populations (HIV-1 treatment-naïve patients [Study 1100.1486] versus patients already on nevirapine 
IR treatment [Study 1100.1526]) and primary endpoint study duration (48 weeks [Study 1100.1486] 
vs. 24 weeks [Study 1100.1526]). Also, for Study 1100.1486, AE data were presented separately for 
the two-week lead-in phase  
(pre-randomisation, all patients on nevirapine IR 200 mg once-daily (as recommended in the current 
nevirapine IR label) and the randomised phase (nevirapine XR 400 mg once-daily vs. IR 200 mg twice-
daily). 
Study 1100.1486 - lead-in phase 
Of the 1068 patients treated with at least one dose of 200 mg nevirapine IR during the lead-in phase 
(treated set), 465 (43.5%) reported at least one AE, 210 patients (19.7% of the total population) a 
drug-related AE (according to the investigator), and 45 (4.2%) an AE leading to (temporary) 
discontinuation of study drug (7 of these restarted treatment and went on into randomisation; 38 
[3.6%] did not continue into the randomized phase). Overall, 55 patients (5.1%) were not 
randomized. 
Twenty patients (1.9%) reported an SAE during the lead-in phase (among those patients, 7 each were 
reported in the SOCs Infections and Infestations and Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue). The main reason 
for the “Seriousness” criterion was hospitalization. No deaths were reported during the lead-in phase. 
Patients reported 317 (29.7%) AEs of mild intensity (DAIDS Grade 1); 118 (11.0%), 28 (2.6%) and 2 
(0.2%) patients reported AEs of moderate (Grade 2), severe (Grade 3), and potentially life-threatening 
(Grade 4) intensity, respectively. 
Among the AEs reported during the lead-in phase, the most frequent were rash (79 [7.4%]), nausea 
(68 [6.4%]), headache (57 [5.3%]), fatigue (40 [3.7%]) and pyrexia (22 [2.1%]). 
Most of the 55 patients not continuing to the randomisation phase reported rash (31/55) or pyrexia 
(14/55). AEs reported by this group were mostly DAIDS Grade 2 or 3. Two cases of Steven-Johnson 
syndrome (0.2%) were reported during the lead-in phase. 
Hepatic events were reported by 5 [0.5%] patients during the lead-in phase, and 3 of these patients 
were not randomized. Those 3 patients had multiple symptoms specific for hepatitis and reported 
hypersensitivity reactions. No patients experienced asymptomatic transaminase elevations. 
Study 1100.1486 - randomised phase 
Of the 1011 patients treated with at least one blinded dose of either nevirapine XR (n = 505) or 
nevirapine IR (n = 506) during the double-blind randomised phase (full analysis set) until data cut-off 
date, 895 (88.5%) reported at least one AE (XR: 443 [87.7%], IR: 452 [89.3%]). Of these, for 223 
patients (22.1% of the FAS population) an investigator-rated drug-related AE was reported (XR: 100 
[19.8%], IR: 123 [24.3%]). In 77 (7.6%) patients, an AE lead to discontinuation of study drug (XR: 
32 [6.3%], IR: 45 [8.9%]). Six deaths (0.6%) were observed, 1 (0.2%) in the XR group and 5 (1.0%) 
in the IR group (two of these after Week 48). None were considered related to the study treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/838269/2011  
Page 75/84
 
 
 
The AE pattern observed during the double-blind phase of Study 1100.1486 was consistent with the 
previously known safety and tolerability profile of nevirapine IR. A consistent trend was observed 
towards lower incidences in favour of nevirapine XR vs. nevirapine IR for: 
  AEs leading to discontinuation (6.3% vs. 8.9%), 
  AEs considered drug-related by the investigator (19.8% vs. 24.3%), 
  Hepatic events (5.5% vs. 9.1%) and symptomatic hepatic events (1.6% vs. 2.8%) 
  DAIDS Grade 3 and 4 AEs (14.5% vs. 18.0%), and 
  Deaths (0.2% [1/505] vs. 1.0% [5/506]). 
Study 1100.1526 
Of the 443 patients treated with at least one dose post-randomisation of either nevirapine XR (n = 
295) or nevirapine IR (n = 148), 312 (70.4%) reported at least one AE (XR: 223 [75.6%], IR: 89 
[60.1%]). Of these, for 38 (8.6% of the FAS population) an investigator-rated drug-related AE was 
reported (XR: 35 [11.9%], IR 3 [2.0%]). In 3 (1.0%) patients randomized to XR, an AE lead to 
discontinuation of study drug (no patients on IR discontinued due to an AE). No deaths were observed 
in Study 1100.1526 during the observation period covered by this safety analysis. 
In this open-label study, there were higher rates of AEs reported in those changing to investigational 
therapy with nevirapine XR compared to the rates observed in those patients continuing on their 
previous licensed therapy of nevirapine IR. This finding is inconsistent with the results of the double-
blind study in treatment-naïve patients (Study 1100.1486). The reporting difference in AEs between 
treatment groups observed in Study 1100.1526 was mainly due to differences in the frequency of mild 
events, 35.8% with nevirapine IR vs. 49.5% with nevirapine XR. AEs identified as occurring more 
frequently were events in the following SOCs: Gastrointestinal disorders, Central Nervous System 
disorders, Psychiatric disorders, and General disorders.  No notable difference in AEs between 
treatment groups was reported for AEs of DAIDS Grade 2 or higher. 
The most likely cause for the observed difference in reported AEs between nevirapine XR and 
nevirapine IR in the open-label switching Study 1100.1526 is a reporting bias in favour of the 
previously prescribed, “familiar” treatment (in this case, nevirapine IR), and to the disadvantage of the 
new investigational treatment (in this case, nevirapine XR). This hypothesis is supported by results of 
the double-blind pivotal Phase III Study 1100.1486, which showed a favourable tolerability and safety 
profile of nevirapine XR compared to nevirapine IR. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Phase I studies 
Deaths 
No deaths occurred in any of the Phase I studies.  
Serious adverse events 
Four SAEs occurred during the course of the Phase I studies: appendicitis, syphilis illness with 
hypoacusis, anal abscess and pneumonia. None of these events was considered related to the study 
drug.

Adverse events leading to discontinuations 
In Study 1100.1484, 2 subjects discontinued due to adverse events (fracture of ankle and 
thrombocytopenia). 
Phase III studies 
Deaths - Study 1100.1486 
Ten deaths occurred in this study. Four patients died from events that started during screening and 
prior to receipt of any medication, 5 patients died from events that occurred during randomized 
treatment, and 1 patient died from an event that started after stopping the study medication. Four 
patients died in the nevirapine IR treatment group and 1 patient died in the nevirapine XR group, none 
related to study medication. 
Deaths - Study 1100.1526 
No deaths occurred in this study. 
SAEs (except those leading to death) 
In Study 1100.1486, a total of 20 (1.9%) patients with SAEs were reported during the lead-in phase, 9 
of which continued into the randomized phase. After randomization, SAEs were observed in 58 patients 
(11.5%) in the nevirapine XR group and in 54 patients (10.7%) in the nevirapine IR group. The most 
frequently reported SOC as an SAE was Infections and Infestations with an incidence of 4.1% 
(41/1011). Overall, the most frequently reported SAEs were pneumonia, depression, and Kaposi’s 
sarcoma, each reported in ≤3 patients in either treatment group. 
In Study 1100.1526, SAEs were reported in 21 (4.7%) patients (17/295 [5.8%] in the nevirapine XR 
group and 4/148 [2.7%] in the IR group), across a variety of SOCs. No SAE was considered related to 
study drug by the investigator or the sponsor.  
Adverse events leading to discontinuations 
In Study 1100.1486, 37/1068 patients (3.5%) experienced AEs during the 2-week lead-in phase that 
prevented continuation into the randomized phase. During the randomized phase, an AE lead to 
discontinuation of study drug in 77/1011 (7.6%) of patients (XR: 32 [6.3%], IR: 45 [8.9%]). The 
majority of patients who withdrew from the study discontinued in the first 6 weeks of the randomized 
phase.  In Study 1100.1526, three patients (all in the XR group) experienced an AE leading to 
discontinuation. 
Laboratory findings 
Patients in nevirapine XR Phase I and III studies experienced no new lab abnormalities beyond those 
already associated with nevirapine.  No evidence of a change in risk or new safety signal was observed 
with the use of either nevirapine XR or nevirapine IR.  No relevant differences between nevirapine IR 
or XR formulations were found. 
Safety in special populations 
No relevant differences between nevirapine IR or XR formulations were found on special population 
analysis. 
Adverse event analysis by gender 
Gender differences for specific AEs reported in >5% of patients overall indicate that women generally 
reported higher frequencies of AEs than did men; only nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, and diarrhea were 
Assessment report  
EMA/838269/2011  
Page 77/84
 
 
 
reported in larger proportions of men than women. The trend of larger proportions of women reporting 
AEs than men was maintained when analyzed for each treatment group separately. 
Women reported a lower frequency of events in the nevirapine XR group compared with women in the 
nevirapine IR group (any AE: XR: 60 [81.1%], IR: 71 [94.7%]. 
In Study 1100.1486, women reported a higher frequency of investigator-defined drug-related rash 
compared to men. Compared to women treated with nevirapine XR, women treated with nevirapine IR 
tended to report a higher number of events, although the total number of women with reported events 
was small. In Study 1100.1526, the AE rates observed by gender were generally consistent with those 
observed for the overall study population. 
For female patients, hepatic events were observed more frequently in the IR group than in the XR 
group. 22 symptomatic events were identified, with 4 of 149 (2.7%) women affected (all in the IR 
group), and 18 of 862 (2.1%) men (8 in the XR group and 10 in the IR group). Grade 3/4 ALT and AST 
elevations were reported by 13 of 149 (8.7%) women (4-XR, 9-IR) and 54 of 862 (6.3%) men (26-XR, 
28-IR). In Study 1100.1526, the AE rates observed by gender were generally consistent with those 
observed for the overall study population 
Adverse events by treatment and race 
For Study 1100.1486, adverse events reported by race exhibited similar trends to those observed for 
overall adverse events in all randomized patients. A slightly higher proportion of White patients 
reported any AE with nevirapine IR than Black patients, 91% vs. 82%, respectively.  
In general, in Study 1100.1486 the proportion of  White patients reporting any AEs was slightly higher 
in the nevirapine IR than in the nevirapine XR group (91% vs. 88%); a slightly higher proportion of 
Black patients reported any AE with nevirapine XR than nevirapine IR (87% vs. 82%, respectively).  
Regarding Worst DAIDS severity, no meaningful differences were observed in either Study 1100.1486 
or Study 1100.1526 for the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 AEs by race. 
For the AE of rash, a slightly lower proportion of blacks reported this event relative to whites; however, 
the numbers for rash were small.  
In Study 1100.1486, the hepatic events observed among races exhibited similar trends to those 
reported for overall hepatic events in all randomized patients.  
Pregnancy 
A total of 10 pregnancies occurred during the conduct of the 2 Phase III studies.  
In Study 1100.1486, one woman discontinued during the lead-in phase, and  had a normal pregnancy 
and live birth. Eight pregnancies occurred after randomization; one was in the nevirapine IR group and 
seven were in the nevirapine XR group. The woman from the nevirapine IR group opted for an induced 
abortion. In the nevirapine XR group, one woman had a spontaneous abortion; one was still pregnant 
at the time of data cut-off; and 3 had a normal delivery. Two women discontinued, withdrew consent 
and/or were lost to follow-up, and thus delivery data were not available. No untoward effects of 
nevirapine were reported with any of the pregnancies or the babies. In Study 1100.1526, 1 woman 
discontinued from study then experienced a spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) after 4 weeks of 
pregnancy.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new drug interaction studies were conducted with nevirapine XR. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of the active pharmaceutical ingredient nevirapine has previously been established 
through the development and widespread use of nevirapine IR. The drug substance used in the 
nevirapine prolonged-release formulation is identical to that used in nevirapine IR tablets and, 
therefore, observed adverse events with nevirapine XR were expected to be very similar to those 
observed with nevirapine IR. Some expectation of a lower incidence of adverse events was 
hypothesized if a lower Cmax could be achieved for the nevirapine XR formulation.  
Across the four (4) single-dose PK studies in 375 healthy volunteers (Studies 1100.1484, 1100.1485, 
1100.1517, and 1100.00 1531), the Phase I multiple-dose study in HIV-1 infected patients (Study 
1100.1489), and the Phase I multiple-dose 10-day PK study in children (Study 1100.1518), no new or 
unexpected adverse events were observed. The Phase I trials demonstrated adequate safety and 
tolerability to proceed with the clinical development program for nevirapine XR. 
In the pivotal study, Study 1100.1486 (treatment-naïve HIV-1-positive patients), 55 of 1068 patients 
discontinued the trial during the lead-in phase while receiving 200 mg nevirapine IR QD. Thirty-eight of 
these patients discontinued due to adverse events, primarily rash, consistent with the nevirapine IR 
label recommendations.  In the randomised phase, adverse events had a numerically lower frequency 
in the nevirapine XR group than in the IR group as AEs summarized as “any AE” (87.7% vs. 89.3%), 
investigator-defined  
drug-related AEs (19.8% vs. 24.3%), patients with AEs leading to study discontinuation (6.3% vs. 
8.9%), and patients with DAIDS severity Grade 3 or 4 AEs (14.5% vs. 18%). A total of 6 deaths 
occurred after randomisation, 5 were in the nevirapine IR group and no deaths were related to study 
treatment. 
In Study 1100.1526 (open-label trial in nevirapine treated patients), higher event rates were observed 
in nevirapine XR patients compared to nevirapine IR patients, respectively, as measured by proportion 
of patients with any AE (75.6% vs. 60.1%), investigator-defined drug-related AEs (11.9% vs. 2.0%), 
patients with AEs leading to study discontinuation (1.0% vs. 0%), and patients with SAEs (5.8% vs. 
2.7%). However, AEs with DAIDS severity Grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred at similar rates (3.7% vs. 4.1%) 
in nevirapine XR and nevirapine IR groups, respectively.  The applicant argues that the most likely 
cause for the observed difference in reported AEs between nevirapine XR and nevirapine IR in this 
open-label switching study is a reporting bias in favour of the previously prescribed, “familiar” 
treatment ( nevirapine IR) and to the disadvantage of the new investigational treatment (nevirapine 
XR). The given explanation could be acceptable as such differences were not found in the double blind 
1100.1486 study. 
Rash and hepatic events were collected as AEs of special interest. In the pivotal trial, rash events 
occurred at a rate of 8.1% in the lead-in phase and were similar in frequency for the 2 treatment 
groups after randomisation, occurring in 8.3% of nevirapine XR patients and 8.7% of nevirapine IR 
patients. Hepatic events occurred less frequently in nevirapine XR than in nevirapine IR recipients 
(5.5% vs. 9.1%). This trend was consistent for events of clinical hepatitis and severe liver 
transaminase increases.  
In Study 1100.1518, children received nevirapine IR and nevirapine XR for 10 days. There were no 
potentially life-threatening AEs, SAEs or AEs that led to discontinuation during the treatment phase. 
Assessment report  
EMA/838269/2011  
Page 79/84
 
 
 
 
One subject discontinued for an SAE in the post-treatment phase. No patient died during the study. 
Rash was reported by 7 patients during treatment with nevirapine XR.  While these rashes were 
considered related to treatment by the Investigator, the occurrence of a measles outbreak made the 
association with study treatment uncertain. There were no unexpected clinically significant laboratory 
findings. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, no new AEs from those previously known to be associated with nevirapine use have been 
identified in the course of the studies comparing the XR and IR formulations in adults or children. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant in Module 1.8.1 
of the marketing authorisation fulfils the legislative requirements. 
Risk Management Plan 
The MAA submitted a risk management plan (final version 1.2 adopted) 
A revised RMP was provided during the procedure, detailing nevirapine drug interaction (section 1.6 of 
RMP). As a risk minimisation measure of granulocytopenia, a warning will be added to sections 4.4 and 
4.5 of the SmPC. 
TABLE 51: 
TABLE SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANGAMENT PLAN 
Safety concern 
Agreed pharmacovigilance 
activities  
Important identified risk: 
Skin rash, including severe 
or life-threatening skin 
reactions, e.g. Stevens-
Johnson syndrome and 
toxic epidermal necrolysis 
Important identified risk: 
Severe and life-threatening 
hepatotoxicity incl. fatal 
fulminant hepatitis 
The incidence of these events is 
documented in the various clinical 
studies. These AEs are well 
characterized; the CCDS and the EU 
SmPC address subjects with increased 
risk for these events. 
A routine pharmacovigilance process

Important identified risk: 
Granulocytopenia, 
particularly in paediatric 
population 
The incidence of these events is 
documented in the various clinical 
studies. These AEs are well 
characterised; the CCDS and the EU 
SmPC address subjects with increased 
risk for these events. 
A routine pharmacovigilance process 
will be used to monitor the incidence of 
these identified risks. 
 The MAH will update 
the sections "Special 
Warnings and 
Precautions" and 
"Interactions" of the EU 
SmPC with a statement: 
Granulocytopenia is 
commonly associated 
with zidovudine. 
Therefore, patients who 
receive nevirapine and 
zidovudine 
concomitantly and 
especially paediatric 
patients and patients 
who receive higher 
zidovudine doses or 
patients with poor bone 
marrow reserve, in 
particular those with 
advanced HIV disease, 
have an increased risk 
of granulocytopenia. In 
such patients 
haematological 
parameters should be 
carefully monitored. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional 
risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 
User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found partially acceptable for the following 
reasons:  
The applicant argued that the proposed Package Leaflet for Viramune prolonged-release tablets are 
based on the recently successfully tested and approved PL for Viramune 200 mg tablets and Viramune 
50 mg/5 ml oral suspension (in May 2009) which contains nearly identical information and no 
significant changes are being made which would influence the readability.   
The justification provided however cannot be endorsed due to the new dosing regimen of this new 
formulation and the safety differences between the approved and proposed package leaflets. 
Therefore: 
 
the applicant will submit a bridging study based on the approved PL (resulting from the type II/82 
variation) and to include the result of the testing into an upcoming application. 
Combined Package Leaflet 
The applicant proposes to have a separate package leaflet for the Viramune 400 mg prolonged-release 
tablet and a combined package leaflet for Viramune 100 mg and 50 mg based on the following: 
 
The posology in the SPC/PL mandates two dosages: a “lead-in” period of Viramune oral suspension 
once daily, after which the paediatric patient is switched to a maintenance dose of Viramune 
Assessment report  
EMA/838269/2011  
Page 81/84
 
 
 
 
prolonged-release 100 mg or 50 mg tablets once daily based on the body weight or body surface 
area. 
 
The Package Leaflets of the two different strengths are completely identical, except for few 
strength-specific details. 
 
The maintenance dose is calculated either according to body weight or body surface area. As a 
consequence the body weight and body height has to be checked frequently by the physician in 
order to adjust the dose if necessary. In the currently approved package leaflet for Viramune Oral 
Suspension no specific dose according to body weight or body surface area is given for the 
maintenance phase in order to avoid a wrong dosing by the child’s parents. A general statement is 
given that the child’s doctor will decide the right dose based either on the child’s weight or body 
surface area. A similar wording is suggested for the paediatric strengths 100 mg and 50 mg of 
Viramune prolonged-release tablets. This guidance additionally avoids confusion of the patient. 
The justifications for the request for a combined PL are found to be in line with the current QRD 
recommendations ("Compilation of QRD decisions on stylistic matters in product information") and 
therefore endorsed by CHMP. 
2.8.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
The beneficial effects obtained in the above presented clinical trials are consistent and in line with the 
body of knowledge previously described for the immediate release formulations. 
Risks 
  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of the active pharmaceutical ingredient nevirapine has previously been established 
through the development and widespread use of nevirapine immediate release formulations. The drug 
substance used in the nevirapine prolonged-release formulation is identical to that used in nevirapine 
IR tablets.  As expected, observed adverse events with nevirapine XR were expected to be very similar 
to those observed with nevirapine IR.  
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Some expectation of a lower incidence of adverse events was hypothesized if a lower Cmax could be 
achieved for the nevirapine XR formulation. Indeed, during the double-blind phase of study 1100.1486, 
a consistent trend was observed towards lower incidences in favour of nevirapine XR vs. nevirapine IR.  
This needs however to be confirmed in clinical practice (post-authorisation). 
Benefit-risk balance 
The prolonged-release formulation (XR) met the PK target levels, demonstrated non-inferior efficacy in 
comparison to nevirapine immediate release (IR) and exhibited similar safety. Therefore, the 
advantage of the once daily convenience of the prolonged-release formulation could be beneficial for 
patients.

3. Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Viramune prolonged-release tablets indicated in combination with other 
anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adolescents and children three 
years and above and able to swallow tablets (not suitable for the 14-day lead-in phase for patients 
starting nevirapine) (50mg/100 mg) and indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal 
products for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults, adolescents and children three years and above 
and able to swallow tablets (not suitable for the 14-day lead-in phase for patients starting nevirapine) 
(400 mg) was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation 
subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (See Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Risk management system and PSUR cycle 
The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, presented in Module 1.8.1 of the 
marketing authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market. 
The MAH shall perform the pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as 
agreed the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP. 
As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the 
updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR). 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
  When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, 
Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities 
  Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached 
at the request of the EMA 
The PSUR cycle for the product will follow the standard requirements until otherwise agreed by the 
CHMP.   In this sense, it is agreed by CHMP to continue the currently pursued annual PSUR schedule, 
and to integrate nevirapine safety data for all dosage forms (immediate and prolonged-release tablets 
as well as oral suspension) into one document. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
None 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
to be implemented by the Member States

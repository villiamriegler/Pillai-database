1.  Introduction 
On 08th September 2015, the MAH submitted a paediatric study addendum for study XM22-07 for 
Lonquex 6 mg solution for injection (EU/1/13/856/001-002), in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
The study addendum was to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, safety, 
tolerability and immunogenicity of a Single, Subcutaneous Dose of 100μg/kg XM22 in 21 children with 
Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma.  
The submitted study has been completed in accordance with an approved paediatric investigational 
plan (EMEA-001019-PIP01-10-M02; European Commission Decision 06 May 2014). 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The active substance of Lonquex (lipegfilgrastim) is a covalent conjugate of filgrastim (recombinant 
methionyl human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, produced in E coli by recombinant technology) 
with methoxy polyethylene glycol via a carbohydrate linker. 
In order to support the original application for a licence, the company submitted a comparability 
exercise to pegfilgrastim (Neulasta, Amgen), a long-acting recombinant granulocyte-colony stimulating 
factor. 
Lonquex was approved for use in adults by the CHMP in 27/07/2013. 
Lonquex has the following indication: 
Reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in 
adult patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception 
of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes). 
According to the company: 
The company now submits a paediatric clinical study report addendum in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. The submitted study has been completed in accordance with an 
approved paediatric investigational plan (EMEA-001019-PIP01-10-M02; Commission Decision 06 May 
2014). 
This is a follow up submission to procedure number EMA/H/C/002556/P46/008 where the clinical study 
report for study XM22-07 (based on the end of treatment period) was assessed. Further to the 
outcome of this procedure on 16 February 2015 a Type IB variation (EMEA/H/C/002556/IB/0014) was 
submitted in order to implement agreed wording to include the available paediatric pharmacokinetics 
data from study XM22-07 in the SPC, approved on 16 June 2015. 
The last-patient last-visit of the follow up period for study XM22-07 was 21 April 2015. Consequently a 
separate addendum report which covers the follow up data including the results of immunogenicity 
testing, survival status and G-CSF therapy is now submitted. 
There are no regulatory consequences identified by the MAH as a result of this study and no changes 
to the product information are recommended based on the submitted clinical study report addendum.

2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
CHMP’s comment: As stated by the company, study XM22-07 was assessed earlier in 2015 via 
procedure P46/08 (final Rapporteur AR dated 16th Feb 2015) and subsequent variation 1B/014 (May 
2015) to introduce information on the paediatric population. The current report assesses follow-up data 
for results of immunogenicity testing, survival status and G-CSF therapy. 
2.2.2.  Clinical study 
Study title: Multicenter, Open-label Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, 
Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a Single, Subcutaneous Dose of 100 μg/kg XM22 
in 21 Children with Ewing Family of Tumors or Rhabdomyosarcoma. Addendum 01. 
Study code: XM22-07. Addendum 01. 
A phase 1 study 
EudraCT Number: 2011-004742-18 
Follow-up Period Start: 16 May 2014 
Follow-up Period End: 21 April 2015 
Addendum Approval Date: 31 August 2015 
Description 
21 subjects were enrolled. The follow-up period for study XM22-07 was 360 days with visits on days 
180 and 360. Results of survival status and the use of additional granulocyte colony stimulating factor 
(G-CSF) therapies are presented. In addition, immunogenicity testing results of samples collected from 
both the XM22 treatment period and this follow-up period are described.

Methods 
Immunogenicity testing. 
Characterization of the immunogenicity to XM22 was a secondary objective of the study XM22-07. 
Samples for immunogenicity testing, specifically anti-drug antibody (ADA) were collected during the 
screening period before administration of XM22, at the end of study visit (day 21), and during the 
follow-up period at approximately180 days ±2 weeks (day 180) and 360 days ±2 weeks (day 360) 
after XM22 administration.  
Assays of antibody status were carried out under contract by CIRION BioPharma Research Inc., 
Canada. A report is submitted: 
Anti-drug antibodies were assayed for using electro-chemi-luminescent-bridging immunoassays on a 
platform from Meso Scale Diagnostics. 
A statement on compliance with requirements of GLP is provided.

The following strategy was used to detect antibodies: 
a. Screening assay: samples are screened for the presence or absence of potential anti-XM22 
antibodies. Screening assay is performed using purified rabbit anti-XM22 polyclonal antibodies as the 
positive control reagent from which positive controls at two levels are prepared. Samples with the ECL 
counts above or equal to the screening cut-point will be defined as screened positive, while samples 
with ECL count below the screening cut-point are defined as negative samples. 
b. Confirmatory assay: The specificity of the screened positive samples is confirmed by competition 
using unlabelled XM22. Samples with % inhibitions above or equal to the confirmatory cut-point are 
"confirmed positive" and are then subjected to titer determination, binding specificity characterization 
and NAb assays. The samples with % inhibitions that are below the confirmatory cut-point are 
"negative" and will require no further analysis. 
c. Titer Determination: The confirmed positive samples are serially diluted and analyzed to determine 
the relative amount of anti-XM22 antibodies present. A titer value is reported as the log-transformed 
dilution factor interpolated at the titer cut-point. 
d. Characterization assays: The confirmed positive samples are characterized to determine if the anti-
XM22 antibodies bind to XM21 (protein moiety of XM22) or cPEG (PEG moiety of XM22) via competition 
with XM21 and cPEG, respectively. Lastly, by competing with Granocyte® (lenograstim, licensed in the 
UK under PL 12185/0002), the glycosylated G-CSF that mimics the native (endogenous) G-CSF, the 
anti-XM22 antibodies are tested for their cross-reactivity / binding to the native G-CSF.

Neutralizing Antibody Assays 
This method is a qualitative cell-based assay with an evaluation of NFS-60 cell (mouse myelogenous 
leukemia cell line adapted to respond to recombinant G-CSF, provided by St. Jude Childrens’ Research 
Hospital, US) proliferation as the functional endpoint.  
Cell growth is stimulated at a fixed concentration of inducer (EC50, concentration of a drug that gives 
half-maximal response). The human serum samples are added to the assay medium and antibodies 
with a neutralizing activity will reduce cell proliferation, which is measured with the WST-1 reagent [2-
(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] as a chromogen. Statistically 
determined assay cut-points are used at the screening step to determine positivity. 
The assay initially screens for the presence of neutralizing antibodies against XM22 or Granocyte®. 
Each human serum samples is assayed under 3 conditions (i.e. in presence of XM22, in presence of 
Granocyte®, and no inducer). The screened positive samples undergo a mIL-3 (Mouse Interleukin 3) 
confirmatory test to determine whether the neutralizing activity is G-CSF-specific.  
• 
• 
• 
To be considered positive for neutralizing antibodies, a sample must neutralize the activity of 
XM22 and/or Granocyte® (positive screening result), must not induce cell growth in absence of 
inducer, and must not neutralize the activity of mIL-3 (negative confirmatory result). 
To be considered negative for neutralizing antibodies, a sample must not neutralize the activity 
of XM22 and/or Granocyte® (negative screening result) and must not induce cell growth in 
absence of inducer. 
If a sample induces cell growth in absence of inducer then it is considered as having an 
inconclusive result in the NAb assay.

The analysis cascade is presented in the following figure: 
CHMP’s comment: the assay strategy conforms to Guideline on immunogenicity assessment of 
biotechnology-derived therapeutic proteins, EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006, Dec 2007. This is 
acceptable. 
A validation exercise or validation summary was not found in submitted documents. The validation 
exercise is described as ‘on-going’.

Results 
Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor Use in the Follow-Up Period 
During the follow-up period patients were permitted to receive therapy with additional G-CSFs, at the 
discretion of the investigator during subsequent chemotherapy. Therapy with additional G-CSF 
consisted of filgrastim, lenograstim, and pegfilgrastim. Use of additional G-CSF therapy was reported in 
95.2% and 61.9% of patients at days 180 and 360 of the follow-up period, respectively. Results are 
summarised in the following table:

Immunogenicity 
Out of 21 patients enrolled in the study, only 1 patient in the 2 to <6 years group was observed to 
develop treatment-related ADA response. This patient was ADA-positive at day 180 after treatment 
with XM22 and several doses of commercial filgrastim. ADA titer was low (0.1) and ADA bound to PEG 
moiety, but neither to G-CSF moiety of XM22, nor to the native G-CSF. Moreover, ADA of this patient 
was not neutralizing. 
Four other patients were observed ADA-positive before XM22 treatment (screening time point), 
probably pre-existing ADA. Among these patients 2 had ADA-positive sample at the screening Time-
point only. ADA in these 2 patients was found to bind to both PEG and G-CSF moieties of XM22, and 
also to the native G-CSF. But these antibodies were not neutralizing. The remaining 2 patients 
[Commercially Confidential Information] were observed ADA-positive both before and after the 
treatment (which was at only 1 point after treatment at day 21 for patient [Commercially Confidential 
Information] and day 180 for patient [Commercially Confidential Information]). But ADA titers were 
reduced post-treatment. ADA of these 2 patients at both pre- and post-treatment time points bound to 
PEG moiety only. Although they were shown to be neutralizing, none of these patients experienced 
febrile or severe neutropenia. The neutralizing activity at screening did not negatively affect efficacy in 
these patients. 
Characterization of immunogenicity to XM22 will be evaluated further in study XM22-08. 
CHMP’s comment: A validation exercise or validation summary was not found in submitted 
documents. The validation exercise is described as ‘on-going’. The company does describe precision 
and accuracy in selected runs yet the tables of results are partially obscured by company logos. 
Because of this, results on immunogenicity are considered to be ‘of interest’ only. The company is 
advised to submit a substantive validation exercise for study XM22-08.

Survival 
The follow-up period for study XM22-07 was 360 days with visits on days 180 and 360. 
No patient was lost to follow-up during the follow-up period.  
On day 180 of the follow-up period, all patients were reported alive. 
Day 180 – 360: 
One male patient aged 4 years and receiving chemotherapy for metastatic embryonal 
rhabdomyosarcoma died owing to disease progression on 31 March 2015 before day 360 (he had 
received study drug on 26 April 2014, a narrative is provided). Death was judged by the investigator 
as being related to disease progression and not related to XM22. 
CHMP’s comment: the un-relatedness of the one reported death to study drug is accepted. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Results of follow-up to 360 days of the 21 subjects in study XM22-07 do not give rise to any particular 
concerns over either efficacy or safety of the current product in the population studied. 
The company is advised to submit a substantive validation exercise and summary of the antibody 
assays with submission of study XM22-08.

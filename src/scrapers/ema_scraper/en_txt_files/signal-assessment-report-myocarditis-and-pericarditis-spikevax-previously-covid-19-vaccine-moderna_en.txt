1.  Background 
COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna received a conditional marketing authorisation in the EU on 6 January 
2021 for active immunisation against COVID-19 in individuals 18 years of age and older. It contains 
mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles. The mRNA encodes for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein modified with 2 proline substitutions within the heptad repeat 1 domain (S-2P) to stabilise the 
spike protein into a prefusion conformation. 
Myocarditis, also known as inflammatory cardiomyopathy, is inflammation of the heart muscle. 
Symptoms can include shortness of breath, chest pain, decreased ability to exercise, and an irregular 
heartbeat. The duration of problems can vary from hours to months. Complications may include heart 
failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy or cardiac arrest. On 30 May, Brighton Collaboration issued an 
interim case definition for myocarditis, available from the link: 
https://brightoncollaboration.us/myocarditis-case-definition-update/. 
Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium (the fibrous sac surrounding the heart). Symptoms 
typically include sudden onset of sharp chest pain, which may also be felt in the shoulders, neck, or 
back. The pain is typically less severe when sitting up and more severe when lying down or breathing 
deeply.  
2.  Initial evidence 
2.1.  Signal validation  
As of 26 May 2021, in Eudravigilance were received 16 cases in the combined search for HLT Infectious 
myocarditis and HLT Non-infectious myocarditis in the EEA. Out of these cases, 69% were in males. 
There were no fatal cases. The median age of the vaccinees was 26 years. 
There were 9 EEA case reports of myocarditis with COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna in people under 30 
years old. Six patients were males, 3 were females. 3 cases were from Germany, 1 from France, 1 
from Italy, 1 from Lithuania, 1 from The Netherlands, 1 from Spain and 1 from Sweden. The 9 cases 
were matched to the latest Brighton Collaboration criteria for myocarditis [1, 2]. 6 cases were assessed 
as level 1-3 and 3 as level 4-5. In 4 cases event occurred after the first dose, in 3 – after the 2nd 
dose. There was 1 case mentioning biopsy in case narrative (“Diagnosis by laboratory, ECG, 
echocardiography, cardio-MRI, and myocardial biopsy” – but no more details provided). In 2 cases 
patients had medical history of Covid-19 infection which could be considerate as a potential 
confounder. 
An Observed/Expected analysis was performed on different risk periods: 14d and 42d. Cases where 
TTO > 42 days were excluded from OE analysis. Cases where TTO was missing were assigned to the 
shortest risk period. 
The Incidence rates for myocarditis only were obtained from IMRD UK (primary care healthcare 
records), noting the following. The myocarditis diagnosis is likely to be made in secondary care, so 
there is a risk of underreporting in primary care records. Rates from ACCESS databases that include 
both primary and secondary care are for myocarditis and pericarditis combined, hence they couldn’t be 
used. Sensitivity analysis with rates from IMS France, which provides a higher estimate of the risk in 
the younger population (in males ~10/100,000 vs ~5/100,000 of IMRD UK).

COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna)  
EMA/PRAC/326194/2021 
Page 5/121 
 
 
 
 
 
Exposure data: age stratification from ECDC (up to 16 May), gender distribution from MSs end of April 
2021. Observed cases from EV: HLT Infectious myocarditis and HLT Noninfectious myocarditis (incl. 
myopericarditis). 
The results showed an elevated OE ratio (> 5) in the male 18-24 age group, statistically significant. 
The OE ratio was > 1 in the male 25-49 age group. In the female 18-24 age group, OE ratio was > 1. 
Similar conclusions were drawn from the sensitivity analysis (using higher incidence rates IMS-FR -> 
higher expected number of cases; OE ratio > 2.5 in male 18-24). 
Caveats of the analysis: The OE analysis should be treated as a tool for signal detection rather than 
signal validation; the comparison of EV event rates with those observed in healthcare records should 
be interpreted cautiously, for contextualisation only; the extent of underreporting in EV is not known; 
As 18 -24 is a smaller age group, with a more limited number of doses received, it is more susceptible 
to extreme results. 
Taking into consideration the above initial evidence of myocarditis, with cases revealing a plausible 
temporal association to COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna, it is considered that the signal deserves further 
assessment. It is suggested that the MAH for COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna (Moderna Biotech Spain, 
S.L.) should provide answers to a LoQ on myocarditis and pericarditis. The MAH should discuss the 
need to update the product information and risk management plan and submit proposals as 
appropriate.

2.2.  Signal confirmation  
The search in EVDAS performed on the 26 May 2021, identified 16 cases related to myocarditis. 6 of 
these cases were assessed as level 1-3 (definitive/probable/possible case of diagnostic certainty) 
according to the latest Brighton Collaboration criteria for myocarditis. The O/E analysis showed an 
elevated O/E ratio (>5) in the male 18-24 age group that were statistically significant.  
In the 4th monthly safety report for the Moderna vaccine, there were identified 4 WHO possible cases 
and 1 WHO probable case for myocarditis and 9 WHO possible cases for pericarditis. However, the 
myocarditis cases were not assessed by the Brighton case definition for myocarditis. Furthermore, in 
the age- and gender stratified O/E analyses for the myocarditis events, the observed rates were close to 
equal or slightly above the expected rates for in males aged 18-29 and males aged 30-39 (rate ratio 
0.73 when comparing to the low background IRs. This could indicate a potential increased risk in these 
populations, as some degree of underreporting is likely (Please refer to Annex 1 for the assessment of 
myocarditis and pericarditis in the 4th MSSR for Moderna). 
Considering the above signal description and the available evidence from the 4th monthly safety report 
for Moderna, the signal needs further evaluation. The signal is confirmed. 
2.3.  Proposed recommendation 
The MAH (Moderna) is requested to provide separate analysis of myocarditis and pericarditis as described 
in the LoQs below.

Myocarditis LoQ 
The MAH should provide a cumulative review of all cases of myocarditis and cases reporting both 
myocarditis and pericarditis (from all sources). The review should include case ascertainment (as per 
Brighton collaboration case definition), diagnostic work-up, causality assessment and outcome of the 
events (e.g. hospitalization, life-threatening, or death) for each case report. The MAH should ensure 
that all relevant cases are processed (not in backlog) and included in the review. The MAH should use 
a DLP as recent as possible, but at least up to 31st May 2021. 
The review should include the following: 
  A tabulated overview of all cases; stratified by  
o  Age, by 10-year strata (10-19, 20-29, …) 
o  Gender 
o  Time to onset (TTO) 
o  Dose (1st or 2nd) 
o  WHO-UMC causality 
o  Brighton collaboration case definition 
(https://brightoncollaboration.us/myocarditis-case-definition-update/): 
Definitive/Probable/Possible  
  For the causality assessment of the cumulative cases, the MAH is requested to present the 
following: 
•  A summary overview of the cases for which the causality (as per WHO-UMC causality 
assessment system) is considered at least WHO Possible or WHO Probable. The summary 
overview should include the following details for each case:  
o  Case ID (Eudravigilance no. if possible)  
o  Age/gender  
o  TTO, and whether following 1st dose/2nd dose  
o  Associated clinical signs/co-reported PTs.  
o  Brighton collaboration case definition: Definitive/Probable/Possible 
o  Any underlying condition(s) (including COVID-19), other medical confounders or 
risk factors present (including latency/TTO as applicable)   
o  Confounding medications (including latency/TTO as applicable)   
o  Outcome  
o  WHO-UMC causality assessment   
• 
The cases with an “Unlikely” WHO-UMC causal association in a tabulated format. The table 
should include, but not restricted to, the following information for each case:  
o  Case ID (Eudravigilance no. if possible)  
o  Age/gender  
o  TTO, and whether following 1st dose/2nd dose

o  Confounding medications (including latency/TTO as applicable)   
o  Outcome 
  The review should explore possible risk factors, taking into account the gender, age, and dose 
distribution of reported cases. Specifically, the MAH is requested to comment on the number of 
cases occurring after the 2nd dose as compared to the 1st dose, also considering the differences in 
exposure for these two groups. The MAH should discuss whether any patterns or trends can be 
identified concerning risk factors. 
  Specific O/E analyses should be performed for the 1st dose and 2nd dose receivers respectively. 
Thus, for the cumulative review, O/E analyses should be stratified by age, gender and dose (1st or 
2nd). For the analyses, the MAH should clearly state and justify the background rates used. The 
MAH should retrieve the most relevant background rates and take the source of the cases into 
consideration. Several risk windows should be considered (eg. 7, 14 and 21 days). In the O/E 
analysis, the MAH is requested to perform adjustment for underreporting, backlog of case handling 
and sensitivity analysis. 
  The MAH should further evaluate and discuss potential mechanisms:  
• 
• 
• 
The MAH should consider multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) as an alternative 
etiology upon evaluation of the myocarditis cases. The MAH should discuss the 
immunologic mechanism of multisystem inflammatory syndromes (MIS)-induced 
myocarditis following COVID-19, and if any parallels can be drawn to the immunologic 
reactions following vaccination.  
The MAH should review the published literature, and present and discuss relevant 
publications concerning plausible mechanisms of myocarditis following the vaccination, 
concerning both COVID-19 vaccine Moderna and vaccines in general. 
The MAH is requested to comment and discuss the potential mechanism of vaccine 
triggered autoimmune reaction as hypothesized by Garcia et al. in a literature case report 
concerning a case of myocarditis after 2nd dose in a 39-year-old male physician with a 
past medical history of auto-immune conditions. (Bautista García J,et al.Acute myocarditis 
after administration of theBNT162b2 vaccine against COVID-19. Rev Esp Cardiol. 2021. 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rec.2021.04.005) 
 
In conclusion, the MAH should discuss the need to update the product information and risk 
management plan, including relevant risk minimisation measures. 
Pericarditis LoQ 
The MAH should provide a cumulative review of all cases of pericarditis (from all sources). The review 
should include case ascertainment, diagnostic work-up, causality assessment and outcome of the 
events (e.g. hospitalization, life-threatening, or death) for each case report. The MAH should ensure 
that all relevant cases are processed (not in backlog) and included in the review. The MAH should use

triggered autoimmune reaction as hypothesized by Garcia et al. in a literature case report 
concerning a case of myocarditis after 2nd dose in a 39-year-old male physician with a 
past medical history of auto-immune conditions. (Bautista García J,et al. Acute myocarditis 
after administration of theBNT162b2 vaccine against COVID-19. Rev Esp Cardiol. 2021. 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rec.2021.04.005) 
6. In conclusion, the MAH should discuss the need to update the product information and risk 
management plan, including relevant risk minimisation measures. 
List of questions for pericarditis  
The MAH should provide a cumulative review of all cases of pericarditis (from all sources). The review 
should include case ascertainment, diagnostic work-up, causality assessment and outcome of the 
events (e.g. hospitalization, life-threatening, or death) for each case report. The MAH should ensure 
that all relevant cases are processed (not in backlog) and included in the review. The MAH should use 
a DLP as recent as possible, but at least up to 31st May 2021. 
The review should include the following: 
1. A tabulated overview of all cases; stratified by  
o  Age, by strata of 12–15, 16–19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-39, and thereafter 10 years 
intervals  
o  Gender 
o  Time to onset (TTO) 
o  Dose (1st or 2nd) 
o  WHO-UMC causality 
2. For the causality assessment of the cumulative cases, the MAH is requested to present the 
following: 
•  A summary overview of the cases: 1) for which the causality (as per WHO-UMC causality 
assessment system) is considered at least WHO Possible or WHO Probable. The summary 
overview should include the following details for each case:  
o  Case ID (Eudravigilance no. if possible)  
o  Age/gender  
o  TTO, and whether following 1st dose/2nd dose  
o  Associated clinical signs/co-reported PTs.  
o  Any underlying condition(s) (e.g. specific medical history such as autoimmune 
diseases, previous COVID-19 disease, etc.), other medical confounders or risk 
factors present (including latency/TTO as applicable)   
o  Confounding medications (including latency/TTO as applicable)   
o  Outcome

o  WHO-UMC causality assessment   
• 
The cases with an “Unlikely” WHO-UMC causal association in a tabulated format. The table 
should include, but not restricted to, the following information for each case:  
o  Case ID (Eudravigilance no. if possible)  
o  Age/gender  
o  TTO, and whether following 1st dose/2nd dose 
o  Any underlying condition(s) (including COVID-19), other medical confounders or 
risk factors present (including latency/TTO as applicable)    
o  Confounding medications (including latency/TTO as applicable)   
o  Outcome 
3. The review should explore possible risk factors, taking into account the gender, age, and dose 
distribution of reported cases. Specifically, the MAH is requested to comment on the number of cases 
occurring after the 2nd dose as compared to the 1st dose, also considering the differences in exposure 
for these two groups. The MAH should discuss whether any patterns or trends can be identified 
concerning risk factors. 
4. Specific O/E analyses should be performed for the 1st dose and 2nd dose receivers respectively. Thus, 
for the cumulative review, O/E analyses should be stratified by age, gender and dose (1st or 2nd). For 
the analyses, the MAH should clearly state and justify the background rates used. The MAH should 
retrieve the most relevant background rates and take the source of the cases into consideration. 
Several risk windows should be considered (14 and 21 days). In the O/E analysis, the MAH is 
requested to perform adjustment for underreporting, backlog of case handling and sensitivity analysis. 
5. The MAH should further evaluate and discuss potential mechanisms:  
• 
• 
The MAH should consider multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) as an alternative 
etiology upon evaluation of the pericarditis cases. The MAH should discuss the 
immunologic mechanism of multisystem inflammatory syndromes (MIS)-induced 
pericarditis following COVID-19, and if any parallels can be drawn to the immunologic 
reactions following vaccination.  
The MAH should review the published literature, and present and discuss relevant 
publications concerning plausible mechanisms of pericarditis following the vaccination, 
concerning both COVID-19 vaccine Moderna and vaccines in general. 
6. In conclusion, the MAH should discuss the need to update the product information and risk 
management plan, including relevant risk minimisation measures. 
The PRAC will assess the MAH’s answers to this List of questions within an accelerated timetable, which 
would allow for the following PRAC discussion to take place in July 2021 PRAC.  
3.  Additional evidence  
Additional evidence was received in response to the adopted PRAC recommendation and request for 
information. 
Below, a summary of the responses from the MAH is presented.  
The terminology in this part of the assessment report will follow the terminology used in the submitted 
material, and the name: COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna (and not Spikevax) will be used.

3.1.  Assessment of additional data  
3.1.1.  ITEM 1 - MYOCARDITIS 
The MAH  should provide a cumulative  review  of  all cases  of myocarditis and  cases  reporting  both 
myocarditis and pericarditis (from all sources). The review should include case  ascertainment (as per 
Brighton collaboration case definition), diagnostic work-up, causality  assessment and outcome of the 
events  (e.g.  hospitalization,  life-threatening,  or  death)  for  each  case  report.  The  MAH  should 
ensure  that  all  relevant  cases  are  processed  (not  in  backlog) and included in the review. The MAH 
should use an OLP as recent as possible, but  at least up to 31st  May 2021. 
The review should include the following: 
A tabulated overview of all cases; stratified by 
•  Age, by strata of 12-15, 16-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-39, and thereafter 10 years intervals

Sponsor Response: 
As of the end of the reporting period (31 May 2021), a total of 250,275,820 doses of the  Moderna 
COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine had been distributed to 39 countries, with a majority  (201,078,720) 
distributed in the US. As of the end of the reporting period, a total of 155,522,108  doses of the vaccine 
had been administered, based on information retrieved through the US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data- tracker/#vaccinations), the European Centres for 
Disease Control (https://qap.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/vaccine-

(https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) (data retrieved on 01  June 2021. 
The company clinical database and the global safety database were queried for valid, clinical and 
spontaneous case reports received from HCP, HA, consumers and literature, cumulative from 18 
December 2020 to 31 May 2021, worldwide, reported for the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna  COVID-
19 vaccine Moderna) using the following Preferred Terms (PTs): “Viral pericarditis;  Pericarditis; 
Pericarditis infective; Myocarditis; Myocarditis septic; Myocarditis infectious;  Viral 
myocarditis; and Myocarditis post-infection”. The clinical trial data is from the Phase 3  clinical 
trial mRNA- 1273 P301. As of 31 May 2021, there have been 250,275,820 doses of the  mRNA vaccine 
distributed worldwide. 
a.   Clinical Trials information 
During the Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial of the mRNA-1273 P301, in the safety set, up to 28 days  after 
any vaccination, there were 15,184 participants exposed to the mRNA-1273 vaccine, and  15,166 
participants in the placebo arm. There were 6,823 (22.5%) unsolicited treatment-  emergent adverse 
event (TEAEs) reported, 3,234 (21.3%) in the placebo arm, and 3,589 (23.6%)  in the mRNA vaccine 
arm. There were no reported TEAEs of “Myocarditis” in P301. There were  three (3) unsolicited TEAE 
of “Pericarditis” reported in P301; two TEAEs in the Placebo arm,  and one in the Vaccine arm of the

safety set in the overall stage after any injection. The 2 events  in the placebo arm were reported in 
the >18 to <65 years of age, and the event in the vaccination  arm was reported in the >65 years of 
age group (Table 1 of the MAH response). 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment: 
In the phase 3 clinical trial, P301, there were no reported TEAEs of myocarditis, and 3 reports of 
pericarditis; two TEAEs in the Placebo arm,  and one in the Vaccine arm. 
b.   Global Safety Database information: Myocarditis and Myocarditis/Pericarditis 
(Myo/Pericarditis) Cases 
The company global safety database was queried for spontaneous, valid, case reports received 
from HCP, HA, literature, and consumers, cumulatively (18 December 2020 to 31 May 2021), 
worldwide, using the PTs of “Viral pericarditis; Pericarditis; Pericarditis infective; 
Myocarditis; Myocarditis septic; Myocarditis infectious; Viral myocarditis; and Myocarditis 
post-infection”. 
A review of the spontaneous reports from the company’s global safety identified 77 case reports  with 
the PTs of Myocarditis  or  both Myocarditis  and  Pericarditis.  All  of  the aforementioned  reports  were 
considered serious reports. Most of the reports (68.8%) involved persons under age 40 years,  27.3% 
were patients >40 years of age, and 3.9% the information was missing (See Table 2).

PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The MAH has used a DLP up to 31 May 2021. The search strategy is similar to the prior search 
presented in MSSR 4 “Viral pericarditis; Pericarditis; Pericarditis infective; Myocarditis; Myocarditis 
septic; Myocarditis infectious; Viral myocarditis; and Myocarditis post-infection”  
Signal assessment report on myocarditis and pericarditis with Spikevax (previously 
COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna)  
EMA/PRAC/326194/2021 
Page 16/121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A search on all myocarditis and pericarditis related PT’s was made in Eudravigilance confirmed that the 
search strategy was sufficient in terms of retrieving all relevant myocarditis cases, since all cases up to 
DLP 31 May 2021 were coded with the PT ‘myocarditis’. In regard to the pericarditis cases, a small 
number of cases were coded with different PT’s than included in the above-mentioned search strategy, 
for the PT’s ‘Pericarditis constrictive’ and ‘Pleuropericarditis’ 2 and 3 cases were identified, respectively.  
Furthermore, a search was made in Eudravigilance to identify the number of cases of myocarditis and 
pericarditis reported after DLP (31/5-21). This revealed an increase in reported cases from 73 to 152 
cases of pericarditis in the interval from DLP up to 24 June 2021 and from 74 to 197 cases of 
myocarditis in the same interval, possibly due to enhanced reporting due to media attention.  
The MAH has identified 77 case reports with the PTs Myocarditis or both Myocarditis and Pericarditis. 
Most of the reports (68.8%) involved persons under age 40 years, and 35% of cases were patients 
under the age of 25. This should be held up against the administration of the vaccine in this age 
group, which in the last MSSR was, estimated to be 11.6% in the age group <25 in the US, and only 
2.8% of the same age group in EU/EEA. It is acknowledged that the incidence of myocarditis in the 
background differ between age groups, which is further taken into consideration in the age stratified 
O/E analyses (section 3.1.4) 
The majority of cases were in men (75%). Myocarditis is more commonly reported in men, which is 
further discussed by the MAH in section 3.1.3, however this risk factor is also taken into account in the 
O/E analyses stratified into age and sex.  
The cases are further characterized by a short TTO; 63% of the cases had a reported event onset 
within 3 days post vaccination.  
Importantly, the majority of cases were reported after the 2nd dose; 53% compared to 35% of 1st dose 
(12% unknown). This is further discussed in section 3.1.3 and 3.1.4. 
3.1.2.  ITEM 2 – causality assessment 
For the causality assessment of the cumulative cases, the MAH is requested to present the 
following: 
A summary overview of the cases for which the causality (as per WHO-UMC causality  assessment 
system)  is  considered  at  least  WHO  Possible  or  WHO  Probable.  The  summary overview should 
include the following details for each case: 
•  Case ID (Eudravigilance no. if possible) 
•  Age/gender 
•  TTO, and whether following pt dose/2nd dose 
•  Associated clinical signs/co-reported PTs. 
•  Brighton collaboration case definition: Definitive/Probable/Possible 
•  Any  underlying  condition(s)  (e.g.  specific  medical  history  such  as  autoimmune  diseases, 
previous  COVID-19  disease),  other  medical  confounders  or  risk  factors  present (including 
latency/TTO as applicable) 
•  Confounding medications (including latency/TIO as applicable) 
•  Outcome 
•  WHO-UMC causality assessment

Sponsor Response: 
The sponsor conducted and evaluation of all the cases identified as cases of Myocarditis and/or 
Myo/Pericarditis according to the PRAC’s recommendation (See Table 6 (Annex II of this report)), 
utilizing the WHO-UMC causality assessment (which allow to perform a combined assessment of the 
reported cases  taking into account the clinical-pharmacological aspects of the case history and the 
quality of the  documentation of the observation)[1] and the newly developed DRAFT Myocarditis 
Brighton  Collaboration case definition (30 May 2021) which allows classification of the cases on 
whether  or not they are true cases of Myocarditis. It is important to define that the WHO-UMC 
causality  assessment and the Brighton Collaboration case definitions provide different classification of 
cases reported to the MAH, the first by assessing causality, and the second one by identifying 
clinically if this is a true case of myocarditis or not (which is separate from causality assessment). 
Based on the assessment conducted on the 77 cases reporting both Myocarditis or  Myo/Pericarditis 
PTs, there were 20 reports that were classified as “Possible” according to the  WHO-UMC causality 
assessment (Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time  relationship to drug 
intake; could also be explained by disease or other drugs; information on  drug withdrawal may be 
lacking or unclear). Out of those 20 reports, according to the  Myocarditis Brighton case definition, 
there were 2 classified as Level 1 (Definitive case); 12  classified as Level 2 (Probable case); and 6 
were classified as Level 4 (a reported event of  myocarditis with insufficient evidence to meet level 
1,2 or 3 of the case definition). 
The MAH considers that because 1) there are no pathognomonic findings that are indicative of  certain 
vaccine causality of myocarditis or pericarditis; 2) there exists a background incidence of  these illnesses 
that pre-dated mRNA-1273 and would be expected to occur independent of vaccine  exposure,  and  3) 
it  has  not  been  proven  that  immunization  with  mRNA-1273  or  any  mRNA  vaccine  can  cause 
myocarditis  or  pericarditis,  no  cases  were  classified  as  certain  or  probable  according to the WHO-
UMC causality assessment. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
As requested, the MAH has evaluated all cases identified as myocarditis and/or myo/pericarditis, utilizing 
the WHO- UMC causality assessment and the newly developed DRAFT Myocarditis Brighton Collaboration 
case definition (BC) (30 May 2021).  
20  cases  were  considered  WHO  Possible  causality  by  the  MAH.  Of  these,  2  classified  as  BC  Level  1 
(Definitive case) and 12 classified as BC Level 2 (Probable case). No case narratives were provided.  
A causality assessment was performed of the cases that were classified by the MAH as WHO Possible 
and myocarditis Brighton definition 1-2. The assessment included 14 cases where a full case narrative 
could be retrieved from Eudravigilance. 
The cases comprised 13 males and 1 female aged 18-50 years of age (stratified by decades there was 
one aged 10-19 years, 7 were 20-29 ys, 2 aged 30-39 ys, 3 aged 40-49 ys, and 1 aged 50-59 ys).  
Most were diagnostically well-supported with 5 cases Brighton level 1, 7 cases Brighton level 2, one case 
level 4 and one level 5. 
Regarding causality to the vaccination, 7 cases are considered WHO Probable, 3 cases WHO Possible, 2 
are  found WHO  Unlikely, and  2 cases  are  unclassifiable due  to  other  health conditions.  The  10 WHO 
Probable/Possible cases are all on males aged 18-50 years of age. 
In 12 of the 14 cases, myocarditis was diagnosed 1-4 days after receiving the 2nd dose of the COVID-
19-vaccine  Moderna;  two  cases  were  reported  after  the  1st  dose.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  cases 
reported  after  the  1st  dose  are  evaluated  as  Brighton  4-5  and  WHO-UMC  unlikely.  Therefore,  the 
assessment of these 14 cases in conclusion indicate an association between COVID-19-vaccine Moderna 
and myocarditis, with perceived symptoms and clinical findings within the first week after receiving the 
2nd dose.

Looking  at  the  outcome  of  the  myocarditis  events,  none  of  them  were  fatal,  4  were  recovered  or 
recovering at the time of reporting the suspected adverse event, 6 were not yet recovered, and for 4 the 
outcome of the event was reported as unknown. Comparing to the nature of myocarditis there is no 
indication so far that myocarditis as a possible side effect to the vaccine should have a more severe 
course than otherwise seen.  
Although the positive cases all represent males this is not sufficient to indicate a gender difference in 
myocarditis after immunization.    
In two cases considered WHO Possible, the patients had co-reported pericarditis and pericardial effusion. 
The cases considered WHO Probable or Possible are presented shortly below: 
7 cases considered WHO Probable:  
Case 1 
Myocarditis  
A 50-59 year old healthy male who the day after receiving the 2nd dose of covid-19-vaccine experienced 
fever  and  rigoring  compatible  with  known  general  side  effects  to  the  vaccine;  the  close  temporal 
association to the immunization and no other symptoms indicating infection taken into account. 
On the second day after receiving the 2nd dose he experienced chest pain and increased biomarker level 
(TnT) was demonstrated. ECG, ECHO and angiography were performed, these were non-pathological.  
There was no known risk-factors, and the fever and rigoring were attributable to general side effects.   
-Therefore, based on the cardiac symptoms and increased biomarker concentration this is a myocarditis 
Brighton level 2 (probable).  
-Based on laboratory test abnormality, a short and reasonable time relationship to the 2nd immunization, 
unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs as the man is otherwise healthy, this case is WHO-
UMC Probable. 
Case 2 
Myocarditis 
A 40-49 year old male who on the third day after receiving the 2nd dose of covid-19-vaccine experienced 
chest discomfort, increased biomarker level (Tn, unspecified if TnT or TnI) was demonstrated, and ECG 
showed diffuse ST-elevations. Furthermore, ECHO and angiography were performed, these were non-
pathological.  
No medical history was reported.   
-Based on the cardiac symptoms, increased biomarker concentration and ST-elevations in ECG and no 
indication of other etiology, this is a myocarditis Brighton level 2 (probable).  
-Based on laboratory test abnormality, a short and reasonable time relationship to the 2nd immunization, 
unlikely to be attributed to other etiology, this case is WHO-UMC: Probable. 
Case 3 
Myocarditis 
A 18-29 year old male who the day after receiving the 2nd dose of covid-19-vaccine experienced chest 
pain and dyspnoea; increased biomarker level (TnI) was demonstrated, and ECG showed ST depressions 
in some leads and elevations in others.  
There is no information on ECHO nor angiography, and no medical history was reported.   
-Based on the cardiac symptoms, increased biomarker concentration and ST-abnormalities ECG and no 
indication of other etiology, this is a myocarditis Brighton level 2 (probable).  
-Based  on  laboratory  test  abnormality,  the  short  and  reasonable  time  relationship  to  the  2nd 
immunization, and considered unlikely to be attributed to other disease in this young man despite no 
medical history reported. WHO-UMC: Probable.

Case 4 
Myocarditis 
A 18-29 year old male who on the second day after receiving the 2nd dose experienced chest pain and 
increased  biomarker  levels  (Tn,  unspecified  if  TnT  or  TnI)  were  demonstrated.  Cardiac  magnetic 
resonance scan was performed and gave rise to the diagnosis perimyocarditis. Furthermore, ECG and 
CT scan were performed but results are not provided. There was no known risk-factors. 
The patient has Penicillin allergy. 
-As the specific results of the cardiac magnetic resonance scan are not reported, the causality association 
is primarily based on the cardiac symptoms and increased biomarker concentrations and the temporal 
relationship leading to this a myocarditis Brighton level 2 (probable).  
-Based on laboratory test abnormality, a short and reasonable time relationship to the 2nd immunization, 
unlikely to be attributed to other etiology, this case is WHO-UMC: Probable. 
Case 5 
Myocarditis 
A 30-39 year old male who on the third day after receiving the 2nd dose of covid-19-vaccine experienced 
chest  pain  and  increased  biomarker  level  (Tn,  unspecified  if  TnT  or  TnI)  was  demonstrated.  Acute 
coronary syndrome was excluded. There is no available information on ECG, ECHO nor angiography.    
The patient has food allergies 
-Based  on  the  cardiac  symptoms  and  increased  biomarker  concentration  and  no  indication  of  other 
etiology, this is a myocarditis Brighton level 2 (probable).  
-Based on laboratory test abnormality, a short and reasonable time relationship to the 2nd immunization, 
and based on the available information unlikely to be attributed to other etiology, this case is WHO-UMC: 
Probable. 
Case 6 
Myocarditis 
A 18-29 year old healthy male who the day after receiving the 2nd dose of covid-19-vaccine experienced 
fever, chills and myalgia compatible with known general side effects to the vaccine; the close temporal 
association to the immunization and no other symptoms indicating infection taken into account. 
Also, on the day after receiving the 2nd dose he experienced chest pain and increased biomarker level 
(Tn, unspecified if TnT or TnI) was demonstrated. ECG showed ST-abnormalities, ST-elevations included, 
and myocardial inflammation was confirmed by both ECHO and by thoracic CT scan.  
There  was  no known  risk-factors, and  the  fever,  chills  and myalgia  were attributable  to general  side

-Based on the abnormal ECHO and increased biomarker concentration this is a myocarditis Brighton level 
1 (definite).  
-Based on laboratory test abnormality, a short and reasonable time relationship to the 2nd immunization, 
unlikely to be attributed to other etiology, this case is WHO-UMC: Probable. 
Case 7 
Myocarditis 
A 18-29 year old male who four days after receiving the 2nd dose of covid-19-vaccine experienced chest 
pain. Cardiac magnetic resonance scan is described in detail and compatible with myocarditis. 
He was broadly tested microbiologically for infections; all tests were negative including SARS-CoV-2.   
There is no information on biomarkers, ECG, ECHO or angiography.   
The patient has food allergies (eggs, peanuts, nuts). 
-Based  on  the  cardiac  symptoms  and  the  abnormal  cardiac  MRI  this  is  considered  equivalent  to  a 
myocarditis Brighton level 2 (probable).  
-Based on the event with cardiac symptoms and MRI supported diagnosis, the short and reasonable time 
relationship to the 2nd immunization, and unlikely to be attributed to other etiology, this case is WHO-
UMC: Probable.

3 cases considered WHO Possible: 
Case 1 
Myocarditis 
A 18-29 year old male who four days after receiving the 2nd dose of covid-19-vaccine experienced chest 
pain, increased biomarker level (TnI) was demonstrated, and ECG showed non-specific ST abnormalities. 
Chest X-ray was normal. ECHO and angiography were not reported.  
Medical history included teratoma. 
-Based on the cardiac symptoms and increased biomarker concentration this is a myocarditis Brighton 
level 2 (probable). 
-Based on the laboratory test abnormality, the reasonable time relationship to immunization, but that 
the condition could have other causes this is WHO-UMC: Possible. 
Case 2 
Myocarditis 
A  18-29  year  old  male  who  on  the  second  day  after  receiving  the  2nd  dose  of  covid-19-vaccine 
experienced headache, musculoskeletal stiffness and pain in extremities compatible with known general 
side effects to the vaccine; the close temporal association to the immunization taken into account.  
On  the  same  day  he  also  experienced  chest  pain,  and  increased  biomarker  level  (Troponin)  was 
demonstrated. ECHO was performed and proved decreased ejection fraction; and ECG was reported as 
abnormal although unspecified how. 
No medical history was reported. 
-Based  on  the  increased  biomarker  concentration  and  the  ECHO  demonstrated  decreased  injection 
fraction this is a myocarditis Brighton level 1 (definit).  
-Based on the laboratory test abnormality, the reasonable time relationship to immunization, but that 
the condition could have other causes as no medical history is reported, this is WHO-UMC: Possible. 
Case 3 
Myocarditis 
An  18-29  year  old  male  who  on  the  second  day  after  receiving  the  2nd  dose  of  covid-19-vaccine 
experienced  chest  pain  and  increased  biomarker  level  (TnI)  was  demonstrated.  ECG  showed  ST-
abnormalities with diffuse ST-elevations, ECHO showed decreased ejection fraction and slight pericardial 
effusion,  while  cardiac  magnetic  resonance  scan  with  findings  consistent  with  myocarditis  and  not 
ischemia.   
No medical history was reported. 
-Based on the abnormal ECHO and increased biomarker concentration this is a myocarditis Brighton level

Sponsor Response: 
Out of the 77 cases reporting both Myocarditis or Myo/Pericarditis PTs, there were 17 reports that were 
classified as “Unlikely”  according to the WHO-UMC causality assessment (Event or laboratory test 
abnormality, with a time to drug intake that makes a relationship improbable (but not impossible); 
Disease or other drugs provide plausible explanations). Out of those 17  reports, according to the 
Myocarditis Brighton case definition, there were 3 classified as Level 1 (Definitive case); 5 classified as 
Level 2 (Probable case); 1 was classified as Level 3 (Possible case); and 8 were classified as Level 4 (a 
reported event of myocarditis  with insufficient evidence to meet level 1,2 or 3 of the case definition). 
(See Table 7 Annex III of this report) 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment:  
The MAH has listed the cases that were considered WHO Unlikely in a tabulated format. It is not clear 
from the presentation on which basis the cases were considered unlikely. For case 2 a causality “unlikely” 
is questioned based on the information presented, considering that nothing is reported under medical 
history and medications. Similar applies for case 15 and 9 in which nothing is reported in medical history 
and  comedication  includes  drugs  for  which  cardiac  disease  (myocardial  ischemia)  is  listed  but  not 
myocarditis.  
3.1.3.  ITEM 3 – risk factors / Myocarditis 
The review should explore possible risk factors, taking into account the gender, age, and dose 
distribution of reported cases. Specifically, the MAH is requested to comment on the number 
of  cases  occurring  after  the  2nd  dose  as  compared  to  the  1st  dose,  also  considering  the 
differences in exposure for these two groups. The MAH should discuss whether any patterns 
or trends can be identified concerning risk factors. 
Sponsor Response: 
Myocarditis is an under-diagnosed cardiac disease resulting from any one of a broad range of 
infectious, immune, and toxic causes.  In many cases, the etiology is not conclusively determined. 
Most cases of myocarditis are caused by infectious agents, toxic substances, drugs or  autoimmune 
disorders. Hence, it is increasingly recognized that myocarditis is an inflammatory  condition of the 
myocardium triggered by various factors rather than a distinct cardiovascular  disease. Infectious 
causes include viruses, bacteria, Chlamydia, rickettsia, fungi, and protozoa. 
Noninfectious triggers have been identified such as toxins, autoimmune disease and  hypersensitive 
reactions. Numerous medications like antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine), antibiotics  (penicillin, 
ampicillin, sulfonamides, tetracyclines), and antiphlogistic (e.g., mesalamine) can  induce 
hypersensitivity eosinophilic myocarditis. Myocarditis has been reported following many  different 
vaccines including flu vaccine, however the smallpox vaccine has the strongest  association. During 
the influenza epidemic of the winter 1998-1999 there were several reports of  patients who had 
preceding flu-like symptoms and fever and developed cardiac involvement  between 4 and 7 days 
after the onset of influenza symptoms.

Viral myocarditis is thought to be the most frequent type, mostly affecting children and young 
adults[2]. A recent study using International Classification of Diseases codes estimated the global 
prevalence of myocarditis to be ≈22 of 100 000 patients annually. Approximately 1% to 5% of 
patients that test positive for acute viral infection(s) may exhibit a form of myocarditis. 
Nowadays, the prevalence of myocarditis has been reported from 10.2 to 105.6 per 100,000 
worldwide, and its annual occurrence is estimated at about 1.8 million cases. The incidence of 
confirmed myocarditis secondary to smallpox vaccination was estimated to be 16.1 per 100 000 
service members, with a recent Department of Defense study estimating 12 per 100 000 in a review 
of 730 000 service members. Most studies of acute myocarditis report a greater prevalence and 
severity in male patients, speculated to be caused by a protective effect of natural hormonal 
influences on immune responses in women when compared with men. Patients are usually between 
the ages of 20 and 50. Acute myocarditis and hyperthyroidism are also common diseases that often 
present in young, otherwise healthy patients. Autoimmunity is central to the pathogenesis of both[3]. 
When assessing whether a vaccine is potentially associated with myocarditis, it is useful to  consider 
whether myocarditis is caused by the infection that the vaccine is intended to prevent.  Various 
viruses have been associated with myocarditis and are believed to have different  pathophysiological 
mechanisms, probably related to their different tropisms.  Some viruses have  primary cardiotropism, 
such as Coxsackie A and B viruses or echoviruses.  Other viruses are  vasculotropic, such as 
parvovirus B19.  Yet others are lymphotropic, such as HHV6, EBV and  CMV.  Some viruses are 
believed to induce cardiac inflammation through activation of the  immune system, such as HIV, HCV 
and influenza A and B.  By far the highest documented  incidence of myocarditis following 
immunization is with smallpox vaccine 
(https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118283); however, it is 
important to note that smallpox vaccine is fundamentally different than mRNA-1273, not only  with 
respect to the target, but also because smallpox vaccine is a live viral vaccine. Moreover,  despite 
large prospective clinical safety investigations of smallpox and myocarditis within the  last 20 years, 
the pathophysiological mechanism remain remains obscure. 
As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly expanded as a global pandemic caused by  severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, some COVID-19 patients that were  hospitalized developed 
an acute COVID-19 cardiovascular syndrome, which can manifest with a  variety of clinical 
presentations but often presents as an acute cardiac injury with  cardiomyopathy, ventricular 
arrhythmias, and hemodynamic instability in the absence of  obstructive coronary artery disease. The 
cause of this injury is uncertain but is suspected to be  related to myocarditis, microvascular injury, 
systemic cytokine-mediated injury, or stress-related  cardiomyopathy. Although histologically 
unproven, severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 has the potential to directly replicate 
within cardiomyocytes and pericytes, leading  to viral myocarditis. 
SARS-COV-2 has angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) tropism.  ACE2 is an enzyme  located on 
the cell membranes of various types of cells in the body, including cardiomyocytes.  It  has been 
suggested, on this basis, that SARS-COV-2 could potentially mediate direct cardiac  injury.  To 
document such injury, the strongest evidence would come from laboratory  investigations conducted 
on endomyocardial biopsy material obtain from significant numbers of  patients with active SARS-
COV-2 infections and myocarditis.  Such endomyocardial biopsy  procedures pose non-trivial risks not 
only to patients but also to medical staff.  We noted only  one such biopsy in our spontaneous reports, 
and it was not etiologically informative. A published  review of 9 reported cases of endomyocardial 
biopsy in the setting of suspected cardiac illness  and SARS-COV-2 virus infection concluded that 
direct proof is lacking that the virus infects  myocytes leading to cell death and troponin release

(Kawakami et al. 2020  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7816957/). Thus, potential 
mechanisms  underlying myocarditis (and heart disease in general) in SARS-CoV-2 infections that 
involve  direct cardiomyocyte infection or other direct viral attack have not been demonstrated and 
would  require intense investigation of endomyocardial biopsy and autopsy samples. Eight of the 
reported cases of Myocarditis had previous COVID-19 infection. 
There are more cases of myocarditis reported after the 2nd  dose (53.2%) than after the 1st dose 
(35%).  Exposure to two doses is a bit less for the second dose than the first because of time 
truncation at the end of the reporting period (data lock point), when some vaccinees have not yet  had 
their second dose.  Also, a small proportion of vaccinees will not, for a variety of reasons, receive a 
second dose. These exposure differences are unlikely to have a substantial effect on our  observed 
findings. The main risk factors we observed for myocarditis are an overrepresentation  of cases in 
young men, but this male predominance is consistent with the situation in the general  population 
prior to the vaccination with mRNA-1273. Most studies of acute myocarditis report a  greater 
prevalence and severity in male patients, speculated to be caused by a protective effect of  natural 
hormonal influences on immune responses in women when compared with men. Patients  are usually 
between the ages of 20 and 50. 
No other important trending was observed with the reported cases of Myocarditis. 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment:  
The MAH has provided a discussion on risk factors, including infectious and non-infectious triggers, and 
highlights that myocarditis has been reported after other vaccines such as flu vaccine and smallpox. Viral 
myocarditis is considered the most frequent type, mostly affecting children and young adults.  
Most studies of acute myocarditis report a greater prevalence and severity in male patients, speculated 
to  be caused  by a protective  hormonal effect  on  the  immune system  in  women.  Patients are  usually 
between the ages of 20 and 50. Autoimmunity is central to the pathogenesis of acute myocarditis and 
hyperthyroidism that often present in young, otherwise healthy patients. 
The potential cardiotrophism of SARS-CoV-2 is discussed, including the potential of the virus to mediate 
direct  cardiac  injury  through  angiotensin  converting  enzyme  2  (ACE2)  tropism,  located  on  the 
cardiomyocytes.  It  is  however  difficult  to  prove  such  a  direct  relationship,  as  it  requires  antigen 
demonstration in endomyocardial biopsies. No discussion has been provided regarding the fact that it is 
the  Spike  protein  that  attach  to  the  ACE2  receptor,  and  whether  this  could  impact  the  possibility  of 
initiating a local reaction in the cardiac tissue post vaccination.  Eight of the reported cases of Myocarditis 
had previous COVID-19.  
There were more cases after 2nd dose compared to 1st dose, although the exposure is greater after the 
1st dose compared to the 2nd. This fact is only commented by the MAH as: “These exposure differences 
are  unlikely  to  have  a  substantial  effect  on  our  observed  findings”  –  the  MAH  has  not  provided  a 
discussion of the unexpected finding of increased reporting after 2nd dose.  
3.1.4.  ITEM 4 – O/E analyses 
Specific  observed/expected  (O/E)  analyses should  be performed  for  the  1st  dose  and 2nd 
dose  receivers  respectively.  Thus,  for  the  cumulative  review,  O/E  analyses  should  be 
stratified by  age, gender and  dose (1st or 2nd). For  the analyses, the MAH should  clearly 
state and justify  the  background  rates  used.  The  MAH  should  retrieve  the  most  relevant 
background rates  and take the source of the cases into consideration. Several risk windows

should be  considered (14 and 21 days). In the O/E analysis, the MAH is requested to perform 
adjustment for underreporting, backlog of case handling and sensitivity analysis. 
Sponsor Response: 
In the US, myopericarditis has been observed at a rate of 0.95 - 2.16 per 100,000 population in  the 
military[4].  Military service members are screened at entry to exclude those with significant  medical 
conditions; consequently, military populations are healthier than the general population  and may 
have lower disease rates. The cumulative reporting rate for myocarditis was 0.87 per  100,000 
person- years, which was below the ACCESS incidence estimate from Spain (FISABIO;  2017: 1.58 
per 100,000 person-years, 141.3 cases expected, rate ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.42 – 0.73)  and the 
United States (Kang 2021: 10.0 per 100,000 person-years, 894.2 cases expected, rate ratio 0.09, 
95% CI 0.07 -0.1). (See Table 8)

PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
The unadjusted overall reporting rate was below the ACCESS estimate from FISABIO, BIFAP and the 
US estimate from Kang 2021. The MAH has not justified the background rates used. FISABIO is a 
Spanish database of primary care, outpatient specialists and hospitalisation discharge diagnosis, BIFAP 
is a Spanish primary care and hospital discharge diagnoses. FISABIO is in the lower end of the ACCESS 
databases, and the BIFAP have the highest incidence rates of myocarditis in ACCESS, especially in the 
20-49 year age group. The US incidence rates are referred to be retrieved from a publication by Kang 
2021. It is of notice that the rate provided in the publication by Kang are not based on specific studies. 
Only a statement that “incidence is usually estimated between 10 to 20 cases per 100,000 persons” is 
included in this paper without any further reference to a source of this incidence. Therefore, a use of 
this US background rate is not considered scientifically justified. According to the 2019 Update from 
the GBD 2019 Study (Roth GA et al., 2020), a global 2019-annual rate of myocarditis was estimated 
6.1 per 100,000 (95% UI: 4.2 to 8.7 per 100,000) in men and 4.4 per 100,000 (95% UI: 3.0 to 6.3 
per 100,000) in women, in the age between 35 and 39 years. These rates lie between the above 
selected rates from the ACCESS study.   
The MAH has stratified the overall O/E into 1st and 2nd dose, and presented different calculations for 
assuming sensitivity of 25% and 50%, which adjusts for underreporting. This approach is endorsed.  
Considering 2nd dose, the observed exceeds the expected in FISABIO, both when assuming a 
sensitivity of 25% and 50%. When assuming a sensitivity of 25%, the observed exceeds the expected 
in the FISABIO database, for both the 1st, 2nd dose and overall. Of note, these calculations are not 
stratified by age or gender.

PK, Yacoub M, Zuhlke L, Murray C, Fuster V; GBD-NHLBI-JACC Global Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases Writing Group. Global Burden of 
Cardiovascular Diseases and Risk Factors, 1990-2019: Update From the GBD 2019 Study. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2020 Dec 22;76(25):2982-3021. 
doi: 10.1016/j.jacc.2020.11.010. Erratum in: J Am Coll Cardiol. 2021 Apr 20;77(15):1958-1959. PMID: 33309175; PMCID: PMC7755038. 
Stratification  by  age,  gender  and  dose  number  was  conducted  applying  two  different  risk 
windows,  a 14-day risk window and a 21-day risk window. The stratification with a 14-day 
risk  window  shows  an  increase  in  the  observed  to  expected  for  both  males  and  females 
ages  18-29  when  comparing reporting rates  to the  FISABIO  2017  ACCESS estimates  (e.g., 
for males: 33 cases  observed, 10.2 expected, rate ratio 3.23 (95% CI 1.6, 6.52). The observed 
cases remain at less than  half of the expected for comparisons against the BIFAF database. 
(See Table 9) 
When adding stratification by dose and by the 14-day risk window, shows the same pattern 
for  males after the first dose, but a larger increase after dose 2. Comparison to the FISABIO 
2017  estimates shows a small  increase in  the reporting rate for males 18-29  years  of age 
following dose  1 (11 events observed, 8.9 expected, rate ratio 1.31, 95% CI 0.53-3.20) and a 
larger increase in the reporting rate  following dose 2 (22 observed,  4.4  expected (rate ratio 
4.88, 95% CI 1.77-13.43).  The same increase is noted using the  21-day risk windows (See 
Table  10).  Interesting  to  note  is  that an increase for women in the same age group is also 
observed (rate ratio 2.35, 95% CI 0.29-  17.95) in the overall analysis, but when stratifying by 
age and dose and the two risk windows, the  increase is also observed in the 30-39 years old 
group (See Tables 9 and 10). Comparisons to the  BIFAP 2017 ACCESS estimates do not show 
an  excess  in  observed  to  expected  cases  (i.e.,  rate  ratio above 1) for any of the age, sex, 
dose, or risk window strata.

PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
The MAH has performed O/E analyses by applying a 14 day and 21 day risk window, as requested, and 
further stratified into age and sex, 1st dose and 2nd dose. Of note, no adjustment for underreporting 
has been applied in these calculations, hence, the true rate is likely higher than estimated in table 9. 
It is noted that in the 14-day risk window, an increase in the observed to expected for both males and 
females ages 18-29 were noted, when comparing reporting rates to the FISABIO 2017. If a sensitivity 
of 25-50% would be considered, the observed would also exceed the BIFAP rate in this age group, 
which would not be the case in the older age groups. It should be kept in mind that global myocarditis 
2019 rates were lower than rates BIFAB (11.76 per 100,000 PYs). Thus, rates from BIFAB may at the 
high end of what to expect. 
When stratifying further into dose 1 and 2, and still using a 14-day risk window, an increased reporting 
rate following dose 2 is noted in males aged 18-29. The rate ratio (using FISABIO) was 1.96 (0.71-
5.42) after dose 1 and 4.88 (1.77-13.43) after dose 2 – indicating a clear signal of increased risk in 
this population. For the BIFAP database, the corresponding rate ratios were 0.28 (0.14-0.54) for dose 
1 and 0.69 (0.4-1.18) for dose 2 - and importantly, this is without adjusting for underreporting, hence 
the true rate is greater than what has been calculated.  
For females, the absolute numbers are small, giving greater uncertainties and precludes conclusion.   
It is of importance to note that when several stratifications are applied, the absolute numbers get 
lower, which increases the uncertainties of the calculations (this specifically applies to the calculation 
regarding females) 
In the 21-day risk window, the same pattern is seen, although with slighter lower rate ratios compared 
to the 14 days risk window.  
The MAH concludes that the comparisons to the BIFAP 2017 ACCESS estimates do not show an excess 
in observed to expected cases (i.e., rate ratio above 1) for any of the age, sex, dose, or risk window 
strata. This cannot be endorsed, as the MAH has not applied any sensitivity adjustment for 
underreporting. If a 25-50% underreporting was considered, the observed number of cases in males 
aged 18-19 would have exceeded the expected also in the BIFAP 2017. 
An imbalance in observed versus expected cases of myocarditis is seen, especially in males 
aged 18-29, following the 2nd dose.   
As a consequence, the MAH argument (in section 3.1.3) that the higher incidence of post-vaccination 
myocarditis in young males is confounded by a higher background rate of myocarditis in this 
population, cannot be acknowledged when considering excessive observed rates in the age, sex and 
dose-stratified O/E-analyses.  
3.1.5.  ITEM 5 – discussion of mechanisms 
The MAH should further evaluate and discuss potential mechanisms: 
•  The MAH should consider multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) as an alternative  etiology 
upon  evaluation  of  the  myocarditis  cases.  The  MAH  should  discuss  the  immunologic 
mechanism  of  multisystem  inflammatory  syndromes  (MIS)-induced  myocarditis following

COVID-19,  and  if  any  parallels  can  be  drawn  to  the  immunologic  reactions  following 
vaccination. 
•  The  MAH  should  review  the  published  literature,  and  present  and  discuss  relevant 
publications  concerning  plausible  mechanisms  of  myocarditis  following  the  vaccination, 
concerning both COVID-19 vaccine Moderna and vaccines in general. 
•  The  MAH  is  requested  to  comment  and  discuss  the  potential  mechanism  of  vaccine 
triggered  autoimmune  reaction  as  hypothesized  by  Garcia  et  al.  in  a  literature  case  report 
concerning a case of myocarditis after 2nd dose in a 39-year-old male physician with a  past 
medical  history  of  auto-immune  conditions.  (Bautista  Garcia  J,et  al. Acute  myocarditis 
after administration of theBNT162b2 vaccine against COVID-19. Rev Esp  Cardiol. 2021. https 
://doi .org/10.1016/j. rec. 2021.04.005). 
Sponsor Response: 
The US CDC, in an internet posting last reviewed May 11, 2021 (https://www.cdc.gov/mis-  c/mis-
a/hcp.html), provides a case definition of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Adults  (MIS-A) as 
follows: 
D.  Primary clinical criteria 
•  Severe cardiac illness 
Includes myocarditis, pericarditis, coronary artery dilatation/aneurysm,  or 
new-onset right or left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF<50%), 2nd/3rd 
degree A-V block, or ventricular tachycardia. (Note: cardiac arrest alone 
does not meet this criterion) 
•  Rash AND non-purulent conjunctivitis 
E.  Secondary clinical criteria 
•  New-onset neurologic signs and symptoms 
Includes  encephalopathy  in  a  patient  without  prior  cognitive  impairment, 
seizures, meningeal signs, or peripheral neuropathy (including Guillain-  Barré 
syndrome) 
•  Shock or hypotension not attributable to medical therapy (e.g., sedation, renal 
replacement therapy) 
•  Abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea 
•  Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150,000/ microliter 
Except for possibly the primary clinical criterion of severe cardiac illness (primarily myocarditis  and 
pericarditis), the other primary and secondary clinical criteria noted above for MIS-A are not  common 
co-occurring findings in the case reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following  mRNA-1273 
immunization that we have received.  Moreover, the draft Brighton Collaboration  Definition of 
myocarditis does not specifically address severity, and at least some of the cases of  reported 
Brighton levels 1,2 or 3 myocarditis after vaccination would not be classified as severe. 
Similarly, a recent publication from Israel reported six cases of myocarditis post-vaccination  with 
BNT162b2 (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21006824?via%3Dihub); in 
describing the findings in these patients, there was no mention of the above MIS-A non-cardiac signs 
and symptoms.  It was also noted that the disease course was mild in all patients.  A recent case 
series, collected from various medical centers in the USA, of myopericarditis in seven male 
adolescent BNT162b2 vaccinees specifically noted that none of them met criteria for MIS-C.

(https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2021/06/04/peds.2021- 
052478.full.pdf). In addition, the authors highlighted that “all cardiac MRIs were diagnostic for 
myocarditis based on the modified Lake Louise criteria rather than MIS-C characteristics described by 
Blondiaux et al.”  Further, none of these patients was critically ill, and each was discharged home. 
Regarding the immunologic mechanisms of MIS-A-related myocarditis, Tenforde from CDC has written 
“further research is needed to understand the pathophysiology of cardiac injury, including cellular and 
molecular mechanisms”…”further studies on the immunopathogenesis of this syndrome are needed” 
(https://journal.chestnet.org/action/showPdf?pii=S0012-3692%2820%2934519-0).    The lack of 
endomyocardial biopsy studies of MIS-A related myocarditis highlights this challenge. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
The MAH states that except for myocarditis and pericarditis, the other primary and secondary clinical 
criteria for MIS-A are ”not common co-occurring findings” in the case reports of myocarditis and 
pericarditis. Although this is acknowledged, it would have been preferred if the MAH had shown the 
actual numbers of cases with these co-occurring criteria, and discussed whether there were any cases 
susceptive of MIS among those.   
The MAH also highlights that in a literature case series of myopericarditis, it was specifically noted 
that none of them met the criteria for MIS-C.  
Immunologic mechanistic parallels between SARS-CoV-2 infection that sometimes leads to  MIS-A 
and vaccination with mRNA that codes for spike protein to prevent this infection can be  addressed. 
Antibodies generated vs SARS-CoV-2 are greatly more heterogenous than those generated by 
mRNA-1273 that codes only for spike protein.  Shrock et al (Science. 2020 Nov 27; 370(6520): 
eabd4250) noted that “Deep serological profiling of 232 coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19) 
patients and 190 pre–COVID-19 era controls using VirScan revealed more than 800 [823] epitopes 
in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, including 10 epitopes likely recognized by  neutralizing antibodies” and 
“Examination of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 at the  epitope level using the triple-alanine 
scanning mutagenesis library revealed 145 (17.6%) epitopes  in S, 116 in N, and 562 across the 
remainder of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome.”  Thus, 145 epitopes  of the spike protein “S” represented 
only 17.6% of the 823 epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 identified in this study.  The other 678 (82.4%) 
epitopes identified in this study are not spike protein  epitopes and therefore not contained in the 
mRNA-1273 vaccine. 
Regarding cellular immunity, in Cell Grifoni et al noted CD4+ T cell responses against M, spike  and N 
proteins, nsp3, nsp4, ORF3s, ORF7a, nsp12, and ORF8. Similar to the serological study  noted above, 
this study focusing on cellular immunity suggests that the immunologic response to  SAR-CoV-2 is far 
broader than simply to spike protein.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7237901/ 
The case reported by Bautista Garcia involved BNT162b2 and not mRNA1273. This report  involves 
an unusual patient with an extremely rare combination of diverse and significant  clinical illnesses 
that predated his vaccination. These illnesses include asthma, autoimmune  hypothyroidism, chronic 
atrophic gastritis, multiple episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax, and  an episode of atrial 
fibrillation. The time from vaccination to fever above 38 degrees was 6  hours. The time from 
vaccination to onset of cardiac symptoms post vaccination was not  reported. This patient clearly had 
dysregulation of his immune system prior to vaccination as is  evidenced by previously diagnosed 
autoimmune hypothyroidism (mechanism unspecified), asthma and possibly also his atrophic 
gastritis.  To speculate on a mechanism for his myocarditis,  it would be important to begin with his 
host factors and environment.  The autoimmune  dysregulation that has resulted in his 
hypothyroidism, asthma and possibly chronic atrophic  gastritis was not described but would be an

excellent place to start to understand a potential  mechanism.  The challenge of developing such a 
mechanism is highlighted by the fact that even  though there have been very large numbers of 
clinical cases of myocarditis in patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection, the mechanism of myocarditis has 
not yet been elucidated  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7816957/).  Thus, for this 
case, mechanistic  determination is immensely challenging, especially in the absence of 
endomyocardial biopsy.   If  we knew the exact host factor immune defects in this case, we could 
assess better a potential  mechanism for the vaccine’s possibly triggering the myocarditis.  In this 
regard, we fully agree  with the author of the case report, who best knows the patient, and wrote: 
“In the case reported  here, as often occurs in acute myocarditis, the definitive etiological diagnosis 
was difficult to  determine.” 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
The MAH has addressed the immunologic mechanistic parallels between SARS-CoV-2 infection (that 
sometimes leads to MIS-A) and vaccination by comparing the number of epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 and 
the spike protein encoded by the vaccine mRNA. It is concluded that the natural infection initiates a 
broader humoral and cellular immune response compared to the vaccination, due to the more 
extensive amount of epitopes present on the virus.  
No discussion has been provided regarding similarities and differences between infection-driven and 
vaccine-initiated pro-inflammatory cascades, CD4/CD8 T-cell responses, Th1/Th2/Th17 
differentiation, which could impact the development of dysregulated inflammatory reactions. 
The MAH has satisfactorily discussed the paper by Baustia Garcia. 
3.1.6.  ITEM 6 – discussion on need to update product information 
In conclusion, the MAH should discuss the need to update the product information and risk 
management plan, including relevant risk minimisation measures. 
Sponsor Response: 
In the scientific literature to date we have not noted reports of Myocarditis or Pericarditis  following 
vaccination with mRNA-1273.  There have been news reports of the US Department  of Defense 
noting 11 cases of myocarditis after vaccination with mRNA-1273  (https://www.military.com/daily-
news/2021/04/26/pentagon-tracking-14-cases-of-heart-inflammation-troops-after-covid-19-
shots.html). As noted in our O:E analysis, there is a  background rate of myocarditis in the general 
population. Thus, at least some of the cases of  myocarditis following vaccination would definitely 
have occurred in the absence of vaccination. 
The MAH also recognize that there have been reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following 
vaccination with BNT162b2 (a different mRNA-based vaccine).  In addition to the Bautista  Garcia 
article and the US Department of Defense noting three cases, reports have included a  published case 
series from Israel of six male patients 
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21006824?via%3Dihub), a multi- 
center case series of seven adolescent males in the USA 
(https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2021/06/04/peds.2021- 
052478.full.pdf) in which the authors concluded that “currently no causal association has been 
established between this vaccine and myopericarditis”, and news reports of a nationwide study in 
Israel (https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2021/06/04/peds.2021-
052478.full.pdf)–all involving BNT162b2.

Spontaneous adverse event reports involving mRNA-1273 reviewed above show a greater number of 
reports involving young men after the second dose. The background rates from our O:E analyses 
show that young men have higher background rates than young women, a potential contributing 
factor. 
The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) COVID-19 Vaccine Safety  Technical 
(VaST) Work Group reported on May 24 that data from VAERS show that in the 30- day window 
following dose 2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, there was a higher number of observed than expected 
myocarditis/pericarditis cases in 16–24-year-olds.  (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/work-groups-
vast/report-2021-05-24.html). To date there have not been to the MAH knowledge any 
medical/scientific reports of population-based studies  that found increased incidence of myocarditis 
or pericarditis following immunization with  mRNA-based vaccines. Indeed, CDC’s Vaccine Safety 
Technical Work Group reported that data  from their Vaccine Safety Datalink, which is population-
based, “do not show that rates of  myocarditis/pericarditis reports in the window following COVID-19 
vaccination differ from  expected at this time.” 
At this time, available data are not conclusive. Findings now available may relate to the wide 
spectrum of severity of myocarditis and pericarditis.  There is variation in the reporting of the 
events, as likely evidenced by the widely varying incidence rates among the European ACCESS  sites 
that could be due to variations in diagnostic procedures, case detection sensitivity and  reporting. 
Moreover, in the USA, such age-based rates are not even readily available.  In  addition, because 
there is a background rate of myocarditis that preceded the SARS-CoV-2  pandemic, there is also the 
possibility that vaccine reactogenicity or simply knowledge of  vaccination led to cases coming to 
clinical attention and reporting that might not have otherwise. 
The current situation as outlined above is materially little different from what CDC’s VaST Work Group 
appreciated at the time it made its May 24 report cited above, with the vast majority  of the evidence 
related to BNT162b2 rather than mRNA-1273. Consequently CDC has addressed  the issue by posting 
on its website: “Clinical Considerations: Myocarditis and Pericarditis after  Receipt of mRNA COVID-19 
Vaccines Among Adolescents and Young Adults” (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-
considerations/myocarditis.html\); this is directed to clinicians and deals with diagnostic evaluation and 
follow-up, among other issues. 
Another, related CDC web posting is “Myocarditis and Pericarditis Following mRNA COVID-
19 Vaccination” (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-
cov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html). 
Key points that CDC makes in the latter publication are as follows: 
D.  “Most patients who received care responded well to medicine and rest and quickly felt 
better. 
E.  Cases reported to VAERS have occurred: 
•  Mostly in male adolescents and young adults age 16 years or older 
•  More often after getting the second dose of one of these two COVID-19 vaccines 
than after the first dose 
•  Typically within several days after COVID-19 vaccination” 
The above steps by CDC in the USA, where most doses of mRNA-1273 have been administered,  have 
served to minimize risk without involving change of the product information. At the same  time, 
adverse event surveillance continues, including the performance of population-based 
pharmacoepidemiological studies aimed at quantifying any potential increase in risk of  myocarditis or 
Signal assessment report on myocarditis and pericarditis with Spikevax (previously 
COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna)

Page 34/121 
 
 
 
 
 
pericarditis as well as identifying any possible risk factors. At this time, this  approach seems prudent 
and appropriate. 
Based on the analysis of all the safety data available as of 31 May 2021, the MAH considers that 
Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis are not presently a safety issue of concern that would justify  inclusion 
of  “Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis” in the ADR table in section 4.8 of the SmPC nor  in section 4 of 
the PL. The MAH will continue to closely evaluate events of “Myocarditis and/or  Pericarditis” using 
routine surveillance as well as already planned pharmacoepidemiological  studies. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
The MAH considers that Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis are not presently a safety issue of concern 
that would justify inclusion of “Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis” in the ADR table in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC nor in section 4 of the PL. 
The MAH has not noted any scientific publications regarding reports of Myocarditis or Pericarditis 
following vaccination with mRNA-1273. However, three recent publications (case reports) have been 
identified, which are commented upon in section 3.3. 
The MAH acknowledge that there were greater number of reports involving young men after the 
second dose, and argues that background rates from the O:E analyses show that young men have 
higher background rates than young women. Although it is acknowledged that there is a higher 
background rate among young men, it does not explain the greater increase in rate ratio following 
the 2nd dose compared to 1st dose, in men aged 18-29 years.  
According to the CDC’s ACIP COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Work Group, data from 
VAERS (May 24) show that in the 30- day window following dose 2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, 
there was a higher number of observed than expected myocarditis/pericarditis cases in 16–24-year-
olds; a finding in line with the O/E analyses of myocarditis presented in this report. The MAH has no 
knowledge of any medical/scientific reports of population-based studies that found increased 
incidence of myocarditis or pericarditis following immunization with mRNA-based vaccines. To the 
knowledge of the Rapporteur, such studies are ongoing in the European/Nordic setting, and results 
are expected to be available shortly.

3.1.7.  ITEM 1 - PERICARDITIS 
Sponsor Response: 
The company clinical database and the global safety database were queried for valid, clinical and 
spontaneous case reports received from HCP, HA, consumers and literature, cumulative from 18 
December 2020 to 31 May 2021, worldwide, reported for the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna  COVID-
19 vaccine Moderna) using the following Preferred Terms (PTs): “Viral pericarditis;  Pericarditis; 
Pericarditis infective; Myocarditis; Myocarditis septic; Myocarditis infectious;  Viral 
myocarditis; and Myocarditis post-infection”. As of 31 May 2021, there have been  250,275,820 
doses of the mRNA vaccine distributed worldwide. 
A review of the spontaneous reports from the company’s global safety identified 68 case reports  with 
the PTs of Pericarditis. All of the aforementioned reports were considered serious reports. As  a difference 
with the Myocarditis reports, most of the Pericarditis reports (64.7%) involved persons >50 years of age 
(See Table 11).

PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment: 
The MAH has identified 68 case reports with PTs of Pericarditis, without concurrent myocarditis. In 
contrast to myocarditis, the cases were not primarily in the younger age group. Only 4% of the reports 
were patients under the age of 25, and 65% of the reports were in patients >50 years (in myocarditis, 
only 19% of reports were in age group >50). Of note, 19% were reported in the age group 30-39, 
which is different from the age groups immediately younger and older. However, as the numbers are 
relatively low, interpretation should be made with caution. 
There reports are equally distributed among sex, and compared to myocarditis, the TTO are more 
equally distributed up to 30 days. 34 % of the cases are reported within 3 days of vaccination, 
compared with Myocarditis, where 63% of the cases had a reported event onset within 3 days. 
Also regarding 1st and 2nd dose, the reports are equally distributed (37% after dose 1 and 41% after 
dose 2), as opposed to myocarditis, where a disproportion was noted for 2nd dose.  
3.1.8.  ITEM 2 – causality assessment 
Sponsor Response: 
The sponsor conducted and evaluation of all the cases identified as cases of Pericarditis according to the 
PRAC’s recommendation (See Table 15, Annex IV of this report), utilizing the WHO-UMC causality 
assessment (which allow to perform a combined assessment of the reported cases taking into  account 
the clinical-pharmacological aspects of the case history and the quality of the  documentation of the 
observation)[1]. 
Based on the assessment conducted on the 68 cases reporting Pericarditis PTs, there were 18  reports 
that were classified as “Possible” according to the WHO-UMC causality assessment  (Event or 
laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to drug intake; could  also be explained 
by disease or other drugs; information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or  unclear).

COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna)  
EMA/PRAC/326194/2021 
Page 37/121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH considers that because 1) there are no pathognomonic findings that are indicative of  certain 
vaccine causality of pericarditis; 2) there exists a background incidence of these illnesses  that pre-
dated mRNA-1273 and 3) it has not been proven that immunization with mRNA-1273 or  any  mRNA 
vaccine can  cause pericarditis, no cases were classified as certain or probable  according to the WHO-
UMC causality assessment. 
Out of the 68 cases reporting Pericarditis PTs, there were 18 reports that were classified as  “Unlikely” 
according to the WHO-UMC causality assessment (Event or laboratory test  abnormality, with a time to 
drug intake that makes a relationship improbable (but not  impossible); Disease or other drugs provide 
plausible explanations). (See Table 16, Annex V of this report) 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment:  
As requested, the MAH has evaluated all cases identified as pericarditis, utilizing the WHO- UMC causality 
assessment. 
A causality assessment was performed on cases that were classified by the MAH as WHO Possible. The 
assessment included 18 cases where a full case narrative could be retrieved from EudraVigilance. 
The cases comprised 9 males and 9 females aged 20-89 years of age (stratified by decades there was 
one aged 20-29 ys, five aged 30-39 ys, three aged 40-49 ys, one aged 50-59 ys, four aged 60-69, three 
aged 70-79, and one 80-89 ys.).   
Generally, the diagnostic basis for the reported events of pericarditis is rather poor; in several cases 
pericarditis is reported as an adverse event but the available information is rather incomplete regarding 
clinical  findings  and/or  tests  results  and/or  symptoms.  This  has  led  to  3  cases  being  concluded  as 
unassessable.  
Three cases are considered possible, these are all in younger adults, age range 20-39 ys., of these 2 
females after the 1st dose of covid-19 vaccine and 1 male after the 2nd dose. There are 12 cases that 
are assessed as unlikely.  
Summing  up  on  the assessment  of causality to  the immunization  3  cases  are  found  possible,  12  are 
found unlikely, while 3 are unassessable. For short summaries of the cases, see below. 
3 cases considered WHO Possible:  
Case 1 
Pericarditis  
A 30-39 year old female who 12 days after receiving the 1st dose of covid-19-vaccine experienced chest 
pain. Ultrasonography showed trace pericardial effusion, ECG abnormalities consistent with pericarditis; 
the ECG was normalized a week later. 
Medical history included pericarditis, Covid-19 in September and November 2020. 
The patient is reported allergic to ciprofloxacin and milk.   
Symptoms and findings are consistent with pericarditis, and there is a reasonable time relationship to 
the immunization although it could be temporally coincidental and other causes for pericarditis are not 
excluded. Therefore, this is WHO-UMC: Possible. 
Case 2 
Pericarditis  
A 20-29 year old male who two days after receiving the 2nd dose of covid-19-vaccine experienced chest 
pain. ECG showed unspecified abnormalities; blood test results included increased biomarker (elevated 
troponin  levels).  Furthermore,  X-ray,  ECHO,  MRI  scan,  and  heart  catherization  were  performed,  but 
results are not reported.  
Medical history included nasal congestion and cough, sleep apnoea and neurodevelopmental disorder.

• 
Symptoms and abnormal ECG findings, and a reasonable time relationship to the immunization 
although it could be temporally coincidental, however other causes for pericarditis not being excluded. 
Therefore, this is WHO-UMC: Possible. 
Case 3 
Pericarditis  
A 30-39 year old female who 5 days after receiving the 1st dose of covid-19-vaccine experienced chest 
pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue.  
ECG  demonstrated  first  degree  AV  block  with  right  bundle  branch  block.  Additionally,  a  cardiologist 
diagnosed her with pericarditis 13 days later.  
Medical history was not reported, but medicine included a sedative/hypnotica and contraceptive.   
• 
Pericarditis  was  diagnosed  by  a  cardiologist.  There  is  a  temporal  relationship  to  the 
immunization. The pericarditis could be due to other causes, however, when considering association to 
the vaccine a possible relation that she within a few days from receiving the 1st dose had myocarditis 
leading  to  the  right  bundle  branch  block,  pericarditis  developed  subsequently.  Other  causes  for 
pericarditis are not excluded. Therefore, this is WHO-UMC: Possible. 
12 cases considered WHO Unlikely: 
Case 1 
Pericarditis  
A 30-39 year old male who 18 days after receiving the 1st dose of covid-19-vaccine experienced chest 
pain and ECHO showed pericardial effusion. 
Medical  history  included  chronic  renal  insufficiency  secondary  to  glomerulonephritis  membranosa 
proliferative with hypertension and hyperuricemia and need for dialysis. 
Symptoms and findings are consistent with pericarditis. There is a reasonable time relationship to the 
immunization although it could be temporally coincidental. The patient suffers from chronic renal failure 
which is a plausible cause of pericarditis. Therefore, this is WHO-UMC: Unlikely. 
Case 2 
Pericarditis  
A 60-69 year old male who four days after receiving the 2nd dose of covid-19-vaccine experienced onset 
of fever and symptoms with malaise, fatigue, fever, chest discomfort and dyspnoea.  
ECHO showed effusion. 
Medical history included type 2 diabetes, depression, hyperlipidemia. 
Symptoms and findings are consistent with pericarditis. However, onset of fever with other symptoms 
not until four days after vaccination is more likely to be infection-related, temporally coincidental to the 
immunization, and other causes for pericarditis are more likely. Therefore, this is WHO-UMC: Unlikely. 
Case 3 
Pericarditis  
A 40-49 year old female who the day after receiving the 2nd dose of covid-19-vaccine experienced a 
variety  of  symptoms  including  chest  pain,  painful  respiration,  cold  sweat,  hyperhidrosis,  vomiting, 
presyncope and more widespread pain.  
The only paraclinical results reported are ECG with ST-elevations. ECHO performed but not described. 
Concomitant disease was Covid-19. 
Symptoms and findings may be due to other conditions including other cardial conditions e.g. infarction. 
Furthermore, in case of pericarditis, there could be a causal relationship to the concomitant Covid-19

disease.  The  time  relationship  to  immunization  may  therefore  be  coincidental.  This  is  WHO-UMC: 
Unlikely. 
Case 4 
Pericarditis  
A 40-49 year old male who 7 days after receiving a dose of covid-19-vaccine, unknown if it was the 1st 
or 2nd, experienced thoracal back pain and later painful respiration.  
CT scan demonstrated pericardial and pleural fluid. Blood test results reported comprise increased CRP 
and increased sedimentation rate, both being unspecific inflammation markers. 
Medical  history  included  colitis  ulcerosa,  and  the patient  was  treated  with  anti-TNF-alpha-antibodies. 
(immunosuppressive).  
Symptoms and findings are consistent with pericarditis, however, also pleuritis was demonstrated, other 
health issues in this patient provide plausible explanations, and the time relationship to immunization 
may therefore be coincidental. This is WHO-UMC: Unlikely. 
Case 5 
Pericarditis  
A 70-79 year old male who the day after receiving the 2nd dose of covid-19-vaccine experienced chest 
pain, more widespread pain, loss of appetite, somnolence and chills.  
He  had  high  fever,  ECG  with  normal  sinus  rhythm,  chest  X-ray  showed  cardiomegaly,  CT  scan 
demonstrated pulmonary embolism, Fibrin D-dimer was highly increased. 
Medical history included bigeminy, scleroderma, essential tremor and bowel obstruction. 
Allergies included drug allergy and unspecified food allergy. 
The  patient  had  cardiomegaly  and  lung  embolism,  hence  other  health  issues  in  this  patient  provide 
plausible explanations, and the time relationship to immunization may therefore be coincidental. This is 
WHO-UMC: Unlikely. 
Case 6 
Pericarditis  
A  70-79  year  old  female  who  the  day  after  receiving  the  2nd  dose  of  covid-19-vaccine  experienced 
myalgia,  fatigue,  pyrexia,  consistent  with  known  side  effects  to  the  vaccine,  furthermore  mental 
impairment. 
As late as 46 days after the 2nd dose of covid-19-vaccine she got pericarditis; no test results or findings 
from physical examination are reported.   
Medical history includes hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, allergy to seafood. 
Report suggesting pericarditis and atrial fibrillation as an adverse reaction. However, there is no test 
results or findings from physical examination to support or contradict the suggested diagnosis. This case 
cannot be judged due to the available information being insufficient. WHO-UMC Unassessable. 
In case of test results being reported later the temporal relationship is improbable and other explanations 
could be plausible making it WHO-UMC: Unlikely. 
Case 7 
Pericarditis  
A 40-49 year old female who 3 days after receiving the 2nd dose of covid-19-vaccine experienced an 
extremely  wide  variety  of  symptoms  of  which  some  as  myalgia,  fatigue,  pyrexia  are  consistent  with 
known  side  effects  to  the  vaccine,  anxiety  which  be  an  immunization-related  anxiety  reaction,  to

symptoms  as  cardiac  pain  and  short  of  breath  and  gastrointestinal  symptoms  which  could  be  either 
anxiety-related or on somatic basis. 
She  was  thoroughly  tested,  high  blood  pressure  was  demonstrated  on  the  day  of  hospitalization. 
Endoscopy of upper gastrointestinal tract showed hiatus hernia and gastritis. 
All other tests were found normal, these tests were: ECG, ECHO, chest X-ray, CT scan, ultrasonography, 
biopsy, colonoscopy, stress test and blood test. 
Concurrent medical conditions included thyreoiditis. 
• 
This patient experienced an extremely wide variety of symptoms, pericarditis was reported as 
suggested  adverse  reaction.  This  patient  has  been  thoroughly  examined  corresponding  to  the  many 
symptoms, and there is no test result or finding to support or contradict the suggested diagnoses; in 
fact, the test results show no pericarditis. Therefore WHO-UMC: Unlikely. 
Case 8 
Pericarditis  
A 30-39 year old female who 23 days after receiving the 1st dose of covid-19-vaccine was hospitalized 
for pericarditis. No symptoms are reported. No physical examination or test results are reported.  
Medical history included hypothyreoidism, cerebral infarction, thalassemia, allergy. 
• 
According to the literature there is an association between pericardial effusion or pericarditis and 
hypothyreoidism. Therefore, in this case other health issues provide plausible explanations, furthermore 
the temporal relationship to immunization may be coincidental. This is therefore assessed as WHO-UMC: 
Unlikely. 
Case 9 
Pericarditis  
A 70-79 year old female who 21 days after receiving the 1st dose of covid-19-vaccine was medically 
examined  having  several  blood  tests,  respiratory  viral  PCR,  ECG,  ECHO.  Pericardial  effusion  was 
reported, but no other test results, and no symptoms were reported.   
Medical history included hypertension and primary biliary cirrhosis. 
Furthermore,  a  list  of  concomitant  medicines  was  reported  including  for  hypertension,  gall  stones, 
allergy, asthma, anxiety. 
• 
The  pericarditis  is  according  to  the  available  information  diagnostically  only  supported  by 
pericardial effusion; other plausible explanations are not excluded, and the 21 days long time relationship 
to immunization may be coincidental. This is WHO-UMC: Unlikely. 
Case 10 
Pericarditis  
A  50-59  year  old  female  who  18  days  after  receiving  the  1st  dose  of  covid-19-vaccine  experienced 
thoracal  pain  and  dyspnoea.  Medical  examinations  included  increased CRP,  increased  fibrin  D-dimer, 
increased  leucocytes,  abnormal  full  blood  count,  increased  platelet  concentration,  abnormal  liver 
parameters. A covid-19 virus test was positive. ECHO demonstrated pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, 
pneumonitis. Hepatitis was also diagnosed. 
• 
Symptoms  and  test  results  are  compatible  with  pericarditis  as  one  of  more  diagnoses  also 
comprising pneumonitis with pleural effusion and hepatitis, the temporal relationship is a little long and 
may be coincidental taking all other concurrent diagnoses into account. Furthermore, other conditions 
could provide plausible explanations. WHO-UMC: Unlikely. 
Case 11 
Pericarditis

COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna)  
EMA/PRAC/326194/2021 
Page 41/121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A  60-69  year  old  male  who  approximately  9  days  after  receiving  the  1st  dose  of  covid-19-vaccine 
experienced fever and chills, lymphadenopathy, chest pain and painful respiration.  
Clinical  findings  included  blood  tests,  test  for  SARS-CoV-2,  urinanalysis,  ECG,  chest  X-ray,  ECHO, 
pericardiocentesis, pericardial fluid analysis. No test results provided. 
Medical history included hypertension, recurrent syncopal episodes, atrial fibrillation, reflux disease and 
anxiety with concomitant medication corresponding to more of these diagnoses. 
• 
Despite the temporal association to immunization, onset of fever and chills as late as nine days 
after  immunization  talk  against  these  symptoms  being  general  side  effects  and  together  with  the 
lymphadenopathy, they suggest an underlying disease as e.g. infection. Underlying disease as suspected 
due to fever and lymphadenopathy could provide plausible explanations for the reported pericarditis. 
This case is WHO-UMC: Unlikely. 
Case 12 
Pericarditis 
A  60-69  year  old  male  who  approximately  9  days  after  receiving  the  1st  dose  of  covid-19-vaccine 
experienced  severe  chest  pain  and  dyspnoea.  According  to  the  provided  information,  he  himself 
suspected having pericarditis but did not seek medical attention, instead he self-medicated himself using 
an  over-the-counter  painkiller;  nevertheless,  the  chest  pain  and  dyspnoea  continued  for  8  days 
whereupon he called for emergency help, ST-elevation myocardial infarction was found. He died. Clinical 
findings were ST-elevation myocardial infarction.  
Medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, pericarditis. 
• 
This patient had symptoms consistent with cardiac symptoms for 8 days whereupon test results 
demonstrated  acute  myocardial  infarction  with  ST-elevations.  Among  risk  factors  were  hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia and being of male gender; hence underlying health issues provide plausible explanations 
for the event, including that the delay in seeking medical attention may well have worsened the situation. 
Pericarditis  was  suspected  by  the  patient,  but  not  diagnosed.  There  is  a  temporal  association  to  the 
vaccination, however considering the course this is likely to be coincidental. WHO-UMC. Unlikely. 
3 cases considered WHO Unassessable: 
Case 1 
Pericarditis  
A 30-39 year old male who 3 days after receiving the 2nd dose of covid-19-vaccine experienced chest 
pain, dyspnoea and paraesthesia. CT scan, MRI scan and ultrasonography were performed, but results 
are not provided. 
No medical history was reported, however, concomitant medication included 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor. 
Due to lack of reported results including from the three performed scans, the information is insufficient 
both regarding the diagnosis (only perceived symptoms) and regarding possible etiology. Therefore, this 
case is WHO-UMC: Unassessable. 
Case 2 
Pericarditis  
A 60-69 year old female who the first and second day after receiving the 2nd dose of covid-19-vaccine 
experienced symptoms compatible with known side effects to the vaccine, e.g. body aches, headache, 
fever, chills, muscle stiffness.  
Three to four days after the vaccination she reported painful respiration, tremor and had atrial fibrillation 
treated with medication. Furthermore, heart murmur and pericarditis are reported. However, no findings 
from medical examination or test results are provided.

to the available information being insufficient. WHO-UMC Unassessable. 
Case 3 
Pericarditis  
An  80-89  year  old  male  who  the  day  after  receiving  the  2nd  dose  of  covid-19-vaccine  experienced 
malaise, chest pain, dyspnoea, asthenia.  
Chest X-ray, chest CT scan, and ECG were performed, but all are reported as being inconclusive. 
Report suggesting pericarditis and atrial fibrillation as an adverse reaction. However, there is no test 
results or findings from physical examination to support or contradict the suggested diagnosis. This case 
cannot be judged due to the available information being insufficient. WHO-UMC Unassessable. 
3.1.9.  ITEM 3 – risk factors / Pericarditis 
The review should explore possible risk factors, taking into account the gender, age, and dose 
distribution of reported cases. Specifically, the MAH is requested to comment on the number 
of  cases  occurring  after  the  2nd  dose  as  compared  to  the  1st  dose,  also  considering  the 
differences in exposure for these two groups. The MAH should discuss whether any patterns 
or trends can be identified concerning risk factors. 
Sponsor Response: 
Acute pericarditis is an inflammatory process involving the pericardium that results in a clinical 
syndrome characterized by chest pain, pericardial friction rub, changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) 
and occasionally, a pericardial effusion. Generally, the diagnosis requires 2 of these 4 features. 
Epidemiologic data on the incidence of acute pericarditis are lacking, likely because this  condition is 
frequently inapparent clinically, despite its presence in numerous disorders.  However, it appears to 
be the most common form of pericardial disease and a relatively common  cause of chest pain. Acute 
pericarditis is the most common affliction of the pericardium. It is  diagnosed in approximately 0.1% 
of patients hospitalized for chest pain and in 5% of patients  admitted to the emergency department 
for chest pain unrelated to acute myocardial infarction  (MI). Although acute pericarditis occurs in all 
age groups and in men and women, it presents  most often in men 20 to 50 years of age. The most 
common form of acute pericarditis is  idiopathic, which accounts for about 90% of cases. Other 
common causes include infection, renal  failure, myocardial infarction (MI), post-cardiac injury 
syndrome, malignancy, radiation, and  trauma. Acute pericarditis is more common in men than in 
women. However, although this  condition is more common in adults than in children, adolescents are 
more commonly affected  than young adults. 
There were no important differences observed in the cases reported with Pericarditis, as  explained 
above, regarding age, gender, or TTO after the 1st  or the 2nd  dose of the mRNA-1273  vaccine. 
No other important trending was observed with the reported cases of Pericarditis. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
The MAH has shortly presented risk factors, and states that pericarditis can occur in all age groups, in 
both  men  and  women,  however  presents  most  often  in  men  20-50  years  of  age.  90%  of  cases  are

idiopathic; other causes include infection, renal failure, myocardial infarction (MI), post-cardiac injury 
syndrome, malignancy, radiation, and trauma. The MAH concludes that no important differences were 
observed in the cases reported with Pericarditis, regarding age, gender, or TTO after the 1st or the 2nd 
dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine, and no other important trending was observed with the reported cases 
of Pericarditis. 
3.1.10.  ITEM 4 – O/E analyses 
Specific O/E analyses should be performed for the 1st dose and 2nd dose receivers respectively. 
Thus, for the cumulative review, 0/E analyses should be stratified by age, gender and dose 
(l5t or 2nd). For the analyses, the MAH should clearly state and justify the background rates 
used. The MAH should retrieve the most  relevant background rates and take the source of 
the cases into consideration. Several risk windows should be considered (14 and 21 days). In 
the 0/E  analysis,  the MAH  is  requested  to perform adjustment  for  underreporting, backlog 
of case handling and sensitivity analysis. 
Sponsor Response: 
In the US, acute pericarditis has been observed at a rate of 5.73 - 26 per 100,000 person-years, and 
at  a  rate  of  0.25  -  55  per  100,000  individuals’  post-vaccination(6).  The  MAH  was  able  to  find  few 
estimates of the incidence of pericarditis. Sources describing the incidence of pericarditis specifically in 
the US were not identified, and the individual condition is not described by the ACCESS study. However, 
some  data  in  Europe  have  been  published.  A  prospective  clinical  cohort  study  in  Italy  identified  an 
incidence of 27.7 cases per 100,000 person-years. Another study, a retrospective analysis of Finnish 
registry  data  capturing  admissions  to  29  hospitals  over  a  span  of  9.5  years  identified  an  age 
standardized  incidence  of  3.32  per  100,000  person-years,  with  higher  rates  in  men  ages  16-65.15 
Hospitalization is not necessary for all cases of pericarditis; thus, hospitalization rates for pericarditis 
are

the 
disease. 
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2878263/) 
Stratification by age, gender and dose number was conducted applying two different risk windows,  a 14-
day risk  window  and  a  21-day risk  window.  The stratification  with  a  14-day risk  window  shows  an 
increase  in  the  observed  to  expected  for  both  males  and  females  ages  18-29  when  comparing 
reporting rates to the Finland (Kyto 2014) estimates (See Table 18). 
When adding stratification by dose and by the 14-day risk window, the data show the same pattern  for 
males after the first dose, but a larger increase after dose 2. Comparison to the Finland (Kyto 
2014) estimates shows a small increase in the reporting rate for males 18-29 years of age following 
dose  1  and  a  larger  increase  in  the  reporting  rate  following  dose  2  (See  Table  18).  The  same 
increase  is  noted  using  the  21-day  risk  windows  (See  Table  19).  Interesting  to  note  is  that  an 
increase for women in the same age group (18-29 years old) is also observed in the overall analysis, but 
when stratifying by age and dose and the two risk windows, the increase is also observed in  the 30-
39 years old group (See Tables 18 and 19). 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
Since the ACCESS project does not include pericarditis in the background rate calculations, the MAH 
has looked into background incidences from different sources. Background incidence estimates 
included data from the US (5.73 – 26 cases per 100,000 PY), Italy (27.7 cases per 100,000 PY) and 
Finland (3.32 per 100,000 PY – hospital records). In the data from Finland, there were higher rates in

men ages 16-65 years. The MAH points out that since hospitalisation is not necessary for all cases of 
pericarditis, rates deriving from hospital records might underestimate the true incidence rate, which 
could explain the lower incidence in the Finnish data. 
It was unclear to the assessor which “observed” data that was used for calculations of 
Observed/Expected. On 28 Jun 2021, the MAH provided clarification and also updated 
Observed/Expected calculations, both for “pericarditis with myocarditis”, and for “pericarditis without 
myocarditis”. See Annex VI for the MAH response. In the analyses, no conclusions can be drawn 
regarding the “pericarditis without myocarditis”, based on low numbers in each category. For the 
analyses regarding “pericarditis with or without myocarditis”, it is evident that more cases are 
observed in the younger age groups (males 18-29 years), after the 2nd dose; a finding of borderline 
significance (lower bound of 95% CI>1), however with no adjustment for underreporting.   
3.1.11.  ITEM 5 – discussion of mechanisms 
The MAH should further evaluate and discuss potential mechanisms: 
F.  The MAH should consider multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) as an alternative 
etiology  upon  evaluation  of  the  pericarditis  cases.  The  MAH  should  discuss  the 
immunologic  mechanism  of  multisystem  inflammatory  syndromes  (MIS)-induced 
pericarditis following COVID-19, and if any parallels can be drawn to the immunologic 
reactions following vaccination. 
G.  The  MAH  should  review  the  published  literature,  and  present  and  discuss  relevant 
publications concerning plausible mechanisms of pericarditis following the vaccination, 
concerning both COVID-19 vaccine Moderna and vaccines in general. 
Sponsor Response: 
With regard to pericarditis, multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) and potential mechanisms,  the 
MAH’s  discussion  of  this  issue  related  to  Myocarditis  in  this  report  remains  relevant  and  applicable 
for cases of Pericarditis.  Moreover, similar to the situation with the cases who had  myocarditis, the 
cases who had pericarditis did not commonly exhibit other clinical criteria of the  adult form of MIS that 
was described in detail above. (See section 3.1.5 ITEM 5 for reports of Myocarditis) 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment: please refer to comment in section 3.1.5. 
3.1.12.  ITEM 6 – discussion on the need to update product information 
In conclusion, the MAH should discuss the need to update the product information and risk 
management plan, including relevant risk minimisation measures. 
The  PRAC  will  assess  the  MAH's  answers  to  this  List  of  questions  within  an  accelerated 
timetable,  which would allow for the following PRAC discussion  to take place in  July  2021 
PRAC. 
Sponsor Response: 
As discussed above under section 3.1.6 ITEM 6 of the Myocarditis evaluation, at this time, available 
data is  not conclusive. The CDC communications described in section 3.1.6 ITEM 6 above address 
both myocarditis  and pericarditis. Findings now available may relate to the wide spectrum of severity

of  myocarditis and pericarditis.  There is variation in the reporting of the events, as likely evidenced 
by the widely varying incidence rates among the European ACCESS sites that could be due to 
variations in diagnostic procedures, case detection sensitivity and reporting. Moreover, in the  USA, 
such age-based rates are not even readily available.  In addition, because there is a  background rate 
of myocarditis and pericarditis that preceded the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there  is also the possibility 
that vaccine reactogenicity or simply knowledge of vaccination led to cases  coming to clinical 
attention and reporting that might not have otherwise.  
Based on the analysis of all the safety data available as of 31 May 2021, the MAH considers that 
Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis are not presently a safety issue of concern that would justify  inclusion 
of  “Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis” in the ADR table in section 4.8 of the SmPC nor  in section 4 of 
the PL. The MAH will continue to closely evaluate events of “Myocarditis and/or  Pericarditis” using 
routine surveillance as well as already planned pharmacoepidemiological  studies. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
The MAH concludes that available data is not conclusive. The MAH further highlights the variation 
among reporting of events, diagnostic procedures, case detection sensitivity, and that vaccine 
reactogenicity or simply knowledge of vaccination led to cases coming to clinical attention and 
reporting that might not have otherwise. It is acknowledged that the COVID-19 vaccines with the 
concurrent media attention and national local initiatives to enhance reporting of adverse events, have 
increased the reporting, hence, compared to other medicinal products, the under-reporting of events 
might not be as high as for other products.  
3.2.  Latest OE analysis by gender – DLP 13 June 
An updated OE analyses with a DLP 13 June 2021 was provided by the EMA. For full presentation, 
please refer to Annex VII

PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
The EMA has performed an updated O/E analysis of cases of myocarditis in the EU/EEA with a DLP 13 
June 2021. The analysis was made using the background incidence from the ACCESS database ARS, 
which includes outcomes from primary and secondary care. The observed cases included cases from 
Eudravigilance retrieved from HLT infectious myocarditis and HLT Noninfectious myocarditis.  
The number of observed cases of myocarditis with Moderna are low, which could be explained by the 
fact the US cases are not included in the analysis.

COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna)  
EMA/PRAC/326194/2021 
Page 47/121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Statistically significant OE ratios were observed in the male group aged 18-24 for Comirnaty and 
Moderna, when using a 14 day risk window. The analyses have not been stratified into 1st dose and 2nd 
dose. For the other age groups and females, the numbers are considered too low in order to draw any 
conclusions.  
Nevertheless, these results are in line with the findings from the more robust overall O/E analyses 
performed by the MAH, for which both EEA and US cases were included, indicating a higher risk in 
young males.

PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
EMA has also performed an updated O/E-analysis on cases of myocarditis and pericarditis, with DLP 13 
June 2021.  
The same background incidence database as for myocarditis was used (ARS). In addition to the 
observed cases from Eudravigilance regarding myocarditis (HLT infectious myocarditis and HLT 
Noninfectious myocarditis), also cases within HLT Infectious pericarditis and HLT Noninfectious 
pericarditis were included.  
Also in this analysis, a statistically significant OE ratio was observed in the male group aged 18-24, 
although, as pointed out by EMA, the incidence rates for myocarditis+pericarditis in the < 30 age 
group are ~ twice those for myocarditis, while the majority (~ 75 %) of EV cases is for myocarditis, 
therefore the OE results for myocarditis+pericarditis are more diluted in the younger age groups. 
Again, the number of cases in other age groups and in females are considered too low in order to base 
conclusions on. 
3.3.  Discussion and conclusion 
The MAH has presented data, for the occurrence of myocarditis / pericarditis and Spikevax (previous 
COVID-19 vaccine Moderna).  
The MAH has based their analysis on 77 cases of myocarditis and 68 reports of pericarditis retrieved in 
the period from IBD to 31 May 2021. A search was made in Eudravigilance to identify the number of 
cases of myocarditis and pericarditis reported after DLP (31/5-21). This revealed a significant increase 
in reported cases from 73 to 152 cases of pericarditis in the interval from DLP up to 24 June 2021 and 
from 74 to 197 cases of myocarditis in the same interval. The remarkable increased amount of case 
reports can possibly be due to enhanced reporting due to media attention.

Pericarditis  
In the O/E analyses, no conclusions can be drawn on the analyses of “pericarditis without myocarditis”, 
based on low case numbers. In the analyses of “pericarditis with or without myocarditis”, higher 
observed than expected were observed in the age group of males 18-29 years following the 2nd dose, a 
finding of borderline significance (lower bound of 95% CI>1), however with no adjustment for 
underreporting.   
A causality assessment was performed on all cases that were classified by the MAH as WHO Possible. 
The assessment included 18 cases, and case narratives were retrieved from EudraVigilance. The cases 
comprised 9 males and 9 females aged 20-89 years of age. Generally, the diagnostic basis for the 
reported events of pericarditis was poor; in many cases pericarditis is reported as an adverse event 
but the available information is rather incomplete regarding clinical findings and/or tests results and/or 
symptoms. Out of the 18 cases, three cases are considered WHO Possible, these are all in younger 
adults, age range 28-37 ys., of these 2 females after the 1st dose, and 1 male after the 2nd dose. 
There are 12 cases that were assessed as WHO Unlikely and 3 were WHO Unassessable.  
Based on assessment of the presented evidence, including cases of pericarditis, a causal association 
cannot be established. 
Myocarditis  
In the O/E analyses, an increased rate ratio of myocarditis was seen following the 2nd dose, primarily in 
men in the age group 18-29. For females, the absolute numbers were smaller, leading to higher 
uncertainties. An increased risk for females in the similar age group cannot be excluded.  
In addition to the analysis performed by the MAH, EMA has conducted an updated O/E analyses of 
EU/EEA data of myocarditis and myocarditis+pericarditis, with a DLP 13 June 2021. Both analyses 
showed a significantly increased OE ration in males aged 18-24, compared to background incidences of 
a European database including outcomes from primary and secondary care. 
Case narratives, considered by the MAH being of WHO Possible causality, and considered myocarditis 
Brighton definition 1-2 (n=14), were retrieved from Eudravigilance, and assessed for causality. Of the 
14 myocarditis cases, 7 cases were considered WHO Probable and 3 cases WHO Possible, 2 were found 
WHO Unlikely, and 2 cases were unclassifiable due to other health conditions. 
The 10 WHO Probable/Possible cases were all males aged 18-50 years of age and myocarditis was 
diagnosed 1-4 days after receiving the 2nd dose of the COVID-19-vaccine Moderna. None of the cases 
were fatal. The assessment of these cases indicates an association between Spikevax (previous 
COVID-19-vaccine Moderna) and myocarditis, with perceived symptoms and clinical findings within the 
first week after receiving the 2nd vaccination. Comparing to the nature of myocarditis there is no 
indication so far that myocarditis as a possible side effect to the vaccine should have a more severe 
course than otherwise seen.  
In addition, 3 literature articles including 6 case reports of Spikevax (previous COVID-19-vaccine 
Moderna) -myocarditis have been identified, supporting the causality. In all 6 cases the patients were 
hospitalized with chest pain and diagnosed with myocarditis by laboratory and cardiac magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) within 2-3 days of receiving mRNA-1273. Besides one patient aged 52 years, 
all cases involved younger patients of 21-31 years and otherwise healthy. Five cases were in males, 
and all cases were in relation to 2nd dose.

FDA and MHRA label updates 
On 23 June 2021, the CDC issued a press release regarding myocarditis and pericarditis following 
mRNA COVID-19 Vaccination (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-
ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html) and FDA has informed that myocarditis and pericarditis will be 
added to the label of Spikevax (25 June 2021: https://www.fda.gov/media/150387/download).  
On 25 June, 2021, the MHRA updated the label to include myocarditis and pericarditis: 
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-
moderna/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, based on the evidence provided, including OE analyses, pattern analysis, case series 
assessment and literature reports, a causal association between Spikevax (previous COVID-19 vaccine 
Moderna) and myocarditis is considered at least a reasonable possibility. Myocarditis is considered an 
important identified risk and should be further characterized in the ongoing and planned studies in the 
PhV plan of the RMP. 
An update of the SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8 is considered warranted, as well as the PIL section 2 and 4. 
In addition, distribution of a DHPC is considered warranted. 
Based on the data available during this assessment, the data regarding pericarditis is currently not 
sufficient to establish causality.  
3.4.  New information obtained after circulation of the preliminary 
assessment report 
 Two new relevant publications in JAMA on 29 June 2021:

Montgomery J, Ryan M, Engler R, et al. JAMA Cardiol. Published online June 29, 2021. 
doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2021.2833 
A total of 23 male patients (median [range] age, 25 [20-51] years) presented with acute onset of 
marked chest pain within 4 days after receipt of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. All military members 
were previously healthy with a high level of fitness. Seven received the BNT162b2-mRNA vaccine and 
16 received the mRNA-1273 vaccine. A total of 20 patients had symptom onset following the second 
dose. Among the 3 patients presenting after an initial vaccine dose, all had confirmed COVID-19 
infection more than 2 months prior to vaccination. Overall, 2 810 000 doses were administered; 
1 065 000 second doses were administered. Cardiac symptoms resolved within 1 week of onset for 16 
patients. Seven patients continued to have chest discomfort at the time of this report; follow-up is 
ongoing. This early report is also unable to describe longer-term outcomes among these patients.

DC, et al. JAMA Cardiol. Published online June 29, 2021. doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2021.2828 
In the 3-month period between February 1 and April 30, 2021, (at Duke University Medical Center), 4 
patients with acute myocarditis were identified, which occurred within 5 days of COVID-19 vaccination. 
Three were younger male individuals (age, 23-36 years) and 1 was a 70-year-old female individual. All 
4 had received the second dose of an mRNA vaccine (2 received mRNA-1273 [Moderna], and 2 
received BNT162b2 [Pfizer]). All presented with severe chest pain, had biomarker evidence of 
myocardial injury, and were hospitalized. Coincident testing for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses 
provided no alternative explanation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings were typical for 
myocarditis, including regional dysfunction, late gadolinium enhancement, and elevated native T1 and 
T2. The hospital courses for all 4 were uneventful without evidence of arrhythmias or heart failure, and 
treatment was conservative with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and colchicine, with 1 receiving 
corticosteroids. All were discharged within 2 to 4 days of hospitalization. 
Health Canada label update 
On 30 June 2021, Health Canada updated the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine labels to include information 
on myocarditis and pericarditis. https://covid-vaccine.canada.ca/info/pdf/covid-19-vaccine-moderna-
pm-en.pdf 
3.5.  Rapporteur’s proposed recommendation 
In conclusion, based on the evidence provided, a causal association between Spikevax (previous 
COVID-19 vaccine Moderna) and myocarditis is considered at least a reasonable possibility. 
An update of the SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8 is considered warranted, as well as the PIL section 2 and 4.  
Also, Myocarditis is considered as an important identified risk and should be further characterized in 
the ongoing and planned studies in the PhV plan, as appropriate. The RMP should be updated 
accordingly.  
In addition, based on the identification of this important risk, distribution of a DHPC is considered 
warranted. 
Proposed update of the product information: 
SmPC 4.4 
Cases of myocarditis have been reported following vaccination with Spikevax. The majority of these 
cases occurred within one week following the 2nd dose of vaccination, and mainly in men aged 30 years 
or younger. Currently, there is no indication that the cases have had a more severe course than 
otherwise seen for myocarditis. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of 
myocarditis. Those vaccinated should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they 
develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain or palpitations following vaccination.

PIL 2: 
Cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) have been reported after vaccination with Spikevax. 
The cases have primarily occurred within one week following the 2nd dose of vaccination, and mainly in 
men aged 30 years or younger. The patient should be alert to signs of myocarditis and seek medical 
attention if symptoms such as breathlessness, palpitations or chest pain occur.

Fully endorsements were received from MS1 and additional comments were received from eight other 
MSs and MAH:  
3.6.1.  Comments from other PRAC members 
3.6.1.1.  MS2 
We generally endorse the Rapporteur’s assessment however we have further comments to add: 
Based on the available evidences we consider that both myocarditis and pericarditis should be included 
in section 4.4 and 4.8. This is also supported by the recent label updates from Health Canada, FDA and 
MHRA. 
The dissemination of a DHPC is also supported. 
We also consider that the wording should be aligned for both mRNA vaccines and have the following 
suggestion: 
Section 4.4 Warnings and Precautions 
Very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed following vaccination with 
Spikevax. 
These cases have occurred predominantly in men aged 30 years or younger, and within one week after 
the second dose of the vaccine. These are typically mild cases and patients tend to recover within a 
short time following standard treatment and rest.  
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms 
indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, palpitations or 
arrhythmias, sometimes with accompanying fever and shortness of breath.

PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
The MS endorsement is appreciated and noted.  
The MS consider that the update also should include pericarditis, both in section 4.4 and 4.8. At 
present, the Rapporteur consider that the evidence is not sufficient to include pericarditis in 4.8, 
however, since cases of pericarditis have been reported after vaccination, and that myocarditis and 
pericarditis share clinical features, an update of section 4.4. is considered adequate.  
See section 3.7 for updated proposed wording for the SmPC. 
3.6.1.2.  MS3 
The PRAC Rapporteurs assessment is in general endorsed. However, we have the following additional 
comment; 
Pericarditis 
With regards to pericarditis, the PRAC Rapporteur conclude that ‘Based on the data available during this 
assessment, the data regarding pericarditis is currently not sufficient to establish causality’. Clearly 
separating pericarditis from myocarditis is challenging as the term pericarditis can refer to inflammation 
of the pericardium and myocarditis. In addition, myocarditis and pericarditis share clinical features and 
pathomechanisms. Therefore, inclusion of both terms in section 4.4 and 4.8 is considered warranted, in 
line with the label updates from MHRA, CDC and Health Canada. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
The MS endorsement is noted and appreciated. The MS proposes also to include pericarditis in 4.4 and 
4.8. The Rapporteur consider that the evidence is not sufficient to include pericarditis in 4.8, however, 
since cases of pericarditis have been reported after vaccination, and that myocarditis and pericarditis 
share clinical features, an update of section 4.4. is considered adequate.  
See section 3.7 for updated proposed wording for the SmPC. 
3.6.1.3.  MS4 
We fully support Rapp assessment and conclusions for this signal, but we would like to add the following 
considerations: 
The MAH should discuss if there are RMMs that could be identified in this younger population at higher 
risk of myocarditis, or the possibility to perform specific studies (ie. testing a lower vaccination dose?). 
The additional EMA analysis is very useful and informative. However, for future O/E analysis, 
estimations according to dose (1st and 2nd) will be valuable. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
The MS support is noted and appreciated. The MS suggest that the MAH should be requested to discuss 
if there are RMMs that could be identified in the younger population at higher risk of myocarditis, or 
the possibility to perform specific studies. The suggestion is agreed, see List of outstanding issues, 
section 3.8

COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna)  
EMA/PRAC/326194/2021 
Page 55/121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is also agreed that O/E analyses should preferably be stratified into 1st dose/2nd dose, when 
possible. 
3.6.1.4.  MS5 
In consistence with our previous position, a PI/RMP update is considered warranted. Also, a DHPC 
should be disseminated. 
In accordance with MS3 comments, and based on updated available information, besides an update of 
the SmPC section 4.4, an update of Section 4.8 is warranted for both myocarditis and pericarditis, in 
line with MHRA, CDC and Health Canada label updates. 
We also agree with the proposal from MS4 for the MAH to discuss if there are appropriate RMMs that 
could be identified in younger population at higher risk or studies to identify them. 
Based on available evidence, we consider that mRNA vaccines should be aligned. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
The MS support is noted and appreciated. The MS proposes also to include pericarditis in 4.4 and 4.8. 
The Rapporteur consider that the evidence is not sufficient to include pericarditis in 4.8, however, since 
cases of pericarditis have been reported after vaccination, and that myocarditis and pericarditis share 
clinical features, an update of section 4.4. is considered adequate.  
The MS suggest that the MAH should be requested to discuss if there are RMMs that could be identified 
in the younger population at higher risk of myocarditis. This is agreed to, please see section 3.8 for List 
of outstanding issues.  
3.6.1.5.  MS6 
We generally endorse Prac Rapp AR. We agree for the update of section 4.4 of the SmPC, the distribution 
of a DHPC and that risk of Myocarditis should be further characterized in the ongoing and planned studies 
in the PhV plan. However, we find the labelling in section 4.8 of Myocarditis with a frequency of “unknown” 
premature and would favour waiting for more investigations. 
In addition, we would suggest that an ad-hoc expert group of cardiologists would be very helpful for the 
next  steps  of  this  signal.  Indeed,  the  causality  is  especially  complex  to  analyse  and  none  of  the 
mechanisms  put  forward  by  the  MAH  to  explain  the  occurrence  of  myocarditis  after  mRNA  vaccine 
immunization  have  been  validated.  This  AHEG  might  also  be  helpful  to  reflect  on  risk  minimisation 
measures. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
The MS endorsement is noted and appreciated.  
It is considered that, based on the evidence provided, which includes a case series with a probable 
causality, several literature case reports and a supportive O/E analyses, that the evidence is sufficient 
to include “myocarditis” in section 4.8 of the SmPC, and accordingly in the PIL.  
The MS suggest to consult an expert group, which is agreed by the PRAC Rapporteur especially in the 
light of the expected increased exposure in the younger age groups.

3.6.1.6.  MS7 
We generally endorse the PRAC Rapporteurs assessment and have some additional comments. 
Pericarditis: based on available evidences, a possible causative role of the Spikevax vaccine cannot be 
excluded. Moreover, it’s difficult to clearly separating pericarditis from myocarditis, since both 
conditions share some pathophysiological mechanisms and some cases of myopericarditis and 
perimyocarditis have also been reported. Thus, we support the proposal to also include the term 
pericarditis in section 4.4 and 4.8. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
The endorsement is noted and appreciated. The MS suggest also to include pericarditis in 4.4 and 4.8. 
An inclusion of pericarditis in 4.4 is proposed in the updated recommendation, however the evidence is 
not considered sufficient to include pericarditis in 4.8 at this stage. 
3.6.1.7.  MS8 
We thank the PRAC Rapporteur for their careful assessment of the data. 
We support the proposals to update section 4.4 with a warning on myocarditis and to include 
myocarditis as an adverse reaction in section 4.8. Given the challenges in separating pericarditis from 
myocarditis and noting that cases considered possibly related to Spikevax have been identified, we 
consider that the warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC should include reference to pericarditis in addition 
to myocarditis, and that pericarditis should also be included as an adverse reaction in section 4.8. 
The data assessed do not seem to support inclusion of the statement “Currently, there is no indication 
that the cases have had a more severe course than otherwise seen for myocarditis.” We consider that 
the clinical course of cases particularly in terms of severity and time to resolution, in addition to 
information on treatments administered requires further characterisation in order to inform the 
appropriate PI wording. 
The dissemination of a DHPC to inform HCPs of the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in association 
with Spikevax is supported.  
Please find below our suggested amendments to the proposals for the SmPC and PL. 
SmPC section 4.4: 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
Very rare cCases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following vaccination with 
Spikevax. The majority of these cases of myocarditis occurred within one week following the 2nd 
dose of vaccination, and mainly in men aged 30 years or younger. Currently, there is no indication that 
the cases have had a more severe course than otherwise seen for myocarditis. Available data 
suggest resolution of symptoms within a short timeframe, however, information on 
potential long-term sequelae is not yet available. 
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis. Those vaccinated 
should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms such as shortness 
of breath, chest pain or palpitations following vaccination.

Very rare cCases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) have been reported after vaccination with 
Spikevax. The cases of myocarditis have primarily occurred within one week following the 2nd dose 
of vaccination, and mainly in men aged 30 years or younger. You should urgently seek medical 
attention if you experience new onset of symptoms such as chest pain, breathlessness, or 
feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart. The patient should be alert to 
signs of myocarditis and seek medical attention if symptoms such as breathlessness, palpitations or 
chest pain occur. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
The support is noted and appreciated. The MS suggest also to include pericarditis in 4.4 and 4.8. An 
inclusion of pericarditis in 4.4 is proposed in the updated recommendation, however the evidence is 
not considered sufficient to include pericarditis in 4.8 at this stage. 
It is agreed that information on treatments administered requires further characterisation in order to 
inform the appropriate PI wording. For updated wording, please refer to section 3.7 
3.6.1.8.  MS9 
The PRAC Rapporteur is thanked for a comprehensive report. The overall conclusions are endorsed. It 
is agreed that there is sufficient evidence for a causal relationship between myocarditis and vaccination 
with Comirnaty, and thus we support the inclusion of myocarditis in section 4.8.  
We would like to propose that the warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC and section 2 of the PL should be 
in line with that proposed for Comirnaty as provided below. If serious cases of myocarditis have been 
reported, it is suggested to add such information (see text marked in yellow below). 
SmPC Section 4.4  
Cases of myocarditis have been reported following vaccination with Spikevax. The majority of these 
cases occurred within one week following the 2nd dose of vaccination, and mainly in men aged 30 years 
or younger. Currently, there is no indication that the cases have had a more severe course than 
otherwise seen for myocarditis. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of 
myocarditis. Those vaccinated should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they 
develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain or palpitations following vaccination. 
Very rare cases of myocarditis have been observed following vaccination of Spikevax.  
These cases occurred predominantly in adolescents and young adults, more often in males than 
females, more often after the second dose of the vaccine, and typically within 14 days after vaccination 
(after the 2nd dose mostly within 6 days). Although, these are typically mild cases and individuals tend 
to recover within a short time following standard treatment and rest, occasional serious cases have 
been reported. 
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis. Vaccinees should 
be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis 
such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, sometimes with accompanying fever and shortness of 
breath. 
Healthcare professionals should consult applicable guidance and/or consult specialists (e.g. 
cardiologist) to diagnose and treat this condition.

Very rare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) have been reported after vaccination with

often after the 2nd vaccination. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis, such 
as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek medical attention should these occur. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
The MS endorsement is noted and appreciated. It is agreed that the wording should be aligned with 
Comirnaty, an updated proposal has been made.    
3.6.2.  Comment from the MAH 
Moderna disputes the characterisation of myocarditis as an important identified risk. Moderna 
proposes characterising myocarditis as an important potential risk. This conclusion is based on 
available data from ongoing clinical trials and post-authorisation safety information (including 
reports from public health and regulatory authorities) and is consistent with existing guidance. 
According to CoreRMP19 guidance v2.0i, “the list of important potential risks should include risks 
with potential impact on the risk/benefit balance, for which there is clinical and/or pre-clinical 
evidence suggesting a causal relationship with the vaccine, but for which the strength of the 
evidence does not (yet) allow to infer causality.” 
WHO (report received 10 June 2021) reviewed myocarditis in association with COVID-19 vaccines, and 
considers myocarditis “a potential serious adverse event following vaccination with the COVID-        
19 vaccines.”  According to the WHO report, the association between the event of myocarditis and  the 
COVID-19 vaccines was “better defined with the two mRNA vaccines of Pfizer-BioNTech and  Moderna, 
with disproportionate reporting and a possible dose-response relationship. This case series  did not 
establish causality of myocarditis by the mRNA vaccines.” 
In its review of the post-authorisation safety data, WHO noted that myocarditis has been observed 
following vaccination with the COVID-19 vaccines, with an apparent increased risk in adolescents and 
young adults based on temporal relationship, particularly after dose 2 of both the Pfizer-BioNTech  and 
Moderna vaccine. The cases of myocarditis tend to be mild and to resolve without sequelae. 
There seemed to be also a shorter time-to-onset (TTO) for cases following the second vaccine dose 
(median = 3 days, range = 0-22 days) compared to the first dose (median = 4 days, range = 0-34 
days). 
The ACIP/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reviewed currently available data on 
mRNA vaccines Benefit-Risk assessment on 23 June 2021. The ACIP stated: 
“The facts are clear: this is an extremely rare side effect, and only an exceedingly small 
number of people will experience it after vaccination. Importantly, for the young people who 
do, most cases are mild, and individuals recover often on their own or with minimal

COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna)

treatment. In addition, we know that myocarditis and pericarditis are much more common if 
you get COVID-19, and the risks to the heart from COVID-19 infection can be more severe.” 
The ACIP provided epidemiological analyses indicating cases of myocarditis observed with mRNA 
vaccines were more common in younger males, typically observed shortly after receipt of the second 
dose, and tended to be mild and self-limited. There was no biological explanation provided to  account 
for the epidemiological findings. 
The PRAC Preliminary Assessment Report (received 30 June 2021) which is based upon Moderna’s 
safety evaluation of myocarditis/pericarditis (submitted 21 June 2021), concluded that “based on the 
evidence provided, a causal association between Spikevax (previous COVID-19 vaccine Moderna) and 
myocarditis is considered at least a reasonable possibility.” 
At this time, in none of these reviews has causality been demonstrated. 
Characterization of the safety data from the Moderna clinical studies did not show an imbalance 
between the placebo group and the vaccination group. Indeed, no reports of myocarditis were 
observed in the Ph 3 trial of more than 15,000 subjects exposed to mRNA-1273. 
Moderna does not believe that the currently available data support inclusion of this finding as an 
important identified risk due to: 
D.  No cases of myocarditis were observed in the Ph 3 clinical trial in which more than 15,000 
subjects exposed to mRNA-1273. 
E.  Post-marketing data and low event rate (see below). 
F.  Current evidence relies overwhelmingly upon epidemiological evaluations. 
G.  Causality has not been demonstrated. 
Moderna is aware of the epidemiological findings that observe myocarditis disproportionately in 
younger males and most commonly shortly after receipt of the second dose of the vaccine. Moderna  is 
also aware that these cases tend to be mild and self-limited. 
For these reasons, Moderna believes that the available evidence supports inclusion of myocarditis as 
an important potential risk. 
SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8 
Moderna accepts to include myocarditis in Section 4.4 with the following edits:  Myocarditis 
Cases of myocarditis have been reported very rarely following vaccination with Spikevax, often in 
younger men and shortly after the second dose of the vaccine. These are typically mild cases and 
individuals tend to recover within a short time following standard treatment and rest. The majority of 
these cases occurred within one week following the second dose of vaccination, and mainly in men 
aged 30 years or younger. Currently, there is no indication that the cases have had a more severe 
course than otherwise seen for myocarditis. 
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis. Those 
vVaccinated individuals should be instructed to also seek immediate medical attention if they  develop 
symptoms such as shortness of breath, should they experience new onset of chest pain,  shortness of 
breath, or palpitations following vaccination or arrhythmias.

COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna)  
EMA/PRAC/326194/2021 
Page 60/121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Moderna does not accept the inclusion of myocarditis in section 4.8 (Undesirable effects) nor section 
4 of the PIL. 
The rationale for the edits to section 4.4 is as follows: 
D.  Evidence suggests cases are rare, mild and resolve without sequelae. There were no cases in 
the Ph 3 trial in which more than 15,000 subjects received mRNA-1273. The rate is therefore 
unknown and corresponds to the category of “very rare.” Our post-authorisation data indicate 
that as of 31 May 2021, 77 reports of myocarditis have been reported with more than 155 
million doses administered (0.5 cases per 1 million doses administered). Of the 77 reports, 
only  20 were evaluated as possible according to WHO causality assessment. The remainder 
were  considered as less than possible or unassessable. 
Shorter time to onset usually following second dose of vaccine. 
Symptoms of myocarditis are very common and are non-specific. Routine referral for medical 
attention would be expected to unnecessarily raise patient anxiety and burden the healthcare 
system. For example, an individual with asthma who receives the vaccine would be expected to 
receive medical care for an event such as an asthma attack that would typically be self- 
managed.

PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment:  
The MAH considers myocarditis as an important potential risk, and not an identified risk. This 
conclusion is based on  available data from ongoing clinical trials and post-authorisation safety 
information (including  reports from public health and regulatory authorities) and is consistent with 
existing guidance. The MAH refers to a WHO report dated 10 June 2021, stating that “this case series 
did not establish causality of myocarditis by the mRNA vaccines”, which is in contrast to the case 
series assessment presented in this report, where causality was concluded by the PRAC Rapporteur 
to be “at least of reasonable possibility”. Additionally, the MAH states that, according to the WHO, the 
cases of myocarditis tend to be mild and to resolve without sequelae. This could not be confirmed in 
the assessment of the case series in this report. The cases of myocarditis did not seem to be more 
severe than otherwise known, but as the outcome is unknown for most cases, it is not possible to 
make conclusions on severity until follow up measures are available in these cases.  
Further on, the MAH highlights that, according to the ACIP, “myocarditis and pericarditis are much 
more common if you get COVID-19, and the risks to the heart from COVID-19 infection can be more 
severe”. This is an important point that should be highlighted in the communication of the outcome of 
this signal, to ensure adequate and risk proportionate measures to be taken. Nevertheless, this fact 
does not diminish the importance of this rare side effect to be reflected in the product information.  
The MAH considers that causality has not been demonstrated. This is not agreed on. In this report, a 
case series with a WHO Probable causality is presented, these are cases with a strikingly consistent 
Signal assessment report on myocarditis and pericarditis with Spikevax (previously 
COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna)

pattern; short TTO (<5 days), 2nd dose, primarily young men, lack of confounders – features which 
are further supported by the O/E analyses and also by several published case series reports, further 
described in section 3.3 and 3.4 of this report.  
Finally, the MAH considers that myocarditis should not be considered an important identified risk, 
since no cases of myocarditis were observed in the phase 3 clinical trial in which more than 15,000 
subjects were exposed to mRNA-1273. To our knowledge, the phase 3 clinical trial included 11,415 
participants in the age group 18-64 years. It is unknown how many of these participants were in the 
age group <30 years, but if the participants were equally distributed among age, there would not be 
more than 3000 participants below the age of 30. A rare adverse event would therefore not 
necessarily be expected to occur in this setup. 
The PRAC Rapporteur maintains the position that the causality of Spikevax and myocarditis is 
considered to be “at least of reasonable possibility”, and an update of 4.4 and 4.8, and 
correspondingly in the PIL, is warranted.  
3.7.  Updated rapporteur's proposed recommendation  
In conclusion, based on the evidence provided, a causal association between Spikevax (previous 
COVID-19 vaccine Moderna) and myocarditis and pericarditis is considered at least a reasonable 
possibility. 
An update of the SmPC to include myocarditis in section 4.4 and 4.8 is considered warranted, as well 
as the PIL section 2 and 4. Also, an update of the SmPC to include pericarditis in section 4.4, and 
correspondingly in PIL section 2, is considered warranted. For proposed wording, see below. 
Also, Myocarditis is considered as an important identified risk, and pericarditis an important potential 
risk, and should be further characterized in the ongoing and planned studies in the PhV plan, as 
appropriate. The RMP should be updated accordingly.  
In addition, based on the identification of these new important risks, distribution of a DHPC is 
considered warranted. 
The MAH is also requested to respond to the issues listed in section 3.8. 
It is also proposed that an expert group should be consulted to reflect upon the mechanism of 
myocarditis/pericarditis, as well as risk minimisation measures, especially in the light of the expected 
increased exposure in the younger age groups. 
Proposed update of the product information:

Myocarditis and pericarditis 
Cases  of  myocarditis  have  been  reported  following  vaccination  with  Spikevax.  The  majority  of  these 
cases occurred within one week following the 2nd dose of vaccination, and mainly in men aged 30 years 
or younger. Currently, there is no indication that the cases have had a more severe course than otherwise 
seen for myocarditis. However, information on potential long-term sequalae is not yet available. 
Also, cases of pericarditis have been reported following vaccination with Spikevax. These cases have 
shown no specific tendencies regarding dose, time to onset, gender and age.

3.8.  List of outstanding issues 
Having considered the available evidence, the PRAC Rapporteur considers that more information is 
needed to fully characterize the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis with Spikevax (previous COVID-19 
Vaccine Moderna) and to further evaluate the potential risk minimization measures. Therefore, the 
MAH is requested to: 
- Make an evaluation upon the diagnostic criteria used for determining pericarditis, since it is not 
entirely clear on which basis the diagnosis was made from the information available in the cases. For 
comparison the myocarditis definition relies on the Brighton criterions.    
- propose how to further characterise the new important risks, including evaluation of the outcome 
(mild/severe/sequelae), in ongoing and future studies. 
Proposal of further routine risk minimization measures: 
- The MAH should consider specific clinical guidance, regarding the age group 30 years and younger 
(considering e.g. spacing between 1st and 2nd dose, dosage, revaccination/booster for this individual 
group).  
- The MAH should propose a recommendation (in SmPC 4.4) regarding clinical follow up of 
myocarditis/pericarditis cases, e.g. 3 months / 6 months clinical evaluation post event, including 
specific clinical measurements.

experience, the literature and from observed to expected analyses, the PRAC has agreed that based on 
the evidence assessed, a causal association between COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside-modified) 
Spikevax (previously COVID-19 vaccine Moderna) and myocarditis/pericarditis is considered of at least 
a reasonable possibility. The PRAC has agreed that the MAH for Spikevax (Moderna Biotech Spain, 
S.L.) should address the below recommendation: 
1. Product information update 
The MAH should submit by 12 July 2021, 9 a.m. CEST a variation to amend the product information as 
described below (new text underlined): 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
Section 4.4 – Special warnings and precautions for use: 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
Very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed following vaccination with Spikevax 
These cases have primarily occurred within 14 days following vaccination, more often after the second 
vaccination, and more often in younger men. Available data suggest that the course of myocarditis and 
pericarditis following vaccination is not different from myocarditis or pericarditis in general.  
Healthcare  professionals  should  be  alert  to  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  myocarditis  and  pericarditis. 
Vaccinees should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative 
of  myocarditis  or  pericarditis  such  as  (acute  and  persisting)  chest  pain,  shortness  of  breath,  or 
palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition.

Warnings and precautions 
Very rare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the 
lining outside the heart) have been reported after vaccination with Spikevax. The cases have primarily 
occurred  within  two  weeks  following vaccination,  more  often  after  the  second vaccination,  and more 
often occurred in younger men. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and 
pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention 
should these occur.  
Section 4 - Possible side effects

2. Direct healthcare professional communication (DHPC) 
The MAH should distribute a DHPC according to the text and communication plan agreed with the CHMP. 
3. Request for supplementary information 
The  MAH  should  provide  recommendations  for  administration  of  the  second  dose,  in  case  of  the 
occurrence  of  myocarditis/pericarditis  following  the  first  dose,  taking  into  account  the  totality  of  the 
available data, including relevant publications, by 02/08/2021.  
The PRAC will assess the answer within a 30-days timetable. 
4. Risk management plan (RMP) update 
The PRAC considered that myocarditis/pericarditis should be considered as an important identified risk 
in the RMP. The necessary RMP update should be submitted at the next regulatory opportunity. The risk 
should be further characterized in the ongoing and planned studies in the pharmacovigilance plan. The 
MAH should: 
a)  Propose how to further characterise the new important risk, including evaluation of the outcomes 
(e.g. mild/severe/sequelae); 
b)  Discuss any risk factors that could be identified, as well as the need and possibility to perform 
specific studies to investigate risk factors for myocarditis and pericarditis after Spikevax 
administration with the aim to implement measures to mitigate the risk. If appropriate, PI 
updates should be proposed. 
c)  Assure long term follow up of myocarditis and pericarditis cases in order to better characterize 
long term consequences. 
d)  Number of young patients included in the studies should assure timely characterisation of the 
risk in this population of special interest. 
4.  Additional evidence  
4.1.  Assessment of additional data  
ITEM 1: 
The MAH should provide recommendations for administration of the second dose, in case of 
the  occurrence  of  myocarditis/pericarditis  following  the  first  dose,  taking  into  account  the 
totality of the available data, including relevant publications, by 02/08/2021. The PRAC will 
assess the answer within a 30-days timetable. 
Sponsor Response: 
The MAH has no clinical data to inform this issue. It has not been evaluated in the clinical program.  
The MAH has conducted a cumulative review of the clinical studies and post-authorization safety data 
for  Spikevax,  as  well  as  literature  looking  for  safety  data  and  relevant  publications  related  to  the 
administration of the 2nd dose of Spikevax after the occurrence of myocarditis or pericarditis following

the  1st  dose  of  the  vaccine.  For  the  ongoing  clinical  studies  for  Spikevax,  having  myocarditis  or 
pericarditis after the 1st dose would had been a reason for study discontinuation. There were 2 reports 
of pericarditis in P301 in participants after they had received the 2nd dose of Spikevax. There have been 
no reports of myocarditis in any of the ongoing clinical trials for Spikevax. 
There were 15 different publications that were reviewed based on a search strategy that included “mRNA 
vaccines”;  “mRNA  vaccine  and  myocarditis/  pericarditis”;  “Moderna  mRNA  vaccine  myocarditis/ 
pericarditis”, etc.  There  was only  one  publication1  (an  editorial)  that  was  identified as discussing the 
occurrence of myocarditis after the administration of the 1st dose of mRNA-based vaccines. The authors 
cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance2 issued on 23 June 2021, which does not 
advise against vaccination and recommend that individuals who have experienced myocarditis — either 
from non-COVID-19 causes, from COVID-19 itself, or even from vaccination — discuss vaccination with 
their health care providers.  
Considering that the MAH has no clinical data and very limited post-authorization to characterize use of 
mRNA-1273 in this clinical setting, the MAH is not currently in a position to make a recommendation for 
receipt of a second dose among persons who have experienced myocarditis or pericarditis after the 1st 
dose  of  Spikevax.  Such  decisions  should  be  individualized  and  made  between  patients  and  their 
providers, incorporating potential benefit/risk at the individual level.

2 Clinical Considerations: Myocarditis and Pericarditis after Receipt of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Among Adolescents and Young Adults. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
The MAH has conducted a cumulative review of the clinical studies and post-authorization safety data 
for Spikevax, as well as literature, looking for safety data and relevant publications related to the 
administration of the 2nd dose of Spikevax after the occurrence of myocarditis or pericarditis following 
the 1st dose of the vaccine.  
In the clinical trials, no cases of myocarditis were detected, and the two cases of pericarditis both 
occurred after the 2nd dose.  
The MAH detected one relevant publication in their literature search, an opinion article by Murthy et al, 
dated 29 June 2021, published in the online news magazine “Stat”. The paper cites the CDC ACIP 
presentation of 23 June 2021, https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-
06/05-COVID-Wallace-508.pdf , where clinical considerations in people with a history of myocarditis or 
pericarditis is presented (slide 39 and below). Here, it is recommended that the 2nd dose of mRNA 
vaccine should be deferred if myocarditis occurred after the 1st dose, “until more information is 
known”, but also that the 2nd dose could be considered under certain circumstances, however it should 
be discussed with the patient, guardian and clinical team.

The authors of the opinion paper, Murthy et al., argue that caution should be employed for 
administering mRNA vaccines to individuals who experienced myocarditis after receiving a first dose. 
The authors further speculate that a single dose could be adequate, unless the individual is at high risk 
of complications from COVID-19. Also, the authors mention the possibility of smaller doses of vaccine 
as well as more widely spaced doses, although highlighting that the safety benefits of such measures 
are unclear.  
The Warning section of the FDA fact sheet of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, revised 24 Jun 2021, 
states that “the decision to administer the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine to an individual with a history of 
myocarditis or pericarditis should take into account the individual’s clinical circumstances”. 
In conclusion, no new data or information have been presented which could provide basis for an 
updated recommendation regarding the 2nd vaccination in persons experiencing myocarditis or 
pericarditis after the 1st dose.  
Until such evidence is provided, it is agreed that no further update of the product information is 
considered warranted at present. Clinical recommendations are currently made on national level. The 
MAH should keep this issue under close monitoring, and should suggest an update of the product 
information accordingly when new relevant information regarding administration of the 2nd dose in 
patients experiencing myocarditis or pericarditis after the 1st dose becomes available. 
4.2.  Rapporteur’s proposed recommendation 
In conclusion, no new data or information have been presented which could provide basis for an updated 
recommendation regarding the 2nd vaccination in persons experiencing myocarditis or pericarditis after 
the 1st dose.  
Until  such  evidence  is  provided,  it  is  agreed  that  no  further  update  of  the  product  information  is 
considered warranted at present. The MAH should keep this issue under close monitoring during routine

4.3.  Comments from other PRAC members  
Fully endorsements were received from four MSs and additional comments were received from MS5: 
4.3.1.  MS5 
The PRAC Rapporteurs assessment is in general endorsed. However, we have the following additional 
comments;  
The PRAC Rapporteur conclude that no new data or information have been presented which could provide 
basis for an updated recommendation regarding the 2nd vaccination in persons experiencing myocarditis 
or pericarditis after the 1st dose. 
Although several national authorities currently advise to defer the 2nd dose in case of 
myocarditis/pericarditis, a more detailed wording regarding dose 2 in section 4.4 of the SmPC and 
section 2 of the PIL is considered warranted, in line with the recommendation from Health Canada and 
CDC:   
‘As a precaution, individuals who experienced myocarditis and/or pericarditis after a first dose of an 
mRNA vaccine should wait to get their second dose until more information is available. The decision to 
administer dose 2 to an individual with a history of myocarditis or pericarditis should take into account 
the individual's clinical circumstances’. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment:  
The MS consider that a more detailed wording regarding dose 2 in section 4.4 of the SmPC and section 
2 of the PIL is warranted, in line with the recommendation from Health Canada and CDC.  
The position of the MS is acknowledged, however, the PRAC Rapporteur maintain the position that no 
update of the product information is warranted at present. The national authorities have guidelines 
based on their specific situation, both regarding vaccination coverage and present rate of infection. The 
MAH is keeping this issue under close monitoring, and continuously reports new information of 
myocarditis/pericarditis in the MSSRs. Also, further characterization of myocarditis and pericarditis will 
be addressed in the ongoing and planned additional pharmacovigilance studies as per EU RMP 
(assessment ongoing EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0028).  
Once new information arises, an updated warning could be considered.  
4.4.  Updated rapporteur's proposed recommendation  
In conclusion, no new data or information have been presented which could provide basis for an updated 
recommendation regarding the 2nd vaccination in persons experiencing myocarditis or pericarditis after 
the 1st dose.  
Until  such  evidence  is  provided,  it  is  agreed  that  no  further  update  of  the  product  information  is 
considered warranted at present. The MAH should keep this issue under close monitoring during routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. Once new relevant information become available regarding administration 
of the 2nd dose in patients experiencing myocarditis or pericarditis after the 1st dose, the MAH should 
suggest an update of the product information accordingly and without delay.

4.5.  Adopted PRAC recommendation 
Having considered the available evidence from the data provided by the Marketing Authorisation Holder 
(MAH),  the  PRAC  has agreed that  no  further changes  to  the previous  recommendation by PRAC  (i.e. 
updates to the product information and risk management plan) are warranted at this stage.  
The PRAC has agreed that the signal can therefore be closed, and that the MAH for Spikevax (Moderna 
Biotech Spain, S.L.) should continuously monitor this topic within the MSSR-submissions. As soon as 
new relevant information becomes available, the MAH should further characterise this risk and suggest 
updates of the product information accordingly and without delay.

5.1.  Annex I – Assessment of myocarditis and pericarditis in the 4th MSSR 
of Moderna 
Request: 
On 5 May 2021, the company received the following request from the PRAC: 
“The MAH is requested to evaluate the safety topic of myocarditis and pericarditis, including comment 
on the reports of myocarditis cases in Israel and among US military personnel following vaccination 
with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines reported in various media (https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-said-
probing-link-between-pfizer-shot-and-heart-problem-in-men-under-30/ and 
https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/04/26/pentagon-tracking-14-cases-of-heart-inflammation-
troops-after-covid-19-shots.html).  
The MAH is requested to provide a cumulative review of myocarditis and pericarditis, from all 
available sources. In the cumulative review, the MAH should provide at least but not limited to the 
following:  
•  A tabulated overview of all cases stratified by 1) Age; 2) Gender; 3) Time-to onset.  
•  A summary overview of the serious cases 1) for which the causality (as per WHO-UMC causality 
assessment system) is considered at least possible or probable; and 2) for which the role of the 
vaccine cannot be excluded.  
The summary overview should include the following details for each case:  
o  Patient’s age and gender.  
o  EVDAS/Eudravigilance case ID. 
o  Associated clinical signs/co-reported PTs.  
o  Any underlying condition(s) (including COVID-19) or other confounders.  
o  Time to onset, and whether following the 1st or 2nd dose.  
o  Outcome.  
o  Assessment of the causal relationship with the vaccine.   
• 
•  Based on their review of the cases, the MAH should discuss any plausible mechanisms and whether 
any risk factors could be identified.  
In conclusion, the MAH should discuss the need to update the product information, including relevant 
risk minimisation measures. Also, in the next MSSR, the MAH is requested to present more in-depth 
O/E analyses of AESIs Myocarditis and Pericarditis, including O/E analyses stratified by age and 
gender. The MAH should ensure that the most relevant background incidence rates are selected and 
used for comparison, e.g. based on the origin of the cases. A justification for the selected IR should be 
provided.” 
Company response: 
1.  Background 
Myocarditis is identified as an inflammatory disease of the heart muscle cells and is pathologically 
identified by conventional histology and immunohistochemical techniques as an infiltration of 
mononuclear cells to the myocardium. Myocarditis can be acute, subacute, or chronic and may either 
involve focal or diffuse areas of the myocardium. Endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard for 
in vivo diagnosis of myocarditis. A recent update to the definition of myocarditis has been discussed by 
Caforio et al in defining myocarditis, using immunohistochemical data, as individuals who exhibit ≥14 
lymphocytes/mm2 including ≤4 monocytes/mm2 with the presence of CD3-positive T lymphocytes ≥7 
cells/mm.2 It is imperative to rule out other possible causes, specifically acute ischemia1.  
Myocarditis is an under-diagnosed cardiac disease resulting from any one of a broad range of 
infectious, immune, and toxic causes. Most cases of myocarditis are caused by infectious agents, toxic 
substances, drugs or autoimmune disorders. Hence, it is increasingly recognized that myocarditis is an 
inflammatory condition of the myocardium triggered by various factors rather than a distinct 
cardiovascular disease. Infectious causes include viruses, bacteria, Chlamydia, rickettsia, fungi, and 
protozoa. Noninfectious triggers have been identified such as toxins, auto immunes disease and 
hypersensitive reactions. Numerous medications like antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine), antibiotics 
(penicillin, ampicillin, sulfonamides, tetracyclines), and antiphlogistic (e.g., mesalamine) can induce

hypersensitivity eosinophilic myocarditis. Myocarditis has been reported following many different 
vaccines including flu vaccine, however the smallpox vaccine has the strongest association. During the 
influenza epidemic of the winter 1998-1999 there were several reports of patients who had preceding 
flu-like symptoms and fever and developed cardiac involvement between 4 and 7 days after the onset 
of influenza symptoms2.2. 
Viral myocarditis is thought to be the most frequent type, mostly affecting children and young adults3. 
A recent study using International Classification of Diseases codes estimated the global prevalence of 
myocarditis to be ≈22 of 100 000 patients annually. Approximately 1% to 5% of patients that test 
positive for acute viral infection(s) may exhibit a form of myocarditis. Nowadays, the prevalence of 
myocarditis has been reported from 10.2 to 105.6 per 100,000 worldwide, and its annual occurrence is 
estimated at about 1.8 million cases. The incidence of confirmed myocarditis secondary to smallpox 
vaccination was estimated to be 16.1 per 100 000 service members, with a recent Department of 
Defense study estimating 12 per 100 000 in a review of 730 000 service members. Most studies of 
acute myocarditis report a greater prevalence and severity in male patients, speculated to be caused 
by a protective effect of natural hormonal influences on immune responses in women when compared 
with men. Patients are usually between the ages of 20 and 50. Acute myocarditis and hyperthyroidism 
are also common diseases that often present in young, otherwise healthy patients. Autoimmunity is 
central to the pathogenesis of both4. 
As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly expanded as a global pandemic caused by severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, some COVID-19 patients that were hospitalized developed 
an acute COVID-19 cardiovascular syndrome, which can manifest with a variety of clinical 
presentations but often presents as an acute cardiac injury with cardiomyopathy, ventricular 
arrhythmias, and hemodynamic instability in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. The 
cause of this injury is uncertain but is suspected to be related to myocarditis, microvascular injury, 
systemic cytokine-mediated injury, or stress-related cardiomyopathy. Although histologically unproven, 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has the potential to directly replicate within 
cardiomyocytes and pericytes, leading to viral myocarditis. 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comments: 
Myocarditis is an inflammatory condition of the myocardium which can be triggered by various 
factors besides a distinct cardiovascular disease. Most common cause of myocarditis are infectious 
agents, toxic substances, drugs or autoimmune disorders. Viral myocarditis is thought to be the 
most frequent type. The global prevalence of myocarditis is estimated to be approximately 22 per 
100 000 patients annually. Higher prevalence and severity of acute myocarditis have been observed  
in male patients between the ages of 20 and 50.

Acute pericarditis is an inflammatory process involving the pericardium that results in a clinical 
syndrome characterized by chest pain, pericardial friction rub, changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) 
and occasionally, a pericardial effusion. Generally, the diagnosis requires 2 of these 3 features. 
Epidemiologic data on the incidence of acute pericarditis are lacking, likely because this condition is 
frequently inapparent clinically, despite its presence in numerous disorders6. However, it appears to be 
the most common form of pericardial disease and a relatively common cause of chest pain. Acute 
pericarditis is the most common affliction of the pericardium. It is diagnosed in approximately 0.1% of 
patients hospitalized for chest pain and in 5% of patients admitted to the emergency department for 
chest pain unrelated to acute myocardial infarction (MI). Although acute pericarditis occurs in all age 
groups and in men and women, it presents most often in men 20 to 50 years of age. The most 
common form of acute pericarditis is idiopathic, which accounts for about 90% of cases. Other 
common causes include infection, renal failure, myocardial infarction (MI), post-cardiac injury 
syndrome, malignancy, radiation, and trauma. Acute pericarditis is more common in men than in 
women. However, although this condition is more common in adults than in children, adolescents are 
more commonly affected than young adults.

2.  Methods: 
The company clinical database and the global safety database were queried for valid, clinical and 
spontaneous case reports received from HCP, HA, consumers and literature, cumulative from 18 
December 2020 to 30 April 2021, worldwide, reported for the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna COVID-19 
vaccine Moderna) using the following Preferred Terms (PTs): “Viral pericarditis; Pericarditis; 
Pericarditis infective; Myocarditis; Myocarditis septic; Myocarditis infectious; Viral 
myocarditis; and Myocarditis post-infection”. The clinical trial data is from the Phase 3 clinical trial 
mRNA- 1273 P301. 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comments: 
The MAH’s search strategy and used preferred terms are considered acceptable. 
As of 30 April 2021, 182,568,555 doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine had been distributed worldwide, an 
a total of 119,066,486 doses of the vaccine had been administered based on information retrieved

Figure 2. COVID-19 Vaccines Administered by Age and Sex, United States (as of 30 April 
2021)  
In order to calculate observed reporting rates, a risk window of 21 days was assigned after each 
administered vaccine dose. This window was selected for consistency with analyses conducted by the 
US Vaccine Safety Datalink. The sum of all person-time was then used as a denominator to calculate 
the reporting rate. ACCESS or literature based expected rates were then multiplied by the same 
person-time estimate to identify the count of expected cases.  
Because a large majority of both doses administered and reported events were identified in the US, we 
applied the US age distribution shown above to the total doses of vaccine administered and 
corresponding person-time accrued. Age-specific incidence rates identified from ACCESS or other 
published literature were then used to ascertain expected cases within each category. Where age 
groups used in sources of background incidence did not align with the available grouping for 
population-based vaccine administration, we conservatively chose the lower rate of adjacent categories 
to produce more conservative expected case counts.   
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comments: 
The MAH’s approach to use the US vaccination age and gender distribution for the O/E analyses is 
considered acceptable. Even though this data is not vaccine specific, this is considered the closest 
estimate available for the exposure in the different age groups. 
3.  Observed/ Expected: 
Myopericarditis 
Population-based data characterizing the incidence of myocarditis in the US are limited, however 
studies have been conducted considering myocarditis as an adverse event following immunization. In 
the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), for example, a retrospective study based on administrative data 
was conducted to assess the occurrence of myopericarditis following live viral vaccination.  The study 
investigators calculated incidence (after excluding about half the potential cases originally identified

from the automated data - due largely to miscoded or unverifiable diagnoses). In this assessment, the 
self-controlled risk interval analysis found that, based on one case identified during the risk interval 
and 10 cases during the control interval, there is no increased risk of myopericarditis in the 42 days 
following vaccination (IRR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.07, 4.51). The study suggests that the occurrence of 
myopericarditis following live viral vaccination is rare with an estimated incidence of 0.24 per 100,000 
vaccinated, which is not higher than the background rate and is much lower than the incidence rates 
reported following smallpox vaccination. The risk interval was defined as the 42-day window following 
measles-mumps-rubella, varicella, oral polio, or yellow fever vaccination; the control interval was 
defined as the time period 85 to 365 days following vaccination. The study investigators censored a 
‘wash out’ period of 43 to 84 days after vaccination. The selected 42-day exposure window was based 
on prior smallpox vaccination investigations that suggested these cardiac events developed soon after 
vaccination at a mean onset time of 10 days..7 In that control period, 10 cases were observed between 
days 85-365 after vaccination in 416,629 patients, an incidence of 3.13 per 100,000 person-years. 
Compared to this rate, the observed number of myocarditis/pericarditis cases after administration of 
the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine were within the expected range (84 cases observed vs 214 expected), 
with a rate ratio suggesting that sensitivity of the reporting rate would need to be below 23% for a 
possible increase in risk to be masked by low reporting. 7 In that control period, 10 cases were 
observed between days 85-365 after vaccination in 416,629 patients, an incidence of 3.13 per 100,000 
person-years. Compared to this rate, the observed number of myocarditis/pericarditis cases after 
administration of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine were within the expected range (84 cases observed 
vs 214 expected), with a rate ratio suggesting that sensitivity of the reporting rate would need to be 
below 23% for a possible increase in risk to be masked by low reporting.

PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comments: 
In the combined O/E analysis for the cases of myocarditis and pericarditis, the expected incidence 
rate of 3.13 per 100,000 person-years was used, based on the retrospective study by VSD in 
416,629 patients. Data used for this study was validated prior to the calculation of the incidences, 
thus approximately a half of the potential cases had been excluded, mainly due to miscoding or 
unverifiable diagnoses.  
In this combined O/E analysis, the observed rate was below the expected. Also, when taking into 
consideration the possible underreporting, as it is considered less likely that underreporting of the 
myocarditis and pericarditis events is as high as 60%-70% which would be needed to reach the 
expected number of cases. 
Myocarditis 
7The estimated incidence of Myocarditis is between 10 to 20 cases per 100,000 persons, however 
underdiagnosis is recognized as common8,9. Most studies report a higher incidence in men than 
women10,11, with mean age lower for men (34.3 vs. 49 years)12. In the Global Burden of Disease study 
in 2013, the age standardized incidence was identified as 22.0 (95% CI 20.5-23.6).13 
The ACCESS project has recently characterized the incidence of myocarditis in European populations, 
and estimates vary by country, ranging from 0.33/100,000 person-years in Spain to 21.34/100,000 
person-years in Italy. Unlike identified US-based estimates, ACCESS includes stratification by age and 
gender. Given alignment with the estimated incidence from population-based studies,6,7  and the US

VSD estimate, incidence rates from Spain (FISABIO), the United Kingdom (CPRD) and Italy (ARS) were 
used to generate the expected number of myocarditis cases in our analysis. Overall, observed rates did

PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comments: 
According to the MAH, the population-based data characterizing the incidence of myocarditis in the 
US are limited. As US data did not include stratification by age and gender, the MAH has chosen 
ACCESS incidence rates comparable with the above mentioned VSD incidence rate (3.13 per 
100,000 PYs) and global prevalence (22 per 100,000 PYs). The MAH’s approach is considered 
acceptable. 
It is not quite clear where (which version of ACCESS draft report) the referred ACCESS incidence 
rates are obtained from. For future submission, the MAH should note that updated (v1.2) draft 
ACCESS report is now available through EnCEPP: https://vac4eu.org/wp-
content/uploads/2021/05/D3_ACCESS_Report_BGR_20210430_v.1.2_submitted.pdf  
Also, all ACCESS AESI background rates are now available from VAC4EU Dashboard: 
https://vac4eu.org/covid-19-tool/ 
The MAH should clearly state from which source the used IRs were retrieved. 
Stratifying by age, observed rates were below expected rates for subgroups except for males ages 18-
29, where the observed reporting rate of 4.77 cases per 100,000 person-years was nearly identical to 
the expected rate from Spain (4.54) and the UK (4.68/100,000 person-years), and substantially lower 
than the rate from Italy (28.24/100,000 person-years). Young women (18-29) had a higher reporting 
rate than the expected in Spain only. Given that perfect sensitivity of the reporting rate is unlikely, this 
may reflect an increase in risk for this group if the true background rate is better aligned with the UK 
population than the Italian population-based estimate. Alternatively, it is possible that not all reported 
cases are true myocarditis, as was seen in the VSD study referenced above.

Age and gender stratified O/E analyses showed observed rates close to expected rates in males 
aged 18-29 (rate ratios 1.05 (0.55, 2.00); FISABIO 2017; and 1.02 (0.54, 1.93); CPRD 2018) and 
males aged 30-39 (rate ratio 0.73 (0.31, 1.71); FISABIO 2017) when compared with the low 
background IRs.  This could indicate a potential increased risk in these populations, as some degree 
of underreporting is likely.

Similar findings as in males were seen in females aged 18-29, 30-39 and 40-49, however, these 
observed rates were based on a low number of cases and thus should be interpreted with caution. 
Pericarditis 
The MAH was able to fine few estimates of the incidence of pericarditis. Sources describing the 
incidence of pericarditis specifically in the US were not identified, and the individual condition is not 
described by the ACCESS study. However, some data in Europe have been published. A prospective 
clinical cohort study in Italy identified an incidence of 27.7 cases per 100,000 person-years.14 Another 
study, a retrospective analysis of Finnish registry data capturing admissions to 29 hospitals over a 
span of 9.5 years identified an age standardized incidence of 3.32 per 100,000 person-years, with 
higher rates in men ages 16-65.15 Figures showing the age distribution of pericarditis cases in this 
study are shown in Figure 3.14 Another study, a retrospective analysis of Finnish registry data 
capturing admissions to 29 hospitals over a span of 9.5 years identified an age standardized incidence 
of 3.32 per 100,000 person-years, with higher rates in men ages 16-65.15 Figures showing the age 
distribution of pericarditis cases in this study are shown in Figure 3.

Overall, there were 41 pericarditis cases observed in the MAH global safety database through 30 April 
2021. Based on incidence rates from the two studies noted above, 225-1896 cases would be expected.

PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comments: 
As no pericarditis specific data from the ACCESS IRs is available, the MAH based their O/E analyses 
on published data from a prospective clinical cohort study in Italy reporting an incidence of 27.7 
cases per 100,000 person-years, and a retrospective analysis of Finnish registry data reporting an 
Signal assessment report on myocarditis and pericarditis with Spikevax (previously

age standardized incidence of 3.32 per 100,000 person-years. The MAH’s approach is considered 
acceptable. 
O/E analyses based on these IRs and without age- or gender stratification showed lower observed 
than expected rates. 
In the absence of publications offering more precise incidence estimates by age and sex group, 
approximations of the expected rate were derived based on Figure 2 produced by Kytö et al shown 
above.  
For males, all observed rates were below the expected:

It is expected that these background rates are highly conservative as the Finnish study from which 
they were drawn captured primarily hospitalization data, which is, by definition, unlikely to detect 
(presumably) less severe cases not resulting in hospitalization. Given that the Italian data suggested a 
much higher rate, the sensitivity of the rates used in age stratification is likely to be poor. 
Assuming that the distribution of incidence by age and sex identified in the data from Finland are 
applicable to the Italian population, the rate for females ages 30-39 would have been approximately 
8.39, which would have created an expectation of 39.3 cases compared to the 5 observed (rate ratio 
0.12, 95% CI 0.05-0.31). 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comments: 
Age- and gender-stratified O/E analyses in males showed lower observed than expected rates and 
indicated apparently no increased risk. 
In females aged 30-39 showed observed rates close to expected rates. However, the Italian data 
suggested a much higher overall rate, and as IRs from the Finnish study were primarily based on 
hospital data, this finding should be interpreted with caution. 
4.  Results: 
a.  Clinical Trials information 
During the Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial of the mRNA-1273 P301, in the safety set, up to 28 days after 
any vaccination, there were 15,184 participants exposed to the mRNA-1273 vaccine, and 15,166 
participants in the placebo arm. There were 6,823 (22.5%) unsolicited treatment-emergent adverse 
event (TEAEs) reported, 3,234 (21.3%) in the placebo arm, and 3,589 (23.6%) in the mRNA vaccine 
arm. There were no reported TEAEs of “Myocarditis” in P301. There were three (3) unsolicited TEAE of 
“Pericarditis” reported in P301; two TEAEs in the Placebo arm, and one in the Vaccine arm of the safety 
set in the overall stage after any injection. The 2 events in the placebo arm were reported in the >18 
to <65 years of age, and the event in the vaccination arm was reported in the >65 years of age group 
(Table 2).   
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comments: 
No imbalance was seen in the clinical trial (P301). No cases of myocarditis were reported in P301. 
Concerning pericarditis, 2 cases were reported in the placebo arm; and 1 case in the vaccine arm.

Table 2. 
b.  Global Safety Database information: 
The company global safety database was queried for spontaneous, valid, case reports received from 
HCP, HA, literature, and consumers, cumulatively (18 December 2020 to 30 April 2021), worldwide, 
using the PTs of “Viral pericarditis; Pericarditis; Pericarditis infective; Myocarditis; Myocarditis 
septic; Myocarditis infectious; Viral myocarditis; and Myocarditis post-infection””. As of 30 
April 2021, there have been 182,568,555 doses of the mRNA vaccine distributed worldwide. 
A review of the spontaneous reports from the company’s global safety identified 84 case reports (0.1% 
of all cases reported to the MAH) with the PTs of Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis. There were 49 cases 
(0.1% of all cases) reported with Myocarditis-related PTs, and 41 cases (0.04% of all cases) with 
Pericarditis-related PTs. There were 6 cases (0.01% of all cases) that reported both events of 
Myocarditis and Pericarditis-related PTs. All 84 reports were considered serious reports. 
Most of the reports concerned males (65.9%), and in individuals between the ages of 18 to 39 years of 
age (45; 52.9%).

happened during the first 24 hours after receiving the Moderna mRNA vaccine (31, 36.5%) with 7 
females (4 after the 1st dose and 3 after the 2nd dose), 23 males (6 after the 1st dose, and 17 after the 
2nd dose) and 1 unknown gender report after the 1st dose. Most of those reports were in the 18 to 39 
years old group (14, 16.5%), with 3 were females (all 3 had the event after their 2nd dose of the 
Moderna COVID-19 vaccine) and 11 males with 4 reporting the event after the 1st dose and 7 after 
their 2nd dose.

The MAH identified 84 case reports with the PTs of Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis from their safety 
database, of which 49 cases with Myocarditis-related PTs, and 41 cases with Pericarditis-related PTs. 
There were 6 cases that reported both events of Myocarditis and Pericarditis-related PTs. All 84 
reports were considered serious reports. 
The majority of the myocarditis and/or pericarditis cases were in males (55/84; 65.9%), and in 
individuals between the ages of 18 to 39 years of age (45/84; 52.3%). When looking at myocarditis 
separately, there were 35/49 (71.4%) cases in males, and 33/49 (67.3%) in individuals with age 
18-39 years. The majority of the reports were from the USA (76; 90.6%). A total of 8 myocarditis 
and/or pericarditis cases were reported in the EEA; of these 5 concerns myocarditis and 3 
pericarditis. 
When looking at TTO, the most of the reports are with TTO within the first 24 hours (31/84; 
36.5%). Of these cases, 7/31 were in females with almost equal distribution between doses (4 after 
the 1st dose and 3 after the 2nd dose), and 23/31 in males with most cases following the 2nd dose 
(6 after the 1st dose, and 17 after the 2nd dose). There was 1 case following the 1st which did not 
report gender. 
In total, 14 of the cases (TTO<24h) were in the 18 to 39 years old group (14/31), with 3 females 
(all after 2nd dose) and with 11 males (4 after the 1st dose; 7 after 2nd dose). 
A total of 20 cases were reported with TTO 2-3 days, of these 10 cases were in age group 18-29. 
However, the MAH did not provide additional information on these cases regarding gender or dose. 
A higher number of cases in males, and in age below < 40 may be expected as prevalence in the 
general population exhibits a similar pattern with a highest prevalence in young males between 20-
50 years of age. The total number of events following the 2nd dose is not clear from the provided 
data, however when looking into the events occurring within 24 hours, 10 events are reported after 
1st dose, and 20 after the 2nd dose. Considering the lower exposure in 2nd dose receivers, compared 
to 1st dose, it indicates that the event is occurring more frequent following 2nd dose. The MAH did 
not further discuss this finding. Importantly, there can be a difference between events of 
myocarditis and pericarditis as discussed later in this section.   
Most of the events for which the event outcome was reported showed not recovered/ not resolved 
(34.1%) followed by recovered/ resolved (23.5%). The majority of the events of Myocarditis were 
recovered/ resolved (30%) and for Pericarditis most of the events were reported as not recovered/ 
resolved (46.3%). (See Table 6). The same reporting trend was observed according to age (see Table 
7) with the >65 years of age reporting the majority of the not recovered/ recovered event outcome, 
and the 40 to 49 years of age reporting most of the recovered/ resolved event outcome. Most of the 
spontaneous reports included in the MAH global safety database are obtained from regulatory 
authorities. This preclude the MAH to obtain follow-up information for the cases reported. It is also 
important to note that the reports are usually provided to the regulatory authorities usually when the 
patient was admitted to the hospital or recently discharged hence the fact that most of the events have 
a “not resolved” reported outcome.

PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comments: 
It is acknowledged that ‘Not Recovered/Not Resolved’ likely reflects the lack of follow-up at present, 
rather than that events have an outcome not resolved/recovered. 
There was one fatal case reported (3). This report (See Table 9) described a 60-69 year old male who 
developed acute myocardial infarction, chest pain, dyspnea, pericarditis and died. The patient’s medical 
history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous event of pericarditis. Concomitant 
medications were not provided. The patient reported the events of severe chest pain and dyspnea 
approximately 9 days following the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. The next day, 
according to the family the symptoms were most severe, and he was going to seek medical attention, 
but he did not. He purchased OTC acetaminophen for relief of symptoms. Symptoms of dyspnea and 
chest pain continued for 8 additional days, when he called the emergency service complaining of chest 
pain and was found to have a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient subsequently 
died the next day. It was unknown if an autopsy was performed. The company assessment for this

case is that it is heavily confounded by the patient’s previous (pericarditis, hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia) and concurrent medical history (acute MI). According to the WHO-UMC causality 
assessment the case is considered possible given that there is a temporal relationship to the 
occurrence of the event after vaccination but the previous and concurrent medical history are a more 
plausible explanation for the occurrence of the event of pericarditis.  
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comments: 
The MAH’s conclusion is acknowledged. The presented fatal case is confounded by the prior and 
concurrent medical history.  
Regarding documented previous medical history, there were 4 cases that reported previous COVID-19 
infection (5.9%) with these reports in the 18 to 39 years of age group. There were 5 reports of 
previous Myocarditis/ Pericarditis medical history (5.9%), 14 reports of cardiovascular conditions 
(16.5%), 5 with Thyroid conditions (5.9%), and 12 (14.1%) had previous medical histories of allergy-
type conditions including history of anaphylaxis. (See Table 8)

Coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2) have been associated with viral pneumonia with additional 
extrapulmonary manifestations and complications as well as high inflammatory burden that can induce 
vascular inflammation, myocarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias16. A significant proportion of patients that 
have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 have underlying cardiovascular disease and/or cardiac risk 
factors. Factors associated with mortality include male sex, advanced age, and presence of 
comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and cerebrovascular 
diseases. Acute cardiac injury determined by elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels is commonly 
observed in severe cases and is strongly associated with mortality. Acute respiratory distress 
syndrome is also strongly associated with mortality.  
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comments: 
No clear risk factors, or patterns or trends could be identified from the provided overview of medical 
history.

A recent publication, Garcia et al. (2021)1 concerned a case of myocarditis in a 30-39-year-old male, 
with a past medical history of auto-immune conditions who developed suspected acute 
myopericarditis 6 hours post vaccination with the second dose of mRNA vaccine. In this case, of a 
patient with a past medical history of asthma, autoimmune hypothyroidism, and chronic atrophic 
gastritis, the authors hypothesized that the vaccine may have been the trigger of an autoimmune 
reaction manifesting as acute myocarditis. 
For the next MSSR, the MAH is requested to comment the literature case report by Garcia et al. and 
discuss the proposed mechanism (Bautista García J,et al.Acute myocarditis after administration of 
theBNT162b2 vaccine against COVID-19. Rev Esp Cardiol. 2021. 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rec.2021.04.005) 
The MAH emphasized that SARS-CoV-2 have been associated with viral pneumonia with additional 
extrapulmonary manifestations including myocarditis. It is acknowledged that a high proportion of 
the vaccinated persons may have previous history of COVID-19 infection, in addition to few cases 
which reported COVID-19 infection as medical history. However, only a recent or concurrent 
infection should be considered as a confounder or a risk factor for the development of 
myocarditis/pericarditis.  
Unless a further characterization of the latency from infection to onset of event is presented for each 
case, it cannot be a general conclusion that the events of myocarditis/pericarditis can be explained 
by previous possible COVID-19 infection.

i.  Myocarditis cases: 
Analysis of the 49 cases that reported events of Myocarditis using the WHO-UMP standardized case 
causality assessment17 revealed that there were 4 reports (8% of the Myocarditis cases) classified as 
“Possible” events. There were 3 males and 1 female. Their ages were between 19 and 59 years of age. 
The reported TTO was between 0 days and 4 days (Mean 3 days). A summary of these events is 
provided below (See Table 9). 
The rest of the 49 cases that reported Myocarditis, twelve cases (24%) were classified as 
“Conditional”; 17 cases (34%) were classified as “Unassessable/ Unclassifiable”; and 15 (30%) were 
classified as “Unlikely”.  
The “Conditional” cases were reported in 7 males, 4 females, and 1 unknown. Their ages were between 
18 to 59 years of age; 5 cases were reported after the 1st dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, and 
7 after the 2nd dose of the vaccine.  TTO was between same day to 11 days after the vaccine (Mean 
3.8 days). These events had reports of myocarditis occurring after receiving the vaccine but important 
information necessary to conduct an appropriate causality assessment were missing, including previous 
and concurrent medical history, previous and concurrent medications, course of the current disease, 
and in one case age and sex as well as TTO was missing. 
The 17 cases that were classified as “Unassessable/ Unclassifiable” were reported in 15 males, 2 
females  and 1 unknown between 18 and 49 years of age; 9 cases were reported after the 1st dose, 
and 7 after the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. TTO was between same day to 23 days

(Mean 4.1 days). These events had reports of myocarditis occurring after receiving the vaccine but 
important information necessary to conduct an appropriate causality assessment were missing, 
including previous and concurrent medical history, previous and concurrent medications, course of the 
current disease, and in several cases age, sex, dose number, as well as TTO was missing. 
The 15 cases that were classified as “Unlikely” were reported in 9 males, and 6 females between 18 
and 69 years of age; 9 cases were reported after the 1st dose, and 6 after the second dose of the 
Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. TTO was between same day to 2 months and 17 days (Mean 6.9 days). 
These events had reports of myocarditis occurring after receiving the vaccine but the reports are 
heavily confounded by concurrent medical history (COVID-19 infection, Influenza, cardiovascular 
disorders, asthma, hyperthyroidism) as well as concurrent medications that are currently labeled for 
serious cardiovascular events including myocarditis (amphetamines, statins, etc.). 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comments: 
The MAH has performed causality assessment of the 49 cases of Myocarditis. Of these, 29 cases 
were classified as either “Conditional” or “Unassessable”, due to limited information. Of these, 14 
were reported after the 1st dose, and 14 after the 2nd dose (one case with no dose information). 
15 cases were classified as “Unlikely”. Nine cases were reported after the 1st dose, and 6 after the 
2nd dose. According to the MAH, these cases were confounded by concurrent medical history 
(COVID-19 infection, Influenza, cardiovascular disorders, asthma, hyperthyroidism) as well as 
concurrent medications that are currently labelled for serious cardiovascular events including 
myocarditis (amphetamines, statins). To consider a concurrent medication a confounder, it is 
required that the medication has the adverse event listed in the product information. Also, the TTO 
and outcome following dechallenge/rechallenge for the potential confounding medicinal product 
must be taken into consideration when assessing causality. If a medication has been used for a long 
time (chronic treatment), it is less likely to have caused the acute onset of myocarditis occurring 
shortly after vaccination. The MAH further states that the reports were confounded by concurrent 
medical history, such as COVID-19 or Influenza. Here, it is important to look at the latency from the 
infections in order to assess the credibility of these confounding factors.  
No information is given regarding the specific concomitant medications, nor the specific concurrent 
medical conditions, in these 15 cases which the MAH considers WHO “Unlikely”.  
The MAH has classified four cases as WHO Possible, further presented in table 9 and commented 
below. All four cases had a TTO of 3-4 days and occurred after the 2nd vaccination.  
For case 1, concerning a 18-29-year old man, the MAH considers the causality based on its 
confounding by concurrent medical history (asthma) as well as concurrent medications. The 
reference used by the MAH refers to a publication where a case of viral myocarditis was masked by 
the patient’s asthma; the asthma was not concluded to be causally related to development of 
myocarditis in this literature case. The concurrent asthma in the current case is not considered an 
important confounder in this case. Also, considering the concurrent medications, none have 
myocarditis listed in the product information, and in addition, treatment had been ongoing for two 
years prior to event onset for Dupilumab, Montelukast, Budesonid/Formoterol and Cetirizine 
(unknown for Epinephrine and Salbutamol), which make them less likely to be associated to the 
onset of myocarditis. This case is considered WHO Probable. 
The second case, concerns a 50-59-year old male. The MAH states that concurrent medication had 
the event labelled, this could however not be confirmed. The case lacks medical history, however 
Signal assessment report on myocarditis and pericarditis with Spikevax (previously 
COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna)  
EMA/PRAC/326194/2021 
Page 88/121 
 
 
 
 
 
the concomitant medications indicate hypertension/cardiovascular risk. Consequently, a WHO 
Possible causality is agreed. 
The third case, concerns a 20-29-year old male. In this case, the MAH focus on the patient’s 
concurrent medical history (COVID-19 infection). It is acknowledged that COVID-19 has been linked 
to cardiovascular pathologies, including myocarditis. This case does however lack information on 
when the disease course occurred concurrent, or shortly prior to the vaccination, which is important 
in order to determine causality. WHO Possible causality is agreed.   
The fourth case,  concerns a 4049-year-old, female patient with mild Sjögren syndrome who 
developed myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination. It is acknowledged that the 
autoimmune disorder Sjögren syndrome has been associated with myocarditis, however cardiac 
involvement is not considered a typical manifestation of the syndrome. It is notable that also in this 
case, the TTO of myocarditis is 4 days after 2nd dose. Concurrent medications were not reported.  
WHO Possible causality is agreed. 
In addition, one case, case no 1, presented under Pericarditis case review, had concurrent 
myocarditis and pericarditis, occurring 11 days after 1st dose. This case is also considered WHO 
Possible. The case is further discussed under Pericarditis case review. 
In conclusion, one case is considered WHO Probable and four cases WHO Possible. It is remarkable 
that three of four cases have a consistent feature regarding occurrence after 2nd dose and a short 
TTO of 3-4 days. 
The MAH has not commented on the disproportionate reporting of cases after the 2nd dose, 
compared to 1st dose (considering the difference in exposure). Considering the pathophysiology of 
myocarditis, which includes infiltration of lymphocytes in the myocardium, an onset of event 
occurring a few days after the booster immunization is considered biologically plausible. The MAH is 
requested to comment specifically on the number of cases occurring after the 2nd dose as compared 
to the 1st dose, also considering the differences in exposure for these two groups. A specific O/E 
analyses should be performed for the 1st dose and 2nd dose receivers respectively. 
Also, the MAH is requested to present the cases with an “Unlikely” causal association in a tabulated 
format. The table should include, but not restricted to, the following information: Case ID 
(Eudravigilance no if possible) – age/gender - TTO - 1st dose/2nd dose – underlying condition(s) 
(including COVID-19), other medical confounders or risk factors present (including latency/TTO as 
applicable)  - Confounding medications (including latency/TTO as applicable) – outcome

male patient, who received Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine 
(mRNA-1273) and experienced soreness of the arm, acute onset 
of chest pain with a diagnosis of myocarditis. The patient’s 
medical history, as provided by the reporter, included asthma, 
and allergy to egg, peanut and tree nuts. Concomitant 
medications reported included dupilumab, montelukast, 
budesonide / formoterol, cetirizine, albuterol and epinephrine. 
. Prior to the onset of events, the patient received their second of 
two planned doses of mRNA-1273  intramuscularly in the left 
deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.

Narrative 
On the same day, after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, 
the patient reported soreness of the arm for 3 to 4 days. Four days 
later, the patient presented to the hospital with acute onset of left 
sided chest pain. The physician reported that the patient 
developed myocarditis. His cardiac MRI on day 7 showed sub 
epicardial and mid myocardial late gadolinium enhancement in 
the basal inferior and inferolateral segments of the LV with 
additional patchy LGE in all 4 apical segments along with the LV 
edema. He had two different PVC morphologies. Infectious 
workup was negative, including a negative biofire, two covid-19 
PCR, SARs Covid 2 antibodies, Lyme antibodies, coxsackie 
antibodies, CMV, EBV, PCR and HIV studies and negative T 
spot. His ANA was abnormal, but his dsDNA , anti la antibodies 
and anti smith antibodies were negative. No treatment 
information was provided. The patient was discharged from the 
hospital on day 8 with instructions to restrict physical activity and 
follow up with cardiologist. 
The event, soreness of the arm, was resolved. The event 
myocarditis was not resolved. 
Company assessment: This report of myocarditis occurring after 
receiving the Moderna-COVID-19 vaccine is confounded by 
concurrent medical history (asthma18) as well as concurrent 
medications that are currently labeled for serious cardiovascular 
events including myocarditis (dupilumab, budesonide / 
formoterol, albuterol). These confounders provide a more 
plausible explanation for the occurrence of the event of 
myocarditis.

3 days  A regulatory authority report was received from an healthcare 
professional concerning a 50-59-years-old male patient who 
experienced myalgia, headache, fever/pyrexia, fatigue, severe 
substernal chest pain, myocarditis, left ventricular dysfunction, 
and malaise. 
The patient’s medical history was not provided. Concomitant 
medications reported included, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and 
ezetimibe.   
On day 0, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received 
their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273  
intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On day 
3, the patient experienced the events, myalgia, headache, fever, 
fatigue,.  This subsided and then on day 6 he developed severe 
substernal chest pain and came to the ER where he had labs 
revealed myocarditis with left ventricular dysfunction.  The 
patient was hospitalized.  
Laboratory details included, HS-CTnI was greater than 2000 ng/L 
and peaked at 6700 ng/L, ECG, echo and cardiac were normal but 
MRI showed evidence of myocarditis with mild left ventricular 
dysfunction. No treatment details information was provided.  
At the time of this report, the outcome of the events, myalgia, 
headache, fever, fatigue, severe substernal chest pain, 
myocarditis, left ventricular dysfunction, and malaise were 
unknown. 
Company assessment: This report of myocarditis occurring after 
receiving the Moderna-COVID-19 vaccine is confounded by 
concurrent medications that are currently labeled for serious 
cardiovascular events (atorvastin). Also given that the patient is

3  
4 days  A regulatory report was received from a consumer for a 18-29-
year-old male patient who received Moderna's COVID-19 
vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced myocarditis, fever, chest 
pain, myalgia, headache, chills and nausea. The patient's medical 
history included COVID-19, Hereditary hemorrhagic 
telangiectasia and Nasal bleeding. No concomitant medication 
use was reported. 
On day 0, the patient received his second of two planned doses of 
mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 
infection. On  the same day of vaccination, the patient 
experienced nausea, fever and headache. On day 1, the patient 
experienced chills and myalgia and on day 3, the patient 
experienced myocarditis and chest pain. The patient was 
hospitalized due to the events on an unspecified date.  Treatment 
information was not provided. 
The outcome of the events, myocarditis was not recovered, 
outcome for events chest pain, headache and fever was 
recovering/ resolving and outcome for events myalgia, chills, 
nausea was unknown. 
Company assessment: This report of myocarditis occurring after 
receiving the Moderna-COVID-19 vaccine is confounded by 
concurrent medical history (COVID-19 infection). Previous 
COVID-19 infection provides a more plausible explanation for 
the occurrence of the event of myocarditis5.

4 days  A regulatory authority report was received from a healthcare 
facility staff member concerning a 40-49-year-old, female patient 
who developed myocarditis and pericarditis. The patient’s 
medical history included Sjogren's Syndrome - mild, mostly with 
just dry eyes. Products known to have been used by the patient, 
within two weeks prior to the event, included ethinyl estradiol. 
The patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-
1273 (Batch number not provided) on unknown. On day 0, prior 
to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received the second of 
two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number not provided) 
intramuscularly in the arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 
infection. On day 4 the patient was diagnosed with myocarditis 
and pericarditis; lab examinations were performed which 
included troponin (elevated), CK (elevated), ESR (increased). 
ECG with 1 mm ST elevations, cardiac catheterization and 
echocardiogram normal. Treatment information was not 
provided.  
The outcome of the events myocarditis and pericarditis was 
unknown. 
Company assessment: This report of myocarditis occurring after 
receiving the Moderna-COVID-19 vaccine is confounded by 
concurrent medical history (Sjögren's syndrome). Primary 
Sjögren's syndrome is rarely associated with a heart condition, 
but several cases of myocarditis have been described in this 
syndrome either alone or in the context of multisystem

been related to a possible leukocytoclastic vasculitis19. This 
confounder provides a more plausible explanation for the 
occurrence of the event of myocarditis. 
ii. 
Pericarditis: 
Analysis of the 41 cases that reported events of Pericarditis using the WHO-UMP standardized case 
causality assessment revealed that there were 9 reports (21.9% of the Pericarditis cases) classified as 
“Possible” events. There were 4 males and 5 females. Their ages were between 18 and 79 years of 
age. 7 reports were after the 1st dose, and 2 after the 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. The 
reported TTO was between 2 days and 24 days (Mean 11.3 days). A summary of these events is 
provided below (See Table 10). 
The rest of the 41 cases that reported Pericarditis, 12 cases (29.3%) were classified as “Conditional”; 4 
cases (9.7%) were classified as “Unassessable/ Unclassifiable”; and 16 (39%) were classified as 
“Unlikely”.  
The “Conditional” cases were reported in 9 males, and 2 females. Their ages were between 18 to 89 
years of age; 6 cases were reported after the 1st dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, and 6 after 
the 2nd dose of the vaccine.  TTO was between same day to 13 days after the vaccine (Mean 8,5 
days). These events had reports of myocarditis occurring after receiving the vaccine but important 
information necessary to conduct an appropriate causality assessment were missing, including previous 
and concurrent medical history, previous and concurrent medications, course of the current disease, 
and in one case age was missing. 
The 5 cases that were classified as “Unassessable/ Unclassifiable” were reported in 2 males, 2 females, 
and 1 unknown, between 21 and 89 years of age; 3 cases were reported after the 1st dose, and 2 
after the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. TTO was between hours after the first dose to 
1 days (Mean 0.6 days). These events had reports of pericarditis occurring after receiving the vaccine 
but important information necessary to conduct an appropriate causality assessment were missing, 
including previous and concurrent medical history, previous and concurrent medications, course of the 
current disease. 
The 15 cases that were classified as “Unlikely” were reported in 8 males, 7 females and 1 unknown 
between 18 and 89 years of age; 7 cases were reported after the 1st dose, and 9 after the second 
dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. TTO was between one hour to 32 days (Mean 6.5 days). These 
events had reports of pericarditis occurring after receiving the vaccine but the reports are heavily 
confounded by concurrent medical history (Influenza, cardiovascular disorders, asthma, 
hyperthyroidism, sepsis) as well as concurrent medications that are currently labeled for serious 
cardiovascular events including myocarditis. 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comments: 
The MAH assessed 9 cases with pericarditis as possible (as per WHO-UMP causality assessment 
categories). 
Remaining 32/41 cases were either considered by the MAH as “Conditional” (12 cases), as 
“Unassessable/ Unclassifiable” (4 cases) and as “Unlikely” (16 cases). 
For the cases assessed as Possible, the TTO ranged from 2 days to 24 days, and 7 of 9 reports 
occurred after the 1st dose and the remaining 2 cases after the 2nd dose.  Two cases reported both

myocarditis and pericarditis. One of these cases (case no. 1) has not been presented as a 
myocarditis case with a possible causality. It is unclear why, as the case have a possible causality 
for both myocarditis and pericarditis. 
In general, the same limitations of the MAHs causality assessment as described for the myocarditis 
case are present for the pericarditis cases. In general, the rapporteur agrees with the overall 
assessment of causality but does not agree with the MAHs assessment of confounders in most 
cases. The MAH is quick to consider any cardiac or thrombotic event related to a concomitant 
medication enough to consider that medication is a more plausible explanation for the event of 
pericarditis. An example hereof is case no 2 where the MAH considers the contraceptive implant 
containing etonogestrel, a more plausible explanation for the event of pericarditis as the medication 
currently labels “serious cardiovascular events” according to the MAH. When assessing the case, the 
assessor found no cardiac or relevant vascular ADRs are listed in the ADR table in the SmPC of this 
drug, however, in section 4.4 the well-known risk of VTE or ATE of oral contraceptives is mentioned. 
The duration of treatment with the contraceptive is unknown, though it should be noted that the 
implant is inserted and effective for 3 years. Hence, this drug alone does not provide a more 
plausible explanation for the event than the mRNA-1273 Moderna vaccine.  Rapporteurs assessment 
of potential confounders in the 9 pericarditis cases is presented below:

The case has a possible temporal relationship. Concomitant 
medication were phenylpropanolamine, diclofenac sodium, and 
colchicine. No medical history was reported. The MAH mentions 
diclofenac as a more plausible explanation. Diclofenac has 
several cardiac ADRS listed, but not pericarditis. The risk of 
cardiac events related to Diclofenac is mainly related to patients 
with preexisting heart disease. 
WHO Possible for both the event of myocarditis and 
pericarditis 
30-39-year old female experienced symptoms of pericarditis 5 
days after the 1st dose.  
The case has a plausible TTO. Concomitant medication were 
etonogestrel containing contraceptive implant , prenatal vitamin, 
and eszopiclone. No medical history was reported. The MAH 
mentions the implant as a more plausible explanation, which is 
not agreed to, as no cardiac or relevant vascular ADRs are listed 
in the ADR table in the SmPC of this drug, however, in section 
4.4 the well-known risk of VTE or ATE of oral contraceptives is 
mentioned. 
WHO Possible.  
60-69-year old male with a medical history of pericarditis 
experienced pericarditis 9 days after 1st dose of the vaccine. The 
case was fatal.

is not listed for any of the concomitant medications. However, 
some other cardiac ADRs were listed for some the concomitant 
drugs, most of them more severe (e.g. cardiac failure, AV-block, 
cardiac arrest). The patient’s current cardiac disease is a risk 
factor for pericarditis 
WHO Possible 
18-29-year-old male experienced pericarditis 2 days after the 
2nd dose.  
The case has a possible time to onset. Concomitant medication 
included methylphenidate hydrochloride, aripiprazole, and 
clonidine. Medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder, mood swings, sleep apnea, and current conditions of 
nasal congestion and cough. The MAH states that the 
concomitant medication has several cardiovascular events 
labelled and therefore is a more plausible explanation for the 
event. methylphenidate hydrochloride and aripiprazole both 
have a warning of use in patients with a medical history of 
cardiac disease due to risk of severe arrhythmias. However, 
pericarditis is not listed. 
WHO possible 
50-59-year old female patients experienced onset of pericarditis 
symptoms 18 days after the 1st dose.  
It is acknowledged that COVID-19 has been linked to 
cardiovascular pathologies. This case do however lack 
information on when the patient experienced COVID-19 disease 
in relation to the vaccination, which is important in order to 
determine causality. 
 WHO Possible  
Discussed under the myocarditis cases.  
WHO Possible  for the event of pericarditis.  
70-79-year old female patient experienced onset of symptoms 
21 days after 1st dose. 
The case has a positive temporal relationship. Concomitant 
medication included valsartan, ursodiol, citalopram, 
montelukast, ASA, lorazepam, tamsulosin, fluticasone. Patients 
medical history included hypertension and primary biliary 
cirrhosis. It is acknowledged that hypertension is a risk factor 
for several cardiac events. However, the same cannot be said 
for biliary cirrhosis. The MAH should not consider a clinical entity 
a confounder unless clinical evidence can support it. However, 
the reported concomitant drugs suggest the reported current 
medical conditions is not complete.  
WHO Possible. 
30-39-year-old patient experienced pericarditis 24 days after 
the 1st dose. 
The case has a positive temporal relationship. The case has 
limited information about the event ad diagnosis of pericarditis. 
No concomitant medications are reported. The patient's past 
medical history included CVA. Concurrent medical conditions 
included Thalassaemia, Hypothyroidism and Allergy. 
WHO Possible. 
Approximately, half of the cases had a well described diagnosis of pericarditis which included various 
testing. In contrast to myocarditis, where most cases occur after the second dose, most of the 
pericarditis cases assessed as possible occurs after the first dose. The TTO varies significantly (from

A spontaneous report was received from a 18-29-year- old male patient who experienced chest pain, myocarditis, 
pericarditis, inflammation of pericardium. 
The patient’s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications included phenylpropanolamine, 
diclofenac sodium, and colchicine. 
The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) on day 0 
intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  
On day 10, the patient experienced chest pain, rapid heartbeat and went to emergency room (ER). He was 
hospitalized and was diagnosed with myocarditis, pericarditis, inflammation of pericardium. The patient was 
discharged on day 11. Treatment information was not provided. 
The outcome of the events, chest pain, myocarditis, pericarditis, inflammation of pericardium, was considered not 
resolved. 
Company assessment: This report of both pericarditis and myocarditis occurring after receiving the Moderna-
COVID-19 vaccine is confounded by concurrent medications that are currently labeled for serious cardiovascular 
events (diclofenac sodium). This confounder provides a more plausible explanation for the occurrence of the event 
of pericarditis and myocarditis. 
A regulatory authority report was received from another healthcare professional (HCP) concerning a 30-39-year-
old, female patient who experienced chest pain, shortness of breath/dyspnea, pericarditis, and fatigue. The patient’s 
medical history was not provided. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the 
event, included etonogestrel containing contraceptive implant , prenatal vitamin, and eszopiclone. 
The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 on day 0 , approximately five days prior to the 
onset of the symptoms intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On day 5, during 
exercise the patient experienced shortness of breath, and chest pain. This lasted for one to two hours post her cardio 
exercise. These symptoms continued for two to three days along with fatigue. The patient had an EKG performed 
which showed first degree AV block with RBBB.  She was then referred to a cardiologist and on day 18 she was 
diagnosed with pericarditis. Treatment of these events included NSAIDs.  
The outcome of the events, dyspnea, chest pain, fatigue and pericarditis were unknown. 
Company assessment: This report of pericarditis occurring after receiving the Moderna-COVID-19 vaccine is 
confounded by concurrent medications that are currently labeled for serious cardiovascular events (etonogestrel 
containing contraceptive implant). This confounder provides a more plausible explanation for the occurrence of the 
event of pericarditis. 
A regulatory authority report was received from a healthcare professional concerning a 60-69 years old male 
patient who developed acute myocardial infraction, chest pain, dyspnea, pericarditis and died. The patient’s 
medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, pericarditis (start date 2014). Concomitant medications 
were not provided.  
On day 0, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for 
prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. The patient experienced severe chest pain and dyspnea approximately 9 days 
following the first series of the vaccine. He reported to family members that he was having a severe reaction to the 
vaccine and believed it was acute pericarditis, due to the same symptoms he experienced prior. On day 9 around 
0300 hours, the symptoms were the most severe and he was going to seek medical attention, but he did not. He 
purchased OTC paracetamol for relief of symptoms. Symptoms of dyspnea and chest pain continued until day 17, 
when he called the emergency service complaining of chest pain and was found to have a STEMI (ST-elevation 
myocardial infarction). He subsequently died on day 17. It was unknown if an autopsy was performed.  
Company assessment: This case is heavily confounded by the patient’s previous (pericarditis, hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia) and concurrent medical history (acute MI). According to the WHO-UMC causality assessment the 
case is considered possible given that there is a temporal relationship to the occurrence of the event after 
vaccination but the previous and concurrent medical history are a more plausible explanation for the occurrence of 
the event of pericarditis. This confounder provides a more plausible explanation for the occurrence of the event of 
pericarditis.

Relevant laboratory tests and procedures included complete blood count with differential, complete metabolic 
panel, troponin x 2, B-Type natriuretic peptide, Covid swab, urinalysis, C reactive protein, electrocardiogram and 
chest X ray on day 9 and cardiac echocardiogram, pericardiocentesis, pericardial fluid analysis and thyroid 
stimulating hormone on day 9 (results not specified).  
Treatment for the event included Pericardiocentesis, Colchicine, Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Omeprazole for pericarditis 
with pericardial effusion. Treatments for other events was not provided. 
The events, Pericarditis with pericardial effusion, retrosternal chest heaviness and aching worse with inspiration, 
fever, chills, lymphadenopathy and pain were considered recovered/resolved on after third day of hospitalization 
and was feeling better after one week of follow up. 
Company assessment: This report of pericarditis occurring after receiving the Moderna-COVID-19 vaccine is 
confounded by concurrent medical history (hypertension gastroesophageal reflux disease, anxiety, recurrent 
syncopal episodes) as well as concurrent medications that are currently labeled for cardiovascular events. These 
confounders provide a more plausible explanation for the occurrence of the event of pericarditis. 
A regulatory authority report  was received from a healthcare professional concerning a 18-29-year old, male 
patient who received Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced chest pain and pericarditis.

On day 0, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273  intramuscularly in the left arm 
for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. Two days after receiving the vaccine, the patient was hospitalized due to 
chest pain and pericarditis. On the same day, the patient underwent X-ray, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, 
laboratory tests, magnetic resonance imaging. The findings of electrocardiogram were abnormal and laboratory 
findings revealed increased troponin levels. Subsequently, heart catheterization was performed the very same day. 
Treatment information was not provided. 
The outcome of the events, chest pain and pericarditis, was considered not recovered.

On day 4 the patient was diagnosed with myocarditis and pericarditis; lab examinations were performed which 
included troponin (elevated), CK (elevated), ESR (increased). ECG with 1 mm ST elevations, cardiac 
catheterization and echocardiogram normal. Treatment information was not provided.  
The outcome of the events myocarditis and pericarditis was unknown. 
Company assessment: This report of pericarditis and myocarditis occurring after receiving the Moderna-COVID-
19 vaccine is confounded by concurrent medical history (Sjögren's syndrome). Primary Sjögren's syndrome is 
rarely associated with a heart condition, but several cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been described in 
this syndrome either alone or in the context of multisystem involvement. The etiologic mechanism of this 
myocarditis has been related to a possible leukocytoclastic vasculitis. This confounder provides a more plausible 
explanation for the occurrence of the event of pericarditis and myocarditis. 
A regulatory authority report was received from a health care professional concerning a 70-79 year-old, female 
patient who received Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced pericarditis and pericardial 
effusion. The patient’s medical history included HTN (hypertension), primary biliary cirrhosis. Concomitant 
medicines included valsartan, ursodiol, citalopram, montelukast, ASA, lorazepam, tamsulosin, fluticasone. 
On day 0, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their one of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 
intramuscular in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On day 21, the patient experienced pericarditis 
and pericardial effusion. Laboratory exams included CRP, echocardiogram, respiratory viral PCR, CBC, CMP, 
ASO titer, ANA, EKG, antinuclear antibody, c-reactive protein, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, full blood 
count, metabolic function test, polymerase chain reaction, respiratory viral panel and streptococcus test (results not 
reported). No treatment information was provided. 
The outcomes of the events, pericarditis and pericardial effusion, were resolved. 
Company assessment: This report of pericarditis occurring after receiving the Moderna-COVID-19 vaccine is 
confounded by concurrent medical history (hypertension, biliary cirrhosis) as well as concurrent medications that 
are currently labeled for cardiovascular events. These confounders provide a more plausible explanation for the 
occurrence of the event of pericarditis. 
This case was received via an unknown source (no reference has been entered for a health authority or license 
partner) and was forwarded to Moderna . This regulatory authority case was reported by a physician (subsequently 
medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of pericarditis in a 30-39-year-old female patient who received 
mRNA-1273 (COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna) for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient's past medical history 
included CVA. Concurrent medical conditions included Thalassaemia, Hypothyroidism and Allergy. 
On day 0, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage 
form. On day 23, the patient experienced Pericarditis. At the time of the report, pericarditis had resolved. 
Treatment information was not reported. 
Company assessment: This report of pericarditis occurring after receiving the Moderna-COVID-19 vaccine is 
confounded by concurrent medical history ( Thalassaemia, Hypothyroidism and Allergy). These confounders 
provide a more plausible explanation for the occurrence of the event of pericarditis.

5.  Associated Preferred Terms (PTs) with the Events of Myocarditis and/or 
Pericarditis: 
As per request from the PRAC, an analysis of the most common associated PT that were reported in 
conjunction with the 84 reports of Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis, showed that “Chest Pain” (11.7%), 
“Pyrexia” (5.3%), “Dyspnoea” (4.1%), and “Chills” (3.5%) were the PT most commonly reported with 
the Myocarditis and Pericarditis events. There was no trending associated with any other PTs. The 
events of chest pain and dyspnoea are expected events associated with the diagnosis of Myocarditis 
and Pericarditis. Pyrexia and chills, are already events labelled for the Moderna COVID 19 vaccine, but 
are also associated with some of the concomitant medical histories reported for the cases of 
Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis, like Influenza, Influenza-like symptoms, COVID-19 infection, sepsis and 
other bacterial infections.

No trends or patterns could be identified from the provided overview of co-reported events, besides 
the usual symptoms related to myocarditis/pericarditis and reactogenicity. 
6.  Discussion and Conclusions: 
The company clinical database and the global safety database were queried for valid, clinical and 
spontaneous case reports received from HCP, HA, consumers and literature, cumulative from 18 
December 2020 to 30 April 2021, worldwide, reported for the mRNA-1273 vaccine (COVID-19 vaccine 
Moderna) using the following Preferred Terms (PTs): “Viral pericarditis; Pericarditis; Pericarditis 
infective; Myocarditis; Myocarditis septic; Myocarditis infectious; Viral myocarditis; and 
Myocarditis post-infection”. The clinical trial data is from the Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial mRNA- 
1273 P301. 
As of 30 April 2021, there have been 182,568,555 doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine distributed 
worldwide. Out of those 119,066,486 doses have been administered, with 87.9% of doses 
administered in the US, 9.6% in the European Economic Area, 1.7% in Canada, and 0.8% in other 
countries. 
The data from the mRNA-1273 P301 clinical trials showed that there were no reported TEAEs of 
“Myocarditis” in P301. There were three (3) unsolicited TEAE of “Pericarditis” reported in P301; two 
TEAEs in the Placebo arm, and one in the Vaccine arm of the safety set in the overall stage after any 
injection. The 2 events in the placebo arm were reported in the >18 to <65 years of age, and the 
event in the vaccination arm was reported in the >65 years of age group. Data from this pivotal clinical 
trial does not suggest a relationship between administration of the mRNA-1273 vaccine and the events 
of Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis. 
The company global safety database was also queried for spontaneous, valid, case reports received 
from HCP, HA, literature, and consumers, cumulatively (18 December 2020 to 30 April 2021), 
worldwide, using the PTs of “Viral pericarditis; Pericarditis; Pericarditis infective; Myocarditis; 
Myocarditis septic; Myocarditis infectious; Viral myocarditis; and Myocarditis post-infection”. 
There were 84 case reports (0.1% of all cases reported to the MAH) with the PTs of Myocarditis and/or 
Pericarditis. There were 49 cases (0.1% of all cases) reported with Myocarditis-related PTs, and 41 
cases (0.04% of all cases) with Pericarditis-related PTs. There were 6 cases (0.01% of all cases) that 
reported both events of Myocarditis and Pericarditis-related PTs. All 84 reports were considered serious 
reports. Most of the reports were in individuals between the ages of 18 to 39 years of age, and in

males (75.4%). The majority of the reports had a TTO of <14 days (Mean 6 days). Most of the events 
for which the event outcome was reported showed not recovered/ not resolved (34.1%) followed by 
recovered/ resolved (23.5%). It is important to note that most of the spontaneous reports included in 
the MAH global safety database are obtained from regulatory authorities. This preclude the MAH to 
obtain follow-up information for the cases reported. It is also important to note that the reports are 
usually provided to the regulatory authorities usually when the patient was admitted to the hospital or 
recently discharged hence the fact that most of the events have a “not resolved” reported outcome. 
Given that the majority of the cases (90.6%) with the PTs of Myocarditis were reported in the USA, the 
MAH used data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), given that population-based data 
characterizing the incidence of myocarditis in general are limited. The study from the VSD considered 
myocarditis as an adverse event following immunization (AEFI). In this assessment, an incidence of 
0.24 per 100,000 individuals within 42 days after receiving measles-mumps-rubella, varicella, oral 
polio, or yellow fever vaccines did not exceed the rate in a control period. Even though the Moderna 
COVID-19 vaccine is not a live-virus vaccine the information from this study do allow to provide 
information related to AEFIs in vaccines that have been widely used in the world. Compared to this 
rate, the observed number of Myocarditis cases within the MAH global safety database, were within the 
expected range (49 cases observed vs 108 expected), with a rate ratio suggesting that sensitivity of 
the reporting rate would need to be below 29% for a possible increase in risk to be masked by low 
reporting. 
Regarding Pericarditis, there were 41 pericarditis cases observed in the MAH global safety database 
through 30 April 2021. Based on incidence rates from the prospective clinical cohort study in Italy that 
identified an incidence of 27.7 cases per 100,000 person-years, and the retrospective analysis of the 
Finnish registry data capturing admissions to 29 hospitals over a span of 9.5 years identified an age 
standardized incidence of 3.32 per 100,000 person-years, with higher rates in men ages 16-65, around 
225-1896 cases would be expected. The analysis of the MAH post-marketing data shows that for 
males, all observed rates were below the expected, and for females, rates were below the expected 
with the exception of the 30-39 age group, where the reporting rate was approximately equal to the 
expected (1.03 vs. 1.00). 
Review of the 84 serious case reports associated with the chosen PTs for Myocarditis and Pericarditis, 
and using the WHO-UMP standardized case causality assessment of 2018, showed that there were 24 
cases classified as “Conditional”, 16 classified as “Unlikely”, 20 classified as “Unassessable”, and 13 as 
“Possible”. Most of the reports were heavily confounded by previous or concomitant medical history, 
including concomitant medications. Review of these cases do not show that Myocarditis and/or 
Pericarditis are related to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Most of the cases are in general heavily 
confounded and are missing important medical information in order to make an informed causality 
assessment. There is a wide spectrum of severity among the Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis reported 
cases. 
During the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical 
(VaST) Work Group conducted on May 12 several presentations on myocarditis following mRNA 
vaccines, from the Department of Defense (DoD), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System 
(VAERS), and Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) were discussed. There were also brief updates from the 
Veteran’s Administration (VA) and the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) groups about 
their plans for future investigation of myocarditis. VaST concluded that there are relatively few reports 
of myocarditis to date and that these cases seem to occur predominantly in adolescents and young 
adults, more often in males than females, more often following dose 2 than dose 1, and typically within 
4 days after vaccination. Most cases appear to be mild, and follow-up of cases is ongoing. Within CDC 
Signal assessment report on myocarditis and pericarditis with Spikevax (previously 
COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna)  
EMA/PRAC/326194/2021 
Page 102/121 
 
 
 
 
safety monitoring systems, rates of myocarditis reports in the window following COVID-19 vaccination 
have not differed from expected baseline rates20. 
Review of the information provided by the Department of Defense (DoD) on 14 reports of Myocarditis 
on military members21, shows that of the 14 cases, one patient, who tested positive for COVID-19 
three months ago, developed myocarditis after their first dose of vaccine. The remaining 13 patients 
developed myocarditis after their second vaccine doses. No other information on these reports is 
available regarding previous and current medical history, previous and concomitant medications, as 
well as medical course of the current disease. According to the report, 11 cases received the Moderna 
COVID-19 vaccine, and 3 received another mRNA vaccine. The DoD has administered 2,713,640 
COVID-19 vaccines, with diagnoses of myocarditis occurring in 0.000516% of that group. 
Regarding the information provided by the Israeli Health Ministry, more than 5 million people have 
been vaccinated in Israel (https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-said-probing-link-between-pfizer-shot-
and-heart-problem-in-men-under-30/). There were 62 recorded cases of myocarditis following 
vaccination with another mRNA vaccine in the days after receiving the vaccine. According to the report 
56 of those cases came after the second dose and most of the affected were men under the age of 30 
years old. Sixty of the 62 patients were treated and released from hospital in good condition. Two of 
the patients, who were reportedly healthy until receiving the vaccination, including a 18-29-year-old 
woman and a 30-39-year’s old man, died. The report found that of those who received the second 
dose, 1-in-100,000 had possible side effects of myocarditis; however, this number rose to 1-in-20,000 
among those aged 16-30. 
Information provided in these two reports do not provide enough information regarding the cases 
previous and current medical history, previous and concomitant medications, as well as medical course 
of the current disease. The reports also show a very similar occurrence of these conditions when 
compared with the general population. Very limited studies of the background rates of Myocarditis and 
Pericarditis, and likely large differences in detection and reporting that contribute to the extremely 
wide variation in background rates by geographic area. Viral myocarditis is thought to be the most 
frequent type, mostly affecting children and young adults. A recent study using International 
Classification of Diseases codes estimated the global prevalence of myocarditis to be ≈22 of 100 000 
patients annually. Approximately 1% to 5% of patients that test positive for acute viral infection(s) 
may exhibit a form of myocarditis. The prevalence of myocarditis has been reported from 10.2 to 
105.6 per 100,000 worldwide, and its annual occurrence is estimated at about 1.8 million cases. Most 
studies of acute myocarditis report a greater prevalence and severity in male patients, speculated to 
be caused by a protective effect of natural hormonal influences on immune responses in women when 
compared with men. Patients are usually between the ages of 20 and 50. 
It is important to note that under the current enhanced safety monitoring activities that are being 
conducted throughout the world for those recipients of the COVID-19 vaccines, including the Moderna 
COVID-19 vaccine, and more specifically in the US with the use of the v-safe mobile application, there 
is an increase in the number of spontaneous reports received by the MAH, especially during the first 7 
days after the administration of the vaccine. Reported incidence of the event of Myocarditis and/or 
Pericarditis follows a similar latency distribution pattern of the overall number of all of the reported 
events suggesting that the fact that those two events are reported with higher frequency within 7 days 
of the vaccine is a consequence of the enhanced surveillance activities mentioned above, and there is a 
potential for increased detection of illnesses post-vaccination due to well-described vaccine 
reactogenicity after exposure to the COVID-19 vaccines in general or simply knowledge of vaccination. 
Based on the analysis of all the safety data available as of 30 April 2021, the MAH considers that 
Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis are not presently a  safety issue of concern that would justify o inclusion

of  “Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis” in the ADR table in section 4.8 of the SmPC nor in section 4 of the 
PL. The MAH will continue to closely evaluate events of “Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis” using routine 
surveillance. 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comments: 
In the previous MSSR AR, the MAH was requested to perform a cumulative review of the cases 
myocarditis and pericarditis. The MAH provided their evaluation during the current procedure as a 
separate submission. 
Background 
Myocarditis is an inflammatory condition of the myocardium. Pericarditis is an inflammatory process 
involving the pericardium. Both can be triggered by various factors, including viral infections and 
autoimmune conditions. The global prevalence of myocarditis is estimated to be approximately 22 
per 100 000 PYs, with a greater prevalence and severity in male patients between the ages of 20 
and 50. Global epidemiologic data on the incidence of acute pericarditis is not available. 
Methodology 
Search strategy 
The MAH searched their company clinical database and the global safety database for cumulative 
(from 18 December 2020 to 30 April 2021) reports with PTs: Viral pericarditis; Pericarditis; 
Pericarditis infective; Myocarditis; Myocarditis septic; Myocarditis infectious; Viral myocarditis; and 
Myocarditis post-infection. The MAH’s search strategy and used preferred terms are considered 
acceptable. 
O/E analyses 
The MAH performed both overall combined O/E analyses, and age- and gender stratified specific 
O/E analyses concerning the events of myocarditis and/or pericarditis. The MAH calculated exposure 
for the O/E analyses based on the US age and gender vaccination distribution data. For the age 
stratified myocarditis O/E analyses, ACCESS incidence rates comparable with available US and 
global incidence rates were used, due to a lack of US specific age or gender stratified background 
rates. In the age- and gender stratified O/E analyses for the pericarditis events, as no pericarditis 
specific data from the ACCESS IRs is available, the MAH based their O/E analyses on published 
incidence rates. The MAH’s methodological approach is in general considered acceptable. 
Results 
Clinical database 
No imbalance was seen in the clinical trial (P301), and data from P301 does not suggest a 
relationship between administration of the mRNA-1273 vaccine and the events of Myocarditis 
and/or Pericarditis. 
Company global safety database 
The MAH identified 84 case reports with the PTs of Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis from their safety 
database, of which 49 cases with Myocarditis-related PTs, and 41 cases with Pericarditis-related 
PTs. There were 6 cases that reported both events of Myocarditis and Pericarditis-related PTs.  
O/E analyses 
In the age- and gender stratified O/E analyses for the myocarditis events, the observed rates were 
close to equal or slightly above the expected rates for in males aged 18-29 and males aged 30-39

(rate ratio 0.73 when comparing to the low background IRs. This could indicate a potential 
increased risk in these populations, as some degree of underreporting is likely. Similarly, the 
observed rates were close to the expected rates for in females aged 18-29, 30-39 and 40-49, 
however, these findings rates were based on a low number of cases and thus should be interpreted 
with caution. In the age- and gender stratified O/E analyses for the pericarditis events, no 
significant findings were observed. The MAH is reminded to perform adjustment for underreporting, 
backlog of case handling and sensitivity analysis. 
Case characteristics overview 
The majority of the myocarditis and/or pericarditis cases were in males (55/84; 65.9%), and in 
individuals between the ages of 18 to 39 years of age (45/84; 52.3%). Most of the reports were 
with TTO within 1 day (31/84; 36.5%). Of these cases, 23/31 in males with most cases following 
the 2nd dose (6 after the 1st dose, and 17 after the 2nd dose), and 14/31 in the 18 to 39 years old 
group. A total of 20/84 cases were reported with TTO 2-3 days, of these 10 cases in age group 18-
29.  
A higher number of cases in males, and in age below < 40 may be expected as prevalence in the 
general population exhibits a similar pattern with a highest prevalence in young males between 20-
50 years of age. Nevertheless, the number of cases reported after 1st or 2nd dose seem to differ 
substantially and may indicate a potential higher risk after 2nd dose.  
No risk factors, or patterns or trends could be identified from the medical history or co-reported 
events.  
Case causality assessment 
Myocarditis cases 
The MAH performed causality assessment of the 49 cases of Myocarditis. Of these, 29 cases were 
classified as either “Conditional” or “Unassessable”, due to limited information. Of these, 14 were 
reported after the 1st dose, and 14 after the 2nd dose. 15 cases were classified as “Unlikely”. Nine 
cases were reported after the 1st dose, and 6 after the 2nd dose. No information is given regarding 
the specific concomitant medication, nor the specific concurrent medical conditions, in these 15 
cases which the MAH considers WHO “Unlikely”.  
Four (4) cases, classified as WHO Possible by the MAH, were further classified by the PRAC 
Rapporteur as one case being WHO Probable, and three cases WHO Possible. It is considered 
remarkable that all four cases have a consistent feature regarding occurrence after 2nd dose and a 
short TTO of 3-4 days.  
Pericardititis cases 
In total, 41 cases of Pericarditis were assessed by the MAH according the WHO-UMC causality 
categories. The MAH assessed 9 cases as Possible, 12 cases as Conditional, 4 cases as 
Unassessable and 16 cases were assessed as Unlikely. 
The PRAC Rapporteur agrees with the causality classified by the MAH for the nine (9) cases 
classified as possible, however, the MAHs assessment of confounders is not fully agreed in all 
cases. Of the 9 cases with a possible causality, two cases reported both myocarditis and 
pericarditis. In contrast to the overall cases presentation, where most cases occur after the second 
dose, most of the pericarditis cases occurs after the first dose (7 of 9 cases). The TTO varies 
significantly (from 2 days to 24 days) in these cases compared to the myocarditis cases. Only 1 
case had a medical history of pericarditis.

Other relevant safety information 
In their signal evaluation, the MAH also refers to other safety information on this topic. 
Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Work Group 
VaST reviews COVID-19 vaccine safety data on weekly basis in the US. During the VaST meeting on 
May 17, 2021, myocarditis following mRNA vaccines was discussed. VaST concluded that there are 
relatively few reports of myocarditis to date and that these cases seem to occur: 
• 
predominantly in adolescents and young adults, 
•  more often in males than females, 
•  more often following dose 2 than dose 1, and 
• 
typically within 4 days after vaccination. 
Most cases appeared to be mild, and follow-up of cases is ongoing. Within CDC safety monitoring 
systems, rates of myocarditis reports in the window following COVID-19 vaccination have not 
differed from expected baseline rates. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/work-groups-
vast/technical-report-2021-05-17.html 
Department of Defense (DoD)  
Of the 14 reports of Myocarditis on military members, based on the MAH’s review of the information 
provided by the Department of Defense (DoD), one patient, who tested positive for COVID-19 three 
months ago, developed myocarditis after their first dose of vaccine. The remaining 13 patients 
developed myocarditis after their second vaccine doses. Eleven received the COVID-19 vaccine 
Moderna; three got another mRNA vaccine. No other information on these reports was available. 
https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/04/26/pentagon-tracking-14-cases-of-heart-
inflammation-troops-after-covid-19-shots.html   
Israeli Health Ministry 
Regarding the information provided by the Israeli Health Ministry, there were 62 cases of myocarditis 
following vaccination with another mRNA vaccine. Of those, 56 cases came after the 2nd dose and 
most of the affected were men under the age of 30 years old. There were two fatal cases, in a 18-
29-year-old woman and a 30-39-year’s old man, who were reportedly healthy prior to the 
vaccination. https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-said-probing-link-between-pfizer-shot-and-heart-
problem-in-men-under-30/  
The MAH’s overall conclusion 
Based on the analysis of all the safety data available as of 30 April 2021, the MAH considered that 
Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis is not a safety issue of concern that would at present warrant an 
update of the product information.  
PRAC Rapporteur’s overall conclusion 
Based on the presented information, it is agreed upon that the current evidence is not sufficient to 
establish causal association between COVID-10 vaccine Moderna and the risk of myocarditis and/or 
pericarditis. However, a need for further evaluation of this topic is considered warranted. 
The MAH did not comment on the disproportionate reporting of cases after the 2nd dose, compared 
to 1st dose. Considering the pathophysiology of myocarditis, which includes infiltration of 
lymphocytes in the myocardium, an onset of event occurring a few days after the booster 
immunization is considered biologically plausible.

COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna)  
EMA/PRAC/326194/2021 
Page 106/121 
 
 
 
 
Also, the PRAC Rapporteur did not fully agree on the MAH’s classification of the confounders. For 
the future causality assessment, the MAH is reminded that to consider a concurrent medication a 
confounder, it is required that the medication has the adverse event listed in the product 
information.  Also, the TTO and outcome following dechallenge/rechallenge for the potential 
confounding medicinal product must be taken into consideration when assessing causality. If a 
medication has been used for a long time (chronic treatment), it is less likely to have caused the 
acute onset of myocarditis occurring shortly after vaccination. When the reports are considered 
confounded by concurrent medical history, such as COVID-19 or Influenza, it is important to look at 
the latency from the infections in order to assess the credibility of these confounding factors. 
In the O/E-analysis, the MAH is reminded to perform adjustment for underreporting, backlog of 
case handling and sensitivity analysis. 
Of note, the Brighton Collaboration working group has recently published a draft case definition of 
myocarditis, available at https://brightoncollaboration.us/myocarditis-case-definition-update/ 
The case definition should be implemented in the assessment of cases of myocarditis.  
Finally, the MAH is reminded to actively follow-up on cases concerning myocarditis and pericarditis 
as the outcome of the events are important to fully characterize the seriousness of events and the 
potential risk of myocarditis/pericarditis.

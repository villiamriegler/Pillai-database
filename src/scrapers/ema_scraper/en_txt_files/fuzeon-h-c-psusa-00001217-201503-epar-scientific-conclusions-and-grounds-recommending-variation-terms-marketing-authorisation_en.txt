Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for enfuvirtide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
During routine signal detection activities, a review of five case reports of high level term amyloidosis 
cases related to enfuvirtide was extracted from Eudravigilance. The signal was considered 
potentially serious and the marketing authorisation holder performed a cumulative review of high 
level term amyloidosis. The information provided regarding the signal of local amyloidosis gives 
evidence based on two well documented cases that enfuvirtide as a peptide can cause cutaneous 
amyloidosis at the injection site. In view of the above, it is considered that cutaneous amyloidosis at 
the injection site should be reflected as an adverse reaction in the product information of Fuzeon. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding Fuzeon, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for enfuvirtide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing enfuvirtide is favourable subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

In vitro, abacavir inhibits CYP1A1. Concomitant 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.5 of the SmPC (for Ziagen, 
Kivexa, Trizivir and Triumeq) and 5.2 (for Triumeq 
only) to add new information about the drug-drug 
interactions between abacavir and riociguat. The 
administration of a single dose (0.5 mg) of riociguat 
(CYP1A1 substrate) to HIV patients receiving the 
combination of abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine 
(600mg/50mg/300mg once daily) led to an approximately 
three-fold higher riociguat AUC(0-∞) when compared to 
historical riociguat AUC(0-∞) reported in healthy subjects. 
Therefore, when riociguat is co-administered with abacavir, 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. Furthermore, 
its dose may need to be reduced. Consult the riociguat

PK study COL112055 did not show apparent impact of ABC 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC to 
remove the current information regarding a potential 
interaction between abacavir and ribavirin. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In 
addition, updated RMPs were agreed during the 
procedure: Ziagen RMP version 13; Kivexa RMP 
version 5; Triumeq RMP version 10. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
on the intracellular concentrations of ribavirin triphosphate 
after 56 days of treatment (RBV alone: 15.93 pmol/106 
cells; RBV+ABC: 15.87 pmol/106 cells). Although the 
variability of these measures is too high (80-100%) to 
achieve adequate statistical power (a difference between 
these 2 arms only >40% can be excluded), the data are 
nonetheless reassuring, the intracellular values being quite 
similar in between arms. 
In addition, 3 retrospective studies performed in a large 
number of HCV/HIV coinfected subjects do not support a 
potential impact of ABC on the sustained virologic response 
with Peg-IFN+ribavirin. Moreover, the potential interaction 
of ABC on RBV is currently not considered in the European 
guidelines for the treatment of HIV/HCV coinfected 
subjects.

to a variable degree, which is most pronounced with 
stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. There have been 
reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV negative infants 
exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside 
analogues; these have predominantly concerned treatment 
with regimens containing zidovudine. The main adverse 
reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, 
neutropenia) and metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, 
hyperlipasemia). These events have often been transitory. 
Late onset neurological disorders have been reported rarely 
(hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether 
such neurological disorders are transient or permanent is 
currently unknown. These findings should be considered for 
any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, that 
present with severe clinical findings of unknown etiology, 
particularly neurologic findings. These findings do not affect 
current national recommendations to use antiretroviral 
therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical 
transmission of HIV.

Update of section 4.2 of the SmPC with extended 
posology recommendations with reference to the 
once daily vs twice daily oral dosing regimen of ABC 
+ 3TC in HIV-1–infected paediatric patients aged 3 
months and older, and amended weight ranges for 
scored tablets according to the WHO 
recommendations, as well as sections 4.8, 5.1 and 
5.2 of the SmPC with further data on 
pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy based on the 
results of the ARROW study (COL105677), its PK 
substudy and the PK studies PENTA 13 and PENTA

agreed for Ziagen during the procedure. 
vs twice daily dosing of abacavir and lamivudine was 
undertaken within a randomised, multicentre, controlled 
study of HIV-infected, paediatric patients. 1206 paediatric 
patients aged 3 months to 17 years enrolled in the ARROW 
Trial (COL105677) and were dosed according to the weight 
- band dosing recommendations in the World Health 
Organisation treatment guidelines (Antiretroviral therapy of 
HIV infection in infants and children, 2006). After 36 weeks 
on a regimen including twice daily abacavir and lamivudine, 
669 eligible subjects were randomised to either continue 
twice daily dosing or switch to once daily abacavir and 
lamivudine for at least 96 weeks. Of note, from this study 
clinical data were not available for children under one year 
old.

No additional safety issues have been identified in 
paediatric subjects receiving either once or twice daily 
dosing compared to adults. 
In a pharmacokinetic study (PENTA 15), four virologically 
controlled subjects less than 12 months of age switched 
from abacavir plus lamivudine oral solution twice daily to a 
once daily regimen. Three subjects had undetectable viral 
load and one had plasmatic HIV-RNA of 900 copies/ml at 
Week 48. No safety concerns were observed in these 
subjects. 
The abacavir + lamivudine once daily dosing group was 
demonstrated to be non-inferior to the twice daily group 
according to the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -
Page 16/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12%, for the primary endpoint of <80 c/mL at Week 48 as 
well as at Week 96 (secondary endpoint) and all other 
thresholds tested (<200c/mL, <400c/mL, <1000c/mL), 
which all fell well within this non-inferiority margin. 
Subgroup analyses testing for heterogeneity of once vs 
twice daily demonstrated no significant effect of sex, age, 
or viral load at randomisation. Conclusions supported non-
inferiority regardless of analysis method. 
In a separate study comparing the unblinded NRTI 
combinations (with or without blinded nelfinavir) in 
children, a greater proportion treated with abacavir and 
lamivudine (71%) or abacavir and zidovudine (60%) had 
HIV-1 RNA  400 copies/ml at 48 weeks, compared with 
those treated with lamivudine and zidovudine (47%)[ 
p=0.09, intention to treat analysis]. Similarly, greater 
proportions of children treated with the abacavir containing 
combinations had HIV-1 RNA  50 copies/ml at 48 weeks 
(53%, 42% and 28% respectively, p=0.07).

the literature with some data suggesting that HIV/HCV co-
infected patients receiving abacavir-containing ART may be 
at risk of a lower response rate to pegylated 
interferon/ribavirin therapy. A possible intracellular 
mechanism has been postulated that ABC and RBV (two 
guanosine analogues) may be competing for the enzymes 
of a shared phosphorylation pathway. This could lead to a 
reduction in intracellular phosphorylated metabolites of 
ribavirin and, as a potential consequence, a reduced chance 
of sustained virological response (SVR) for Hepatitis C 
(HCV) in HCV co-infected patients treated with pegylated 
interferon plus RBV. Section 4.5 has also been updated

reaction (HSR) against the active substance abacavir at re-
initiation of treatment in a patient who previously had well 
tolerated this medicinal product. However afterwards, this 
patient was tested positive for the gene HLA-B*5701, which 
is associated with a higher HSR risk. There have also been 
case reports of HSR in patients who already had shown

HSR symptoms before, but were tested HLA-B*5701 
negative. Based on these facts, it was regarded as 
necessary to amend the recommendation for HLA-B*5701 
testing before re-initiation of abacavir treatment and to 
highlight that HSR can also occur in HLA-B*5701 negative 
patients in the Product Information. Regarding the latter 
issue, also the information on HSR incidence was updated 
and is now reflecting the still significant HSR incidence 
obtained for HLA-B*5701 negative patients in recent

between the use of abacavir and the risk of myocardial 
PL 
infarction shown in an observational study (DAD study). 
Since then additional data derived from observational 
studies and clinical trials have become available on this 
issue including FHDH study. 
Observational studies have shown an association between 
myocardial infarction and the use of abacavir. The patients 
studied have generally received antiretroviral treatment 
prior inclusion in the study (experienced patients). There 
were limited numbers of myocardial infarction in data from 
clinical trials and a small increase in risk could not be 
excluded. 
The data available so far present some inconsistencies and 
can neither confirm nor refute a causal relationship 
between abacavir treatment and the risk of myocardial 
infarction. 
To date, there is no established biological mechanism to 
Page 24/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
explain a potential increase in risk. 
The CHMP concluded that on the basis of the data available 
no recommendation could be made for changing the 
therapeutic management of patients. When prescribing 
Ziagen action should be taken to try to minimize all 
modifiable risk factors (e.g. smoking, hypertension, and 
hyperlipidaemia). The SPC and package leaflet of abacavir-
containing medicinal products will be updated to reflect this 
information.

the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and

considered that the benefit risk profile of Ziagen continues

the Marketing Authorisation for Ziagen. However due to the 
abacavir safety profile (hypersensitivity reaction and the 
concerns currently being evaluated: potential association 
with myocardial infarction and shorter time to virological 
failure observed with lamivudine-abacavir fixed dose 
combination) the CHMP is of the opinion that one additional

grounds is required.

abacavir in pivotal clinical trials showed either no NRTI-
related changes from baseline or only M184V or M184I 
selection. Concerning in vivo resistance in therapy 
experienced patients, a clinically significant reduction of 
susceptibility to abacavir has been demonstrated in clinical 
isolates of patients with uncontrolled viral replication, who 
have been pre-treated with and are resistant to other 
nucleoside inhibitors. Phenotypic resistance to abacavir 
requires M184V with at least one other abacavir-selected 
mutation, or M184V with multiple thymidine analogue 
mutations. The currently recommended resistance 
algorithms can help in the appropriate use of abacavir.

HIV-infected patients since the end of the 80's. Although 
the cause of this disease could be due to multi factors 
(including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, 
severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index) it has 
occurred specially in patients with HIV advanced disease 
and/or in patients with long term use of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART). Further to the review of all 
available data the CHMP agreed that this information 
should now be included in the SPC and PL of all 
antiretroviral medicinal products. Patients should be 
warned to seek medical advice in case they experience joint 
stiffness, aches and pain especially of the hip, knee and 
shoulder or if they experienced any difficulty in movement.

abacavir (Trizivir) was shown to induce a significantly 
higher rate of virologic failure as compared to a tritherapy 
with efavirenz. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that 
there is no benefit of adding abacavir to a tritherapy with 
efavirenz.

reaction to abacavir. Analyses of clinical risk factors for the 
hypersensitivity to abacavir have identified the risk for 
Black patients to be approximately half the risk for other 
racial groups combined. However, since approximately 5% 
of patients receiving abacavir develop a hypersensitivity 
reaction, the risk for Black patients is of the same 
magnitude as for other racial groups and the same close 
monitoring should apply to patients of all racial groups.

wording on skin reactions and the PL in section 4 to 
revise the wording on lipodystrophy as adopted by 
the CPMP in March 2003 and in section 6 to update

also updated the SPC and PL accortding to the latest

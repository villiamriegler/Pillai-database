Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for nivolumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
7 seven cases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome in patients who had been exposed to 
nivolumab have been reported. In two cases the patients were only exposed to nivolumab and, in the 
remaining 5 cases the patients had concomitant or previous/following exposure to either ipilimumab or 
vemurafenib. Following review of these cases, a causal association between nivolumab and VKH 
syndrome was considered to be a reasonable possibility. Based on this outcome, update of sections 4.4 
and 4.8 of the Summary of Product Charateristics to add Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-Syndrome is 
recommended.  
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information of medicinal products containing nivolumab were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for nivolumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing nivolumab is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

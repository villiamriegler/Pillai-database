2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
2.1.  Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2013 was 
based on the following grounds: 
The sponsor Alexion Europe SAS submitted on 23 May 2013 an application for designation as an 
orphan medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product containing 
eculizumab for treatment of neuromyelitis optica (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”). The 
application was submitted on the basis of Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 
141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing eculizumab was 
considered justified based on preliminary clinical data showing a reduction in the number of 
relapses in patients treated with the product; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to neurological impairment such as paraplegia, sensory 
loss, bladder dysfunction, and central visual loss accompanied by ocular pain, and life-threatening 
with 5-year mortality reported as high as 30%; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 0.4 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
The sponsor has also established that there exists no satisfactory method of treatment that has been 
authorised in the European Union for patients affected by the condition. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing eculizumab, as an orphan medicinal product for the 
orphan indication: treatment of neuromyelitis optica. 
2.2.  Amendment of an existing orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the amendment of the orphan medicinal product designation 
in 2019 was based on the following grounds: 
Alexion Europe SAS, the sponsor of the orphan designation of a medicinal product 
containing eculizumab for treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, submitted on 20 
December 2018 an application for amendment of the existing designation. The proposed amended 
indication is: neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders.  The application was submitted on the basis of 
Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products.  
For the purpose of amendment of an existing designation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) considered that the amended condition proposed by the sponsor should be renamed 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000004454 
Page 4/8 
 
 
 
 
as “treatment of neuromyelitis optica disorders” (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) based on 
the current international diagnostic consensus (Wingerchuk et al., Neurology 2015; 85:1-13).  
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following:  
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing eculizumab was 
considered justified based on clinical data supporting a delay of relapse in treated patients;  
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to neurological impairment such as 
paraplegia, sensory loss, bladder dysfunction, peripheral pain, and increased 5-year mortality;   
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 0.4 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made.  
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled.  
The sponsor has also established that there exists no satisfactory method of treatment that has been 
authorised in the European Union for patients affected by the condition.  
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled.  
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
amendment of the designation as follows: the medicinal product containing eculizumab for the orphan 
indication: treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders.  
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of  
type II variation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The target condition is an inflammatory disorder of the CNS characterized by immune-mediated 
demyelination and axonal damage. It is characterised by the occurrence of events of myelitis and optic 
neuritis with variable and incomplete recovery that result in permanent impairment. The myelitis 
typically affects an area greater than three vertebral segments long, and causes severe paraplegia, 
sensory loss and bladder dysfunction.  
In 2015, the International Panel for NMO Diagnosis developed revised diagnostic criteria for the 
neuromyelitis optica (Wingerchuk, Neurology 2015 Jul 14; 85(2): 177–189). Importantly, the new 
nomenclature qualifies the unifying term NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSD), which is stratified further 
by serologic testing (NMOSD with or without AQP4-antibodies). Accordingly, the applicant had 
submitted before the MAA application, a request for amendment of the orphan designation “treatment 
of neuromyelitis optica” to “treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder”. 
This current consensus describes 6 core clinical characteristics: optic neuritis, acute myelitis, area 
postrema syndrome (episode of otherwise unexplained hiccups or nausea and vomiting), acute 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000004454 
Page 5/8 
 
 
 
 
brainstem syndrome, symptomatic narcolepsy or acute diencephalic clinical syndrome with typical MRI 
findings, symptomatic cerebral syndrome with MRI findings. In general for diagnostic purposes, at 
least 2 core characteristic (for the NMOSD without autoantibodies) or 1 core and autoantibody are 
described (Wingerchuk, Neurology 2015 Jul 14; 85(2): 177–189). 
The extension of Indication to include “treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) 
in adult patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody-positive with a relapsing course of the 
disease" falls within the proposed amendment of the orphan indication to “treatment of Neuromyelitis 
Optica Spectrum Disorders”. It is also to be noted that as reflected in the summary report of the initial 
procedure, the NMO designation encompassed both definite NMO cases and NMOSD cases. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The intention to treat the condition was accepted based on the positive benefit/risk assessment of the 
CHMP (see EPAR of Soliris). 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The applicant discusses the relapses in affected patients, resulting in severe, permanent neurologic 
impairment. In the majority of cases (approximately 80%), relapses occur by 2-3 years after the index 
event. Clinical attacks progress over days with varying, usually incomplete, recovery over the next few 
months. Ambulatory and visual deficits affect most patients (Oh and Levy, Neurology Research 
International Volume 2012, Article ID 460825). 
A decrease in mortality compared to what has been initially reported in the literature, is acknowledged 
by the applicant, which is attributed to the use of immunosuppressive treatment. It is at the same time 
noted that the annual mortality rate of patients with NMOSD remains at nearly 10% ((9.4% mortality 
over 99 months for a group of aquaporin-4 antibody-seropositive patients) (Kitley et al, Brain 2012: 
135; 1834–1849)).  
The COMP acknowledged that NMOSD is chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to neurological 
impairment such as paraplegia, sensory loss, bladder dysfunction, peripheral pain, and increased 5-
year mortality.   
Number of people affected or at risk 
After conducting a literature and database search, the sponsor is proposing a 0.44 per 10,000 
prevalence figure, based on population-based study in Denmark. This study estimated the incidence 
and prevalence of NMO in a predominantly Caucasian population based on the Wingerchuk 2006 
criteria, drawing from the 4 neurology and 3 ophthalmology departments in the Region of Southern 
Denmark. The prevalence was estimated to be 4.4 per 100,000 ((95% CI 3.1–5.7) (Asgari, Neurology 
2011;76:1589–1595). 
Several other studies are also cited in the sponsor’s application and the prevalence for NMOSD ranged 
from 0.52 to 4.4 per 100,000. In a study by Cossburn et al (Eur J Neurol. 2012;19(4):655-9) 
prevalence was determined to be 1.96 per 100,000 persons and was considered as a good estimate of 
the prevalence of diagnosed NMOSD in Caucasians. 
The study by Asgari et al, was considered to be reporting the highest and most conservative figure 
from the list of epidemiological studies identified by the sponsor. Therefore, it was acknowledged that 
the number of affected patients is at the time of maintenance described in the literature to be up to 
approximately 0.4 in 10,000 people in the EU.

Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
There are no authorised products for the sought condition that have been identified by the sponsor. 
The off-label use of systemic immunosuppressants in the condition has been further discussed: the 
literature has described courses of glucocorticoids for the treatment of attacks in patients, who are not 
responding to therapeutic plasma exchange (Kleiter et al. Ann Neurol. 2016 Feb;79(2):206-16. Epub 
2015 Nov 26). For the prevention of attacks, chronic use of immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, 
mycophenolate and rituximab has been suggested (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/712652/2014). The COMP does 
not consider off-label use of medicinal products for the demonstration of significant benefit.  
In conclusion, the COMP confirmed that there are currently no satisfactory methods for the treatment 
of the condition. 
Significant benefit 
In the absence of satisfactory methods, including authorised medicinal products for the treatment of 
NMSOD, a significant benefit justification is not required.

4.  COMP position adopted on 26 July 2019 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated orphan medicinal product; 
the prevalence of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (hereinafter referred to as “the 
condition”) was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 0.4 
in 10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria;  
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to manifestations such as visual 
impairment, paraplegia, sensory loss, bladder dysfunction, peripheral pain, and increased 5-year 
mortality; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the European Union for 
patients affected by the condition. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Soliris (eculizumab), 
EU/3/13/1185 for treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders is not removed from the 
Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

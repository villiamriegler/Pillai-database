1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Roche Registration GmbH submitted on 20 December 2018 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Polivy, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
Polivy was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/18/2013 on 16 April 2018 in the following 
condition: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Polivy as an orphan medicinal product in the approved 
indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance assessment 
report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/polivy 
Polivy was granted eligibility to PRIME on 22 June 2017 in the following indication: Treatment of relapsed 
and refractory patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). 
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time in view of the following: 
•  Despite overall improvement in DLBCL outcomes after frontline therapy with R-CHOP, approximately 
30-40% of patients will not respond to initial therapy or will eventually relapse and the unmet medical 
need in DLBCL was therefore agreed. 
•  Clinical results available at the time showed in a phase II study high ORR of 68% (CR=53%; 
PR=15%) with polatuzumab vedotin in combination with bendamustine and rituximab. PFS was 
greater than that reported with bendamustine + rituximab alone (6 months vs. 2.4 months 
respectively, with HR=0.33; 95% CI 0.18, 0.6) and the median OS was 10.4 months as compared to 
4.5 months in the bendamustine + rituximab arm (HR=0.33; 95%CI 0.17-0.64). 
• 
In view of the available evidence, it was considered that polatuzumab vedotin could have the potential 
to provide a major therapeutic advantage in the treatment of relapsed and refractory patients with 
DLBCL. 
The applicant applied for the following indication “Polivy in combination with bendamustine and rituximab 
is indicated for the treatment of previously treated adult patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) who are not candidates for haematopoietic stem cell transplant”. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0117/2018 on the granting of a class waiver.

Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products. 
Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
Accelerated assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance polatuzumab vedotin contained in the above medicinal 
product to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of 
a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
PRIME support 
Upon granting of eligibility to PRIME, the Rapporteur was appointed by the CHMP. 
A kick-off meeting was subsequently organised with the EMA, Rapporteur, assessors’ team and experts 
from relevant scientific committees. The objective of the meeting was to discuss the development 
programme and regulatory strategy for the product. The applicant was recommended to address the 
following key issues through relevant regulatory procedures: quality development aspects, adequacy of 
clinical development progamme to support marketing authorisation, proposed combinations. 
Scientific Advice

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Polivy in combination with bendamustine and rituximab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with  relapsed/refractory  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma  (DLBCL)  who  are  not  candidates  for 
haematopoietic stem cell transplant.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology   
Diffuse  large  B  cell  lymphoma  (DLBCL)  is  the  most  frequent  non-Hodgkin  lymphoma  (NHL),  with  an 
incidence  of  3.8/100000/year  in  Europe.  This  aggressive  lymphoma  is  an  adult/early  elderly  disease. 
About one-third of patients will develop relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease which remains a major cause of 
morbidity and mortality of this disease (Friedberg 2011) whereas approximately 60% of patients may be 
cured with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP), the current 
standard of care (Vitolo et al. 2017).   
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
DLBCL is a heterogeneous disease with distinctive prognostic profiles including cell of origin (activated 
B-cell-like  [ABC],  germinal  center  B-cell-like  [GCB])  or  elevated  expression of  MYC  and  BCL2  seen  in 
double-expressor lymphoma [DEL]) which have been mostly characterized in the first-line (1L) setting 
(Schmitz et al. 2018; Scott et al. 2015; Lenz et al. 2008; Johnson et al. 2012; Johnson et al. 2009). 
The human CD79b, - a signaling component of the B-cell receptor (BCR) -is located on the surface of B 
cells. As such, CD79b expression is restricted to normal cells within the B-cell lineage (with the exception 
of plasma cells) and malignant B cells; it is expressed in >95% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 
(Koyama et al. 1997; Dornan et al. 2009; Zheng et al. 2009; Martin 2010; Rickert 2013; Pfeifer et al. 
2015). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Outcomes for patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL are poor.  
After failure of front-line therapy, the main consideration for determining the treatment approach in the 
second-line setting is whether the patient is a haematopoietic stem cell transplant candidate. Most of R/R 
patients  are  ineligible  for  autologous  stem  cell  transplant  (ASCT)  due  to  age,  co-morbidities  or 
chemotherapy-insensitive  disease.  The  treatment  approach  for  such  patients  in  the  second-line  (2L) 
setting  as  well  as  for  all  patients  beyond  2L  is  a  palliative  approach  although  there  is  still  a  goal  of 
improving survival, albeit not necessarily with a curative intent. Outcomes of such transplant-ineligible 
patients (including patients who relapse after ASCT) remain poor, with median overall survival (OS) of 
approximately 6 months (Mounier et al. 2013; Crump et al. 2017; Czuczman et al. 2017). 
While DLBCL is mostly frequently diagnosed between the ages of 65 and 74 years of age with median age 
at diagnosis of 65 years (SEER), it can also occur in the younger population including children and young 
adults. 
2.1.5.  Management 
As  per  current  guidelines,  the  first  line  treatment  is  mainly  based  on  RCHOP  therapeutic  sequence. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019 
Page 10/159 
  
  
 
 
Overall, 30% of DLBCL patients ultimately relapse. 
In  transplant  non-eligible  (TNE)  patients,  fewer  therapeutic  options  are  available  in  second  line 
treatment,  mainly  with  platinum-  and/or  gemcitabine-based  regimens,  and  clinical  trials  with  novel 
drugs. In 3rd or over treatment line, patients are driven to palliative care or clinical trials. 
An unmet medical need remains for patients with R/R DLBCL who are ineligible for transplant or fail 
ASCT. Of patients eligible for transplant, less than half of patients who proceed to HSCT will be cured 
(Seyfarth et al. 2006; Gisselbrecht et al 2010). For those patients who are ineligible for transplant all 
together,  the  outcome  is  dismal  with  generally  no  chance  of  prolonged  periods  of  disease  control 
(Thieblemont and Coiffier 2007). Moreover, primary refractory patients who progress through front-line 
therapy do very poorly even after receipt of salvage treatment followed by autologous transplant with a 
3–year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 17% (Vardhana et al. 2017). 
The CAR T-cell therapies represent a treatment option for R/R DLBCL patients that had two or more prior 
lines of systemic therapy, with sufficient disease control to await the manufacturing times, who are able 
to  tolerate  the  conditioning  regimen  (usually  fludarabine/cyclophosphamide),  treatment  emergent 
cytokine-release syndrome and sometimes severe neurotoxicities.  
Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) is a CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell 
immunotherapy. Of 111 patients who underwent leukapheresis in the ZUMA-1 trial, 101 received 
Yescarta. Nine patients were not treated, primarily due to progressive disease or serious adverse events 
after enrolment and prior to cell delivery. One out of 111 patients did not receive the product due to 
manufacturing failure. The median time from leukapheresis to product delivery was 17 days (range: 14 to 
51 days), and the median time from leukapheresis to infusion was 24 days (range: 16 to 73 days). The 
median dose was 2.0 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg. ITT was defined as all patients who underwent 
leukapheresis; mITT was defined as all patients who received Yescarta. The primary endpoint was 
objective response rate (ORR) was 66% at 12 months and CR was 47%. 
Kymriah is an immunocellular therapy containing tisagenlecleucel, autologous T cells genetically modified 
ex vivo using a lentiviral vector encoding an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). The pivotal study 
(C2201) is a multicentre, single-arm phase II study in adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. 
Of 165 patients enrolled, 111 patients received infusion with Kymriah (4 infusions were pending at the 
time of analysis); for 12 patients (7%) Kymriah could not be manufactured. Approximately 30% of 
patients discontinued the study prior to Kymriah administration. Reasons for discontinuation prior to 
Kymriah infusion included death (n=16; 10%), physician decision/primary disease progression (n=16; 
10%), patient decision (n=3; 2%) or adverse events (n=2; 1%) while awaiting Kymriah manufacturing in 
the clinical study. The complete response rate was 37%. 
Pixuvri as single-agent was evaluated in a multicentre, randomised, active controlled trial against 
investigator chosen single-agent chemotherapy on the comparator arm in patients with relapsed or 
refractory aggressive NHL after receiving at least two prior therapies; 11.4% of patients treated with 
Pixuvri showed a complete response as compared to 0% in the comparator arm.

activity against B-cell malignancies.

Polatuzumab vedotin specifically binds human CD79b, a signaling component of the B-cell receptor (BCR) 
located on the surface of B cells.  
Therefore, targeted delivery of MMAE is expected to be restricted to these cells. Upon binding CD79b, 
polatuzumab vedotin is rapidly internalized (Polson et al. 2007, 2009; Pfeifer et al. 2015) and the linker 
is cleaved by lysosomal proteases, leading to intracellular release of MMAE (Sutherland et al. 2006). The 
released  MMAE  binds  to  microtubules  and  kills  dividing  cells  by  inhibiting  cell  division  and  inducing 
apoptosis (Bai et al. 1990; Doronina et al. 2003; Francisco et al. 2003). 
The  recommended  dose  of  Polivy  is  1.8  mg/kg,  given  as  an  intravenous  infusion  every  21  days  in 
combination with bendamustine and rituximab for 6 cycles.  Polivy, bendamustine and rituximab can be 
administered in any order on Day 1 of each cycle. When administered with Polivy, the recommended dose

of  bendamustine  is  90  mg/m2/day  on  Day  1  and Day  2  of  each  cycle  and  the  recommended  dose  of 
rituximab is 375 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each cycle. 
Polatuzumab vedotin was initially developed as a 100 mg liquid formulation, used in several studies 
including the pivotal study. The lyophilised formulation was developed, with 140mg strength intended for 
marketing.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered 
to be of major public health interest. This was based on the expectation that the product fulfils an unmet 
medical need in the claimed indication as Polivy is intended for patients for whom no approved treatment 
exists (2nd line DLBCL) and  newly authorized treatments such as car-T cells in 3rd line are associated with 
delay on treatment production from patients’ blood- and preliminary results on efficacy and safety as of 
improved complete response rate over the comparator and improved outcomes in terms of secondary 
endpoints. 
However,  during  the  assessment  the  CHMP  concluded  that  it  was  no  longer  appropriate  to  pursue 
accelerated  assessment,  as  there  were  issues  identified  that  could  not  be  handled  in  an  accelerated 
timetable and since  the CHMP decided to consult the Scientific Advisory group on Oncology on some of 
these issues and for this purpose the assessment would exceed 150 days. 
During the assessment the applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing 
Authorisation in accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following 
criteria: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
In response to a CHMP question, the applicant aknowledgeed that the evidence provided is based on 
a small exploratory trial in a very heterogeneous population in terms of prognosis. Available data are 
thus considered non-comprehensive and a conditional approval is therefore considered appropriate 
in order to confirm the size and duration of the effect in a larger population. 
The primary CSR for study GO29365 including the primary analysis of Arm H (n=64) as well as a 
pooled  analysis  of  Arm  G  (n=42)  and  Arm  H  (n=64)  was  proposed  to  be  provided  as  a  specific 
obligation. Distinct histology subtypes will be analysed within Arm H which is considered necessary 
to confirm response in any relevant subtype at least on a descriptive level.  
The  applicant  also  proposed  to  provide  Study  GO39942,  a  randomized,  double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial that evaluates polatuzumab vedotin in combination with R-CHP (rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone) versus R-CHOP in patients with previously untreated 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival. Key secondary 
endpoints include complete remission rate per independent review committee and overall survival. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as  
The indication for Polivy includes patients in 2nd line of treatment for which no approved treatment 
exists, therefore Polivy will cover an unmet need in this population. 
Whilst  in  the  3rd  and  further  lines  of  treatment  Pixuvri  (pixantrone)  and  the  CAR-T  therapies 
Yescarta and Kymriah are centrally approved Polivy still fulfils an unmet need in those areas as it 
provides improved efficacy compared to Pixuvri and a better safety profile comparing to CAR-T 
therapies. Also importantly, due to the complex manufacturing of CAR-Ts, their distribution and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019

need  for  intense  monitoring  this  treatment  modality  is  currently  limited  to  specialized  tertiary 
centers  and  for  patients  who  are  well  enough  to  withstand  the  delays  in  receiving  an  active 
treatment; Polivy will present a major contribution to patients’ health as it will be a treatment for 
immediate administration to the patient.  
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that 
additional data are still required.  
Since the benefit- risk of Polivy is positive in the claimed indication, with a manageable safety 
profile and an unmet need is fulfilled, the benefits to the patients from its immediate availability 
outweigh the risks associated with the fact that further efficacy and safety data in a larger 
population are expected.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The active substance (INN: Polatuzumab vedotin) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a 
humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) anti-CD79b monoclonal antibody (polatuzumab antibody 
intermediate) and an antimitotic agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), linked through a 
protease-cleavable linker, maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-paminobenzyloxycarbonyl (mc-vc-PAB). 
The antimitotic agent and linker are referred to as the linker-drug, vcMMAE. 
The finished product is presented as a powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing 140 mg 
of polatuzumab vedotin as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: succinic acid, sodium hydroxide, sucrose, and polysorbate 20.  
The product is available in 20 mL vial (Type 1 glass, colourless) with a stopper (fluororesin laminate), with 
an aluminium seal with plastic flip-off cap. 
This report includes dedicated sections for the linker-drug intermediate and polatuzumab antibody 
intermediate, followed by the active substance and finished product sections. 
2.2.2.  Linker-drug intermediate 
General Information (linker-drug intermediate) 
The linker-drug intermediate vcMMAE is composed of a cytotoxic auristatin, a cleavable dipeptide linker 
and a maleimido group for conjugation to the terminal thiol of a cysteine. This same linker-drug structure 
was utilised in the centrally authorised product Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin). 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation (linker-drug intermediate) 
The vcMMAE linker-drug intermediate is manufactured from six starting materials using a convergent, 
solution phase peptide synthesis, consisting of six separate stages and five isolated intermediates.  
The manufacturing process is overall adequately described. The proposed starting materials are the same 
as already approved in brentuximab vedotin and are acceptable. 
The overall control strategy contains elements of a traditional approach but includes extensive flexibility 
in the form of several PARs (Proven Acceptable Ranges) which go beyond what is normally expected as 
normal variability. The development section describes lab scale multivariate experiments conducted to 
support the proposed flexibility. The information is considered sufficient and it is considered that the 
proposed flexibility does not constitute a risk to the product quality across the manufacturing scale 
ranges. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019 
Page 15/159 
  
  
 
 
The manufacturing process has been satisfactorily validated. 
The impurity profile of vcMMAE is well established and the major impurities, either process-related or 
arising from degradation, were characterised and classified as conjugatable and non-conjugatable 
depending on the presence of the maleimido group.  
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, and container 
closure (linker-drug intermediate) 
The specification for vcMMAE linker-drug intermediate contains a suitable list of tests as per ICH Q6A. This 
includes tests for appearance/colour, identity, purity, assay, related substances, water content, specific 
rotation, residual solvents, and impurities. 
The proposed specification acceptance criteria were adequately justified. Concerning other potential 
impurities such as residual solvents and heavy metals, it is to be noted that the post-conjugation step of 
diafiltration normally eliminate these effectively. 
Analytical procedures were adequately described and validated. They were generally shown to be fit for 
use. 
The batch analysis results confirm consistency and uniformity of the drug-linker quality attributes and 
indicate that the process is under control. 
The vcMMAE linker-drug intermediate is stored either in a Type I amber glass vial, sealed with 
fluororesin-coated rubber serum stopper and an aluminum crimp seal or in a Type III amber glass jar, 
sealed with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-lined cap and white electrical tape. An inert headspace with 
either argon or nitrogen is applied prior to sealing.  
Stability (linker-drug intermediate) 
The stability profile of vcMMAE is considered well established. Stability data on several batches have been 
generated to support the proposed retest period of 36 months from date of manufacture when stored at 
– 20°C/ambient RH. No significant changes have been observed in the appearance, identity, assay, 
purity, and impurity profile of the linker-drug. 
The photostability study results demonstrate that the linker-drug is sensitive to light and is therefore 
stored in amber vials. 
In conclusion, a retest period of 3 years at -20°C when stored in USP/PhEur Type I/III amber glass vials 
is considered acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Polatuzumab antibody intermediate 
General Information (polatuzumab antibody intermediate) 
Polatuzumab antibody intermediate is a humanized monoclonal antibody based on a human 
immunoglobulin G1 framework. The recombinant antibody is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 
cells and consists of two heavy chains (447 amino acid residues each) and two light chains (218 amino 
acid residues each).  
Polatuzumab antibody intermediate displays microheterogeneity in glycosylation and other 
post-translational modifications of amino acids. The CH2 domain of each heavy chain (HC) has a single 
conserved glycosylation site at Asn297. The N-linked oligosaccharides of the antibody intermediate are 
typical of those observed on other CHO-produced monoclonal antibodies. The C-terminal lysine residues 
of the HCs (Lys447) are partially cleaved by cellular carboxypeptidases during the cell culture process, 
resulting in charge heterogeneity.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019 
Page 16/159 
  
  
 
 
The antibody has a molecular mass of 145,003 Da (peptide chains only, without heavy chain C-terminal 
lysine residues and with no glycosylation). 
The Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry confirm that the 
antibody intermediate is primarily a β-sheet structure, consistent with the structure of an IgG1 antibody. 
Polatuzumab antibody intermediate binds to the extracellular domain of CD79b, which is a component of 
the B-cell receptor. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation (polatuzumab antibody intermediate) 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Confirmation of the GMP status for the antibody intermediate manufacturing and testing sites was 
provided.  
The description of the manufacturing process and controls is appropriately detailed. Batch and scale 
definition is provided. The production consists of an expansion phase of WCB vials into stainless steel 
bioreactors, subsequently used to inoculate the main bioreactor. The production bioreactor operates in a 
fed-batch mode with non-selective medium and nutrient feeds during several days. Then, the harvest is 
collected and the secreted antibody intermediate is separated from cells and cell debris by centrifugation 
and filtration. The purification process includes three chromatography steps, two virus 
removal/inactivation steps, and one ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UFDF) step before final conditioning. 
Control of materials 
Information on the origin of the host cell line, on the development genetics (including origin of the gene 
and description of the gene construct) and on the establishment of the cell banks is provided. Master Cell 
Bank and Working Cell Bank were generated for commercial production. Both MCB and WCB are stored in 
liquid nitrogen at several independent sites. MCB and WCB were tested and characterized in accordance 
with ICH guideline requirements. The preparation and qualification procedures of future WCBs is 
described. 
A list of raw materials used in the manufacturing process, including filter and chromatography gels, is 
provided. Raw materials are tested according to European pharmacopoeia (where available), or according 
to in-house monographs.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Acceptable ranges are provided for each process parameter alongside the parameter’s designation as 
critical or non-critical. These include acceptable ranges for lifetime, regeneration, sanitization, and 
storage of chromatographic columns and UFDF membrane used during the purification process. 
Justification of acceptable ranges is supported by a combination of process validation studies, 
manufacturing experience, and prior knowledge. IPCs were classified in two categories whether they are 
defined by action limits or acceptance criteria. Most of the proposed IPCs relate to safety/microbial 
parameters (e.g. bioburden, viruses). Cell culture is also monitored by IPCs that evaluate process 
consistency (e.g. viability).  
Process validation 
Process validation was performed following a two-tiered approach. Four consecutive process performance 
qualification (PPQ) batches were produced at full-scale using the commercial v1.0 process and six 
additional clinical batches produced according to the same v1.0 manufacturing process were compared to 
the four PPQ batches. Evaluation of CQAs, IPCs, and performance parameters demonstrated that the 
manufacturing process is consistent throughout the process. A shift in glycosylation profile (sum of 
afucosylation and G0F) was observed between v1.0 clinical and v1.0 PPQ batches. This shift was assigned 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019 
Page 17/159 
  
  
 
 
to increased levels of trace element manganese impurity. As a result, a manganese acceptance criterion 
was implemented and a verification batch was produced, showing glycosylation levels comparable to 
previous v1.0 clinical manufacturing runs.  
Manufacturing process development 
Three manufacturing processes have been used throughout the process development history of the 
antibody intermediate: toxicology, v0.1, and v1.0. Process v0.1 provided batches used in the pivotal 
clinical Study GO29365, while material from process v1.0 was used in supportive phase 2 and 3 clinical 
trials, as well as in the arm G of the pivotal study. Impact of the different processes on comparability is 
discussed at the active substance level. 
An enhanced approach was used to establish acceptable ranges for the process parameters, as well as the 
assessment of their criticality. This approach was based on i) v1.0 clinical manufacturing experience, ii) 
risk ranking and filtering (RRF) assessment and iii), where appropriate, small-scale process parameter 
validation studies. The RRF assessment was based on prior knowledge, including product-specific process 
development data, scientific rationale, or validation data from similar processes. Small-scale process 
parameter validation studies consisted of a design of experiment study, single-factor studies, and 
transient excursion studies. Overall the CPPs and the process parameter acceptance ranges were 
thoroughly justified and, where appropriate, were supported by small-scale validation studies. The 
control strategy as proposed seems suitable to control the process and deliver a product with consistent 
quality. 
Acceptable hold times and temperatures for in-process pools are provided and supported by appropriate 
biochemical stability studies.  
Characterisation  
The characterization of the antibody intermediate is adequate. The material used for characterisation is 
the primary reference standard. Polatuzumab was characterized for molecular mass, primary structure, 
size heterogeneity, charge heterogeneity, pH, extinction coefficient, distribution of N-linked glycans, and 
CD79b binding. 
The expected primary structure of the antibody intermediate was confirmed by Electrospray ionization - 
mass spectrometry analysis using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer of intact, as well as analysis of 
reduced and reduced, deglycosylated antibody intermediate.  
The primary structure was also confirmed by endoproteinase Lys-C (Lys-C) peptide mapping.  
Analysis of isotope-labeled tryptic peptides by liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry was used to 
measure unformed disulfides as reactive unmodified sulfhydryl groups (or free thiol) at specific cysteine 
residues in polatuzumab antibody intermediate.  
Polatuzumab antibody intermediate contains an N-linked glycan site at Asn297. The N-linked 
glycosylation profile of polatuzumab antibody intermediate was assessed. The glycans were typical of 
those observed in the Fc domain of CHO-derived IgG1 antibodies.  
Size variants were determined using size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC), 
analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and non-reduced capillary electrophoresis sodium dodecyl sulfate 
(CE-SDS).  
Minor protein impurities, including host cell protein (HCP) of polatuzumab antibody intermediate 
reference standard, were evaluated with reversed-phase ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography 
coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019 
Page 18/159 
  
  
 
 
Charge heterogeneity was evaluated using imaged capillary isoelectric focusing (iCIEF) with 
carboxypeptidase B (CpB)-treatment.  
The mechanism of action (MOA) for B-cell depletion by polatuzumab vedotin requires direct binding of the 
antibody Fab domain to CD79b on the surface of B cells. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
that measures the ability of antibody intermediate to bind to CD79b was developed. The potency of 
samples is determined relative to the antibody intermediate reference standard.  
Product-related impurities such as size and charge variants have been sufficiently characterized and are 
controlled at release. For process-related impurities such as HCP, residual DNA and leached protein A IPC 
testing is performed. Contaminants such as bioburden and endotoxins are controlled at release. Removal 
of other process-related impurities has been demonstrated during process validation. 
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, and container 
closure (polatuzumab antibody intermediate) 
The specification for the polatuzumab antibody intermediate include tests for appearance, pH, osmolality, 
identity, purity, protein concentration, potency, microbiology, polysorbate and glycosylation. The 
proposed acceptance criteria are considered acceptable.  
The applicant commits to reevaluate the individual action limits and acceptance criteria for glycosylation 
variants once a sufficient number of antibody intermediate batches have been produced (See 
“Recommendations for future quality development”).  
Analytical methods 
The analytical procedures have been briefly described.  
Non-compendial analytical procedures have been validated according to ICH Q2 (R1). All results have 
passed the acceptance criteria specified in the method validation protocol. Compendial methods have 
been verified. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis results are provided for several batches produced by the v1.0 (commercial) process. 
Results confirm consistency and uniformity of the antibody intermediate, indicating that the process is 
under control.  
Reference materials 
The manufacturer established appropriately characterised in-house primary and secondary reference 
materials, prepared from lots representative of production and clinical materials (v1.0 process). The 
primary and secondary reference standards were qualified by release and extended characterization 
testing. All specifications were met. Aliquots of primary and secondary reference standards are stored at 
-70°C ± 20°C. The stability of the reference standards is confirmed annually. Preparation and 
qualification of future commercial reference standards are also described. 
Container closure system 
The antibody intermediate may be stored either in stainless steel tanks (120 L) for long-term storage or 
polyethylene bioprocess bags (20 L) for shipping to the active substance manufacturing site. The choice 
of the container closure systems was justified and both containers are in line with current pharmaceutical 
standards for biopharmaceutical manufacturing.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019

Stability (polatuzumab antibody intermediate) 
A shelf-life of 18 months at -20°C for the antibody intermediate is claimed with allowable hold times of up 
to 10 days at 5°C and up to 3 days at 25°C. This claim is based on stability studies that were carried out 
in accordance with current ICH/CPMP guidelines. 
Primary stability studies were performed on batches representative of the v1.0 commercial 
manufacturing process. The containers used (mini-tanks and/or bioprocess bags) are considered 
representative of the antibody intermediate manufacturing-scale storage containers. The ratio of 
surface-area-to-volume for the mini-tank and bioprocess bags is greater than that of the 
manufacturing-scale storage container and represents a worst case. Up to 60 month stability data are 
available at -20°C.  
Accelerated (5°C) and stressed (25°C) stability studies were also conducted to confirm degradation 
products/pathways and support the proposed hold times of up to 10 days at 5 °C and up to 3 days at 
25 °C. The results showed that the overall degradation behaviour is consistent with primary studies. The 
other parameters do not display any significant change. 
2.2.4.  Active Substance 
General Information 
The active substance (INN: Polatuzumab vedotin) is an antibody-drug conjugate that contains the 
polatuzumab antibody intermediate and the linker-drug vcMMAE. 
The linker-drug is bound to the reduced interchain cysteine residues of the antibody heavy and light 
chains through a thioether bond between the linker maleimide and the cysteine thiol group. The structure 
of polatuzumab vedotin is shown in Figure 2. Following cleavage of the linker by intracellular proteases at 
the indicated site, a spontaneous rearrangement results in the release of free MMAE, p-aminobenzyl 
alcohol, CO2, and the antibody containing a fragment of the linker. The released MMAE binds to 
microtubules and kills dividing cells by inhibiting cell division and inducing apoptosis. 
Polatuzumab vedotin has an average of 3.5 linked MMAE moieties per antibody (drug-to-antibody ratio 
(DAR) = 3.5). The calculated molecular mass of polatuzumab vedotin, without C-terminal lysines and 
without N-linked glycosylation, is 149,613 Da.

Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturer of polatuzumab vedotin active substance is Lonza Ltd, Visp (Switzerland). Confirmation 
of the GMP status for the active substance manufacturing and testing sites was provided. 
The active substance manufacturing process and process controls are appropriately described. The 
process consists of thawing of the polatuzumab antibody intermediate, followed by a pH adjustment and 
dilution step to prepare the subsequent reaction steps. The tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine solution is 
added to partially reduce the interchain disulfide bonds of the antibody and then, the vcMMAE 
intermediate is added for conjugation. The antibody free thiols react with the maleimide functional group 
of the linker-drug intermediate to form the antibody-drug conjugate. An UF/DF step is applied to 
concentrate and buffer-exchange the product and removes small molecules (i.e. NAC). Finally, the 
recovered ultrafiltration and diafiltration pool is conditioned to the final concentration and composition of 
the active substance: 20 mg/mL polatuzumab vedotin in 10 mM sodium succinate, 120 mM sucrose, 1.2 
mg/mL polysorbate 20, pH 5.3. The active substance is frozen in a freeze/thaw tank using a freeze/thaw 
skid.  
For all steps adequate CPPs were defined. The CPPs are a subset of process parameters that have been 
determined to impact or may potentially impact CQAs of the active substance. 
Control of materials 
A list of raw materials used in the manufacture of polatuzumab vedotin active substance, as well as their 
quality grade, has been provided.  
Process validation 
Validation of the active substance manufacturing process was performed on three PPQ batches 
manufactured in 2018. In addition, clinical batches were compared with the three PPQ batches for 
consistency purpose. All batches were manufactured according to the commercial v1.0 manufacturing 
process. Overall, the data showed that the selected quality attributes, key performance indicators, and 
IPCs met their acceptance criteria when process parameters operated within their acceptable ranges. The 
manufacturing process demonstrated consistent results between clinical and PPQ batches. 
Removal of raw materials was satisfactorily addressed. All results were below the limit of quantitation of 
the assay and below the toxicology-based limits. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A process impact assessment was conducted for CQAs. The proposed process risk score for size-and 
charged-related variants, oxidation related variants and structural variants is considered acceptable. Of 
special interest are conjugation-related variants. The proposed active substance release acceptance 
criterion for DAR is considered sufficient. As the main MOA is mediated by the drug the absence of control 
of the free antibody is acceptable. To classify drug distribution and conjugation site distribution as low risk 
is accepted because of the tight DAR control. Free drug is monitored at release and the acceptance 
criterion was tightened. 
Polatuzumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate produced from two intermediates: the polatuzumab 
antibody intermediate and the linker-drug vcMMAE. Please refer to the respective sections for the two 
intermediates for further details. 
Stability of in-process pools was validated and the hold times are defined.

Manufacturing process development 
As stated for the polatuzumab intermediate, three different versions (toxicology, v0.1, and v1.0) of the 
active substance manufacturing process were used during development. Comparability assessment 
between materials from process v0.1 (liquid form) used in pivotal clinical Study GO29365 and materials 
intended for commercial process v1.0 (lyophilized form) used in phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials, as well 
as in arm G of the pivotal clinical study, exhibited significant differences for glycosylation attributes (M5, 
sum of afucosylation, and G0F). Increased levels of M5 and sum of afucosylation were observed for v1.0 
batches as compared to v0.1 batches, correlated with a decrease for G0F. According to the applicant, if 
the observed difference in total afucosylation (M5 and sum of afucosylation) results in a corresponding 
increase in ADCC-related activities for the v1.0-derived active substance batches, the impact on patient 
efficacy and safety is expected to be minimal taking into account that i) safety and efficacy are 
predominantly driven by MMAE-mediated effects and are not expected to be impacted by variations in 
effector function, ii) no detectable exposure difference was observed in the rat PK comparability study and 
iii) the finished product is co-administered with anti-CD20 therapeutic agents that displayed higher 
effector functionality. From a quality point of view, this justification is considered acceptable and no 
additional analytical data is required.  
Characterisation  
The structure of polatuzumab vedotin active substance was elucidated from a variety of biological, 
biochemical, and biophysical techniques to provide a comprehensive understanding of its structure and 
functional properties and assessment of critical quality attributes. 
Two potency methods (binding and cell-based assays) were developed to monitor potency of the active 
substance/finished product and to characterize the biological activities of product variants. FcγR binding 
properties of the antibody intermediate and polatuzumab vedotin reference standards were also 
characterized using surface plasmon resonance methods. Both polatuzumab antibody intermediate and 
polatuzumab vedotin exhibit lower binding to FcγRs relevant to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity 
(ADCC) (FcγRIIIa), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (FcγRI, FcγRIIa), and inhibitory effects 
(FcγRIIb) compared to another IgG1 antibody, rituximab. Glycosylation, conjugation, and DAR 
demonstrated either enhancing (afucosylation) or inhibitory (conjugation, DAR) effects on in vitro ADCC 
activity. In addition, neither polatuzumab antibody intermediate nor polatuzumab vedotin shows 
detectable complement-dependent cytotoxicity activity. 
Impurities include product-related impurities (charge and size variants), vcMMAE-related impurities, 
process-related impurities (MMAE, VC-MMAE and NAC-VC-MMAE) and residual solvents (DMA, glacial 
acetic acid). 
Product-related impurities and free drug are controlled at release. vcMMAE-related impurities are not 
controlled at active substance level. However, even if not cleared by the UFDF step, these impurities 
would be present at low amounts only. Palladium is controlled upstream by the specification on vcMMAE 
prior to entering the conjugation process. 
Product- and process-related impurities are sufficiently controlled at polatuzumab vedotin active 
substance level. 
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, and container 
closure 
An appropriate set of test methods to be routinely applied to active substance specifications was selected. 
Tests include appearance, pH, osmolality, identity, purity, protein concentration, free drug, residual 
solvents, DAR, potency, microbiology and polysorbate 20. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019

Residual N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), which is a Class 2 solvent used to solubilize vcMMAE in the 
reduced antibody solution, is monitored by RP-HPLC with an acceptance limit. This is acceptable. The 
content of the stabilizer polysorbate 20 is controlled at release. As mentioned before, the range of free 
drug observed was below LoQ and the release acceptance criterion was tightened. It is recommended to 
revise the proposed acceptance criteria for charge variants once sufficient data will be available (See 
“Recommendations for future quality development”). 
The acceptance criteria were established taking the following considerations into account: clinical 
experience, stability and process effects, product-specific knowledge, prior knowledge, current 
compendia or regulatory guidelines, and formulation development studies. 
Analytical methods 
Analytical procedures have been adequately described.  
The potency of polatuzumab vedotin is controlled by an ELISA that measures the ability of antibody 
intermediate to bind to CD79b. The ELISA uses a peptide that corresponds to the anti-CD79b antibody 
epitope on the CD79b receptor’s extracellular domain. Bound polatuzumab vedotin is detected with a 
mouse anti-auristatin antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody, and a peroxidase substrate solution. 
The cell-based bioassay measures the ability of polatuzumab vedotin to induce the killing of cells from a 
CD79b-expressing human B cell line.  
Non-compendial analytical procedures have been validated according to ICH Q2 (R1). All results have 
passed the acceptance criteria specified in the method validation protocol. Compendial methods have 
been verified. 
Batch analysis 
Representative batch analysis data are provided for polatuzumab vedotin active substance batches 
manufactured for the purpose of clinical testing as well as process validation of the manufacturing 
process. For the current v1.0 manufacturing process batch analysis data for clinical batches and PPQ 
batches were presented. All batches were manufactured at Lonza located in Visp, Switzerland. For 
batches manufactured according to the previous v0.1 process multiple batches (including the v0.1 
reference standard) have been presented. For all batches predefined acceptance criteria which were in 
effect at time of batch analysis and release were met and the results confirm consistency and uniformity 
of the product.  
Reference materials 
The same reference standard is used for the active substance as for the finished product. Reference is 
made to the finished product section. 
Container closure system 
120 L Hastelloy freeze/thaw tanks are used for polatuzumab vedotin active substance storage. The 
container closure system is in line with current pharmaceutical containers used for biotech product 
manufacturing. An adequate justification for not performing specific extractable and leachable studies is 
provided. 
Stability 
The Company claims an active substance shelf-life of 3 years when stored at -20°C (including hold times 
of up to 5 days at 5 °C and up to 3.5 days at 25 °C). 
This claim is based on data obtained from PPQ batches, plus clinical batches produced using the 
commercial manufacturing process (v1.0) and stored in Hastelloy mini-tanks; up to 48 months of data are

available under long-term storage conditions (-20 °C) and 6-month stability data are available under 
accelerated conditions (6 months at 5 °C). All studies were carried out in accordance with current 
ICH/CPMP guidelines. In addition, stress stability studies (28 days at 25 °C/60% RH) were conducted on 
three batches to confirm degradation products/pathways and support the hold time of 3.5-day at 25 °C. 
The long-term, real time, real-condition stability studies show minor increases in sum of HMW forms, with 
corresponding decrease in main peak. The same trends were observed for accelerated and stressed 
stability studies. In addition, batches under stress conditions exhibited an increase of the acidic region. 
Little or no change was observed for all other attributes tested. This suggests that methods used in 
stability studies are stability-indicating and are qualified for their intended use. 
2.2.5.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development  
Polatuzumab vedotin finished product is provided in single-dose 20 mL vials as a sterile, white to 
grayish-white lyophilized cake and contains no preservatives. It is intended for intravenous infusion after 
reconstitution with sterile water for injections (SWFI, not supplied) and dilution in 0.9% sodium chloride 
solution, 0.45% sodium chloride solution, or 5% dextrose solution. 
The composition of the finished product is shown in Table 2. Reconstitution of the finished product with 
7.2 mL of SWFI yields approximately 7.52 mL of reconstituted solution containing 20 mg/mL 
polatuzumab vedotin in 10 mM succinate, 120 mM sucrose, 1.2 mg/mL polysorbate 20, pH 5.3. The 
reconstituted finished product solution is unchanged with regard to concentration and composition 
compared to the active substance solution. Each vial is designed to deliver 140 mg of polatuzumab 
vedotin.

not include novel excipients and complies with the requirements and specifications of the relevant 
compendial monographs. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product formulation evolved from a liquid formulation (v0.1 process) containing 10 mg/mL 
polatuzumab vedotin in histidine buffer to a lyophilized formulation (v1.0 process) containing 170 mg/vial 
(and thereafter 140 mg/vial) polatuzumab vedotin in succinate buffer. The lyophilized dosage form was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019 
Page 24/159 
  
  
 
 
introduced to improve product stability. The dosage of 140 mg/vial is the one intended for 
commercialization. 
A comparability assessment was conducted between the liquid formulation and the lyophilized finished 
product. The lyophilised finished product exhibited a better stability profile than the liquid form. 
The primary container closure system consists of a type I glass vial with a rubber stopper. The rubber 
stopper is crimped with an aluminum seal fitted with a plastic flip-off cap. The seal and cap do not come 
into contact with the finished product. The choice of the container closure system is in line with 
pharmaceutical standards and the components comply with pharmacopeial requirements. Compatibility 
of the container closure system with the dosage form was assessed with respect to physico-chemical 
testing (i.e. extractables and leachables), stability testing, and container closure integrity testing. 
Polatuzumab vedotin was found to be compatible with the primary packaging components. Interaction 
between the finished product and the container closure is expected to be limited since the product is 
presented as a powder. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed through a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities 
The microbiological quality complies with European requirements for sterile products and is ensured by a 
combination of various measures: process validation, manufacturing controls, in-process testing and 
release and stability testing. 
The finished product is intended to be administered at the dose of 1.8 mg/kg via intravenous infusion 
using infusion line equipped with a 0.2-0.22 µm filter. Physico-chemical stability of the reconstituted 
solution and the diluted infusions (with either 0.9% sodium chloride solution, 0.45% sodium chloride 
solution, or 5% dextrose solution) were demonstrated for the durations and conditions as listed in the 
product information. From a microbiological point of view, the prepared solution should be used 
immediately. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Roche Pharma AG, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany, is responsible for EU batch certification. Confirmation of 
the GMP status for the finished product manufacturing and testing sites has been provided. 
The finished product manufacturing process is standard and consists of thawing of the active substance 
(one or two batches) followed by a 0.2 µm filtration for bioburden reduction. The finished product solution 
is then sterilized through two membrane filters in series immediately prior to filling. The vials are partially 
stoppered and conveyed to lyophilizer. Upon completion of the lyophilization cycle, vials are fully 
stoppered and capped, and a 100% visual inspection is performed before shipping for labelling and 
packaging. The level of detail in the description of the manufacturing process is deemed sufficient.  
Validation of the finished product manufacturing process is based on analysis of three consecutive PPQ 
batches. The validation studies included the control of all process parameters (CPPs and non-CPPs) and 
IPCs, as well as CQAs. The results met acceptance criteria, demonstrating the finished product 
manufacturing process is consistent throughout the different steps (thawing, filtration, pooling, filling, 
and lyophilisation).  
The applicant applied Quality by Design (QbD) principles in the development of the finished product and 
to define the acceptable ranges of process parameters. However, no design spaces were claimed for the 
manufacturing process of the finished product. The in-process hold times are specified and validated 
through a combination of different studies (media fills, process design experiments, stability studies). 
Studies were also performed to provide assurance of transport of the polatuzumab vedotin finished 
product.

Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The commercial release and stability specification for polatuzumab vedotin finished product includes tests 
for appearance, particles, pH, osmolality, moisture, reconstitution time, identity, purity, protein 
concentration, free drug, DAR, potency, microbiology and container closure integrity.  
The finished product specifications were established in line with ICH Q6B and monograph 2031 on 
monoclonal antibodies for human use.  
Acceptance criteria setting is based on a combination of several factors: clinical experience, stability and 
process effects, product-specific knowledge, prior knowledge, current compendia or regulatory 
guidelines, and formulation development studies. Overall the proposed specifications are considered 
justified and sufficient to deliver product with consistent quality. It is recommended to revise the 
proposed acceptance criteria for charge variants once sufficient data will be available (See 
“Recommendations for future quality development”). 
Analytical methods 
Characteristics of analytical procedures (e.g. accuracy, precision, specificity, linearity, range, 
quantitation limit) were validated as per ICH Q2 requirements.  
The potency assays assays (binding and cell based) are the same as for the active substance. 
Batch analysis 
Analytical results of 140 mg/vial finished product batches derived from process validation and clinical 
trials are provided. All batches were manufactured at the commercial site using the intended v1.0 
commercial process. All results comply with the defined acceptance criteria. 
Reference materials 
A two-tiered reference standard system, consisting of a primary and a secondary reference standard was 
established for polatuzumab vedotin active substance and finished product. The commercial primary 
reference standard will be used to qualify subsequent secondary reference standards. The secondary 
reference standard is used for testing the antibody intermediate in all assays requiring a reference 
standard. 
For commercial release and stability testing, Batch 608784 is used as the primary reference standard, and 
Batch 608785 is used as the secondary reference standard. Aliquots of primary and secondary reference 
standards are stored at -70°C ± 20°C. The stability of the reference standards is confirmed annually.  
The primary and secondary reference standards were qualified by release and extended characterization 
testing. All specifications were met. Preparation and qualification of future reference standards is also 
described.  
Stability of the product 
A 2-year shelf-life is claimed for the finished product, when stored at 2-8 °C and protected from light. The 
finished product should not be frozen or shaken. 
This claim is based on the data obtained from i) primary batches (clinical and PPQ) manufactured using 
the commercial process (data available up to 18 months at 2-8°C), ii) technical batch manufactured using 
the same lyophilization cycle as clinical batches and using the same finished product configuration as the 
clinical and commercial batches (data available up to 36 months at 2-8°C), and iii) supportive batches at 
170 mg/vial manufactured using the commercial process with the exception of an adjustment to the fill 
volume (data available up to 48 months at 2-8°C).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019 
Page 26/159 
  
  
 
 
No primary batches have reached the proposed 2 year shelf-life yet. The proposed shelf life is mainly 
based on data obtained from the 140 mg/vial technical batch and three 170 mg/vial clinical batches. 
Although the 140 mg/vial technical batch and the 170 mg/vial clinical batches are not fully representative 
of the commercial material, they were manufactured using the same manufacturing and lyophilization 
process parameters as the commercial process, and using the same container closure system. The 
differences are not expected to significantly impact the stability behaviour of the finished product, as 
demonstrated by the available long-term, accelerated, and stress stability data which showed a 
consistent stability profile between the 140 mg/vial and 170 mg/vial.  
The available stability data for samples stored at the recommended storage conditions (2-8°C) show good 
stability with no (significant) trends observed. Therefore, a 2-year shelf life can be granted for the finished 
product. 
Supportive data from accelerated and stressed stability studies are available. Under the accelerated and 
stressed conditions a decrease in purity is observed as reflected by a decrease in the amount of main peak 
and an increase in the amount of HMW forms, as measured by SE-HPLC. Furthermore, the charge 
distribution on iCIEF has been affected, resulting in an increase in acidic variants with a consequent 
decrease in main peak.  
To further support the shelf-life, a temperature cycling study has been initiated on one 140 mg/vial 
finished product PPQ batch to support potential temperature excursions/time out of recommended 
storage condition relevant for manufacturing, shipping, and handling of finished product vials. All current 
results are within specifications.  
Stability of the finished product when exposed to light was investigated for one batch in the commercial 
container closure material. Samples were exposed to conditions consistent with ICH Q1B and the stability 
was determined by comparing the results for an unprotected exposed sample in the primary packaging 
(unlabeled vial) to the results for vials stored in the secondary packaging (in carton), relative to results 
obtained from vials wrapped in foil (control). Results showed that the finished product is light sensitive. 
The packaging configuration adequately protects the finished product vials from light and the product 
label contains a note to store the product in the outer carton to protect from light. 
Adventitious agents 
The overall viral safety of Polutuzumab vedotin relies on: 
- The quality of starting materials (cell banks) and materials of biological origin 
- The capacity of the production process to remove or inactivate viruses 
- Virological control tests during the production process 
The data provided by the applicant regarding material of biological origin used is deemed sufficient 
regarding TSE compliance and viral safety. 
The data resulting from extensive experimental studies on the MCB, WCB, end of production cells (EPC)s 
and EPCs at the in vitro cell age do not reveal any viral contamination of these cell banks. 
The virological control tests on unprocessed bulk strategy is conclusive and conforms to ICH Q5A (R1). 
The data resulting from virological controls of three unprocessed bulk lots are deemed acceptable. 
The manufacturing process includes virus inactivation/removal and chromatography steps proven to clear 
adventitious viruses.  
Global reduction factors reported are satisfactory regarding the virus removal/inactivation for enveloped 
viruses as well as for non-enveloped viruses.

2.2.6.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the intermediates (linker-drug and antibody), 
active substance and finished product have been presented in a satisfactory manner.  
The linker-drug intermediate is the same as utilised in centrally authorised product Adcetris. The antibody 
intermediate, the active substance, and the finished product are appropriately described and the controls 
applied seem suitable to monitor the process and deliver a product with consistent quality.  
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and their 
manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed. 
2.2.7.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects   
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.8.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
The applicant commits to reevaluate the individual action limits and acceptance criteria for glycosylation 
variants once a sufficient number of antibody intermediate batches have been produced. The applicant is 
also recommended to include a revision of the acceptance criteria for charge variants for the antibody 
intermediate, active substance and finished product specifications.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Non-clinical in vivo efficacy studies of polatuzumab vedotin were performed using in xenograft tumour 
models derived from human B cell lymphomas established in SCID mice. These studies evaluated the 
treatment  with  polatuzumab  vedotin  as  monotherapy  or  in  combination  with  CD20-targeting 
antibodies/chemotherapy.  
The pivotal toxicity studies have been conducted under GLP regulations. Pharmacokinetic studies after 
single-dose administration were performed in SCID mice and Cynomolgus monkeys; TK analyses were 
performed  after  repeat-dose  administration  in  rats  and  Cynomolgus  monkeys.  In  these  studies,  test 
articles were administered IV, in accordance with the clinical route of administration. Tissue distribution 
studies  with  radiolabelled  polatuzumab  vedotin  and  MMAE  were  conducted  in  rats.  Metabolism  and 
excretion of polatuzumab vedotin and MMAE were assessed in rats and in vitro using animal and human 
hepatocytes /liver microsomes.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro pharmacodynamics 
Binding of polatuzumab vedotin and the surrogate ADC to PBMC [study 10-2535] 
The binding of polatuzumab vedotin and the surrogate ADC to PBMC from human, Cynomolgus monkey, 
rat, and mouse was assessed by flow cytometry. To identify B cells, PBMC were co-stained for B cell 
markers (CD20 in human and Cynomolgus, CD45RA in rat, and CD45R in mouse).  
Polatuzumab vedotin bound to human peripheral B cells and not to Cynomolgus monkey, rat, or mouse 
peripheral B cells. The surrogate ADC bound to Cynomolgus monkey peripheral B cells and not to human, 
rat, or mouse peripheral B cells.  
Sequence homology of human and rodent CD79b is low (approx. 68%). The overall sequence homology 
of human and Cynomolgus CD79b is higher, i.e. 85.3%. However, there are 3 amino acid differences in 
the epitope recognized by the anti-human CD79b antibody SN8 (parental Ab for polatuzumab) and the 
anti-Cynomolgus CD79b antibody (i.e. the first 21 N-terminal amino acids of CD79b (after removal of the 
signal sequence [Zheng et al., 2009]). This difference appears sufficient to prevent binding of 
polatuzumab to Cynomolgus CD79b.  
Evaluation of binding affinity [study 10-2298] 
Binding affinity of polatuzumab vedotin, polatuzumab Ab, surrogate ADC, and surrogate Ab to human and 
Cynomolgus monkey CD79b was determined by radiolabelled, equilibrium binding assays.  
Table 3. Binding Affinity of Polatuzumab Vedotin, Surrogate ADC, Polatuzumab Antibody, and Surrogate 
Antibody (Study 10-2298) 
Evaluation of anti-proliferative activity of polatuzumab vedotin, polatuzumab Ab and MMAE 
[study 10-2308] 
The anti-proliferative activities of polatuzumab vedotin, the polatuzumab Ab and MMAE were evaluated in 
a proliferation assay. To this end, the CD79b-positive Burkitt lymphoma cell line Ramos and the 
CD79b-negative T cell leukemia cell line Jurkat were incubated with increasing concentrations (0.5 pM to 
10 nM) of polatuzumab vedotin, polatuzumab antibody, or MMAE. After 3 days of incubation cell 
proliferation was measured using Cell Titer Glo II reagent and IC50 values were calculated using a 
four-parameter sigmoidal fit.

Table 4. IC50 for Polatuzumab Vedotin in Ramos and Jurkat Cells [Study 10-2308] 
Evaluation of cytokine-inducing potential of polatuzumab Ab and the surrogate Ab [study 
10-2299] 
Given that CD79b is a signalling component of the B-cell receptor (BCR), anti-CD79b antibodies have the 
potential to induce BCR signalling that may result in the production of cytokines. In particular, interleukin 
(IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TGF-α, GM-CSF, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β have been shown to be produced by B cells 
upon stimulation of the BCR [Zheng et al. 2009]. 
Thus, the capacity of unconjugated polatuzumab and the unconjugated surrogate antibody to stimulate 
cytokine release by PBMCs from healthy human donors or Cynomolgus monkeys was evaluated in vitro 
and compared to the stimulatory activity of positive control antibodies (OKT-3, alemtuzumab) or the 
negative control antibody trastuzumab.  
In human PBMCs exposed to polatuzumab only IL-1α and IP-10 were elevated above the negative-control 
level although at a level lower (IL-1α) or similar (IP-10) to that induced by OKT3. No other cytokine 
evaluated in the human PBMC experiments were elevated above the levels observed following exposure 
to trastuzumab.  
In Cynomolgus PBMCs exposed to the surrogate Ab, none of the cytokines evaluated was elevated above 
the level of the negative-control antibody (trastuzumab). The level of IP-10 and IL-1α, two cytokines with 
increased level observed in human PBMCs, could not be evaluated in Cynomolgus monkey PBMCs due to 
the lack of assay reagents for these cytokines. 
Binding to human FcγRs by polatuzumab vedotin and the surrogate ADC [study 10-2764] 
The objectives of this study were to evaluate to what extent conjugation to MMAE has an impact on Ab 
binding to Fcγ receptors. Thus, the binding affinities of polatuzumab Ab, polatuzumab vedotin, the 
surrogate Ab and ADC to human Fcγ receptors were assessed by ELISA and compared to that of the 
control antibody rituximab.

Evaluation of ADCC and CDC induced by polatuzumab vedotin and polatuzumab Ab [study 
10-2764] 
As human IgG1 polatuzumab Ab and polatuzumab vedotin may induce antibody-dependent cytotoxicity 
(ADCC) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity against CD79+ target cells. Therefore, the capacity to 
mediate these effector functions was evaluated and compared to that of rituximab, an anti-CD20 mAb.  
In the ADCC assay purified PBMCs from healthy donors were used as effector cells and the human 
B-lymphoma BJAB cell line was used as target. Rituximab was tested as a positive control for the assay, 
in addition to polatuzumab Ab and polatuzumab vedotin. To ensure that any observed ADCC activity from 
polatuzumab vedotin is not due to cytotoxicity of the MMAE, polatuzumab vedotin was also tested without 
the addition of PBMC effector cells.  
Figure 3. ADCC activities of polatuzumab vedotin, the polatuzumab Ab, and rituximab in BJAB Cells 
[study 10-2764] 
In the CDC assay with rabbit complement the positive control mAb rituximab induced CDC in BJAB target 
cells, while polatuzumab Ab and polatuzumab vedotin were negative for detectable CDC activity at Ab 
concentrations up to 10 µg/ml. 
Impact of co-treatment with anti-CD20 Ab on polatuzumab vedotin uptake and catabolism in 
vitro [study 15-0682] 
Polatuzumab vedotin is in clinical development for the treatment of indolent B-cell lymphoma in 
combination with CD20-targeting mAbs rituximab or obinutuzumab. Thus, the impact of co-treatment of 
rituximab or obinutuzumab on the uptake and catabolism of polatuzumab vedotin in WSU-DLCL2 tumour 
cells that expresses both CD79b and CD20 receptors was assessed in vitro using radio-labelled 
polatuzumab vedotin (anti-CD79b-vc-[3H]-MMAE). 
In this study, WSU-DLCL2 cell line (expressing both CD79b and CD20) and HT cell line (target negative) 
were either treated with [3H]-labelled tracer alone (polatuzumab vedotin-[3H]-MMAE at 0.0667 μCi/mL 
(equivalent to 1 μg/mL of ADC) or in combination with rituximab, obinutuzumab, unlabelled polatuzumab 
vedotin, or anti-gD at clinically relevant concentrations. Cells were harvested at 0, 3, 17, 24, and 48 hours 
following incubation at 37°C. Total cell numbers (dead and viable), viability, total radioactivity, and 
acetonitrile (ACN)-soluble and ACN-precipitable radioactivity were determined. In addition, the cell 
lysates were profiled for polatuzumab vedotin catabolites using RP-HPLC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019 
Page 31/159 
  
  
 
 
 
In WSU-DLCL2 cells, level of total radioactivity increased following treatment with polatuzumab vedotin 
tracer alone or co-treated with rituximab, obinutuzumab, or anti-gD antibody. In contrast, co-incubation 
of tracer with unlabelled polatuzumab vedotin significantly reduced the uptake of the tracer. These data 
indicate that the uptake of polatuzumab vedotin-[3H]-MMAE by WSU-DLCL2 cells is a 
target-specific-mediated process which is not impacted by co-treatment with anti-CD20 antibodies.  
There was little radioactivity detected in the target negative control HT cell line in any treatment group 
(data not shown).  
ACN precipitation of WSU-DLCL2 cell lysates showed comparable catabolism between tracer alone and 
co-treatment with rituximab, obinutuzumab, or anti-gD antibody. Profiling of WSU-DLCL2 cell lysates 
using RP-HPLC revealed a similar catabolite profile between tracer alone and co-treatment with rituximab, 
obinutuzumab, or anti-gD antibody. MMAE was identified as the only detectable catabolite in all groups 
regardless of treatment. 
In vivo pharmacodynamics 
Comparison of polatuzumab vedotin and surrogate ADC against human Burkitt lymphoma 
xenograft [study 09-0406 B] 
The anti-tumour activity of polatuzumab Ab, polatuzumab vedotin and of the surrogate Ab and ADC was 
compared in a murine xenograft model with the BJAB Burkitt lymphoma transfectant cell line which 
expresses comparable amounts of human CD79b and recombinant Cynomolgus CD79b. The anti-Her2 
ADC was used as negative control ADC. Results are shown in Fig. 2-3 below.  
Tumour growth inhibition was observed with polatuzumab vedotin and the surrogate ADC, but not with 
the Her2-targeting control ADC or polatuzumab and the surrogate Ab. The effects of polatuzumab vedotin 
and surrogate ADC were more pronounced at 2 mg/kg than at 1 mg/kg.

This study assessed the anti-tumour activity of polatuzumab Ab and its conjugate polatuzumab vedotin 
against human Burkitt’s lymphoma BJAB-luc xenograft tumours. Anti-Her2 ADC was used as control. A 
dose-dependent anti-tumour activity of polatuzumab vedotin at doses ≥ 0.5 mg/kg was observed. No 
inhibition of tumour growth was observed in mice treated with high doses (4 mg/kg) of polatuzumab Ab 
and control ADC.

Pharmacodynamics of the surrogate ADC in Cynomolgus monkeys 
The pharmacodynamic effects of the surrogate ADC (and the surrogate Ab) were evaluated in 
Cynomolgus monkeys after single or repeated administration.  
Single dose PK/PD study of the surrogate ADC and surrogate Ab in Cynomolgus [10-0899] 
Male Cynomolgus monkeys were administered single IV bolus doses of vehicle, surrogate Ab MCDS1358A 
(3 mg/kg) or surrogate ADC DCDS5017A (0.3, 1, 3 mg/kg); samples for PK and PD assessment were 
obtained up to 43 days after treatment. 
Partial depletion of peripheral blood CD20+ B cells was observed in all animals given the surrogate Ab or 
the ADC (see Fig. 2-9). The extent of B cell depletion was comparable in these groups; however, the 
duration of the effect was slightly longer in animals given 3 mg/kg surrogate ADC compared to those 
treated at lower doses of ADC or at 3 mg/kg surrogate Ab (see Fig. below). Furthermore, in animals given 
3 mg/kg surrogate ADC, the % baseline of proliferating B cells (CD20+/Ki-67+) was lower than the % 
baseline of non-proliferating B cells (CD20+/KI-67-) on day 15. In animals given vehicle or surrogate Ab 
(3 mg/kg), the effect on proliferating and non-proliferating B cells was comparable on day 15.   
No substantial differences were observed in levels of T cells or NK cells in animals given the surrogate Ab 
or ADC compared to animals given vehicle.

Repeat-dose IV study of polatuzumab vedotin and the surrogate ADC in cynomolgus 
[10-0044] 
PD effects of polatuzumab vedotin and the surrogate ADC were studied as part of the repeated-dose IV 
toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys. Cynomolgus were administered vehicle, polatuzumab vedotin at 
1, 3 or 5 mg/kg or the surrogate ADC at 3 or 5 mg/kg (Q3W, 4 doses) and then followed in a 9-week 
treatment-free period. The effect on peripheral blood B cells was determined flow cytometry 
immunophenotyping.  
Peripheral blood B cells decreased in a dose-independent manner on day 2 after administration of the 
surrogate ADC. Following multiple IV administrations of the surrogate ADC, the maximum decrease was 
observed on Day 50 (21% baseline) at the 3 mg/kg dose and on Day 71 (16% baseline) at the 5 mg/kg 
dose. After the end of treatment, B cell numbers recovered; estimated CD20+ lymphocyte recovery to >

40% of baseline levels in all remaining study animals was approximately achieved between Days 134 and 
148 (see Fig. 2-10). As expected, treatment of Cynomolgus monkeys with the clinical candidate 
polatuzumab vedotin (non-binding ADC in Cynomolgus monkey) did not show any decrease in CD20+ 
lymphocyte numbers. Furthermore, there was no effect on T lymphocytes and NK cells in animals given 
surrogate ADC or polatuzumab vedotin as compared to vehicle.

Safety pharmacology programme 
In vitro safety pharmacology 
Effect of MMAE on cloned hERG channel current [study 07-0611] 
The effect of MMAE on hERG potassium channel activity was examined in HEK 293 cells stably transfected 
with hERG cDNA. Cells were exposed to 10 and 100 µM MMAE, positive control (60 nM terfenadine) or 
vehicle negative control. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were used to measure hERG tail current 
levels during agent application.  
The positive control (60 nM terfenadine) inhibited hERG potassium current by 84.0 ± 0.4% (mean ± SD) 
vs. 0.3 ± 0.2% in the vehicle control. MMAE inhibited hERG potassium current by 1.8 ± 0.1% at 10 μM 
and by 13.6 ± 2.6% at 100 μM. Since hERG inhibition at the highest concentration tested (100 µM) was 
only 13.6%, the IC50 for the inhibitory effect of MMAE on hERG potassium current could not be 
determined and was estimated to be > 100 µM. 
At a clinically relevant dose of 1.8 mg/kg polatuzumab vedotin, the mean Cmax of MMAE in plasma is 
approx. 7 ng/ml (10 nM) assuming no plasma protein binding. MMAE at 100 µM (approx. 10,000x greater 
than MMAE Cmax in patients) did not cause toxicologically relevant effects on the hERG channel.   
In vivo safety pharmacology  
Safety pharmacology and neurobehavioral assessments were incorporated into GLP repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys.  
Repeat-dose IV study of polatuzumab vedotin in rats [10-0898, GLP] 
Polatuzumab vedotin was administered QW to rats at IV doses of 2, 6, and 10 mg/kg for a total of 4 doses, 
followed by a 6-week recovery period.  
Respiration rates were measured as part of the cage-side and hand-held evaluations. There were no test 
article-related respiratory observations noted in animals administered polatuzumab vedotin. 
A functional observational battery, including motor activity, was performed on all animals. A slight 
increase of low arena locomotor activity was observed for males in the high-dose group and was 
attributed to the clinical decline of the animals rather than a specific neurobehavioral effect. 
Repeat-dose IV study of polatuzumab vedotin and the surrogate ADC in Cynomolgus 
[10-0044, GLP] 
In Cynomolgus monkeys, IV doses of 1, 3, and 5 mg/kg polatuzumab vedotin or 3 and 5 mg/kg of the 
surrogate ADC were administered Q3W for a total of 4 doses, followed by a 9-week recovery period.  
There were no test-article-related effects on heart rate, body temperature, ECG (including QT interval) or 
blood pressure in animals given polatuzumab vedotin or the surrogate ADC. There were no test 
article-related respiratory observations in animals administered polatuzumab vedotin or the surrogate 
ADC.

All animals in the study were subject to neurological evaluation, based on examination of behaviour, 
motor function, cranial nerves, and proprioception. No test-article-relate neurologic observations were 
noted.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
An in vitro study [15-0682] was conducted to evaluate the impact of co-treatment of polatuzumab 
vedotin with anti-CD20 antibodies (rituximab or obinutuzumab) on the activity, uptake and catabolism of 
polatuzumab vedotin in a cell line expressing both CD79b and CD20. This study is described under 
primary pharmacodynamics.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
All PK/TK studies were conducted using IV administration, since this is the intended route for 
administration of polatuzumab vedotin. The pharmacokinetics of polatuzumab vedotin was evaluated in 
mice, rats, and Cynomolgus monkeys. The PK of MMAE was characterized in Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Single dose PK of polatuzumab vedotin, polatuzumab, surrogate ADC and surrogate Ab in 
C.B-17 SCID mice [10-1571] 
The pharmacokinetics of polatuzumab vedotin, the surrogate ADC, and the respective non-conjugated Ab 
were determined in female SCID mice, the strain used in efficacy experiments. PK was assessed based on 
plasma concentrations of total antibody and acMMAE. 
Following a single 5 mg/kg IV administration of polatuzumab vedotin or the surrogate ADC, both PK 
profiles were characterized by a short distribution phase and a long elimination phase, as expected for 
monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics. The plasma CL of polatuzumab vedotin total antibody was 5.09 
mL/kg/day with a half-life of the beta phase (t1/2,β) of 11.8 days. The plasma CL of the surrogate ADC 
total antibody was 6.99 mL/kg/day with a t1/2,β of 10.5 days. The overall PK profiles of total antibody 
were similar between the two ADCs. Also, the acMMAE plasma concentration-time profiles were also 
comparable between the two ADCs. However plasma concentrations of acMMAE decreased faster than 
serum concentrations of total Ab.

Figure 9 Serum total Ab and plasma AcMMAE concentration time profiles in SCID mice 
Single dose PK/PD study of the surrogate ADC and surrogate Ab in Cynomolgus [10-0899] 
The objective of the study was to evaluate PK of the surrogate ADC and surrogate Ab when given as a 
single IV dose in Cynomolgus monkeys (relevant species). PD results of this study are discussed in the 
Primary Pharmacology section.  
Male Cynomolgus monkeys were administered single IV bolus doses of vehicle, surrogate Ab (3 mg/kg) or 
surrogate ADC (0.3, 1, 3 mg/kg); samples for PK and PD assessment were obtained up to 43 days after 
treatment. Concentrations of total antibody, acMMAE and free MMAE were determined. PK parameters 
were estimated using a two-compartment model. 
When measured as “total Ab”, Cmax was maximal immediately after administration in all treatment 
groups. Subsequently, the serum concentrations declined in a bi-exponential manner. Cmax estimates 
for total Ab were dose-proportional within the dose range (0.3 – 3 mg/kg). Exposure (AUCinf) was 
non-proportional to dose, likely due to target-mediated drug disposition. At the same dose level (3 
mg/kg), exposure (AUCinf) of the surrogate ADC was slightly lower than that of the ADC. Volume of 
distribution at steady state was comparable for the surrogate Ab and total antibody. When measured as 
“acMMAE”, plasma concentrations were high immediately following administration of the surrogate but 
decreased faster than the “total Ab” concentrations of the ADC.  
Free MMAE concentration increased with increasing doses of the surrogate ADC (1 and 3 mg/kg). Plasma 
concentration of free MMAE peaked on day 1-3 with a mean Cmax of 0.0575 ± 0.00425 ng/mL and 0.0930 
± 0.0178 ng/mL following a single IV administration of surrogate ADC at 1 and 3 mg/kg, respectively. 
Thus, free MMAE concentrations following administration of the surrogate ADC were low and could only be 
detected at limited time-points due to the assay sensitivity.

Single-dose IV toxicity study of MMAE in cynomolgus [study 07-0609, GLP] 
The objective of this study was to assess the toxicokinetics of MMAE when administered to Cynomolgus 
monkeys as a single IV injection at 0.030 or 0.063 mg/kg.  
Overall, the MMAE plasma concentration-time profiles of both dose groups exhibited apparent biphasic 
disposition with a rapid initial distribution phase was followed by a slower elimination phase. The mean 
AUClast parameter estimates were dose proportional at 0.03 and 0.063 mg/kg. No sex-related 
differences in the toxicokinetic parameters were observed.

Table 9 MMAE compartmental TK parameters estimates in cynomolgus 
Repeat-dose toxicity study of polatuzumab vedotin in rats  
In study 10-0898 after intravenous injection of polatuzumab vedotin, MMAE slowly appeared in plasma; 
Tmax was 1 day post-dose after the first and the last dose. Males generally had higher Cmax and AUC 
values than females but the differences were not greater than 2-fold. Cmax and AUC values after the last 
dose were slightly higher than after the first dose, indicating limited accumulation of MMAE after multiple 
dosing of polatuzumab vedotin in rats.  
Repeat-dose toxicity study of polatuzumab vedotin and the surrogate ADC in Cynomolgus  
In study 10-0044 the systemic exposure of total Ab was observed to increase dose-proportionally with the 
increase in polatuzumab vedotin dose from 1 to 5 mg/kg and in surrogate ADC dose from 3 to 5 mg/kg. 
No accumulation was observed after four doses of given Q3W and there were no observed sex-related 
differences in total antibody or unconjugated MMAE exposure. When comparing the two ADCs at the same 
dose levels, the systemic exposure of total antibody following IV administration of polatuzumab vedotin 
was about 1.2- to 1.4-fold higher than exposure of the surrogate ADC. Free MMAE exposure of 
polatuzumab vedotin was similar to that of the surrogate ADC in equivalent dose groups. Overall, free 
MMAE concentrations were low.

Distribution 
Tissue distribution was assessed in rats using different radio-labelled test articles: polatuzumab Ab 
(labelled with iodine-125 or Dota-indium-111), polatuzumab vedotin (labelled with 125-I or 111-In on the 
Ab moiety or labelled with 3-H on the drug moiety) and MMAE (labelled with 3-H).  
Tissue distribution of polatuzumab vedotin in rats using radiolabelled Ab moiety [14-0596] 
The objective of this study was to determine the tissue distribution of polatuzumab vedotin compared to 
that of the polatuzumab Ab in SD rats following single IV administration of using non-residualized [125I]- 
and residualized DOTA-[111In]-labelled polatuzumab vedotin and polatuzumab Ab.  
Blood and various tissues were collected at multiple intervals up to 14 days post-dose and analyzed using 
a gamma counter. The blood and tissue radioactivity data were calculated as percentage of injected dose 
(ID) normalized by blood volume (% ID/mL) or tissue weight (% ID/g). 
Radioactivity was detected in multiple highly perfused tissues, including liver, lungs, heart, kidneys, 
spleen, adrenal gland, ovaries and bone marrow, within hours post-dose in all groups. 
For [125I] probes, the radioactivity levels in tissues peaked at 2 hours post-dose and then decreased in 
parallel to the decrease of blood radioactivity over time without persistence in any tissue analysed in any 
group. The [125I] radioactivity levels in tissues were below that in the corresponding blood samples. Rats 
dosed with [111In]-polatuzumab vedotin had slightly higher uptake and longer retention of radioactivity 
in several tissues, particularly in the liver, than rats dosed with [111In]-polatuzumab Ab, either as tracer 
alone or tracer plus unlabelled materials.  
The ratio of radioactivity from the residualized [111In] to the non-residualized [125I] increased over time 
in several highly perfused tissues such as liver, kidney, spleen, adrenal gland, lymph node, and ovaries in 
all groups, suggesting that polatuzumab vedotin and the polatuzumab antibody underwent catabolism in 
these tissues. 
Tissue distribution of polatuzumab vedotin in rats using radiolabelled MMAE moiety [14-2852] 
In this study, tissue distribution of polatuzumab vedotin was investigated following a single IV dose of 10 
mg/kg (150 µCi/kg) polatuzumab vedotin-[3H]-MMAE in SD rats (15 F/group). Blood and various tissues 
were collected at multiple intervals up to 14 days post-dose. 
Radioactivity was detected in various tissues, mostly in highly perfused tissues including liver, lungs, 
heart, kidneys, spleen, adrenal gland, ovaries, and bone marrow at levels lower than that in the 
corresponding blood samples. The radioactivity level was highest at 1 hour post-dose in highly perfused

tissues, while radioactivity levels in other tissues (such as eyes, skin, and muscle) peaked at 1 day 
post-dose. Radioactivity decreased in parallel to the decrease of blood radioactivity over time and no 
persistency was observed in any tissues examined. There was little radioactivity detected in the brain and 
nerves (sciatic nerve and dorsal root ganglia) over the entire study period.  
Acetonitrile (ACN) extraction of tissue homogenates showed a time-dependent increase in the relative 
ACN-soluble fractions ranging from 6.11% - 60.5% at 1 hour post-dose to 12.3%-96.3% at 14 days 
post-dose across the different tissues. These data indicate that the ADC underwent various levels of 
catabolism in tissues. 
Distribution of MMAE 
Tissue distribution of MMAE in rats [12-2085] 
Tissue distribution of MMAE was characterised in SD rats following a single IV injection of [3H]-MMAE at 
80 µCi/kg (mixed with unlabelled MMAE resulting in 0.2 mg/kg). Various tissues were collected at multiple 
intervals and evaluated for radioactivity up to 6 days post-dose. 
Following IV administration, radioactivity levels in whole blood decreased rapidly. After 2 minutes the 
level in whole blood was only 0.272% ± 0.0667% ID/ml (0.109 ± 0.0267 µg-Eq/mL). The level further 
decreased to 0.0668% ± 0.00605% ID/mL at 10 minutes post-dose. At the same time, [3H]-MMAE 
showed a rapid distribution to various tissues. By 10 minutes post-dose, MMAE radioactivity was 
markedly detected in highly perfused tissues such as liver, lungs, and kidneys (greater than 1% ID/g), 
and to a lesser extent in other tissues. No persistency was observed over the 6 day study period in any 
tissue examined. 
Plasma protein binding of MMAE in vitro [14-0296] 
Plasma protein binding of MMAE was determined in plasma from humans, rat and Cynomolgus monkeys. 
To this end, MMAE (1 – 1000 nM) or control (5 µM) was spiked into plasma and incubated at 37°C for 4 
hrs in a rapid equilibrium dialysis device. After incubation, dialysate and plasma retentate were analysed 
by LC-MS/MS. The mean plasma protein binding of MMAE was 70.6%−76.7% in human plasma, 
87.5%−90.8% in rat, and 61.4%−69.2% in Cynomolgus plasma. Protein-binding in plasma was 
independent of the MMAE concentration.  
Red blood cell partitioning in vitro [14-0271] 
The RBC partitioning potential of MMAE was assessed in human and animal blood using [3H]-MMAE at 
concentrations ranging from 2 to 5000 nM in vitro. The ratio of the amount of radioactivity in whole blood 
to the amount in plasma (B/P ratio) was calculated. The results show that MMAE does not significantly 
partition into human RBCs at all concentrations tested in vitro (B/P ratio 1.34 to 1.65). In contrast, MMAE 
showed significant RBC partitioning in non-clinical species. B/P ratios were approximately 20 in mice, 
approximately 4 in rats, and approximately 3 in cynomolgus monkeys at concentrations of 2, 20, and 200 
nM. At higher concentrations (1000 and 5000 nM) MMAE showed less partitioning, likely due to 
saturation. Therefore, MMAE RBC partitioning is species-dependent, with strong partitioning in mice, rats, 
and Cynomolgus monkeys, but not in humans.

Catabolism of polatuzumab vedotin in vivo 
Catabolite profile of polatuzumab vedotin-[3H]-MMAE in rats [14-2852] 
The in vivo catabolism of polatuzumab vedotin was investigated following a single IV dose of 10 mg/kg 
(150 µCi/kg) polatuzumab vedotin-[3H]-MMAE in SD rats (15 F/group). Plasma, various tissues, urine, 
and bile were collected between 1 hour and 14 days post-dose. Polatuzumab vedotin and its potential

catabolites were analysed using ACN-precipitation, which separates protein-bound (ACN-precipitable) 
species from low-molecular-weight [3H]-containing species (ACN-soluble radioactivity), followed by 
liquid scintillation counting. 
Radioactivity in blood was eliminated in a biphasic manner. The majority (72.7%-98.6%) of radioactivity 
in blood was associated with the plasma and a minor amount (1.03%-27.1%) was in the cell pellet. Nearly 
all radioactivity (> 99%) in the plasma was ACN-precipitable with a small amount in the ACN-soluble 
fraction, suggesting that polatuzumab vedotin was the major species in circulation. Radioactivity 
appeared in urine and feces within the first day post-dose. The level of radioactivity in feces (mostly 
ACN-soluble form) increased rapidly over the first 2-3 days and a smaller amount was eliminated daily 
until end of the study. In contrast, only a small amount of radioactivity (mostly ACN-soluble form) was 
detected in urine over the whole study period.  
Plasma, bile (collected from bile duct-cannulated [BDC] rats in Study 14-2851), and urine samples were 
further analysed for catabolite profile and identification; the results are reported in Study 16-2563. 
Catabolite profile of polatuzumab vedotin-[3H]-MMAE in plasma, urine and bile [16-2563] 
The catabolism of polatuzumab vedotin in SD rats was further characterised. Plasma, urine and bile 
samples were analysed by radio-profile and LC mass spectrometry to characterise the catabolite profile 
and to identify the catabolites. The major catabolites of polatuzumab vedotin identified in rats (see Table 
3-17) were unconjugated MMAE (in all three matrices, representing 2.56% of dose in urine and 16.5% of 
dose in bile), O-demethylated MMAE (representing 13.5% of dose in bile), and metabolites resulting from 
amide hydrolysis and N-demethylation with hydroxylation (representing 12.2% of dose in bile).

                   Polatuzumab Vedotin-[3H]-MMAE (Study 16-2563) 
Metabolism of MMAE  
In vivo metabolic profiles and identity of MMAE metabolites were determined in plasma and bile of SD rats 
after a single IV administration of [3H]-MMAE. The amount of MMAE in this study (0.2 mg/kg) equates 
approximately the amount of MMAE delivered with a polatuzumab vedotin dose of 10 mg/kg. MMAE was 
rapidly cleared from the plasma. Radioactivity was detected in bile within hours post-dose and cumulative

radioactivity increased steadily over the first 24 hours post-dose. The radio-chromatogram of the bile 
samples using RP-HPLC analysis showed a main peak corresponding to [3H]-MMAE which accounted for a 
large part of the radioactivity detected in bile samples (62.9% of the 74.2% total dosed radioactivity 
recovered in the bile up to 6 hours post-dose). This result suggested that MMAE is the main component 
excreted into the bile while other metabolites were minor in the bile sample. 
Further analysis of the bile samples using LC-MS/MS detection showed six metabolites of MMAE 
corresponding to M1 to M6 generated in the bile, which were the same metabolites (except for M2 and M6 
only seen in vivo) identified from in vitro Study 14-0733. Therefore, MMAE does not appear to undergo 
extensive metabolism in vivo in rats. More than 60% of the dose was identified as intact MMAE in rat bile.  
The intrinsic clearance of MMAE (1 to 1000 nM) in human, rat, and monkey liver microsomes (LM) and 
hepatocytes was determined and the major human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms responsible for the 
metabolism of MMAE were identified. MMAE is not extensively metabolised in vitro, based on low to 
moderate CLhep in LM and hepatocytes from all species tested (for human LM = 10.1 -17.2 ml/min/kg, 
hepatocytes =  1.2-3.5 mL/min/kg; rat LM= 30.2-35.6 ml/min/kg, hepatocytes = 12.5-20.3 mL/min/kg, 
and Cynomolgus LM= 28.1-39.0 ml/min/kg, hepatocytes = 8.8-12.3 mL/min/kg). Reaction phenotype 
studies, using recombinant CYP enzymes or human liver microsomes in the presence of specific CYP 
inhibitors suggest that CYP3A4/5 is responsible for MMAE metabolism. 
The metabolic profile of MMAE in rats, Cynomolgus monkeys and humans was determined. To this end 
MMAE (1µM) was incubated with cryopreserved hepatocytes and liver microsomes from the different 
species. Metabolites were identified and characterised based on LC separation and MS/MS fragmentation 
patterns. Fifteen MMAE metabolites were identified and characterized in rat, monkey, and human liver 
microsomes and hepatocytes. In both test systems (hepatocytes and liver microsomes), no 
human-specific metabolites were detected. All 15 metabolites were Phase I metabolites formed as the 
result of oxidation and/or hydrolysis with several sequential metabolites.  
Excretion 
The excretion of MMAE and polatuzumab vedotin was studied in rats using radio-labelled polatuzumab 
vedotin-[3H]-MMAE or [3H]-MMAE to non-cannulated rats (for feces and urine collection) and bile 
duct-cannulated rats (for bile collection). 
Elimination route and mass balance of polatuzumab vedotin were determined following a single IV 
injection of 10 mg/kg polatuzumab vedotin-[3H]-MMAE in bile duct cannulated or non-cannulated rats. 
Excretion was followed over a period of 14 days.  
Radioactivity appeared in urine and feces within the first day post-dose. Only a small amount of 
radioactivity was detected in urine over whole study period. The level of radioactivity in feces increased 
steadily over the first 2−3 days and in smaller amounts until the end of the study. Cumulatively, about 
103%± 11.8% injected dose was eliminated in feces and 5.21%± 1.03% injected dose in urine over the 
14-day study. In bile, radioactivity was detected within 2 hours post-dose and increased steadily over the 
first 4 days (50% of injected dose). Cumulatively approx. 70% of the injected dose radioactivity was 
eliminated in bile over the 14-day study. ACN precipitation showed that the vast majority (> 95%) of 
radioactivity detected in the bile was in the soluble fraction, indicating that polatuzumab 
vedotin-[3H]-MMAE is eliminated as catabolites. 
The excretion route of MMAE was assessed following a single IV injection of [3H]-MMAE in bile duct 
cannulated or non-cannulated rats. The amount of MMAE administered (0.2 mg/kg) equates 
approximately the amount of MMAE delivered in a polatuzumab vedotin dose of 10 mg/kg. Excretion was 
followed over a period of 6 days. 
Radioactivity was detected in urine and feces within hours post-dose. Cumulatively, 98.3% ± 6.00% ID 
was detected in feces while only a small amount of dosed radioactivity was detected in urine (8.61% ±

increased steadily over the first 24 hours. Cumulatively, about 50% ID was eliminated in the bile during 
the first 3 hours, about 95% ID over the first day. By the end of the 6-day study, 103% ± 8.07% ID was 
recovered in the bile. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
CYP induction potential by MMAE in human hepatocytes [14-0732] 
CYP induction was assessed using preparations of cryopreserved human hepatocytes; both mRNA levels 
and CYP activity for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4/5 were used as markers for CYP induction. At 
concentrations up to 1 µM, MMAE did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4/5 activity. Instead, 
concentration-dependent decreases in CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 (mRNA level and functional activity) 
were observed. This was unlikely due to cytotoxicity. 
CYP inhibition by MMAE using human liver microsomes [XT085021] 
The ability of MMAE (0.1 to 100 µM) to inhibit the major CYP enzymes (i.e. CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 [using two different substrates]) was assessed in human liver 
microsomes. 
These studies showed that MMAE is a direct inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 with an IC50 value of 10 µM. MMAE is 
a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5; an increase in inhibition was observed with pre-incubation. The 
MMAE inhibition kinetics of testosterone 6β-hydroxylation had a kinact value of 0.10 min-1 and a KI value 
of 1.12 µM. MMAE formed a quasi-irreversible inhibitory complex with CYP3A4/5 as an increase in 
absorption from 380 to 520 nm was observed with a HLM sample. 
MMAE interaction with drug transporters 
Interaction of MMAE with human efflux transporter MDR1 [XT108004] 
The interactions (substrate and inhibitor) of MMAE with human efflux transporter multidrug resistance 
(MDR) 1 were tested in the vesicular transport assay and Caco-2 model. The studies showed that MMAE 
is actively transported by MDR1 in the Caco-2 monolayer, but is not an inhibitor of MDR1-mediated 
digoxin transport. 
Interaction of MMAE with human OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1,OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, BCRP, BSEP, 
MRP2 Transporters [PDM-0008, PDM-0009, PDM-0010, PDM-0011, PDM-0012, 15-3234] 
The interactions of MMAE with SLC uptake transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3) 
and ABC efflux transporters (BCRP, BSEP, MRP2) were assessed in vitro.  
Based on the results from these studies, MMAE did not appear to be a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, 
OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MRP2, and BCRP. MMAE did not inhibit (defined as inhibition < 20%) BCRP, 
BSEP, MRP2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP3B. However, at the highest applied concentration of 5 µM 
MMAE slightly inhibited OCT1 (29%) and OCT2 (23%).

For all studies: Bone marrow toxicity was characterized by contributions of decreased peripheral platelet, red and/or 
white blood cell parameters, and decreased bone marrow cellularity. Lymphoid organ toxicity was characterized by 
decreased lymphoid cellularity in the thymus and/or spleen. 
In rats: Liver toxicity was characterized by elevated peripheral liver indices and hepatocellular apoptosis, necrosis, and 
increased mitosis. Testes toxicity was characterized by seminiferous tubule degeneration and decreased 
spermatogenesis. 
4-week repeat-dose IV toxicity study of MMAE in rats [study 7646-118, GLP] 
In this dose-range finding study rats were treated once weekly for 4 weeks with vehicle, MMAE (0.0097, 
0.097, 0.194 mg/kg). Additional study arms included administration of brentuximab vedotin or 
brentuximab Ab, which are not discussed here. Animals were necropsied 4 and 29 days after the last 
dose. Morbidity and mortality, clinical signs, body weights, food consumption, ophthalmology, clinical 
pathology, TK, immunogenicity, organ weights, macroscopic and microscopic pathology were evaluated. 
MMAE was tolerated at all doses without mortality. Test article-related findings were dose-dependent, 
toxicologically important effects occurred at the high dose level (0.194 mg/kg MMAE).  
Once-weekly intravenous injection of MMAE for 4 weeks caused decreased body weights and food 
consumption. Clinical pathology findings were characterised by significantly reduced erythropoiesis 
resulting in non-regenerative anaemia and by hepatobiliary injury. These changes correlated with 
microscopic changes in bone marrow and liver. Effects on other parameters, such as leukocyte counts, 
platelet counts and serum proteins, were less severe. 
Microscopic findings were seen in bone marrow (minimal – marked hypo-cellularity) and thymus (minimal 
to marked lymphoid depletion, correlating with reduced thymus weight) and testes (irreversible 
seminiferous tubule degeneration; Sertoli cell vacuolation; reduced spermatogenesis and epididymal 
aspermia, correlating with decreased weights of epididymides and testes). In addition, a slight increase in 
the incidence of foci of coagulative necrosis was observed in the liver of males in the high-dose group. 
After the 4-week recovery period, all test article-related findings had reversed/were reversing except for 
the testicular toxicity, which was non-reversible.  
Based on these results, the no-observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of MMAE was 0.097 mg/kg/dose. 
Repeat-dose IV toxicity study of MMAE in Cynomolgus [study SNBL.163.19] 
In the repeated-dose arm of this study Cynomolgus monkeys (1/sex/group) received MMAE at 0.058 
mg/kg, Q3W x2. Animals were observed for a period of 28 after the second dose. Assessment of 
tolerability was based on mortality, clinical signs, body weight, clinical pathology and macroscopic 
pathology (for premature decedents only). There was no terminal necropsy. 
Repeat administration MMAE at 0.058 mg/kg to two Cynomolgus monkeys was well tolerated, with mild 
clinical observations and changes in clinical pathology parameters (red and white blood cell parameters, 
albumin, and AST). 
11-week repeat-dose IV study of MMAE in Cynomolgus monkeys [SNBL.163.16, GLP] 
In this study, Cynomolgus monkeys (3-8/sex/group) were treated with MMAE at 0 or 0.058 mg/kg, Q3W 
x4 (or with brentuximab vedotin, not discussed here). Animals were necropsied 1 and 5 weeks after the 
last dose. Morbidity and mortality, clinical signs, food consumption, body weights, cardiovascular 
parameters, ophthalmology, haematology, immunophenotyping, coagulation, serum chemistry, 
urinalysis, macroscopic and microscopic pathology, organ weight, TK and immunogenicity were 
evaluated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019 
Page 48/159 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No mortality was observed in MMAE-treated animals. There were no MMAE-related effects on body 
weight, blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, body temperature, ophthalmology, electro-cardiology, 
coagulation and urinalysis. Also clinical chemistry test results were relatively unaffected. 
The primary response to MMAE was moderate to marked myelotoxicity. Animals showed decreases in 
most haematopoietic cell components of the bone marrow and had leukopenia with severe neutropenia 1 
and 2 weeks post-dose. The haematological changes correlated with reduced thymus weight and 
histopathology findings of bone marrow hypo-cellularity and lymphoid depletion in thymus and spleen. In 
addition, some responses considered secondary were manifested, included mild changes in serum 
chemistry parameters. All responses were completely reversible following the 5-week recovery period.

malformations as well as soft tissue malformation were considered unrelated to treatment due to the low 
fetal and litter incidence of the findings. Maternal exposure of MMAE on GD13 was measured to be as 
follows: Cmax = 50.2 ng/ml, AUClast = 25.6 ng*day/ml. On GD 18, MMAE concentrations in maternal 
serum were below LoQ; however, MMAE was detected in amniotic fluid or foetal serum for some fetuses, 
indicating that MMAE crossed the placenta. 
No dedicated pre- and postnatal development studies have been conducted (see discussion on 
Non-Clinical aspects).   
Toxicokinetic data 
See under PK section - Absorption 
Local Tolerance  
Dedicated local tolerance studies were not conducted. Injection sites were evaluated as part of the 
repeated-dose toxicity studies with polatuzumab vedotin, the surrogate ADC and MMAE. There were no 
test-article-related findings at the injection sites. 
Other toxicity studies 
Development of ADA against polatuzumab vedotin and the surrogate ADC was evaluated as part of the 
toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkeys. ADA incidence was 67% after a single dose of the surrogate 
ADC, 20% in Cynomolgus given repeat doses of the surrogate ADC; and 43% in Cynomolgus given 
repeat-doses of polatuzumab vedotin. Importantly, ADA did not appear to impact the PK/TK of total 
antibody and unconjugated MMAE exposures. 
Specific immunotoxicity studies have not been performed (See discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
Studies on impurities have not been performed. A risk assessment addressing process-related impurities 
from the conjugation process of vcMMAE to the Ab moiety is discussed under the quality section. 
Phototoxicity 
Study TRN-2926-A evaluated the absorption spectra of MMAE and vc-MMAE. For vc-MMAE, the evaluated 
wavelength range was 290 and 700 nmM with maximal absorption at 290 nm; the molar extinction 
coefficient at 290 nm was 700 M-1cm-1 for vc-MMAE. MMAE was evaluated in a range of 190 to 900 nm, 
the wavelength of maximum absorption was 203 nm. However, MMAE did not have any measured 
absorbance at 290 nm, so the molar extinction coefficient at this wavelength is zero.  
Considering the lack of absorption of light within range of natural sunlight (290 – 700 nm) by MMAE and 
vc-MMAE, dedicated phototoxicity studies were not performed 
Tissue cross-reactivity of polatuzumab vedotin with human tissue [study 10-0711, GLP] 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the cross-reactivity of polatuzumab vedotin with a panel of human 
tissues. To this end, cryosections of human tissues were stained with polatuzumab vedotin (at 2.5 µg/ml 
or 12.5 µg/ml) or control human IgG1 (without MMAE); binding was detected using a biotinylated 
anti-MMAE secondary antibody and avidin-peroxidase and the peroxidase substrate DAB.  
Polatuzumab vedotin-specific staining was observed in multiple human tissues at both concentrations; in 
general the staining intensity was greater at the higher concentration. Polatuzumab vedotin specific 
staining consisted of cytoplasmic staining of lymphocytes, especially those in B-cell areas, in lymph 
nodes, spleen, tonsil, and the gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) in stomach, colon and 
Assessment report

gastrointestinal tract. Scattered positively staining lymphocytes were present in some sections of other 
tissues such as urinary bladder, bone marrow, breast, fallopian tube, and prostate. 
Specific, non-target staining was observed in the placenta and possibly the central nervous system. In the 
placental villus stroma, cytoplasmic staining was observed at both antibody concentrations in some 
elongated cells that may be Hofbauer cells. In the central nervous system, staining of the cytoplasmic 
processes of some glial cells was observed in the white matter of the spinal cord, cerebellum, cerebral 
cortex, and the pars nervosa of the pituitary at 12.5 μg/ml but not at 2.5 μg/ml. Staining with 
polatuzumab vedotin thought to represent non-specific background staining was present in epithelial cells 
in 1 adrenal and 1 parathyroid. Furthermore, in the bone marrow, colon, gastrointestinal tract, and lymph 
nodes, scattered inflammatory cells had cytoplasmic staining in all sections, including antibody controls.

The PEC surfacewater is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and neither polatuzumab vedotin nor vcMMAE 
nor MMAE are considered to be PBT substances as log Dow values are below 4.5. Considering the above 
data polatuzumab vedotin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical development program for polatuzumab vedotin was designed in accordance with ICH S9 
guideline, regarding the treatment of patients with advanced cancer and is considered sufficient to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019 
Page 53/159 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
support the application in the claimed indication. Evaluation of pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and 
toxicology of polatuzumab vedotin has been conducted in vitro and in vivo. Non-clinical aspects of the 
development programme were addressed in EMA scientific advices (June 2014, January 2018). The 
advice has been considered and followed as appropriate.   
The pharmacological profile of polatuzumab vedotin was demonstrated in in vitro assays and in vivo 
DLBCL model xenografted in rodents. The proof of concept was successfully demonstrated, an anti tumor 
efficacy was shown both as monotherapy or combination with rituximab and bendamustine. Results from 
both in vitro and in vivo studies support the clinical efficacy of polatuzumab vedotin treatment in CD79b 
tumors. 
The pharmacodynamics studies demonstrate anti-proliferative effects of polatuzumab as monotherapy or 
in combination with rituximab and bendamustine.  
Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of polatuzumab vedotin, surrogate ADC and 
unconjugated MMAE have been thoroughly evaluated following intravenous administration in mice, rats, 
and Cynomolgus monkeys, species used for pharmacology and toxicology studies. Studies were 
performed to characterise the distribution, metabolism and excretion of the different components of 
polatuzumab vedotin.  
Following a single 5 mg/kg IV administration of polatuzumab vedotin or the surrogate ADC in SCID mice, 
both PK profiles were characterized by a short distribution phase and a long elimination phase, as 
expected for monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics. The plasma CL of polatuzumab vedotin total 
antibody was 5.09 mL/kg/day with a half-life of the beta phase (t1/2,β) of 11.8 days. The plasma CL of 
the surrogate ADC total antibody was 6.99 mL/kg/day with a t1/2,β of 10.5 days. The overall PK profiles 
of total antibody were similar between the two ADCs. Also, the acMMAE plasma concentration-time 
profiles were also comparable between the two ADCs. The PK study in SCID mice assessed kinetics of the 
Ab-drug conjugates (polatuzumab vedotin and surrogate ADC) in comparison to their respective 
non-conjugated Abs. Overall, the pharmacokinetics of polatuzumab Ab and ADC as well as surrogate Ab 
and ADC were consistent with that of a monoclonal antibody, with low clearance, low volume of 
distribution and a long elimination half-life. When comparing polatuzumab vedotin and the surrogate 
ADC, overall PK profiles measured as total antibody and as acMMAE were comparable between the two 
ADCs. However, plasma concentrations of acMMAE decreased faster than the serum concentrations of 
total Ab, indicating some deconjugation of the ADC, even in the absence of target binding.  
Results from the PK study in cynomolgus after administration surrogate ADC and Ab are consistent with 
the findings in mice. Cmax was maximal immediately after administration in all treatment groups and was 
dose-proportional. Serum concentrations of total Ab declined bi-exponentially. Again, plasma 
concentrations of acMMAE declined faster than concentrations of total Ab, this correlated with an increase 
in free MMAE.  
Upon repeated dosing of polatuzumab vedotin in rats and of polatuzumab vedotin and surrogate ADC in 
cynomolgus monkeys, exposure of total antibody and free MMAE was dose-dependent. After 4 once 
weekly dose administrations in rats, there was limited accumulation, while there was no accumulation 
after repeated administration (Q3W, x4) in cynomolgus monkeys. In monkeys, the total antibody 
exposure of polatuzumab vedotin was 1.2-1.4-fold higher than that of the surrogate ADC. This is likely 
due to the contribution of target-mediated clearance to the clearance of the surrogate ADC.  
Upon administration of radio-labelled polatuzumab, radioactivity (irrespective of the label) was highest in 
blood and distributed slowly to tissues. In highly-perfused tissues (e.g. liver, lung, heart, kidneys, 
spleen), levels of radioactivity peaked around 1-2 hrs post dose; in other tissues at 1 day post-dose. 
Overall, tissue to blood ratio was lower in animals administered polatuzumab vedotin compared to 
animals administered free MMAE.

Plasma protein binding of MMAE in vitro was shown to be highest in rat, followed by human and 
cynomolgus plasma. Partitioning of MMAE to RBC was species-dependent, with strong partitioning in 
mice, moderate portioning in rats and cynomolgus, and low portioning in humans.  
Non-clinical studies in rats revealed that the majority of MMAE is excreted in faeces, while only minimal 
elimination occurred through renal excretion. Based on mass balance, complete elimination was achieved 
in rats. In plasma, polatuzumab vedotin was the major species, and unconjugated MMAE was the only low 
molecular weight catabolite. Catabolites in urine were unconjugated MMAE and an unknown catabolite 
C1. In rat bile, the major catabolites of polatuzumab vedotin were unconjugated MMAE, O-demethylated 
MMAE and metabolites resulting from amide hydrolysis and N-demethylation with hydroxylation. 
Essentially the same metabolites were identified in bile of rats administered free MMAE. In vitro studies 
using hepatocytes and liver microsomes from rats, cynomolgus monkeys and humans identified 15 MMAE 
metabolites, none of them being human-specific. All metabolites were derived from phase I reactions. 
CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were identified to be responsible for MMAE metabolism.  
It is not known whether polatuzumab vedotin or its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk. A risk 
for breast-feeding infants cannot be excluded. Women should discontinue breast-feeding during 
treatment with Polivy. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions were studied in vitro for different drug transporters and CYP isozymes. 
MMAE was shown to be a substrate for MDR1, but not a potent inhibitor. MMAE was not a CYP enzyme 
inducer or inhibitor, apart from CYP3A4/5. Irreversible, time-dependent CYP3A4/5 inhibition was shown. 
However, the observed inhibition constant is much greater than the mean MMAE Cmax observed in 
humans. Thus, MMAE is not expected to markedly alter the PK of medicines dependent on CYP3A4/5 
metabolism. 
The toxicological profile of polatuzumab vedotin has been evaluated during single and repeat-dose 
toxicity studies in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys using polatuzumab vedotin, surrogate ADC or 
unconjugated MMAE, genotoxicity studies, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rats and 
phototoxicity. No further non clinical studies are provided in accordance with ICH S9 guideline, which is 
endorsed.   
In both rats and Cynomolgus monkeys, the predominant systemic toxicities associated with 
administration of MMAE and polatuzumab vedotin included reversible bone marrow toxicity and 
associated peripheral blood cell effects. 
Toxicity of polatuzumab vedotin and MMAE observed in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys is consistent with 
the expected toxicity of a tubulin-binding agent, causing arrest of the cell cycle and apoptosis especially 
in rapidly dividing tissues. The main target organs are bone marrow, lymphoid organs, reproductive 
organs and liver with less severe effects on eye, skin and pancreas.  
No dedicated mutagenicity studies have been performed with polatuzumab vedotin. MMAE was not 
mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or the L5178Y mouse lymphoma forward 
mutation assay. 
MMAE was genotoxic in the rat bone marrow micronucleus study probably through an aneugenic 
mechanism.  This mechanism is consistent with the pharmacological effect of MMAE as a microtubule 
disrupting agent. 
No dedicated carcinogenicity studies have been performed with polatuzumab vedotin and/or MMAE. 
Based on its mode of action as a microtubule inhibitor targeting rapidly dividing cells, polatuzumab 
vedotin is expected to be carcinogenic. In accordance with ICH S9, omission of carcinogenicity studies is 
acceptable.

No dedicated fertility studies in animals have been performed with polatuzumab vedotin.  However, 
results of the 4-week rat toxicity study indicate the potential for polatuzumab vedotin to impair male 
reproductive function and fertility. Testicular seminiferous tubule degeneration did not reverse following 
a 6-week treatment-free period and correlated with decreased testes weight and gross findings at 
recovery necropsy of small and/or soft testes in males given ≥ 2 mg/kg. 
No dedicated teratogenicity studies in animals have been performed with polatuzumab vedotin.  
However, treatment of pregnant rats with MMAE at 0.2 mg/kg caused embryolethality and foetal 
malformations (including protruding tongue, malrotated limbs, gastroschisis, and agnathia). Systemic 
exposure (AUC) in rats at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg MMAE is approximately 50% of the AUC in patients who 
received the recommended dose of 1.8 mg/kg Polivy every 21-days. 
Treatment with polatuzumab vedotin is not compatible with pregnancy and possibly may bear a risk for 
infertility in males. Dedicated fertility studies of polatuzumab vedotin have not been performed. This is 
acceptable, in accordance with ICH S9. Furthermore, the repeat-dose toxicity study in rats indicates that 
polatuzumab vedotin may impair male reproductive function and fertility. 
In nonclinical studies, polatuzumab vedotin has resulted in testicular toxicity, and may impair male 
reproductive function and fertility (see section 5.3).  
Therefore, men being treated with this medicine are advised to have sperm samples preserved and stored 
before treatment. Men being treated with Polivy are advised not to father a child during treatment and for 
up to 6 months following the last dose. (See SmPC section 4.6 and 5.3 and RMP). 
The ADME profiles of polatuzumab vedotin is well documented but some concerns regarding metabolism 
and excretion should be clarified. The toxicological program, designed in accordance with ICH S9 
guideline, allowed to draw main target organs toxicities in rodent and non-rodent species dependent and 
independent of the antigen target.   
The embryo-fetal toxicity of MMAE was assessed in rats. Based on its mode of action (microtubule 
inhibitor) MMAE is expected to be teratogenic and embryotoxic. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see SmPC section 5.3).  
Dedicated local tolerance studies were not conducted. Injection sites were evaluated as part of the 
repeated-dose toxicity studies with polatuzumab vedotin, the surrogate ADC and MMAE. There were no 
test-article-related findings at the injection sites. 
Considering the ERA data polatuzumab vedotin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical package available with polatuzumab vedotin, in line with ICH S9 guideline and is 
considered  sufficient  to  support  the  marketing  authorization  for  the  proposed  indication.  The  safety 
information is adequately reported in the SmPC and RMP.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Polatuzumab vedotin is intended to be solely administered via the IV route, therefore no data on 
absorption are available. 
Distribution 
Distribution of acMMAE appeared to be mainly restricted to the systemic circulation, since Vss determined 
by NCA was similar to the physiological serum/plasma volume. Across the doses tested (from 0.1 to 2.4 
mg/kg), mean Vss values for acMMAE at cycle 1 ranged between 43.2 and 99.3 mL/kg. According to 
population PK analysis, the central volume V1 and the peripheral volume V2 of acMMAE were estimated to 
be 3.15 L and 3.98 L, respectively. The population estimate of central volume of distribution for acMMAE 
was 3.15 L, which approximated plasma volume. In vitro, MMAE is moderately bound (71% 77%) to 
human plasma proteins. MMAE does not significantly partition into human red blood cells in vitro; the 
blood to plasma ratio is 0.79 to 0.98. 
Population PK estimates for the apparent distribution volumes of unconjugated MMAE gave: VMMAE 
(apparent central volume) = 82.2 L and V2,MMAE = 200 L.

Elimination 
With regard to elimination, PK of acMMAE was characterized by low CL and relatively long T1/2. In the 
pivotal study GO29365, the average CL of acMMAE at cycle 1 ranged between 11.3-15.8 mL/day/kg and 
the average acMMAE terminal half-life at cycle 1 ranged between approximately 5-7 days. Population PK 
analysis using the integrated acMMAE-MMAE model 201 predicted that over the first cycle, 82.7% of the 
dose is eliminated by CLNS. Over 6 cycles, 95.2% dose is eliminated by CLNS. These results suggest the 
non-specific linear clearance (CLNS) is the major clearance pathway after 1.8 mg/kg Q3W dosing, and that 
acMMAE PK is largely linear. CLNS was estimated to be 1.01 Liter/day at time zero, 0.9 Liter/day at the end 
of Cycle 6, and 0.826 L/day at time of infinity. Over the first cycle, 15.2% of the dose is eliminated by CLt, 
which becomes negligible at later cycles. The MM clearance pathway accounts for 2% of dose eliminated 
over Cycle 1 and over all 6 cycles, suggesting a minor role on the overall elimination. The median terminal 
half-life of acMMAE at Cycle 6 was estimated to be 12.2 days. 
The average terminal half-life of unconjugated MMAE was 2.9 to 6.4 days. The delayed Tmax (2 to 3 days 
after dosing) and the long T1/2 suggest formation rate-limited kinetics of unconjugated MMAE due to ADC 
catabolism. In the population PK analysis, the apparent clearance for the linear pathway (CLMMAE) of 
unconjugated MMAE, which is a ratio of systemic clearance to the actual fraction of formation, was 
estimated to be 1.89 Liter/hour. 
Classical monoclonal antibodies are not expected to be excreted by renal or hepatic pathways. As ADC, 
after uptake and lysosomal cleavage, polatuzumab vedotin however releases its payload MMAE, which is 
then eliminated via renal and hepatic pathways. Specific clinical excretion studies have not been 
conducted.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Study DCS4968g, a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase I study, mainly contributed to the 
dose proportionality assessment of polatuzumab vedotin. In this study, polatuzumab vedotin was 
administered as a single agent by IV infusion to patients with R/R haematologic malignancies on a 21-day 
cycle (Q3W) (0.1-2.4 mg/kg) dosing schedule. 
After the first dose of polatuzumab vedotin, acMMAE, total antibody and unconjugated MMAE exposures 
(Cmax and AUCinf) increased approximately dose-proportionally over the 0.1 to 2.4 mg/kg polatuzumab 
vedotin dose range.

Mean (+ SD) Cycle 1Plasma Concentrations of acMMAE, TAb and unconjugated MMAE in 
NHL Patients - Dose Escalation Cohorts 
Dose-proportionality was also suggested by the power coefficient of a power model of regression of Cycle 
1 PK parameters by NCA (Cmax, AUCinf) versus Cycle 1 dose in patients with NHL. The power coefficient 
(95% CI) is 0.93 (0.86-0.99), 0.92 (0.85-0.99), and 0.80 (0.63-0.97) for Cmax of acMMAE, total antibody, 
and unconjugated MMAE, 1.07 (0.98-1.2), 1.12 (0.97-1.3), and 0.87 (0.74-1.0) for AUCinf of acMMAE, 
total antibody, and unconjugated MMAE. The 95% CI for these power coefficients were close to or 
including the value of 1. 
Based on the same analysis, the correlation coefficient (R2) of exposures with Cycle 1 dose suggested that 
the exposure of acMMAE and total antibody exposures (Cycle 1 Cmax and AUCinf) have an overall stronger 
correlation with dose compared to the correlation of unconjugated MMAE with dose, which is weaker. 
Across 0.1 to 2.4 mg/kg doses, the R2 with dose for Cmax and AUCinf is 0.932 and 0.897 for acMMAE, 0.913 
and 0.782 for total antibody, and 0.585 and 0.744 for unconjugated MMAE respectively. This is consistent 
with unconjugated MMAE as a catabolite of the conjugate.

Study DCS4968g: Dose Proportionality Assessment in Patients with NHL Receiving 0.1-2.4 
mg/kg of Polatuzumab Vedotin 
In studies GO27834 and GO29044, dose proportional increases in exposure of acMMAE and unconjugated 
MMAE from 1.0 to 2.4 mg/kg were confirmed.  
After the first 1.8 mg/kg polatuzumab vedotin dose, the acMMAE mean maximum concentration (Cmax) 
was 803 (± 233) ng/mL and the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity 
(AUCinf) was 1860 (±966) day•ng/mL. Based on the population PK analysis, Cycle 3 acMMAE AUC 
increased by approximately 30% over Cycle 1 AUC, and achieved more than 90% of the Cycle 6 AUC.  The 
terminal half-life at Cycle 6 was approximately 12 days (95% CI of 8.1-19.5 days) for acMMAE. Based on 
population PK analysis, the predicted acMMAE concentration at the end of cycle 6 is approximately 80% 
of the theoretical steady-state value.   
Exposures of unconjugated MMAE, the cytotoxic component of polatuzumab vedotin, increased dose 
proportionally over the 0.1 to 2.4 mg/kg polatuzumab vedotin dose range.  MMAE plasma concentrations 
followed formation rate limited kinetics.  After the first 1.8 mg/kg polatuzumab vedotin dose, the Cmax 
was 6.82 (± 4.73) ng/mL, the time to maximum plasma concentration is approximately 2.5 days, and the 
terminal half-life is approximately 4 days.  Plasma exposures of unconjugated MMAE are < 3% of acMMAE

exposures.  Based on the population PK analysis there is a decrease of plasma unconjugated MMAE 
exposure (AUC) after repeated every-three-week dosing.  
For unconjugated MMAE, similar findings of approximately dose-proportional behaviour were detected. 
Time dependency 
Mild increases of plasma acMMAE and serum total antibody pre-dose concentrations were observed with 
repeated Q3W dose. The average Cycle 4 day 1 pre-dose concentration was approximately 1.5 fold of the 
average concentration at Cycle 2 day 1 pre-dose for acMMAE and 2.4 fold for total antibody. No apparent 
increase of plasma trough concentrations of unconjugated MMAE after repeated Q3W dosing was 
identified.  
In study GO29365, the average trough concentrations of acMMAE for DLBCL patients receiving Pola+BR 
or Pola+BG Q3W ranged between 13.6-17.0 ng/mL (Cycle 2 pre-dose) and increased to 20.4-26.7 ng/mL 
(Cycle 4 pre-dose).  
Similar results with respect to time dependency were obtained through population PK analysis: The 
acMMAE AUC and Ctrough increased with repeated Q3W dosing, potentially due to the decrease of acMMAE 
clearance with time after repeated dosing. The acMMAE Cycle 3 AUC and Ctrough (i.e., Cycle 4 day 1 
pre-dose) were approximately 1.3 and 1.8 fold of Cycle 1 AUC and Ctrough (i.e., Cycle 2 day 1 pre-dose); 
the Cycle 6 values were approximately 1.4 and 2.2 fold of Cycle 1. There was no apparent increase in Cmax 
values. In contrast, population PK analysis revealed a decrease of unconjugated MMAE AUC and Cmax over 
repeated dosing, which was explained by a potential decrease of acMMAE clearance and decrease of 
fraction of formation of unconjugated MMAE from acMMAE with time. 
Inter-individual variability 
Inter-individual variability of PK parameters was relatively low and could be further reduced by 
accounting for all statistically significant covariates in the final integrated acMMAE-MMAE model (IIV of 
acMMAE CLINF = 19.5% and V1 = 12.2%). Higher variability was seen for unconjugated MMAE, which is 
plausible due to the fact that MMAE is a catabolite of acMMAE with significant variability in its formation 
and elimination. 
PK in target population 
Noncompartmental analyses 
For the proposed Q3W dosing regimen of 1.8 mg/kg polatuzumab vedotin, similar exposure (Cmax and 
AUC) of acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE was observed throughout the clinical studies DCS4968g, 
GO27834, GO29365 and GO29044. In cycle 1 of the pivotal study GO29635, Cmax and AUCinf of acMMAE 
were determined to be 622-738 ng/mL and 2180 – 2850 ng*day/mL, respectively. After repeated 
administration, Cmax of acMMAE was similar to Cmax seen following the first dose, average post-infusion 
concentrations of acMMAE were 694 – 841 ng/mL on Cycle 2 Day 1, and 671 – 820 ng/mL on Cycle 4 Day 
1.

Study GO29365: Summary of Cycle 1 PK Parameters of Polatuzumab Vedotin Analytes in 
Patients with DLBCL or FL (from Safety Run-in Cohorts) 
Throughout the pivotal and supportive clinical studies, Tmax of unconjugated MMAE was determined to be 
3 – 6 days. Cmax of unconjugated MMAE after the first polatuzumab vedotin dosing at 1.8 mg/kg was 
significantly lower as compared to acMMAE (< 1 – 2%) and ranged between 2 – 6.8 ng/mL. 
Population PK analysis 
The PK exposures (assuming 1.8 mg/kg Q3W) based on individual empirical Bayes estimates (EBE) of PK 
parameters were simulated and summarized by mean (SD) for 460 patients.  
The Cycle 3 acMMAE exposures reached the majority (>80%) of the Cycle 6 exposures, and the Cycle 6 
exposures (the theoretically maximum acMMAE exposures for the proposed dosing regimen of up to 6 
cycles) reached the majority (>80%) of the steady state exposures. The Cycle 3 acMMAE AUC, Cmax and 
Ctrough (i.e., Cycle 4 day 1 pre-dose) values are 91%, 99%, and 81% of Cycle 6 AUC, Cmax, and Ctrough (i.e., 
Cycle 6 day 21) values. The Cycle 6 acMMAE AUC, Cmax, and Ctrough values are 90%, 99%, and 80% of the 
model predicted steady-state AUC, Cmax, and Ctrough values (represented by the simulated value for the 
exposure during hypothetical Cycle 30 after repeated Q3W dosing, at which time the CLNS approximated 
the value of time of infinity [CLINF]). 
For unconjugated MMAE, AUC and Cmax values were the highest in Cycle 1 after which they were estimated 
to decline to 72% and 60% of the values of Cycle 1 at Cycle 3, and 69% and 56% of the values of Cycle 
1 at Cycle.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Impact of rituximab on the PK of polatuzumab vedotin-related analytes 
A population PK analysis approach was used to assess the impact of rituximab combination on acMMAE 
and unconjugated MMAE PK. Rituximab combination is a statistically significant covariate for acMMAE 
CLINF and kdes (rate constant of decay of CLT with time), and for FRAC of unconjugated MMAE.  
Simulation of Cycle 6 exposures (AUC, Cmax of Cycle 6 by 1.8 mg/kg q3w) comparing the PK exposures for 
patients who received single-agent of polatuzumab vedotin (N=68) and for patients who received pola in 
combination with rituximab were performed (N=229). The acMMAE exposures (AUC and Cmax) in patients 
received R combination were moderately higher (24% for AUC) than patients received single-agent, while 
unconjugated MMAE exposures are moderately lower (37% for AUC and 40% for Cmax).

Impact of polatuzumab vedotin on the PK of rituximab 
The observed concentrations at Cycle 1 30 minutes post-infusion, Cycle 2 pre-dose and Cycle 4 pre-dose 
were summarized for each study and compared.  The observed exposures of rituximab are largely similar 
across these polatuzumab vedotin clinical studies in different histologies and in treatment naïve or R/R 
patients (maximum difference across arms less than 25%). For the DLBCL or FL patients in the 
randomized Phase II portion of the pivotal study GO29365, the rituximab exposures in the BR arm were 
similar to the pola+BR arm (less than 10% differences across time points). This suggested a low risk for 
polatuzumab vedotin to impact the PK of rituximab when given in combination. 
Table 19: Comparison of Rituximab Exposure across Single- and Multiple-cycles when 
Administered at 375 mg/m2 in Combination with other Study Treatments 
In addition, the rituximab PK in these studies were pooled and analyzed by a population PK approach. A 
historical rituximab population PK model based on rituximab in combination with cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) or cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone (CVP) in 
previously untreated FL patients in the historical study BO22334/SABRINA was used as a starting model. 
The model was refined to describe the rituximab PK data in the four polatuzumab vedotin studies 
(DCS4968g, GO27834, GO29044 and GO29365) with or without co-administration of polatuzumab 
vedotin. The final refined model adequately described rituximab PK in these patients.  
Based on the covariate assessment, the polatuzumab vedotin combination was not a statistically 
significant covariate of rituximab PK parameters. Furthermore, the rituximab Cycle 8 exposures (AUC, 
Cmax) computed based on individual EBE parameters were similar with or without the combination of 
polatuzumab vedotin, as indicated by difference of less than 10%. These results again supported a low 
risk of polatuzumab vedotin impacting rituximab PK when given in combination in this R/R DLBCL patient 
population.

dosing as a perpetrator or a victim with coadministered drugs that are CYP substrates, inhibitors or 
inducers (PBPK report 1090612 and Chen et al. 2015). No dedicated clinical DDI studies with inducers or

Exposure relevant for safety 
For evaluation of safety, the following exposure of unconjugated MMAE at the proposed dosing regimen of 
1.8  mg/kg  polatuzumab  vedotin  should  be  considered:  Cmax  ranged  between  2  –  6.8  ng/mL  (Cmax 
(predicted by population PK analysis) = 2.27 – 4.08 ng/mL and Cmaxx (NCA analysis) = 2 – 6.8 ng/mL). 
AUC was predicted by population PK analysis and ranged from 25.1 to 36.5 ng*day/mL. After the first 
administration of polatuzumab vedotin, AUCinf was calculated to 52.3 ng*day/mL. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Polatuzumab vedotin is an ADC that contains a humanized IgG1 anti-CD79b monoclonal antibody 
(MCDS4409A) and a potent anti-mitotic agent (MMAE) linked through a protease-labile linker 
(mc-vc-PAB). Upon binding CD79b, polatuzumab vedotin is rapidly internalized and the conjugate MMAE 
is released by cleavage by lysosomal enzymes. MMAE then binds to tubulin and disrupts the microtubule 
network, resulting in inhibition of cell division and cell growth and induction of apoptosis.  
Throughout the clinical studies, no specific pharmacodynamic endpoints were investigated. 
Immunogenicity 
The potential for polatuzumab vedotin to induce an undesirable immune response was assessed in the 
available data from Study GO29365 and 6 supportive studies (DCS4968g, GO27834, GO29044, 
GO29833, GO29834, and BO29561). Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were assessed at pre-infusion of Cycles 
1, 2, and 4, at treatment completion/early termination, and at follow-up (3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months) visits. 
GO29365 Immunogenicity Results 
In study GO29365, ADAs were detected post-baseline in 8 of 134 (6.0%) ADA evaluable patients treated 
with polatuzumab vedotin. All 8 patients had treatment-induced ADA (i.e. ADA negative at baseline or 
missing a baseline sample for ADA analysis and at least one positive post-baseline ADA result). Out of the 
8 patients with treatment-induced ADA, 6 patients had a transient response and 2 patients had persistent 
responses. Titers ranged from <1.7 (the minimum reportable titer) to 2.71.

In this study, a total of 8 patients (4 DLBCL, 4 FL) developed ADAs. ADA positive status did not appear to 
impact efficacy: Of the 4 DLBCL patients, one a pola+BR patient (2101) developed ADAs during Cycle 2 
and was assessed with progressive disease during the Cycle 3 Day 15 (C3D15) interim assessment. The 
other two pola+BR patients responded to treatment (2102, 4018). The final DLBCL patient (6012, 
pola+BG) had ADAs detected during Cycle 2, completed 6 cycles, and has an ongoing DOR of 21.1 
months. Of the four FL patients who developed ADAs against polatuzumab vedotin, one pola+BR patient 
(3053) had ADAs detected during Cycle 2, had a partial response at C3D15 interim assessment, and 
progressive disease at PRA. The other 3 patients had ADAs detected at later timepoints and after 
completing 6 cycles. All three of these patients (3043, 5020, 3080) have ongoing responses at time of 
analysis. 
GO29365 and Supportive Studies Immunogenicity Results 
For all patients treated with polatuzumab vedotin, the baseline prevalence of ADAs was 2.4% (13 of 545 
ADA evaluable patients). Post baseline, ADAs were detected in 14 of 536 (2.6%) ADA evaluable patients 
treated with polatuzumab vedotin. Out of the 14 patients positive for ADA, 13 patients had 
treatment-induced ADA and 1 was treatment-enhanced. Out of the 13 patients with treatment-induced 
ADA, 8 patients had a transient response and 5 patients had persistent responses. Out of the 13 patients 
who tested positive for ADA at baseline, 12 were treatment unaffected.  
Impact of ADA on PK by Population PK Analysis 
Population PK analysis was performed to assess the impact of ADA on the PK of acMMAE and 
unconjugated MMAE. Only 12 (2.6%) of 460 patients of the analysis dataset were ADA positive.   
Based on the final model, simulation of Cycle 6 exposures (AUC, Cmax of Cycle 6 by 1.8 mg/kg q3w) 
revealed that for the PK of ADA positive patients (N=12), the acMMAE exposures are similar to the ADA 
negative patients (<10% difference). The unconjugated MMAE exposures are moderately higher in ADA 
positive patients (10% for AUC, 24% for Cmax), but the difference is not statistically significant as 
indicated by the GMRs of including 1. The magnitude of difference is much smaller compared to CV% of 
unconjugated MMAE of 44-58%.

Exposure-response analysis 
Exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety analysis was performed. Only the R/R DLBCL patients were 
included for this analysis. Two separate analyses were performed. The first analysis was based on the 
pooled data of supportive studies DCS4968g and GO27834. The second analysis was based on the pivotal 
study GO29365 alone. 
Table 25: Studies, Patients, PK Exposure Parameters and Dosing Regimens included in the 
Exposure-Response Analyses in R/R DLBCL Patients 
The exposures of acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE based on the integrated population PK model were 
used for the exposure-response analysis. The acMMAE exposures are highly correlated with the dose of

polatuzumab vedotin. It is considered the key analyte of interest driving efficacy and safety based on the 
MOA of the molecule. Unconjugated MMAE is a catabolite of the conjugate. Unconjugated MMAE 
exposures increase proportionally with dose and have a weaker correlation with dose. Unconjugated 
MMAE is not considered a major driver of efficacy based on the design of the molecule, but might be 
associated with some adverse events given its high potency. For exposure-safety analysis, the correlation 
of acMMAE or unconjugated MMAE exposures (AUC, Cmax) with the incidence of clinically relevant adverse 
events and dose intensity related measurements were explored  for the pivotal study and the supportive 
studies. For exposure-efficacy analysis, the correlation of acMMAE exposures (AUC) with key efficacy 
endpoints for the pivotal study and the supportive studies were performed. 
Exposure-Safety Analysis 
Analysis was not performed for AEs with incidence less than 5% or with number of events less than 5 due 
to limited data. For all other safety endpoints, the statistical significance as indicated by p-value based on 
the supportive studies (DCS4968g and GO27834) and the pivotal study (GO29365) were summarized.  
Table 26: Summary of the Results for Exposure-Safety Analysis 
Grade ≥ 3 Neutropenia 
Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia was the most common adverse event. Approximately 33% of patients in the 
supportive studies and 51% of patients in the pivotal study experienced treatment-emergent Grade ≥3 
neutropenia.  
The logistic regression analyses indicate that there were no statistically significant correlations (p > 0.05) 
between exposures (AUC and Cmax) of acMMAE or unconjugated MMAE and probability of Grade ≥ 3 
neutropenia for both the supportive studies and the pivotal study. The higher incidence of Grade ≥ 3 
Neutropenia in the pivotal study was experienced by 26.1% at 1.8 mg/kg and from supportive studies; 
50.7% at 1.8 mg/kg from pivotal studies). 
Grade ≥ 2 Peripheral Neuropathy 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019 
Page 69/159 
  
  
 
 
 
The incidence of Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy was 25.2% in the supportive studies based on data 
from 0.1-2.4 mg/kg and treatment duration of up to 8 cycles. The analyses based on supportive studies 
indicated that probability of Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy increased (p < 0.05) with increasing 
acMMAE exposures (AUC and Cmax) but had no statistically significant correlation with unconjugated 
MMAE exposures. 
In the pivotal Study GO29365 with polatuzumab vedotin given at 1.8 mg/kg up to 6 cycles, the frequency 
of Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy was 14.5%. The pivotal analysis did not identify statistically 
significant correlations between acMMAE or unconjugated MMAE exposures with the probability of Grade 
≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy. 
Figure 11 Logistic Regression for acMMAE Exposures and Grade ≥ 2 Peripheral Neuropathy 
Based on the Supportive Studies 
In addition, a time to event analysis (Lu et al. 2017) based on DCS4968g and GO27834 studies suggested 
that the incidence of Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy increased with increasing acMMAE exposures (i.e., 
dose of polatuzumab vedotin) and treatment duration, and a treatment duration of 6-8 cycles is desirable 
for mitigating the risk of Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy. 
Grade ≥ 3 Infections and Infestations 
The incidences of treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 Infections and Infestations were 10.1% in the 
supportive studies and 29% in the pivotal study. The analysis based on the supportive studies and the 
pivotal study did not identify statistically significant correlations between acMMAE or unconjugated MMAE 
exposures with the probability of Grade ≥ 3 Infections and Infestations. 
Grade ≥ 3 Anemia 
The incidence of treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 anemia was 7.6% in the supportive studies and 18.8% 
in the pivotal study. The analysis based on the supportive studies indicated that probability of 
treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 anemia increased significantly (p < 0.05) with increasing unconjugated

MMAE exposures (AUC and Cmax), but had no statistically significant correlation with acMMAE exposures.  
The analysis based on the pivotal study did not identify any statistically significant correlations with both 
acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE exposures, potentially due to a relatively narrow exposure range from 
a single dose level of 1.8 mg/kg. The higher incidence of Grade ≥ 3 Anemia in the pivotal study (6.5% at 
1.8 mg/kg from supportive studies; 18.8% at 1.8 mg/kg from pivotal studies) was probably due to the 
bendamustine combination, which as a chemotherapy agent is associated with haematologic adverse 
events.

on the Supportive Studies 
Grade ≥ 3 Thrombocytopenia 
The incidence of treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia was 5% in the supportive studies and 
34.8% in the pivotal study. There were no statistically significant correlations between acMMAE or 
unconjugated MMAE exposures and the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia in both the supportive 
studies and the pivotal study. The higher incidence of Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia in the pivotal study 
was probably due to the bendamustine combination, which as a chemotherapy agent is associated with 
haematologic adverse events. 
Probability of Dose Modification due to AE and Time to First Dose Modification due to AE for Polatuzumab 
Vedodin 
Frequency of dose modification (including dose delay, dose reduction and early discontinuation) due to AE 
was 26.9% in the supportive analysis and 58% in the pivotal analysis. For the analysis based on the 
supportive studies and the pivotal study, the logistic regression models indicated that there were no 
statistically significant correlations between exposures (AUC and Cmax) of acMMAE or unconjugated MMAE 
and probability of dose modification due to AE. 
The analysis (cox proportional hazard model) based on the supportive studies indicated that time to the 
first dose modification due to AE decreased significantly (p < 0.05) (i.e., earlier time to first dose 
modification) with increasing unconjugated MMAE exposures (AUC, Cmax). The analysis (cox proportional

hazard model) based on the pivotal study indicated that time to the first dose modification due to AE 
decreased significantly (p < 0.05) with the increase of  acMMAE Cmax  However, the probability of dose 
modification due to AE was not significantly impacted by acMMAE or unconjugated MMAE. 
Exposure-Efficacy Analysis 
For the investigated efficacy endpoints, the statistical significance as indicated by p-value for the analysis 
based on supportive studies (DCS4968g and GO27834) and the pivotal study (GO29365) are summarized 
below.  
Table 27: Summary of the results for exposure-efficacy analysis 
Analysis based on the supportive studies 
A total of 31 (40.8%) out of 76 patients were responders (complete response or partial response) based 
on investigator assessed best overall response (INV-BOR) by treatment up to 8-cycle landmark, and a 
total of 23 (30.3%) out of 76 patients were responders (complete response or partial response) based on 
investigator assessed objective response (INV-OR) at the end of Cycle 8 landmark or earlier if less than 
8 cycles. The logistic regression analysis indicated a statistically significant correlation between acMMAE 
AUC and the probability of INV-BOR and INV-OR. A higher acMMAE AUC is associated with a higher 
probability of response (p=0.037 and 0.014, respectively, by logistic regression). 
Analysis based on the pivotal study: Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessed CR at Primary 
Response Assessment (PRA) Time (IRC-CR), OR at PRA time (IRC-OR), and BOR by treatment up to 6 
cycles (IRC-BOR) 
Out of 44 patients, 19 (43.2%) patients achieved CR at PRA time by IRC assessment; 21 (47.7%) patients 
achieved objective response (OR, i.e., complete response or partial response) at PRA time by IRC 
assessment; and 26 (59.1%) patients were responders based on IRC-BOR data for treatment up to 6 
cycles. There are no statistically significant correlations between acMMAE AUC and these endpoints by 
logistic regression within the exposure range in the pivotal study. 
Analysis based on the pivotal study: IRC assessed duration of response (i.e., time to relapsed, IRC-DOR) 
for patients with response, PFS by IRC (IRC-PFS) and OS

Of 26 (out of 44) patients who achieved complete or partial response, 11 (42.3%) patients relapsed 
within the assessment duration and others were censored. Of 44 patients with available PFS and OS data, 
26 (59.1%) and 24 (54.5%) had the respective events and others were censored.

Cardiac electrophysiology (ECG) 
The effect of polatuzumab vedotin on the corrected QT (QTc) interval was evaluated based on triplicate 
ECG data from 2 clinical studies (DCS4968g and GO27834).  
Based on the overall results from in vitro and preclinical assessments, the risk of polatuzumab vedotin on 
QT prolongation at therapeutic doses is low. To assess the QT prolongation risk of polatuzumab vedotin in 
patients, concentration-QT analysis was conducted based on the observed PK data and triplicate ECG data 
from the pooled dataset of DCS4968g and GO27834 studies. The QT data by Fridericia’s correction (QTcF) 
(FDA and EMA) and the change of QTcF from the baseline (ΔQTcF) were derived at each visit. 
Theoretically, based on molecule size and properties, only unconjugated MMAE would be expected to be 
capable of entering cardiac cells and binding to the intracellular part of the rapidly activating delayed 
rectifier potassium channel (IKr). Regardless, all three analytes were assessed for this modeling.  
First, categorical analyses of observed QTcF and ΔQTcF values were conducted. Selected QTc categories 
were > 500 ms, > 480 to ≤ 500 ms, and ≤ 450 ms. Selected ΔQTcF categories were > 60 ms, > 30 to ≤ 
60 ms, and ≤ 30 ms. Second, concentration-ΔQTcF modeling was performed for each analyte separately, 
by linear mixed-effect modeling. In both analyses, a threshold of 20 ms was selected as ICH E14 guidance 
asserts that any drug causing mean ΔQTcF prolongation > 20 ms has a substantially increased likelihood 
of causing clinical arrhythmic events (FDA and EMA, Garnett et al. 2018).  
At average Cmax of each analyte at 1.8 mg/kg q3w dose level, the upper bound of two-sided 90% CI of 
model predicted ΔQTcF were all below 10ms for each analyte. ΔQTcF was estimated to be 3.64 ms [1.83, 
5.45] at a Cycle 3 Cmax of 859 ng/mL for acMMAE, 4.05 ms [2.22, 5.88] at a Cycle 3 Cmax of 46.3 μg/mL 
for total antibody, and 1.95 ms [-2.21, 6.10] at a Cycle 1 Cmax of 6.82 ng/mL for unconjugated MMAE.

Special populations 
The PK of acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE were evaluated in special populations including the elderly (≥ 
65 years old), race (Asian versus non-Asian), region (Asia region versus non-Asia region), and patients 
with hepatic or renal function impairment, by using the population PK approach. Formal covariate analysis 
was performed during the model building when appropriate. A simulation of Cycle 6 acMMAE and 
unconjugated MMAE exposures (AUC and Cmax) was performed to compare the exposures in the different 
groups. 
Impaired renal function 
Based on the population PK analysis, CrCL is not identified as a statistically significant covariate of 
acMMAE or unconjugated MMAE PK parameters. Patients with mild renal impairment (N=161) and 
moderate renal impairment (N=109) have similar acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE exposures as normal 
patients (N=185) (<10% difference of AUC and Cmax). 
Based on the similar PK exposures for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CrCL of 30-90 
mL/min) to the normal patients (CrCL >90 mL/min), and the safety analysis which suggested a similar 
safety profile for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment to patients with normal renal functions, 
no starting dose adjustment is recommended. No conclusion can be drawn for patients with severe renal 
impairment (N=3) and end-stage renal disease (N=0) due to limited data.

function, mild or moderate renal impairment

Impaired hepatic function 
Based on the final population PK model, hepatic impairment status based on NCI clasification was 
identified as a statistically significant covariate for unconjugated MMAE PK parameter (FRACNS), but it is 
not a covariate for acMMAE PK.  
Simulation of Cycle 6 individual exposures (AUC, Cmax of Cycle 6 by 1.8 mg/kg q3w) based on individual 
EBE of PK parameters using pCC procedure was performed. The PK in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (N=54) versus patients with normal hepatic impairment (N=399) suggested that acMMAE 
exposures are similar (<5% difference), while unconjugated MMAE exposures are moderately higher in 
patients with mild hepatic impairment (40% for AUC, 34% for Cmax). This magnitude of higher 
unconjugated MMAE exposures is not expected to have a clinically relevant impact on safety based on the 
exposure-safety results.  
Thus, no starting dose adjustment is warranted for patients with AST or ALT of >1-2.5 ULN or total 
bilirubin of >1-1.5 ULN. No conclusions can be drawn for patients with moderate hepatic impairment 
(total bilirubin >1.5-3 ULN, and enzyme elevation is not due to Gilbert’s syndrome or underlying disease) 
(N=2) or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 ULN and enzyme elevation is not due to Gilbert’s 
syndrome or underlying disease) (N=0) due to limited data.

Simulation of Cycle 6 exposures (AUC, Cmax of Cycle 6 by 1.8 mg/kg Q3W) demonstrated that the

and unconjugated MMAE compared to female (N=188). 
Comparison of Covariate-Corrected Exposures by Sex 
Race and Region 
Patients were grouped to Asian (N=18) and Non-Asian (N=422). Race was identified as a statistically 
significant covariate for acMMAE V1.  
Simulation of Cycle 6 exposures (AUC, Cmax of Cycle 6 by 1.8 mg/kg q3w) suggested nearly identical 
exposures of acMMAE (<1.2% differences) comparing the PK results of Asian (N=18) and Non-Asian 
(N=422) patients. For unconjugated MMAE, the exposure is mildly lower in Asian patients (18.6% for 
AUC, 16.9% for Cmax).

Similar results were found in the analysis of the impact of region (Asia region vs Non-Asia region).  
Body Weight 
Whether dose capping is needed for relatively heavy patients (defined as body weight ≥ 100 kg in this 
analysis) was assessed by simulating the Cycle 6 exposures (AUC, Cmax) of the 1.8 mg/kg Q3W regimen 
for patients with body weight≥ 100 kg (N=59) compared to the others (< 100 kg, N=401). For patients 
with body weight ≥ 100 kg, acMMAE exposures are slightly higher than others (8% for AUC, 17% for

Elderly 
Age (< 65 years old versus ≥ 65 years old) was not a statistically significant covariate of acMMAE or

Simulation of Cycle 6 exposures (AUC, Cmax of Cycle 6 by 1.8 mg/kg q3w for 6 cycles) indicated similar 
exposures for both acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE (<10% differences of AUC and Cmax) in patients with

No studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of polatuzumab vedotin in the 
paediatric population (<18 years old). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A total of 7 clinical studies contributed to the characterization of the clinical pharmacology of polatuzumab 
vedotin: Studies DCS4968g, GO29365, GO27834, GO29044 (conducted with the v0.1-derived liquid DP, 
arm G in study GO29365 with v1.0 lyophylized 140 mg/vial DP), and studies GO29833, GO29834, 
BO29561 (conducted with v1.0-derived lyophilized DP). In all studies, polatuzumab vedotin was 
administered by intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 to 90 minutes. Studies were intended to characterize 
single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of the three major analytes of polatuzumab vedotin: 
conjugate (evaluated as antibody-conjugated MMAE [acMMAE]), total antibody, and unconjugated MMAE. 
PK characteristics of acMMAE, total antibody and unconjugated MMAE were analysed by 
noncompartmental analysis (NCA). In addition, a two-analyte (acMMAE-MMAE) integrated population 
pharmacokinetic analysis was used to further characterize the PK properties of acMMAE and unconjugated 
MMAE. The final proposed dosing regimen of polatuzumab vedotin in patients with R/R DLBCL is 1.8 
mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W) for up to 6 cycles, in combination with rituximab and bendamustine. 
Comparability of the v1.0-derived material to the v0.1-derived material of polatuzumab vedotin was 
demonstrated by population PK analysis. Clinically relevant differences in PK are not anticipated, 
considering that the 90% CI of the GMR of AUC and Cmax of acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE comparing 
the v1.0-derived lyophilized DP with the v0.1-derived liquid DP were contained within the bioequivalence 
margin of 0.8 – 1.25. These results support the comparability of both the liquid and the lyo formulations. 
Polivy is administered as an IV infusion. There have been no studies performed with other routes of 
administration. 
Volume of distribution of MMAE could solely be estimated by population PK analyses as apparent values, 
since MMAE follows formation-rate limited kinetics. The population estimate of central volume of 
distribution for acMMAE was 3.15 L, which approximated plasma volume.  In vitro, MMAE is moderately 
bound (71%-77%) to human plasma proteins. MMAE does not significantly partition into human red blood 
cells in vitro; the blood to plasma ratio is 0.79 to 0.98. Clearance of acMMAE declined with multiple dosing 
and was estimated to 1.01 L/day at time zero and 0.825 L/day at time of infinity.   
In vitro data indicate that MMAE is a P-gp substrate but does not inhibit P-gp at clinically relevant 
concentrations.  
MMAE has previously been shown to be predominantly excreted via the hepatic pathway. No clinical 
excretion studies with polatuzumab vedotin have been conducted. Polatuzumab vedotin is expected to 
undergo catabolism in patients, resulting in the production of small peptides, amino acids, unconjugated 
MMAE, and unconjugated MMAE related catabolites. The levels of MMAE metabolites have not been 
measured in human plasma. 
In vitro studies indicate that MMAE is a substrate for CYP3A4/5 but does not induce major CYP enzymes. 
MMAE is a weak time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 but does not competitively inhibit CYP3A4/5 at 
clinically relevant concentrations.  
MMAE does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6. 
Based on a population PK analysis, the conjugate (acMMAE) is primarily eliminated by non-specific linear 
clearance pathway with a value of 0.9 L/day. In vivo studies in rats dosed with polatuzumab vedotin 
(radiolabel on MMAE) demonstrate that the majority of radioactivity is excreted in faeces and the minority 
of radioactivity is excreted in urine.

Antibody-conjugated MMAE (acMMAE) plasma exposure increased dose-proportionally over the 0.1 to 
2.4 mg/kg polatuzumab vedotin dose range.  After the first 1.8 mg/kg polatuzumab vedotin dose, the 
acMMAE mean maximum concentration (Cmax) was 803 (± 233) ng/mL and the area under the 
concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUCinf) was 1860 (±966) day•ng/mL. Based on the 
population PK analysis, Cycle 3 acMMAE AUC increased by approximately 30% over Cycle 1 AUC, and 
achieved more than 90% of the Cycle 6 AUC.  The terminal half-life at Cycle 6 was approximately 12 days 
(95% CI of 8.1-19.5 days) for acMMAE. Based on population PK analysis, the predicted acMMAE 
concentration at the end of cycle 6 is approximately 80% of the theoretical steady-state value.   
Exposures of unconjugated MMAE, the cytotoxic component of polatuzumab vedotin, increased dose 
proportionally over the 0.1 to 2.4 mg/kg polatuzumab vedotin dose range.  MMAE plasma concentrations 
followed formation rate limited kinetics.  After the first 1.8 mg/kg polatuzumab vedotin dose, the Cmax 
was 6.82 (± 4.73) ng/mL, the time to maximum plasma concentration is approximately 2.5 days, and the 
terminal half-life is approximately 4 days.  Plasma exposures of unconjugated MMAE are < 3% of acMMAE 
exposures.  Based on the population PK analysis there is a decrease of plasma unconjugated MMAE 
exposure (AUC) after repeated every-three-week dosing.  
Based on population pharmacokinetics simulations, a sensitivity analysis predicted exposure to 
unconjugated MMAE for patients with bodyweight over 100 kg to be increased by 27%.  
Differences in PK of polatuzumab vedotin in special populations has been adequately investigated by 
population PK analysis. Body weight was identified as the most important statistically significant covariate 
for PK of acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE. Weight-based dosing of polatuzumab vedotin is considered 
justified. However, due to limited clinical experience in patients treated with 1.8 mg/kg Polivy at a total 
dose >240 mg, it is recommended not to exceed the dose 240mg/cycle. Age was not a statistically 
covariate for acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE PK parameters. No dose adjustments in Asian patients or 
among male / female patients was considered necessary. 
In patients with mild (CrCL 60-89 mL/min, n = 161) or moderate (CrCL 30- 59 mL/min, n = 109) renal 
impairment, acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE exposures are similar to patients with normal renal 
function (CrCL ≥ 90 mL/min, n = 185), based on a population PK analysis.  There are insufficient data to 
assess the impact of severe renal impairment (CrCL 15-29 mL/min, n = 3) on PK.  No data are available 
in patients with end-stage renal disease and/or who are on dialysis (see SmPC section 5.2). No dose 
adjustment of Polivy is required in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCL) ≥ 30 mL/min. A 
recommended dose has not been determined for patients with CrCL < 30mL/min due to limited data (see 
SmPC section 4.2). 
In patients with mild hepatic impairment [AST > 1.0-2.5×ULN or ALT > 1.0-2.5×ULN or total 
bilirubin > 1.0-1.5×ULN, n = 54], acMMAE exposures are similar whereas unconjugated MMAE AUC are 
40% higher compared to patients with normal hepatic function (n = 399), based on a population PK 
analysis (see SmPC section 5.2). The administration of Polivy in patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment (bilirubin greater than 1.5 × ULN) should be avoided. No adjustment in the starting dose is 
required when administering Polivy to patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin greater than ULN 
to less than or equal to 1.5 × ULN or AST greater than ULN) (see SmPC section 4.2). There are insufficient 
data to assess the impact of moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5-3×ULN, n = 2) on PK.  No 
data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment or liver transplantation. 
The safety and efficacy in children and adolescents less than 18 years have not been established. No 
studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of polatuzumab vedotin in the 
paediatric population (<18 years old). 
Age did not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE based on a 
population PK analysis with patients aged 20-89 years. No significant difference was observed in the 
Assessment report

pharmacokinetics of acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE among patients < 65 years of age (n = 187) and 
patients ≥ 65 years of age (n = 273).  
No dedicated clinical drug-drug interaction studies with polatuzumab vedotin in humans have been 
conducted. 
The potential impact of polatuzumab vedotin on the PK of bendamustine was evaluated, based on the 
observed bendamustine PK data in R/R DLBCL and R/R FL patients who received rituximab + 
bendamustine + polatuzumab vedotin versus rituximab + bendamustine treatment (randomized arms of 
GO29365 study).  
The plasma PK parameters of bendamustine including Cmax, AUC0-∞, Vss, CL, and T1/2λz were similar in 
patients with R/R DLBCL and R/R FL receiving Pola+BR or BR respectively (less than 20% difference, 
which is well within the CV% of each parameter). These results supported a low risk for polatuzumab 
vedotin to impact bendamustine PK when given in combination. 
Based on physiological-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model simulations of MMAE released from 
polatuzumab vedotin, strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) may increase the area 
under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of unconjugated MMAE by 48%.  In the SmPC (see section 4.5) 
caution is advised in case of concomitant treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitor. Patients receiving concomitant 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be monitored more closely for signs of toxicities.   
Prior to polatuzumab DDI prediction, the model prediction of acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE 
predictions were compared to polatuzumab clinical PK data. It showed an overall trend to under-estimate 
the exposure. Additional simulations were performed by the applicant to ensure the predictive 
performance of the PBPK model in the updated 1090612v19 PBPK report. Data from phase 1 Study 
DCS4968g at 2.4 mg/kg in R/R NHL patients were used. The simulated exposures for acMMAE and MMAE 
with larger dataset (N=45) were acceptable and estimated to be within 20% of the observed exposure. 
Unconjugated MMAE is not predicted to alter the AUC of concomitant medicines that are CYP3A4 
substrates (e.g., midazolam). 
Caution is advised in case of concomitant treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitor. Patients receiving concomitant 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir, clarithromycin, cobicistat, indinavir, itraconazole, 
nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole) 
should be monitored more closely for signs of toxicities.  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of rituximab and bendamustine are not affected by co-administration with 
polatuzumab vedotin.  Concomitant rituximab is associated with increased antibody conjugated MMAE 
(acMMAE) plasma AUC by 24% and decreased unconjugated MMAE plasma AUC by 37%, based on 
population PK analysis.  No dose adjustment is required.  
Bendamustine does not affect acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE plasma AUC.   
DDI risk was determined to be low for the combination of rituximab and bendamustine with polatuzumab 
vedotin. Differences in respective PK parameters were either small or suggested to be not clinically 
relevant, referring to exposure-response modelling. The DDI risk for unconjugated MMAE as a perpetrator 
or a victim with co-administered drugs that are CYP substrates, inhibitors or inducers was analysed by a 
PBPK model. The exposure of unconjugated MMAE was suggested to be increased after concomitant 
treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, while exposure of unconjugated MMAE was reduced after 
concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inducers. Changes in exposure of unconjugated MMAE were 
not considered to result in a clinically relevant impact on safety. Polatuzumab vedotin itself did neither 
inhibit nor induce CYP3A. 
 Strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin) may decrease the exposure of unconjugated MMAE.

The potential interaction of MMAE with UGT was discussed. Given the clinical concentration at the 
intended dose (7ng/mL) and the in vitro Ki value for azatnavir inhibition of UGT1A1, it is concluded that 
there is minimal potential to cause any drug-drug interactions as a substrate or inhibitor of UGT enzymes 
at the clinically relevant concentrations following administration of polatuzumab vedotin is endorsed. 
Throughout the clinical studies, no specific pharmacodynamic endpoints were investigated.  
Overall, post-baseline ADA incidence across all studies (DCS4968g, GO27834, GO29044, GO29365a, 
BO29561, GO29833, and GO29834) was low (2.6%). In the pivotal study GO29365, the incidence of 
treatment-emergent ADA was 6%. Given the low numbers of ADA positive patients, no final conclusion of 
the impact of ADA positive status on efficacy can be drawn. Two patients with early ADA development in 
cycle 2 subsequently presented with PD. A causal relationship with ADA may not be excluded. The 
applicant provided immunogenicity data of remaining patients (Arm G) with the most recent cut-off. 
Population PK analysis predicted that ADA positivity did not have a statistically significant or clinically 
meaningful impact on the PK of acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE. In case of unconjugated MMAE, 
differences observed in exposure were generally much smaller than CV% of 44-58%.  
Two separate analyses for the investigation of exposure-response relationship were conducted. The first 
analysis was based on supportive studies (DCS4968g and GO27834) and the second analysis was based 
on pivotal study GO29365. The analysis based on the pivotal study was performed to ultimately support 
the label proposed combination and dosing regimen; results should be interpreted with caution due to the 
small sample size of the exposure-response analysis.  
No statistically significant correlations (p > 0.05) between exposures (AUC and Cmax) of acMMAE or 
unconjugated MMAE were identified for neutropenia, infections and infestations, thrombocytopenia, and 
probability of dose modification due to an adverse event. 
In the supportive studies, significant correlations were identified for the probability of Grade ≥ 2 
peripheral neuropathy, which increased significantly with increasing acMMAE exposures, and for the 
probability of Grade ≥ 3 anemia, which increased significantly with increasing unconjugated MMAE 
exposures. However, these significant correlations were not confirmed in the pivotal study analysis.   
Overall, exposure-safety analyses suggest that the proposed dosing regimen of polatuzumab vedotin is 
adequate, since no statistically significant correlations with safety endpoints were identified across the 
narrow exposure range in study GO29365 (except for time to first dose modification due to an AE), while 
supportive studies indicated that higher doses and longer treatment duration may be associated with 
higher incidence of peripheral neuropathy or anaemia. Exposure-efficacy analysis based on the 
supportive studies suggested that higher acMMAE exposure significantly correlated with higher tumour 
response rate (INV-BOR and INV-OR). However, this was not confirmed for IRC-BOR and IRC-OR in the 
exposure-efficacy analysis of the pivotal study. Again, it should be considered that patient numbers were 
quite low. Nevertheless, increasing acMMAE exposures significantly correlated with longer OS in the 
pivotal study, and at least trends of increasing time to event endpoints (IRC-DOR, IRC-PFS) with 
increased acMMAE were identified. 
Exposure-safety analyses were performed using data collected from the pivotal and supportive studies. 
Overall, the exposure response analyses support the proposed dosing regimen of 1.8 mg/kg polatuzumab 
vedotin  Q3W  up  to  6  cycles  in  combination  with  rituximab  and  bendamustine  for  treating  R/R  DLBCL 
patients. 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies were conducted. In vitro data raised that MMAE does not inhibit 
the hERG channel at clinically relevant concentrations, and no cardiac toxicity was observed in monkeys. 
In humans, triplicate ECG data retrieved low mean QTc prolongation at clinical concentration of 
1.8mg/kg, not over 20 ms from baseline. After polatuzumab dosing, mean increase in ΔQTcF and the 
upper bound of the 90% CI was < 20 ms at each nominal time. Similarly, concentration-ΔQTcF modeling 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019 
Page 81/159 
  
  
 
 
did not show a clinically relevant ΔQTcF risk at the mean Cmax from 1.8 mg/kg dose groups in studies 
DCS4968g and GO27834, as the upper bounds of 90% CI were all below 10 ms for the three analytes 
(acMMAE, TAb, unconjugated MMAE). Polatuzumab vedotin did not prolong the mean QTc interval to any 
clinically relevant extent based on ECG data from two open-label studies in patients with previously 
treated B-cell malignancies at the recommended dosage (see SmPC section 5.1).  
No dose adjustment of Polivy is required in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
No dose adjustment of Polivy is required in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCL) ≥ 30 mL/min. A 
recommended dose has not been determined for patients with CrCL < 30mL/min due to limited data. 
The administration of Polivy in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin greater 
than 1.5 × ULN) should be avoided.  
No adjustment in the starting dose is required when administering Polivy to patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (bilirubin greater than ULN to less than or equal to 1.5 × ULN or AST greater than ULN). 
The safety and efficacy in children and adolescents less than 18 years have not been established. No data 
are available.  
Exposure-safety and exposure-response analyses conducted further suggested that changes in acMMAE 
and/or unconjugated MMAE exposure, as observed e.g. in special populations or due to DDI, are not 
expected to have a clinically relevant impact on safety and/or efficacy.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, it is concluded that the pharmacokinetics of polatuzumab vedotin has been sufficiently described 
by its three major analytes acMMAE, total antibody and unconjugated MMAE. The incidence of 
anti-polatuzumab vedotin antibodies in the clinical studies was rather low. Results suggested that 
polatuzumab vedotin at the proposed dose of 1.8 mg/kg Q3W regimen does not have a clinically 
meaningful effect on QT prolongation.

Figure 14: Phase I Study Design (with an Example of the Dose Escalation) 
The dose escalation cohorts were to enroll at least 3 patients (unless DLTs were observed in the first 2 
patients prior to enrollment of a third patient) according to a standard 3 + 3 design. 
Dose escalation was carried out with polatuzumab vedotin as a single agent, and in combination with 
rituximab. The inclusion/exclusion criteria properly represented the population of DLBCL patients with 
unmet medical need, transplant ineligible. 
Results 
95 patients were enrolled: 61 in dose-escalation cohorts and 34 in expansion cohorts. Among the DLBCL 
patients (n=40), median age was 67 years [20;81], with60% of patients ≥ 65 years; 25.0 presented with 
ECOG 2, and bulky disease in 30.0%.  
The median number of treatment cycles received was 4.0 (n = 84). Dosing cycle adjustments to ≥28 day 
cycles were permitted per protocol. 
DLT in dose-escalation, single − agent (SA): In the 2.4 mg/kg group, 2/11 patients experienced DLTs:  
o  Grade 4 neutropenia and Grade 4 pneumonia with neutropenic fever (1) 
o  Grade 3 hypoxia (1) 
Polatuzumab vedotin at 2.4 mg/kg q3w was determined to be the recommended SA Phase II dose in 
DLBCL patients.  
DLT in the combination group: A DLT of Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 1 patient out of 9 DLT-evaluable 
patients. Based on the safety of the patients in this cohort, polatuzumab vedotin at 2.4 mg/kg q3w was 
deemed to be an acceptable RP2D in combination with rituximab.

Based  on  the  3+3  escalation  study  design,  the  dose  of  2.4mg/kg  was  initially  considered  as  the 
recommended Phase II dose, in single-agent treatment and in combination with rituximab (375mg/m2). 
Of note, the combination with rituximab was only tested with pola at 2.4mg/kg, not at lower doses.  
Among the 45 patients treated with pola 2.4 mg/kg SA, ORR was 51.1% (23/45, 7 CR and 16 PR), and 9 
patients presented with stable disease (20.0%). The median duration of response (DoR) was 6.2 months 
(95% CI: 3.25, 19.32) and the median PFS was 5.7 months (95% CI: 2.99, 7.92). 
Among the 11 patients treated with pola 1.8 mg/kg SA, 4 had PR (36.4%) and 3 (27.3%) had SD. The 
median PFS was 4.4 months (95% CI: 1.35, 7.36). 
In the combination 2.4 mg/kg group (n=9), 2 CR and 5 PR was observed, with a median DoR of 12.3 
months (95% CI: 4.27, NE) and a median PFS of 12.5 months (95% CI: 6.93, 17.35).

GO29365 
The phase Ib part of the pivotal study aimed at characterize the safety and tolerability of the combination 
of polatuzumab vedotin with BR or BG in R/R FL or R/R DLBCL patients, and define the R2PD. 
The protocol was amended after FDA clinical hold at 2.4mg/kg, due to the frequency of deaths, serious 
adverse  events  and  adverse  events  leading  to  study  discontinuation  at  the  2.4  mg/kg  dose  of 
polatuzumab vedotin in studies DCS4968g (Phase I) and GO27834 (ROMULUS, Phase II). Thus, the phase 
Ib  of  the  pivotal  study  was  updated  to  a  safety  run-in,  carried  out  in  6  patients  per  treatment  arm 
(pola+BR / pola+BG), with pola at 1.8mg/kg.  
In R/R DLBCL patients, 6 patients received pola +BR, and 6 received pola +BG. The median duration of 
treatment was 2.4 months in pola +BR arm, with a median of 4.5 cycles [2, 6]. Results were similar in 
pola+BG patients. 
Safety criteria were observed in <33% of patients enrolled in safety run-in phase. 
Two  patients in each treatment arm died from PD. All patients presented with AEs, mainly grade 3-4 (5/6 
in both treatment groups).  
The dose of 1.8 mg/kg pola was defined as the RP2D in combination with BR or BG for the Phase II part 
of the study.

The  exposure-response  analysis,  focused  on  R/R  DLBCL  patients,  was  based  on  supportive  studies 
DCS4968g and GO27834, with pola SA and/or combined with rituximab or obinutuzumab, and the pivotal 
study GO29365 with pola +BR/BG. 
The  exposure-safety  results  included  both  analytes  acMMAE  and  unconjugated  MMAE,  with  AUC  and 
Cmax measures. Exposure-efficacy results are focused on acMMAE AUC. 
Based on supportive and pivotal studies, exposure-safety analysis did not identify significant correlation 
between acMMAE nor unconjugated MMAE exposure and the probability of the following AEs: Grade ≥3 
Neutropenia, Grade ≥3 Infections and Infestations and Grade ≥3 Thrombocytopenia. It should be noted 
that a higher incidence of these AEs was observed in the pivotal study, possibly related to the addition of 
bendamustine and longer FU (refer to safety discussion). 
Dose  modification  due  to  AEs  was  not  significantly  correlated  to  exposure  in  any  of  these  analyses. 
However, based on cox PH regression, the TTO of dose modification was correlated to the exposure to 
unconjugated MMAE in supportive studies, and acMMAE in the pivotal study; thus the probability would 
not be increased with higher exposure, but it would be sooner. 
Exposure-safety results showed a correlation between grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy (PN) and acMMAE 
exposure in supportive studies, with both AUC (p=0.003) and Cmax (p=0.011). No similar correlation 
was observed in the pivotal study; this is expected since there was no dose escalation in the pivotal study. 
Moreover,  a  higher  incidence  of  PN  was  observed  in  pooled  supportive  studies  (25.2%  vs  14.5%), 
possibly related to the wider dose range up to 2.4mg/kg and up to 8 cycles or more. 
A  correlation  between  grade  ≥3  anemia  and  exposure  to  unconjugated  MMAE  was  observed  in  the 
supportive studies (p=0.01 and 0.015 with AUC and Cmax respectively). This was not observed in the 
pivotal  study,  despite  a  higher  incidence  (18.8%  vs  7.6%),  possibly  related  to  the  addition  of 
bendamustine.  
Exposure-efficacy results only showed significant correlation between acMMAE exposure and BOR/OR in 
the supportive studies (p=0.037 and 0.014 respectively). As expected in absence of dose increase, this 
was  not  observed  in  the  pivotal  study.  However,  the  cox  PH  regression  showed  an  increase  in  OS 
(p=0.048) with higher acMMAE exposure.

No proper statistical hypothesis was raised in this exploratory phase Ib/II study.  
The applicant used 95% exact Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals (CIs). The applicant assumed a 40% 
CR rate in the BR arm, and a 25% increase in CR rate when polatuzumab vedotin is added to BR. Thus, 
with  40  patients  per  arm,  the  95%  CI  for  the  difference  in  CR  rates  is  3.8%,  46.2%.  The  applicant 
estimated that with 40 patients in each of the BR arms, there is at least an 87% chance of observing at 
least one AE with true incidence of ≥5%. 
The applicant assumed a margin of error of +/- 17% based on sample size of 40 patients per arm. 
An exploratory comparison of CR rates for the BR-containing regimens was conducted using the Cochran 
Mantel Haenszel chi-square test adjusted for randomization stratification factors. 
Response assessment was determined using the Modified Lugano 2014 Response Criteria. Analysis was 
performed on ITT population.  
Sensitivity analysis:  
To assess the robustness of the results of PFS by IRC in the randomized Phase II portion, the applicant 
provide sensitivity analysis with two additional censoring rules. 
o  For the patients who had missed one or more assessments before their recorded event of disease 
progression  or  death,  the  data  were  censored  at  the  date  of  the  last  non-missing  disease 
assessments prior to the events.  
o  For patients who started new antilymphoma therapies (NALT) prior to the disease progression, 
the data were censored at the date of the last non-missing disease assessments before the NALT.  
The estimates of the PFS by IRC using additional censoring rules are consistent with previous IRC PFS 
results with the initial censoring rule. 
Multiple Cox Regression, for PFS and OS 
The  prognostic  factors  included  in  the  final  models  were  selected  based  on  the  statistical  threshold 
(p=0.2) and clinical consideration while controlling for the multi-colinearity among the factors. Two sets

of factors were used for PFS and OS: PFS: Ann Arbor Stage, Baseline ECOG and IPI; OS: Ann Arbor Stage, 
Baseline  ECOG  and  bulky  disease  and  IPI.  The  multiple  cox-regression  adjusted  on  these  prognostic 
factors confirmed previous PFS and OS results, in favor of pola+BR arm (both INV and IRC assessed). 
Recruitment 
Between 15 October 2014 (first patient in) and 13 September 2016 (last patient in, Arms A-F), a total of 
225 patients were enrolled in study Arms A to F at 54 investigator centres in the following countries: US 
(12 sites), France (6 sites), Spain (5 sites), Australia (4 sites), Canada (4 sites), Czech Republic (4 sites), 
Italy (4 sites), Turkey (4 sites), Great Britain (3 sites), Hungary (3 sites), Germany (2 sites), Korea (2 
sites) and The Netherlands (1 site). 
First Patient Entered: 15 October 2014 
Last Patient Entered Arms A−F: 13 September 2016 
Conduct of the study 
The first version of the protocol for Study GO29365 was dated 23 May 2014. Protocol amendments for 
Study GO29365 - all implemented after the first patient had been dosed on 15 October 2014- are 
summarized below.  
1st Amendment dated 27 April 2015, Protocol v2.0, This was implemented after the first 9 patients in 
Cohort 1A of the safety run-in (all 6 DLBCL and 3 FL) had been dosed with pola+BR. The key reasons for 
this amendment were as follows: 
•  Amendment to the Phase Ib portion to be a safety run-in at the 1.8 mg/kg polatuzumab vedotin 
dose for each lymphoma histology. The original design for a Phase Ib dose-escalation of 
polatuzumab vedotin to 2.4 mg/kg was modified following the issuance of a Partial Clinical Hold at 
the 2.4 mg/kg dose by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in September 2014. 
•  Adoption of the new Lugano 2014 response criteria (Cheson et al. 2014) for NHL (which were 
published after finalization the first protocol), for evaluating CR by PET at the primary response 
assessment by IRC. 
2nd Amendment dated 14 September 2015, Protocol v3.0 This was implemented after one patient in the 
BR arm of the randomized Phase II had been dosed, and included the following key changes: 
•  Modification of the Lugano 2014 response criteria to include the requirement for bone marrow 
examinations for all patients (DLBCL as well as FL) at screening for staging purposes. Response 
was assessed by the IRC and the investigator on the basis of physical examinations, CT scans, 
PET scans, and bone marrow examinations using the modified Lugano 2014 response criteria. 
•  Update to eligibility criteria to exclude patients with secondary, as well as primary and CNS 
lymphoma and exclude all patients (R/R FL as well as R/R DLBCL) eligible for autologous stem cell 
transplantation. 
• 
Inclusion of gastrointestinal perforations as an identified risk associated with obinutuzumab 
treatment. 
•  Updates to the guidelines for monitoring of hepatitis B reactivation for patients with occult or prior 
hepatitis B virus infection (negative HBsAg and positive HBcAb), for pregnancy prevention for 
women of childbearing age and for men (extension of period of contraception) and for the 
pregnancy test for all women of childbearing age.

3rd Amendment dated 11 July 2017, Protocol v4.0 The primary purpose of this amendment was to include 
second malignancies as a AESI/non-serious expedited AE requiring expedited reporting, and to require 
indefinite reporting of second malignancies (even if the study has ended) for patients enrolled in the 
obinutuzumab containing cohorts (pola+BG). 
4th Amendment dated 16 November 2017, Protocol v5.0. The primary purpose of this amendment was to 
add an additional cohort of 20−30 patients (Arm G) with R/R DLBCL who will receive a new lyophilized 
formulation of polatuzumab vedotin (140 mg/vial) in combination with BR, in order to gain clinical 
experience with this combination in R/R DLBCL in terms of PK and safety. Additionally, protocol v5 
introduced the analysis of PFS and DOR by IRC for the DLBCL cohorts as requested by the U.S. FDA. 
5th Amendment dated 31 May 2018, Protocol v6. The primary purpose of this amendment was the 
expansion of Arm G, adding 10 patients with R/R DLBCL with one prior line of therapy (i.e., second line 
[2L]) to evaluate the efficacy of polatuzumab vedotin (lyophilized) in combination with BR. Protocol v6 
also added the analysis of IRC assessed best overall response for the DLBCL cohorts.  
6th Amendment dated 02 October 2018, Protocol v7 The purpose was to add a new arm (Arm H) to the 
Phase II New Formulation (NF) Cohort that will enroll approximately 60 patients with relapsed or 
refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (R/R DLBCL) who will receive the new 140-mg/vial lyophilized 
formulation in order to gain supportive clinical experience with the combination of polatuzumab vedotin 
(lyophilized formulation) with BR. Objectives, study description, exploratory biomarker assessments 
were updated for Arm H, inclusion criterion for HHV8-positive DLBCL, not otherwise specified was deleted. 
Pharmacokinetic Sampling and Anti-Drug Antibody Schedule for the NF Cohort (Arm H) for Patients 
Treated with Polatuzumab Vedotin (Lyophilized) plus BR was added. Additional important requirements 
were: Updated the Statistical Considerations and Analysis Plan for the NF Cohort, including the rationale 
for sample size and pooled efficacy analysis plan (Arms G and H);  Updated the secondary objectives for 
Arm G of the NF Cohort to include investigator-assessed duration of response, progression-free survival, 
event-free survival, and overall survival. 
Results 
Primary  analysis,  with  data  cut-off  date  on  30  Apr  2018,  was  provided,  allowing  a  1-year  FU  after 
preliminary response assessment for all treated patients.

Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) 
Patient reports outcome (PRO) for peripheral neuropathy (PN) was evaluated based on TINAS scores. 
Missing baseline information was 20.8% in phase Ib and 29.4% in phase II. 
Less than 50% of patients filled the questionnaire; participation decreased further over time and less than 
25% of the few compliant patients continued this assessment after week 29 in the pola+BR, DLBCL arm.  
No significant change from baseline was identified from pooled pola+BR/BG data in the weekly tables. 
However, once presented in linear plots, mean TINAS scores appear higher in pola containing arms in 
DLBCL, vs BR arm whereas comparatively, BR scores remain flat in the linear slots.  
Immunogenicity 
Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were measured to assess the immunogenicity of polatuzumab vedotin and 
obinutuzumab. For all patients treated with polatuzumab vedotin, the baseline prevalence of ADAs was 
3.7% (5/134 evaluable patients).

Table 40: Incidence of Anti-Drug Antibodies to Polatuzumab Vedotin in Study GO29365 
Among all patients treated with pola in GO29365 study (all arms and all indications included), a total of 8 
patients developed ADA: against the antibody (2) and against the linker, drug, or neo-epitopes (5; NE in 
1 patient). 
Among the 4 DLBCL patients presenting with ADA, impact on efficacy was not evidenced, considering that 
3 of them completed 5 to 6 cycles of treatment and DOR from 21 to 38 months. However, the last patient 
presented with ADA at C2 and was diagnosed with PD at C3.  
Similarly, among the 4 FL patients presenting with ADA, 3 had ADA detected after having completed the 
6 cycles of treatment, with DOR from 15 to 21 months. The last patient had early ADA at C2 and was 
diagnosed with PR at C3 and PD at PRA.  
In the pola+BG cohort, no ADAs were detected. 
Subgroup analyses 
Exploratory  subgroup  analysis  of  PFS  in  patients  with  R/R  DLBCL  evaluated  the  potential  impact  of 
demographic and baseline disease characteristics, and other prognostic factors on the treatment effect. 
Subgroup analyses for the primary end point of PET-CR at PRA by IRC were presented showing consistent 
benefit of pola+BR versus BR in all subgroups defined by various baseline characteristics. For the patients 
having bulky disease in the BR arm, 2 patients had complete responses (13.3%, 95% CI: 1.7, 40.5) as 
compared to 4 in the pola+BR arm (40%, 95% CI: 12.2, 73.8).

Table 48: Stratified Multiple Logistic Regression for Response Endpoints Adjusted for 
Potential Prognostic Factors 
Multiple Cox Regressions were performed for the time-to-event endpoints including PFS by investigator 
and IRC, and OS and included in the initial MAA dossier. All potential imbalanced baseline and prognostic 
factors (age, ECOG, refractory status, stage, bulky disease, IPI) were first examined individually, and 
those with a p-value <0.2 were put into the multiple regression model as candidates for the final model 
selection. Only factors that had a p-value <0.2 from the final model remained, and some factors were not 
included in the final multiple Cox-regression model due to multi-collinearity. For PFS by investigator, after 
adjusting for Ann Arbor stage and performance status, the HR was 0.34 (95%CI: 0.20, 0.58) and for PFS 
by IRC, the HR was 0.37 (95%CI: 0.21, 0.66). Similarly, for OS, after adjusting for the same factors and 
bulky disease, the HR was 0.43 (95%CI: 0.24, 0.78). 
Sensitivity analyses 
Two  sensitivity  analyses  of  PFS  with  two  additional  censoring  rules  were  provided,  for  missing 
assessments and for NALT received prior to disease progression. 
The stratified HR for PFS by IRC censoring for NALT was 0.28 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.53). The stratified HR for 
PFS by IRC censoring for one or more missed assessments was 0.33 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.59). 
Multivariate regression models and propensity score analyses 
Further  two  types  of  analyses  were  conducted,  multivariable  regression  models  and  propensity  score 
weighted regression models, on the following four key efficacy endpoints:

Supplemental Results – Arm G 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019 
Page 118/159 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Arm G was added to the pivotal study, as per CHMP advice during PRIME meetings, to gather clinical data 
with the 140 lyo DP, intended for marketing.  
At  time  of  initial  submission,  25  patients  were  included  in  the  safety  population  of  arm  G.  The 
demographic in arm G is comparable to arm C (pola+BR, liquid formulation). It should be noted that a 
lower proportion of patients present with ECOG 2 (4.0% vs 15.0% in arm C). 
For PK and safety results for arm G, refer to dedicated sections. 
At time of response to LoQ, the applicant provided preliminary results from arm G. Arm H remains with 
ongoing recruitment, with results expected not before Q2 2020.  
Based on results in 32 patients in arm G (CCOD 12 Nov 2018), CR rate was 34.3% (18.6, 53.2). However, 
median PFS and OS are sharply lower than in arm C:  
- 
PFS: 6.0 months (3.5, 6.6) in arm G vs 11.1 months (6.2, 13.9) in arm C; 
-  OS: 6.1 months (4.4, NE) in arm G vs 12.4 (9.0, NE). 
Of note, the median FU in arm G, at time of CCOD, was 6 months, vs 22.3 months in arm C.  
Additional efficacy results in 42 patients, up to 15 March 2019, remain similar in terms of CR, lower than 
in arm C (33.3%; [19.6, 49.6]). However, OS increased up to 9.1 months [6.0, NE]. Subgroups analysis 
suggest  that  the  difference  in  CR  rates  would  mainly  be  due  to  the  lower  proportion  of  2L  refractory 
patients in arm G, which present with the higher CR rate in arm C.  
PK analysis supports the comparability of both liquid and lyo formulations. 
Regarding the safety profile, no new safety signal nor unexpected trend was retrieved from these updated 
safety results. The safety profile, including the important potential risk of carcinogenicity, remain closely 
monitored in this ongoing study. 
Study DCS4968g, phase I study  
An  open-label,  multicenter,  Phase  I  trial  of  the  safety  and  pharmacokinetics  of  escalating  doses  of 
DCDS4501A (pola) in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic 
lymphocytic  leukemia  and  DCDS4501A  in  combination  with  rituximab  in  patients  with  relapsed  or 
refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma  
The primary objective included the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of polatuzumab vedotin and 
the  determination  of  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  and  dose-limiting  toxicities  (DLTs)  when 
administered Q3W in patients with NHL and CLL. Refer to the previous section dedicated to dose-response 
studies for further details regarding the determination of the dose. 
The secondary objectives included efficacy assessment in RR NHL, with a preliminary assessment of the 
anti-tumor activity of pola (SA or combined with rituximab) in patients with RR NHL  
This study was carried out with the liquid formulation of pola. 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria are representative for the population of RR DLBCL patients with unmet 
medical need, transplant ineligible, and coherent with the population recruited in the pivotal study. 
A total of 40 DLBCL patients were recruited, including 39 treated with polatuzumab vedotin alone, up to 
2.4mg/kg, and 1 patient treated with pola 2.4mg/kg in combination with rituximab 375mg/m2. 
Among patients with the selected dose of 1.8 mg/kg (n=4, SA), no CR was raised, but 2 PR, 1 SD and 1 
PD. The patient treated with pola +R (2.4mg/kg) presented with PR. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019

The median DOR was 6.8 months (2.27, 11.40) in SA 1.8 mg/kg patients. 
In the SA 1.8 mg/kg group, all patients had PFS events, with median PFS of 4.6 months (95% CI: 1.35, 
13.90); the single patient in the combination 2.4 mg/kg group had a PFS of 17.3 months. 
Study GO27834 (ROMULUS) 
A Randomized, Open-Label, Multicenter, Phase II Trial Evaluating the Safety and Activity of Pinatuzumab 
Vedotin  (DCDT2980S)  in  Combination  with  Rituximab  or  Polatuzumab  Vedotin  (DCDS4501A)  in 
Combination with Rituximab and a Non-Randomized Phase IB/II Evaluation of Polatuzumab Vedotin in 
Combination  with  Obinutuzumab  in  Patients  with  Relapsed  or  Refractory  B-Cell  Non-  Hodgkin’s 
Lymphoma. 
This study was carried out with the liquid formulation of polatuzumab. 
The  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  are  representative  for  the  population  of  RR  DLBCL  patients  with  high 
unmet need, transplant ineligible, and coherent with the population recruited in the pivotal study. 
A total of 81 DLBCL patients were recruited in the rituximab containing arms (A and B), including 42 in 
arm A pinatuzumab + polatuzumab vedotin alone and 39 in arm B, pola + rituximab. Patients with PD in 
Arm A or B could cross over to the other treatment arm. 
In arm B, patients received polatuzumab at 2.4mg/kg and rituximab at 375 mg/m2 by IV infusion in 
21-day cycles. 
Anti-tumor  activity  was  observed  in  this  study  with  pola+rituximab.  ORR  was  observed  in  53.8%  of 
patients in the RTX+Pola arm, with median PFS of 5.6 months and median OS of 20.5 months.  
Regarding results obtained in arms with pola+G, anti-tumor activity was observed but lower than in the 
pivotal study. No CR was obtained as IRC reviewed. The IRC-assessed OR rate by PET/CT was 19.4%, up 
to 25.8% by CT alone. IRC assessed CR rate by CT alone was 6.5%. A similar trend was observed while 
investigator-assessed. While OS was similar to the pivotal study results (10.7 months vs 9.3 months in 
pivotal study), median PFS was almost twice shorter (2.8 months vs 5.1).

Polatuzumab  Vedotin 
(DCDS4501A) 
in  Combination  with  Rituximab  or  Obinutuzumab, 
Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, and Prednisone in Patients with B-Cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. 
The study included adult patients with confirmed B-cell NHL in the dose-escalation portion of the study 
(newly diagnosed or R/R) and previously untreated patients with DLBCL in the dose-expansion portion of 
the study. 
This  study  was  carried  out  with  the  liquid  formulation  of  pola,  from  1.0  to  1.8  mg/kg  doses.  It  was 
associated with:  
-  CHP  regimen:  Cyclophosphamide  750  mg/m2  administered  IV  on  Day  1,  Doxorubicin  50  mg/m2 
administered IV on Day 1 and Prednisone 100 mg/day by mouth (PO) on Days 1-5 (or prednisolone (100 
mg/day) if not available) 
- and Rituximab: Six to eight cycles of rituximab at 375 mg/m2, administered IV every 21 days (or over 
28 days for those patients who experienced toxicity that necessitated an extended cycle duration).  
- or Obinutuzumab: IV infusion as an absolute (flat) dose of 1000 mg on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 and 
on Day 1 of Cycles 2-6 or 2-8.

A  total  of  51  DLBCL  patients  (ITT  population)  were  recruited  in  the  rituximab  containing  arm 
(R-CHP-pola), in both dose escalation and expansion cohorts.  
Globally, R-CHP-pola showed anti-tumor activity, with CR rate by CT/MRI with PET scan at 76.0% (38/50; 
90%  CI:  64.03,  85.53).  The  12-month  PFS  was  90.0%  (95%  CI:  81.68,  98.32),  12-month  EFS  was 
80.0% (95% CI: 68.91, 91.09), and 12-month OS was 94.0% (95% CI: 87.42, 100.00). The median PFS, 
EFS and OS were not reached, and most of patients remain in follow-up in this ongoing study. 
When focused on results in the expansion cohort in DLBCL patients (n=40, 1.8mg/kg, untreated DLBCL), 
a similar trend was observed, with 72.5% of CR (58.61, 83.75). The 12-month PFS was 87.50% (95% CI: 
77.25, 97.75), 12-month EFS was 75.0% (95% CI: 61.58, 88.42), and 12-month OS was 92.50% (95% 
CI:  84.34,  100.00).  These  results  highlight  anti-tumor  activity  of  this  combination  R-CHP-pola  in 
untreated DLBCL, more markedly than in the pivotal study and confirming the positive trend observed in 
the pivotal study in RR TNE DLBCL patients, with pola+BR treatment. 
Regarding  results  obtained  with  pola+G-CHP  in  DLBCL  patients,  25  patients  were  included,  with  17 
patients  in  the  dose  expansion  cohort  (1.8mg/kg,  untreated  DLBCL).  Results  obtained  were  broadly 
similar to the arm R-CHP-pola. Efficacy was also observed untreated DLBCL patients (expansion cohort), 
with 76.5% of CR (53.95, 91.54). The 12-month PFS was 94.12% (95% CI: 82.93, 100.00), 12-month 
EFS was 88.240% (95% CI: 72.92, 100.00), and 12-month OS was 94.12% (95% CI: 82.93, 100.00). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy data have mainly been collected in one pivotal Phase IB/II evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
polatuzumab vedotin plus bendamustine and rituximab (BR) versus BR, in the treatment of R/R DLBCL in 
adults ineligible for HSCT (Study GO29365). The supportive studies GO27834 (ROMULUS) and DCS4968g 
provide additional data in patients with R/R DLBCL. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  pivotal  study  GO29365  is  a  Phase Ib/II,  multicenter, open-label  study  of polatuzumab  vedotin  in 
combination with BR or bendamustine plus obinutuzumab (BG) in patients with R/R FL or DLBCL. Study 
GO29365  originally  used  the  liquid  formulation  of  polatuzumab  vedotin,  while  the  lyophilized  drug  is 
intended for commercialization. The protocol was amended to add a new formulation cohort (Arm G).  
The dose of 2.4mg/kg of polatuzumab vedotin was initially considered as the recommended Phase II dose. 
However,  following  the  issuance  of  a  Partial  Clinical  Hold  at  the  2.4  mg/kg  dose  by  the  U.S.  FDA  in 
September 2014 due to safety concerns, the dose of polatuzumab vedotin was reduced to 1.8 mg/kg. 
Thus, the 1.8 mg dose was tested in the safety run-in phase of the pivotal study GO29365, and confirmed 
as  the  RP2D  for  the  phase  II  part  of  the  study,  in  combination  with  bendamustine  and  rituximab  or 
obinutuzumab. 
The phase II part of the study, in RR DLBCL TNE patients, was randomized (1:1 randomization) between 
pola+BR  and  BR  treatments,  open-label,  with  a  stratification  per  duration  of  response  to  the  prior 
treatment (≤ 12 months versus > 12 months). As there is a 98% prevalence of positive CD79b staining 
in DLBCL, similar to what has been reported in the literature (92−100%) (Dornan et al. 2009; Pfeifer et al. 
2015)  and  similar  CD79b  expression  pattern  seems  to  be  detectable  also  across  biologically  distinct 
DLBCL subtypes, no requirement for CD79b subtyping as prerequisite for treatment in clinical practice 
was considered necessary. 
According  to  the  ESMO  guideline  for  DLBCL  treatment  (September  2015),  recommendations  for 
transplant  –non-eligible  patients  in  first  relapse  mainly  include  Platinum-  and/or  gemcitabine-based 
regimens, or clinical trials with novel drugs. After 2 or more relapses, clinical trials or palliative care are

recommended. However, bendamustine +rituximab is listed among second line and subsequent therapies 
in the NCCN guidelines (version 1.2019) and was accepted by the CHMP / SAWP.  
Patients  received  up  to  6  cycles  of  treatment  (21  days  per  cycle)  of  polatuzumab  vedotin  (pola)  1,8 
mg/kg, associated with bendamustine at 90 mg/m2 and rituximab 375 mg/m2.  
The primary endpoint is the CR at time of primary response assessment (6 to 8 weeks after D1C6 or last 
treatment  received),  with  PET-SCAN  as  assessed  by  IRC.  CR  is  completed  by  PFS,  EFS  and  OS 
assessment as secondary endpoint. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Between  15  October  2014  (first  patient  in)  and  13  September  2016  (last  patient  in,  Arms  A-F),  40 
patients were enrolled in each of the DLBCL arms.  
No major protocol deviation led to patient withdrawal. However, the high frequency of major deviation in 
RR DLBCL patients was noted, with 12.5 % in BR patients and 19.6% in BR+pola patients (phase Ib and 
II).  In  the  pola+BR,  DLBCL  arm,  3  (6.5%)  patients  had  preliminary  response  assessment  (PRA)  not 
performed in due time, but with limited impact on primary endpoint assessment.  
No patient was lost to follow up in pola+ BR nor BR DLBCL arms. AEs were the most common reason for 
patients discontinuing study treatment in pola+BR arm (30.8% stopped treatment).  
The  median  age  was  69  years  (range:  30  86  years).  Sixty-four  out  of  80  patients  (80%)  had  ECOG 
performance score (PS) of 0 1 and 14 out of 80 patients (18%) had ECOG PS of 2. The majority of patients 
(98%) had DLBCL not otherwise specified (NOS). Overall, 48% of patients had activated B-cell (ABC) 
DLBCL  and  40%  had  germinal  center  B-cell  like  (GCB)  DLBCL.  Primary  reasons  patients  were  not 
candidates  for  HSCT  included  age  (40%),  insufficient  response  to  salvage  therapy  (26%)  and  prior 
transplant failure (20%). The median number of prior therapies was 2 (range: 1 7), with 29% (n = 23) 
receiving one prior therapy, 25% (n = 20) receiving 2 prior therapies, and 46% (n = 37) receiving 3 or 
more prior therapies. All except one patient in the pola+BR arm of the randomized Phase II were naïve to 
bendamustine treatment. 80% of patients had refractory disease. 
The median age was slightly higher in the BR arm (71.0 years [30-84] vs 67.1 years [33-86] in POLA +BR 
arm).  Patients  in  the  comparator  BR  arm  present  with  more  severe  condition  at  baseline,  including 
tumour size (bulky) and IPI score, not balanced and favour the polatuzumab arm. A limited impact of 
these  imbalances  observed  in  terms  of  IPI  and  bulky  disease  was  demonstrated  via  a  multiple  Cox 
Regression analysis. 
WHO 2016 DLBCL status was heterogeneous, but balanced in both arms. Efficacy data per WHO status 
were provided in arms C and D. Only WHO NOS patients, ABC and GCB, were enrolled in arms C and D, 
and all but 3 were ABC/GCB in arm G (the 3 remaining were 1 EBV and 2 MYC/BCL2/BCL6 patients). 
Regarding PFS and OS results, in ABC patients, median PFS (10.76 months; [6.34, NE]) and OS (15.38 
months; [10.45, NE]) were significantly higher in pola+BR arm vs BR arm (HR=0.21; [0.09, 0.51]). No 
such difference with pola+BR treatment was observed on PFS results in GCB patients, with median PFS of 
2.5 months (1.91, NE) vs 1.87 months (0.95, 4.53) in BR arm. However, HR showed a favourable trend 
with  pola+BR  treatment  in  these  patients  (0.49;  [0.23,  1.05]),  and  OS  was  almost  twice  longer  in 
pola+BR arm vs BR in these patients (7.23 months [4.11, NE] vs 3.81 [1.87, NE], HR=0.57 [0.25, 1.31]). 
Further,  distinct  subtypes  will  be  analysed  within  Arm  H  and  it  is  considered  necessary  to  confirm 
response in any relevant subtype at least on a descriptive level. Data from study Arm H will be presented 
as a condition to the CMA (see Annex II, RMP). This should include analyses by subtype. 
In both randomized arms, only one third of patients were treated in 2nd (2L) line treatment; most patients 
had received at least 2 prior treatments. To be noted, 47.5% and 45% of patients had received at least

3  prior  treatments  in  BR  and  POLA+BR  arms  respectively.  In  both  arms,  CR  globally  decreased  with 
increasing number of prior treatments, in both IRC and INV assessed results. This trend was less marked 
in BR arm, since CR rate increased up to 22.2% in 3L patients. However, it should be interpreted with 
caution, considering the limited sample size for this subgroup. Despite crossing CIs, CR rate remained 
higher in pola+BR vs BR arm in each subgroup, mainly in 2L patients: 63.6% (30.8, 89.1) vs 16.7% (2.1, 
48.4), despite limited sample size (11 and 12 patients respectively). Median PFS and OS were higher in 
pola+BR arm in each subgroup of treatment line, and with both IRC and INV assessments, with a positive 
trend despite CI of HR crossing 1. Results were significant in 4L+ patients (IRC assessed). 
In order to assess the performance of the comparator arm, the applicant provided an updated literature 
review regarding the comparator arm, including Ohmachi et al. 2013; Hong et al. 2018; and Dang et al. 
2018. Despite limited comparability, similar trends in BR efficacy are seen, with differences mainly based 
on the variable proportion of patients with refractory status between these publications and the pivotal 
study  G029365  (pivotal  GO29365  enrolled  85%  refractory,  Dang  2018  30%,  Hong  2018  10%  and 
Ohmachi 2013 0%), and on the number of prior treatments. A comparison of efficacy included only the 
relapsed patients from the pivotal trial. Despite the very small number of patients (N=6) results for the BR 
arm are overall comparable to those of the historical trials. Overall, the observed efficacy results in the BR 
arm are not considered to deviate substantially from those of the historical trials and any difference is 
likely to be attributed to the differences in study population and study design. 
CR rate at PRA (based on PET-CT, IRC assessed), was higher in the pola+BR arm: 40.0% (16/40 patients; 
95%  CI:  [24.9%,  56.7%])  vs  17.5%  in  the  BR  arm  (7/40  patients;  95%  CI:  [7.3%,  32.8%]).  The 
difference in CR rates between arms was 22.5%, significant and in favour of pola+BR (95% CI: 2.6%, 
40.2%; p =0.0261, Cochran Mantel-Haenszel [CMH] chi-square). It has been discussed whether Wilson 
test was the appropriate one, but Wilson method was eventually considered acceptable as it appeared 
more  conservative  [22.5%  (2.6%,  40.2%)]  than  if  standard  normal  approximation  method  [22.5% 
(3.3%, 41.7%)] was used. 
However, considering the 17% margin error applied in the statistical model, it should be noted that the 
lower real CI value for CR in pola+BR could get down to: 24.9 -17= 7.9%. The statistical model used in 
this phase II study does not allow to further adjust the CI. 
As determined by the INV, CR described a trend similar to IRC results: 42.5% (27.0, 59.1) in pola+BR vs. 
15.0% (5.7, 29.8), with a Δ 27.5% (7.7, 44.7) p=0.0061.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints (CR and OR [CR or PR]), assessed by the INV or IRC per PET-CT and CT 
only, remained consistent with the primary efficacy results (POLA+BR vs BR). 
The median DOR was not estimable (NE) (95% CI: 8.8, NE) for pola+BR vs 7.7 months (95% CI: 3.2, 
18.9) for BR (stratified HR =0.40; 95% CI: 0.16, 1.01). 
The  favourable  results  observed  in  the  response  rates  (CR  and  OR)  are  reflected  in  the  secondary 
endpoints of PFS, EFS and OS. The PFS as determined by IRC was almost thrice increased in patients 
treated  with  pola+  BR  compared  to  BR  (stratified  HR  =0.36;  95%  CI:  0.21,  0.63;  p  =0.0002),  with 
median PFS of 9.5 months [6.2, 13.9] vs 3.7 months [2.4, 4.5]. Investigator-assessed progression free 
survival (PFS) was an exploratory endpoint which was not type 1 error controlled.  The median PFS in the 
Polivy+BR arm was 7.6 months (95% CI: 6.0, 17.0) vs 2.0 months (95% CI: 1.5, 3.7) in the control arm.  
The unadjusted estimate for PFS HR was 0.34. 
OS was an exploratory endpoint which was not type 1 error controlled. The unadjusted estimate for OS HR 
was  0.42.  When  accounting  for  the  influence of  baseline  covariates  the  OS  HR  was  adjusted to  0.59. 
Covariates included primary refractory status, number of prior lines of therapy, IPI, and prior stem cell 
transplant.

The median OS was 12.4 months (95% CI: 9.0, NE) in the pola+BR arm, and 4.7 months (95% CI: 3.7, 
8.3) in the BR arm. At 6 months, 30/40 patients (event free rate of 78.95%; [65.99, 91.91]) remained 
alive in the pola+BR arm, vs 11/40 patients (event free rate of 37.38%; [20.68, 54.07]) in the BR arm. 
This difference remained persistent over time, at 9 months (24/40 vs 7/40) and at 12 months (19/40 vs 
7/40).  
Although relapsed patients were in minority compared to refractory ones, the clinical benefit for both of 
them seems numerically be shown.  
Although - according to NCCN Guidelines- rituximab should not be used in patients with early relapse (<6 
months)  after  Rituximab-based  treatment  it  has  been  clearly  shown,  that  also  rituximab  pretreated 
patients show benefit from Pola+BR and no indication restriction based on this is necessary.  
All transplant ineligibile subgroups of patients derived clinical benefit from Pola+BR independently of the 
reasons for their ineligibility.  
Based  on  the  subgroups  analysis  on  primary  endpoint,  PFS  and  OS  the  effect  remains  stable  across 
subgroups, independently of baseline imbalances between arms in RR TNE DLBCL patients supporting the 
internal consistency of the study.  
When  combined  with  obinutuzumab  in  the  expansion  cohort  (n=21  in  the  pola+BG  arm)  the  primary 
endpoint raised 28.6% of CR (11.3, 52.2). Despite the fact that this expansion cohort was not designed 
for comparison, these results show anti-tumor activity, which remains lower than 40.0% (24.9, 56.7) of 
CR obtained in the pola+BR arm.  
Patient reports outcome (PRO) for peripheral neuropathy was evaluated based on TINAS scores. Due to 
programming issues quality of these data was limited. 
Among all patients treated with pola in GO29365 study, a total of 8 patients developed ADA: against the 
antibody  (2)  and  against  the  linker,  drug,  or  neo-epitopes  (5;  NE  in  1  patient).  Among  the  4  DLBCL 
patients  presenting  with  ADA,  impact  on  efficacy  was  not  evidenced,  considering  that  3  of  them 
completed 5 to 6 cycles of treatment and DOR from 21 to 38 months. However, the last patient presented 
with ADA at C2 and was diagnosed with progressive disease at C3.  
Ancillary analysis and sensitivity analysis confirmed the favorable trends in PFS and OS across subgroups 
in  the  overall  R/R  DLBCL  population,  in  favor  of  the  pola+BR  arm.  Further  analysis  was  provided  on 
primary endpoint and additional prognostic factors, raising a similar favorable trend. 
Few  patients  became  as  consequence  of  treatment  with  Pola+BR  transplant-eligible,  have  been 
transplanted and are in remission. This makes the regimen useful in introduction of potential curative 
treatment in otherwise incurable patients. 
Despite  different  schemes  in  administration  and  combinations  compared  with  the  pivotal  study,  the 
efficacy  results  raised  from  the  three  main  supportive  studies  are  supportive  for  the  positive  efficacy 
results observed in the pivotal study. 
As a conclusion, the positive effect of the addition of POLA to BR regimen in RR DLBCL, TNE patients, was 
observed in the primary endpoint, with a significant increase in CR rate (PET-scan, IRC assessed, at PRA) 
from 17.5% to 40.0%. This favourable effect was reinforced by secondary endpoints, showing similar 
trends in CR and OR, with or without PET-scan, and INV or IRC assessed.  
This impact in CR was clinically relevant on PFS, EFS and OS, with a 7.7 months improvement in OS at 
time of cut-off date (from 4.7 to 12.4 months). The cut-off date for all results was initially April 30th 2018 
(after all patients completed one year after primary response assessment). Median duration of follow-up 
for all cohorts in the study was then between 20.7 and 37.6 months. There was initially a sign of a possible 
PFS plateau in the Pola+BR, but in updated analyses from 11 October 2018 this was not shown. Therefore 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019 
Page 124/159 
  
  
 
 
it seems that despite of CR achievement, Pola+BR will still remain in most cases only a life-prolonging 
treatment.  
These  efficacy  data  were  completed  with  preliminary  results  from  arm  G,  carried  out  with  the  lyo 
fomulation. Based on results in 32 patients in arm G (CCOD 12 Nov 2018), trend in efficacy, observed in 
arm C, would be confirmed, with CR rate of 34.3% (18.6, 53.2); median PFS and OS are sharply lower, 
despite not designed for comparison to arm C: PFS: 6.0 months (3.5, 6.6) in arm G vs 11.1 months (6.2, 
13.9) in arm C; OS: 6.1 months (4.4, NE) in arm G vs 12.4 (9.0, NE). However, the median FU in arm G, 
at time of CCOD, was 6 months, vs 22.3 months in arm C. Additional efficacy results in 42 patients, up to 
15 March 2019, remain similar in terms of CR, lower than in arm C (33.3%; [19.6, 49.6]). However, OS 
increased up to 9.1 months [6.0, NE]. Subgroups analysis suggest that the difference in CR rates would 
mainly be due to the lower proportion of 2L relapsed patients in arm G, which present with the higher CR 
rate in arm C.  
Furthermore,  PK  analysis  supports  the  comparability  of  both  liquid  and  lyo  formulations  (see  Clinical 
Pharmacology). Considering interim results provided and additional efficacy data up to 15 March 2019, 
and  also  potential  differences  in  the  populations  in  arms  C  and  G,  results  from  arm  G  with  the  final 
formulation remain coherent with previous results.  
Consultation with expert groups  
The CHMP consulted the SAG-O on the following questions: 
To what extent has it been demonstrated that polatuzumab vedotin as an add-on to 
1. 
bendamustine and rituximab confers additional clinical benefit? 
The evidence provided is based on a small exploratory trial in a very heterogeneous population in terms 
of prognosis, and where there is an imbalance in important prognostic factors favouring the Polivy+BR 
group. This questions the robustness of any observed difference. 
According to one group of SAG experts, the data were insufficient to establish the benefit of Polivy+BR 
compared to BR, which furthermore is a suboptimal comparator. Adequate evidence should be submitted 
(pre-approval) to establish a benefit in the claimed indication. 
According to another group of SAG experts, at least a slight increase in terms of complete response rate 
compared to BR could be concluded, especially in patients with better prognosis. However, it is essential 
to confirm the size and duration of the effect in a larger population (post-approval).  
2. 
How do you view the safety profile of polatuzumab in the proposed indication? 
Given the unknown or assumed low contribution to efficacy of BR in the Polivy+BR combination, the 
unknown optimal treatment duration for any of the components, and the toxicity associated with the 
Polivy+BR combination, the safety profile is far from optimised. However, the toxicity is considered 
managable and does not exceed the toxicity of other regimens in this indication. It is also acknowledged 
that efficacy is the main objective in this situation and some patients may be willing to accept this level of 
toxicity, if efficacy was established.  
One concern with the long treatment duration with B is that it will likely decrease the possibility of 
successful apheresis in case CAR T cells became a possible option. This is important for the currently 
claimed indication that includes 2nd line (i.e., hampering possible later CAR T-cell use). 
3. 
What, if any, are the specific advantages in terms of efficacy, safety or convenience that 
polatuzumab vedotin would offer over available medicinal products indicated for the same or overlapping 
indications (Kymriah, Yescarta, Pixuvri, chemo-immunotherapy options)? 
There are no data to establish any specific advantages over available treatment options. It is 
acknowledged that CAR T cells, although they may not always be available due to health care systems' or 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019 
Page 125/159 
  
  
 
 
other decisions, have nevertheless longer follow-up (24 months and beyond, showing durable response, 
"plateau"), which is not available for Polivy+BR.  
There are no data to compare activity of Polivy+BR to other chemo-immunotherapy options directly. 
However, according to some SAG experts it can be assumed to be at best of a similar magnitude. Despite 
the lack of data, this group of experts agreed that in a population of transplant-ineligible, 
relapsed/refractory patients, if CAR T are not an option for whatever reason, and chemotherapy with 
platinum compounds are not indicated, e.g., due to neurotoxicity or other comorbidities, that there exists 
a "niche" of patients for whom there are no available treatment options and where the combination 
Polivy+BR could be a possible option.  
Other SAG experts disagreed, based on the fact that the benefit of the combination is currently unknown 
due to the fundamental methodological pitfalls (see answer to question No. 1), and that the efficacy or 
activity of Polivy in such "niche" population is unknown. 
4. 
For which patients might polatuzumab vedotin in combination with bendamustine and rituximab 
be the preferred therapy? 
The SAG agreed that preference is particularly difficult to predict based on the lack of robust data to 
speculate on indirect comparisons among the available options.  
Nevertheless, some SAG experts believed that some patients could benefit of treatment with the 
combination if there CAR T-cells or high-dose chemotherapy with aSCT or other schedules are not 
available or suitable options, e.g., because of frailty or neuropathy or in immunocompromised patients, 
although the lack of evidence of efficacy and safety in such population for whom all available options are 
unsuitable was acknowledged. However, Pola-BR might offer an additional therapy options for this patient 
population. 
Others disagreed and could not identify a suitable population due to the many deficiencies of the "pivotal" 
study and the uncertainties about the possible benefit (see above). 
The claim that Polivy+BR might be beneficial in case of rapidly progressive disease that is not amenable 
to CAR T-cell therapy because of the time lag between apheresis and CAR T-cell administration was not 
supported by the SAG. It is common practice that this can be managed using suitable conventional 
salvage "bridging" chemotherapy if needed, compatible with subsequent CAR T-cell treatment. 
Furthermore, the activity of Polivy+BR looked particularly weak in patients with poorer prognosis. 
5. 
What further data, if any, would be relevant, and might feasibly be generated in a pre- or 
post-marketing setting, to further characterise the efficacy and safety of polatuzumab-vedotin to support 
the proposed use? 
The SAG considered that the available evidence is extremely deficient as the main evidence comes from 
a small exploratory trial in a very heterogeneous population. As such, the results presented are far from 
robust or convincing. 
According to some SAG members, further data are needed to establish efficacy, ideally, with a 
randomised controlled trial in the claimed population. Such a study would need to be conducted in the 
pre-marketing setting. However, the situation is more complex because given the uncertainties about the 
contributions of BR in the combination, early clinical trials to study rational choices of backbone and 
treatment duration would also be needed before embarking in a confirmatory trial. The ongoing trial in 
first-line, using a different combination, is not informative for the applied indication. 
According to other SAG members, the proposed single-arm study is useful, especially if coupled with 
real-world data. The objective would be to confirm the response rate and response duration in a larger 
population and to determine the utilisation of the combination as well as to build a database to better 
explore any factors associated with a greater treatment effect and duration.

Further to issues raised at the SAG-O and per CHMP request, the applicant performed multivariate 
analysis for key efficacy endpoints including complete response (CR) at end of treatment (EoT) by IRC, 
best overall response (BOR) by IRC, progression free survival (PFS) by IRC and overall survival (OS). 
Such models, however suffer from limited degree of freedom in the parameter estimates when adjusting 
a large number of covariates simultaneously with relatively small size of each arm; the applicant 
performed also propensity score modelling, which preserves the power of detecting treatment effect while 
still balancing the baseline. 
The different analyses (adjusted or not) provided by the applicant to exploring the impact of imbalances 
of baseline prognostic covariates on the four endpoints: (CR at EoT, BOR, PFS and OS) lead to consistent 
point estimates across statistical models for a given endpoint and across endpoints in terms of clinical 
benefit. It has to be noticed that regarding CR and OS analyses, the full and backward multivariate 
adjustments on pronostic factors gives statistically non-significant results. However, the confidence 
intervals of point estimates provided by these models are asymetric around 1, in favor of a clear clinical 
benefit over a detrimental clinical effect, which is consistent with the study main outcomes. The CHMP 
considered that analyses provided to justify the absence of impact of imbalances of baseline prognostic 
covariates on the efficacy endpoints is sufficient taking into account the limitations of this study. 
Further, in order to understand the results in the context of the existing CAR-T therapies, a comparison of 
the populations investigated in the CAR-T pivotal studies and Study GO29365 was presented. Despite 
potential bias, the comparison of patients’ characteristics between studies ZUMA-1, JULIET and GO29365 
highlighted  that  patients  included  in  CAR-T  cells  studies  were  younger  (median  58,  56  and  67  years 
respectively), without ECOG 2 patients and stronger selection on baseline organ functions. Despite not 
quantified,  the  overlap  between  indications  concerns  TNE  patients  from  3L  treatment.  However,  this 
overlap remains partial since CAR-T therapies may not be suitable for patients in an urgent medical need, 
frailer patients not able to complete leukapheresis and conditioning and patients at higher risks of CSR. In 
addition,  access  to  polatuzumab  treatment  would  be  immediate,  while  CAR-T  therapies  require 
non-negligible  time  span  for  treatment  preparation,  leading  to  failure  in  treatment  access  for  a 
non-negligible proportion of patients in pivotal studies for CAR-T cells. It was also clarified that, despite 
limited data in 5 patients from the pivotal study GO29365, pola+BR treatment would not preclude for 
subsequent CAR-T therapy. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The evidence provided is based on a small exploratory trial in a limited size (82 patients in total received 
Polivy in trial GO29365; 40 patients from the randomized part arm C and 42 patients from arm G using 
the lyophilised formulation) and heterogeneous population in terms of prognosis. Available data are thus 
considered non-comprehensive and additional data are needed in order to confirm the size and duration 
of the effect in a larger population and render the data set comprehensive. For this reason, the CHMP 
considered that a full marketing authorisation could not be granted, but in light of the promising results, 
the CHMP was of the view that a conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) should be considered. 
In order to confirm the benefit/risk, the primary CSR for study GO29365 including the primary analysis of 
Arm H (n=64) as well as a pooled analysis of Arm G (n=42) and Arm H (n=64) will be provided. Distinct 
histology subtypes will be analysed within Arm H which is considered necessary to confirm response in 
any relevant subtype at least on a descriptive level.  
Furthermore, the results of Study GO39942, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that 
evaluates polatuzumab vedotin in combination with R-CHP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
prednisone) versus R-CHOP in patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma should be 
provided. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival. Key secondary endpoints include complete 
remission rate per independent review committee and overall survival. Although this study is an earlier 
Assessment report

line of treatment the CHMP considered that data from this randomized trial with a different backbone 
combination will be important to confirm the efficacy and safety of Polivy. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the results of GO29365 study, it is concluded that Pola+BR is significantly more effective as the 
chosen standard of care BR regimen in the treatment of R/R DLBCL patients. An improvement in CRs 
(40% for pola+BR vs 17.5% for BR), a clinically meaningful improvement in PFS (7.6 months vs. 2.0 
months) and a survival benefit (12.4 months for pola+BR vs 4.7 months for BR) have been observed.  
However the evidence provided is based on a small exploratory trial in a very heterogeneous population 
in terms of prognosis. Available data are thus considered non-comprehensive and a full marketing 
authorisation is therefore not considered appropriate. Additional data are needed in order to confirm the 
size and duration of the effect in a larger population. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context 
of a conditional MA: 
- 
In order to further confirm the safety and efficacy of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with BR 
the MAH will provide the primary CSR for study GO29365 including the primary analysis of Arm H 
(n=64) as well as a pooled analysis of Arm G (n=42) and Arm H (n=64).  
- 
In order to further confirm the safety and efficacy of polatuzumab vedotin in DLBCL the MAH will 
also provide Study GO39942, a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial that evaluates 
polatuzumab vedotin in combination with R-CHP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
prednisone) versus R-CHOP in patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Clinical  safety  data  for  polatuzumab  vedotin  1.8  mg/kg  and  other  dose  levels  as  a  single  agent  or  in 
combination treatment were collected from the pivotal Study GO29365 in R/R DLBCL and R/R FL, and 
three key supportive studies.  
Pivotal Study GO29365 and the three key supportive Studies GO27834, GO29044, and DCS4968g were 
conducted with 100 mg liquid drug product (DP). Three additional ongoing supportive studies (GO29833, 
GO29834,  and  BO29561)  are  conducted  using  170  mg  lyophilized  (lyo)  DP  filled  from  v1.0  DS 
(polatuzumab vedotin Phase III material that will be used for commercialization). An additional cohort 
(Arm G) in Study GO29365 is using 140 mg lyo DP filled from v1.0 DS. Safety data from these additional 
studies and cohort, with lyo DP, were also provided. 
This overview provides detailed data mainly from the pivotal study GO29365 including updated data from 
arm G. With the responses to the D90 LoQ updated data from arm G have been provided (cut-off date 
March 2019).  
Patient exposure 
Overall, 588 patients received at least one dose of polatuzumab vedotin as single agent or in combination 
regimen. Among these patients, 383 patients received polatuzumab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg dose. 
The period for AEs collection was shorter in supportive studies GO27834 and DCS4968g (up to 30 days 
after last administration) than in the pivotal study and the supportive study GO29044 (up to 90 days after 
the last administration)  
Treatment  duration  in  the  pivotal  study  was  limited  to  6  cycles,  as  per  to  the  study  protocol,  while 
exposure was longer in most of the supportive studies. Consequently, the median total cumulative dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019 
Page 128/159 
  
  
 
 
was higher in supportive studies. Of note, it was 724 mg in study GO29365, all arms included, vs 1015.6 
mg in study GO27834 in pooled pola 1.8 mg/kg arms (R/G combined, all histologies).  
In the ongoing arm G of the pivotal study (with lyo form), patients received 6x21-day cycles, during which 
a total of 6 doses of polatuzumab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg), 12 doses of bendamustine (90 mg/m2), and 6 
doses of rituximab (375 mg/m2). At time of interim report, the 25 patients included in the safety analysis 
had completed a median of 3 cycles.  
The 3 additional supportive studies (with 170mg lyo DP) are ongoing, with alternative combinations. The 
median number of doses received was lower, with lower cumulative dose consequently.  
In the pivotal study, comparing DLBCL patients treated with pola 1.8 mg/kg +BR (n=45 in phase Ib+ 
phase II) vs BR (n=39 in phase II), AEs reported in ≥ 20% of patients in any group were anaemia (46.7% 
vs. 25.6%), neutropenia (46.7% vs. 38.5%), thrombocytopenia (46.7% vs. 28.2%), fatigue (40.0% vs. 
35.9%),  diarrhoea  (37.8%  vs.  28.2%),  nausea  (33.3%  vs.  41.0%),  pyrexia  (33.3%  vs.  23.1%), 
decreased appetite (26.7% vs. 20.5%), neuropathy peripheral (20.0% vs. 2.6%), constipation (17.8% 
vs. 20.5%), and cough (15.6% vs. 20.5%). 
Moreover, lymphopenia was observed in 11.1% in pola+BR, and pancytopenia in 6.7%, vs none in the BR 
group. A higher frequency of PN events is observed in the pola+BR group (> 10% increase), mainly with 
peripheral sensory neuropathy (13.3% vs 0) and PN (20.0% vs 2.6%). 
When  compared  to  the  FL  group  in  the  pivotal  study,  the  safety  profile  of  the  pola  +BR  is  broadly 
comparable.  When  associated  with  BG  in  the  pivotal  study,  all  histologies,  the  safety  profile  remains 
stable, despite a higher frequency of the following AEs: fatigue (42.7% vs 57.7% in pola+BG), diarrhoea 
(39.3  vs  57.7%),  nausea  (44.9  vs  57.7%)  constipation  (23.6  vs  42.3%),  vomiting  (19.1  vs  42.3%), 
dyspnoea (10.1 vs 32.7%) and back pain (5.6 vs 15.4%). 
A similar profile was observed in safety population of arm G in study GO29365, with 140 lyo DP pola +BR. 
The updated data provided with the responses to the D90 LoQ confirmed these results. 
Considering AEs in the supportive study GO27834, the safety profile is similar. Between doses of 1.8 
mg/kg and 2.4 mg/kg of pola, in comparable groups (pola +R in FL patients), similar AEs were reported, 
expect for a higher frequency in the 2.4 +R group (≥20%) in diarrhoea (30.0 vs 55.0%), PN (30.0 vs 
65.0%), asthenia (0 vs 35.0%), and oedema peripheral (15.0 vs 35.0%). 
When  pola  1.8  is  combined  to  R/G-CHP  in  the  supportive  frontline  study  GO29044,  similar  AEs  are 
reported. It should be noted that febrile neutropenia was reported in 17.4% of the patients (pola 1.8 
+R/G –CHP, all histologies). 
In  study  DCS4968g,  in  patients  treated  with  SA  pola  1.8  mg/kg  (n=11)  and  2.4  mg/kg  (n=45),  no 
unexpected AE nor increased AE frequency was observed in the 2.4 mg/kg group.

Adverse Events of Grade ≥3 
In the pivotal study, while comparing DLBCL patients treated with pola 1.8 mg/kg +BR (n=45) vs BR 
(n=39 in phase II), the frequency of grade 3-4 events was higher in the pola+BR arm (84.4% vs 71.8%).  
The most frequently reported SOCs (occurring in ≥ 20% of patients in any group) for the pola+BR and BR 
groups  were  Blood  and  Lymphatic  System  Disorders  (64.4%  vs.  56.4%),  Infection  and  Infestations 
(24.4% vs. 20.5%), and Gastrointestinal Disorders (22.2% vs. 12.8%).  
The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 events (occurring in ≥10% of patients in any group) for the 
pola+BR and BR groups were neutropenia (40.0% vs. 33.3%), thrombocytopenia (37.8% vs. 23.1%), 
anemia (24.4% vs. 17.9%), febrile neutropenia (11.1% vs. 12.8%), and lymphopenia (11.1% vs. 0), 
which were all under SOC Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders.  
At  SOC  level,  grade  3-4  AEs  were  more  frequent  (>10%  higher)  in  pola  +BR  arms  in  SOC    vascular 
disorders (11.1% vs 0). At PT level, the following grade 3/ 4 AEs were more frequent in pola+BR arm (> 
5% higher): neutropenia (40.0 vs 33.3%), thrombocytopenia (37.8 vs 23.1%) anemia (24.4 vs 17.9%) 
lymphopenia (11.1% vs 0) and pneumonia (6.7% vs 0). 
A similar trend was observed in FL patients treated with pola+BR vs BR in the pivotal study. However, in 
FL patients, the SOC infections and infestations was more frequently reported in the pola+BR arm (31.8 
vs 7.3%).  
A similar safety profile was observed in the 25 patients included in arm G of the pivotal study, treated with 
the 140 lyo DP. 
In the supportive study GO27834, similar trends in the reporting of grade 3-4 AEs was observed between 
pola  1.8  and  2.4  mg/kg  groups  (+R/G,  all  histologies).  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  grade  3-4 
frequency was higher in 2.4 mg/kg +R DLBCL patients: 76.9% vs 53.8% in the 1.8 mg/kg pooled groups. 
This higher reporting of grade 3/ 4 AEs in the 2.4 mg/kg DLBCL patients was driven by the following 
SOCs: investigations (5.8 vs 15.4%), general disorders (2.9 vs 15.4%) and nervous system disorders 
(2.9 vs 15.4%).  
A similar trend was observed in the supportive study GO29044, with 63.0% of incidence of Grade 3 or 4 
AEs  in  Pola+R-CHP  in  1L  DLBCL  or  mixed  (1L  or  R/R)  other  B-cell  NHL  (N=46),  and  65.2%  in 
Pola+R/G-CHP all histologies (N=69). 
In the supportive study DCS4968g, despite differences in population size, similar trends in the reporting 
of grade 3-4 AEs were observed between both doses in SA arms (all histologies pooled), pola 1.8mg/kg 
and 2.4mg/kg.

AEs of special interest 
Table 56: Adverse Events of Particular Interest and Search Definitions Used 
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia events observed in pola+BR vs BR DLBCL arms were: all grades (60.0 vs 53.8%) and grade 
3/ 4 (55.6 vs 46.2%).  The incidence of febrile neutropenia was also comparable (11.1% vs. 12.8%). 
Almost all neutropenia events were grade 3/ 4 in both arms. Neutropenia AEs led to study withdrawal and 
pola discontinuation (8.9% of patients each). All neutropenia AE resolved in the pola+BR arm.  
Peripheral Neuropathy (PN) 
In the pivotal study, PN events were more frequent in pola+BR arm (40.0% vs 7.7% in BR arm). None 
was fatal, serious nor led to study withdrawal. All events were Grade 1 or 2 in both arms. In pola+BR arm, 
the main reported PTs were neuropathy peripheral (9 patients) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (6 
patients). Most events (11/18) resolved in the pola+BR group, despite 7 unresolved events, mainly grade 
1. The median TTO was 1.4 months for the pola+BR group.  
In the supportive study GO27834, the longer median treatment exposure (up to 13.5 cycles in pola 1.8 
mg/kg+R group) correlated with the higher incidence and severity of PN events. In study DCS4968g, the 
frequency increased with higher dose of pola (up to 2.4 mg/kg) and longer treatment (over 8 cycles).  
Infections 
Infections, including pneumonia and other types of infections, were reported in 53.3% of patients in the 
Polivy plus BR arm and 51.3% of patients in the BR arm. In the Polivy plus BR arm, serious infections were 
reported  in  28.9%  of  patients  and  fatal  infections  were  reported  in  8.9% of  patients.  In  the  BR  arm, 
serious  infections  were  reported  in  30.8%  of  patients  and  fatal  infections  were  reported  in  10.3%  of 
patients. One patient (2.2%) in the Polivy plus BR arm discontinued treatment due to infection compared 
to 5.1% of patients in the BR arm. 
The incidence of infectious events was similar in pola+BR and BR DLBCL arms (53.3 vs 51.3%), and most 
events were Grade ≥ 3 in both groups in the pivotal study. The incidence of serious infections events was 
also  comparable  between  both  arms  (28.9%  vs.  30.8%).  In  the  pola+BR  group,  4  patients  (8.9%) 
experienced fatal events, including pneumonia (2), meningoencephalitis herpetic (1), and sepsis (1). In 
the BR group, 4 patients (10.3%) experienced fatal events, including sepsis (2), pneumonia (1), and 
septic shock (1).  
Six (6) opportunistic infections were reported in 4 patients (8.9%) in pola+BR arm: herpetic encephalitis 
(1 patient), cerebral toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and pneumonia (in the same patient), CMV 
infection (reported twice in the same patient), and pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) (1 patient). 
Assessment report

Page 134/159 
  
  
 
 
 
Three of these patients died due to opportunistic infection. In the BR group, opportunistic infections were 
reported in 2 patients: CMV infection and pulmonary mycosis. 
In pola+BR arms, one out of the 4 fatal infectious related to pola: meningoencephalitis herpetic, occurred 
in the follow up period. The incidence of infections was similar between the treatment arms (or even 
slightly higher in the BR arm). The review of potential cases of viral reactivation under SOC Infections and 
Infestations in the pola+BR arm of the DLBCL patient population retrieved 9 AEs, including 4 assessed as 
related to pola+BR regimen: Herpes infection and fatal meningoencephalitis in one patient, (previously 
discussed), one non-serious  case  of  CMV  infection,  at  D43,  and  one non-serious  case of  herpes  virus 
infection, at D 48.  
Hepatic toxicity:  
The incidence of hepatic toxicity was higher in pola+BR vs BR DLBCL arm (20.0 vs 12.8%). The majority 
of events were grade 1-2 severity in both arms, and most events resolved (6/9) in the pola+BR arm. The 
median TTO was 1.4 month in the pola+BR arm. 
In  the  pola+BR  arm,  the  most  frequently  reported  PT  was  hypoalbuminaemia  (13.3%;  6  patients), 
followed by AST increased (4.4%; 2 patients). There were no cases of drug-induced liver injury as defined 
by Hy’s Law.  
Across supportive studies, grade 3/ 4 hepatic toxicities were reported in two patients in study GO27834 
with pola 2.4 mg/kg, including one grade 4 hepatocellular injury and one grade 4 hepatic steatosis and 
hepatomegaly,  assessed  as  treatment  related  and  serious,  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  and 
resolved.  
Anaemia  
In the pivotal study, the incidence of anemia was higher in pola+BR vs BR DLBCL arm (46.7 vs 28.2%). 
The  majority  of  events  were  non  serious  in  both  arms.  However,  RBC  transfusion  was  comparable 
between both arms (20.0% vs. 17.9%). Limited impact on treatment was reported. The median TTO was 
2.3 and 0.1 month for the pola+BR and BR groups.   
A similar safety profile was observed in arm G regarding anemia, as well as in supportive studies. 
Thrombocytopenia 
In the pivotal study, the incidence of thrombocytopenia was higher in pola+BR vs BR DLBCL arm (48.9 vs 
33.3%). The majority of events were grade 3/ 4 events, none fatal. Two patients (4.4%) in pola+BR 
group and 1 patient (2.6%) in BR group experienced serious thrombocytopenia. Platelet transfusion were 
comparable between the pola+BR and BR groups (8.9% vs. 12.8%). 
In  the  pola+BR  group,  1  patient  presented  a  bleeding  event  (Grade  5  hemoptysis),  in  the  context  of 
anticoagulation therapy due to thromboembolic event (pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis). 
The patient presented with an extranodal lesion in lung at baseline  
Thrombocytopenia  events  led  to  pola  discontinuation  in  5  patients  (11.1%),  and  dose  delay  or 
interruption of polatuzumab vedotin in 6 patients (13.3%).  
The median TTO was 1.4 and 0.7 months for the pola+BR and BR groups. Most patients (81.8%; 18/22 
vs.  46.2%;  6/13)  had  the  thrombocytopenia  events  resolved  in  both  groups,  with  median  time  to 
resolution of 0.5 and 0.3 month for the pola+BR and BR groups, respectively. 
No further safety signal regarding thrombocytopenia was identified in arm G and in supportive studies.

8.9% of patients in the Polivy plus BR arm discontinued Polivy due to neutropenia compared to 2.6% of 
patients in the BR arm who discontinued treatment due to neutropenia. Thrombocytopenia events led to 
discontinuation of treatment in 11.1% of patients in the Polivy plus BR arm and 5.1% of patients in the BR 
arm. No patients discontinued treatment due to anaemia in either the Polivy plus BR arm or BR arm. 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
One case of PML, which was fatal, occurred in one FL patient treated with Polivy plus bendamustine and 
obinutuzumab. This patient had three prior lines of therapy that included anti-CD20 antibodies. 
Gastrointestinal toxicity 
Gastrointestinal toxicity events were reported in 80.0% of patients in the Polivy plus BR arm compared to 
64.1% of patients in the BR arm. Most events were Grade 1-2, and Grade 3-4 events were reported in 
22.2% of patients in the Polivy plus BR arm compared to 12.8% of patients in the BR arm. The most 
common gastrointestinal toxicity events were diarrhoea and nausea. 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from the polatuzumab vedotin, bendamustine, and rituximab combination 
treatment  were  identified  based  on  the  interim  data  analyses  from  Study  GO29365  (the  AEs  by  PTs 
reported in ≥ 10% of patients) in the pola+BR arm

Arm G 
Table 59: Serious Adverse Events Reported in More than One Patient (Safety Population) 
In study GO27834, 35.9% of patients presented with at least 1 SAE in DLBCL pola 2.4+R group. In this 
study, AE reporting period was twice shorter than in the pivotal study. SAEs frequencies were similar 
between treatment groups and coherent with SAEs reported in the pivotal study.  
In study GO29044, the frequency of SAEs remains lower than in the pivotal study, reported in 40.6% of 
patients  in  the  pola  8mg/kg  +R/G–CHP  group,  all  histologies.  This  study  includes  untreated  DLBCL 
patients,  while  the  pivotal  study  included  heavily  pre-treated  R/R  patients.  The  main  reported  SOCs 
remain unchanged. However, it should be noted that 2 SAEs of atrial fibrillation were reported in pola 1.8 
+R-CHP arm, all histologies. 
In study DCS4968g, no significant difference in SAEs reporting or safety signal was observed across all 
histologies groups. No signal was identified while increasing dose of pola SA in DLBCL arms (<1.8 mg/kg, 
1.8 mg/kg and 2.4 mg/kg). The majority of related SAEs was Grade 3 (38.8% vs 66.6%) followed by 
Grade  4  (27.7%  vs  20.0%)  and  Grade  5  (16.6%  vs  13.3%).  The  most  common  SAEs  by  SOC  were 
Infections and infestations and Blood and lymphatic system disorders for both treatment arms. 
Deaths 
In the pivotal study, 9 fatal AEs were reported in pola+BR patients (n=39), including two assessed as 
related to pola +BR: One case of meningoencephalitis herpetic, in a 72 years old female patient who 
completed 6 cycles of study treatment; 1 case of pulmonary oedema, in a 56 years old male patient; One 
of the 11 fatal AEs reported in the comparative BR arm was assessed as related to study drug, with a fatal 
septic shock at D114 during treatment period. Among pola +BG R/R DLBCL patients (N=26 in phase Ib + 
II), 5 fatal AEs were reported, including 1 MDS in a 67 years male patient - assessed as related to pola and 
bendamustine.  
Among FL patients (n=99), 7 fatal AEs were reported, including 2 in BR patients (n=41), 3 in pola+BR 
patients (n=38) and 2 in pola+BG (n=20). None was assessed as related to study drug in BR arm, 1 AE 
of death of related to pola+BR, and 1 AE of questionable PML was assessed as related to pola+BG. 
In arm G (pola 140 lyo DP +BR) of the pivotal study, 3 patients died due to AEs. The three patient deaths 
reported due to AEs included 2 patients with Grade 5 AEs of sepsis, and 1 patient with an unspecified 
Grade 5 AE that was amended to progressive disease after the CCOD.

Laboratory findings 
In DLBCL pola+BR group in the pivotal study (n=45), the most frequent grade 3/ 4 shifts from baseline 
concerned  decrease  in  lymphocytes  (95.6%),  neutrophils  (51.1%)  and  platelets  (31.1%).  Based  on 
previous discussion on AEPIs and MOA, this is not unexpected. 
Increase in uric acid was observed in 26.7% of the patients in DLBCL pola+BR group. Grade 3-4 decrease 
inpotassium was also reported in 5 patients (11.1%, vs 5.1% in BR arm). Of note, 1 patient presented 
with grade 1 atrial fibrillation in DLBCL pola+BR arm. There were 5 patients in the BR arm who reported 
arrhythmias. No further event in cardiac arrhythmia SMQ was reported.  
Similar trends were observed in supportive studies, without new safety signal identified from laboratory 
findings. 
In the pivotal study GO29365, there was no clinical meaningful change from  baseline throughout the 
course of treatment for diastolic or systolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, or patient weight 
in any treatment groups. Vital signs data were not summarized in the three main supportive studies, but 
captured by AEs. 
No new safety signal was identified on ECG abnormalities and vital signs. 
Further discussion on the risk of hypogammaglobulinemia was provided.  
Laboratory findings were similar in arm G. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety profile was similar between male and female across groups, as well as between younger and older 
patients (< 65 and ≥65 years). 
No significant difference was identified across subgroups with baseline hepatic function normal, mild 1, 2 
or moderate. Regarding baseline renal function, the global safety profile remained comparable between 
baseline normal, mild or moderate function. However, in pola +BR DLBCL arm, the frequency of grade 3- 
4 events increase from 78.9% in patients with normal renal function, to 87.5% in mild impairment and 
90.0% in moderate impairment patients. A similar trend is observed in thrombocytopenia events, from 
42.1% to 62.5 % in patients with mild renal function impairment. 
Similar observations were raised from the three main supportive studies, mainly regarding gender and 
age groups. No meaningful difference in the safety profile was identified between groups with normal 
hepatic  function,  mild  or  moderate  impairment.  However,  across  the  pivotal  and  supportive  studies, 
despite  small  populations  and  differences  in  baseline,  renal  impairment  is  associated  with  a  higher 
incidence of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, delay or dose reduction in the pivotal study and 
supportive studies GO27834 and GO29044. 
No significant difference was observed across studies between regions. 
No studies of polatuzumab vedotin have been conducted in pregnant women, and to date no pregnancies 
were reported in the studies included in this summary document.

N/A 
In  Study  GO29365,  the 
incidence  of  treatment-emergent  (sum  of  treatment-induced  and 
treatment-enhanced) anti-drug antibody (ADA) was 6.0% (8 of 134 ADA evaluable patients). Baseline 
prevalence of ADAs was 3.7% (5 of 134 ADA evaluable patients). All 5 patients with a positive ADA result 
at baseline were treatment unaffected (a post-baseline evaluable patient with a positive ADA result at 
baseline and [a] where all post baseline titre results are less than 0.60 t.u. greater than the baseline titre 
result, OR [b] where all post-baseline results are negative or missing). 
There were no events of immunogenicity reported in arm G at the data cut-off date. 
To date, across all patients including Study GO29365 and six supportive studies (three main supportive 
studies GO27834, GO29044, DCS4968g, and additional GO29833, GO29834, and BO29561 studies), the 
post-baseline ADA incidence was 2.6% (14 of 536 ADA evaluable patients). Baseline prevalence of ADAs 
was  2.4%  (13  of  545  ADA  evaluable  patients),  of  which,  11  baseline  ADA-positive  patients  were 
treatment unaffected.  
No identifiable relationship between an ADA response and reported AEs was observed. However, due to 
the limited number of anti-polatuzumab vedotin antibody positive patients to date, no conclusions can be 
drawn concerning a potential effect of immunogenicity on safety at this time.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No clinical data on DDI are included in the submission (see discussion on Clinical Safety). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In  the  pivotal  study,  26.7%  of  patients  in  the  pola+BR  DLBCL  arm  had  an  AE  leading  to  pola 
discontinuation, driven by thrombocytopenia (8.9%) and neutropenia (6.7%). Overall, the profile of AEs 
that  led  to  treatment  discontinuation  of  pola  was  similar  between  the  pola+BR  and  pola+BG  groups, 
despite a higher frequency of infections AEs leading to pola discontinuation in pola+BG groups.  
In the supportive study GO27834, AEs leading to pola discontinuation concerned 19.2% of patients in the 
pola 1.8 +R/G all histologies group (n=104), driven by different AEs than in the pivotal study: peripheral 
sensory neuropathy (5.8%) and neutropenia (4.8%). A similar trend was observed in the pola 2.4 +R 
DLBCL group, despite a higher frequency of AEs leading to pola discontinuation (30.7%). 
In the supportive study GO29044, in Pola-R-CHP arm, the incidence of AEs that led to discontinuation of 
pola was 8.7%, driven by the Nervous System Disorders SOC (6.5%; 3 patients). All events were each 
reported in a single patient (2.2%). No AEs led to pola discontinuation in groups at lower doses (n=6 in 
each group). 
In the supportive study DCS4968g, a progressive increase in AEs leading to pola discontinuation was 
observed with increased dose across all histologies groups, with 23.3%, 36.4% and 51.1% with pola SA 
<1.8 mg/kg, 1.8 mg/kg and 2.4 mg/kg respectively.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Clinical safety data were collected from the pivotal study and three key supportive studies, all conducted 
with the 100 mg liquid drug product (DP). Moreover, updated safety data from arm G of the pivotal study, 
using  140 mg  lyophilized  DP,  were  provided,  as  well  as  safety  data  from  three  additional  supportive 
studies conducted with the 170 mg lyo DP. 
In DLBCL patients in the pivotal study, comparing pola 1.8 mg/kg (safety analysis population, n=45 in 
phase Ib+phase II) vs BR (n=39 in phase II), almost all patients presented with AEs (100.0% vs 97.4%). 
A higher proportion of patients in the pola+BR arm presented with grade 3/4 AEs (84.4% vs 71.8%) and 
AEs leading to study withdrawal (33.3% vs 23.1%).  
Most  of  AEs  of  particular  interest  (AEPIs)  were  more  frequent  in  the  in  pola+BR  arm,  including 
neutropenia (60.0% vs 53.8%), PN (40.0 vs 7.7%), thrombocytopenia (48.9 vs 33.3%) and anaemia 
(46.7 vs 28.2%).  
Across all studies, in pola 1.8 groups, and arm G of the pivotal study the safety profile was similar despite 
differences in exposure, combination, histologies and AEs reporting periods. 
In the pivotal study, AEs reported in ≥ 20% of patients in any group (pola +BR vs BR) were anaemia 
(46.7%  vs.  25.6%),  neutropenia  (46.7%  vs.  38.5%),  thrombocytopenia  (46.7%  vs.  28.2%),  fatigue 
(40.0%  vs.  35.9%),  diarrhoea  (37.8%  vs.  28.2%),  nausea  (33.3%  vs.  41.0%),  pyrexia  (33.3%  vs. 
23.1%), decreased appetite (26.7% vs. 20.5%), neuropathy peripheral (20.0% vs. 2.6%), constipation 
(17.8% vs. 20.5%), and cough (15.6% vs. 20.5%). A similar profile was observed in safety population of 
arm  G  in  study  GO29365,  with  140  lyo  DP  +BR.  The  most  frequently  reported  Grade  3  or  4  events

(occurring in ≥10% of patients in any group) for the pola+BR and BR groups were neutropenia (40.0% 
vs.  33.3%),  thrombocytopenia  (37.8%  vs.  23.1%),  anaemia  (24.4%  vs.  17.9%),  febrile  neutropenia 
(11.1% vs. 12.8%), and lymphopenia (11.1% vs. 0).  
The most frequently reported (≥ 30%) ADRs in patients treated with Polivy in combination with BR were 
anaemia  (46.7%),  thrombocytopenia  (46.7%),  neutropenia  (46.7%),  fatigue  (40.0%),  diarrhoea 
(37.8%),  nausea  (33.3%),  and  pyrexia  (33.3%).  Serious  adverse  reactions  were  reported  in  27%  of 
Polivy  plus  BR  treated  patients,  which  includes  febrile  neutropenia  (6.7%),  pyrexia  (4.4%),  and 
pneumonia (4.4%). 
ADRs leading to treatment regimen discontinuation in >5% of patients were thrombocytopenia (8.9%) 
and neutropenia (6.7%). 
In the supportive study GO27834, a higher frequency of the following AEs was observed in the 2.4 mg/kg 
+R group (≥20%), vs 1.8 mg/kg group: diarrhoea (30.0 vs 55.0%), PN (30.0 vs 65.0%), asthenia (0 vs 
35.0%), and oedema peripheral (15.0 vs 35.0%). 
When focussed on very common (≥10%) and common related AEs in the pivotal study, the safety profile 
in  ADR  is  similar  to  previously  discussed  AEs.  ADRs  of  lower  frequencies  were  not  detectable,  due to 
limited sample size. 
In the pivotal study, while comparing pola+BR vs BR in DLBCL, no significant increase in SAEs frequency 
was observed (64.4% vs 61.5%), driven by Infections and Infestations SOC, blood and lymphatic system 
disorders and gastrointestinal disorders. SAEs profile was similar in arm G of the pivotal study, with 140 
lyo DP+BR. Across main studies, no unexpected safety signal was observed in SAEs with pola. No new 
safety signal was identified across updated safety results from arm G. 
No new safety signal was identified on ECG abnormalities and vital signs. 
Related fatal AEs in polatuzumab containing arms were only reported in the pivotal study. No difference 
in safety profile was evidenced between liquid and lyophilized forms (arm G). It should be noted that 4 out 
of 5 fatal AEs were infectious, including 3 occurred early during treatment. Infectious risk is expected with 
polatuzumab vedotin, considering its MOA and the haematologic toxicity. The respective information has 
been included in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. In pola+BR arms, one out of the 4 fatal infectious was 
assessed as related to pola: meningoencephalitis herpetic, occurred in the follow up period. The incidence 
of infections was similar between the treatment arms (or even slightly higher in the BR arm). The review 
of potential cases of viral reactivation under SOC Infections and Infestations in the pola+BR arm of the 
DLBCL patient population retrieved 9 AEs, including 4 assessed as related to pola+BR regimen: Herpes 
infection and fatal meningoencephalitis in one patient, (previously discussed), one non-serious case of 
CMV infection, at D43, and one non-serious case of herpes virus infection, at D 48. No unexpected safety 
signal was raised from these infectious cases. The SmPC reflects the relevant information.  
In the pivotal study, the incidence of infectious events was similar in both arms (53.3 vs 51.3%), as well 
as  serious  infections  (28.9%  vs.  30.8%).  In  the  pola+BR  group,  4  patients  (8.9%)  experienced  fatal 
events, including pneumonia (2), meningoencephalitis herpetic (1), and sepsis (1). In the BR group, 4 
patients (10.3%) experienced fatal events, including sepsis (2), pneumonia (1), and septic shock (1). Six 
(6) opportunistic infections were reported in 4 patients (8.9%) in pola+BR arm: herpetic encephalitis (1 
patient),  cerebral  toxoplasmosis,  cytomegalovirus  (CMV),  and  pneumonia  (in  the  same  patient),  CMV 
infection (reported twice in the same patient), and pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) (1 patient).  
The fatal case of MDS occurred 2 years after study start, in a heavily pre-treated patient; however, this 
case  of  second  primary  malignancy  is  of  concern  and  the  risk  of  carcinogenicity  remains  closely 
monitored, as part of the important potential risks for pola.

Despite questionable based on Mentzer criteria, the case of PML is of concern. A warning has been added 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC that patients should be monitored closely for new or worsening neurological, 
cognitive, or behavioural changes suggestive of PML. Polivy and any concomitant chemotherapy should 
be withheld if PML is suspected and permanently discontinued if the diagnosis is confirmed. 
In the pivotal study, a higher frequency of neutropenia events was observed in pola+BR vs BR DLBCL 
arms,  all  grades  (60.0  vs  53.8%).  Almost  all  neutropenia  events  were  grade  3/  4  in  both  arms. 
Neutropenia AEs had a non-negligible impact on the polatuzumab treatment, leading to study withdrawal 
and pola discontinuation (8.9% of patients each). All neutropenia AE resolved in the pola+BR arm. A 
warning has been added in section 4.4 of the SmPC that complete blood counts should be monitored prior 
to each dose of Polivy. More frequent lab monitoring and/or Polivy delays or discontinuation should be 
considered for patients with Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.2).  
In the pivotal study, PN events were more frequent in pola+BR arm (40.0% vs 7.7% in BR arm). None 
was fatal, serious nor led to study withdrawal. All events were Grade 1 or 2 in both arms. In pola+BR arm, 
PN  events  were  mainly  neuropathy  peripheral  (9  patients)  and  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (6 
patients). In the supportive study GO27834, TTO for grade ≥2 PN events was longer, up to 4.21 months. 
Overall,  the  longer  median  treatment  exposure  in  this  study  (up  to  13.5  cycles  in  pola  1.8  mg/kg+R 
group) correlated with the higher incidence and severity of PN events. In study DCS4968g, the frequency 
increased  with  higher  dose  of  pola  (up  to  2.4  mg/kg)  and  longer  treatment  (over  8  cycles).  This 
observation strengthens the limitation of pola treatment to 6 cycles, at 1.8 mg/kg. A warning has been 
added  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  that  patients  should  be  monitored  for  symptoms  of  PN  such  as 
hypoesthesia,  hyperesthesia,  paraesthesia,  dysesthesia,  neuropathic  pain,  burning  sensation,  muscle 
weakness, or gait disturbance. Patients experiencing new or worsening PN may require a delay, dose 
reduction, or discontinuation of Polivy (see section 4.2). 
In the pivotal study, the incidence of hepatic toxicity was higher in pola+BR vs BR DLBCL arm (20.0 vs 
12.8%). The majority of events were grade 1-2 severity in both arms, and most events resolved (6/9) in 
the pola+BR arm. In the pola+BR arm, the most frequently reported PT was hypoalbuminaemia (13.3%; 
6 patients), followed by AST increased (4.4%; 2 patients). There were no cases of drug-induced liver 
injury as defined by Hy’s Law. No hepatic event led to discontinuation or modification of pola treatment.  
The hepatic safety profile was similar across R/G and DLBCL/FL groups, and also in arm G of the study, 
despite a higher reporting in blood alkaline phosphatase increased (3/7 concerned patients) in arm G. 
Across supportive studies, grade 3/ 4 hepatic toxicities were reported in study GO27834 with pola a 2.4 
mg/kg, including one grade 4 hepatocellular injury and one grade 4 hepatic steatosis and hepatomegaly, 
assessed as treatment related, leading to treatment discontinuation and resolved.  
No significant difference was identified across subgroups with baseline hepatic function normal, mild 1, 2 
or  moderate.  The  administration  of  Polivy  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  hepatic  impairment 
(bilirubin greater than 1.5 × ULN) should be avoided.  No adjustment in the starting dose is required when 
administering Polivy to patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin greater than ULN to less than or 
equal to 1.5 × ULN or AST greater than ULN).  
In the pivotal study, the incidence of anaemia was higher in pola+BR vs BR DLBCL arm (46.7 vs 28.2%). 
The majority of events were non serious in both arms.  
In the pivotal study, the incidence of thrombocytopenia was higher in pola+BR vs BR DLBCL arm (48.9 vs 
33.3%). The majority of events were grade 3/ 4 events, none fatal. Thrombocytopenia events had an 
impact on treatment course in the pola+BR group, with pola discontinuation in 5 patients (11.1%), and 
dose  delay  or  interruption  of  polatuzumab  vedotin  in  6  patients  (13.3%).  No  further  safety  signal 
regarding thrombocytopenia was identified in arm G and in supportive studies.

In  the  pola+BR  group,  1  patient  presented  a  bleeding  event  (Grade  5  hemoptysis),  in  the  context  of 
anticoagulation therapy due to thromboembolic event (pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis).  
Three additional supportive studies provided preliminary safety data with lyophilized form of pola (170 
mg form, dosage not intended for marketing). To date, these ongoing studies provide data in limited 
population,  in  R/R  DLBCL  and  R/R  FL  patients  with  combinations  different  from  the  target  indication. 
Moreover, due to dose-escalation designs, few patients in each study were treated with pola at 1.8mg/kg. 
Based on these data, the safety profile of pola 170mg lyo DP was coherent with the safety profile for the 
liquid formulation. Except for immune-mediated toxicities while associating pola +R/G+atezo, which led 
to enrollment halt in study BO29561, no further new safety signal was identified. It should anyway be 
noted  that  a  higher  incidence  of  IRR  was  reported  in  these  studies,  mainly  considered  related  to 
obinutuzumab  treatment.  A  relevant  warning  on  IRR  has  been  included  in  the  SmPC  as  well  as 
instructions for dose modifications (see SmPC section 4.4.). 
Globally,  the  safety  profile  was  similar  between  male  and  female  across  studies,  as  well  as  between 
younger and older patients (< 65 and ≥65 years).  
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment with 
polatuzumab vedotin and for at least 9 months after the last dose. 
Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective 
contraception during treatment with polatuzumab vedotin and for at least 6 months after the last dose. 
There are no data in pregnant women using Polivy. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity 
(see non – clinical section). Based on the mechanism of action and nonclinical studies, polatuzumab 
vedotin can be harmful to the foetus when administered to a pregnant woman.  In women of childbearing 
potential, the pregnancy status shall be checked prior to treatment.  Polivy is not recommended during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception unless the potential benefit for 
the mother outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.   
A warning has been added in section 4.4 of the SmPC that live or live-attenuated vaccines should not be 
given concurrently with the treatment. Studies have not been conducted in patients who recently received 
live vaccines. 
Regarding  baseline  renal  function,  the  global  safety  profile  remained  comparable  between  baseline 
normal, mild or moderate function. However, it should be noted that the frequency of grade 3/ 4 events 
tented to increase with severity of renal impairment, as well thrombocytopenia events, and AEs leading to 
treatment modification. 
No dose adjustment of Polivy is required in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCL) ≥ 30 mL/min. A 
recommended dose has not been determined for patients with CrCL < 30mL/min due to limited data. 
A similar safety profile was observed across histologies and R or G combination, and in arm G in the 
pivotal study. The reporting was similar in the supportive studies, despite lower frequency. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
Overall, the safety data presented cannot be considered comprehensive evidence. The CHMP therefore 
concluded that additional safety data in a larger population and long-term safety - including second 
primary malignancies- will need to be generated in the context of a conditional marketing authorisation.

Safety data from the ongoing GO29365 study - Arm H (n=64) and the pooled analysis of Arm G (n=42) 
and Arm H (n=64) will be provided. Further safety data will be provided within the randomised Study 
GO39942, that evaluates polatuzumab vedotin in combination with R-CHP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, prednisone) versus R-CHOP, planning to enrol 875 patients with previously untreated diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma at an estimated follow up of up to 65 months.   
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the available data suggest that the safety profile of polatuzumab vedotin is not negligible 
(potential life-threatening AEs like myelosupression and infections were identified, and PN events 
impacting the treatment course), yet still manageable in the context of a severe condition like R/R TNE 
DLBCL. 
The CHMP considers the following measures in the context of a conditional MA: 
• 
• 
In order to further confirm the safety and efficacy of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with BR 
the MAH will provide the primary CSR for study GO29365 including the primary analysis of Arm H 
(n=64) as well as a pooled analysis of Arm G (n=42) and Arm H (n=64).  
In order to further confirm the safety and efficacy of polatuzumab vedotin in DLBCL the MAH will also 
provide Study GO39942, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluates 
polatuzumab vedotin in combination with R-CHP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
prednisone) versus R-CHOP in patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.   
Further, at the recommendation of the CHMP the applicant will submit results from the evaluation  of  
safety and tolerability in Study MO40598 - a phase III, open-label, multicenter randomized clinical trial 
that evaluates polatuzumab vedotin in combination with rituximab plus gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin 
(R-GemOx) versus R-GemOx alone in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. 
Note: Study MO40598 will have a 10-patient safety run-in period to assess peripheral neuropathy risk due 
to use of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with the R-GemOx regimen; based on the afore-mentioned 
safety assessment, study might continue or not in the randomized clinical trial stage.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.3 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 10.06.2019. The new EURD list entry will therefore use 
the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that polatuzumab vedotin has not been previously authorised in a medicinal 
product in the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers polatuzumab vedotin to be a new active substance as 
it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019 
Page 148/159 
  
  
 
 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.1.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to omit certain particulars from the vial label as per Article 63(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group with the following 
comments: 1) it must be clear that this is a powder for concentrate and it needs to be diluted after 
reconstitution and before use, so this needs to be prominently displayed on the vial labelling; and 2) the 
inclusion of ‘cytotoxic’ should be considered, and “Do not shake” may also be important to state.  
It was also noted that for the trilingual mock-up, some improvements could be made to simplify/increase 
the readability: 1) the route of administration could be mentioned as “IV na reconstitutie en verdunning 
/ après reconstitution et dilution / nach Rekonstitution und Verdünnung”; and 2) as only the capital letter 
differs between FR/NL and DE, the active substance does not need to be repeated. 
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included in 
the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website and translated in all languages but will appear in 
grey-shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.  
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. Moreover, it is proposed to be approved under 
a conditional marketing authorisation. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Polatuzumab vedotin, is intended in combination with bendamustine and rituximab, for the treatment of 
adult patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are not candidates for 
haematopoietic stem cell transplant.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
After failure of front-line therapy, the main consideration for determining the treatment approach in the 
second-line  setting  is  whether  the  patient  is  a  haematopoietic  stem  cell  transplant  candidate.  The 
treatment approach for RR DLBCL, TNE patients, is mainly based on platinum- and/or gemcitabine-based 
regimens, and clinical trials with novel drugs. There is no specifically approved treatment in 2nd line of 
therapy whereas, the recent approval of CAR-T cell therapies offers an additional therapeutic option in 
patients after at least two previous lines of treatment. However, an unmet medical need still remains for 
patients with R/R DLBCL who are ineligible for transplant or fail ASCT and in these RR TNE DLBCL patients, 
as not all patients would be able to receive CAR-T therapies due to performance status and considering 
toxicities and delay in manufacturing times for these treatments.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main efficacy data submitted come from a single pivotal phase IB/II, multicenter, open-label, 
randomized study of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with BR or bendamustine plus obinutuzumab 
(BG) in patients with R/R FL or DLBCL. In the randomized phase II part of the pivotal study, 40 RR DLBCL 
patients received pola+BR and BR each. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint (CR rate at primary response assessment (6-8 weeks after Cycle 6 Day 1 or last 
dose of study medication, based on PET-CT, IRC assessed) was increased in the pola+BR arm: 40.0% 
(16/40 patients; 95% CI: [24.9%, 56.7%]) vs 17.5% in the BR arm (7/40 patients; 95% CI: [7.3%, 
32.8%]). The Δ was 22.5%, statistically significant and in favour of pola+BR (95% CI: 2.6%, 40.2%; p 
=0.0261, Cochran Mantel-Haenszel [CMH] chi-square).  
Secondary efficacy endpoints (CR and OR [CR or PR]), assessed by the INV or IRC per PET-CT and CT 
only, were consistent with this primary efficacy result (POLA+BR vs BR). 
The PFS (secondary endpoint) as determined by IRC was almost thrice increased in patients treated with 
pola+ BR compared to BR (stratified HR =0.36; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.63; p =0.0002), with median PFS of 9.5 
months [6.2, 13.9] vs 3.7 months [2.4, 4.5]. At 6 months, event free rate for PFS was 65.59% (CI: 50.42, 
80.76) in the pola+BR arm, vs 15.82%; (CI: 3.16, 28.47) in the BR arm. This difference remained stable 
over time, at 9 and 12 months. A similar trend was observed in EFS. 
The  risk  of  death  was  reduced  by  58%  in  patients  treated  with  pola+BR  compared  to  BR  (stratified 
HR=0.42; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.75; p =0.0023).  
The median OS was 12.4 months (95% CI: 9.0, NE) in the pola+BR arm, and 4.7 months (95% CI: 3.7, 
8.3) in the BR arm. At 6 months, 30/40 patients remained alive in the pola+BR arm, vs 11/40 patients in 
the BR arm. This difference remained persistent over time, at 9 months (24/40 vs 7/40) and at 12 months 
(19/40 vs 7/40).   
Ancillary analysis and sensitivity analysis confirmed the favorable trends in PFS and OS across subgroups 
in the overall R/R DLBCL population, in favor of the pola+BR arm. 
In both randomized arms, only one third of patients were treated in 2L treatment. CR globally decreased 
with  increasing  number  of  prior  treatments.  This  trend  was  less  marked  in  BR  arm,  since  CR  rate 
increased up to 22.2% in 3L patients. CR rate remained higher in pola+BR vs BR arm in each subgroup, 
mainly in 2L patients: 63.6% (30.8, 89.1) vs 16.7% (2.1, 48.4), despite limited sample size (11 and 12 
patients  respectively).  In  both  arms,  CR  was  lower  in  refractory  patients,  independently  from  the 
treatment line.  
Preliminary efficacy results obtained in arm G show a favourable trend in efficacy, with CR rate of 34.3% 
(18.6, 53.2), but lower than in arm C. Median PFS and OS are sharply lower, with shorter FU: PFS: 6.0 
months (3.5, 6.6) in arm G vs 11.1 months (6.2, 13.9) in arm C; OS: 6.1 months (4.4, NE) in arm G vs 
12.4 (9.0, NE). Additional efficacy results in 42 patients, up to 15 March 2019, remain similar in terms of 
CR, lower than in arm C (33.3%; [19.6, 49.6]). However, OS increased up to 9.1 months [6.0, NE]. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Randomized  efficacy  results  in  the  target  indication  are  available  in  a  limited  and  heterogeneous 
population (n=40 in each arm), with the liquid formulation. Arm G, conducted with the lyo formulation in 
the pivotal study, is ongoing. Preliminary results in 32 patients were provided at time of response to LoQ, 
with additional top line results in 42 patients. However, the conduct of a larger (>100 patients) single arm 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019 
Page 150/159 
  
  
 
 
study, using the new formulation, was considered warranted by the CHMP to reach reassurance regarding 
findings in the pivotal study; arm H (n=60) was subsequently added to the study, with results expected 
Q3 2020 date as a specific obligation to the CMA (see RMP and Annex II).  
In the pivotal trial the WHO 2016 DLBCL status was heterogeneous, however balanced between arms. 
Efficacy data per WHO status in ongoing arms G and H are expected (see RMP). 
Among all patients treated with pola in GO29365 study, a total of 8 patients developed ADA, including 4 
DLBCL patients. Impact on efficacy was not evidenced, considering that 3 of them completed 5 to 6 cycles 
of treatment and DOR from 21 to 38 months. However, the last patient presented with ADA at C2 and was 
diagnosed with PD at C3. Further data on ADA and potential impact on efficacy will be provided in the 
context of the additional data generated in arms G and H, which is an SOB (see RMP and Annex II).    
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Myelosupression was reported across all studies. Neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, anemia and 
thrombocytopenia were all included in the AEs of particular interest. In the pivotal study, neutropenia was 
more  frequently  observed  in  pola+BR  (60.0  vs  53.8%).  The  incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  was 
comparable between both arms (11.1% vs. 12.8%in BR arm), and almost all neutropenia events were 
grade 3/ 4 in both arms.  The incidence of anemia was higher in pola+BR vs BR DLBCL arm (46.7 vs 
28.2%).  Limited  impact  on  treatment  was  reported.  Incidence  of  thrombocytopenia  was  higher  in 
pola+BR vs BR DLBCL arm (48.9 vs 33.3%). The majority of events were grade 3/ 4 events. These events 
have  an  impact  on  treatment  course,  considering  that  neutropenia  led  to  study  withdrawal  and  pola 
discontinuation (8.9% of patients each). A warning has been added in section 4.4 of the SmPC to monitor 
complete blood counts prior to each dose of Polivy. 
The incidence of infectious events was similar in pola+BR and BR DLBCL arms (53.3 vs 51.3%), and most 
events were Grade ≥ 3 in both groups. The incidence of serious infections events was also comparable 
between  both  arms  (28.9%  vs.  30.8%).  In  the  pola+BR  group,  4  patients  (8.9%)  experienced  fatal 
events. Six (6) opportunistic infections were reported in 4 patients (8.9%) in pola+BR arm: 3 of these 
patients died due to opportunistic infection. A warning has been added in section 4.4 of the SmPC that 
patients should be closely monitored during treatment for signs of bacterial, fungal, or viral infections. 
Peripheral neuropathy was reported across all studies. In the pivotal study, PN events were more frequent 
in pola+BR arm (40.0% vs 7.7% in BR arm). None was fatal, serious nor led to study withdrawal. All 
events were Grade 1 or 2 in both arms. In pola+BR arm, the main reported PTs were neuropathy 
peripheral (9 patients) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (6 patients). The median TTO was 1.4 months 
for the pola+BR group. In the supportive studies, longer median treatment exposure and higher 
cumulative dose correlated with the higher incidence and severity of PN events. A warning has been 
added in section 4.4 of the SmPC that patients should be monitored for symptoms of PN such as 
hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paraesthesia, dysesthesia, neuropathic pain, burning sensation, muscle 
weakness, or gait disturbance. Patients experiencing new or worsening PN may require a delay, dose 
reduction, or discontinuation of Polivy (see section 4.2). 
Serious cases of hepatic toxicity that were consistent with hepatocellular injury, including elevations of 
transaminases and/or bilirubin, have occurred in patients treated with Polivy (see section 4.4 and 4.8). 
Pre-existing liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, and concomitant medicinal products may 
increase the risk. Liver enzymes and bilirubin level should be monitored. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
At  time  of  submission,  the  interim  CSR  for  the  pivotal  study  covered  up  to  1  year  FU  after  primary 
response assessment for all enrolled patients. To date, limited long term safety data is available. Despite 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690748/2019 
Page 151/159 
  
  
 
 
available data on PN events, further investigation is needed also in terms of the impact of PN on PROs. 
Final results are expected, as part of the SOB to the CMA (see RMP and Annex II). The applicant accepted 
a recommendation of the CHMP to submit the results of a study (including a safety run-in) that evaluates 
polatuzumab in combination with rituximab, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin (R-GemOx) versus R-GemOx 
alone.  
A fatal case of MDS occurred 2 years after study start, in a heavily pre-treated patient; however, this case 
of second primary malignancy is of concern and the risk of carcinogenicity remains closely monitored, as 
part of the important potential risks for polatuzumab. Further evaluation of the risk of carcinogenicity in 
polatuzumab vedotin treated patients will be provided through post-authorisation long term data (see 
RMP). Further to a case of suspected PML a warning has been added in section 4.4 of the SmPC that 
patients  should  be  monitored  closely  for  new  or  worsening  neurological,  cognitive,  or  behavioural 
changes suggestive of PML. This issue will be further monitored through the agreed post authorisation 
studies.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Treatment with polatuzumab vedotin at target doses of 1.8mg/kg, given as an intravenous infusion every 
21 days in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) for 6 cycles, shows a significant increase 
in CR and OR compared to the comparative BR treatment in patients with RR DLBCL, non-candidates for 
haematopoietic stem cell transplant. These results are further supported by a significant increase of PFS 
and  OS,  despite  secondary  and  exploratory  endpoints  respectively.  WHO  2016  DLBCL  status  was 
heterogeneous, but balanced in both arms.  
Despite the limitations of the pivotal study GO29365 being conducted in a small number of patients the 
comparative design is valuable. 
Ancillary analysis and sensitivity analysis confirmed the positive trends in PFS and OS across subgroups 
of the R/R DLBCL population, in favour of the pola+BR arm.

Despite different populations and combinations, the three key supportive studies confirm the favourable 
effect observed in the pivotal study while adding polatuzumab vedotin for RR DLBCL treatment. 
Despite manageable, the safety profile includes myelosupression, infections, peripheral neuropathy and 
hepatic toxicity with a non-negligible impact on treatment course. One fatal case of MDS, added to the 
potential genotoxic effect of this product, highlight the need for longer follow up safety data. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit risk balance of Polivy in combination with bendamustine and rituximab in the treatment of 
adult patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are not candidates for 
haematopoietic stem cell transplant, is positive.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
The submission is based on data from one pivotal study GO29365, performed in a small number of 
patients, with possible suboptimal comparative treatment. As comprehensive data on the product in the 
proposed indication are not available, the CHMP was of the view that a full marketing authorissaation 
could not be granted. Instead, a conditional marketing authorisation was proposed by the CHMP during 
the assessment, after having consulted the applicant. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning conditional 
marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease and is designated as an 
orphan medicinal product. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed above. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
The evidence provided is based on a small exploratory trial in a limited (82 patients in total received 
Polivy in trial GO29365; 40 patients from the randomized part arm C and 42 patients from arm G 
using the lyophilised formulation) and heterogeneous population in terms of prognosis Long-term 
safety data are not available. Submitted data are thus considered non-comprehensive.  
The primary CSR for study GO29365 including the primary analysis of Arm H (n=64) as well as a 
pooled analysis of Arm G (n=42) and Arm H (n=64) will be provided. Distinct histology subtypes 
will be analysed within Arm H which is considered necessary to confirm response in any relevant 
subtype at least on a descriptive level. The study is ongoing and the required data are expected to 
be provide in Q3 2020. 
The MAH will also provide Study GO39942, by end 2021. This is a randomized, double-blind, 
placebocontrolled trial that evaluates polatuzumab vedotin in combination with R-CHP (rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone) versus R-CHOP in patients with previously untreated 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival. Key secondary 
endpoints include complete remission rate per independent review committee and overall survival. 
Thus, even though this trial is in an earlier line of treatment it is expected that efficacy and safety 
results will be confirmative in DLBCL.

combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) provides a therapeutic option for patients in 
this setting where there is a clear unmet need.  
Pola+BR also provides an important contribution to patient care in third line (3+) treatment of R/R 
DLBCL. In this setting, available treatment options include Pixuvri (pixantrone) and recently 
approved CAR-T cell therapies (Kymriah and Yescarta).  
With regards to Pixuvri, it can be accepted that the activity of this compound is limited and a major 
therapeutic advantage of Polivy over pixantrone in terms of efficacy may be inferred. While 
clinically relevant activity has been shown for Polivy as well as for the CAR-T cell products approved 
in 3L+, comparing the relative impact of these medicinal products on time-dependent endpoints is 
fraught with uncertainty due to cross-study comparisons of relatively small studies, as well as the 
fact that the CAR-T cell products were approved based on single arm trials that do not isolate the 
impact of these drugs on PFS and OS. 
Compared to the approved CAR-T therapies, Pola+BR presented with a manageable toxicity profile. 
Specifically, the CHMP noted that CAR-T cell treatment is associated with the risk of life-threatening 
or fatal cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) and CNS neurologic toxicities including seizures, cerebral 
edema, and encephalopathies requiring close monitoring of patients ideally in a hospital setting.  In 
comparison, there have been no reports of CRS with Polivy +BR and neurologic toxicities, while 
observed with pola+BR, have been limited to peripheral neuropathy, were mostly low grade and 
non-serious. Pola+BR therefore compared favourable to CAR-T cells in these relevant safety 
aspects. 
Polivy+BR also offers the additional benefits of an immediate treatment option whereas with CAR-T 
cells, patient may need to wait for a potentially significant interval prior to the actual administration 
of therapy, while the cells are being manufactured. This time span from diagnosis and 
leukapheresis to infusion of the finished product is of relevance for patients with an advanced 
disease, expected to progress rapidly and in need of urgent medical attention.  
Taken together, the CHMP was of the view that Polivy when used in combination with BR addresses 
the unmet medical need of TNE patients with R/R DLBCL in 2nd and 3rd line treatment.  
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required.  
In view of the promising efficacy results available with Polivy up to dat, its manageable safety 
profile and as unmet medical needs still exist as discussed above the benefits to public health of the 
immediate availability of Polivy outweigh the uncertainties inherent to the fact that long term safety 
date and more comprehensive efficacy data have been requested.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Polivy in combination with bendamustine and rituximab in the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are not candidates for 
haematopoietic stem cell transplant, is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Polivy is not similar to Yescarta and Kymriah within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Polivy is favourable in the following indication: 
“Polivy in combination with bendamustine and rituximab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are not candidates for 
haematopoietic stem cell transplant.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports

in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the 
conditional marketing authorisation  
This being a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures:

Description 
In order to further confirm the safety and efficacy of polatuzumab vedotin in 
combination with BR the MAH will provide the primary CSR for study GO29365 including 
the primary analysis of Arm H (n=64) as well as a pooled analysis of Arm G (n=42) and 
Arm H (n=64). 
Due date 
Q3 2020 
In order to further confirm the safety and efficacy of polatuzumab vedotin in DLBCL the 
MAH will provide  Study GO39942, a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial 
that evaluates polatuzumab vedotin in combination with R-CHP (rituximab, 
 Q4 2021 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone) versus R-CHOP in patients with previously 
untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that polatuzumab vedotin is a new 
active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 14 November 2019 
Polivy EMEA/H/C/004870/0000 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending the 
granting of the conditional marketing authorisation of Polivy 140 mg powder for concentrate for solution 
for infusion in combination with bendamustine and rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are not candidates for haematopoietic 
stem cell transplant.  
The reason for divergent opinion was the following:  
Divergent position:  
In line with the requirements for a conditional marketing authorisation, the applicant must ensure that 
the conditions for a conditional marketing authorisation have been shown for the product applied for. In 
the view of the divergent CHMP members, these requirements have not been fulfilled for the following 
reasons:  
In the guideline on the implementation of conditional marketing authorization regulation 
(EMA/CHMP/509951/2006, Rev 1) is described that major therapeutic advantage (MTA) would normally 
be based on meaningful improvement of efficacy or clinical safety. In exceptional cases, also major 
improvements to patient care could provide a MTA. Current policy dictates that in case MTA is based on 
improved safety/patient care, no important reduction in benefit should be seen which would make the 
overall benefit risk balance less favourable. This is also in alignment with e.g. Guidance on elements 
required to support significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies of a new therapeutic 
indication (2007).  
In this context and as it is uncertain that Polivy has a similar or greater efficacy than what is understood 
for available therapies for the same target population, the differential safety profile or/and improvement 
in patient care is not considered to constitute a MTA per se.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 14 November 2019 
Polivy EMEA/H/C/004870/0000 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending the 
granting of the conditional marketing authorisation of Polivy indicated in combination with bendamustine 
and rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) who are not candidates for haematopoietic stem cell transplant:  
The reason for divergent opinion was the following:  
This application is based on a very small single pivotal RCT of exploratory character, which was nested in 
an umbrella trial where the activity of polatuzumab vedotin in both DLBCL and follicular lymphoma (FL) 
was studied. As would be anticipated in such a setting, there was no overarching type 1 error control, and 
the overall approach to data was exploratory. 
The study in DLBCL unexpectedly demonstrated an OS gain of nominal statistical significance. However, 
the FL sub-study of similar design did not indicate any meaningful additive effect of Polivy to the same 
background regimen as in the DLBCL study. It appears that the reason for this inconsistency needs to be 
constructed post hoc. 
Moreover, it has been positively demonstrated that measurable baseline factors in the small pivotal study 
favoured the experimental arm. With two different statistical approaches, it was shown that adjusting for 
known confounders inflated the HR from 0.42 to 0.54-0.59. While this analysis provides evidence that, 
due to the small study size, randomisation was not effective in producing treatment groups with similar 
prognosis, it obviously can only take measured confounders into account. The extent of impact of 
unmeasured confounders in this study, with treatment arms shown not to be balanced at baseline, 
remains unknown.  
Adding to the uncertainty, activity was lower when Polivy was given with obinituzumab instead of 
rituximab in DLBCL, despite the former co-medication being considered more active than the latter. 
Furthermore, the CR rate in the reference arm of the pivotal trial appears lower than that reported in the 
literature. Thus, the true benefit of adding Polivy to BR in terms of incremental CR is also uncertain. 
For these reasons, it not considered that the efficacy of Polivy has been adequately established. 
Consequently B/R has not been shown to be positive.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Lonsurf (trifluridine/tipiracil) 
Lonsurf  (trifluridine/tipiracil,  also  named  TAS-102  or  S95005)  is  comprised  of  trifluridine  (FTD;  an 
antineoplastic  thymidine-based  nucleoside  analogue),  and  tipiracil  hydrochloride  (TPI;  a  thymidine 
phosphorylase  (TPase)  inhibitor),  at  a  molar  ratio  1:  0.5.  Following  uptake  into  cancer  cells,  FTD  is 
phosphorylated by thymidine kinase. Subsequently, this compound is further metabolised in the cells to a 
deoxyribonucleic acid DNA substrate. This substrate is incorporated directly into DNA, thereby interfering 
with  DNA  function  to  prevent  cell  proliferation.  However,  FTD  is  rapidly  degraded  by  TPase  and  readily 
metabolised by a first-pass effect following oral administration, hence the inclusion of the TPase inhibitor, 
TPI. In non-clinical studies, TAS-102 demonstrated antitumour activity against both 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 
sensitive and resistant colorectal cancer cell lines. The cytotoxic activity of TAS-102 against several human 
tumour xenografts correlated highly with the amount of FTD incorporated into DNA, suggesting this as the 
primary mechanism of action. 
In  the  European  Union  (EU),  Lonsurf  is  approved  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  metastatic 
colorectal  cancer  (mCRC)  who  have  been  previously  treated  with,  or  are  not considered  candidates  for, 
available  therapies  including  fluoropyrimidine-,  oxaliplatin-  and  irinotecan-based  chemotherapies, 
anti-VEGF  agents,  and  anti-EGFR  agents.  The  recommended  starting  dose  of  Lonsurf  is  35  mg/m2/dose 
administered orally twice daily (BID) on days 1 to 5 and days 8 to 12 of each 28-day cycle, which is to be 
continued as long as benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Lonsurf has been administered, alone or in  combination with other agents, to at least 4,000 patients in 
clinical  trials,  and  to  more  than  64,000  patients  worldwide  (of  which  16,173  in  Europe)  as  a  marketed 
product. 
Indication applied for in current procedure 
The MAH initially applied for the following new indication: 
Gastric cancer 
Lonsurf  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  metastatic  gastric  cancer  including 
adenocarcinoma  of  the  gastroesophageal  junction,  who  have  been  previously  treated  with,  or  are  not 
considered candidates for, available therapies including fluoropyrimidine-, platinum-, and either a taxane- 
or irinotecan-based chemotherapy. 
The following indications have been agreed: 
Colorectal cancer 
Lonsurf is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
(CRC)  who  have  been  previously  treated  with,  or  are  not  considered  candidates  for,  available  therapies 
including  fluoropyrimidine-,  oxaliplatin-  and  irinotecan-based  chemotherapies,  anti-VEGF  agents,  and 
anti-EGFR agents. 
Gastric cancer 
Lonsurf is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic gastric 
cancer including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who have been previously 
treated with at least two prior systemic treatment regimens for advanced disease (see section 
5.1). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/479870/2019 
Page 8/88 
 
  
  
At the time of submission Lonsurf was not approved for the treatment of gastric cancer in any region (during 
the procedure it has received approval in the USA on the 22 February 2019). 
The proposed posology for the treatment of gastric cancer is the same as for the currently approved mCRC 
indication, i.e. 35 mg/m2 administered BID per os (PO) on days 1 to 5 and days 8 to 12 of each 28-day cycle, 
which is to be continued as long as benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
The addition of monotherapy for both indications is introduced for clarity and consistency with the regulatory 
approach in the field after discussion at the oncology working party which approved that product used as 
monotherapy in clinical practice should always specify this in the indication. 
Gastric cancer 
Gastric cancer (GC; also referred to as stomach cancer), is the fifth most common and third most deadly 
cancer in the world. In 2018, there were over 1 million (1,033,701) new cases of GC and 782,685 deaths 
from GC reported globally. Of these, 133,133 cases and 102,167 deaths occurred in the EU. The geographic 
distribution of GC, is varied across the globe, with the highest burden of disease seen in Eastern and Western 
Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, and South America (Globocan 2018; accessed on 21 November 2018). 
Gastro-oesophageal  junction  (GEJ)  cancer  anatomically  straddles  the  distal  oesophagus  and  proximal 
stomach. Due to its location and given that, like GC, the majority of GEJ tumours are adenocarcinomas, GEJ 
cancer  is  frequently  grouped  together  with  GC  in  the  advanced  setting  and  treated  the  same  way.  For 
simplicity, when hereafter the term “GC” is used, this includes both gastric as well as GEJ cancer, unless 
stated otherwise. 
Surgical  resection  is  available  as  a  potentially  curative  option  for  patients  diagnosed  with  early  stage 
disease,  although  the  majority  of  patients  will  ultimately  relapse  following  resection  (Smyth,  2016). 
Approximately half of patients will have advanced disease, not eligible for resection, at diagnosis (Ajani, 
2016). 
Advanced and/or metastatic gastric cancer (i.e. stage IV) remains among the deadliest solid tumours, with 
5-year overall survival (OS) below 5%; even with optimal treatment, median survival remains less than 1 
year  (Yang,  2011;  Digklia,  2016;  Koizumi,  2008).  Patients  with  inoperable  advanced  and/or  metastatic 
disease  should  be  considered  for  chemotherapy,  which  has  shown  improved  survival  and  quality  of  life 
compared with best supportive care alone (Smyth, 2016).  
The  most  common  therapeutic  approach  in  first-line  systemic  treatment  for  these  patients  is  doublet 
chemotherapy,  most  commonly  employing  a  fluoropyrimidine  and  a  platinum  derivative  (Ajani,  2016; 
Smyth, 2016). Evidence suggests that significant benefit may derive from the addition of a third agent (for 
example, docetaxel), provided the patient is able to tolerate such treatment (Okines, 2009). For patients 
with  human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  2-positive  (HER2+)  tumours  (approximately  20%  [van 
Cutsem, 2015]), the addition of trastuzumab is recommended (Smyth, 2016). 
For  patients  who  progress  following  first-line  chemotherapy,  second-line  treatment  has  been  shown  to 
further prolong survival and improve quality of life for many patients. Selection of treatment is dependent 
upon prior therapy and performance status (PS) at baseline. The European Society for Medical Oncology 
(ESMO) guidelines currently provide a number of possible approaches that may include the anti-vascular 
endothelial  growth  factor  receptor  monoclonal  antibody  ramucirumab  and/or  paclitaxel,  irinotecan,  or 
docetaxel (Smyth, 2016).  
After  failure  of  second-line  therapies,  there  are  neither  approved  nor  standard  third-line  treatments. 
Nevertheless, patients with good PS (≤1) and with good organ function could be offered the option to receive 
systemic  chemotherapy  without  proof  of  OS  benefit.  Indeed,  even  though  currently  not  supported  by 
randomized data, third-line chemotherapy is increasingly administered to patients failing previous lines and 
maintaining  an  acceptable  PS,  particularly  in  Asian  countries  (Salati,  2017).  Then  again,  the  ESMO 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/479870/2019 
Page 9/88 
 
  
  
guidelines note on this matter that second-line treatment options may be used sequentially in second- and 
third- line, but with caution that “there is no clear evidence for a benefit beyond second-line treatment” 
(Smyth, 2016).  
As said, no study has yet identified a preferred or consistently effective third- (or later-) line option for all 
patients, although apatinib and nivolumab have shown success for different subsets of patients (Li, 2016; 
Kang, 2017). The major concern for the results of these product is the lack of generalisability to a European 
population since both medicinal products’ studies enrolled only Asian patients, who are recognised to have 
different tumour biology and clinical outcome compared to the European population. Apatinib and nivolumab 
are not registered in the EU for this indication. Very recently, the results of the JAVELIN Gastric 300 study of 
avelumab versus (vs.) physician’s choice  of  paclitaxel  or irinotecan as third-line treatment in metastatic 
gastric cancer  (mGC) were published. The study did not meet its primary objective of superiority in OS 
(Bang, 2018).  
Considering the above, best supportive care (BSC) is deemed an acceptable option for the target population. 
Table  1  provides  an  overview  of  the  main  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCT)  in  second-  and  later-line 
treatment of mGC. From the rather poor efficacy outcomes in this table, it is clear that new therapeutic 
approaches are urgently needed in this setting.

TAS-102 in treatment-refractory metastatic gastric cancer 
The efficacy of TAS-102 against tumours insensitive to 5-FU has been demonstrated, both in vitro and in 
vivo, using a variety of human gastric carcinoma models (Matsuoka, 2018; Suzuki, 2017). 
TAS-102 has previously been evaluated in the treatment of patients with GC in two separate clinical studies. 
The first was study TAS-102-9806, an open-label, single-arm (Taiho-sponsored) study conducted in the US, 
in  which  patients  with  mGC  who  had  progressed  on  1 prior  therapy  received  TAS-102  monotherapy  25

mg/m2 BID (thus a lower dose than the approved dose of 35 mg/m2 BID in colorectal cancer). The study 
design was the 2-stage Simon design and there was no tumour response among the first 18 patients in stage 
1;  accordingly,  this  study  was  terminated  early  and  did  not  proceed  to  stage  2.  Safety  findings  were 
consistent with the safety profile of TAS-102 established in earlier pivotal mCRC clinical studies (Mayer, 
2015, i.e. page 25-6 of RECOURSE protocol in Supplementary Material). 
The  second  study,  EPOC1201  (Bando,  2016),  was  an  investigator-initiated  Phase  2  study  conducted  in 
Japan,  evaluating  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  TAS-102  (35  mg/m2  BID)  in  29  patients  with 
treatment-refractory mGC who had previously received 1 or 2 previous chemotherapy regimens containing 
fluoropyrimidines, platinum agents, and taxanes or irinotecan. In this study, the objective response rate 
(ORR) was 3.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.1, 17.8), the disease control rate (DCR) was 65.5% (95% 
CI,  45.7,  82.1);  the  median  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  was  2.9  months  (95%  CI,  1.1,  5.3)  by 
investigator assessment, and median OS (mOS) was 8.7 months (95% CI, 5.7, 14.9). In this population of 
pre-treated patients, TAS-102 had  an acceptable toxicity profile.  Common Grade 3 or 4 adverse  events 
(AEs)  included  neutropenia  (69.0%),  leukopenia  (41.4%),  anaemia  (20.7%)  and  anorexia  (10.3%).  No 
treatment-related deaths were observed. 
The results of study EPOC1201, which included DCR, mOS, and median PFS (mPFS) comparable to or better 
than those achieved in other studies of post-second-line treatment approaches to mGC (Table 1), provided 
the  rationale  for  the  pivotal  study  that  forms  the  basis  of  this  application,  i.e.  the  randomized, 
placebo-controlled, phase 3 TAS-102 gastric study (TAS-102-302, TAGS). Of note, the results of TAGS have 
very recently been published (Shitara, 2018). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In light of the extension of the indication for Lonsurf, an environmental risk assessment was submitted by 
the MAH. 
In the new proposed indication considering the worst case situation for the daily dose calculation and the 
revised prevalence of Gastric cancer, the PECSURFACEWATER (μg/L) for trifluridine and tipiracil, HCl can be 
calculated as follow for gastric cancer: 
PECSURFACEWATER for trifluridine = 57.14x1000x0.0000259 / 200x10 = 0.00074 µg/L 
PECSURFACEWATER for tipiracil, HCl = 23.39x1000x0.0000259 / 200x10   = 0.00030 µg/L 
Calculation taking into consideration both indications, metastatic colorectal cancer and gastric cancer, for 
Lonsurf provides a PECSURFACEWATER of: 
PECSURFACEWATER (μg/L) for trifluridine = 0.0029 + 0.00074 = 0.0036 μg/L 
PECSURFACEWATER (μg/L) for tipiracil, HCl = 0.0012 + 0.00030 = 0.0015 μg/L 
Based on the calculation above a Phase II assessment is not necessary. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Trifluridine-tipiracil HCl is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  assessments  were  conducted  during  study  TAS-102-302  (TAGS).  Further, 
drug-drug and drug-disease (non-cancer) interactions were not evaluated in this study. 
The proposed TAS-102 starting dose in adult patients with mGC is 35 mg/m2 administered orally twice daily 
(BID) on days 1 to 5 and days 8 to 12 of each 28-day cycle, which is to be continued as long as benefit is 
observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. This posology is identical to that previously accepted for 
treatment of adult patients with mCRC. No specific comparison of the PK of FTD and/or TPI between mGC 
and mCRC patient types was provided in this variation. However, in the initial application for the mCRC 
indication, TAS-102 was dosed to patients with various solid tumours. No differences in PK of FTD and/or TPI 
were noted between the different patient populations at that time (Lonsurf mCRC EPAR). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Not applicable, as no new data were provided in this application.

2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
There are no indications that FTD and/or TPI Pharmacology in mGC patients is different to that in mCRC 
patients. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The only study included in this application, is the pivotal study (TAGS). 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dose response studies were included in this application. The applicant has given a justification for the 
proposed posology as follows: 
TAS-102 (35 mg/m2/dose) was administered orally BID,  within  1  hour after  completion of morning and 
evening meals, for 5 days each week with 2 days rest for 2 weeks, followed by a 14-day rest. This treatment 
cycle  was  repeated  every  4  weeks.  The  safety  and  tolerability  of  this  TAS-102  regimen  was  previously 
demonstrated in the randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study (RECOURSE; TPU-TAS-102-301), in which 
TAS-102  was  shown  to  significantly  improve  OS  compared  to  placebo  in  patients  with  mCRC,  who  had 
previously been treated with, or were not candidates for fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based 
chemotherapy,  an  anti-VEGF  biological  therapy,  and  an  anti-epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  (EGFR) 
therapy  (Mayer,  2015;  Lonsurf  mCRC  EPAR).  In  an  investigator-sponsored,  phase  2  study  conducted  in 
Japan (Bando, 2016), this TAS-102 regimen was also well-tolerated in patients (n = 29) with mGC who had 
failed prior standard therapies. 
In addition, a lower dose of 25 mg/m2 BID was investigated as second-line treatment in the other phase 2 
study TAS-012-9806 in US patients with mGC. As there was no tumour response among the patients in 
stage 1 of the 2-stage Simon study design, this study was terminated early (Mayer 2015). 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Title of Study  
TAGS (TAS-102-302): Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase 3 Study Evaluating TAS-102 Plus Best Supportive 
Care (BSC) Versus Placebo Plus BSC in Patients with Metastatic Gastric Cancer Refractory to Standard 
Treatments 
Methods 
TAGS  was  a  multinational,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  phase  3  study  evaluating  the 
efficacy and safety of TAS-102 plus Best Supportive Care (BSC) vs. placebo plus BSC in patients with mGC 
refractory to standard treatments, i.e. patients who had received ≥2 prior regimens for advanced disease 
and were refractory to or  unable to tolerate their last prior therapy. A schematic of the study design is 
provided in Figure 1.

Study design TAGS 
Abbreviations:  BID  =  twice  daily;  ECOG  =  Eastern  cooperative  oncology  group;  PD  =  progressive  disease;  PS  = 
performance status; ROW = rest of world 
Eligible patients who met all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria (see below in section Study 
participants) were centrally randomized (in a 2:1 ratio) to receive either TAS-102 35 mg/m2 BID per os 
(PO) plus BSC (experimental arm) or placebo plus BSC (control arm). 
Computed tomography (CT) scans were performed at baseline (i.e. within 28 days prior to day 1 of cycle 1) 
and every 8 weeks thereafter until disease progression. On-site tumour assessments were performed by the 
investigator/local radiologist. Tumour assessments were analysed using response evaluation criteria in solid 
tumours (RECIST) criteria (version 1.1, 2009). Patient reported quality of life assessments (EORTC QLQ-C30 
and QLQ-STO22) were performed prior to study treatment administration in each cycle. 
For patients who discontinued treatment for reasons other than radiologic disease progression (e.g., due to 
intolerable side effects), every effort was made to perform an end of treatment tumour assessment prior to 
the start of new anti-cancer therapy. These patients continued to be followed for tumour response every 8 
weeks until radiologic disease progression (or death) or initiation of new anti-cancer therapy (whichever 
occurred  first).  After  discontinuation  of  study  treatment,  all  patients  were  followed  for  survival  every  4 
weeks until death or until the target number of events (deaths) was met, unless a patient had withdrawn 
consent to participate in the study. 
After the final analysis for the primary endpoint of OS, the study was to be unblinded, and patients from the 
placebo arm were to be offered the option to cross over to open-label TAS-102. 
A  data  monitoring  committee  (DMC)  was  established  for  this  study  to  provide  additional,  independent 
oversight that could enhance safety of study participants and the study conduct. The DMC comprised of 
clinicians and a statistician, all independent from the sponsor and investigative sites and selected as to avoid 
conflict of interest.

toxicity warranting discontinuation of treatment and precluding retreatment with the same 
agent prior to progression of disease were also eligible to enter the study. 
d.  Patients  who  received  (both  preoperative  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  as  well  as) 
postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy, and had recurrence during 
or within 6 months of completion of the adjuvant chemotherapy were allowed to count this

evening meals; 
  Control arm: placebo. 
TAS-102 contains FTD and TPI as active ingredients with a molar ratio of 1:0.5, and is formulated as an 
immediate-release film-coated tablet, which is supplied in 2 strengths (expressed as FTD content): 
- 
The ‘15 mg’ white, round tablet contains 15 mg FTD and 6.14 mg TPI (i.e. 7.065 mg TPI HCl) as 
active ingredients;

Study treatment was started within three calendar days after the date of randomization and continued until 
one of the discontinuation criteria was met or until completion of the primary endpoint, whichever occurred 
first. The discontinuation criteria included: 
-  RECIST-defined disease progression; 
-  Clinical progression; 
-  An  irreversible,  treatment-related,  Grade  4,  clinically  relevant,  non-hematologic  event  or 
(otherwise)  unacceptable  AE(s),  or  change  in  underlying  condition  such  that  the  patient  can  no 
longer tolerate therapy; 
- 
- 
Patient request; and 
Physician’s decision. 
After the final analysis for OS and unblinding of the study, patients from the placebo arm were to be offered 
the option to cross over to open-label TAS-102, and patients already receiving TAS-102 were also switched 
to open-label TAS-102.  
Objectives 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate OS for TAS-102 vs. placebo. 
The null and alternate hypotheses are read as follows: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/479870/2019 
Page 17/88 
 
  
  
 
-  H0: active treatment does not have a differential effect on the primary assessment of mortality risk 
(OS hazard ratio [HR]). The null hypothesis presumes that no statistically significant difference in OS 
between  two  groups  of  patients  (investigational  drug  and  placebo-controlled) is  observed  in  the 
study. 
-  HA: active treatment does have a differential effect on the primary assessment of mortality risk (OS 
HR).  The  alternate  hypothesis  presumes  that  there  is  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  OS 
between two groups of patients (investigational drug and placebo-controlled). 
Key secondary objectives 
The key secondary objectives were: 
- 
Progression-free survival (PFS) based on investigator assessment of radiologic images 
-  Safety and tolerability 
Other secondary objectives 
Other secondary objectives were: 
-  Overall response rate (ORR) 
-  Disease control rate (DCR) 
- 
Time to deterioration of ECOG PS to a score ≥2 
-  Quality of life (QoL) as evaluated by the European organization for research and treatment of cancer 
(EORTC) quality of life questionnaire-core 30 (QLQ-C30) and the QLQ-STO22, which is a module 
specific to patients with gastric cancer 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
OS was the primary endpoint of this study, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date 
of death due to any cause for the ITT population. In the absence of confirmation of death or for patients alive 
as of the OS cut-off date, the survival time was censored at the date of last study follow-up or the cut-off 
date,  whichever  was  earlier.  The  cut-off  date  for  OS  was  to  be  defined  by  the  date  of  the  384th  death. 
Patients having a documented survival status (alive or dead) after this date were censored at the cut-off 
date. 
Key secondary endpoints 
PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the first date of investigator-assessed 
radiological  disease  progression  or  death  due  to  any  cause.  Patients  who  were  alive  with  no  disease 
progression as of the analysis cut-off date were censored at the date of the last tumour assessment. Patients 
who received non-study cancer treatment before disease progression were censored at the date of the last 
evaluable tumour assessment before the non-study cancer treatment was initiated. 
Standard  safety  and  tolerability  monitoring  was  performed  and  AEs  were  Graded  using  NCI  CTCAE 
version 4.03. 
Other secondary endpoints 
The assessment of ORR was based on investigator review of radiologic images and following RECIST criteria 
(version 1.1, 2009). ORR was defined as the  proportion of patients with objective evidence  of complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR). The assessment of ORR was restricted to the tumour response (TR) 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/479870/2019 
Page 18/88 
 
  
  
population, i.e. patients with measurable disease (at least 1 target lesion) at baseline and with at least 1 
post-baseline evaluation. At the analysis stage, the best overall response was assigned for each patient as 
the best response recorded from the start of treatment through the treatment period (excluded assessments 
during follow-up). If applicable, responses recorded after radiologic disease progression or after initiation of 
non-study antitumor therapy were excluded. A best response assignment of stable disease (SD) required 
that SD be maintained for at least 6 weeks from the start of treatment. 
DCR was defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR, or SD. The assessment 
of DCR paralleled that of ORR. 
The time to deterioration to ECOG PS ≥2 was defined as the time from randomization until the first date 
on which an ECOG PS ≥2 was observed. Of note, ECOG PS 2 entails that a patient is ambulant and capable 
of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities. Patients not reaching an ECOG PS score of ≥2 
were censored at the last recorded ECOG assessment. 
QoL  was  assessed  using  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  and  QLQ-STO22.  The  core  questionnaire,  the  QLQ-C30, 
incorporates 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, 
pain,  and  nausea  and  vomiting),  a  global  health  status  scale,  and  a  number  of  single  items  assessing 
additional  symptoms  commonly  reported  by  cancer  patients  (dyspnoea,  loss  of  appetite,  insomnia, 
constipation  and  diarrhoea)  and  perceived  financial  impact  of  the  disease.  The  gastric  cancer  module 
(QLQ-STO22)  is  meant  for  use  among  gastric  cancer  patients  varying  in  disease  stage  and  treatment 
modality. This 22-item instrument is used alongside the 30-item QLQ-C30 core questionnaire, resulting in a 
total of 52 items. The time to deterioration of QoL was defined as the time from randomization until the 
first date on which a deterioration of QoL by ≥5 points in global health status was observed. 
Sample size 
The study was designed to detect with 90% power a hazard ratio for death of 0.70 (30% risk reduction) in 
the TAS-102 arm compared with the placebo arm with an overall 1-sided type 1 error of 0.025. A variable 
accrual period of 18 months and a 5%/year loss to survival follow-up rate was assumed. Using a treatment 
allocation of 2:1 (TAS-102:placebo) of 500 patients, 384 deaths were targeted for the final OS analysis. 
Based on these design operating characteristics and assuming a median survival time of approximately 5 
months in the control arm, the primary analysis target events milestone would be reached approximately 8 
months after the last patient was randomized in the study. The mOS in the control arm was estimated based 
on the observed mOS of 3.8 months in the placebo arm of the phase 3 ramucirumab (REGARD) study in the 
second-line treatment of GC (Fuchs, 2013), and the observed mOS of 4.3 months in the placebo arm of the 
phase  3 everolimus (GRANITE) study in the  second-  and third-line  treatment  of  GC (Ohtsu, 2013).  The 
estimate  was  further  increased  to  5  months  to  account  for  the  higher  control  median  projected  in  the 
Japanese population. 
One interim analysis (IA) for efficacy and futility was planned for the study after approximately half of the 
total target events are observed (192 deaths), see section Statistical methods below. 
Randomisation 
Once patient confirmation of eligibility and the criteria for randomization were met, patients were centrally 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TAS-102 plus BSC or placebo plus BSC via an interactive voice/web response 
system (IXRS) based on a dynamic allocation method (biased coin).  
Patients were stratified by the following criteria:

Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. TAS-102 tablets of each strength, 15 mg or 20 mg, and the corresponding 
placebo  tablets,  respectively,  were  identical  in  appearance  and  were  packaged  in  identical  containers. 
During the conduct of the study, the treatment assignment was unknown to all patients, investigators, and 
ancillary  study  personnel  at  each  study  site,  and  to  employees  of  the  sponsor,  except  for  pre-specified 
personnel involved in pharmacovigilance reporting activities and clinical trial material management. Among 
the contract research organizations who assisted in the conduct of the study, treatment assignment was 
unknown except for personnel involved in drug labelling and distribution, IXRS activities, pharmacovigilance 
reporting activities, and provision of data for periodic DMC review. 
The final analysis was to be performed after the target number of events was reached, i.e. 384 deaths. After 
the final analysis, the study was to be unblinded. If the primary endpoint of the study was met and efficacy 
as  well  as  safety  supported  a  favourable  benefit/risk  ratio  for  TAS-102,  patients  currently  or  previously 
treated with placebo who continued to meet study eligibility criteria were to be offered the option to cross 
over to open-label TAS-102. Patients receiving TAS-102 were also switched to open-label TAS-102. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The “intent-to-treat (ITT) population” comprised all randomized patients, regardless of whether or not study 
drug was administered. This population was the primary population for the analysis of the efficacy data. All 
analyses using this population were based on the treatment assigned. 
The  “as-treated  (AT)  population”  was  defined  as  all  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study 
medication.  This  population  was  used  in  the  assessment  and  reporting  of  safety  data.  The  “as-treated 
population” was equivalent to “safety population”. This population was used for safety analyses. All analyses 
using this population were based on the treatment actually received. 
The “tumour response (TR) population” included all patients in the ITT population that met both of the two 
following criteria: 
-  measurable disease (at least one target lesion) at baseline; and 
- 
at least one post-baseline evaluation or early disease progression/cancer-related death occurred 
before first evaluation on treatment (post-baseline) took place. 
All analyses using this population were based on the treatment assigned. 
Primary endpoint OS analyses 
OS in the ITT population was compared between the 2 treatment groups (ITT population) using the stratified 
log-rank test. One-  and 2-sided p-values were presented.  The study  would  be  declared to have met its 
primary objective if the 1-sided p-value was less than 0.0215. The estimate of the HR and corresponding 
95%  CI  were  provided  using  a  Cox  proportional  hazards  (CPH)  model  including  treatment  and  the  3 
stratifications factors in the model. Survival for each arm was summarized using Kaplan Meier curves and 
further characterized in terms of the median and survival probability at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, along with the 
corresponding 2-sided 95% CI for the estimates. The stratification factors were populated as per the IXRS 
assignment.

Subgroup  analyses  were  conducted  for  each  of  the  stratification  factors  (as  per  IXRS)  and  additional 
subgroups were utilized for the supportive analysis of the primary and key secondary endpoint. Summary 
statistics,  HR  and  associated  95%  CI  were  presented  for  each  subgroup.  Only  2-sided  p-value  were 
calculated and presented in the tables by the subgroups. 
Supportive analyses for OS, conducted in the ITT population (unless otherwise noted), included: 
The unstratified log-rank test and a CPH model (only treatment effect included in the model); 
1.  Multivariate  analysis  using  the  CPH  model,  including  the  3  stratification  factors  and  potential 
prognostic/predictive factors: age (<65, ≥65 years), race (white, Asian, other), gender, number of 
prior  regimens  (2,  3+),  prior  therapy,  previous  gastrectomy,  GEJ  involvement,  presence  of 
peritoneal  metastases,  presence  of  liver  metastases,  number  of  metastatic  sites  (1-2,  3+), 
measurable disease, histology subtype (diffuse, intestinal), and HER2 status; 
Factors included in the model were assessed for co-linearity and a stepwise selection process was 
applied to identify a final subset of prognostic/predictive factors in the model. Once the subset was 
established,  treatment  was  added  to  the  final  model  to  assess  its  effect  in  the  presence  of  the 
identified covariates; 
An exploratory analysis of treatment by factor interactions using the CPH model was conducted, 
using the factors identified in the final model above; 
2.  Subgroup  analyses  were  also  conducted  for  each  of  the  stratification  factors  and  the  potential 
prognostic/predictive factors identified above. The HR and associated 95% CI were presented for 
each subgroup; 
3.  The primary efficacy analysis, as outlined above, were also run excluding any patients who did not 
have documented refractory mGC, as defined above in inclusion criteria #2 and #3 in section Study 
participants; 
4.  Additional sensitivity analyses defined in the statistical analysis plan (SAP): 
o  The primary efficacy analysis that excluded/adjusted for all major protocol violations; 
o  Stratified  test  analysis  using  the  CRF  designation  instead  of  IVRS,  assuming  there  are 
differences; 
o  OS analysis using as-treated (AT) population; 
o  Analysis  described  above  in  Section  10.4.1  was  also  run  excluding  high  accrual  (>25 
patients) sites; 
o  Analysis described above was also run using date of all collected events (death) and survival 
status as of 30-April-2018. 
One IA for efficacy and futility was planned for the study after approximately half of the total target events 
were  observed  (192  deaths).  The  Lan-DeMets  alpha-spending  approach  was  used  with  O'Brien-Fleming 
stopping boundaries to guide the efficacy evaluation at the interim and final OS analysis. This approach 
accounted for multiple testing and preserved the overall 1-sided study significance level of 0.025. A fixed HR 
boundary was used to assess futility (non-binding). Stop due to futility would have been recommended if 
observed HR would have been ≥0.95 when conditional power would have been less than 2%. Stopping the 
study for efficacy would have been recommended if calculated 1-sided p-value would have been less than 
0.0015. The corresponding HR for such significant results would have been less than approximately 0.63, 
associated with a mOS improvement from 5 to 7.9 months. The exact boundaries were derived based on the 
actual number of events used for the IA.

EMA/479870/2019 
Page 21/88 
 
  
  
For the final analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint the result was considered as significant if 1-sided 
p-value was less than 0.0245 (this was subject to change based on the information/number of events at the 
IA). The corresponding HR for such significant result was less than approximately 0.808 associated with a 
mOS improvement from 5 to 8 months). 
Key secondary endpoint PFS analyses 
Since PFS was the only key secondary endpoint for regulatory registration purposes, no further multiplicity 
adjustments were made. Assuming that OS demonstrated significance at the 1-sided 0.025 level, PFS could 
subsequently be tested at the 2-sided 0.05 level. 
PFS analyses largely followed the methodology specified above for OS. In line with FDA guidance additional 
sensitivity analyses were conducted on the ITT population. Subgroup analysis followed the logic applied to 
the primary endpoint investigation. The list of other planned examinations reads as follows: 
-  Analysis that included clinical progression as a PFS event in addition to the presence of radiological 
evidence of progression. 
-  Analysis  including  clinical  progression  as  a  PFS  event  that  also  counted  initiation  of  non-study 
antitumor  therapy  as  an  event  date  rather  than  as  date  used  to  censor  subsequent  response 
assessment. 
-  Analysis that included all deaths and response assessments (without censoring missed visits) and 
counted  as  an  event  any  one  of  the  following  list:  radiological  evidence  of  progression,  clinical 
progression, initiation of non-study antitumor therapy, and death through the date of cut-off for 
survival. 
-  Analysis described above was also run excluding high accrual (>25 patients) sites. 
-  Analysis  of  time  to  first,  second  and  third  radiological  tumour  assessments  from  the  date  of 
randomization (Kaplan-Meier curves of times was depicted and the corresponding supporting tables 
were created; log-rank test were applied for examination and comparison of the two groups). 
The PFS censoring rules are shown below in Table 4.

Other secondary efficacy endpoint analyses 
All other secondary endpoints comparisons were made at the 2-sided 0.05 significance level. 
The treatment comparison for  ORR and  DCR were based on the TR population using Fisher’s exact test. 
Treatment estimates and differences were presented along with the associated 95% CIs.

The time to deterioration of ECOG PS to a score ≥2 was analysed using methodology described above for OS. 
A sensitivity analysis was performed using only on therapy ECOG assessments for analysis, i.e. excluding 
deaths during the survival follow-up period (when ECOG was not measured). 
The time to deterioration of QoL by ≥5 points in global health status was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 
and QLQ-STO22. Scales was scored according to the EORTC scoring manual. Descriptive statistics, for both 
scales, for the summary scores, as well as the subscale scores were provided for each assessed time point. 
In  addition,  change  in  QoL  scores  at  representative  time  points  (i.e.  prior  to  cycle  2,3,  and  4)  were 
determined for the summary, all domains and single items by subtracting each patient’s score from  their 
corresponding  baseline  score.  In  addition,  time  to  QoL  deterioration  was  evaluated  for  each  arm  using 
Kaplan-Meier  estimates  and  compared  using  the  log-rank  test  (and  Cox  proportional  hazards  models 
adjusting for the baseline value of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22 score, country and primary tumour 
type). Patients with no deterioration in EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22 scores were censored at the end of 
study, cut-off date or death date. A sensitivity analysis was similar to the aforementioned main analysis, but 
it was conducted using a decrease of ≥10 points to define deterioration in QoL. 
Changes in the planned analyses 
The original statistical analysis plan (SAP) version 1.05 was approved on 06-Jul-2016. Prior to database lock 
(and  all  statistical  analyses),  the  SAP  was  amended  once;  version  2.0  was  issued  on  27-Apr-2018. 
Substantial changes to the SAP are summarized below in Table 5.

Results 
Recruitment and participant flow 
Between 24-Feb-2016 and 05-Jan-2018, 507 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned (2:1) to the 
TAS-102 group (N=337) and the placebo group (N=170). The target number of events, i.e. 384 deaths, was 
reached  on  27-Mar-2018,  which  is  thus  the  OS  data  cut-off  date.  There  occurred  11  additional  deaths 
(TAS-102:  9;  placebo:  2)  in  the  time  period  between  these  two  dates,.  The  cut-off  date  for  all  other 
(non-OS) clinical data was 31-Mar-2018. Median duration of survival follow-up was 10.7 months (TAS-102: 
10.6 months; placebo: 10.7 months). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/479870/2019 
Page 25/88 
 
  
  
A  total  of  625  patients  provided  signed  informed  consent  for  participation  in  the  study.  Of  these,  118 
(18.9%) were screened but not randomized primarily (111/118 = 94%) due to screen failures. Of the 507 
patients randomized (ITT population), 337 were assigned to TAS-102 and 170 were assigned to placebo.  
Four patients (2 patients in each treatment group) did not receive study treatment. In the TAS-102 group, 
1  patient  died  (before  having  received  treatment)  and  1  had  a  protocol  violation;  both  patients  in  the 
placebo group withdrew consent (before having received treatment). The patient flow is depicted below in 
Figure 2 (alternatively see Figure 1 of Shitara, 2018).

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original study protocol was issued on 30-Jun-2015. Substantial changes to the protocol (including e.g. 
the addition of QoL to the [other] secondary endpoints) are described in order of issuance in Table 6.

Summary of substantial changes in the protocol 
Protocol deviations 
A CSR reportable protocol deviation was related to inclusion/exclusion criteria, conduct of the trial, patient 
management or patient assessments that impact the safety of the patients or jeopardize the quality of the 
study data. In addition, among all CSR reportable protocol deviations, a set of “major protocol deviations” 
was defined as a means to measure adherence to key aspects of the protocol using pre-specified sensitivity 
analyses. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/479870/2019 
Page 27/88 
 
  
  
 
 
The occurrence of any major protocol deviation was similar between the treatment arms (TAS-102: 2.7%; 
placebo:  2.4%),  see  Table  7.  The  patient  in  the  placebo  arm  who  had  received  “Other  concurrent 
chemotherapy … while receiving study treatment” had received ramucirumab. 
Overall, 60 (17.8%) patients in the TAS-102 group and 14 (8.2%) patients in the placebo group had CSR 
reportable  (non-major)  deviations.  Thirty-nine  patients  (11.6%)  in  the  TAS-102  treatment  group  and  4 
patients  (2.4%)  in  the  placebo  group  received  the  wrong  treatment  or  incorrect  dose,  thus  43  patients 
overall. Of note, “wrong treatment” did not mean that a patient received TAS-102 instead of placebo or the 
other way round. Of these 43 patients, in 31 patients (in 2 of whom the event occurred twice), the dose of 
study medication was not held even though the ANC was below 1.5 x 109/L prior to dosing. In 6 patients (in 
one of whom it occurred 4 times), the patient took the wrong dose. In 4 patients, the height or weight was 
recorded incorrectly leading to a wrong BSA calculation. In 2 patients the wrong kit was given and in 2 
patients the kits were not returned. Of note, for 2 patients, more than 1 reason than the RD3 category was 
assessed.

Table 11. 
Prior anti-cancer treatment for metastatic disease (ITT population) 
All patients in both treatment arms had received ≥2 prior systemic treatment regimens. The percentage of 
patients that had received ≥2 prior treatment regimens for metastatic disease was 96.1% in the TAS-102 
arm vs. 98.8% in the placebo arm. The median number of prior treatment regimens for metastatic disease 
was 3 (range 1-9) vs. 3 (range 1-5), respectively. Nearly all patients in both circumstances had received 
prior fluoropyrimidine and prior platinum, and approximately 90% had received prior taxane therapy. Over 
half of patients (in both circumstances) had received prior irinotecan. 
The  most  frequently  reported  most  recent  regimens  prior  to  randomization  for  the  ITT  population  were 
taxane (48.7%), fluoropyrimidine (32.3%), irinotecan (32.9%), and platinum (20.3%). Most patients were 
refractory to their last regimen prior to randomization, i.e. 85.4% - 98.2% across these regimens. 
Prior and concomitant other medication 
Other  prior  medication  use  was  reported  by  85.1%  of  patients  in  the  TAS-102  group  and  86.9%  in  the 
placebo  group.  The  most frequently  reported prior  medications  (≥20%)  were  in  the  WHO  ATC  Level  III 
categories of drugs for peptic ulcer  and gastroesophageal reflux disease (49.3%), opioids (25.2%), and 
antithrombotic agents (21.1%). 
Concomitant medication use was reported by 90.1% of patients in the TAS-102 group and 84.5% in the 
placebo group. The most frequently reported concomitant medications (≥20%) were in the WHO ATC Level 
III categories of opioids (31.0%), drugs for peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux disease (28.8%), other 
analgesics and antipyretics (21.1%), and propulsives (20.1%) 
The use of any supportive blood product and/or growth factor was reported for 30.7% of patients in the 
TAS-102  and  7.1%  in  the  placebo  group.  In  the  TAS-102  and  placebo  groups,  respectively,  supportive 
products  for  neutropenia  were  reported  for  17.3%  and  1.8%  of  patients,  supportive  products  for 
thrombocytopenia were reported for 0.9% and 0%, and supportive products for anaemia were reported for 
18.2% and 5.4%.

Post-discontinuation anti-cancer treatment 
Per protocol, there was no unblinding at the time of disease progression. The use of post-discontinuation 
anti-cancer therapy (PDT) was not specified per protocol. PDT for the ITT population is shown below in Table 
12.  PDT  included  amongst  others  ramucirumab,  immunotherapy  (including  nivolumab),  irinotecan,  and 
paclitaxel. The proportion of patients receiving systemic PDT was similar between arms (24.6% vs. 26.5%), 
as  were  the  proportions  of  patients  for  whom  PDT  included  ramucirumab  (3.3%  vs.  2.4%)  or 
immunotherapy (4.5% vs. 4.7%).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint (overall survival [OS]) 
Primary analysis 
The planned interim  analysis was performed  at 220 death events (refer to section  Ancillary  analysis  for 
results).  Neither  the  efficacy  nor  futility  boundaries  were  met  for  any  of  the  analyses  and  the  DMC 
recommended to continue the study until completion, per protocol. 
Treatment with TAS-102 resulted in a statistically significant improvement in OS compared to placebo (Table 
14 and Figure 3), with a HR of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.560, 0.855; 1-sided p=0.0003 (boundary for final analysis 
1-sided alpha=0.0215); stratified log-rank test) corresponding to a 31% reduction in the risk of death in the 
TAS-102 group. The mOS was 5.7 months (95% CI: 4.8, 6.2) for the TAS-102 group vs. 3.6 months (95% 
CI: 3.1, 4.1) for the placebo group (∆ +2.1 months). The median duration of survival follow-up was 10.6 
months for the TAS-102 group and 10.7 months for the placebo group.

Sensitivity analyses 
The following sensitivity analyses were performed for OS: 
-  Analysis  1:  Non-stratified log-rank test (that is, only treatment effect in the model) for the ITT 
population. 
-  Analysis 2: ITT population excluding patients not meeting inclusion criteria #2 or #3 (see section 
Study participants above). 
-  Analysis 3: ITT population excluding patients with major protocol deviations. 
-  Analysis 4: Based on CRF-designated stratification factors for the AT population. 
-  Analysis 5: By treatment group for the AT population. 
-  Analysis 6: Excluding sites with high accrual. 
-  Analysis 7: Using the date of all collected events (deaths) and survival status as of 30-Apr-2018. 
An overview of the results of these analyses is provided below in Table 15.

Multivariate  analyses  of potential prognostic factors for  OS  were  performed. The factors included the 
stratification factors region, ECOG status at baseline, and prior treatment with ramucirumab, as well as age 
group (<65 vs. ≥65 years), race, gender, number of prior regimens, prior treatment with a taxane, prior 
treatment with irinotecan, previous gastrectomy, gastroesophageal junction involvement, metastatic site 
(peritoneal,  liver,  lung),  number  of  metastatic  sites,  measurable  disease,  histology  subtype,  and  HER2 
status at baseline. Stepwise selection was performed to identify the final subset of prognostic/predictive 
factors: treatment, region, ECOG status at baseline, prior treatment with ramucirumab, age group (<65 vs. 
≥65 years), number of prior regimens, number of metastatic sites, histology subtype, and HER2 status at 
baseline. In the resulting final Cox proportional  hazard  model, none of the listed factors were shown to 
modify the effect of treatment (all interaction p-values were >0.24). The multivariate model estimate for the 
HR  for  TAS-102  relative  to  placebo  remained  at  0.69  (95%  CI:  0.560,  0.851;  p  =  0.0005),  which  is

A forest plot summarizing the stratified subgroup analyses for OS in the ITT population is presented in Figure 
1. The only subgroup analysis that is not included in this figure is the one for prior immunotherapy: 
- 
Yes: events/patients = 18/25 vs. 6/7; HR=0.22 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.86); mOS 6.0 vs. 3.5 months. 
-  No:  events/patients  =  226/312  vs.  134/163;  HR=0.71  (95%  CI:  0.57,  0.88);  mOS  5.7  vs.  3.6

Secondary endpoints 
Progression-free survival (PFS) 
Treatment  with  TAS-102  resulted  in  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  PFS  compared  to  placebo 
(Table 16 and Figure 5), with a HR of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.467, 0.701; p<0.0001 [2-sided]; stratified log-rank 
test), corresponding to a 43% reduction in the risk of disease progression in the TAS-102 group. The mPFS 
was 2.0 months (95% CI: 1.9, 2.3) for the TAS-102 group vs. 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.7, 1.9) for the placebo 
group (∆ +0.2 months).

Kaplan-Meier curve of progression-free survival (ITT population) 
The following sensitivity analyses were performed for PFS: 
-  Analysis 1: Including clinical progression as a progression event. 
-  Analysis  2: Including clinical progression and initiation of new antitumor therapy as progression 
events. 
-  Analysis  3:  Including  clinical  progression,  initiation  of  new  antitumor  therapy,  and  all  deaths 
without censoring missed visits. 
-  Analysis 4: Excluding sites with high accrual. 
-  Analysis  5: Analysis of time to first, second and third radiological tumour assessments from the 
date of randomization. 
An overview of the results of the first four of these analyses is provided below in Table 17. The results of 
Analysis 5 are not shown, but these confirmed that the assessments were performed to schedule and that 
timing was similar among the two arms.

Tumour response (ORR and DCR) 
As shown is Table 18, the ORR (CR + PR) was numerically higher for the TAS-102 arm when compared to the 
placebo arm (4.5% vs. 2.1%, respectively; ∆ +2.4% [95% CI: -0.9, 5.7]; p=0.2833). The median duration 
of response (DoR) was 3.7 months for the 13 responders in the TAS-102 group vs. 3.8 months for the 3 
responders in the placebo group (p=0.4506 [1-sided]). 
A statistically significant improvement was observed in the DCR (CR + PR + SD) for the TAS-102 arm when 
compared to the placebo arm (44.1% vs. 14.5%, respectively; ∆ +29.7% [95% CI: 21.6, 37.7], p<0.0001).

Time to deterioration to ECOG PS ≥2 
In the ITT population, treatment with TAS-102 resulted in a statistically significant increase in the median 
time to deterioration to ECOG PS ≥2 compared to placebo (HR=0.69; 95% CI: 0.562, 0.854; p=0.0005 
[2-sided]). The median time to deterioration to ECOG PS ≥2 was 4.3 months (95% CI:  3.7, 4.7) in the 
TAS-102 arm vs. 2.3 months (95% CI: 2.0, 2.8) in the placebo arm. 
A sensitivity analysis was performed, using only on therapy ECOG assessments for analysis, i.e. excluding 
deaths during the survival follow-up period. For this analysis, 214/337 patients (63.5%) in the TAS-102 arm 
were censored and 90/170 patients (52.9%) in the placebo arm. The median time to ECOG PS ≥2 was 5.5 
months  in  the  TAS-102  arm  (95%  CI:  4.4,  6.9)  vs.  2.2  months  (95%  CI:  1.9,  3.0)  in  the  placebo  arm 
(HR=0.54; 95% CI: 0.404, 0.721; p<0.0001 [2-sided]). 
Time to deterioration of quality of life 
Quality of life (QoL) was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22. Table 19 shows a summary 
of the absolute values and change from baseline in QoL scales for the ITT population. It can be seen that QoL 
was balanced at baseline, and that there were no (mean/median) changes ≥10 points in overall QoL from 
baseline up to cycle 3 in either treatment group. The number (and percentage) of patients completing the 
questionnaires decreased with each cycle, as the compliance (for the EORTC QLQ-C30 - global health status) 
was at cycle 1, 84.9% in the TAS-102 arm vs. 78.7% in the placebo arm, at cycle 2, 57.8% vs. 36%, and at 
cycle  3,  37.3%  vs.  14%,  respectively.  Conversely,  at  cycle  3,  in  the  TAS-102  arm  209/330  (63.3%)  of 
EORTC QLQ-C30 - global health status values was missing vs. 140/163 (85.9%) in the placebo arm, and 
these percentages increased further thereafter.

Summary  of  absolute  values  and  change  from  baseline  in  QoL  scales  (ITT 
No statistically significant differences in the time  to  deterioration  of  QoL scores between TAS-102 and 
placebo groups were observed. Treatment with TAS-102 resulted in a numerically longer median time to 
deterioration by ≥5 points in global health status using the QoL questionnaires compared to placebo. The 
median  time  to  deterioration  was  2.6  months  (95%  CI:  2.3,  3.3)  in  the  TAS-102  arm  (N=288  for  this 
analysis) vs. 2.3 months (95% CI: 1.4, not available [NA]) in the placebo arm (N=130) (HR=1.27; 95% CI: 
0.854,  1.875;  p=0.2350  [2-sided]).  A  sensitivity  analysis  using  a  decrease  of  ≥10  (and  with  the  same 
patient numbers in both treatment arms) showed similar results, as the median time to deterioration was 
5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8, NA) in the TAS-102 arm (N=288) vs. 4.6 months (95% CI: 2.2, NA) in the placebo 
arm (N=130; HR=0.97; 95% CI: 0.635, 1.470; p=0.8709 [2-sided]). 
Ancillary analyses 
The interim analysis (see section Statistical methods above) was performed based on 220 events (deaths) 
reported  as  of  31-Aug-2017  and  the  associated  efficacy  boundary  suggested to  the  DMC  was  a  1-sided 
p-value of 0.0031 and the associated futility boundary was OS HR ≥0.95. The observed HR, based on 200 
events,  was  0.7321  (95%  CI:  0.5540,  0.9676;  1-sided  p-value  0.0138).  The  associated  mOS  was  5.7 
months for the TAS-102 group and 3.8 months for the placebo group. An additional sensitivity analysis was 
presented based on all events (deaths) reported as of the date of the 192nd death (194 deaths were reported 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/479870/2019

as of that date). The corresponding efficacy boundary for the sensitivity analysis was 1-sided p-value of 
0.0016.  Neither  the  efficacy  nor  futility  boundaries  were  met  for  any  of  the  analyses  and  the  DMC 
recommended to continue the study until completion, per protocol. Considering the alpha-spending that 
took place for the interim analysis, the associated efficacy boundary for the final analysis (assuming 384 
events as planned) is 1-sided p-value of 0.0215.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Dose selection 
The proposed TAS-102 starting dose in adult patients with mGC is 35 mg/m2 administered BID PO on days 
1 to 5 and days 8 to 12 of each 28-day cycle, which is to be continued as long as benefit is observed or until 
unacceptable toxicity occurs. This posology is identical to that previously accepted for treatment of adult 
patients with mCRC, in which the 35 mg/m2 dose was selected based on tolerability in patients with mCRC 
and other solid tumours. Though the support of the dose in mGC patients is limited, especially with regard 
to efficacy, no apparent differences are observed with respect to safety between mCRC and mGC patients 
treated at the proposed dose. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study design. The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design that was used in the pivotal study 
TAS-102-302 is considered adequate to evaluate the benefits and risks of TAS-102 in patients with mGC 
refractory to standard treatments, i.e. in the third- and later-line treatment setting. The choice for OS as the 
primary  endpoint  of  the  pivotal  study  is  considered  appropriate.  Firstly,  as  convincingly  demonstrated 
favourable  effects  on  OS  are  from  both  a  clinical  and  methodological  perspective  the  most  persuasive 
outcome of a clinical trial (EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.5). Secondly, it is considered appropriate specifically for 
this target patient population, considering the short life expectancy. The study design also included the key 
secondary endpoint PFS and the other secondary endpoints ORR and DCR. All these imaging endpoints were 
assessed by the investigators according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. No (blinded) central evaluation of imaging 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/479870/2019

was  performed.  As  OS  was  the  primary  endpoint  and  the  effect  on  OS  will  be  most  important  in  the 
assessment of efficacy, this lack of central evaluation of imaging for the imaging endpoints is considered 
acceptable. 
Various second-line treatment options are used sequentially in second- and third-line in clinical practice for 
the  small  proportion  of  GC  patients  that  is  eligible  for  third-line  treatment.  On  this  matter,  the  ESMO 
guidelines concur, but indicates caution that “there is no clear evidence for a benefit beyond second-line 
treatment” (Smyth, 2016). 
According to the study protocol, QoL assessments were performed prior to study treatment administration in 
each cycle. However, the applicant was not able to confirm that the QoL questionnaires were completed at 
the beginning of each visit, prior to any clinical activities (i.e. before any extensive contact and consultation 
with  study  site  personnel).  As  a  result,  the  patient  responses  may  have  been  biased,  as  e.g.  medical 
information could bias retrospective evaluation (EMA/CHMP/292464/2014). 
Patient  population.  The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the pivotal study appear overall acceptable. 
The  patient  population  enrolled  in  study  TAS-102-302  appears  to  be  a  somewhat  selected  population 
compared to patients with mGC treated in clinical practice in the sense that patients had to have an ECOG PS 
≤1.  Certainly  not  all  European  patients  with  mGC  after  first-line  systemic  treatment  are  expected  to 
demonstrate  a  score  ≤1,  whereas  over  one  third  of  enrolled  patients  even  had  a  score  of  0.  This  is 
adequately reflected by the current proposed text in the SmPC. 
Statistical analysis. Analyses were performed as outlined in the SAP and were appropriate given the type 
of endpoints. The IA was performed at a slightly higher number of events than planned, but the efficacy 
boundary for the final analysis was adjusted accordingly. 
It is noted that for the analysis of ORR and DCR the TR population was used instead of the ITT population. 
This  analysis  may  be  biased  as  it  only  included  patients  with  at  least  one  post-baseline  assessment. 
However, given the low number of responders (TAS-102: 13; placebo: 3) this issue is considered not worth 
pursuing. 
For the endpoint time to deterioration of QoL, patients with no deterioration in the QoL scores were censored 
at death date. The applicant later provided the results of additional sensitivity analyses wherein death was 
included  as  an  event,  and  the  results  of  these  analyses  were  consistent  with  the  results  of  the  original 
analyses. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The demographics and other baseline characteristics were in general reasonably well balanced between both 
treatment  arms,  and  no  particularities  were  observed.  There  were  amongst  others  slightly  more  males, 
slightly more patients ≥75 years of age, slightly more white patients, and slightly more patients with an 
ECOG PS of 1 in the TAS-102 arm (n=337) when compared to the placebo arm (n=170). The number of 
enrolled patients from the EU was 277 (54.6% of the ITT population; 180 in the TAS-102 arm and 97 in the 
placebo arm). The region subgroup analyses for OS and PFS  were consistent.  
The baseline disease characteristics were in general reasonably well balanced between both treatment arms 
as well. It is noted that over half of the enrolled patients’ tumours had the histology subtype “Unknown” or 
“Not  applicable”.  Importantly,  the  efficacy  of  TAS-102  does  not  appear  to  differ  (much)  between  the 
histology subtypes “Diffused”, “Intestinal”, and “Unknown or NA”, see  Figure 1 and Figure 6 above. The 
performed  multivariate  sensitivity  analysis  (for  OS)  in  which  adjustment  was  made  for  possible 
prognostic baseline factors, showed a result (HR) fully in line with the primary OS analysis. Therefore, the 
slight imbalances in possible prognostic baseline factors apparently did not have a relevant impact on the 
primary efficacy analysis.

Of  the  ITT  population,  43.6%  had  undergone  a  prior  gastrectomy.  This  percentage  is  similar  to  the 
percentages reported in other recent studies in mGC that enrolled a mostly non-Asian patient population 
(Cyramza EPAR: 26.8% and 37.1%; Shitara, 2018: 36.8%). 
Ramucirumab, an approved second-line treatment, had  been  used by only  33.3%  of patients in the ITT 
population. However, ramucirumab treatment was a stratification factor, and similar proportions of patients 
in each treatment group had received it. Moreover, efficacy did not differ much between patients that did 
and patients that did not receive prior ramucirumab treatment. 
Remarkably, the HER2 status at baseline was not  known/available for almost one in five patients in the 
pivotal  study  (i.e.  19.5%).  Furthermore,  in  spite  of  inclusion  criterion  #3  (sub.  a.)  not  all  patients  with 
HER2+ tumours had received previous anti-HER2 therapy. Use of previous anti-HER2 therapy might not 
have been available to all patients or possible in some patients because of comorbid conditions (e.g., cardiac 
disease). Reasons for withholding anti-HER2 therapy were not gathered. The abovementioned multivariate 
sensitivity analysis did identify baseline HER2 status as a prognostic/predictive factor. As HER2+ status in 
GC may be associated with a worse prognosis (van Cutsem, 2016), and more patients in the TAS-102 arm 
than  in  the  placebo  arm  were  baseline  HER2+,  this  factor  is  unlikely  to  have  positively  influenced  the 
TAS-102 efficacy results. Not surprisingly, prior anti-HER2 therapy was also more frequent in the TAS-102 
arm, but efficacy did not seem to be dependent on baseline HER2 status. 
Considering  the  demographics  and  other  baseline  (disease)  characteristics,  there  are  overall  no  critical 
issues  regarding  the  enrolled  patient  population,  which  appears  reasonably  representative  of  the 
to-be-treated patient population in clinical practice, apart from the remark made above on ECOG PS. 
Primary endpoint – OS. The effect of TAS-102 on OS relative to placebo resulted a HR of 0.69 (95% CI: 
0.560, 0.855,; p=0.0003), with mOS of 5.7 months for TAS-102 versus 3.6 months for placebo, reflecting 
an increase in mOS of 2.1 months. The results of all sensitivity analyses were consistent with this primary 
analysis of OS. Moreover, there were no notable differences between arms in terms of the proportion of 
patients receiving PDT and/or the type(s) of PDT received, which adds robustness to the study results. 
In the subgroup analyses the OS HRs almost consistently favoured the TAS-102 group, e.g. the number of 
prior (systemic) treatment regimens and the primary tumour site (GEJ vs. gastric) had little effect on the HR 
point estimate. 
The  only  two  exceptions  (of  the  49  subgroups  examined)  were  the  subgroups  of  patients  who  had  not 
received  prior  taxane  therapy  and  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  well  differentiated  tumours.  For  both 
subgroups the number of patients was limited (<10% of the ITT population) and the PFS HR did favour the 
TAS-102  arm,  which  speaks  in  favour  of  these  exceptions  likely  being  chance  findings.  Moreover,  an 
additional unstratified sensitivity analysis showed an OS HR of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.97) in the subgroup of 
patients with no prior taxane use, and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.49, 1.95) in the patients with well differentiated 
tumours. 
A (prior) gastrectomy could alter the PK and pharmacodynamics of orally administered chemotherapeutic 
agents such as TAS-102 (Shitara, 2018). Unfortunately, PK data were not recorded in this study. The PK of 
TAS-102 were assessed in the phase 2 EPOC1201 study and moreover compared between patients who had 
undergone a gastrectomy and those who had not (Bando, 2016). There were no significant differences in the 
peak serum drug concentration (Cmax), area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC), and/or 
time of peak serum drug concentration (Tmax) values for FTD and TPI at the 35 mg/m2 BID dosage when 
three  patients  with  and  three  patients  without  a  prior  gastrectomy  were  compared,  and  in  another  six 
patients (two with, four without prior gastrectomy) at the 40 mg/m2 dose. Despite the fact that this PK data 
is obtained from a relatively small number of patients, data do not point at the existence of major differences 
in FTD and/or TPI PK between patients with or without a prior gastrectomy. The fact that no relevant pH 
dependence of FTD and/or TPI PK is known intuitively supports this assumption. Reassuring is that both in 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 49/88 
 
  
  
patients that did undergo a prior gastrectomy (HR=0.57; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.79) as well as in patients that did 
not (HR=0.80; 95% CI: 0.60, 1.06), the OS HR favoured the TAS-102 group. Also, the above-mentioned 
multivariate sensitivity analysis did not identify (no) prior gastrectomy as a prognostic/predictive factor, and 
the PFS HR in the ‘no prior gastrectomy’ subgroup did statistically significantly favour the TAS-102 arm. 
Numerically  a  2.1-month  mOS  benefit  may  seem  rather  limited,  especially  because  the  enrolled  patient 
population appears to be a somewhat selected population compared to patients with mGC treated in clinical 
practice (which e.g. may be more frail with a higher ECOG PS and possibly with more comorbidity). On the 
other hand, in Europe there is currently no therapy with proven OS or other clinical benefit. Therefore, in 
combination  with  the  overall  poor  prognosis  of  mGC  patients,  the  observed  gain  in  mOS  is  considered 
clinically relevant. 
Key secondary endpoint – PFS. A statistically significant benefit was also shown for the key secondary 
endpoint PFS. Treatment with TAS-102 when compared to placebo resulted in a HR of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.467, 
0.701;  p<0.0001),  with  mPFS  of  2.0  months  for  TAS-102  versus  1.8  months  for  placebo,  reflecting  an 
increase in mPFS of 0.2 months. The results of all relevant sensitivity analyses were consistent with this 
primary analysis of PFS. Of note, as is stated above, the primary analysis of PFS was not in accordance with 
EMA guidance, but one of the sensitivity analyses was and it showed consistent results. 
In the subgroup analyses the PFS HRs favoured the TAS-102 group across all subgroups examined. 
The observed PFS result does provide support for the observed OS result. 
Other  secondary  endpoints  –  ORR  and  DCR.    The  ORR  was  numerically  (but  not  statistically 
significantly)  higher  in  patients  in  the  TAS-102  arm  as  compared  to  the  placebo  arm  (4.5%  vs.  2.1%, 
respectively, p=0.2833). Due to the many patients with SD in the TAS-102 arm, there was a statistically 
significant improvement in the DCR when compared to the placebo arm (44.1% vs. 14.5%, respectively; 
p<0.0001). These results are in line with the OS data. 
Other secondary endpoint – time to deterioration to ECOG PS ≥2. Treatment with TAS-102 resulted 
in a statistically significant increase in the median time to deterioration to ECOG PS ≥2 compared to placebo 
(HR=0.69;  95%  CI:  0.562,  0.854;  p=0.0005;  4.3  vs.  2.3  months,  respectively).  This  is  considered  a 
relevant outcome from the clinical point of view, supportive of the overall good tolerability and acceptable 
safety profile of TAS-102 in this clinical context. 
Other secondary endpoint – time to deterioration of QoL. No statistically significant differences in the 
time  to  deterioration  of  QoL  scores  (by  ≥5  or  ≥10  points)  between  TAS-102  and  placebo  groups  were 
observed. More importantly however, the QoL assessment was severely hampered by the rapidly declining 
compliance and (as a result) many missing values in both treatment arms,  even though this is in part a 
reflection of the high rate of progression and therefore not unexpected. Therefore, no clear conclusions can 
be made on the basis of the QoL data submitted.   
Special  populations.  Paediatric  patients:  The  EMA  confirmed  the  applicability  of  the  class  waiver  for 
TAS-102 in GC. No data in paediatric patients have thus been submitted. Elderly patients: the pivotal study 
included 228 (45.0%) patients ≥65 and 69 (13.6%) patients ≥75 years of age. The OS subgroup analyses 
showed that efficacy (i.e. the HR) was similar regardless of age category, see Figure 4. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the single pivotal study, TAS-102 treatment (n=337) conferred a statistically significant, and clinically 
relevant mOS benefit of 2.1 months over placebo (n=170; HR=0.69; 5.7 vs. 3.6 months; p=0.0003) in the 
third- or later-line mGC setting. This OS result was robust and supported by a statistically significant benefit 
in PFS (HR=0.57; 2.0 vs. 1.8 months; p<0.0001), a trend in ORR (4.5% vs. 2.1%; p=0.2833), and a 
statistically significant benefit in DCR (44.1% vs. 14.5%; p<0.0001). Therefore, in spite of this being an 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

application based on a single pivotal study, the efficacy results are considered quite convincing. In addition, 
considering that there is currently no approved third- or later-line therapy for patients with mGC, and the 
non-approved therapies currently used in clinical practice are given without proof of OS benefit, the 
observed gain in mOS of 2.1 months is considered clinically relevant. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The known adverse drug reactions (ADRs) observed for Lonsurf (TAS-102) at rates ≥1/10 are neutropenia, 
leukopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. 
The safety data in the current application of TAS-102 for the treatment of mGC are derived from the pivotal 
study TAGS only. The respective study concerns a randomized, controlled, double-blind Phase 3 study in 
which the effects of TAS-102 plus best supportive care (hereafter: TAS-102) were compared with those of 
placebo plus best supportive care (hereafter: placebo) in patients with mGC who had received at least 2 prior 
regimens for advanced disease and who were refractory to or unable to tolerate their last prior therapy. 
Standard  safety  monitoring  was  performed,  and  adverse  events  (AEs)  were  graded  using  the  National 
Cancer  Institute  (NCI)  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for  Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  version  4.03.  Safety 
assessments  also  included  the  evaluation  of  laboratory  test  results,  vital  signs  measurements,  physical 
examination findings, and changes in ECOG PS score. 
Below, collected safety data on TAS-102 in the TAGS study in mGC will be compared with the known safety 
profile of TAS-102 in the RECOURSE study in mCRC (Lonsurf mCRC EPAR). The safety data cut-off for TAGS 
was 31-Mar-2018 and for RECOURSE 31-Jan-2014. 
Patient exposure 
Study  data  from  TAGS  are  presented  for  the  as-treated  (AT)  population,  consisting  of  all  patients  who 
received at least one dose of study therapy. The AT population comprised of 503  patients, including 335 
patients who received TAS-102 and 168 who received placebo. 
The patient disposition at the safety data cut-off date is summarised below in Table 21. The majority of 
patients in both arms had discontinued treatment, as only 19 (5.7%) patients in the TAS-102 arm and 3 
(1.8%)  patients  in  the  placebo  arm  were  still  on  treatment.  The  most  important  reason  for  treatment 
discontinuation in both treatment groups was progression of disease (TAS-102 (73.0%), placebo (85.3%)). 
A  total  of  44  patients  (including  33  (9.9%)  in  the  TAS-102  arm  and  11  (6.5%)  in  the  placebo  arm) 
discontinued study treatment due to AEs.

a Of the deaths in the TAS-102 arm, 2 were due to AEs and 9 to disease progression; in the control arm, both 
deaths were due to disease progression. 
Overall, exposure to study treatment tended to be higher in the TAS-102 study arm (median: 6.71 weeks) 
compared to the placebo study arm (median: 5.71 weeks), see Table 22. The number of initiated cycles per 
study patient tended to be higher in TAS-102-treated study patients compared to placebo-treated study 
patients (mean 3.3 vs. 2.3 respectively).

The patients in the TAS-102 arm in the TAGS study had a similar exposure to TAS-102 when compared to the 
patients in the TAS-102 arm in the RECOURSE study. The median total number of weeks exposure was 6.71 
weeks in both studies, and the median relative dose intensity was 0.90 in the TAGS study and 0.91 in the 
RECOURSE study. 
Demographic and other characteristics of the study population 
Overall, baseline characteristics were balanced across different treatment groups in the TAGS study, see for 
ITT population Table 8. Similar baseline characteristics were observed for the AT population. For example, 
the majority of included study patients in respective study were men (TAS-102: 74.6%, placebo: 69%). 
Median age was 64 years in TAS-102 treated study patients and 62 years in placebo-treated study patients. 
More than 50% of study patients were included in Europe. Most included study patients in the TAGS study 
were Caucasians (TAS-102: 72.2%, placebo: 66.7%). 
Overall, baseline disease characteristics of the TAS-102 and placebo treatment groups were comparable in 
the TAGS study (Table 9). Performance status at baseline according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) was 1 in 63.3% of TAS-102-treated patients and 59.5% of placebo-treated patients. All other 
study patients in both treatment groups had an ECOG performance status of 0.  
Hepatic function was normal in 74.3% of patients treated with TAS-102 and 78.6% of patients treated with 
placebo. However, a slightly higher proportion of patients in the TAS-102 arm had mild hepatic impairment 
at baseline compared to the control arm (25.1% vs. 19.6%).  
Renal function at baseline was normal (i.e. creatinine clearance ≥90 ml/min) in 40.0% of patients treated 
with TAS-102 and in 40.5% of patients treated with placebo. Similar proportions of patients in the TAS-102 
and  placebo  treatment  groups  had  mild  renal 
impairment  (i.e.  creatinine  clearance  60-89 
ml/min)(respectively 42.1% and 42.3%), and more severe renal impairment (moderate impairment (i.e. 
creatinine  clearance  30-59  ml/min)  respectively  17.3%  and  16.7%,  severe  impairment  (i.e.  creatinine 
clearance <30 ml/min) 0.6% in both treatment groups).

Adverse events 
Definitions  
Per protocol, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs with onset following the first 
dose of study therapy (TAS-102 or placebo) and no more than 30 days after the last dose of study therapy. 
TEAE do not necessarily have a causal relationship to the use of study treatment. Any event considered 
“possibly,”  “probably,”  or  “definitely”  related  to  study  therapy  by  the  investigator  will  be  collectively 
described as “related”.  
A  distinction  is  made  between  “AEs  with  an  outcome  of  death  /  discontinuation”  and  “deaths  / 
discontinuations due to AEs”, specifically: 
• 
“AEs with an outcome of death / discontinuation” includes all AEs where the investigator-assigned 
outcome is “death / discontinuation.” This may include events that were simply ongoing at the time of 
death, even if the event was not a cause of death and/or discontinuation. Note: “AEs with an outcome 
of death” are synonymous with “Grade 5 (fatal) events.” 
• 
“Deaths / discontinuations due to AEs” include all deaths / discontinuation where the primary cause of 
death or discontinuation was an AE according to the investigator. 
Overview of adverse events 
In the TAGS study, 97.3% of patients in the TAS-102 arm experienced TEAEs compared to 93.5% of patients 
in the placebo arm (Table 24). Numerical proportions of treatment-related AEs were higher in the TAS-102 
treatment arm (80.9%) than in the placebo treatment arm (56.6%) as well. Overall occurrence of serious 
adverse  events  (SAEs)  was  similar  for  respective  treatment  groups  (42.7%  vs.  41.7%).  However, 
occurrence  of  treatment-related  SAEs  tended  to  be  higher  among  study  patients  treated  with  TAS-102 
(11.6%) compared to those treated with placebo (3.6%).  
Study treatment doses tended to be adjusted more frequently among TAS-102 treated patients (58.2%) 
compared to placebo treated patients (22.0%). AEs with outcome death were observed at similar rates in 
both treatment groups (TAS-102: 13.4%, placebo: 11.3%).

b “Dose modification” comprises both dose delay and dose reduction. 
Overall  occurrence  of  TEAEs  and  treatment-related  TEAEs  was  comparable  in  the  TAGS  and  RECOURSE 
study for both TAS-102 and placebo treatment (Table 24). However, occurrence of Grade ≥3 AEs, and SAEs 
for both treatment groups tended to occur more frequently in the TAGS study compared to the RECOURSE 
study. This also applies to the occurrence of AEs with outcome death during TAS-102 treatment (13.4% vs. 
3.2%),  but  not  to  the  occurrence  of  AEs  with  outcome  death  during  placebo  treatment  (11.3%  in  both 
studies).  
Common adverse events 
Nearly all of the events reported with an incidence of ≥10% were reported more often in the TAS-102 arm 
than in the placebo arm (Table 25). Among the most frequently reported events, the largest differences 
between  arms  were  observed  for  myelosuppressive  AEs  (specifically,  neutropenia  /  neutrophil  count 
decreased,  anaemia,  and  leukopenia).  Modest  differences  were  observed  between  arms  (with  higher 
incidence  in  the  TAS-102  arm)  for  some  gastrointestinal  disorders  including  nausea,  vomiting,  and 
diarrhoea, and fatigue.  
Grade  ≥3  events  reported  with  the  highest  incidence  in  the  TAS-102  arm  of  TAGS  were  neutropenia 
(23.3%), anaemia (18.8%), and neutrophil count decreased (11.3%). In each of these cases, the incidence 
of  Grade  ≥3  events  was  higher  in  the  TAS-102  than  the  placebo  arm.  The  only  preferred  term  with  an 
incidence of Grade ≥3 events greater than 5% in the TAS-102 arm of TAGS that is not already shown in 
Table 25 was general physical health deterioration (incidence of Grade ≥3 events 6.6% in the TAS-102 arm 
vs. 8.9% in the placebo arm).

In both the TAGS and RECOURSE study, TEAEs tended to be reported more frequently in study patients 
treated  with  TAS-102  compared  to  those  treated  with  placebo.  More  specifically,  myelosuppressive  AEs 
(anaemia (44.5% vs. 40.5%), neutropenia/ neutrophil count decreased (38.5/15.2% vs. 29.3/27.8%), and 
leukopenia (17.0 vs. 5.4%)) were reported more frequently in patients treated with TAS-102 in the TAGS 
study compared to the RECOURSE study.

Consistent  with  known  safety  profile  of  TAS-102,  treatment-related  AEs  in  the  TAS-102  arm  were 
predominantly myelosuppressive and gastrointestinal in nature. 
(Severe)  treatment-related  AEs  tended  to  be  reported  more  frequently  in  study  patients  treated  with 
TAS-102  compared  to  placebo-treated  patients,  both  in  the  TAGS  and  RECOURSE  study.  In  general, 
treatment-related  AEs  were  reported  less  frequently  in  TAS-102  treated  patients  in  the  TAGS  study 
compared to the RECOURSE study (80.9% vs. 85.7%). Leukopenia (15.5% vs. 4.7%), thrombocytopenia 
(8.4% vs. 5.6%), and lymphopenia (5.4% vs. 0.6%) however were reported more frequently in the TAGS 
study compared to the RECOURSE study. 
Deaths/serious adverse event/other significant events 
Two analyses of death on study are presented in this section. The first summarises all deaths that occurred 
on study or within 30 days after the last dose of study therapy, with the primary cause of death as identified 
by the investigator. The second summarizes all AEs with an outcome of death, whether or not those AEs 
were the primary cause of death.  
Summary of deaths with primary cause per investigator assessment 
As  of  31-Mar-2018,  a  total  of  395  deaths  were  reported.  A  total  of  104  patients  died  while  on  study 
treatment or within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment (Table 27). As shown in this table, the 
majority of on-study deaths in both arms were due to disease progression. 
In total, there were 16 deaths on study treatment or within 30 days after last dose for which an AE was 
identified by the investigator as the primary cause of death (14 in the TAS-102 arm (4.2%); 2 in the control 
arm (1.2%)). Of these 16 events, 1 was considered at least possibly related to study therapy in the opinion 
of the investigator (1 event of toxic hepatitis in the control arm). 
In  addition,  there  was  1  death  in  the  TAS-102  arm  for  which  the  cause  of  death  was  identified  by  the 
investigator  as  “Other.”  In  this  case,  the  patient  died  at  home  due  to  cardio-respiratory  arrest.  The 
investigator considered that the most probable cause of death was progressive disease; however a possible 
relationship to the study medication cannot be excluded. Upon review of the case, the applicant assessed 
that the underlying cause of death was most likely progression of GC and not the study medication. In view 
of the applicant, no safety signal was identified upon review of these cases.

Summary of adverse events with outcome death 
AEs with an outcome of death reported for more than 0.5% of patients in the TAS-102 arm of TAGS (that is, 
for more than 1 patient) are summarized in  Table 28. Respective AEs were observed in 13.4% of study 
patients treated with TAS-102 and in 11.3% of study patients treated with placebo. General physical health 
deterioration  was  the  most  common  AEs  with  outcome  death  in  both  study  treatment  groups  (TAS-102 
5.1%, placebo 11.3%).  
There were 3 patients who experienced pulmonary embolism with an outcome of death in the TAS-102 arm 
of TAGS (0.9%), versus 0 in the placebo arm. In all three cases, the investigator assessed the events of 
pulmonary  embolism  to  be  related  to  patient’s  underlying  disease  and  not  to  TAS-102.  In  addition,  3 
different patients experienced septic shock with an outcome of death in the TAS-102 arm of TAGS versus 0 
in the placebo arm. None of these 3 events were assessed as related to TAS-102 by the investigator. In 1 of 
these  cases (case 961-003), the patient developed pancytopenia post initiation of TAS-102. Though the 
investigator did not assess this case to be related to TAS-102, the applicant assessed that a causal role of 
TAS-102 for the event of septic shock cannot be excluded, since pancytopenia could be a risk factor for 
developing infections.

The occurrence of AEs with outcome death upon TAS-102 treatment tended to be higher in the TAGS study 
(13.4%) compared to the RECOURSE study (3.2%). Occurrence of AEs with outcome death upon placebo 
treatment was however similar in both studies (11.3%).

Other serious adverse events 
SAEs reported for >1% of patients in the TAS-102 arm of TAGS are summarized in Table 29. The incidence 
of SAEs was similar between arms (42.7% vs. 41.7% for the TAS-102 and control arms, respectively). The 
most  common  SAE  in  both  arms  was  general  physical  health  deterioration,  generally  secondary  to 
progression of disease; this preferred term was reported for 6.3% of patients in the TAS-102 arm and 8.9% 
of patients in the control arm. SAEs at an incidence  of >1% in the TAS-102  treatment  group that  were 
reported more than 1% more frequently in the TAS-102 treatment group compared to the placebo treatment 
group in the TAGS study were anaemia (3.9% vs. 2.4%), pancytopenia (2.1% vs. 0%), (febrile) neutropenia 
(1.2% vs. 0%), neutropenic sepsis (1.2% vs. 0%), vomiting (2.7% vs. 0.6%), and diarrhoea (1.8% vs. 
0%),  i.e.  myelosuppressive  and  gastro-intestinal  AEs.  These  AEs  also  tended  to  be  observed  more 
frequently in the TAS-102 arm compared to the placebo arm in previous RECOURSE study.

Treatment-related SAEs were reported for 11.6% of patients in the TAS-102 treatment group and 3.6% in 
the placebo group (Table 30). The only treatment-related SAE occurring at an incidence of ≥2.0% in either 
treatment group was pancytopenia (2.1% in the TAS-102 arm vs. 0% in the control arm; all Grade 3 or 
higher). Related SAEs affecting more than 1 patient (≥0.6%) in the TAS-102  arm of TAGS were almost 
entirely myelosuppressive or gastrointestinal in nature. Similar trends were observed in previous RECOURSE 
study.

Other significant events 
Adverse events of special interest 
AEs  of  special  interest  include  myelosuppressive  (neutropenia,  anaemia,  thrombocytopenia,  leukopenia) 
and gastrointestinal AEs (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), which are known adverse reactions of TAS-102. 
Myelosuppression 
An overview of myelosuppressive AEs and laboratory abnormalities is provided in Table 31.  
Haematologic  AEs/  laboratory  abnormalities  were  generally  manageable  when  they  occurred.  Patients 
affected by neutropenia Grade 3 or 4 had a median time to recovery (i.e. to Grade <2 or ≤ baseline Grade) 
of 8 days. In TAGS, haematologic AEs with an outcome of treatment discontinuation were reported for only 
4 patients (1.2%) in the TAS-102 arm: 1 patient with Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, 1 patient with Grade 3 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

thrombocytopenia, 1 patient with Grade 3 anaemia, and 1 patient with both Grade 4 neutropenia and Grade 
4 thrombocytopenia. 
The incidence of febrile neutropenia was low (n=6 [1.8%] in the TAS-102 arm, vs. 0 in the placebo arm). All 
cases of febrile neutropenia resolved with supportive treatment and none necessitated discontinuation of 
study therapy.  
A total of 4 additional patients (1.2%) experienced events of neutropenic sepsis (Grade 3 in all cases). While 
all of these patients resolved/recovered with supportive treatment, the event of neutropenic sepsis had an 
outcome of treatment discontinuation for 2 patients (0.6%).  
Supportive treatment (mainly granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF]) for neutropenia was required 
for 58 patients in the TAS-102 arm (17.3%) and 3 patients in the placebo arm (1.8%).

Overall incidences of all event types with respect to myelosuppression were higher in the TAS-102 arm than 
in the placebo arm and similar in trend compared to RECOURSE study. Reported AE rates tended to be lower 
in the TAGS study compared to the RECOURSE study. Moreover, differences between TAS-102 and placebo 
treatment  tended  to  be  smaller  in  the  TAGS  study  compared  to  the  RECOURSE  study  (e.g.  difference 
TAS-102 and placebo for leukopenia: 21.3% (23.3 vs. 1.9%) in TAGS study, 32.2% (32.6 vs. 0.4%) in 
RECOURSE study). Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor during TAS-102 treatment was required in 17.3%

of study patients in the TAGS study compared to 9.4% of study patients in the RECOURSE study (Lonsurf 
mCRC EPAR). 
To further assess the significance of neutropenia in TAGS, AEs in the System Organ Class (SOC) of Infections 
and  Infestations  are  summarised  in  Table  32.  As  shown,  the  absolute  occurrence  of  events  of  this type 
(included related events) was higher in the TAS-102 arm than in the placebo arm. The most common events 
reported in the TAS-102 arm of TAGS were upper respiratory tract infections (2.7%), urinary tract infections 
(2.7%),  pneumonia  (2.4%),  oral  Candidasis  (1.8%),  nasopharyngitis  (1.5%),  and  neutropenic  sepsis 
(1.2%). 
Occurrence  of  severe  (Grade  ≥3)  events  (both  4.8%),  or  events  with  an  outcome  of  treatment 
discontinuation (both 1.2%) was however similar in both treatment arms. The overall incidence of events 
with  an  outcome  of  death  was  low  in  both  arms,  and  the  difference  between  arms  with  respect  to  this 
outcome was <1%.

Gastrointestinal toxicity 
Events in the SOC of gastrointestinal disorders are summarised in Table 33. The overall incidence of events 
in this SOC tended to be higher in the TAS-102 than in the placebo arm of TAGS (72.8% vs. 67.3%). Severe 
(Grade ≥3) AEs (20.9% vs. 28.6%) and treatment discontinuation due to AEs (4.5 vs. 6.5%) did not tend to 
be higher in the TAS-102 arm compared to the placebo arm.

Events of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea are summarised in Table 34. A total of 54.9% of patients in the 
TAS-102 arm and 45.8% of patients in the placebo arm reported nausea, diarrhoea, and/or vomiting. The 
difference between arms in the incidence of Grade ≥3 events was much smaller (7.2% vs. 6.0%). Incidence 
of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea with an outcome of treatment discontinuation was similar between arms 
(1.5% vs. 1.8%). Overall, increases in the occurrence of diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting in the TAS-102 
arm  in  comparison  to  placebo  arm  is  less  pronounced  compared  to  what  was  observed  in  the  previous 
RECOURSE study (Lonsurf mCRC EPAR).

Liver impairment-related adverse events 
Events in the SOC of hepatobiliary disorders are summarized in Table 35. AEs related to liver impairment 
were reported in <10% of study patients and rarely resulted in an outcome of death (0.6% in both arms) or 
treatment discontinuation (0.6% in both arms). Similar trends had been observed in the RECOURSE study.

Renal impairment-related adverse events 
Events in the SOC of renal and urinary disorders occurred slightly more frequently in the placebo arm (6.0%) 
than in the TAS-102 arm (5.4%). Grade ≥3 events were very rare (incidence 0.3% and 1.2% in the TAS-102 
and placebo arms, respectively), and no events leading to outcomes of death or treatment discontinuation 
were reported. 
In the TAGS study, proteinuria occurred in 2 patients (0.6%) in TAS-102 arm and none in placebo arm. All 
were Grade 1 or 2. Treatment-related proteinuria occurred only in 1 patient (0.3%) in TAS-102 arm and was 
limited to a Grade 1, and none occurred in the placebo arm. 
In Table 41 the occurrence of AEs by creatinine clearance at baseline is presented.

Neutrophils 
In  the  TAS-102  arm,  88  (26.8%)  patients  experienced  Grade  3  and  37 (11.3%)  experienced  Grade 4 
neutrophil decreases, while no Grade 3 or 4 values were observed in the placebo arm. 
Median neutrophil count at the end of each cycle (last value obtained in each cycle) was lower in the TAS-102 
arm than in the placebo arm. In the TAS-102 arm, neutrophil count decreased from baseline, and remained 
relatively stable throughout the treatment period (figure 7). Of note, the number of study patients 
decreased with each subsequent study treatment cycle.

In the TAS-102 arm, the percentage of patients with elevations of ALT, AST, or both was comparable to that 
of the placebo arm (Table 37). Bilirubin elevations tended to be higher in the TAS-102 arm, with elevations 
of 1.5 x ULN reported for 14.9% (vs. 11.9% in the placebo arm) and elevations of 2 x ULN reported for 
11.6% (vs. 7.1% for the control arm). Elevation of alkaline phosphatase of 1.5 x ULN was reported for 
45.1% of the TAS-102 arm and 41.7% of the placebo arm.

Only in the TAS-102 arm, 2 patients met the laboratory criteria for Hy’s Law (ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN; total 
bilirubin ≥2 x ULN; and alkaline phosphatase <2 x ULN at the same visit) vs. no patient in the placebo arm. 
Of note, both patients had liver metastases at baseline. 
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
Vital signs and body weight 
No clinically relevant mean or median changes in body weight or vital signs were observed in either study 
treatment  group.  Median  changes  from  baseline  at  the  end  of  each  cycle  were  relatively  stable  in  both 
treatment groups over the first several treatment cycles. 
Safety in special populations and situations 
Overview 
Occurrence  of  TEAEs  by  age  (<65  years,  ≥65  years),  gender,  race,  geographic  region,  ECOG  PS,  and 
baseline creatinine clearance in the TAGS and RECOURSE study are summarised in Table 38 (Integrated 
summary of safety). In the TAGS study, occurrence of AEs was in general higher in study patients treated 
with  TAS-102  compared  to  placebo  treatment.  Occurrence  of  TEAEs  during  TAS-102  treatment  was  in 
general comparable for different patient features in the TAGS and RECOURSE study. Occurrence of TEAEs 
during both TAS-102 (98.8% vs. 96.8%) and placebo treatment (96.2% vs. 92.2%) tended to be somewhat 
higher for female study patients compared to male study patients in the TAGS study.  
Occurrence of TEAEs in both treatment groups varied among different levels of renal impairment. However, 
consistent trends were neither observed in the TAGS nor the RECOURSE study.

Analysis of safety data by age 
In TAGS, the overall incidence of AEs (regardless of Grade or relationship to study therapy) was >89% in all 
age groups (Table 39). All age categories in the TAS-102 group of TAGS reported approximately 80% of 
patients with Grade 3 or higher AEs.

In the RECOURSE study in mCRC, occurrence of AEs upon TAS-102 treatment was comparable for patients 
aged under 65 years (98.0%), patients aged 65-74 years (98.5%), and patients aged 75 years and above 
(100%).

In TAGS, the overall incidence of AEs was >92% in both male and female patients, across all treatment 
arms. In both men and women occurrence of AEs during TAS-102 treatment was higher than during placebo 
treatment (Table 40). Treatment-related AEs were reported for 79.2% of male and 85.9% of female patients 
in the TAS-102 arm, and 56.9% and 55.8%, respectively, in the placebo arm.

Occurrence of AEs (97.6% vs. 98.8%) and treatment-related AEs (85.5% vs. 85.9%) during TAS-102 
treatment was similar for respectively women and men in the RECOURSE study in mCRC. 
Analysis of safety data by ECOG PS at baseline

The rates of AEs by ECOG PS at baseline (0 vs. 1) were in alignment with those observed in the total AT 
population (Table 38). As expected, patients with an ECOG PS of 0 at baseline generally had lower rates of 
AEs than patients with a score of 1, with the exception of AEs of special interest in the TAS-102 group (ECOG 
0: 76.4%; ECOG 1: 68.4%). 
The overall incidence of AEs was >88% in both ECOG PS categories and treatment groups. For the TAS-102 
group, AEs were reported for 95.1% of patients with an ECOG PS of 0, and 98.6% of patients with a score 
of 1. For the placebo group, AEs were reported for 88.2% and 97.0%, respectively (Table 38). 
Grade ≥3 AEs in the TAS-102 group were reported for 72.4% of patients with an ECOG PS of 0, and 84.0% 
of patients with a score of 1. For the placebo group, Grade ≥3 AEs were reported for 44.1% and 67.0%, 
respectively. 
Analysis of safety data by creatinine clearance at baseline 
In TAGS, the overall incidence of AEs was >90% for patients with normal renal function, mild, and moderate 
impairment  in  both  treatment  groups  (Table  41;  Integrated  summary  of  safety).  Overall  occurrence  of 
treatment-related AEs did not  tend to increase  during TAS-102 treatment  with  increasing  rates of renal 
impairment  at  baseline  (normal  renal  function:  97.9%;  mild  renal  impairment:  97.1%;  moderate  renal 
impairment:  96.2%).  However,  AEs  in  the  system  organ  classes  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders 
(respectively  62.1%,  62.5%,  71.2%),  metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders  (respectively  37.9%,  50.0%, 
55.8%),  and  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  (respectively  13.1%,  14.0%,  15.4%)  tended  to 
increase with increasing renal impairment.

In previous RECOURSE study in mCRC, ≥ Grade 3AEs (85.1% vs. 66.7% and 70.8% respectively), serious 
AEs  (42.6%  vs.  27.5%  and  30.3%  respectively),  and  dose  delays  (38.8%  vs.  28.7%  and  26.7% 
respectively) and reductions (23.9% vs. 11.2% and 17.6% respectively) tended to occur more frequently 
during TAS-102 treatment in study patients with moderate renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance 30-59 
mL/min) compared to patients without or mild renal impairment (Lonsurf mCRC EPAR). This trend was not 
observed in the TAGS study. 
Overdose 
An AE of accidental overdose was reported for 2 study patients in the TAS-102 arm of TAGS (0.6%). 
 
One patient mistakenly received a total dose of 1900 mg during cycle 2, approximately 158% of the 
planned dose of 1200 mg. This event was recorded as a Grade 3 SAE of accidental overdose. The 
patient also experienced a treatment-related SAE of Grade 4 neutropenia on cycle 2, day 28, which led 
to  an  11-day  delay  in  the  initiation  of  cycle  3.  The  patient  also  experienced  non-serious 
treatment-related events of Grade 3 leukopenia and Grade 2 anaemia on the same day. The patient 
went on to receive a total of 6 cycles of treatment. 
 
One  patient  mistakenly  received  a  higher-than-prescribed  single  dose  of  TAS-102  during  cycle  1; 
although  the  total  dose  administered  during  cycle  1  was  1100  mg  as  prescribed,  this  event  was 
reported as a non-serious AE of accidental overdose (with no severity grade assigned). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse events with an outcome of treatment discontinuation 
A total of 43 patients in the TAS-102 arm (12.8%) and 28 patients in the placebo arm (16.7%) experienced 
1 or more AEs with an outcome of treatment discontinuation. Events with an outcome of discontinuation 
were  most  common  in  the  MedDRA  SOCs  of  gastrointestinal  disorders  (4.5%  [TAS-102  arm]  vs.  6.5% 
[placebo arm]) and general disorders and administration site conditions (2.4% vs. 6.0%). There was no 
particular pattern to these events; no individual preferred term had an outcome of discontinuation for 1% or 
more of patients in the TAS-102 arm with the exception of general physical health deterioration (1.2% in the 
TAS-102 arm vs. 2.4% in the placebo arm). 
This  is  in  line  with  what  was  observed  in  RECOURSE.  Events  with  an  outcome  of  discontinuation  were 
reported in 10.3% in the TAS-102 group and 13.6% in the placebo group. The most frequent AE leading to 
discontinuation  in  the  TAS-102  group  was  general  physical  health  deterioration  (2.3%  vs.  1.9%  in  the 
placebo arm). 
Adverse events with outcome of treatment modification 
Events with an outcome of treatment modification (i.e. treatment interruption, treatment delay, or dose 
reduction)  are  summarised  in  Table  42.  This  table  includes  any  AE  with  an  outcome  of  treatment 
interruption, treatment delay, or dose reduction (whether or not the AE caused the modification). Treatment 
modification due to AEs tended to occur more frequently during TAS-102 treatment (58.2%) compared to 
placebo treatment (22.0%) in the TAGS study. Neutropenia (25.7%) and anaemia (8.8%) were the most 
frequently  reported  AEs  leading  to  treatment  modification.  AEs  leading  to  treatment  modification 
(interruption, delay, or dose reduction) were mostly either myelosuppressive or gastrointestinal in nature, 
or related to underlying disease. 
A total of 36 patients in the TAS-102 arm (10.7%) and 2 patients in the placebo arm (1.2%) experienced AEs 
with an outcome of dose reduction. The two most common events leading to dose reduction in the TAS-102 
arm of TAGS were neutropenia (3.6%; n=12) and anaemia (2.1%; n=7). Events of febrile neutropenia, 
pancytopenia, diarrhoea, and neutrophil count decreased each had an outcome of dose reduction for a total 
of 3 patients (0.9%); no other individual preferred term had an outcome of dose reduction for more than 2 
patients (0.6%).

 Summary  of  events  with  an  outcome  of  treatment  modification,  incidence  ≥1%  in  the 
Occurrence of AEs with an outcome of treatment modification for both treatment groups tended to be higher 
in the TAGS study compared to the RECOURSE study. However, the difference in occurrence of AEs tended 
to be smaller in the TAGS study (36.0%) compared to the RECOURSE study (40.6%). 
Post-marketing experience 
From post-marketing experience, myelosuppressive (anaemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia 
and febrile neutropenia) events, gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea) and infections 
remain  the  primary  safety  concerns  with  Lonsurf  according  to  post-marketing  experience  of  Lonsurf  for 
mCRC.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
As a result of the eligibility criteria for the TAGS study, all patients in the safety population had an ECOG PS 
of  0  or  1,  as  well  as  normal  or  mildly  abnormal  haematological  parameters.  The  to-be-treated  patient 
population in clinical practice is expected to include more frail patients with e.g. ECOG PS of 2 and/or more

impaired renal function.  Currently available  study  data on the  effects of TAS-102 do not allow a proper 
characterisation of the safety profile of TAS-102 in a more frail population with mGC. However, in the TAGS 
study, the overall incidence of TEAEs did not increase with advancing levels of renal or hepatic impairment. 
Moreover, in a Japanese post-marketing surveillance study with respect to TAS-102 treatment for mCRC the 
incidence of any grade and grade ≥3 adverse reactions in patients with a baseline ECOG PS 2 was similar to 
the incidence of respective adverse reactions in patients with an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Aforementioned data 
allow safe use of TAS-102 in more frail patients with mGC in clinical practice. 
Regarding patient exposure, the median duration of therapy was rather short but longer in the TAS-102 
treatment group (median 6.7 weeks) compared to the placebo treatment group (median 5.7 weeks). The 
most  important  reason  for  premature  treatment  discontinuation  was  progression  of  disease  (>70%  of 
patients in both treatment groups). The rather short duration of therapy prevents assessment of long-term 
safety, but this is in accordance with the observed relatively short PFS in this disease setting. The patients 
in  the  TAS-102  arm  in  TAGS  had  a  similar  exposure  to  TAS-102  when  compared  to  the  patients  in  the 
TAS-102 arm in RECOURSE. 
Most patients experienced at least one TEAE of any Grade in the TAGS study, and the majority experienced 
Grade ≥3 events. Severe, life-threatening, disabling or fatal AEs (i.e. Grade ≥3 AEs) and treatment-related 
AEs tended to be reported more frequently in the TAS-102 treatment group than in the placebo treatment 
group. This also applies to the occurrence of treatment-related SAEs. 
The  pattern  of  TEAEs  in  general  and  treatment-related  emergent  (serious)  AEs  in  the  TAGS  study  is 
comparable to that observed in the previous placebo-controlled RECOURSE study on the effects of TAS-102 
in mCRC.  However, incidence  of Grade ≥3  AEs (79.7% vs. 69.4%), SAEs (42.7% vs. 29.6%), AEs with 
outcome dose modification (58.2% vs. 54.2%), and AEs with outcome death (13.4% vs. 3.2%) tended to 
occur more frequently upon TAS-102 treatment in respectively the TAGS study compared to the RECOURSE 
study. Observed differences between TAS-102 and placebo for respective outcomes were not consistently 
larger in the TAGS study than in the RECOURSE study. This finding indicates that the higher incidence of AEs 
in the  TAGS study as compared to the RECOURSE  study is probably due to other factors than TAS-102 
treatment itself. It is agreed with the applicant that the higher incidence of (serious) AEs in the TAGS study 
as compared to the RECOURSE study may be explained by the fact that the mGC patients tend to be frailer, 
sicker and have poorer prognosis than patients with mCRC. 
Among the most frequently reported events (occurrence ≥10%), the largest differences between arms were 
observed for myelosuppressive AEs (specifically: neutropenia / neutrophil count decreased, anaemia, and 
leukopenia).  For  some  gastrointestinal  disorders  including  nausea,  vomiting,  and  diarrhoea,  and  fatigue 
modest  differences  were  observed  between  study  arms  (with  higher  incidence  in  the  TAS-102  arm). 
Aforementioned AEs tended to be reported more frequently in patients treated with TAS-102 in the TAGS 
study compared to the RECOURSE study. 
Treatment-related  AEs  tended  to  be  reported  more  frequently  in  TAS-102  treated  patients  compared to 
placebo-treated  study  patients.  Treatment-related  AEs  tended  to  occur  less  frequently  in  study  patients 
treated with TAS-102 in the TAGS study compared to study patients treated with TAS-102 in the RECOURSE 
study, with the exception of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia.  
Occurrence of death on treatment or within 30 days after the last treatment dose tended to be lower for 
TAS-102 treatment (18.4%) compared to placebo treatment (24.7%). It is difficult to determine the cause 
of death in patients with mGC in a poor condition due to previous treatment for this condition, comorbidities, 
and concomitant medication. Despite these limitations, disease progression appears to be the main cause of 
death  in  both  patient  groups.  According  to  the  investigators,  no  deaths  due  to  AEs  related  to  TAS-102 
treatment were observed in the TAGS study. 
Occurrence of AEs with outcome death was similar in study patients treated with TAS-102 (13.4%) and 
placebo  (11.3%).  This  is  remarkable  considering  the  more  extensive  patient  exposure  for  TAS-102 
compared to placebo treatment. The most common AE with an outcome of death in both treatment groups 
was general physical health deterioration. There were 3 patients experiencing pulmonary embolism with an 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/479870/2019

outcome of death in the TAS-102 arm vs. 0 in the placebo arm, considered not related to study treatment; 
and 3 different patients experienced septic shock with an outcome of death in the TAS-102 arm vs. 0 in the 
placebo arm. Only in 1 case of septic shock, the applicant assessed that a causal role of TAS-102 for the 
event  cannot  be  excluded,  whereas  the  investigator  did  not  consider  the  event  as  related  to  study 
medication. Though deaths due to pulmonary embolism or septic shock were (in most cases) not identified 
as ADRs in the TAGS study, it is noted that both AEs are listed as ADRs in the SmPC of Lonsurf. A contribution 
of TAS-102 to these events cannot be ruled out, but it is difficult to definitively conclude on this with the 
limited data available. In any case, it is indicated for both pulmonary embolism and septic shock in SmPC 
section 4.8 that fatal cases have been reported. 
The occurrence of AEs with outcome death upon TAS-102 treatment tended to be higher in the TAGS study 
(13.4%) compared to the RECOURSE study (3.2%). According to the applicant, the difference in the number 
of  AEs  with  outcome  of  death  between  TAGS  and  RECOURSE  is  probably  due  to  the  different  patient 
populations and the increased morbidity of the patients in TAGS. In support of this, OS of TAS-102 treated 
patients with mGC in the TAGS study tends to be lower compared to TAS-102 treated patients with mCRC in 
the RECOURSE study (mOS 5.7 vs. 7.1 months; Lonsurf mCRC EPAR). 
The incidence  of  SAEs  was similar between the TAS-102  and placebo arms in  the TAGS study (42.7  vs. 
41.7%). However, treatment-related SAEs tended to be reported more often in study patients treated with 
TAS-102 (11.6%) compared to those treated with placebo (3.6%). 
The  most  common  SAE  in  both  arms  was  general  physical  health  deterioration,  generally  secondary  to 
progression of disease. SAEs at an incidence of >1% in the TAS-102 treatment group that were reported 
more than 1% more frequently in the TAS-102 treatment group compared to the placebo treatment group 
in the TAGS study were anaemia, pancytopenia, (febrile) neutropenia, neutropenic sepsis, vomiting, and 
diarrhoea,  i.e.  myelosuppressive  and  gastro-intestinal  AEs.  Similar  trends  for  SAEs  either  or  not 
treatment-related were observed in the RECOURSE study. 
AEs of special interest included myelosuppressive and gastro-intestinal AEs. Overall incidence of AEs in the 
blood and lymphatic SOC tended to be higher in the TAS-102 arm (63.6%) than in the placebo arm (25%) 
in  the  TAGS  study.  Haematologic  AEs  /  laboratory  abnormalities  were  generally  manageable  when  they 
occurred.  
In the SOC infections and infestations the absolute incidence of events of this type included related events 
was higher in the TAS-102 arm than in the placebo arm. However, occurrence of serious and severe (Grade 
≥3) AEs, and AEs with an outcome of treatment discontinuation in this SOC were comparable. The overall 
incidence of events with an outcome of death was low in both arms, and the difference between arms was 
<1%.  Reported  AE  rates  with  respect  to  myelosuppressive  AEs  tended  to  be  lower  in  the  TAGS  study 
compared to the RECOURSE study. Hence, no new safety concerns with respect to infections and infestations 
emerged from the TAGS study. 
The overall incidence of events in the SOC of gastrointestinal disorders tended to be slightly higher in the 
TAS-102 group than in the  placebo arm of  TAGS  (72.8%  vs. 67.3%). Occurrence  of serious and severe 
(Grade ≥3) events was not higher in the TAS-102 arm compared to the placebo arm.  
A total of 54.9% of patients in the TAS-102 arm and 45.8% of patients in the control arm reported nausea, 
diarrhoea, and/or vomiting. Occurrence  of Grade ≥3 AEs was similar.  Incidence  of nausea, vomiting, or 
diarrhoea with an outcome of treatment discontinuation was similar between arms. Overall, increases in the 
occurrence of diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting in the TAS-102 arm in comparison to placebo arm is less 
pronounced compared to what was observed in previous RECOURSE study. Hence, no new safety concerns 
with respect to gastrointestinal disorders emerged from the TAGS study. 
AEs related to liver impairment were reported at similar rates upon TAS-102 and placebo treatment in the 
TAGS study.  
Occurrence of AEs in both treatment groups varied among different levels of renal impairment. Consistent 
trends in the occurrence of AEs in patients with normal renal function, mild renal impairment and moderate 
renal impairment were however not observed for TAS-102 and placebo treatment in the TAGS study in mGC.

In pooled safety data of the TAGS and RECOURSE study overall incidence of AEs upon TAS-102 treatment 
was  similar  for  patients  with  normal  renal  function,  mild  and  moderate  renal  impairment.  However,  the 
incidence of serious, severe treatment-emergent AEs and AEs leading to dose modification upon TAS-102 
treatment tended to be higher in patients with moderate renal impairment compared to those without or 
mild renal impairment (defined as a difference of at least 5%). This information is reflected in section 4.4 of 
the SmPC. 
Reported haematologic laboratory abnormalities were neutropenia, anaemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, and 
thrombocytopenia. Overall, severe (4.3 - 26.8% vs. 7.4 – 8%) and potentially life-threatening (0 – 11.3% 
vs. 0%) haematologic laboratory abnormalities tended to occur more frequently during TAS-102 treatment 
compared to placebo treatment. Differences in occurrence were largest for neutropenia, leukopenia, and 
anaemia. 
With respect to chemistry laboratory abnormalities, there were no notable differences between TAS-102 and 
placebo arms for most parameters. However, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 hypokalaemia that worsened 
from baseline was higher in the TAS-102 arm (2.4%) than in the placebo arm (0.6%). This observation may 
be due to the higher incidence of gastrointestinal effects (e.g. diarrhoea, vomiting) observed with TAS-102 
treatment  compared  to  placebo  treatment.  For  example,  Grade  ≥3  diarrhoea  and  vomiting  were  more 
frequently observed in the TAS-102 arm (2.7% and 3.6%, respectively) than the placebo arm (1.8% and 
1.8%, respectively). The SmPC already includes a warning for clinical monitoring of gastrointestinal events 
and management as clinically indicated. 
In addition, hepatobiliary abnormalities were commonly reported and were more frequently observed in the 
TAS-102  arm  vs.  the  placebo  arm,  in  particular  elevations  of  bilirubin  and  alkaline  phosphatase.  In  the 
TAS-102 arm 2 patients met the laboratory criteria for Hy’s Law. The applicant acknowledged the absolute 
high incidence of hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities reported in Lonsurf arm, in particular bilirubin and 
alkaline  phosphatase,  but  pointed  out  that  when  comparing  these  incidences  to  the  placebo  arm,  the 
difference  is  <5%.  It  is  agreed  with  the  applicant  that  there  is  no  need  for  additional  precautionary 
statements with recommendations for monitoring of these events during treatment in the SmPC. 
No clinically relevant mean or median changes in body weight or vital signs were observed in either study 
treatment  group.  Median  changes  from  baseline  at  the  end  of  each  cycle  were  relatively  stable  in  both 
treatment groups over the first several treatment cycles.  
Though occurrence of AEs was higher among study patients treated with TAS-102 compared to those treated 
with placebo in the TAGS study, occurrence of AEs during TAS-102 treatment was overall comparable for 
patients of different age and race. 
Patients with an ECOG PS of 0 at baseline generally had lower rates of adverse events than patients with a 
score of 1, with the exception of AEs of special interest in the TAS-102 group (ECOG 0: 76.4%; ECOG 1: 
68.4%). The applicant additionally presented a comparative analysis (ECOG PS 1 vs. ECOG PS 0, and vs. 
placebo) of the frequency of overall AEs, treatment related AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation and 
leading to death. This analysis did show that the absolute values of serious, severe AEs and AEs leading to 
death  in  the  ECOG  1  subgroup  were  higher  than  in  the  ECOG  0  subgroup  in  the  TAS-102  arm.  When 
comparing the relative values vs. placebo of these events however, the differences appear similar or even 
lower in the ECOG 1 subgroup as compared to the ECOG 0 subgroup. 
Occurrence of AEs during TAS-102 treatment was overall comparable for patients of different race. Also, 
occurrence of TEAEs in Asian patients and patients from Japan in the TAGS and RECOURSE study was similar 
with respect to TAS-102 treatment (Asian patients: 100% vs. 99.5%; Japanese patients: 100% vs. 99.4%) 
but tended to be lower during placebo treatment in the TAGS study compared to the RECOURSE study (Asian 
patients: 82.8 vs. 92.6%; Japanese patients: 81.5 vs. 92.0%).  
Two patients (0.6%) mistakenly received a single overdose of TAS-102 in the TAGS study. No fatal AEs 
occurred upon respective accidental overdoses. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/479870/2019 
Page 77/88 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
AEs with an outcome of treatment discontinuation tended to be observed less frequently in the TAS-102 arm 
(12.8%)  compared  to  the  placebo  arm  (16.7%).  Events  with  an  outcome  of  discontinuation  were  most 
common in the SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders and general disorders and administration site conditions. 
Treatment modification tended to occur more frequently during TAS-102 treatment (58.2%) compared to 
placebo treatment (22.0%) in the TAGS study. AEs leading to treatment modification (interruption, delay, or 
dose reduction) were mostly either myelosuppressive or gastrointestinal in nature, or related to underlying 
disease and were generally comparable with observations from RECOURSE, i.e. the established safety profile 
of TAS-102. 
Observed post-marketing safety data are consistent with the current SmPC. At this time, there are no 
additional safety signals. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of TAS-102 in the TAGS study in mGC is overall similar to that of TAS-102 in previous 
RECOURSE study in mCRC. No new safety signals emerged. TAS-102 was generally well tolerated and the 
identified risks are considered manageable in clinical practice. Most frequently reported TEAEs were 
myelosuppressive (e.g. neutropenia, anaemia, leukopenia) or gastrointestinal (e.g. nausea, decreased 
appetite, diarrhoea) by nature, for which close monitoring is already recommended in the SmPC.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a (full) user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable as the proposed changes introduced in the 
Package Leaflet (PL) as part of this variation application, are limited to: 
- 
the  addition  of  the  new  indication  for  mGC  (including  adenocarcinoma  of  the  gastroesophageal 
junction) in section 1. Patient friendly terms used to describe the new indication are already present 
in the PL of another approved product in the same indication  and; 
- 
the deletion or moving of some terms in the section 4.  
It is agreed that the changes introduced by this variation do not substantially impact the readability of the 
package leaflet. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The agreed indication for Lonsurf in this procedure is: “Lonsurf is indicated as monotherapy for the 
treatment of adult patients with metastatic gastric cancer including adenocarcinoma of the 
gastroesophageal junction, who have been previously treated with at least two prior systemic treatment 
regimens for advanced disease”.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
For  advanced/metastatic  GC  in  third-  or  later-line  treatment,  there  are  neither  approved  nor  standard 
therapies. Nevertheless, selected patients could be offered chemotherapy without proof of OS benefit. Then 
again, the ESMO guidelines note on this matter that second-line treatment options may be used sequentially 
in  second  and  third  line,  but  indicates  caution  that  “there  is  no  clear  evidence  for  a  benefit  beyond 
second-line treatment” (Smyth, 2016).

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The single pivotal study in this procedure is TAGS, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 
study evaluating the efficacy and safety of TAS-102 plus BSC vs. placebo plus BSC in patients with mGC 
refractory to standard treatments, i.e. patients who had received ≥2 prior regimens for advanced disease 
and were refractory to or unable to tolerate their last prior therapy. Importantly, these prior regimens were 
required to have included a fluoropyrimidine-, platinum-, and either a taxane- and/or irinotecan-containing 
regimen (plus patients with HER2+ tumours were required to have received prior anti-HER2 therapy). OS 
was the primary endpoint of this study, PFS was the key secondary efficacy endpoint, and ORR and DCR 
were among the other secondary endpoints. In total, 507 patients were randomized 2:1 to either TAS-102 
(N=337) or placebo (N=170). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
On  OS,  the  effect  of  TAS-102  relative  to  placebo  resulted  in  a  HR  of  0.69  (95%  CI:  0.560,  0.855,; 
p=0.0003), with mOS of 5.7 months for TAS-102 versus 3.6 months for placebo, reflecting an increase in 
mOS of 2.1 months. The results of all sensitivity analyses were consistent with this primary analysis of OS. 
In the subgroup analyses the OS HRs in general favoured the TAS-102 group. 
The results for all secondary (efficacy) endpoints are in line with the OS data. 
For  the  key  secondary  endpoint  PFS,  a  statistically  significant  benefit  was  also  shown.  Treatment  with 
TAS-102 when compared to placebo resulted in a HR of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.467, 0.701; p<0.0001), with mPFS 
of 2.0 months for TAS-102 versus 1.8 months for placebo, reflecting an increase in mPFS of 0.2 months. The 
results of all relevant sensitivity analyses were consistent with this primary analysis of PFS. The PFS HRs 
favoured the TAS-102 group across all subgroups examined. 
The ORR was numerically higher for the TAS-102 arm when compared to the placebo arm (4.5% vs. 2.1%, 
respectively; ∆ +2.4% [95% CI: -0.9, 5.7]; p=0.2833). 
A statistically significant improvement was observed in the DCR for the TAS-102 arm when compared to the 
placebo arm (44.1% vs. 14.5%, respectively; ∆ +29.7% [95% CI: 21.6, 37.7], p<0.0001). 
Treatment with TAS-102 resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the rate of deterioration to ECOG 
PS ≥2 compared to placebo. The median time to ECOG PS ≥2 was 4.3 months (95% CI: 3.7, 4.7) in the 
TAS-102 arm vs. 2.3 months (95% CI: 2.0, 2.8) in the placebo arm (HR=0.69; 95% CI: 0.562, 0.854; 
p=0.0005). 
QoL as assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22, was balanced between both treatments arms 
at baseline, and there were no (mean/median) changes ≥10 points in overall QoL from baseline up to cycle 
3  in  either  treatment  group.  Treatment  with  TAS-102  resulted  in  a  numerically  longer  median  time  to 
deterioration by ≥5 points in global health status using the above-mentioned QoL questionnaires compared 
to placebo. The median time to deterioration was 2.6 months (95% CI: 2.3, 3.3) in the TAS-102 arm vs. 2.3 
months (95% CI: 1.4, NA) in the placebo arm (HR=1.27; 95% CI: 0.854, 1.875; p=0.2350). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The efficacy of TAS-102 in mGC patients with an ECOG PS score >1 is not known, as these patients were 
excluded from TAGS (which is adequately reflected in section 5.1 of the proposed amended SmPC). 
The  clinical  relevance  of  the  observed  0.2-month  improvement  in  mPFS  (i.e.  approximately  6  days)  is 
uncertain. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/479870/2019 
Page 83/88 
 
  
  
The MAH was not able to confirm that the QoL questionnaires were completed at the beginning of each visit, 
prior to any clinical activities (i.e. before any extensive contact and consultation with study site personnel). 
As a result, the patient responses may have been biased, as e.g. medical information could bias 
retrospective evaluation. Also, there were a lot of missing data at later time-points. Therefore, no 
conclusions can be drawn on the basis of the QoL data submitted and these data have not been included in 
the SmPC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The incidence of AEs in the different AE categories for TAS-102 vs. placebo were any AE: 97.3% vs. 93.5%; 
any treatment-related AE: 80.9% vs. 56.6%; Grade ≥3 AEs: 79.7% vs. 57.7%; SAEs: 42.7% vs. 41.7%; 
treatment-related SAEs: 11.6% vs. 3.6%; discontinuation due to an AE: 12.8% vs. 16.7%; dose 
modification due to an AE: 58.2% vs. 22.0%; death due to an AE: 13.4% vs. 11.3%. 
104 Study patients died while on study treatment or within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. 
Most patients died due to disease progression (TAS-102 13.9% vs. placebo 23.5%). The proportion of 
patients who died due to an AE tended to be higher for TAS-102 (4.2%) than for placebo treatment (1.2%). 
However, according to the investigators none of the TAS-102-treated study patients died due to a 
treatment-related AE.  
Occurrence of liver impairment-related AEs was similar for TAS-102 (7.5%) and placebo treatment (6.0%). 
The same applies to the occurrence of renal impairment-related AEs in these treatment groups (TAS-102: 
5.4%, placebo: 6.0%). 
In general, serum chemistry abnormalities occurred at similar frequencies during TAS-102 and placebo 
treatment. However, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 hypokalaemia that worsened from baseline was higher in 
the TAS-102 arm (2.4%) than in the placebo arm (0.6%). Also, hepatobiliary abnormalities were more 
frequent in the TAS-102 arm, in particular bilirubin elevations of 1.5 x ULN were reported for 14.9% vs. 
11.9% in the control arm, and elevations of 2 x ULN reported for 11.6% vs. 7.1% for the control arm; 
elevation of alkaline phosphatase of 1.5 x ULN was reported for 45.1% of the TAS-102 arm and 41.7% of the 
control arm. In the TAS-102 arm, 2 patients met the laboratory criteria for Hy’s Law. 
A total of 43 patients in the TAS-102 arm (12.8%) and 28 patients in the placebo arm (16.7%) experienced 
1 or more AEs with an outcome of treatment discontinuation. Events with an outcome of discontinuation 
were most common in the SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders (4.5% [TAS-102 arm] vs. 6.5% [placebo arm]) 
and general disorders and administration site conditions (2.4% vs. 6.0%). 
Treatment modification due to AEs tended to occur  more frequently during TAS-102 treatment  (58.2%) 
compared  to  placebo  treatment  (22.0%)  in  the  TAGS  study.  AEs  leading  to  treatment  modification 
(interruption, delay, or dose reduction) were mostly either myelosuppressive or gastrointestinal in nature, 
or related to underlying disease. 
In conclusion, the safety profile of TAS-102 in the TAGS study in mGC is overall similar to that of TAS-102 
in previous RECOURSE study in mCRC. No new safety signals emerged. TAS-102 was generally well 
tolerated and the identified risks (see RMP) are considered manageable in clinical practice. Most frequently 
reported TEAEs were myelosuppressive (e.g. neutropenia, anaemia, leukopenia) or gastrointestinal (e.g. 
nausea, decreased appetite, diarrhoea) by nature, for which close monitoring is already recommended in the 
SmPC. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
As a result of the eligibility criteria for the TAGS study, all patients in the safety population had an ECOG PS 
of 0 or 1, as well as normal or mildly abnormal haematological parameters and liver function tests. The 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/479870/2019 
Page 84/88 
 
  
  
to-be-treated patient population in clinical practice is expected to include more frail patients with e.g. ECOG 
PS of 2 and/or more impaired renal function. Currently available study data on the effects of TAS-102 
therefore do not allow a proper characterization of the safety profile of TAS-102 in more frail subpopulations 
with mGC. However, limitations with respect to particular subpopulations are appropriately reflected in the 
SmPC.  
Occurrence of TEAEs in Asian patients and patients from Japan in the TAGS and RECOURSE study was similar 
with respect to TAS-102 treatment (Asian patients: 100% vs. 99.5%; Japanese patients: 100% vs. 99.4%) 
but tended to be lower during placebo treatment in the TAGS study compared to the RECOURSE study (Asian 
patients: 82.8 vs. 92.6%; Japanese patients: 81.5 vs. 92.0%). Since differences in occurrence of AEs in the 
TAGS and RECOURSE study were only observed for placebo treatment but not for active TAS-102 treatment, 
this issue is not further pursued.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The prognosis of patients with mGC overall is poor, but even more so in the third- and later-line treatment 
setting, as shown by the ≤6-month mOS observed in several recent studies. In this disease setting, there 
are neither approved nor standard therapies and thus new treatment options are necessary. 
The  OS  benefit  observed  for  TAS-102  of  2.1  months  in  TAGS  was  statistically  significant  and  clinically 
relevant. Moreover, the OS result was robust and supported by the key secondary efficacy endpoint PFS and 
most other secondary efficacy endpoints (e.g. DCR). Therefore, in spite of this being an application based on 
a single pivotal study, the efficacy results are considered quite convincing. 
There were no unexpected findings in the assessment of TEAEs in the safety population, with the known 
myelosuppressive  AEs 
(e.g.  neutropenia, 
leukopenia,  anaemia,  and 
thrombocytopenia)  and 
gastro-intestinal AEs (e.g. diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting), and fatigue. TAS-102 was generally well tolerated 
and the identified risks (see RMP) are considered manageable in clinical practice. When compared with the 
known safety profile of TAS-102 for the mCRC patient population, no new safety signals were identified. 
Only study patients with a relatively good ECOG PS and normal or only mildly abnormal haematological and 
chemistry parameters were included in the TAGS study. Currently available study data on the effects of 
TAS-102 therefore do not allow a proper characterisation of the safety profile of TAS-102 in more frail 
subpopulations with mGC. However, limitations with respect to particular subpopulations are adequately 
reflected in the SmPC. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Treatment with TAS-102 resulted in a clear OS benefit in a disease setting with a very poor prognosis, and 
wherein there are neither approved nor standard therapies. 
The  overall  safety  profile  of  TAS-102  in  patients  with  mGC  appears  to  be  similar  to  that  observed  for 
TAS-102 in patients with mCRC, and is considered acceptable in this disease setting. 
The benefit-risk balance is therefore considered positive in the target population as represented by the 
above mentioned indication. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The final proposed indication is: 
Lonsurf is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic gastric cancer 
including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who have been previously treated with at least 
two prior systemic treatment regimens for advanced disease (see section 5.1)or are not 
considered candidates for, available therapies including fluoropyrimidine-, platinum-, and either a taxane- 
or irinotecan-based chemotherapy. 
For brevity reasons the previous regimen followed by patients have been reflected in a more general way 
making then clear specification on them in section 5.1   
3.8.  Conclusions 
The B/R of Lonsurf (trifluridine/tipiracil) is positive.

Extension of Indication to include the treatment, as monotherapy, of adult patients with metastatic gastric 
cancer including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who have been previously treated with 
at least two systemic treatment regimens for advanced disease for Lonsurf; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 
4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. The RMP 
version 7.0 has also been submitted and updated in accordance with Template Rev 2. For clarification, the 
term monotherapy has also been added to the existing indication in metastatic colorectal cancer. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
5.   EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 8 
"steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

Reminders to the MAH 
1. 
In accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the Agency makes available a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product assessed by the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial marketing 
authorisation (MA) and is continuously updated during the lifecycle of the medicinal product. In 
particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the assessment report of 
the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to the authorisation, after 
deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. 
Should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains commercially confidential information, 
please provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of commercially 
confidential information (CCI) in “track changes” and with detailed justification within 15 days of 
receipt of the opinion documents. The principles to be applied for the deletion of CCI are published on 
the EMA website at 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/regulatory-procedural-guideline/principles-be-applied-deleti
on-commercially-confidential-information-disclosure-emea-documents_en.pdf. 
2. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
3. 
If the approved RMP is using Rev. 2 of the ‘Guidance on the format of the RMP in the EU’ and the RMP 
‘Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan’ has been updated in the procedure, the MAH is 
reminded to provide to the EMA Procedure Assistant by Eudralink a PDF version of the ‘Part VI: 
Summary of the risk management plan’ as a standalone document, within 14 calendar days of the 
receipt of the CHMP Opinion. The PDF should contain only text and tables and be free of metadata, 
headers and footers. 
4. 
The MAH is reminded to submit an eCTD closing sequence with the final documents provided by 
Eudralink during the procedure (including final PI translations, if applicable) within 15 days after the 
Commission Decision, or prior to the next regulatory activity, whichever is first.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Tasigna is indicated for the treatment of: 
- 
adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic 
myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in the chronic phase, 
adult patients with chronic phase and accelerated phase Philadelphia chromosome positive CML 
with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib. Efficacy data in patients with 
CML in blast crisis are not available, 
paediatric patients with chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome positive CML with resistance 
or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib. 
- 
- 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and the treatment of patients 
with CML. 
Posology 
Treatment should be continued as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity 
occurs. 
If a dose is missed the patient should not take an additional dose, but take the usual prescribed next 
dose. 
Posology for Philadelphia chromosome positive CML adult patients 
The recommended dose is: 
- 
- 
300 mg twice daily in newly diagnosed patients with CML in the chronic phase, 
400 mg twice daily in patients with chronic or accelerated phase CML with resistance or 
intolerance to prior therapy. 
Posology for Philadelphia chromosome positive CML paediatric patients 
Dosing in paediatric patients is individualised and is based on body surface area (mg/m2). The 
recommended dose of nilotinib is 230 mg/m2 twice daily, rounded to the nearest 50 mg dose (to a 
maximum single dose of 400 mg) (see Table 1). Different strengths of Tasigna hard capsules can be 
combined to attain the desired dose. 
There is no experience with treatment of paediatric patients below 2 years of age. There are no data in 
newly diagnosed paediatric patients below 10 years of age and limited data in imatinib-resistant or 
intolerant paediatric patients below 6 years of age.

Adult Philadelphia chromosome positive CML patients in chronic phase who have been treated with 
nilotinib as first-line therapy and who achieved a sustained deep molecular response (MR4.5) 
Discontinuation of treatment may be considered in eligible adult Philadelphia chromosome positive 
(Ph+) CML patients in chronic phase who have been treated with nilotinib at 300 mg twice daily for a 
minimum of 3 years if a deep molecular response is sustained for a minimum of one year immediately 
prior to discontinuation of therapy. Discontinuation of nilotinib therapy should be initiated by a 
physician experienced in the treatment of patients with CML (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Eligible patients who discontinue nilotinib therapy must have their BCR-ABL transcript levels and 
complete blood count with differential monitored monthly for one year, then every 6 weeks for the 
second year, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Monitoring of BCR-ABL transcript levels must be 
performed with a quantitative diagnostic test validated to measure molecular response levels on the 
International Scale (IS) with a sensitivity of at least MR4.5 (BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.0032% IS). 
For patients who lose MR4 (MR4=BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.01%IS) but not MMR 
(MMR=BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.1%IS) during the treatment-free phase, BCR-ABL transcript levels should 
be monitored every 2 weeks until BCR-ABL levels return to a range between MR4 and MR4.5. 
Patients who maintain BCR-ABL levels between MMR and MR4 for a minimum of 4 consecutive 
measurements can return to the original monitoring schedule. 
Patients who lose MMR must re-initiate treatment within 4 weeks of when loss of remission is known 
to have occurred. Nilotinib therapy should be re-initiated at 300 mg twice daily or at a reduced dose 
level of 400 mg once daily if the patient had a dose reduction prior to discontinuation of therapy. 
Patients who re-initiate nilotinib therapy should have their BCR-ABL transcript levels monitored 
monthly until MMR is re-established and every 12 weeks thereafter (see section 4.4). 
Adult Philadelphia chromosome positive CML patients in chronic phase who have achieved a 
sustained deep molecular response (MR 4.5) on nilotinib following prior imatinib therapy 
Discontinuation of treatment may be considered in eligible adult Philadelphia chromosome positive 
(Ph+) CML patients in chronic phase who have been treated with nilotinib for a minimum of 3 years if 
a deep molecular response is sustained for a minimum of one year immediately prior to 
discontinuation of therapy. Discontinuation of nilotinib therapy should be initiated by a physician 
experienced in the treatment of patients with CML (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Eligible patients who discontinue nilotinib therapy must have their BCR-ABL transcript levels and 
complete blood count with differential monitored monthly for one year, then every 6 weeks for the 
second year, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Monitoring of BCR-ABL transcript levels must be 
performed with a quantitative diagnostic test validated to measure molecular response levels on the 
International Scale (IS) with a sensitivity of at least MR4.5 (BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.0032% IS). 
Patients with confirmed loss of MR4 (MR4= BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.01%IS) during the treatment-free 
phase (two consecutive measures separated by at least 4 weeks showing loss of MR4) or loss of major 
molecular response (MMR=BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.1%IS) must re-initiate treatment within 4 weeks of 
when loss of remission is known to have occurred. Nilotinib therapy should be re-initiated at either 
300 mg or 400 mg twice daily. Patients who re-initiate nilotinib therapy should have their BCR-ABL 
transcript levels monitored monthly until previous major molecular response or MR4 level is 
re-established and every 12 weeks thereafter (see section 4.4). 
Dose adjustments or modifications 
Tasigna may need to be temporarily withheld and/or dose reduced for haematological toxicities 
(neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) that are not related to the underlying leukaemia (see Table 2).

*ANC = absolute neutrophil count 
If clinically significant moderate or severe non-haematological toxicity develops, dosing should be 
interrupted, and patients should be monitored and treated accordingly. If the prior dose was 300 mg 
twice daily in adult newly diagnosed patients with CML in the chronic phase, or 400 mg twice daily in 
adult patients with imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML in chronic or accelerated phase, or 230 mg/m2 
twice daily in paediatric patients, dosing may be resumed at 400 mg once daily in adult patients and at 
230 mg/m2 once daily in paediatric patients once the toxicity has resolved. If the prior dose was 
400 mg once daily in adult patients or 230 mg/m2 once daily in paediatric patients, treatment should be 
discontinued. If clinically appropriate, re-escalation of the dose to the starting dose of 300 mg twice 
daily in adult newly diagnosed patients with CML in the chronic phase or to 400 mg twice daily in 
adult patients with imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML in chronic or accelerated phase or to 
230 mg/m2 twice daily in paediatric patients should be considered. 
Elevated serum lipase: For Grade 3-4 serum lipase elevations, doses in adult patients should be 
reduced to 400 mg once daily or interrupted. In paediatric patients, treatment must be interrupted until 
the event returns to Grade 1. Thereafter, if the prior dose was 230 mg/m2 twice daily, treatment can 
be resumed at 230 mg/m2 once daily. If the prior dose was 230 mg/m2 once daily, treatment should be 
discontinued. Serum lipase levels should be tested monthly or as clinically indicated (see section 4.4). 
Elevated bilirubin and hepatic transaminases: For Grade 3-4 bilirubin and hepatic transaminase 
elevations in adult patients, doses should be reduced to 400 mg once daily or interrupted. For 
Grade 2 bilirubin elevations or Grade 3 hepatic transaminase elevations in paediatric patients, 
treatment must be interrupted until the levels return to Grade 1. Thereafter, if the prior dose was 
230 mg/m2 twice daily, treatment can be resumed at 230 mg/m2 once daily. If the prior dose was 
230 mg/m2 once daily, and recovery to Grade 1 takes longer than 28 days, treatment should be 
discontinued. Bilirubin and hepatic transaminases levels should be tested monthly or as clinically 
indicated.

Special populations 
Elderly 
Approximately 12% of subjects in the Phase III study in patients with newly diagnosed CML in 
chronic phase and approximately 30% of subjects in the Phase II study in patients with 
imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML in chronic phase and accelerated phase were 65 years of age or 
over. No major differences were observed for safety and efficacy in patients ≥65 years of age as 
compared to adults aged 18 to 65 years. 
Renal impairment 
Clinical studies have not been performed in patients with impaired renal function. 
Since nilotinib and its metabolites are not renally excreted, a decrease in total body clearance is not 
anticipated in patients with renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Hepatic impairment has a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of nilotinib. Dose adjustment is not 
considered necessary in patients with hepatic impairment. However, patients with hepatic impairment 
should be treated with caution (see section 4.4). 
Cardiac disorders 
In clinical studies, patients with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease (e.g., recent myocardial 
infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina or clinically significant bradycardia) were 
excluded. Caution should be exercised in patients with relevant cardiac disorders (see section 4.4). 
Increases in total serum cholesterol levels have been reported with nilotinib therapy (see section 4.4). 
Lipid profiles should be determined prior to initiating nilotinib therapy, assessed at month 3 and 6 
after initiating therapy and at least yearly during chronic therapy. 
Increases in blood glucose levels have been reported with nilotinib therapy (see section 4.4). Blood 
glucose levels should be assessed prior to initiating nilotinib therapy and monitored during treatment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Tasigna in paediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive CML 
in chronic phase from 2 to less than 18 years of age have been established (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 
5.2). There is no experience in paediatric patients below 2 years of age or in paediatric patients with 
Philadelphia chromosome positive CML in accelerated phase or blast crisis. There are no data in 
newly diagnosed paediatric patients below 10 years of age and limited data in imatinib-resistant or 
intolerant paediatric patients below 6 years of age. 
Method of administration 
Tasigna should be taken twice daily approximately 12 hours apart and must not be taken with food. 
The hard capsules should be swallowed whole with water. No food should be consumed for 2 hours 
before the dose is taken and no food should be consumed for at least one hour after the dose is taken. 
For patients who are unable to swallow hard capsules, the content of each hard capsule may be 
dispersed in one teaspoon of apple sauce (puréed apple) and should be taken immediately. Not more 
than one teaspoon of apple sauce and no food other than apple sauce must be used (see sections 4.4 
and 5.2). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Myelosuppression 
Treatment with nilotinib is associated with (National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria 
grade 3 and 4) thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anaemia. Occurrence is more frequent in patients 
with imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML, in particular in patients with accelerated-phase CML. 
Complete blood counts should be performed every two weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly 
thereafter, or as clinically indicated. Myelosuppression was generally reversible and usually managed 
by withholding Tasigna temporarily or dose reduction (see section 4.2). 
QT prolongation 
Nilotinib has been shown to prolong cardiac ventricular repolarisation as measured by the QT interval 
on the surface ECG in a concentration-dependent manner in adult and paediatric patients. 
In the Phase III study in patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase receiving 300 mg 
nilotinib twice daily, the change from baseline in mean time-averaged QTcF interval at steady state 
was 6 msec. No patient had a QTcF >480 msec. No episodes of torsade de pointes were observed. 
In the Phase II study in imatinib-resistant and intolerant CML patients in chronic and accelerated 
phase receiving 400 mg nilotinib twice daily, the change from baseline in mean time-averaged QTcF 
interval at steady state was 5 and 8 msec, respectively. QTcF of >500 msec was observed in <1% of 
these patients. No episodes of torsade de pointes were observed in clinical studies. 
In a healthy volunteer study with exposures that were comparable to the exposures observed in 
patients, the time-averaged mean placebo-subtracted QTcF change from baseline was 7 msec 
(CI ± 4 msec). No subject had a QTcF >450 msec. Additionally, no clinically relevant arrhythmias 
were observed during the conduct of the trial. In particular, no episodes of torsade de pointes (transient 
or sustained) were observed. 
Significant prolongation of the QT interval may occur when nilotinib is inappropriately taken with 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or medicinal products with a known potential to prolong the QT 
interval, and/or food (see section 4.5). The presence of hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia may 
further enhance this effect. Prolongation of the QT interval may expose patients to the risk of fatal 
outcome. 
Tasigna should be used with caution in patients who have or who are at significant risk of developing 
prolongation of QTc, such as those: 
- 
- 
with congenital long QT prolongation 
with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease including recent myocardial infarction, 
congestive heart failure, unstable angina or clinically significant bradycardia. 
taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products or other substances that lead to QT prolongation. 
- 
Close monitoring for an effect on the QTc interval is advisable and a baseline ECG is recommended 
prior to initiating nilotinib therapy and as clinically indicated. Hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia 
must be corrected prior to Tasigna administration and should be monitored periodically during 
therapy. 
Sudden death 
Uncommon cases (0.1 to 1%) of sudden deaths have been reported in patients with imatinib-resistant 
or intolerant CML in chronic phase or accelerated phase with a past medical history of cardiac disease 
or significant cardiac risk factors. Co-morbidities in addition to the underlying malignancy were also 
frequently present as were concomitant medicinal products. Ventricular repolarisation abnormalities 
may have been contributory factors. No cases of sudden death were reported in the Phase III study in 
newly diagnosed patients with CML in chronic phase.

Fluid retention and oedema 
Severe forms of drug-related fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pulmonary oedema, and 
pericardial effusion were uncommonly (0.1 to 1%) observed in a Phase III study of newly diagnosed 
CML patients. Similar events were observed in post-marketing reports. Unexpected, rapid weight gain 
should be carefully investigated. If signs of severe fluid retention appear during treatment with 
nilotinib, the aetiology should be evaluated and patients treated accordingly (see section 4.2 for 
instructions on managing non-haematological toxicities). 
Cardiovascular events 
Cardiovascular events were reported in a randomised Phase III study in newly diagnosed CML 
patients and observed in post-marketing reports. In this clinical study with a median on-therapy time 
of 60.5 months, Grade 3-4 cardiovascular events included peripheral arterial occlusive disease (1.4% 
and 1.1% at 300 mg and 400 mg nilotinib twice daily, respectively), ischaemic heart disease (2.2% and 
6.1% at 300 mg and 400 mg nilotinib twice daily, respectively) and ischaemic cerebrovascular events 
(1.1% and 2.2% at 300 mg and 400 mg nilotinib twice daily, respectively). Patients should be advised 
to seek immediate medical attention if they experience acute signs or symptoms of cardiovascular 
events. The cardiovascular status of patients should be evaluated and cardiovascular risk factors 
monitored and actively managed during nilotinib therapy according to standard guidelines. 
Appropriate therapy should be prescribed to manage cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.2 for 
instructions on managing non-haematological toxicities). 
Hepatitis B reactivation 
Reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus has occurred after these 
patients received BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Some cases resulted in acute hepatic failure or 
fulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome. 
Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with nilotinib. Experts in liver 
disease and in the treatment of hepatitis B should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients 
with positive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease) and for patients who test 
positive for HBV infection during treatment. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with nilotinib 
should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and 
for several months following termination of therapy (see section 4.8). 
Special monitoring of adult Ph+ CML patients in chronic phase who have achieved a sustained deep 
molecular response 
Eligibility for discontinuation of treatment 
Eligible patients who are confirmed to express the typical BCR-ABL transcripts, e13a2/b2a2 or 
e14a2/b3a2, can be considered for treatment discontinuation. Patients must have typical BCR-ABL 
transcripts to allow quantitation of BCR-ABL, evaluation of the depth of molecular response, and 
determination of a possible loss of molecular remission after discontinuation of treatment with 
nilotinib. 
Monitoring of patients who have discontinued therapy 
Frequent monitoring of BCR-ABL transcript levels in patients eligible for treatment discontinuation 
must be performed with a quantitative diagnostic test validated to measure molecular response levels 
with a sensitivity of at least MR4.5 (BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.0032% IS). BCR-ABL transcript levels must 
be assessed prior to and during treatment discontinuation (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Loss of major molecular response (MMR=BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.1%IS) in CML patients who received 
nilotinib as first- or second-line therapy, or confirmed loss of MR4 (two consecutive measures 
separated by at least 4 weeks showing loss of MR4 (MR4=BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.01%IS)) in CML 
patients who received nilotinib as second-line therapy will trigger treatment re-initiation within 
4 weeks of when loss of remission is known to have occurred. Molecular relapse can occur during the 
treatment-free phase, and long-term outcome data are not yet available. It is therefore crucial to 
perform frequent monitoring of BCR-ABL transcript levels and complete blood count with differential 
in order to detect possible loss of remission (see section 4.2). For patients who fail to achieve MMR 
after three months of treatment re-initiation, BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation testing should be 
performed. 
Laboratory tests and monitoring 
Blood lipids 
In a Phase III study in newly diagnosed CML patients, 1.1% of the patients treated with 400 mg 
nilotinib twice daily showed a Grade 3-4 elevation in total cholesterol; no Grade 3-4 elevations were 
however observed in the 300 mg twice daily dose group (see section 4.8). It is recommended that the 
lipid profiles be determined before initiating treatment with nilotinib, assessed at month 3 and 6 after 
initiating therapy and at least yearly during chronic therapy (see section 4.2). If a HMG-CoA reductase 
inhibitor (a lipid-lowering agent) is required, please refer to section 4.5 before initiating treatment 
since certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are also metabolised by the CYP3A4 pathway. 
Blood glucose 
In a Phase III study in newly diagnosed CML patients, 6.9% and 7.2% of the patients treated with 
400 mg nilotinib and 300 mg nilotinib twice daily, respectively, showed a Grade 3-4 elevation in 
blood glucose. It is recommended that the glucose levels be assessed before initiating treatment with 
Tasigna and monitored during treatment, as clinically indicated (see section 4.2). If test results warrant 
therapy, physicians should follow their local standards of practice and treatment guidelines. 
Interactions with other medicinal products 
The administration of Tasigna with agents that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (including, but not 
limited to, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir) should 
be avoided. Should treatment with any of these agents be required, it is recommended that nilotinib 
therapy be interrupted if possible (see section 4.5). If transient interruption of treatment is not possible, 
close monitoring of the individual for prolongation of the QT interval is indicated (see sections 4.2, 
4.5 and 5.2). 
Concomitant use of nilotinib with medicinal products that are potent inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., 
phenytoin, rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and St. John’s Wort) is likely to reduce exposure 
to nilotinib to a clinically relevant extent. Therefore, in patients receiving nilotinib, co-administration 
of alternative therapeutic agents with less potential for CYP3A4 induction should be selected (see 
section 4.5). 
Food effect 
The bioavailability of nilotinib is increased by food. Tasigna must not be taken in conjunction with 
food (see sections 4.2 and 4.5) and should be taken 2 hours after a meal. No food should be consumed 
for at least one hour after the dose is taken. Grapefruit juice and other foods that are known to inhibit 
CYP3A4 should be avoided. For patients who are unable to swallow hard capsules, the content of each 
hard capsule may be dispersed in one teaspoon of apple sauce and should be taken immediately. Not 
more than one teaspoon of apple sauce and no food other than apple sauce must be used (see 
section 5.2). 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
Hepatic impairment has a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of nilotinib. Single dose 
administration of 200 mg of nilotinib resulted in increases in AUC of 35%, 35% and 19% in subjects 
with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to a control group of 
subjects with normal hepatic function. The predicted steady-state Cmax of nilotinib showed an increase 
of 29%, 18% and 22%, respectively. Clinical studies have excluded patients with alanine transaminase 
(ALT) and/or aspartate transaminase (AST) >2.5 (or >5, if related to disease) times the upper limit of 
the normal range and/or total bilirubin >1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range. Metabolism of 
nilotinib is mainly hepatic. Patients with hepatic impairment might therefore have increased exposure 
to nilotinib and should be treated with caution (see section 4.2). 
Serum lipase 
Elevation in serum lipase has been observed. Caution is recommended in patients with previous 
history of pancreatitis. In case lipase elevations are accompanied by abdominal symptoms, nilotinib 
therapy should be interrupted and appropriate diagnostic measures considered to exclude pancreatitis. 
Total gastrectomy 
The bioavailability of nilotinib might be reduced in patients with total gastrectomy (see section 5.2). 
More frequent follow-up of these patients should be considered. 
Tumour lysis syndrome 
Due to possible occurrence of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) correction of clinically significant 
dehydration and treatment of high uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiating nilotinib 
therapy (see section 4.8). 
Lactose 
Tasigna hard capsules contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, 
the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Paediatric population 
Laboratory abnormalities of mild to moderate transient elevations of aminotransferases and total 
bilirubin have been observed in children at a higher frequency than in adults, indicating a higher risk 
of hepatotoxicity in the paediatric population (see section 4.8). Liver function (bilirubin and hepatic 
transaminases levels) should be monitored monthly or as clinically indicated. Elevations of bilirubin 
and hepatic transaminases should be managed by withholding nilotinib temporarily, dose reduction 
and/or discontinuation of nilotinib (see section 4.2). In a study in the CML paediatric population, 
growth retardation has been documented in patients treated with nilotinib (see section 4.8). Close 
monitoring of growth in paediatric patients under nilotinib treatment is recommended. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Tasigna may be given in combination with haematopoietic growth factors such as erythropoietin or 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) if clinically indicated. It may be given with 
hydroxyurea or anagrelide if clinically indicated. 
Nilotinib is mainly metabolised in the liver with CYP3A4 expected to be the main contributor to the 
oxidative metabolism. Nilotinib is also a substrate for the multi-drug efflux pump, P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp). Therefore, absorption and subsequent elimination of systemically absorbed nilotinib may be 
influenced by substances that affect CYP3A4 and/or P-gp. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Substances that may increase nilotinib serum concentrations 
Concomitant administration of nilotinib with imatinib (a substrate and moderator of P-gp and 
CYP3A4), had a slight inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 and/or P-gp. The AUC of imatinib was increased 
by 18% to 39%, and the AUC of nilotinib was increased by 18% to 40%. These changes are unlikely 
to be clinically important. 
The exposure to nilotinib in healthy subjects was increased 3-fold when co-administered with the 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole. Concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, 
including ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin, and telithromycin, 
should therefore be avoided (see section 4.4). Increased exposure to nilotinib might also be expected 
with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Alternative concomitant medicinal products with no or minimal 
CYP3A4 inhibition should be considered. 
Substances that may decrease nilotinib serum concentrations 
Rifampicin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, decreases nilotinib Cmax by 64% and reduces nilotinib AUC by 
80%. Rifampicin and nilotinib should not be used concomitantly. 
The concomitant administration of other medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 (e.g. phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital and St. John’s Wort) is likewise likely to reduce exposure to nilotinib to 
a clinically relevant extent. In patients for whom CYP3A4 inducers are indicated, alternative agents 
with less enzyme induction potential should be selected. 
Nilotinib has pH dependent solubility, with lower solubility at higher pH. In healthy subjects receiving 
esomeprazole at 40 mg once daily for 5 days, gastric pH was markedly increased, but nilotinib 
absorption was only decreased modestly (27% decrease in Cmax and 34% decrease in AUC0-∞). 
Nilotinib may be used concurrently with esomeprazole or other proton pump inhibitors as needed. 
In a study in healthy subjects, no significant change in nilotinib pharmacokinetics was observed when 
a single 400 mg dose of nilotinib was administered 10 hours after and 2 hours before famotidine. 
Therefore, when the concurrent use of a H2 blocker is necessary, it may be administered 
approximately 10 hours before and approximately 2 hours after the dose of Tasigna. 
In the same study as above, administration of an antacid (aluminium hydroxide/magnesium 
hydroxide/simethicone) 2 hours before or after a single 400 mg dose of nilotinib also did not alter 
nilotinib pharmacokinetics. Therefore, if necessary, an antacid may be administered approximately 
2 hours before or approximately 2 hours after the dose of Tasigna. 
Substances that may have their systemic concentration altered by nilotinib 
In vitro, nilotinib is a relatively strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and 
UGT1A1, with Ki value being lowest for CYP2C9 (Ki=0.13 microM). 
A single-dose drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers with 25 mg warfarin, a sensitive 
CYP2C9 substrate, and 800 mg nilotinib did not result in any changes in warfarin pharmacokinetic 
parameters or warfarin pharmacodynamics measured as prothrombin time (PT) and international 
normalised ratio (INR). There are no steady-state data. This study suggests that a clinically meaningful 
drug-drug interaction between nilotinib and warfarin is less likely up to a dose of 25 mg of warfarin. 
Due to lack of steady-state data, control of warfarin pharmacodynamic markers (INR or PT) following 
initiation of nilotinib therapy (at least during the first 2 weeks) is recommended. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In CML patients, nilotinib administered at 400 mg twice daily for 12 days increased the systemic 
exposure (AUC and Cmax) of oral midazolam (a substrate of CYP3A4) 2.6-fold and 2.0-fold, 
respectively. Nilotinib is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. As a result, the systemic exposure of other 
medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) 
may be increased when co-administered with nilotinib. Appropriate monitoring and dose adjustment 
may be necessary for medicinal products that are CYP3A4 substrates and have a narrow therapeutic 
index (including but not limited to alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, 
sirolimus and tacrolimus) when co-administered with nilotinib. 
The combination of nilotinib with those statins that are mainly eliminated by CYP3A4, may increase 
the potential for statin-induced myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. 
Anti-arrhythmic medicinal products and other substances that may prolong the QT interval 
Nilotinib should be used with caution in patients who have or may develop prolongation of the QT 
interval, including those patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products such as amiodarone, 
disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine and sotalol or other medicinal products that may lead to QT 
prolongation such as chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone and 
moxifloxacin (see section 4.4). 
Food interactions 
The absorption and bioavailability of nilotinib are increased if it is taken with food, resulting in a 
higher serum concentration (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). Grapefruit juice and other foods that are 
known to inhibit CYP3A4 should be avoided. 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential have to use highly effective contraception during treatment with 
nilotinib and for up to two weeks after ending treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of nilotinib in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Tasigna should not be used during 
pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with nilotinib. If it is used 
during pregnancy, the patient must be informed of the potential risk to the foetus. 
If a woman who is being treated with nilotinib is considering pregnancy, treatment discontinuation 
may be considered based on the eligibility criteria for discontinuing treatment as described in 
sections 4.2 and 4.4. There is a limited amount of data on pregnancies in patients while attempting 
treatment-free remission (TFR). If pregnancy is planned during the TFR phase, the patient must be 
informed of a potential need to re-initiate nilotinib treatment during pregnancy (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4).

Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether nilotinib is excreted in human milk. Available toxicological data in animals 
have shown excretion of nilotinib in milk (see section 5.3). Since a risk to the newborns/infants cannot 
be excluded, women should not breast-feed during Tasigna treatment and for 2 weeks after the last 
dose. 
Fertility 
Animal studies did not show an effect on fertility in male and female rats (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Tasigna has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, it is 
recommended that patients experiencing dizziness, fatigue, visual impairment or other undesirable 
effects with a potential impact on the ability to drive or use machines safely should refrain from these 
activities as long as the undesirable effects persist (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety profile is based on pooled data from 3,422 patients treated with Tasigna in 13 clinical 
studies in the approved indications: adults and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia 
chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in the chronic phase (5 clinical studies 
with 2,414 patients), adult patients with chronic phase and accelerated phase Philadelphia 
chromosome positive CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib 
(6 clinical studies with 939 patients) and paediatric patients with chronic phase Philadelphia 
chromosome positive CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib 
(2 clinical studies with 69 patients). These pooled data represents 9,039.34 patient-years of exposure. 
The safety profile of nilotinib is consistent across indications. 
The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥15%) from the pooled safety data were: rash 
(26.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (including pharyngitis, nasopharyngitis, rhinitis) (24.8%) 
headache (21.9%), hyperbilirubinaemia (including blood bilirubin increased) (18.6%), arthralgia 
(15.8%), fatigue (15.4%), nausea (16.8%), pruritus (16.7%) and thrombocytopenia (16.4%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Note: Not all adverse drug reactions were observed in paediatric studies. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Sudden death 
Uncommon cases (0.1 to 1%) of sudden deaths have been reported in Tasigna clinical studies and/or 
compassionate use programs in patients with imatinib -resistant or intolerant CML in chronic phase or 
accelerated phase with a past medical history of cardiac disease or significant cardiac risk factors (see 
section 4.4). 
Hepatitis B reactivation 
Hepatitis B reactivation has been reported in association with BCR-ABL TKIs. Some cases resulted in 
acute hepatic failure or fulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome (see 
section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety of nilotinib in paediatric patients (from 2 to <18 years of age) with Philadelphia 
chromosome positive CML in chronic phase (n=58) has been investigated in one main study over a 
period of 60 months (see section 5.1). In paediatric patients, the frequency, type and severity of 
adverse reactions observed have been generally consistent with those observed in adults, with the 
exception of hyperbilirubinaemia/blood bilirubin increase (Grade 3/4: 10.3%) and transaminase 
elevation (AST Grade 3/4: 1.7%, ALT Grade 3/4: 12.1%) which were reported at a higher frequency 
than in adult patients. Bilirubin and hepatic transaminase levels should be monitored during treatment 
(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Growth retardation in paediatric population 
In a study conducted in the CML paediatric population, with a median exposure of 51.9 months in 
newly diagnosed patients and 59.9 months in imatinib/dasatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant Ph+ 
CML-CP patients, growth deceleration (crossing at least two main percentile lines from baseline) was 
observed in eight patients: five (8.6%) crossed two main percentile lines from baseline and three 
(5.2%) crossed three main percentile lines from baseline. Growth retardation related events were 
reported in 3 patients (5.2%). Close monitoring of growth in paediatric patients under nilotinib 
treatment is recommended (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Isolated reports of intentional overdose with nilotinib were reported, where an unspecified number of 
Tasigna hard capsules were ingested in combination with alcohol and other medicinal products. Events 
included neutropenia, vomiting and drowsiness. No ECG changes or hepatotoxicity were reported. 
Outcomes were reported as recovered. 
In the event of overdose, the patient should be observed and appropriate supportive treatment given.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors, ATC 
code: L01EA03. 
Mechanism of action 
Nilotinib is a potent inhibitor of the ABL tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein both in 
cell lines and in primary Philadelphia-chromosome positive leukaemia cells. The substance binds with 
high affinity to the ATP-binding site in such a manner that it is a potent inhibitor of wild-type 
BCR-ABL and maintains activity against 32/33 imatinib-resistant mutant forms of BCR-ABL. As a 
consequence of this biochemical activity, nilotinib selectively inhibits the proliferation and induces 
apoptosis in cell lines and in primary Philadelphia-chromosome positive leukaemia cells from CML 
patients. In murine models of CML, as a single agent nilotinib reduces tumour burden and prolongs 
survival following oral administration. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Nilotinib has little or no effect against the majority of other protein kinases examined, including Src, 
except for the PDGF, KIT and Ephrin receptor kinases, which it inhibits at concentrations within the 
range achieved following oral administration at therapeutic doses recommended for the treatment of 
CML (see Table 4).

Clinical efficacy 
Clinical studies in newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase 
An open-label, multicentre, randomised Phase III study was conducted to determine the efficacy of 
nilotinib versus imatinib in 846 adult patients with cytogenetically confirmed newly diagnosed 
Philadelphia chromosome positive CML in the chronic phase. Patients were within six months of 
diagnosis and were previously untreated, with the exception of hydroxyurea and/or anagrelide. 
Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive either nilotinib 300 mg twice daily (n=282), nilotinib 
400 mg twice daily (n=281) or imatinib 400 mg once daily (n=283). Randomisation was stratified by 
Sokal risk score at the time of diagnosis. 
Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the three treatment arms. Median age was 
47 years in both nilotinib arms and 46 years in the imatinib arm, with 12.8%, 10.0% and 12.4% of 
patients were ≥65 years of age in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, nilotinib 400 mg twice daily and 
imatinib 400 mg once daily treatment arms, respectively. There were slightly more male than female 
patients (56.0%, 62.3% and 55.8%, in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, 400 mg twice daily and 
imatinib 400 mg once daily arm, respectively). More than 60% of all patients were Caucasian and 25% 
of all patients were Asian. 
The primary data analysis time point was when all 846 patients completed 12 months of treatment (or 
discontinued earlier). Subsequent analyses reflect when patients completed 24, 36, 48, 60 and 
72 months of treatment (or discontinued earlier). The median time on treatment was approximately 
70 months in the nilotinib treatment groups and 64 months in the imatinib group. The median actual 
dose intensity was 593 mg/day for nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, 772 mg/day for nilotinib 400 mg 
twice daily and 400 mg/day for imatinib 400 mg once daily. This study is ongoing. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months. MMR was 
defined as ≤0.1% BCR-ABL/ABL% by international scale (IS) measured by RQ-PCR, which 
corresponds to a ≥3 log reduction of BCR-ABL transcript from standardised baseline. The MMR rate 
at 12 months was statistically significantly higher for nilotinib 300 mg twice daily compared to 
imatinib 400 mg once daily (44.3% versus 22.3%, p<0.0001). The rate of MMR at 12 months, was 
also statistically significantly higher for nilotinib 400 mg twice daily compared to imatinib 400 mg 
once daily (42.7% versus 22.3%, p<0.0001). 
The rates of MMR at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months were 8.9%, 33.0%, 43.3% and 44.3% for nilotinib 300 mg 
twice daily, 5.0%, 29.5%, 38.1% and 42.7% for nilotinib 400 mg twice daily and 0.7%, 12.0%, 18.0% 
and 22.3% for imatinib 400 mg once daily. 
The MMR rate at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 months is presented in Table 5.

For all Sokal risk groups, the MMR rates at all time points remained consistently higher in the two 
nilotinib groups than in the imatinib group. 
In a retrospective analysis, 91% (234/258) of patients on nilotinib 300 mg twice daily achieved 
BCR-ABL levels ≤10% at 3 months of treatment compared to 67% (176/264) of patients on imatinib 
400 mg once daily. Patients with BCR-ABL levels ≤10% at 3 months of treatment show a greater 
overall survival at 72 months compared to those who did not achieve this molecular response level 
(94.5% vs. 77.1% respectively [p=0.0005]). 
Based on the Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to first MMR the probability of achieving MMR at 
different time points was higher for both nilotinib at 300 mg and 400 mg twice daily compared to 
imatinib 400 mg once daily (HR=2.17 and stratified log-rank p<0.0001 between nilotinib 300 mg 
twice daily and imatinib 400 mg once daily, HR=1.88 and stratified log-rank p<0.0001 between 
nilotinib 400 mg twice daily and imatinib 400 mg once daily). 
The proportion of patients who had a molecular response of ≤0.01% and ≤0.0032% by IS at different 
time points are presented in Table 6 and the proportion of patients who had a molecular response of 
≤0.01% and ≤0.0032% by IS by different time points are presented in Figures 2 and 3. Molecular 
responses of ≤0.01% and ≤0.0032% by IS correspond to a ≥4 log reduction and ≥4.5 log reduction, 
respectively, of BCR-ABL transcripts from a standardised baseline.

Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates of the duration of first MMR, the proportions of patients who were 
maintaining response for 72 months among patients who achieved MMR were 92.5% (95% CI: 
88.6-96.4%) in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily group, 92.2% (95% CI: 88.5-95.9%) in the nilotinib 
400 mg twice daily group and 88.0% (95% CI: 83.0-93.1%) in the imatinib 400 mg once daily group. 
Complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) was defined as 0% Ph+ metaphases in the bone marrow based 
on a minimum of 20 metaphases evaluated. Best CCyR rate by 12 months (including patients who 
achieved CCyR at or before the 12 month time point as responders) was statistically higher for both 
nilotinib 300 mg and 400 mg twice daily compared to imatinib 400 mg once daily, see Table 7. 
CCyR rate by 24 months (includes patients who achieved CCyR at or before the 24 month time point 
as responders) was statistically higher for both the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice 
daily groups compared to the imatinib 400 mg once daily group.

Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the proportions of patients who were maintaining response for 
72 months among patients who achieved CCyR were 99.1% (95% CI: 97.9-100%) in the nilotinib 
300 mg twice daily group, 98.7% (95% CI: 97.1-100%) in the nilotinib 400 mg twice daily group and 
97.0% (95% CI: 94.7-99.4%) in the imatinib 400 mg once daily group. 
Progression to accelerated phase (AP) or blast crisis (BC) on treatment is defined as the time from the 
date of randomisation to the first documented disease progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis 
or CML-related death. Progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis on treatment was observed in a 
total of 17 patients: 2 patients on nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, 3 patients on nilotinib 400 mg twice 
daily and 12 patients on imatinib 400 mg once daily. The estimated rates of patients free from 
progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis at 72 months were 99.3%, 98.7% and 95.2%, 
respectively (HR=0.1599 and stratified log-rank p=0.0059 between nilotinib 300 mg twice daily and 
imatinib once daily, HR=0.2457 and stratified log-rank p=0.0185 between nilotinib 400 mg twice 
daily and imatinib once daily). No new events of progression to AP/BC were reported on-treatment 
since the 2-year analysis. 
Including clonal evolution as a criterion for progression, a total of 25 patients progressed to 
accelerated phase or blast crisis on treatment by the cut-off date (3 in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily 
group, 5 in the nilotinib 400 mg twice daily group and 17 in the imatinib 400 mg once daily group). 
The estimated rates of patients free from progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis including 
clonal evolution at 72 months were 98.7%, 97.9% and 93.2%, respectively (HR=0.1626 and stratified 
log-rank p=0.0009 between nilotinib 300 mg twice daily and imatinib once daily, HR=0.2848 and 
stratified log-rank p=0.0085 between nilotinib 400 mg twice daily and imatinib once daily). 
A total of 55 patients died during treatment or during the follow-up after discontinuation of treatment 
(21 in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily group, 11 in the nilotinib 400 mg twice daily group and 23 in 
the imatinib 400 mg once daily group). Twenty-six (26) of these 55 deaths were related to CML (6 in 
the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily group, 4 in the nilotinib 400 mg twice daily group and 16 in the 
imatinib 400 mg once daily group). The estimated rates of patients alive at 72 months were 91.6%, 
95.8% and 91.4%, respectively (HR=0.8934 and stratified log-rank p=0.7085 between nilotinib 
300 mg twice daily and imatinib, HR=0.4632 and stratified log-rank p=0.0314 between nilotinib 
400 mg twice daily and imatinib). Considering only CML-related deaths as events, the estimated rates 
of overall survival at 72 months were 97.7%, 98.5% and 93.9%, respectively (HR=0.3694 and 
stratified log-rank p=0.0302 between nilotinib 300 mg twice daily and imatinib, HR=0.2433 and 
stratified log-rank p=0.0061 between nilotinib 400 mg twice daily and imatinib).

Clinical studies in imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML in chronic phase and accelerated phase 
An open-label, uncontrolled, multicentre Phase II study was conducted to determine the efficacy of 
nilotinib in adult patients with imatinib resistant or intolerant CML with separate treatment arms for 
chronic and accelerated phase disease. Efficacy was based on 321 CP patients and 137 AP patients 
enrolled. Median duration of treatment was 561 days for CP patients and 264 days for AP patients (see 
Table 8). Tasigna was administered on a continuous basis (twice daily 2 hours after a meal and with 
no food for at least one hour after administration) unless there was evidence of inadequate response or 
disease progression. The dose was 400 mg twice daily and dose escalation to 600 mg twice daily was 
allowed.

Resistance to imatinib included failure to achieve a complete haematological response (by 3 months), 
cytogenetic response (by 6 months) or major cytogenetic response (by 12 months) or progression of 
disease after a previous cytogenetic or haematological response. Imatinib intolerance included patients 
who discontinued imatinib because of toxicity and were not in major cytogenetic response at time of 
study entry. 
Overall, 73% of patients were imatinib-resistant, while 27% were imatinib-intolerant. The majority of 
patients had a long history of CML that included extensive prior treatment with other antineoplastic 
agents, including imatinib, hydroxyurea, interferon, and some had even failed organ transplant 
(Table 9). The median highest prior imatinib dose had been 600 mg/day. The highest prior imatinib 
dose was 600 mg/day in 74% of all patients, with 40% of patients receiving imatinib doses 
800 mg/day.

The primary endpoint in the CP patients was major cytogenetic response (MCyR), defined as 
elimination (CCyR, complete cytogenetic response) or significant reduction to <35% Ph+ metaphases 
(partial cytogenetic response) of Ph+ haematopoietic cells. Complete haematological response (CHR) 
in CP patients was evaluated as a secondary endpoint. The primary endpoint in the AP patients was 
overall confirmed haematological response (HR), defined as either a complete haematological 
response, no evidence of leukaemia or return to chronic phase.

Chronic phase 
The MCyR rate in 321 CP patients was 51%. Most responders achieved their MCyR rapidly within 
3 months (median 2.8 months) of starting nilotinib treatment and these were sustained. The median 
time to achieve CCyR was just past 3 months (median 3.4 months). Of the patients who achieved 
MCyR, 77% (95% CI: 70% - 84%) were maintaining response at 24 months. Median duration of 
MCyR has not been reached. Of the patients who achieved CCyR, 85% (95% CI: 78% - 93%) were 
maintaining response at 24 months. Median duration of CCyR has not been reached. Patients with a 
CHR at baseline achieved a MCyR faster (1.9 versus 2.8 months). Of CP patients without a baseline 
CHR, 70% achieved a CHR, median time to CHR was 1 month and median duration of CHR was 
32.8 months. The estimated 24-month overall survival rate in CML-CP patients was 87%. 
Accelerated phase 
The overall confirmed HR rate in 137 AP patients was 50%. Most responders achieved a HR early 
with nilotinib treatment (median 1.0 months) and these have been durable (median duration of 
confirmed HR was 24.2 months). Of the patients who achieved HR, 53% (95% CI: 39% - 67%) were 
maintaining response at 24 months. MCyR rate was 30% with a median time to response of 
2.8 months. Of the patients who achieved MCyR, 63% (95% CI: 45% - 80%) were maintaining 
response at 24 months. Median duration of MCyR was 32.7 months. The estimated 24-month overall 
survival rate in CML-AP patients was 70%. 
The rates of response for the two treatment arms are reported in Table 10.

Efficacy data in patients with CML-BC are not yet available. Separate treatment arms were also 
included in the Phase II study to investigate Tasigna in a group of CP and AP patients who had been 
extensively pre-treated with multiple therapies including a tyrosine kinase inhibitor agent in addition 
to imatinib. Of these patients 30/36 (83%) were treatment resistant not intolerant. In 22 CP patients 
evaluated for efficacy nilotinib induced a 32% MCyR rate and a 50% CHR rate. In 11 AP patients, 
evaluated for efficacy, treatment induced a 36% overall HR rate.

After imatinib failure, 24 different BCR-ABL mutations were noted in 42% of chronic phase and 54% 
of accelerated phase CML patients who were evaluated for mutations. Tasigna demonstrated efficacy 
in patients harboring a variety of BCR-ABL mutations associated with imatinib resistance, except 
T315I. 
Treatment discontinuation in adult Ph+ CML patients in chronic phase who have been treated with 
nilotinib as first-line therapy and who have achieved a sustained deep molecular response 
In an open-label, single-arm study, 215 adult patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase treated with 
nilotinib in first-line for ≥2 years who achieved MR4.5 as measured with the MolecularMD MRDx 
BCR-ABL test were enrolled to continue nilotinib treatment for additional 52 weeks (nilotinib 
consolidation phase). 190 of 215 patients (88.4%) entered the TFR phase after achieving a sustained 
deep molecular response during the consolidation phase, defined by the following criteria: 
- 
the 4 last quarterly assessments (taken every 12 weeks) were at least MR4.0 (BCR-ABL/ABL 
≤0.01% IS), and maintained for one year 
the last assessment being MR4.5 (BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.0032% IS) 
no more than two assessments falling between MR4.0 and MR4.5 
(0.0032% IS < BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.01% IS). 
- 
- 
The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients in MMR at 48 weeks after starting the TFR phase 
(considering any patient who required re-initiation of treatment as non-responder).

[2] For 2 patients, PCR assessment was not available at week 264 therefore their response was not 
considered for the week 264 data cut-off analysis. 
The time by which 50% of all retreated patients regained MMR and MR4.5 was 7 and 12.9 weeks, 
respectively. The cumulative rate of MMR regained at 24 weeks after treatment re-initiation was 
97.8% (89/91 patients) and MR4.5 regained at 48 weeks was 91.2% (83/91 patients). 
The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median treatment-free survival (TFS) was 120.1 weeks (95% CI: 36.9, 
not estimable [NE]) (Figure 4); 91 of 190 patients (47.9%) did not have a TFS event.

Treatment discontinuation in adult CML patients in chronic phase who have achieved a sustained 
deep molecular response on nilotinib treatment following prior imatinib therapy 
In an open-label, single-arm study, 163 adult patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase taking tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for ≥3 years (imatinib as initial TKI therapy for more than 4 weeks without 
documented MR4.5 on imatinib at the time of switch to nilotinib, then switched to nilotinib for at least 
two years), and who achieved MR4.5 on nilotinib treatment as measured with the MolecularMD 
MRDx BCR-ABL test were enrolled to continue nilotinib treatment for additional 52 weeks (nilotinib 
consolidation phase). 126 of 163 patients (77.3%) entered the TFR phase after achieving a sustained 
deep molecular response during the consolidation phase, defined by the following criterion: 
- 
The 4 last quarterly assessments (taken every 12 weeks) showed no confirmed loss of MR4.5 
(BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.0032% IS) during one year. 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients without confirmed loss of MR4.0 or loss of MMR 
within 48 weeks following treatment discontinuation.

Paediatric population 
In the main paediatric study conducted with nilotinib, a total of 58 patients from 2 to <18 years of age 
(25 patients newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase and 33 patients imatinib/dasatinib-resistant 
or imatinib-intolerant Ph+ CML in chronic phase) received nilotinib treatment at a dose of 230 mg/m2 
twice daily, rounded to the nearest 50 mg dose (to a maximum single dose of 400 mg). Key study data 
are summarised in Table 13.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Peak concentrations of nilotinib are reached 3 hours after oral administration. Nilotinib absorption 
following oral administration was approximately 30%. The absolute bioavailability of nilotinib has not 
been determined. As compared to an oral drink solution (pH of 1.2 to 1.3), relative bioavailability of 
nilotinib capsule is approximately 50%. In healthy volunteers, Cmax and area under the serum 
concentration-time curve (AUC) of nilotinib are increased by 112% and 82%, respectively, compared 
to fasting conditions when Tasigna is given with food. Administration of Tasigna 30 minutes or 
2 hours after food increased bioavailability of nilotinib by 29% or 15%, respectively (see sections 4.2, 
4.4 and 4.5). 
Nilotinib absorption (relative bioavailability) might be reduced by approximately 48% and 22% in 
patients with total gastrectomy and partial gastrectomy, respectively. 
Distribution 
The blood-to-plasma ratio of nilotinib is 0.71. Plasma protein binding is approximately 98% on the 
basis of in vitro experiments. 
Biotransformation 
Main metabolic pathways identified in healthy subjects are oxidation and hydroxylation. Nilotinib is 
the main circulating component in the serum. None of the metabolites contribute significantly to the 
pharmacological activity of nilotinib. Nilotinib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4, with possible 
minor contribution from CYP2C8. 
Elimination 
After a single dose of radiolabelled nilotinib in healthy subjects, more than 90% of the dose was 
eliminated within 7 days, mainly in faeces (94% of the dose). Unchanged nilotinib accounted for 69% 
of the dose. 
The apparent elimination half-life estimated from the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics with daily 
dosing was approximately 17 hours. Inter-patient variability in nilotinib pharmacokinetics was 
moderate to high. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Steady-state nilotinib exposure was dose-dependent, with less than dose-proportional increases in 
systemic exposure at dose levels higher than 400 mg given as once-daily dosing. Daily systemic 
exposure to nilotinib with 400 mg twice-daily dosing at steady state was 35% higher than with 800 mg 
once-daily dosing. Systemic exposure (AUC) of nilotinib at steady state at a dose level of 400 mg 
twice daily was approximately 13.4% higher than at a dose level of 300 mg twice daily. The average 
nilotinib trough and peak concentrations over 12 months were approximately 15.7% and 14.8% higher 
following 400 mg twice-daily dosing compared to 300 mg twice daily. There was no relevant increase 
in exposure to nilotinib when the dose was increased from 400 mg twice daily to 600 mg twice daily. 
Steady-state conditions were essentially achieved by day 8. An increase in serum exposure to nilotinib 
between the first dose and steady state was approximately 2-fold for daily dosing and 3.8-fold for 
twice-daily dosing. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bioavailability/bioequivalence studies 
Single-dose administration of 400 mg nilotinib, using 2 hard capsules of 200 mg whereby the content 
of each hard capsule was dispersed in one teaspoon of apple sauce, was shown to be bioequivalent 
with a single-dose administration of 2 intact hard capsules of 200 mg. 
Paediatric population 
Following administration of nilotinib in paediatric patients at 230 mg/m2 twice daily, rounded to the 
nearest 50 mg dose (to a maximum single dose of 400 mg), steady-state exposure and clearance of 
nilotinib were found to be similar (within 2-fold) to adult patients treated with 400 mg twice daily. The 
pharmacokinetic exposure of nilotinib following a single or multiple doses appeared to be comparable 
between paediatric patients from 2 years to <10 years and from ≥10 years to <18 years. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Nilotinib has been evaluated in safety pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, 
reproductive toxicity, phototoxicity and carcinogenicity (rats and mice) studies. 
Safety pharmacology studies 
Nilotinib did not have effects on CNS or respiratory functions. In vitro cardiac safety studies 
demonstrated a preclinical signal for QT prolongation, based upon block of hERG currents and 
prolongation of the action potential duration in isolated rabbit hearts by nilotinib. No effects were seen 
in ECG measurements in dogs or monkeys treated for up to 39 weeks or in a special telemetry study in 
dogs. 
Repeated-dose toxicity studies 
Repeated-dose toxicity studies in dogs of up to 4 weeks’ duration and in cynomolgus monkeys of up 
to 9 months’ duration revealed the liver as the primary target organ of toxicity of nilotinib. Alterations 
included increased alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activity and histopathology 
findings (mainly sinusoidal cell or Kupffer cell hyperplasia/hypertrophy, bile duct hyperplasia and 
periportal fibrosis). In general the changes in clinical chemistry were fully reversible after a four-week 
recovery period and the histological alterations showed partial reversibility. Exposures at the lowest 
dose levels at which the liver effects were seen were lower than the exposure in humans at a dose of 
800 mg/day. Only minor liver alterations were seen in mice or rats treated for up to 26 weeks. Mainly 
reversible increases in cholesterol levels were seen in rats, dogs and monkeys. 
Genotoxicity studies 
Genotoxicity studies in bacterial in vitro systems and in mammalian in vitro and in vivo systems with 
and without metabolic activation did not reveal any evidence for a mutagenic potential of nilotinib. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Carcinogenicity studies 
In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, the major target organ for non-neoplastic lesions was the uterus 
(dilatation, vascular ectasia, endothelial cell hyperplasia, inflammation and/or epithelial hyperplasia). 
There was no evidence of carcinogenicity upon administration of nilotinib at 5, 15 and 40 mg/kg/day. 
Exposures (in terms of AUC) at the highest dose level represented approximately 2x to 3x human 
daily steady-state exposure (based on AUC) to nilotinib at the dose of 800 mg/day. 
In the 26-week Tg.rasH2 mouse carcinogenicity study, in which nilotinib was administered at 30, 100 
and 300 mg/kg/day, skin papillomas/carcinomas were detected at 300 mg/kg, representing 
approximately 30 to 40 times (based on AUC) the human exposure at the maximum approved dose of 
800 mg/day (administered as 400 mg twice daily). The No-Observed-Effect-Level for the skin 
neoplastic lesions was 100 mg/kg/day, representing approximately 10 to 20 times the human exposure 
at the maximum approved dose of 800 mg/day (administered as 400 mg twice daily). The major target 
organs for non-neoplastic lesions were the skin (epidermal hyperplasia), the growing teeth 
(degeneration/atrophy of the enamel organ of upper incisors and inflammation of the 
gingiva/odontogenic epithelium of incisors) and the thymus (increased incidence and/or severity of 
decreased lymphocytes). 
Reproductive toxicity and fertility studies 
Nilotinib did not induce teratogenicity, but did show embryo- and foetotoxicity at doses that also 
showed maternal toxicity. Increased post-implantation loss was observed in both the fertility study, 
which involved treatment of both males and females, and the embryotoxicity study, which involved 
treatment of females. Embryo-lethality and foetal effects (mainly decreased foetal weights, premature 
fusion of the facial bones (fused maxilla/zygomatic) visceral and skeletal variations) in rats and 
increased resorption of foetuses and skeletal variations in rabbits were present in the embryotoxicity 
studies. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, maternal exposure to nilotinib caused 
reduced pup body weight with associated changes in physical development parameters as well as 
reduced mating and fertility indices in the offspring. Exposure to nilotinib in females at 
No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Levels was generally less or equal to that in humans at 800 mg/day. 
No effects on sperm count/motility or on fertility were noted in male and female rats up to the highest 
tested dose, approximately 5 times the recommended dosage for humans. 
Juvenile animal studies 
In a juvenile development study, nilotinib was administered via oral gavage to juvenile rats from the 
first week post partum through young adult (day 70 post partum) at doses of 2, 6 and 20 mg/kg/day. 
Besides standard study parameters, evaluations of developmental landmarks, CNS effects, mating and 
fertility were performed. Based on a reduction in body weight in both genders and a delayed preputial 
separation in males (which may be associated with the reduction in weight), the 
No-Observed-Effect-Level in juvenile rats was considered to be 6 mg/kg/day. The juvenile animals 
did not exert increased sensitivity to nilotinib relative to adults. In addition, the toxicity profile in 
juvenile rats was comparable to that observed in adult rats. 
Phototoxicity studies 
Nilotinib was shown to absorb light in the UV-B and UV-A range, is distributed into the skin and 
showed a phototoxic potential in vitro, but no effects have been observed in vivo. Therefore the risk 
that nilotinib causes photosensitisation in patients is considered very low.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tasigna is and what it is used for 
What Tasigna is 
Tasigna is a medicine containing an active substance called nilotinib. 
What Tasigna is used for 
Tasigna is used to treat a type of leukaemia called Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid 
leukaemia (Ph-positive CML). CML is a cancer of the blood which makes the body produce too many 
abnormal white blood cells. 
Tasigna is used in adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed CML or in patients with CML 
who are no longer benefiting from previous treatment including imatinib. It is also used in adult and 
paediatric patients who experienced serious side effects with previous treatment and are not able to 
continue taking it. 
How Tasigna works 
In patients with CML, a change in DNA (genetic material) triggers a signal that tells the body to 
produce abnormal white blood cells. Tasigna blocks this signal, and thus stops the production of these 
cells. 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Monitoring during Tasigna treatment 
Regular tests, including blood tests, will be performed during treatment. These tests will monitor: 
- 
the amount of blood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets) in the body to see 
how Tasigna is tolerated. 
pancreas and liver function in the body to see how Tasigna is tolerated. 
the electrolytes in the body (potassium, magnesium). These are important in the functioning of 
the heart. 
the level of sugar and fats in the blood. 
- 
The heart rate will also be checked using a machine that measures electrical activity of the heart (a test 
called an “ECG”). 
- 
- 
Your doctor will regularly evaluate your treatment and decide whether you should continue to take 
Tasigna. If you are told to discontinue this medicine, your doctor will continue to monitor your CML 
and may tell you to re-start Tasigna if your condition indicates that this is necessary. 
If you have any questions about how Tasigna works or why it has been prescribed for you or your 
child, ask your doctor. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Tasigna 
Follow all the doctor’s instructions carefully. They may differ from the general information contained 
in this leaflet. 
Do not take Tasigna 
- 
if you are allergic to nilotinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic, tell your doctor before taking Tasigna. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tasigna: 
- 
if you have suffered prior cardiovascular events such as a heart attack, chest pain (angina), 
problems with the blood supply to your brain (stroke) or problems with the blood flow to your 
leg (claudication) or if you have risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high blood 
pressure (hypertension), diabetes or problems with the level of fats in your blood (lipid 
disorders). 
if you have a heart disorder, such as an abnormal electrical signal called “prolongation of the 
QT interval”. 
if you are being treated with medicines that lower your blood cholesterol (statins), or affect the 
heartbeat (anti-arrhythmics) or the liver (see Other medicines and Tasigna). 
if you suffer from lack of potassium or magnesium. 
if you have a liver or pancreas disorder. 
if you have symptoms such as easy bruising, feeling tired or short of breath or have experienced 
repeated infections. 
if you have had a surgical procedure involving the removal of the entire stomach (total 
gastrectomy). 
if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Tasigna could 
cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will be 
carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
If any of these apply to you or your child, tell your doctor. 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During treatment with Tasigna 
- 
if you faint (loss of consciousness) or have an irregular heart beat while taking this medicine, 
tell your doctor immediately as this may be a sign of a serious heart condition. Prolongation of 
the QT interval or an irregular heart beat may lead to sudden death. Uncommon cases of sudden 
death have been reported in patients taking Tasigna. 
if you have sudden heart palpitations, severe muscle weakness or paralysis, seizures or sudden 
changes in your thinking or level of alertness, tell your doctor immediately as this may be a 
sign of a fast breakdown of cancer cells called tumour lysis syndrome. Rare cases of tumour 
lysis syndrome have been reported in patients treated with Tasigna. 
if you develop chest pain or discomfort, numbness or weakness, problems with walking or with 
your speech, pain, discolouration or a cool feeling in a limb, tell your doctor immediately as 
this may be a sign of a cardiovascular event. Serious cardiovascular events including problems 
with the blood flow to the leg (peripheral arterial occlusive disease), ischaemic heart disease and 
problems with the blood supply to the brain (ischaemic cerebrovascular disease) have been 
reported in patients taking Tasigna. Your doctor should assess the level of fats (lipids) and sugar 
in your blood before initiating treatment with Tasigna and during treatment. 
if you develop swelling of the feet or hands, generalised swelling or rapid weight gain tell your 
doctor as these may be signs of severe fluid retention. Uncommon cases of severe fluid 
retention have been reported in patients treated with Tasigna.

These medicines should be avoided during your treatment with Tasigna. If you are taking any of these, 
your doctor might prescribe other alternative medicines. 
If you are taking a statin (a type of medicine to lower your blood cholesterol), talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist. If used with certain statins, Tasigna may increase the risk of statin-related muscle 
problems, which on rare occasions can lead to serious muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis) resulting 
in kidney damage. 
In addition, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tasigna if you are taking any antacids, which 
are medicines against heartburn. These medicines need to be taken separately from Tasigna: 
- 
H2 blockers, which decrease the production of acid in the stomach. H2 blockers should be taken 
approximately 10 hours before and approximately 2 hours after you take Tasigna; 
antacids such as those containing aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide and simethicone, 
which neutralise high acidity in the stomach. These antacids should be taken approximately 
2 hours before or approximately 2 hours after you take Tasigna. 
- 
You should also tell your doctor if you are already taking Tasigna and you are prescribed a new 
medicine that you have not taken previously during Tasigna treatment. 
Tasigna with food and drink 
Do not take Tasigna with food. Food may enhance the absorption of Tasigna and therefore increase 
the amount of Tasigna in the blood, possibly to a harmful level. Do not drink grapefruit juice or eat 
grapefruit. It may increase the amount of Tasigna in the blood, possibly to a harmful level. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
- 
Tasigna is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If you are pregnant 
or think that you may be, tell your doctor who will discuss with you whether you can take this 
medicine during your pregnancy. 
-  Women who might get pregnant are advised to use highly effective contraception during 
- 
treatment and for up to two weeks after ending treatment. 
Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with Tasigna and for two weeks after the 
last dose. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
If you experience side effects (such as dizziness or visual disorders) with a potential impact on the 
ability to safely drive or use any tools or machines after taking this medicine, you should refrain from 
these activities until the effect has disappeared. 
Tasigna contains lactose 
This medicine contains lactose (also known as milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that 
you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.

If you stop taking Tasigna 
Do not stop taking this medicine unless your doctor tells you to do so. Stopping Tasigna without your 
doctor’s recommendation places you at risk for worsening of your disease which could have 
life-threatening consequences. Be sure to discuss with your doctor, nurse, and/or pharmacist if you are 
considering stopping Tasigna. 
If your doctor recommends that you discontinue treatment with Tasigna 
Your doctor will regularly evaluate your treatment with a specific diagnostic test and decide whether 
you should continue to take this medicine. If you are told to discontinue Tasigna, your doctor will 
continue to carefully monitor your CML before, during and after you have discontinued Tasigna and 
may tell you to re-start Tasigna if your condition indicates that this is necessary. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

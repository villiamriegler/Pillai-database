Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Ilaris, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
1.  Based  on  a  review  of  the  accumulated  safety  information  for  canakinumab,  “Opportunistic 
infections” was identified by the MAH as a new safety finding and the MAH proposed to upgrade this risk 
from potential to an important identified risk in version 8.0 of the RMP submitted with this PSUR. In 
addition the MAH proposed to update section 4.4 to amend the current warning and specify which type 
of opportunistic infections, and to update section 4.8 of the SmPC to include that opportunistic infections 
have  been  reported  in  patients  treated  with  canakinumab.  Consequently  section  4  of  the  Package 
Leaflet was proposed to also be amended. 
2.  Based on a review of accumulated safety information for canakinumab on “overdosage”, the MAH 
proposed to update the RMP and section 4.9 of the SmPC to include that reported experience is limited 
and to include that higher doses than recommended have been administered in clinical trials without 
signs of acute toxicity.  
3.  Therefore, in view of available data, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information 
were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Ilaris, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance canakinumab is favourable subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

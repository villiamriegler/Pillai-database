1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Europe) Ltd. submitted on 25 July 2017 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Symkevi, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The 
eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 13 October 2016. 
Symkevi, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/17/1828 on 27 February 2017 in the 
following condition: treatment of Cystic Fibrosis (CF).  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Symkevi is indicated in a combination regimen with Kalydeco (ivacaftor 150 mg tablet) for the 
treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the 
F508del mutation or who have at least one mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR) gene that is responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor based on in vitro and/or clinical 
evidence (see section 5.1). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application.  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0193/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0193/2017 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Symkevi as an orphan medicinal product in the

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities 
and high premature mortality, and at present, there is no cure. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations 
in the CFTR gene that result in absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The 
CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride channel responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and water 
absorption and secretion. The failure to regulate chloride transport in these organs results in the 
multisystem pathology associated with CF. In patients with CF, loss of chloride transport due to defects 
in the CFTR protein result in the accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of 
exocrine pancreatic function, impaired intestinal absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated 
sweat chloride concentration. Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people 
with CF. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
CF affects approximately 30,000 individuals in the United States (US) and 32,000 in the EU. The 
incidence and prevalence of CF varies between racial groups; CF is considerably more common in the 
Caucasian populations of North America and Europe than in Asian and African populations. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride ion (CL-) channel located in the epithelia of multiple organs, 
including lungs, pancreas, intestinal tract, liver, and vas deferens, that is responsible for aiding in the 
regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion. More than 1900 mutations in the CFTR gene 
have been identified. These can be classified according to the mechanisms by which they disrupt CFTR 
function. Stop codon mutations (class I) result in a truncated non-functional CFTR, class II mutations 
consist of aberrantly folded CFTR protein that is degraded by the cell quality control system, while 
class III mutations lead to defective regulation of the CFTR protein and, consequently, the absence of 
CFTR function. These three classes usually lead to a classic CF phenotype with pancreatic insufficiency. 
CFTR mutations that lead to defective chloride conductance are grouped together in class IV. Class V 
mutations interfere with normal transcription, thereby reducing the amount of otherwise normal CFTR. 
These latter two classes are mostly associated with a milder expression of the disease.  
The most prevalent mutation is an in-frame deletion in the CFTR gene resulting in a loss of 
phenylalanine at position 508 in the CFTR protein (F508del-CFTR) and it is a Class II mutation: it 
prevents most of the CFTR protein from reaching the cell surface, resulting in little-to-no chloride 
transport. The decrease in the amount of F508del-CFTR at the cell surface is due to a defect in the 
processing and trafficking of the F508del-CFTR protein. The very small amount of F508del-CFTR 
protein that reaches the cell surface also has defective channel gating and a decreased stability at the 
cell surface. Patients who are homozygous with F508del-CFTR defects have little or no CFTR protein at 
the cell surface and hence suffer from a severe form of CF disease.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 11/165 
 
 
 
 
 
CF-causing mutations can be divided into 2 groups based on the extent of loss of chloride transport 
caused by the mutation. A complete or near complete loss of CFTR chloride transport is referred to as 
“minimal function” of CFTR. A less complete loss of CFTR-mediated chloride transport is referred to as 
“residual function” of CFTR.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The median predicted survival for CF patients in the United States was 39.3 years (95% CI, 37.3-41.4) 
according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation 2014 Registry Report. The classic or typical form of cystic 
fibrosis (CF) is diagnosed if a patient demonstrates clinical disease in one or more organ systems and 
has elevated sweat chloride (≥60 mmol/L). Most of these patients have disease manifestations in 
multiple organ systems (pancreas, upper and lower respiratory tract, and male reproductive tract). 
However, patients may demonstrate mild or atypical symptoms.  About 2 percent of patients fulfil 
diagnostic criteria for CF but have a normal or intermediate sweat chloride result, indicating that there 
is a wide spectrum of severity in CF. 
2.1.5.  Management 
CF medications range from CFTR modulators and enzyme supplements, to mucolytics, antibiotics, and 
vitamins. Current treatment guidelines recommend CFTR modulator and non-modulator medications 
concomitantly administered to maintain and improve lung function, reduce the risk of infections and 
exacerbations, and improve quality of life. As stated before, cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in 
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that affect the production of the 
CFTR protein.  Drugs that target the underlying defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) protein are called CFTR modulators. CFTR modulators are small 
molecules that target specific defects caused by mutations in the CFTR gene and thus treat the 
underlying cause of the disease. CFTR modulators are not intended as a replacement for or an 
alternative to any of the current non-modulator therapies, but rather provide added benefit. The goal 
of therapy is to maintain and restore respiratory function.  
There are two main types of modulators, potentiators and correctors. Potentiators recover the function 
of the CFTR protein at the apical surface of epithelial cells that is disrupted in class III and IV genetic 
mutations, while correctors improve intracellular processing of the CFTR protein, increasing surface 
expression, in class II mutations. A third type is production correctors or read-through agents, which 
promote transcription of CFTR in class I mutations.  Potentiators help chloride flow through the CFTR 
protein channel at the cell surface. The CFTR protein is shaped like a tunnel that can be closed by a 
gate. Potentiators hold the gate open so chloride can flow through. By holding the gate on the CFTR 
protein open, potentiators allow more chloride to flow through and reduce the symptoms of CF. 
However, there is an inter-dependence between channel gating and cellular processing given that each 
depend on CFTR protein folding, thus a sharp distinction between potentiators and correctors is 
somewhat artificial.  
Kalydeco (ivacaftor, IVA) and Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor, LUM/IVA) are the only CFTR modulators 
approved for CF patients with specific mutations. Ivacaftor (in Kalydeco as mono-component and in 
Orkambi as part of a fixed dose combination) is a potentiator, the active substance lumacaftor is a 
corrector (present in the fixed dose combination Orkambi).  Clinical efficacy of ivacaftor monotherapy 
has been established in Class III mutations that cause defects in channel gating as well as in the Class 
III/IV mutation R117H. Clinical efficacy of the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor has been 
established in patients homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. However, some 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 12/165 
 
 
 
 
 
patients are not able to tolerate treatment with LUM/IVA due to respiratory events related to off-target 
effects of the lumacaftor component. In addition, lumacaftor is a strong CYP3A inducer and some 
patients may not take it because of the DDI. Currently, no corrector-potentiator therapy is available in 
patients who have the F508del mutation and a residual function mutation in the CFTR gene. The 
combination TEZ/IVA could be of interest for CF patients who have the F508del mutation and a 
mutation in CFTR gene that is responsive to TEZ/IVA and also may be an alternative for CF patients 
who are homozygous for F508del and cannot tolerate LUM/IVA.

improving activity of CFTR in the lungs, which is necessary to produce thin, normal mucus. Tezacaftor 
is a CFTR corrector that facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of normal or multiple mutant 
forms of CFTR (including F508del-CFTR) to increase the amount of functional CFTR protein delivered to 
the cell surface, resulting in increased chloride transport. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that 
potentiates the channel-open probability (or gating) of CFTR at the cell surface to increase chloride 
transport. For ivacaftor to function, CFTR protein must be present at the cell surface. Ivacaftor can 
potentiate the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface by tezacaftor, leading to a further 
enhancement of chloride transport than either agent alone. The combined effect of tezacaftor and 
ivacaftor is increased quantity and function of CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increases in 
chloride transport, airway surface liquid height, and ciliary beat frequency, see Figure 1 below.

TEZ/IVA combination therapy is proposed to be dosed orally each day in 2 tablets as follows: 
-  Morning dose: 1 fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet containing 100 mg TEZ and 150 mg IVA, 
supplied as a yellow, film-coated tablet. 
- 
Evening dose: 1 tablet containing 150 mg IVA, supplied as a blue, film-coated tablet. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the fact that due the designs of 
performed studies, patient populations included, uncertainties aroused whether the claimed unmet 
medical need would be addressed by TEZ/IVA. Furthermore, the proposed combination of TEZ/IVA was 
not considered to be of major public health interest for patients with CF aged 12 years and older who 
have the F508del mutation and a residual function mutation in the CFTR gene, or for patients with CF 
aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene, who are not 
able to take Orkambi due to concomitant medications or those who may not be able to tolerate 
Orkambi, nor is it considered a major therapeutic innovation.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Ivacaftor 
General information 
The  chemical-pharmaceutical  documentation  provided  for  ivacaftor  in  this  marketing  authorisation 
dossier is the same as provided and accepted for Kalydeco and Orkambi dossiers.  
The chemical name of ivacaftor is: N-(2,4-di-tert-butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-
3-carboxamide or  N-(2,4-di-tert-butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxamide.  
The compound has the following molecular structure: 
Figure 2 ivacaftor structure 
Molecular formula: C24H28N2O3                            Molecular weight: 392.49 g·mol-1 
Ivacaftor has a non-chiral molecular structure.  
The structure of ivacaftor has been confirmed by elemental analysis, 1H-, 13C- and two dimensional 
NMR spectroscopy, UV-Visible spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and crystallographic analysis. 
The active substance is a white to off-white crystalline slightly hygroscopic solid which is practically 
insoluble in water and buffers with pH 1.0-7.0, slightly soluble in ethanol, methanol and acetone and 
soluble in 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran.   
Multiple polymorphic forms have been identified for ivacaftor. The active substance produced by the 
proposed manufacturing process consists of a mixture of two major crystalline neat polymorphic forms, 
Form B and Form C. The control of the final isolation and drying conditions ensures that mixtures of 
the neat crystalline forms B and C are consistently produced. Nevertheless, the polymorphic form of 
ivacaftor during the synthesis of the active substance is not a CQA since during the manufacture of the 
drug product, ivacaftor is fully dissolved in a spray-drying solvent system to provide an amorphous 
intermediate, which is then converted to the final drug product. Therefore ivacaftor’s physical form is 
only a CQA for ivacaftor SDD (spray dried dispersion) and the final tablets, since it is critical to 
maintain the amorphous form to ensure bioavailability.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
A Quality by Design (QbD) approach was also used for the development of ivacaftor. The 
manufacturing process consists of four main steps using commercially available well defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications.  
The starting materials were agreed during the assessment of the approved Kalydeco dossier. The 
synthetic routes for the starting materials have been described in detail and all potential related 
impurities or degradation products have been described and characterized. There are different 
suppliers for each starting material. However, the same synthetic route is used by the different 
suppliers of the same starting material. Description of the manufacturing process of the active 
substance including the in-process controls is adequate. 
A QbD approach has also been used in product and process development of ivacaftor. For the active 
substance synthesis, a combination of multivariate analyses and range-finding studies was used to 
define a design space for each step (namely, coupling, methanololysis, form conversion/crystallization 
and drying). All parameters with a potential impact on CQAs of the active substance were identified 
and thoroughly investigated. The applicant has proposed a combination of proven acceptable ranges 
(PARs) and design spaces for the manufacturing process of the active substance.  
Although  the  design  spaces  were  developed  at  small  laboratory  scales,  a  design  space  verification 
protocol providing demonstration of the risk of scale dependence of the parameters which define each 
design  space  was  submitted.  For  the  first  three  design  spaces  (coupling,  methanolys,  and  ivacaftor 
form conversion/crystallization), the assessment concluded that there is low risk of scale dependence 
and,  therefore,  the  ranges  defined  at  laboratory  scale  are  applicable  to  commercial  scale.  This  is 
supported  by  confirmatory  experiments,  and  scale  up/down  calculations  conducted  at  pilot  scale  at 
the higher risk points in the design space. For the design space of drying of ivacaftor drug substance, 
the  engineering-based  assessment  determined  that  there  is  a  higher  risk  of  scale  dependence  than 
for the other three design spaces. Drying data were collected from the commercial scale and multiple 
confirmatory  experiments,  supported  by  appropriate  engineering  modelling,  and  scale  up/down 
calculations were conducted. The robustness of the process has been confirmed with the manufacture 
of fifteen large-scale batches of ivacaftor drug substance, which have consistently met the acceptance 
criteria  for  all  drug  substance  CQAs.  The  available  development  data,  the  proposed  control  strategy 
and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed design spaces. 
Ivacaftor drug substance is packaged inside a low density polyethylene (LDPE) bag and secured with 
an appropriate closure (twist tie or equivalent). The bag is then placed inside a second LDPE bag and 
secured  appropriately;  the  closed  LDPE  bags  are  placed  into  a  secondary  container  suitable  for 
storage  and  shipping.  The  LDPE  is  compliant  with  the  Directive  2002/72/EC  and  the  European 
Pharmacopoeia Monograph 3.1.3 “Polyolefins”. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for includes tests for appearance (visual inspection), 
identification (FTIR), assay (HPLC), organic impurities (HPLC), acetamide (GC-MS), inorganic 
impurities-sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), and residual solvents (GC).  
Assessment report

A detailed study on the potential, theoretical and observed organic impurities has been presented. 
Impurity limits in the specification are justified and found safe. The limit proposed for acetamide 
(hydrolysis by-product of the process solvent acetonitrile) in the active substance has been established 
according to the Guideline on the Limits of Genotoxic Impurities. Limits for polymorphic form and 
particle size are not included; this is not necessary considering that the active substance is completely 
dissolved as part of the finished product manufacturing process. 
The limits set for specification parameters are acceptable and in line with batch results, stability 
studies and CHMP guidelines. Analytical methods used are sufficiently described and fully validated in 
line with the CHMP requirements.   
All batch results (including those of the batches used in the clinical studies) are in compliance with the 
proposed specification. 
Stability 
The stability data are the same as approved to date. Stability data on three pilot scale batches of 
active substance from the proposed manufacturers stored in the intended commercial package for 60 
months under long term conditions at 30 °C / 65% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions at 40 °C / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, related substances, water content, physical 
form, microbial limits and water activity. The analytical methods used were the same as for release, 
with the addition of XRPD for physical form determination, and were stability indicating. 
No trends in the assay or water content data were observed through 60months of storage at 30 °C / 
65% RH. Although a statistically significant trend was observed for these parameters on samples 
stored at 40 °C / 75% RH through 6 months, all results remained well within the commercial 
specification acceptance limit. The XRPD stability data show that ivacaftor remains crystalline at all test 
points under all storage conditions. In addition, data presented show no increase on water activity 
levels and no change in microbial content after storage for 12 months at 30 °C /6 5% RH. Thus, all 
tested parameters remained within the commercial specification acceptance limits.  
Ivacaftor active substance was also subjected to stress conditions including exposure to heat and heat 
combined with humidity for up to 21 days, treatment under acidic, basic, neutral and oxidative 
conditions for up to 14 days, exposure to pH 4 and pH 7 for up to 7 days and exposure to light 
conforming to ICH Q1B option 2 requirements. Ivacaftor was found to be the least stable under basic 
conditions and when in solution exposed to light. No degradation was observed when ivacaftor was 
exposed to the other stress conditions. Analysis of the stressed samples confirmed that the commercial 
HPLC method for assay and organic impurities determination in ivacaftor active substance is stability 
indicating. 
In addition, photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch.  The 
data, showing no changes in the fully exposed test sample and the covered control, confirm that 
ivacaftor drug substance is photostable and therefore does not require light protective packaging. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 30 months in the proposed 
container closure system, which is the one authorised in Kalydeco and Orkambi.

Tezacaftor 
General information 
The chemical name of tezacaftor is: 1-(2,2-difluoro-2H-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-N-{1-[(2R)-2,3-
dihydroxypropyl]-6-fluoro-2-(1-hydroxy-2-methylpropan-2-yl)-1Hindol-5-yl}cyclopropane-1-
carboxamide corresponding to the molecular formula C26H27N2F3O6. It has a molecular weight of 
520.50 g/mol and the following molecular structure: 
Figure 3 tezacaftor structure 
Tezacaftor exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. The active substance is 
the R-isomer. The chirality of the active substance is assured by chiral control of the starting materials. 
The downstream chemistry does not promote racemization of the stereocenter.  This was supported by 
spiking and stability studies. 
The chemical structure of tezacaftor was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, 1H, 13C, 
and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis, IR and Raman spectroscopy, high resolution mass 
spectrometry and crystallographic analysis.  
Tezacaftor is a non-hygroscopic white to off-white crystalline solid. The substance is practically 
insoluble in aqueous solvents tested at pH = 1.0-9.0 and more soluble in organic solvents. It is 
practically insoluble in fasted state simulated intestinal fluid, and very slightly soluble in fed state 
simulated intestinal fluid at room temperature and 37°C. Because of its poor solubility in water, a SDD, 
where the active substance is in an amorphous form to provide sufficient oral bioavailability was 
developed (see finished product section). 
Physical characterization of tezacaftor was conducted by X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning 
calorimetry, thermal gravimetric analysis and dynamic vapour sorption. The physical form of tezacaftor 
active substance manufactured by the proposed commercial process has been confirmed. To 
understand the polymorph landscape of tezacaftor, a comprehensive polymorph screening was 
conducted.  
During the manufacture of the SDD, tezacaftor is completely dissolved in methanol process solvent, 
therefore polymorphic form and particle size are not CQAs. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The  commercial  manufacturing  process  for  the  synthesis  of  tezacaftor  involves  seven  steps  from 
commercially  available  well-defined  starting  materials  with  acceptable  specifications  and  three 
crystallizations. The selected starting materials in the synthesis are approvable, in view of ICH Q11 and 
its Q&A, and the CHMP guideline on chemistry of the active substance (EMA/454576/2016); sufficient 
justification and discussion for the choice of these compounds is provided. The names and addresses of 
the  starting  material  manufacturers/suppliers  are  laid  down  in  the  dossier.  This  also  holds  regarding 
the  synthesis  routes  of  the  starting  materials  applied  by  the  manufacturers/suppliers.  Two  active 
substances manufacturers which use the same route of synthesis are proposed.

Following  an  enhanced  QbD  quality  approach,  the  tezacaftor  active  substance  manufacturing  process 
was  risk  assessed  to  determine  which  process  parameters  had  the  potential  to  have  the  greatest 
impact  on  tezacaftor  CQAs.  On  this  basis  critical  and  non-critical  parameters  have  been  defined  to 
describe  the  manufacturing  process  and  process  controls.  Design  spaces  have  been  established  for 
several process steps, based on Designs of experiments (DoE) studies performed.  
The  DoE  studies  to  support  the  design  spaces  were  based  on  full  factorial  and  fractional  factorial 
designs  with  resolutions  at  mainly  levels  IV,  based  on  the  risk  assessments  as  done  for  Orkambi 
development. The resulting design spaces are considered acceptable.  
Design  space  verification  was  completed  for  each  unit  operation  in  line  with  EMA  “Questions  and 
Answers on Design Space Verification” (EMA/603905/2013). This design space verification and lifecycle 
management were based on a risk assessment of potential scale dependent phenomena for each step 
along  with  the  control  strategy  demonstrated  during  development  studies.    As  a  result,  none  of  the 
design  spaces  were  categorized  as  high  risk  but  as  medium  scale-up  risk.  Thus,  well-established 
chemical  engineering  science  and  scale-up  principles  (e.g.  heat  transfer,  solids  suspension,  liquid 
blending) and correlations were used to examine potentially scale-dependent phenomena and confirm 
that they do not impact process performance, and that the design spaces developed at laboratory scale 
apply to (are verified for) commercial scale.  The consistency of commercial scale batches (15 batches) 
with lab scale predictions provided further support for the design space scale verification conclusions.  
Adequate  in-process  controls  (IPCs)  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  specifications  and  control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The  tezacaftor  active  substance  control  strategy  comprises  the  starting  materials,  reagents  and 
solvents  specifications,  the  active  substance  synthesis  design  spaces,  IPCs  and  active  substance 
specification.  The  impurities's  data  and  justifications  (including  purge  and  fate  studies)  support  the 
control  strategy;  absence  of  carry-over  of  impurities  through  the  synthesis  has  sufficiently  been 
demonstrated and the control strategy is in line with the guidelines (e.g. ICH Q3A, Q3C, M7, Q11).  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on  chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  Potential  and  actual  impurities  were  well  discussed  with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
Detailed information regarding the manufacturing process development of tezacaftor active substance 
has been presented. The proposed commercial manufacturing process uses the same bond making and 
breaking  steps  as  the  initial  process.  Further  development  work  led  to  improvement  of  steps.  The 
changes made during development are considered minor and are not expected to impact on the quality 
of the active substance.  
The active substance is packaged inside a LPDE bag and secured with an appropriate closure (twist tie 
or equivalent). The bag is then placed inside a second LDPE bag and secured appropriately; the closed 
LDPE bags are placed into a secondary container suitable for storage and shipping which complies with 
the  European  Guideline  on  Plastic  Immediate  Packaging  Materials  (CPMP/QWP/4359/03).  The  LDPE 
resin  used  to  manufacture  the  bags  is  suitable  to  be  in  contact  with  food  and  complies  with  the 
requirements  of  Commission  Regulation  (EU)  No  10/2011  and  the  Ph.Eur.  Monograph  3.1.3 
“Polyolefines”. 
Specification 
Tezacaftor specification includes tests and limits for appearance, identification (IR), assay (HPLC), 
organic impurities (HPLC), inorganic impurities: palladium (Ph. Eur.) and residue on ignition/ sulphated 
ash (Ph. Eur.) and, residual solvents (GC). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018

The active substance specification is based on the active substance CQAs. The CQA identified are 
appearance, identification, assay, organic impurities, chiral purity, inorganic impurities, residual 
solvents, palladium and copper. A justification for the absence of control of chiral purity, copper, heavy 
metals, residual trimethylamine, water content, physical form, particle size and microbial count has 
been provided and is considered acceptable. 
Specifically, the absence for a control of chiral purity has been justified on the basis that tezacaftor 
contains a single chiral center, which is a secondary carbinol, its origin and stability. Therefore, the 
control of chiral purity of tezacaftor active substance is established according to ICH Q6A (decision tree 
#5) by applying limits in the relevant starting material as supported by development studies. The carry 
over studies and design spaces studies showed that the stereo-chemical enantiomers, if formed, do not 
carry through the synthesis and that the limit established at starting material level is adequate. This 
justification is acceptable. 
Elemental impurities are controlled in line with ICH Q3D. 
Water content is not a CQA of tezacaftor because the crystalline active substance is non-hygroscopic 
(< 0.2% w/w water uptake up to 80% RH at 25˚C), and water does not affect active substance 
stability or finished product manufacture. 
With regards to active substance polymorphism, physical form has been monitored during all 
development and stability studies. To date, there has been no change in the tezacaftor polymorphic 
form. In addition, the active substance fully dissolves in organic solvents at the beginning of the spray-
drying process. Form A is freely soluble at the maximum solids load in the spray drying solvent system 
(80% dichloromethane / 20% methanol). For this reason, polymorphic form is not a CQA of the 
tezacaftor active substance and it is not included in its specification. 
Likewise, particle size of tezacaftor is not a CQA because the active substance is completely dissolved 
in the spray drying solvent system (80% dichloromethane/ 20% methanol) as the first step of the SDD 
manufacture. 
Tezacaftor has not been shown to be bactericidal or bacteriostatic. However, the active substance 
manufacturing process follows classic chemical synthesis which is hostile to microorganisms. In 
addition, the microbial limits and water activity test results from 3 representative active substance lots 
presented show very low bioburden, absence of specified microorganisms using validated compendial 
microbial limits methods, and water activities less than 0.6 (consistent with the fact that the drug 
substance has low hygroscopicity and indicating the material is not likely to support microbial growth). 
The primary stability showed that water activity levels remain below the threshold for microbial growth 
promotion (0.6), and no change in microbial content after storage for 12 months at 25°C/60% RH in 
the intended container closure system.  These combined data indicate that tezacaftor active substance 
possesses very low risk of microbial contamination and microbial testing of commercial lots is not 
necessary. 
The tests and limits in the specifications are considered appropriate for controlling the quality of this 
active substance. 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
All batch results (including those of the batches used in the clinical studies) are in compliance with the 
proposed specification.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standard used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 21 pilot or commercial scale batches of the active substance used for non-
clinical studies, clinical studies, and formal stability studies, or intended for future clinical or 
commercial use have been provided. The results are within the proposed specifications and consistent 
from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of active substance from one of the proposed 
manufacturers stored in the intended commercial package for up to 18 months under long term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, organic impurities, chiral purity (HPLC), 
water content (KF titration), physical form (XRPD), microbial limits (USP <61> and <62>), specified 
microorganisms (E. coli) and water activity (USP <1112>).  All results met the acceptance criteria for 
the attributes evaluated and no trends were observed. Water activity levels remained below the 
threshold for microbial growth promotion (0.6), and no change in microbial content after storage for 12 
months at 25°C/60% RH in the intended container closure system was observed. The stability data 
show that tezacaftor active substance is stable when packaged in the intended container closure 
system under all storage conditions. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B option 2 was performed on one batch. Samples 
were tested for appearance, assay, organic impurities and chiral purity. The data, showing no changes 
in the fully exposed test sample and the covered control, confirm that tezacaftor active substance is 
photostable and does not require light protective packaging.  
Results on stress studies including heat (80°C), heat/humidity (80°C/75%RH), treatment under acidic 
(0.2N HCl, ambient), basic (0.2N NaOH, ambient), and oxidative (0.02% H2O2, ambient) conditions for 
up to 14 days, and exposure to UV and visible light (solid and solution) were also provide on one 
batch. Tezacaftor was found to be the least stable under the oxidative condition and when exposed to 
light stress conditions in solution. Results from the primary stability studies demonstrate that none of 
the degradation products observed under these stress conditions are found at or above the reporting 
threshold when the active substance is packaged and stored according to label requirements. No 
degradation was observed when tezacaftor was exposed to the other stress conditions listed above.  All 
tezacaftor samples from this study were tested for spectral peak purity. The tezacaftor peak was found 
to be spectrally pure in all stressed samples demonstrating that the commercial HPLC method for 
assay and organic impurities determination of tezacaftor drug substance is stability indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months when stored in 
the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a yellow immediate-release film coated tablet for oral administration. The tablet 
is a FDC of the active ingredients tezacaftor (100 mg) and ivacaftor (150 mg). As indicated above,

both tezacaftor and ivacaftor active substances are provided as SDD intermediates. The applicant 
declared that ivacaftor SDD used in this Symkevi submission is identical to the one used and approved 
for Kalydeco. 
Specifically, ivacaftor active substance was approved in 2012 (Kalydeco Centralised Procedure) and in 
2015 as a FDC tablet (Orkambi Centralised Procedure). It is a stable crystalline material of high purity 
with well characterized physical and chemical properties. While crystalline ivacaftor is chemically and 
physically stable, it practically insoluble in aqueous media and has low bioavailability. Various 
approaches to obtain materials with better aqueous solubility were explored Given the acceptable 
chemical and physical stability of the neat amorphous form (), combined with its significantly improved 
dissolution rate and bioavailability the amorphous form was selected as the most appropriate active 
substance form for development. Theactive substance is spray driedto make an amorphous SDD prior 
to manufacturing the final tablet. As mentioned above, this is the same approach used in the approved 
Kalydeco and Orkambi products.  
Ivacaftor is compatible with the processing solvents and excipients used in the SDD as confirmed by 
stability studies. 
Binary excipient compatibility studies were conducted with development ivacaftor SDD formulations 
mixed with common tableting excipients. These studies were conducted under open dish conditions at 
40°C/75%RH and showed no changes to the physical or chemical stability of ivacaftor with any of the 
excipients tested. In addition, no physical or chemical stability changes have been noted with any 
finished product lot on stability. 
Tezacaftor active substance is the new active substance (NAS) component of the proposed FDC 
tablets. It is provided as a crystalline solid which is practically insoluble in water and buffer solutions 
from pH 1.0 to pH 9.0. The amorphous form of tezacaftor was selected as the most appropriate 
physical form for development due to increased solubility as compared to a crystalline form. The active 
substance is spray dried to produce an amorphous SDD drug product intermediate. Tezacaftor SDD is 
packaged inside a LDPE bag/liner which is placed inside a second LDPE bag/liner. The closed LDPE 
bag/liners are then sealed in a foil laminated bag with desiccant. 
The tablet core excipients are hypromellose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) (physical stabilizer), sodium 
lauryl sulfate (E487) (wetting agent), purified water, hypromellose (HPMC) (E464) (physical stabilizer), 
microcrystalline cellulose (E460(i)) (filler), croscarmellose sodium (E468) (disintegrant) and 
magnesium stearate (E470b) (lubricant). The tablet film coat excipients are hypromellose (E464), 
hydroxypropyl cellulose (E463), titanium dioxide (E171) talc (E553b) and iron oxide yellow (E172). 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included 
in section 6.1 of the SmPC. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality 
is compliant with Ph. Eur standards, except iron oxide yellow which complies with EU Regulation 
231/2012. The specifications of the excipients were carefully discussed and justified in view of the 
continuous manufacturing process of the tablets involving PAT methods. In this regard, a risk 
assessment was performed to determine the potential for excipients to impact the CQA of the product 
in the context of the specific manufacturing process for the tablets. The risk was determined to be low 
for all excipients used in the formulation. As a result, the Ph. Eur. specifications were deemed 
sufficient, with except for one of the excipients, where an additional test was added to further 
characterize the material properties. Furthermore, multiple lots of each excipient have been used 
throughout development and clinical manufacture with no impact observed on the processability or 
product quality due to lot-to-lot variation. In addition, the design and operation of the loss in weight 
(LIW) feeders ensures that they can correct for any minor material variability. In addition, it was

confirmed that the PAT chemometric models were calibrated across the design spaces using multiple 
lots of excipients. The models were shown to be robust against normal excipient lot to lot variability. 
Studies were conducted to examine the chemical and physical compatibility of the tezacaftor SDD and 
ivacaftor SDD with the tablet excipients as well as with each other. Open dish stability of 800 mg/g 
tezacaftor SDD over 6 months at 40ºC / 75% RH showed no chemical or physical incompatibility. The 
potential of the interactions between tezacaftor and HPMCAS and the crystalisation of tezacaftor in the 
presence of sodium lauryl sulfate (both components present in ivacaftor SDD) in the FDC tablet 
product was also addressed. 
Tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets (commercial formulation) were stationed on an open dish stability 
study at 40ºC / 75% RH for 12 months. The results demonstrate the chemical and physical 
compatibility of all components of the FDC tablet. 
The tablets are easily distinguishable from the Kalydeco and Orkambi tablets, since they have different 
colour.  
The composition of the product proposed for marketing is the same as the pivotal (phase III) clinical 
formulation. An overview of tezacaftor and ivacaftor formulations used in clinical development has 
been provided. Formulations included an oral solution (used in 2 studies) and tablets (used in all other 
studies), either as separate tezacaftor and ivacaftor tablets and/or tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets.  
Manufacturing  process  of  the  early  phase  III  clinical  studies  was  a  traditional  manufacturing  process 
with the same process steps as the proposed continuous manufacturing (CM) process; the later phase 
III  batches  were  manufactured  according  to  the  CM  process.  The  pivotal  clinical  batch  results 
(regardless the traditional or CM process used) showed comparable batch results. 
As part of the pharmaceutical development, the dissolution profiles of the FDC tablet were compared to 
those obtained with the individual tablets used in Phase 1 and 2 studies. They were found to be similar 
and  therefore  were  expected  to  provide  comparable  exposure  and  pharmacokinetics  to  the  individual 
tablets. Based on this dissolution data as well as the Phase 2 results, the 100 mg tezacaftor/ 150 mg 
ivacaftor  FDC  tablet  was  selected  for  Phase  3  studies.  Pharmacokinetic  (PK)  results  from the  100  mg 
tezacaftor/150 mg ivacaftor FDC tablet in Study 006 and the individual tezacaftor and ivacaftor tablets 
dosed in Studies 101 and 103 suggested that the FDC tablet provides comparable exposure and PK as 
the individual tablets. 
The  product  and  manufacturing  process  development  were  conducted  following  an  enhanced  QbD 
approach in line with ICH Q8.  An adequate quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as basis 
for  the  development  in  line  with  the  finished  product  properties  and  its  use  and  relevant  CQAs  were 
identified and derived thereof. 
Specifically,  the  QTPP  was  to  develop  an  immediate  release  fixed-dose  combination  tablet  of  100mg 
tezacaftor/150mg ivacaftor for oral administration which is bioavailable, safe and efficacious and has a 
24 month shelf life at room temperature packaged in blister 
The  identified  potential  tezacaftor  finished  product  intermediate  (SDD)  CQAs  were:  appearance, 
identification,  assay,  degradation  products,  particle  size,  bulk  density,  residual  solvents  and  physical 
form. An initial risk assessment was conducted to determine the likelihood that variability in materials 
and process steps could have an impact on one or more potential CQAs of the SDD. This was followed 
by  a  multivariate  DOE  designed  to  evaluate  process  parameters  that  could  have  an  impact  on  SDD 
CQAs.  Based  on  the  results  from  these  studies  the  design  spaces  and  in  –process  control  for  the 
process were established.

The  CQAs  for  ivacaftor  SDD  were  previously  established  and  assessed  as  part  of  Kalydeco  Marketing 
Application (EMEA/H/C/002494). 
With  regards  to  the  FDC  tablets,  potential  CQAs  for  the  tezacaftor  active  substance,  tezacaftor  SDD, 
ivacaftor  SDD  and  the  tezacaftor/ivacaftor  FDC  tablet  were  identified.  An  initial  risk  assessment  was 
performed on the tezacaftor active substance, SDD, and FDC tablet to determine which materials and 
process steps could potentially impact the CQAs. 
Both active spray dried dispersions were assessed as having the potential to impact some CQAs. The 
ivacaftor  SDD  physical  properties  are  well  understood  due  to  its  longer  development  and  commercial 
history and thus it was assessed as having a low risk. 
Risk assessment and prior knowledge were used to design multivariate experiments that evaluate main 
effects  and  interactions.    These  experiments  considered  the  desired  manufacturing  range  (DMR)  as 
well  as  incoming  material  specifications  and  equipment  capability.    Any  differences  in  scale  or 
equipment  between  the  experiments  conducted  and  the  commercial  equipment  were  considered 
(scale-up  and  engineering  risk  assessment)  to  ensure  results  are  representative  of  the  commercial 
process  and  are  documented  as  appropriate.  Initial  screening  designs  were  performed  in  a 
discontinuous  manner  as  specific  unit-operation  to  identify  material  attributes,  dry  granulation 
processing parameters and coating process parameters that may impact finished product CQAs prior to 
conducting  integrated  continuous  QbD  experiments  on  the  continuous  manufacturing  DLR.  Data  from 
QbD  studies  were  analyzed  to  define  the  design  spaces  that  ensures  all  CQAs  are  within  acceptance 
limits,  and  process  models  which  describe  them.  Robustness  of  the  design  spaces  limits  and  the 
models were demonstrated with the pivotal clinical batches, which were commercial scale. The validity 
of all the design spaces at the same time was confirmed.  
The  process  knowledge  gained  throughout  QbD  development  formed  the  basis  of  the  overall  product 
control  strategies  for  active  substance  and  finished  product.  The  control  strategy  includes  control  of 
input material attributes, automated feedback loops to drive each unit operation towards its target set 
point,  monitoring  of  design  spaces  parameters  throughout  manufacturing  to  ensure  product  is 
manufactured  within  the  design  spaces,  IPC  and  finished  product  specifications.  This  ensures  that  a 
quality product will be consistently produced. 
The  commercial  manufacture  of  the  tezacaftor/ivacaftor  FDC  tablets  uses  a CM  process,  starting  with 
the introduction of individual components and ending with film coated tablets, combined with real time 
release  testing  (RTRT).  The  equipment  is  equipped  with  both  spectroscopic  and  non-spectroscopic 
process analytical technology (PAT) which are used for in-process control (IPC) and/or RTRT.  The CM 
system  uses  gravity  feed  for  material  transfer  between  unit  processes.  Additionally,  a  dilute  phase 
pneumatic  conveying  system  is  also  used  to  transfer  granules  and  a  bucket  lift  (TRU)  conveying 
system  to  move  core  tablets.  LIW  feeders  are  used  when  accurate  material  dosing  is  required.  The 
desired quantity of each component is fed into in
line blender 1. 
The  individual  components  in  blender  1  are  mixed  and  conveyed  using  an  auger  system  (convective 
‐
mixing)  and  the  output  blend  is  then  fed  to  the  roller  compactor.  The  intragranular  (IG)  blend  is  dry 
granulated  using  a  roller  compactor  and  the  resulting  ribbons  are  milled  into  granules.  The  granules 
are conveyed via pneumatic transfer to the granule conditioning unit (GCU) for further milling. The first 
segregation point for removal of non-conforming material is after the GCU. 
Extragranular  (EG)  excipients  are  then  added  using a  second  set of  LIW  feeders  (feeder bank  2)  and 
these components are fed into in
line blender 2.

The  final  blend  is  transferred  by  gravity  to  the  rotary  tablet  press  for  compression,  and  the  resulting 
tablets are mechanically transferred to a deduster/metal checker followed by the tablet relaxation unit 
(TRU). 
From  the  TRU  the  tablets  are  conveyed  to  the  tablet  coaters  (perforated  pan  coating  system)  for 
application  of  a  non-functional  film  coat.  The  continuous  coater  incorporated  in  the  DLR  system  is  a 
sub-batch coater. To accommodate the desired range of line rates of the DLR, two identical continuous 
film coaters are incorporated in the system, running in parallel. 
The  second  segregation  point  for  non-conforming  material is  at  the  TRU.  The  final  coated  tablets  are 
discharged out of the coaters into intermediate containers. 
Start-up  and  shut  down  processes  have  been  described  and  justified.  The  residence  time  distribution 
(RTD) was assessed and used to develop the segregation strategy of material identified for waste. 
Hold times have been studied experimentally and documented at the commercial scale for sieved SDDs 
and excipients as well as the coating suspension used for manufacture of this product. Based on this 
study the holding times with no impact to process capability or product quality were defined. These 
holding times are therefore acceptable. 
The  IPC  for  tezacaftor/ivacaftor  FDC  tablets  manufacture  have  been  justified.  Adequate  acceptance 
criteria and sampling plans have been defined. 
Specifically, mass flow for the components of the FDC tablet is determined gravimetrically by the 
LIW feeders. SDD IG blend potency is calculated based on the gravimetric dosing of the IG blend 
components by the LIW feeders (Feeder Bank 1, Feeders 1-4). 
Two methods for assessing final blend potency have been established: (1) measurement of 
tezacaftor and ivacaftor final blend potency by NIR and (2) calculation of tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
final blend potency using granule potency determined by NIR and feeder mass flow data for the final 
blend components (Feeder Bank 2, Feeders 5-7).  The intention is to manufacture with both methods 
active to ensure continuous monitoring of the process when the NIR systems are unavailable (e.g. 
undergoing on-going performance verification). However, only one result from either of the two 
methods is required to satisfy the minimum IPC sampling plan for manufacture. The methods have 
been fully validated per ICH Q2 (R1). 
Core tablet weight, thickness and hardness are measured on a tablet tester installed at the  tablet 
press. 
The capability of the RTRT methods to properly characterize the relevant CQA has been demonstrated 
by the comparison of the results obtained with the RTRT and the regulatory method. 
A  post-approval  change  management  protocol  (PACMP)  relating  to  the  management  of  changes  to 
models  employed  for  IPC  and  RTRT  for  the  FDC  tablets  has  been  submitted.  It  defines  the  model 
change  and  associated  validation  testing,  acceptance  criteria,  and  regulatory  reporting  strategy 
required for each model. 
Two  independent  in  vitro dissolution  methods  were developed  for testing  100 mg  tezacaftor/  150  mg 
ivacaftor  FDC  tablets,  one  for  each  active  ingredient.  Both  dissolution  methods  have  shown 
discriminating  ability  against  meaningful  manufacturing  variations  and  tablet  properties,  and  are 
considered suitable for their intended use as the primary release and stability quality control methods 
for tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets.

Bulk  tezacaftor/ivacaftor  FDC  tablets  are  packaged  in  double  low-density  polyethylene  (LDPE)  bags 
inside  a  heat-sealed  foil  laminated  bag.  The  material  complies  with  Commission  Regulation  (EU)  No 
10/2011. 
The  container  closure  system  for  tezacaftor/ivacaftor  fixed  dosed  combination  (FDC)  tablets  is  a 
thermoform blister consisting of clear Aclar (PCTFE – polychlorotrifluoroethylene) film laminated to PVC 
(polyvinyl chloride) film and sealed with a blister foil lidding. The aclar/foil blister configuration will be 
placed  into  an  appropriate  secondary  container.  A  declaration  of  compliance  of  the  material  with 
guidelines on Plastic materials, Commission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 and/or the relevant European 
Pharmacopoeia monograph has been provided. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The preparation of the ivacaftor SDD consists of three steps: mixture preparation, spray drying and 
secondary drying. This is the same registered for Kalydeco and Orkambi.  
A PACMP to manage specific design spaces changes for the tezacaftor SDD spray-drying step resulting 
from equipment and/or site changes or modifications has been submitted. The protocol defines the 
experiments, testing, acceptance criteria, and regulatory reporting strategy based on the specific 
proposed change. 
As indicated above, the tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets are manufactured using a CM process 
including the feeding and intra-granular (IG) blending of actives and IG excipients, dry granulation and 
milling, extra-granular (EG) blending of granules and EG excipients, compression and film coating.  
The design space limits and IPCs have been justified (see pharmaceutical development section). 
The analysis results for 10 batches of tezacaftor SDD used in clinical studies have been presented. All 
results met the specifications. All batches of tezacaftor SDD met the specifications 
Process validation results for intragranular blend uniformity, blend uniformity by dosage form assay, 
and dissolution of tablets from the beginning, middle and end of a run have been provided. 
A  continuous  process  verification  (CPV)  approach  to  validation  has  been  implemented  for  the 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor  FDC  product.  A  process  validation  scheme  has  been  submitted.  At  the  time  of 
opinion,  the  DLR  has  been  used  for  process  development  activities  and  for  manufacture  of  5  clinical 
finished product batches, and will also be used for commercial manufacture. The clinical batches were 
manufactured  using  the  same  equipment,  using  similar  line  rates,  and  with  the  same  sampling 
locations  as  will  be  used  for  commercial  manufacture.  Process  performance  understanding  is  further 
supported by conducting development (QbD) experiments on the same continuous manufacturing line 
(DLR),  and  using  multivariate  analysis  to link  process  parameters to  product  CQAs  and  define  design 
spaces within which product quality is assured.  
Process parameter and IPC data is collected and reported continuously throughout manufacture, both 
for  the  purpose  of  process  monitoring  and  control  and  as  inputs  to  calculations  for  batch  release  via 
RTRT. Process capability has been demonstrated via analysis of IPC variability, which has informed the 
sampling  plan  and  frequency  as  well  as  through  analysis  of  process  parameter  variability,  which  has 
demonstrated the ability of the process to operate within design spaces limits. Furthermore, there is a 
thorough  understanding  of  product  quality  during  start-up  and  shutdown,  as  well  as  before  and  after 
pauses. The RTD on the DLR has been characterized, and procedures are in place to allow segregation 
of all potentially impacted material.

Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance,  identification (IR/RTRT),  assay  (HPLC/RTRT),  degradation  products  (HPLC),  uniformity  of 
dosage  units  (HPLC/RTRT),  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur./RTRT),  water  content  (KF/RTRT),  physical  form 
(XRPD/RTRT), and microbial purity (TAMC, TYMC, E. coli) (Ph. Eur.).  
A  RTRT  strategy  with  a  contingency  plan  specifying  the  use  of  alternative  testing  or  monitoring 
approaches  on  a  temporary  basis  in  case  of  RTR  equipment  failure  has  been  defined.  Satisfactory 
comparative testing between the RTRT and the Regulatory methods was conducted for the first three 
commercial  batches  to  be  marketed.  A  post-approval  program  for  parallel  testing  has  been  provided 
and 
justified.  This 
is 
in 
line  with 
the  Guideline  on  Real  Time  Release  Testing 
(EMA/CHMP/QWP/811210/2009-Rev1).  
Chemometric models have been developed in line with the FDA Guidance for Industry: Analytical 
Procedures and Methods Validation for Drugs and Biologics, 2015 and the CHMP guideline on the use of 
Near Infrared Spectroscopy (EMEA/CHMP/DVMP/QWP/17760 2009 Rev2). The models were developed 
using the DLR instrumentation and lab instrumentation equivalent to the DLR systems.  Samples 
encompassing anticipated process variability (process design spaces) and physical, chemical, and 
compositional material variability were used to calibrate the chemometric models and ensure specificity 
and robustness.  Analytical method descriptions summarizing the PAT data acquisition parameters and 
the chemometric models have been provided.  
The PAT tools used for RTRT have been described. 
The PAT 3 station is sited after the dry granulation step and before the addition of extragranular 
excipients, and production of the final blend. It consists of two in-line instruments: a laser diffraction 
unit for determining granule particle size, an attribute used in the chemometric dissolution model 
required for RTRT; and an in-line NIR sensor for assay of the two active substances in the granule. The 
results taken together with the data from the LIW feeders of the extragranular excipients are used to 
predict, as an IPC the potency of the two actives in the final blend. 
The PAT 4 station is sited before tablet compression and consists of an in-line NIR sensor for assay of 
the two active substances and water content of the final blend. 
The PAT 5 station is sited following tablet compression and consists of two at-line instruments: Raman 
spectroscopy sensor for determining the polymorphic form of the two active substances, and 
identification of the two active substances in the drug product; and the Kraemer Tablet Testing system 
to measure the tablet core weight, thickness and hardness. 
A partial least squares model to predict tezacaftor dissolution rate for each segment (about 1/12) of 
the CM batch was developed. The model has the following inputs: 
• 
• 
• 
average tezacaftor content and average ivacaftor content in final blend is obtained from the 
PAT 4 NIR chemometric models. 
average segment granule volume weighted particle size distribution obtained from the PAT 3 
Laser Diffraction system 
the segment tezacaftor SDD and ivacaftor SDD feed factors (i.e. the line feed rate in kg/hr) are 
obtained from the loss in weight feeders 2 and 1 respectively located in Feeder Bank 1.

• 
the segment average core tablet weight, thickness, and hardness obtained from the PAT 5 
Kraemer Tablet Testing system. 
The model was developed using multiple dissolution samples obtained from manufacturing runs 
spanning the process design spaces and desired manufacturing range. The samples used for calibration 
were prepared with various drug substance, spray dried dispersion and excipient lots.  
The same approach was taken to develop a RTRT dissolution model for ivacaftor. 
The RTRT dissolution methods were verified during a clinical campaign on the DLR according to an 
approved protocol. Verification of the methods was performed by comparing the RTRT dissolution 
results with the results obtained by the regulatory dissolution methods for the determination of 
tezacaftor and ivacaftor. The results obtained met the acceptance criteria as defined in the approved 
protocol, confirming that the method is suitable for its intended use. 
PAT 4 NIR final blend potencies for tezacaftor and ivacaftor together with PAT 5 core tablet weight are 
used to determine the tezacaftor and ivacaftor batch content uniformity. The batch average tezacaftor 
content, the variance in tezacaftor content, the batch average ivacaftor content, and the variance in 
ivacaftor content in final blend along with the batch average core tablet weight and variance in core 
tablet weight are subsequently used to calculate the batch content uniformity for tezacaftor and 
ivacaftor.  
A protocol describing model maintenance strategy has been presented. 
Analytical methods have been adequately described and validated in line with ICH Q2 (R1), when 
applicable. 
Comparative RTRT and end product regulatory batch data are reported for 22 QbD runs and three 
confirmatory QbD runs (parallel testing). This included data from the four clinical batches (two small 
scale, and two batches are or near commercial scale) which were shown to be comparable and 
compliant with the proposed specification. This data shows that the manufacturing process can 
manufacture consistently and that the both the RTRT and end product testing data are comparable. 
Degradation products are addressed only in the stability specification, and not at batch release. This is 
accepted because the starting materials are satisfactorily controlled and data from the primary and 
supportive stability lots showed no degradation products at or above the reporting threshold (0.10%) 
at all test points under all storage conditions.  
A justification to only perform microbial limits testing on commercial stability lots of 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets has been presented. Data from 7 batches of FDC tablets showing very 
low bioburden and absence of specified microorganisms using validated compendial microbial limits 
methods were provided. Water activity testing was performed for 4 of these lots, and showed water 
activities less than 0.6 (indicating the material is not likely to support microbial growth). In addition, 6 
lots of tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets placed on stability showed no change in microbial content after 
storage for 12 months at 30°C/75% RH in the intended container closure system. Water activity was 
tested for 3 of the stability lots, and the results remained below the threshold for microbial growth 
promotion (0.6) after storage for 12 months at 30°C/75% RH in the intended container closure 
system. Data available confirm that the tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets have very low risk of microbial 
contamination. However, to verify that the risk remains low, the applicant will perform microbial limits 
testing on commercial stability lots of packaged tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets to confirm the results

comply with USP <1111>. This approach is accepted because water is not used during the 
manufacturing process and water content is controlled in the active substance SDDs and excipients. 
A justification for the omission of chiral purity, residual solvents, elemental impurities and water from 
the specification was also provided. 
The control of chiral purity of tezacaftor active substance is established according to ICH Q6A (decision 
tree #5) by applying limits to in the starting material.  It has been demonstrated that under the 
conditions used for the preparation of tezacaftor SDD and tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets, there is no 
opportunity to directly epimerize the tezacaftor secondary carbinol chiral center. In addition, there has 
been no change on stability in chiral purity within method variability. Therefore, chiral purity will be 
controlled only in starting material. 
The levels of residual solvents in tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets are controlled via ICH Q3C (R6) 
option 1 limits for residual solvents used in the manufacturing of the tezacaftor and ivacaftor active 
substances and SDD. All SDD and tablet excipients also meet ICH Q3C (R6) Option 1 limits for residual 
solvents. These controls ensure the total potential residual solvent content of tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC 
tablets comply with the ICH Q3C (R6) requirements. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablet was assessed 
according to the ICH Q3D using a risk based approach and taking into account the dosing regimen 
including a 150 mg Kalydeco tablet. It demonstrated that all Class 1 and Class 2A elemental impurities 
in the tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets will be consistently below 30% of the established PDEs. The risk 
assessment also demonstrates that elemental impurities intentionally added in the ivacaftor and 
tezacaftor drug substances manufacturing processes are controlled to appropriate levels in the drug 
product. Therefore, no additional controls on elemental impurities in the drug product are required. 
A justification to omit water content from the shelf-life specification was also provided. Water is not a 
CQA for the tablets, but microbial count, the only CQA that could be impacted by water, will be tested 
directly. In addition, dissolution will also be monitored. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 5 clinical batches manufactured by a discontinuous process and 
five clinical CM batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life and storage condition for the ivacaftor SDD is 24 months when stored in the 
intended container closure system. This is the same approved for Kalydeco and Orkambi and the same 
data has been submitted in Symkevi dossier. 
The proposed shelf life for tezacaftor SSD is 36 months when stored in the intended container closure 
system at not more than 30°C. The shelf-life and storage condition are supported by 24 months of 
formal long-term at 25°C / 60% RH and 6 month at 40°C / 75% RH stability data from three primary 
pilot and commercial scale batches. Samples were tested for appearance, assay and degradation 
products, chiral purity (HPLC), water content, physical form, microbial count and specified 
microorganisms and water activity. All results met the acceptance criteria for the attributes evaluated.

Photostability of tezacaftor SDD was evaluated per ICH Q1B Option 2 on one batch. Samples were 
tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, physical form and chiral purity (HPLC). The data, 
showing no changes in the fully exposed test sample and the covered control, confirm that tezacaftor 
SDD does not require light protective packaging. 
The data presented support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions for tezacaftor SDD. 
The stability of Symkevi bulk tablets was evaluated. Stability data from one batch of FDC tablets stored  
in the proposed bulk bag during 12 months at  25°C ± 2°C/60% RH ± 5% RH and 6 months 40°C ± 
2°C/75% RH ± 5% RH was provided. The same parameters as in the formal stability studies of the 
FDC tablets (see paragraph below) were studied. No significant changes were observed. Therefore the 
proposed holding time of 12 months in the bulk bag is acceptable. 
Additionally, stability data on the product has been provided on six production scale (clinical) batches 
prepared using a batch (discontinuous) manufacturing process and stored for up to 18 months at 
25°C/60% RH and 30°C/75% and for 6 months at 40°C/75% RH, in line with ICH requirements. The 
batches were stored in the proposed blister. Additional supportive stability data from three batches 
prepared using a CM process and stored for 12 months under long term conditions and 6 months under 
accelerated conditions were also provided. Samples were tested for appearance, assay (ivacaftor, 
tezacaftor), degradation products (ivacaftor, tezacaftor), tezacaftor chiral purity, dissolution (ivacaftor, 
tezacaftor), water content and physical form. Samples stored at 30°C/75%  were also tested for 
microbiology (TAMC, TYMC, E. coli) and water activity. The analytical procedures used were stability 
indicating. 
Stability data showed no trends under all storage conditions for appearance, assay of active 
substances, degradation products, chiral purity. The X-ray powder diffraction data showed absence of 
crystalline tezacaftor and absence of crystalline ivacaftor at all test points under all storage conditions. 
With respect to tezacaftor dissolution, no trends were seen at 25°C/60%RH, a very slight negative 
trend at 30°C/75%RH and 40°C/60%RH. With respect to ivacaftor dissolution, no trends were seen at 
all storage conditions. A slight increase in water content was seen under all storage conditions, but all 
results remained well within the commercial specification acceptance limits.  
Photostability as ICH Q1B Option 2 was studied on one batch. Samples were tested for appearance, 
assay, degradation and chiral purity. The data, showing no changes in the fully exposed test sample 
and the covered control, confirmed that tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets do not require light protective 
packaging. 
Symkevi tablets were subjected to stress conditions, which included heat, heat/humidity, treatment 
under acidic, basic, and oxidative conditions for up to 14 days, and exposure to UV and visible light. 
The tablets were found to be the least stable under base, oxidative, and in solution exposed to light 
stress conditions. No significant degradation was observed under all the other stress. The tezacaftor 
and ivacaftor peaks were found to be spectrally pure in all stressed samples demonstrating that the 
commercial HPLC method for assay and degradation products determination of tezacaftor/ivacaftor 
FDC tablets is stability indicating. 
To support the independent shelf-life of the FDC tablet from the SDD, an end-to-end stability study 
was executed to evaluate the impact of aged ivacaftor and tezacaftor SDDs on the physical and 
chemical stability of the tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablet. The end-to-end study involved aging 
representative lots of ivacaftor and tezacaftor SDDs packaged in the commercial packaging 
configuration for 6 months at 40°C/75%RH (“accelerated aging”). The aged SDDs were subsequently 
used to prepare tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets, which were packaged in the commercial packaging 
and placed on stability. During this end-to-end stability study, there were no significant changes in any

of the tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets CQA’s tested on stability through 18 months at 25°C/60%RH 
and 30°C/75%RH, and 6 months at 40°C/75%RH. Results from this end-to-end stability study 
established that the shelf-lives of the SDDs and the FDC tablet are independent, and that tezacaftor 
and ivacaftor SDDs can be used to manufacture FDC tablets at any point in their shelf life with no 
impact on the physical or chemical stability of the tablets.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 30 months as stated in the SmPC (section 
6.3) is acceptable.

No material from animal origin is used in the production of the product. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substances and finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substances and finished 
product and their manufacturing processes. Design spaces have been proposed for several steps in the 
manufacture of the active substances and finished product. The design spaces have been adequately 
verified. 
The manufacture of the FDC tablets uses a continuous dry granulation process starting with the 
introduction of individual components and ending with film coated tablets.  
Following this QbD approach, a real time release testing strategy has been proposed.  
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.1.  Introduction 
Tezacaftor (VX-661) is developed as a CFTR corrector, improving the processing of CFTR in the 
endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus as well as the trafficking of the protein to the 
membrane. Ivacaftor, already on the market, was shown to be a CFTR potentiator, increasing the 
chloride transport by the protein present on the membrane. The development of tezacaftor was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 31/165 
 
 
 
 
 
supported by safety pharmacology studies conducted in accordance with ICH S7A and S7B guidelines 
and a toxicology program conducted in accordance with ICH M3(R2) and other relevant ICH guidelines 
in addition to recommendations stemming from discussions with Regulatory Authorities throughout 
development. All safety pharmacology, toxicity, and toxicokinetic studies considered pivotal to safety 
assessment were conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations with any 
exceptions duly noted and were conducted in Association for Assessment and Accreditation of 
Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) accredited facilities. 
The pharmacological profile of TEZ alone and in combination with IVA was characterized in 
electrophysiological and molecular biological studies using primary cultures of human bronchial 
epithelial (HBE) cells derived from homozygous F508del CF donors (F508del/F508del-HBE) and Fisher 
rat thyroid (FRT) cells individually expressing normal CFTR, F508del-CFTR, or 31 mutant CFTR forms 
with defects in the amount and/or function of CFTR. In vitro assays performed using cultured HBE and 
FRT cell monolayers have been used to characterize other CFTR modulators that have demonstrated 
clinical benefit in people  with CF, including IVA, and thus have precedent as non-clinical models to 
predict the potential for clinical benefit of CFTR modulation in people with CF. No in vivo pharmacology 
studies were conducted with TEZ either alone or in combination with IVA because pharmacologically 
validated CF animal models have not been established. Secondary pharmacodynamics (PD) studies 
were conducted to determine TEZ’s spectrum of activity towards two closely related misfolded mutant 
proteins (HERG and Pgp) and to evaluate the potential for pharmacologically-mediated, off-target 
effects. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In an in vitro competition assay it was shown that tezacaftor indeed binds to the first membrane 
spanning domain (MSD1, aa 1-437) of CFTR. In addition, it was shown that tezacaftor selectively 
corrects CFTR as tezacaftor does not correct processing and trafficking of two other mutated and 
misfolded proteins from the ABC superfamily, G601S-hERG and G268V-PgP.  
Due to the lack of an animal model system, in vivo non-clinical efficacy studies to show the activity 
potential of tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor were not conducted. Instead, two in vitro model systems were 
used, which is agreed. 1) Primary human bronchial epithelial cells, isolated form CF (double F508del) 
and non-CF lung explants. Efficacy of tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor in improving processing & trafficking 
and chloride transport of F508del CFTR was studied 2) FRT cells without background CFTR  transfected 
with a (mutated) CFTR gene, using a single Flp-InTM genomic site. Efficacy of the tezacaftor and/or 
ivacaftor in improving processing & trafficking and chloride transport of each single CFTR was studied.

In vitro HBE model system  
Tezacaftor was able to ‘transform’ a portion of the majority of immature F508del CFTR mutant to the 
‘mature’ situation as recognized by an increase in molecular weight detectable on protein level on 
western blot. The ratio of mature/total was related to the amount of the ratio mature/total levels 
wildtype CFTR levels. The increase in the amount of mature CFTR also resulted in increased chloride 
transport. The increase in the ratio mature/total CFTR (from 20 to ~45% of normal CFTR) was not 
equally translated into an increase in chloride transport (from 2% to 8% of normal CFTR, see also 
section 2.1.4). This suggests that tezacaftor increased the amount of F508del, now correctly edited 
with oligosaccharides, on the membrane, but did not alter the chloride transport functionality of the 
mutated CFTR. Ivacaftor may be required to make the F508del CFTR, now present on the membrane, 
more capable to transport chloride. 
Indeed, tezacaftor and ivacaftor both slightly increased the chloride transport by F508del CFTR but the 
combination of the two was more successful in increasing chloride transport than the sum of the effect 
of the two compounds separately in HBE cells. The height of the airway surface liquid and the ciliary 
beat frequency, two other functional parameters to demonstrate efficacy were also statistically 
significantly improved. The potency (EC50) of tezacaftor in combination with maximally effective 
concentration of ivacaftor is 0.6 µM and the potency of ivacaftor in the presence of a maximally 
effective concentration of tezacaftor is 0.006 µM. Addition of 20% human serum, mimicking human 
situation, shifted the EC50 for tezacaftor (in presence of ivacaftor) from 0.6 µM to 3 µM, and for 
ivacaftor (in presence of tezacaftor) was shifted from 0.006 µM to 0.013 µM. In addition to the shift in 
potency, efficacy (magnitude of response) of the combination of TEZ and IVA was improved.  
In vitro FRT model system: Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor 
The FRT system was used to analyse the effect of Tezacaftor and/or Izacaftor on processing and 
trafficking and chloride transport of normal CFTR, F508del-CFTR, a number of Residual Function (RF) 
mutants, splice mutants and a set of Kalydeco responsive gating mutants.  
Tezacaftor is a CFTR corrector increasing the amount of CFTR channels on the cell surface. Ivacaftor a 
CFTR potentiator, increasing the chloride transport. The combined incubation of both drug substances 
in vitro, leads to an even higher increase in chloride transport. In vitro studies showed that the 
combination of tezacaftor/ivacaftor is more efficacious then the two drugs separately in increase of 
chloride transport for the F508del mutant, the RF mutants: E56K, P67L, R74W, D110E, D110H, R117C, 
E193K, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, S945L, S977F, F1052V, K1060T, A1067T, R1070W, F1074L, 
D1152H, and D1270N, the Kalydeco responsive gating mutants: G178R, S549N, S549R, G551D, 
G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, G1349D and R117H. In vitro the efficacy the tezacaftor/ivacaftor 
combination for the splice mutants 711+3A->G, 2789+5G->A, 3272-26A->G, or 3849+10kbC->T and 
E381X was not investigated, but the tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination appeared to be effective for most 
of these mutants in the clinical study (108).  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro off-target evaluation 
Tezacaftor and ivacaftor were evaluated for potential off-target effects in a panel of 168 in vitro 
receptor, channel, and enzyme radioligand binding assays. Tezacaftor showed only significant binding 
affinity to the sodium channel Site 2 target receptor at concentrations below 10 μM (Ki = 6.6 μM). 
However, in a functional assay no significant binding to any of the NaV channels; NaV1.1, NaV1.3, 
NaV1.5, NaV1.7, and NaV1.8, could be determined. Based on Studies 106 and 107, a tezacaftor Cmax 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 33/165 
 
 
 
 
 
of 6 mg/l is obtained under steady-state conditions when given 100 mg OD to CF patients. With >99% 
protein bound, the free tezacaftor Cmax is 0.06 mg/ml, which equals to 0.11 µM. Thus, no secondary 
pharmacology effects of tezacaftor are anticipated in human. Ivacaftor appeared to stimulate the 
monoamine transporter and the serotonin receptor (5-HT2C) at sub-micromolar potency. Since 
ivacaftor has a low potency to cross the blood-brain-barrier, interaction with these targets was 
considered unlikely upon treatment of patients. Based on Studies 106 and 107, the ivacaftor Cmax of 
1.20 mg/l is obtained under steady-state conditions when given 150 mg OD. With >99% protein 
bound, the free ivacaftor Cmax is 0.012 mg/ml, which equals 0.03 µM. Thus, no secondary 
pharmacology effects of Ivacaftor are anticipated in human.  
Pharmacological activity of metabolites 
Three tezacaftor metabolites are substantially present in human, M1, M2, and M5. In plasma, 
tezacaftor and its major circulating metabolites M1- tezacaftor, M2- tezacaftor and M5- tezacaftor 
accounted for 7%, 15%, 31% and 33% of AUC values of the total radioactivity, respectively. M3-TEZ 
accounted for 7% of the total radioactivity AUC. Of these, only M1-tezacaftor appears 
pharmacologically active. The potency of M1- tezacaftor and tezacaftor in the presence of continuous 
ivacaftor in Cultured F/F- (F508del) HBE Cells were similar with EC50 values of 3.24 µM for M1-TEZ and 
5.95 µM for TEZ. 
Two ivacaftor metabolites are substantially present in human, M1 and M6. In plasma, ivacaftor and its 
major circulating metabolites M1- ivacaftor and M6- ivacaftor accounted for 12%, 66% and 21% of 
AUCinf. Of these M1-ivacaftor was pharmacologically active with a 6-fold lower potency than ivacaftor. 
Mean EC50 value was 1.2 µM for M1-IVA and 0.2 µM for IVA.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
In vitro cardiac current channel testing 
Tezacaftor (IC50 > 10 μM) and M2-Tezacaftor (IC50 > 200 μM) are not considered potent hERG 
inhibitors and as the clinical free fraction of tezacaftor is 0.11 µM, the hERG channel inhibition by 
tezacaftor is not regarded clinical relevant.  
Ivacaftor inhibited hERG channel (IC15 of 5.5 μM), Cav1.2 (IC50 of 1.3 μM) and Kv1.5 (IC50 of3.4 μM). 
M6-ivacaftor (10 µM) showed only minimal inhibition of thCAv1.2, hKvLQT1/minK, and hNav1.5 (in CHO 
cells) or hERG and hKir2.1. As the unbound/ free fraction of ivacaftor in human serum is 0.03 µM, the 
inhibition of hERG and other channels influencing cardiac currents, is not regarded as clinical relevant.  
In vivo safety pharmacology 
Tezacaftor had no effect on CNS or respiratory function in Sprague Dawley rats dosed 0, 20, 60 or 200 
mg/kg. Cardiovascular examination revealed increased ABP (17 to 25%) and decreased QT and QTc 
intervals (2 to 8%) between 6 to 14 hours after oral administration in 2/4 dogs dosed 250 mg/kg. 
Since in human, QTc effects were not noted, this observation is not regarded clinical relevant.  Fasted 
Sprague Dawley Rats administered 100 or 200 mg/kg tezacaftor once daily by oral gavage for 4 days, 
showed significantly delayed gastric emptying of the charcoal test meal, but this effect was not 
observed in the clinical study.  
Ivacaftor had no effect on CNS or respiratory function in Sprague Dawley. Cardiovascular examination 
revealed a dose-related, but transient increase in the ABP parameters (SBP, DBP, and MAP) at 60 
minutes post dose, but was considered non-adverse due to the small magnitude and brief nature of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 34/165 
 
 
 
 
 
response. Fasted Sprague Dawley Rats administered a single dose of 250, 500 or 1000 mg/kg ivacaftor 
showed statistical significant increases in stomach plus content weight and in GI transit time.  
Overall, results from safety pharmacology studies evaluating tezacaftor and ivacaftor and of the 
secondary pharmacodynamic screening studies suggest a high degree of selectivity and a low potential 
to have biologically meaningful effects on vital function when tezacaftor and ivacaftor are administered 
in combination. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Combination safety pharmacology studies involving the co-administration of TEZ and IVA were not 
performed as the studies conducted on each individual entity were considered adequate and provided 
no evidence for the potential of additive or synergistic interaction in any of the endpoints evaluated. 
This is acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The nonclinical pharmacokinetics (PK) characteristics of TEZ were investigated in a series of in vitro 
and in vivo studies. In vivo studies were conducted in CD-1 mice, CByB6F1 mice, Sprague Dawley rats, 
pigmented Long-Evans rats, New Zealand White rabbits, Golden Syrian hamsters, cynomolgus 
monkeys and Beagle dogs. With the exception of pigmented rats, hamsters and monkeys, in vivo PK 
parameters for TEZ were evaluated all in species and strains employed in nonclinical safety 
pharmacology and toxicity studies for TEZ. Most studies were non-GLP and used the oral route of 
administration, the intended therapeutic route in humans. A similar set of nonclinical PK studies were 
previously conducted with IVA in support of the development and registration of Kalydeco, and those 
considered pivotal to assessment of the combination regimen. 
Methods of Analysis 
Tezacaftor / Ivacaftor 
The Applicant provided validation reports for the analytical methods used, demonstrating the suitability 
of the methods, storage and handling for the purpose of analysis of TEZ and its metabolites (M1-TEZ 
and M2-TEZ) and of IVA and its metabolites M1-IVA and M6-IVA. Specific and sensitive bioanalytical 
assays have been developed and validated for the quantitative determination of these compounds in 
rat, mouse, rabbit and dog plasma. In these methods, biological samples were extracted by liquid–
liquid extraction (GLP studies) or by protein precipitation (non-GLP studies) and analysed by LC-MS/MS 
with stable isotope labeled analogues of the analytes used as internal standards. The assay 
reproducibility was demonstrated at least once per species / per assay using an incurred samples 
reanalysis approach during sample analysis. The radiochemical procedures (QWBA, LSC and 
radiometric detector attached to HPLC) used to detect 14C-TEZ or 14C-IVA and its metabolites  
14C-M1-IVA and 14C-M6-IVA are adequate. The radiolabelled compounds are of sufficient chemical and 
radioactive purity. 
Absorption 
Tezacaftor 
The in-vitro Caco-2 cell transmembrane permeability of tezacaftor is high. The efflux ratio of tezacaftor 
was greater than 2. Similarly, M1-TEZ exhibited high permeability with an efflux ratio of 0.8 while  
M2-TEZ exhibited low permeability with an efflux ratio of 3.4. The bidirectional permeability of 
tezacaftor across Caco-2 cells appears to be influenced by active transport processes. In the presence 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 35/165 
 
 
 
 
 
of a Pgp inhibitor, the efflux ratio of TEZ but not that of M2-TEZ decreased, indicating that only TEZ is 
a substrate for Pgp. The permeability of M5-TEZ in MDCK-MDR1 and MDCK-WT cell lines was very low.  
Systemic clearance following intravenous administration was lower than hepatic blood flow in mice, 
rats, dogs and monkeys (~4% - 15% of hepatic blood flow) and the intravenous elimination half-life of 
tezacaftor was shorter than that of oral administration. 
Upon intravenous administration in cynomolgus monkey, tezacaftor demonstrated a low clearance 
(~4% of hepatic blood flow) and a moderate apparent volume of distribution. In monkeys, the volume 
of distribution of tezacaftor (0.66 L/kg) was equal to body water. In CF patient study 101, a larger 
apparent volume of distribution of tezacaftor (271 L) was found, i.e. larger than body water, after oral 
administration in fed state of TEZ 100 mg once daily in combination with IVA 150 mg every 12 hours. 
In mice, after single oral administration, tezacaftor was well absorbed and exhibited low clearance 
(12.4 ml/min/kg) and a moderate volume of distribution (1.56 L/kg). After repeated administration, 
there was a decrease of the systemic exposure to tezacaftor in males and females, likely due to 
enzyme induction. 
In rats, the pharmacokinetic pattern of tezacaftor followed a similar pattern as in mice. After single 
oral administration, tezacaftor was absorbed rapidly and good (53% bioavailability) and exhibited low 
clearance (7.21 ml/min) and a moderate volume of distribution (1.93 ml/min/kg). The increase in 
systemic exposure was dose-proportional over the dose range 9.25 to 203 mg/kg, and less than dose 
proportional at the 600 mg/kg dose level. The dose proportional increase in Cmax and AUC values over 
the dose range of 9.25 to 203 mg/kg and the consistent t1/2 estimates in the same range indicate 
linear kinetics in the disposition of TEZ from 9.25 to 203 mg/kg. After repeated administration in rats 
(7 day-, 1 month-, 3 month-, 6 month-, 12-mounth studies), the exposure of tezacaftor generally 
increased as the dose increased. The increase in exposure was dose proportional at lower dose levels 
from 20 to 200 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/kg/day, dependent on study duration, and was less than dose 
proportional at higher dose levels. No apparent accumulation of tezacaftor was observed, with the 
exception of the 52-week study at lower dose levels where 2-3 fold accumulation of tezacaftor was 
found. No meaningful sex-related differences were observed. In pregnant rats, the systemic exposure 
to tezacaftor was similar to non-pregnant rats at steady state. 
Toxicokinetic studies were performed in pregnant and non-pregnant rabbits to assess the exposure to 
tezacaftor the rabbit reproduction toxicity studies. These 2-week studies showed that repeated 
administration led to a dose-related exposure to tezacaftor. There was some evidence of accumulation 
of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ, but of M2-TEZ, in pregnant rabbits. 
In dogs, after single oral administration, tezacaftor was good absorbed (43% bioavailability) and 
exhibited a low clearance (1.95 ml/min/kg) and a low volume of distribution (0.48 L/kg). The increase 
in systemic exposure was dose-proportional over the tested dose range (3 to 300 mg/kg). After 
repeated administration in dogs (7-day-, 28-day-, 3-month-, 6-month- and 12-month studies) the 
exposure of tezacaftor, and the metabolites M1-TEZ or M2-TEZ, increased dose proportional in the 
tested dose range of 25 to 200 mg/kg/day. In general, no apparent accumulation was noted with 
tezacaftor or with the metabolites M1-TEZ or M2-TEZ. In addition, there was no evidence for sex 
difference or evidence for enzyme induction. The absorption of tezacaftor may be improved by the 
intake of food depending on the formulation used. In a 28-day investigative toxicity study in dogs, it 
was found that food increased the absorption of TEZ at a high dose level of 100 mg/kg 1.6 and 5 fold 
using respectively amorphous (spray dried dispersion) and micronized crystalline drug substance. 
M2-TEZ, which is a major circulating metabolite in humans, was not formed to a significant amount in 
rats and dogs, the species of the pivotal toxicology studies. Therefore, M2-TEZ was dosed to rats and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 36/165 
 
 
 
 
 
dogs in separate studies. When M2-TEZ was administered subcutaneously at 500 mg/kg in male rats, 
the AUC0-∞ was 312 µg*h/mL but multiple dose treatment was stopped due to the adverse injection 
site reactions. When M2-TEZ was administered subcutaneously at 10 mg/kg to dogs, an AUC of 147 
μg*h/mL was achieved. Intravenous administration of M2-TEZ to dogs resulted in systemic plasma 
clearance of 1.32 mL/min/kg. The volume of distribution at steady state was low and the T½ was 
moderate, with respective values of 0.44 L/kg and 8.0 hr.  
Ivacaftor 
Ivacaftor was orally rapidly absorbed in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs, with the extent of absorption 
ranging from 30% to 100%. Apparent permeability of ivacaftor in vitro, using a Caco-2 cell-based 
assay, was high, which suggests that human intestinal absorption will be high following oral 
administration. 
Ivacaftor and its major metabolite M6 are not a substrate for efflux protein P-gp, while its major 
metabolite M1 may inhibit P-gp. 
Systemic exposure to ivacaftor tended to increase during repeat oral dosing at toxicological dose levels 
to mice, rats, rabbits and dogs, possibly due to accumulation of ivacaftor in plasma, and Tmax values 
increased with increasing dose levels, suggesting solubility limited absorption process. Therefore, a 
number of formulations studies were carried out in the preclinical phase to find an optimal formulation 
and dosage form. 
Food improved the absorption of ivacaftor at a high dose at high dose level of 120 mg/kg; whereas, it 
was similar at a lower dosage of 10 mg/kg in suspension formulation. 
Interspecies comparison of systemic exposure following oral dosing with ivacaftor showed that the 
systemic exposure to ivacaftor in males and females at the NOAEL dose level at the end of 6-month rat 
and 12-months dog studies is equivalent to approximately 16 and 20 times; and 12 and 9 times the 
exposure seen in humans at the proposed therapeutic dose, respectively. 
Systemic clearance following intravenous administration was lower than hepatic blood flow in mice, 
rats, dogs and monkeys and the intravenous elimination half-life of ivacaftor was shorter than that of 
oral administration, suggesting exposure was limited by absorption. 
Low clearance and high fraction absorbed led to high systemic exposure to ivacaftor in all species. 
Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor combination 
Systemic exposures to tezacaftor and ivacaftor in combination toxicity studies in rats (1 month and 3 
months studies) and dogs (1 month study) were similar to the exposures observed when these 
compounds were dosed individually. In these combination toxicity studies, no relevant differences were 
observed in systemic exposures or peak plasma concentrations for tezacaftor, ivacaftor and 
metabolites. The exposure of tezacaftor and ivacaftor generally increased as the dose increased, and 
the increase in exposure was dose proportional at lower dose levels and was less than dose 
proportional at higher dose levels. In general, no accumulation of tezacaftor or M1-TEZ was noted. For 
ivacaftor, M1-IVA and M6-IVA some accumulation was evident in rats, whereas in dogs, some 
accumulation was observed in males, but not in females. 
Distribution 
Tezacaftor 
Upon intravenous administration tezacaftor demonstrated a moderate volume of distribution. In beagle 
dogs and cynomolgus monkeys, the volume of distribution of tezacaftor (0.48 - 0.66 L/kg) was equal 
to body water and in mouse and rat (1.6 – 1.9 L/kg), it was about 2-fold higher than body water. In CF 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 37/165 
 
 
 
 
 
patient study 101, a larger apparent volume of distribution of tezacaftor (271 L) was found, i.e. larger 
than body water, after oral administration in fed state of TEZ 100 mg once daily in combination with 
IVA 150 mg every 12 hours. 
Protein binding of tezacaftor is high (>98%) plasma, and similar across species. M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and 
M5-TEZ are also highly bound to plasma proteins and similar across species (>97.5%), except M2-TEZ 
which is less protein bound in mouse plasma (93.6%). These protein binding percentages were 
independent of concentration, indicating that no saturation of binding was evident up to 10 μM. The 
unbound fractions were low with minimal differences in percentages unbound across nonclinical species 
(1.4% - 2.0%) and human (0.9%). Human serum albumin is the major human plasma protein for 
tezacaftor, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ binding, where whereas alpha-1-acid glycoprotein appears to 
play a minimal role. 
In normal and pregnant rats, 14C-tezacaftor-related material is rapidly distributed across all tissues, 
with detectable amounts noted in all tissues at 1 hour post dose. The gastrointestinal tract and liver 
showed the highest levels of radioactivity, at distance followed by the adrenal glands, pancreas, 
kidneys, heart and lungs. Lower levels were observed in the salivary glands, thyroid, mesenteric lymph 
nodes, spleen, prostate, thymus, fat, muscle, skin, and urinary bladder, followed by the testes and 
eyes. Lowest exposures were in the brain, indicating that tezacaftor does not readily cross the blood-
brain-barrier. The tissue distribution of tezacaftor in pigmented rats was similar to that in albino rats, 
suggesting that tezacaftor does not bind to melanin containing tissues (skin, eyes). 
The placental transfer was minimal and the exposures of tezacaftor in foetuses was low.  
A study with unlabelled tezacaftor that studied the distribution of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ in the brain, 
lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, testes, fat, skin and spleen showed that the exposure to M1-TEZ in these 
tissues was up to two times higher than the exposure to tezacaftor. The tissue to plasma AUC ratio for 
tezacaftor was approximately 6.8 for the liver, 3.7 for the pancreas, 2.5 for the lung, and 
approximately 0.3 for the skin. For M1-TEZ, the tissue to plasma AUC ratio was highest in the liver 
(~8.7), and was ~5.3 for the lung, ~0.8 for the brain and ~0.2 in the skin. 
Tezacaftor and M1-TEZ lung distribution was similar following single dose or multi-dose administration. 
A 7-day lung distribution study in rats showed that tezacaftor distributes more to the lung than to the 
plasma. Tezacaftor was detected in the plasma, lung, trachea, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at 2 
hours post dose indicating that tezacaftor distributes to the respiratory tract and is excreted from the 
lung into the epithelial lining fluid. In the lung, the exposure of the lung to M1-TEZ was about 2.5 
times greater than the exposure of tezacaftor to the lung, indicating that the retention of M1-TEZ was 
somewhat higher than of tezacaftor in lung tissue and plasma. 
Tezacaftor and ivacaftor are not preferentially distributed into red blood cells. 
Ivacaftor 
Ivacaftor demonstrated a large apparent volume of distribution, indicative of a high penetration of 
these drugs into tissues. In cynomolgus monkey, the volume of distribution (0.69 L/kg) was greater 
than body water. In CF patient study 101, the apparent volume of distribution of ivacaftor was 206 L, 
after oral administration in fed state of IVA 150 mg every 12 hours in combination with TEZ 100 mg 
once daily. 
Plasma protein binding of ivacaftor and its major metabolites (M1-IVA and M6-IVA) was greater than 
98% in vitro in mouse, rat, dog, and human plasma and to isolated human plasma protein 
components. Human serum albumin was the main plasma component involved in the binding of 
ivacaftor or its metabolites in human plasma.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018

Ivacaftor was rapidly distributed across all tissues in rats. Tissues in the gastrointestinal tract showed 
highest ivacaftor exposure, followed by organs of eliminations (liver, kidney), organ of gland systems 
(adrenal, lymph nodes, pancreas, thyroid, thymus) and lungs. Lowest exposures were noted in the 
brain, eyes and testes. Ivacaftor was not bound to melanin containing tissues.  
The ratio of ivacaftor levels to plasma were 3.80 and 0.939 for the lung and trachea, respectively. 
Thus, ivacaftor distributes more readily to the lung, trachea and lung epithelial lining fluid than to the 
plasma when administered orally to male rats. Furthermore, the ratio of the concentration of ivacaftor 
in the epithelial lining fluid to that in the plasma is 8.13, indicating substantial distribution of the 
compound to the lung and its excretion to the epithelial lining fluid. 
Placental transfer of ivacaftor in rats and rabbits was minimal and the exposures to ivacaftor in 
foetuses were low. Ivacaftor accumulated in the milk of lactating rats. 
Metabolism 
Tezacaftor 
In vivo metabolism of tezacaftor was investigated in 14C-radiolabel studies in rats and dogs. In rats, 
main metabolism involved the formation of a dehydrogenation metabolite (M1-TEZ), a phosphate 
conjugate of M1-TEZ (M5-TEZ), and an oxidation metabolite of M1-TEZ (M2-TEZ). In plasma of rats, 
primarily unchanged tezacaftor, M1-TEZ (AUCinf 1.29-fold of tezacaftor) and M5-TEZ (AUCinf 0.75-fold 
of tezacaftor) were found. M2-TEZ was a major component in bile (approximately 25% of dose) but 
was low in plasma (0.05-fold of TEZ).  
In dogs, metabolism mainly involved the formation of glucuronides of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ. In 
plasma, primarily unchanged tezacaftor, M3-TEZ (glucuronide of tezacaftor) and M12-TEZ (glucuronide 
of M1-TEZ) were found. M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ were low in dog plasma (<5% of total AUC). In 
bile, most of the radioactivity was associated with M3-TEZ and M11-TEZ (glucuronides of tezacaftor), 
and M12-TEZ and M13-TEZ (glucuronides of M1-TEZ).  
Of the major circulating human metabolites (M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ), M1-TEZ and M5-TEZ were 
formed in significant amounts in rats but only to a low extent in dogs. In mice, the plasma exposure 
for M1-TEZ and M2-TEZ was 166% and 12.5% relative to TEZ, respectively. At steady state, the 
exposure to M1-TEZ and M2-TEZ was ~4.2 - 6.0x and ~0.24 - 0.40x relative to TEZ especially at the 
higher dose levels. As M2-TEZ was not formed to a significant amount in the preclinical species used 
for the toxicology studies, rats and dogs, M2-TEZ was dosed to rats and dogs in separate studies.   
In vitro data indicate that CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are the predominant cytochrome P450 enzymes 
involved in the metabolism of tezacaftor and also of M1-TEZ. M1-TEZ was the most abundant 
metabolite (besides the parent compound) following incubation with liver microsomes or hepatocytes 
from rat, dog, monkey and human. In the in vivo studies, M1-TEZ was also a major metabolite in rats 
and humans but not in dogs (monkeys were not studied in vivo). In dog liver microsome incubations, 
glucuronidated metabolites were major metabolites, as they were also in dog plasma in the in vivo 
study. However, glucuronidated metabolites M4a and M4b were apparently not detected to a relevant 
extent in the in vivo dog study. M5-TEZ, which is a major in vivo metabolite in rats and humans, was 
not formed in the in vitro studies in microsomes / hepatocytes of these species. M5-TEZ was relatively 
stable in human, dog and rat hepatocytes / liver microsomes. Minimal formation of M1-TEZ and M2-
TEZ in these incubations indicate that some of the M5-TEZ (which is phosphorylated M1-TEZ) is 
converted back into M1-TEZ. 
Ivacaftor 
The metabolic profile of ivacaftor in both animals and humans are qualitatively similar. Following 
extensive metabolism, M1-IVA and M6-IVA were major circulating metabolites. M1 is pharmacologically 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 39/165 
 
 
 
 
 
active metabolite (1/6th of the potency of ivacaftor) and M6 is not considered as an active metabolite 
(< 1/50th of the potency of ivacaftor). The metabolism of IVA was catalysed primarily by phase I 
oxidation (M1-IVA, M6-IVA), with minor contribution by phase II glucuronidation and sulfation (M1-IVA 
sulphate).  
Based on in vitro data, human CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are the predominant isozymes involved in the 
metabolism of ivacaftor and M1-IVA. M6-IVA was not metabolized in vitro by any of the human CYPs. 
In vitro inhibition studies suggest that ivacaftor and M1-IVA may have pharmacokinetic interactions 
with other drugs that are CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A or P-gp substrates.  
The systemic exposure to M1-IVA was higher than to M6, with AUC0-24hr ratios of M1-IVA to ivacaftor 
ranging from 5% to 24% in mice, 6% to 34% in rats, and 7% to 25% in dogs versus AUC0-24hr ratios 
of M6-IVA to ivacaftor ranging from 1% to 7% in mice, 1%  to 20% in rats and 2%  to 10% in dogs. 
Both M1-IVA and M6-IVA demonstrated dose-limitations to achieving high exposures by intravenous 
administration in rats, since they are practically insoluble in an aqueous vehicle suitable for repeat-
dose studies, and had moderate to high clearance. M1-IVA and M6-IVA had low exposures due to 
solubility-limited absorption after oral administration in rats in a 100% organic vehicle (PEG400). 
Excretion 
Tezacaftor 
In intact rats, intact dogs and humans the main route of excretion of tezacaftor was via the faeces 
(75% - 79%, 58% and 72% of dose, respectively). Faecal excretion in intact dogs was relatively low 
probably due to liquid faeces in some of the animals as also a high amount in the cage rinse (18%) 
was found. Studies with bile duct cannulated (BDC) rats and dogs showed that large part of faecal 
excretion was due to excretion via the bile (53% and 50% of dose in orally dosed BDC rats and dogs 
respectively). Excretion via the urine was low, generally below 10% of dose in rats and dogs and 14% 
in humans.  
In rats, total radioactivity in faeces was excreted primarily as unchanged tezacaftor and M2-TEZ and in 
bile primarily as M2-TEZ. In dogs, radioactivity in bile was excreted primarily as glucuronides of 
tezacaftor and of M1-TEZ. 
Tezacaftor was excreted in milk of rats with a Cmax in milk of 1.5 times the Cmax in maternal plasma. 
Ivacaftor 
Faecal elimination is the predominant route of excretion in rat and humans. As the result of extensive 
metabolism, only 2.5% of the total radioactive dose of ivacaftor was excreted as unchanged parent in 
humans. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
A set of toxicity studies has been conducted with TEZ to determine its toxicological profile. These 
studies are listed below. A similar set of studies was conducted previously for IVA to support the 
clinical development and registration of Kalydeco. Given that TEZ is being developed in combination 
with IVA, the GLP-compliant studies with IVA considered pivotal to the safety assessment of the 
proposed combination regimen.

Table 1 Repeat-Dose Toxicity Studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 41/165 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity studies were not conducted with TEZ in mice or rats, since they are no longer 
recommended in the ICH M3(R2) guidelines. TEZ was dosed at a single dose up to 2000 mg/kg in male 
and female mice in a micronucleus assay; the MTD was established at 2000 mg/kg. The single-dose or 
acute oral toxicity profile of IVA was previously established in GLP-compliant studies (in mice and rats) 
conducted in support of the registration of Kalydeco. While these studies are not considered pivotal to 
the safety assessment of the proposed combination regimen, the MTD in mice and rats was established 
at 2000 and 500 mg/kg, respectively. Thus, the acute oral toxicity of IVA was considered to be of low 
order, particularly considering the exposures achieved in these studies. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat dose oral toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats and dogs to explore the toxic potential 
of TEZ following repeated oral exposure up to 52 weeks.  
In both rats and dogs, decreased food consumption accompanied by a decrease in bodyweight gain 
was observed, especially in the first weeks of dosing. In addition, in rats a decrease in erythrocytic 
parameters and subsequent increase in circulating reticulocytes was observed. However, both these 
finding did not translate in clinical studies conducted with TEZ and IVA combined therapy. Also 
observed in both rats and dogs following repeated administration of TEZ was the microscopic finding of 
minimal to mild dilated lacteals in the villi tips of the duodenum, jejunum and/or ileum. Dilatation of 
lacteals was considered non-adverse by the applicant in all toxicity studies based on a lack of 
progression over time and severity of the finding. It should be noted that safety factors for this effect 
are low or absent: Tezacaftor exposures at the NOAEL in rats (50 mg/kg/day) and dogs (10 
mg/kg/day), were 2.2-2.6 fold (rat) or 0.3–0.4 (dogs) fold times the expected exposure (steady-state 
AUC0-24hr) at the human therapeutic dosage. However, since there is an absence of TEZ-related 
clinical signs and/or clinical pathology findings that could be related to this effect, it can be concluded 
that dilated lacteals are unlikely to be relevant for humans.  
Repeat-dose toxicity studies previously conducted in support of the registration of Kalydeco and 
ranging from sub-acute to chronic in duration identified the liver (mice and rats) as the only IVA-
related target organ of toxicity. The mechanism of hepatotoxicity is believed to be a rodent-specific 
phenomenon and not relevant to humans. 
Combination repeat-dose toxicity studies involving the co-administration of TEZ and IVA up to 3 
months in duration in rats and 28 days in duration in dogs did not produce any unexpected toxicities or 
interactions. Noteworthy, test article-related microscopic findings in both rats and dogs were non-
adverse minimal-to-mild dilated lacteals noted in the duodenum, jejunum, and/or ileum of the small 
intestine. This was also noted in the repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted with TEZ suggesting no 
additive or synergistic effects noted with the combination of TEZ/IVA for this finding.  
Genotoxicity 
The designs of the pivotal GLP-compliant genotoxicity studies evaluating the mutagenic and clastogenic 
potential of TEZ and those previously conducted for IVA to support registration of Kalydeco are 
presented in below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 42/165 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 2 Genotoxicity Studies 
Both TEZ and IVA were concluded to be negative for mutagenic and clastogenic potential when 
evaluated in the specified battery of genotoxicity studies. M2-TEZ was also concluded negative for 
mutagenic and clastogenic potential in vitro. Combination genotoxicity studies involving the co-
administration of TEZ and IVA were not performed as the studies conducted on each individual entity 
were considered adequate for hazard identification and assessment of the genetic toxicity risk 
associated with co-administration.  
Carcinogenicity 
Tezacaftor was tested in a half year carcinogenicity study in mice and a two year carcinogenicity study 
in rats. In both studies, tezacaftor was dosed up to the maximum tolerated dose. In mice, minimal 
decreased body weight, decreased motor activity and hunched posture were observed. 
Hemangiocarcinoma was minimally significantly increased in males at low dose, but not at higher 
doses. Due to the lack of dose response, it is agreed that this effect can be considered not 
toxicologically significant. In addition, mainly non-neoplastic effects in the liver were observed, 
including, centrilobular hypertrophy which increased in severity over dose at all doses in males and 
high dose in females.  In adrenal glands in males, minimal X-zone degeneration and adreno-cortical 
hypertrophy was observed. A decrease in corpora lutea was observed in females. In rats, body weight 
was decreased at high dose throughout the study in absence of a decrease in food consumption.  
Benign cholangiomas were observed in 2/70 females at high dose and the increased incidence was 
statistically significant. However, there was an absence of tezacaftor-related bile duct proliferation and 
effects on the bile duct were also not observed in repeated dose studies in rat. Marginally and not 
significantly increased incidences were noted in a dose responsive manner for other tumour types, 
including malignant pheochromocytomas in males, malignant lymphomas in males, and pars distalis

carcinomas of the pituitary gland in females. Non-neoplastic legions included minimal to mild dilated 
lymphatics was observed in the ileum, GALT and to a lesser extent, jejunum.  
Tezacaftor was not found to be carcinogenic in mouse and rat. Tezacaftor exposure was 1.1-1.8 and 
2.1-3.9 fold exposure at the MRHD in human, for mice and rat, respectively. In rat, exposure to 
Tezacaftor + M1-TEZ was 2.2 and 3.8 fold exposure at MRHD for males and females, respectively. 
Ivacaftor was tested in two year carcinogenicity studies in rats and in mice. 
In both rat and mice, no neoplastic findings were attributed to ivacaftor. Non-neoplastic findings in the 
mouse included an increase of myofiber mineralization in the heart and skeletal muscle in females at 
high dose. This effect was considered to be non-adverse. 
Ivacaftor was not found to be carcinogenic in both rat and mouse. At the highest dose tested, ivacaftor 
exposure was 5-9 and 21-39 fold exposure at the MRHD in human, for mice and rat, respectively. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Table 3 Reproductive and Developmental Studies 
Fertility 
Tezacaftor did not have an adverse effect on male or female fertility or early embryonic development 
in rats up to 2.6 fold exposure at the MRHD. At this dose, number of abnormal sperm was slightly 
increased, but did not affect male fertility and was within historical control. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 44/165 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ivacaftor was associated with a decrease of overall fertility index and number of pregnancies in 
females, with significant reductions in number of corpora lutea and implantation sites with subsequent 
reductions in the average litter size and average number of viable embryos per litter. Ivacaftor was did 
not affect male fertility. In males significant weight decrease of the seminal vesicles without fluid was 
observed, but as no effects on male fertility could be determined this is not considered adverse. The 
ivacaftor margin of safety for female fertility is 0.6 times the MRHD. 
Embryo-fetal development 
The effect of tezacaftor on embryo-fetal development was tested in rat and rabbit. Maternal toxicity 
included decreases of body weight and food consumption during treatment, which was partially 
recovered after treatment in both species. In rat, no adverse effects on the fetus were observed. In 
the rabbit, at maternal toxic doses fetal weight was decreased. Exposure at the embryo fetal NOAEL 
was 3.1 and 0.2 fold exposure at MRHD in human, for rat and rabbit, respectively. 
Ivacaftor was not teratogenic dosed orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis. In rats, 
at moderate to severe maternal toxic doses, reductions of fetal body weight and increases in variations 
of skeletal development were observed, including cervical ribs, incompletely ossified ribs, wavy ribs 
and sternal irregularities. These variations are commonly observed in the presence of maternally toxic 
doses, and are therefore in this study not considered adverse.  In rabbit, extreme maternal toxicity 
was observed at the high and mid dose tested, leading to morbidity and resulting in abortions and total 
litter loss. Exposure at the embryo fetal NOAEL was 15 fold exposure at MRHD in human, for both rat 
and rabbit. 
Pre- and postnatal toxicity 
In the pre- and postnatal study, tezacaftor induced maternal toxicity at mid and high dose. Due to 
severe toxicity, the high dose (100 mg/kg/day) was terminated early at lactation day (LD) 17/18 and 
one animal was euthanized in extremis at GD13 due to severe body weight loss and decreased food 
consumption. Maternal adverse effects included decreased body weight during gestation and lactation 
(up to -17%) and decreased food consumption at both mid (50 mg/kg/day) and high dose and 
thinness at high dose only. In addition at high dose, poor pup survival was observed. Pups showed 
clinical signs including decreased activity, thin appearance, skin cold to touch and skin discoloured 
purple in pups during lactation, pre-weaning developmental delays (pinna detachment, eye opening 
and static righting reflexes), sexual maturation delays (vaginal opening and preputial separation), 
effect on pup motor activity (increases in total distance travelled), and in F1 female animals lower 
corpora lutea counts, fewer uterine implantation sites and fewer viable embryos in the GD13 uterine 
fertility assessments were noted. In addition, at mid dose only, fertility index was low in female F1 
animals and effects on oestrous cycle were observed. These effects were not observed at high dose, 
but cannot be excluded as a tezacaftor induced effect, as exposure at high dose was discontinued early 
and due to small number of litters at high dose for continuation of the study. The NOAEL for pre and 
post-natal toxicity and maternal toxicity was 25 mg/kg/day. Exposure at this dose is 0.9 fold exposure 
at the MRHD. 
Ivacaftor exposure was associated with reductions of survival and lactation indices and decreased pup 
body weight in the pre- and postnatal development study. No developmental effects were observed at 
the NOAEL of 100 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to an exposure of 15 fold at the MRHD. 
Juvenile toxicity 
Juvenile toxicity studies have not been conducted with tezacaftor. A juvenile rat study was conducted 
for a previous application (Kalydeco) to support the treatment of young children less than two year of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 45/165 
 
 
 
 
 
age with ivacaftor. Cataracts were seen in juvenile rats dosed with ivacaftor from postnatal day 7 to 35 
at dose levels of 10 mg/kg/day (0.12 times the recommend human dose) and higher. This finding has 
not been observed in older animals and its potential relevance in humans is unknown. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic profile of TEZ was evaluated in the 3-month oral (tablet) repeat dose toxicity study.  
Local Tolerance  
Dermal and ocular local tolerance studies with tezacaftor were performed as part of a handler safety 
package to aid in setting worker protection levels during manufacture. Tezacaftor was predicted to be a 
dermal non-irritant in the EPIDERM assay and a mild eye irritant in vivo in the rabbit. 
Other toxicity studies 
Tezacaftor and ivacaftor were both negative for antigenicity in the murine local lymph node assay. 
M2-TEZ subcutaneous repeat-dose toxicity was evaluated in rats and dogs up to 28 days. However, in 
rats, severe adverse injection site reactions were observed on day 1 and 2 in the middle- and high 
dose animals. Therefore, animals were necropsied on day 3. M2-TEZ was better tolerated in dogs and 
clinical observations were limited to the injection sites including epidermal erosion/ulcer and associated 
inflammation, oedema, and other dermal and/or subcutaneous findings. M2-TEZ was not found to be 
genotoxic in the Ames assay and chromosomal aberration assay in HPBL cells. 
No dedicated genotoxicity tests have been performed for the metabolites M1-TEZ and M5-TEZ. In 
genotoxicity test S9 metabolic activation is expected to result in TEZ-M1 and TEZ-M5 exposure.  
Exposure of the M1-TEZ and M5-TEZ metabolites was at a sufficient level in the tezacaftor in vivo 
mouse chromosome aberration assay and tezacaftor mouse and rat carcinogenicity assays. All 
genotoxicity tests for tezacaftor were negative, and therefore M1-TEZ and M5-TEZ are also not 
considered genotoxic. As highest dose tested in the carcinogenicity studies was the MTD, these studies 
are considered sufficient for studying possible carcinogenicity of M1-TEZ and M5-TEZ.  
Tezacaftor metabolite M2-TEZ was tested for embryo-fetal developmental toxicity in pregnant rabbits 
subcutaneously. The systemic exposure to M2-TEZ increased approximately 10-fold in rats and dogs 
when the compound was administered subcutaneously relative too orally. At doses with moderate to 
severe maternal toxicity (local tolerance, body weight gain and food consumption effects) no effects on 
fetal development or survival were observed. A large part of the observed maternal toxicity was due to 
adverse effects at the injection site. At the fetal NOAEL M2-TEZ exposure was 213 mg/kg/day, which is 
1.8 fold of the exposure at the MRHD. 
Impurities are considered toxicologically qualified based on in silico data generated by DEREK and 
SARAH or data of repeat dose toxicity studies in dog and rat. Four potential impurities (VRT-0826681, 
VRT-0909604, VRT-0910507, and VRT-0911436) were found negative for genotoxicity.  
Tezacaftor was not found to be phototoxic in Balb/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts.

A study on bioaccumulation of ivacaftor is not available yet and the PBT assessment cannot be finalised 
in the current evaluation. Furthermore, the ivacaftor and the tezacaftor ERAs cannot be finalised for 
the STP, surface water, groundwater, sediment and terrestrial compartment because of the absence of 
relevant study reports. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation to be addressed: 
• 
• 
The final updated tezacaftor Phase II ERA report and the reports for the studies discussed 
should be submitted by 30 September 2018.  
The final updated ivacaftor Phase II ERA report and the reports for the studies discussed 
should be submitted by 31 March 2019. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The FRT system was used to analyse the effect of tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor on processing and 
trafficking and chloride transport of normal CFTR, F508del-CFTR, a number of RF mutants, splice 
mutants and a set of Kalydeco responsive gating mutants.  
The combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor is regarded effective in vitro when  
(1) a statistically significant increase in chloride transport over baseline normal;   
(2) a ≥10 pp increase in chloride transport over baseline as a percentage of normal CFTR;  
(3) a statistically significant increase in chloride transport compared to treatment with ivacaftor alone, 
are demonstrated.  
To include mutants in the indication based on in vitro data only, the applicant would have to 
convincingly demonstrate that the in vitro FRT model is valid. External validation of the model is not 
accepted. Van Goor and colleagues (2014) also characterised various missense mutations associated

with defects in protein processing or function in FRT cells. There were differences in the baseline values 
of mature CFTR values (expressed as % of normal CFTR) and of chloride transport (expressed as % of 
normal CFTR) compared to the data provided in the TEZ/IVA dossier. This may be caused by 
differences in design e.g. time of addition of the compound.   
Furthermore, in addition to this experiment, CFTR mRNA expression in FRT cells was measured. The 
level of mature CFTR mRNA expression was generally similar between normal and most CFTR mutant 
forms tested with three exceptions: P47L-, E92K, and A455E-CFTR. The range in baseline chloride 
transport did not appear to be affected due to differences in CFTR mRNA levels or total protein levels 
(mature + immature) for most mutant CFTR forms, except for R117C-CFTR (38 ± 5% normal CFTR, 
being significantly lower) suggesting that the baseline level of chloride transport may be 
underestimated. In contrast, the estimated total protein levels for E193K-CFTR (177 ± 12% normal 
CFTR), R352Q-CFTR (178 ± 4% normal CFTR), and D1152H-CFTR (256 ± 16% normal CFTR) were 
higher compared with normal CFTR, suggesting that the baseline chloride transport may be 
overestimated by ~1.8 to 2.6 fold for these three mutant CFTR forms.  In conclusion, given that 
Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells expressing the mutants of interest are proposed as a validated assay to 
predict possible clinical response in subjects carrying at least one of these mutations, the applicant was 
requested to describe the experimental conditions of the studies performed of Western Blot and Ussing 
chamber, including whether mRNA expression for each of the mutants has been quantified. A 
comparison versus the results published by Van Goor (2014) was also requested, including whether 
these results support the applicant proposed classification (i.e., functional defect is mainly protein 
processing, function or both).   
As an overall conclusion of the response provided by the applicant, it would appear that the stably 
transfected FRT cell line is particularly useful for gathering information on the underlying defect of 
certain CFTR mutant proteins as they allow trans-epithelial ion transport and Western blot studies. 
However, their relevance of this for the in vivo situation is not fully established, given their non-human 
origin and the high levels of transfected CFTR expression in this system (see section 2.4). In addition, 
this system seems highly susceptible to the experimental conditions used (e.g. concentration of the 
test agents, acute versus chronic addition of the test agents, temperature etc). This has been shown 
by comparing the in vitro results available in the public domain in the same system versus the ones 
reported by the applicant. There seems to be an agreement between both sets of data in terms of 
which is the functional defect of each of the CFTR mutations considered for approval. However, some 
discrepancies arise, e.g. the magnitude of the changes observed for some specific mutations. The data 
presented are not reassuring of an in vitro – in vivo correlation and point to limitations of the FRT 
system to predict clinical efficacy. The scatterplots and clinical response in study 108 may only indicate 
that a cut-off would have been well chosen, but this could only be concluded in the presence of data on 
the ‘negative’ side of the cut-off. Therefore, there continues to be substantial degree of uncertainty 
over the sufficiency of the in vitro data based identification of on the FRT system to identify mutations 
using a panel of Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells for inclusion within the scope of the indication.  
Thus, considering the lack of a multi-pronged approach for the identification of patients with genotypes 
suitable for treatment, the in vitro model used is not sufficiently reliable to predict a clear clinical 
efficacy in patients with mutations where clinical date are missing.  
As a result of these considerations, the indication of Symkevi was restricted to those mutations, where 
clinical data from patients were presented. In addition, the Kalydeco responsive mutants, were also 
retracted from the indication, due to the negative clinical data observed in a clinical trial, please refer 
to section 2.5 for detailed discussion.

In the rat 2-year carcinogenicity study for tezacaftor, the incidence of pars distalis carcinoma in the 
pituitary gland in female rats was below historical control data. Benign cholangiomas in females, 
malignant pheochromocytomas in males, and malignant lymphomas in males occurred slightly above 
historical control. However, as the incidence of these findings was low or considered to be specific to 
rat as per the published literature, these effects are not relevant for the use in humans. Juvenile 
toxicity studies have not been conducted with tezacaftor, as the applicant states they are not required 
to support the current proposed indication for treatment of patients of 12 year and older. This is in line 
with the guideline on the need for non-clinical testing in juvenile animals of pharmaceuticals for 
paediatric use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/169215/2005), as there are no suggestions that tezacaftor has an 
effect on the CNS, reproductive organs or bone growth. Based on available data from toxicity studies, 
it is not expected that tezacaftor is potentially immunotoxic, or that it will have an effect on 
dependence. 
There were no human specific metabolites identified. However, the exposure safety margins of TEZ 
and IVA metabolite (M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ, M1-IVA and M6-IVA) at the NOAEL in repeat dose toxicity 
studies were low in some instances. Clinical experience, including placebo-controlled and long-term 
safety data from TEZ/IVA clinical studies and the established safety profile of ivacaftor, have 
demonstrated lack of translatability of adverse non-clinical findings. Therefore, the exposure-based 
margins are considered adequate for the proposed clinical use.  
As for the environmental risk assessment, both, tezacaftor and ivacaftor ERA studies were not 
completed but the applicant agreed to conduct further tests and submit their results post-
authorisation. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In the pharmacodynamic investigation of tezacaftor monotherapy and TEZ/IVA combination, 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor showed a consistent positive effect on sweat chloride in the investigated subjects 
with CF homozygous for F508del or heterozygous F508del/G551D or heterozygous for F508del and a 
residual function mutation (F/RF).  The pharmacokinetics of tezacaftor and ivacaftor has been 
investigated to a reasonable degree. However, a number of concerns remain to be resolved via post-
authorisation measures and the CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the non-
clinical issues and these have been committed to by the applicant in a letter of recommendation:

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of tezacaftor (and ivacaftor in combination with tezacaftor) as well as its major 
metabolites were investigated in both, healthy subjects and CF patients. Studies in healthy subjects 
were performed to understand dose-proportionality, effect of food on exposure, bioavailability from 
different formulations, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) characteristics, DDI 
potential of tezacaftor/ivacaftor as CYP3A substrate and a potential CYP3A and P-gp inhibitor, DDI with 
oral contraceptives, effect of moderate hepatic impairment on PK of tezacaftor/ivacaftor and effect of 
tezacaftor on the ECG QT interval. Further PK data were obtained from two Phase 2 studies and three 
Phase 3 studies to assess the effects of demographic characteristics and other covariates on 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor PK and to characterize the exposure-response relationships (population PK [popPK] 
and PK/PD). 
Both tezacaftor as ivacaftor were analysed using liquid chromatography with MS detection. In general, 
analytical methods for tezacaftor and its metabolites as well as for ivacaftor and its metabolites were 
validated with respect to accuracy, specificity and stability. Standard non-compartmental analyses 
methods were used to determine PK parameters in studies where intensive sampling was conducted 
(mainly Phase 1 studies). The potential drug-drug interaction between the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor 
fluconazole or the mild CYP3A4 inhibitor ciprofloxacin and tezacaftor were simulated using a PBPK 
model.

Absorption  
After administration of the tezacaftor/ivacaftor fixed dose combination (FDC) under fed conditions, 
maximum plasma concentrations for tezacaftor and ivacaftor were obtained after approximately 4 (2-
8) hours and 6 (3-10) hours, respectively. Based on interstudy comparisons, exposure between the 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC and separate tezacaftor and ivacaftor tablets under steady-state conditions 
was comparable. 
Food was shown to have no relevant effect on exposure to tezacaftor. The known food-effect of 
ivacaftor (3-fold increased AUCinf, 4-fold increased Cmax) was confirmed. As a result of the food-effect 
for ivacaftor, the FDC formulation is recommended to be administered with food. 
Distribution 
In vitro, both protein binding of tezacaftor, M1-tezacaftor, M2-tezacaftor, and M5-tezacaftor as well as 
that of ivacaftor, M1-ivacaftor, and M6-ivacaftor is high in human plasma, with approximately 99% 
bound to plasma proteins. Tezacaftor primarily binds to albumin and ivacaftor primarily to alpha 1-acid 
glycoprotein and albumin. After oral administration of tezacaftor 100 mg once daily in combination with 
ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours in patients with CF in the fed state, the mean range for apparent 
volume of distribution of tezacaftor and ivacaftor was approximately 270-300 L and 206-220 L, 
respectively. Neither tezacaftor nor ivacaftor partition preferentially into human red blood cells. 
Tezacaftor is metabolized extensively in humans. In vitro data indicate that tezacaftor and M1-
tezacaftor are metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Following oral administration of a single 
dose of 100 mg 14C-tezacaftor to healthy male subjects, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ, and M5-TEZ were the 3 
major circulating metabolites of tezacaftor in humans (contributing to 15%, 31%, and 33% of total 
radioactivity, respectively). Tezacaftor represents 7% of total radioactivity. M1-TEZ has similar potency 
to that of tezacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. M2-TEZ is much less 
pharmacologically active than tezacaftor or M1-TEZ, and M5-TEZ is not considered pharmacologically 
active. A minor circulating metabolite, M3-TEZ, is formed by direct glucuronidation of tezacaftor. 
It is known that ivacaftor is also metabolized extensively in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate 
that ivacaftor is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. M1-IVA and M6-IVA are the two major 
metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. M1-IVA has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and 
is considered pharmacologically active. M6-IVA is not considered pharmacologically active. 
Elimination 
After single dose administration of 100 mg tezacaftor in healthy volunteers, the mean elimination half-
lives for unchanged TEZ, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ were similar and ranged from 109 to 122 h 
after single dose administration. In the CF patient study 101, tezacaftor clearance under steady-state 
conditions in CF patients was 1.31 (0.41) l/h, and its elimination half-life was 156 (52.7) h. The t1/2 for 
M1-661 and M2-661 under steady state conditions were 128 (39.5) h and 129 (26.7) h, respectively. 
In a mass balance study, a mean of 72.2% of the radioactive TEZ dose was recovered in faeces and 
13.7% was recovered in urine through the last collection interval, resulting in a mean overall recovery 
of 85.9%. Tezacaftor is therefore mainly eliminated via the faeces, either as parent compound (34%) 
or as M2-TEZ (26% of the administered dose). Renal excretion accounts for approximately 13% of the 
administered dose (10% as M2-TEZ and 2.5% as M3-TEZ). Less than 1% of the dose is excreted as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 56/165 
 
 
 
 
 
parent compound via the urine. These results indicate that the majority of tezacaftor is excreted from 
the body via faeces following oral administration. 
In the CF patient Study 101, ivacaftor clearance under steady-state conditions was 15.7 (6.38) l/h, 
and its elimination half-life was 9.3 (1.72) h. The t1/2 for M1-IVA and M6-IVA were 11.3 (2.12) h and 
14.4 (6.14) h, respectively. From the original dossier, it is known that ivacaftor is mainly eliminated as 
metabolites via the faeces, with negligible renal excretion as parent compound. 
Pharmacokinetics of TEZ metabolites has been investigated to a reasonable extent. TEZ metabolites 
M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ have a t1/2 that is comparable to that of TEZ. Under steady-state, for 
each of the metabolites, exposure to M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ is approximately 1.5-fold higher 
than for TEZ. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Exposure to tezacaftor (administered alone or in combination with ivacaftor) increase in an 
approximately dose-proportional manner with increasing doses from 10 mg to 300 mg once daily. The 
pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor are generally linear with respect to time or dose ranging from 25 mg to 
250 mg (Kalydeco SmPC). Considering the lack of relevant PK interaction between ivacaftor and 
tezacaftor, this is expected also to be the case when given combination with tezacaftor. 
The accumulation ratio of 1.5-3 for tezacaftor when given once daily is in line with the t1/2 of 
approximately 155 h. Accumulation ratio’s for the tezacaftor metabolites are higher (ranging from 2.9 
to 18 for the different metabolites), since tmax for these metabolites is later than for tezacaftor (12-72 
hours), with comparable t1/2 of approximately 130 hours. For this reason, the relative amount of 
tezacaftor metabolites increases under steady state conditions as compared to single dose, exposure 
being approximately 1.5 higher than that of tezacaftor. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment: Renal clearance is likely to play a minimal role in the elimination of TEZ and IVA, 
and therefore no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. In 
the absence of clinical data, caution is recommended when administering TEZ and IVA combination 
therapy to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 15 to 29 
mL/min) or with end-stage renal disease. 
Hepatic impairment: Based on results from Study 009, which showed higher exposure of TEZ (36% for 
AUC, 20% based on the total increase in active TEZ/TEZ-M1 exposure) and IVA (52% for AUC) in 
subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, the Applicant proposes that the dose for patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) should be reduced to 1 TEZ 100 mg/IVA 150 mg 
tablet once daily. The evening dose of 150 mg IVA should not be taken. With respect to IVA, the 
proposed dose is in line with the dose advised for IVA as single agent. Despite the fact that data 
obtained with TEZ/IVA in moderate hepatically impaired patients would support the lack of a dose 
advice in case of moderate hepatic impairment, considering the therapeutic window of +/-50%, the 
dose advice is accepted to be aligned with that of IVA given as singe agent, for which additional data 
with a stronger effect of hepatic impairment are available. No dose adjustment for TEZ and IVA is 
needed in case of mild hepatic impairment. 
Gender, race and weight: No relevant difference in exposure between gender was noted, whereas the 
effect of race could not be evaluated, since only a very small number of non-white patients was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 57/165 
 
 
 
 
 
included in the clinical studies, 97.6% of subjects being White. No major differences in exposure were 
noted comparing the TEZ AUC in non-White patients with that in White patients. However, information 
on different races is considered to be very limited, as also reflected in the SmPC. TEZ exposure in 
different (high and low) weight categories are considered to be within the therapeutic range, and no 
clinically relevant effects on efficacy or safety are expected. 
Age: Only a low number of elderly patients 65-74 years of age (6 patients) were included in the clinical 
studies conducted for TEZ/IVA. Overall, age does not appear to be a relevant covariate in the pop-PK 
study. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Substrate in vitro:. Based on in vitro data, CYP3A4/5 are the main CYP isoforms involved in TEZ and 
IVA metabolism. Co-administration with CYP3A4/5 inhibitors or inducers may therefore result in 
change in TEZ and IVA exposure. With regard to drug transporters, in vitro, TEZ is a substrate for the 
uptake transporter OATP1B1 as well as for efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP. TEZ is no substrate for 
OATP1B3. M1-TEZ is substrate for P-gp. However, exposure to TEZ is not expected to be affected 
significantly by concomitant inhibitors of OATP1B1, P-gp, or BCRP due to its high intrinsic permeability 
and low likelihood of being excreted intact.  
Inhibition/induction in vitro: Based on in vitro data, TEZ and its metabolites are predicted not to inhibit 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 and they are not expected to 
induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. With regard to drug transporters, TEZ does not inhibit 
transporters P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3. Only limited inhibition of OATP1B1 
(IC50 3.2 μM) was observed in vitro. Based on in vitro data, IVA has the potential to inhibit CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9 and P-gp. No induction was noted by IVA and its metabolites. In vitro studies showed that IVA 
is not a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or P-gp.  
Effect of co-administered drugs on tezacaftor/ivacaftor in vivo: In vivo, co-administration of strong 
CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole caused a substantial increase in the exposure of TEZ (4-fold) and IVA (16 
fold) when administered in combination. Therefore, a reduction in the dose of TEZ and IVA combination 
therapy is recommended for co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors.  
Using a PBPK model, the effect of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors fluconazole, verapamil and 
erythromycin on TEZ exposure was investigated. The PBPK model is considered sufficiently validated, 
comparing simulated exposure data with actual TEZ exposure data with or without itraconazole and 
ciprofloxacin.   Based on the results of these PBPK analyses, in the presence of a moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole, verapamil, erythromycin), TEZ steady-state AUC and Cmax are predicted to 
increase 2.1-fold and 1.7-fold with fluconazole, 1.7- and 1.4-fold with verapamil and 2.6- and 2.0-fold 
with erythromycin, respectively.  
Further, PBPK simulations with the proposed dose in the presence of moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 
(100 mg TEZ every other day), sufficiently assure adequate exposure to TEZ in the presence of these 3 
different moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4. 
In IVA study 770-010, multiple-dose co-administration of IVA and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor 
fluconazole increased IVA exposure approximately 3-fold and increased M1-IVA exposure 
approximately 2-fold. These results indicate that fluconazole would cause a clinically relevant increase 
in TEZ and IVA exposures. Therefore, a reduction in the dose of TEZ and IVA combination therapy is 
recommended for co-administration with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. For ivacaftor, the dose reduction 
was already known from the Kalydeco dossier. In case of co-administration of the CYP3A4 inhibitor 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 58/165 
 
 
 
 
 
ciprofloxacin, no clinically relevant increase was noted for TEZ and IVA. Therefore, no dose adjustment 
is needed upon ciprofloxacin co-medication. 
Co-administration of the strong CYP3A inducer rifampicin substantially decreased IVA exposure (Study 
770-009), which is consistent with IVA being a sensitive CYP3A substrate. Although not investigated, 
TEZ exposure would also be expected to decrease with co-administration of strong CYP3A inducers, 
although it is not a sensitive CYP3A substrate based on the smaller (<5-fold) effect of itraconazole on 
TEZ compared to IVA. Nevertheless, co-administration of medicinal products that strongly induce 
CYP3A (e.g., rifampicin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort) with 
the combination of TEZ and IVA are not recommended as they may decrease the IVA and TEZ 
exposures and limit the effectiveness of the combination. These recommendations are consistent with 
the labelling for IVA monotherapy. 
Effect of TEZ/IVA on co-administered drugs in vivo. Administration of TEZ/IVA did not have a clinically 
relevant effect on the PK of CYP3A4 substrate midazolam. These results indicate that no dose 
adjustment is necessary when co-administering TEZ/IVA with a CYP3A substrate. Administration of 
TEZ/IVA increased P-gp substrate digoxin exposure approximately 1.3-fold compared with digoxin 
administered alone. These results are similar to the effect of IVA alone on digoxin (Study 770-016) and 
suggest a weak inhibition of P-gp by TEZ/IVA. Caution and appropriate monitoring are recommended 
when co-administering TEZ/IVA with sensitive P-gp substrates, e.g., digoxin, cyclosporine, everolimus, 
sirolimus, tacrolimus, or other medicinal products that are substrates of P-gp with narrow therapeutic 
windows. No significant DDI between ethinyl estradiol (EE) and norethindrone estradiol (NE) and 
TEZ/IVA was observed when the oral contraceptive was co-administrated with TEZ/IVA in healthy 
subjects. The results are consistent with DDI results between IVA and oral contraceptives in healthy 
subjects (Study 770-005). These results indicate that co-administration with TEZ/IVA is not expected 
to reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. 
Because based on in vitro studies IVA and M1-IVA may have the potential to inhibit CYP2C9, caution 
and monitoring is recommended when substrates of this isozyme with narrow therapeutic index (such 
as warfarin) are co-administered with TEZ/IVA.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Tezacaftor is a broad-acting CFTR corrector that facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of 
normal or multiple mutant forms of CFTR (including F508del-CFTR) to increase the amount of 
functional CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface, resulting in increased chloride transport. Ivacaftor 
is a CFTR potentiator that potentiates the channel-open probability (or gating) of CFTR at the cell 
surface to increase chloride transport. For ivacaftor to function CFTR protein must be present at the 
cell surface. Ivacaftor can potentiate the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface by tezacaftor, 
leading to a further enhancement of chloride transport than either agent alone. The combined effect of 
tezacaftor and ivacaftor is increased quantity and function of CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in 
increases in chloride transport, airway surface liquid height, and ciliary beat frequency.

Effects on Sweat Chloride 
Sweat chloride concentration is a direct measure of CFTR function in the sweat gland that is used as a 
PD marker of on-target activity of CFTR modulators. Sweat chloride was included in the Phase 2 
studies, Study 101 and 103, and in the Phase 3 studies, Study 106 and Study 108, as a measure of 
the effect of TEZ/IVA on CFTR activity. The studies included CF patients with different mutations.  
Patients with CF heterozygous for F508del/G551D: In study 101, the effect of TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 
mg q12h was evaluated in F/G551D subjects who were taking physician-prescribed Kalydeco (IVA 150 
mg q12h) before enrolling in the study. Subjects were randomized to receive TEZ 100 mg qd or 
placebo, and all subjects continued taking Kalydeco. For the VX-661 + ivacaftor group, the within-
group decrease in sweat chloride was -7.02 mmol/L (P = 0.053) compared to 10.18 mmol/L (P= 
0.1066) for Kalydeco (placebo group) alone; the difference in sweat chloride relative was -17.20 
mmol/L (P = 0.0238). The proportion of subjects with ≥10 mmol decrease in sweat chloride at the 
average through Day 28 were 0 subjects (Placebo + ivacaftor) and 4 (30.8%) subjects for VX-661 + 
ivacaftor.  
Patients with CF homozygous for F508del: The changes in sweat chloride were measured in patients 
with CF homozygous for F508del in three studies. In study 101, different doses of TEZ alone of 10, 30, 
100, and 150 mg qd and in combination with ivacaftor were tested.  IVA 150 mg q12h was selected 
because it is the approved Kalydeco dose for patients aged 12 years and older, and there is no 
clinically meaningful DDI between TEZ and IVA. A reduction in the mean sweat chloride compared to 
baseline was observed in all groups, with the exception of TEZ 10 mg qd. The largest effect is seen 
with TEZ 100 mg either as monotherapy or combination therapy. In the monotherapy groups, the least 
square (LS) means absolute change in sweat chloride for the monotherapy ranged from + 3.92  to -
20.43. For the combined therapy, the least square mean absolute change ranged from -2.63 to -6.04, 
see table below.

Table 8 Sweat Chloride (mmol/L): Absolute Change From Baseline Through Day 28 by 
MMRM, Full Analysis Set (Groups 1 through 5) 
In a responder analysis the proportion of subjects with ≥10 mmol decrease in sweat chloride through 
Day 28 was 2 (11.8%) subjects for VX-661 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h, 5 (27.8%) for subjects for 
VX-661 50 mg q12h/IVA 150 mg q12h. In study 101, ppFEV1 was also measured as pharmacodynamic 
parameter; these results are discussed in more detail in section on dose response studies. Study 103 
was a multicenter, 2-part study in subjects 18 years of age or older with CF, homozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR mutation. Two doses were included, VX-661 doses of 50 mg q12h (Group 1) and 100 
mg qd (Group 2) both combined with IVA 150 mg q12h. The within-group LS mean for average 
absolute change level from baseline in sweat chloride through Week 12 was -4.7 mmol/L (P = 0.0163) 
for Group  VX-661 100 mg qd/ IVA 150 mg q12h (n=15), and -10.6 mmol/L (P = 0.0011) for Group 
VX-661 50 mg q12h/IVA 150 mg q12h (n=6), and 1.9 mmol/L  (P = 0.2872) for Overall Placebo 
(n=18). The LS mean treatment difference for Group  VX-661 100 mg qd/ IVA 150 mg q12h versus 
Overall Placebo was -6.5 mmol/L (P = 0.0161). The LS mean absolute change from baseline in sweat 
chloride level was -6.6 mmol/L (P = 0.0002) during the 40-week OLE Phase. 
In the clinical study 106 in patients with CF homozygous for F508del, the difference in sweat chloride 
compared to placebo was -9.1 (P<0.0001) and -10.1 (-11.4, -8.8) (P<0.0001) after 4 weeks and 12 
weeks of treatment, respectively.  
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Exposure-response (E-R) analyses used clinical data from Studies 101, 103, and 106. The exposure-
response (E-R) modelling incorporated all TEZ monotherapy data from the Phase 2 Study 101. In 
addition to the on-treatment data, post-treatment washout data (the largest amount of which was 
collected in Study 101 following the 4-week treatment period) also contributed to the E-R analysis. 
Due to the long terminal elimination of TEZ, these data provided additional response data for 
exposures similar to the TEZ 10 mg qd dose. The difference between TEZ/IVA and TEZ is provided in

the LS mean treatment difference versus placebo for the absolute change in sweat chloride from study 
baseline to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 was -9.5 mmol/L (P<0.0001) for TEZ/IVA and -4.5 
mmol/L (P<0.0001) for IVA. The LS mean treatment difference for the absolute change in sweat 
chloride from study baseline to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 was -5.1 mmol/L in favour of 
TEZ/IVA compared to IVA (P<0.0001). 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Population PK analyses were conducted on pooled data from Studies 101, 103, 106, 107, and 108 
(Study N021). For these analyses, a 2-compartment popPK model with absorption driven by a 
sequential zero-order/ first-order process was used to describe the PK of TEZ. PopPK analyses for IVA

were conducted with a prior popPK model. In the same Study N021, nonlinear mixed-effects models 
were developed to describe the exposure-response (PK/PD) relationship for the absolute change in 
ppFEV1 and sweat chloride for F/F subjects. These PK/PD analyses pooled data from Studies 101, 103, 
and 106. 
QT/QTC Evaluation 
Potential QTc prolongation has been evaluated in Study VX15-661-010 in 116 healthy volunteers. 
Study 010 was a randomized, active and placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel arm, study, 
conducted in 2-part (Parts A and B). The objective of Part A was designed to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of multiple ascending doses of TEZ; the objective of Part B was to evaluate the effects of 
therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of TEZ compared with placebo on the QTc interval. A mixed-
effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) was used for testing the treatment difference of the 
ΔQTcF between the therapeutic dose and placebo was tested using. Prolongation was declared 
negative if the upper limit of the 1-sided 95% CI for the mean difference of the therapeutic dose 
versus placebo fell below 10 msec for every time point. In Part A, no subject had an increase of QTcF 
>30 msec. The upper limit of the 2-sided 90% CI for the mean difference of the 100-mg dose versus 
placebo fell below 10 msec at every time point. In Part B, no subject had an increase of QTcF >60 
msec. The upper limits of the 2-sided 90% CIs for the mean difference in ΔQTcF between the VX-661 
300-mg dose and placebo, fell below 10 msec at every time point for Day 14. The positive control 
(moxifloxacin) behaved appropriately (positive QTc signal); the study had assay sensitivity to allow for 
conclusions on QTc prolongation.  
There were no clinically relevant trends in standard ECG parameters, including no clinically significant 
increases or decreases over time in mean heart rate in subjects receiving TEZ 200-mg and 300-mg 
doses, compared to subjects receiving placebo or moxifloxacin. There were no obvious differences 
between the therapeutic and supratherapeutic TEZ doses.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of tezacaftor (and ivacaftor in combination with tezacaftor) as well as its major 
metabolites were investigated both in healthy subjects and CF patients. For the bioanalysis, non-chiral 
assays were used. Analytical methods for tezacaftor and its metabolites as well as for ivacaftor and its 
metabolites were adequately validated, with accuracy, specificity and stability meeting appropriate 
requirements.  
The dose advice for TEZ in the presence of various inhibitors of CYP3A4 was supported by a PBPK 
model. The PBPK model-predicted TEZ and M1 plasma-concentration-time curves in the absence and 
presence of itraconazole or fluconazole, as well as the prediction of the t1/2 were presented. The PBPK 
model was validated for baseline tezacaftor PK and the combination of tezacaftor and the strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole as well as the mild CYP3A4 inhibitor ciprofloxacin. This is considered 
sufficient by the CHMP. In addition, the applicant provided further qualifications for the PBPK model, 
i.e., other substrates have been studied with itraconazole and fluconazole in the platform, e.g., 
midazolam, simvastatin, and zolpidem.  
However, the CHMP considered that insufficient information was provided on the effect of genetic 
variations related to pharmacokinetics. Both TEZ and IVA are mainly metabolised by CYP3A4. For this 
enzyme, a relevant and relatively abundant variant with reduced activity has been reported, i.e., 
CYP3A4 *22. The Applicant did not make clear if high ratio’s in trough levels for TEZ and IVA and their 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 64/165 
 
 
 
 
 
metabolites which were identified could be related to the occurrence of e.g. a CYP3A4*22 genotype in 
the patients involved. Instead, the variation in Ctrough and the lack of concordance between the 
deviation from average levels for TEZ and IVA in the same patient was used as argument that 
CYP3A4*22 is not important for the high ratio’s that were observed at certain occasions. Such 
conclusion is not possible based on the provided data, since the applicant did not demonstrate that the 
CYP3A4*22 genotype indeed was present in the patients at stake nor if there were other CYP3A4*22 
patients in the study population. In the absence of such data, and bearing in mind that dose 
modifications are proposed for TEZ/IVA in combination with moderate (and strong) inhibitors of 
CYP3A4, a potential effect of CYP3A4 variants on exposure to TEZ and IVA cannot be excluded. 
Therefore, the applicant committed in the post authorisation phase to either provide the CYP3A4 
genotype of the patients included in the already submitted clinical studies, followed by further analysis 
of potential relationship between exposure (AUC, Cmax and Ctrough) and genotype, or provide 
additional in vivo data in healthy subjects, comparing exposure (AUC, Cmax and Ctrough) to TEZ and 
IVA in patients with CYP3A4*22 genotype and subjects with CYP3A4 wild-type phenotype.  
With respect to hepatic impairment, based on results from Study 009, which showed higher exposure 
of TEZ (36% increase for AUC, 20% based on the total increase in active TEZ/TEZ-M1 exposure) and 
IVA (52% increase for AUC) in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, the dose for patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) should be reduced to 1 TEZ 100 mg/IVA 150 mg 
tablet once daily. The evening dose of 150 mg IVA should not be taken. With respect to IVA, the 
proposed dose is in line with the dose advised for IVA as single agent. This is reflected in the SmPC. 
The lack of a dose-adjustment for TEZ in case of moderate hepatic impairment is agreed by the CHMP.  
The TEZ exposures in different weight categories are considered to be within the therapeutic window, 
and no clinically relevant effects on efficacy or safety are expected. The total number of patients over 
65 years of age included in the clinical studies is limited. No patients over 75 years of age have been 
included. Overall, age does not appear to be a relevant covariate in the pop-PK study N021. Based on 
the overview of the number of adolescents per study, and the plot showing simulated AUC vs age 
based on the pop-PK Study N021 model, comparing TEZ exposure in the age range 12-17 and >17 
years of age, no clinically relevant increase in TEZ exposure is observed in adolescents as compared to 
adult patients. Further, exposure to IVA in adolescents, when given in combination with 100 mg TEZ is 
comparable to that in adults.  
Based on actual study data, IVA and M1-IVA Cmax and AUC0-12h were approximately 30% higher after 
administration of TEZ/IVA than after administration of IVA alone. This increase is somewhat higher 
than reported based on the Pop-PK model (17% increase). However, this increase is not expected to 
result in clinically relevant changes in safety of IVA, as compared to the situation where IVA is given as 
single agent. 
Based on contemporary regulatory requirements, the potential for drug-drug interactions should be 
evaluated for a new drug and the relevant metabolites. This was not fulfilled with respect to induction 
of CYP1A2 and 2B6 for M1-TEZ and M2-TEZ, based on the assumption that nowadays the likelihood 
that TEZ/IVA is combined with a relevant drug is low. However, the applicant has initiated an in vitro 
induction study regarding potential induction of CYP2B6 by M1-TEZ and of CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 by M2-
TEZ, results of which will be submitted post-approval. This is agreed by the CHMP. 
The possible DDI between TEZ and M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ metabolites and warfarin due to 
displacement of warfarin from protein binding sites might not be clinically relevant due to the low 
hepatic extraction ratio of warfarin. Since monitoring of INR is already advised in the SmPC due to the 
fact that ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9, this is considered sufficient.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 65/165 
 
 
 
 
 
With regard to drug transporters, TEZ appears to inhibit OATP1B1 in vitro (IC50 3.2 μM). Since the TEZ 
I/IC50 for OATP1B1 is higher than the criteria of 0.02 and co-administration of an OATP1B1 substrate 
drug in the future cannot be excluded, an in vivo study investigating the potential DDI between 
TEZ/IVA and an OATP1B1 substrate will be conducted by the Applicant and will be submitted post-
approval. Further, as requested in the Guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interactions 
(CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1) and since future combination with OCT1, MATE and BSEP substrate drugs 
cannot be excluded, the applicant has initiated an in vitro study investigating the inhibitory effect of 
TEZ and its metabolites on OCT1 (SLC22A1), MATE1 (SLC47A1) and MATE2 (SLC47A) and BSEP 
(ABCB11) results of which will be submitted post-approval. Finally, an in vitro test for substrate 
characteristics towards BCRP is considered a basic requirement for new drugs like ivacaftor (in 
combination with tezacaftor). Effects of BCRP on IVA metabolites M1-IVA and M6-IVA cannot be 
excluded. Therefore, investigations elucidating whether ivacaftor and its metabolites are substrate for 
BCRP have been initiated by the applicant and results will be submitted post-approval, which is agreed 
by the CHMP. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The proposed mechanism of action is based on in vitro experiments where the combination of 
tezacaftor and ivacaftor caused a statistically significant increase in chloride transport over ivacaftor 
alone in the mutations that are proposed for approval, as described in  section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Changes in sweat chloride as a pharmacodynamic parameter for the activity of a CTFR modulator was 
investigated in the Phase II in Study 101 and 103, and in Phase 3 in Study 106 in subjects with CF, 
who are homozygous for F508del, and in Phase 3 in Study 108 in subjects heterozygous for F508del 
and a residual function mutation (F/RF). Study 101 included also subjects with CF, who are 
heterozygous F508del/G551D.  
TEZ 100 mg qd//IVA 150 mg q12h showed a reduction (improvement) in mean sweat chloride levels in 
all investigated populations. In the two pivotal studies 106 and 108 the reduction in sweat chloride 
observed was in the same range as observed with Orkambi, already authorised for treatment of 
patients with homozygous for F508del. In study 108, in subjects heterozygous for F508del, the 
reduction in sweat chloride concentration was also higher with TEZ/IVA than IVA supporting the 
combination. The effect was maintained during the open label period of 40 weeks in study 103 in 27 
patients. The reduction is considered relevant for patients with F/F mutations from the perspective that 
mutations with residual CFTR activity have sweat chloride levels approximately 10% lower (improved) 
than severe mutations and have disease manifestations that are either less severe or demonstrate a 
delay in onset compared with the most severe mutations.    
TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h was also compared with different doses of TEZ monotherapy. For 
sweat chloride TEZ monotherapy at 100 mg and 150 mg qd appeared more effective than the 
combination at reducing sweat chloride. Inconsistences are acknowledged between the combination 
and the monocomponent tezacaftor and also between the TEZ monotherapy groups. Evaluation of 
treatment differences versus pooled placebo across cohorts demonstrated also inconsistency between 
sweat chloride and FEV1 data. Overall, however, the results for ppFEV1 demonstrated quite 
consistently a greater effect for TEZ/IVA combination with the highest response for TEZ 100 mg qd 
/IVA 150 mg q12h and a clinically relevant difference with TEZ 100 mg.  
Results of population PK/PD analyses suggested an exposure-response (E-R) relationship for change in 
ppFEV1 as a function of TEZ exposure at a fixed IVA dose of 150 mg q12h, and estimated TEZ 100 mg 
qd/IVA 150 mg q12 to be near the maximum achievable response. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 66/165 
 
 
 
 
 
The E-R analyses indicated that the combination has an added value over monotherapy of tezacaftor in 
ppFEV1 in subjects with the F/F genotype. The combining data from studies 101, 103 and 106, for E-R 
analysis, comparing TEZ monotherapy versus TEZ/IVA in combination was considered not valid, given 
that studies 103 and 106 lacked a TEZ monotherapy comparator arm and post-treatment washout data 
from TEZ/IVA treated patients, in order to provide additional response data for exposures similar to the 
TEZ 10 mg qd dose.  Therefore additional E-R analyses were provided in the 2nd RSI. In the re-
analysis, the results for ppFEV1 were confirmed: 44% greater median change from baseline ppFEV1 
with TEZ/IVA compared with TEZ (versus 60% difference in the previous analysis). The 95% CI was 
wide: -25% to 373%. The model predicted a within-group ppFEV1 response of 3.2 percentage points 
(95% CI: 2.2, 4.4) in Study 101, consistent with the observed within-group response of 3.4 
percentage points (95% CI: 2.7, 4.0) in study 106. The re-analysed E-R data for sweat chloride again 
demonstrate a greater reduction in sweat chloride with TEZ monotherapy versus TEZ/IVA. For sweat 
chloride, the TEZ/IVA sweat chloride response in Study 106 was under-predicted using the model 
developed on the data from Study 101, i.e.  -5.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -6.9,-3.4) whereas the 
improvement observed in Study 106 was -9.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -10.9, -8.9). Thus overall, the model, 
within the limitations, appears to be more accurate for FEV1 than sweat chloride. This is consistent 
with the known variability in measurements of sweat chloride.  
The interpretation of the results of study 101 is limited by the 4 week duration of the study.  
The effect of IVA in subjects with the F/F genotype was been investigated before (study 104). A small, 
not relevant difference in the adjusted mean absolute change from baseline for sweat chloride values 
of -2.87 mmol/L (P = 0.0384) has been observed.  
For the secondary pharmacology, potential QTc prolongation of tezacaftor has been evaluated in Study 
VX15-661-010 in 116 healthy volunteers. As the study had assay sensitivity, the results allow for a 
conclusion on QTc prolongation. As at all time point the treatments differences fell below the 
predefined 10 msec and normality can be assumed as the median and mean are almost equal for 
almost all time points, it is concluded that tezacaftor at supratherapeutic dose did not prolong the QTcF 
interval in healthy subjects. The conduct of a dedicated QTc study with only TEZ is considered justified 
because tezacaftor has only a modest effect on the exposure of IVA. Since IVA has been shown not to 
prolong the QTc interval at supratherapeutic doses of 450 mg q12h, the increased IVA exposure in 
combination with TEZ is not considered relevant with respect to the probability to influence the QTc. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In the pharmacodynamic investigation of tezacaftor monotherapy and TEZ/IVA combination, 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor showed a consistent positive effect on sweat chloride in the investigated subjects 
with CF homozygous for F508del or heterozygous F508del/G551D or heterozygous for F508del and a 
residual function mutation (F/RF).  Nevertheless, the inferior effect of TEZ/IVA compared with TEZ on 
sweat chloride in study 101 is not completely understood. There appears to be no sufficient reason to 
exclude the possibility that TEZ as monotherapy may have clinically relevant pharmacodynamic 
activity, particularly when there are also discrepancies within the in vitro data and there is evident 
complexity in the mechanisms involved in correcting the CFTR function. The results of exposure-
response modelling, submitted to support clinical superiority of TEZ/IVA over TEZ are limited, since the 
model appears to be more accurate for FEV1 than sweat chloride, but there are limitations for 
interpretation because of the very wide confidence intervals around the predicted responses. Please 
refer to section 2.5.

The pharmacokinetics of tezacaftor and ivacaftor has been sufficiently investigated, although some 
concerns remain to be resolved via post-authorisation measures, related to special patient 
populations/pharmacogenetics and drug-drug interactions.  
The CHMP considers the following recommendations necessary to address the issues related to 
pharmacology: 
• 
The Applicant should either provide the CYP3A4 genotype of the patients included in the 
already submitted clinical studies, followed by further analysis of potential relationship between 
TEZ and IVA exposure (AUC, Cmax and Ctrough) and genotype, or provide additional in vivo 
data in healthy subjects, comparing exposure (AUC, Cmax and Ctrough) to TEZ and IVA in 
patients with CYP3A4*22 genotype and subjects with CYP3A4 wild-type phenotype. The final 
study report should be submitted by 30 April2019. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The TEZ/IVA clinical package comprises 6 clinical studies in total: two 2 dose finding studies, three 
placebo-controlled phase 3 efficacy and safety studies and one long term open label study evaluating 
safety and efficacy. Phase 2 PD study (study 101) is handled as a dose ranging study and is described 
in this section. The development programme for CF in patients aged 12 years and older enrolled a 
different patient population per clinical study: 
•  Study 106: subjects homozygous for F508del (F/F)  
•  Study 108: subjects heterozygous for F508del and a residual function mutation (F/RF).  
•  Study 107: subjects heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function mutation that is 
nonresponsive to TEZ and/or IVA (F/MF).  
•  Study 110:  subjects homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and who 
participated in Studies 103, 106, 107, 108, 109, 111, or other Vertex Pharmaceuticals 
Incorporated (Vertex) studies investigating TEZ in combination with IVA.  
Studies 106 and 108 are the key efficacy studies supporting the proposed indication. Study 110 is the 
extension study and is still ongoing; the results of an interim analysis were submitted.  
Study 107 was prematurely stopped based on a prespecified futility analysis when approximately 50% 
of subjects completed the study.  
As referred to in the introductory section, the Applicant has communicated that Study 109 in 
F508del/gating patients failed to meet its primary endpoint and therefore clinical superiority for 
TEZ/IVA versus IVA cannot be concluded. The applicant removed the gating mutations from the 
claimed indication and product information during the assessment procedure. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Two Phase 2 studies VX11-661-101 (Study 101) and VX13-661-103 (Study 103) evaluated different 
doses TEZ monotherapy and TEZ/IVA combination therapy. 
•  Study 101 was a randomized, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study that 
evaluated TEZ and TEZ/IVA at multiple dose levels in adult subjects with F/F genotype and in

•  Study 103 was a multicenter, 2-part study in subjects 18 years of age or older with CF, 
homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. 
In both studies, the primary objectives were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and the secondary 
objectives to evaluate the efficacy (assessed by percent predicted FEV1 [ppFEV1] and Cystic Fibrosis 
Questionnaire-Revised [CFQ-R] Respiratory domain), PD and PK of TEZ and TEZ/IVA. 
CF patients 18 years or older with the F/F genotype 
Increases in ppFEV1 for the VX-661 monotherapy groups were variable and not dose-dependent. The 
increases for the VX-661/IVA groups were dose-dependent, with the highest increase for the proposed 
dose TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h. The group that showed the greatest improvement in absolute 
change in ppFEV1 compared to placebo was TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h  (3.89 %, P = 0.0101). 
No additional benefit was observed at the higher TEZ dose of 150 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h (ppFEV1 
3.75 %; P = 0.0125), see table below. These results were consistent with the Phase 2/3 PK/PD 
analysis showing that exposures observed with the clinical dose of TEZ (100 mg qd) were on the flat 
part of dose-response curve.  
Table 9 Results for ppFEV1: Absolute Change From Baseline Through Day 28 (Percentage 
Points) by MMRM, Full Analysis Set (Groups 1 Through 5) 
The within-group LS mean for average absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 12 in 
study 103 was 3.0 % (95% CI: 0.4, 5.5; P = 0.0226) for TEZ 100 mg/IVA 150 mg,  0.9 % (95% CI: -
3.1, 5.0; P = 0.6437) for TEZ 50 mg/IVA 150 mg, and 0.9 % (95% CI: -1.7, 3.5; P = 0.4801) for 
Overall Placebo. The LS mean treatment difference for TEZ 100 mg/IVA 150 mg versus Overall Placebo 
was 2.1 % (95% CI: -1.5, 5.7; P = 0.2536). An alternative regimen with the same total daily dose of 
TEZ was also evaluated in Studies 101 and 103 (TEZ 50 mg q12h/ IVA 150 mg q12h), but resulted in a 
lower mean change in ppFEV1 versus placebo. The results of study 101 and Study 103 are presented 
in the following table:

Dosing in adolescents 
The use of the adult dosing regimen in subjects with CF who are 12 to 17 years of age in the Phase 3 
studies was based on equivalence of severity of disease and allometric scaling of doses. Both TEZ and 
IVA are predominantly eliminated by metabolism via the CYP3A4/5 pathway. The maturity of the CYP 
enzymes in adolescents is similar to adults, and thus metabolism of TEZ and IVA are expected to be 
similar in adolescents and adults. Based on the historical data on weight and age in subjects with CF 
from the IVA Phase 3 program and the US CF Foundation Registry, weights in the adolescent 
population are only slightly lower than those of the adult CF population. No dose adjustment is thus 
needed.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Studies 106 and 108 are the core efficacy studies supporting the proposed indication. Study 106 
investigated the efficacy of TEZ/IVA in subjects homozygous for F508del (F/F), while Study 108 
investigated it in subjects heterozygous for F508del and a residual function mutation (F/RF).

Design 
Table 12 Design of pivotal studies 106 and 108 for Symkevi 
Study Participants 
Key inclusion criteria were for both studies, aged 12 years or older and FEV1 ≥40% and ≤ 90% of 
predicted normal for age, sex, and height. In study 106 participants were to be homozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR mutation, while in study 108 the patients were heterozygous for F508del and a mutation 
that results in RF of the CFTR protein (F/RF). Diagnoses of CF had to be confirmed, in study 106 by a 
sweat chloride value ≥60 mmol/L, while in study 108, by a sweat chloride value ≥60 mmol/L OR if the 
sweat chloride value was <60 mmol/L, documented evidence of chronic sinopulmonary disease.  
Key exclusion criteria for Studies 106 and 108 decreased potential confounders of study endpoint 
evaluations. The main exclusion criteria were similar in both trials:  
•  Abnormal liver function defined as any 2 or more of the following: ≥3 x upper limit of normal 
(ULN) aspartate transaminase (AST), ≥3 x ULN alanine transaminase (ALT), ≥3 x ULN gamma-
glutamyl transferase (GGT), ≥3 x ULN alkaline phosphatase (ALP), or ≥2 x ULN total bilirubin 
•  Abnormal liver function defined as any increase of ≥5 x ULN AST or ALT 
•  Abnormal renal function defined as glomerular filtration rate ≤50 mL/min/1.73 m2 (calculated 
by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study Equation) for subjects ≥18 years old and 
≤45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (calculated by the Counahan-Barratt equation) for subjects aged 12 to 
17 years (inclusive)

•  An acute upper or lower respiratory infection, PEx, or changes in therapy (including antibiotics) 
for pulmonary disease within 28 days before Day 1 (first dose of study drug) 
•  A 12-lead ECG demonstrating QTc >450 msec at screening.  
•  Colonization with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status (e.g., 
Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia dolosa, and Mycobacterium abscessus)

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint in studies 106 and 108 was absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1.  
Table 14 Efficacy Endpoints in Phase 3 Studies 106 and 108 
BMI: body mass index; CRQ-R: Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised; FE-1: fecal elastase-1; IRT: immunoreactive 
trypsinogen; PEx: pulmonary exacerbation; ppFEV1: percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
Note: Key secondary endpoints are the endpoints that are part of the testing strategy and hence controlled for Type 
1 error rate. 
For the F/RF population, endpoints that are expected to require longer than 8 weeks of therapy to 
determine a treatment effect were included as study 108 assessments and evaluated with additional 
long-term data in Study 110 (i.e., pulmonary exacerbations [PEx], body mass index [BMI], and 
weight). Spirometry was performed pre-bronchodilator according to ATS standard in compliance with 
withholding of bronchodilators. For adolescents, the standards of Hankinson and Wang applied. For the 
CFQ-R 3 different versions of CFQ-R forms were used: 
● CFQ-R for Children Ages 12 and 13 version had a total of 35 questions to form 8 domains.  
● CFQ-R for Adolescents and Adults version (subjects 14 years old and older) had a total of 50 
questions to form 12 domains.  
● CFQ-R for Parents/Caregivers version (subjects 13 years old and younger) had a total of 44 
questions to form 11 domains.  
Pulmonary exacerbation is defined as a clinical deterioration in respiratory status necessitating a 
change in antibiotic therapy (IV, inhaled, or oral) for any 4 or more of the following signs or 
symptoms: change in sputum; new or increased haemoptysis; increased cough; increased dyspnoea;

malaise, fatigue, or lethargy; temperature above 38°C (equivalent to approximately 100.4°F); 
anorexia or weight loss; sinus pain or tenderness; change in sinus discharge; change in physical 
examination of the chest; decrease in lung function by at least 10%; or radiographic changes 
indicative of pulmonary infection. 
Sample size 
Study VX14-661-106  
The study was powered for both the primary endpoint (absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1) and 
a secondary endpoint of clinical interest (relative risk of PExs). The primary efficacy endpoint was the 
absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24. The null hypothesis to be tested was that 
the mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24 was the same for TEZ/IVA and 
placebo groups. Assuming a common SD of 8% in each treatment group, a sample size of 220 subjects 
in each treatment group was to have at least 90% power to detect a treatment difference of 2.5% in 
ppFEV1 between treatment groups, using a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. If the above null 
hypothesis was rejected, the efficacy of TEZ/IVA was considered established. 
Assuming the PEx rate for placebo was 0.5 events in 24 weeks, with 220 subjects in each treatment 
group, the power to detect a 40% reduction in the PEx rate in the active arm versus the placebo arm 
was approximately 92%. The power to detect a 33% reduction in the PEx rate was about 78%. This 
power calculation was based on an R simulation with 10000 replications. To adjust for a 10% dropout, 
a total sample size of approximately 490 subjects was needed 
Study VX14-661-108 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the absolute change in ppFEV1 from study baseline to the average 
of the Week 4 and Week 8 measurements in each Treatment Period. The null hypotheses to be tested 
was that the mean absolute change from study baseline in ppFEV1 to the average of the Week 4 and 
Week 8 measurements was the same for (i) TEZ/IVA and placebo; and (ii) IVA monotherapy and 
placebo. 
Assuming an SD of 7 percentage points, 30 subjects per sequence were needed to have at least 90% 
power to detect a 3 percentage point treatment difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo when the 
mean values of the primary endpoint were being compared. A 2-sided significance level of 0.05 was 
used in the sample size calculations. Accounting for the testing strategy, the proposed sample size 
yielded approximately an 85% chance of observing a statistically significant difference between IVA 
monotherapy and placebo for the primary endpoint, under the assumption that IVA monotherapy is 
also 3 percentage points better than placebo. The sample size estimate was based on 10,000 
simulation runs with an incomplete block design assuming no dropouts. In the simulation, the 
correlation between responses to the 2 treatments within a subject was assumed to be zero. After 
adjusting for an assumed dropout rate of 10%, the sample size was increased to 34 subjects per 
sequence (204 total subjects). 
Randomisation 
Study VX14-661-106  
Approximately 490 subjects (245 per arm) who meet eligibility criteria will be stratified by age at 
Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18 years of age), sex (male versus female), and percent predicted FEV1 
severity determined during the Screening Period (<70 versus ≥70), and then randomized (1:1) to

either TEZ/IVA or placebo. An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used for randomization 
following a list of randomization codes generated by a designated vendor. 
Study VX14-661-108 
Subjects who met the eligibility criteria were randomized (1:1:1:1:1:1) to 1 of the 6 treatment 
sequences. Randomization was stratified by age at the Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18 years of age), 
FEV1 severity (determined at the Screening Visit; <70% versus ≥70% predicted), and type of RF 
mutation on the second CFTR allele (Class V non-canonical splice mutation versus Classes II to IV RF 
mutation). An interactive web response system (IWRS) was used to assign subjects to treatment and 
to ensure enrolment of at least 25% of subject with Classes II to IV RF mutations.  
Blinding (masking) 
Study VX14-661-106  
This is a double-blind study. The blinded data review before database lock is considered acceptable 
(ICH E9, section 7).  
Study VX14-661-108 
This was a double-blind study. Blinding measures are considered sufficient to have the study team 
blinded, although if individual physicians in the trial may have known the allocation based on 
spirometry, sweat chloride, FE-1 and IRT results. However, the treatment discontinuation is very low 
(at least 96.3% completed treatment in both periods, see subject disposition), so this is considered not 
to have impacted the results.  
Statistical methods 
Models 
Primary, key secondary, and other secondary efficacy endpoints that were continuous variables 
measured repeatedly were analysed based on a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) in 
Study 106. Primary, key secondary and other secondary efficacy endpoints that were continuous 
variables were analysed based on a mixed-effects model (MEM) in Study 108. 
Endpoints that were anticipated to demonstrate rapid onset (i.e., ppFEV1, CFQ-R) were assessed 
"through" the final treatment period assessment in order to incorporate all assessments while on 
treatment. Endpoints which were anticipated to demonstrate a more gradual onset (e.g., BMI, weight) 
were assessed "at" the final treatment period assessment. All efficacy analyses were also summarized 
for each time point of assessment. 
Testing Approach 
Study 106: A hierarchical fixed-sequence testing strategy was used to control the overall type I error 
rate of 0.05 for the primary and key secondary endpoints. After the primary endpoint, the key 
secondary endpoints were tested in the following order: relative change from baseline in ppFEV1, 
number of PEx, absolute change from baseline in BMI at Week 24, and absolute change from baseline 
in CFQ-R through Week 24. 
Study 108: To control the overall Type I error rate with multiple treatment comparisons (TEZ/IVA 
versus placebo, and IVA versus placebo) for both primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, a 
gatekeeping approach was used where statistical significance could be claimed for the key secondary 
Assessment report

Page 76/165 
 
 
 
 
 
endpoint (CFQ-R respiratory domain) only if the primary endpoint (absolute change in ppFEV1) 
achieved statistical significance, and statistical significance of IVA versus placebo could be claimed only 
if TEZ/IVA versus placebo for the same endpoint was significant. Each of the hypothesis tests defined 
within the testing hierarchies was conducted at the significance level (alpha) of 0.05 (2-sided). 
As Study 108 was a 2-period cross-over design, carryover effect and treatment-by-period interaction 
for the primary analysis were assessed. Carryover effect for the primary analysis was assumed to be 
negligible due to the adequately long washout period of 8 weeks. Based on the results from the model 
for the primary analysis and the other sensitivity analyses, no statistical evidence suggested that there 
was a carryover effect. 
Results

Recruitment 
Study 106 was conducted at 91 sites in the US, Canada, and Europe. Study period was from 30 
January 2015 (date first eligible subject signed the informed consent form) up to 20 January 2017 
(date last subject completed the last visit). Study 108 was conducted at 81 sites in North America, 
Europe, Israel, and Australia. Study period was from 27 March 2015 (date first eligible subject signed 
the informed consent form) up to 16 February 2017 (date last subject completed the last visit).  
Conduct of the study 
The Study 106 protocol was amended 3 times, see below. All the changes are considered not to have 
affected the size and interpretation of effects substantially.

Added washout requirements for subjects who have previously used a 
commercially available CFTR modulator. 
Added detail about the criteria used to determine eligible CTFR mutations;

Version 3.0  
will not be included in the FAS because they are not in the target population 
Subjects whose screening genotype results do not confirm study eligibility 
for the study. 
10 June 2016 
Reduced the sample size from 300 subjects (50 subjects per sequence) to 
approximately 204 subjects (34 subjects per sequence), based on the 
change to the testing strategy (see below). The revised power calculations 
with a sample size of 204 subjects are provided. 
Moved the relative change in ppFEV1 from a key secondary endpoint to a 
secondary endpoint and removed from the testing hierarchy because 
relative change provides similar information to the absolute change in 
ppFEV1 (the primary endpoint). 
Specified that the annualized duration of hospitalizations due to PExs will be 
calculated using data up to Week 8 in each Treatment Period. 
Removed responder analysis for ppFEV1 because it is difficult to interpret in 
the absence of an identified and validated minimal clinically important 
difference in the ppFEV1. 
Removed the statistical comparison of TEZ/IVA and IVA monotherapy from 
the testing strategy to be consistent with the primary objective. The testing 
strategy was accordingly replaced with a single, stepwise hierarchical 
approach. 
After the database lock, a post-hoc analysis to investigate cross-over effects were performed: change 
of study baseline to average of week 4 and 8 in period 1 and in period 2. The major amendments are 
acceptable. 
Baseline data 
Subject demography and baseline characteristics, including baseline lung function and CFQ-R 
Respiratory Domain, were well-balanced across treatment groups and were generally similar in Studies 
106 and 108, as stated in the below table.  
Subjects with the F/F genotype (Study 106) typically have CF that has an earlier onset and is more 
rapidly progressive than with subjects with the F/RF genotype (Study 108). Consistent with this, the 
Study 106 population versus the Study 108 population was younger (mean age of 26.3 versus 34.8 
years), had higher mean baseline sweat chloride values (100.9 versus 69.9 mmol/L), had lower mean 
BMI (21.04 versus 24.22 kg/m2), had higher use of inhaled antibiotics (58.7% versus 31.2%).

Study 106: the number of obese and undernourished subjects was similar across treatment groups, 
both for adolescents (<18 years of age) and for adults (≥ 18 years of age). Approximately 30% of the 
all patients was undernourished (defined as BMI < 18.5 Kg/m2), while for adolescents approximately 
70% were undernourished. Approximately 98% of subjects in Study 106 had exocrine pancreatic 
insufficiency and up to 97% of these subjects received pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.  
Study 108: baseline characteristics for ppFEV1, CFQ-R respiratory domain score, and sweat chloride 
concentrations were compared for period 1 and 2 period using paired-t-tests. The within-subject 
differences of Period 1 and Period 2 baselines in ppFEV1, CFQ-R respiratory domain score, and sweat 
chloride were consistently negligible across treatments and support the lack of carryover effect. 
Overall, 30% of the patients received pancreatic enzymes in a population of patients in which 13.5% 
were identified as pancreatic insufficient defined as faecal elastase-1 concentration <200 μg/g).  
Numbers analysed

 The LS mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups was 4.0 % (95% CI: 3.1, 
4.8) and was statistically significant in favour of TEZ/IVA (P<0.0001).

Key Secondary Efficacy Variables 
Relative Change From Baseline in Percent Predicted FEV1 Through Week 24: The key secondary 
endpoint of relative change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24 analysed by MMRM was met. 
The LS mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups was 6.8% (95% CI: 5.3, 
8.3) and was statistically significant in favour of TEZ/IVA (P<0.0001). Within group, the LS mean 
relative change in ppFEV1 through Week 24 was statistically significant in the TEZ/IVA group (6.3%; 
P<0.0001) but not in the placebo group (-0.5%; P = 0.3823). 
Number of Pulmonary Exacerbations Through Week 24: The number of pulmonary exacerbations 
(PExs) through Week 24 was analysed using a negative binomial regression model. The model-based 
event rate of PExs was in the TEZ/IVA group 0.64 events per year and in the placebo group 0.99 
events per year. The rate reduction in PExs was statistically significant in favour of TEZ/IVA as 
assessed by the rate ratio of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.88; P = 0.0054). In addition, treatment with 
TEZ/IVA was associated with lower event rate per year of pulmonary exacerbations requiring IV 
antibiotic therapy (0.32) compared to placebo (0.59). The rate ratio versus placebo was 0.53 (95%CI: 
0.34, 0.82; P = 0.0042). 
Absolute Change From Baseline in BMI at Week 24: The absolute change from baseline in BMI at Week 
24 was analysed using an MMRM model. At Week 24, the within-group improvement was statistically 
significant for the TEZ/IVA group (P = 0.0004) and for the placebo group (P = 0.0134). Although the 
LS mean absolute change from baseline in BMI was numerically greater in the TEZ/IVA group (0.18 
kg/m2) than in the placebo group (0.12 kg/m2) at Week 24, the treatment difference was not 
statistically significant (P = 0.4127). Therefore, the hierarchical multiple testing procedure was 
stopped.

Absolute Change From Baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score through Week 24: The last key 
secondary endpoint in the testing hierarchy was a self-reported measure of respiratory symptoms, the 
CFQ-R respiratory domain score, analysed by MMRM through Week 24. The pooled CFQ-R “Children 
Ages 12 and 13” and “Adolescents and Adults” versions were used for the analysis. 
Treatment with TEZ/IVA resulted in improvements in the CFQ-R respiratory domain score. Within 
group, the LS mean absolute change from baseline in the pooled CFQ-R respiratory domain score 
through Week 24 was 5.0 points (P<0.0001) in the TEZ/IVA group and -0.1 points (P = 0.8889) in the 
placebo group. The LS mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups in pooled 
CFQ-R respiratory domain score was 5.1 points (95% CI: 3.2, 7.0; nominal P<0.0001). 
Other Secondary Efficacy Variables 
Time-to-First Pulmonary Exacerbation Through Week 24: TEZ/IVA reduced the risk of PEx compared to 
placebo, with a hazard ratio of 0.637 (P = 0.0069). The 75th percentile of event-free time of the time-
to-first PEx was 14.6 weeks in the placebo group and 22.6 weeks in the TEZ/IVA group. The hazard 
ratio was 0.553 (0.357, 0.857; P= 0.0080) for time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation requiring IV 
antibiotic therapy. The estimated week 24 event-free rate (95% CI) was 0.87 (0.82, 0.91) in the 
TEZ/IVA group and 0.79 (0.73, 0.83) in the placebo group. Number of planned hospitalisations were 7 
and 17 for TEZ/IVA and placebo respectively resulting in an observed event rate of 0.06 vs 0.13. For 
unplanned hospitalisations, the number of hospitalisations was 10 and 19 for TEZ/IVA and placebo 
respectively with an event rate of 0.08 vs 0.15.  
Subgroup analysis 
In the age group < 18 years,  the LS mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo 
groups for the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24 was 3.9 % (95% CI: 2.2, 
5.5) and was statistically significant in favour of TEZ/IVA (P<0.0001). In the age group ≥ 18 years,  
the LS mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups was 4.0 % (95% CI: 3.1, 
4.9; P<0.0001).  
Consistent and significant effect in ppFEV1 favouring TEZ/IVA compared to placebo were observed 
across all prespecified subgroups: age (<18 or ≥18 years old), sex, baseline lung function (ppFEV1 
<40, ≥40 to <70, or ≥70 %), region (North America or Europe), P. aeruginosa infection, and baseline 
use of common CF medications (i.e., azithromycin and inhaled antibiotics, bronchodilators, 
corticosteroids, and hypertonic saline).

Study VX14-661-108 
The efficacy analysis was performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS): all randomized subjects who carry 
the intended CFTR allele mutation and have received at least 1 dose of study drug. Among the 248 
subjects who were randomly assigned to treatment, 246 subjects received at least 1 dose of study 
drug in Period 1 (81 received placebo, 81 received IVA, and 84 received TEZ/IVA). One subject 
assigned to placebo and 1 subject assigned to IVA in Period 1 were later deemed to be screen failures 
and did not receive treatment. In Period 2, 81 subjects received placebo, 76 subjects received IVA, 
and 78 subjects received TEZ/IVA. Across both periods, 162 subjects received at least 1 dose of 
placebo, 157 subjects received at least 1 dose of IVA, and 162 subjects received at least 1 dose of 
TEZ/IVA.

Table 22 Subject Disposition, All Subjects Set 
Overall, 234 (95.1%) of 246 of subjects in the safety set completed the treatment regimen in both 
periods. Eleven subjects (6 in the placebo group, 3 in the IVA group, and 2 in the TEZ/IVA group) 
withdrew from the study (10 subjects during Period 1 or during washout and 1 subject during Period 
2). One additional subject who completed treatment with TEZ/IVA in Period 1 did not receive treatment 
in Period 2 but completed all visits in Period 2. 
In Period 1, 243 (98.8%) of the 246 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug completed 
treatment; 3 (1.2%) subjects (2 in the placebo group and 1 in the TEZ/IVA group) prematurely 
discontinued study drug and withdrew from the study. Seven other subjects discontinued from the 
study during the 8-week Washout Period between Period 1 and Period 2. In Period 2, 235 subjects 
received at least 1 dose of study drug, and 234 (99.6%) subjects completed treatment; 1 (0.4%) 
subject in the IVA group prematurely discontinued treatment during Period 2. 
Overall, 227 (92.3%) subjects enrolled in the treatment cohort of the extension study, and no subjects 
enrolled in the observational cohort in the extension study (Study VX14-661-110).

A total of 14 subjects were identified who had IPDs. Subjects could have IPDs in more than 1 category. 
A review of the results for the subjects with IPs did not suggest that the IPDs had a clinically 
meaningful effect on the study conclusions. As most subjects completed treatment in both periods, 
subject demography and baseline characteristics in Period 2 were similar to those for Period 1. 
Primary endpoint 
Absolute Change From Study Baseline in ppFEV1 to the Average of Week 4 and Week 8: treatment 
with TEZ/IVA and IVA resulted in statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1 compared to placebo. 
The LS mean treatment difference versus placebo for absolute change in ppFEV1 from study baseline 
to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 was 6.8 % (95% CI: 5.7, 7.8; P<0.0001) for the TEZ/IVA group 
and 4.7 % (95% CI: 3.7, 5.8; P<0.0001) for the IVA group. TEZ/IVA treatment resulted in statistically 
significant improvement in ppFEV1 compared to IVA. The LS mean treatment difference for the 
absolute change in ppFEV1 from study baseline to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 was 2.1 % (95% 
CI: 1.2, 2.9; P<0.0001) in favour of TEZ/IVA.

Sensitivity Analysis for the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
A sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint was performed using an MMRM model with 
treatment, period, visit within period, treatment-by-visit interaction, and ppFEV1 at study baseline as 
the covariates. Using this model, the LS mean treatment difference for the TEZ/IVA group versus 
placebo for the absolute change from study baseline in ppFEV1 to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 
was 6.8 % (95% CI: 5.6, 8.0; P<0.0001). Treatment with TEZ/IVA also demonstrated statistically 
significant improvement in absolute change in ppFEV1 compared to IVA. The LS mean treatment 
difference for the IVA group versus placebo for the absolute change from study baseline in ppFEV1 to 
the average of Week 4 and Week 8 was 5.1 % (95% CI: 3.8, 6.3; P<0.0001) 
Key Secondary Efficacy Variable  
Absolute Change from Study Baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain to the Average of Week 4 and 
Week 8: The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for the CFQ-R respiratory domain score is 
4 points.  Treatment with TEZ/IVA and IVA resulted in statistically significant improvement in absolute 
change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score compared to placebo, and mean CFQ-R respiratory domain 
scores increased by more than 4 points in the TEZ/IVA and IVA groups. Compared to placebo, the LS 
mean treatment difference from study baseline to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 was 11.1 points 
(95% CI: 8.7, 13.6; P<0.0001) for TEZ/IVA and 9.7 points (95% CI: 7.2, 12.2; P<0.0001) for IVA.

Table 24 Linear Mixed Effects Model for Absolute Change From Study Baseline in CFQ-R 
Respiratory Domain to the Average of Week 4 and Week 8, Full Analysis Set 
The absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score was numerically greater in the TEZ/IVA group 
than the IVA group. The LS mean treatment difference for absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory 
domain from study baseline to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 was 1.4 points (95% CI: -1.0, 3.9; 
P = 0.2578), in favour of TEZ/IVA.  
Other Secondary Efficacy Variables 
Relative Change in ppFEV1 from Study Baseline to the Average of Week 4 and Week 8: Results for 
relative change in ppFEV1 were consistent with the result for the primary analysis. Treatment with 
TEZ/IVA and IVA resulted in improvement in relative change in ppFEV1 compared to placebo. The LS 
mean treatment difference versus placebo for the relative change in ppFEV1 from study baseline to the 
average of Week 4 and Week 8 was 11.4% (95% CI: 9.6, 13.2; P<0.0001) for TEZ/IVA and 8.1% 
(95% CI: 6.3, 9.9; P<0.0001) for IVA. The relative change in ppFEV1 was greater in TEZ/IVA than 
IVA. The LS mean treatment difference for the relative change in ppFEV1 from study baseline to the 
average of Week 4 and Week 8 was 3.3% in favour of TEZ/IVA (95% CI: 1.8, 4.8; P<0.0001) 
Treatment with TEZ/IVA and IVA reduced sweat chloride concentrations compared to placebo: The LS 
mean treatment difference versus placebo for the absolute change in sweat chloride from study 
baseline to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 was -9.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -11.7, -7.3; P<0.0001) for 
TEZ/IVA and -4.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -6.7, -2.3; P<0.0001) for IVA. The reduction in sweat chloride 
concentration was greater in TEZ/IVA than IVA. The LS mean treatment difference for the absolute 
change in sweat chloride from study baseline to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 was -5.1 mmol/L 
in favour of TEZ/IVA (95% CI: -7.0, -3.1; P<0.0001).

Additional Efficacy Variables and Other Endpoints 
•  Additional Spirometry Variables 
Analysis of additional lung function parameters, including (predose) FEV1, FVC, ppFVC, FEF25%-75%, 
ppFEF25%-75%, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ppFEV1/FVC ratio were also performed. Improvements were 
observed for both TEZ/IVA and IVA compared to placebo for all parameters. To evaluate changes in 
small airways, the effect on ppFEF25%-75% was analysed. The mean (SD) absolute change from 
study baseline to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 in ppFEF25%-75% was 7.8 % (10.6) in the 
TEZ/IVA group, 6.6 % (10.3) in the IVA group, and -0.1 % (7.9) in the placebo group. 
•  Analysis of Response in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain 
The MCID for the CFQ-R respiratory domain score is considered to be 4 points. The percentage of 
subjects who had an increase of at least 4 points was higher for TEZ/IVA and IVA compared to 
placebo. At the average of Week 4 and Week 8, the percentages of subjects who exceeded the 
improvement threshold was 65.2% in the TEZ/IVA group, 58.3% in the IVA group, and 32.9% in the 
placebo group. The odds ratio versus placebo was 7.418 (95% CI: 3.649, 15.080; P<0.0001) for 
TEZ/IVA, and 4.847 (95% CI: 2.447, 9.605; P<0.0001) for IVA. The odds ratio for TEZ/IVA versus IVA 
was 1.530 (95% CI: 0.849, 2.759; P = 0.1562). 
•  Variables Related to BMI 
Increases in BMI and weight were observed in all treatment groups at Week 8. The mean absolute 
change from study baseline in BMI at Week 8 was 0.34 kg/m2 for TEZ/IVA, 0.47 kg/m2 for IVA, and 
0.18 kg/m2 for placebo. 
• 
Pulmonary Exacerbations 
PEx events occurred in 11 (6.8%) subjects in the TEZ/IVA group, 9 (5.8%) subjects in the IVA group, 
and 19 (11.8%) subjects in the placebo group. The estimated event rate of PEx was lower for TEZ/IVA 
(0.34 events per year) and IVA (0.29 events per year) than for placebo (0.63 events per year). 
Compared to placebo, the rate ratio was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.26, 1.13; P = 0.1031) for TEZ/IVA and 0.46 
(95% CI: 0.21, 1.01; P = 0.0532) for IVA. The rate ratio was 1.18 (95% CI: 0.49, 2.87; P = 0.7131) 
for TEZ/IVA compared to IVA.

Subgroup analysis  
Subgroup Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
For the FAS, subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint were performed using a model similar to that 
for the primary analysis, but included an additional covariate for the relevant grouping factor as well as 
a term for grouping factor by treatment interaction. All of the subgroup analyses demonstrated that 
TEZ/IVA and IVA treatment resulted in statistically significant improvement over placebo in mean 
absolute change from study baseline in ppFEV1 to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 regardless of 
age, baseline lung function, region, use of common CF medications, P. aeruginosa colonization, and RF 
mutation group (Class V non-canonical splice or Classes II to IV missense). Regarding gender, the 
treatment effect for TEZ/IVA versus IVA was greater in males (2.6 pp) compared with females (1.6 
pp). The subgroup analysis of sweat chloride and CFQ-R in males and females were consistent with the 
primary analysis.  For TEZ/IVA, the mean treatment differences for absolute change in ppFEV1 through 
the average of Week 4 and Week 8 compared to placebo ranged from 4.4 (95% CI:1.1, 7.8) to 12.0 
(95% CI:9.3, 14.8) % across subgroups (P<0.05). For IVA, the mean treatment differences for 
absolute change in ppFEV1 to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 compared to placebo ranged from 
3.6 % (95% CI: 1.9, 5.2) to 8.0 % (95% CI: 5.2, 10.7) across subgroups (P<0.05).

The comparison of TEZ/IVA and IVA for ppFEV1 was in favour of TEZ/IVA, overall and for the majority 
of predefined subgroups. Overall, the LS mean treatment difference for the TEZ/IVA group versus IVA 
for the absolute change from study baseline in ppFEV1 to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 was 2.1 
percentage points (95% CI: 1.2, 2.9; P <0.0001).  
On request of the CHMP, box-and-whisker plots with jitters were submitted by the applicant during the 
assessment. The plots demonstrated the variability in response between subjects with the same 
mutation, see below.

Treatment Group 
Mixed Model 
At request of the CHMP, mixed models to describe the between- and within- mutation variance and to 
investigate the possibility to predict generalisation to mutations that were not enrolled were also 
submitted.  
The linear mixed effect model included the absolute change from study baseline in ppFEV1 or sweat 
chloride to the average of the Week 4 and Week 8 measurements as the dependent variable, 
treatment as a fixed effect, and mutation as a random effect. Compared to placebo, improvements in 
ppFEV1 were larger for TEZ/IVA and IVA. In addition, improvements with TEZ/IVA were larger than 
with IVA. Placebo behaved as expected for all mutations, with estimated mean changes from baseline 
for ppFEV1 close to 0 percentage points. The results based on the linear mixed effects model are 
consistent with the pre-planned primary analysis model.  Furthermore, the results of the model 
suggest a consistent treatment benefit of TEZ/IVA for all individual mutations in the proposed 
indication. The between-mutation variability is quite small (1.7 percentage points, SD = 1.3) compared 
with the within-mutation variance (37.3 percentage points, SD = 6.1).  
Based on the linear mixed model, the range of mean responses for mutations that were eligible but not 
enrolled in Study 108 were predicted. For subjects treated with TEZ/IVA, the range of the mean 
increase for a mutation is 5.1 to 8.5 percentage points based on the model. For any mutation that was 
eligible for Study 108, the mean response is predicted to be 4.6 percentage points or greater for 
TEZ/IVA with 95% probability. For IVA, the mean response for a randomly selected mutation would be 
2.7 percentage points or greater with 95% probability. For sweat chloride for subjects treated with

TEZ/IVA, the range of the mean improvement for a mutation is -2.6 to -28.5 mmol/L based on the 
model.  
Ancillary analyses 
In the age group < 18 years,  the LS mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo 
groups for the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24 was 3.9 percentage points 
(95% CI: 2.2, 5.5) and was statistically significant in favour of TEZ/IVA (P<0.0001). In the age group 
≥ 18 years,  the LS mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups it was 4.0 
percentage points (95% CI: 3.1, 4.9; P<0.0001). Consistent and significant effects in ppFEV1 
favouring TEZ/IVA compared to placebo were observed across all pre-specified subgroups: age (<18 or 
≥18 years old), sex, baseline lung function (ppFEV1 <40, ≥40 to <70, or ≥70 percentage points), 
region (North America or Europe), P. aeruginosa infection, and baseline use of common CF medications 
(i.e., azithromycin and inhaled antibiotics, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and hypertonic saline).

Notes 
a The treatment difference for the LS mean absolute change from baseline in BMI 
was not statistically significant (P = 0.4127). Therefore, the hierarchical multiple 
testing procedure was stopped. 
Analysis description  Secondary analysis 
As other secondary efficacy endpoints, time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation, 
absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline, absolute change in BMI z-score 
from baseline (in subjects <20 years of age at time of screening) and absolute 
change in body weight from baseline were investigated. They all showed a positive 
effect for TEZ/IVA compared to placebo.  
Ancillary analysis 
The Forest Plot for the subgroups analysed, shows a consistent beneficial effect for 
TEZ/IVA compared to placebo. The lowest point estimate is 3.5 difference in the 
group of patients with low baseline FEV1 (ppFEV1 < 40%) and female sex.

Analysis description  Secondary analysis 
As other secondary efficacy endpoints, relative Change in ppFEV1, absolute 
change in  sweat chloride concentrations, additional Spirometry Variables, 
BMI and pulmonary exacerbations were measured.  
They all showed a positive effect for TEZ/IVA compared to placebo, while 
relative change in ppFEV1, sweat chloride and the additional spirometry 
variables showed a positive effect for TEZ/IVA compared to IVA. 
Ancillary analyses:   
The Forest Plot for the subgroups analysed, shows a consistent beneficial 
effect for TEZ/IVA compared to placebo. The lowest point estimate is 4.4 
difference in the group of patients with low baseline FEV1 (ppFEV1 < 40%). 
The highest results are observed in the group of age < 18 years (12.0), 
FEV1 ≥70% or no use of bronchodilator (8.3). 
The number of patients per specific RF mutation is very small. Nevertheless 
the effects observed are supportive with the overall effects except for the 
deletions F508del/D110H and F508del/E831X.  
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
No additional across analysis were performed. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The clinical studies were primarily based on the genetic mutation and analysed. Hence, the results are 
presented in the clinical studies. Clinical data for splice mutations were analysed as a subgroup for the 
primary endpoint of ppFEV1 and demonstrated a treatment effect compared to placebo of 7.4 % (95% 
CI: 6.0, 8.7; P <0.0001). The treatment effect for the splice mutation subgroup compared to IVA 
monotherapy was 1.9 % (95% CI: 0.8, 3.0; P = 0.0008), confirming the contribution of TEZ in this 
sub-population. 
Adolescents and adults were included together in the trials. Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint 
were done using a model similar to that for the primary analysis. On request of the CHMP, additional 
subanlyses in adolescents have been submitted also for study 110. The following results are based on 
MMRM analyses with the baseline defined as the last non-missing assessment before the first dose of 
TEZ/IVA in Study 110 for all treatment groups.   
Adolescent subjects with CF with F/F mutation from parent study 106: A total of 109 adolescent 
patients (< 18 years old) out of 459 patients were included in study 110, 55 patients previously 
treated with placebo (PBO-TEZ/IVA group)  and 54 previously treated with TEZ/IVA (TEZ/IVA group). 
The mean absolute change (SE) from baseline in ppFEV1 for subjects <18 years old was 5.3 (0.7) 
percentage points in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group and -0.8 (0.8) pp in the TEZ/IVA group. For subjects 
aged 18 years or older, the mean (SE) was 3.6 (0.5) pp and −0.3 (0.5) pp, respectively.  
In study 110, the mean absolute change (SE) from baseline in BMI-z value for subjects <18 years old 
was 0.10 (0.05) kg/m2 in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group and −0.04 (0.05) kg/m2 in the TEZ/IVA group. The 
mean (95%CI) absolute change in BMI for the overall population was 0.23 kg/m2 (0.06) and 0.00 
kg/m2 (0.06), respectively.  
In study 110, the mean absolute change (SE) from baseline in weight-z value for subjects <18 years 
old was 0.06 (0.04) kg in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group and −0.02 (0.04) kg in the TEZ/IVA group. The 
mean (95%CI) absolute change in weight for the overall population was 0.9 (0.2) kg and 0.2 (0.2) kg 
respectively.

Adolescent subjects with CF with F/RF mutation from parent study 108:  A total of 32 adolescent 
patients (< 18 years old) out of 226 patients were included in study 110, 14 patients previously 
treated with placebo (PBO-TEZ/IVA group), 8 patients previously treated with ivacaftor (IVA-TEZ/IVA 
group) and 10 previously treated with TEZ/IVA.  
Mean (SD) weight z-scores (provided for subjects less than 20 years of age at screening of the parent 
study) were 0.24 (1.42), -0.12 (1.11), and 0.22 (1.16) respectively and mean (SD) BMI z-scores were 
0.14 (1.26), -0.22 (1.03), and 0.03 (1.22)respectively at Study 110 baseline. At Study 110 baseline, 
the majority of subjects less than 18 years old with ppFEV1 below 70 were in the PBO-TEZ/IVA and 
IVA-TEZ/IVA groups (i.e., 57.1% and 62.5% vs. 40% in the TEZ/IVA group).  
The mean absolute change (SE) from baseline in ppFEV1 for subjects <18 years old was 7.2 (1.2) 
percentage points in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group and 1.6 (1.6) percentage points in the IVA-TEZ/IVA 
group 0.7 (1.5  pp in the TEZ/IVA group. For subjects aged 18 years or older, the mean (SE) change 
was 4.4 (0.7) pp and 2.5 (0.7) pp and 0.0 (0.7), respectively.  
In study 110, the mean absolute change (SE) from baseline in BMI-z value for subjects <18 years old 
was 0.04 (0.05) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group and -0.13 (0.07) in the IVA-TEZ/IVA group and 0.16 (0.06) 
in the TEZ/IVA group. The mean absolute change (SE) from baseline in weight-z value for subjects 
<18 years old was not provided.  
Overall, subgroup analyses showed statistically significant and consistent changes in ppFEV1 
regardless of age, sex, baseline lung function, geographic region, use of common CF medications, and 
P. aeruginosa colonization. There were limited data from elderly patient (6 patients ≥65 years of age 
at screening in study 108) as reflected in the SmPC. 
Supportive studies 
Two supportive studies are submitted in the addition to the two pivotal studies and two dose finding 
studies: Study VX08-770-104 (Study 104) and Study VX14-661-110 (Study 110). 
Study 104 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, study that evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of IVA monotherapy in subjects with the F/F genotype. This study was already 
submitted as a variation in the ivacaftor dossier.  
Study 110 is an open label uncontrolled extension study to support durability of efficacy and safety in 
subjects who complete Studies 103, 106, 107, 108 and 109. Study 110 is of importance as it provides 
long term data on efficacy and safety. The study is still ongoing and the results of an interim analysis 
are submitted.  
The results of a third study (Study VX14-661-107) are also submitted, but this study was not 
considered a fully supportive study by the Applicant, because it was prematurely stopped because 
results of a planned interim analysis met the pre-defined futility rule.  During the evaluation, results 
from Study VX14-661-109 were also provided.

Study VX14-661-110: open label extension study. Interim analysis 1 (70% of the enrolled 
patients analysed) 
Study 110 is an open-label rollover study that enrolled subjects from the Phase 2 and 3 studies of 
TEZ/IVA (studies 103, 106, 107, 108, 109, 111, or other Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Vertex) 
studies investigating TEZ in combination with IVA). 
Study 110 has a Treatment Cohort and an Observational Cohort. Subjects were eligible to enrol in the 
Treatment Cohort if they completed study drug treatment in the previous study and met the eligibility 
criteria. Subjects in the Treatment Cohort receive TEZ/IVA for approximately 96 weeks. Subjects 
remained on their stable medication regimens for CF defined as the regimen subjects followed for at 
least 28 days before the first dose of study drug in Study 106 or 108. Subjects in the Observational 
Cohort did not receive study drug.  
IVA: ivacaftor; q12h: every 12 hours; qd: daily; TEZ: tezacaftor 
Notes: All subjects received a TEZ 100-mg/IVA 150-mg fixed-dose combination tablet qd in the morning and an IVA 
150-mg tablet qd in the evening. 
Figure 10 Study design VX14-661-110  
Main Inclusion Criteria  
1.  Male and female subjects 12 years of age and older with CF who are homozygous or 
heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation 
2.  The following criteria applied to the Treatment and Observational Cohorts:  
• 
Elected to enroll in the Treatment Cohort  
-  Completed study drug treatment during the Treatment Period in a parent study 
(Studies 103, 106, 107, 108, or 109), Study 111, or other Vertex studies investigating 
TEZ in combination with IVA (but not Studies 101, 112, and 113)  
-  Subjects who had study drug interruptions, but completed study visits up to the last 
scheduled visit of the Treatment Period were eligible. 
-  Subjects who had a study drug interruption at the last scheduled visit of the Treatment 
Period of the parent study, subjects who required interruption to be continued or 
initiated at Day 1 in Study 110, or subjects who resumed study drug in the parent 
study after a study drug interruption due to elevated transaminases but who did not 
complete at least 4 weeks of rechallenge with study drug (due to the timing of the 
rechallenge versus the time remaining in the Treatment Period of the parent study)

were required to meet eligibility criteria and to receive approval from the Vertex 
medical monitor in order to be enrolled into the Study 110 Treatment Cohort. 
•  Subjects re-enrolling in the Treatment Cohort met all of the following criteria: 
- 
Previously received at least 4 weeks of study drug before discontinuing Study 110 to 
participate in another qualified Vertex study, which was defined as a Vertex study of 
investigational CFTR modulators that allowed participation of subjects in Study 110. 
-  Completed the last required visit of another qualified Vertex study before or during the 
Returning Visit in Study 110. (If > 60 days from the Returning Visit in Study 110, 
approval of the medical monitor was required.) Subjects who discontinued Study 110 
to screen for another qualified Vertex study, and did not enroll into the other study, 
were eligible to re-enroll in Study 110.  
-  Subjects who discontinued Study 110 more than once to participate in another 
qualified Vertex study did not re-enroll in Study 110 a second time. 
•  Subjects entering the Observational Cohort met the following criteria: 
-  <18 years of age (age on the date of informed consent/assent in the parent study) 
-  Completed study drug treatment during the Treatment Period in a parent study 
(Studies 103, 106, 107, 108, or 109), Study 111, or in other parent Vertex studies 
investigating TEZ in combination with IVA (Note: Studies 101, 112, and 113 were not 
eligible parent studies), not elected for  the Study 110 Treatment Cohort;  
- 
subjects from Study 111 or in other parent Vertex studies investigating TEZ in 
combination with IVA), but did not meet eligibility criteria for enrollment into the 
Treatment Cohort 
Main Exclusion criteria and List of study prohibitions and cautions for food and medication were similar 
as for study 106 and study 108.  Commercially available CFTR modulators (Kalydeco and Orkambi) 
were prohibited from 30 days before screening through the end of each study. 
Efficacy evaluation 
The evaluation of the long-term efficacy of TEZ/IVA for subjects in the Treatment Cohort was a 
secondary objective; for efficacy assessment spirometry, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), CF 
questionnaire-revised (CFQ-R), 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12), and documentation of other 
events related to outcomes (e.g. pulmonary exacerbations [PEx]) were measured. Spirometry and 
pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) were defined as in parent clinical studies. Following additional 
instruction applied for CFQ-R for the age  
•  Subjects who were 12 and 13 years of age at Day 1 completed the CFQ-R Child version 
themselves, and their parents/caregivers completed the CFQ-R Parent version, on all visits, 
regardless of whether the subject subsequently turned 14 years of age during the study. 
•  Subjects who turned 14 years of age during their participation in the parent study and had 
their Day 1 Visit for Study 110 on the same day as the last parent study visit completed the 
CFQ-R per the parent protocol requirement. At Day 15 and all subsequent visits, these subjects 
completed the CFQ-R Adolescent/Adult version themselves.

•  Subjects 14 years of age and older at Day 1 who did not have their Day 1 Visit for Study 110 
on the same day as the last parent study visit completed the Adolescent/Adult version of the 
questionnaire themselves at all visits. 
Efficacy Analysis Sets 
Efficacy analysis sets in Study 110 were based on the parent study. The efficacy analysis sets were 
defined differently for PEx analysis and other efficacy analyses, following the same principles as 
specified in the integrated summary of efficacy (ISE) statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
The All Subjects Set: all subjects who enrolled or received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Study 
110 Treatment Cohort from parent Studies 103, 106, 107, and 108.  
Safety Set: all subjects within the All Subjects Set who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Study 
110. Percentages were calculated relative to the number of subjects in the Safety Set.

VX14-661-110 Study results 
For the F/F population, 459 subjects received TEZ/IVA in Study 110. Of these, 231 subjects switched 
from placebo in Study 106 to TEZ/IVA in Study 110 (PBO-TEZ/IVA group), and 228 subjects continued 
to receive TEZ/IVA (TEZ/IVA group). At the time of the IA, 14 subjects (6.1%) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA 
group and 8 subjects (3.5%) in the TEZ/IVA group had discontinued treatment. For the F/RF 
population, 222 subjects received TEZ/IVA in Study 110. Of these, 78 subjects received placebo in 
Study 108 Period 2 (PBO-TEZ/IVA group), 69 subjects received IVA in Study 108 Period 2 (IVA-
TEZ/IVA group), and 75 subjects received TEZ/IVA in Study 108 Period 2 (TEZ/IVA group). At the time 
of the IA, 3 subjects (1.4%) had discontinued treatment (1 subject in each group).  As of the IA1 data 
cut date, 870 subjects had been enrolled in Study 110 from 4 parent studies as follows: 462 (53.3%) 
subjects from Study 106, 223 (25.7%) subjects from Study 108, 159 (18.3%) subjects from Study 
107, and 23 (2.7%) subjects from Study 103. No subjects were enrolled in the Observational Cohort. 
Of the 867 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Study 110 (i.e., the Safety Set), 185 
(21.3%) prematurely discontinued treatment. The majority of discontinuations were due to the early 
termination of Study 107 for futility; 154 (17.8%) subjects discontinued treatment in Study 110 due to 
study termination by Sponsor. The percentages of subjects who discontinued treatment due to AE 
(0.7%) or discontinued the study due to AE (0.5%) were low.

Table 30 Subject Disposition (Study 110 Treatment Cohort), All Subjects Set 
Of the 222 subjects in the Study 108/110 ES, 3 (1.4%) subjects prematurely discontinued treatment, 
and no subjects discontinued treatment due to AE. Of the 459 subjects in the Study 106/110 ES, 22 
(4.8%) subjects prematurely discontinued treatment, and 4 (0.9%) subjects discontinued treatment 
due to AE. 
Study period was from 31 August 2015 (date first eligible subject signed the informed consent form) 
up to 06 March 2017 (data cut date of interim analysis).  The original protocol (v1.0, dated 19 May 
2015) was amended once.  
Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
The used baseline was the baseline measurements of the parent studies. Demographic and other 
baseline characteristics, including mean values and distributions, were similar across placebo/TEZ-IVA 
and active treatment/TEZ-IVA groups. In Study 106/110 Efficacy Set, the median age of subjects was 
25 years (range: 12, 64). A total of 51.6% of subjects were male. The majority of subjects had 
baseline ppFEV1 ≥40 to <70 (61.7%) or ≥70 to ≤90 (27.2%). Median BMI was 20.72 kg/m2 (range: 
13.67, 32.24). In study 108/110 Efficacy Set, the median age of subjects was 35 years (range: 12,

72). A total of 46.8% of subjects were male. The majority of subjects had baseline ppFEV1 ≥40 to <70 
(58.1%) or ≥70 to ≤90 (31.1 %). Median BMI was 23.53 kg/m2 (range: 15.19, 49.65). The most 
common medical history and prior medications used were consistent with the expectations for a 
population with CF.  
There were 26 IPDs prior to the cut-off date for IA1. None of these IPDs were considered to adversely 
affect subjects or the interpretation of study results. Twelve subjects had IPDs due to <80% study 
drug compliance; 7 subjects >70%, 3 subjects >50%, and 1 subject each had 48.8% and 4.7% 
compliance. The most common reasons were treatment interruption i.e., to take a prohibited 
concomitant medication, a non-LFT-related AE, or for both of these reasons. The subject with 48.8% 
compliance had treatment interruption due to renal failure. 
VX14-661-110 outcomes and estimation 
Absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline: At Week 24 of Study 110, in F/F subjects, the LS mean 
absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 was 3.1 % (95% CI: 1.9, 4.3; P<0.0001) in the TEZ/IVA 
group after 48 weeks treatment in total.  Subjects who went from placebo to TEZ/IVA the LS mean 
absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline in ppFEV1 was 4.5 % (95% CI: 3.3, 5.7; P<0.0001) in the 
PBO-TEZ/IVA group. For F/RF subjects who received TEZ/IVA in Study 108 Period 2, at Week 16, the 
LS mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 was 5.9 percentage points (95% CI: 4.1, 7.7; 
P<0.0001) in the IVA-TEZ/IVA group and 7.4 percentage points (95% CI: 5.6, 9.1; P<0.0001) in the 
TEZ/IVA group. For subjects in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group who received placebo in Period 2 of Study 108 
at Week 16 the LS mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline in ppFEV1 was 4.6 percentage 
points (95% CI: 2.9, 6.3; P <0.0001) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group. 
An additional increase in ppFEV1 was observed for subjects who received IVA in Study 108 Period 2 
and began receiving TEZ/IVA in Study 110 (see figure below); this increase in ppFEV1 from Study 108 
Week 8 was observed as early as Day 15 of Study 110, and the improvement in ppFEV1 from Study 
108 baseline was sustained at Week 16 (5.9 %; 95% CI: 4.1, 7.7; P<0.0001). The magnitude and 
trend of improvement in ppFEV1 observed in Study 110 in patients who received placebo in the parent 
study were similar to those observed for subjects who received TEZ/IVA in Studies 106 or 108.

Notes: The MMRM analysis for Study 110 analysis period is restricted to the last visit at which the total number of subjects was 
approximately 70% of subjects in the parent study (106 or 108) FAS.  
Study 106: During Study 106, the last non-missing measurement before the first dose of study drug in Study 106 was used to 
calculate the change from baseline. For subjects in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group, the last non-missing measurement before the first dose 
of study drug in Study 110 was used to calculate the change from baseline during study 110.  
Study 108: For both the Study 108 and 110 Analysis Periods, baseline was the most recent non-missing measurement before the 
first dose of study drug in Study 108. Treatment assignment in the period of Study 110 was based on assigned treatment in Period 2 
of Study 108. Study 108 Analysis Period includes Treatment Periods 1 and 2, and subjects were included in more than 1 treatment 
group during the Study 108 Analysis Period

Relative change in ppFEV1 from baseline 
Study 106/110 Efficacy Set 
The mean ppFEV1 showed a relative improvement in the TEZ/IVA group during Study 106, and this 
improvement was maintained through Week 24 in Study 110 (P<0.0001 at all time points in both 
studies). At Week 24 of Study 110, the LS mean relative change from baseline in ppFEV1 was 5.9% 
(95% CI: 3.7%, 8.0%; P<0.0001) in TEZ/IVA group. 
Subjects in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group who began receiving TEZ/IVA in Study 110 showed a relative 
improvement in ppFEV1 as early as Day 15 of Study 110, and the improvements in ppFEV1 were 
sustained through Week 24 (P<0.0001 at all time points in Study 110). At Week 24 of Study 110, the 
LS mean relative change from baseline in ppFEV1 was 8.8% (95% CI: 6.6%, 10.9%; P <0.0001) in 
the PBO-TEZ/IVA group. 
Study 108/110 Efficacy Set 
The mean ppFEV1 showed a consistent relative improvement in the IVA-TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA groups 
during Study 108, and this improvement was maintained (TEZ/IVA) or showed further increase (IVA-
TEZ/IVA) through Week 16 in Study 110 (P<0.0001 at all-time points in both studies). At Week 16 of 
Study 110, the LS mean relative change from baseline in ppFEV1 was 10.3% (95% CI: 7.2%, 13.3%; 
P <0.0001) in the IVA-TEZ/IVA group and 12.6% (95% CI: 9.7%, 15.5%; P <0.0001) in the TEZ/IVA 
group.  
Subjects in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group who received placebo in Period 2 of Study 108 showed a relative 
improvement in ppFEV1 as early as Day 15 of Study 110, and the improvements in ppFEV1 were 
sustained through Week 16 (P<0.0001 at all time points in Study 110). At Week 16 of Study 110, the 
LS mean relative change from baseline in ppFEV1 was 8.5% (95% CI: 5.6%, 11.3%; P <0.0001) in the 
PBO-TEZ/IVA group. 
Number of Pulmonary Exacerbations 
Subjects in the 106/110 PE analysis set (F/F population) who received TEZ/IVA in Study 106 
maintained a lower event rate per year of PEx (0.72) compared to the placebo group in Study 106 
(0.99). Subjects in the 106/110 PE analysis set who received placebo in Study 106 had lower event 
rate per year of PEx (0.58) in Study 110 compared to the placebo group in Study 106 (0.99). The 
event rate per year of PEx was similar to that of the TEZ/IVA group in Study 106. Subjects in the 
108/110 PE analysis set (F/RF population) who received TEZ/IVA in Study 108 had a lower PEx event 
rate per year in Study 110 (0.20) than during Study 108 (0.34). Subjects in the 108/110 PE analysis 
set who received placebo in Study 108 had a lower PEx event rate per year (0.34) in Study 110 than in 
the placebo group in Study 108 (0.63). The PEx event rate per year was similar to that of the TEZ/IVA 
group in Study 108. Subjects in 108/110 PE analysis set who received IVA in Study 108 had a low PEx 
event rate per year in Study 110 (0.39), see below.

108/110 PE Analysis Sets 
During the assessment, the applicant also submitted additional analysis of the pulmonary exacerbation 
rates of second interim analysis (IA2). The number of PExs was estimated using a negative binomial 
regression model. The PEx Analysis Period included all time that a given subject was on active 
treatment, which may have begun in either Study 106, Study 108 or Study 110. For patients with F/F 
mutation (study 106), the event rate of PEx was 0.64 events per year in the TEZ/IVA group and 0.99 
events per year in the placebo group. For IA1 and IA2, the PEx event rate was 0.72 events per year. 
In Study 108, the PEx event rate was for the TEZ/IVA group 0.34 events per year and for the placebo

group 0.63 events per year. At the time of IA2 of Study 110, the PEx event rate was 0.22 events per 
year at a total group exposure to TEZ/IVA of 115 years.  
Table 32 Study 110 PEx Analysis Period: PEx Results, Study 106/110 (F/F) and Study 
108/110 (F/RF) PEx Analysis Sets 
Pulmonary exacerbation requiring hospitalizations: Similar to results for the number of PEx for subjects 
in the 106/110 PE analysis set (F/F population), the event rate for PEx requiring hospitalization 
remained low for subjects who received TEZ/IVA in Study 106 (0.22) and was reduced from 0.29 in 
Study 106 to 0.18 in Study 110 for subjects who received placebo in Study 106. The event rate for PEx 
requiring hospitalization was low for all 3 groups of subjects in the 108/110 PE analysis set (F/RF 
population) in Study 110.  
Pulmonary exacerbation requiring IV antibiotics: Similar to results for the number of PEx for subjects in 
the 106/110 PE analysis set (F/F population), the event rate for the PEx requiring IV antibiotics 
remained low for subjects who received TEZ/IVA in Study 106 (0.33) and was reduced from 0.54 in 
Study 106 to 0.27 in Study 110 for subjects who received placebo in Study 106. The event rate for the 
number of PEx requiring IV antibiotics was low for all 3 groups in Study 110 for subjects in the 
108/110 PE analysis set (F/RF population).

Time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation: For subjects in the 106/110 PE analysis set (F/F population), the 
estimated exacerbation-free probability for subjects who received TEZ/IVA in Study 106 was 0.602 
after 48 weeks of TEZ/IVA treatment. For subjects who received placebo in Study 106, the estimated 
exacerbation-free probability at Week 24 in Study 110 was 0.752, which was higher than the 
estimated exacerbation-free probability at Week 24 for treatment with placebo (0.649) and similar to 
the estimated exacerbation-free probability at Week 24 of Study 106 for subjects who received 
TEZ/IVA (0.749). For subjects in the 108/110 PE analysis set (F/RF population), the estimated 
exacerbation-free probability for subjects who received TEZ/IVA in Study 108 was 0.857 after 24 
weeks ofTEZ/IVA treatment. The estimated exacerbation-free probability at Week 24 in Study 110 was 
0.863 for subjects who received placebo in Study 108 and 0.751 for subjects who received IVA in 
Study 108. 
Respiratory Symptoms (Measured by CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score): CFQ-R was also evaluated in 
Study 110. For subjects who received TEZ/IVA in Study 106 or Study 108 Period 2, improvements in 
CFQ-R respiratory domain score continued through all visits in Study 110. Subjects who received 
placebo in Study 106 and began treatment with TEZ/IVA in Study 110 had improvements as early as 
Day 15 (within-group change = 3.8 points) that were sustained through Week 24 of Study 110. 
Subjects who received placebo in Study 108 Period 2 and begin treatment with TEZ/IVA in Study 110 
had improvements as early as Day 15 (within-group change = 9.8 points) that were sustained through 
Week 16 of Study 110. The magnitude and trend of improvement in CFQ-R respiratory domain score 
observed for subjects receiving the first dose of TEZ/IVA in Study 110 were similar to those observed 
for subjects who received the first dose of TEZ/IVA in Study 106 and Study 108, respectively, see 
below.

Figure 12 MMRM Analyses of Absolute Change From Baseline in Pooled CFQ-R Respiratory 
Domain Score at Each Visit 
At Week 24 in Study 106, the proportion of patients who had at least a 4 point increase in CFQ-R 
respiratory domain score was 51.3% in the TEZ/IVA group and 35.7% in the placebo group. In 
subjects who received TEZ/IVA for 48 weeks, the proportion of subjects who met or exceeded the 
MCID at Study 106 Week 24 was 48.6% through 24 weeks of additional TEZ/IVA treatment in Study 
110.  
F/RF subjects treated with either TEZ/IVA or IVA in Study 108 had a numerical increase of 2.6 points 
in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score after 16 weeks of TEZ/IVA treatment. Additionally, F/RF subjects 
who received placebo in Study 108 had an improvement of 11.3 points in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain 
Score after they received TEZ/IVA for 16 weeks in Study 110. The proportion of patients who met or 
exceeded the MCID at the conclusion of Study 108 (53.9%) was maintained through an additional 16 
weeks of TEZ/IVA treatment in Study 110 (62.2%)  
Absolute change from baseline in BMI: For subjects in the 106/110 efficacy set (F/F population), BMI 
continued to increase for both groups in Study 110. For subjects who received TEZ/IVA in Study 106, 
the within-group change in BMI was 0.26 kg/m2 at Week 24 of Study 110 compared to 0.18 kg/m2 at

Week 24 of Study 106. For subjects who received placebo in Study 106, the within-group change in 
BMI was 0.26 kg/m2 at Week 24 of Study 110 compared to 0.12 kg/m2 at Week 24 of Study 106. For 
subjects in the 108/110 efficacy set (F/RF population), at IA2, BMI increased an additional 0.53 kg/m2 
for subjects who received TEZ/IVA in Period 2 of Study 108, compared 0.35 kg/m2 for subjects who 
received placebo in Period 2 of Study 108 and 0.16 kg/m2 for subjects who received ivacaftor in Period 
2 of Study 108.  
Absolute change from baseline in weight: For subjects in the 106/110 efficacy set (F/F population), 
weight continued to increase for both groups in Study 110. For subjects who received TEZ/IVA in Study 
106, the within-group change in weight was 0.7 kg at Week 24 of Study 106 compared to 1.2 kg at 
Week 24 of Study 110. For subjects who received placebo in Study 106, the within-group change in 
weight was 0.6 kg at Week 24 of Study 106 compared to 1.0 kg at Week 24 of Study 110. 
For subjects in the 108/110 efficacy set (F/RF population), weight continued to increase for all 3 
groups in Study 110. For subjects who received TEZ/IVA in Period 2 of Study 108, the within-group 
change in weight was 1.1 kg at Week 8 of Study 108 compared to 2.3 kg at Week 16 of Study 110. For 
subjects who received placebo in Period 2 of Study 108, the within-group change in weight was 0.6 kg 
at Week 8 of Study 108 compared to 1.7 kg at Week 16 of Study 110. For subjects who received IVA 
in Period 2 of Study 108, the within-group change in weight was 1.4 kg at Week 8 of Study 108 
compared to 2.1 kg at Week 16 of Study 110. 
Interim analysis 2 (100% of the enrolled patients analysed) 
With the responses to the CHMP’s requests, summarised data of a second interim analysis (IA2) of 
data from 100% of the subjects from Study 106 completing 24 weeks and subjects from Study 108 
completing 16 weeks of the 96 weeks is submitted. For this analysis, the baseline is defined as the last 
non-missing assessment before the first dose of TEZ/IVA in Study 110. The results are presented as LS 
estimates.  
For F/F subjects from parent study 106, the results were following:  
At Week 24 of Study 110, in F/F subjects the LS mean absolute change (SD) from baseline in ppFEV1 
for subjects in PBO-TEZ/IVA group was 4.2 pp (0.5) and for subjects in the TEZ/IVA group -0.2 pp 
(0.5). 
The estimated event rate per year of PEx was 0.65 (95% CI 0.52, 0.80) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.60, 0.87) 
in PBO-TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA groups, respectively). 
The estimated event rate per year of PEx requiring hospitalisation or IV antibiotic therapy was 0.33 
(95% CI 0.25, 0.45) and 0.35 (95% CI 0.27, 0.46) in PBO-TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA groups, respectively). 
The change in CFQ-R was 3.3 (1.0) points in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group, and 0.4 (1.0) points in TEZ/IVA 
group.  
The change in BMI was 0.23 kg/m2 (0.06) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group and 0.00 kg/m2 (0.06) in 
TEZ/IVA group, while the change in weight was 0.9 kg (0.20 in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group, and 0.2 kg 
(0.20) in TEZ/IVA group.  
For F/RF subject from parent study 108, the results were following:  
At Week 16 of Study 110, in F/RF subjects the LS mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 for 
subjects in PBO-TEZ/IVA group was 4.9 pp (0.6), for subjects in IVA-TEZ/IVA group 2.4 pp (0.7) and 
for subjects in the TEZ/IVA group 0.0 pp (0.6).

Results for adolescents are described in section on specific populations.  
Study VX08-770-104  
Study VX08-770-104 (Study 104) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
16-week study (Part A) with a 96-week, OLE (Part B) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IVA 
monotherapy in subjects with the F/F genotype.  
Part A was a 16-week, 4:1 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 2 study 
of ivacaftor (150 mg every 12 hours) in 140 patients with CF age 12 years and older  who were 
homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene and who had FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted.  
Subjects were eligible to participate in Part B in case of: 
•  An increase of ≥10% relative to baseline ppFEV1 at 1 or more time points  
•  A decrease from baseline in sweat chloride concentration of ≥15 mmol/L at both the Day 15 
and Week 8 visits. 
Efficacy measures were considered secondary endpoints and included absolute change in ppFEV1, 
sweat chloride, CFQ-R, pulmonary exacerbations, weight, and rate of decline in percent predicted 
FEV1. The study was discontinued by the sponsor following results obtained from a pre-specified 
evaluation of the Part B data.  
PART A, EFFICACY RESULTS (placebo controlled phase)  
For the primary endpoint, absolute change of ppFEV1, the adjusted mean was 1.53 % in the ivacaftor 
group and -0.18 % in the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus 
placebo was 1.72 % (95% CI: -0.6349, 4.0754); this difference was not statistically significant (P = 
0.1509). For the secondary endpoint, the adjusted mean in sweat chloride values was greater in the 
VX-770 group (-2.74 mmol/L) than in the placebo group (0.13 mmol/L); this difference was nominally 
statistically significant (nominal: P = 0.0384). The changes in sweat chloride occurred by Day 15 and 
were sustained for the duration of the 16-week treatment period. The treatment difference on 
respiratory symptoms, as measured by the change in CFQ-R respiratory domain of VX-770 
administration compared to placebo was 1.31 points. An effect of VX-770 administration on weight, as 
measured by the change in weight, weight-for-age z-score, BMI, and BMI-for-age z-score over 16 
weeks of treatment was not observed in this study (treatment difference 0.07 kg/m2.

PART B, EFFICACY RESULTS (OLE Phase) 
A total of 38 patients rolled over to the OLE phase, 5 patients who received placebo and 38 who 
received VX-770. The rate of decline from Part A baseline through Week 64 in percent predicted FEV1 
was 5.7445% in the placebo/VX-770 group and -1.0738% in the VX-770/VX-770 group (treatment 
difference -6.8183% (95% CI: -14.6503, 1.0136, P = 0.0876). The rate of decline in percent predicted 
FEV1 from Part B baseline through Week 64 was 5.3409% in the placebo/VX-770 group and -5.2994% 
in the VX-770/VX-770 group. The estimated treatment difference for the VX-770/VX-770 group versus 
the placebo/VX-770 group was -10.6402 (95% CI: -20.4402, -0.8402; P = 0.0336); the clinical 
significance of this finding is uncertain because both groups received VX-770 for the duration of Part B.  
For subjects treated with VX-770 for 64 weeks (VX-770/VX-770 group), the marginal decrease in mean 
absolute change in sweat chloride that was observed from baseline to Week 16 in Part A was not 
sustained through Week 64. There were no differences for the change in CFQ-R respiratory domain 
score, the yearly rate of pulmonary exacerbations or weight.  
Study VX14-661-107 
Study VX14-661-107 (study 107) was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, multicenter study in subjects with CF who are heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR 
mutation and with a second CFTR mutation that is not likely to respond to TEZ and/or IVA therapy. 
TEZ 100 mg once daily qd)/IVA 150 mg q12h was administered for up to 12 weeks.  
CFTR mutations that are not likely to respond to VX-661 and/or ivacaftor therapy were defined using 3 
major sources: biological plausibility for the mutation to respond (i.e., class), evidence of clinical 
severity on a population basis based on the patient registry CFTR, and in vitro testing. The clinical 
severity criteria (average sweat chloride >86 mmol/L, %PI >50%) do not specifically apply to the 
individual subjects to be enrolled in this study, but were used to classify the mutation status: 
Truncation mutations 
• %PI >50% and/or SwCl- >86 mmol/L 
• no full-length protein 
Canonical splice mutations 
• %PI >50% and/or SwCl- >86 mmol/L 
• no or little mature mRNA 
Frameshift mutations 
• %PI >50% and/or SwCl- >86 mmol/L 
• garbled or truncated protein 
Class II, III, IV mutations 
not responsive to ivacaftor 
or VX-661* 
• %PI >50% and/or SwCl- >86 mmol/L 
OR 
• not responsive in vitro to ivacaftor or VX-661 
%PI: percentage of subjects who are pancreatic insufficient; SwCl-: sweat chloride 
* mutations that responded with chloride transport <10% of wild-type CFTR were considered minimal function and nonresponsive 
The rationale of this study was if a positive treatment effect of the TEZ /IVA combination could be 
demonstrated, a large number of patients would benefit. 
Efficacy results 
The LS mean treatment difference for the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 12 
for the TEZ/IVA group versus the placebo group was 1.2 % (95% CI: -0.3, 2.6; P value: 0.1176). The

LS mean treatment difference for the TEZ/IVA group versus the placebo group by visit was similar to 
the difference observed through Week 12 and ranged from 0.6 to 1.9 %. Treatment with TEZ/IVA did 
not demonstrate statistically significant treatment differences in the absolute change in ppFEV1 from 
baseline through Week 12. The 1-sided 80% UCB for LS mean treatment difference in the absolute 
change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 12 was 1.79 %, which was below the predefined futility 
boundary of 2.5% and the 1-sided 80% UCB for LS mean within treatment difference in the absolute 
change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 12 for the TEZ/IVA group was 1.52 %, which was below 
the futility boundary of 1.75 %. There were no clinically relevant differences for the change in CFQ-R 
respiratory domain score (2.1 points), the number (event rate per year) of pulmonary exacerbations 
(23 [0.98] events) vs 22 [0.97] events), BMI (-0.08 kg/m2), BMI z-score (-0.05). The within-group LS 
mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through Week 12 was greater in the TEZ/IVA 
group (-4.7 mmol/L) compared with the placebo group (-1.2 mmol/L), however the difference is not 
clinically relevant.  
Study VX14-661-109 
The results of this study were submitted during the assessment procedure.  Study VX14-661-109 
compared TEZ/IVA with IVA in 156 subjects aged 12 years and older with CF who are heterozygous for 
the F508del-CFTR mutation and a second CFTR allele with a gating defect that is clinically 
demonstrated to be IVA-responsive. The objectives and design are presented in the table below.  
Table 34 Summary of design of study 109 
The primary endpoint was the average absolute change in ppFEV1 through Week 8 of the Active 
Comparator Treatment Period (the baseline was the conclusion of the Run-in Period). The majority of 
subjects were White (96.7%). A total of 56.0% of subjects were male. The overall median age was 
32.0 years (range: 12 to 71 years), with 18 (12.0%) subjects in the 12 to <18 years old subgroup. 
Demographic parameters were similar between the TEZ/IVA and IVA groups and similar in the Active 
Comparator Treatment Period (ACTP) and the IVA Run-in Period. Subjects were using similar 
concomitant medications during the IVA Run-in Period.  
Within group, the mean treatment difference in absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through 
Week 8 was 0.2 percentage points (95% CI: -0.5, 1.0; P = 0.5355) in the IVA group and 0.5 
percentage points (95% CI: -0.2, 1.3; P = 0.1548) in the TEZ/IVA group. The LS mean treatment

difference between the TEZ/IVA and IVA groups for absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through 
Week 8 was 0.3 percentage points (95% CI: -0.8, 1.4; P = 0.5846). 
Key secondary endpoints were relative changes in  ppFEV1 and change in CFQ-R. Change in sweat 
chloride was a secondary efficacy endpoint. Treatment with TEZ/IVA resulted in a greater reduction 
(improvement) in sweat chloride concentration compared to IVA. The mean treatment difference 
between the TEZ/IVA and IVA groups in absolute change in sweat chloride from study baseline through 
Week 8 was -5.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -10.7, -0.9; P = 0.0216). The relative change in ppFEV1 and 
change in CFQ-R between the TEZ/IVA and IVA group were similiar. 
In vitro –in vivo relationship  
In vitro studies were used to identify mutations that are likely to respond to TEZ/IVA in a clinical 
setting.  
In vitro models 
HBE cells and FRT in vitro model systems were used to understand the biology of CFTR mutations and 
effect of CFTR modulators on chloride transport: both models are well-established in vitro models for 
the studying CF (refer for details to non clinical assessment). In the FRT in vitro model, the F508del-
CFTR response to TEZ/IVA, which represents the response of a single allele, did not reach the 
threshold of an increase in chloride transport over baseline of ≥10 % of normal.  
Residual Function and IVA-Responsive Gating Mutations: The FRT model was used to evaluate the 
effect of TEZ/IVA on the CFTR mutations eligible for Studies 108 (and 109). Normal CFTR, the 20 
missense RF CFTR forms eligible for Study 108, and the 10 IVA-responsive mutations eligible for Study 
109 responded to TEZ/IVA with an increase in chloride transport of at least 10 % higher than normal 
CFTR. The 5 splice mutations eligible for Study 108 produce both correctly and aberrantly spliced CFTR 
transcripts; thus epithelial cells with these mutations express normal CFTR on the surface, although at 
reduced levels. FRT cells which express normal CFTR respond to TEZ/IVA with increased chloride 
transport, supporting that these 5 splice mutations will be responsive in vivo. 
Of the 25 CFTR mutations eligible for Study 108, subjects with 17 mutations were enrolled. The 
ppFEV1 response in this group is used to support the ability of the in vitro model to predict clinical 
response to TEZ/IVA. The Study 108 subgroup analysis in subjects with splice mutations demonstrated 
a clinical response to TEZ/IVA. R347H-CFTR mutant was excluded based on an in vitro increase in 
chloride transport below the pre-defined threshold of 10%. All 9 mutations eligible for Study 108, for 
which no subjects were enrolled, were responsive to TEZ/IVA in the FRT model system. These 9 
mutations were initially included in the proposed label. The 10 gating mutations eligible for Study 109 
were responsive to TEZ/IVA in vitro and had a greater increase in chloride transport for TEZ/IVA than 
IVA and were initially proposed for the indication. In the response to the 1ste RSI, they are removed as 
the consequence of the results of the finalised study 109, which showed no difference in clinical 
response between ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor. 
TEZ/IVA-nonresponsive CFTR mutations: In vitro responses are also used as model for prediction of 
negative clinical responses. Many mutations included in Study 107 are not amenable to in vitro study 
due to the lack of any CFTR protein produced (truncation mutations). Two mutations in Study 107 
(R1066C and N1303K) result in CFTR protein with processing and trafficking defects, and these CFTR 
forms were not responsive to TEZ/IVA in vitro in the FRT assay. These in vitro results were confirmed 
by the outcomes of Study 107.  
In the response to the CHMP’s request, scatterplots of the in vitro and in vivo responses were 
submitted, see figure below. The scatterplots show the in vitro response in the FRT assay and clinical

endpoints (i.e. ppFEV1, sweat chloride) for individual subjects in Study 108, 109 (ivacaftor naive) and 
107 (R1066c, N1303K). The 5 splice mutations from Study 108 (i.e., 711+3A→G, 2789+5G→A, 3272-
26A→G, or 3849+10kbC→T, and E831X) were not included in the scatterplots because FRT cells 
expressing the different splice mutations were not generated.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
At the time of the submission, tezacaftor/ivacaftor was claimed to be indicated in a combination 
regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets “the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 
12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or who have at least one mutation 
in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that is responsive to 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor based on in vitro and/or clinical evidence (see section 5.1). A table with these 
mutations was included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Hence, the proposed indication reflected the populations that were clinically investigated i.e. patients 
with CF who are homozygous for the F508del mutation, and patients with CF who are heterozygous for 
the F508del/residual function mutation, for which clinical data is collected. In addition, inclusion of 
CFTR mutations with residual function identified as responsive to TEZ/IVA was based on in vitro data 
models and was also initially proposed by the applicant.  
For the in vitro test, HBE and mainly FRT models were used. These models were suggested by the 
applicant to be useful as support for distinguishing patients with CFTR mutations expected to benefit 
from treatment for which no extensive clinical data would be available. The use of in vitro data would

Page 121/165 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
then be justified by a scientific understanding of the molecular basis of CFTR dysfunction, the known 
mechanism of action of the drug and the HBE/FRT models which the applicant asserts to be considered 
robust and established. A 10% increase in chloride transport was specified without clinical validation 
that this threshold of response would be decisive to predict clinical efficacy. The stably transfected FRT 
cell line appears to be particularly useful for gathering information on the underlying defect of certain 
CFTR mutant proteins. However, their relevance for the in vivo clinical situation can be questionable 
given their non-human origin and the high artificially overexpressed levels of transfected CFTR mutant 
protein in this system (refer to non-clinical part for a detailed discussion). 
Scatterplots were provided with the results of all patients with residual function mutations in study 
108, of the treatment naïve patients in study 109 with gating mutations  and of the patients with 
minimal function mutations R1066C and N1303K in Study 107 as for these patients/mutations baseline 
ppFEV1 and in vitro data were available. Although, the majority of data points for individual subjects 
fall into the upper right quadrant for ppFEV1 and lower right quadrant for sweat chloride suggesting 
that the cut-off may have been be well chosen, the absence of the ‘negative’ side complicates the 
interpretation of the validity. Moreover, the absence of a scatter around a diagonal does not 
demonstrate a correlation between chloride transport and ppFEV1 increase, nor does it indicate a 
clinically relevant increase in ppFEV1. Furthermore, while IVA alone mostly appears to produce smaller 
increases from baseline in chloride transport compared to TEZ/IVA, there appears to be a similar 
spread of ppFEV1 and sweat chloride values for IVA monotherapy as for TEZ/IVA. The wide spread of 
the clinical response within a certain mutation is clearly demonstrated in the box-and-whisker plots.  
For generalisability/extrapolation purposes regarding mutations not clinically investigated, a Mixed 
Model analyses were requested by the CHMP and were provided by the applicant. When comparing the 
predicted means with the observed medians (and constructing a range based on +/-1.96 times the 
within mutation SD), the model seems to overestimate the effect size for the majority of mutations 
with small sample size (< 10) and to predict well for mutations with a larger sample size (≥10). Thus 
the model is driven by the mutations with larger number of patients. This is confirmed in the threshold 
analysis: in 6 out of the 10 mutations with a low number of patients, the predicted percentage of 
patients with ≥ 2% improvement is higher than observed.  
As the consequence of the above shortcomings of the in vitro model itself and the unclear relation 
between in vitro and in vivo results, the CHMP concluded that the originally proposed clinical indication 
including mutations based on in vitro evidence solely is not sufficiently justified.  Further investigations 
for validation of this model with FRT cell or other in vitro systems would be needed. The applicant is 
encouraged to discuss the validation of the in vitro models (FRT cells or primary human cells) as well 
as the in vitro-in vivo relation within an EMA/CHMP qualification advice, during post-authorisation 
phase. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Dose finding studies  
Multiple doses of tezacaftor alone and combinations of tezacaftor with ivacaftor have been investigated 
in two phase II studies: study 101 (a dose ranging study in adult subjects with F/F genotype and in 
adult and adolescent subjects with F/G551D) and study 103 (a dose confirming study in adult CF 
patients, homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation). The same dosing was used in adolescents as 
for adults based equivalence of severity of disease and similar maturity of the CYP enzymes. The 
specified primary efficacy analysis variable/endpoint was the absolute change in sweat chloride 
(mmol/L) from baseline through Day 28. Given the acceptance of sweat chloride as a diagnostic 
Assessment report

criterion and an important pharmacodynamic indicator of disease severity in CF, this is considered 
appropriate. Absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 was evaluated as a secondary endpoint. The use 
of MMRM as the primary analysis is generally not supported in the presence of missing data, but in the 
context of an exploratory study this is less of a concern. 
Main studies 
Efficacy and safety have been evaluated in 5 phase III studies in CF patients aged 12 years and older.  
Study 106 in subjects homozygous for F508del (F/F) and study 108 in subjects heterozygous for 
F508del and a residual function mutation (F/RF) are the core efficacy studies. Study 110 was designed 
to support persistence of efficacy and long-term safety. Results are currently submitted as an interim 
analysis. The supportive studies Study 107 investigated TEZ/IVA  in subjects heterozygous for F508del 
and a minimal function mutation that is not likely nonresponsive to TEZ and/or IVA (F/MF), while study 
770-104  investigated ivacaftor monotherapy in subjects with the F/F genotype. The recently ended 
Study 109 compared TEZ/IVA versus IVA in patients with the F508del/gating genotype. 
All main studies were randomised double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre studies except open-
label, single-arm extension study 110. Studies 101, 109 and 108 were also active controlled by 
ivacaftor. Placebo was deemed necessary, because no CFTR modulators were approved for the F/F 
population at the time of study initiation and for adequate assessment of the benefit in the absence of 
an approved CFTR modulator in subjects with F/RF genotypes. The ivacaftor control arm allowed for 
assessment of contribution of tezacaftor to ivacaftor. Study 110 included a Treatment Cohort and an 
Observational Cohort. The in-and exclusion criteria for the dose-response studies, studies 101 and 
103, and pivotal trials 106 and 108 were largely similar, except for the genotype mutations. In all 
studies the patients were 12 years and older. Patients had to have FEV1 ≥40% and ≤ 90% and stable 
CF. Diagnosis of CF was confirmed with standard methods of sweat chloride testing.  
In study 108, the definition of ‘residual function’ is unusual as in vitro responsiveness requirement has 
been added. Patients needed to have a residual function based on population-level clinical phenotypic 
data and in vitro responsiveness to ivacaftor. Although the used criteria are acceptable for identifying 
patients, it is questionable if the term ‘residual function’ should have been used. Moreover, given the 
heterogeneity of the mutations with residual function, further characterisation in terms of the 
functional class as well as whether all of them are disease-causing are presented as requested, 
although summarily. Compared to class II (containing F508 homozygotes), classes IV and V had a 
significantly lower mortality rate and milder clinical phenotype.1 Patients with CF and a RF mutation 
have a reduced rate of lung function decline compared to those homozygous for F508del (−0.82 
compared to −1.77)2 However, patients with an RF mutation still demonstrate progressive lung 
disease, particularly during adolescence.  
The exclusion criteria were acceptable and in line with the risks (adverse events) known from Kalydeco 
(ivacaftor) and Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor). The duration of the dose finding studies 101 and 103 
of 28 days and 12 weeks + 40 weeks OLE, respectively, is acceptable. The 24 week treatment period 
of pivotal study 106 is in line with the EMA guideline on CF (CHMP/EWP/9147/08) and in accordance 
with the CHMP’s scientific advice. Pivotal study 106 had a parallel design. Study 108 had a cross-over 
design with two 8 week treatment periods with a wash-out period of 8 weeks in between. The wash-
out period is justified from a pharmacokinetic perspective, while clinically a comparison for the baseline 
values of ppFEV1, CFQ-R and sweat chloride per period further excluded a carry-over effect.

Furthermore, the duration of treatment is very short, thus a difference may not have been captured 
within the trial. Long term data are provided from Study 110 with a duration of approximately 96 
weeks.  
Endpoints 
All studies included the following endpoints: absolute change in ppFEV1, change of sweat chloride, 
height and weight, CFQ-R, pulmonary exacerbations and BMI. Depending on the type of study and the 
objectives of the study, primary and secondary endpoints were appointed. The primary endpoints in 
the phase II studies were change of sweat chloride in study 101 and absolute change in ppFEV1 in 
study 103, primarily for the purpose of PD assessments and dose finding, respectively. These 
endpoints are acceptable to the CHMP.  
For the pivotal studies 106 and 108, the primary endpoint is absolute change in ppFEV1. FEV1 is the 
advocated primary endpoint in EMA’s guideline on CF (CHMP/EWP/9147/08). Rate of decline in FEV1 
has been demonstrated to correlate with survival and to be the strongest clinical predictor of mortality, 
while FEV1 is repeatable and, adjusted for age and sex, has been shown to be a cofactor for mortality. 
However, in study 108, the average of ppFEV1 from Week 4 to Week 8 is used. The results of a post-
hoc of analysis using of the mixed-effects model at Week 8 alone were consistent with the primary 
analysis. The key secondary endpoints in study 106 (relative change in ppFEV1, number of pulmonary 
exacerbations, absolute change in BMI, change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score) and in study 108 
(absolute change in CFQ-R, with the remaining as secondary endpoints) are all accepted endpoints in 
CF clinical trials. Each of them is able to measure a different aspect of the disease, and together able 
to support a benefit for CF patients. In extension Study 110, the same endpoints were used as in the 
parent studies.  
Statistical methods 
The analysis methods for the continuous repeated measures data e.g. ppFEV1 and CFQ-R, and the 
rates and timing of exacerbations are appropriate. Head-to-head comparisons of TEZ/IVA to IVA in 
study 108 were removed via protocol amendment from the set of endpoints for which type I error was 
protected, so these cannot be statistically significant in a formal sense. The applicant explained that 
the comparison of TEZ/IVA vs IVA was considered of interest, but not reason is provided for the 
removal of statistical testing. As for Symkevi no mutations are proposed that already registered for 
Kalydeco, this decision is acceptable.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose regimen 
For the CF patients 18 years or older with F/F mutation (n=194 included in study 101, ppFEV1 
increased more with TEZ 100 mg qd /IVA 150 mg q12h compared to TEZ 150 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h 
(4.44 % vs. 4.13 %) and to VX-661 50 mg q12h/IVA 150 mg q12h  (3.66 % vs 2.31 %). There was no 
clear evidence of a TEZ dose response on ppFEV1. 
In study 101 there was discrepancy between sweat chloride and ppFEV1 outcomes, with TEZ 
monotherapy achieving consistently superior reductions in sweat chloride compared with TEZ/IVA; 
whereas change in ppFEV1 was superior with TEZ/IVA versus TEZ at the proposed combination dose. 
As discussed in the PD section, overall, the results for ppFEV1 demonstrated quite consistently a 
greater effect for TEZ/IVA combination with the highest response for TEZ 100 mg qd /IVA 150 mg 
q12h and a clinically relevant difference with TEZ 100 mg. However, there was no clear dose response 
to TEZ monotherapy at 10 mg q.d., which appeared to produce improvement in ppFEV1 not dissimilar 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 124/165 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to that with the combination. For sweat chloride TEZ monotherapy at 100 mg and 150 mg qd appeared 
more effective at reducing sweat chloride than the combination, but there were inconsistences between 
the combination and the monocomponent tezacaftor and also between the TEZ monotherapy dose 
groups. Evaluation of treatment differences versus pooled placebo across cohorts demonstrated also 
inconsistency between sweat chloride and FEV1 data. However, in all groups the number of patients in 
the groups was low, either 8 (monotherapy) or 16 (combination therapy).  
Exposure-response modelling results submitted to support clinical superiority of TEZ/IVA over TEZ was 
not fully reassuring. In vitro data were not conclusive either. There was a discrepancy between the 
patch clamp data and the Ussing chamber chloride conductance data when F508del is expressed in the 
same FRT cell system. Moreover, the patch clamp data are not aligned with the in vivo data in study 
101 which appeared to demonstrate an effect of tezacaftor monotherapy in reduction of sweat 
chloride, which the applicant acknowledges, is not fully understood.  
The effect of IVA in subjects with the F/F genotype was been investigated in study 104. The estimated 
treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 1.72 % (95% CI: -0.6349, 4.0754, P = 0.1509) 
suggesting that the effects of TEZ/IVA in study 106 (LS mean absolute change from baseline for 
placebo -0.6 and for TEZ/IVA 3.4) is partly due to effect of ivacaftor. For the 18 CF patients 12 years 
or older with F/G551D in study 101, change in sweat chloride was -7.02 mmol/L for TEZ 100 mg qd + 
Kalydeco, with a treatment difference of -17.2 mmol/L compared to Placebo + Kalydeco (P = 0.0238). 
A clinically relevant response was also observed in ppFEV1 within treatment and compared to Kalydeco 
alone.   
In the response to the CHMP’s request during evaluation, summarised data of a second interim 
analysis (IA2) of study 110 were provided. These follow up data could be analysed for all subjects 
(685), for patients with F/F mutation after 24 weeks and after 16 weeks for subject with F/RF mutation 
of the 96 weeks of the study. For the vast majority of the patients when rolling over the OLE study, 
dosing was not interrupted. Although interruption was up to 198 days, this is not expected to be of 
importance because of the small number of patients with interruption i.e. 20 subjects from Study 106 
and 16 patients from Study 108.  
Adolescents 
The same dosing was used in adolescents as for adults based equivalence of severity of disease and 
similar maturity of the CYP enzymes. A comparable exposure was confirmed by simulated AUC vs age 
based on the pop-PK model.  
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/F genotype 
In the pivotal study 106 in 510 patients the baseline demographics, characteristics and concomitant 
medication appeared to be balanced overall. Missing data for the repeated measurements data were 
not an issue (less than 10%). The LS mean treatment difference in absolute change in ppFEV1 
between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups was 4.0 % (95% CI: 3.1, 4.8) in favour of TEZ/IVA 
(P<0.0001). The obtained difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo was above the predefined 
threshold (2.5 %) and also above the definition of clinical relevance of 2.5 % as determined as the 
average natural decline in CF patients (Report of the workshop on endpoints for cystic fibrosis clinical 
trials (EMA/769571/2012)). Results from MMRM analysis demonstrated a statistically significant 
improvement in absolute change in ppFEV1 compared to placebo already on Day 15 of 3.4 %. These 
improvements were sustained during the treatment period, with an increasing difference with placebo 
because of the gradual decrease in the placebo group of -1.3 % at week 24, in line with an expected 
Assessment report

yearly loss of approximately 2.5%. The post–hoc sensitivity analyses supported the primary analysis, 
also by 95% CI and statistical significance. 
A requested ANCOVA model with an imputation method for the missing data yielded a LS mean 
treatment difference in ppFEV1 similar in magnitude to the LS mean treatment difference of 5.0 
percentage points in the ANCOVA analysis with no imputations and remains highly statistically 
significant.   
The inclusion of patients with ppFEV1 <40, despite the exclusion criterion, is caused by a difference in 
ppFEV1 at screening and at baseline study visit.  
Consistent and significant effects in ppFEV1 favouring TEZ/IVA were observed across all pre-specified 
subgroups: age, sex, baseline lung function, region, P. aeruginosa infection, and baseline use of 
common CF medications. The lowest point estimate of 3.5 % difference in the groups of patients with 
ppFEV1 < 40% and in female sex is still above clinical relevance. 
The results of the key secondary endpoint, relative change from baseline in ppFEV1, support the 
primary endpoint. However, this parameter is not independent from the primary endpoint. For the 
other key secondary endpoint pulmonary exacerbations, the event rate was lower in the TEZ/IVA 
group (0.64 events per year) than in the placebo group (0.99 events per year). The rate reduction of 
0.35 in PEx was statistically significant in favour of TEZ/IVA. This reduction of 35.3 % is considered 
clinically relevant. The hazard ratio for time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation requiring IV antibiotic 
therapy was also in favour of TEZ/IVA (0.553; P= 0.0080) as were the number of planned and 
unplanned hospitalisations. However, numbers of patients with exacerbations were low.  
The secondary endpoint hierarchy was broken by the results of BMI. For this important extra-
pulmonary parameter, the LS mean absolute change from baseline was numerically greater in the 
TEZ/IVA group (0.18 kg/m2) than in the placebo group (0.12 kg/m2). The LS mean (95% CI) of 
change from baseline in BMI was 0.06 (-0.08, 0.19; P= 0.4127). Therefore, the hierarchical multiple 
testing procedure was stopped.   
In additional analyses in undernourished subjects (those with a weight- or a BMI-for-age z score below 
0) improvement in BMI was numerically greater with placebo compared with TEZ/IVA and numerically 
less with TEZ/IVA (0.15 kg/m2) in under-nourished patients compared with the overall patient 
population in study 106 (0.18 kg/m2). However, the responder analysis of under-nourished patients 
who achieved a target BMI (defined for subjects <20 years as meeting a BMI-z-score was ≥ 0 and for 
subjects ≥20 years as meeting BMI value greater than the median baseline BMI value for healthy 
subjects) revealed more responders in the TEZ/IVA compared with placebo group, indicating a trend 
benefit on nutritional status with TEZ/IVA.  
The last key secondary endpoint in the testing hierarchy was the CFQ-R respiratory domain score. The 
LS mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups in pooled CFQ-R respiratory 
domain score was 5.1 points (95% CI: 3.2, 7.0; nominal P<0.0001).  
The reduction in sweat chloride is modest, given that homozygous F508del/F508del patients have 
baseline sweat chloride in the region of 100 mmol/L. Based on natural history data, mutations with 
residual CFTR activity that have sweat chloride levels approximately 10% lower (improved) than 
severe mutations have disease manifestations that are either less severe or demonstrate a delay in 
onset compared with the most severe mutations. Therefore, the reduction is acceptably relevant.  
Preliminary results of open label extension study 110 at the time of the first interim analysis suggest 
that the efficacy observed in Study 106 is mirrored: an improvement of ppFEV1 is already observed at 
Day 15 for patients on previous placebo treatment and at Week 24 the LS mean absolute change from

baseline in ppFEV1 was 3.1 % (95% CI: 1.9, 4.3; P<0.0001) in the TEZ/IVA group and 4.5 % (95% 
CI: 3.3, 5.7; P<0.0001) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group. Thus, both groups achieved a clinically relevant 
improvement from baseline. However, the initially observed improvement lowered in the TEZ/IVA 
group. Nevertheless, two different baselines are used for subjects enrolled from study 106 into study 
110.  For subjects who used tezacaftor/ivacaftor in study106, the baseline corresponds to the baseline 
of study 106, while for those who used placebo in study106, the baseline considered is that of study 
110.  
Summary results of a second interim analysis using study 110 baseline were submitted with 100% of 
patients. A loss of 0.5 percentage points in ppFEV1 was observed during the additional 24 weeks. This 
was considered acceptable as it is lower than the annual loss in this group of patients with F/F 
mutation i.e., −1.91 (95%CI, -1.82, −1.72) points using the Global Lung Initiative (GLI) equations3.  
The rate of decline is higher in adolescents compared to adults i.e. annual loss of −2.05 (95%CI, 
−2.15, −1.94). Furthermore, the time period spans from 2006 to 2014, while the standard of care 
since then has considerably changed. As a comparison, in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient 
Registry (CFFPR) the estimated annualised rate of lung function decline was  −2.29 (95%CI, −2.56, 
−2.03) in the period from 2012 to 2014 and in the 2008-2009-2010 data set of the European Cystic 
Fibrosis Society Patient Registry −1.52 (−1.72, −1.31) in the 2008-2009-2010. Compared to this data 
from registries the results achieved by the treatment with TEZ/IVA could be considered relevant. The 
F/F subjects, who received TEZ/IVA during Study 106, maintained the improvements in BMI achieved 
in Study 106 during the extension period of Study 110. Further analyses of the data of the second 
interim analysis with using MMRM analysis showed similar trends.  
The percentage of undernourished subjects in the adolescent group was considerably higher than in 
the adult group (69.8% vs. 17.5% respectively). This finding is in line with the nutritional decline that 
has been reported by several studies during adolescence and that commonly persists into early adult 
life. In study 106, no clinically meaningful within-group and between groups changes in the LS mean 
BMI z-score at Week 24. The absolute change in mean from baseline in BMI z-score for subjects <18 
years was 0.10 (0.00, 0.19) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group and −0.04 (−0.13, 0.06) in the TEZ/IVA group 
from Study 110 baseline at IA2. The mean (95%CI) absolute change in BMI for the overall population 
was 0.23 kg/m2 (0.11, 0.34) and 0.00 kg/m2 (−0.11, 0.11) respectively. Further analyses of the data 
of all adolescents patients with using MMRM analysis showed similar trends.  
The initial improvement in CFQ-R was partly maintained (-1.3 point), but after 1 year the difference 
with baseline is near clinical relevance. The responder analysis supported a benefit in favour of 
TEZ/IVA as 51.3% patients were responders after 24 weeks (study 106), only reduced to 108/228 
(48.6%) after 48 weeks (study 110). # 
In Study 106, the event rate of PEx was 0.64 events per year in the TEZ/IVA group and increased to 
0.72 after 24 weeks in Study 110. With this increase in the duration of TEZ/IVA exposure the PEx rate 
was still lower than the rate in the placebo group in Study 106. Moreover, in patients who started 
TEZ/IVA in either Study 106 (parent study) or Study 110, the risk of PEx that led to hospitalization or 
IV antibiotic treatment was 29.6%, while in the CFF Registry, the risk of PEx ranged from 47.6% to 
49.5% from 2012 to 2014. All exacerbation related parameters remained substantially better in the 
two interim analyses (event rate of 0.72) compared to the placebo treated arm in study 106 (event 
rate of 0.99). Thus the positive effect is considered to be sustained.

In study 104, a small not relevant difference in the adjusted mean absolute change from baseline 
through Week 16 in ppFEV1 has been observed between the ivacaftor group (1.5377%) and placebo 
group (-0.1826%) with an estimated treatment difference of 1.7203% (p = 0.1509). A similar picture 
was observed for sweat chloride values with a difference of -2.87 mmol/L (P = 0.0384). In the open 
label extension phase, subjects treated with ivacaftor for 64 weeks (IVA/IVA), the small improvement 
in FEV1 in the parent part was not sustained through Week 64. The efficacy of ivacaftor alone is not 
established in CF patients with F/F genotype.  
CF patients 12 years or older heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, and a second 
allele with residual function  
In the pivotal study 108, 81 subjects received placebo in Period 1 and 81 in Period 2, 81 subjects 
received IVA in Period 1 and 76 in Period 2, and 84 received TEZ/IVA in Period 1 and 78 in Period 2. 
Overall baseline demographics, characteristics and concomitant medication were overall balanced, but 
there were more females than males in the placebo and TEZ/IVA arms compared with the IVA arm 
where males and females were more evenly represented. There were more females than males in all 
study arms but the greatest imbalance between males and females (more females) was in the TEZ/IVA 
and placebo groups, with a lesser imbalance in IVA arm.  A total of 23 patients had baseline sweat 
chloride levels within the normal range. In that case patients had to have documented evidence of 
chronic sinopulmonary disease. The status of chronic lung infection due to P. aeruginosa was not 
collected, but the concomitant use of inhaled antibiotics was collected for a period of 28 days prior to 
the screening and during the study. This may not reflect the incidence of subjects with a history of 
infection over the past 2 years, as some infections would be expected to resolve prior to enrolment. 
Therefore, the results of subgroup analysis by colonization with Pseudomonas do not accurately reflect 
the effect of treatment in study 108.  
The majority of the patients were patients with canonical splice mutations. These mutations are not 
tested for responsiveness to ivacaftor and the applicant argued that these mutations produce both 
correctly and aberrantly spliced CFTR transcripts; thus epithelial cells with these mutations express 
normal CFTR on the surface, although at reduced levels. FRT cells, which express normal CFTR, 
respond to TEZ/IVA with increased chloride transport, supporting that these 5 splice mutations will be 
responsive in vivo. The inclusion is considered acceptable as indeed, in vitro responsiveness cannot 
provided.  
The LS mean treatment difference of ppFEV1 compared to placebo was 6.8 %( 95% CI 5.7, 7.8, 
P<0.0001) and to IVA was 2.1 % (95% CI: 1.2, 2.9; P<0.0001) in favour of TEZ/IVA. The sensitivity 
analysis is supportive for the primary analysis as the obtained difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo 
was above the predefined threshold and was statistically significant. The multiple testing procedure for 
study 108 is not proven to protect type I error, but due to the strong statistical significance, many 
conceivable multiplicity procedures would produce similar results, so this is not considered critical.  
An ad hoc analysis was performed on individual RF mutations for ppFEV1. Although the response of 
splice mutations as a group was confirmed, the results showed that for some genotypes ivacaftor 
monotherapy seems to be a better option and that for some patients ppFEV1 did not improve.  
The clinical relevance of responses of the mutations with clinical data was determined by using 
different thresholds and the annual loss of ppFEV1 of -1.05 with most rapid loss in the 18 to 24–year 
age group (-1.38 (0.39) (excluding R117H )4.

Given the fact that the applicant powered the sample size to detect a 3 percentage point treatment 
difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo, the 2% was chosen as a reasonable difference compared 
with placebo to have an impression of responders. The applicant proposed an additional threshold 
analysis of changes in ppFEV1 ≥0 percentage points, as it was considered that any improvement or 
stabilization in this measure would be considered clinically meaningful as CF subjects with RF 
mutations experience annual declines in ppFEV1. Although this is agreed in general, for studies of 
duration of 8 week treatment a stabilisation cannot fully appointed to a treatment effect yet. 
Furthermore, in the subanalysis of the mutations in study 108 when taken a clinically relevance as for 
the null hypothesis i.e. 3 % only three mutation would not fulfil this threshold, while when using 2%, 
this concerns 2 mutations.  
For following mutations, sufficient clinical evidence is considered present: 2789+5G->A, 3272-26A->G, 
3849+10kbC->T, A455E, D1152H, P67L, and S945L. Because of the very limited data, 711+3A→G, 
D579G , L206W, R1070W, R117C, R352Q, and S977F do not fulfil the requirement of robust clinical 
data and the modelling did not add new insights to overcome this issue. However, 711+3A→G, 
R1070W, R117C, R352Q, and S977F fulfil the criteria for passing the different thresholds and might 
also be considered acceptably established. For the mutations D579G and L206W, although patient 
numbers are very low, 50% of the patients have a clinically relevant response. Given the rarity of 
these mutations and the difficulty of obtaining what would ordinarily be deemed robust clinical data, 
the sparse but promising data are considered sufficient for these mutations to be included in the 
indication of Symkevi. 
Independent of the method for threshold or calculation, the mutations D110H does not meet any 
criterion and has been removed from the clinical indication. The R347H mutation was already excluded 
from the indication based on an in vitro increase in chloride transport below the pre-defined threshold 
of 10%.  
The rationale for the need for TEZ in a TEZ/IVA combination can be considered somewhat more 
persuasive for patients with missense mutations that express misfolded CFTR protein. Patients with 
missense mutations demonstrated a greater mean treatment difference in both ppFEV1 and sweat 
chloride for TEZ/IVA versus IVA (difference of 2.3 pp ppFEV1 and -8.5 sweat chloride for missense 
mutations; versus 1.9 ppFEV1 and -3.0 sweat chloride for splice mutations). However, in vitro data 
through FRT cell data are absent for non-canonical splice mutations as DNA constructs are not 
available. Patients with such mutations were nonetheless included in study 108. The rationale behind 
inclusion was that non-canonical splice mutations result in low levels of normally folded CFTR protein.  
For the key secondary endpoint CFQ-R Respiratory Domain, the difference of TEZ/IVA compared to 
placebo of 11.1 points and the difference compared to baseline of 10.1 points is clinically relevant as it 
is above the threshold of 4 points. The percentage of subjects who had an increase of at least 4 points 
was higher for TEZ/IVA and IVA compared to placebo: 65.2%, 58.3%, and 32.9% respectively with a 
favourable odds ratio for TEZ/IVA of 7.418 and 1.530 against placebo and IVA, respectively.  
Absolute change in Sweat Chloride (-9.5 mmol/L) and change of BMI (0.34 kg/m2) were all supportive 
for TEZ/IVA. Pulmonary exacerbations occurred in 11 (6.8%) subjects in the TEZ/IVA group, 9 (5.8%) 
subjects in the IVA group, and 19 (11.8%) subjects in the placebo group.  
The estimated event rate of PEx was lower for TEZ/IVA (0.34 events per year) and IVA (0.29 events 
per year) than for placebo (0.63 events per year). Although suggestive for a benefit, exacerbation rate 
is not a reliable parameter measured over such a short time. 
In sub-analyses, TEZ/IVA and IVA treatment resulted in statistically significant improvement over 
placebo regardless of age, sex, baseline lung function, region, use of common CF medications, and P.

aeruginosa colonization. The lowest point estimate is 4.4 difference in the group of patients with low 
baseline FEV1 (ppFEV1 < 40%). The inclusion of patients with ppFEV1 <40, despite the exclusion 
criterion, is caused by a difference in ppFEV1 at screening and at baseline study visit. Although 
TEZ/IVA showed clinically relevant differences over placebo, the benefit over ivacaftor monotherapy is 
small (2.1 percentage points), but is relevant, in relation to an overall estimated annualized ppFEV1 
rate of decline of –1.05 percentage point in F/RF patients. The male and female subgroups had trends 
that were consistent with this finding.  
For pulmonary exacerbations, the reduction of event rate was even higher with monotherapy IVA.  
In the secondary endpoint CFQ-R a numerical higher but not relevant score was observed, but the 
responder analysis showed a somewhat more distinctive difference (65.2 versus 58.3). Thus, there is a 
clinical benefit over ivacaftor in this population of patients with F/RF mutations. For sweat chloride and 
pulmonary exacerbation rate there were no meaningful differences. Taking all data together, there is a 
benefit for TEZ/IVA over ivacaftor monotherapy. Some support is derived from study 101 in patients 
with F/G551D mutations taking TEZ on top of physician described Kalydeco, who had an improvement 
in ppFEV1 of 3.20 percentage points compared to Kalydeco alone, but the duration of the treatment 
period was rather short (28 days).  
The preliminary results of study 110 support the effect maintenance. At Week 16, all groups achieved 
a clinically relevant improvement from baseline for absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1:  5.9 % 
(95% CI: 4.1, 7.7; P<0.0001) in the IVA-TEZ/IVA group, 7.4 % (95% CI: 5.6, 9.1; P<0.0001) in the 
TEZ/IVA group and 4.6 % (95% CI: 2.9, 6.3; P <0.0001) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group. Improvement of 
ppFEV1 was observed at Day 15 for patients on previous placebo treatment as was in the parent study. 
Results of ppFEV1 of the second interim analysis (IA2) showed maintenance of the improvements 
observed during the parent study (0.1 percentage points). The event rate per year of pulmonary 
exacerbation was 0.34 for PBO-TEZ/IVA, 0.39 for IVA-TEZ/IVA and 0.20 for TEZ/IVA in the study 
108/110 PEx efficacy set. This is lower than the event rate for the placebo group in Study 108 (0.63). 
However, the time was very short to allow for firm conclusions. 
The results of the CFQ-R respiratory domain score for the 108/110 efficacy set seems reassuring 
although patient are treated only for 24 or 16 weeks with TEZ/IVA. Symptomatic improvement is not 
so well maintained over the longer term in F/F patients compared to F/RF patients. After 16 weeks of 
TEZ/IVA treatment a numerical increase of 2.6 points in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score after 16 
weeks of TEZ/IVA treatment was observed. The proportion of patients who met or exceeded the MCID 
at the conclusion of Study 108 (53.9%) was maintained through an additional 16 weeks of TEZ/IVA 
treatment in Study 110 (62.2%) and also supports the maintenance of effect.  
A gain in BMI and weight is consistently present from the start with treatment of TEZ/IVA, with an 
additional improvement in BMI of 0.53 (1.11) at week 16 of Study 110. The pivotal study faces the 
concern of the short duration and would not fulfil the requirement as laid down in the CF guideline. 
However, the 16 weeks extension data provided supportive evidence up to 24 weeks. Moreover, as 
already indicated in the CHMP SA support can also be derived for the data in other populations; the 
similar pattern of effect to the CF patients with F/F mutation and the similar early improvement at Day 
15 supports extrapolation of the results in CF patients with F/F mutation to subject with F/RF mutation.  
All patients 
The number of patients ≥ 65 years old are not presented but are limited.  There were 6 patients in this 
age group in the clinical studies. No notable trends were observed in these subjects compared to the 
overall study population. However, as the follow up of the benefit in elderly is warranted, it is part of 
the regular follow-up within the RMP.

Withdrawal effect  
Studies 101 and 103 provide information about treatment withdrawal on ppFEV1. Changes in ppFEV1 
after discontinuation of treatment showed that the improvements in ppFEV1 during 4 weeks of 
TEZ/IVA treatment were lost 1 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of dosing. However, as preservation of 
lung function by a CTFR modifier will need much longer time than 1 month, this loss of effect is not 
considered indicative for long term effects.  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Adolescents were included together with adults in the trials. Subgroup analyses of the primary 
endpoint were done using a model similar to that for the primary analysis. Subgroup analyses showed 
statistically significant and consistent changes in ppFEV1 regardless of age. The changes in ppFEV1 
were similar (study 106) or better (study 108).  
In adolescents with F/F mutation, the decline in ppFEV1 in the TEZ/IVA group is higher compared to 
adults (−0.8 vs. −0.3) in study 110, but the gain observed in subjects in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group in 
study 110 is higher (5.3 pp) than that observed in the parent study 106 at week 24 (3.5 pp) despite 
disease progression may have occurred. The change in weight- and BMI-z scores in subjects in the 
PBO-TEZ/IVA group was higher than observed in study 106. Overall, the treatment effect of 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor on body weight and BMI in study 106 week 24 or in study 110 week 24 was 
modest.   
For adolescents heterozygous for F508del/pre-specified residual function mutations, the improvement 
seen in the parent study 108 was kept or increased after 16 weeks of treatment with 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor in study 110.   
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/F genotype 
Although there is overall consistency in FEV1 response to TEZ/IVA between Phase II and Phase III 
studies, TEZ/IVA was not compared with TEZ alone in Phase III. In Phase II, where TEZ monotherapy 
was evaluated, the data did not consistently demonstrate superiority of TEZ/IVA over TEZ alone in 
ppFEV1 across all TEZ doses and was undermined by small patient numbers. The Phase II data 
indicated consistently greater reductions in sweat chloride with TEZ monotherapy compared with 
TEZ/IVA that has not been adequately explained. There are some discrepancies in the in vitro results, 
with some data supporting a need for IVA and other data suggesting no gain from addition of IVA. 
Furthermore, the failure of TEZ/IVA to increase chloride conductance in FRT cells with adequate 
(overexoressed) levels of F508del is at odds with the result of study 106. The absence of pivotal study 
evidence comparing TEZ/IVA versus TEZ in F508del CFTR patients leaves a number of important 
questions unanswered. Nevertheless, the TEZ/IVA efficacy is supported by a clinically relevant and 
statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1 compared to placebo. The results of the primary 
analysis were confirmed by the sensitivity analysis and by the secondary endpoints such as 
number/rate of exacerbations. Consistent and significant effects on ppFEV1 favouring TEZ/IVA were 
observed across all pre-pecified subgroups. In addition, in a comparison with natural history data, the 
benefit of the treatment is established. Altogether, the data point to the maintenance of the effect seen 
in the parent study 106 after a period of treatment with tezacaftor/ivacaftor of approximately 48 
weeks.

CF patients 12 years or older heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, and a second 
allele with residual function  
The approved indication reflects the currently available evidence collected in patients. The actual and 
precise relationship of the extent of in vitro responsiveness and in vivo effectiveness in patients with 
CF is still unclear and therefore inclusion of CFTR mutations identified as responsive to TEZ/IVA based 
only on the FRT in vitro model is not agreeable to the CHMP and hence, was not pursued by the 
applicant.  
From the clinical data, efficacy is supported by a clinically relevant and statistically significant 
improvement in ppFEV1 compared to placebo. The improvement in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain of 11.1 
points is impressive and substantially above MCID of 4 points during 24 weeks in total. The majority of 
the patients treated with TEZ/IVA achieved an improvement of 4 points. The secondary endpoints 
supported the results of the primary endpoint. Thus overall, the benefit of TEZ/IVA compared to 
placebo is considered demonstrated. Due to the statistical approach statistical significance cannot be 
declared against ivacaftor.  However, overall the data of measuring are short. The similar pattern of 
effect to the CF patients with F/F mutation and the similarity in early improvement at Day 15 provides 
further support.  In addition, as for the patients with F/FF mutation a comparison with natural history 
data, the benefit of the treatment is established.  
TEZ/IVA was also numerically better than IVA alone, indicating the additional effect of tezacaftor to 
ivacaftor. However, the benefit over ivacaftor monotherapy is small (2.1 percentage points), but is 
considered relevant, in relation to an overall estimated annualized ppFEV1 rate of decline of –1.05 
percentage point in F/RF patients. Taking all data together, there appears to be a benefit for TEZ/IVA 
over ivacaftor.  
Finally, the CHMP agreed that Symkevi can be indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 
150 mg tablets for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 12 years and older who are 
homozygous for the F508del mutation or who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have one 
of the following mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene: 
P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 
2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to long term efficacy 
and safety, which was included in RMP as a category 3 study:  
•  Study 110, a phase 3 open label rollover study in subjects aged 12 years and older 
homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety analysis included all safety data available from 14 clinical studies with tezacaftor (TEZ) 
monotherapy or tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA), see Figure 14 below. The core 
safety data consisted of pooled analyses of the 3 completed Phase 3 studies of TEZ/IVA combination 
therapy (Studies 106, 107 and 108) and was called the Phase 3-controlled Safety Set (PC-SS). In the 
core safety data set PC-SS, the majority of patients was White, and 18 years of age or older. The 
median age was approximately 28 years, and 20% of patients was <18 years in both arms. The 
proportion of males and females was similar. Baseline disease characteristics show that the proportion 
of patients distributed across the different ranges of percent predicted FEV1 were similar across the 
TEZ/IVA and placebo groups. Use of concomitant CF medications was similar between the placebo and 
TEZ/IVA groups. Long-term safety of TEZ/IVA in patients with CF was presented from open label

Adverse events 
Nearly all patients in the TEZ/IVA (82.3%) and placebo (86.9%) groups of the PC-SS experienced at 
least one treatment-emergent AE.  Across all AE categories defined in table below, incidences of AEs 
were either similar between the TEZ/IVA and placebo group, or lower in the TEZ/IVA group. Given the 
2- and 4-fold increased durations of exposure in the OLE-SS and LT-SS compared to that of the pooled 
Phase III PC-SS, the incidences of AEs in the OLE-SS and LT-SS did not show any meaningful 
increases. 
Table 37 Overview of Adverse Events: Placebo-controlled Safety Set (PC-SS) 
Common adverse events: The most common AEs (at least 15% incidence in either treatment group) 
were infective pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) of CF and cough, both occurring more frequently in the 
placebo group. Of the AEs with an incidence of at least 5% in either treatment group, the only events 
that were numerically higher in the TEZ/IVA group than in the placebo group were headache (13.7% 
versus 11.3%), nasopharyngitis (11.5% versus 9.7%), and nausea (7.7% versus 6.7%; see table 
below). The type of AEs in the long term safety data sets was similar to the pooled Phase 3 PC-SS. All 
of the proposed TEZ/IVA ADRs appear as ADRs on the Kalydeco label. ADRs that appear on the 
Kalydeco label that did not meet the criteria for TEZ/IVA ADRs are abdominal pain, diarrhoea, 
oropharyngeal pain, nasal congestion, rash, and upper respiratory tract infection.

Table 38 AEs with an incidence of at least 5% in either treatment group by preferred term 
(PC-SS) 
Related adverse events: In the PC-SS, the incidences of AEs considered by the investigator to be 
related to study drug were similar between the placebo group (22.2%) and TEZ/IVA group (23.6%), 
see table below. The incidences of related AEs across SOCs and PTs were also similar between the 
placebo and TEZ/IVA groups. A similar safety profile regarding related AEs was observed in the OLE-SS 
and LT-SS analyses.

Adverse events by severity: The majority of AEs in both the placebo and TEZ/IVA treatment groups 
were mild or moderate in severity. There were no imbalances in the incidence of mild (Grade 1), 
moderate (Grade 2), severe (Grade 3), or life-threatening (Grade 4) AEs between the placebo and 
TEZ/IVA group; see table below. 
Table 40 Incidence of AEs by Severity: PC-SS 
There were no imbalances in the incidence of Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs in the TEZ/IVA group (7.1%) 
relative to the placebo group (8.5%). Most of the Grade 3 or 4 AEs were respiratory and 
gastrointestinal events, please refer to the table below. Infective PEx of CF and haemoptysis were the 
only Grade 3 or 4 AEs that had an incidence of at least 1% in either treatment group.

Two subjects in the PC-SS had life-threatening (Grade 4) AEs that were considered possibly related to 
study drug by the investigator including 1 patient in the placebo group (mental status changes, acute 
respiratory failure, pneumothorax, infective PEx of CF, and pneumonia) and 1 patient in the TEZ/IVA 
group (haemoptysis). Grade 3 (severe) or Grade 4 (life-threatening) AEs occurred in 10.3% of patients 
in the OLE-SS and 16.3% of patients in the LT-SS. In the OLE-SS, no imbalances were observed in the 
incidences of Grade 1-4 AEs between the Placebo-TEZ/IVA and Active-TEZ/IVA group. The type of the 
most common Grade 3-4 AEs in the long term safety data sets was similar to the PC-SS. 
Adverse Events by Time of Onset: An analysis of AEs over time was done using the longest placebo-
controlled study, Study 106. Over 8-week intervals, the onset of AEs was generally higher in the first 8 
weeks of treatment in both the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups. There were no clinically meaningful 
trends or patterns in the incidence of AEs by time. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The incidence of SAEs was higher in the placebo group (14.9%) than in the TEZ/IVA group (10.1%). 
The only SAEs that occurred in ≥1% of patients in either treatment group were infective PEx of CF 
(6.7% TEZ/IVA vs. 10.3% placebo) and hemoptysis (1% vs. 1.2%).

Treatment Group by Preferred Term: PC-SS 
There were no deaths reported in the TEZ/IVA clinical development program. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Liver-related Adverse Events: Due to transaminase elevations being common in CF, and observed in 
some patients while receiving Kalydeco, a comprehensive review of the PC-SS data was conducted for 
AEs associated with elevated transaminases. The incidences of subjects with elevated transaminase 
events were low and similar between the placebo (3.6%) and TEZ/IVA (3.4%) groups. There were also 
low incidences of elevated transaminase events leading to discontinuation in the placebo (0.4%) and 
Assessment report

TEZ/IVA (0.2%) groups. The majority of the elevated transaminase events were mild or moderate in 
severity. There were no elevated transaminase events that were considered serious. The incidences of 
subjects with other AEs in the hepatobiliary SOC were similar between the placebo (0.8%) and 
TEZ/IVA (0.4%) groups. There were no SAEs in the hepatobiliary SOC. The incidence and patterns of 
events for subjects who received ≥48 weeks of TEZ/IVA (LT-SS) remained lowed (6.7%) and similar to 
the incidence in subjects in PC-SS (3.6% in the placebo group and 3.4% in the TEZ/IVA group). 
Respiratory Adverse Events and Spirometry: Due to the warning and precaution about respiratory AEs 
in the label for Orkambi, which has the same mechanism of action as TEZ/IVA, respiratory AEs and 
serial post-dose spirometry were evaluated in the TEZ/IVA Phase 3 studies. The incidence of subjects 
with respiratory events was numerically lower for TEZ/IVA (11.3%) than placebo (14.7%). No 
individual respiratory events occurred in a greater incidence in subjects in the TEZ/IVA group than in 
the placebo group. All respiratory events were mild to moderate in severity. No subjects in the 
TEZ/IVA group had an event leading to discontinuation. A subanalysis of PTs related to respiratory 
symptoms (i.e., chest discomfort, dyspnea, and respiration abnormal) demonstrated a lower incidence 
in TEZ/IVA (8.9%) than placebo (11.5%). No apparent pattern of time course in the onset of 
respiratory events or respiratory symptoms was identified from the Study 106 or Study 110 data. 
In the PC-SS, subjects <18 years of age had postdose spirometry assessments to detect any postdose 
decline in ppFEV1. On Days 1 and 15, the postdose (2 and 4 hour) ppFEV1 values showed no evidence 
of decline from the pre-dose ppFEV1 for the placebo or TEZ/IVA groups. A subgroup analysis of AEs by 
baseline lung disease (baseline ppFEV1 <40, ≥40 to<70, or ≥70) found a trend of lower incidence of 
respiratory adverse events for subjects receiving TEZ/IVA compared to placebo for all subgroups, 
including those with the most severe lung disease (ppFEV1 <40). 
Laboratory findings 
Overall, there were no clinically important adverse trends attributable to TEZ/IVA dosing identified in 
vital sign assessments, haematology parameters, lipid/vitamin or amylase/lipase values in patients in 
the pooled Phase 3 placebo controlled safety set. Furthermore, in the placebo controlled safety set, 
there were no clinically meaningful differences in any ECG parameter between TEZ/IVA and placebo. 
Earlier safety data in healthy volunteers suggest that VX-661 and its major metabolites may have low 
potential for drug-induced QT prolongation. A QT/QTc study was performed and showed no clinically 
relevant trends in standard ECG parameters, including no clinically significant increases or decreases 
over time in mean HR in patients receiving TEZ, compared to patients receiving placebo or 
moxifloxacin. There were no obvious differences between the therapeutic and supratherapeutic TEZ 
doses. No evidence was observed for QT prolongation, and no subject receiving TEZ at therapeutic and 
supratherapeutic doses had QTcF interval of >450 msec, or increase of >60 msec.  
Due to existing warnings and precautions for IVA related to cataracts, ophthalmologic assessments 
were performed. Only Study 106 was long enough (24-week treatment duration) to allow detection of 
treatment-emergent cataracts. In this study, the incidences of treatment-emergent cataracts (not 
present at baseline) were 5.2% in the placebo group and 6.9% in the TEZ/IVA group. The incidence of 
resolved cataracts (present at baseline and not present at the follow-up exam) were 25% in the 
placebo group and 33% in the TEZ/IVA groups. There were no SAEs or discontinuations due to 
cataracts in the TEZ/IVA group.  
In order to investigate whether the findings of lacteal dilation in nonclinical species translated to a 
human finding of small bowel dysfunction, Study 103 included VCE assessments to evaluate the 
appearance of the small bowel at screening and after 12 weeks of dosing. There was no evidence of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 139/165 
 
 
 
 
 
clinically meaningful changes in gastrointestinal function observed in VCE at Week 13, or in laboratory 
data or AEs after up to a minimum of 40 weeks and maximum of 48 weeks of treatment (OLE phase) 
with TEZ/IVA. 
Phase 3 studies included monitoring of nutritional laboratory values (vitamins, lipids), and no 
meaningful findings related to decreased nutritional status were observed. No evidence of BMI 
decrease was observed in patients who received up to 48 weeks of treatment with TEZ/IVA in Phase 3 
studies.  
Safety in special populations 
Age: Of 1001 patients who received study drug, 199 patients (19.8%) were ≥12 to <18 years of age 
years of age. The safety profile of TEZ/IVA was similar between these patients and patients ≥18 years 
of age. Data in patients ≥65 years old are limited. 
Gender: Approximately equal proportions of females (50.5%) and males (49.5%) were included in the 
PC-SS. The most common AEs by PT for males and females were similar to the most common AEs 
observed in patients overall. The only SAE to occur in >10% of patients overall in any group was 
infective PEx of CF, which had a higher incidence for females than males. 
Race: A subgroup analysis by race was not conducted for any of the Pooled Safety Sets, as the number 
of subjects in the other racial subgroups was too small for reliable comparative analyses. 
Renal Impairment: Renal clearance was not expected to play a major role in the elimination of TEZ and 
IVA. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC. Caution is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment or end-
stage renal disease.  
Hepatic Impairment: Hepatic metabolism plays a major role in the elimination of TEZ and IVA. 
Moderate hepatic impairment increased TEZ and IVA exposures, and a reduced dose is recommended. 
There is no experience with TEZ/IVA with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, its use is not 
recommended in section 4.2 of the SmPC, unless the benefits outweigh the risks. In such cases, 
TEZ/IVA should be used in a reduced dose. 
CFTR Genotype: There were no meaningful differences in safety profile of TEZ/IVA in Studies 106, 107, 
or 108. The frequency of AEs in the two pivotal Phase 3 studies (Study 106: patients homozygous for 
the F508del mutation and Study 108: patients heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, with a 
second CFTR mutation predicted to have residual function) were summarized in the tables below.

Baseline ppFEV1: there were no clinically meaningful differences in the pattern of adverse events rates 
related to severity of lung disease at baseline between TEZ/IVA and placebo. 
Geographic Region: There were no clinically meaningful trends associated with geographic region. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation: The effects of TEZ and IVA on conception, pregnancy, and lactation in 
humans are largely unknown. Given the limited data available on pregnancy outcomes after TEZ/IVA 
exposure during pregnancy or lactation, TEZ/IVA combination therapy should not be used during 
pregnancy or lactation unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the potential risk.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuation of study drug: The rate for AE leading to treatment discontinuation was low and 
balanced in the PC-SS: 2.0% for placebo and 1.6% for TEZ/IVA. The only AE occurring in at least 2 
patients leading to treatment discontinuation that had a higher incidence in the TEZ/IVA group (0.4%; 
2 patients) than the placebo group (0 patients) was abdominal pain. 
Interruption of study drug: The incidence of AEs leading to treatment interruption was low and 
balanced between the placebo (3.6%) and TEZ/IVA (2.4%) group. There were no AEs leading to 
treatment interruption occurring in >1% of patients in either treatment group. The only AE occurring in 
at least 2 patients leading to treatment discontinuation that had a higher incidence in the TEZ/IVA 
group was distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) (0.6%, 3 patients vs. 0 patients in the 
placebo group. The 3 events of DIOS were considered not related to treatment. 
Post marketing experience 
Symkevi has not been marketed and thus, there is no post marketing experience. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient population and exposure 
Main safety data was derived from pooled analyses of the 3 completed Phase 3 studies of TEZ/IVA 
combination therapy (Studies 106, 107 and 108). In this Phase III controlled safety set (PC-SS), 496 
patients received TEZ/IVA and 505 patients received placebo. Mean treatment duration was 16 weeks 
in both groups. Long-term safety of TEZ/IVA in patients with CF was presented from open label 
extension Study 110 (OLE-SS). Furthermore, long-term safety data was presented separately for a 
selection of these patients, i.e. those with minimal 48 weeks of TEZ/IVA exposure (long term safety 
data set, LT-SS). Mean treatment duration was approximately 2-fold in the OLE Study (33.5 weeks) 
compared to the PC-SS, and 4-fold in the LT-SS (69 weeks). More than 100 patients (i.e. n=326) have 
been exposed to TEZ/IVA combination therapy for at least 48 weeks in line with the guidelines on 
minimum exposure data for safety analyses of long-term therapy. In response to the CHMP’s request, 
the applicant recalculated exposure duration, accounting for interruptions and discontinuations. 
Recalculated exposure data were, similar to original exposure data, well balanced between treatment 
arms.  
Adverse events, serious adverse events and deaths 
Nearly all patients in both arms of the PC-SS experienced at least one treatment-emergent AE (82.3% 
of patients in the TEZ/IVA arm and 86.9% in the placebo arm). The most common AEs (respiratory 
and gastrointestinal events) in patients who received TEZ/IVA in clinical studies were mild to moderate 
in severity and were common manifestations typical for patients with CF. The only TEAEs with an 
incidence of at least 5% in either treatment group, that were numerically higher in the TEZ/IVA group 
than in the placebo group, were headache (13.7% versus 11.3%), nasopharyngitis (11.5% versus 
9.7%), and nausea (7.7% versus 6.7%). Related AEs occurred in similar frequencies between the 
TEZ/IVA (23.6%) and placebo group (22.2%). In response to the CHMP’s request, the applicant 
provided further reassurance that the incidences of related AEs in the TEZ/IVA group were consistently 
lower or similar to the incidence in the placebo group in the PC-SS. There was no increase in the 
incidence of related AEs in the OLE-SS and LT-SS, when considering the increased exposure in the long 
term safety sets. Grade 3-4 AEs were also reported with similar frequencies in both arms. Infective PEx 
Assessment report

Page 143/165 
 
 
 
 
 
of CF and haemoptysis were the only Grade 3 or 4 AEs that had an incidence of at least 1% in either 
treatment group. 
Analysis of AEs over time was done using the longest placebo controlled study 106. In this study, the 
onset of AEs was generally higher in the first 8 weeks of treatment in both arms. The rate for AE 
leading to treatment discontinuation (1.6% TEZ/IVA vs. 2% placebo) or treatment interruption (2.4% 
vs. 3.6%) in the PC-SS was low and balanced. Infective PEx of CF was the most common AE leading to 
treatment discontinuation, which could be expected for patients with CF. 
The incidence of SAEs was lower in the TEZ/IVA group (10.1%), than in the placebo group (14.9%), 
driven largely by a reduced incidence of infective PEx of CF events in subjects in the TEZ/IVA group. 
There were no serious liver-related or respiratory AEs, as previously observed with Kalydeco or 
Orkambi.  
No deaths were reported in the TEZ/IVA clinical development program. 
The long term safety data sets OLE-SS and LT-SS showed increased frequencies of (related AEs), 
Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation with TEZ/IVA compared to the 
pooled Phase III PC-SS. However, it is agreed with the applicant that this is probably related to the 
increased mean exposure in the long term safety data sets (2-4 fold compared to the PC-SS). 
Moreover, the placebo-TEZ/IVA arm in the OLE-SS, that received TEZ/IVA for a much shorter time 
period compared to the Active-TEZ/IVA arm, showed a similar pattern. The type of AEs was similar to 
the pooled Phase 3 PC-SS, and consistent with AEs commonly observed in subjects with CF. As in the 
pooled Phase 3 PC-SS, the majority of subjects had AEs that were mild or moderate in the long term 
safety data sets. A few immunological events have been reported, but none of the events that occurred 
among patients treated with TEZ/IVA were considered related to TEZ/IVA or resulted in treatment 
discontinuation, and all of these events were attributed to alternative aetiologies.  
Adverse events of special interest 
Hepatic toxicity is a known adverse event for Kalydeco and Orkambi. Liver-related AEs occurred in 
similar frequencies in the TEZ/IVA and placebo treatment groups in the PC-SS, and no serious elevated 
transaminase events were observed. However, in the Symkevi trials, exclusion criteria for patients with 
pre-existing liver function impairments were more stringent compared to the Orkambi trials. In the 
Symkevi trials patients were excluded when 2 out of the defined impairments were present while in the 
Orkambi trial this was the case for 3 out of these impairments. It is therefore not possible to directly 
compare the risk for hepatic toxicity in Orkambi and Symkevi. Despite the low incidence of liver related 
AEs in the current clinical trials with TEZ/IVA, it is therefore endorsed that a warning regarding the 
potential risk for elevated transaminases has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC (similar to 
Kalydeco and Orkambi), and that it has been included as important potential risk in the summary of 
safety specifications in the RMP. 
Due to the warning and precaution about respiratory AEs in the label for Orkambi, respiratory AEs and 
serial post-dose spirometry were evaluated in the TEZ/IVA Phase 3 studies. No clinically meaningful 
trends in the respiratory-related AEs or postdose spirometry data were observed, including those for 
patients with ppFEV1 <40 at baseline. 
Safety in special populations 
No clinically relevant differences in safety profile of TEZ/IVA between patients ≥12 to <18 years of age 
and ≥18 years of age have been observed. Upon request the applicant presented safety data of 
patients ≥65 years. It is acknowledged that data in the elderly population (>65 years) were very 
limited, as cystic fibrosis leads to a shortened life expectancy. Only 6 patients in the 3 placebo-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/567306/2018  
Page 144/165 
 
 
 
 
 
controlled Phase 3 clinical studies were aged 65 years or older at screening. Of these 6 patients, 4 
received TEZ/IVA. Due to the small number of patients in this age group, no final conclusions 
regarding safety can be drawn. It is nevertheless reassuring that no apparent new safety signals were 
observed. 
The patient populations in the respective individual studies of the PC-SS differ substantially, as 
patients from numerous genotypes were included. Patients homozygous for the F508del mutation, as 
included in Study 106 generally have a relatively rapid disease progression, whereas mutations that 
result in a more modest reduction in CFTR mediated chloride transport (residual function CFTR 
mutation), may result in CF that is more slowly progressive. It is therefore anticipated that patients 
included in Study 108 might show a better safety profile compared to patients in Study 106. As this 
might influence the overall safety profile as observed in the PC-SS, the safety results have been 
assessed for the 3 separate Phase III Studies as well.  
The individual study reports of the three Phase III studies included in the integrated PC-SS analysis 
showed that AEs and SAEs indeed occurred most frequently in Study 106 (90.4% AE and 12.4% SAE 
Study 106 vs. 72.2% and 4.9% Study 108). However, a similar pattern is observed in the placebo 
arms of these studies. Moreover, differences in related (S)AEs and Grade 3-4 AEs between the three 
studies were less pronounced. In addition, the longer duration of study 106 compared to study 108 is 
prone to a higher incidence of AEs due to the longer exposure. Altogether, it is reassuring that as 
observed with the integrated PC-SS, the safety profile of TEZ/IVA treatment in the individual studies 
was similar or sometimes even better compared to the respective placebo arms. 
The applicant also proposed to conduct a non-interventional post-authorization safety study (PASS) as 
per GVP Module VIII (EMA/813938/2011 Rev 3*). This registry study is expected provide further 
reassurance on the safety profile of the tezacaftor/ ivacaftor combination but the lack of a concurrent 
non-treated cohort is a significant unavoidable methodological limitation of the study. Taking into 
account that no new significant safety concerns have so far been identified with tezacaftor/ ivacaftor, 
the experience to date with ivacaftor, and the methodological limitations with the proposed registry 
study, it is accepted that the study be included in the RMP as a category 3 study. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
No significant new or additional safety concerns were identified with the addition of TEZ to IVA. The 
safety profile of TEZ/IVA appeared similar across studies. There were no latent, late onset safety 
issues or risks identified in the long term safety sets. TEZ/IVA was well tolerated with low 
discontinuation rates due to AEs.  
The CHMP considers the following measure necessary to address issues related to safety, which is 
included in the RMP as category 3 study:  
•  A non-interventional post-authorization safety study (PASS). This registry study is expected 
provide further reassurance on the safety profile of the tezacaftor/ ivacaftor combination but 
the lack of a concurrent non-treated cohort is a significant unavoidable methodological 
limitation of the study. The protocol is expected to be submitted by the end of December 2018.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 12 Feb 2018. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of tezacaftor with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers tezacaftor contained in the fixed combination 
medicinal product - Symkevi - to be a new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union. Ivacaftor was considered to be a known 
active substance. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to omit all particulars from the immediate labelling has been submitted by the applicant and 
has been found unacceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
The product will be marketed as film-coated tablets supplied in blisters sealed in a wallet card. The 
company requested to omit printing of the minimum particulars on the blister foil as patients will not 
be able to see it, and separation from the wallet card would obliterate any printing on the blister, 
making it illegible. 
The QRD Group rejected the request to omit completely particulars on the blister foil since there is no 
guarantee that the blister cannot be separated from the wallet. The Group requested to have the 
minimum particulars to be printed on the blister foil as follows: Invented name, strength, INN, EXP and 
Lot.

A request of translation exemption of the immediate labelling has been submitted by the applicant and 
has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
The only particulars which would need translation on the blister foil are the INN, EXP and Lot. The 
Group agreed to have these particulars in English only.  
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Symkevi (tezacaftor / ivacaftor) is included 
in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was 
not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities and 
high premature mortality, and at present, there is no cure. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene 
that result in absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface that regulates salt and 
water absorption and secretion. The failure to regulate chloride transport results in the accumulation of 
thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, impaired intestinal 
absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride concentration. Lung disease is the 
primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF. 
The claimed indication is: 
Symkevi is indicated in a combination regimen with Kalydeco (ivacaftor 150 mg tablet) for the 
treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the 
F508del mutation or who have at least one mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR) gene that is responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor based on in vitro and/or clinical 
evidence (see section 5.1). 
In section 5.1 the list of approved mutations was displayed. 
The proposed indication was not acceptable to the CHMP, due to the lack of reliable clinical data for 
some mutations. Since the inclusion of mutations based on in vitro data is not agreeable, there is no 
need for a reference to an explanatory table in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Hence, the wording was 
amended as follows:  
Symkevi is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of 
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del 
mutation or who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have one of the following mutations in 
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, 
A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 
3849+10kbC→T. 
Symkevi (TEZ/IVA) consists of two substances, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, that work by improving 
activity of CFTR in the lungs. Treatment with Symkevi is expected to thin the abnormal secretions, 
reduce symptoms of the disease and improve lung function. For the patients with CF heterozygous for 
the F508del/RF mutation, the indication reflects the clinical data collected in patients with RF-CFTR 
mutations identified as responsive to TEZ/IVA in in-vitro data models.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The vast majority of CF therapies target the symptoms of the disease such as nutritional supplements, 
antibiotics, and mucolytics. A few years ago, CFTR modulators became available which have the 
potency to modify the progress of the disease. Two CFTR modulators are approved for the treatment of 
CF in the EU, Kalydeco (ivacaftor) and Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor).

KALYDECO 
•  Kalydeco tablets are indicated for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 6 
years and older and weighing 25 kg or more who have one of the following gating (class III) 
mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, 
S549N or S549R.  
•  Kalydeco tablets are also indicated for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 
18 years and older who have an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene 
•  Kalydeco granules are indicated for the treatment of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 2 
years and older and weighing less than 25 kg who have one of the following gating (class III) 
mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, 
S549N or S549R 
ORKAMBI 
•  Orkambi is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older 
who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. 
Symkevi (tezacaftor + ivacaftor) is a combination therapy combining the CFTR corrector tezacaftor, a 
compound designed to move the defective CFTR protein to the proper place in the airway cell surface, 
with the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor, which helps facilitate the opening of the chloride channel on the 
cell surface to allow chloride and sodium (salt) to move in and out of the cell. The distinction between 
correctors and potentiators is nonetheless questioned in the scientific literature due to the 
interdependence of chloride channel opening and CFTR subcellular localisation on protein folding.  
Symkevi targets several CFTR genotypes for which approved modulator therapies are not available. 
The F508del/Residual Function (RF) mutations represent ~ 9% of the CF population. The patients who 
harbour a mutation with a residual function are characterised by slower disease progression than the 
homozygous F508 population, but they will eventually experience the clinical consequences of CF 
including a reduced lifespan. However, it is difficult to quantify the difference in survival or the 
development of irreversible damage over a short trial period considering the slower progression of 
disease.  
TEZ/IVA is also claimed to be an alternative for patients, who are homozygous for F508del and cannot 
tolerate or take LUM/IVA because of serious adverse events or certain concomitant medications, 
respectively.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Efficacy and safety of Symkevi was supported by three key trials. The trials investigated tezacaftor 100 
mg qd/ivacaftor 150 mg q12h.  
Study 106 in CF patients 12 years or older is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group study in subjects homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. A total of 510 subjects were 
randomized. Placebo was used as the control treatment. Study 106 was powered for ppFEV1 and 
pulmonary exacerbations and provided 24 weeks data. 
Study 108 in CF patients 12 years or older is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active 
controlled, crossover study in subjects aged 12 years and older, heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR 
mutation, and a second allele with a CFTR mutation predicted to have residual function. Alongside

placebo, ivacaftor was deemed necessary because in vitro and clinical data supported the potential 
efficacy of IVA monotherapy. Study 108 was powered for ppFEV1 and provided 8 weeks data. 
Study 110 is an open-label rollover study that enrolled subjects from the Phase 2 and 3 studies of 
TEZ/IVA. This study is designed to support persistence of efficacy and long-term safety and is part of 
the RMP. An interim analysis is submitted allowing for evaluation of the persistence of efficacy. As of 
the interim (IA1) cut-off date, 870 subjects had been enrolled from 4 parent studies among 462 
subjects from Study 106 with additional 24 week treatment and 223 subjects from Study 108 with 
additional 16 week treatment. Data from 70% of the enrolled patients were analysed. Summarised 
data of a second interim analysis (IA2) of study 110 became available from 100% of the enrolled 
patients during the assessment.  
Two additional studies are submitted providing results for further insight about mutations possibly 
beneficial for treatment with TEZ/IVA: Study 104 in CF patients 12 years or older with the F/F 
genotype and study 107 in CF patients 12 years or older heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, 
and a second allele not likely to respond to TEZ/IVA or ivacaftor therapy (F508del/NR).  
Study 109 was also submitted, which compared TEZ/IVA with IVA in 156 subjects aged 12 years and 
older with CF who are heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and a second CFTR allele with a 
gating defect that is clinically demonstrated to be IVA-responsive. However, this study failed to show 
beneficial effect over ivacaftor. 
Dose finding was performed in two phase 2 studies. Study 101 and Study 103 evaluated different 
doses TEZ monotherapy and TEZ/IVA combination therapy in adult subjects with F/F genotype and 
study 101 also in adult and adolescent subjects with F/G551D. 
Potential QTc prolongation has been evaluated in Study VX15-661-010 in 116 healthy volunteers for 
therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of TEZ compared with placebo and moxifloxacin. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/F genotype 
Changes in sweat chloride test, representing a pharmacodynamic parameter for the activity of a CTFR 
modulator, showed a decrease of -9.9 in the group treated with TEZ/IVA versus 0.2 for the placebo 
group.  TEZ/IVA (n= 510) showed a statistically highly significant mean treatment difference in 
absolute change of ppFEV1 from baseline through week 24 of 4.0 % compared to placebo; 3.4% for 
TEZ/IVA and – 0.6% for placebo (P<0.0001), a difference that was already observed on Day 15. The 
improvements were sustained during the treatment period (3.5 % at week 24), while in the placebo 
group a gradual decrease of -1.3 % has been observed. In patients with ppFEV1 < 40%, an increase of 
3.5 % in ppFEV1 was observed. Preliminary results of the open label extension study 110 support the 
maintenance of the effect as an absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 of 3.1 % in the TEZ/IVA 
group and 4.5 % in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group at week 24 was observed. An improvement of ppFEV1 was 
already demonstrated at Day 15 in patients on previous placebo treatment. In adolescents, the mean 
(95%CI) absolute change from Study 110 baseline in ppFEV1 at week 24 in study 110 was 5.3 
percentage points (3.9, 6.8) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group and -0.8 pp (−2.3, 0.7) in the TEZ/IVA group.  
Consistent improvements in ppFEV1 favouring TEZ/IVA were observed across all prespecified 
subgroups: age, sex, baseline lung function, region, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, and baseline 
use of common CF medications. The lowest point estimate was a 3.5 % difference in the group of 
patients with ppFEV1 < 40% and in females. No CI of any subgroup crossed 0.

For the secondary endpoints, the estimated event rate of pulmonary exacerbations was lower in the 
TEZ/IVA group (0.64 events per year) compared with the placebo group (0.99 events per year) being 
statistically significant. The difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups in CFQ-R respiratory 
domain score was 5.1 points, i.e. 5.0 and -0.1 for TEZ/IVA and placebo respectively (P<0.0001). As 
indicative for nutritional status, the absolute change in BMI was numerically favourable for TEZ/IVA 
when compared to placebo: an increase of 0.18 kg/m2 compared to 0.12 kg/m2, respectively (p = 
0.4127). The increase in BMI continued to 0.26 kg/m2 in study 110. In adolescents, the mean (95%CI) 
absolute change from Study 110 baseline at week 16 in study 110 in BMI Z-value was 0.10 (0.00, 
0.19) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group and −0.04 (−0.13, 0.06) in the TEZ/IVA group and in weight-z value 
0.06 (0.04) kg in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group and −0.02 (0.04) kg in the TEZ/IVA group. Further analyses 
of the data of the second interim analysis with all adolescent patients with using MMRM analysis 
showed similar trends. The other secondary endpoints were overall supportive, some only numerically, 
some were statistically significant.  
In study 104 in 94 patients, the LS mean absolute change from baseline through Week 16 in ppFEV1 
was in the ivacaftor group 1.5377% and in the placebo group -0.1826% (P = 0.1509). In the open 
label extension phase, the improvement in FEV1 in the parent part was not sustained through Week 
64. The difference in decrease in sweat chloride was -2.87 mmol/L between the ivacaftor group and 
the placebo group (P = 0.0384).  
CF patients 12 years or older heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, and a second 
allele with residual function 
TEZ/IVA treatment (n=162) resulted in an increase in absolute change in ppFEV1 averaged for Week 4 
and Week 8 of 6.5% with a difference of 6.8 % compared to placebo (n=162). The LS mean treatment 
difference compared to IVA (n = 157) was 2.1 % in favour of TEZ/IVA, both comparisons being 
statistically significant. The sensitivity analysis showed similar results. In patients with ppFEV1 < 40%, 
an increase of 4.4 % in ppFEV1 was observed. In patients ≤ 18 years , the mean (95%CI) absolute 
change from baseline in ppFEV1 at week 24 in study 110 was 7.2 pp (4.8, 9.7) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA 
group, 1.6 pp (−1.5, 4.8) in the IVA-TEZ/IVA group and 0.7 (−2.2, 3.6) in the TEZ/IVA group. 
Consistent improvements in ppFEV1 favouring TEZ/IVA were observed across the pre-specified 
subgroups, age, sex, baseline lung function, region, use of common CF medications, P. aeruginosa 
colonization. 
For the key secondary endpoint CFQ-R Respiratory Domain, the LS mean difference of TEZ/IVA 
compared to placebo was 11.1 points and compared to baseline of 10.1 points (both statistically 
significant). The LS mean difference with IVA was 1.4. The percentage of subjects who had an increase 
of at least 4 points was higher for TEZ/IVA and IVA when compared to placebo: 65.2%, 58.3%, and 
32.9%, respectively. Differences in absolute change in sweat chloride and BMI were higher in TEZ/IVA 
compared to placebo. The change in sweat chloride was -9.9, -4.5 and 0.2 mmol/l for TEZ/IVA, IVA 
and placebo respectively, while for BMI 0.34, 0.47 and 0.18 kg/m2. The results of the CFQ-R 
respiratory domain score of 9.9 points appears reassuring for 24 week (TEZ/IVA) or 16 weeks (PBO-
TEZ/IVA, IVA-TEZ/IVA) treatment with TEZ/IVA. A gain in BMI (0.34 kg/m2) and weight is consistently 
apparent when patients start with treatment of TEZ/IVA. In study 110, the mean absolute change (SE) 
from Study 110 baseline in BMI-z value for subjects <18 years old was 0.04 (0.05) in the PBO-
TEZ/IVA group and -0.13 (0.07) in the IVA-TEZ/IVA group and 0.16 (0.06) in the TEZ/IVA group. 
Interim results of study 110 in 70%of the patients showed that the improvements in ppFEV1 during 
the placebo controlled phase was further improved with 0.1 percentage points in patients treated with 
TEZ/IVA in study 108. For CFQ-R a further increase of 2.6 points was demonstrated. The PEx event 
rate was lower for the TEZ/IVA group (0.34 events per year) than for the placebo group (0.63 events

per year). In Study 110, subjects who continued TEZ/IVA in Study 110 maintained a low PEx event 
rate of 0.20 events per year at the time of IA1 and 0.22 events per year at the time of IA2. The risk of 
PEx that led to hospitalization or IV antibiotic treatment was 12.9%, while in the CFF Registry the risk 
of PEx ranged from 27.0% to 31.6% from 2012 to 2014. However, the exacerbation rate even 
annualised, is not a reliable parameter measured over such a short time period, i.e., 8 weeks in study 
108 and 16 weeks in study 110. 
In Study 101, patients with F/G551D mutations taking TEZ on top of physician described Kalydeco 
showed an improvement in ppFEV1 of 3.20 percentage points compared to Kalydeco alone, 
demonstrating a treatment benefit in a gating mutation.  
CF patients 12 years or older heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, and a second 
mutation that is not likely to respond to TEZ and/or IVA therapy (F508del/NR) 
In study 107 in patients with F508del/NR mutation, the difference in absolute change in ppFEV1 
between TEZ/IVA and placebo group was 1.2 % (95% CI: -0.3, 2.6; P = 0.1176). The 1-sided 80% 
UCB was below the predefined futility boundary of 2.5%.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Dose regimen and drug-drug interactions 
When TEZ/IVA was compared with TEZ alone across a range of TEZ and IVA doses in Phase II, (study 
101) in patients homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, the proposed combination regimen TEZ 
100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h demonstrated the greatest improvement in ppFEV1. However, a low dose 
of TEZ alone (10 mg q.d.) apparently demonstrated an effect on ppFEV1 that was not dissimilar to the 
combination in the proposed higher dose regimen, leaving a question over the possibility of a negative 
pharmacodynamic interaction between TEZ and IVA. The lack of robustness of the study due to small 
patient numbers does not allay this concern. Moreover, a greater reduction in sweat chloride was 
demonstrated with TEZ monotherapy, compared with the TEZ/IVA combination, at the highest doses.  
For ppFEV1, the treatment effects for the combination therapy compared to placebo ranged from 1.44 
to 3.89, and for the monotherapy from 1.74 to 3.63, with the greatest treatment effect at the lowest 
TEZ dose of 10 mg qd.  The model, within the limitations, appears to be more accurate for FEV1 than 
sweat chloride but cannot be considered conclusive. The need for IVA in a FDC combination of TEZ/IVA 
to treat F/F patients is not considered to be established and the absence of a pivotal study evidence 
comparing TEZ/IVA versus TEZ in F508del CFTR patients leaves a number of important questions 
unanswered.  
Both, TEZ and IVA, are substrate for CYP3A4, an enzyme for which potentially important genetic 
variation has been reported (i.e. CYP3A4*22) that may lead to TEZ and IVA exposures comparable to 
those obtained when given in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. For this reason, either 
additional information on the genetic profile of patients included in the studies with respect to this 
enzyme, or additional in vivo data in healthy subjects should be provided. In both situations, further 
analysis of the potential relationship between TEZ and IVA exposure (AUC, Cmax and Ctrough) and 
genotype in subjects with CYP3A4*22 genotype and subjects with CYP3A4 wild-type phenotype is 
being requested. Based on the outcome of this analysis, potential consequences of such 
pharmacogenetic variations related to CYP3A4 for exposure and/or dose advice should be further 
discussed. Additional information will be provided post-approval on the substrate, inhibiting and 
inducing characteristics of TEZ and metabolites, as well as IVA and its metabolites, and towards a 
number of enzymes and transporters, in order to be able to predict potential consequences for drug-

drug interactions. These results will be submitted in post-authorisation phase (included in the RMP) 
and this is agreed by the CHMP. 
All patients  
Only 6 patients ≥ 65 years of age were included, all in study 108 for patients with F/RF mutations, 
which is also reflected in the SmPC.  
Only interim data from study 110 is available for a total treatment duration of up to 48 weeks for 
patients with F/F genotype and 24 weeks for patients with F/RF genotype, although the study is 
planned to provide up to a follow-up safety and efficacy duration of 120 and 104 weeks respectively. 
The applicant committed to report the full data from this study in the post-authorisation phase. 
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/F genotype 
The reduction in sweat chloride is only modest, given that homozygous F508del/F508del patients have 
baseline sweat chloride in the region of 100 mmol/L. Based on natural history data, mutations with 
residual CFTR activity with sweat chloride levels of approximately 10% lower than severe mutations, 
such as homozygous F508del/F508del patients, have less severe disease manifestations or 
demonstrate a delay in onset. The reduction is therefore acceptably relevant. In the second interim 
analysis of the open label extension study 110, using study 110 baseline, a loss of 0.5 percentage 
points in ppFEV1 was observed during the additional 24 weeks. This appears acceptable as it is lower 
than the annualized loss in this group of patients with F/F mutation i.e., −1.91 percentage points5.   
The initial improvement in CFQ-R was partly maintained (-1.3 point). In the responder analysis 51.3% 
patients treated with TEZ/IVA were responders after 24 weeks (study 106) and 48.6% after 48 weeks 
(study 110) compared with placebo 35.7%. The percentage of undernourished adolescents was 
considerably higher compared to the adults (69.8% vs. 17.5% respectively). In this group of 
undernourished patients no clinically meaningful within-group changes in BMI z-score were observed.  
The event rate of PEx was 0.72 after 24 weeks in Study 110. Moreover, in patients who started 
TEZ/IVA in either Study 106 (parent study) or Study 110, the risk of PEx that led to hospitalization or 
IV antibiotic treatment was 29.6%.  
CF patients 12 years or older heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, and a second 
allele with residual function 
For study 108, patients with mutations were eligible based on in vitro evidence of responsiveness to 
TEZ/IVA defined as a 10% increase in chloride transport. The Fischer Rat thyroid cell lines, expressing 
potential mutations of residual function and possibly predicting a clinical response, were claimed by the 
applicant as a validated test environment. However, there is no clinical validation that this threshold of 
response is sufficient to predict clinical efficacy. The scatterplots provided were not conclusive to show 
a reliable relationship for the extend of in vitro and in vivo responsiveness.  
For all individual mutations, the number of patients is low. This limits the interpretation of the results. 
For following mutations, sufficient clinical evidence is considered present: 2789+5G->A, 3272-26A->G, 
3849+10kbC->T, A455E, D1152H, P67L, and S945L.  
Despite  the very limited data, 711+3A→G, D579G , L206W, R1070W, R117C, R352Q, and S977F a 
clinically relevant response was observed in a number of patients. Given the rarity of these mutations

and the difficulty of obtaining what would ordinarily be deemed robust clinical data, the sparse but 
promising data are considered sufficient. However, no patient with the mutation D110H had a 
beneficial clinical response. Mutation R347H was already excluded from the indication based on an in 
vitro increase in chloride transport below the pre-defined threshold of 10%.  
Overall, the characterisation of the study population with respect to some relevant factors is not as 
accurate as it would have been desirable. This applies to the status of chronic lung infection due to P. 
aeruginosa and the use of pancreatic enzymes.  
For the primary analysis of the absolute change in ppFEV1, the multiple testing procedure for study 
108 is not proven to protect type I error, but due to the strong statistical significance, many 
conceivable multiplicity procedures would produce similar results. Therefore, this is not considered 
critical and no further pursued. The results of a second interim analysis of study 110 showed trends in 
maintenance of effect, in ppFEV1, CFQ-R respiratory domain and BMI. The improvement in ppFEV1 of 
3.20 percentage points compared to Kalydeco alone in patients with F/G551D mutations has been 
observed in a short period of only 28 days.  
All populations 
A withdrawal effect has been observed 1 to 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation of dosing. 
However, as preservation of lung function by a CTFR modifier will need much longer time than 1 
month, this loss of effect is not considered indicative for long term effects.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Treatment-emergent AEs were reported for nearly all patients in both arms of the Phase III placebo-
controlled safety data set PC-SS (82.3% of patients in the TEZ/IVA arm vs. 86.9% in the placebo 
arm). TEAEs with an incidence of at least 5% in either treatment group, that were numerically higher 
in the TEZ/IVA group than in the placebo group, were headache (13.7% versus 11.3%), 
nasopharyngitis (11.5% versus 9.7%), and nausea (7.7% versus 6.7%). Related AEs occurred in 
23.6% of patients treated with TEZ/IVA and in 22.2% treated with placebo. 
Grade 3-4 AEs were reported for 7.1% (TEZ/IVA) vs. 8.5% (placebo) of patients. Infective PEx (3.6% 
vs. 3.8%) of CF and haemoptysis (0.8% vs. 1.0%) were the only Grade 3 or 4 AEs that had an 
incidence of at least 1% in either treatment group. SAES were reported for 10.1% (TEZ/IVA) vs. 
14.9% (placebo). The SAEs that occurred in ≥1% of patients in either treatment group were infective 
PEx of CF (6.7% vs. 10.3%) and haemoptysis (1.0% vs. 1.2%). Related SAEs occurred in 1.0% 
(TEZ/IVA) vs. 1.4% (placebo). Related SAEs that occurred in 2 or more patients in either treatment 
group were haemoptysis (0.4% vs. 0%) and infective PEx of CF (0.2% vs. 0.6%). 
The long-term safety data sets OLE-SS and LT-SS showed increased frequencies of (related AEs), 
Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation with TEZ/IVA compared to the 
pooled Phase III PC-SS. Of note: the placebo-TEZ/IVA arm in the OLE-SS showed a similar pattern and 
the mean exposure in the long-term safety data sets was increased 2-4 fold compared to the PC-SS. 
Discontinuations due to AEs occurred in 1.6% (TEZ/IVA) vs. 2% (placebo). Of the events occurring in 
at least 2 patients, the AE leading to treatment discontinuation that had a higher incidence in the 
TEZ/IVA group (0.4%; 2 patients) than the placebo group (0 patients) was abdominal pain.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety data package, while in principle adequate for the current approval, is still lacking in 
sufficient patient-years of exposure to inform about long latency or rare adverse effects. This 
information will become available during post-marketing pharmacovigilance. The restricted indication is 
considered adequate.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
FEV1 as a surrogate endpoint is a well-established endpoint and reduction of decline of FEV1 is related 
to improved survival. Pulmonary exacerbations and decline of lung function have an impact on survival 
in cystic fibrosis and reduce health-related quality of life. Preservation of lung function alongside 
reductions of the rate of pulmonary exacerbations are the main goals of treatment of cystic fibrosis. 
BMI as an important parameter for the nutritional status; this reflects the extra-pulmonary effects. The 
dose regimen for adolescents is established in both the clinical studies and the PoP PK model. 
CF patients 12 years or older homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation 
Importance of the favourable effects 
The observed difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo in absolute change of ppFEV1 is above the 
predefined threshold of clinical relevance (2.5 %) in the context of the natural decline in CF patients 
(Report of the workshop on endpoints for cystic fibrosis clinical trials (EMA/769571/2012)) in the 
pivotal study 106 as well as in the extension study 110. The results in study 110 in the patients on 
previous placebo treatment in study 106 mirror the results of study 106, showing the consistency of 
the results. The maintenance of effect is shown by the results of the patients who received active

treatment for 48 weeks, still being above 3%.  The rate reduction of 0.35 in pulmonary exacerbations 
is also relevant.  
Strength of the evidence 
The primary analysis provided evidence for the efficacy of TEZ/IVA in absolute change in ppFEV1 (p 
<0.0001, 95% CI 3.1, 4.8). The sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. 
Furthermore, consistent improvements in ppFEV1 favouring TEZ/IVA were observed across all 
prespecified subgroups with the lowest point estimate still clinically relevant. The results of the primary 
parameter are supported by the majority of the secondary endpoints, rate reduction in PExs (P-value 
0.0054, 95% CI  0.48, 0.88), BMI (p > 0.05), and CFQ-R respiratory domain. The data of the 
extension study 110 confirmed the results as similar results were demonstrated in the previously 
placebo treated patients; the patients who continued treatment with TEZ/IVA kept more or less the 
improvements already experienced during the parent study. It has been confirmed that ivacaftor alone 
is not efficacious in CF patients with F/F mutation (study 104).   
Impact of the uncertainties 
The proposed combination dose regimen is questioned given that tezacaftor as monotherapy has not 
been investigated in the phase 3 program. The in vitro discrepancies, study 101 data and the 
exposure-response analyses fail to substantiate a need for IVA in a TEZ/IVA combination to treat 
homozygous F508del patients. Based on the second interim analysis of the open label extension study, 
the data suggest the maintenance of the effect seen as observed in the parent study. However, an 
accurate and precise interpretation of the data would require a control group as the disease progresses 
over time. The conclusions are based on summary results, making an indisputable value judgement 
currently not possible.  
CF patients 12 years or older heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, and a second 
allele with residual function 
Importance of the favourable effects  
The obtained difference of TEZ/IVA in absolute change in absolute change of ppFEV1 of 6.8 % is above 
the predefined threshold (3.0 %) and also above accepted clinical relevance in both the parent study 
108 as in the extension study 110 establishing the benefit of TEZ/IVA over 24 weeks in total. The 
improvement in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain of 11.1 points is impressive and substantially above MCID 
of 4 points. The majority of the patients treated with TEZ/IVA achieved an improvement of 4 points. 
During the extension phase of 16 weeks, the improvement was maintained.  
Strength of the evidence 
The primary analysis provided evidence for the efficacy of TEZ/IVA in ppFEV1 (p <0.0001, 95% CI 5.7, 
7.8). The sensitivity analysis confirmed the primary analysis. In addition, the improvements in ppFEV1 
favouring TEZ/IVA were consistent across the pre-specified subgroups. The improvements of ppFEV1 in 
the extension study at Day 15 for patients on previous placebo treatment is similar as in the parent 
study. All these results confirm the robustness and consistency of the primary analysis.  
The (key) secondary endpoints support the results found in the primary endpoint.   
The data of the extension study 110 appears to confirm the results as similar results were 
demonstrated in the previously placebo treated patients; the patients who continued treatment with 
TEZ/IVA kept more or less the improvements already experienced during the parent study.  
Assessment report

The results of Study 107 confirmed that TEZ/IVA is not efficacious in patients who have the F508del- 
/MF mutation, indicating that the aimed population is CF patients with F/RF mutation.  
The results of Study 109 showed that TEZ/IVA is as efficacious in patients who have the F508del- 
/gating mutation as ivacaftor alone. These patients are not aimed for in the indication of TEZ/IVA.  
Impact of the uncertainties 
In patients with F/RF mutations, the combination regimen for study 108 was informed by in vitro data 
alone. While the in vitro data suggest that TEZ on its own has substantial chloride transport enhancing 
activity that is separable from a corrector function, the Phase III study 108 data indicate a modest  
incremental clinical benefit for the TEZ/IVA combination versus IVA alone. This suggests that TEZ is 
making a relatively modest contribution to the clinical effect with the TEZ/IVA combination in the F/RF 
patients. 
For the primary analysis, the multiple testing procedures hampered the protection of type I error, but 
due to the strong statistical significance, many conceivable multiplicity procedures would produce 
similar results. Therefore, this is not considered critical.   
Data are only available up to 24 weeks. Especially the placebo controlled phase is short (8 weeks). 
However, the 16 weeks extension data provided supportive evidence of sustained effect as well as a 
pattern similar to the CF patients with F/F mutation. Also the previous placebo treated group switched 
to active treatment showed a similar effect as the initial TEZ/IVA group. The maintenance of effect in 
CF patients with F/F mutation is accepted as support for CF patients heterozygous for the F508del-
CFTR mutation, and a second allele with residual function group. Although the data of the extension 
study 110 appears to confirm the results as similar results were demonstrated in the previously 
placebo treated patients, only 70% of the patients enrolled were analysed. Hence the data of a second 
interim analysis was submitted analysing 100% of the patients. Overall the results were in line with 
the results of the first interim analysis.  
Although TEZ/IVA showed clinically relevant differences over placebo, the benefit over ivacaftor 
monotherapy is small and sometimes even not reaching clinical relevance. For ppFEV1 the treatment 
difference was 2.1 %, but this is still considered relevant in relation to an overall estimated annualized 
ppFEV1 rate of decline of –1.05 percentage point in F/RF patients. Although for pulmonary 
exacerbations the reduction of event rate was higher with monotherapy IVA, the events rates are not 
reliable because of the short time of 8 weeks measurements.  
For the secondary endpoint CFQ-R the responder analysis showed a distinctive difference (65.2 versus 
58.3), Altogether, there is a clinical benefit over ivacaftor in this population of patients with F/RF 
mutations. The rationale for the need for TEZ in a TEZ/IVA combination can be considered somewhat 
more persuasive for patients with missense mutations.  
Although, the overall the study met its primary endpoint, for the separate mutations, the number of 
patients is low. This limits the interpretation of the results per mutation. 
No significant new or additional safety concerns were identified with the addition of TEZ to IVA. The 
safety profile of TEZ/IVA appeared similar across studies. There were no latent, late onset safety 
issues or risks identified in the long term safety sets. TEZ/IVA was well tolerated with low 
discontinuation rates due to AEs. Long term safety will be evaluated in the post-marketing setting.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
CF patients 12 years or older homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation 
The primary analysis in the placebo controlled study 106 provided evidence for the efficacy of TEZ/IVA 
and demonstrated that TEZ/IVA provides clinical benefit to CF patients with F/F mutation. The results 
in this study are sufficiently robust and the statistical approach is considered sound. The data from 
study 110 are confirmative of the maintenance of the effect in 70% of the available patients. The 
results of the second interim analysis in 100 % of the population are in line with the first interim 
analysis. In study 101, the data including exposure-response analyses do not provide reassurance of a 
need for IVA in a TEZ/IVA combination, to treat homozygous F508del patients. Although there is 
overall consistency of response to TEZ/IVA in FEV1 between Phase II and Phase III studies, TEZ/IVA 
was not compared with TEZ alone in Phase III, which leaves questions over superiority of the 
combination, particularly given the apparently greater reduction in sweat chloride with TEZ 
monotherapy, compared with TEZ/IVA, at higher doses, in study 101. The non-robustness of the Phase 
II study (101) data, due to the small patient numbers in each treatment group, cannot be used to allay 
concern in this regard. The absence of TEZ monotherapy evaluation at Phase III, to address the need 
for IVA in a TEZ/IVA combination question, remains of concern.  
In addition to the lack of clarity in the clinical data, the scientific literature points to the 
interdependence of chloride channel gating and CFTR protein localization on protein folding, which 
makes the distinction between corrector and potentiator action somewhat unclear. From in vitro 
results, the mechanistic argumentation has been strengthened but is not sufficiently convincing 
because of discrepancy between the patch clamp data and the Using chamber chloride conductance 
data and between patch clamp data and the in vivo data in study 101. However, this ongoing 
uncertainty is set against i) the level of unmet need in F508del homozygous patients who cannot 
tolerate LUM/IVA or where LUM/IVA is inadvisable; and ii) demonstration of superiority for TEZ/IVA 
over placebo in homozygous F508del patients resulting in relevant improvements in this 
population. Nevertheless, this should not be interpreted as an endorsement of lack of need for future 
clinical investigation into this important and as yet unresolved issue for these patients.  
Data from other studies confirmed that monotherapy with ivacaftor alone is not efficacious in CF 
patients homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. The overall safety profile of Symkevi in CF 
patients 12 years or older homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation is considered acceptable.  
CF patients 12 years or older heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, and a second 
allele with residual function 
The primary analysis for ppFEV1 in the placebo and active controlled study provided evidence for the 
efficacy of TEZ/IVA in ppFEV1 as well as for other clinical endpoints compared to placebo. The primary 
analysis is sufficiently robust. The statistical approach is overall sound.  
In addition, the benefit can only be considered established for the mutations that are supported by 
clinical data. All mutations initially proposed to be included in the indication based on in vitro 
responsiveness to TEZ/IVA could not be sufficiently justified by the applicant. A relationship between 
the extent of in vitro responsiveness in FRT cells and clinical response could not be established either. 
Further investigations for validation of this model with FRT cell, or other in vitro systems, as well as 
the in vitro-in vivo relation would be needed in case of inclusion of mutation based on in vitro data 
only.

Page 162/165 
 
 
 
 
 
As the pivotal study faces the concern of the short duration and also only limited data of the extension 
study are available, the overall data are covering only 24 weeks. The data of the important parameters 
are confirmative of maintenance of the effect based on the summary results. In addition, the data 
overall mirror the pattern observed in the CF patients with F/F mutation. Therefore, the maintenance 
of effect is considered established. Because TEZ/IVA is a new therapy with an indication that includes 
genotypes eligible or ivacaftor treatment, the comparison to ivacaftor is of importance. The clinical 
relevance of the differences over ivacaftor was small, but relevant. Overall the safety profile in CF 
patients 12 years or older heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, and a second allele with 
residual function is considered acceptable.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
CF patients 12 years or older homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation 
For these patients, a combination of a corrector and a potentiator has been established in principle by 
the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor (Orkambi). For Orkambi in its registration trials, the 
results of ppFEV1 were an increase in ppFEV1 from baseline of 2.16 % and 2.85% at 24 weeks (see 
EPAR Orkambi). Thus, there is a difference compared to TEZ/IVA (3.4 % from baseline) presented by 
cross trial comparison. 
The long term data are quite similar i.e. 3.25% for Orkambi compared to 3.1% for TEZ/IVA at 48 
weeks.  
TEZ/IVA offers a CFTR modulator alternative for patients who cannot tolerate Orkambi because of 
adverse events or who could not take Orkambi because of DDIs.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Symkevi is positive in the following indication: 
Symkevi is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of 
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del 
mutation or who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have one of the following mutations in 
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, 
A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 
3849+10kbC→T. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Symkevi is not similar to Bronchitol, Cayston, Tobi 
Podhaler and Kalydeco within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Symkevi is favourable in the following indication: 
Symkevi is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of 
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del 
mutation or who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have one of the following mutations in 
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, 
A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272 26A→G, and 
3849+10kbC→T. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product

Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that tezacaftor is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union. Ivafactor is considered to be a known active substance.

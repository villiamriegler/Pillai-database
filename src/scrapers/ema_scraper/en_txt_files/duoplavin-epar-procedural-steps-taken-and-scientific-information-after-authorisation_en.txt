rifampicin, a potent inducer of CYP2C19 which is mainly 
involved in the formation of the active metabolite of 
clopidogrel, increased significantly the formation and AUC 
of the active metabolite and therefore the PD effect, in 
particular the inhibition of platelet aggregation both after 
the loading dose and the maintenance dose. This shows an 
increased platelet inhibition from the drug-drug interaction 
of rifampicin and clopidogrel resulting in an increased risk 
of bleeding. The SmPC section 4.4 and 4.5 are updated 
accordingly.

Clopidogrel has been shown to increase repaglinide 
exposure in healthy volunteers. In vitro studies have shown 
the increase in repaglinide exposure is due to inhibition of 
CYP2C8 by the glucuronide metabolite of clopidogrel. Due 
to the risk of increased plasma concentrations, concomitant

Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
including all variations introduced since the marketing 
authorisation was granted, the CHMP consider that the risk-
benefit balance of DuoPlavin in the treatment and 
prophylaxis of the mentioned approved indications remains 
favourable and therefore recommends the renewal of the 
marketing authorisation. The CHMP recommend that the 
renewal be granted with unlimited validity.

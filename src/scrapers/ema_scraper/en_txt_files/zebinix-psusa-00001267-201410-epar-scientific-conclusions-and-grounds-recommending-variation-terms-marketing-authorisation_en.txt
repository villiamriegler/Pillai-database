Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for eslicarbazepine acetate, the 
scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Based on dermatological expert evaluation of case reports with suspected Serious Cutaneous Adverse 
Reactions, the PRAC was of the opinion that the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) should 
be updated to include information on Serious Cutaneous Adverse Reactions. The Package Leaflet 
should be updated accordingly. 
In addition, two post-marketing surveillance cases of atrioventricular block complete have been 
reported. Although the signal evaluation of this topic is ongoing, the PRAC recommended the deletion 
of the sentence “No second or higher degree AV block was seen in ESL-treated patients” from section 
4.8 of the SmPC.  
Therefore, in view of available data regarding eslicarbazepine acetate, the PRAC considered that 
changes to the product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for eslicarbazepine acetate the CHMP is of the opinion that 
the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal products containing eslicarbazepine acetate is favourable 
subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
  The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

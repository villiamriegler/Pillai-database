in order to update the Product information with 
results from two studies included in the paediatric 
investigation plan (PIP). Study SHP633-301 was 
performed to evaluate the safety, 
efficacy/pharmacodynamics (PD), and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of teduglutide in infants 4 to 
12 months gestational age with short bowel 
syndrome (SBS) and who are dependent on 
parenteral support. The second study is a paediatric 
population PK model including data from study 
SHP633-301. The Package Leaflet was updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to make editorial changes to section 4.5 
of the SmPC. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
002345-II-0053’ 
In a completed clinical trial (SHP633-301) in paediatric 
subjects aged 4 to 12 months corrected gestational age 
with short bowel syndrome (SBS) dependent on parenteral 
support (PS), a total of 10 subjects were randomized to the 
teduglutide arm (n=5) and Standard of Care arm (SOC, 
n=5), of which 8 subjects completed the study. Overall, 
results showed a relatively higher number of subjects 
achieving clinically meaningful reductions in PS nutrition 
volume, caloric intake and a higher percentage of the 
average reductions in PS calories, daily infusion time an 
number of days per week in PS usage within the 
teduglutide arm than the SOC arm. No subject achieved 
enteral autonomy during the study. Adverse events 
reported in the study were consistent with the safety profile 
seen in the previous paediatric studies and no new safety

data 
Population pharmacokinetics (PK) and PK/PD modelling and 
simulation of teduglutide demonstrated Cmax similarity 
across age groups (4 months to 17 years) supporting 0.05 
mg daily dosing in pediatric subjects who are 4 months to 
less than 1 year of age. A 50% dosage reduction is 
recommended in paediatric patients with moderate to 
severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease 
(ESRD) as adult patients with same degrees of renal 
impairment. 
Currently available data in children below 1 year are 
described in section 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation 
on a posology can be made. Long-term safety data are not 
yet available for the paediatric population.

Based on a cumulative review of safety data (from post-
update the list of safety concerns. In addition, as 
advised during procedure EMEA/H/C/PSA/S/0023, an 
updated protocol for study TED-R13-002 (adding a 
minor editorial clarification), version 6.0 is provided.

where significant assessment is required 
marketing, clinical studies and literature), antibody 
response in patients exposed to teduglutide is minimal and 
there is no significant association of formation of antibodies 
with events of hypersensitivity or lack of efficacy. For CRP, 
based on a cumulative review of safety data, there is no 
evidence to suggest a clinically significant increase in CRP 
is attributable to teduglutide. Patients with SBS are at risk 
for non-specific CRP elevations due to increased risk of 
inflammatory states including environmental infections, 
central line infections and Crohn’s disease exacerbations. 
As a consequence, the important identified risk “Occurrence 
of anti-teduglutide antibodies, cross reactivity with GLP-2 
and occurrence of anti-ECP antibodies” and the important 
potential risk “Increased CRP” were deleted from the RMP. 
In addition, important identified risks were renamed for 
clarity to “Biliary events”, “Pancreatic events” and 
“Intestinal polyps” and an editorial clarification to study 
protocol TED-R13-002 was made.

Limited data from clinical studies have shown that some

of 12 month is appropriate based on literature

patients may take longer to respond to treatment (i.e.,

distal/terminal ileum); if no overall improvement is 
achieved after 12 months, the need for continued 
treatment should be reconsidered.

malignancies in the gastrointestinal tract, including the

Fluid overload has been observed in clinical trials. Fluid 
overload adverse events occurred most frequently during 
the first 4 weeks of therapy and decreased over time. 
Congestive heart failure has been observed in clinical trials. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions were 
abdominal pain and distension (45%), respiratory tract 
infections (28%) (including nasopharyngitis, influenza, 
upper respiratory tract infection, and lower respiratory tract 
infection), nausea (26%), injection site reactions (26%),

headache (16%), and vomiting (14%). 
Based on integrated data from two trials in adults with SBS 
(a 6 month randomised placebo controlled trial, followed by 
a 24 month open label trial), the development of anti 
teduglutide antibodies in subjects who received 
subcutaneous administration of 0.05 mg/kg teduglutide 
once daily was 3% (2/60) at Month 3, 17% (13/77) at 
Month 6, 24% (16/67) at Month 12, 33% (11/33) at Month 
24, and 48% (14/29) at Month 30. 
Injection site reactions occurred in 26% of SBS patients 
treated with Revestive, compared to 5% of patients in the 
placebo arm. The reactions included injection site 
haematoma, injection site erythema, injection site pain, 
injection site swelling and injection site haemorrhage. The 
majority of reactions were moderate in severity and no 
occurrences led to drug discontinuation.

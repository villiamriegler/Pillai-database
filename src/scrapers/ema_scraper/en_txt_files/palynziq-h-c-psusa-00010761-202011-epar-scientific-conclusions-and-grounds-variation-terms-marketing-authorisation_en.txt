Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pegvaliase, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP  are as follows:  
In view of available data on dizziness from clinical trial(s) and spontaneous reports including in 
some cases a close temporal relationship and one case with  four positive re-challenges, the PRAC 
considers a causal relationship between pegvaliase and dizziness is at least a reasonable possibility. 
However, as it is evident that  dizziness can also be a symptom of a hypersensitivity reaction to 
Palynziq, the  PRAC recommended that dizziness be added to the list  of hypersensitivity reaction 
terms in the product information rather than as a new separate adverse reaction. The PRAC 
concluded that the product information of products containing pegvaliase should be amended 
accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with  the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation  to the  terms of the marketing  authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the  scientific conclusions for pegvaliase the CHMP is of the opinion that  the benefit-
risk balance of the  medicinal product(s) containing  pegvaliase is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to  the product information 
The CHMP recommends that  the terms of the  marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II and PL 
including all variations introduced since the marketing 
authorisation was granted, the CHMP considered that the 
benefit-risk balance of Telmisartan Actavis in the approved 
indications remains favourable and therefore recommended 
the renewal of the marketing authorisation with unlimited 
validity.

evidence from the scientific literature on dual RAS 
blockade therapy and given the seriousness of the 
identified safety concerns, the Italian Medicines 
Agency (AIFA) initiated a review under Article 31 of 
Council Directive 2001/83/EC, requesting the 
Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee 
(PRAC) to issue a recommendation on the benefit-
risk of dual RAS blockade therapy through the 
combined use of angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors), angiotensin II receptor 
blockers (ARBs) or aliskiren and to determine 
whether any regulatory measures should be taken on 
the marketing authorisations of the products 
involved in this procedure.

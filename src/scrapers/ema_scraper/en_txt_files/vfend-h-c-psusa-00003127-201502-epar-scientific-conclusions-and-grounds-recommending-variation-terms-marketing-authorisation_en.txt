The MAH conducted a cumulative search for ephelides, lentigo and actinic keratosis and provided a 
tabulated overview of the retrieved cases including the requested variables of gender, age, and the 
outcome of the event. These data and the knowledge on the association of phototoxicity with the use of 
voriconazole from spontaneous cases, case reports and the action of mechanism show a possible 
relationship of ‘ephelides’, ‘lentigo’ and ‘actinic keratosis’ with voriconazole. To increase awareness and 
facilitate the timely recognition of photosensitivity related reactions by the healthcare professionals, it is 
considered that these reactions should be provided as examples of photosensitivity-related skin reactions 
in the product information and listed with the frequency ‘not known’ for ephelides and lentigo and ‘rare’ 
for actinic keratosis.  
Therefore, in view of available data regarding phototoxicity reactions, the PRAC considered that changes 
to the product information of medicinal products containing voriconazole were warranted.

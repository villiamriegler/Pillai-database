CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Tybost is indicated as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of atazanavir 300 mg once daily or darunavir 
800 mg once daily as part of antiretroviral combination therapy in human immunodeficiency virus-1 
(HIV-1) infected adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older: 
• 
weighing at least 35 kg co-administered with atazanavir or 
• 
weighing at least 40 kg co-administered with darunavir. 
See sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. 
Posology 
Tybost is used in combination with atazanavir or darunavir, therefore the atazanavir or darunavir 
Summary of Product Characteristics should be consulted. 
Tybost must be taken orally, once daily with food. 
The doses of Tybost and the co-administered protease inhibitor, atazanavir or darunavir, are presented 
in Tables 1 and 2.

If the patient misses a dose of Tybost within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should 
take Tybost with food as soon as possible and resume their normal dosing schedule in combination 
with atazanavir or darunavir.  If a patient misses a dose of Tybost by more than 12 hours, the patient 
should not take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No data are available on which to make a dose recommendation for patients over the age of 65 years 
(see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment of cobicistat is required for patients with renal impairment, including those with 
severe renal impairment.  Cobicistat has not been studied in patients receiving dialysis, and, therefore, 
no recommendation can be made for these patients. 
Cobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular 
secretion of creatinine.  Cobicistat should not be initiated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 
70 ml/min if any co-administered agent (e.g. emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil, or 
adefovir) requires dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance.  See sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment of cobicistat is required in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B).  Cobicistat has not been studied in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).  Therefore, the use of Tybost is not recommended in these 
patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of cobicistat co-administered with atazanavir in children aged 0 to less than 
12 years, or weighing less than 35 kg have not been established.  The safety and efficacy of cobicistat 
co-administered with darunavir in children aged 0 to less than 12 years, or weighing less than 40 kg 
have not been established.  No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Tybost should be taken orally, once daily with food (see section 5.2).  The film-coated tablet should 
not be chewed or crushed. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Co-administration is contraindicated with medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for 
clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or 
life-threatening events.  Therefore, Tybost should not be co-administered with medicinal products that 
include, but are not limited to, the following (see sections 4.4 and 4.5): 
• 
• 
• 
alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonists: alfuzosin 
antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine 
ergot derivatives: dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors: lovastatin, simvastatin 
neuroleptics/antipsychotics: pimozide, lurasidone 
PDE-5 inhibitors: sildenafil for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension 
sedatives/hypnotics: orally administered midazolam, triazolam 
Co-administration is contraindicated with medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A due 
to the potential for loss of therapeutic effect.  Therefore, Tybost should not be co-administered with 
medicinal products that include, but are not limited to, the following (see sections 4.4 and 4.5): 
• 
• 
• 
anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin 
antimycobacterials: rifampicin 
herbal products: St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) 
Co-administration with dabigatran etexilate, a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, is contraindicated (see 
section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Co-administration with other medicinal products 
Cobicistat is a strong mechanism-based CYP3A inhibitor and is a CYP3A substrate. 
Increased plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A (including 
atazanavir and darunavir) are observed on co-administration with cobicistat.  Higher plasma 
concentrations of co-administered medicinal products can result in increased or prolonged therapeutic 
effects or adverse reactions.  For medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A these higher plasma 
concentrations may potentially lead to serious and/or life-threatening events (see section 4.3). 
Co-administration of cobicistat with medicinal products that have active metabolite(s) formed by 
CYP3A may result in reduced plasma concentrations of these active metabolite(s), potentially leading 
to loss of therapeutic effect. 
Co-administration of cobicistat with medicinal products that induce CYP3A is contraindicated or is 
not recommended (see sections 4.3 and 4.5) because decreased plasma concentrations of cobicistat 
could result in plasma levels that are insufficient to achieve adequate pharmacoenhancement of 
atazanavir or darunavir. 
Co-administration of cobicistat with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the 
clearance of cobicistat, resulting in increased cobicistat plasma concentrations (see section 4.5). 
Cobicistat is a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor and is metabolised to a minor extent by CYP2D6.  
Co-administration with cobicistat can increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are 
metabolised by CYP2D6 (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). 
Cobicistat inhibits the transporters P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.  
Co-administration of cobicistat in patients receiving medicinal products that are substrates of these 
transporters may result in increased plasma concentrations of the co-administered medicinal products 
(see section 4.5). 
Unlike ritonavir, cobicistat is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or 
UGT1A1.  If switching pharmacoenhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat, caution is required during the 
first two weeks of treatment with cobicistat, particularly if doses of any concomitantly administered 
medicinal products have been titrated or adjusted during use of ritonavir as a pharmacoenhancer (see 
section 4.5). 
Contraception requirements 
Plasma concentrations of ethinyloestradiol are decreased following co-administration of 
drospirenone/ethinyloestradiol with darunavir/cobicistat.  Alternative or additional contraceptive 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
measures are recommended when oestrogen-based contraceptives are co-administered with 
darunavir/cobicistat. 
Plasma concentrations of drospirenone are increased following administration of 
drospirenone/ethinyloestradiol with atazanavir/cobicistat or with darunavir/cobicistat.  If 
drospirenone/ethinyloestradiol is co-administered with atazanavir/cobicistat or darunavir/cobicistat 
clinical monitoring is recommended due to the potential for hyperkalemia. 
Data are not available to make recommendations on the use of atazanavir/cobicistat or 
darunavir/cobicistat with other oral contraceptives.  Alternative forms of contraception should be 
considered (see section 4.5). 
Co-administration of Tybost and antiretroviral medicinal products 
Tybost must be co-administered with either atazanavir 300 mg once daily or with darunavir 800 mg 
once daily (see section 4.2).  Safety and efficacy have not been established for use of cobicistat with 
either atazanavir or darunavir when used in any other dosing regimen.  Antiviral efficacy data from 
randomised controlled studies is available for cobicistat-boosted atazanavir, but not for 
cobicistat-boosted darunavir (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Tybost must not be used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of any other HIV-1 protease inhibitor or any 
other antiretroviral medicinal product that requires boosting since dosing recommendations for such 
co-administration have not been established and may result in insufficient plasma level of the 
antiretroviral medicinal product(s) leading to loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance 
(see section 4.2). 
Cobicistat co-administered with atazanavir or darunavir should not be used in combination with 
another antiretroviral agent that requires pharmacoenhancement by means of co-administration with 
an inhibitor of CYP3A4 to reach the desired therapeutic plasma concentrations (i.e., another protease 
inhibitor).  Dosing recommendations for such combinations have not been established and 
co-administration may result in decreased plasma concentrations of atazanavir, darunavir and/or the 
other antiretroviral agents that require pharmacoenhancement leading to loss of antiviral activity and 
development of resistance. 
Tybost should not be used in combination with other medicinal products containing cobicistat or with 
ritonavir due to similar effects of cobicistat and ritonavir on CYP3A. 
Effects on estimated creatinine clearance 
Cobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular 
secretion of creatinine.  This effect on serum creatinine, leading to a decrease in the estimated creatine 
clearance, should be taken into consideration when cobicistat is administered to patients in whom the 
estimated creatinine clearance is used to guide aspects of their clinical management, including 
adjusting doses of co-administered medicinal products. 
Tybost should not be initiated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 70 ml/min if one or more 
co-administered agent requires dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance (e.g. emtricitabine, 
lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil or adefovir).  See sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2. 
There are currently inadequate data to determine whether co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and 
cobicistat is associated with a greater risk of renal adverse reactions compared with regimens that 
include tenofovir disoproxil without cobicistat. 
Liver disease 
Cobicistat has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).  
Therefore, the use of Tybost is not recommended in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy 
Treatment with cobicistat and atazanavir or darunavir during the second and third trimesters of 
pregnancy has been shown to result in lower atazanavir or darunavir exposure compared to 
postpartum.  Cobicistat levels decrease and may not provide sufficient boosting.  The substantial 
reduction in atazanavir or darunavir exposure may result in virological failure and an increased risk of 
mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection.  Therefore, therapy with cobicistat and atazanavir or 
darunavir should not be initiated during pregnancy, and women who become pregnant during therapy 
with cobicistat and atazanavir or darunavir should be switched to an alternative regimen (see 
sections 4.6).  Darunavir given with low dose ritonavir may be considered as an alternative regimen. 
Excipients 
Tybost contains the azo colouring agent sunset yellow FCF (E110), which may cause allergic 
reactions. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Cobicistat is a strong mechanism-based CYP3A inhibitor and is a CYP3A substrate.  Increased plasma 
concentrations of medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A (including atazanavir and 
darunavir) are observed on co-administration with cobicistat.  Co-administration of cobicistat with 
medicinal products that have active metabolite(s) formed by CYP3A may result in reduced plasma 
concentrations of these active metabolite(s) (see section 4.4). 
Cobicistat is a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor and is metabolised to a minor extent by CYP2D6.  
Co-administration with cobicistat can increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are 
metabolised by CYP2D6 (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Cobicistat inhibits the transporters P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.  
Co-administration of Tybost with medicinal products that are substrates of these transporters can result 
in increased plasma concentrations of the co-administered medicinal products (see section 4.4). 
Cobicistat is not expected to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19. 
Cobicistat is not expected to induce CYP3A4 or P-gp (MDR1). 
Unlike ritonavir, cobicistat is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or 
UGT1A1.  If switching pharmacoenhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat, caution is required during the 
first two weeks of treatment with Tybost, particularly if doses of any concomitantly administered 
medicinal products have been titrated or adjusted during use of ritonavir as a pharmacoenhancer (see 
section 4.4). 
Concomitant use contraindicated 
Medicinal products that are extensively metabolised by CYP3A and have high first pass metabolism 
appear to be the most susceptible to large increases in exposure when co-administered with cobicistat.  
Co-administration of cobicistat with medicinal products such as dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, 
ergometrine, orally administered midazolam, triazolam, amiodarone, quinidine, pimozide, lurasidone, 
alfuzosin, simvastatin, lovastatin, and sildenafil which are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance 
and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening 
events is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Co-administration of cobicistat with medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A (such as 
St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin) may 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
result in decreased plasma concentrations of cobicistat and consequently that of atazanavir or 
darunavir being boosted, leading to loss of therapeutic effect and possible development of resistance 
(see section 4.3). 
Concomitant use not recommended 
Co-administration of cobicistat with medicinal products that are moderate to weak inducers of CYP3A 
may result in decreased plasma concentration of cobicistat and consequently that of atazanavir or 
darunavir being boosted, leading to loss of therapeutic effect and possible development of resistance.  
Some examples include, but are not limited to, etravirine, efavirenz, nevirapine, and bosentan (see 
Table 3). 
Co-administration of cobicistat with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may result in increased 
plasma concentration of cobicistat.  Some examples include, but are not limited to, itraconazole, 
ketoconazole, and voriconazole (see Table 3). 
Cobicistat co-administered with atazanavir or darunavir should not be used in combination with 
another antiretroviral agent that requires pharmacoenhancement by means of co-administration with 
an inhibitor of CYP3A4 to reach the desired therapeutic plasma concentrations (i.e., another protease 
inhibitor).  Dosing recommendations for such combinations have not been established and may result 
in decreased plasma concentrations of atazanavir, darunavir and/or the other antiretroviral agents that 
require pharmacoenhancement leading to loss of antiviral activity and development of resistance. 
Other interactions 
Interactions of cobicistat and potential co-administered medicinal products are listed in Table 3 below 
(increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”).  These interactions are based on 
either drug interaction studies or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction 
and potential for serious and/or life-threatening events or loss of efficacy. 
For additional drug-drug interactions with atazanavir or darunavir, consult their respective Summary 
of Product Characteristics when using Tybost.

Recommendation concerning 
co-administration with cobicistat 
150 mg and atazanavir or darunavir 
Atazanavir or darunavir plasma 
concentrations may decrease as a 
consequence of a reduction in cobicistat 
plasma concentrations, which may result 
in loss of therapeutic effect and 
development of resistance.  
Co-administration is not recommended 
(see section 4.4). 
Atazanavir or darunavir plasma 
concentrations may decrease as a 
consequence of a reduction in cobicistat 
plasma concentrations, which may result 
in loss of therapeutic effect and 
development of resistance.  
Co-administration is not recommended 
(see section 4.4). 
No dose adjustment of rilpivirine is 
required when atazanavir/cobicistat or 
darunavir/cobicistat are used 
concomitantly with rilpivirine. 
When co-administering maraviroc and 
Tybost patients should receive maraviroc 
150 mg twice daily.  For further details, 
consult the Summary of Product 
Characteristics for maraviroc. 
When administering ketoconazole with 
Tybost, the maximum daily dose of 
ketoconazole should not exceed 200 mg 
per day. 
Caution is warranted and clinical 
monitoring is recommended during 
co-administration. 
Clinical monitoring is recommended upon 
co-administration with Tybost. 
When administering with cobicistat, the 
maximum daily dose of itraconazole 
should not exceed 200 mg per day. 
Voriconazole should not be used unless 
the possible benefit is considered to 
outweigh the risks associated with the 
unpredictable effect on plasma 
concentrations.

Macrolide antibiotics 
Clarithromycin 
Co-administration of cobicistat and 
rifabutin is not recommended.  If the 
combination is needed, the recommended 
dose of rifabutin is 150 mg 3 times per 
week on set days (for example Monday-
Wednesday-Friday).  Increased 
monitoring for rifabutin-associated 
adverse reactions including neutropenia 
and uveitis is warranted due to an 
expected increase in exposure to 
desacetyl-rifabutin.  Further dose 
reduction of rifabutin has not been 
studied.  It should be kept in mind that a 
twice weekly dose of 150 mg may not 
provide an optimal exposure to rifabutin 
thus leading to a risk of rifabutin 
resistance and a treatment failure. 
Concentrations of clarithromycin may be 
increased upon co-administration of 
cobicistat.  Alternative antibiotics should 
be considered for co-administration with 
atazanavir/cobicistat.  Consult atazanavir 
Summary of Product Characteristics for 
dosing recommendations. 
When clarithromycin is co-administered

Interaction not studied. 
Plasma concentrations of these 
medicinal products may be

with cobicistat, resulting in 
reduced serum cortisol 
concentrations. 
Concomitant use of cobicistat and 
corticosteroids that are metabolised by 
CYP3A (e.g. fluticasone propionate or 
other inhaled or nasal corticosteroids) may 
increase the risk of development of 
systemic corticosteroid effects, including 
Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal 
suppression. 
Co-administration with CYP3A-
metabolised corticosteroids is not 
recommended unless the potential benefit 
to the patient outweighs the risk, in which 
case patients should be monitored for 
systemic corticosteroid effects.  
Alternative corticosteroids which are less 
dependent on CYP3A metabolism e.g. 
beclomethasone for intranasal or 
inhalational use should be considered, 
particularly for long-term use. 
For coadministration of 
cutaneously-administered corticosteroids 
sensitive to CYP3A inhibition, refer to the 
prescribing information of the 
corticosteroid for conditions or uses that 
augment its systemic absorption. 
Careful patient monitoring and dose 
adjustment of metformin is recommended

150 mg and atazanavir or darunavir 
Co-administration of Tybost with 
sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary 
arterial hypertension is contraindicated 
(see section 4.3). 
Caution should be exercised, including 
consideration of dose reduction, when 
co-administering Tybost with tadalafil for 
the treatment of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension. 
For the treatment of erectile dysfunction, 
it is recommended that a single dose of 
sildenafil no more than 25 mg in 48 hours, 
vardenafil no more than 2.5 mg in 
72 hours, or tadalafil no more than 10 mg 
in 72 hours be co-administered with

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited clinical data with cobicistat in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects of cobicistat with respect to 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Treatment with cobicistat and atazanavir or darunavir during pregnancy results in lower atazanavir or 
darunavir exposure which may be associated with an increased risk of virological failure and an 
increased risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection.  Therapy with cobicistat and 
atazanavir or darunavir should not be initiated during pregnancy, and women who become pregnant 
during therapy with cobicistat and atazanavir or darunavir should be switched to an alternative 
regimen (see sections 4.4). 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether cobicistat/metabolites are excreted in human milk.  Available 
pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of cobicistat/metabolites in 
milk.  A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  Therefore, Tybost should not be used during 
breast-feeding. 
In order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that women living with HIV do 
not breast-feed their infants. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of cobicistat on fertility are available.  Animal studies do not indicate 
harmful effects of cobicistat on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Tybost has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  However, patients 
should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with cobicistat-containing 
regimens. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Adverse reactions for cobicistat-boosted atazanavir were consistent with the safety profile of ritonavir-
boosted atazanavir.  The most frequently reported adverse reactions to cobicistat-boosted atazanavir 
were associated with elevated bilirubin levels (see Table 4). 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
The safety of cobicistat is based on 144-week data from a phase 3, randomised, active-controlled 
clinical Study (GS-US-216-0114), in which 692 treatment-naïve patients received at least one dose of 
cobicistat-boosted atazanavir (n = 344) or ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (n = 348) administered with 
emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate fixed-dose combination.  Of these 692 patients, 613 
(300 atazanavir/cobicistat and 313 atazanavir/ritonavir) and 496 (250 atazanavir/cobicistat and 
246 atazanavir/ritonavir) received at least 48 and 144 weeks of treatment, respectively. 
Adverse reactions to cobicistat-boosted atazanavir during 144 weeks of clinical trial experience from 
Study GS-US-216-0114 are listed in Table 4, below, by body system organ class and frequency.  
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Renal impairment 
Cobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular 
secretion of creatinine.  An increase from baseline in serum creatinine solely due to cobicistat’s 
inhibitory effect generally does not exceed 0.4 mg/dl. 
In Study GS-US-216-0114, decreases in estimated creatinine clearance occurred early in treatment 
with cobicistat, after which they stabilised.  The mean (± SD) change in estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR) by Cockcroft-Gault method after 144 weeks of treatment was -15.1 ± 16.5 ml/min in the 
cobicistat-boosted atazanavir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate fixed-dose 
combination group and -8.0 ± 16.8 ml/min in the ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus emtricitabine and 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate fixed-dose combination group. 
Effects on the liver 
In Study GS-US-216-0114, hyperbilirubinaemia (> 1 x ULN) was common: 97.7% in the cobicistat-
boosted atazanavir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate fixed-dose combination group, 
and 97.4% in the ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
fixed-dose combination group through 144 weeks of treatment.  However, a higher percentage of 
subjects in the cobicistat-boosted group had increases in total bilirubin > 2 x ULN than those in the 
ritonavir-boosted group (88.0% versus 80.9%).  The rates of study drug discontinuation due to 
bilirubin-related adverse events were low and similar in both groups (4.9% in the cobicistat-boosted 
group and 4.0% in the ritonavir-boosted group).  An increase of > 3 x ULN in alanine 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase was recorded in 12.8% of subjects in the cobicistat-
boosted group and 9.0% in the ritonavir-boosted group. 
Paediatric population 
The safety of cobicistat was evaluated in 21 HIV-1 infected virologically suppressed paediatric 
patients between the ages of 12 to < 18 years through 48 weeks in an open-label clinical study 
(GS-US-216-0128) of cobicistat-boosted atazanavir (n = 14) or darunavir (n = 7) plus two NRTIs.  In 
this study, the safety profile of cobicistat was similar to that in adults. 
Other special population(s) 
Patients with renal impairment 
The safety of Tybost in 73 HIV-1 infected treatment-experienced patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment (eGFR by Cockcroft-Gault method 50-89 ml/min) who switched pharmacokinetic 
enhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat was evaluated in an open-label clinical Study (GS-US-236-0118) 
of cobicistat-boosted atazanavir or darunavir plus two NRTIs.  At week 96 the mean change in serum 
creatinine was 0.07 ± 0.15 mg/dl and the mean change in eGFR by Cockcroft-Gault method 
was -6.2 ± 9.07 ml/min.  The effect of cobicistat on serum creatinine and eGFR in patients switching 
from ritonavir to cobicistat in Study GS-US-236-0118 was consistent with the effect in treatment-
naïve patients in Study GS-US-216-0114. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
If overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8).  Treatment 
of overdose with cobicistat consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs 
as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. 
There is no specific antidote for overdose with cobicistat.  As cobicistat is highly bound to plasma 
proteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: All other therapeutic products, ATC code: V03AX03 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
Cobicistat is a selective, mechanism-based inhibitor of cytochromes P450 of the CYP3A subfamily.  
Inhibition of CYP3A-mediated metabolism by cobicistat enhances the systemic exposure of CYP3A 
substrates (such as atazanavir or darunavir) that have limited oral bioavailability and a short half-life 
due to CYP3A-dependent metabolism. 
The effect of cobicistat on atazanavir pharmacokinetics was demonstrated in the pharmacokinetic sub-
study (n = 48) of the phase 3 Study GS-US-216-0114 in which HIV-1 infected patients received 
atazanavir 300 mg + cobicistat 150 mg or atazanavir 300 mg + ritonavir 100 mg, both in combination 
with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate fixed-dose combination.  The steady-state 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pharmacokinetic parameters of atazanavir were comparable when boosted with cobicistat versus 
ritonavir (see Table 5).

Study GS-US-216-0115 in 31 healthy subjects that were administered darunavir 800 mg in 
combination with cobicistat 150 mg or ritonavir 100 mg, all once daily, for 10 days.  The steady-state 
pharmacokinetic parameters of darunavir were comparable when boosted with cobicistat versus

Cobicistat has no detectable antiviral activity against HIV-1, HBV or HCV and does not antagonise 
the antiviral effect of HIV inhibitors. 
Clinical experience 
Antiviral efficacy data from randomised controlled studies is available for cobicistat-boosted 
atazanavir, but not for cobicistat-boosted darunavir (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
In treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients 
The safety and efficacy of cobicistat with atazanavir in HIV-1 infected patients were evaluated in the 
randomised, double-blind, active-controlled phase 3 Study GS-US-216-0114 in HIV-1 infected 
patients with baseline estimated creatinine clearance above 70 ml/min who were treatment-naïve 
(n = 692). 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either atazanavir 300 mg + cobicistat 150 mg once 
daily or atazanavir 300 mg + ritonavir 100 mg once daily, each administered with a fixed background 
regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg administered as a 
fixed-dose combination tablet.  Randomisation was stratified by screening HIV-1 RNA level 
(≤ 100,000 copies/ml or > 100,000 copies/ml).  Virologic response rate was evaluated in both 
treatment arms and virologic response was defined as achieving an undetectable viral load 
(< 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml).  Viruses were known to be susceptible to atazanavir, emtricitabine and 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate at baseline. 
Baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes at weeks 48 and 144 for Study GS-US-216-0114 are 
presented in Tables 7 and 8, respectively.

In an analysis of treatment-failure subjects in Study GS-US-216-0114 through week 144, evaluable 
genotypic data from paired baseline and treatment-failure isolates were available for all 21 virologic 
failures in the cobicistat group.  Among the 21 patients, 3 developed the emtricitabine-associated 
resistance substitution M184V.  No subject developed the tenofovir-associated resistance substitutions 
K65R or K70E, or any primary resistance substitution associated with protease inhibitors.  In the 
ritonavir group, genotypic data was available for all 19 virologic failures.  Among the 19 patients, 
1 developed the emtricitabine-associated resistance substitution M184V with no tenofovir- or primary 
protease inhibitor-associated resistance substitutions. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of cobicistat with atazanavir or darunavir were evaluated in an open-label 
phase 2/3 Study GS-US-216-0128 in 21 HIV-1 infected virologically suppressed paediatric patients 
between the ages of 12 and < 18 years with baseline estimated creatinine clearance ≥90 mL/min.  
Patients received cobicistat 150 mg once daily with either atazanavir 300 mg once daily (n = 14) or 
darunavir 800 mg once daily (n = 7), each administered with a background regimen containing two 
NRTIs. 
The mean age of patients was 14 years (range: 12 to 17); 62% were male; 38% were Asian, 33% were 
White, and 19% were Black.  At baseline, 20/21 subjects had plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL and 
1 subject had plasma HIV-1 RNA = 50 copies/mL. 
In patients treated with cobicistat + atazanavir, the median baseline CD4+ cell count and CD4+% was 
770 cells/mm3 (range: 486 to 1765) and 33% (range: 23% to 45%), respectively.  At Week 48, 93% 
(13/14) of patients retained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL and the median change from baseline in 
CD4+ cell count and CD4+% was -60 cells/mm3 and -0.3%, respectively.  In patients treated with 
cobicistat + darunavir, the median baseline CD4+ cell count and CD4+% was 1117 cells/mm3 
(range: 658 to 2416) and 45% (range: 28% to 56%), respectively.  At Week 48, 86% (6/7) of patients 
retained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL (1 subject had missing data) and the median change from 
baseline in CD4+ cell count and CD4+% was -342 cells/mm3 and -6%, respectively.  Overall, 3 of 21 
patients qualified for resistance analysis: 1 patient showed no resistance in protease or reverse 
transcriptase and 2 had missing data due to assay failure. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
cobicistat in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of HIV-1 infection (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of cobicistat with food in HIV-1 infected subjects, peak plasma 
concentrations were observed 4 hours post-dose for cobicistat.  The steady-state mean Cmax, AUCtau, 
and Ctrough (mean ± SD) following multiple doses of cobicistat in HIV-1 infected subjects (n = 68), 
respectively, were 1.2 ± 0.3 µg/ml, 10.9 ± 3.8 µg•h/ml, and 0.07 ± 0.07 µg/ml. 
A food effect study was not conducted for Tybost.  In clinical studies, cobicistat was co-administered 
with atazanavir or darunavir under fed conditions, in accordance with the Summary of Product 
Characteristics for these agents.  It is recommended that Tybost be administered with food. 
Distribution 
Cobicistat is 97-98% bound to human plasma proteins and the mean plasma to blood drug 
concentration ratio was 2. 
Biotransformation 
Cobicistat is metabolised via CYP3A (major)- and CYP2D6 (minor)-mediated oxidation and does not 
undergo glucuronidation.  Following oral administration of [14C]cobicistat, 99% of circulating 
radioactivity in plasma was unchanged cobicistat.  Low levels of metabolites are observed in urine and 
faeces and do not contribute to the CYP3A inhibitory activity of cobicistat. 
Elimination 
Following oral administration of [14C]cobicistat, 86% and 8.2% of the dose were recovered in faeces 
and urine, respectively.  The median terminal plasma half-life of cobicistat following administration of 
Tybost is approximately 3-4 hours. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Cobicistat exposures are non-linear and greater than dose-proportional over the range of 50 mg to 
400 mg, consistent with a mechanism-based CYP3A inhibitor. 
Elderly 
Pharmacokinetics of cobicistat have not been fully evaluated in the elderly (65 years of age and older). 
Gender 
No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to gender have been identified for cobicistat. 
Ethnicity 
No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to ethnicity have been identified for cobicistat. 
Paediatric population 
In paediatric patients aged 12 to < 18 years who received cobicistat-boosted atazanavir (n = 14) or 
darunavir (n = 7) in Study GS-US-216-0128, exposures of atazanavir and cobicistat (AUCtau, Cmax, and 
Ctrough) were higher (24% to 180%) than in adults; however, the increases were not considered 
clinically significant as the safety profiles were similar in adult and paediatric patients.  Mean 
darunavir Ctrough was lower (61%) in the paediatric patients relative to adults but was not considered 
clinically significant based on exposure-response relationships.  The pharmacokinetics of cobicistat in 
paediatric subjects < 12 years of age or < 35 kg have not been established. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
A study of the pharmacokinetics of cobicistat was performed in non-HIV-1 infected subjects with 
severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min).  No meaningful differences 
in cobicistat pharmacokinetics were observed between subjects with severe renal impairment and 
healthy subjects, consistent with low renal clearance of cobicistat. 
Hepatic impairment 
Cobicistat is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver.  A study of the pharmacokinetics of 
cobicistat was performed in non-HIV-1 infected subjects with moderate hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh Class B).  No clinically relevant differences in cobicistat pharmacokinetics were observed 
between subjects with moderate impairment and healthy subjects.  No dose adjustment of cobicistat is 
necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  The effect of severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) on the pharmacokinetics of cobicistat has not been studied. 
Hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection 
Pharmacokinetics of cobicistat have not been fully evaluated in hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infected 
subjects. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose 
toxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction and development.  No teratogenic effects were 
observed in rats and rabbit developmental toxicity studies.  In rats, ossification changes in the spinal 
column and sternebra of foetuses occurred at a dose that produced significant maternal toxicity. 
Ex vivo rabbit studies and in vivo dog studies suggest that cobicistat has a low potential for QT 
prolongation, and may slightly prolong the PR interval and decrease left ventricular function at mean 
concentrations at least 10-fold higher than the human exposure at the recommended 150 mg daily 
dose. 
A long term carcinogenicity study of cobicistat in rats revealed tumourigenic potential specific for this 
species that is regarded as of no relevance for humans.  A long term carcinogenicity study in mice did 
not show any carcinogenic potential. 
The active substance cobicistat is persistent in the environment.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tybost is and what it is used for 
Tybost contains the active substance cobicistat. 
Tybost is used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection, the virus that 
causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).  It is used in HIV-1 infected adults and 
adolescents aged 12 years and older: 
• 
• 
weighing at least 35 kg (when co-administered with atazanavir 300 mg) or 
weighing at least 40 kg (when co-administered with darunavir 800 mg). 
Tybost acts as a booster (enhancer) of atazanavir or darunavir (both protease inhibitors) to improve 
their effect (see section 3 of this leaflet). 
Tybost does not directly treat your HIV, but boosts the levels of atazanavir and darunavir in the 
blood.  It does this by slowing down the breakdown of atazanavir and darunavir which will make them 
stay in the body for longer. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Tybost 
Do not take Tybost 
• 
• 
If you are allergic to cobicistat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6 of this leaflet).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Sofosbuvir (SOF) is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural protein (NS) 5B polymerase inhibitor. It 
was first approved for commercial marketing in the United States (US) on 06 December 2013 and in 
the European Union (EU) on 17 January 2014. Sofosbuvir is indicated for the treatment of genotypes 1 
to 4 (US), and genotypes 1 to 6 (EU) HCV infection. 
The current indication for SOF excludes patients younger than 18 years of age. The natural history of 
chronic HCV infection in children is generally similar to that in adults although HCV infection in children 
is relatively mild. However, despite the overall more favourable prognosis in children compared to 
adults, approximately 4% to 6% of children with chronic HCV infection have evidence of advanced 
fibrosis or cirrhosis and some children eventually require liver transplantation for end stage liver 
disease as a consequence of HCV infection (Hu et al 2010). Currently approved regimens are 
complicated by the associated tolerability issues and limited efficacy, as well as safety concerns for 
growth and development in this age group (Wirth 2012).  
Gilead Sciences is submitting this dossier in support of an update to the marketing application to 
expand the potential benefit of SOF to the adolescent population (12 to < 18 years old) based on new 
safety and efficacy data from an ongoing Phase 2 study. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
A comprehensive nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology program has been 
undertaken in support of the registration of SOF for the treatment of chronic HCV infection in adults.  
No new nonclinical data have been generated to support approval of SOF in the adolescent population.  
According to the ICH M3 Guideline titled “Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of 
Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals,” safety data from previous 
adult human experience represents the most relevant information to support use in paediatric subjects 
(ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline 2009). Consistent with ICH M3 recommendations, the well-
defined and favourable safety profile of SOF in adults was carefully considered prior to the initiation of 
Study GS-US-334-1112 in adolescent subjects 12 to < 18 years of age.  
Taken together the known nonclinical safety profile for SOF with the clinical data from Study GS-US-
334-1112 and the established safety profile in paediatric patients, support a favourable benefit/risk 
profile for the proposed use of SOF for the treatment of genotype 2 or 3 chronic HCV infection in 
adolescent patients 12 to < 18 years of age. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The environmental risk assessment (ERA) was previously submitted for Sovaldi (Sofosbuvir [SOF]) as 
part of the EU initial marketing authorisation application (MAA). This ERA considered all available data 
relating to SOF in accordance with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use.   
The MAH provided a justification for not providing an updated ERA within this application. The MAH 
predicts that the potential use of Sovaldi in adolescent patients is not considered to significantly impact 
the predicted sales volume. The Phase II calculations presented in this ERA used predicted sales 
Page 8/39 
 
 
 
figures that took into consideration the forecasted use of SOF (as GS-331007) for the treatment of 
chronic hepatitis C (CHC) across the European Economic Area (EEA). As detailed in the ERA submitted 
as part of the EU initial MAA Day 120 response to questions in October 2013, Risk Quotient (RQ) for 
SOF (as GS-331007) is less than 1 for compartments such as sewage treatment plant, surface water 
and groundwater, therefore an increase in sales for Sovaldi of greater than 3906 times would be 
needed to pose an unacceptable risk. The existing ERA is therefore considered applicable to the current 
Type II variation application. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No additional non-clinical juvenile toxicity study is required to extend the use of LDV/SOF to adolescent 
patients (12 to <18 years). 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections from a non-clinical point of view in regard to this extension of the indication in 
adolescents.

Pharmacokinetics in Adolescent Subjects  
The PK of SOF and SOF’s major circulating metabolite GS-331007 were evaluated in adolescent 
subjects in Study GS-US-334-1112 (Group 1) enrolled as of 07 October 2015, who received the adult 
dose of SOF 400 mg, using all available intensive and sparse plasma concentration data (N = 50).  
The PK lead-in phase evaluated the intensive PK of SOF and GS-331007 after 7days of SOF + RBV 
dosing in 10 subjects. Plasma samples were collected up to 12 hours post-dose and PK data were used 
to confirm the SOF dose. Once confirmed, the treatment phase was opened up to enrol an additional 
40 subjects. A single PK sample was collected at all visits while on-treatment. The plasma 
concentrations of SOF and GS-331007 were assessed.  
Sofosbuvir 
The SOF dataset included 50 subjects with 428 plasma samples of which 151 were above the limit of 
quantitation. Data exploration identified 6 measurable PK samples as outliers and thus was excluded 
from the analysis. The remaining dataset included 145 measureable SOF concentrations from 28 
subjects.  
In the original PopPK model, the plasma PK of SOF after administration of SOF 400 mg was best 
described with a 1-compartment model with first order absorption, first order elimination from the 
central compartment, and an absorption lag time. The PK model was parameterized in terms of 
apparent oral clearance (CL/F), apparent central volume (Vc/F), absorption rate constant (Ka), and lag 
time (Tlag) with interindividual variability terms on CL/F, Vc/F, and Ka parameters. The relevant 
covariates in the model are patient status (HCV infected vs. healthy) on CL/F and Ka. The full covariate 
model was utilized for characterizing the disposition of SOF in this population. The prediction corrected 
visual predicted check of SOF plasma concentrations from adolescent patients is presented in Figure 1.

95th percentiles of the observed values. Blue shaded areas represent the spread of the median predicted values (5th to 95th percentile), and red shaded 
areas represent the spread (5th percentile and 95th percentile) of the 5th and 95th predicted percentile concentrations. 
GS-331007 
The GS-331007 dataset included 428 plasma samples from 50 subjects. Seven samples were below-
LLOQ and data exploration identified 6 PK samples as outliers excluded from the analysis. The 
remaining dataset included 415 measureable GS-331007 concentrations from 50 subjects.  
In the original PopPK model, the plasma PK of GS-331007 after administration of SOF 400 mg was 
best described by a 2-compartment model with zero and first order absorption, first order elimination 
from the central compartment, and an absorption lag time. The PK model was parameterized in 
apparent oral clearance (CL/F), apparent central volume (Vc/F), apparent inter-compartmental 
clearance (Q/F), apparent peripheral volume (Vp/F), a zero order (D2) and first-order absorption rate 
constant (Ka), and an absorption lag time (Tlag) with interindividual variability terms on CL/F, Vc/F, 
and Ka parameters. Creatinine clearance (CLCR) and patient status (HCV infected vs. healthy) on CL/F 
were the only significant covariates in the model. The full covariate model was utilized for 
characterizing the disposition of GS-331007 in this study. The prediction corrected visual predicted 
check of GS-331007 plasma concentrations from adolescent patients is presented in Figure 2.

shaded areas represent the spread (5th percentile and 95th percentile) of the 5th and 95th predicted percentile concentrations. 
Model Predicted Steady-State Exposure Parameters 
To evaluate the exposures of SOF and GS-331007 achieved in paediatric subjects of this study are 
similar to the exposures observed in adult patients, SOF and GS-331007 exposure data from this study 
will be compared to the integrated adult data by carrying out an analysis of variance for log-
transformed AUCtau and C max. The 90% confidence intervals will be constructed for the ratio of 
geometric means of each PK parameters. The equivalence boundary is set as 50% to 200%.  
Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 population PK-based exposure parameters are presented in Table 2 for 
adolescent subjects with at least 1 measurable plasma concentration for SOF or GS-331007. The SOF 
and GS-331007 exposures in adolescents were compared with exposures in adults with HCV infection 
from the SOF Phase 2/3 population. Additionally, SOF and GS-331007 exposures in adolescents were 
evaluated across quartiles of CLcr (evaluated by quartiles of eGFR using the Schwartz formula) as it 
was the only statistically significant intrinsic covariate of GS-331007 identified in the population PK 
model.

Final Population PK model  
Population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) models have been developed for SOF and its metabolite GS-
331007, based on data from 14 clinical trials including adult HCV-infected subjects and healthy 
volunteers. The understanding of the disposition of sofosbuvir (SOF) and GS-331007, in conjunction 
with intensive pharmacokinetic (PK)-lead-in data in adolescent subjects, informed that exposures of 
SOF and GS-331007 in the broader adolescent population would be comparable to the adult 
population. The initial population PK analyses for adolescents aged 12-<18 years was a fit for purpose 
approach to adequately describe the observed plasma concentration data with the intent of generating 
exposure estimates for comparison to that observed in the adult population administered SOF 400 mg 
+ RBV. An external model validation type approach was implemented using the final model developed 
in the adult population. The goodness-of-fit plots indicated that the model adequately described the 
observed data and allowed for estimation of exposures to support the comparison to the adult 
population. To confirm the initial understanding of SOF and GS-331007 exposures in adolescent 
subjects, population PK models for SOF and GS-331007 were reassessed utilizing a combination of 
adult and adolescent data to enhance identifiability and stability of the models. was amended to 
evaluate inter-occasion variability on SOF Ka and Vc/F for its influence on the distribution of ETA2 
(inter-individual variability on Vc/F). The addition of inter-occasion variability on Vc corrected the 
bimodality of ETA2 is shown in Figure 3.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The pharmacodynamics of SOF is well established. This agent (a nucleotide NS5B polymerase inhibitor) 
has potent activity against all HCV-genotypes. Only one mutation of relevance for SOF resistance 
(S282T) has been found during in vitro studies. This mutation has been detected at a very low 
frequency in patients who failed a SOF-containing regimen through relapse, and in these cases the 
virus reverted back to wild type virus within short (i.e. viral fitness much hampered by this 
substitution). S282T has not been seen as a naturally occurring polymorphism. There is no cross 
resistance between NS5A inhibitors and SOF. SOF has been shown to retain its efficacy on 
retreatment. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
It is acknowledged that no substantial difference in drug exposure is expected in an adolescent patient 
population (12-18 years) compared to the adult patient population. Adult and adolescent SOF and GS-
331007 data, respectively, has been pooled in the model development. Individual model predictions 
have been obtained for both sofosbuvir and GS-331007. 
Initially, in the population PK analyses, all samples below LLOQ were discarded from the analysis which 
can be accepted if the fraction of excluded samples is relatively low. It is acknowledged that the MAH 
is planning to improve the rate of samples below limit of quantification, and that the BQL samples have 
been taken into account in the updated modelling approach. 
The MAH is also strongly advised to develop a more sensitive bioanalytical method for sofosbuvir for 
coming paediatric cohorts. If more patients are excluded from the analysis, the comparison of 
predicted exposures between adult and paediatric patients will become inconclusive due to data loss.  
Page 14/39 
 
 
 
 
For upcoming population PK analyses, in younger patients and patients with lower body weight, it will 
become essential to assess a dependence on body weight in the PK models. In future applications of 
population PK analyses of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 in paediatric populations, it is important that the 
model parameters are estimated on the paediatric data and that relevant covariate relations are 
investigated in the model(s). 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Roughly similar exposure in adolescents and adults has been shown without any apparent body weight 
dependent exposures.

Safety 
Clinical and laboratory AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA), Version 19.0. 
Treatment-emergent AEs were defined as events that met 1 or both of the following criteria: 
•  Any AEs with onset dates on or after the study drug start date and no later than 30 days after 
the permanent discontinuation of study drug 
•  Any AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study drug 
If the date of onset was incomplete, then the month and year (or year alone if month was not 
recorded) of onset were used to determine whether the AE was treatment emergent. All AEs discussed 
in this CSR were treatment emergent and are referred to as AEs for the purposes of this report. 
Laboratory data were summarized using descriptive statistics (sample size, mean, SD, median, Q1, 
Q3, minimum, and maximum) with corresponding changes from baseline for ALT, AST, total bilirubin, 
alkaline phosphatase, haemoglobin, reticulocytes, white blood cell (WBC) counts, neutrophils, 
lymphocytes, platelets, and INR. 
Tanner Pubertal Stage, Height/Weight/Body Mass Index, Bone Age Assessments, Vital Signs and 
Concomitant Medications were also included among safety endpoints.

Recruitment 
Table 3.  GS-US-334-1112: Key Dates for Group 1 (12 to < 18 Years Old) 
Subjects were included who were enrolled into the study as of 07 October 2015 
Subjects were enrolled across 28 sites in the United States, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, the Russian 
Federation, New Zealand, and Australia.  
A total of 66 subjects were screened for Group 1, and 14 subjects (21.2%) failed screening. For the 9 
screen failure subjects who did not meet eligibility criteria, the 2 primary reasons for screen failure were 
not meeting the inclusion criterion of infection with genotype 2 or genotype 3 HCV infection as 
determined at Screening (44.4%; 4 subjects) and having any other condition (including alcohol or 
substance abuse) or prior therapy which was specified as an exclusion criterion (22.2%; 2 subjects). Of 
the 5 screen failure subjects who did meet eligibility criteria, the reasons for not enrolling were 
withdrawal of consent (40.0%, 2 subjects), and adverse event, outside of visit window, and other 
(20.0%; 1 subject each). Two subjects in Group 1 were enrolled after the 07 October 2015 date and are 
not included in this interim report. 
Of the 50 subjects enrolled in Group 1 as of 07 October 2015, all 50 received at least 1 dose of study 
drug and were included in the Safety Analysis Set and Full Analysis Set (13 subjects with genotype 2 HCV 
infection and 37 subjects with genotype 3 HCV infection). 
All subjects (100.0%) completed study treatment. 
Conduct of the study 
Study GS-US-334-1112 was conducted under a US investigational new drug (IND) application and in 
accordance with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research was conducted, and in 
accordance with recognized international scientific and ethical standards, including but not limited to the 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the original 
principles embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki. These standards are consistent with the requirements 
of the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21, Part 312 (21 CFR 312), and the European 
Community Directive 2001/20/EC, as well as other local legislation. 
A total of 6 important protocol deviations occurred in 4 subjects during the study. Of the 4 subjects, 2 
subjects had a single important deviation and 2 subjects had 2 important deviations. The majority of 
important protocol deviations were for deviations of wrong treatment or incorrect dose (3 of 6) and for 
eligibility criteria (2 of 6). Relevant protocol deviations were proportionally distributed between study 
sites in subjects treated with SOF+RBV for 24 weeks.

Outcomes and estimation 
The key efficacy endpoint was SVR12, defined as HCV RNA < LLOQ 12 weeks after discontinuation of the 
study drug, in the Full Analysis Set. The key efficacy endpoint analysis (for SVR12) in this interim CSR 
was conducted after all subjects in Group 1 (12 to < 18 years old) completed the posttreatment Week 12 
visit or prematurely discontinued from the study. 
Table 7.  GS-US-334-1112: SVR12 for Group 1 (12 to < 18 Years Old) (Full Analysis Set) 
HCV RNA was analyzed using the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Quantitative Test v2.0 with an LLOQ of 15 IU/mL. 
SVR12 was sustained virologic response (HCV RNA < LLOQ) 12 weeks after stopping study treatment. 
A missing SVR12 value was imputed as a success if it was bracketed by values that are termed successes (ie, '< LLOQ TND' or '< LLOQ detected'); otherwise, 
the missing SVR12 value was imputed as a failure. TND = target not detected. 
The exact 95% CI for the proportion within treatment group was based on the Clopper-Pearson method. 
The p-value was obtained from the 2-sided exact 1-sample binomial test for the superiority over the performance goal of 80%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/508676/2017 
Page 25/39 
 
  
  
 
 
No subject had on-treatment virologic failure (ie, breakthrough, rebound, or nonresponse) or relapsed. All 
subjects with genotype 2 HCV infection treated with SOF+RBV for 12 weeks achieved SVR12. 
Two of 37 subjects with genotype 3 HCV infection (5.4%) treated with SOF+RBV for 24 weeks achieved 
SVR4, but did not return for their posttreatment Week 12 visit (categorized as “other” in Table 8). 
Table 8.  GS-US-334-1112: Virologic Outcomes for Group 1 (12 to < 18 Years Old) (Full Analysis Set) 
HCV RNA was analyzed using the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Quantitative Test v2.0 with an LLOQ of 15 IU/mL. 
Relapse = confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ during the posttreatment period having achieved HCV RNA < LLOQ at the last on-treatment visit. 
On-treatment virologic failure = breakthrough (confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after having previously had HCV RNA < LLOQ while on treatment), rebound 
(confirmed >1 log10 IU/mL increase in HCV RNA from nadir while on treatment), or non-response (HCV RNA persistently ≥ LLOQ through 8 weeks of 
treatment). 
Other = subject who did not achieve SVR12 and did not meet virologic failure criteria. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In this limited dataset, the estimates of clinical efficacy are high and indicate that the combination of 
SOF+RBV is effective in the treatment of adolescents with GT2 and GT3 HCV infection. 
Only GT2 and GT3 patients were included in the study, and there were no patients with verified cirrhosis. 
It is possible to extrapolate efficacy from adults to adolescents infected with other HCV genotypes as well 
as cirrhotic patients from adult efficacy data as long as the drug exposure is similar, which is anticipated. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Given that exposure is comparable to that of adult phase 3 studies, it can be concluded that SOF is 
effective in the treatment of adolescents with HCV infection. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In adults, the safety profile of the sofosbuvir is considered favourable and well-characterized in subjects 
with compensated liver disease and GFR > 30 ml/min. 
Assessment report  
EMA/508676/2017 
Page 26/39 
 
  
  
 
Patient exposure 
The mean (SD) duration of exposure to the study regimen was 12.1 (0.16) weeks for subjects treated for 
12 weeks, and 24.1 (0.17) weeks for subjects treated for 24 weeks. The majority of subjects in the 12-
week treatment regimen (92.3%) received study drug for 12 weeks and the majority of subjects in the 
24-week treatment regimen (91.9%) received study drug for 24 weeks.

(Safety Analysis Set) 
Weeks on Study Drug = (last dose date of individual study drug - first dose date of individual study drug + 1) divided by 7. 
Adverse events 
The majority of subjects treated with SOF+RBV for 12 or 24 weeks (92.3% and 75.7%, respectively) 
experienced at least 1 AE. All AEs were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate) in severity with the 
exception of 1 subject treated with SOF+RBV for 24 weeks who experienced a Grade 3 AE of shoulder 
trauma. No subjects experienced SAEs. No deaths were reported. No subject prematurely discontinued 
SOF due to an AE. One subject had a modification or interruption of RBV dosing.

considered serious or related to study drug by the investigator. No subject experienced a Grade 4 (life 
threatening) AE. No deaths were reported during the study for subjects enrolled in Group 1 differs from 
what is seen in the adult population.  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Grade 3 haematology laboratory abnormalities were reported for decreased haemoglobin in 3 of 37 
subjects (8.1%) and decreased white blood cells in 1 of 37 subjects (2.7%) treated with SOF+RBV for 24 
weeks. There were no Grade 3 or 4 haematology laboratory abnormalities in subjects treated with 
SOF+RBV for 12 weeks, and no Grade 4 haematology laboratory abnormalities in subjects treated with 
SOF+RBV for 24 weeks. All Grade 3 haematology laboratory abnormalities were isolated and transient. 
There were no subjects with post-baseline haemoglobin < 10 g/d, the protocol guideline threshold for 
RBV dose reduction/modification.

laboratory abnormalities occurred in subjects treated with SOF+RBV for 24 weeks. All but 1 Grade 3 and 
Grade 4 chemistry laboratory abnormalities were isolated incidents and did not remain at Grade 3 or 4 for 
more than one assessment. One subject, with a medical history of Gilbert’s syndrome and jaundice from 
screening, had a Grade 3 increased total bilirubin at Weeks 1 and 2, and Weeks 8 through 20. The 
subject had a Grade 2 increased total bilirubin level at baseline. This subject had an AE of blood bilirubin 
increase of Grade 2 severity with an onset on study Day 7 which was resolved by posttreatment Day 29. 
The AE of bilirubin increase was considered not related to study drug by the investigator and did not 
result in a change in dosing regimen.

The mean (SD) height at baseline for subjects treated with SOF+RBV for 12 and 24 weeks was 161.8 
(13.53) and 165.6 (9.20) cm, respectively. No clinically relevant changes from baseline in body height or 
body height percentiles were observed during the study. At posttreatment Week 12, the mean (SD) 
change from baseline in body height was 1.4 (1.65) and 1.1 (1.75) cm, respectively. The mean (SD) 
body height percentile at baseline for subjects treated with SOF+RBV for 12 and 24 weeks was 40.36 
(34.596) and 50.00 (25.904), respectively. At posttreatment Week 12, the mean (SD) body height 
percentile was 41.14 (32.960) and 48.24 (26.705), respectively. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In this limited safety dataset, there are no signs that the safety profile of SOF in adolescent patients 
differs from what is previously established for adults. The adverse events related to haematology are 
well-known effects of RBV treatment. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of SOF in adolescents is favourable, given that exposure is similar to that of adult 
pivotal studies. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) is included in the 
additional monitoring list from the time of marketing authorisation. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Hepatitis C virus infection is a global health challenge; currently, an estimated 170 million individuals 
worldwide are chronically infected with HCV (WHO 2014).  
The estimated prevalence of HCV infection in children is up to 0.4% in Europe and the US and up to 6% 
in resource-limited countries (El-Shabrawi et al 2013). Globally, there are estimated to be 6.6 million HCV 
RNA-positive individuals 15 years of age or younger (El-Sayed et al 2015). 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Up to 85% of individuals infected with HCV fail to clear the virus and progress to chronic infection; over 
the ensuing 20 years, as many as 20% of patients with chronic HCV infection are estimated to develop 
complications, including cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In Europe, an 
approximately 86,000 deaths occur each year due to HCV infection (WHO 2011, Muhlberger et al 2009). 
The natural history of chronic HCV infection in children is generally similar to that in adults, although HCV 
infection in children is typically relatively mild. The primary mechanism of HCV infection in children is 
vertical transmission, with parenteral transmission secondary (Wirth et al 2011). 
Most children chronically infected with HCV are asymptomatic or have mild, nonspecific symptoms. 
Despite the overall more favourable prognosis compared to adults, approximately 4% to 6% of children 
with chronic HCV infection have evidence of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis and some children eventually 
require liver transplantation for end-stage liver disease as a consequence of HCV infection (Hu et al 
2010). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Paediatric treatment is controversial as the current treatment options are limited and severe side effects 
and tolerability can limit or preclude their use. Despite well-established guidelines for the treatment of 
HCV in adults, there is no universal consensus on when or if to treat chronic HCV infection in children. 
Currently approved treatments for HCV infection in adolescent patients (12 to < 18 years old) include 
regimens with IFN or Peg-IFN and weight-based RBV. Recommendations are that patients with genotype 
2 or 3 HCV infection be treated with Peg-IFN+RBV for 24 weeks and those with genotype 1 or 4 infection 
should receive Peg-IFN+RBV for 48 weeks (Wirth 2012). The concern for growth and development in this 
age group and the role that both Peg-IFN and RBV potentially play in reducing growth rates has initiated 
significant debate among paediatricians as to whether these treatments should even be considered in the 
paediatric population. 
The treatment regimens with DAAs available for adults with HCV infection have created an opportunity to 
address this unmet medical need in the paediatric population. SOF has shown a favourable safety profile 
and high efficacy in adults with chronic HCV across a range of genotypes, treatment experience, and 
disease status. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The purpose of Study GS-US-334-1112 is to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of SOF+RBV in 
children and adolescents (3 to < 18 years old), and to assess the efficacy of SOF+RBV in this population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/508676/2017

In addition, all paediatric subjects previously treated with a Gilead HCV DAA in a company-sponsored 
study fulfilling the entry criteria, will be  eligible to enrol into a registry study (Study GS-US-334-1113) to 
be followed for a total of 5 years for assessments of growth, quality of life, and long-term viral 
suppression. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Sofosbuvir is previously known to be efficacious in the treatment of adults chronically infected with HCV, 
and the data from this study gives a comparable estimate of efficacy also in adolescents. Only GT2 and 
GT3 non-cirrhotic patients were included in the study, and were treated with SOF+RBV 12 or 24 weeks, in 
accordance with adult recommendations. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no identified uncertainties of regulatory importance. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile and tolerability of sofosbuvir is favourable in adults, and there are no indications in this 
limited safety dataset that the safety profile is any different in adolescents. The safety profile of ribavirin 
is as anticipated based on extensive clinical trial and real life experience. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are no identified uncertainties of regulatory importance. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Sofosbuvir provides an important addition to the pharmacological armamentarium in adolescents, as the 
currently approved treatment options (pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin) has a less 
favourable efficacy and safety profile. 
Unfavourable effects are generally few and in line with the safety profile in observed adults. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
There are no a priori reasons to anticipate that the 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir, approved for adults, would 
yield different exposure in adolescents aged 12 to <18 years. Indeed, the high efficacy and tolerability 
seen in this limited experience in adolescents are as anticipated. It is recognised that drug exposure is 
similar in adolescents and adults. 
In the general case, for direct acting antiviral therapy against HCV, a demonstration of similar exposure 
in a paediatric patient stratum would allow for bridging to the full set of clinical situations for which the 
drug is recommended in adults. In this case, however, it is notable that sofosbuvir is recommended in 
combination with interferon and ribavirin for genotypes 1, 4 and 5, whereas interferon-free therapy is 
recommended in genotypes 2 and 3. As stated, interferon therapy has an unfavourable safety profile and 
Assessment report

is no longer recommended per treatment guidelines. In patients that are not fully grown, a 48 week 
course of interferon has been associated with permanent loss of adult stature, and this risk is considered 
highest when treating during the pubertal growth spurt. While it is recognised that the interferon course 
when using sofosbuvir would be only of 12 weeks duration, it still does not seem presently relevant to 
provide a recommendation in 4.2 on the use of interferon-based therapy in adolescents. Therefore, the 
CHMP only recommend interferon-free therapy in GTs 2 and 3 where this is relevant.  
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of sofosbuvir is positive.

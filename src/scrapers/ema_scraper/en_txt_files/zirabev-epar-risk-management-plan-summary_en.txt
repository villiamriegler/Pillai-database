PART VI.  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of risk management plan for Zirabev (bevacizumab)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Zirabev.  The RMP details 
important risks of Zirabev, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about Zirabev’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Zirabev’s Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Zirabev should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Zirabev should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Zirabev’s RMP.
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For
Zirabev has been developed as a biosimilar to Avastin (bevacizumab), and is proposed to be 
authorised for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, metastatic breast cancer, 
advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer, advanced and/or metastatic 
renal cell cancer, and cervical cancer (see SmPC for the full indication).  It contains 
bevacizumab as the active substance and it is administered intravenously.
Further information about the evaluation of Zirabev’s benefits can be found in Zirabev’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/zirabev.
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further
Characterise the Risks
Important risks of Zirabev, together with measures to minimise such risks are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that
the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with or
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.

Risk Management Plan
Part VI: Summary of the Risk Management Plan
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary.  These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Zirabev is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A. List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Zirabev are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered.  
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of PF-06439535.  Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

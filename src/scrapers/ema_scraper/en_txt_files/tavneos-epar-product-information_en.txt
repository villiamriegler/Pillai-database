Missed doses 
If a patient misses a dose, the missed dose is to be taken as soon as possible, unless within three hours 
of the next scheduled dose. If within three hours, then the missed dose is not to be taken. 
Dose management 
Treatment must be re-assessed clinically and temporarily stopped if: 
• 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is more than 3 times the 
upper limit of normal (ULN). 
Treatment must be temporarily stopped if: 
• 
• 
ALT or AST > 5 × ULN, 
a patient develops leukopenia (white blood cell count < 2 × 109/L) or neutropenia 
(neutrophils < 1 × 109/L), or lymphopenia (lymphocytes < 0.2 × 109/L), 
a patient has an active, serious infection (i.e. requiring hospitalisation or prolonged 
hospitalisation). 
• 
Treatment may be resumed: 
• 
upon normalisation of values and based on an individual benefit/risk assessment. 
If treatment is resumed, hepatic transaminases and total bilirubin are to be monitored closely. 
Permanent discontinuation of treatment must be considered if: 
• 
• 
• 
ALT or AST > 8 × ULN, 
ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks, 
ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and total bilirubin > 2 × ULN or international normalised ratio 
(INR) > 1.5, 
ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5%), 
an association between avacopan and hepatic dysfunction has been established. 
• 
• 
Special populations 
Elderly  
No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see 
section 5.2). 
Avacopan has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and it 
is therefore not recommended for use in these patient populations. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed based on renal function (see section 5.2). 
Avacopan has not been studied in patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-
associated vasculitis with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 15 mL/min/1.73 m², 
who are on dialysis, in need of dialysis or plasma exchange. 
Severe disease manifested as alveolar haemorrhage 
Avacopan has not been studied in patients with severe disease manifested as alveolar haemorrhage.

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of avacopan in adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) have not yet been 
established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8 and 5.1 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. The safety and efficacy of avacopan in children below 12 years of age have not 
yet been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
This medicinal product is for oral use. 
The hard capsules are to be taken with food and swallowed whole with water and must not be crushed, 
chewed, or opened.  
Grapefruit and grapefruit juice are to be avoided in patients treated with avacopan (see section 4.5). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Liver function test increased 
Serious adverse reactions of elevated hepatic transaminases with elevated total bilirubin have been 
observed in patients receiving avacopan in combination with cyclophosphamide (followed by 
azathioprine or mycophenolate) or rituximab and trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole.  
Liver function test (LFT) increased is considered as an adverse reaction (see section 4.8).  
Avacopan must be avoided in patients with signs of liver disease, such as elevated AST, ALT, alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP), or total bilirubin > 3 times ULN. 
Hepatic transaminases and total bilirubin must be obtained prior to initiation of therapy.  
Patients must be monitored for hepatic transaminases and total bilirubin as clinically indicated and as 
part of the routine follow-up of patient’s underlying condition (see section 4.2). 
Blood and immune system 
White blood cell (WBC) count must be obtained prior to initiation of therapy and patients must be 
monitored as clinically indicated and as part of the routine follow-up of patient’s underlying condition 
(see section 4.2).  
Treatment with avacopan must not be initiated if WBC count is < 3.5 × 109/L, or neutrophil count 
< 1.5 × 109/L, or lymphocyte count < 0.5 × 109/L. 
Patients receiving avacopan must be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, 
unexpected bruising, bleeding, or any other manifestations of bone marrow failure. 
Serious infections 
Serious infections have been reported in patients receiving combination agents for treatment of GPA 
or MPA, including avacopan in combination with rituximab or cyclophosphamide (see section 4.8). 
Patients must be assessed for any serious infections.

Avacopan has not been studied in patients with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) infections. Before and during treatment, patients must notify their physician if they have 
been diagnosed with tuberculosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection.  
Be cautious when treating patients with a history of tuberculosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV 
infection. 
Avacopan does not decrease the formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) or terminal 
complement complex (TCC). No cases of Neisseria meningitidis have been identified in the avacopan 
clinical programme. Monitor patients treated for ANCA-associated vasculitis according to standard 
practice for clinical signs and symptoms of Neisseria infections. 
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis 
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis is recommended for adult patients with GPA or MPA 
during avacopan treatment, as appropriate according to local clinical practice guidelines. 
Immunisation 
The safety of immunisation with live vaccines, following avacopan therapy has not been studied. 
Administer vaccinations preferably prior to initiation of treatment with avacopan or during quiescent 
phase of the disease. 
Angioedema 
Angioedema has been reported in patients receiving avacopan (see section 4.8). 
Patients must notify their physician if they develop any symptoms such as swelling of the face, lips, or 
tongue, throat tightness, or difficulty breathing.  
Avacopan must be withheld in cases of angioedema. 
Interaction with strong CYP3A4 inducers 
The use of strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, enzalutamide, mitotane, 
phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, and St. John’s Wort) with avacopan is to be avoided (see 
section 4.5).  
Patients anticipated to require long-term administration of these medicinal products are not to be 
treated with avacopan.  
If short-term co-administration cannot be avoided in a patient already using avacopan, the patient must 
be closely monitored in case of any reoccurrence of disease activity. 
Cardiac disorders 
Patients with GPA or MPA are at risk of cardiac disorders such as myocardial infarction, cardiac 
failure, and cardiac vasculitis.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) of cardiac disorder have been reported in patients treated with 
avacopan. A treatment regimen based on the combination with cyclophosphamide followed by 
azathioprine may carry an increased risk for cardiac disorders as compared to a regimen based on the 
combination with rituximab. 
Malignancy 
Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk for malignancies. The clinical data are 
currently limited (see section 5.1).

Macrogolglycerol hydroxystearate content 
This medicinal product contains macrogolglycerol hydroxystearate, which may cause stomach upset 
and diarrhoea. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Avacopan is a substrate of CYP3A4. Co-administration of inducers or inhibitors of this enzyme may 
affect the pharmacokinetics of avacopan. 
Effect of strong CYP3A4 inducers on avacopan 
Co-administration of avacopan with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducer, resulted in a 
decrease in area-under-the-concentration time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) of avacopan by approximately 93% and 79%, respectively. Since this interaction may result in 
loss of efficacy of avacopan, the use of strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, 
enzalutamide, mitotane, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, and St. John’s Wort) with avacopan is 
to be avoided (see section 4.4). Patients anticipated to require long-term administration of these 
medicinal products are not to be treated with avacopan. If short-term co-administration cannot be 
avoided in a patient already using avacopan, the patient must be closely monitored for any 
reoccurrence of disease activity. 
Effect of moderate CYP3A4 inducers on avacopan 
Exercise caution when using moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, and 
modafinil) prescribed as concomitant medicinal product with avacopan and carefully evaluate the 
benefit/risk of avacopan. 
Effect of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors on avacopan 
Co-administration of avacopan with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor, resulted in an 
increase in AUC and Cmax of avacopan by approximately 2.2-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively. 
Therefore, strong CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, indinavir, 
itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, 
ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, and voriconazole) should be used with caution in 
patients who are being treated with avacopan. Patients must be monitored for potential increase of side 
effects due to the increased exposure of avacopan. 
Grapefruit and grapefruit juice can increase the concentration of avacopan; therefore, grapefruit and 
grapefruit juice are to be avoided in patients treated with avacopan. 
Effect of avacopan on other medicinal products 
Avacopan is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 in vivo and may increase the plasma exposures of 
concomitant medicinal products that are CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., 
alfentanil, ciclosporin, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, sirolimus and tacrolimus). Be 
cautious when these medicinal products are used with avacopan. Patients must be managed according 
to the summary of product characteristics of the respective medicinal products with a narrow 
therapeutic index. 
Effect of macrogolglycerol hydroxystearate on sensitive P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates 
A clinically relevant effect of the excipient macrogolglycerol hydroxystearate on sensitive P-gp 
substrates with relatively low bioavailability (e.g., dabigatran etexilate) cannot be excluded. Exercise 
caution when using low-bioavailability P-gp substrates in patients who are being treated with 
avacopan.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of avacopan in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Avacopan is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
Avacopan has not been measured in milk of lactating animals; however, avacopan has been detected in 
the plasma of nursing animal offspring without apparent offspring effects (see section 5.3). 
A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from therapy with avacopan, taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of avacopan on human fertility. Animal data did not indicate any 
impairment of male or female fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Tavneos has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Liver function test increased  
In the pivotal phase 3 study in which 330 patients were dosed, 13.3% of patients in the avacopan 
group and 11.6% of patients in the prednisone group had an adverse reaction of elevated liver function 
test (LFT). 
In the avacopan group, LFT increased was reported in the phase 3 study and included hepatitis (1.2%), 
hepatitis cholestatic (0.6%) of which one patient reported both hepatitis and hepatitis cholestatic as a 
diagnosis, hepatocellular injury (0.6%) in one patient diagnosed with asymptomatic hepatitis, cytolysis 
and anicteric cholestasis without hepatocellular insufficiency. 
In the pivotal phase 3 study, adverse events of hepatobiliary disorders were more frequent in patients 
treated with a regimen based on a combination with cyclophosphamide followed by azathioprine 
(10.2%) as compared to those treated with a regimen based on a combination with rituximab (3.7%). 
Study medicinal product was paused or discontinued permanently due to LFT increased in 5.4% of 
patients in the avacopan group and 3.0% of patients in the prednisone group. Serious adverse reactions 
of LFT increased were reported in 5.4% of patients in the avacopan group and 3.7% of patients in the 
prednisone group. All serious hepatic events resolved with either the withdrawal of avacopan and/or 
other potentially hepatotoxic medicinal products, including trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole.

Neutropenia 
In the pivotal phase 3 study, neutropenia was reported in 4 patients (2.4%) in each treatment group. 
A single case of agranulocytosis was reported each in the prednisone group and in the avacopan group. 
The patient in the avacopan group was noted to have central neutropenia on a bone marrow biopsy 
which resolved spontaneously without additional treatment. 
Creatine phosphokinase increased 
In the pivotal phase 3 study, 6 patients (3.6%) in the avacopan group and 1 patient (0.6%) in the 
prednisone group had adverse reactions of increased creatine phosphokinase (CPK). 
Hypersensitivity including angioedema 
In the pivotal phase 3 study, 2 patients (1.2%) in the avacopan group had an adverse reaction of 
angioedema. One patient was hospitalised for the event. Avacopan was paused and both events 
resolved without sequelae. Avacopan was restarted in one patient and angioedema did not reoccur. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
In the pivotal phase 3 study, adverse reactions of gastrointestinal disorders were observed in 74.6% of 
patients treated with avacopan and a regimen based on a combination with cyclophosphamide 
followed by azathioprine as compared to those treated with a regimen based on a combination with 
rituximab (53.3%). 
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
A total of 3 adolescents were studied in the phase 3 study, one in the prednisone group and two in the 
avacopan group. There are no data in children below 12 years of age (see section 5.1). 
Elderly patients 
The safety profile was similar between patients ≥ 65 years of age and adult patients < 65 years of age 
in the clinical studies. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Avacopan was studied in healthy subjects at a maximum total daily dose of 200 mg (given as 100 mg 
twice daily) for 7 days without evidence of dose limiting toxicities. In case of an overdose, it is 
recommended that the patient is monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse effects, and 
appropriate symptomatic treatment and supportive care are provided.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Complement inhibitors, ATC code: L04AJ05 
Mechanism of action 
Avacopan is a selective antagonist of the human complement 5a receptor (C5aR1 or CD88) and 
competitively inhibits the interaction between C5aR1 and the anaphylatoxin C5a. 
The specific and selective blockade of C5aR1 by avacopan reduces the pro-inflammatory effects of 
C5a, which include neutrophil activation, migration, and adherence to sites of small blood vessel 
inflammation, vascular endothelial cell retraction and permeability. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Avacopan blocks the C5a-induced upregulation of CD11b (integrin alpha M) on neutrophils taken 
from humans dosed with avacopan. CD11b facilitates neutrophil adherence to vascular endothelial 
surfaces, one of the steps in the vasculitis disease process. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
A total of 330 patients aged 13 years or older with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (54.8%) or 
microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) (45.2%) were treated in the active-comparator, randomised, double-
blind, double-dummy, multicentre, pivotal phase 3 ADVOCATE study for 52 weeks. 
The ADVOCATE study design is depicted in Figure 1. 
Figure 1  ADVOCATE study design 
AZA = azathioprine; CYC = cyclophosphamide; IV = intravenous; MMF = mycophenolate mofetil; 
RTX =rituximab 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two groups: 
• 
Avacopan group (N = 166): Patients received 30 mg avacopan twice daily for 52 weeks plus 
prednisone-matching placebo tapering regimen over 20 weeks, 
Comparator group (N = 164): Patients received avacopan-matching placebo twice daily for 
52 weeks plus prednisone (tapered from 60 mg/day to 0 over 20 weeks). 
• 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All patients in both groups received standard immunosuppressive regimens of either: 
Rituximab at the dose of 375 mg/m² for 4 weekly intravenous doses, or 
• 
Intravenous cyclophosphamide for 13 weeks (15 mg/kg up to 1.2 g every 2 to 3 weeks), and 
• 
then starting on week 15 oral azathioprine 1 mg/kg daily with titration up to 2 mg/kg daily 
(Mycophenolate mofetil 2 g daily was allowed in place of azathioprine. If mycophenolate 
mofetil was not tolerated or not available, enteric coated mycophenolate sodium could be given 
at a target dose of 1,440 mg/day), or 
Oral cyclophosphamide for 14 weeks (2 mg/kg daily) followed by oral azathioprine or 
mycophenolate mofetil/sodium starting at week 15 (same dosing regimen as intravenous 
cyclophosphamide). 
• 
For the first rituximab infusion, 100 mg methylprednisolone, or equivalent was given before starting 
the infusion with rituximab. Glucocorticoid pre-medication for the second, third, and fourth rituximab 
infusions was allowed. 
Dose reductions or adjustments in cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and mycophenolate were allowed 
to conform to standard approaches to maximize safety of these medicinal products. 
The following study-supplied glucocorticoid tapering schedule was used (Table 2).

Non-study supplied glucocorticoids, unless strictly necessary due to a condition requiring the use of 
glucocorticoids (such as adrenal insufficiency), had to be avoided as much as possible during the 
study. However, patients who experienced worsening or a relapse of their ANCA-associated vasculitis 
during the study could be treated with a limited course of glucocorticoids. 
Patients were stratified at time of randomisation to obtain balance across treatment groups based on 
3 factors: 
• 
• 
• 
Newly-diagnosed or relapsed ANCA-associated vasculitis, 
Proteinase-3 (PR3) positive or myeloperoxidase (MPO) positive ANCA-associated vasculitis, 
Receiving either intravenous rituximab, intravenous cyclophosphamide, or oral 
cyclophosphamide. 
The two treatment groups were well balanced regarding baseline demographics and disease 
characteristics of patients (Table 3).

The aim of the study was to determine if avacopan could provide an effective treatment for patients 
with ANCA-associated vasculitis, while also allowing for the reduction of glucocorticoids use without 
compromising safety or efficacy. 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of the above described treatment regimens to 
induce and sustain remission in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis based on the following two 
primary endpoints: 
• 
the proportion of patients in disease remission defined as achieving a Birmingham Vasculitis 
Activity Score (BVAS) of 0 and not taking glucocorticoids for treatment of ANCA-associated 
vasculitis within 4 weeks prior to week 26, 
the proportion of patients in sustained remission defined as remission at week 26 without 
relapse to week 52, and BVAS of 0 and not taking glucocorticoids for treatment of ANCA-
associated vasculitis within 4 weeks prior to week 52. 
• 
The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially for non-inferiority and superiority using a

Glucocorticoid toxicity 
In the pivotal phase 3 ADVOCATE study, the mean total cumulative prednisone-equivalent dose from 
day 1 to end-of-treatment was approximately 2.3-fold higher in the comparator group versus the 
avacopan group (3846.9 mg vs 1675.5 mg, respectively). 
From baseline to week 26, 86.1 % of patients using avacopan received non-study supplied 
glucocorticoids. In the comparator group, the majority of glucocorticoids use was due to the protocol-
defined prednisone course.

The Glucocorticoid Toxicity Index (GTI) assesses glucocorticoid-related morbidity, including 
measures of body mass index, glucose tolerance, lipids, steroid myopathy, skin toxicity, 
neuropsychiatric toxicity, and infection. A higher GTI indicates greater glucocorticoid toxicity. The 
GTI contains the Cumulative Worsening Score (CWS) that captures cumulative toxicity over the 
course of time, and the Aggregate Improvement Score (AIS) that captures both improvement and 
worsening of toxicity over time. 
The two GTI scores (CWS and AIS) of the avacopan group versus the comparator group are 
summarised in Table 6. The GTI measures were secondary endpoints in the study and not controlled 
for multiplicity

A total of 3 adolescents were studied in the pivotal phase 3 ADVOCATE study, two in the avacopan 
group and one in the comparator group. One adolescent in the avacopan group discontinued treatment 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
due to worsening renal vasculitis. The second adolescent patient who received avacopan completed 
treatment, achieved both remission at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52. 
The adolescent in the comparator group discontinued treatment due to non-adherence to contraception. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
avacopan in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of ANCA-associated 
vasculitis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
When administered without food, avacopan peak plasma concentration (Cmax) occurs at a median time 
(tmax) of approximately 2 hours. Avacopan has shown an approximate dose-proportional increase in 
systemic exposure in the dose range of 10 to 30 mg. 
Co-administration of 30 mg in capsule formulation with a high-fat, high-calorie meal increases the 
plasma exposure (AUC) of avacopan by approximately 72% and delays tmax by approximately 3 hours; 
however, the Cmax is not affected. 
Distribution 
The reversible plasma protein binding (e.g., to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein) of avacopan and 
metabolite M1 is greater than 99.9%. The apparent volume of distribution is high 
(Vz/F 3,000 – 11,000 L), indicating broad tissue distribution of the active substance. 
Biotransformation 
Avacopan is eliminated mainly through phase I metabolism. Following oral administration of 
radiolabelled avacopan, the bulk of the active substance-related materials was recovered in faeces in 
the form of phase I metabolites. One major circulating metabolite (M1), a mono-hydroxylated product 
of avacopan, was present at ~ 12% of the total active substance-related materials in plasma. This 
metabolite constitutes 30 to 50% of the parent exposure and has approximately the same activity as 
avacopan on C5aR1. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for the clearance 
of avacopan and for the formation and clearance of metabolite M1. 
Avacopan is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 as indicated by a modest increase in the AUC 
of the probe active substances midazolam (1.81-fold) and celecoxib (1.15-fold), respectively. 
In vitro, avacopan is not an inhibitor or an inducer of other CYP enzymes. 
Avacopan showed negligible to weak inhibition of common transporters in vitro. Therefore, clinically 
relevant interactions are unlikely when avacopan is co-administered with substances that are substrates 
or inhibitors of these transporters. 
Elimination 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the total apparent body clearance (CL/F) of avacopan 
is 16.3 L/h (95% CI: 13.1 – 21.1 L/h). The median terminal elimination half-life is 510 hours (21 days) 
based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. When avacopan is stopped after steady state has been 
reached, the residual plasma concentration of avacopan is projected to decrease to ~ 20%, < 10%, and 
< 5% of the steady state maximum concentration approximately 4 weeks, 7 weeks, and 10 weeks, 
respectively, after the last dose. 
Following oral administration of radiolabelled avacopan, about 77% and 10% of the radioactivity was 
recovered in faeces and urine, respectively, and 7% and < 0.1% of the radioactive dose was recovered 
as unchanged avacopan in faeces and urine, respectively. These results suggest that the main route of 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clearance of avacopan is metabolism followed by biliary excretion of the metabolites into faeces, and 
that direct excretion of avacopan into urine or faeces via bile is negligible. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis found no significant effect of age (among adults) on the plasma 
exposure of avacopan; however, there were limited pharmacokinetic data in patients over 75 years of 
age in clinical studies. No dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetic properties of avacopan have been examined in 16 subjects with mild (Child-
Pugh class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment. When compared to normal 
controls, no pharmacologically relevant differences in exposure (mean ratios of Cmax and AUC ≤ 1.3) 
of avacopan or its major metabolite M1 was observed; therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary (see 
section 4.2). 
Avacopan has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) (see 
section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the plasma exposure of avacopan is similar between 
patients with renal impairment and healthy subjects. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary based 
on renal function (see section 4.2). 
Avacopan has not been studied in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis with an eGFR 
below 15 mL/min/1.73 m², who are on dialysis, in need of dialysis or plasma exchange. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
Avacopan produced no effects on male or female reproductive performance (fertility) or early 
development in hamsters at oral doses equivalent up to 6.8-fold the clinical AUC. 
Embryo-foetal development 
Avacopan was not teratogenic when dosed orally to hamsters and rabbits. In hamsters, an increased 
incidence of skeletal variations (short thoracolumbar supernumerary rib) was observed at exposure 
equivalent to 5.3-fold the clinical AUC. In rabbits, avacopan caused maternal toxicity (adverse clinical 
signs and abortions), but no foetal toxicity at 0.6-fold the clinical AUC. 
Pre- and post-natal development 
Avacopan did not result in adverse effects in female offspring when administered in hamsters at 
exposures up to 6.3-fold the clinical AUC during gestation and through lactation until weaning. In 
males, there was a slight delay in preputial separation at 3.7-fold the clinical AUC. This isolated 
finding was considered to be of low toxicological significance and was not associated with any 
impairment of reproductive performance.  
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Analysis of avacopan plasma levels in the lactating dams and the plasma levels in nursing offspring 
showed the presence of avacopan, suggesting that avacopan is likely secreted into the milk of lactating 
hamsters. 
Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of avacopan was evaluated in a 2-year study in both rats and hamsters. 
In male rats, a slightly increased incidence of C-cell thyroid adenoma was noted in avacopan-treated 
rats; this increase was not statistically significant, and the incidence was within the historical control 
range. Avacopan was not carcinogenic in hamsters, the pharmacologically relevant species.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tavneos is and what it is used for 
What is Tavneos? 
Tavneos contains the active substance avacopan, which attaches to a specific protein in the body, 
called complement 5a receptor. 
What is Tavneos used for? 
Tavneos is used to treat adults with a gradually worsening disease caused by inflammation of the small 
blood vessels, called granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA): 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis mainly affects small blood vessels and tissues in the 
• 
kidneys, lung, throat, nose and sinuses, but also other organs. Patients develop small lumps 
(granulomas) in and around blood vessels, which are formed by tissue damage caused by 
inflammation. 
Microscopic polyangiitis affects the smaller blood vessels. It often affects the kidneys but may 
also affect other organs. 
• 
Complement 5a receptor has a key role in stimulating inflammation. This medicine attaches to it and 
prevents it from working, thereby reducing inflammation of blood vessels seen in these diseases. 
Tavneos can be used together with other treatments prescribed by your doctor.

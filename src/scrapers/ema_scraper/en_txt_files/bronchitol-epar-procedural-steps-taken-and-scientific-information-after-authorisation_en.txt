Since the completion of the PASS on the UK registry, most 
RMP template (GVP module V, revision 2). In 
addition, the UK CF Registry study (cat 2, PASS) has 
been removed from the RMP following its 
completion; and clinical trial as well as post-
marketing exposure and safety information have 
been updated to reflect the results of the DPM-CF-
303 study (previously assessed in 
EMEA/H/C/001252/II/0034) and the information 
presented in the latest PSUR #9 (PSUSA/

safety concerns did not have additional pharmacovigilance 
activities ongoing or planned as well as additional 
minimisation measures and thus, could be removed from 
the list of the safety concerns in accordance with the GVP 
module V Rev 2. In light of this, PRAC agreed with the 
MAH’s proposal to maintain ‘Haemoptysis’, ‘Bronchospasm’ 
and ‘cough’ as important identified risks and ‘Increased risk 
of respiratory or systemic infection’ as important potential 
risk. Furthermore, considering that the safety profile of 
Bronchitol may differ in patients with medical history of 
severe haemoptysis and patients with <30% predicted 
FEV1 and thus that these patients remain a population in 
need of further characterization; PRAC agreed to maintain 
those safety concerns as missing information in the RMP; 
PRAC also recommended to closely monitor ‘Patients who 
have had significant haemoptysis in last 3 months’ and 
‘Patients with <30% predicted FEV1’ via routine 
pharmacovigilance and to report and discuss any new 
significant data within future PSURs.

The cystic fibrosis study PASS was a condition of the 
EMEA/H/C/PSR/S/0020 
marketing authorisation of Bronchitol. Therefore, in view of 
the available data regarding the PASS final study report, 
the PRAC considered that changes to the conditions of the 
marketing authorisation were warranted. The PRAC 
recommends the deletion of the obligation to conduct post-
authorisation measures in the section D of the Annex II.

SmPC and PL 
The MAH submitted a variation to update section 4.8 and 
to update the frequency of certain adverse events 
and to update the clinical safety and efficacy 
information based on the results of the clinical data 
from Study CF 303. This is a phase 3 safety and 
efficacy clinical trial in adult cystic fibrosis subjects. 
The package leaflet is updated accordingly.  
In addition, some clarifications and minor editorial 
changes were made in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5 of 
the SmPC and in Annex A. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

data 
5.1 of the Product Information to reflect the results from a 
completed phase 3 study CF 303 (supplementing the two 
pivotal trials submitted with the initial Marketing 
Authorisation application). The study was a double-blind, 
randomised, controlled, parallel group, multicentric trial in 
adult cystic fibrosis patients with age 18 years and above. 
The key aspects of the study design were consistent with 
the earlier pivotal studies. 
The study met the primary endpoint. Mannitol 
demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in 
absolute change in FEV1 over 26-week treatment period 
compared to the control arm (a sub-therapeutic dose of 
mannitol). However, the treatment effect of Bronchitol on 
FEV1 was less evident in the subgroup of patients who 
were receiving concomitant rhDNAse. In addition, Study 
303 did not show a superior treatment effect of Bronchitol 
on FEV for female patients, in whom the underlying cystic 
fibrosis disease course may be worse than males for

reasons that are not fully understood. The updated 
frequency of some Adverse Events following the extension 
of the safety dataset and post-marketing spontaneous 
reporting has also been reflected in the product 
information. The benefit-risk balance of Bronchitol remains 
positive.

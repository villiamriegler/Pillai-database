1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Ipsen Pharma submitted on 22 June 2016 an application for marketing authorisation to the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xermelo, through the centralised procedure falling within the 
Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 23 January 2014. 
Xermelo, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/09/661 on 08 October 2009 in the 
following condition:  treatment of carcinoid tumours. The orphan drug designation was amended on 30 
May 2016 to the following condition: treatment of carcinoid syndrome. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Xermelo is indicated as an adjunct to somatostatin analogue therapy for the long-term treatment of 
carcinoid syndrome to improve symptom control in adult patients with metastatic neuroendocrine 
tumours. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Xermelo as an orphan medicinal product in its approved 
indications. The outcome of the COMP review can be found on the Agency's website:  
ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human medicines/Rare disease designation. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0318/2015 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity

scientific discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting a marketing 
authorisation to Xermelo on 20 July 2017.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), formerly known as carcinoid tumours, are a 
relatively rare tumour type that arises from cells of the neuroendocrine system.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
In 2013, a pan-European project investigated the prevalence of NETs and concluded that approximately 
100,000 people were diagnosed with NETs and still alive in the EU27 at the beginning of 20081 which 
would correspond to approximately 103,000 prevalent cases when extrapolated to the population of the 
EU28 plus 3 other countries (Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland) in 2015 (ie, 2 cases per 10,000 
inhabitants). This value represents the most recent and accurate estimate based on EU-specific studies. 
Taking into account the highest occurrence estimate, the prevalence of CS would therefore be 1 cases per 
10,000 , which represent around -52.000 patients in the EU (EU28 population = 515,865,302 people in 
2016 according to Eurostat).  
Neuroendocrine tumours can appear at any age, but they are more common in individuals over 40 years 
of age, with an incidence being highest in patients aged 65 years and older. They are slightly more 
frequent in male patients as well as in white patients. ,  2  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
NETs can synthesise, store, and release a variety of polypeptides, biogenic amines, and prostaglandins, 
which are responsible for the Carcinoid syndrome (CS). CS results from various bioactive amides and 
peptides produced by some NETs, such as neuron-specific enolase (NSE), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 
5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), synaptophysin and chromagranins A and C and other peptides such as  
insulin , growth hormone, neurotensin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), 
beta-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, gastrin, pancreatic polypeptide, calcitonin and various other 
growth factors (eg TGF-beta , platelet derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor).  The relative 
contributions of each and specificity of any of these molecules for particular components of the syndrome 
are uncertain. As the liver inactivates bioactive products secreted into the portal circulation patients with 
NETs only acquire the CS if they develop hepatic metastases. Altered metabolism of tryptophan occurs in 
almost all patients with CS. Physiologically approximately 1% of dietary tryptophan is converted to 
serotonin. This value may increase to 70% or more in patients with CS. Serotonin is metabolised to 
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). Tumour production of serotonin is the most likely cause of the 
diarrhoea in CS, as serotonin stimulates intestinal secretion and motility and inhibits intestinal absorption.

Furthermore, serotonin may also stimulate fibroblast growth and fibrogenesis. These effects can lead to 
peritoneal and cardiac valvular fibrosis associated with CS. , 3  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Carcinoid syndrome (CS) occurs when well-differentiated NETs secrete large amounts of serotonin and 
other vasoactive products into the systemic circulation. Classically, symptoms associated with CS include 
cutaneous flushing, diarrhoea, wheezing, abdominal pain, and valvular heart disease.4   
Predictors of poor prognosis at the time of diagnosis of NETs include older age, sex, histological type, 
location of origin, tumour stage5, 6 and the presence of elevated urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid 
(u5-HIAA) levels.7 
From the time of diagnosis of metastatic NETs, median survival has been estimated to be approximately 
31-75 months. ,  The most frequent cause of death in patients with NETs is liver failure due to hepatic 
replacement by tumour.  
Roughly 3 quarters of CS patients experience diarrhoea8, which results in an estimated prevalence figure 
of 26,693 cases of CS associated with diarrhoea. Uncontrolled diarrhoea may contribute to deterioration 
in overall health and affect the ability of patients to endure complications of their cancer and its 
treatment. Uncontrolled diarrhoea can lead to weight loss, malnutrition, dehydration, and electrolyte 
imbalance; when severe, malabsorption may occur and may even cause death.9, 10, 11 Valvular heart 
disease has been associated with high serotonin levels as measured by its metabolite, u5-HIAA. Due to 
the slow-growing nature of NETs and the prolonged course of disease, about 50% of patients with CS will 
eventually develop heart disease, which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. , 12, 13 
5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) is a major metabolite of serotonin and it is excreted in the urine and 
can be monitored as a surrogate of 5-HT levels.  Levels of 5-HIAA have no clear correlation with 
symptoms, but they do fluctuate with symptomatology.  However, some patients with carcinoid tumour 
have symptoms of flushing with low or normal levels of 5-HIAA.  Additionally, 5-HIAA levels reflect the 
actions of somatostatin analogues, with a 50% reduction from pretreatment levels being indicative of a 
biochemical response. In epidemiological studies, high levels of u5-HIAA in patients with NETs have been 
associated with poor survival. van der Horst-Schrivers et al prospectively studied 76 patients with midgut 
well-differentiated NETs. Urine collected over a 24-hour period every 3 months was tested for u5-HIAA 
levels. Patients with high u5-HIAA level (>20 mmol/mol creatinine) had a median survival of 33 months

1.66-6.66; p=0.001).14,15 
2.1.5.  Management 
Somatostatin analogues (SSAs), such as lanreotide and octreotide are the standard therapy for the relief 
of CS and tumor stasis. Somatostatin analogs inhibit the release of serotonin by NETs and have become 
first-line therapy for CS providing the most efficient treatment for the control of flushing, diarrhea, and 
other symptoms.16 Results from the PROMID and CLARINET studies demonstrated the antiproliferative 
effects of octreotide and lanreotide Autogel. 17, 18 Therefore, use of SSAs to reduce tumour proliferation 
has become increasingly common in the treatment paradigm for many patients with NET with or without 
symptoms. 
There is also some use of supplemental doses of short-acting SSA therapy for those who do not have 
sufficient control with a long-acting release (LAR) Depot formulation. Surgical debulking of tumours, 
radiation, various liver-directed therapies, and chemotherapy may be attempted as a way of addressing 
overall tumour burden and reducing associated serotonin production., 19, 20 There are no approved 
treatment options for patients not adequately controlled on SSAs, who continue to experience debilitating 
symptoms. Since there are limited treatment options available in refractory CS, pasireotide injections 
might be considered in highly selected patients when other treatments failed or are not feasible. However, 
pasireotide is not approved for the treatment of CS. 
The effect of SSA therapy may diminish with time after 3 months up to more than 2 years of 
treatment. 21, 22, 23 Based on the evidence reported, , , 24 , it appears that tachyphylaxis may occur in 
10.0% to 63.6% patients, or hepatic tumour load can increase. When a patient’s response to SSA therapy 
declines, it is an accepted practice to continue SSA therapy while initiating additional treatments, 
including additional prescribed and over-the counter medications.25

About the product 
Telotristat etiprate is an orally administered small molecule inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH).  In 
the blood telotristat etiprate appears as telotristat ethyl and its active metabolite telotristat (LX1033 or 
LP-778902).  
LX1033 or LP-778902, the active metabolite of telotristat etiprate, was designed not to cross the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB). A previously studied TPH inhibitor, parachlorophenylalanine, failed in clinical 
development because it crossed the BBB and resulted in serious central nervous system (CNS) side 
effects (Engelman 1967, Turaga et al., 2011). A peripherally acting TPH inhibitor such as telotristat 
etiprate should alleviate CS with a better CNS profile allowing for long-term treatment. 
Both the prodrug (telotristat ethyl) and its active metabolite (telotristat) are inhibitors of L-tryptophan 
hydroxylases (TPH1 and TPH2, the rate limiting steps in serotonin biosynthesis). Serotonin plays a critical 
role in regulating several major physiological processes, including secretion, motility, inflammation, and 
sensation of the gastrointestinal tract, and is over-secreted in patients with carcinoid syndrome. Through 
inhibition of peripheral TPH1, telotristat reduces the production of serotonin, thus alleviating symptoms 
associated with carcinoid syndrome. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
•  Xermelo is indicated as an adjunct to somatostatin analogue therapy for the long-term treatment 
of carcinoid syndrome to improve symptom control in adult patients with metastatic 
neuroendocrine tumours. 
The final agreed indication is as following: 
•  Xermelo is indicated for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome diarrhoea in combination with 
somatostatin analogue (SSA) therapy in adults inadequately controlled by SSA therapy. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 250 mg three times daily (tid).  
Available data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment.  
It is recommended to reassess the benefit of continued therapy in a patient not responding within this 
time period. 
Based on the high inter-subject variability observed, accumulation in a subset of patients with carcinoid 
syndrome cannot be excluded. Therefore, intake of higher doses is not recommended (see section 5.2).

For the film-coating: polyvinyl alcohol (partially hydrolysed) (E1203), titanium dioxide (E 171), macrogol 
3350 (E1521) and talc (E553b). 
The product is available in PVC/PCTFE/PVC/Al blisters as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active  substance 
General information 
The chemical name of telotristat etiprate is 
[(1S)-1-[[4-[2-amino-6-[(1R)-1-[4-chloro-2-(3-methylpyrazol-1-yl)phenyl]-2,2,2-trifluoro-ethoxy]pyri
midin-4-yl]phenyl]methyl]-2-ethoxy-2-oxo-ethyl]ammonium; 2-benzamidoacetate corresponding to the 
molecular formula C 27H26ClF3N6O3 • C9H9NO3.  Telotristat etiprate is a salt containing telotristat ethyl 
and hippurate. It has a relative molecular mass of 754.2 g/mol and the following structure: 
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white to off-white crystalline powder. Its solubility is 
pH-dependent. Due to its low permeability and low solubility, it is classified as BSC class 4. 
Telotristat etiprate exhibits isomerism as it contains two chiral centre. Enantiomeric purity is controlled 
routinely by chiral HPLC.  
Polymorphism has been observed for the active substance under certain conditions, notably under stress 
conditions using solvents and/or conditions not employed during active substance manufacture. The 
Applicant consistently produces the same polymorphic form.   
The Applicant has performed comparative structural analysis to show that telotristat etiprate is to be 
regarded as a new active substance (NAS) in itself and that it is not a salt, complex, derivative or isomer 
(nor mixture of isomers) of a previously authorised substance.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is synthesized by one manufacturer in a six-step synthesis using well-defined 
starting materials with acceptable specifications.  
Since the use of class I solvent in the synthesis of one of the starting materials is avoidable, the CHMP 
recommended the deletion of the synthesis that uses class I solvent to manufacture the starting material. 
A rework procedure has also been proposed and it is considered acceptable. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Assessment report  
EMA/508026/2017  
Page 14/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The structure of the active substance has been confirmed by the following methods: elemental 
analysis, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and 2-D NMR, FT-IR, UV analysis, MS, MS/MS, XRPD, optical rotation and 
DSC. The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU 
guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities including genotoxic 
impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in LDPE bag closed with a tie placed into a second LDPE bag, also closed 
with a tie and placed in a HDPE drum or equivalent secondary container. The LDPE bag complies with Ph. 
Eur. monograph 3.1.3 (Polyolefins) and the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identity (IR, HPLC, chiral HPLC), assay 
(HPLC), impurities (HPLC, chiral HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), and residue on 
ignition (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
Justifications were provided and accepted for the omissions of a number of tests including particle size 
distribution, specific optical rotation, polymorphism control, microbial analysis and specific residual 
impurities.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data are provided for several batches of the active substance including production scale 
batches manufactured at the proposed manufacturing site according to the commercial process.  
Batches manufactured with initial manufacturing processes show OOS results for impurities and assay. 
Otherwise, all batches are within specifications and demonstrate batch to batch consistency of the 
manufacturing process. 
Stability 
Stability data were provided for three production scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for 18 months under long term conditions at 25 
ºC / 60% RH and minimum 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the 
ICH guidelines. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, identification, assay, related substances, water 
content and stereoisomeric impurities. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and 
were stability indicating.  
For the long term and accelerated storage conditions, all tested parameters were within the 
specifications. No significant changes were observed. A slight increasing trend is observed for impurities 
when stored at 25°C/ 60% RH. When stored at 40°C/ 75% RH an increase of one impurity, which is well 
within the specified limit, is observed. 
A forced degradation study was performed on one batch in both solid and solution state (solid state: heat,  
photolytic stress according to ICH Q1B option 1, solution state: acid, base, oxidation,  photolytic stress). 
Assessment report  
EMA/508026/2017  
Page 15/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The results of stress tests showed that the active substance is susceptible to acidic, oxidative and 
photolytic conditions. The active substance is stable when submitted to thermal/humid and photolytic 
stress. Active substance solutions however showed pronounced degradation when submitted to forced 
degradation. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months in the proposed 
container.   
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is white to off-white, film-coated oval tablet with “T-E” debossed on one side and 
“250” debossed on the other side.  
Telotristat etiprate is an inhibitor of the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase, and is thus a serotonin synthesis 
inhibitor. Telotristat ethyl is the prodrug of the pharmacologically active entity, LP-778902 (LX-1033), 
which is the product of hydrolysis of the ethyl ester of telotristat etiprate. Although LP-778902 (LX1033) 
is the active moiety, it has very low permeability and is a Pg-p substrate; therefore the prodrug, telotristat 
ethyl , was synthetized to increase permeability, increase exposure to the target (the enzyme 
tryptophane hydroxylase), and to enhance oral bioavailability for the active moiety to the systemic 
serotonin producing tumors. 
As a starting point, the scientific approach for product development followed a Quality Target Product 
Profile (QTPP) which took into account the expected route of administration; the dosage form and the 
stability expected (refer to table 2). This development program supported product development activities 
and provided key inputs to the formulation and process design such as the finished product composition 
intended for commercial products and the general manufacturing pathway.

Physicochemical characteristics of the active substance like solid-state forms, biopharmaceutical 
attributes, particle size, hygroscopicity, chemical stability and compatibility with excipients have been 
taken into account for the pharmaceutical development. 
The effect of active substance particle size distribution on dissolution of finished product batches has been 
determined.  
The compatibility of the active substance with the excipients has been adequately demonstrated. The 
role, the choice of the excipients and their concentration has been satisfactorily justified. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards with the exception of the film-coating material which is tested according to an in-house 
specification. However all components of the film-coating material comply with Ph. Eur. standards.   
Additional controls are also included in the lactose anhydrous and hydroxypropyl cellulose specifications. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Different formulations of the finished product have been produced for the clinical studies and their 
composition and improvements regarding product performance have been shown precisely.  
The initial goal of telotristat etiprate clinical product development was to develop a capsule formulation 
that facilitated assessment of a range of doses. During stability studies of the telotristat etiprate capsules 
used in initial clinical studies, significant hydrolysis of telotristat etiprate was observed, and thus 
development studies were performed to create a chemically more stable tablet formulation.  
The goal of telotristat etiprate product Phase 3 clinical formulation and commercial formulation 
development was to develop a tablet dosage form with requisite active substance stability, fast 
dissolution profile, high drug loading (250 mg free base per tablet), and satisfactory manufacturability. 
The critical quality attributes for telotristat etiprate tablets as identification, assay, content uniformity, 
dissolution, related substances, water content and microbial limits which affect the safety and efficacy 
have been assessed during product and process development. 
Bioequivalence study was performed between the 250 mg capsule formulation and the proposed 250 mg 
tablet commercial formulation. Bioequivalence between the two formulations could not be concluded.  
Dissolution method was satisfactorily developed. The dissolution testing has been performed in different 
buffers covering the physiological pH range.  
The dissolution method has been demonstrated to discriminate tablets with different levels of coating as 
well as different formulations i.e. coated tablets vs capsules.  
During manufacturing process development the final manufacturing process up to production scale batch 
size was selected and optimised. Some QbD elements were used during the development phase to 
investigate the Critical Quality Attributes (CQA) that could impact the Quality Target Product Profile 
(QTPP) and to identify the critical process parameters (CPPs), the classical approach has been retained for 
the control strategy of commercial batches and no design space is claimed.

The primary packaging is a PVC/PCTFE/PVC film with paper backed push-through aluminium foil blister. 
The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 8 main steps: pre-roller compacting blending, roller compaction 
and  milling,  final  blending,  tablet  compression,  tablet  coating,  primary  packaging.  The  process  is 
considered to be a standard manufacturing process.  
Critical process parameters were identified. The in-process controls are suitable for this type of 
manufacturing process. Optimum operating ranges evaluated during pharmaceutical development are 
proven acceptable ranges. Formal validation will be performed post-approval on the first three 
consecutive commercial batches, prior to launching the product. An acceptable validation plan has been 
provided. In addition the applicant has provided the validation data for three commercial scale batches 
manufactured for US market to support the process validation for the EU batches. The results confirm that 
the process is reproducible. 
Product specification  
The finished product specifications  include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form : product 
appearance (Visual), tablet dimensions, identification (HPLC), assay (HPLC), degradation products 
(HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution, water content (KF), microbial purity (Ph. Eur.). 
The omission of chiral purity and crystallinity test from the finished product specification has been 
justified based on batch analysis and stability data. There is also no specification for inorganic impurities 
based on a risk assessment as per ICH Q3D and batch data.  Absence of hardness and friability control in 
the specification was justified. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three pilot scale batches and one production scale batch confirming 
the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data were provided for 3 pilot scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions 
for 24 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH or 30 °C / 75% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines. The batches of medicinal product are representative 
to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for tablet description, assay, degradation products, dissolution, water content, and 
microbiological quality. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
No significant changes have been observed. 
In addition, two pilot batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. Results demonstrate that the product is not light sensitive. 
Assessment report  
EMA/508026/2017

A cycling temperature stability study has been conducted on two finished product batches.  Results 
demonstrated that the freezing-thawing cycles do not impact the quality of the finished product as results 
of the test are all within the specification. 
Additional stress stability studies performed at -20°C/ambient humidity for up to 24 months and at 
50°C/ambient humidity and 60°C/ambient humidity for 4 weeks concluded that extreme temperatures do 
not impact the quality of the finished product as results remain within set specifications. The only 
parameter that changed significantly was appearance after 4 weeks at 60°C/ambient humidity, with 
tablets changing from a white tablet with a white core to a cream /tan colored tablet with a white core. 
Nevertheless, as the quality control testing for all other tests (including assay and degradation impurities) 
are well below the specification limits this change is judged to not impact the finished  product quality and 
therefore no specific storage conditions should be set on labelling. 
Samples of a full-scale production batch have been included in a study to confirm the bulk stability of the 
tablets in the production area. The packaging is the same as intended for commercial production. Stability 
of bulk tables is demonstrated.  
A simulating shipping study was carried out. It was concluded that packaging configuration chosen is 
suitable for shipment of bulk tablet by road or by air. All results met the specifications. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 30 months with no specific labelling statement 
as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issues related to the active 
substance starting material synthesis having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
Deletion of Option 1 route of synthesis for a specific the starting material through a variation at the latest 
before the renewal of the marketing authorisation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, 
reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were performed according to GLP principles. Telotristat 
etiprate was evaluated in mice, rats, dogs, rabbits  and monkeys models.  Primary pharmacodynamics of 
telotristat etiprate/ethyl and/or its active metabolite LP-778902 were tested in vitro and in vivo. One 
enzyme (human TPH isoforms) and two cell-based (rat and human cells) in vitro assays were performed 
to show the inhibitory effect of telotristat etiprate, telotristat ethyl or LP-778902 on its target TPH and off 
target effects on human phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). In vivo 
pharmacodynamics after a single or multiple doses of telotristat etiprate/ethyl were determined in mice, 
rats, dogs and monkeys. 
The acute and repeated-dose toxicity of etiprate was studied in mice, rats and dogs. The dog was used as 
the non-rodent species for toxicity studies as it had systemic exposure to both telotristat ethyl and 
LP-778902 after oral dosing. Developmental and reproductive toxicity studies were performed in rat and 
rabbit, carcinogenicity studies were performed in mice. A 2 year rat carcinogenicity study is still ongoing. 
The pivotal studies of this programme were conducted in compliance with GLP regulations. 
The whole package of reproductive toxicity studies was conducted in accordance with ICH S5. 
Embryofoetal development studies in rats and rabbits were preceded by dose range finding studies (DRF), 
whereas dose selection for the remaining reproductive toxicity studies was based on the results of the 
repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and - additionally for the prenatal and postnatal development study 
- on the results of the embryofoetal development study, respectively. All studies including DRF studies 
were performed in compliance with GLP. For all studies the oral route of administration (gavage) was 
chosen and methylcellulose in purified water served as vehicle. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro 
One enzyme (human TPH isoforms) and two cell-based (rat and human cells) in vitro assays were 
performed to show the inhibitory effect of telotristat etiprate, telotristat ethyl or LP-778902 on its target 
TPH and off target effects on human phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH).

metabolite (LP-778902)  and  minor metabolite (LP-951757)  
In vivo  
In mice, rats and dogs telotristat etiprate/ethyl reduced blood and GI 5-HT from the lowest dose in a dose 
dependent fashion after single or multiple treatments throughout studies.

Rodent pharmacology summary report P103-002 
 5 rats per group were dosed orally with vehicle (15% Captisol) or telotristat 
ethyl. Doses in this study were 10, 30, 150, or 400 mg/kg/day. Following the last dose, animals were 
sacrificed; 5-HT levels were measured in jejunum, ileum, proximal colon, distal colon, blood, and brain. 
Brain levels of 5-HIAA were also determined.  
Telotristat ethyl caused a significant, dose-dependent reduction of 5-HT in both the small and large 
intestine. Approximately 70 to 80% depletion was achieved throughout the intestine at the highest dose. 
A statistically significant reduction in blood 5-HT levels was noted at doses ≥ 150 mg/kg/day. In contrast, 
no significant change in either 5-HT or 5-HIAA was observed in the brain at dose levels up to 400 mg/kg 
in this study.

higher concentrations in these species. 
In monkeys telotristat etiprate also reduced blood 5-HT levels; this effect however was much weaker 
when compared to other animal species.  
Monkeys 
Collection of Samples for Determination of the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics of LP-778914 
Following Once-Daily Oral Doses for 7 Days and a Single Intravenous Dose to Monkeys , (Covance Report 
7648-187).  
Fourteen cynomolgus monkeys (10 males, 4 females) were divided into 2 groups (5 males, 2 females in 
each group). One group received telotristat ethyl at 75 mg/kg (0.25 MC), once daily for 7 days by oral 
gavage. The other group received vehicle only.  
5-Hydroxytryptamine concentration in blood declined steadily in both the vehicle- and telotristat 
ethyl-dosed groups. The reason for the reduction in blood 5-HT in vehicle-dosed animals is unclear. 
Nevertheless, animals dosed with telotristat ethyl showed a greater decline in blood 5-HT concentrations 
compared to those dosed with vehicle. This effect emerged beginning on Day 3 and became statistically 
significant on Days 5-7. In the urine, the ratio of 5-HIAA over creatinine was similar between the groups

until Day 6, when telotristat ethyl -dosed animals started to show a lower ratio. The difference at Day 7 
between the groups did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1, t test).  
Figure 3: Effect of telotristat ethyl on blood 5-HT and urinary 5-HIAA in monkeys 
The effect of telotristat etiprate or telotristat ethyl on GI motility was assessed in mice and rats. In mice, 
neither telotristat etiprate nor LP-778902 had any effect on percent charcoal transit. The effect of 
telotristat etiprate on GI motility was evaluated in the rat using the charcoal 
meal test (P103-002).  
Three groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 6/group) were used in this study. One group of rats was 
dosed with telotristat etiprate at 250 mg/kg, once daily for 13 consecutive days while the other 2 groups 
were dosed once daily for 14 days with vehicle (0.25% methylcellulose). Rats in positive control group 
received vehicle for 13 days followed by atropine (150 mg/kg) on Day 14.  
Telotristat etiprate dosed animals showed a significant decrease in GI transit and an increase in gastric 
weight  (indicating  a  decrease  in  gastric  emptying)  when  compared  to  vehicle-dosed  animals. 
5-Hydroxytryptamine levels in blood and colon were reduced by 73% and 81%, respectively. Atropine, 
delayed gastric emptying and GI transit but did not alter GI and blood 5-HT levels.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro secondary pharmacodynamic studies focused on receptor/enzyme interaction potential and 
cytotoxicity of telotristat ethyl and LP-778902. In vivo studies were conducted to determine if telotristat 
possesses any anti-tumour activity and  if it is effective in chemically-induced colitis models. 
Telotristat ethyl and LP-778902 were tested for their interaction potential with 75 relevant human 
receptors, enzymes and ion channels. Telotristat ethyl showed a more than 50% inhibition at 16 of the 75 
receptors indicating a high in vitro interaction potential. In contrast LP-778902 only showed a weak 
interaction potential with these receptors, however, a > 50% inhibition was observed at 10 µM at the A3, 
5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptors. Telotristat ethyl is rapidly converted to LP-778902 and thus only appears at 
low concentrations in the circulation. In addition telotristat ethyl is highly protein bound in plasma. At the 
maximum human dose tested of 500 mg tid. LP-778902 only reaches Cmax levels in the nanomolar range.  
No anti-tumour activities of telotristat etiprate were observed in a Hep3B human hepatocellular xenograft 
mouse model and a model of patient derived tumour material which was implanted subcutaneously into 
FOXN1 nude mice.   
In study LX1606-N41, mice treated with telotristat etiprate showed significantly less weight loss 
compared to vehicle treated, however weight loss was not modified by the other compounds including 
LP-778902.  
In study LX1606-N32, only telotristat etiprate had significant effects in a model of chemically induced 
colitis, while its active metabolite LP-778902 was less effective.

Studies on pharmacodynamic drug interactions were not submitted (see non-clinical discussion). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A range of in vitro and in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies have 
been performed in various species on telotristat ethyl and its active metabolite, LP-778902. 
Absorption 
The in vitro permeability of telotristat ethyl in Caco-2 cells suggests that both, telotristat ethyl and 
LP-778902 have low intestinal absorption. 
The oral bioavailability of LP-778902 in the mouse at 50 mg/kg was approximately 12%. 
The PK of telotristat ethyl and LP-778902 have been studied in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys. 
Telotristat ethyl exhibited generally low systemic exposure following oral administration in all species 
tested. 
In the dog, exposure to both telotristat ethyl and LP-778902 increased in the presence of food. In fasted 
dogs emetic effects were observed which is likely to contribute to the notable lower Cmax and AUC0-t 
values in these animals compared to that observed in dogs given the same dose of compound in the fed 
state.  
Following 6 daily doses of telotristat ethyl in the monkey, the plasma pharmacokinetic of LP-778902 was 
similar compared to single administration. No significant accumulation of LP-778902 in the plasma was 
evident upon multiple dosing. 
A summary of the data is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Plasma pharmacokinetics of LP-778902 after 1 mg/kg bolus intravenous injection of 
LP-778902 to rodents, telotristat etiprate to dogs and telotristat ethyl to monkeys 
Distribution 
In tissue distribution studies in Sprague-Dawley and Lister Hooded (partially-pigmented) rats exposure 
was limited to the contents of the GI tract, hepatic, and renal systems, with no measurable activity in the 
brain. In the Lister Hooded rat, there was no significant exposure to melanin-containing pigmented areas 
of the eye and skin.  
No data on tissue distribution after repeated administration of telotristat ethyl has been submitted.  
Both telotristat ethyl and LP-778902 exhibited very high plasma protein binding (> 96%) in all species 
tested, including human. 
Metabolism 
Telotristat ethyl is hydrolysed by carboxylesterase 1 and 2 to the corresponding acid, LP-778902. In 
human the conversion of telotristat ethyl to LP-778902 took place primarily in the intestine and liver and 
in rodents telotristat ethyl is also converted in plasma.

Figure 6: Proposed Metabolic Pathway of Telotristat Ethyl 
In vivo metabolism studies in rats showed that exposure was markedly higher for LP-778902 when 
compared to LP-951757. For LP-951757, the Tmax was noticeably longer than that of LP-778902. In male 
and female Sprague-Dawley rats, following a once daily oral administration of telotristat etiprate for 7 
days at 20, 60, and 170 mg/kg, exposure of telotristat ethyl, LP-778902 and LP-951757 was generally 
higher in females when compared to males, and no accumulation was observed on repeated dosing. 
Excretion 
In the rat, following oral administration of 14C-telotristat ethyl, radioactivity was almost exclusively 
eliminated in the faeces (≥ 86% of the administered dose) and less than 0.2% was excreted via the urine.

Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Table 7: Cytochrome P450 Inhibition by Telotristat Ethyl and LP-778902 at 1 μM 
Concentration 
Telotristat ethyl and its active metabolite (LP-778902) were not shown to be inducers of CYP3A4 at 
systematically-relevant concentrations, based on in vitro findings. The potential of telotristat ethyl as an 
inducer of CYP3A4 was not assessed at concentrations expectable at the intestinal level, due to its low 
solubility in vitro. 
In vitro, telotristat ethyl inhibited CYP3A4, suggesting a potential interaction with CYP3A4 substrates. 
For CYP1A2, there was high inter-donor variability, and it was concluded that there was little to no 
induction of CYP1A2 mRNA expression (<2-fold following treatment with telotristat ethyl and LP-778902).  
In vitro telotristat (active metabolite) caused a concentration dependent increase in CYP 2B6 mRNA levels 
(>2-fold increase and >20% of the positive control, with a maximum observed effect similar to the 
positive control), suggesting possible CYP 2B6 induction. 
The Applicant has conducted in vitro studies to assess the interaction of telotristat ethyl, its active 
metabolite LP-778902 and metabolite LP-951757 with the efflux transporters (P-gp, BCRP, MRP2 and 
BSEP), as well as the SLC transporters (OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3).  In vitro 
telotristat ethyl inhibited P-gp, but its active metabolite did not at the clinically relevant concentrations. 
Telotristat ethyl inhibited MRP2-mediated transport (98% inhibition). Telotristat ethyl inhibited BCRP 
(IC50 = 20 µm), but its active metabolite telotristat did not show any significant inhibition of BCRP activity 
(IC50 > 30 µM). The potential for in vivo drug interaction via BCRP is considered low. Based on in vitro 
findings, no clinically-relevant interaction is expected with other transporters. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology

Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of telotristat etiprate was studied in Tg.rasH2 mice. Treatment of hemizygous 
Tg.rasH2 mice with telotristat etiprate at daily oral doses up to 300 mg/kg/day for 26 consecutive weeks 
did not increase the incidence of neoplastic lesions (LX1606-N52).  
A two-year rat carcinogenicity study is ongoing (see SmPC, section 5.3).

Toxicokinetic data 
In the initial MAA dossier safety margins for the active metabolite LP-778902  were calculated, and were 
based on the human steady state exposure (AUC0-24 of approximately 4238 ng*hr/mL) at the highest 
dose studied in Phase 3  of 500 mg tid from the LX1606.1-102-NRM study. 
Similarly safety margins for telotristat ethyl were calculated based on human steady state exposure 
(AUC0-24 of approximately 21 ng*hr/mL) at the highest dose studied in LX1606.1-102-NRM study. An 
overview of the clinical safety margins for telotristat ethyl and the active metabolite LP-778902 is given 
in Table 16 and Table 17. 
An overview of the toxicokinetic of telotristat ethyl and the active metabolite LP-778902 is shown in Table

Other toxicity studies 
A rat excretion balance and tissue distribution study was conducted with 14C-LX1606 in Lister Hooded 
(pigmented) rat. Results from this study showed that the majority of radiolabeled material remained in 
the gastrointestinal tract and was rapidly eliminated. Based on these findings and according to ICH S10 
no further photosafety testing was performed with telotristat etiprate. 
In the chronic toxicity study in the dog (LX1606-N27), no evidence of immunosuppression or 
myelosuppresion was observed

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
OPEN 
The pharmacodynamic activity of telotristat etiprate/ethyl and LP-778902 on TPH has been evaluated in 
rat and human in vitro models and in several in vivo models of mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. The 
inhibitory action of telotristat has been demonstrated in the colon of the animals tested and in the 
decrease of 5-HT in the blood and 5-HIAA in the urine.  Based on non-clinical data package, TPH inhibition 
is considered highly species specific. However, it is apparent from animal studies that 5-HT and 5-HIAA 
reduction in brain occurs at exposures sufficiently above to the proposed clinical dose of 250 mg TID. 
Animal data in rats and dogs regarding brain 5-HT and 5-HIAA reduction were included in section 5.3 of 
the SmPC and depression and depression related events in the RMP.  
In the rat, increased systemic exposure to LP-778902 was observed with escalating doses of telotristat 
ethyl, with saturation observed at high dose levels. Saturation was also observed for telotristat ethyl at 
high dose levels. The saturation at high dose levels was probably due to a limitation in the absorption 
process but occurs at dose levels which are not clinically relevant. In the dog, exposure to both telotristat 
ethyl and LP-778902 increased in the presence of food. In fasted dogs emetic effects were observed which 
Assessment report  
EMA/508026/2017  
Page 42/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
contributed to the notable lower C max and AUC0-t values in these animals compared to that observed in 
dogs given the same dose of compound in the fed state. In human an increase in Cmax and AUC was also 
observed when telotristat etiprate is given together with high fat meal but not with a standard meal. This 
is consistent to the PK data in human and as such Xermelo should be taken with food (see sections 4.2, 
5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Tissue distribution studies have only been performed after single administration to Sprague Dawley rats 
and lister hooded rats (partially pigmented). No tissue distribution after repeated administration of 
telotristat ethyl has been performed, which is acceptable. 
No pharmacokinetic study for brain penetration was conducted. This is acceptable as pharmacology 
studies have shown statistically significant decrease in brain 5-HT levels in SD rats dosed with ≥ 1000 
mg/kg/day and beagle dogs at 500 mg/kg/day dose. There was also a statistically significant decrease in 
5-HIAA levels in the brain in the 30 and 100 mg/kg/day dose groups in dogs. 
Brain distribution was not observed after highest dose tested 100 mg/kg/day (free base) in both tissue 
distribution studies in rats, but this dose did not reach sufficient exposure to prodrug - indicated to be 
responsible for 5-HT reduction in brain. However, considering the difference in PK profile and sensitivity 
to TPH inhibition (based on in vitro cell based assay data) between rat and human, new data would not be 
of value. From non-clinical point of view, inclusion of animal data regarding brain 5-HT, 5-HIAA reduction 
in section 5.3 are sufficient. 
The in vitro and in vivo metabolism shows that telotristat is converted trough hydrolysis of esterases to 
the active metabolite LP-778902. Whereas in rodents conversion occurred already in plasma, in humans 
conversion occurred primarily in intestine and liver. A further oxidative, decarboxylated, deaminated 
metabolite LP-951757 (inactive) was found in rats and human. 
The metabolites of telotristat ethyl have been poorly characterized in in vitro models and in vivo in 
animals. However, it can be assumed that the human metabolites are also present in in vitro models and 
in vivo in animals and that no metabolites unique to human exist. Therefore, no further studies are 
requested.  
Telotristat ethyl and LP-778902 were investigated for their pharmacokinetic drug interaction potential in 
in vitro studies on a range of drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters. The in vitro studies show 
that there is interaction of telotristat ethyl, its active metabolite LP-778902 and/or minor metabolite 
LP-951757 with the efflux transporters (P-gp, BCRP, MRP2) Based on in vitro findings, no clinically 
relevant interactions is expected with other transporters. These studies have been performed according 
to the EMA guideline CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2 (see clinical pharmacology). 
In terms to toxicity observed in the rat studies, in a 26-week repeat-dose toxicity study in rats a 
No-Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 50 mg/kg/day was determined. This is approximately 0.4 
times the human exposure (AUC total) at MRHD of 750 mg/day for the active metabolite LP-778902. At 
doses of 200 and 500 mg/kg/day degeneration/necrosis in the nonglandular and/or glandular portions of 
the stomach and/or increased protein droplets in the glandular portions were observed. The microscopic 
changes in the gastrointestinal tract reversed with a 4-week recovery period. Relevance of these 
gastrointestinal findings to humans is unknown. In a 39-week repeat-dose toxicity study in dogs NOAEL 
of 300 mg/kg/day was determined. Clinical signs were limited to increase in frequency of liquid faeces at 
all doses. This is approximately 20 times the human exposure (AUC total) at MRHD of 750 mg/day for the 
active metabolite LP-778902. 
Assessment report  
EMA/508026/2017  
Page 43/148 
 
 
 
 
 
Telotristat etiprate and LP-778902 are not considered to be genotoxic in vitro and in vivo. As telotristat 
etiprate is rapidly metabolized in vivo to LP-778902 no further in vivo genotoxic testing of LP-778902 was 
performed what is acceptable. 
A 2 year rat carcinogenicity study with dose levels up to 170 mg/kg/day is on-going. The CHMP agreed 
that carcinogenicity studies could be submitted in post-authorisation. The absence of the long-term 
carcinogenicity study is properly reflected in the SmPC section 5.3.  
Prenatal development in rats and rabbits was affected by increased prenatal lethality (increased early and 
late resorptions). Therefore, information on embryonic lethality has been included in 5.3 and further 
recommendations have been included in section 4.6 of the SmPC where animal studies have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see SmPC section 5.3). Xermelo is not recommended during pregnancy and in 
women of childbearing potential not using contraception. There are no data from the use of telotristat in 
pregnant women. No studies on the effect of telotristat on human fertility have been conducted. 
Telotristat had no effect on fertility in animal studies (see SmPC section 5.3). It is unknown whether 
telotristat ethyl and its metabolite are excreted in human breast milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot 
be excluded. Patients should not breast-feed during telotristat treatment. 
The spectroscopic scans (200-700 nm) for telotristat ethyl and its active metabolite LP- 778902 show that 
both compounds absorb light in the UVB spectrum at 306 nm. The molar extinction coefficient (ε) for 
telotristat ethyl is 9573.8 L mol-1 cm-1 at 306 nm. For LP- 778902, corresponding value for ε is 8081 L 
mol-1 cm-1 (documentation in appendix). In a rat excretion balance and tissue distribution study in Lister 
Hooded (pigmented) rats it was demonstrated that the majority of radiolabeled material remained in the 
gastrointestinal tract and was rapidly eliminated. Furthermore, no persistent dermal or ocular distribution 
above that of plasma levels was observed. In addition, in clinical study 301 in CS patients treated at 500 
mg tid no accumulation of plasma concentration of LP-778902 and no skin safety finding were observed 
up to 48 weeks of treatment. Based on these findings no further photosafety testing was performed with 
telotristat etiprate. 
It is not possible to conclude on the environmental risk of telotristat (active metabolite LP 778902). The 
applicant provided an ERA Phase I which is acceptable. Calculation of PEC SURFACEWATER is based on the 
recommended daily dose of telotristat etiprate of 750 mg/day (3 x 250 mg) and a refined market 
penetration factor (Fpen) of 0.036%. The PECSURFACEWATER was determined to be 0.136 μg/L. This value is 
above the action limit of 0.01 μg/L defined by EMA Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of 
medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr.2) as the threshold above which a 
phase II environmental fate and effects analysis must be performed. The provided experimental values 
for logK OW including the study reports are acceptable. A PBT assessment is not required. So far, no phase 
II assessment is available. The missing ERA studies and an overall ERA revision shall be provided in 
post-authorisation.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological characteristics of telotristat have been well 
characterised in the non-clinical aspects. In general, the non-clinical aspects are considered to be 
appropriately addressed. However, the applicant should submit the results of the 2 year carcinogenicity 
study and the missing ERA studies as post-authorisation measures.  
Therefore, the CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the non-clinical issues:

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
At the time of MAA submission, telotristat etiprate had been studied in approximately 259 healthy 
volunteers as single/multiple doses in Phase 1 studies. In addition, 38 patients with CS and 48 patients 
with ulcerative colitis have received telotristat etiprate during Phase 2 of the clinical development 
programme. In the three Phase 3 studies, a total of 185 patients had completed the DBT Periods of 
Studies LX301 and LX302, a total of 71 patients were continuing to participate in the OLE Periods of LX301 
and LX303, and a total of 60 patients were continuing to participate in Study LX302. 
An additional phase I study (D-FR-01017-001) was conducted in patients with mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment and healthy controls (n=8 in each of the three groups).

e = The p-value was calculated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for tmax. 
For telotristat ethyl, the between subject variability, as assessed from the geometric CV for AUC0-last and 
AUC0-inf of telotristat ethyl, was generally similar in the fed (43% and 36%, respectively) and fasted (37% 
and 36%, respectively) states; however, the geometric CV for Cmax was higher in the fed state (69%) 
compared to the fasted state (38%).  
Distribution 
Following administration of [14C]-telotristat etiprate to healthy volunteers in the mass balance study 
(LX104), the total radioactivity in whole blood ranged from 278 – 1427 ng equivalents/mL.  
Telotristat ethyl exhibited high plasma protein binding (99.8%, mean of n=2) in human as determined by 
equilibrium dialysis (160618).  
The estimated apparent total volume of distribution for the active metabolite from the Population PK 
model of 428.1 L in a typical healthy fasted subject and 348.7 L in patients with CS.  
Elimination 
Results from the mass balance study LX104 showed that following administration of a single dose of 500 
mg (as free base) [14C]-telotristat etiprate, plasma concentrations of total radioactivity reached a 
maximum between 2.00 and 4.00 h postdose. Thereafter, total radioactivity declined in a biphasic 
manner up to 24 h postdose. Half-lives of telotristat ethyl were estimated for only 2 of the 8 subjects and 
a true terminal half-life could not be reliably determined as telotristat ethyl plasma concentrations 
dropped BLQ after only 4 h. For LP-778902, half-lives were estimated for 7 out of 8 subjects with values 
ranging from 4.71 to 5.62 h (geometric mean of 5.022 h) and plasma concentrations falling BLQ after 24 
h postdose.  
The apparent oral clearance at steady state in healthy subjects (500mg tid) was estimated to be 2.67 L/hr 
for telotristat ethyl and 152 L/hr for LP-778902 (LX102). 
Recovery of total radioactivity from all excreta (urine and faeces) was to be monitored. Reported values 
of cumulative excretion showed that a mean of 93.157% (range of 90.39% to 95.38%) of administered 
total radioactivity was recovered in urine and faeces from subjects following continuous sampling up to 
240 h postdose. A mean of 92.775% was recovered from the faeces, with approximately 0.382% 
recovered from the urine. 
The in vitro metabolism of telotristat ethyl was further studied in human male and female hepatocytes 
using [14C]-telotristat ethyl. Telotristat ethyl was rapidly metabolised to its major metabolite, LP-778902, 
by both male and female human hepatocytes, which was further metabolised to LP-951757. The 
formation of LP-951757 was slower and less extensive when compared to LP-778902. No significant sex 
differences were observed in the nature and quantity of metabolites formed in this study (XenoTech 
XT154054).

The oxidative decarboxylated deaminated metabolite, LP-951757, represented consistency >10% of total 
plasma drug-related material. Systemic exposure to LP-951757 was about 35% of the systemic exposure 
to telotristat (active metabolite) in the mass balance study. LP-951757 was pharmacologically inactive at 
TPH1 in vitro. 
The proposed metabolic pathway of telotristat ethyl is depicted in Figure 8. 
Figure 8: Proposed Metabolic Pathway of Telotristat Ethyl 
Following oral administration of [14C]-telotristat etiprate to 8 male subjects, at least 15 radioactive 
components were observed in faeces (designated F1 to F15). Two major radioactive components were 
observed (corresponding to >10% of the dose administered in at least 1 subject). Both components were 
shown to contain several metabolites including LP-778902 and metabolites of LP-778902. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Study LX102: Dose proportionality was investigated under single and multiple dose administration for the 
capsule formulation of telotristat etiprate in study LX102, a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, ascending multiple-dose study to evaluate i.a. the PK of LX1606 and LP-778902 over 
a range of multiple oral doses in healthy subjects. Each cohort received 1 dose level for 14 days. Dose 
levels were 100 mg once daily (QD), 250 mg QD, 500 mg QD, 500 mg twice daily (BID), and 500 mg 3 
times daily (TID) of LX1606 capsules or placebo. Standard morning meals or a snack were provided 
before dosing and then approximately 4 hours after study treatment administration. Forty subjects 
enrolled in the study and 38 completed it. 
The PK parameters for both LX1606 for Cohorts 1 through 3 are summarized in Table 23.

Healthy subjects: In healthy subjects (study LX102), there was no apparent accumulation of LP-778902 
after multiple doses of once-daily 100 mg through 500 mg 3 times daily telotristat etiprate based on the 
Day 14 AUC0-tau/Day 1 AUC0-tau ratio (Ro) being close to 1 (<1.2).  
The mean t1/2 of LP-778902 after multiple doses of telotristat etiprate ranged from 3.65 to 11.7 hours 
between dose groups with similar mean apparent clearance at steady-state values for all dose groups. 
Patients with CS: A posthoc noncompartmental PK evaluation (1606-301-nca-pk-011084) of single- and 
multiple-dose oral administration of telotristat etiprate (LX1606 hippurate) in patients with CS not 
adequately controlled by somatostatin analog therapy (study LX301) was conducted.

Impaired renal function 
In the overall population analysed, the range of renal function was mostly normal (>= 90 mL/min, 
60.5%) followed by mild renal impairment (60-89 mL/min, 24.1%), moderate renal impairment (30-59 
mL/min, 8.2%) and severe renal impairment (15-29 mL/min, 2.6%). The majority of subjects in the 
Phase 1 studies had normal renal function. In LX301, 34 (31.8%) patients were normal, 43 (40.2%) were 
mild, 16 (15.0%) were moderate, and 5 (4.7%) had severe renal impairment.

Renal function (as assessed by creatinine clearance) was not identified as a significant covariate on the PK 
of LP-778902 in the PopPK analysis (002479); patients with normal, mild, and moderate renal 
impairment had comparable exposures.

In a hepatic impairment study (D-FR-01017-001) conducted at a single dose of 500 mg, exposures to the 
parent compound (telotristat ethyl) and its active metabolite, LP-7789012, (based on AUC0-tlast) were 
higher in patients with mild hepatic impairment (2.3- and 2.4-fold, respectively) and in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment (3.2- and 3.5-fold, respectively) compared with healthy subjects. 
Administration of a single dose of 500 mg was well tolerated. The use of telotristat is not recommended 
in patients with severe hepatic impairment as no data are available.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
SSA treatment: Coadministration of telotristat etiprate and immediate-release octreotide acetate was 
previously shown to reduce systemic exposure and delay Tmax of telotristat ethyl and LP-778902 in 
healthy subjects (LX109). It was not possible to evaluate SSA treatment as a covariate in the population 
PK analysis due to confounding with health status. Indeed, all healthy subjects from the 3 Phase 1 studies 
did not have SSA treatment and all patients from Study LX301 had SSA treatment. At study entry, 26 
patients had received Lanreotide long acting and 81 patients had received Octreotide long acting 
formulation.  
Based on the post-hoc individual PK parameters from the pop PK model, exposure (AUC 0-24 h and Cmax) 
was comparable whatever the concomitant SSA treatment Figure 10.

Induction of CYPs: 
In vitro telotristat (active metabolite) caused a concentration dependent increase in CYP2B6 mRNA levels 
(>2-fold increase and >20% of the positive control, with a maximum observed effect similar to the 
positive control), suggesting possible CYP2B6 induction. Concomitant use of Xermelo may decrease the 
efficacy of medicinal products that are CYP2B6 substrates (e.g. valproic acid, bupropion, sertraline) by 
decreasing their systemic exposure. Monitoring for suboptimal efficacy is recommended in the SmPC. 
Telotristat ethyl and its active metabolite were not shown to be inducers of CYP3A4 at systematically 
relevant concentrations, based on in vitro findings. The potential of telotristat ethyl as an inducer of 
CYP3A4 was not assessed at concentrations expectable at the intestinal level, due to its low solubility in 
vitro. 
Based on in vitro findings, no clinically-relevant induction is expected with other cytochromes P450. 
In vitro, telotristat ethyl inhibited CYP3A4 suggesting a potential interaction with CYP3A4 substrates. A 
clinical DDI study was conducted with midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate) to clarify this interaction (see 
LX108 below). 
Based on in vitro findings, no clinically-relevant inhibition is expected with other cytochromes P450. 
Transporters  
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Multi-drug Resistance associated Protein 2 (MRP-2) 
In vitro telotristat ethyl inhibited P-gp, but its active metabolite did not at the clinically relevant 
concentrations. 
Telotristat ethyl inhibited MRP2-mediated transport (98% inhibition).  
Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) 
In vitro telotristat ethyl inhibited BCRP (IC 50 = 20 µM), but its active metabolite telotristat did not show 
any significant inhibition of BCRP activity (IC50 > 30 µM). The potential for in vivo drug interaction via 
inhibition of BCRP is considered low. 
Other transporters 
Based on in vitro findings, no clinically-relevant interaction is expected with other transporters.  
Carboxylesterases (CES) inhibitors 
In vitro loperamide (CES2 inhibitor) had a moderate effect on the metabolism of telotristat ethyl, reducing 
the formation of telotristat by <30%. In vitro, telotristat ethyl inhibited CES2 with an IC50 approximately 
of 6.4 μM. In phase 3 clinical trials, telotristat was routinely combined with loperamide with no evidence 
of safety concerns. 
LX108: in vivo DDI study with Cyp3A4 substrate midazolam 
This phase 1 study was an open-label, 2-period, single-sequence, drug-drug interaction study to assess 
the effects of steady-state telotristat ethyl, resulting from dosing with 2 x 250-mg (as free base) 
telotristat etiprate tablets tid for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics of single-dose midazolam (1 x 3 mg [1.5 
mL oral syrup (2 mg/mL)]), a sensitive cytochrome P450-3A4 substrate, in healthy male and female 
subjects. A total of 24 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study and all subjects completed the study. 
Following the first administered Midazolam single dose on Day 1 in a fasted state, all subjects were to 
complete a washout period of 3 nondosing days (Days 2 to 4). On Day 5, subjects were to begin a 5-day 
Assessment report

telotristat etiprate regimen (2 x 250-mg [as free base] tablets tid) administered within 1 hour following a 
standard (non high-fat) meal, except on Day 9 (final dosing day of telotristat etiprate tid), the morning 
telotristat etiprate dose was to be administered to subjects in the fasted state concomitantly with a single 
dose of midazolam. The 2 final doses of telotristat etiprate were to be administered again with food on 
Day 9 throughout the PK sampling collection. Blood samples were collected up to 48 h following 
administration. 
The arithmetic mean plasma concentration profiles for Midazolam are presented in Figure 11.

Table 28: Summary of Arithmetic Mean Pk Parameters from Phase 1 Study LX108   
Following administration of multiple doses of telotristat ethyl, the systemic exposure to concomitant 
midazolam was significantly decreased. When 3 mg midazolam was coadministered orally after 5-day 
treatment with telotristat ethyl 500 mg tid (twice the recommended dose), the mean Cmax, and AUC0-inf 
for midazolam were decreased by 25%, and 48%, respectively, compared with administration of 
midazolam alone. The mean Cmax, and AUC0-inf for the active metabolite, 1’-hydroxymidazolam, were 
also decreased by 34%, and 48%, respectively. Concomitant use of Xermelo may decrease the efficacy of 
medicinal products that are CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. midazolam, everolimus, sunitinib, simvastatin, 
ethinyloestradiol, amlodipine, cyclosporine…) by decreasing their systemic exposure (see section 5.2). 
Monitoring for suboptimal efficacy is recommended. 
LX106: in vivo DDI study with P-gp / MRP2 substrate fexofenadine: 
This phase 1 study was an open-label, 2-period, single-sequence DDI study to evaluate the effects of 
steady-state telotristat ethyl, resulting from dosing with 2 x 250 mg telotristat etiprate tablets tid x 5 
days, on the PK of single-dose fexofenadine (1 x 180 mg tablet), a sensitive P-gp and MRP2 substrate, in 
healthy subjects. A total of 24 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study of which 23 completed the 
study. 
The mean plasma concentration profiles of fexofenadine following administration of fexofenadine alone 
and following coadministration with telotristat etiprate is represented in and PK parameters are

The Cmax and AUC of fexofenadine (a P-gp and MRP-2 substrate) increased by 16% when a single 180 mg 
dose of fexofenadine was co-administered orally with a dose of telotristat ethyl 500 mg administered tid 
(twice the recommended dose) for 5 days. Based on the small increase observed, clinically meaningful 
interactions with P-gp and MRP-2 substrates are unlikely. 
LX109: DDI study with IR octreotide acetate injection (200µg tid). 
This was an open-label, 2-period, single-sequence DDI study in healthy male and female subjects to 
evaluate the effect of octreotide acetate injections (immediate release, administered 200 μg tid) on the 
PK of telotristat ethyl and its metabolite LP-778902 relative to administration of single-dose telotristat 
etiprate (administered as 2 x 250 mg tablets) alone in healthy subjects. A total of 24 healthy subjects 
were enrolled in the study and all subjects completed the study. 
For all time points when telotristat etiprate was coadministered with octreotide acetate, ≥50% of 
telotristat ethyl plasma concentration values were BLQ; therefore, arithmetic mean plasma 
concentrations were not calculated and are not displayed and the terminal elimination phase could not be 
adequately characterised. 
The mean plasma concentration profiles of LP-778902 following administration of telotristat etiprate 
alone and following coadministration with octreotide acetate are represented in Figure 13 and the PK 
parameters are summarized in Table 30.

Table 30: Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters from LX109  
Study data showed an 83% and 81% decrease in Cmax and AUC of telotristat ethyl and telotristat, 
respectively. Reduced exposures were not observed in a 12◦week double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
randomised, multicentre clinical trial in adult patients with carcinoid syndrome on long-acting SSA 
therapy.  
Consequently, short-acting octreotide should be administered at least 30 minutes after administration of 
Xermelo if treatment with short-acting octreotide is needed in combination with Xermelo. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Following incubation of 14C-telotristat ethyl with human male and female hepatocytes, LP-778902 was 
formed by both male and female human hepatocytes, which was further metabolized to LP-951757. The 
formation of LP-951757 was slower and less extensive when compared to LP-778902. No significant 
gender differences were observed in the nature and quantity of metabolites formed.  
Addiitional in vitro studies were submitted to investigate the potential of telotristat ethyl and LP-778902 
to induce CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4/5 expression in cultured human hepatocytes from three different donors 
and to evaluate the potential of telotristat ethyl and LP-778902 to inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6, 2E1 and 3A4/5 in human liver microsomes. The range of telotristat ethyl and LP-778902 
concentrations tested was from 0.003 to 10 μM and from 0.03 to 10 μM, respectively, which covers the 
maximum human plasma concentration. These studies have been performed according to the EMA 
guideline CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2. The results showed that telotristat ethyl and LP-778902 
were not inducers of CYP1A2, but showed concentration-dependent down-regulation of this enzyme. (see 
non-clinical section).

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The applicant did not submit clinical studies on the mechanism of action of telotristat etiprate (see clinical 
discussion). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Serotonin (5-HT) levels 
In the study LX1606.1-102-NRM a statistically significant (P<0.05) decrease in 5-HT blood levels 
compared to placebo was observed following treatment with the 500 mg doses (BID, TID, and QD) 
starting on Days 7, 9, and 10, respectively. A statistically significant decrease in 5-HT blood levels 
compared to placebo was observed with all of the 500 mg doses on Day 14. The decrease in 5-HT levels 
for the 500 mg dose groups was maintained through the 48-hour post-Day 14 dose sample for the 500 mg 
QD and TID dose groups and 24 hours post-Day 14 dose for the 500 mg BID dose group. 
In the study LX1606.1-202-CS the 5-HT levels had high variability over a range of multiple oral doses. In 
the core phase whole blood 5-HT levels tended to increase with placebo and telotristat etiprate 150 mg 
tid, while 5-HT levels remained close to baseline for telotristat etiprate 250 mg tid, 350 mg tid, and 500 
mg tid. In the extension phase levels of 5-HT varied throughout the treatment period but tended to 
remain near baseline values with no clear trend over time. The mean baseline whole blood 5-HT level was 
850.3778 ng/mL (n=19); it varied throughout the extension with minimal mean changes from baseline 
ranging from -298.7 to +432.0 ng/mL. The lowest mean whole blood 5-HT level was 523.1 ng/mL (week 
8; n=17) with an average telotristat etiprate dose of 1088.8 mg/d and the highest mean whole blood 
5-HT level was 1259.0 ng/mL (week 147/148; n=2) with an average dose of telotristat etiprate of 1390.5 
mg/d. 
In the study LX1606.1-203-CS the mean whole blood 5-HT concentration remained below Baseline during 
the Core Phase and Extension Period over a range of multiple oral doses (however the mean change from 
Baseline and percent change from Baseline in whole blood 5-HT was not statistically significant at any 
time point during the Core Phase). 
5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels 
In the study LX102, all decreases (from Day 1 measurement) in urinary 5-HIAA excretion were 
statistically significantly different (most P values were <0.01) in terms of greater reductions for all 
cohorts on Days 5, 10, 13, and 14, with the exception of Cohort 1 at Day 13 (no data were collected) and 
Day 14. 
In the study LX202, mean u5-HIAA values were generally lower in treatment groups versus placebo in the 
Core Phase. In the core phase mean 5-HIAA values in urine were generally lower in the telotristat etiprate 
treatment groups versus placebo. Minimal mean changes from baseline ranging from -74.16 to 
+0.03 mg/24 h were seen in the telotristat etiprate 150 mg tid, 250 mg tid, and 500 mg tid groups. In the 
extension phase mean decreases from baseline for u5-HIAA ranged from -1.6 to -86.0 mg/24 h at all 
time-points with data available. 
In the study LX203, for Core Phase, mean u5-HIAA levels decreased from Baseline from Week 2 through 
Week 12, and the change from Baseline (reduction) in u5-HIAA was statistically significant at Week 6 by 
signed-rank test (p = 0.012) and at Week 8 and Week 12 by both tests (p = 0.015 and p = 0.032 at Week 
Assessment report  
EMA/508026/2017  
Page 62/148 
 
 
 
 
 
8 and p = 0.008 and p = 0.016 at Week 12 by paired t-test and signed-rank test, respectively). For the 
extension period, mean u5-HIAA values remained below Baseline throughout the Extension Period with 
the exception of Week 60. 
In the study LX301, reductions in u5-HIAA values from baseline were statistically significant at week 12 
for telotristat etiprate 250 mg and 500 mg tid compared to placebo in the ITT population. The estimate of 
the treatment difference versus placebo (Hodges-Lehmann) was ˗30.100 mg/24 h (97.5% CI: ˗56.000, 
˗8.100) for telotristat etiprate 250 mg (p<0.001) and -33.800 (97.5% CI: ˗66.200, ˗14.600) for the 
telotristat etiprate 500 mg (p<0.001); p-values were obtained from a blocked WRS Wilcoxon rank sum 
test (van Elteren test). In the ITT population the mean change from baseline in 5-HIAA plasma levels 
averaged across all time points during the double-blind treatment period was ˗59.1 ng/mL (n=44) for 
telotristat etiprate 250 mg tid, -133.9 ng/mL (n=41) for 500 mg tid, and 58.8 ng/mL (n=40) for placebo. 
The treatment difference versus placebo demonstrated statistical significance for both telotristat etiprate 
groups [250 mg tid ˗63.5 ng/mL (95% CI: ˗116.4, ˗35.4; p<0.001), 500 mg tid ˗92.1 ng/mL (95% CI: 
˗128.6, ˗56.6; p<0.001), Wilcoxon rank sum test). In the open-label extension period samples were 
analysed for urinary 5-HIAA levels (mg/24 h) at weeks 18, 24, and 48. Reductions in u5-HIAA were 
observed at all assessed time-points in the ITT population. 
In the study LX302, plasma 5-HIAA levels were stable over the first 24 weeks of the study (baseline: 
mean 187.6 ng/mL, median 37.2 ng/mL; week 12: mean 181.4 ng/mL, median 32.0 ng/mL; week 24: 
mean 146.3 ng/mL, median 38.3 ng/mL) in the PP Population. 
In the study LX303, there was a statistically significant greater percent reduction in the urine of u5-HIAA 
levels for both telotristat etiprate 250 mg and 500 mg tid compared to placebo (p<0.001 each). Estimates 
(Hodges-Lehmann) of treatment differences versus placebo were -54.0% (95% CI: -85.0, -25.1) for 
telotristat etiprate 250 mg tid and -89.7% (95% CI: -113.1, -63.9) for 500 mg tid. The majority of 
patients in the telotristat etiprate 250 mg and 500 mg groups showed reductions in percent change from 
baseline at week 12 in u5-HIAA while the majority of patients in the placebo group showed increases in 
percent change. The mean changes from baseline in plasma levels of 5-HIAA averaged across all time 
points during the double-blind treatment period were -187.3 ng/mL for telotristat etiprate 250 mg tid 
(n=22), -194.4 ng/mL for 500 mg tid (n=24), and 69.4 ng/mL for placebo (n=24) in the ITT population. 
Estimates (Hodges-Lehmann) of treatment differences versus placebo were -142.379 ng/mL (95% CI: 
-242.583, -60.050) for telotristat etiprate 250 mg and -124.355 ng/mL (95% CI: -201.650, -70.950) for 
500 mg. Correlations between urinary and plasma 5-HIAA levels were positive and statistically significant 
during the double-blind treatment period DBT Period at baseline, week 6, and week 12 for all groups 
(p<0.001 for all comparisons) in the ITT population. Reductions in u5-HIAA levels in patients previously 
assigned to placebo and telotristat etiprate 250 mg tid approached similar percentage changes to those 
seen in patients receiving telotristat etiprate 500 mg tid during the double-blind treatment phase. 
Exposure-Response Analysis of Urinary 5-HIAA 
The analysis was restricted to patients on active treatment, resulting in 187 observations from 67 
individuals (250 mg: 37 patients, 103 observations; 500 mg: 30 patients, 84 observations). Due to the 
limited u5-HIAA data available from study LX301 the exposure-response model with the best fit was a 
linear model that related the maximum plasma concentration of the active metabolite LX1033 at 
steady-state (Cmax,ss) to u5-HIAA levels. The model predicted u5-HIAA reduction at the 500 mg tid dose 
in general agreement with the study data, but due to its linear nature the 250 mg tid dose was under 
predicted (approximately 50%). The median average u5-HIAA level at baseline was 31.3 mg/24h with a 
range of 0 to 786.2 mg/24 h. The influence of age, weight, BMI, race, sex, renal impairment, hepatic 
impairment, and short-acting SSA treatment (octreotide), as well as average bowel movements, 
u5-HIAA, and SSA treatment (octreotide or lanreotide) at baseline were evaluated in the model but none

of the covariates was found to be a statistically significant predictor of variability in u5-HIAA.  
The only covariate that was identified as being predictive of u5-HIAA variability was the chromogranin A 
(CgA) level at baseline. Patients with baseline CgA ≥39 ng/mL had an u5-HIAA baseline of 61.09 mg/24 
h compared to the typical value of 7.09 mg/24 h. The population mean estimates of the slope for Cmax,ss 
in patients with baseline CgA ≥39 ng/mL was -0.016 mg/24 h compared to -0.00206 mg/24 h in patients 
with baseline CgA <39 ng/mL corresponding to expected decreases in u5-HIAA of 16.1 mg/24 h and 2.06 
mg/24 h in subjects with baseline CgA ≥39 ng/mL and for subjects with baseline CgA <39 ng/mL, 
respectively, for every 1000 nM increase in Cmax,ss due to the drug effect. 
Exposure-Response Relationship for Weekly Bowel Movements 
Exposure-response analyses of bowel movements included patients on telotristat etiprate with LX1033 
exposure estimates available and on placebo; patients included needed to have a baseline and at least 1 
documented post-first dose weekly bowel movement measurement. A total of 1454 observations from 
119 patients were included.  
Median average bowel movements at baseline were 5.29 counts/day with a range of 3.5 to 
12.5 counts/day and approximately 28% of the weekly bowel movement records were in the presence of 
rescue short-acting SSA octreotide in addition to a long-acting SSA. 
The final exposure-response model for bowel movements averaged at each study week was an inhibitory 
maximal effect (Emax) time-course model including parameters estimating the baseline average bowel 
movements, maximum reduction in bowel movements (Emax), and time to 50% of the maximum effect 
(T50).  
An exposure-response relationship was found whereby 2 separate linear functions described the 
relationship between Emax and T50 with predicted LX1033 Cmax. Assuming the median steady-state Cmax 
of 836 and 1780 nM for a typical patient administered telotristat etiprate 250 and 500 mg tid, Emax in 
bowel movements taking into account drug effect are 1.46 (28% reduction from baseline) and 1.90 (36% 
reduction from baseline) counts/day for 250 mg and 500 mg tid, respectively, compared to a reduction of 
1.055 counts/day for placebo from a baseline of 5.27 counts/day.  
The typical value estimate for T50 was 3.74 weeks for placebo patients. Additionally, as Cmax increased the 
reduction in bowel movements was more rapid with T50 being slightly shorter in patients administered 
500 mg tid (T50 of 2.16 weeks) as compared to 250 mg tid (T50 of 3 weeks). No statistically significant 
influence of age, baseline weight, baseline BMI, sex, race, baseline average bowel movements, baseline 
u5-HIAA, baseline CgA, renal function category, hepatic function category, or concomitant long- and 
short-acting SSA medications was found for weekly bowel movements.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The plasma PK of telotristat ethyl and LP-778902 has been investigated in nine Phase 1 studies in healthy 
subjects over a range of single (up to 1500 mg) and multiple oral doses (up to 500 mg tid), (capsule and 
tablet formulations; alone and coadministered with immediate-release octreotide; with and without 
food), in hepatic impairment and in 2 Phase 2 and 1 Phase 3 studies in patients with CS. 
In Phase 1 studies, dosing with telotristat ethyl in healthy subjects (dose range: 100 mg once daily to 
500 mg tid) produced statistically significant reductions from baseline in whole blood serotonin and 
24-hour urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (u5-HIAA) compared with placebo.  
In patients with carcinoid syndrome, telotristat resulted in reductions in u5-HIAA. Statistically significant 
reductions in u5-HIAA were seen for telotristat ethyl 250 mg tid compared with placebo in both Phase 3 
studies.

The pharmacokinetics of telotristat ethyl and its active metabolite have been characterised in healthy 
volunteers and patients with carcinoid syndrome. Overall, high variability in telotristat ethyl and 
LP-778902 PK parameters was observed and precluded in part statistical significant extrapolations. After 
oral administration, telotristat ethyl undergoes hydrolysis via carboxylesterases to its active and major 
metabolite. The only metabolite of telotristat (active metabolite) representing consistently > 10% of total 
plasma drug-related material was its oxidative decarboxylated deaminated metabolite, LP-951757. 
Systemic exposure to LP-951757 was about 35% of the systemic exposure to telotristat (active 
metabolite) in the mass balance study. LP-951757 was pharmacologically inactive at TPH1 in vitro.  
After oral administration to healthy volunteers, telotristat ethyl was rapidly absorbed, and almost 
completely converted to its active metabolite. Peak plasma levels of telotristat ethyl were achieved in 
0.53 to 2.00 hours and those of the active metabolite in 1.50 to 3.00 hours after oral administration.  
In patients with carcinoid syndrome on long-acting SSA therapy, there was also a rapid conversion of 
telotristat ethyl to its active metabolite. A high variability (% CV range of 18% to 99%) in telotristat ethyl 
and its active metabolite parameters was observed within the overall PK. The mean PK parameters for 
telotristat ethyl and the active metabolite appeared unchanged between week 24 and week 48, 
suggesting the achievement of steady-state conditions at or prior to week 24.   In patients treated at 250 
mg tid, a slight accumulation of telotristat levels was observed with a median accumulation ratio based on 
AUC0-4 h of 1.55 [minimum, 0.25; maximum, 5.00; n=11; week 12], with a high inter-subject variability 
(%CV=72%). In patients treated at 500 mg tid (twice the recommended dose), a median accumulation 
ratio based on AUC0-4 h of 1.095 (minimum, 0.274; maximum, 11.46; n=16; week 24) was observed, 
with a high inter-subject variability (%CV=141.8%).  
Based on the high inter-subject variability observed,  accumulation in a subset of patients with CS cannot 
be excluded. 
A significant food effect has been observed in healthy subjects with an up to 5.5 fold increase in exposure 
of telotristat ethyl and a lesser increase in exposure of LP-778902 (<1.5 fold); administration of 
telotristat etiprate with food is recommended in the proposed SmPC. In a food effect study administration 
of telotristat ethyl 500 mg with a high-fat meal resulted in higher exposure to the parent drug  (Cmax, 
AUC0-tlast, and AUC0-∞ being 112%, 272%, and 264% higher, respectively compared with the fasted 
state) and its active metabolite (Cmax, AUC0-tlast, and AUC0-∞, 47%, 32%, and 33% higher, respectively 
compared with the fasted state).  
Both telotristat ethyl and its active metabolite are > 99% bound to human plasma proteins. After oral 
administration, telotristat ethyl undergoes hydrolysis via carboxylesterases to its active and major 
metabolite. 
Following a single 500 mg oral dose of 14C-telotristat ethyl, approximately 93% of the dose was 
recovered. The majority was eliminated in the faeces, with less than 1% in the urine. 
The apparent half-life of telotristat ethyl in normal healthy volunteers following a single 500 mg oral 
dose 14C-telotristat ethyl was approximately 0.6 hour and that of its active metabolite was 5 hours. 
Following administration of 500 mg three times daily, the apparent terminal half-life was approximately 
11 hours. 
Renal excretion is a minor elimination pathway. Telotristat etiprate is intended for chronic administration 
and is likely to be used in patients with impaired renal function (see SmPC section 5.2). As per Guideline 
on the evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products in patients with decreased renal function, 
a PK study in renally impaired subjects is considered necessary and should be conducted as a post 
authorisation measure with the results submitted as a variation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/508026/2017

The results of the PK study in patients with liver impairment indicate that liver impairment leads to a 
clinically relevant increase in plasma levels, with more than a doubling of overall exposure in mild 
impairment, and more than tripling with moderate impairment (see SmPC section 5.2). Severely liver 
impaired patients were finally not tested within the study, due to potential safety concerns, as it could be 
anticipated that the increases in exposure would be even higher for these patients. 
Regarding interactions with potential CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducers and uptake transporters, these have 
been adequately described in the SmPC section 4.5 and 5.2.   
Concomitant use of gastric acid reducers such as PPIs on PK of telotristat ethyl and LP-778902 from the 
PopPK analysis is lacking. Since solubility of telotristat ethyl is markedly pH dependent in the physiological 
range, a DDI study to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of concomitant gastric acid reducers such as 
PPIs on the PK of telotristat ethyl and LP-778902 is considered necessary in line with the guideline on the 
investigation of drug interactions (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev.1 Corr.2**). Therefore, the CHMP has 
requested that a study should be performed and the results submitted as a variation. In vitro data 
demonstrated a moderate effect of loperamide, a CES2 inhibitor. Because Xermelo is being used in a 
chronic manner, the chance of patients taking other medications such as Loperamide concomitantly is 
higher. Therefore, the CHMP recommends further exploration on the interaction between concomitant 
inhibitors of CES2 and the PK of telotristat ethyl and LP-778902.  
Coadministration of single dose telotristat etiprate and immediate-release octreotide acetate injections in 
normal healthy subjects significantly reduced systemic exposure of telotristat ethyl and LP-778902 
compared to administration of single-dose telotristat etiprate alone. However, such an effect was not 
observed in patients with CS on long acting formulation SSA therapy in which mean steady-state 
exposures of LP-778902 were comparable to exposures observed in healthy subjects at steady-state in 
study LX102 (non-compartmental analysis). Overall, based on the absorption, distribution, metabolism 
and excretion (ADME) properties of octreotide, it is unlikely that coadministration of telotristat with 
octreotide will affect the PK of octreotide. 
As regards primary pharmacology of telotristat etiprate, effects on urinary (u5-HIAA) and plasma 5-HIAA 
as well as on serotonin (5-HT) levels have been investigated. Higher doses of telotristat etiprate (500 mg 
qd, bid, tid) led to a decrease in 5-HT blood levels compared to placebo and at these doses the effect was 
maintained throughout the studies. Urinary excretion of 5-HIAA was reduced with telotristat etiprate 
administration. Effects on u5-HIAA levels were consistently seen in subgroups by age, sex, baseline 
u5-HIAA, daily BM frequency, daily flushing, stool consistency, and proportion of days with nausea. As 
with urinary excretion of 5-HIAA, mean changes from baseline of 5-HIAA levels in plasma showed a 
statistically significant reduction compared to placebo. 
As regards secondary pharmacology no clinically meaningful effects of telotristat etiprate on heart rate or 
other ECG parameters have been identified. 
The influence of age on the pharmacokinetics of telotristat ethyl and its active metabolite has not been 
conclusively evaluated. No specific study has been performed in the elderly population. No statistically 
significant influence of age, baseline weight, baseline BMI, sex, race, baseline average BMs, baseline 
u5-HIAA, baseline CgA, renal function category, hepatic function category, or concomitant long- and 
short-acting SSA medications was found for weekly BMs. The substantial variability in baseline u5-HIAA 
and baseline CgA likely contributed to the inability to identify relationships between biomarkers and 
weekly BMs. Thus the results cannot provide adequate information on the relationship between plasma 
concentration and effect.

Missed doses  
In the event of a missed dose, patients should take their subsequent dose at the next scheduled time 
point. Patients should not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. 
Elderly patients (65 years of age and above) 
No specific dose recommendations are available for elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No specific study has been performed in patients with renal impairment.  
Patients with mild or moderate renal impairment should be treated with caution. No specific dose 
recommendations are available for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  
The use of telotristat is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment and in patients with 
end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score A), it may be necessary to reduce the dose 
to 250 mg twice daily according to tolerability. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh 
score B), it may be necessary to reduce the dose to 250 mg once daily according to tolerability. The use 
of telotristat is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score C) as no 
data are available (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of telotristat in the paediatric population in the indication of carcinoid syndrome. 
Method of administration  
Oral use. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the available pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data adequately characterise the 
pharmacology of telotristat. However, as the treatment of CS may be for long term use if the patient 
derives clinical benefit, some outstanding issues would need to be addressed as post authorisation 
measures. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
•  Conduct and submit the results of an in vivo drug interaction study to evaluate the effect of 
multiple doses of concomitant gastric acid reducers such as PPIs on the PK of telotristat ethyl, 
LP-778902. Expected date of submission: Q3 2018 
•  Conduct and submit the results of a PK study in subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal 
impairment in line with the recommendations given in EMA/CHMP/83874/2014, including 
analysis of protein binding. For subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, in- or 
exclusion should be thoroughly justified. Expected date of submission: Q4 2018 
The CHMP recommends the following measures to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
•  Submission of results of in vitro study XT174037 initiated to investigate the role of CYP enzymes 
in the metabolism of LP-778902.

To evaluate the clinical significance of the observed CYP2B6 induction by LP-778902, the 
applicant should consider further exploration of CYP2B6 interaction once a well validated probe 
drug of the enzyme becomes available. It is advised to follow the scientific literature. 
The applicant should consider further exploration of concomitant inhibitors of CES2 on the PK of 
telotristat ethyl and LP-778902.  
Telotristat ethyl showed some inhibition towards carboxylesterase (CES) 2 in vitro. Since the 
clinical relevance is unclear, the applicant should consider further exploration. 
In consequence of the results from in vivo DDI study LX108 with CYP3A4 substrate midazolam, it 
is recommended to evaluate the inductive potential of LX1606, LP-778902 and LP-951757 on the 
mRNA expression of intestinally expressed UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes in vitro. 
In consequence of the results from in vivo DDI study LX108 with CYP3A4 substrate midazolam, it 
should be evaluated in vitro whether telotristat ethyl and midazolam bound to CYP3A undergo 
cooperative interaction; the 1'-OH-MDZ/4-OH-MDZ ratio may serve as a biomarker of such an 
interaction. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Dosages for the phase 3 studies were primarily based on data from phase 2 studies LX202 and LX203 in 
patients with CS not adequately controlled by SSA.  
In the phase 2, dose-escalation, open-label study LX203 without placebo-control, most patients were 
titrated up to telotristat etiprate 500 mg tid. Clinical responses were seen at both telotristat etiprate 250 
mg and 500 mg tid dose levels, although 500 mg tid produced slightly more reductions in u5-HIAA 
compared to 250 mg.  
In study LX202 (double-blind, placebo-controlled study) telotristat etiprate 500 mg tid was associated 
with nausea in 44% of patients early after treatment initiation versus none on 250 mg tid, but in study 
LX203 500 mg tid was not associated with nausea after titration from lower doses. Therefore the 500 mg 
dose level was to be titrated from telotristat etiprate 250 mg tid for 7 days in a blinded manner in the 
phase 3 studies. 
Although 500 mg tid telotristat etiprate was identified as the dosage most likely to deliver a clinical benefit 
in the selected population based on clinical response (slightly more reductions in the PD marker u5-HIAA 
levels than other doses studied), telotristat etiprate 250 mg tid was selected as a starting dose based on 
the favourable safety profile in relation to efficacy.  
2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
Study LX1606-301: A Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, double-blind 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of telotristat etiprate (LX1606) in patients with carcinoid 
syndrome not adequately controlled by somatostatin analog (SSA) Therapy. 
Results described in this assessment report are based on the interim data submitted in the MAA filed in 
June 2016 (complete data for the 12-week double-blind portion of the study and partial data for the 
36-week open-label portion of the study). Updates with final results were also provided (data not shown).

During the double-blind treatment period patients received either telotristat etiprate 250 mg, 500 mg, or 
placebo tid. For patients assigned to telotristat etiprate 500 mg tid a blinded titration was used during the 
first 7 days. Upon completion of the double-blind treatment period, patients received telotristat etiprate 
500 mg tid in the open-label extension period with a titration during the first 7 days (week 13) for all 
patients. During the open-label extension period downward dose adjustment was permitted in case of 
intolerability; patients down titrated to 250 mg tid could resume a 500 mg tid dose at the discretion of the 
investigator. Patients intolerant to 250 mg tid were discontinued from the study.

Duration of treatment: Up to 48 weeks of treatment (12-week DBT Period and 36-week OLE Period). 
Objectives 
Primary Objectives: 
The primary objective of the study was to confirm that at least 1 or more treatment groups of telotristat 
etiprate compared with placebo was effective in reducing the number of BMs/day from Baseline averaged 
over the 12-week double-blind portion of the study (DBT Period) in patients not adequately controlled by 
current SSA therapy . 
Secondary Objectives: 
The secondary objectives were to assess the effects of telotristat etiprate versus placebo over the DBT 
Period of the study in patients who were not adequately controlled by current SSA therapy as determined 
by: 
•  Change from Baseline in: urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (u5-HIAA) levels at Week 12, the 
daily number of cutaneous flushing episodes averaged across all time points, abdominal pain 
averaged across all time points. 
The other efficacy objectives were to assess the effects of telotristat etiprate versus placebo over the DBT 
Period of the study in patients not adequately controlled by current SSA therapy as determined by: 
• 
Proportion of: patients with durable response, defined as the proportion of responders with ≥30% 
reduction in daily number of BMs for ≥50% of time over the DBT Period of the study; weeks in 
which patients reported adequate relief of carcinoid syndrome (CS) symptoms associated with 
gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms; patients that reported adequate relief of CS symptoms 
associated with GI symptoms at each study week; days where urgency/immediate need to 
defecate was reported; days with reports of nausea; days with ≥30% reduction in number of BMs 
from individual Baseline mean; and days with ≥1.5 reduction in number of BMs from individual 
Baseline mean 
•  Change from Baseline in: overall and domain scores of the European Organization for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and Gastrointestinal Symptoms of Carcinoid 
Neuroendocrine Tumors (GI.NET21) averaged across all time points and at each study visit where 
collected; the daily number of cutaneous flushing episodes averaged at each study week; 
abdominal pain averaged at each study week; in BM frequency averaged at each study week; 
stool consistency averaged across all time points and averaged at each study week; subjective 
global assessment of CS symptoms on an 11-point numeric rating scale averaged across all time

points and at each study week; the sensation/severity of nausea averaged across all time points 
and at each study week; u5-HIAA averaged across all time points and at Week 6; and plasma 
levels of 5-HIAA averaged across all time points and at each study week 
• 
Time to: first ≥30% worsening in BM frequency, defined as time to the first day of 2 consecutive 
weeks with a mean BM frequency at least 30% above the individual Baseline mean; first 
sustained ≥30% improvement from Baseline in BM frequency, defined as time to the first day of 
2 consecutive weeks with a mean BM frequency at least 30% below the individual Baseline mean; 
and a 3-point reduction in the weekly global assessment of severity of CS symptoms sustained for 
at least 50% of the subsequent weeks (evaluated in patients with at least 4 weeks of data from 
the week where they responded) 
•  Relationship of change from Baseline in BMs to changes from Baseline in stool consistency, 
adequate relief, nausea, urgency, and abdominal pain 
•  Relationship of changes from Baseline plasma and u5-HIAA levels to changes from Baseline in 
number of BMs, subjective global assessment, time to first improvement in BM frequency, time to 
first worsening in BM frequency, and change in symptoms (abdominal pain, stool consistency, 
urgency to defecate, and reports of nausea) over the DBT Period 
•  Correlation between 5-HIAA levels in urine and plasma over time 
•  Change in the frequency of rescue short-acting SSA used to treat bowel-related CS symptoms 
averaged across all time points and at each study week 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The objectives of the study were identical as study endpoints.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in the number of daily BMs averaged over the 
12-week double-blind phase of the trial. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were the change from baseline in urinary 5-HIAA levels at week 12, the 
change from baseline in the number of daily cutaneous flushing episodes averaged across all time points, 
and the change from baseline in abdominal pain averaged across all time points. 
Efficacy assessments include the following patient reported measures: number of daily BMs, EORTC 
QLQ-C30 & GI.NET21, subjective global assessment of symptoms associated with CS, need for rescue 
short-acting SSA therapy to treat bowel-related symptoms associated with CS, number of cutaneous 
flushing episodes, stool consistency, urgency to defecate, sensation/severity of nausea, and abdominal 
pain/discomfort. 
Daily and weekly diaries completed by patients were used to collect all efficacy assessments (number of 
daily BMs, number of daily cutaneous flushing episodes experienced, sensation of urgency to defecate, 
abdominal pain). 
A subjective global assessment of symptoms associated with CS will be evaluated using 2 methods in the 
diary. 
1)Patients will first be asked to respond to the following question: “In the past 7 days, have you had 
adequate relief of your carcinoid syndrome bowel complaints such as diarrhea, urgent need to have a 
bowel movement, abdominal pain, or discomfort?” 
Assessment report  
EMA/508026/2017  
Page 72/148 
 
 
 
 
 
2) Then patients will be asked the following question to assess global symptoms associated with CS on an 
11-point scale: “Rate the severity of your overall carcinoid symptoms over the past 7 days on a scale from 
0-10, where 0=no symptoms and 10 = worst symptoms ever experienced.” 
Patients will record the frequency and dose of subcutaneous injections of rescue, short-acting octreotide, 
if taken, in the daily diary. 
To assess sensation/severity of nausea on a daily basis, patients will record their response using a 4-point 
scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. 
Patients will record in the daily diary the level of any abdominal pain they feel on a daily basis using an 
11-point NRS. “Rate your worst abdominal (belly or tummy) pain in the past 24 hours, with “0” being “no 
pain” and “10” being “worst pain ever experienced”.” 
A telephone exit interview will be conducted on a subset of patients upon completion or withdrawal from 
the placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment period. 
The purpose of the exit interview will be to gain insight and understanding of patients’ experiences with 
symptoms of CS and to assess relevance and clinical meaningfulness of symptom improvements (eg, 
reduction in BM frequency). 
Fasting (≥6 hours) blood samples for measurement of 5-HIAA in plasma will be collected and analyzed by 
a specialty laboratory. 
24-hour urine samples will be collected and analyzed for 5-HIAA concentrations. 
Overall severity of carcinoid symptoms was measured using 2 methods. Patients were first asked to 
respond to the following question (Adequate Relief of Symptoms Score): “In the past 7 days, have you 
had adequate relief of your carcinoid syndrome bowel complaints such as diarrhoea, urgent need to have 
a bowel movement, abdominal pain, or discomfort?” A “Yes” answer was deemed to indicate a responder 
and a “No” answer indicated a nonresponder.  
Patients were then asked the following question to assess global symptoms associated with CS on an 
11-point scale (Global Symptom Score): “Rate the severity of your overall carcinoid symptoms over the 
past 7 days on a scale from 0-10, where 0 = no symptoms and 10 = worst symptoms ever experienced.” 
Sample size 
The sample size was calculated using the following assumptions for the primary endpoint. The endpoint 
was derived per patient and expressed as a rate i.e. change from baseline in the number of BMs/day 
averaged over the 12 weeks double-blind period. The statistical testing strategy aimed at finding 1 or 
more telotristat etiprate treatment groups that differed from placebo requiring statistical adjustment for 
multiple comparisons. The targeted treatment effect size specified under the alternative hypothesis was 
-1.5 BMs/day and the expected common standard deviation was 1.0 BMs/day. With a type I error of 0.025 
for each comparison of telotristat group to placebo (single-step Bonferroni multiple comparison procedure 
to ensure a family-wise type I error of 0.05), these values resulted in a sample size estimate of 22 
patients per group. A 20% dropout rate was assumed for the double-blind period.  
A statistical power of the study was set to 96% and reflected a need to assure reliable detection of the 
effect size of -1.5 BMs/day but also to provide added confidence that a smaller effect size could also be 
detected. A sample size of 35 patients per group allowed for detection of an effect size as small as -0.563 
BMs/day at a 2-sided α=0.025, resulting in a total sample size requirement of 105 patients. It was 
assumed that dropouts occurred uniformly across groups and that telotristat etiprate patients who 
dropped out responded in a similar manner to placebo patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/508026/2017  
Page 73/148 
 
 
 
 
 
The sample size of 35 patients per group was used for the subgroup of patients receiving a stable dose of 
octreotide (US registration requirement). Since randomisation was open to all patients at the 
investigational sites who qualified for the study regardless of their SSA therapy, randomisation was to be 
continued until the goal of 105 patients on octreotide was achieved. As such, the total number of patients 
randomised was not capped and was a random variable. 
The study randomised 135 unique patients in total (45 patients per group), in order to meet the smaller 
sample size requirement of 35 patients by treatment group on stable octreotide therapy.  
Randomisation 
Centralised randomisation was performed using a SAS-generated randomisation schedule. Patients were 
enrolled in consecutive order at each study site and assigned a patient number in their order of inclusion 
in the study. After determination of eligibility patients were assigned via interactive web response system 
(IWRS). 
Randomisation was stratified by baseline u5-HIAA levels categorised as ≤ULN, >ULN, and unknown. 
Balance in patient assignments groups was ensured using randomly permuted blocks of a fixed size within 
each of the 3 strata of u5-HIAA. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double blind study. The blinding was to all personnel and patients involved in the trial until 
extraction of the database except for predefined unblinding procedures. The IWRS was to provide for 
these unblinding procedures, if needed. Circumstances of a premature unblinding were to be documented 
in the source records. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) performed reviews of 
unblinded interim safety data on a quarterly basis and ad hoc at the discretion of the DSMB or the Sponsor 
(e.g. in the event of unexpected SAEs). 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The ITT Population was to include all randomized patients. Patients were to be analysed according to their 
randomized treatment. The ITT Population was to be used for all analyses of efficacy endpoints. 
The PP Population was to include all ITT patients who received study drug and had no major protocol 
violation that would interfere with the collection or interpretation of the efficacy data during the DBT 
Period. The PP Population was to be used for a sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The Safety Population was to be defined as all patients who received any fraction of a dose of study drug 
during the study. Patients were to be summarized in the safety analyses based on their actual treatment 
received on Day 1 of the DBT Period. Patients randomized to receive telotristat etiprate 500 mg tid were 
to be summarized in that group despite undergoing dose titration during the first study week. 
Adjustment for multiplicity 
The efficacy endpoints were grouped in primary, secondary, and other endpoints. 
A Bonferroni-based method was used to adjust for multiplicity in testing the primary and secondary 
endpoints. Furthermore, a hierarchical order for testing was applied; i.e., primary and secondary 
endpoints were analysed in a hierarchical order with a nominal 0.025 level for each of the 2 doses (once 
Assessment report  
EMA/508026/2017  
Page 74/148 
 
 
 
 
 
a treatment comparison was not significant at the 0.025 level, formal testing stopped for this dose). The 
order of testing the secondary endpoints was as follows: Change from Baseline in urinary 5-HIAA levels at 
week 12; change from Baseline in the daily number of cutaneous flushing episodes averaged across all 
time points during the Double-blind Treatment Period; change from Baseline in abdominal pain averaged 
across all time points during the Double-blind Treatment Period. 
Analyses of all other efficacy endpoints were made in a descriptive manner using statistical tests each 
with a nominal 2-sided α-level = 0.05. 
Analysis of primary and secondary endpoints 
The primary and secondary analyses of the efficacy data were limited to the DBT Period. The primary 
endpoint (change from Baseline in the number of BMs/day averaged over the 12-week DBT Period) was 
evaluated using blocked 2-sample Wilcoxon rank sum (WRS) statistic (ie, van Elteren test) stratified by 
the Baseline u5-HIAA levels (≤ULN, >ULN, and Unknown). The Hodges-Lehman (H-L) estimator of 
location shift with its 97.5% Confidence Limit (CL) was reported for each comparison of telotristat etiprate 
and placebo. The difference in arithmetic means between treatment groups and the corresponding 95% 
CLs was also calculated and reported as a descriptive measure of treatment effect. Since the blocked WRS 
statistics lacked flexibility in modeling the impact of other variables on the test of treatment effect, a 
supplemental analysis was performed using a generalised linear model (GLM) based on the negative 
binomial (NB) distribution; the model included the number of BMs/day as the dependent variable and 
included treatment group and u5-HIAA stratification at randomization as fixed effects, and the Baseline 
number of BMs as a fixed covariate, and the natural log value of the number of days with nonmissing diary 
data was used as an offset term to adjust for variable number of days. The relative risk ratio (telotristat 
etiprate dose group: placebo) of treatment effect was derived from the model along with the 97.5% 
2-sided CLs for each contrasted risk ratio. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were evaluated using a blocked WRS statistic and H-L estimators of location 
shift. Supplemental analyses were performed including a similar model as for primary analysis for 
cutaneous flushing, and a mixed model with repeated measurements (MMRM) for change from Baseline 
in u5-HIAA levels and for change from Baseline in abdominal pain. 
The "other endpoint" durable response was compared between treatment groups using a logistic 
regression model with “durable response” (yes/no) coded as the dependent variable including the 
treatment group and Baseline urinary 5-HIAA levels (≤ULN, >ULN, and Unknown) as fixed effects, and 
the Baseline number of BMs as a fixed covariate. The odds ratio (telotristat etiprate 250 mg vs. placebo, 
and telotristat etiprate 500 mg vs. placebo) with its 95% CLs were reported. 
Handling of missing data 
For the primary analyses (ie, a blocked 2-sample WRS statistics) of the primary and the secondary 
efficacy endpoints that use the change from Baseline averaged over the 12- week double-blind portion 
(Treatment Period), the change from Baseline was imputed as zero when a patient has more than 6 weeks 
of missing data (a week of missing data is defined as a patient missing more than or equal to 4 days of 
diary in that week). Otherwise the observed data was used and the mean response was based on the 
number of days with valid, non-missing data. 
For variables analyzed weekly, if diary data in any weekly interval was at least 80% complete, the 
analysis was to use the mean response over that week, deriving the mean of the non-missing data. If 
<80% of the data are available, the mean response was considered missing for that week. For Baseline, 
at least 80% of days used to calculate Baseline means must have had no missing data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/508026/2017  
Page 75/148 
 
 
 
 
 
While patients were encouraged to continue study-related visits after the decision to withdraw, few 
patients (n=4) completed additional visits after stopping study drug. 
Sensitivity analysis to further assess the robustness of inferences made from the primary analysis: 
•  An analysis assigning the mean baseline score to missing post baseline observations, effectively 
assigning a change score of 0 to missing post baseline observations  
•  An analysis including just those patients completing the Double-blind Treatment Period and assigning 
the mean baseline score to missing post baseline observations, effectively assigning a change score 
of 0 to missing post baseline observations 
•  An analysis censoring the observation (number of daily BMs) on the day a rescue short-acting SSA 
therapy is used and 
o  Method 1: assign the mean baseline score to the censored observations. 
o  Method 2: assign the highest value recorded for the patient during the Double-blind 
Treatment Period to the censored observations. 
Subgroup analysis 
Subgroup analyses were conducted on the primary efficacy endpoint and were exploratory in nature. The 
following subgroup categories were evaluated: age (<65 and ≥65 years), sex (male and female), 
Baseline u5-HIAA levels (≤ULN, >ULN, and Unknown), and region (North America, Europe, and Rest of 
the World).

* One patient initially randomly assigned to receive telotristat 500 mg was designated a screen failure because of 
bruising found during the physical examination. This patient was subsequently rescreened, met all eligibility criteria 
and was subsequently randomly assigned a second time to telotristat 250 mg. Therefore, this patient was counted as 
randomized to each of treatment group, but was analysed in the telotristat 250 mg group. 
Recruitment 
According to the study report the double-blind treatment phase started on 08 January 2013 and the last 
patient visit for the double-blind period was on 29 May 2015. First data extraction was performed on 07 
July 2015, including final data from all patients randomised into the double-blind phase. However, for the 
provided interim study report data were again extracted on 24 September 2015 including data up to 
patient visits on 31 July 2015 at the latest in order to ensure that a single dataset extracted on the same 
date would support all analyses in the interim report including preliminary information from the 
open-label extension.

May 2015 and the data extraction was planned to include, at a minimum, all patient visits in the DBT and 
OLE Periods which occurred until 31 Jul 2015. 
Protocol amendments 
 Major protocol amendments (main changes) included: 
Amendment 1 (01 August 2012): Added 2 exclusion criteria for the purposes of screening patients who 
may not have had CS-related diarrhea. Specifically, exclusion criteria #15 and #16 were revised to clarify 
that only clinically significant findings that would compromise patient safety or the outcome of the study 
were to result in patient exclusion; 
Amendment 2 (11 April 2013): Modified the secondary endpoint describing durability and additional 
endpoints for changes in BM frequency to reflect a 30% change in response of desired criteria. Based on 
review of new data from completed Phase 2 studies by key opinion leaders in the field, a 30% change in 
response criteria was considered clinically relevant. 
Amendment 3 (06 September 2013): Revised the wording of the primary endpoint to correctly reflect that 
the planned analysis was to evaluate individual treatment groups versus placebo for a reduction of BMs 
from an initial Baseline value; Secondary endpoints were revised to align with the clinical importance of 
additional pathological and physical manifestations of CS. The other efficacy objectives were adjusted to 
accommodate changes to the planned analysis. Replaced the term “refractory” with the term “not 
adequately controlled” for the patient population expected to participate. Although early signs of 
tachyphylaxis were exhibited in the planned 
patient population, patients who were eligible to participate in this study may have experienced some 
benefit from their background somatostatin analog therapy and, thus, were no longer adequately 
controlled. Allowed patients who had undergone tumor-directed therapies and experienced little or no 
reduction in BMs to participate. Clarified sample size calculations and statistical testing. 
Amendment 5 (20 January 2015): Modified the exclusion criterion to remove the corrected QT interval 
using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) limitation of 450 msec. 
Protocol Deviations 
Double-blind Treatment Period 
Significant  protocol  deviations  during  the  DBT  Period  occurred  in  17  patients  (12.6%)  in  the  Safety

As regards to the medical history, the most frequent conditions reported were in the System Organ Class 
(SOC) GI disorders (98.5% of patients), specifically diarrhoea and abdominal pain (91.1% and 41.5%, 
respectively). 
CS was reported by 44.4% of patients overall, 48.9% on telotristat etiprate 250 mg, 53.3% on 500 mg, 
and 31.1% on placebo. The most frequently reported symptoms related to CS were diarrhoea, flushing, 
various types of abdominal pain, fatigue, and nausea. Neoplasms were reported for >95% of patients and 
had generally similar proportions across groups, except for metastases to the lymph nodes, which were 
higher in the telotristat etiprate 250 mg tid group. A history of psychiatric disorders was reported by 
41.5% of patients overall.

All 135 patients in the safety population reported ongoing SSA usage at the time of study entry 
(octreotide n=103, 76.3%; lanreotide n=32, 23.7%). Since investigators have used octreotide and 
octreotide acetate interchangeably in the reporting of concomitant medications, it is not possible to 
differentiate between long-acting release and short-acting formulations. Lanreotide and lanreotide 
acetate are also used interchangeably, but both refer to depot/autogel formulations. The following table 
summarises SSAs by name and dosage / formulation at baseline.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint  
The mean numbers of BMs/day averaged over the baseline period were 6.085, 5.805, and 5.200 for 
telotristat etiprate 250 mg, 500 mg, and placebo, respectively. The observed reductions from baseline in 
BMs/day for telotristat etiprate 250 mg and 500 mg were statistically significant compared to placebo 
(p<0.001 each). The estimate of treatment difference telotristat etiprate minus placebo (Hodges-Lehmann) 
was ˗0.813 (97.5% CI: ˗1.256, ˗0.290) for telotristat etiprate 250 mg and -0.689 (97.5% CI: ˗1.170, 
˗0.223) for 500 mg. A supplemental analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint used a generalised linear 
model (GLM) based on the negative binomial (NB) probability process. This analysis adjusted for baseline 
variables with u5-HIAA stratification as fixed effect and number of BMs as fixed covariate. A summary of 
the results are shown in Table 39.

The baseline value was defined as the mean of the responses recorded during the Run-in Period prior to the first dose 
of study drug. 
a The primary analysis used a blocked 2-sample WRS statistic (ie, van Elteren test) stratified by the u5-HIAA levels at 
randomization. 
b The supplemental analysis used a generalized linear model based on the NB distribution. The model included the 
number of BMs/day as the dependent variable and included treatment group and u5-HIAA stratification at 
randomization as fixed effects, and the baseline number of BMs as a fixed covariate. The natural log value of the 
number of days with nonmissing diary data were used as an offset term to adjust for variable number of days.

Interpretation of difference in arithmetic means is possible only on population level but difficult at an 
individual patient level when data do not have a normal distribution. In addition, the difference in 
arithmetic means is neither adjusted for the covariate used for stratification factor (u5-HIAA level) nor for 
baseline value. Therefore, a post-hoc ANCOVA analysis adjusting for baseline value was provided upon 
request during the review. The difference in arithmetic means was calculated based on an ANCOVA with 
adjustment for baseline and stratification factor. The difference between telotristat 250 mg versus 
placebo and telotristat 500 mg versus placebo are -0.609 (97.5% CI: -1.159, -0.059) and -0.695 (97.5% 
CI: -1.239, -0.150),  respectively. The result of this analysis is the one provided in the SmPC 
accompanied by 97.5% CIs (see SmPC section 5.1).

Table 40: Analysis of Urinary 5-HIAA Levels (mg/24 hours) at Week 12 during the 
Double-blind Treatment Period (ITT Population)  
The baseline value was defined as the last nonmissing assessment prior to the first dose of study drug. 
a The primary analysis used a blocked 2-sample WRS statistic (ie, van Elteren test) stratified by the u5-HIAA levels at 
randomization. 
b The supplemental analysis used a mixed model with repeated measurements (MMRM). The model used the change 
from baseline in u5-HIAA levels as the dependent variable, and included treatment group, u5-HIAA stratification at 
randomization, time (week 12) treatment-by time interaction as fixed effects, and patient as a random effect. An 
unstructured (general) covariance matrix was used to model the within-patient errors. The Kenward-Roger 
approximation was used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom.

Change from Baseline in Number of Cutaneous Flushing Episodes Averaged Across all Time Points during 
the Double-blind Treatment Period (ITT Population) 
Mean baseline values for cutaneous flushing averaged over the run-in period (counts/day) were  2.788, 
2.712, and 1.791, for telotristat etiprate 250 mg, 500 mg, and placebo, respectively. Neither telotristat 
etiprate 205 mg or 500 mg showed statistically significant differences in cutaneous flushing versus 
placebo at an α-level of 0.025.  
The estimate (Hodges-Lehmann) of the treatment difference of telotristat etiprate minus placebo was 
0.036 counts/day (97.5% CI: ˗0.230, 0.330) for telotristat etiprate 250 mg (p=0.39) and 0.000 (97.5% 
CL: ˗0.345, 0.209) for 500 mg (p=0.84). The point estimates of the rate ratios from the GLM were 0.923 
for telotristat etiprate 250 mg (p=0.74) and 1.105 for 500 mg (p=0.69) versus placebo.

Mean baseline values for abdominal pain scores averaged over the run-in period were 2.615, 2.633, and 
2.473 for telotristat etiprate 250 mg, 500 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. Neither telotristat 
etiprate 250 mg nor 500 mg comparisons versus placebo were statistically significant at an α-level of 
0.025.  
The H-L estimate (Hodges-Lehmann) of the treatment difference of telotristat etiprate minus placebo was 
-0.167 (97.5% CI: ˗0.541, 0.224) for telotristat etiprate 250 mg (p=0.28) and -0.047 (97.5% CI: ˗0.462, 
0.333) for 500 mg (p=0.87). The point estimates of the differences in LS means versus placebo were 
-0.283 for telotristat etiprate 250 mg (p=0.24) and -0.105 for 500 mg (p=0.66). 
Ancillary analyses 
Double-blind treatment phase 
Subset of Patients on a Stable Dose of Octreotide as SSA Therapy (Analysis) 
Concerning the number of bowel movements per day results for patients on a stable dose of octreotide as 
SSA therapy were similar to those of the overall population. There were 40 on telotristat etiprate 250 mg, 
33 on 500 mg, and 30 patients on placebo in this subpopulation. Point estimates (Hodges-Lehmann) of 
the change from baseline versus placebo were -0.830 BMs/day (97.5% CI: ˗1.386, -0.241) for telotristat 
etiprate 250 mg and -0.662 BMs/day (97.5% CI: ˗1.206, -0.150) for 500 mg. Sensitivity analyses were 
similar with this finding. 
Likewise, reductions in u5-HIAA at week 12 in this subpopulation were comparable to effects seen in the 
overall population and there were no effects of telotristat etiprate on cutaneous flushing episodes or 
abdominal pain.  
Bowel Movement Frequency by Week 
The applicant has also performed an analysis of changes from baseline in average BM frequency 
calculated for each study week. By week 3 compared to placebo telotristat etiprate 250 mg and 500 mg 
showed mean reductions of approximately 1 BM/day (p<0.001) with a slight further increase in mean 
reductions thereafter. At most timepoints reductions were comparable between telotristat etiprate 250 
mg and 500 mg groups. At week 12, the 500 mg group had numerically the greatest reduction in BM 
frequency with a mean change from baseline of 2.1 BM/day; however, results also fluctuated across the 
treatment period in both telotristat etiprate groups beyond week 3. At week 12, mean percent reductions 
in BM/day were 27.5%, 34.3%, and 18.5% for telotristat etiprate 205 mg, 500 mg, and placebo 
treatment, respectively. 
Bowel Movement Frequency Durable Response  
Proportion of Responders with ≥30% reduction in number of BMs/day for ≥50% of time, Proportion of 
Days with ≥30% Reduction from Baseline or ≥1.5 BM Reduction from Baseline, and Proportion of Days 
with a ≥1.5 reduction in BMs Observed per Patient 
As a measure of the durability of BM changes over the 12 weeks double-blind phase of the trial “durable 
response” was defined as a ≥30% reduction in number of BMs/day for ≥50% of time. The results of the 
analyses are presented in Table 41.

Page 87/148 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 41: Proportion of Patients With Durable Response During the Double-blind Treatment 
Period (ITT Population) 
Patients with durable response were the responders with ≥30% reduction in number of BMs/day for ≥50% of time 
over theDBT Period. The percentage was calculated based on the number of patients assessed. 
a The primary analysis used a logistic regression model with responder as the dependent variable, treatment group and 
u5-HIAA stratification at randomization as fixed effects, and baseline mean number of BMs (counts/day) as a 
covariate. 
b 95% CLs were calculated based on normal, approximation using a correction for continuity. 
c P-value was calculated based on continuity-adjusted chi-square test. 
Abbreviations: BM = bowel movement; CL = confidence limit; DBT = Double-blind Treatment; LX1606 = telotristat 
etiprate; ITT = intent-to-treat; u5-HIAA = urinary5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid 
When the full effect of telotristat is observed (during the last 6 weeks of the DBT period) the proportion 
of responders with at least 30% BM reduction was 51% (23/45) in the 250 mg group versus 22% (10/45) 
in the placebo group (post-hoc analysis). 
Also the proportion of days with ≥30% reduction in the number of BMs/day from baseline was analysed 
as additional measure of response durability. The mean proportions of days with ≥30% reductions in BMs 
were 0.441 (n=45) and 0.440 (n=45) for telotristat etiprate 250 mg and 500 mg, respectively, compared 
to 0.282 (n=45) for placebo. The estimates of the treatment differences (Hodges-Lehmann) for telotristat 
etiprate versus placebo were 0.184 (95.0 % CI: 0.055, 0.298) and 0.167 (95.0% CI: 0.039, 0.296) for 
250 mg and 500 mg, respectively (p≤0.019).  
In addition the mean proportion of days during which a reduction in BMs ≥1.5 BM/day was observed for 
each patient was analysed. The mean proportions of days with a reduction ≥1.5 BM/day were 0.498 
(n=45) and 0.451 (n=45) for telotristat etiprate 250 mg and 500 mg, respectively, compared to 0.317 
(n=45) for placebo. The H-L estimate of the treatment differences (Hodges-Lehmann) for telotristat 
etiprate versus placebo were 0.202 and 0.132, respectively (p≤0.022). 
Time to First Occurrence of Sustained ≥30% Reduction in BM Frequency from Baseline and Time to First 
Occurrence of ≥30% worsening in BM Frequency from Baseline 
The time to first sustained ≥30% reduction in BM frequency was defined as time from the first 
double-blind dose date to the first day of 2 consecutive weeks with BM frequency ≤30% of the individual 
baseline mean. Median times were 19 days (n=45) and 27 days (n=45) for telotristat etiprate 250 mg and 
500 mg, respectively. The median time could not be estimated for the placebo group because less than

half of the patients (19/45=42.2%) achieved sustained ≥30% improvement. A test of the HRs indicated 
statistically significant differences in time to event between each telotristat etiprate treatment group and 
placebo (p≤0.004) with HRs of 2.29 and 2.15 for telotristat etiprate 250 mg and 500 mg, respectively. 
Urgency to Defecate 
The mean proportions of days with urgency to defecate were 0.664, 0.603, and 0.753 for telotristat 
etiprate 250 mg (n=45), 500 mg (n=45), and placebo (n=45), respectively. Differences were statistically 
significant for telotristat etiprate 500 mg versus placebo (H-L estimate -0.129; p=0.006), but not 250 mg 
(H-L estimate -0.024; p=0.35). In a supplemental analyses using a generalised linear mixed model fitted 
to a binomial distribution results were statistically significant for both telotristat etiprate groups versus 
placebo (p<0.001). 
Stool Consistency 
The mean changes from baseline in stool consistency averaged across all time points using the Bristol 
Stool Form Scale were -0.264 (n=45), -0.361 (n=45), and -0.216 (n=45) for telotristat etiprate 250 mg, 
500 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. Differences between telotristat etiprate groups and placebo 
were not statistically significant; there was a trend towards greater reductions in stool form scores in 
patients on telotristat etiprate 500 mg compared to placebo.  
Urinary 5-HIAA Percentage Change from Baseline and Plasma 5-HIAA 
Changes in urinary and plasma 5-HIAA levels were also calculated and analysed as percentage changes 
at week 6 and 12. 
Urinary 5-HIAA showed a statistically significant reduction versus placebo in both telotristat etiprate 
groups at week 6 (WRS statistic p<0.001 both groups; MMRM p=0.004 for 250 mg, p<0.001 for 500 mg) 
and week 12 (WRS statistic and MMRM p<0.001 both groups).  
The mean changes from baseline in plasma levels of 5-HIAA averaged across all time points were -59.129 
ng/mL (n=44), -133.921 ng/mL (n=41), and 58.794 ng/mL (n=40) for telotristat etiprate 250 mg, 500 
mg, and placebo, respectively, in the ITT population. The treatment difference versus placebo was 
statistically significant for both groups [H-L estimator 250 mg -63.523 ng/mL (95% CI: -116.425, 
-35.440); p<0.001; 500 mg -92.138 ng/mL (95% CI: -128.550, -56.550; p<0.001)]. Using MMRM results 
were only statistically significant for telotristat etiprate 500 mg (p=0.022) but not 250 mg (p=0.15). 
Cutaneous Flushing 
Patients experiencing ≥2 flushing episodes per day at baseline were analysed separately for changes in 
flushing. In this subgroup, mean changes from baseline in the number of cutaneous flushing episodes 
averaged across all time points were -0.823 (n=20), -1.345 (n=19), and -0.399 (n=13) for telotristat 
etiprate 250 mg, 500 mg, and placebo, respectively. Differences between telotristat etiprate and placebo 
did not reach statistical significance. 
Abdominal Pain 
Patients with a mean baseline level of abdominal pain scores ≥3 were analysed separately for changes in 
abdominal pain. In this subgroup, mean changes from baseline in abdominal pain scores averaged across 
all time points were -1.232 (n=17), -0.991 (n=18) and -0.832 (n=17) for telotristat etiprate 250 mg, 500 
mg, and placebo respectively. Differences between telotristat etiprate and placebo were not statistically 
significant.

Subjective Measures of Carcinoid Symptoms 
The proportions of patients reporting adequate relief of carcinoid symptoms (responders) in the ITT 
population at baseline were 15.6% (n=45), 15.6% (n=45), and 22.7% (n=44) for telotristat etiprate 250 
mg, 500 mg, and placebo, respectively. Generally no statistically significant treatment differences were 
observed. The mean proportion of weeks during the 12 weeks double-blind period in which patients 
reported adequate relief of CS symptoms associated with GI symptoms was 0.388, 0.385, and 0.263 for 
the telotristat etiprate 250 mg, 500 mg, and placebo, respectively (n=45 per group). Differences were not 
statistically significant. 
Since baseline global assessment was not collected mean changes from day 6 in the subjective global 
assessment of CS symptom relief (11-point numeric scale) for patients who responded “No” on day 6 for 
adequate relief was averaged across all time points in the ITT population. Changes from day 6 were 
-0.723 (n=30), -1.419 (n=24), and -0.591 (n=29) for telotristat etiprate 250 mg, 500 mg, and placebo, 
respectively. Differences were not statistically significant. The proportions of patients who had a ≥3-point 
reduction in subjective global symptom assessment scores from day 6 were 4/31 (12.9%), 7/27 (25.9%), 
and 5/30 (16.7%) for patients on telotristat etiprate 250 mg, 500 mg, and placebo, respectively. 
Differences were not statistically significant. 
Analysis of Nausea 
The mean proportions of days with reports of nausea during the double-blind period were 0.365, 0.452, 
and 0.324 for telotristat etiprate 250 mg, 500 mg, and placebo, respectively in the ITT population(n=45 
each). The mean proportion of days that patients reported nausea was numerically greater for patients on 
telotristat etiprate compared to placebo and particularly in the 500 mg group. 
Rescue Short-Acting SSA 
The mean usage of rescue short-acting SSA at baseline (injections counts/day) was comparable across 
groups (0.450 injections/day telotristat etiprate 250 mg; 0.505 injections/day 500 mg; 0.470 
injections/day placebo) (Figure 16).

A post-hoc analysis showed that the average number of daily short-acting SSA injections used for rescue 
therapy over the 12-week DBT period was 0.3 and 0.7 in the telotristat ethyl 250 mg and placebo groups, 
respectively. 
Quality of Life: EORTC QLQ-C30 and GI.NET21 Scores 
Treatment differences for mean changes for the EORTC QLQ-C30 scores for Global Health Status/QOL and 
the individual domain scores of physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive 
functioning, social functioning, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnoea, appetite loss, constipation, 
and financial difficulties averaged across all visits were not statistically significant. 
Effects were only seen for the individual subscales of insomnia and diarrhoea. Mean changes from 
baseline in scores of the diarrhoea subscale across all visits were -19.231, -21.622, and -8.547 for 
telotristat etiprate 250 mg, 500 mg, and placebo, respectively. Mean scores at baseline were 80.83, 
78.05, and 74.60 versus 60.00, 59.26, and 62.86 at week 12, respectively. 
The comparison between both telotristat etiprate groups and placebo for insomnia across all visits showed 
an improvement in insomnia of 7.69 points from baseline for patients on placebo, while patients receiving 
telotristat etiprate 250 mg and 500 mg experienced mean worsening of insomnia of 3.33 and 4.39 points, 
respectively.  
The mean change from baseline in the EORTC GI.NET21 scores averaged across all visits for the individual 
subscales endocrine, GI symptoms, treatment, social function, muscle/bone pain symptom, sexual 
function, information/communication function, and body image were not statistically significant. 
The subscale of disease-related worries showed fewer disease-related worries for placebo compared to 
telotristat etiprate 250 mg and 500 mg, although the latter did not reach statistical significance. The 
analysis by study week showed improvement for placebo and stable results for telotristat etiprate 250 mg 
and 500 mg at week 12; differences compared to placebo reached statistical significance. 
Exit Interview Substudy 
In the Exit Interview Substudy patients described a high bowel movement frequency as the most 
important symptom of CS. It adversely affected their lives by interfering with emotional, social, and 
physical activities. During the trial, 21 out of 35 patients interviewed noted a reduction in bowel 
movement frequency. In 20 cases the reduction was described as meaningful by the patient (sense of 
freedom from bathroom, being better able to enjoy life and participate in physical and social activities). 
Among the 35 interview participants, 33 answered a question on satisfaction with the ability of blinded 
study drug to treat CS. There were 12 patients who were “very satisfied”, all on telotristat etiprate. 
Proportions of patients who were “very satisfied” were 5/9 (56%) on telotristat etiprate 250 mg, 7/15 
(47%) on 500 mg, and 0/9 (0%) on placebo. 
Among the interview participants, 9 patients met the durable response criteria during the double-blind 
treatment period, including 8 patients on telotristat etiprate (all “very satisfied”). There was 1 interview 
participant who experienced a durable response on placebo, who did not report satisfaction with 
treatment. 
Open label extension (OLE) period 
Weekly Bowel Movements 
Reductions in mean BM counts/day were maintained during the open-label extension period; reductions 
from baseline were in the range of approximately -1.6 to -2.0 from week 13 through week 33. A reduction 
in the mean BMs counts/day and in percent change from week 12 through week 48 was observed 
throughout the open-label extension.  
Assessment report  
EMA/508026/2017  
Page 91/148 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients previously assigned to placebo and telotristat etiprate 250 mg showed reductions in mean BMs 
counts/day (-0.311 and -0.257, respectively) and percent change from week 12 (-3.803 and -3.111, 
respectively) beginning at week 13. By week 15, patients originally assigned to placebo showed BM 
reductions similar to those on telotristat etiprate 500 mg at week 3 of the double-blind period. Patients 
originally assigned to telotristat etiprate 250 mg showed additional reductions. 
An analysis of weekly BMs (counts/day) in patients on a stable dose of octreotide at study entry during the 
open-label extension period showed results comparable to those for the ITT population. 
Urinary 5-HIAA 
Urinary 5-HIAA levels (mg/24 h) were analysed at weeks 18, 24, and 48 during the open-label extension. 
Reductions in u5-HIAA were observed at all measured time-points, although the week 48 data reflect 
fewer patients at the time of data extraction.  
Results for patients on a stable dose of octreotide at study entry during the open-label period were 
comparable to those for the ITT population. 
In an analysis of change from week 12 by study visits week 18, 24, and 48 reductions in mean u5-HIAA 
levels were seen at week 18 for patients previously assigned to placebo and telotristat etiprate 250 mg. 
Reductions in mean u5-HIAA levels were seen for all patients at weeks 24 and 48. 
Cutaneous Flushing 
Only minimal reductions from week 12 in mean flushing episodes (counts/day) were seen throughout the 
open-label extension; results were comparable to those seen during the double-blind period. 
Abdominal Pain 
Results for changes in weekly abdominal pain (11-point NRS) during the open-label extension period were 
similar to those observed during the double-blind period, with minimal reductions in mean scores from 
baseline. 
Stool Consistency 
In general, improvements in stool consistency in the range of -0.5 to -0.7 were observed during the 
open-label extension period and the magnitude of change from baseline was sustained during this period. 
Subjective Global Assessment of CS Symptoms 
For the subjective global assessment of CS symptoms (11-point NRS) during the open-label extension 
period result were in similar ranges (3.2 to 3.7) to those observed at most time points for all treatment 
groups during the double-blind period. 
Nausea 
A summary of weekly sensation/severity of nausea during the open-label extension period was 
comparable to results from the double-blind period; there were no significant observations in the nausea 
data for the open-label extension period.

Plasma 5-HIAA 
In general, reductions in plasma 5-HIAA levels were sustained during the open-label extension period. 
Rescue SSA 
The frequency of rescue SSA showed minimal changes during the open-label extension period. 
EORTC QLC-C30 
As regards EORTC QLQ-C30 scores reductions from baseline in the insomnia subscale were seen at weeks 
24 (-1.92) and 48 (-7.69), and in the diarrhoea subscale at week 24 (-27.59) and week 48 (-28.21). 
EORTC GI.NET21 
In the EORTC GI.NET21 scores improvements of 5.82 and 5.33 were seen in the GI symptoms subscale 
at weeks 24 and 48, respectively. Similar improvements were seen in the endocrine, social, and 
disease-related worries scales.

Subjects with Symptomatic Carcinoid Syndrome Refractory to Stable-dose Octreotide Long-acting 
Release Depot Therapy’ was conducted at 11 study sites in the USA between 19 August 2009 and 12 June 
2014; the study report is dated 18 August 2015. 
The study included patients with symptomatic CS on stable-dose octreotide long-acting release depot 
therapy. The study was conducted in 2 parts; a dose-escalation or dose-finding and a confirmation of dose 
selection via an expansion cohort of 8 additional patients. Both parts had a pretreatment period of up to 
6 months including screening and run-in, a 28 days double-blind treatment period, and a 14 days 
follow-up period.  
Patients who completed the initial 28-day double-blind treatment period and were at least 75% compliant 
with dosing and daily diary completion could participate in an optional 8-week open-label extension and 
if eligible in a further 172-week open-label extension. 
In part 1, 4 cohorts of 4 patients each were given ascending doses of 150 mg, 250 mg, 350 mg, and 500 
mg telotristat etiprate tid or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. In the absence of dose-limiting toxicities, dose 
selection for part 2 was to be confirmed at the optimal dose level determined by complete response to 
treatment; complete response was defined as less than 4 BMs/day, or a decrease in daily BMs ≥50% from 
baseline, or a positive response to global assessment question (“In the past 7 days, have you had 
adequate relief of your carcinoid syndrome bowel complaints …?”) for the last 2 weeks of the 28-day 
period. 
With the exception of cohort size and number of patients part 2 was conducted similar to part 1 and used 
the same study procedures, durations, and schedules. 
The study recruited adults of both gender with biopsy-proven metastatic carcinoid tumour with disease 
extent confirmed by CT scan, MRI, or radionuclide imaging who were refractory to a stable-dose of 
octreotide therapy.  
The primary efficacy measure was the number of daily BMs. Secondary efficacy measurements included 
description of the average stool form for BMs, sensation of urgency to defecate, subjective global 
assessment of symptoms associated with CS, description of abdominal pain or discomfort, CgA levels, 
number of cutaneous flushing episodes, and frequency of rescue, short-acting octreotide dosing. 
Pharmacodynamic assessments included determinations of 5-HT levels in blood and 5-HIAA levels in 
urine and plasma and other assessments the use of concomitant medications for relief of symptoms 
associated with CS in the extension period. Furthermore, safety and PK assessments were included.  
Twenty-three (23) patients were enrolled and analysed for the core phase; 22 patients completed the 
core phase and 19 patients were eligible for and entered the open-label extension.  
Results 
All telotristat etiprate groups had a mean reduction in BMs/day each week during the core phase of -0.20 
to -2.17 BMs/day except for the telotristat etiprate 500 mg group at week 3, while on placebo patients 
showed no reduction in weekly mean number of BMs/day from baseline at any week.  
Seven (7/14; 50%) patients on telotristat etiprate reported an improvement in symptoms associated with 
CS at week 4 versus no patient on placebo.  
Mean reductions in cutaneous flushing episodes ranging from -0.03 to -1.7 episodes/day across telotristat 
etiprate 150 mg, 250 mg, and 350 mg groups were noted; on placebo patients reported mean increases 
at weeks 1 and 2 and mean reductions at weeks 3 and 4.

Introduction 
The phase 2 study LX203 titled ‘A Phase 2, Open-label, Multi-center, Serial Ascending-dose, Dose-finding 
Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of LX1606 in Subjects with Symptomatic Carcinoid 
Syndrome’ was conducted at 11 sites in the UK and Germany between 15 June 2010 and 12 February 
2014. The study report is dated 03 August 2015.  
The study included adult patients of both gender with symptomatic CS and biopsy-proven metastatic 
carcinoid tumour with disease extent confirmed by CT, MRI, or radionuclide imaging. It consisted of a 
2-week run-in phase followed by serially dose escalations from telotristat etiprate 150 mg tid every 14 
days up to a maximum of 500 mg tid (150 mg, 250 mg, 350 mg, 500 mg) guided by achieving a weekly 
average of <4 BMs/day for each of the 2 weeks of treatment, or a reduction in average number of daily 
BMs ≥50% from baseline, or a positive response to the global assessment question, or a reduction in the 
average number of daily flushing episodes ≥50% from baseline, or dose-limiting toxicity. Once an 
individual optimal dose or a maximum tolerated dose was identified this was continued for a period of 4 
weeks. Upon completion of the 4-week stable-dose period, eligible patients defined as achieving at least 
1 of the clinical criteria described above could continue for additional 124 weeks.  
Efficacy assessments included change in the number of daily BMs, description of average stool form / 
consistency, sensation of urgency to defecate, sensation / severity of nausea, subjective global 
assessment of symptoms associated with CS, description of abdominal pain or discomfort, number of 
cutaneous flushing episodes, and clinically meaningful symptom reduction (weekly average of <4 
BMs/day for each of 2 weeks, or decrease in average daily BMs ≥50% from baseline, or positive response 
to global assessment question, or decrease in average daily flushing episodes ≥50% from baseline) as 
well as BM response rate, cutaneous flushing response rate, generalised linear analysis of number of BM 
and cutaneous flushing episodes, change in CgA level, use of concomitant medications for relief of 
symptoms associated with CSs, and investigator assessment of symptom improvement. PD assessments 
included 5-HT, plasma 5-HIAA, and u5-HIAA levels. Safety and PK assessments were also included. 
Results 
In the core phase patients on telotristat etiprate had a steady decrease in mean number of BMs/day from 
week 3-4 to week 9-10; the reduction in mean number of BMs/day from baseline was statistically 
significant for all time points (p<0.001). There was suggestion of a plateau in the change scores from 
week 9-10 to week 11-12 the time most patients had received the maximum dose of telotristat etiprate 
500 mg tid. 
Stool form improved from loose stool at baseline to soft stool at week 11-12 and the change from baseline 
in biweekly mean stool form (6-point scale) was statistically significant for all time points (p≤0.05). 
The mean proportion of days with sensation of urgency to defecate was numerically lower at every time 
point compared to the run-in period, but the difference was statistically significant only for week 7-8 
(p=0.042 paired t-test, p=0.047 signed-rank test). 
Patients had a reduction from baseline in sensation / severity of nausea (100-mm visual analogue scale, 
4-point scale) except at week 1-2, with statistically significant improvement at week 7-8 (p<0.05 paired 
t-test and signed-rank test) and week 11-12 (p=0.027 paired t-test). 
Abdominal pain scores and cutaneous flushing episodes were low at baseline for most patients and 
generally remained so.

5-HT levels remained below baseline and a reduction from baseline in mean number of BMs generally 
corresponded to a reduction from baseline in 5-HT level. Urinary 5-HIAA levels decreased from baseline 
from week 2 through week 12. 
Study LX302 
Introduction 
The ongoing phase 3 study LX302 titled “A Multicenter, Long-term Extension Study to Further Evaluate 
the Safety and Tolerability of Telotristat Etiprate (LX1606)” is being conducted at 29 centres in the USA, 
Canada, Germany, the UK, Italy, France, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Australia. The 
study started on 14 January 2014; data have been provided up to the data cut-off for the interim report 
16 October 2015.  
Study LX302 is an uncontrolled, open-label, long-term extension study; patients still enrolled in any 
telotristat etiprate phase 2 CS study (LX202, LX203) could enter and patients who participated in the 
phase 3 CS studies (LX301, LX303) could enter at week 48 visit without interruption in telotristat etiprate 
dosing. Patients were to continue at the same dose of telotristat etiprate as in their original study for 84 
weeks.  
Upon completion or early withdrawal, patients were required to complete a 14-day follow-up without 
telotristat etiprate. 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of telotristat 
etiprate and the secondary objective was to evaluate changes in patients’ quality of life (QOL). Efficacy 
assessments included patient-reported QOL measures (QLQ-C30, GI.NET21) and subjective global 
assessment of symptoms associated with CS. PD assessments included plasma 5-HIAA levels. 
Results 
At the time of the data cut-off 16 October 2015, 71 patients were enrolled into the study (10 telotristat 
etiprate 250 mg, 56 telotristat etiprate 500 mg. The 5 other patients had completed baseline visits only 
and the date of first dose was not yet reported. Thus 66 patients contributed data to the provided 
analyses. Enrolment for this study was ongoing at the time of the initial MAA submission. 
Overall domain score responses to QLQ-C30 and GI.NET21 were stable between baseline and week 24.  
The OR (95% CI) for patients reporting adequate relief relative to baseline appeared generally stable 
between week 12 (1.6; 0.643, 4.026) and week 24 (0.8; 0.303, 2.099). 
The mean change from baseline in subjective global assessment of CS symptoms on an 11-point numeric 
rating scale at each study visit appeared generally stable between week 12 and week 24. The mean 
change (SD) from baseline was 0.500 (2.439) on week 12 and 0.654 (2.365) on week 24.  
Study LX303 
Introduction 
Phase 3 study LX303, titled ‘A Phase 3, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Multicenter, Double-blind Study 
to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Telotristat Etiprate (LX1606) in Patients with Carcinoid Syndrome’, 
was started on 11 March 2014. The data cut-off for the interim report in this application is 30 October 
2015 covering the complete double-blind treatment period as well as part of the open-label extension. 
The trial was conducted at 31 sites in the USA, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, 
Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Israel, and Australia.

The study design was comparable to that of the pivotal study LX301 (see above) with the exception of 
differences in the study population. Study LX303 allowed patients not on SSA treatment to enter the trial 
if they had ≥4 BMs/day or at least 1 of the following: poor stool consistency, abdominal pain, nausea, 
flushing, or elevated u5-HIAA. If patients were on an SSA treatment, they could enter the study with <4 
BMs/day and at least 1 of the following: poor stool consistency, abdominal pain, nausea, cutaneous 
flushing, or elevated u5-HIAA. Patients who were previously screened for study LX301 and did not meet 
inclusion criteria baseline BM frequency and use of SSA therapy were eligible to enter study LX303. 
In contrast to study LX301, the primary efficacy endpoint was the percent (%) change from baseline in 
24-hour u5-HIAA levels at week 12 for telotristat etiprate 250 mg and telotristat etiprate 500 mg versus 
placebo.  
The secondary efficacy endpoints were the change from baseline in the number of BMs/day averaged over 
the 12-week double-blind treatment period; in stool consistency as measured by the Bristol Stool Form 
Scale averaged across all time points; in the number of cutaneous flushing episodes; in abdominal pain 
averaged across all time points; in the frequency of rescue SSA used to treat CS symptoms; and in the 
number of daily BMs averaged over the 12-week double-blind treatment period and at each study week 
among patients not receiving SSA at baseline. 
The primary and secondary endpoints were evaluated using the same method as study LX301. Sixty (60) 
patients were planned to be enrolled. 
Results 
Double-blind treatment 
76 patients were enrolled and randomised for the double-blind treatment period (25 telotristat etiprate 
250 mg and 500 mg each, and 26 placebo); all 76 patients were treated and 68 patients (89.5%) 
completed the double-blind treatment period [n=22 (88.0%) telotristat etiprate 250 mg and 500 mg 
each, n=24 (92.3%) placebo].  
Of the 68 patients who completed the double-blind treatment period, 67 patients (22 telotristat etiprate 
250 mg, 21 telotristat etiprate 500 mg, 24 placebo) continued into the open-label extension period. Of the 
67 patients who entered the open-label extension period, 14 (20.9%) had completed the open-label 
extension, 11 patients (16.4%) had discontinued, and 42 patients (62.7%) were ongoing at the time of 
data cut-off for the interim study report. 
Details of the ITT, PP, and safety populations are presented in the table below. Overall, 12 patients were 
excluded from the supportive efficacy analyses using the PP Population because of significant protocol 
deviations.

Demographics and baseline characteristics for the safety population were generally balanced across the 3 
treatment groups. Exceptions were: a lower proportion of patients in the telotristat etiprate 500 mg group 
receiving SSA therapy every 4 weeks [48.0% (12/25), 64.0% (16/25), and 76.9% (20/26) telotristat 
etiprate 500 mg, 250 mg, and placebo, respectively], a higher proportion of patients on telotristat 
etiprate 250 mg (n=3, 12%) and 500 mg (n=6, 24%) not receiving any SSA therapy compared to no

patient on placebo (n=0), a lower proportion of patients on placebo (12/26; 46.2%) receiving octreotide 
as SSA compared to telotristat etiprate 250 mg (17/25; 68.0%) and 500 mg (16/25; 64.0%) and a higher 
proportion receiving lanreotide as SSA [placebo 53.8% (14/26); telotristat etiprate 250 mg 20% (5/25); 
telotristat etiprate 500 mg 12.0% (3/25)], and that two-thirds of patients had baseline u5-HIAA levels 
above the ULN. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics for the open-label extension period safety population were 
similar to those in the double-blind treatment period. 
Primary endpoint 
Telotristat etiprate reduced u5-HIAA levels from baseline to week 12 for both telotristat etiprate groups 
compared to placebo and the result was statistically significant (p<0.001 each). Estimators 
(Hodges-Lehmann) for the differences in percent changes (95% CI) from baseline in u5-HIAA levels 
between telotristat etiprate and placebo at week 12 were -53.955% (-84.955, -25.119) for telotristat 
etiprate 250 mg and -89.662% (-113.104, -63.863) for telotristat etiprate 500 mg. The supplemental 
analyses using a mixed model with repeated measures as well as sensitivity and subgroup analyses by 
age, sex, baseline u5-HIAA levels, baseline mean BM frequency, daily stool consistency, average daily 
flushing frequency, average daily rating of abdominal pain, proportion of days with nausea, and use of a 
stable dose of long-acting octreotide at study entry were in line with the primary analysis.

Secondary endpoint 
The change from baseline in BM frequency (counts/d) averaged over the double-blind treatment period 
for telotristat etiprate compared to placebo was statistically significant (p≤0.004 each). The change from 
baseline in daily BM averaged over 12 weeks was +0.1 and -0.5 in the placebo and 250 mg groups 
respectively. Estimators (Hodges-Lehmann) for differences between telotristat etiprate and placebo were 
(95% CI) -0.452 BMs/day (-0.719, -0.173) for telotristat etiprate 250 mg and -0.535 BMs/day 
(-0.793, -0.254) for telotristat etiprate 500 mg.

number of days with nonmissing diary data was used as an offset term to adjust for variable number of days 
The change from baseline in stool consistency (Bristol Stool Form Scale) averaged over the double-blind 
treatment period for telotristat etiprate 500 mg compared to placebo was statistically significant 
(p=0.009), but nor for telotristat etiprate 250 mg (p=0.09). Estimator (Hodges-Lehmann) for the 
difference between telotristat etiprate 500 mg and placebo was (95% CI) -0.392 (-0.824, -0.124) and for 
telotristat etiprate 250 mg -0.203 (-0.447, 0.019).

a random effect 
A compound symmetry covariance matrix was used to model the within-subject errors. The

There were no significant differences between groups as regards the secondary endpoints changes from 
baseline averaged over the double-blind treatment period in cutaneous flushing, abdominal pain, or 
frequency of rescue SSA therapy to treat CS symptoms. 
Other endpoints 
The absolute reduction in u5-HIAA levels from baseline at week 12: estimates (Hodges-Lehmann) of 
treatment differences versus placebo were (95% CI) -29.800 mg/24 h (-78.800, -9.200) for telotristat 
etiprate 250 mg and -40.600 mg/24 h (-96.400, -28.700) for telotristat etiprate 500 mg.  
The plasma 5-HIAA levels compared to placebo: estimators of the treatment differences versus placebo 
were (95% CI) -142.379 ng/mL (-242.583, -60.050) for telotristat etiprate 250 mg and -124.355 ng/mL 
(-201.650, -70.950) for telotristat etiprate 500 mg.

 There were 40% patients (10/25) with durable response in the telotristat ethyl 250 mg group, versus 0% 
in the placebo group (0/26) (p=0.001).The mean proportions of days with ≥30% reduction in the number 
of BMs were 0.428, 0.414, and 0.154 for telotristat etiprate 250 mg, 500 mg, and placebo, respectively. 
The comparison of telotristat etiprate versus placebo on the proportion of days with ≥30% reduction in 
the number of BMs/day from baseline was statistically significant (p<0.001 each). Estimates 
(Hodges-Lehmann) of the differences versus placebo were (95% CI) 0.250 (0.074, 0.440) for telotristat 
etiprate 250 mg and 0.250 (0.060, 0.428) for telotristat etiprate 500 mg.  
The worsening of BM frequency by ≥30% was more common on placebo (11 events) than in the telotristat 
etiprate 250 mg (7 events) and 500 mg groups (3 events). The HRs for time to occurrence compared with 
placebo (95% CI) were 0.53 (0.18, 1.41) and 0.25 (0.06, 0.81) for telotristat etiprate 250 mg and 500 
mg, respectively.  
A worsening of the EORTC QLQ-C30 was observed in the individual subscale of constipation for both 
telotristat etiprate groups compared to placebo; this increase was more pronounced for telotristat 
etiprate 500 mg. 
Open-label extension  
Sixty-seven (67) patients entered the ongoing open-label extension period. Reductions in u5-HIAA levels 
were sustained in the open-label extension period. The limited data available indicate reductions in 
u5-HIAA levels in patients originally assigned to placebo at weeks 18 and 24.  
Reductions in BM frequency and stool consistency were also stable for patients previously assigned to 
telotristat etiprate 500 mg and approached similar levels to those seen for patients previously assigned to 
telotristat etiprate 500 mg in patients previously assigned to placebo or telotristat etiprate 250 mg. 
Other results were generally comparable to those seen in the double-blind treatment phase of the trial. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The applicant provided a comparison across studies LX301 and LX303. The study design and assessments 
were very similar except for the inclusion criteria as study LX 303 was designed to include patients with 
CS who were not eligible for the pivotal trial LX301, i.e. patients did not have to be on SSA therapy or who 
had <4 BMs/day (see description under Supportive Studies – Study LX303).  
Disease characteristics were as follows: mean baseline u5-HIAA levels ranged from 80.968 mg/24 h to 
92.645 mg/24 h in study LX301 and from 66.048 mg/24 h to 86.300 mg/24 h in study LX303. Mean 
baseline BM counts/day ranged from 5.200 to 6.085 in study LX301 and from 2.186 to 2.786 in study 
LX303. Mean stool consistency (weekly) using the Bristol Stool Form Scale ranged from 5.917 to 5.970 for 
study LX301 and from 4.965 to 5.291 for study LX303.  
Baseline characteristics for age, gender, race, ethnicity, weight, and BMI were similar across these 
studies.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Overall, efficacy data for telotristat etiprate in patients with CS have been derived from phase 2 studies 
LX202 and LX203, the pivotal phase 3 study LX301, and phase 3 studies LX303, and LX302.  
The pivotal phase 3 trial LX301 was a randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, 
double-blind study in patients with CS not adequately controlled by SSA therapy. The general design of 
this pivotal trial LX301 is considered acceptable. After a 3 to 4 weeks run-in period, patients on stable SSA 
therapy were assigned to either 250 mg or 500 mg telotristat etiprate or to placebo.  
Evaluation of telotristat etiprate 250 mg tid and 500 mg tid dosages for use in the phase 3 trials has been 
adequately justified although the dose selection is based rather on a maximal tolerated dose approach 
than on consistent phase II data; as dose-finding in this orphan condition is considered particularly 
difficult the chosen approach is acceptable. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria of trial LX301 are in general acceptable. During scientific advice the 
applicant was requested to exclude serotonin receptor antagonists (e.g. ondansetron) from the 
concomitant medications to avoid bias as well as potential safety problems, but this has not been

followed; the applicant provided further evidence that the use of serotonin receptor antagonists did not 
influence study results, which is agreed.  
The objectives and the relevant endpoints of study LX301 are generally considered acceptable. The 
primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in the number of daily BMs averaged over the 
12-week double-blind phase of the trial. This primary endpoint might be a sensitive and objective 
measure of the predominant symptom of CS which can potentially be influenced by telotristat etiprate.  
The randomisation was adequate. The methods used to ensure that patients and personnel involved in 
the study were blinded to treatment allocation are considered sufficient. It is noted that the applicant did 
not have a clear perception on the minimal clinically important difference for the primary endpoint. 
Consequently, a sample size was chosen that was able to detect the assumed treatment effect of 
-1.5 BMs/day with larger power than usual (96%) but that gave also larger power for detection of smaller 
treatment effects. 
The statistical methods were generally acceptable. Endpoints were divided in primary endpoint, three 
secondary endpoints, and more than 20 "other endpoints" (it should be noted that a response endpoint 
which was recommended as a key secondary endpoint by CHMP scientific advice was explored among the 
other endpoints). The multiple testing strategy controlled the family-wise type 1 error for primary and 
secondary endpoints adequately. The large number of "other endpoints" suggests that these were 
planned to be analysed with an exploratory intent and results for these endpoints have to be interpreted 
with care taking multiplicity into account.  
For the handling of missing values it was not distinguished between missing data before and after 
discontinuation of treatment. Nevertheless, the sensitivity analyses appear to be sufficient for 
assessment of the influence of missing data on the estimates of the treatment effect (also taking the 
actual number of missing data, missing data patterns, and results of sensitivity analysis into account). 
Assessing the treatment effect irrespective of rescue medication in the primary analysis probably reflects 
the expected effect in clinical practice and is adequate; sensitivity analyses aiming to estimate the 
treatment effect in absence of rescue medication were provided and are appropriate.  
The protocol amendments and the protocol deviations are not considered to have affected the outcome of 
this trial in a negative way.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The treatment groups were sufficiently balanced regarding demographics and baseline characteristics, 
except for more patients on telotristat etiprate 250 mg receiving octreotide instead of lanreotide at study 
entry compared to placebo and telotristat etiprate 500 mg and a higher proportion of patients on 
telotristat etiprate 500 mg receiving their SSA therapy every 3 weeks compared to telotristat etiprate 250 
mg and placebo. The vast majority of patients were of ‘white’ ethnicity. A history of psychiatric disorders 
was reported by 41.5% of patients overall, similar across groups. 
The primary study endpoint of change from baseline  in the number of BMs/day averaged over the 
12-week double-blind period in trial LX301 met the predefined criteria of statistical significance in both 
telotristat etiprate groups. The estimates of the treatment differences (Hodges-Lehmann) were about 
˗0.8 (97.5% CI: ˗1.256, ˗0.290) for telotristat etiprate 250 mg and -0.7 (97.5% CI: ˗1.170, ˗0.223) for 
telotristat etiprate 500 mg from a baseline of about 5 to 6 average BMs/day. Supplemental and sensitivity 
analyses were generally in line with these findings. The pre-specified responder analysis shows that there 
were twice more responders in the telotristat groups (44% and 42% in the 250 mg and 500 mg groups, 
respectively, versus 20% in the placebo group). When the full effect of telotristat is observed (during the 
Assessment report  
EMA/508026/2017  
Page 109/148 
 
 
 
 
 
last 6 weeks of the DBT period) the proportion of responders with at least 30% BM reduction was 51% 
(23/45) in the 250 mg versus 22% (10/45) in the placebo group (post-hoc analysis) (see SmPC section 
5.1).  
Post-hoc sub group analyses to evaluate the potential effect of concomitant medications (especially 
antidiarrhoeals and opioids) were requested to the Applicant. The responder analysis shows that in 
non-users of antidiarrhoeals there were 23% of responders in the placebo group (7/30) and 36% of 
responders in the telotristat 250 mg group (9/25); thus only 13% of patients benefited from the 
treatment. While in the whole population, telotristat 250 mg and telotristat 500 mg were associated with 
a similar responder rate of approximately 50% of patients compared to 22% of patients on placebo during 
the last 6 weeks of the DBT Period in Study LX301. Also in the non-users of opioids  the responder rates 
in placebo and telotristat 250mg users were 24% (9/38) and 44% (14/32), respectively. This again 
indicates that opioids somewhat favour treatment effect of telotristat, although less than for 
antidiarrhoeals.  Thus, treatment with telotristat etiprate 250 mg or 500 mg tid over 12 weeks led to a 
reduction of slightly less than 1 BM per day versus placebo from a background of 5 to 6 BMs per day at 
baseline. It is acknowledged that gastrointestinal symptoms have a substantial impact on the quality of 
life. Although the results did not meet the magnitude of the agreed overall reduction in the number of 
BMs/day of approximately 30% for a clinically important benefit, the results from the secondary 
endpoints support a general overall clinical benefit in symptom relief experienced in CS patients. The 
analysis of change in BMs by treatment week showed an effect of telotristat etiprate from week 3 
onwards. Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint change in BMs per day by age, sex, baseline 
u5-HIAA levels, and region were in line with the primary finding. The data from studies LX202, LX203, 
LX303, and LX302 are also supportive of the primary efficacy variable. 
There were no significant differences between both telotristat etiprate groups and placebo as regards 
mean changes from baseline in stool consistency. 
The effect of telotristat etiprate on cutaneous flushing and abdominal pain are relevant from a clinical 
perspective. However, no relevant effect of telotristat etiprate have been found in this trial. 
As regards concomitant medications analgesics, antidiarrheals, intestinal anti-inflammatory / 
anti-infective agents, drugs for acid related disorders, and ondansetron were used by more patients in the 
telotristat etiprate groups compared to placebo, which appears to have introduced a bias towards an 
overestimation of the effect of telotristat etiprate. However, further sensitivity analyses were provided 
and although it is impossible to completely rule out an effect of concomitant medication on the clinical 
benefit observed for BMs, it is nevertheless established that in the totality of the data, there is sufficient 
evidence to demonstrate a clinical benefit from telotristat treatment in patients that have responded to 
telotristat therapy. 
Demonstration of durability of effect of telotristat etiprate in the target population is considered essential. 
The applicant has provided analyses of the durability of the change in the frequency of BMs per day using 
as definition either the proportion of responders with ≥30% reduction in number of BMs/day for ≥50% of 
time, the proportion of days with ≥30% reduction from baseline or ≥1.5 BM reduction from baseline, or 
the proportion of days with a ≥1.5 reduction in BMs observed per patient. Overall, about 44%, 42%, and 
20% of patients on telotristat etiprate 250 mg, 500 mg, and placebo, respectively, had a ≥30% reduction 
in number of BMs per day for ≥50% of time. The mean proportions of days with ≥30% reductions in BMs 
were about 0.4, 0.4, and 0.3 for telotristat etiprate 250 mg, 500 mg, and placebo, respectively. The mean 
proportions of days during which a reduction in BMs ≥1.5 BM per day was observed for each patient were 
0.5, 0.5, and 0.3 for telotristat etiprate 250 mg, 500 mg, and placebo, respectively. Thus using the 
responder definition of ≥30% reduction in number of BMs/day for ≥50% of time for a durable response 
about double the number of patients on telotristat etiprate reached this criterion compared to placebo; 
Assessment report  
EMA/508026/2017  
Page 110/148 
 
 
 
 
 
durability has also been shown based on the two other definitions (days with ≥30% reductions in BMs, 
days with reduction in BMs ≥1.5 BM per day).  
In the analysis of treatment differences for mean changes in the EORTC QLQ-C30 scores for Global Health 
Status / QOL and the individual domain scores, effects were only seen for the individual subscales 
insomnia and diarrhoea. The comparison between telotristat etiprate and placebo for insomnia across all 
visits showed an improvement of 7.69 points for patients on placebo, while on telotristat etiprate patients 
experienced mean worsening of 3.33 and 4.39 points for 250 mg and 500 mg tid, respectively. Mean 
changes from baseline in scores of the diarrhoea subscale across all visits showed higher improvement in 
patients on telotristat etiprate compared to placebo. Baseline values were also different between groups 
with worse baseline scores for patients on telotristat etiprate compared to placebo while after 12 weeks 
of treatment mean scores were comparable between groups.  
As regards the open-label extension phase of study LX301 interim data were provided at the time of the 
initial submission. About 84% of patients enrolled in the double-blind treatment phase started to 
participate in the open-label extension period. Reductions in the frequency of mean BMs per day and in 
the urinary excretion of 5-HIAA were generally maintained during the open-label extension period and 
patients previously on placebo showed reductions similar to those on telotristat etiprate in the 
double-blind period.  
In the exit interview substudy, the patient’s view on the benefit of treatment on CS symptoms 
participating patients described a high BM frequency as the most important symptom of CS; about 
one-third of patients in the substudy noted a reduction in BM frequency and the majority of these patients 
described it as meaningful. However, only a subset of patients has been included in this exit interview 
substudy where  out of 73 eligible patients 39 consented to participate; of these only 35 patients have 
been interviewed.  Therefore, the data is of limited value and can only be considered generally supportive.  
A summary of final LX301 data (complete data of both the double-blind and open-label portions of the 
study) was submitted as part of the responses to D120 LoQ in February 2017. The last patient visit for the 
double-blind treatment period was on 29 May 2015 and the last patient visit for the open-label extension 
was on 17 March 2016. The final data lock was on 13 September 2016 while the date of the extraction for 
the interim CSR submitted in the initial application was 24 September 2015. The data provided did not 
indicate the need for relevant changes in the efficacy conclusions. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with telotristat 
in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of carcinoid syndrome (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Treatment with telotristat etiprate 250 mg and 500 mg led to a statistically significant reduction in the 
number of BMs per day from baseline to week 12. The effect size was slightly less than a difference of 1 
BM per day versus placebo from a background of 5 to 6 BMs per day at baseline. When durability of the 
change in the frequency of BMs per day was defined as ≥30% reduction in number of BMs per day for 
≥50% of time the proportion of patients on telotristat etiprate having a durable response was about 
double that on placebo (>40% versus 20%). Durability has also been shown based on the definition mean 
proportion of days with ≥30% reductions in BMs and mean proportion of days with a reduction in BMs 
≥1.5 BM per day. Supportive data have been provided from studies LX202, LX203, LX303, and LX302 and 
the results are generally in line with findings in the pivotal trial. Thus overall the effects seen in the clinical 
Assessment report

Page 111/148 
 
 
 
 
 
trial are sufficiently consistent, but are primarily focussed on the small change in the frequency of BMs of 
less than 1 BM per day based on a background of 5 to 6 BMs per day at baseline. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
For the purpose of the overall analysis of safety, the applicant presented the safety data as pooled safety 
analyses groups, which comprise the following: 
- 
The Phase 1 safety analysis which includes: 
- The single-dose studies LX101 and LX 104 (55 subjects) 
- The multiple-dose studies LX102, LX 106, and LX 108 (88 subjects) 
- The crossover studies LX 103, LX 104, LX 107, and LX 109 (116 subjects) 
- 
The Phase 2 and Phase 3 analyses, which comprise the following subgroups: 
- 
The Placebo controlled safety analyses: This includes mainly the safety data from the  
studies LX 301 and LX303, with limited integration of the TEAE data from  250   
mg tid and 500 mg tid treatment groups from study LX202. 
- 
- 
The Overall Safety Analyses, which includes all studies LX202, LX203, LX301, LX302,  
and LX303 with double-blind and open-label periods (239 patients). 
The long-term safety analyses: These include all patients in the studies LX202, LX203,  
LX301, LX302, and LX 303 who received any dose of telotristat etiprate and were treated for at least 24 
weeks (148 patients), or at least 48 weeks (74 patients). 
A safety update (integrated summary of safety) was submitted as part of the Applicant’s responses to 
D120 LoQ in February 2017. Subsequently, the CHMP requested an updated module 2.7.4 as part of the 
D180 LoOI, which was provided, together with an updated Module 2.5, as part of the responses to D180 
LoOI in June 2017. Section 2.7 of this assessment report is based on the initial MAA dossier submitted on 
22 June 2016, unless otherwise stated.  
Patient exposure 
For the ongoing studies LX301-303, the data extraction date was: 24th September 2015 for study LX301, 
16th October 2015 for study LX302, and 30th October for study LX303. A total number of 566 subjects 
has been included into the trials conducted, of which were 259 healthy volunteers, 249 patients with CS, 
and 58 patients with ulcerative colitis. 
The following tables show the summary of exposure for the overall safety population, and the two

appetite. All other adverse reactions were reported as mild or moderate. 
Analysis of Adverse Events of special interest 
Based on the observations in non-clinical studies, Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies adverse events related to 
hepatic  enzyme  abnormalities  (see  laboratory  findings  section),  depression,  and  GI  symptoms  were 
identified as of special interest. 
Gastrointestinal Adverse Events 
The most frequently reported adverse event in patients receiving telotristat was abdominal pain (25.7%; 
18/70) versus placebo (19.7%; 14/71). Abdominal distension was reported in 7.1% of patients (5/70) 
receiving telotristta ethyl 250 mg tid, versus 4.2% in the placebo group (3/71). Flatulence was seen in 
5.7% of patients (4/70) and 1.4% (1/71) in the telotristat 250 mg and placebo groups, respectively (see 
SmPC section 4.8). Most events were mild or moderate and did not limit study treatment.  
Constipation was reported in 5.7% of patients (4/70) in the telotristat ethyl 250 mg group and in 4.2% of 
patients (3/71) in the placebo group. Serious constipation was observed in 3 patients treated with a 
higher dose (500 mg) in the overall safety population (239 patients). 
Phase 1 Studies 
Adverse  events  of  special  interests  related  to  GI  symptoms  were  integrated  for  Phase  1  studies  in  3 
groups: Single-dose Studies (LX101 and LX104), Multiple-dose Studies (LX102, LX106, and LX108), and 
Crossover Studies (LX103, LX105, LX107, and LX109). 
Overall, a total of 71 subjects experienced 117 AESIs related to GI symptoms, 37 male and 34 female. 
The age of these healthy volunteers ranged from 18 to 54 years. The most frequently reported events 
were diarrhoea (38 events in 33 subjects), nausea (35 events in 31 subjects) and abdominal pain (14 
events in 14 subjects). 
In  single  dose  studies  11  subjects  experience  21  events.  The  most  frequently  reported  events  were 
diarrhoea  and  nausea.  Other  events  were  coded  as  abdominal distension,  abdominal  pain,  abdominal 
tenderness, eructation and  vomiting. All events occurred in higher telotristat etiprate dose groups, 2 in 
the 500 mg tid fasted or fed group, 4 in the 1000 mg group, and 5 in the 1500 mg tid group. All events 
were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity.  In  multiple-dose  studies,  20  subjects  with  telotristat  etiprate  at 
various doses experienced 30 events. The most frequently reported events were nausea, constipation, 
and abdominal pain. Other events were coded as abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, 
Assessment report  
EMA/508026/2017  
Page 123/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
diarrhoea,  flatulence,  gastrointestinal  pain,  infrequent  bowel  movements,  nausea,  and  vomiting.  All 
events were mild or moderate in intensity. In crossover studies 31 telotristat etiprate subjects at various 
doses  alone  or  in  combination  experienced  45  events  related  to  study  drug.  All  events  were  mild  or 
moderate in intensity. 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies 
In the placebo-controlled safety population, 95 patients experienced a total of 188 AESIs related to GI 
symptoms, 30 (42%) in placebo group, 33 (47%) in telotristat etiprate 250 mg tid, and 32 (46%) in 
telotristat etiprate 500 mg tid. The 188 events were coded to 18 PTs. The most frequently reported PTs 
were abdominal pain and nausea. 
Table 64:  Summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events of Special Interest Related to GI 
Symptoms by Treatment Group for Placebo-controlled Safety Patients (Studies LX301 and 
LX303) 
The time to onset, reported for 178 events, ranged from 1 day to approximately 3 months, and there was 
no apparent clustering. 15 of the 188 events were considered severe or serious by the Investigators, 5 
events in the placebo group, 6 in telotristat etiprate 250 mg tid, and 4 in telotristat etiprate 500 mg tid.  
In the overall safety population, 160 patients experienced a total of 552 AESIs related to GI symptoms. 
These 552 events include the 130 events reported for the 65 patients treated with telotristat etiprate in 
the placebo-controlled safety population, and the 26 events reported for the 13 patients receiving active 
treatment in Study LX202. The 396 AESIs related to GI symptoms reported for patients with CS while 
they were taking Open-Label telotristat etiprate occurred in 128 patients, 16 in Study LX202, 12 in Study 
LX203, 71 in Study LX301, and 29 in Study LX303. 
Because  telotristat  etiprate  reduces  bowel  movement  frequency,  TEAEs  coded  to  constipation  and 
fecaloma were closely monitored. In the Placebo-controlled Safety analyses, 2 (3%), 4 (6%) and 5 (7%) 
patients  in  the  placebo,  telotristat  etiprate  250  mg  tid,  and  telotristat  etiprate  500  mg  tid  treatment 
groups experienced constipation, respectively; there was no report of fecaloma; the one case of ileus was 
reported in the placebo group. In the overall safety analyses, 28 (12%) patients experienced constipation 
and 2 (1%) patients experienced fecaloma. 
Assessment report  
EMA/508026/2017  
Page 124/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Three of the patients experienced constipation that was reported as SAEs and 2 fecaloma. Additionally, 1 
(0.4%) patient experienced small intestinal obstruction, and 1 (0.4%) patient each experienced ileus, 
intestinal obstruction and subileus (the same patient as one of the patients experiencing fecaloma), which 
were reported as SAEs. 
The incidence of constipation tended to increase with increasing dose.  
Depression  
Phase 1 Studies 
There were no depression-related AESIs reported for any of the Phase 1 study groups. 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies 
No AESI related to depression was identified. 
A summary of the TEAEs related to depression are presented.

Of the 117 events reported in the overall safety analysis only 23 were assessed as related by the 
Investigator, of which 3 were for anxiety, 1 each for memory impairment, confusional state, and 
emotional disorder, 6 for insomnia, 2 for sleep disorder, and 9 for dizziness.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The total number of death in all clinical trials was 19.  
In the placebo-controlled safety analysis, the overall incidences of TEAEs leading to death were: 3 (4.2%) 
patients on placebo (unrelated to treatment), 1 (1.4%) patient on telotristat etiprate 250 mg tid 
(unrelated to treatment) and 1 (1.4%) patient on telotristat etiprate 500 mg tid. The patient in Study 
LX301, randomised to telotristat etiprate 500 mg tid, died of cardiac arrest on study Day 13. A CT scan 27 
days prior to randomization showed progressive disease (worsening peritoneal carcinomatosis, increased 
metastatic disease at lung bases and abdominal wall, and increased metastatic lymphadenopathy in 
bilateral inguinal & external iliac lymph nodes).  
A patient originally enrolled in Study LX203, died of acute liver failure on study Day 483 after enrolling in 
the extension study (Study LX302). At the time of the event, he had taken telotristat etiprate for 
approximately 3 years and 10 months across both studies. Approximately 1 month prior to death, the 
patient had experienced SAEs of (increasing) diarrhoea, increased blood creatinine, and general physical 
health deterioration. The patient had underlying metastatic NET with extensive liver metastasis (80% 
replacement) and preexisting liver fibrosis possibly due to alcohol. Laboratory results near the time of 
death did not suggest drug induced liver injury (DILI).  
In the overall safety analysis, a total of 16 patients experienced TEAEs that resulted in death (10 males, 
6 females); these 16 patients included 2 patients on active treatment in the Placebo controlled Safety 
analysis. Fourteen of the 16 deaths were reported as not related to study drug. 
Two deaths occurred during the screening period of Study LX301; neither patient received study drug. 
In the updated Overall Safety analysis, a total of 21 patients experienced TEAEs that resulted in death (15 
males, 6 females); these 21 patients included 2 patients on active treatment in the Placebo controlled 
Safety analysis.

Laboratory findings 
Elevations in ALT >3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2 ULN have been reported in patients 
receiving therapy with telotristat, most cases being reported at a higher dose (500 mg). These have not 
been associated with concomitant elevations in total serum bilirubin. The increases were largely 
reversible on dose interruption or reduction, or recovered whilst maintaining treatment at the same dose. 
For clinical management of elevated hepatic enzymes, see section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Hepatic Enzyme AESIs in Placebo-Controlled Safety Population 
In the Placebo-controlled Safety population, a total of 28 AESIs related to hepatic enzyme abnormalities 
were  reported  by  the  Investigators  in  18  patients,  all  in  the  active  treatment  groups,  10  (14%)  in 
telotristat etiprate 250 mg tid and 8 (11%) in telotristat etiprate 500 mg tid (Table 73). Fourteen of the 
patients were in Study LX301 and 4 in Study LX303. 
Ten of the patients were male and 8 were female, with an age range of 45 to 74 years. 
The 28 events were coded to PTs of ALT increased, AST increased, blood ALP increased, blood bilirubin 
increased, GGT, GGT increased, hepatic enzyme increased and liver function test abnormal. The most 
frequently reported PT was GGT increased (11 events in 10 patients, 5 patients each in the telotristat 
etiprate 250 mg tid and 500 mg tid groups), followed by ALT increased (6 events in 5 patients, 2 patients 
[3%] in the telotristat etiprate 250 mg tid group and 3 patients [4%] in the telotristat etiprate 500 mg tid 
group).

Table 73: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events of Special Interest Related to Hepatic Enzyme 
Abnormality by Treatment Group for Placebo-controlled Safety Patients (Studies LX301 and 
LX303) 
Twenty of the 28 events were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug (10 
events each in the telotristat etiprate 250 mg tid and 500 mg tid groups). 
Three of the 28 events were considered severe by the Investigators. The remaining events were mild or 
moderate in intensity. None of the 28 events were reported as serious. The 3 severe events occurred in 
2 patients: a patient in the telotristat etiprate 250 mg tid group experienced GGT increased, another 
patient in the telotristat etiprate 500 mg tid group experienced ALT and AST increased; both patients 
were enrolled in Study LX301. 
No action was taken with study drug for 22 events; 16 resolved and 6 did not resolve. The dose of the 
study drug was reduced for 2 events; both resolved. Study drug was interrupted for 3 events; 2 resolved 
and 1 did not resolve. Study drug was discontinued for one event, GGT increased; the event also led to 
study withdrawal  and the event did not resolve. 
Hepatic Enzyme AESIs in Overall Safety Population 
This section is focused on the 50 AESIs related to hepatic enzymes abnormality reported for 22 patients 
with CS while they were taking Open-Label telotristat etiprate.. 
These 50 events were coded to PTs of alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase 
increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, blood bilirubin increased, gamma-glutamyltransferase 
increased, hepatic enzyme increased, liver function test abnormal, and transaminases increased. The 
most frequently reported PT was gammaglutamyltransferase increased (13 events in 12 patients), 
followed by Blood alkaline phosphatase increased (11 events in 8 patients).  
One of the 50 events (transaminases increased) was reported as an SAE. One patient in Study LX301 was 
randomised to telotristat etiprate 250 mg tid during the 12-week DBT Period of the study and then took 
500 mg tid during the OLE period. All LTs were normal at Baseline. The patient was hospitalised 28 days 
after starting telotristat etiprate 500 mg tid for abdominal pain and nausea and local laboratory values at 
hospital showed an increase in ALT greater than 10xULN, with normal bilirubin. The treating physician 
suspected an idiosyncratic reaction to the study drug and interrupted the treatment. Liver tests returned

to normal. Study drug was resumed 3 weeks later at a reduced dose of 250 mg tid and finally increased 
to 500 mg tid 15 days later. ALT increased again but less than 3 x ULN. The ALT fluctuated from normal 
to high, but remained <3 x ULN. The case was considered as a hepatocellular DILI (possibly related). 
Haematology 
Some patient level abnormalities were observed for the haematology parameters, but the changes in 
mean values were minimal. 
Biochemistry 
Laboratory data on biochemical parameters were integrated for ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, total bilirubin, 
creatinine clearance, creatinine, albumin, protein, glucose, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, calcium, 
phosphate, potassium, sodium, and urate.  
There were no clinically significant trends in biochemical parameters with the exception of hepatic enzyme 
test results and lipid levels. Mean changes in serum cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglycerides values 
indicate that telotristat etiprate-treated patients’ lipid levels may be slightly increased. 
Urine analysis 
This included the measurement of urine protein only. Mean changes were usually not clinically relevant, 
and the shifts observed occurred in both directions without consistent patterns. There were not clinically 
significant trends. 
Vital signs, physical findings and other observations related to safety 
For all vital sign parameters (diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, 
body temperature, and weight), mean values were generally stable, and mean changes from Baseline in 
were relatively small. For all electrocardiogram parameters (heart rate, PR duration, QRS duration, QT 
duration, QT interval, and QTcF), mean changes from Baseline were relatively small. A few patients in 
Phase 3 studies had QTc and/or QTcF values >500 msec or >60 msec increase in QTcF values while being 
treated with telotristat etiprate (3 patients on 500 mg tid had QTcF changes of >60 msec, and 1 on 
placebo, and 1 on 500 mg tid and 2 on placebo had QTcF >500 msec).

Renal impairment 
In the overall safety analysis, similar incidences of TEAEs occurred for each renal impairment subgroup 
for all SOCs, with the largest difference being in Investigations, where the severe renal impairment group 
had  a  higher  incidence  (56%)  compared  to  those  with  mild  (36%)  and  moderate  (26%)  impairment. 
However, there were only 9 patients in the severe renal impairment group. 
Table 74: Summary of Patients with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events for Overall Safety 
Patients by Renal Impairment Category (Studies LX202, LX203, LX301, LX302 and LX303) 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with hepatic impairment were identified using the hepatic failure, fibrosis, cirrhosis and other 
liver damage-related conditions SMQ. A total of 42  patients in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies were 
identified as having hepatic disease or impairment with an exposure of 32.9 patient-years. 
In the overall safety analysis, of the patients with hepatic impairment using the criteria above, 39 patients 
(93%) had at least 1 TEAE. This incidence is similar to that of the overal population (95%).  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions has not been evaluated based on data from the phase 2/3 trials, 
but for the phase I DDI studies only. At request, the applicant has additionally analysed the phase 2/3 
data for DDIs with the concomitant intake of CNS medication, cardiovascular medication, and potentially 
hepatotoxic medication, which did not give clear hints for the increase of adverse events with 
co-administration of these compounds (data not shown).   
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The following tables show the incidence of premature discontinuation due to AEs and also include 
temporary interruptions of the intake of the study drug as discontinuations.

Post marketing experience 
The applicant did not submit post marketing data as telotristat etiprate had not been approved for 
marketing. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of telotristat was based on the treatment of a total of 239 patients with carcinoid syndrome, 58 
patients with ulcerative colitis, and 259 subjects receiving the compound in early drug development. In 
total, 170 CS-patients have been exposed for at least 24 weeks, and 111 have been exposed for at least 
48 weeks. 
While the number of patients included into the development programme reflects the low incidence and 
prevalence of the disease (and the orphan status of the product), the number of patients included into the 
safety analysis is considered to be too small to detect rare events. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with telotristat were abdominal pain 
(26%), gamma-glutamyl transferase increased (11%) and fatigue (10%). They were generally of mild or 
moderate intensity. The most frequently reported adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of 
Assessment report  
EMA/508026/2017  
Page 135/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
telotristat was abdominal pain in 7.1% of patients (5/70).  Two of these ADRs (abdominal pain and 
increased GGT) were also the most frequent reasons for discontinuations during the trials. 
In the evaluation of the double-blind data, the most common AEs occurred in the SOCs gastrointestinal 
disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions, infections and infestations, nervous 
system disorders, metabolism and nutrition disorders, investigations, musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue disorders, and psychiatric disorders, whereas the most common single AEs (PT) occurred for 
nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, decreased appetite, abdominal pain upper, depression, and diarrhoea. 
The most frequently observed treatment related events occurring at higher frequencies in any of the 
active treatment groups were: Nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, fatigue, decreased appetite, GGT 
increased, vomiting, abdominal distension, and flatulence. Based on this evaluation, the conclusion that 
the compound mainly has adverse effects in the gastrointestinal tract appears to be justified. 
The double-blind treatment with the compound was not associated with a higher incidence of death in the 
patient population included. In total 21/239 patients died during the duration of the trials reflecting the 
disease burden of the patients included. 
The incidence of serious adverse events was generally low, and was overall lower in the active treatment 
groups compared to placebo and the assessment of the causative association of single SAEs was generally 
hampered by the overall low incidence (as a consequence of the underlying low patient numbers).  
The treatment with telotristat etiprate did generally not have a relevant influence on laboratory findings 
from haematology or biochemistry, or on vital signs and physical findings. However, increases (compared 
to placebo where no increase or even a decrease was noted) of lipid levels (cholesterol, triglycerides) and 
of hepatic enzymes were noted during the treatment with the compound. Whereas the changes in lipid 
parameters are  considered not clinically relevant, the increase in hepatic enzymes has also led to an 
increased reporting of elevated liver enzymes as TEAEs. Most of these increases were mild to moderate in 
magnitude, only a few had higher increases and these were partially associated with disease progression 
in patients with pre-existing liver metastases, and/or their treatment. Hence, hepatic enzyme increase 
has been included as an important identified risk in the RMP and warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC and 
has been described in SmPC 4.8. For the double-blind as well as the extension treatment phases, despite 
several cases with high elevations of transaminases and/or ALP and also single cases of relevant bilirubin 
increases were found, no case complying with the Hy’s law criteria was detected. During the long-term 
extension phases, the number of patients experiencing such elevations appeared to be increased, most 
likely to the disease progression in patients with liver metastases.  
The applicant has additionally evaluated so-called adverse events of special interest (AESIs) with regards 
to depression related events, neuropsychiatric events, liver injury events, and gastrointestinal events. 
The two CNS-related categories were evaluated due to the theoretical potential of a compound inhibiting 
serotonin metabolism on mood-related and cognitive CNS processes. No clear conclusion was possible 
with regards to the depression related events and the neuropsychiatric events, where no clear conclusion 
on relatedness could be drawn. Overall, it can, however, be preliminarily concluded, especially for the low 
dose proposed for licensing, that adverse events with regard to mood and neuropsychiatric effects may be 
caused by the treatment . Therefore, depression and other depression-related events are included in the 
RMP as important potential risks and a warning included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
From the separate evaluation of GI events it has been shown that the overall rate of GI associated AEs is 
higher in the active treatment groups than in the placebo group during the double-blind treatment period, 
confirming that the adverse event profile is mainly restricted to events in the GI tract.

The causation of complications of constipation, such as faecaloma and ileus remains largely unresolved 
due to the small numbers involved into the studies but remains a potential concern. Therefore, 
constipation due to decreased GI motility has been identified as an important identified risk and 
faecaloma and intestinal obstruction have been included as important potential risks in the RMP. A 
warning about constipation included in the SmPC section 4.4. 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use adequate contraception during treatment with 
telotristat. 
It is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients 
listed in section 6.1. 
Xermelo contains anhydrous lactose as an excipient. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this 
medicinal product 
Telotristat has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue may occur following 
administration of telotristat (see SmPC section 4.7). 
There is limited clinical experience with telotristat overdose in humans. Gastro-intestinal disorders 
including nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and vomiting have been reported in healthy subjects taking 
a single dose of 1,500 mg in a phase 1 study.  Treatment of an overdose should include general 
symptomatic management.(See section 4.9) 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety database is considered limited based on the low number of patients included as well as the 
limited exposure. However, the data shows a relatively benign overall adverse event/adverse drug 
reaction profile which is mainly restricted to symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract, such as nausea, 
abdominal pain, constipation, abdominal distension and flatulence. These events were mostly mild to 
moderate in intensity. No serious adverse reactions were identified, however, the safety database is too 
small to make any definitive conclusions. Long term safety will be collected and evaluated in the ongoing 
studies LX301, LX302 and LX303.

medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture 
of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Xermelo (telotristat ethyl) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Telotristat etiprate has been developed as an adjunct to somatostatin analogue (SSA) therapy for the 
long-term treatment of carcinoid syndrome (CS) to improve symptom control in adult patients with 
metastatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs).  
CS consists of symptoms of facial flushing, diarrhoea, and episodic abdominal pain. It is caused by kinins 
and serotonin secreted from NETs that arise from neuroendocrine cells found in almost all organs of the 
body, most commonly the gastrointestinal tract. Only 30 to 40% of NETs cause clinical syndromes; ileal 
neuroendocrine tumours most commonly cause CS. Over 95% of patients with CS have metastatic 
disease. Hormones secreted by the primary tumour are metabolised by the liver and so do not cause 
symptoms, but symptoms may develop with liver metastases, as these release hormones that bypass the 
enterohepatic circulation and enter the systemic circulation.

Telotristat etiprate, which inhibits tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), the rate limiting enzyme in the 
biosynthesis of serotonin, is expected to relieve CS symptoms.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Radical resection of NET is the initial approach and may be curative. At later stages, cytoreductive surgery 
including tumour resection and radiofrequency ablation may be used in an effort to control clinical 
symptoms and enhance patient survival. However, most of the therapeutic options currently available for 
the treatment of NETs address control of symptoms. 
SSAs (octreotide and lanreotide) are authorised for the control of symptoms of the condition in the 
Community. Both compounds are only approved for the relief of symptoms and not for their capability to 
regress tumour growth. In addition, ketanserin, ondansetron, methysergide, and cyproheptadine reduce 
effects of serotonin or act as serotonin antagonists. Methysergide maleate is approved in some countries 
for diarrhoea caused by CS. 
There are also authorised products for the treatment of diarrhoea, abdominal cramp, and flushing. 
However, there is an unmet medical need in patients with CS when tachyphylaxis on SSA therapy 
develops, or hepatic tumour load increases. Options are to increase the dose of long acting SSA, to use 
rescue short acting octreotide injections, and to use antidiarrheal therapies to try to reduce symptoms of 
CS.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal phase 3 trial, Study LX301, was a randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
multicentre, double-blind study in patients with CS not adequately controlled by SSA therapy 
investigating oral doses of 250 mg tid and 500 mg tid of telotristat etiprate versus placebo.  
Patients were required to have histopathologically confirmed, well-differentiated, metastatic NET with 
extent documented by CT, MRI, or radionuclide imaging, documented history of CS, and experiencing an 
average of ≥4 BMs/day during run-in.  
The primary objective was to compare both groups of telotristat etiprate with placebo on reducing the 
number of BMs per day from baseline averaged over the 12-week double-blind treatment period in 
patients not adequately controlled by SSA therapy. The main secondary objectives were the effects of 
telotristat etiprate versus placebo on change in u5-HIAA levels, in the daily number of cutaneous flushing 
episodes, and abdominal pain. 
The ITT and safety populations analysed consisted of 45 patients per group after exclusion of 1 patient in 
the telotristat etiprate 500 mg group who was randomised twice.  
In a phase 3 study of similar design, Study LX303, a total of 76 patients were evaluated for efficacy. All 
patients had well-differentiated metastatic neuroendocrine tumour with CS. Most patients had fewer than 
4 BM per day, and all except 9 were treated by SSA therapy. 
The primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline in u5-HIAA at week 12. The mean change 
from baseline is daily BM averaged over 12 weeks was assessed as a secondary endpoint.

EMA/508026/2017  
Page 143/148 
 
 
 
 
 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The number of BMs per day was statistically significantly reduced. The primary study endpoint in trial 
LX301, change from baseline averaged over the 12-week double-blind treatment period in the number of 
BMs per day, met the predefined criteria in both telotristat etiprate groups (250 mg, 500 mg). The 
estimates of the treatment differences (Hodges-Lehmann) were about ˗0.8 BMs/day (97.5% CI: ˗1.256, 
˗0.290) for telotristat etiprate 250 mg and -0.7 BMs/day (97.5% CI: ˗1.170, ˗0.223) for telotristat etiprate 
500 mg from a baseline of about 5 to 6 BMs/day. Supplemental and sensitivity analyses were generally in 
line with these findings. 
The mechanistically important biomarker urinary 5-HIAA (secondary endpoint) indicated a clear effect. 
The estimates of the treatment differences of telotristat etiprate versus placebo (Hodges-Lehmann) for 
the change from baseline in urinary 5-HIAA levels at week 12 were about -30 mg per 24 hours (97.5% CI: 
˗56.000, ˗8.100) for telotristat etiprate 250 mg and about -34 (97.5% CI: ˗66.200, ˗14.600) for 500 mg.  
Based on the criterion of a ≥30% reduction in number of BMs per day for ≥50% of time, durability of 
effect of telotristat etiprate on BMs per day in the target population has been shown, with a reduction in 
about 42%, 44%, and 20% of patients on telotristat etiprate 500 mg, 250 mg, and placebo, respectively.  
In line with findings on change in BMs per day, patients on telotristat etiprate had a smaller proportion of 
days with urgency to defecate compared to placebo; mean proportions of days with urgency to defecate 
were about 0.60, 0.67, and 0.75 for telotristat etiprate 500 mg, 250 mg, and placebo, respectively. 
In the assessment of the patient’s view on the benefit of treatment on CS symptoms (exit interview 
substudy) interviewed patients described a high BM frequency as the most important symptom of CS. 
About one-third of patients in the substudy noted a reduction in BM frequency and the majority of these 
patients described it as meaningful.  
Reductions in the frequency of mean BMs per day and in the urinary excretion of 5-HIAA were generally 
maintained during the open-label extension period and patients previously on placebo showed reductions 
similar to those on telotristat etiprate in the double-blind period. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Post-hoc sub group analyses to evaluate the potential effect of concomitant medications (especially 
antidiarrhoeals and opioids) were requested to the Applicant. The concomitant medication appears to 
favour the treatment effect reported but the BM reduction figures do not show any large and consistent 
differences between users and non-users of concomitant medication. The responder analysis shows that 
in non-users of antidiarrhoeals there were 23% of responders in the placebo group and 36% of 
responders in the telotristat 250 mg group; thus only 13% of patients benefited from the treatment. 
Results from a pooled analysis of data from the phase III studies LX301 and LX303 are in accordance with 
the previously reported data, i.e. responder rates between patients who used antidiarrhoeals or opioids 
were in the similar extent which was reported for study LX301 in the previous response document. In 
patients who used antidiarrhoeals or opioids there was an absolute difference between telotristat 250 mg 
and placebo that was higher than in patients who did not use these concomitant medications, but a higher 
effect of telotristat 250 mg compared to placebo was demonstrated in both groups irrespective of the use 
of these concomitant medications.  
Although the treatment effect is considered lower than expected, nevertheless some patients do benefit 
from the symptomatic treatment. Based on the subgroup analyses, no particular patient population could 
be ascertained that would identify responder patients vs non-responder patients to the treatment. Hence, 
Assessment report  
EMA/508026/2017  
Page 144/148 
 
 
 
 
 
a statement was included in the SmPC section 4.2 that available data suggest that clinical response is 
usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment and it is recommended to reassess the benefit of continued 
therapy in a patient not responding within this time period. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most frequent adverse reactions were related to the gastrointestinal tract, which affects about 50% 
of the treated population. Symptoms representing these unfavourable effect include abdominal pain and 
distension, including flatulence and constipation, which occur from about 5% (constipation), up to slightly 
more than 20% of the patient population (abdominal pain  abdominal distension, flatulence) within three 
months of treatment. 
Further unfavourable effects occurring at high frequency include headaches (7.1% ; 5/70)but the overall 
incidence of these events was not or only slightly increased by treatment with telotristat etiprate. 
Abnormalities in liver enzymes (11.4% (8/70) for GGT in the 12-week placebo-controlled safety 
population; more than  10% in long-term, up to 5% for transaminases) were usually not symptomatic and 
not associated with increases in bilirubin. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Due to its mechanism of action, telotristat etiprate has the potential to cause CNS effects, including 
effects on mood and causation of depressive symptoms. There is currently no sign that telotristat etiprate 
may have an effect on depressive or other neuropsychiatric symptoms. No differences in occurrence rates 
in comparison to placebo were identified although a couple of cases with mild depressive symptoms and 
single cases with even major depressive disorder could be identified. After analysis of the cases with 
positive de-challenge, only one case remains to be suspicious of a causal association. Based on this 
number a final conclusion is not possible, but the 1 case in 239 patients could indicate a relevant 
association which might only become evident with higher numbers of patients being exposed. Therefore, 
depression and other depression-related events are included in the RMP as important potential risks. 
Although the overall evaluation of the liver enzyme abnormalities has shown that the changes are 
transient and usually not accompanied by a concomitant increase in bilirubin, no final conclusion on 
hepatic safety can be drawn. Although no case of severe DILI complying with Hy’s law has been detected, 
the observed increases might indicate a potential for liver injury with the compound which might become 
apparent with higher number of patients exposed only. Therefore, hepatic enzyme increase has been 
included as an important identified risk in the RMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
CS refers to an array of symptoms that occurs secondary to NETs; it is a serious condition impacting daily 
functioning of patients.  
The clinical benefit of telotristat etiprate has been demonstrated by a decrease in BM of approximately 1 
BM/day, although the net effect size of BM is low. In exit interviews study participants described a high BM 
frequency as the most important symptom of CS which impacted their daily life. There is no clinically 
relevant effect of telotristat on other symptoms of CS. 
The adverse event profile of the compound shows an AE profile that is overall mild and manageable and 
mainly affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Overall, the unfavourable GI ADRs appear to be transient and 
benign in nature, in their vast majority non-serious, and do not lead to a discontinuation of the treatment. 
Although the safety database is considered still small with few treated patients, there are currently no 
major concerns with the changes in liver enzymes observed as well as the potential effects on the CNS.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A clinical benefit of telotristat etiprate in adult patients with carcinoid syndrome who are inadequately 
controlled by SSA therapy has been demonstrated and outweighs  the safety risks which are considered 
mild and manageable with the recommendations and warnings in the SmPC.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Further analyses of the available data together with relevant literature did not identify a subgroup of 
patients that might benefit most from a treatment with telotristat etiprate. Thus, the recommendation in 
SmPC section 4.2 has been included to inform the healthcare professional to continue treatment only in 
those patients who are assessed as responders after 12 weeks of treatment. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Xermelo is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Xermelo is favourable in the following indication: 
Xermelo is indicated for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome diarrhoea in combination with somatostatin 
analogue (SSA) therapy in adults inadequately controlled by SSA therapy. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
These conditions fully reflect the advice received from the PRAC.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that telotristat is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The Applicant Laboratoires CTRS submitted on 30 October 2009 an application for Marketing 
Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Orphacol, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 29 September 2008.  
Orphacol was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/02/127 on 18 December 2002 in the 
following indication: treatment of inborn errors in primary bile acid synthesis. The calculated 
prevalence of this condition was 0.06 per 10,000 EEA population. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Orphacol as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. The outcome of the COMP review can be found on the Agency's 
website: ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human medicines/Rare disease designations. 
The Applicant applied for the following indications: treatment of inborn errors in primary bile acid 
synthesis due to 3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency or Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-
reductase deficiency in infants, children and adolescents aged 1 month to 18 years and adults. 
The legal basis for this application refers to: 
Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/83/EC – well established use application. The application submitted is 
composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and clinical data based on

3.  Scientific discussion 
3.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Orphacol is for use in the treatment of inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis due to 3β-HSD 
deficiency or Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency. Both deficiencies are extremely rare genetic disorders and cholic 
acid has been granted orphan medicinal product status pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 for 
the treatment of inborn errors in primary bile acid synthesis (EU/3/02/127) with a calculated 
prevalence of 0.06 per 10,000 EEA population.  
In each of these two deficiencies, primary bile acid synthesis is absent or markedly impaired. 
Cholestasis and liver injury are the results of failure to synthesise adequate amounts of normal primary 
bile acids, associated with increased production of unusual primitive hepatotoxic and cholestatic bile 
acid metabolites (Clayton et al. 1987; Stieger et al. 1997). The liver disease associated with 3β-HSD 
and ∆4-3-oxoR deficiencies due to the production of hepatotoxic bile acid precursors is progressive and, 
if untreated, leads to death due to cirrhosis and liver failure. The only therapeutic option in severely 
affected cases is liver transplant. Currently there is no causal treatment. Treatment is limited to 
correcting the biochemical abnormalities, including the administration of bile acids and vitamin 
preparations. No medicinal product containing cholic acid as sole active substance has a marketing 
authorisation in the EU. 
Oral administration of cholic acid, the substance missing in affected patients, inhibits the production of 
the hepatotoxic bile acid precursors by down-regulating cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the rate limiting 
enzyme in bile acid synthesis (Setchell and O’Connell 2007). In addition, it provides a stimulus for bile 
flow facilitating the hepatic clearance of toxic bile acid precursors and toxic substances, including 
bilirubin. It also improves growth by facilitating the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and fat.  
About the product 
The active substance of Orphacol is cholic acid. Cholic acid is a primary bile acid. Primary bile acids are 
biosynthesised in the liver and are key constituents of normal bile. The two primary bile acids 
synthesised by the liver, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, serve several important physiological 
functions (Setchell and O’Connell 2007). Cholic acid is the predominant primary bile acid in bile. It 
represents between approximately half and two thirds of the primary bile acids produced in adult. In 
addition to facilitating fat absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and to participating in the 
regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, the primary bile acids provide the major driving force for the 
promotion and secretion of bile. They are essential to the development of the enterohepatic circulation, 
which is necessary for the elimination of toxic endogenous or exogenous substances. 
Cholic acid 50 and 250 mg capsules have been distributed in France from 1993 to October 2007 as a 
“préparation hospitalière” (hospital preparation). This preparation was used to treat a cohort of 
patients described by the Jacquemin group (Jacquemin et al. 2000; Potin et al. 2001; Gonzales et al. 
2004; Gonzales et al. 2009). During this period, the Bicêtre Hospital pharmacy first and then the 
Agence Générale des Équipements et Produits de Santé - Établissement Pharmaceutique des Hôpitaux 
de Paris (AGEPS-EPHP) were successively both manufacturing site and batch release site of the 
finished product. Since October 2007, Laboratoires CTRS supplies cholic acid 50 and 250 mg capsules 
with the same composition and specifications as Named-Patient Compassionate Use in France under 
the invented name Orphacol. The Compassionate Use was authorised by the French National 
Assessment report  
EMA/596651/2013  
Page 10/74 
 
 
 
 
Competent Authority (Afssaps) in October 2007. As of October 2009, 19 patients, aged from a few 
months to 28 years old, affected by 3β-HSD deficiency (17 patients) or Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency (2 
patients) are undergoing treatment with Orphacol. Three patients are EU residents but are receiving 
care through Bicêtre Hospital. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
In accordance with Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended the application relies on well 
established medicinal use supported by bibliographic literature. According to Article 10a of Directive 
2001/83/EC, as amended it is possible to replace results of pre-clinical and clinical trials by detailed 
references to published scientific literature (information available in the public domain) if it can be 
demonstrated that the active substance of a medicinal product has been in well-established medicinal 
use within the Community for at least 10 years, with a recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of 
safety. In this regard, the provisions of Annex I (Part II.1) to Directive 2001/83/EC shall apply. 
The requirements of article 10a application are discussed below: 
a) Factors which have been taken into account by the CHMP in order to establish a well-established use 
- Time over which the substance has been used 
This medicine has been used for these indications for over 10 years. In this application, the Applicant 
refers more than 30 publications dating back to 1987. The CHMP confirms that the requirement of an 
expiry of not less than one decade from the first systematic use of cholic acid in this condition in the 
EU is fulfilled. In this context, the CHMP takes duly account of the prevalence of the condition. The 
literature provided by the applicant showed that, where available to investigators, the clinical use of 
cholic acid has been documented since at least the mid-1990s through the work primarily conducted 
by the Jacquemin, Clayton and Setchell groups. The outcome for 22 identifiable 3β-HSD and Δ4-3-oxoR 
deficiency patients treated with cholic acid has been presented. This patient population represents all 
patients who are reported in the literature at the time of the application submission. In view of the 
prevalence of the condition, it is considered that this reported population represents a substantial and 
relevant proportion of the overall estimated population in the EU. Therefore, cholic acid has extensively 
been used for the claimed therapeutic use in this condition.  
- Quantitative aspects of use of the substance 
As this is an orphan medicinal product for a rare condition the number of patients using the medicine is 
low. This is accepted by the CHMP. It should be noted that cholic acid an endogenous substance and is 
used in foods as a food additive (E 1000) in low concentrations. Historically medicinal products 
containing cholic acid have been used for other indications, such as laxatives and choleretics since the 
at least the early part of the 20th century.  The CHMP considers that this requirement is fulfilled. 
- The degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance (reflected in the published scientific 
literature)  
The Applicant has provided details of an adequate number of articles to fulfil this requirement. Of the 
33 articles supporting this application on the treatment of inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis, 
18 articles are concerned with 3β-HSD deficiency and 8 concerned Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency; 7 papers 
presented data for both indications.  
- Coherence of scientific assessments 
The literature provides a consistent view that cholic acid is the treatment of choice. Where available to 
investigators, its clinical use has been documented since at least the mid-1990s and its use can 
Assessment report  
EMA/596651/2013  
Page 11/74 
 
 
 
 
therefore be considered as well-established. Overall there is coherence in the literature reviewed and 
analysed. 
The CHMP therefore concludes that within the recognised limitation of an extremely rare and life-
threatening condition that more than ten years have elapsed since the first systematic and 
documented use of cholic acid in the EU. The conclusion on systematic use takes into consideration the 
relevant proportion of patients covered by the presented data compared to the overall population 
affected by this condition, the consistency amongst the case reports, the representativeness of the 
patients for the overall patient population, as well as the duration over which such use has occurred. 
Therefore, despite the numbers are limited, it is the view of the CHMP that they are a reflection of the 
overall population, in which the applied product has systematically been used; hence the use of cholic 
acid can therefore be considered as well-established in the claimed indications. 
b) The CHMP considers that the documentation submitted by the Applicant has covered all aspects of 
the quality, safety and efficacy and includes review of the relevant literature. The documentation, both 
favourable and unfavourable have been communicated.   
c) Due to the rarity of the disease particular attention has been paid to any missing information and 
the CHMP considers that adequate justifications have been provided by the applicant, which 
demonstrate that an acceptable level of safety and efficacy can be supported although some studies 
are lacking. 
d) The Applicant explained the relevance of data submitted concerning the product reviewed in the 
literature being different from the product intended for marketing. A judgement has been made that 
the product studied in the literature can be considered similar to the product intended for marketing. 
The formulations used are not always stated in the publications. A significant number of subjects were 
given capsules made at AGEPS (the French Hospital manufacturing facility). The formulation of the 
AGEPS product (qualitatively the same but with slight quantitative differences) was considered to be 
similar to the CRID Pharma product intended for marketing. 
e) There is post-marketing experience with this active substance as this product has been used in 
patients for a number of years. It is noted that the medicinal product subject to this application is 
licenced for compassionate use since 2007 in France.  
In accordance with Article 22 of Directive 2001/83/EC, Article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 
and Annex I, part II of the Directive 2001/83/EC the Applicant applied for a marketing authorisation 
under exceptional circumstances. The Applicant justified that he was unable to provide comprehensive 
data on the efficacy and safety under normal condition of use because the indications for which 
Orphacol are intended are encountered so rarely that he cannot reasonably be expected to provide 
comprehensive evidence. It would also be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to 
collect such information. The Applicant proposed as specific obligation to monitor the clinical safety and 
efficacy of cholic acid in the treatment of 3β-HSD deficiency or Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency by establishing a 
patient surveillance database.

solution in water at 20 °C has a pH of 4.4. The substance is not hygroscopic unlike its sodium salt 
(sodium cholate). Cholic acid has a melting point of approximately 200 °C and is very heat stable.  
Sufficient evidence was provided to prove that only one crystal form is obtained by the utilised 
manufacturing process. 
Manufacture 
Information about manufacturing process of cholic acid has been provided using Active Substance 
Master File (ASMF) procedure.  
Cholic acid is manufactured using bovine and ovine bile as a source material. The safety of the bile 
with regard to TSE is assured by the EDQM Certificate of Suitability. The Applicant’s documentation 
included details on slaughter, collection processes, geographical sourcing, and traceability. Bile is 
supplied as either liquid bile or concentrated bile. Specifications for these starting materials have been 
provided. 
Bile acids sourced from ox and sheep are rich in cholic acid conjugated to amino acids taurine and 
glycine. The amino acids are removed from the cholic acid by hydrolysis under alkaline conditions. 
Purification by precipitation and solvent extraction then occurs, before crystallisation and milling. The 
manufacturing process has been well described. Critical parameters and accompanying in-process 
controls to ensure quality of the final compound have been defined. 
Confirmation of the chemical structure of cholic acid was provided by elemental analysis (confirmation 
of the determined elementary composition), UV, FTIR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, MS, X-ray powder diffraction

(XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). X-ray diffraction and DSC studies confirmed the 
morphology of cholic acid and absence of polymorphic forms. 
The particle size distribution of cholic acid is controlled by appropriate specification. 
Potential impurities have been well discussed in relation to their origin (raw material, manufacturing 
process and degradation products) and potential carry-over into the final drug substance. 
Specification 
The drug substance specification includes tests for physical appearance, identification (FTIR and HPLC), 
assay (HPLC), melting point, loss on drying, acidity, impurities (HPLC), residue on ignition, colour 
index, heavy metals, particle size distribution, residual solvents (GC) and microbiological purity (total 
aerobic microbiological count, yeasts and moulds, Escherichia coli). 
A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Some of the proposed methods are in 
accordance with the Ph Eur. Full method validation data was provided for the non compendial (in-
house) analytical methods. The HPLC method for identification, assay and impurities and GC method 
for residual solvents have been validated according to ICH Guideline Q3. 
Limits proposed for known and unknown impurities are acceptable and in line with the ICH guideline 
Q3A (R2). All impurities typically present in cholic acid at a level greater than 0.05% are reported and 
those typically present at a level greater than 0.10% have been identified. 
In general analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the drug substance. 
Data on 3 consecutive commercial scale batches of cholic acid were provided by the ASMF Holder. All 
batches complied with the requirements in the drug substance specification.  
Stability 
Three sets of stability studies have been performed. In the first set samples were stored at 25°C/65% 
RH, but were only tested annually not in line with ICH requirements. Therefore the second and third 
sets were performed according to ICH requirements (accelerated at 40°C/75% RH and long term at 
25°C/65% RH). Data are available for 72 months from set 1 and 6 months and 24 months from sets 2 
and 3 respectively. 
The following tests were performed: Appearance, identification by HPLC, loss on drying, assay, related 
impurities and colour index. The parameters tested are acceptable. 
The test methods are as described in section 3.2.S.4.2 except for assay which has been determined to 
date by area normalisation of the HPLC chromatogram as opposed to comparison with an external 
standard. Future testing is to be carried out by the external standard determination in addition to area 
normalisation. A comparison of the two methods has been provided and is acceptable. 
The stability studies demonstrated that the drug substance is stable and confirmed the proposed re-
test period. Furthermore, one batch of cholic acid per year will be added to the stability program, 
stored at 25°C ± 2°C, 60%RH ± 5% RH and tested annually. In accordance with EU GMP guidelines1, 
any confirmed out of specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the 
Rapporteur and the EMA.

3.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product  
Pharmaceutical Development 
The formulation is relatively simple and only limited information has been provided on pharmaceutical 
development. 
The aim of pharmaceutical development was to obtain capsules containing 50 mg or 250 mg of cholic 
acid when filled by adjustment to the volume of size 3 or size 0 capsules respectively. The particle size 
of the active substance was important for the volume adjustment of the powder in the empty capsule. 
As a consequence a particle size specification is set for lactose monohydrate and it is comparable to 
that of cholic acid. The active substance needs to be milled prior to use as a number of large particles 
were observed in unmilled active substance which could affect blend homogeneity. 
A number of blends of active substance and excipients were investigated and a final formulation which 
gave the required mean content was chosen for both strengths. 
The clinical batches of the product were not manufactured by the proposed manufacturer. Active 
substance from a different supplier was also used; however the batch manufactured by the current 
manufacturer and with active substance from the current supplier has been used for compassionate 
use up until now. A bridging study has been performed in order to confirm similar or higher quality of 
current batches compared with those used in trials. 
A suitable method for dissolution has been developed and validated for routine control of the finished 
product at release and shelf life. Specifications were defined and presented. A summary of the method 
and method validation have been provided. 
In addition, as for infants and children who cannot swallow capsules, Orphacol may be prepared as a 
suspension for oral administration, palatibility and compatibility of the formulation when mixed with 
some types of foods and drinks was investigated. This has been reflected in the SmPC.  
Adventitious agents 
Cholic acid is manufactured using bovine and ovine bile as a source material. The safety of the bile 
with regard to TSE is assured by the Ph Eur Certificate of Suitability. 
Among excipients used in the drug product only gelatin (component of the capsule shell) and lactose 
monohydrate (capsule filling) are of animal origin. For gelatin Ph Eur TSE Certificates of Suitability 
were provided. Declarations from lactose suppliers were provided stating that milk used for production 
of lactose is sourced from healthy animals under the same conditions as milk collected for human 
consumption. 
Magnesium stearate used in the formulation is of vegetal origin. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process is very simple consisting of premixing and mixing stages followed by 
lubrication and filling of capsules. The main parameters of importance are homogeneity of the final 
lubricated mix and homogeneity of the capsules, and validation of these parameters has been carried 
out during the product development. 
Assessment report  
EMA/596651/2013  
Page 15/74 
 
 
 
 
The manufacturing process validation will be performed on three production scale batches. As the 
utilised manufacturing process is considered standard at the time of submission only process validation 
protocol was provided, and this was considered acceptable. 
Product Specification 
The drug product specification at release includes tests for appearance, disintegration in water, mean 
mass, mass uniformity, identification, assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), dissolution and  microbiological 
testing (total aerobic viable count, yeasts and moulds, Escherichia Coli).  
The shelf life specification is the same as the release specification with the exception of the absence of 
uniformity of dosage units and a slight widening of the assay specification. 
Analytical methods have been sufficiently described, some of them are compendial methods described 
in the Ph Eur. Adequate validation data have been provided for non-compendial methods. 
The HPLC method for identification and assay of cholic acid has been validated for specificity, linearity, 
stability of solutions, accuracy and precision. 
The HPLC method for determination and assay of impurities has been validated for specificity, 
LOD/LOQ, linearity, stability of solutions, accuracy, precision. 
Batch analysis results on commercial scale batches of each strength of the drug product demonstrated 
compliance with the proposed specification and confirmed consistency and uniformity of the product. 
The results were consistent from batch to batch and proved that the product can be manufactured 
reproducibly according to the agreed specifications.  
Stability of the product 
Stability has been studied on four industrial scale batches of the finished product. All batches were 
packed in aluminium/PVC blisters, which is the container closure system proposed for the commercial 
product. 
Stability data were generated using the storage conditions listed in the ICH Guidance and contained 
results up to 24 months from long term storage at 25°C/60% RH, up to 12 months from storage under 
intermediate conditions at 30°C/65%RH, and 6 months from accelerated conditions at 40°C/75% RH.  
In addition stability data from forced degradation studies were provided. The following conditions were 
studies: acid degradation, basic degradation, oxidative degradation, light degradation, thermal 
degradation.  
The overall stability data showed that Orphacol is chemically, physically and microbiologically stable. 
The results generated during the stability studies and statistical analyses support the proposed shelf 
life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines2, any confirmed out of specification result, or significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA.

3.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The active substance, cholic acid, is a well-known and well-characterized ingredient. Information about 
manufacturing process of cholic acid has been provided using Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure. Cholic acid is manufactured using bovine and ovine bile as a source material and the safety 
of the bile with regard to TSE is assured by the EDQM Certificate of Suitability. ASMF Holder has a long 
experience in manufacture of cholic acid and has manufactured more than 10,000 batches of this 
substance. Its main use, up until now, has been as an intermediate in the production of 
ursodeoxycholic acid and dehydrocholic acid. 
In general analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the drug substance. 
The active is shown to be stable, even when stored at elevated temperatures.  
It is a hard gelatine capsule containing either 50 mg or 250 mg of the active substance.  
The description and composition of the product are properly documented.  
The drug product specification has been correctly discussed and the limits proposed for each test have 
been established taking into account the data of clinical and stability batches. In general, the 
specifications are acceptable.  
Analytical methods used to control the quality of the finished product are well described and validated 
according ICH.  
The results generated during the stability studies and statistical analyses support the proposed shelf 
life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. 
3.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The drug substance and the drug product have been appropriately characterised and overall 
satisfactory documentation has been provided. The results indicate that the drug substance and the 
drug product can be reproducibly manufactured and therefore the product should have a satisfactory 
and uniform performance in the clinic. 
3.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
3.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical data consists of literature references published from 1926 to 2009. Due to the 
bibliographic nature of this application and the date of origin of some of the submitted studies GLP 
aspects are not fully covered according to the present regulatory standards. This is however acceptable 
due to the accepted well established use of the product. 
3.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic  
Cholic acid is synthesised in the liver from cholesterol. It undergoes enterohepatic circulation, in which 
its principal functions include induction of bile flow; feedback inhibition of bile acid synthesis; 
modulation of cholesterol synthesis; elimination of cholesterol; and the facilitation of dispersion and 
absorption of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins through the formation of micelles (Setchell and O’Connell 
2007). The Applicant has conducted an extensive literature review for the pharmacology of cholic acid. 
Assessment report  
EMA/596651/2013  
Page 17/74 
 
 
 
 
The effects of cholic acid on the metabolism and secretion of bile acids are well known. Metabolism of 
bile acids is tightly controlled via a negative feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis. All referenced 
studies are academic. The cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP7A1 (cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase) and 
CYP8B1 (sterol 12α-hydroxylase) that are involved in bile acid synthesis are regulated by negative 
feedback from bile acids such as cholic acid (Li-Hawkins et al. 2002; Murphy et al. 2005; Shea et al. 
2007). This action is mediated through the activation of the nuclear bile acid receptor FXR which is 
turn induces the expression of SHP transcriptional repressor. SHP negatively interacts with other 
transcription factors; LHR-1 and HNF-4 α which in turn bind to the promoter region of the CYP7A1 and 
CYP8B1 gene, thus repressing primary bile acid synthesis (Goodwin et al. 2000; Lu et al. 2000; 
Brendel et al. 2002). 
Mice deficient in HSD3β7 (the homolog of the human gene coding for 3β-HSD), saw survival rates 
increase after feeding with cholic acid and vitamin supplements (Shea et al. 2007). The 3-hydroxyl 
group conferred by HSD3β7 is required to maintain the functional and regulatory properties of bile 
acids in mice, and this is similarly required in humans. 3β,7α-dihydroxy-5-cholenoyltaurine (present in 
3β-HSD deficiency) and 7α-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoyltaurine (present in Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency) are 
strong inhibitors of the canalicular, ATP-dependent bile acid transporter, BSEP. Patients with inborn 
errors such as 3β-HSD or Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency experience cholestasis as a result of inhibition of BSEP. 
BSEP expression can be up-regulated following addition of cholic acid.  
No specific animal models addressing a Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency have been found.  
It can be concluded that mutations in the 3β-HSD and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase models have very 
similar phenotypes which can both be rescued by the addition of CA to the nursing mothers. Given that 
Δ4-3-oxoR, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase and 3β-HSD are part of the same bile acid biosynthesis 
pathway, it would be expected that a deficiency within Δ4-3-oxoR would result in a similar phenotype 
to the aforementioned mutational models, and may also be rescued by cholic acid. Moreover, long 
term efficacy (although limited) has been observed in patients with Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No published studies were found on cholic acid’s secondary pharmacodynamic effects in animal 
studies. Cholic acid being an endogenous substance, no secondary pharmacological effects is expected. 
Data from repeated-dose toxicology suggest that there is no pharmacologic or toxic action of cholic 
acid outside the organs of the enterohepatic circulation. 
Safety pharmacology programme  
The Applicant has provided reference to a range of studies for the cardiovascular system of rat and cat, 
and the rat autonomic nervous system following administration of cholic acid. The full core battery of 
safety pharmacology studies as defined in NfG on safety pharmacology studies for human 
pharmaceuticals (CPMP/ICH/539/00) consists of cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous 
system studies. Cholic acid is bound to specific transporter and receptor proteins. In this case it is 
sufficient to evaluate safety pharmacology endpoints as a part of the toxicology studies and a reduced 
number of safety pharmacology studies. Organs of the enterohepatic circulation have been identified 
from repeated-dose toxicity studies to be the target organs for cholic acid toxicity. A negative 
chronotropic effect was observed in vivo in rats at intravenous cholic acid doses between 10 and 
40 mg/kg (Joubert 1978). This effect was shown to be dose-dependent in vitro and causes both a 
vagally mediated and direct effect on heart rate. This effect was reduced with atropine or vagotomy. 
Ganglion blockade and decerebration further diminishes this effect (Joubert 1978). At low 
concentrations on cat cardiac muscle, cholic acid induces a mild positive inotropic effect and induces an 
endocardial endothelium-dependent and β-receptor-mediated positive inotropic response, while cholic

Page 18/74 
 
 
 
 
acid at higher concentrations or after prolonged single low concentration causes extensive 
morphological damage of the endocardial endothelium (Colpaert et al. 1992).  
In an in vivo experiment of the rat heart bile acids decrease rat heart rate when administrated with 
adrenaline and noradrenaline. Increased vasoconstriction is also observed and there is an inversion of 
acetylcholine effects on the heart and blood vessels. Bile acids decreased the relaxing effect of 
isoprenaline on the intestine and reversed the effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline on the intestine. 
The contraction-inducing effects of acetylcholine and pilocarpine were increased after administration 
with cholic acid (Kadlubowski et al. 1984).  
The heart is exposed to concentrations of cholic acid in the micromolar range under normal conditions, 
when cholic acid is confined to the enterohepatic circulation. This is 10 to 1000-fold below the 
concentrations used in the experiments described above. Only under conditions of cholestasis or 
continued cholic acid administration does its concentration in peripheral blood approach these 
concentrations. Such situations were considered unlikely to persist due to the self-limiting toxicity of 
cholic acid as evidenced by pruritus and diarrhoea as well as elevated serum bile acids, transaminases, 
and particularly GGT (Güldütuna et al. 1993; Gonzales et al. 2009). Precautions against chronic 
overdose have been specified in the SmPC (see section 4.8) and include regular monitoring of serum 
and urine bile acid levels as well as liver parameters. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No studies were found in the literature detailing possible pharmacodynamic drug interactions of cholic 
acid. Studies which describe the pharmacokinetic drug interactions with cholic acid are discussed in the 
section below. 
3.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
The absorption of cholic acid is well recognised and established. Following ingestion, absorption of 
cholic acid will first be by the small intestine, and is then transported to the liver by the blood for 
further processing. Cholic acid was shown to be mainly absorbed in the distal (ileal) rather than 
proximal segments of the small intestine in the guinea pig (Weiner and Lack 1962). Absorption studies 
showed that cholic acid pool sizes were shown to be 168 ± 21 and 106 ± 12 μmol/kg body weight for 
mice and rats, respectively. This is equivalent to 68.5 ± 8.6 and 43.2 ± 4.9 mg/kg for mice and rats 
respectively (Hulzebos et al. 2001). These are considered by the Applicant to be an underestimate and 
have proposed the pool sizes to be 150 mg/kg for rats and 69 mg/kg for mice. The Fractional Turnover 
Rate (FTR) values were 0.44 ± 0.03 and 0.88 ± 0.10 for mice and rats and the corresponding 
synthesis rates were 29.8 ± 6.5 mg/kg and 38 ± 0.4 mg/kg respectively (Hulzebos et al. 2001). 
Distribution 
No publications were reported on kinetic parameters, bioequivalence and/or bioavailability. It is 
expected that the vast majority of cholic acid is present within the organs of the enterohepatic 
circulation, while a smaller fraction is present in peripheral blood; rhesus monkey studies provided 
further evidence of this (Little et al. 1975). Cholic acid is tightly bound to albumin with around 95% of 
total cholic acid bound. Placental transfer studies in a number of species (rat, sheep and rhesus 
monkeys) gives contradictory evidence to whether cholic acid transfers between mother and foetus. 
Bile acids and cholic acid are normally present in fetal serum (Little et al. 1975; Hassan and Subbiah 
Assessment report  
EMA/596651/2013  
Page 19/74 
 
 
 
 
1980; Campos et al. 1986; Perez et al. 1994) so fetal exposure to endogenous levels of cholic acid and 
the potential placental transfer can be considered to be physiological (Hassan and Subbiah 1980).  
Metabolism 
Cholic acid and other bile acids are found as natural constituents of the bile. Cholic acid, 
chenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid constitute 95% of biliary bile acids in humans. Lithocholic 
acid and ursodeoxycholic acid are minor constituents. The bile acids exist largely as glycine and taurine 
conjugates the salts of which are called bile salts (Brunton et al. 2005). Once secreted, the bile acids 
are deconjugated and primary bile acids are partially converted into secondary bile acids through the 
action of intestinal bacteria. Between 90 and 95% of bile acids are reabsorbed, mainly from the lower 
half of the small intestine and undergo enterohepatic circulation, small quantities occur in the stools 
and very little is normally excreted in the urine. The bile acids that return to the liver via the 
enterohepatic route are reconjugated before re-secretion into bile. The self-regulating pathway for bile 
acid synthesis is sensitive to the enterohepatic circulation and to bile acid feeding (Setchell and 
O’Connell 2007). 
The primary bile acids in humans, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, are synthesised in 
hepatocytes from cholesterol by a sequence of reactions modifying the steroid nucleus and the side 
chain (Setchell and O’Connell 2007). The enzymes that catalyse these reactions are located in various 
subcellular compartments. Considerable substrate promiscuity for the enzymes takes place under 
normal conditions, and this is exaggerated in pathologic conditions that interfere with the integrity of 
the biosynthetic pathway, as in 3β-HSD deficiency and Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency. Overall, it is now 
recognised that there are two main pathways leading to primary bile acid synthesis, termed the 
classical or neutral and the acidic pathways. 
The first and rate-limiting reaction in bile acid synthesis through the classic pathway involves the 
introduction of a hydroxyl group at position C-7 of the cholesterol nucleus by cholesterol 7α-
hydroxylase. Bile acid synthesis is largely regulated through negative feedback by bile acids returning 
via the portal vein during their enterohepatic recycling. 
Following the synthesis of 7α-hydroxycholesterol, modifications to the steroid nucleus take place that 
result in oxidoreduction and hydroxylation, consequently preparing the sterol intermediates for 
direction into either the cholic acid or chenodeoxycholic acid pathways: 
-  7α-hydroxycholesterol is converted to 7α-hydroxy 4-cholesten-3-one; a reaction catalysed the 
microsomal nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid 
oxidoreductase enzyme, also referred to as 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase/isomerase 
(3β-HSD). 
-  7α-hydroxy 4-cholesten-3-one is converted to 7α,12α-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one by a liver-
specific microsomal cytochrome P450 12α-hydroxylase. 12α-Hydroxylation through the above 
reaction directs the (dihydroxy-) intermediates into the cholic acid pathway; intermediates that do 
not undergo this reaction will be converted to chenodeoxycholic acid. 
-  7α,12α-Dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and 7α-hydroxy 4-cholesten-3-one both undergo reduction 
by the soluble Δ4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase (Δ4-3-oxoR, also referred to as 5β-reductase). 
- 
The resulting 3-oxo-5β (H) sterols and 3-hydroxo-5β (H) sterols are converted by a soluble 3α-
hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which comprises a group of isozymes. This is the final modification 
of the steroid nucleus and results in the formation of the intermediates, 5β- cholestane-
3α,7α,12α-triol and 5β-cholestane-3α,7α-diol (bile alcohols). 
Assessment report  
EMA/596651/2013  
Page 20/74 
 
 
 
 
- 
The bile alcohols then undergo a sequence of oxidation reactions of the side chain and its 
consequent shortening by three carbon atoms. These reactions are catalysed first by 
mitochondrial and then peroxisomal enzymes and lead to the final products cholic acid and 
chenodeoxycholic acid. 
The primary bile acids are then conjugated to glycine and taurine, forming glycocholic acid and 
taurocholic acid as well as glycochenodeoxycholic acid and taurochenodeoxycholic acid. Upon secretion 
into the intestine, bile acids are largely reabsorbed in the ileum to return to the liver via the portal 
blood (Ross 2008). Primary bile acids that escape reabsorption into the colon are deconjugated and 
converted to secondary bile acids through the action of intestinal bacteria. The most important reaction 
in this context is the 7α-dehydroxylation Cholic acid is converted to deoxycholic acid, while 
chenodeoxycholic acid is converted to lithocholic acid by this reaction (Ross 2008). 
Overall, cholic acid metabolism has been extensively reviewed and is considered well established. 
Excretion 
Excretion studies in rats have shown that cholic acid is almost exclusively excreted in the faeces and is 
in the form of metabolites (Lindstedt and Norman 1955). No radioactivity was found in urine and only 
minor amounts of cholic acid were found in the unconjugated form. There appears to be bi-directional 
placenta transfer of bile acids as observed in sheep (Perez et al. 1994; Campos et al. 1986) and rhesus 
monkeys (Little et al. 1975). Contrary to these studies, no significant increase was seen in fetal bile 
acids despite a 30-fold increase in maternal plasma bile acids following bile duct ligation in placenta 
transfer studies in rats, thus highlighting potential differences in the PK between species (Hassan and 
Subbiah 1980). [14C] cholate was only found in fetal rhesus monkey plasma, bile, liver and intestine 
(Little et al. 1975).  
There was no literature found on excretion of milk in animals, mice. Feeding pregnant and nursing 
mice carrying a targeted inactivation of the HSD3B7 gene 0.1% or 0.5% cholic acid during late 
gestation and through postnatal day 28 resulted in an approximate doubling or normalisation, 
respectively, of the survival frequency of homozygous mutant offspring mice. This strongly indicates 
that cholic acid is secreted in milk in mice (Shea et al. 2007). Human data suggests that cholic acid is 
secreted in milk (Forsyth et al. 1983). 
Pharmacokinetic drug interaction 
Pharmacokinetic drug interaction in rats showed that cholestyramine, a bile acid sequestrant, removes 
cholic acid from the pool and stimulates its biosynthesis rate (Hulzebos et al. 2001).  
Cyclosporine A and verapamil (strongly interacting with MDR1) interfere with the transport of cholic 
acid. Cyclosporine A inhibits the uptake of cholic acid into rat hepatocytes in vitro and leads to 
increased serum cholic acid concentrations in vivo (Azer and Stacey 1994). In isolated and cultured rat 
liver slices, both CsA and verapamil interfered with the transport of cholic acid. The in vivo significance 
of the verapamil interaction remains unclear from these experiments (Barth et al. 2006)  
Phenobarbital treatment increases the transport capacity (Vmax) for bile salt in the ileum of the rat. 
Cronholm et al. 1974 found that rats treated with phenobarbital for 10 days had a 4-fold smaller cholic 
acid pool compared to control rats. Additionally, the daily production of cholic acid was decreased in 
phenobarbital treated rats compared to control rats. Phenobarbital has an antagonistic effect to the 
desired action of cholic acid in patients and may potentially endanger the established metabolic 
control. Therefore use of Phenobarbital in patients treated with cholic acid has been contraindicated.

3.3.4.  Toxicology 
Nonclinical toxicology of cholic acid was reviewed in a series of publications based on single–dose, 
repeat–dose, in vitro genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and embryo-fetal development studies. These 
studies were conducted in six different species (mouse, rat, gerbil, sheep and chick), via five routes of 
administration (oral – via feeding [p.o.], subcutaneous [s.c.], intravenous [i.v.], intraperitoneal [i.p.], 
and intrarectal). The majority of studies were performed in the 1970s or earlier, before the 
implementation of Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations. All referenced studies are academic, 
and none notes adherence to GLP.  
Single-dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity studies reported from the literature were carried out in intravenously in mice 
(Rothlin and Schalch 1944), rats (Joubert 1978) and rabbits (Gillert 1926) and additionally by oral 
administration to mice (Informatics Inc. 1973). In the mouse, the LD50 is estimated to 350 mg/kg 
(i.v.) while in the rabbit study the lethal dose and sub-lethal dose was considered to be 50 mg/kg 
(i.v.).  
Repeat dose toxicity  
No new repeated-dose toxicity studies were conducted for this application. Studies from published 
literature have been summarised and reviewed in mice (Fickert et al. 2001; Beasancon et al. 1970; 
Wang et al. 1999), rats (Delzenne et al. 1992; Bray and Gallagher 1969; Visek et al. 1965; Gambal 
and Quackenbush 1960; Lacassagne et al. 1967) and gerbils (Bergmann and van der Linden 1971). 
The studies reviewed are of small size and systematic dosing data is not available. Frequently reported 
effects of cholic acid have included decreased body weight (Bray and Gallagher 1969) or retarded 
gains in weight (Lacassagne et al. 1967), increased liver weight (Fickert et al. 2001; Delzenne et al. 
1992; Lacassagne et al. 1967 and Bergmann and van der Linden 1971), development of gallstones 
(Tepperman et al. 1964; Wang et al. 1999; Beasancon et al. 1970 and Bergmann and van der Linden 
1971) and diarrhoea (Visek et al. 1965; Gambal and Quackenbush 1960). Other effects have also been 
reported such as rectal bleeding (Baijal et al. 1998) and spleen hypertrophy (Lacassagne et al. 1967). 
In Mongolian gerbils fed chow supplemented with 1% cholesterol and 0.5% cholic acid developed 
steatosis of the liver, accumulation of lipids in the reticuloendothelial system, high serum cholesterol 
levels and accentuated hypoplastic changes of the thyroid gland (Bergmann and van der Linden 1971). 
In the bile, a marked rise of the cholesterol concentration, a slight rise of the cholic acid and 
deoxycholic acid and a decrease of the chenodeoxycholic acid concentration were observed. After 4 
months on the diet, cholesterol gallstones were found in the distended gallbladders. Discontinuance of 
the diet showed the gerbil to be rather unable to free itself from excess cholesterol with a very slow 
and incomplete return to normal of liver histology which was in contrast to that seen in rodents. It is 
considered that the gerbil is not a suitable model to draw direct conclusion to humans given that 
gerbils are vegetarians and are probably physiologically poorly adapted to metabolise cholesterol. The 
rat however like humans is an omnivore and so is considered more similar in term of cholesterol 
metabolism. Given the differences in cholesterol metabolism and excretion between gerbils and rats 
and the physiological dissimilarities of the gerbil to human, the likelihood that the toxicities seen with 
the Bergman and van der Linden 1971 study is unlikely to be relevant to humans. 
Genotoxicity 
In vitro 
Assessment report  
EMA/596651/2013

A number of studies have shown conflicting evidence as to whether cholic acid is genotoxic and 
whether it has mutagenic potential. The Salmonella typhimurium and Ames test has been used to 
evaluate the mutagenic potential of cholic acid. Three studies used a fluctuation test with metabolic 
activation in strains TA98 and TA100 and cholic acid was found to be negative in two (Venitt et al. 
1987; Mori et al. 1991) but positive in another (Watabe and Bernstein 1985). The positive results seen 
in the fluctuation assay by Watabe and Bernstein have largely been discredited by Venitt et al, (1987) 
and Mori et al, (1991).   
In mammalian cells in vitro, a clear dose-dependent genotoxic effect induced by chenodeoxycholic acid 
and deoxycholic acid was observed (Jenkins et al. 2007). It is acknowledged that genotoxicity studies 
were not completed according to OECD 471 or ICH S2 (R1) guidelines. Irrespective of whether the 
genotoxicity testing was conducted fully in accordance with the OECD 471 guideline and ICH S2 (R1), 
the dose of cholic acid to be administered to the patients is intended to restore a concentration that is 
equivalent to that physiologically present in humans. Therefore any perceived genotoxic risk from 
cholic acid and deoxycholic acid to the patients would be equivalent to that of a normal healthy adult 
that produces these bile acids intrinsically. Overall, Cholic acid showed non significant mutagenic 
activity in a battery of genotoxicity tests performed in vitro.  
In vivo 
No in vivo data has been reported. Cholic acid being an endogenous substance it cannot be considered 
to be genotoxic at physiological concentrations and the lack of in vivo genotoxicity data is justified. 
According to the “Note for guidance on genotoxicity (ICH S2(R1) or EMEA/CHMP/ICH/126642/2008) 
there are compounds for which standard in vivo tests do not provide additional useful information. 
Cholic acid can be considered such a compound, in addition cholic acid has been shown to not interact 
with DNA via adduct formation (Scates et al. 1995). 
Carcinogenicity 
No long-term oral carcinogenicity studies of cholic acid or other bile acids have been found in the 
literature. All studies were instead reviewed in carcinogenicity models where a known carcinogen was 
given to initiate the formation of tumours or pre-neoplastic lesions. 
In short or medium term studies animal models (rats) indicate that administered bile acids show liver 
carcinogenic promotion potential and that this is carcinogen dependent. No carcinogenic effects were 
seen under cholic acid treatment without the addition of carcinogens. Despite this, it is not possible to 
eliminate bile acids from human metabolism as they play a vital role. Elevated gastrointestinal bile acid 
concentrations are probably best regarded as a potential risk factor for gastrointestinal cancer. In the 
case of treatment of patients with 3β-HSD and Δ4-3-oxoR deficiencies, the restoration of normal 
functional enterohepatic circulation and normal absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins together with 
the long-term survival and the avoidance of liver disease (in itself a risk for carcinogenicity) largely 
outweighs the potential risk of carcinogenicity. Long-term monitoring of the risk for carcinogenicity is 
included as an element in the Risk Management Plan. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Cholic acid has been demonstrated be present in foetal blood and to pass the placenta in rat (Hassan 
and Subbiah 1980) and sheep (Perez et al. 1994; Campos et al. 1986) studies. With regards to effects 
on the reproduction and development of the animals, in hamsters cholic acid showed toxic effects upon 
the histology of the liver in both mothers and offspring (Siviero et al. 2008). However, the hamsters 
received food supplemented with 0.5% (60 mg/day) cholic acid; given the endogenous cholic acid pool 
Assessment report  
EMA/596651/2013  
Page 23/74 
 
 
 
 
sizes for both mice and rats, it is likely that this corresponds to at least the endogenous pool size fed 
per day. Both a bolus injection (Perez et al. 1994) into pregnant sheep and the continuous infusion 
(Campos et al. 1986) of 934 mg cholic acid per day into foetal lambs resulted in the early delivery of 
fetuses. However, at physiological concentrations cholic acid as an endogenously present molecule is 
non-embryotoxic. Verrett et al. (1980) reported no teratogenic effects in chickens when 25 mg of 
cholic acid was injected in a single volume of 100 μL or less per egg. No publications were reported on 
prenatal and postnatal development and on juvenile studies. Clinical data has shown there to be four 
successful pregnancies in patients who had been receiving Orphacol, all producing healthy babies. No 
nonclinical studies were identified investigating the effects of the use of cholic acid during lactation and 
paediatric development. From a mouse study examining deficiency of the HSD3B7 gene, there is 
evidence that cholic acid is secreted in murine milk and has beneficial effect in inborn error of primary 
bile acid synthesis (Shea et al. 2007). 
Toxicokinetic data 
No toxicokinetic data has been provided and no non-rodent data was available. Due to the large 
amount of clinical data available on cholic acid, the absence of animal data is acceptable. 
Target organs for toxicity for cholic acid are in the enterohepatic circulation, the liver and 
administration causes diarrhoea. In combination with a high-cholesterol containing diet, cholic acid 
administration leads to increased liver weight and the formation of gallstones in rodents. The basis for 
this toxic effect appears to be related to a particular combination of metabolically related substances. 
The formation of gallstones has been linked to the cholesterol super-saturation of bile provoked by this 
diet. These toxicities were observed at up to 11 to 22 times the endogenous cholic acid pool, although 
the comparison of administered doses remain approximate as cholic acid was supplemented to the diet 
of experimental animals rather than given in defined gavaged amounts. The lack of toxicokinetic data 
further limits the interpretation of these results as no correlation exists between dose/systemic 
concentrations and toxicities arising. 
Local Tolerance 
No studies were identified investigating local tolerance. As the administration route is oral, dedicated 
studies are not considered relevant. 
Other toxicity  
Metabolites 
Deoxycholic acid is the main metabolite of cholic acid. Patients with 3β-HSD deficiency and Δ4-3-oxoR 
deficiency and subjects with a normal bile acid metabolism have shown that upon treatment with cholic 
acid, serum and bile predominantly contain cholic acid and deoxycholic acid, while chenodeoxycholic 
acid and its metabolites appear to be reduced. Under cholic acid treatment, patients are therefore 
exposed to higher than normal deoxycholic acid concentrations, although the exact quantifications of 
these concentrations have not been described.  
In single- and repeat-dose studies, deoxycholic acid showed lethal effects, gastrointestinal and hepatic 
toxicities at approximately half the doses needed for cholic acid to produce the same effects. It is 
therefore considered that deoxycholic acid is more toxic than cholic acid and may in fact be the 
causative agent of some of cholic acid’s toxicity.  
Mutagenicity data from bacterial test for deoxycholic acid is ambiguous but deoxycholic acid was 
genotoxic in an in vitro micronucleus assay. Additionally, Rosignoli et al 2008 investigated the 
Assessment report  
EMA/596651/2013  
Page 24/74 
 
 
 
 
genotoxic potential of BA (focusing on chenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid) on human 
colonocytes and colon tumour cells HT 29 by a comet assay. In both cell types a clear dose-dependent 
genotoxic effect induced by the two bile acids was observed, with deoxycholic acid being more 
genotoxic. Viability of cells appeared to be greater than 75%. Use of a nuclease III modified comet 
assay suggested that the DNA damage could be mediated by reactive oxygen species production but 
was somewhat protected by inclusion of anti-oxidants.   
Short term carcinogenicity studies suggest that deoxycholic acid like cholic acid has carcinogenicity 
promoting properties. In rat liver, deoxycholic acid (75-150 mg/kg) exerted promoting activity as 
evidenced by significantly increased values of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase-positive (γ-GT+) liver foci 
compared with the corresponding controls given the carcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN) alone. 
Deoxycholic acid (20 mg/kg) enhanced the development and growth of azoxymethane (AOM) –induced 
aberrant crypt foci in rat colons (Tsuda et al. 1984; Shiota et al. 1999). In a parallel study, deoxycholic 
acid in the absence of AOM did not significantly induce aberrant crypt foci. However, Rosignoli et al 
2008 concluded that deoxycholic acid may act not only as promoters but also initiators of the 
multistage process of carcinogenesis. The potential carcinogenic effects of deoxycholic acid is 
highlighted as a potential risk, and long-term monitoring of the risk for carcinogenicity is included as 
an element in the Risk Management Plan.  
Impurities 
A study in oesophageal cells has demonstrated no genotoxicity for methyl cholate at concentrations of 
25 to 200 µM test (Macdonald et al. 1978). This is in excess of methyl cholate concentrations found at 
maximal daily dose of Orphacol. 
At least 15 patients reported by Gonzales et al. (2009), have been treated, most of them for more 
than 10 years, with cholic acid preparations that have contained between 0.4 to 0.5% of methyl 
cholate. No adverse events have been reported in this population at therapeutic doses of cholic acid. 
Methyl cholate has been shown in vitro to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. According to specified limits of 
methyl cholate it is accepted that cholesterol synthesis of patients would not be adversely affected at 
this concentration. 
3.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
Given that cholic acid is an endogenous bile acid and a physiological substance in mammals, it would 
occur naturally in the environment as faeces. Therefore, it is exempt from the requirement of an ERA 
in line with the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of the medicinal products for human 
use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). 
3.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacological effects of cholic acid on the metabolism and secretion of bile acids are well 
documented in numerous scientific publications, including studies that document the effects of cholic 
acid in mice with deficiencies in bile acid metabolism comparable to that of 3β-HSD deficiency but not 
Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency. Metabolism of bile acids is tightly controlled via a negative feedback regulation of 
bile acid synthesis. The pharmacokinetics of cholic acid is well recognised and established, although no 
publications were found in kinetic parameters, bioequivalence and/or bioavailability. The Applicant 
provided a satisfactory analysis to support this application. Target organs for toxicity for cholic acid are 
in the enterohepatic circulation, the liver and administration causes diarrhoea. In combination with a 
Assessment report  
EMA/596651/2013

high-cholesterol containing diet, cholic acid administration leads to increased liver weight and the 
formation of gallstones in rodents.   
A number of studies have shown conflicting evidence as to whether cholic acid is genotoxic and 
whether it has mutagenic potential. The Salmonella typhimurium and Ames test has been used to 
evaluate the mutagenic potential of cholic acid. The positive results seen in the fluctuation assay by 
Watabe and Bernstein have largely been discredited by Venitt et al, (1987) and Mori et al, (1991). In 
mammalian cells in vitro, a clear dose-dependent genotoxic effect induced by CDCA and DCA was 
observed. It is acknowledged that genotoxicity studies were not completed according to OECD 471 or 
ICH S2 (R1) guidelines and this has been adequately justified by the Applicant.   
While no long-term carcinogenicity studies have been preformed, cholic acid was shown to enhance 
carcinogenesis of target organs following administration of known carcinogens. The main metabolite, 
deoxycholic acid, was shown to be more toxic than cholic acid and may be the causative agent of some 
of cholic acid’s toxicity. The mutagenic potential of deoxycholic acid is ambiguous with one study 
suggesting that it may act not only as promoters but also initiators of the multistage process of 
carcinogenesis. The potential carcinogenic effects of deoxycholic acid has been highlighted as a 
potential risk, and long-term monitoring of the risk for carcinogenicity is included as an element in the 
Risk Management Plan for Orphacol.   
A study in oesophageal cells has demonstrated no genotoxicity for methyl cholate at concentrations of 
25 to 200 µM. This is in excess of methyl cholate concentrations found at maximal daily dose of 
Orphacol. At least 15 patients reported by Gonzales et al. (2009), have been treated, most of them for 
more than 10 years, with cholic acid preparations that have contained between 0.4 to 0.5% of methyl 
cholate. No adverse events have been reported in this population at therapeutic doses of cholic acid. 
Methyl cholate has been shown in vitro to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. According to the specified limits 
of methyl cholate, it is accepted that cholesterol synthesis of patients would not be adversely affected 
at this concentration. 
3.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant submitted an application for a well established use product, and as such submitted no 
new non-clinical data. The extensive literature review of the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
toxicology of cholic acid is considered appropriate and acceptable to support the non-clinical aspect of 
Orphacol. 
With regard to the nonclinical aspects the majority of cited literature are dated in the 1970’s or earlier 
and pre-date implementation of GLP requirements. The GLP status of the studies reviewed from 
published literature cannot be verified. In view of the available data from use of cholic acid in humans, 
both for the treatment of various medical conditions as well as non-medical use, and taken into 
account the endogenous nature of the substance, the CHMP considers the lack of confirmation of the 
GLP status acceptable.  
The analysed non-clinical data from the literature reveal no special hazard for humans based on 
studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to 
reproduction. The studies reviewed have however not been conducted to the same level of detail as for 
a pharmaceutical agent, as cholic acid is a physiological substance in animals and humans. 
The intravenous LD 50 of cholic acid in mice is 350 mg/kg body weight. Parenteral administration may 
cause haemolysis and cardiac arrest. Administered orally, bile acids and salts generally have only a 
minor toxic potential. The oral LD50 in mouse is 1520 mg/kg. In repeated-dose studies, frequently 
reported effects of cholic acid have included decreased body weight, diarrhoea and liver damage with 
Assessment report  
EMA/596651/2013  
Page 26/74 
 
 
 
 
elevated transaminases. Increased liver weight and gallstones have been reported in repeated dose 
studies in which cholic acid was co-administered with cholesterol.  
Cholic acid showed non significant mutagenic activity in a battery of genotoxicity tests performed in 
vitro. Data reviewed suggest that cholic acid does not act as a carcinogen per se but as a promoter of 
carcinogenicity only following treatment with an alkylating agent. Evidence for a tumour-promoting 
potential of some bile acids, particularly deoxycholic acid, have been shown. As conservative approach, 
given the limited data provided the long-term monitoring of the risk for carcinogenicity is included as 
an element in the Risk Management Plan. 
Animal studies showed that cholic acid did not induce any teratogenic effect or foetal toxicity. No data 
on the effects of cholic acid on fertility are available. At therapeutic doses, no effect on fertility is 
anticipated. Cholic acid and its metabolites are excreted in human milk, but at therapeutic doses of 
Orphacol, no effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. Orphacol can be used during 
breast-feeding. 
3.4.  Clinical aspects 
3.4.1.  Introduction 
To support the application, from clinical perspective, the Applicant has submitted a total of 38 patient 
reports involving confirmed or suspected 3β-HSD and 11 involving Δ4-3-oxoR deficiencies. Of the 38 
patients with 3β-HSD deficiency, 21 were treated with cholic acid, 8 were treated with other bile acids 
and 9 did not receive bile acids. Of the 11 patients with Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency, 7 were treated with 
cholic acid, 3 were treated with other bile acids and 1 patient received no treatment. 
In accordance with Article 22 of Directive 2001/83/EC, Article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 
and Annex I, part II of Directive 2001/83/EC the Applicant applied for a marketing authorisation under 
exceptional circumstances. The Applicant provided adequate justification for being unable to provide 
comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety because the indications for which Orphacol are intended 
are encountered so rarely that the Applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive 
evidence. It would also be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such 
information. 
GCP 
Due to the bibliographic nature of this application and the date of origin of some of the submitted case 
study reports GCP aspects are not fully covered according to the present regulatory standards. This is 
however acceptable due to the accepted well established use of the product.  
3.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No studies have been performed to determine the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Orphacol. 
However, the Applicant has provided a literature review of studies on bile acid kinetics. Cholic acid, a 
primary bile acid, is an endogenous molecule and present in normal human bile, blood and other 
biological fluids. Its metabolites, the secondary and tertiary bile acids, are equally present in normal 
human bile, blood and biological fluids and fulfil important biological functions. Therefore, cholic acid 
has generally been studied in the literature in terms of its kinetics and dynamics, and to a lesser 
degree as an exogenous pharmacological agent. Its pharmacokinetic characteristics, including its 
metabolism, are different from that of a conventional synthetic small molecule pharmaceutical in that 
once administered, any exogenously administered cholic acid will behave like an endogenous molecule 
Assessment report  
EMA/596651/2013  
Page 27/74 
 
 
 
 
in all respects. Data on the kinetics and dynamics of endogenous cholic acid thus provides relevant 
information on the clinical pharmacology of Orphacol. 
As a bile acid, cholic acid is subject to highly efficient first-pass hepatic extraction and enterohepatic 
recirculation. An accurate determination of the absorption kinetics would thus require blood sampling 
from the portal vein, which is only ethically possible in the context of a surgical intervention (Angelin et 
al. 1982). Sampling of peripheral plasma is a suitable method only for relative bioavailability and 
bioequivalence studies of bile acids with a low endogenous concentration (Setchell et al. 2004), which 
are not of relevance to this application. 
The bile acid pool is largely confined within the enterohepatic circulation and there is poor systemic 
distribution, resulting in low total serum bile acid concentrations of about 1-12 μmol/L. The total bile 
acid concentration in human peripheral serum fluctuates in relation to meal intake between 2-5 μM 
during night-time (fasting) lows to 10-16 μM during daytime highs (Everson 1987). In the hepatic 
venous portal plasma (i.e. within the enterohepatic circulation), fasting cholic acid concentration 
averaged 6.13 ± 2.57 μmol/L while maximum postprandial concentrations averaged 18.42 ± 4.17 
μmol/L (Angelin et al. 1982). Cholic acid is present in serum and plasma of normal humans, including 
children and pregnant women (Barth et al. 2005), in a range between 0.05-6.7 μmol/L. Values for 
normal children are broadly in the same range as for healthy adults. As noted above, serum bile acid 
concentrations vary considerably over the day and in relation to meal intake, so this broad normal 
range may be expected. 
Based on literature review, the normal concentration of cholic acid (as its glycocholic acid and 
taurocholic acid conjugates) in gallbladder bile is in the range of 4–74 mmol/L, with slight variations 
depending on the technique used (Perwaiz et al. 2001). Cholic acid makes up about 35% (range: 22–
44%) of gallbladder and hepatic bile (Ahlberg et al. 1981). 
Absorption 
The physico-chemical properties of a bile acid fundamentally govern its intestinal absorption: 
hydrophobic acids, including cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, are absorbed more rapidly by 
passive non ionic diffusion than hydrophilic bile acids such as ursodeoxycholic acid. Once absorbed, 
exogenously administered bile acids become part of the bile acid pool. The cholic acid pool size has 
been measured in healthy adult volunteers using a stable isotope dilution technique and capillary gas-
liquid chromatography (GLC) combined with electron impact mass spectrometry (MS) (Stellaard et 
al.1984; Everson 1987; Koopman et al. 1988) and by a microscale stable isotope dilution technique 
with GLC/electron capture negative chemical ionization-MS applied to the pentafluorobenzyl-
trimethylsilyl (PFB-TMS) derivative of cholic acid (Hulzebos et al. 2001), both with administration of 
the labelled cholic acid in a bicarbonate solution. In a healthy adult of 60 kg body weight, the pool size 
of cholic acid (and its conjugates) is approximately 600-750 mg. 
Bioequivalence  
Orphacol has been developed based on formulations established by the Bicêtre Hospital pharmacy and 
the Paris Hospitals Central Pharmacy (Agence Générale des Équipements et Produits de Santé, AGEPS) 
for the treatment of inborn errors in primary bile acid synthesis due 3β-HSD or ∆4-3-oxoR deficiency 
(Potin et al. 2001). Orphacol is formulated in two different strengths, 50 mg capsules and 250 mg 
capsules. The patients described in the studies of the Jacquemin group (Jacquemin et al. 2000; 
Gonzales 2006; Gonzales et al. 2009) have been treated with these formulations, produced by Bicêtre 
Hospital pharmacy and the AGEPS. 
The most important data supporting this application were generated by the Jacquemin group in the 
Paediatric Hepatology Unit at Bicêtre Hospital (Jacquemin et al. 1994; Jacquemin et al. 2000; Potin et 
Assessment report  
EMA/596651/2013  
Page 28/74 
 
 
 
 
al. 2001; Gonzales 2006; Gonzales et al. 2009). This hospital is part of the Assistance Publique – 
Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), the hospital group reuniting all public hospitals in the Paris area. The cholic 
acid formulation used to treat this patient population was initially produced by the Bicêtre Hospital 
Pharmacy and then by the AGEPS, the AP-HP Central Pharmacy. CRID Pharma took over the 
production of cholic acid capsules from AGEPS in 2007 for the ongoing compassionate use programme 
in France and this MAA. The demonstration of comparability between the AGEPS and CRID products, 
including bridging data on dissolution and particle size distribution, was considered satisfactory. 
Similarity: Bicêtre Hospital to AGEPS 
The change in production site from Bicêtre Hospital to AGEPS occurred during the observation period of 
the main supporting publications (Gonzales 2006; Gonzales et al. 2009). A partial analysis is possible 
by comparing the data reported for 6 patients that had been treated exclusively with the Bicêtre 
Hospital product after 5 years of treatment, and 3 patients that were exclusively treated with AGEPS 
product during the first 5 years (Gonzales et al. 2009). All patients were treated for 3β-HSD deficiency. 
Outcomes after 5 years of treatment with cholic acid preparations made by Bicêtre Hospital and AGEPS 
are similar. All patients survived without the need for a liver transplant; clinical symptoms, in particular 
hepatomegaly, resolved, and urinary 3β-hydroxylated-Δ5 bile acids were strongly reduced or absent. 
Similarity: AGEPS to Orphacol 
As the end of the observation period reported in these publications coincides with the change to the 
CRID product, i.e. Orphacol, no published data on the pharmacodynamics of the CRID product are 
available. However, the change from the drug product produced by AGEPS and used to treat the 
patient population studied by (Gonzales et al. 2009) to the drug product produced by CRID for the 
compassionate use did not lead to the need to adjust the dose in any patient nor to any reported 
adverse events. In addition, pharmaceutical similarity has been demonstrated. The AGEPS hospital 
preparation and Orphacol can therefore be considered to be similar. 
No data on the cholic acid formulations used in other studies are available in the literature. 
Similarity: Unpublished Data 
The Applicant has recovered the hospital records of the patients treated under compassionate use with 
Orphacol in France and compared the treatment response to its two predecessor formulations used to 
treat the patients. Data demonstrate that changes in the preparation of Orphacol had no significant 
effects on the treatment outcome.  
Patients were analysed in two groups: one that has received all three cholic acid preparations (Group 
A, 10 patients), and a second group that has been treated only with AGEPS and Orphacol (Group B, 5 
patients). The comparison of treatment results across treatment periods with the consecutive cholic 
acid formulations (Bicêtre vs. AGEPS vs. Orphacol) was made by deriving for every patient the means 
of the parameter of interest during the treatment period, and then comparing the mean of means of all 
patients during the treatment periods by ANOVA. There was no statistically significant difference in 
treatment outcome as measured by liver function tests (AST, ALT, total bilirubin, prothrombin time). 
The response to treatment was not significantly different between treatment periods in terms of serum 
AST and ALT. All values and standard deviations were in the normal range (AST: 9 to 60 IU/L, ALT: 10 
to 40 IU/L). Among 10 patients that changed from the Bicêtre hospital preparation to the AGEPS 
product (Group A), no dose adjustment was required. Among the 15 patients that changed from the 
AGEPS product to Orphacol (Groups A and B), 5 dose increases were made in the 12 months following 
the change. A close analysis of these dose changes showed that they were all made to compensate for 
growth and/or weight gain of the patients and not to insufficient efficacy or safety. Four of the dose 
Assessment report

Page 29/74 
 
 
 
 
increases had no close temporal relationship to patient visits, and the fifth patient had normal liver 
function tests when the change was made. 
Overall it is accepted that formulations used in the publications are unknown and that it is therefore 
not possible to compare Orphacol with such formulations in terms of quality and clinical similarity. The 
Applicant has provided relevant information regarding the pharmacodynamic and clinical aspects of 
some patients who were followed-up during the course of treatment under compassionate use when 
the old formulation was used. Some of these patients were switched to the new formulation. This 
switch is reported not to have resulted in any dose adjustment and there were no reported adverse 
events during the follow-up of these patients. Taking into account the demonstrated pharmaceutical 
comparability, it is considered that enough information has been provided demonstrating clinical 
similarity between the investigational formulation and the formulation that is intended for marketing.  
Influence of food 
In response to a standardised meal portal venous bile acids concentrations increased two- to six fold, 
with a peak seen 15-60 min after the meal. The maximum postprandial portal venous bile acid 
concentration averaged 43.04 ± 6.12 μmol/L, and the corresponding concentration in peripheral serum 
was 5.22 ± 0.74 μmol/L.  
The effect of food on the bioavailability of cholic acid has not been studied. Differences in the daily 
administered dose through interactions with different foods (in terms of composition and potentially 
quantity) are expected to be evened out through the long half life of bile acids in the enterohepatic 
circulation. It is recommended that the product should be taken with food. This recommendation is 
empirically based and follows the treatment modalities established at Bicêtre Hospital. There is a 
theoretical possibility that administration with food may increase cholic acid bioavailability and improve 
tolerability. 
Distribution  
Due to the enterohepatic distribution of bile acids, volume of distribution is not commonly used. Bile 
acid kinetics is more widely reported in terms of pool size and fractional turnover rate (Crosignani et 
al. 1996). The kinetics of bile acid distribution between the systemic vascular and non-vascular 
compartments is not fully understood and the total volume of distribution of bile acids outside the 
enterohepatic pool has not been accurately defined (Kaye et al. 1973; Crosignani et al. 1996). 
The approximate volume of distribution of endogenous bile acids in humans with normal liver function 
can be calculated from pool size and serum levels. When calculated this way, the volume of distribution 
of cholic acid is approximately 3400 L (Crosignani et al. 1996). When determined conventionally and 
normalised for body surface area, the volume of distribution is 1.879 ± 0.054 L/m2 (Gilmore and 
Thompson 1980). The bile acid pool is largely confined within the enterohepatic circulation and there is 
poor systemic distribution, resulting in low serum bile acid concentrations (about 5 μM) (Gilmore and 
Thompson 1980, Everson 1987, Crosignani et al. 1996).  
Serum bile acid concentrations fluctuate over the day in function of meal intake and bile secretion 
(Everson 1987). In untreated patients with 3β-HSD and Δ4-3-oxoR deficiencies, total serum bile acid 
levels are usually in the normal range or diminished (Gonzales et al. 2009). However, due to the 
metabolic defect in these patients, primary bile acids including cholic acid are absent or present only at 
trace concentrations. This is resolved upon treatment with primary bile acids, where the administered 
bile acid(s) and their secondary metabolites predominate (Ichimiya et al. 1991; Clayton et al. 1996; 
Gonzales et al. 2009).

Plasma has a very high binding capacity for bile acids and the binding shows rapid equilibration. 
Albumin in serum is capable of binding about 95% of the total cholic acid concentration present via the 
primary site for cholic acid. Cholic acid binding to whole serum can be accounted for by albumin. 
Elimination  
Cholic acid is synthesized in the liver and metabolised in the intestine. Patients under cholic acid 
therapy are not expected to differ qualitatively in their metabolism from normal subjects as their 
defect is in primary bile acid synthesis, which takes place in the liver. The metabolism to secondary 
bile acids takes place in intestine and through intestinal bacteria and is therefore unaffected by hepatic 
enzyme defects in 3β-HSD deficiency or Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency. The same metabolic steps in the 
intestine can be expected to also apply to exogenously applied cholic acid in patients under cholic acid 
therapy. Quantitatively, the secondary bile acids derived from chenodeoxycholic acid are expected to 
be low or absent in patients treated with cholic acid in monotherapy. Indeed, this pattern has been 
found in patients under cholic acid therapy, whose urine and biliary bile contained predominantly cholic 
acid and deoxycholic acid (Gonzales et al. 2009). 
Clearance of cholic acid was quantified in healthy volunteers and cirrhotic patients (Kaye et al. 1973). 
In both groups, during fasting, the curve for disappearance of radioactivity from the serum during the 
first 100 min after [14C] cholic acid injection was double-exponential in form. During the early phase, 
clearance was significantly more rapid, and concentrations of conjugated and free bile acid were 
significantly lower in healthy volunteers than in cirrhotic patients. Radioactivity disappeared from the 
systemic circulation of healthy volunteers within 3 h. Intravenous and oral clearance of cholic acid was 
quantified and found to be 271 ± 15 ml ∙ min-1 ∙ m-2 and 1248 ± 104 ml ∙ min-1 ∙ m-2, respectively 
(Gilmore and Thompson 1980). In patients with various hepatic diseases (cirrhoses, icteric and 
anicteric liver disease, hepatitis), these clearances were significantly reduced.  
The half-life of cholic acid is approximately 27 hours (Crosignani et al. 1996). Approximately 5% of the 
bile acid pool enters the colon and provides a substrate for the extensive microbial population that 
deconjugates and oxidizes hydroxyl groups, leading to formation of the secondary bile acids 
deoxycholic and lithocholic acids that are the major bile acids in faeces. The daily excretion of urinary 
bile acids was determined to be 7.0 ± 0.8 μmol per 24 hr and was independent of the 24-hr urine 
volume (Alme et al. 1977). Cholic acid made up 2-7% of the total bile acids. The rest of the total 
urinary bile acids was made up of a broad spectrum of other bile acid metabolites. Other sources 
report a substantially lower urinary excretion of bile acids of <1 μmol/day (Bernstein et al. 2005). 
Given a daily total synthesis rate of approximately 10 μmol/kg body weight per day which 
quantitatively replaces the amount lost by excretion, renal excretion is therefore a minor (≤1%) 
elimination route for cholic acid and its metabolites. Overall, in subjects with normal liver function, bile 
acids including cholic acid are excreted in the urine in negligible amounts (Alme et al. 1977). In case of 
cholestasis, when plasma bile acid concentrations are increased, renal excretion is also strongly 
increased. This is the case in untreated patients with 3β-HSD or Δ4-3-oxoR deficiencies. Bile salts, 
including cholate, are a normal component of human breast milk (Forsyth et al. 1983). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies  
This has not been specifically studied or discussed. No discussion is required as this issue does not 
generate safety concerns.

Pharmacokinetics in target population 
No population pharmacokinetic studies are available for cholic acid in the treatment of 3β-HSD and Δ4-
3-oxoR deficiencies. Such studies are considered to be not technically possible at the current state of 
scientific knowledge. No difference in intestinal absorption of cholic acid between patients and healthy 
subjects is expected, as the enzymatic defects in patients concern hepatic enzymes. In untreated 
patients with 3β-HSD and Δ4-3-oxoR deficiencies, total serum bile acid levels are usually in the normal 
range or diminished (Gonzales et al. 2009), but increases have also been reported (Ichimiya et al. 
1991). However, due to the metabolic defect in these patients, primary bile acids including cholic acid 
are absent or present only at trace concentrations. This is resolved upon treatment with primary bile 
acids, where the administered bile acid(s) and their secondary metabolites predominate (Ichimiya et 
al. 1991; Clayton et al. 1996; Gonzales et al. 2009). Catabolic metabolism of cholic acid takes place in 
the intestine by intestinal bacteria. No difference between patients and normal subjects is expected in 
this regard, as the enzyme defect in 3β-HSD deficiency and Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency affects hepatic 
enzymes and not the intestinal microflora. Elimination of bile acids occurs almost exclusively by faecal 
excretion. No difference between patients and healthy subjects is to be expected. 
Cholic acid dosage is established individually for each patient based on their pharmacodynamic 
response, both at the initiation and regularly during maintenance of treatment. Therefore such studies 
are not considered as providing any  additional information for the dosage recommendations or the 
safe and effective use of cholic acid, regardless of possible inter- and intrasubject variations in 
pharmacokinetics. 
Special populations  
Impaired renal function 
There are no reports on the use of cholic acid for the therapy of 3β-HSD deficiency or a Δ4-3-oxoR 
deficiency in patients with renal impairment in the literature. Bile acid metabolites are excreted only 
under conditions of cholestasis, which is resolved by cholic acid treatment. No data are available for 
patients with end-stage renal disease. Bile acids including cholic acid are excreted in the urine in 
negligible amounts in humans with normal liver function (Alme et al. 1977). Therefore, a strong 
reduction or even absence of renal clearance is expected to have negligible influence on plasma levels 
of bile acids, including of cholic acid and its metabolites, as long as patients are well controlled through 
bile acid therapy. 
Impaired hepatic function 
Cholic acid is synthesized in the liver and metabolised in the intestine. Patients who receive cholic acid 
therapy are not expected to differ qualitatively in their bile acid catabolism from normal subjects as 
their defect is in hepatic primary bile acid synthesis. The metabolism of primary to secondary bile acids 
takes place in intestine through intestinal bacteria and is therefore unaffected by the hepatic enzyme 
defects in 3β-HSD deficiency or Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency. The majority of patients treated with cholic acid 
presented with some degree of hepatic impairment at the time of diagnosis which resolved under 
therapy. The evaluation of the safety of cholic acid includes patients with this metabolic impairment. 
No data on cholic acid treatment are available in patients with 3β-HSD deficiency or Δ4-3-oxoR 
deficiency with hepatic impairment unrelated to their primary disease. Theoretically, decreased hepatic 
clearance of bile acids and/or cholestasis may occur, leading to increased serum levels of bile acids, 
including of cholic acid. This suggests that the cholic acid dose would have to be reduced carrying the 
risk of a de-repression of the biosynthesis of primary bile acid synthesis and hence the biosynthesis of 
the hepatotoxic and cholestatic bile acid metabolites (3β,7α-dihydroxy- and 3β,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5-
cholenoic acids in 3β-HSD deficiency and 3-oxo-7α-hydroxy-4-cholenoic and 3-oxo-7α,l2α-dihydroxy-

4-cholenoic acids in Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency). Overall, in the absence of clinical experience in patients 
with hepatic impairment from causes other than 3β-HSD or Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency, no 
recommendations on dosage adjustment can be made. Patients with hepatic impairment should be 
monitored closely. 
Familial hypertriglyceridemia 
Type IV hyperlipoproteinemia, in particular familial hypertriglyceridemia (FHT), has been associated 
with defective bile acid absorption (Angelin et al. 1978). Type IV hyperlipoproteinemia is not a rare 
condition: between 1 and 10% of the Western population could be affected, depending on the source. 
Therefore, the possibility exits that there may be patients with inborn errors in primary bile acid 
synthesis and FHT. Overall, patients with newly diagnosed or a family history of familial 
hypertriglyceridemia are expected to poorly absorb cholic acid in the intestine. The cholic acid dose for 
patients with familial hypertriglyceridemia will have to be established and adjusted, but an elevated 
dose, notably higher than the 500 mg daily limit for adult patients, may be required and safe. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Numerous products have been shown to influence bile flow and composition (Okolicsanyi et al. 1986). 
The relevant interactions for cholic acid are expected to be those that are also relevant for the other 
bile acids that are used as medicinal products, chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid. 
Colesevelam hydrochloride, colestipol hydrochloride and cholestyramine sequester bile acids 
(Okolicsanyi et al. 1986; Dr. Falk Pharma UK Ltd 2005; sigma-tau Arzneimittel GmbH 2008). 
Simultaneous administration of medicinal products containing bile acid sequestrants and cholic acid is 
expected to reduce the efficacy of both. Antacids containing aluminium hydroxide or aluminium oxide 
bind bile acids equally (Dr. Falk Pharma UK Ltd 2005; sigma-tau Arzneimittel GmbH 2008). It is 
therefore recommended to separate the administration of bile acid sequestrants or aluminium-
containing antacids and cholic acid by at least five hours to avoid an interaction in the gastrointestinal 
tract. 
Non-clinical data indicate that ciclosporin may alter the pharmacokinetics of cholic acid by blocking its 
uptake into hepatocytes and thus increasing its serum concentration. This interaction is also included 
in the product information of ursodeoxycholic acid (Dr Falk Pharma UK Ltd 2005). As a decreased 
uptake of cholic acid into hepatocytes will decrease its efficacy, co-administration with oral or 
intravenous ciclosporin should be avoided. If administration of ciclosporin is considered necessary, 
serum and urine bile acid levels should be closely monitored and the cholic acid dose adjusted 
accordingly. 
Data in primates and humans indicate that phenobarbital administration leads to an increase in the 
pool size and turnover of cholic acid. It was found that administration of 90 mg or 180 mg per day 
phenobarbital for 6 months increases cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity by 20% (Coyne et al. 1976). 
This is an antagonistic effect to the desired action of cholic acid in patients and will endanger the 
established metabolic control. As therapeutic alternatives to phenobarbital are available, its use in 
patients treated with cholic acid is contraindicated.  
The interactions of cholic acid with intestinal and hepatic transporter proteins, as well as with various 
hepatic cytochromes (principally CYP7A1, but also CYP7B1, CYP27A1 and CYP8B1) have been well 
characterised. No interactions of cholic acid with typical drug-metabolising cytochromes (as listed in 
the CPMP “Note for Guidance on the Investigation of Drug Interactions”, CPMP/EWP/560/95) have 
been described in the literature.

3.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No pharmacodynamic studies in patients with 3β-HSD or ∆4-3-oxoR deficiency are described in the 
literature. In patients with 3β-HSD or ∆4-3-oxoR deficiency, orally administered cholic acid acts to 
replace the missing endogenous primary bile acids both in terms of their physiological functions and 
their metabolic regulation.  
Primary pharmacology 
Bile acids have a multitude of functions as shown in Table 1 below. The individual contribution of 
different primary bile acids and their various conjugates have only been partially elucidated. Cholic acid 
and its conjugates appear have a major function in most, if not all of the functions (Balistreri, 1991). 
Table 1 
Physiological functions of bile acids 
A. In the liver 
1. Generate bile flow through upregulation of bile acid transporters 
2. Induce biliary lipid secretion 
3. Modulate cholesterol homeostasis through regulation of synthesis and catabolism 
4. Regulation of lipoprotein production 
B. In bile 
1. Desaturate bile cholesterol – reduce lithogenic potential 
2. Transport cholesterol  
3. Buffer Ca 2+ ion 
C. In the intestine 
1. Form micelles (fat digestion) 
2. Accelerate lipid transport, including fat-soluble vitamin (A, D, E) absorption 
3. Modulate motility  
4. Modulate GI hormone output 
5. Induce ion (and water) secretion 
The effects of oral cholic acid administration on the bile acid composition of bile or luminal content 
have been studied in healthy volunteers and in patients with gallstones or liver disease; all 
investigated subjects had an overtly normal bile acid metabolism. The administered dose was 
15 mg/kg per day in two of the studies and 4.7-11.6 mg/day in another, while it was 750 mg/day in 
the fourth, which is a comparable dose. In all studies, cholic acid administration shifted the relative 
composition of bile or intestinal luminal content in the direction of cholic acid and its metabolite 
deoxycholic acid, while reducing the relative amount of chenodeoxycholic acid (Toouli et al. 1975; 
Einarsson and Grundy 1980; Ahlberg et al. 1981; Woollett et al. 2004). Given the available data on the 
regulation of primary bile acid synthesis, it is apparent that the reduction in chenodeoxycholic acid and 
its metabolites is due to a repression of primary bile acid synthesis by the administered cholic acid.  
In contrast to the changes in bile composition observed in the above studies, cholic acid treatment of 
patients with primary biliary cirrhosis did not alter the relative concentrations of bile acids in serum 
(Güldütuna et al. 1993). Absolute bile acid concentrations were however increased to more than two-
fold normal level. This is in line with the strong increase of primary bile acid pool size upon oral 
administration of cholic acid or chenodeoxycholic acid to healthy volunteers (Woollett et al. 2004). 
In the case of children affected by primary bile acid synthesis deficiency, the rationale for therapeutic 
approach is that oral administration of cholic acid, the substance missing in an affected patient, will 
inhibit endogenous production of hepatotoxic bile acids precursors produced as a consequence of the 
inborn error by down-regulating cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the rate limiting enzyme in bile acid 
synthesis (Setchell and O’Connell 2007). In addition, cholic acid will provide a stimulus for bile flow

facilitating the hepatic clearance of toxic bile acid precursors and toxic substances, including bilirubin. 
Furthermore, cholic acid therapy will improve growth by facilitating fat-soluble vitamins and fat 
absorption. 
Secondary pharmacology 
The aim of a cholic acid therapy is to restore a normal bile acid physiology. Once a stable 
enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is established, patients with 3β-HSD deficiency or Δ4-3-oxoR 
deficiency treated with cholic acid do not differ physiologically from normal healthy subjects in a 
significant way. The only difference is that the amount of primary bile acids that is endogenously 
synthesized in hepatocytes of normal healthy subjects to continuously replenish the bile acid pool is 
replaced by orally administered cholic acid, i.e. one of the two physiological primary bile acids. 
No human or animal studies were identified describing secondary pharmacological effects of cholic 
acid. No secondary pharmacological effects in the classical sense are expected for this endogenous 
substance, but there may be important functions of bile acids next to their role in the absorption of 
nutrients in the intestine and the autoregulation of their biosynthesis from cholesterol that are the 
primary pharmacodynamic action of cholic acid in the treatment of inborn errors of primary bile acid 
synthesis due to 3β-HSD or Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency. Safety pharmacology studies demonstrated effects 
on cardiac function only at 100 to 1000-fold the endogenous cholic acid concentration. Repeated-dose 
toxicology studies do not provide evidence for pharmacologic or toxic action of cholic acid outside the 
organs of the enterohepatic circulation. The absence of studies investigating secondary 
pharmacological effects of cholic acid is therefore considered acceptable.  
3.4.4.  Discussion and conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Cholic acid has been studied in the literature in terms of its kinetics and dynamics, and to a lesser 
degree as an exogenous pharmacological agent. In this regard a pharmacokinetic study with Orphacol 
could have been useful. However, as cholic acid has been used for many years as a therapeutic agent 
this is not seen as necessary. Its pharmacokinetic characteristics, including its metabolism, are 
different from that of a conventional synthetic small molecule pharmaceutical in that once 
administered, any exogenously administered cholic acid will behave like an endogenous molecule in all 
respects. Therefore data on the kinetics and dynamics of endogenous cholic acid provides relevant 
information on the clinical pharmacology of Orphacol. In patients with 3β-HSD deficiency or Δ4-3-oxoR 
deficiency, orally administered cholic acid acts to replace the missing endogenous primary bile acids 
both in terms of their physiological functions and their metabolic regulation. 
Cholic acid, a primary bile acid, is partially absorbed in the ileum. The remaining part is transformed by 
reduction of the 7α-hydroxy group to deoxycholic acid by intestinal bacteria. Deoxycholic acid is a 
secondary bile acid. More than 90 % of the primary and secondary bile acids are reabsorbed in the 
ileum by a specific active transporter and are recycled to the liver by the portal vein; the remainder is 
excreted in the faeces. A small fraction of bile acids is excreted in urine. No pharmacokinetic study 
data for Orphacol are available. This is acceptable as cholic acid has been used for many years as a 
therapeutic agent. 
The preparations of cholic acid used in many of the submitted case reports were not Orphacol. 
However, the Applicant has provided adequate explanation and evidence which show similarity 
between the formulation used in the past in some publications and the formulation that is intended for 
marketing.

Cholic acid is the predominant primary bile acid in man. In patients with inborn deficiency of 
3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase and Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase, the biosynthesis of 
primary bile acids is reduced or absent. In the absence of treatment, unphysiologic cholestatic and 
hepatotoxic bile acid metabolites are predominant in the liver, serum and urine. The rational basis for 
treatment consists of restoration of the bile acid-dependent component of bile flow enabling restoration 
of biliary secretion and biliary elimination of toxic metabolites; inhibition of the production of the toxic 
bile acid metabolites by negative feedback on cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, which is the rate-limiting 
enzyme in bile acid synthesis; and improvement of the patient’s nutritional status by correcting 
intestinal malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. 
No data are available for patients with renal impairment. The dose of cholic acid should be adjusted 
individually. Limited data are available for patients with minor to severe hepatic impairment related to 
3β-HSD or Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency. Patients are expected to present with some degree of hepatic 
impairment at diagnosis, which improves under cholic acid therapy. The dose of cholic acid should be 
adjusted individually. No experience exists in patients with hepatic impairment from causes other than 
3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency or Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency and 
no dose recommendation can be given. Patients with hepatic impairment should be monitored closely. 
Patients with newly diagnosed or a family history of familial hypertriglyceridemia are expected to 
poorly absorb cholic acid in the intestine. The cholic acid dose for patients with familial 
hypertriglyceridemia will have to be established and adjusted as described, but an elevated dose, 
notably higher than the 500 mg daily limit for adult patients, may be required and safe. 
The effect of food on cholic acid bioavailability has not been studied. Empirically it is recommended to 
take the product with food. There is a theoretical possibility that administration with food may increase 
cholic acid bioavailability and improve tolerability.  
Phenobarbital antagonises the effect of cholic acid. Use of phenobarbital with cholic acid is therefore 
contraindicated. Alternative treatments should be used. Ciclosporin alters the pharmacokinetics of 
cholic acid by inhibition of the hepatic uptake and hepatobiliary secretion of bile acids, as well as its 
pharmacodynamics by inhibition of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase. Co-administration should be avoided. If 
administration of ciclosporin is considered necessary, serum and urine bile acid levels should be closely 
monitored and the cholic acid dose adjusted accordingly. Bile acid sequestrants and certain antacids 
bind bile acids and lead to their elimination. Administration of these medicinal products is expected to 
reduce the effect of cholic acid. The dose of bile acid sequestrants or antacids must be separated from 
the dose of cholic acid by an interval of 5 hours, regardless of which medicinal product is administered 
first. 
3.5.  Clinical efficacy  
The Applicant submitted a total of 38 patient reports involving confirmed or suspected 3β-HSD and 11 
involving Δ4-3-oxoR deficiencies. Of the 38 patients with 3β-HSD deficiency, 21 were treated with 
cholic acid, 8 were treated with other bile acids and 9 did not receive bile acids. Of the 11 patients with 
Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency, 7 were treated with cholic acid, 3 were treated with other bile acids and 1 
patient received no treatment. 
3.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose response study has been performed or reported in the literature regarding the use of cholic 
acid. The following analysis relevant to dosing recommendations was provided.

Bile acid dosing for all patients has been established empirically for each patient based on the 
normalisation of urine and serum bile acids as measured by FAB-MS, electrospray tandem-MS (LC-
MS/MS) and/or GC-MS. Specifically, patients with 3β-HSD deficiency were monitored for the levels of 
3β,7α-dihydroxy- and 3β,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5-cholenoic acids and patients with Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency 
for the levels of 3-oxo-7α-hydroxy-4-cholenoic and 3-oxo-7α,l2α-dihydroxy-4-cholenoic acids as well 
as of allo bile acids. Dosing information for 13 long-time surviving patients with 3β-HSD deficiency is 
available (Gonzales et al. 2009). Cholic acid was administered either in combination with 
ursodeoxycholic acid for 6 months in the context of a therapeutic protocol for 6 patients, or alone as 
replacement of ursodeoxycholic acid for 7 patients. All 13 patients are now treated with cholic acid 
alone. One patient (Su) (Table 4) was treated with cholic acid monotherapy, but the duration of 
treatment is not available (Subramaniam et al. 2010). 
Patient Wi (Table 4) was treated with cholic acid, then chenodeoxycholic acid, and subsequently with a 
combination of cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid, but no data about dosing 
schedule and dosage are available. Patients MU2 and AB were last treated with cholic acid but no 
information about dosage and duration are available (Table 4). 
Combination treatment associating cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid was reported to be 
administered to patient Kob (Table 4), at doses of 120 mg and 400 mg per day respectively, and to 5 
patients at a dose of 7 mg/kg per day each (Kobayashi et al. 2000; Subramaniam et al. 2010). 
For patient AB (Table 4), combination treatment was given in equal doses of cholic acid and 
chenodeoxycholic acid. Latest data available for patient AB indicate that she is now under cholic acid 
monotherapy; however no further details about dosage are provided. For patients described by 
(Gonzales et al. 2009), dose of ursodeoxycholic acid in mg/kg is not available, and comparison with 
dose of cholic acid is difficult.  
Average weight-based daily doses for cholic acid in monotherapy were 12.9 mg/kg (range: 2.3-
18.9 mg/kg) at the initiation of treatment and of 5.5 mg/kg (range: 2.5 – 9.8 mg/kg) after long-term 
maintenance (Table 2), with the patients increasing in age and weight over the time of treatment.

At the beginning of treatment (Gonzales et al. 2009; Subramaniam et al. 2010) the dose of cholic acid 
had to be increased once in 6 patients, twice in 1 patient, and several times in 1 patient in order to

achieve optimal response to treatment. The daily dose of cholic acid was increased when the 
concentrations of atypical metabolites in urine increased, an indication of poor feedback inhibition on 
cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase. Oppositely, the dose of cholic acid was decreased in 4 patients because of 
signs of overdose (increases in serum GGT and ALT; pruritus, diarrhoea and increased total serum bile 
acids in one patient). Good response to treatment without dose adjustment was obtained for 2 
patients.  
In a study by Riello et al. (2010) patients with 3β-HSD deficiency were treated with a combination of 
chenodeoxycholic and ursodeoxycholic acid. Data provides valuable insight on dose titration in function 
of body weight and metabolic response that are equally applicable to cholic acid therapy. Patients were 
started on 5 mg/kg each of ursodeoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid (3 patients) or 10 mg/kg 
each (1 patient) or 7.5 mg/kg each (1 patient). As patients were all infants or children, their rapid 
growth led to a drop of the relative (weight-based) dose while the absolute dose was constant. In most 
cases (4/5), this led to increases in urinary 3β-hydroxylated-Δ5 bile acid metabolites and the need to 
adjust the absolute dose so that the previous weight-based dose was restored. Under the dose of 
5/5 mg/kg of ursodeoxycholic acid / chenodeoxycholic acid, the levels of urinary 3β-hydroxylated-Δ5 
bile acid metabolites dropped again (data for 3 patients). One patient was temporarily well-controlled 
on a 3/3 mg/kg dose, but subsequently (after 20 months) needed uptitration to 5/5 mg/kg for 
metabolic control. This illustrates the need for regular control of metabolic control by urine analysis of 
3β-hydroxylated-Δ5 bile acid metabolites. The same titration principle applies in cholic acid 
monotherapy. 
Data on the starting doses in Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency are similar to the 3β-HSD deficiency. Bile acid 
dosing for all patients has been established empirically based on metabolic response also taking into 
consideration in this case that most patients additionally received ursodeoxycholic or chenodeoxycholic 
acid (Table 3).

Younger and lighter patients appear to require and tolerate higher doses per body weight than older 
children. This is in agreement with the observation that infants and children have about 40% larger 
cholic acid pool sizes than adults on a per m2 basis, and the cholic acid turnover rate decreases each 
by about 40% between infants and children, and between children and adults (Heubi et al. 1982).

Overall, no formal dose response studies have been performed. The posology is based on the previous 
clinical experience with patients’ response to bile acids including cholic acid. The individual dose for 
each patient was established based on the normalisation of urine and serum bile acids as measured by 
FAB-MS, LC-MS/MS and/or GC-MS. The lowest dose of cholic acid that leads to an elimination of the 
metabolites from the urine should be chosen for maintenance. The starting daily cholic acid dose in 
3β-HSD deficiency was on average 12.3 mg/kg (see Table 2); similarly, a starting daily dose of 4 mg 
cholic acid which was increased to 8 mg/kg after one month was reported, as was a starting daily dose 
of the combination of 7 mg/kg each of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid (Subramaniam et al. 
2010). Data on the starting doses in Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency are similar (Table 3), taking into 
consideration that in addition most patients received ursodeoxycholic or chenodeoxycholic acid. This 
therapeutic approach, based on the effect of treatment following the use of various dosing regimen, is 
endorsed and leads to the recommendation that therapy should be initiated with a starting dose of 5-
15 mg/kg per day, with regular monitoring thereafter. Urinary bile acid analyses by FAB-MS, LC-
MS/MS and/or GC-MS are complemented by serum bile acid and liver function tests to verify the 
normalisation of liver biology, and to monitor for possible overdosage indicated by elevated serum bile 
acids and GGT and/or transaminases.  
3.5.2.  Main Case reports 
Overview of cases reports for 3β-HSD deficiency 
The cases reports investigating the efficacy of bile acid therapy, including cholic acid therapy, in the 
treatment of 3β-HSD deficiency originate principally from the Jacquemin Group at Bicêtre Hospital, Le-
Kremlin Bicêtre, France (Jacquemin et al. 1994; Jacquemin et al. 2000; Potin et al. 2001; Gonzales 
2006; Gonzales et al. 2009) and the Setchell group at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, 
Cincinatti, USA (Setchell et al. 1990; Balistreri 1991; Setchell et al. 1991; Witzleben et al. 1992; 
Balistreri 1999; Cheng et al. 2003; Bove et al. 2004; Setchell 2004; Setchell and Heubi 2006; Heubi et 
al. 2007), with additional reports from the United Kingdom (Clayton et al. 1987; Clayton 1991; Horslen 
et al. 1992; Akobeng et al. 1999), Sweden (Ichimiya et al. 1990; Ichimiya et al. 1991; Fischler et al. 
2007), the Netherlands (Vanderpas et al. 1987) and Japan (Kobayashi et al. 2000; Yamato et al. 
2001). These studies provide data on a group of 38 confirmed and suspected patients, 21 of which 
have been treated with cholic acid. 
The large majority of the patients for which detailed data on cholic acid treatment are available come 
from the population studied at Bicêtre Hospital. The remainder of the European patient population 
comes from centres in the United Kingdom and Sweden. Most patients described in the literature have 
undergone treatment with several different bile acids and/or bile acid combinations during the 
establishment of their diagnosis and over the history of the establishment of cholic acid as the 
treatment of choice (Kobayashi et al. 2000; Gonzales et al. 2009). The identification of cholic acid as 
the treatment of choice was made empirically, taking into account the knowledge of bile acid 
physiology and toxicology and the availability of preparations of different bile acids. 
Demographics of patient with 3β-HSD deficiency 
The exact number of 3β-HSD deficiency patients described in the literature is difficult to determine. 
This number can be estimated to be 43 patients, including the 38 patients described in Table 4, one 
patient described in Bove et al. 2004 and four patients described in Cheng et al. 2003. Out of the 38 
patients, 21 were treated with cholic acid, 8 were treated with other bile acids, and 9 were not treated 
with bile acids.

This population represents the entire population reported in the literature. It thus represents the 
known spectrum of disease manifestations. Generally, patients presented in infancy or early childhood 
with jaundice, cholestasis, steatorrhoea and hepatomegaly together with symptoms of fat-soluble 
vitamin deficiency such as rickets (vitamin D) or bleeding (vitamin K). Bilirubin and transaminases 
were several-fold above the normal range, while GGT was normal. Urinary bile acid excretion was 
strongly increased and consisted of (sulphated) 3β,7α-dihydroxy-5-cholenoic acid and 3β,7α,12α- 
trihydroxy-5-cholenoic acid while the primary bile acids at low or undetectable levels. In liver histology, 
hepatocellular and canalicular cholestasis with giant-cell transformation, fibrosis and inflammation was 
reported in the majority of the patients. It should be noted that the patients on the low end of the 
ranges or with milder disease symptoms were frequently younger siblings. The baseline characteristics 
of the patients are summarised in Table 5.

While this patient population represents all patients who are reported in the literature, it was 
questioned whether this could be considered representative of the true patient population in the 
European Union due to reporting bias and the strong representation of the Bicêtre Hospital population. 
Given the extreme rarity of the condition and the sophisticated technology needed for the diagnosis, it 
may not be properly diagnosed in all countries, from which then publications are missing. In addition it 
cannot be excluded that there are patients with milder clinical deficiencies who may survive without 
therapy (4 patients with 3β-HSD deficiency were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis through family 
screening - Riello et al. 2010; Subramaniam et al. 2010), similar to the late-detected cases reported 
by Kobayashi et al. 2000 and Fischler et al. 2007. These patients may not be detected or reported in 
the literature but could still benefit from cholic acid treatment to avoid long-term sub-clinical liver 
damage (Subramaniam et al. 2010).  
The number of patients in the EU affected by 3β-HSD deficiency and Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency is currently 
estimated to be a total 90 patients (approximately 75 patients with 3β-HSD deficiency and 
approximately 15 patients with Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency) based on the observed incidence over the last 15 
years in France and the United Kingdom (Gonzales et al. 2009; Subramaniam et al. 2010). Considering 
incidence, at Bicêtre Hospital in France, approximately 1 patient per year with 3β-HSD deficiency (13

patients) or Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency (2 patients, twins) has been diagnosed over the last 15 years; 4 of 
these patients came from Member States other than France (i.e. Italy and Portugal). A very similar 
rate of diagnosis of 16 patients with 3β-HSD deficiency of domestic origin in 16 years has been 
reported from the United Kingdom by Subramaniam et al. 2010. The population treated at the 
reporting centres is not limited to the local population, but extends to other European and non-
European countries. The Bicêtre Hospital population includes patients from France (including of Roma 
origin), Italy, Portugal, Algeria and one adopted child from Chile, while the UK population includes 
predominantly Middle Eastern and Asian patients. In addition, the dose range used in the reported 
treated patient population (Table 2) together with the age range of onset (Table 4) described indicate 
a wide range of severities of the enzymatic defect. 
Therefore, within the limitations of the small sample size, the diversity of the population described 
combined with the wide spectrum of disease severity (showed by the range of dose used) reflects the 
complete scientific knowledge on the patient population. Thus, the reported patient population can be 
considered to be reasonably representative of the entire patient population in the EU. 
Treatments 
From the literature patients were treated with combinations of chenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic 
acid and cholic acid. Treatment modalities were different for all patients due to the fact that cholic acid 
treatment was frequently unavailable for a certain period of time and that treatment algorithms were 
only established based on these patients and their individual responses. At the time of last reporting 
19 patients were today under treatment with cholic acid alone, 2 patients were last reported to be 
treated with cholic acid in combination with chenodeoxycholic acid or with chenodeoxycholic acid and 
ursodeoxycholic acid, and 8 patients were under monotherapy with chenodeoxycholic acid or 
ursodeoxycholic acid alone (Table 6).

Setchell 2004, who had at the time of publication about 20 years of experience in using the treatment 
with cholic acid, stresses the fact that monotherapy with cholic acid is now the strategy of choice for 
the treatment of 3β-HSD deficiency. The recent article of Gonzales et al. 2009 states that, at the 
present time, all new patients diagnosed with 3β-HSD deficiency are directly treated with cholic acid 
monotherapy and that all followed-up patients are treated with cholic acid alone. A similar statement is 
also provided by Setchell (Setchell 2004; Setchell and Heubi 2006) who add that the efficacy of cholic 
acid is greatest when cholic acid is given alone. 
Overall, although patients were treated on different combinations, it appears that patients previously 
treated with ursodeoxycholic acid were transferred to cholic acid and newly diagnosed patients were

commenced on cholic acid. Cholic acid monotherapy appears as the current treatment of choice for 
patients with 3β-HSD deficiency. 
Method of assessing efficacy for the 3β-HSD and Δ4-3-oxoR deficiencies 
Most patients described in the literature have undergone treatment with several different bile acids 
and/or bile acid combinations during the establishment of their diagnosis and over the history of the 
establishment of cholic acid as the treatment of choice (Kobayashi et al. 2000; Gonzales et al. 2009). 
The identification of cholic acid as the treatment of choice is made empirically, taking into account the 
knowledge of bile acid physiology and toxicology, and based on the availability of bile acids 
preparations. Therefore, these other active treatments represent internal controls. From a 
methodological point of view, many of the case reports can essentially be evaluated as open-label, 
non-randomised n-of-1 studies. Additionally, several cases of siblings that died early in infancy when 
diagnosis and treatment were not available are reported in the literature, and the symptoms of these 
siblings were highly suggestive of 3β-HSD or Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency (Clayton et al. 1987; Clayton et al. 
1988; Fischler et al. 2007; Gonzales et al. 2009). The untreated siblings represent a historic control 
group. 
A limitation of the unplanned, unsystematic and incomplete retrospective collection and documentation 
of treatment data in the literature is that a statistically rigorous meta-analysis of the results is 
impossible. However, few individual publications evaluate statistically the data of groups of patients in 
descriptive terms (Potin et al. 2001; Setchell 2004; Gonzales et al. 2009). The published data on the 
efficacy of cholic acid in the treatment of both deficiencies vary to a great degree in terms of the 
captured parameters, time points of their capture and their representation in the publications. A 
systematic review or statistically sound meta-analysis of the data is not possible. Nevertheless, a 
number of clinically relevant parameters are presented in some cases. The evaluation of the clinical 
efficacy of cholic acid takes the following endpoints into account:  
•  Overall survival on therapy (need for a liver transplantation is considered treatment failure) 
• 
• 
Liver function as assayed through biochemical test for transaminases and bilirubin 
Liver histology 
•  Serum and urinary bile acids 
Liver function tests (ALT, AST, GGT, coagulation time) and histology are validated markers for hepatic 
function in these patients and provide a short and medium-term parameter of the efficacy. Liver 
function tests are objective markers not subject to investigator bias. These endpoints, with the 
exception of liver histology, are categorical or numerical and not subject to investigator evaluation 
bias. A reporting bias for unfavourable results cannot be excluded however all parameters for 
evaluation are causally linked, and therefore should evolve in concert over time, diminishing the 
impact and likelihood of reporting bias. 
Efficacy results in patients with 3β-HSD Deficiency 
Survival 
The key clinical consideration in the treatment of patients with 3β-HSD deficiency is overall survival. 
Data from untreated siblings of patients with 3β-HSD deficiency show that this defect is lethal in 
infants if untreated (Table 2). An estimation of the rate of lethal disease is not possible due to 
reporting bias. Three children (including patients JU and MU1, siblings of MU2) died before they could 
be effectively treated (gastrointestinal haemorrhage at 19 months and acute abdominal haemorrhage 
following liver biopsy at 3.75 years of age, whereas the third died from end-stage liver disease at the 
Assessment report

age of 4.6 years) (Clayton et al. 1987; Subramaniam et al. 2010). All siblings of patients A, C and D1 
and D2 died from liver failure prior to or at the age of 6 (Gonzales 2006). Patient Fi had two older 
siblings who died from progressive cholestatic liver disease, at 11 years for the girl and at the age of 6 
months for the boy (Fischler et al. 2007). Patient Fi, however, survived to adulthood (26 years) 
without treatment. It was suggested that low level of sulphation of the abnormal trihydroxy bile acid 
formed as a result of enzyme deficiency may be of importance for survival (Fischler et al. 2007).  
Patients treated with cholic acid, alone or in combination with chenodeoxycholic acid or 
ursodeoxycholic acid, have survived long-term with at least 12.9 years of survival clearly documented 
in the literature (Gonzales et al. 2009; Subramaniam et al. 2010). According to the literature, patient J 
stopped his treatment at the age of 5 years (Gonzales 2006) and has not resumed treatment for at 
least 3 years (patient J is not mentioned in (Gonzales et al. 2009). Survival of patient MU2 for at least 
16 years is clear from the fact that his case is described in 1987 and 2003 (Clayton et al. 1987; Cheng 
et al. 2003). Exceptions are patients Lc and Mc who did not respond to cholic acid and ursodeoxycholic 
acid, respectively, probably because of extensive liver damage before diagnosis. Bile acid therapy was 
unsuccessful. Both had to undergo orthotopic liver transplantation (Cheng et al. 2003). Overall, among 
the 22 patients reported in the literature as treated with cholic acid in monotherapy, data describe 
successful long-term treatment of 15 patients (Gonzales et al. 2009; Subramaniam et al. 2010). 
Patient MU2 was lost to follow-up, but available data suggest successful treatment with cholic acid. 
Only one treatment failure occurred under cholic acid therapy (Patient Mc). The patient had to undergo 
liver transplantation (Table 4).  
Liver Function 
Cholic acid treatment has avoided the need for a liver transplant in at least 3 patients. Two patients did 
not respond to primary bile acid therapy, 1 under cholic acid and the other under ursodeoxycholic acid, 
both probably because of extensive liver damage before diagnosis. Both had to undergo orthotopic 
liver transplantation (Cheng et al. 2003). Among all cholic-acid treated patients reported in the 
literature the above-mentioned patient is the only one who needed a liver transplant; all other patients 
recovered under cholic acid therapy.  
Liver function tests have consistently been reported as improved on treatments containing cholic acid. 
Unfortunately, the data reported in the literature use very uneven reporting time points and sampling 
intervals, or are represented only as graphical data with no access to exact numerical values. The 
tabulations in the following compile the available data. Data are mainly extracted from Gonzales 2006; 
Gonzales et al. 2009. 
Liver transaminases are consistently reported as decreasing under cholic acid treatment. They can be 
extremely elevated without any treatment (up to 30-fold ULN), but decrease to the normal range 
within 1-8 months of cholic acid treatment (Potin et al. 2001; Setchell 2004). Values for ALT and GGT 
are more consistently reported in the publications at time of diagnosis, however, the data reported for 
follow-up are limited and uneven reporting time points and sampling intervals are used (Table 7).

Setchell 2004 reports data for 25 patients. For these patients, cholic acid therapy allowed a return to 
normal values for both AST and ALT in about 5 months and over up to 5 years of treatment. 
Transaminases returned to normal for patient AB described in (Clayton 1991) within one year under 
treatment with cholic acid in combination with chenodeoxycholic acid. An important and rapid 
improvement in transaminase level is also reported for patient Wi under treatment with cholic acid in 
combination with chenodeoxycholic and ursodeoxycholic acid (Witzleben et al. 1992). 
GGT is reported as being in the normal range or slightly elevated in patients with 3β-HSD Deficiency. 
Under therapy with cholic acid, transient increases in GGT have been reported (Gonzales E. 2006 and 
Gonzales et al. 2009). These may be indicative of a supratherapeutic bile acid dose, as they returned 
to normal after reduction in cholic acid dose. 
Total bilirubin and direct bilirubin are consistently reported to decrease under cholic acid treatment. 
They can be extremely elevated at baseline in patients with 3β-HSD deficiency (up to 15-fold ULN), but 
usually decrease to the normal range during treatment. There is no clear indication of the time for 
normalisation available from the literature. Values for total bilirubin are most consistently reported in 
the publications (Table 8).

Plasma bilirubin returned to normal for patient AB described in (Clayton 1991) within one year under 
treatment with cholic acid in combination with chenodeoxycholic acid. For patient Kob, total bilirubin 
levels was reported to be reduced under treatment with cholic acid alone and further reduced under 
treatment with cholic acid in combination with chenodeoxycholic acid (Kobayashi et al. 2000). A rapid 
improvement in bilirubin level is reported for patient Wi under treatment with cholic acid in 
combination with chenodeoxycholic and ursodeoxycholic acid (Witzleben et al. 1992). 
Liver Histology 
While liver histology data before the initiation of treatment are available from all bile-acid treated 
patients, follow-up data are limited to 10 patients described in Gonzales 2006; Gonzales et al. 2009, 4 
patients described in Subramaniam et al. 2010 and patient Wi described by Witzleben et al. 1992; the 
latter 5 patients have been treated with cholic acid in combination with other bile acids. All show a 
resolved liver pathology. Mild fibrosis remained in 9 patients.  
Serum and Urinary Bile Acids

While urinary and/or serum bile acid data before the initiation of treatment are available from almost 
all bile-acid treated patients, follow-up data are limited to patients described in Gonzales et al. 2009 
and in Kobayashi et al. 2000.  
In patients described in Gonzales et al. 2009, urinary atypical 3βΟΗ−Δ5 bile acids initially were present 
at high levels, and strongly decreased under cholic acid therapy, without completely disappearing 
(Table 9). Total urinary bile acids were initially very high, consistent with cholestasis, but with low 
levels of the normal primary bile acids, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. The excretion was 
mainly made of atypical metabolites characteristic of 3β-HSD deficiency. 
Under cholic acid therapy, there was a significant decrease in 3βΟΗ−Δ5 bile acids and of total urinary 
bile acid excretion, indicating an improvement of cholestasis. In 5 patients, evaluation of these 
parameters under ursodeoxycholic acid alone showed an improvement but full metabolic control could 
not be achieved under ursodeoxycholic acid alone (Jacquemin et al. 1994). In patient Kob, 
ursodeoxycholic acid (150 mg/day) treatment did not lead to a significant decrease in the amount of 
abnormal bile acids in urine. In the same patient, chenodeoxycholic acid treatment (400 mg/day) 
lowered the amount of abnormal bile acids in the urine, but further reduction was achieved under 
combined therapy of chenodeoxycholic acid (400 mg/day) and cholic acid (120 mg/day).

Disappearance of the atypical bile acids from urine under cholic acid therapy in 25 patients described 
by Setchell 2004 was achieved within one week. Total serum bile acid concentrations remained normal 
under cholic acid treatment, with cholic acid comprising 40% and its metabolite deoxycholic acid 
comprising 35% of the total serum bile acids (Gonzales et al. 2009). 
Vitamin Malabsorption 
Various combinations of deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins have been reported at baseline in 13 
patients described in Gonzales et al. 2009. They were detected biochemically or manifested as 
coagulatopathy (Vitamin K), lack of deep tendon reflexes (Vitamin E) and rickets (Vitamin D). These 
deficiencies have been treated by parenteral administration or oral supplementation of vitamins. Levels 
of vitamin A were reported to be above normal for 5 patients.  
In patients described by Gonzales et al. 2009, levels of serum vitamin E remained normal under cholic 
acid treatment after vitamin E supplements were stopped. Patient A was reported to no longer require 
vitamin K supplementation on ursodeoxycholic acid therapy. No details are provided as whether 
supplementation was stopped under cholic acid for the other patients. 
Persistence of Efficacy and/or Tolerance Effects 
Long-term efficacy data for 13 patients with 3β-HSD deficiency are available. Treatment has been 
closely documented for 5 to more than 12 years in patients described by Gonzales et al. 2009. There is 
no report in the literature on a loss of efficacy. A need to increase the dose over time would be 
indicative of loss of efficacy with insufficient control of serum and urine bile acid concentrations or

transaminase levels. No such event was reported in the literature. No patients have been reported to 
have ended cholic acid treatment. 
Lack of Efficacy 
Kobayashi et al. 2000 report in a patient with 3β-HSD deficiency that cholic acid (120 mg/day in a 22-
year-old Japanese patient) lacked efficacy in lowering the patient’s urinary abnormal bile acids. Total 
bilirubin was however found to be decreased. The authors however noted that the amount of cholic 
acid administered was probably insufficient. Combined therapy with cholic acid (120 mg/day) and 
chenodeoxycholic acid (400 mg/day) restored total bilirubin levels to within 2-fold ULN and reduced 
abnormal bile acids. One treatment failure in 1 patient under cholic acid treatment is also reported by 
Cheng et al. 2003 but was attributed to pre-existing liver damage. The patient had to undergo liver 
transplantation after an unspecified treatment time. 
Overview of cases reports for the Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency 
Studies investigating the efficacy of bile acid therapy, including cholic acid therapy, in the treatment of 
Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency originate principally from three sources: the Jacquemin Group at Bicêtre Hospital, 
Le-Kremlin Bicêtre, France (Potin et al. 2001; Gonzales et al. 2004; Gonzales et al. 2009), the Clayton 
group at UCL Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom (Clayton et al. 1996; Lemonde et al. 
2003; Palermo et al. 2008), and the Setchell group at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, 
Cincinatti, USA (Setchell et al. 1988; Balistreri 1991; Setchell et al. 1991; Daugherty et al. 1993; 
Balistreri 1999; Bove et al. 2004). These studies provide data on a group of a total 11 patients, 7 of 
which have been treated with cholic acid.  
Demographics of patient with Δ4-3-oxoR Deficiency 
The literature contains reports on a total of 7 patients with Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency who have been 
treated with cholic acid and of 3 patients who have been treated with other bile acids. 1 patient 
received no treatment. The demographic characteristics of these patients are summarised in Table 10.

This population represents the entire population reported in the literature. It thus represents the 
known spectrum of disease manifestations. Generally, patients presented at the neonatal period or in 
early infancy with jaundice, cholestasis, hepatomegaly and steatorrhoea, together with symptoms of 
fat-soluble vitamin deficiency such as rickets (vitamin D). Pruritus was absent. Bilirubin and 
transaminases were more than 10-fold above the normal range, while GGT was normal or slightly 
elevated. Urinary bile acid excretion was strongly increased and consisted of 7α-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-
cholenoic and 7α,12α-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid, while the primary bile acids were at low or 
undetectable levels. In liver histology, hepatocellular and canalicular cholestasis, giant hepatocytes, 
necrosis, fibrosis, extramedullary haematopoiesis and inflammation were reported in the majority of 
the patients. 
Efficacy of cholic acid treatment Δ4-3-oxoR Deficiency has been assessed using the same methods and 
parameters as for 3β-HSD deficiency as detailed above.

Treatments 
Treatment modalities of all patients were different due to the fact that treatment algorithms were only 
established based on these patients and their individual responses. The treatment with bile acids of all 
patients are summarised in Table 12.

Efficacy results in patients with Δ4-3-oxoR Deficiency 
Survival 
The key clinical consideration in the treatment of patients with inborn errors of primary bile acid 
synthesis due to Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency is overall survival. Data from an untreated sibling of patients 
with Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency show that this defect can be lethal at the infant age if untreated (Table 10).  
On the other hand, the patients reported in the literature that were treated with cholic acid, alone or in 
combination with chenodeoxycholic acid or ursodeoxycholic acid, have survived long-term. Patients 14 
(J) and 15 (J) are alive to date after 12 years of treatment, at least 10.7 of which are documented in 
the literature (Gonzales et al. 2009). Survival of patients 2a/2b for at least 14 years and of patient 3 
for 12 years is clear from the fact that their cases are discussed by (Setchell et al. 1988; Bove et al. 
2004) without any report to the contrary. Patient MS has been reported to have stopped her treatment 
the age of 10 after 9-10 years of treatment and has not resumed treatment for at least 3 years; she 
was reported alive and healthy at the age of 13 (Palermo et al. 2008).  
The sole exception is patient BH who did not respond to a combination treatment with 
chenodeoxycholic acid and was reported surviving with a liver transplant (Lemonde et al. 2003). This 
therefore represents the only documented case (out of 7) where a bile acid therapy containing cholic 
acid did not lead to progression-free survival. However, in this patient no efforts to optimise therapy 
are reported. The patient also presented with very high ALT and elevated GGT, indicating substantial

hepatic damage already at the initiation of treatment. The patient may also not have tolerated the 
chenodeoxycholic acid included in the regimen. 
Data from four patients (14 (J), 15 (J), MS and RM) show that treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid 
monotherapy is ineffective in halting disease progression. Patient 5 improved substantially during a 
total of 8 months of ursodeoxycholic acid and subsequently stopped treatment (Ueki et al. 2008). This 
patient is different from the others in that only a heterozygous mutation in the coding region of the 
SRD5B1 gene was found; no data on the level of expression of the Δ4-3-oxoR protein is available. The 
patient’s mother, with the same defective allele, survived to adulthood. Taken together, these data 
indicate a milder phenotype in this patient. 
Patient 6, also with a heterozygous mutation in the coding region of the SRD5B1 gene, showed initial 
improvement on chenodeoxycholic acid monotherapy, but liver function subsequently deteriorated and 
the patient was referred for liver transplantation (Ueki et al. 2008). As for patient BH, this may 
indicate a poor tolerance of chenodeoxycholic acid. 
Liver Function 
Among all 7 cholic-acid treated patients reported in the literature, 1 patient needed a liver transplant; 
all other patients recovered under cholic acid or combination therapy.  
Liver function tests have consistently been reported as improved in patients with Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency 
on treatments containing cholic acid. Unfortunately, the data reported in the literature use very uneven 
reporting time points and sampling intervals. Liver transaminases are consistently reported to decrease 
under cholic acid treatment. They can be extremely elevated without any treatment (up to 30-fold 
ULN), but drop to the normal range within about 12 months. Values for ALT are most consistently 
reported in the publications (Table 13).

There is a transient increase in transaminases observed at the initiation of treatment with cholic acid 
and chenodeoxycholic acid. This increase may have occurred without having been reported in all 
patients. GGT is reported as being in the normal range or slightly elevated (patient MS) before 
treatment. Under therapy with cholic acid (patient 14 (J)) or a combination of cholic acid and 
chenodeoxycholic acid (patient MS), transient increases in GGT have been reported. These may be 
indicative of a supratherapeutic bile acid dose. 
Total bilirubin and direct bilirubin are consistently reported to decrease under cholic acid treatment. 
They can be extremely elevated at baseline in patients with Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency without any 
treatment (up to 18-fold ULN), but drop to the normal range within about 12 months. Values for total 
bilirubin are most consistently reported in the publications (Table 14).

Liver Histology 
While liver histology data before the initiation of treatment are available from all bile-acid treated 
patients, follow-up data are limited to only 5 patients. All show a resolved liver pathology (Table 15) 
except for fibrosis (mild or septal) that remained in all patients as a result of the earlier hepatic injury, 
except in patient 3 who had been treated from 1 week after birth.

Serum and Urinary Bile Acids 
While urinary and/or serum bile acid data before the initiation of treatment are available from all bile-
acid treated patients, follow-up data are limited to patients 14 (J), 15 (J), 2a and 2b. Unfortunately, 
data are not presented in a comparable way, as the bases of reporting are different (percent values vs. 
absolute values). Total urinary bile acids were initially very high. In these patients, urinary Δ4-3-oxo 
bile acids initially were present at high levels, and strongly decreased under cholic acid and 
ursodeoxycholic acid therapy, without completely disappearing. Under cholic acid therapy, urinary total 
bile acids were further decreased. Data on serum bile acids are available for patients 2a and 2b; allo- 
and Δ4-3-oxo bile acids initially were present at high levels (2a: 52.18 and 2b: 37.26 μmol/L) and 
Assessment report  
EMA/596651/2013  
Page 54/74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
completely disappeared under combination therapy with cholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid. In 
patients 14 (J)/15 (J), total serum bile acid concentrations remained normal (< 10 µmol/L) under 
cholic acid and were essentially made of cholic acid (40%) and its metabolite deoxycholic acid (35%) 
and of ursodeoxycholic acid in patient 14 (J).  
Vitamin Malabsorption 
Deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins, whether biochemically or manifesting as coagulatopathy (Vitamin 
K), lack of deep tendon reflexes (vitamin E) and rickets (vitamin D) have been reported at baseline in 
patients 14 (J), 15 (J), 2a, 2b, MS, BH and RM in various combinations. These deficiencies have been 
treated by parenteral administration or oral supplementation of the vitamins. Patients 14 (J) and 15 (J) 
are reported to no longer require vitamin E supplementation on cholic acid therapy, with and without 
additional ursodeoxycholic acid, respectively. 
Persistence of Efficacy and/or Tolerance Effects 
Long-term efficacy data for 6 patients with ∆4-3-oxoR deficiency are available. Treatment has been 
closely documented for more than 15 months in patients 2a, 2b and 3, for 9-10 years in patient MS 
and for 10.7 years for patients 14 (J) and 15 (J). There is no report in the literature on a loss of 
efficacy. Further, the literature does not report an increase of the required dose over time; rather, 
there is evidence that the doses necessary for metabolic control decrease over time, although this may 
be related to the age of the patient. The patients, with the exception of patient MS, have not been 
reported to have ended cholic acid treatment, and there is confirmation available that patients 14 (J) 
and 15 (J) are on continued treatment. Patient MS’ decision to stop treatment appears unrelated to a 
loss of efficacy of treatment. 
Reports of Lack of Efficacy 
Gonzales et al. 2009 report that in one patient with ∆4-3-oxoR deficiency, monotherapy with cholic 
acid was insufficient to return serum liver function tests close to the normal range. Additional 
ursodeoxycholic acid normalized liver enzyme levels. 
Clayton et al. 1996 report that ursodeoxycholic acid lacked efficacy in one patient (MS), while 
treatment with a combination of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid showed efficacy.  
Lemonde et al. 2003 report that a combination of cholic acid (8 mg/kg per day) and chenodeoxycholic 
acid (8 mg/kg per day) lacked in efficacy in an infant patient (BH). After six weeks of treatment, some 
liver function tests (bilirubin, ALT, prothrombin time) improved and others (albumin, GGT) deteriorated. 
The patient developed pruritus and had high plasma chenodeoxycholic acid levels. Chenodeoxycholic 
acid was stopped, while cholic acid presumably was continued. The authors do not report any attempts 
to optimise the cholic acid dose. Subsequently, liver function tests deteriorated, even after 
reintroduction of chenodeoxycholic acid, and the patient eventually underwent a liver transplant.  
In the same paper, (Lemonde et al. 2003) report that ursodeoxycholic acid (60 mg per day) and 
chenodeoxycholic acid (30 mg/day) lacked in efficacy in an infant patient (RM). Liver function tests 
continued to deteriorate during treatment, and the patient underwent an unsuccessful liver transplant. 
3.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Clinical efficacy in 3β-HSD deficiency 
The literature provides consensus that cholic acid is the treatment of choice for 3β-HSD deficiency. 
Where available to investigators, its clinical use has been documented since at least the mid-1990s and 
its use can therefore be considered as well-established.  
Assessment report  
EMA/596651/2013  
Page 55/74 
 
 
 
 
The treatment of 21 identifiable 3β-HSD deficiency patients with cholic acid has been documented in 
the literature. Detailed long-term data are available for 14 of them. Out of the total of 21 treated 
patients, a single patient with significant pre-existing liver damage needed a liver transplant. A 
generally favourable outcome is reported for 7 patients and long-term survival for 5 to more than 12 
years without complications or need for additional care is reported for the remaining patients. This is in 
contrast to the reports of 10 older, untreated siblings of these patients, each of whom died as children 
before either a definite diagnosis of the disease or a treatment could be established. One patient 
survived without treatment to the age of 26 years, at which time he needed treatment. These survival 
data are supported by biochemical and histological data. 
Treatment with cholic acid represses the biosynthesis of cholestatic and hepatotoxic bile acid 
metabolites via repression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase. Metabolites are cleared due to the choleretic 
effect of cholic acid and rapidly disappear from the patients’ urine (Table 9). As a result, biochemical 
liver parameters such as transaminases (Table 7) and bilirubin (Table 8) slowly normalise and 
histological liver damage is stopped or even improves. Finally, the administered cholic acid restores a 
normal enterohepatic circulation and absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins occurs at a normal 
level, resolving growth deficits or outright rickets. This pattern is consistently seen in all patients where 
detailed or partial data are available. 
Reporting and publication bias are potential concerns given the small number of cases reported in the 
literature as well as their geographic concentrations. However, given the documented survival benefit 
of treatment with cholic acid and bile acid therapy overall, complete treatment failures appear unlikely 
except for patients with advanced liver disease. Mixed treatment results may not have been considered 
for publication by investigators or scientific journals. Complete treatment failures of patients without 
advanced hepatic damage would also be of high scientific interest, as they would indicate a new 
disease mechanism or a gap in the understanding of primary bile acid metabolism. 
Chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid each have been used in combination with cholic acid 
or alone. Ursodeoxycholic acid therapy (alone or in combination with cholic acid or chenodeoxycholic 
acid) is usually effective to reduce strongly elevated urine bile acids and liver function tests, but is 
unable to normalise them fully. Unlike primary bile acids, ursodeoxycholic acid does not repress the 
synthesis of bile acid metabolites via repression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase. The authors of a study 
where patients were treated with a combination of chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid 
point out that despite achieving good control of 3β-HSD deficiency the optimum treatment was likely 
cholic acid or chenodeoxycholic acid monotherapy but had no access to suitable dosage forms for this 
treatment (Riello et al. 2010). 
Clinical efficacy in Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency 
All but one of the reported successful treatment regimes for patients with ∆4-3-oxoR deficiency 
included cholic acid. One patient was treated with cholic acid monotherapy, while all other patients 
were treated with a 1:1 (w/w) combination with another bile acid, usually ursodeoxycholic acid. On 
therapy containing cholic acid, 6 out of the 7 patients reported in the literature have survived long-
term without additional interventions; the 7th patient was reported surviving after a liver transplant. 
Liver function tests returned to normal within about 12 months. Liver histology improved over 12-15 
months, with mild to septal fibrosis remaining as a result of the hepatic injury. Vitamin malabsorption 
was completely corrected in at least 2 of the 7 patients. Δ4-3-oxo bile acid metabolites in urine and 
serum were strongly reduced under bile acid therapy, providing the metabolic basis for the observed 
pathologic improvements. Apart from their congenital defect, these patients are reported to be well 
and thriving.

EMA/596651/2013  
Page 56/74 
 
 
 
 
The therapeutic dose of cholic acid for each patient needs to be established empirically based on the 
metabolic response in terms of liver function tests and urinary bile acids. Daily doses are reported as 
5-8.3 mg/kg, with younger patients requiring higher doses than older patients. The association of 
cholic acid with ursodeoxycholic acid at the same dose is described as the appropriate therapy for 
∆4-3-oxoR deficiency in a number of reviews (Balistreri 1999; Bove et al. 2004) with the aim of 
facilitating the excretion of the cholestatic 3-oxo-Δ4 metabolites by ursodeoxycholic acid. On the other 
hand, cholic acid monotherapy has been successful for one patient (Potin et al. 2001; Gonzales et al. 
2004; Gonzales et al. 2009); there is no evidence in the literature that it has been tried in all patients. 
The combination of chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid has led to equivocal results: while one 
patient has survived long-term, another has responded poorly and progressed to a liver transplant. 
Until data on a larger group of patients are available, the appropriate treatment modality needs to be 
determined empirically for each patient. 
Two patients have been treated with treatment regimens not containing cholic acid (Ueki et al. 2008), 
providing additional comparative efficacy data. One patient stopped treatment with ursodeoxycholic 
acid after an 8-month treatment course resolved the disease symptoms, while the other was referred 
for a liver transplant after chenodeoxycholic acid treatment failed to permanently restore normal liver 
function. Both of these patients were heterozygous for mutant alleles of SRD5B1, and no data on 
comparative expression levels of ∆4-3-oxoR protein are available. In addition to this limitation, data on 
the treatment in the publication are sparse. 
3.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Clinical experience has been reported in the literature from small cohorts of patients and single case 
reports; absolute patient numbers are small due to the rarity of the conditions. This rarity also made 
the conduct of controlled clinical studies impossible. Overall, cholic acid treatment results for 38 
patients with 3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency are reported in the literature. 
Detailed long-term data on treatment with cholic acid monotherapy are available for 14 patients 
observed for up to 12.9 years. Cholic acid treatment results for seven patients with 
Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency for up to 14 years are reported in the literature. Detailed 
medium- to long-term data are available for 5 of these patients, of whom 1 has been treated with 
cholic acid monotherapy. Oral cholic acid therapy has been shown to: postpone or obviate the need for 
liver transplantation; restore normal laboratory parameters; improve histological lesions of the liver, 
and significantly improve all of the patient’s symptoms. Mass spectrometry analysis of urine during 
cholic acid therapy shows the presence of cholic acid and a marked reduction and in some cases, 
complete elimination of the toxic bile acid metabolites. This may reflect the restoration of an effective 
feedback mechanism of bile acid synthesis.  
3.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety analysis of cholic acid is based on published literature data including data gathered in 
subjects without inborn errors.  
Patient exposure 
Data on the cholic acid treatment and outcome of 34 patients with 3β-HSD deficiency or Δ4-3-oxoR 
deficiency are available in the literature. Additionally, literature data was also reported on the short- or 
medium-term treatment with cholic acid of 253 subjects who were either healthy volunteers or 
affected by hepatic or biliary disorders other than inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis 
(Table 16).

a As of latest reported observation (long term treatment), b Duration of treatment and safety data documented in the literature, if no 
data available set to ≤12 m, except for 6 patients with 3β-HSD deficiency reported to have been treated for a median of 3.5 years 
(range 1-17 years)  (Subramaniam et al. 2010), these  patients  were classified as  > 12 months;  N:  number of patients/volunteers, 
CA: cholic acid, m: month, y: year 
The populations studied differ clearly between the healthy volunteers with a normal primary bile acid 
metabolism and subjects with inborn errors in primary bile acid metabolism. The latter are 
characterised by an onset in early infancy or childhood in the majority of cases and the patient 
population is largely paediatric. Treatment of these patients has continued into adolescence and 
adulthood, consequently there is also a substantial adult patient set in this population. The healthy 
volunteer population is composed almost exclusively of adult and elderly patients. 
Distribution of sex was balanced between the patient populations. The male population was slightly 
larger than the female due to a larger number of male healthy volunteers.  Distribution of race was a 
reflection of the patient population. Race was usually not reported in the studies of healthy volunteers; 
these studies were however all conducted in Western Europe or the United States of America.  
Patients were treated with cholic doses between less than 5 and more than 20 mg/kg per day. All 
healthy volunteers in pharmacokinetic studies were treated with fewer than 5 single doses under 
5 mg/kg. Subjects in pharmacodynamic studies were treated with doses between 4.7 and 15 mg/kg 
per day for between 1 to 6 months. 
All reported adverse events in the publications have been included in the evaluation. Additionally, the 
publications have been critically reviewed for additional information that may indicate adverse events. 
Adverse events  
Very few adverse events to cholic acid are reported in the literature. No clear quantification of the 
frequency of a given adverse reaction is possible, as either no adverse reactions occurred, or the 
period of observation was undefined. 
In patients with 3β-HSD deficiency (13 patients) and ∆4-3-oxoR deficiency (2 patients), (Gonzales et al. 
2009) observed no serious adverse events in a cumulative duration of treatment of more than 180 
patient-years. Signs of acute and chronic cholic acid overdose were observed, however, in 4 children 
with 3β-HSD deficiency. Chronic overdose, presumably due to prescription of an excessive dose, was 
shown to be related to transient increases in serum bile acids, GGT and transaminase activities.  
While not noted as an adverse event, 1 patient with 3β-HSD deficiency in this population was described 
to have developed gallstones requiring cholecystectomy during cholic acid treatment for more than five 
years. Within this patient population (10 patients with 3β-HSD deficiency, 2 patients with ∆4-3-oxoR 
deficiency), Potin et al. 2001 noted that cases of nausea and vomiting occurred, which were not 
considered related to cholic acid. 
Assessment report  
EMA/596651/2013  
Page 58/74 
 
 
 
 
 
Setchell 2004 reports that no adverse events have been associated with the use of cholic acid in any 
patient treated thus far. Setchell and Heubi 2006 report that no adverse events have been associated 
with the use of cholic acid in any patient treated for errors in primary bile acid synthesis, with 
treatment longer than 12 years in the longest treated patient. However, in both publications, the 
authors do not qualify their observation in relation to the number of patients nor the exact defect of 
primary bile acid synthesis treated, but it is clear that the observation includes patients with 3β-HSD 
deficiency and ∆4-3-oxoR deficiency.  
One publication (Setchell et al. 1991) reports of twins with ∆4-3-oxoR deficiency treated with bile acid 
preparation in which chenodeoxycholic acid was suspected to lead to debilitating diarrhoea. The 
patients were being treated with cholic acid (100 mg/day) and chenodeoxycholic acid (100 mg/day) 
when the diarrhoea occurred. Diarrhoea resolved when chenodeoxycholic acid was replaced by 
ursodeoxycholic acid, indicating that the adverse event was due to either chenodeoxycholic acid or to 
its association with cholic acid. 
In the 5 studies with 48 subjects with a normal primary bile acid metabolism treated with oral cholic 
acid for 1 to 6 months, no subject developed an adverse event. However in 1 study with 6 patients 
with primary biliary cirrhosis all patients initially had elevated liver function tests (AST, ALT, GGT, AP, 
GLDH) as part of the condition. After initial improvement, the results of liver function tests deteriorated 
after 6 to 8 weeks of cholic acid therapy and the changes were correlated (r = 0.92) with an increase 
in α-dihydroxy-bile acids (chenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid) in the serum.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths or serious adverse events under cholic acid therapy of 3β-HSD deficiency or Δ4-3-OxoR 
deficiency have been reported in the literature.  
Laboratory findings 
Transient increases in AST and ALT have been observed at the initiation of the treatment with cholic 
acid or other bile acids, starting from elevated levels. The transaminases values subsequently 
normalise over the course of a few months. 
Gonzales et al. 2009 reported episodes of overdose in 4 patients having 3β-HSD deficiency or 
Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency. In one patient with 3β-HSD deficiency, accidental intake of a high cholic acid 
dose (53 mg/kg in one dose) was followed by the transient appearance of pruritus and diarrhoea, as 
well as an increase in transaminases, GGT and total serum bile acids (50 μmol/L, normal range: 
<10 mol/L). In the other four cases of overdose (one in the above mentioned patient), increased 
serum transaminase and GGT activities, as well as abnormal serum bile acid levels have been 
observed, which resolved after reducing the daily dose.  
In the case of an overdose, treatment should be continued at the recommended dosage after 
normalisation of clinical signs and/or biological abnormalities. 
Safety in special population 
Pregnancy 
Four pregnancies in two women treated with cholic acid for 3β-HSD have been reported (Gonzales et 
al. 2009). No adverse effect of cholic acid therapy on these four pregnancies was observed and they 
resulted in normal babies. Bile acid profiles as monitored by GC-MS were persistently good throughout 
pregnancy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/596651/2013  
Page 59/74 
 
 
 
 
Lactation 
Orphacol provides physiological levels of cholic acid to patients who are otherwise unable to produce it. 
Bile salts, including cholate, are a normal component of human breast milk (Forsyth et al. 1983). Due 
to the low concentration of cholic acid (<1 μmol/L) in milk, the amount ingested by the child is unlikely 
to make a significant contribution to the concentration of cholic acid in its duodenum. At these 
physiological levels cholic acid is almost certainly innocuous. Therefore, Orphacol can be used during 
lactation. 
Elderly 
There are no reports on the use of cholic acid for the therapy of 3β-HSD deficiency or a Δ4-3-oxoR 
deficiency in elderly patients in the literature. All currently reported patients are less than 30 years old, 
the majority less than 20. There is therefore currently no experience on the safety of cholic acid in this 
population. 
Infants and Children 
Cholic acid therapy has been used for infants from one month of age, and for children and adolescents. 
The evalu 
Hepatic impairment 
The majority of patients treated with cholic acid presented with some degree of hepatic impairment at 
the time of diagnosis, which resolved under therapy. The evaluation of the safety of cholic acid 
includes patients with this metabolic impairment. In the absence of clinical experience in patients with 
hepatic impairment from causes other than 3β-HSD or Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency, no recommendations on 
dosage adjustment can be made. Patients with hepatic impairment should be monitored closely. 
Renal impairment 
There are no reports on the use of cholic acid for the therapy of 3β-HSD deficiency or a Δ4-3-oxoR 
deficiency in patients with renal impairment in the literature. The dose of cholic acid should be 
adjusted individually. Bile acid metabolites are excreted only under conditions of cholestasis, which is 
resolved by cholic acid treatment.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No safety issues related to drug-drug interactions or other interactions have been presented by the 
Applicant. Due to the limited number of data and the lack of systematic controlled studies no 
conclusions can be drawn on the lack of reports regarding the safety aspects of drug-drug or other 
interaction. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the literature reported no patient interrupted or stopped treatment due to adverse events.  
3.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Data on the treatment and outcome of 28 patients with 3β-HSD deficiency or Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency are 
available in the literature. Additionally, literature data on the short- or medium-term treatment with 
cholic acid of 141 subjects who were either healthy volunteers or affected by hepatic or biliary 
disorders other than inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis are reported. While some of the 
patients described in the submitted case reports have been under medical supervision, they have not

been evaluated in a systematic manner, and the reporting of adverse events is comparable to 
spontaneous reporting. No clear, pre-defined observation period on which an incidence calculation may 
be based is available. In some cases, information on the number of patients and the total time of 
observation is not available. 
Very few adverse events under cholic acid treatment are reported in the literature. The only 
documented adverse reactions to cholic acid are pruritus and diarrhoea, which may be indicative of an 
overdose. No clear quantification of the frequency of a given adverse reaction is possible, as either no 
adverse reactions occurred, or the period of observation was undefined. 
No serious adverse events have been reported. All other adverse events that have been reported 
appear linked to an overdosage of cholic acid, were not serious, reversible and did not interfere with 
therapy. No patient interrupted or stopped treatment due to adverse events.  
The development of gallstones requiring cholecystectomy has been observed in a single patient with 
3β-HSD deficiency. Development of gallstones has also been observed in cholic-acid-fed rodents on a 
high-cholesterol diet. An enrichment of bile with deoxycholic acid, as seen in patients under treatment 
with cholic acid, has been linked to biliary cholesterol super-saturation and may accelerate gallstone 
development (Thomas 2008). On the other hand, gallstones also occurred in two other 3β-HSD 
deficiency patients before any cholic acid treatment. The development of gallstones on cholic acid 
treatment is considered a potential risk that will be monitored as part of the Risk Management Plan. It 
is also reported as adverse reaction reported after long-term therapy in section 4.8 of the SmPC 
The adverse events observed after acute overdosage of cholic acid are in line with the safety 
observations from toxicology studies and with the class effects of bile acids. The principally observed 
adverse reaction in these cases is diarrhoea and gastrointestinal irritation. Chronic overdose, 
presumably due to prescription of an excessive dose, was shown to be related to transient increases in 
serum GGT and transaminase activities. Note that in untreated patients, GGT is low; therefore an 
increase of GGT is a marker of hepatic damage that allows distinction of a lack of efficacy from 
treatment-emergent adverse reactions. As all (paediatric) patients appear to require lower doses as 
they become older, they should be monitored regularly for appropriate metabolic response, and the 
dose adjusted as required. The SmPC contains a warning that patients should be intensively monitored 
for their biochemical response and liver functions tests during the initiation of therapy and at least 
annually thereafter, and that the dosage should be adjusted accordingly. The SmPC also reflects that 
more frequent investigations should be undertaken to monitor therapy during periods of fast growth. 
The potential risk of increased carcinogenicity associated with the long-term administration of cholic 
acid is largely outweighed by the increased life expectancy and the avoidance of liver disease. 
3.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The clinical safety of cholic acid in the treatment of 3β-HSD deficiency or Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency, given 
at appropriate doses appears satisfactory. No serious adverse events have been reported in the 
literature. No patient interrupted or stopped treatment due to adverse events. The adverse events that 
have been reported are linked to an overdosage of cholic acid i.e. pruritus and diarrhoea. These events 
were not serious, reversible and did not interfere with the therapy. Based on the available data no 
frequency can be calculated. Patients presenting with pruritus and/or persistent diarrhoea should be 
investigated for a potential overdose by a serum and/or urine bile acid assay. Chronic overdose was 
also associated with elevated serum GGT and transaminases.

The development of gallstones requiring cholecystectomy has been observed in a single patient with 
3β-HSD deficiency. The development of gallstones on cholic acid treatment is considered a potential 
risk that will be monitored as part of the Risk Management Plan.

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the Applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements and provides adequate evidence that the Applicant has the services of a 
qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the notification of 
any adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country.

risk minimisation activity is necessary for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product: the MAH, 
in agreement with the competent authorities in the Member States, shall implement, prior to the 
launch, an educational programme for physicians aiming to provide educational material on correct 
diagnosis and therapeutic managements of the treatment of inborn errors in primary bile acid

synthesis due to 3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency or Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-

physician educational programme should contain the following key elements: 
• 
Prescription of a supratherapeutic dose (MedDRA term: drug toxicity) 
•  Risk of gallstones 
User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
Applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.8.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
There is a consensus in the literature that cholic acid is the treatment of choice for 3β-HSD deficiency. 
Where available to investigators, its clinical use has been documented since at least the mid-1990s and 
its use can therefore be considered as well-established. Oral administration of cholic acid, the 
substance missing in patients with 3β-HSD and ∆4-3-oxoR deficiencies, inhibits the production of 
cholestatic and hepatotoxic bile acid metabolites by down-regulating cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the 
rate limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis (Setchell and O’Connell 2007). Metabolites are cleared due 
to the choleretic effect of cholic acid and rapidly disappear from the patients’ urine. As a result, 
biochemical liver parameters such as transaminases and bilirubin more slowly normalise and 
histological liver damage is stopped or even improves. Finally, the administered cholic acid restores a 
normal enterohepatic circulation and absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins occurs at a normal 
level, resolving growth deficits or outright rickets. This pattern is consistently seen in all patients where 
detailed or partial data are available. 
No medicinal product containing cholic acid as the sole active substance has a marketing authorisation 
in any European Union member state. Several products containing combinations of cholic acid with 
other active substances are marketed in a few EU countries. Due to the presence of other active 
substances or unsuitable strength they are not suitable for the treatment of inborn errors of primary 
bile acid synthesis due to 3β-HSD deficiency or Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Clinical experience has been reported in the literature from small cohorts of patients and single case 
reports; absolute patient numbers are small due to the rarity of the conditions. This rarity and ethical 
considerations also made the conduct of controlled clinical studies impossible. Cholic acid treatment 
results for approximately 60 patients with 3β-HSD deficiency reported in the literature. Detailed long-
term treatment data with cholic acid monotherapy are available for 14 patients observed for up to 12.9 
years. Cholic acid treatment results for seven patients with Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency for up to 14 years are 
reported in the literature. Detailed medium- to long-term data are available for 5 of these patients, of 
whom 1 has been treated with cholic acid monotherapy. The scarcity of these uncontrolled data makes 
difficult to ascertain the the beneficial effects of cholic acid. However, the CHMP also recognising the 
limitations to conduct “standard” controlled clinical studies in a rare condition with an ethically 
acceptable comparator - concludes that the available clinical data presented in this application are 
Assessment report  
EMA/596651/2013  
Page 63/74 
 
 
 
 
sufficient to support demonstration of efficacy of cholic acid in the two claimed indications, as 
measured by objective improvement in metabolic and pathologic parameters in patients studied.  
As the majority of the case reports come from France (for 3β-HSD Deficiency) and France the UK (for 
Δ4-3-oxoR Deficiency) the representativeness of the results was discussed. Within the limitations of the 
small sample size, the diversity of the population described combined with the spectrum of disease 
severity (showed by the range of dose used) was considered to be sufficiently representative of the EU 
patient population. 
The choice of cholic acid dosage is empirically derived for all patients based on the normalisation of 
urine and serum bile acids. No dose response study has been conducted. Hence it is not possible to 
ascertain whether the proposed dosing regimen is optimal in the patient population. Cases of 
overdosage suggest that the doses, at least initially, were excessive. Nevertheless, it is consistently 
documented that this therapeutic approach based on the effect of treatment following the use of 
various dosing regimen showed that patients are controlled satisfactorily over several years. Therefore, 
it is concluded that the proposed dosing regimen is adequate and in line with the established 
systematic use of the compound in this rare condition. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In general, adverse effects seen with cholic acid therapy appear to be not serious, reversible and are 
mainly related to elevated hepatic enzymes and appear to be dose-related. Cases of diarrhoea and 
pruritus have also been reported. The development of gallstones requiring cholecystectomy has been 
observed in a single patient with 3β-HSD deficiency.  
The CHMP took due account of the fact that cholic acid is an endogenous molecule present in normal 
human bile, blood and other biological fluids. Once administered cholic acid will behave like an 
endogenous molecule in all respects. At physiological concentrations, cholic acid is non-toxic, thereby 
providing a safe dose range for use in human. Substantial knowledge of human cholic acid physiology 
in healthy subjects as well as patients with chronic liver diseases exists.  It should be also noted that 
cholic acid is used in foods as a food additive (E 1000) and that historically medicinal products 
containing cholic acid have been used for other indications, such as laxatives and choleretics since at 
least the early part of the 20th century.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In the absence of controlled trial data, it is difficult to comprehensively ascertain causality regarding 
unfavourable effects. This is a methodologically driven outcome of a trial design which has no 
comparator arm hence impacting on the possibility to assess whether an adverse event is related to 
the investigational drug. However, this absence of the formal establishment of the causality does not 
prevent that the clinical data reported to support this application demonstrate that the clinical safety of 
cholic acid in the treatment of 3β-HSD deficiency or Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency, is satisfactory in view of the 
established safety profile of this endogenous molecule.  
It is also recognised that only a few patients described in the submitted case reports had been under 
medical supervision. These patients appear not to have been evaluated in a systematic manner, and 
the reporting of adverse events is comparable to spontaneous reporting rather than in a clinical study. 
No clear pre-defined observation period on which an incidence calculation may be based is available. 
The CHMP duly considered the known safety profile of cholic acid.  The adverse events reported (i.e. 
pruritus and diarrhoea) were reversible and did not lead to the interruption of the treatment as 
reported consistently in the literature.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
In spite of the empirical use of bile acids including cholic acid, in 3β-HSD and ∆4-3-oxoR deficiencies, 
no suitable medicinal product is currently available for the affected patients. Oral cholic acid therapy 
has been shown to postpone or obviate the need for liver transplantation; restore normal laboratory 
parameters; improve histological lesions of the liver, and significantly improve all of the patient’s 
symptoms. Mass spectrometry analysis of urine during cholic acid therapy shows the presence of cholic 
acid and a marked reduction, or even complete elimination of the toxic bile acid metabolites. This 
reflects restoration of an effective feedback control of bile acid synthesis and a metabolic equilibrium. 
In addition, blood cholic acid concentration was normal and fat-soluble vitamins were restored to their 
normal range.  
The adverse events reported i.e. pruritus and diarrhoea are linked to an overdosage and reversible. 
Transient increases transaminase activities have been also observed in chronic overdosage. The 
development of gallstones requiring cholecystectomy has been observed in a single patient with 
3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency. Overall the safety profile of cholic acid is 
acceptable. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Oral cholic acid appears an effective and rather well tolerated long-term treatment for inborn errors of 
bile acid synthesis due to 3β-HSD deficiency or ∆4-3-oxoR deficiency, allowing patients to lead a 
normal life. The use of cholic acid to treat these conditions has been well established and documented 
in the literature over a period of almost 20 years through the work primarily conducted by the 
Jacquemin, Clayton and Setchell groups. Due to the extreme rarity of the diseases as well as the 
specialised knowledge and the sophisticated tools needed for their diagnosis, the number of cases 
reported in the literature remains very limited. However, observations demonstrate objectively 
measurable significant improvements in metabolic and pathologic parameters. While all children 
diagnosed with 3β-HSD deficiency or ∆4-3-oxoR deficiency have died due to liver failure before the 
introduction of bile acid therapy, all children that have been treated with cholic acid to date are alive, 
have not needed a liver transplantation (with exceptions of one child each with 3β-HSD deficiency and 
∆4-3-oxoR deficiency) and are in general good health, leading normal lives. With a single exception, all 
successful long-term treatment regimes for both disorders have included cholic acid. 
While ursodeoxycholic acid and/or chenodeoxycholic acid have been used initially instead of or in 
combination with cholic acid, there is now a consensus in the literature that cholic acid monotherapy is 
the most efficacious therapy in 3β-HSD deficiency. In patients with ∆4-3-oxoR deficiency combination 
treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid may be necessary in some patients with to maintain serum liver 
tests within the normal range and ensure a good histological outcome. It may confer additional benefit 
in some cases of sub-optimal therapeutic response with cholic acid alone. 
The only documented adverse reactions to cholic acid are pruritus and diarrhoea. They may be 
indicative of an overdose. Nevertheless these events were not serious, reversible and no patient 
interrupted or stopped treatment due to these events. Treatment with cholic acid at appropriate doses 
produced no adverse events, as reported consistently in the literature.  
Overall, the data provided allows the CHMP to conclude on an acceptable level of safety of cholic acid 
when used with the recommended dosing regimen and are up to the required standard. It should be 
noted that in conjunction with the recommendation for a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances, the specific obligation relates to the generation of follow-up safety data in a patient

surveillance database; these data will be reviewed annually pursuant to article 14(8) of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004. 
Overall based on the data presented the benefit-risk of Orphacol is considered positive. The CHMP 
evaluated the risks due to uncertainties and considers that these risks are not substantial in the light of 
the demonstrated benefits.  
Overall based on the data presented the benefit-risk of Orphacol is considered positive.  
3.8.1.  Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The liver disease associated with 3β-HSD and ∆4-3-oxoR deficiencies due to the production of 
hepatotoxic bile acid precursors is progressive and, if untreated, leads to death due to cirrhosis and 
liver failure. The only therapeutic option in severely affected cases is liver transplant. Currently there is 
no causal treatment. Treatment is limited to correcting the biochemical abnormalities, including the 
administration of bile acids and vitamin preparations. No medicinal product containing cholic acid as 
sole active substance has a marketing authorisation in the EU. 
All children that have been treated with cholic acid to date are alive, have not needed a liver 
transplantation (with exceptions of one child each with 3β-HSD deficiency and ∆4-3-oxoR deficiency) 
and are in general good health, leading normal lives. With a single exception, all successful long-term 
treatment regimes in the literature for both disorders have included cholic acid. 
In accordance with Article 22 of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 and Annex I, part II of Directive 2001/83/EC the Applicant applied for a marketing 
authorisation under exceptional circumstances. The Applicant justified that he was unable to provide 
comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal condition of use because the indications 
for which Orphacol are intended are encountered so rarely that he cannot reasonably be expected to 
provide comprehensive evidence. It would also be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical 
ethics to collect such information. The CHMP agrees on these justifications and considers that the 
criteria defined in the above-mentioned provisions are met: 
Inability to provide comprehensive efficacy and safety data due to rarity of the indication 
The indications for which Orphacol is intended, treatment of inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis 
due to 3β-HSD deficiency or Δ4-3-OxoR deficiency, are rarely encountered. Indeed, cholic acid has 
been designated as Orphan Medicinal Product (EU/3/02/127) by the European Commission for the 
treatment of inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis on 18 December 2002. A total maximum of 
about 90 patients – about 75 patients with 3β-HSD deficiency and approximately 15 patients with Δ4-
3-OxoR deficiency – are estimated to live in the European Union, based on the observed incidence over 
the last 15 years. Given the rarity of the diseases, the CHMP considers that the Applicant cannot be 
reasonably expected to provide comprehensive nonclinical and clinical evidence. Patients are so rarely 
identified (e.g. approximately 1 patient/year in France for both indications combined) that conduct of a 
controlled clinical trial would be unachievable. 
Inability to collect comprehensive information because it would be contrary to medical ethics 
Acquisition of complete pharmacokinetic information is considered not possible in regards to medical 
ethics consideration. As a bile acid, cholic acid is subject to highly efficient first-pass hepatic extraction 
and enterohepatic recirculation. An accurate determination of the absorption kinetics would thus 
require blood sampling from the portal vein, which is only ethically possible in the context of a surgical

intervention (Angelin et al. 1982). Sampling of peripheral plasma is a suitable method only for relative 
bioavailability and bioequivalence studies (Setchell et al. 2005), which are not of relevance to this 
application. A secondary measure is enrichment of the applied bile acid in the duodenal bile, which 
requires duodenal intubation or the less invasive, but also less reliable, use of the Enterotest string 
sampling method. Therefore, a pharmacokinetic study in adult healthy volunteers would in principle be 
possible, but would either be highly invasive, or be fraught with substantial imprecision of the data. 
It would be contrary to medical ethics principles to collect evidence of clinical efficacy of cholic acid in 
the intended indications in a controlled clinical study. A controlled study implies withholding the sole 
existing treatment, cholic acid, at least for a limited period of time. This would be the case in both 
parallel group and sequential (crossover) studies. A number of studies has shown that an interruption 
of bile acid treatment of patients may lead to a rapid deterioration of liver function tests and increases 
in the production of hepatotoxic and cholestatic bile acids (Vanderpas et al. 1987; Koopman et al. 
1988; Kobayashi et al. 2000; Yamato et al. 2001) Therefore, participation in a controlled clinical trial 
would expose patients to a risk of severe hepatic damage, or even death. The data on the efficacy and 
safety of cholic acid for the treatment of inborn errors in bile acid synthesis due to 3β-HSD deficiency 
or Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency reported in the literature is compelling, but was in no case generated in the 
context of a formal clinical study. However, the data contain many elements that would be utilised in a 
formal clinical study in these very rare disorders, such as those discussed in the CHMP “Guideline on 
Clinical Trials in Small Populations” (CHMP/EWP/83561/2005). Taken together, the combined 
evaluation of the single case studies provides significant evidence to support the efficacy and safety of 
cholic acid. 
The Applicant demonstrated that he was unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and 
safety under normal conditions of use. This is largely because the indications for which Orphacol is 
intended are encountered so rarely that the Applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide 
comprehensive evidence and it would be contrary to medical ethics principles to collect such 
information. The CHMP endorses that due to the rarity of 3β-HSD deficiency and particularly Δ4-3-oxoR 
deficiency, the provision of comprehensive data, particularly randomised controlled clinical trials is not 
feasible. The CHMP also endorses the argumentation on inability to collect comprehensive information 
because it would be contrary to medical ethics principles. Data submitted is limited as expected in such 
rare condition it is nevertheless considered that the clinical data presented in this application are 
sufficiently comprehensive to support demonstration of efficacy and safety of cholic acid in the claimed 
indications. A marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances for Orphacol is acceptable in 
regards to the fulfilled criteria of rarity of the disease and medical ethics. 
As specific obligation the Applicant has committed to monitor the safety and efficacy in patients treated 
with Orphacol from a patient surveillance database for which the protocol has been endorsed by the 
CHMP and is documented in the RMP. The objectives of this surveillance programme is to monitor 
accumulating data on efficacy and safety in the treatment of inborn errors in primary bile acid 
synthesis due to 3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency or 
Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency with Orphacol in infants, children, adolescents and adults. 
Reports on recruitment progress of the patient surveillance database will be analysed and reported to 
the CHMP at the time of PSURs (for safety) and of the Annual Re-assessments (for safety and 
efficacy). Progress and results from the database will form the basis of the annual reassessments of 
the benefit/risk profile of Orphacol. 
Overall, the safety and efficacy of the product was demonstrated based on the literature data 
presented and analysed. The Applicant demonstrated that the use of cholic acid for the treatment of 
3β-HSD and Δ4-3-oxoR deficiencies has been well-established within the Community for at least 10

years, with consistently recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. Due to the rarity of 
3β-HSD and Δ4-3-oxoR deficiencies, particular attention has been paid to missing information. 
Justifications have been provided by the applicant, which demonstrate that there is an acceptable level 
of safety and efficacy can be supported although some studies are lacking (Annex I, Part II, 1.c of 
Directive 2001/83/EC). These arguments have been agreed to by the CHMP.   
The applicant has provided enough evidence to support a positive benefit/risk balance for the medicinal 
product. Based on the rarity of the disease and ethical considerations, the CHMP concludes that the 
criteria for a Marketing Authorisation under exceptional circumstances are met (Annex I, Part II, 6. 
Directive 2001/83/EC).  
In conclusion, the CHMP considers that a Marketing Authorisation under exceptional circumstances can 
be granted subject to the setting of a specific obligation to monitor the safety of the medicinal product. 
3.9.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Orphacol was favourable in the treatment of inborn errors in primary 
bile acid synthesis due to 3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency or Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-
5β-reductase deficiency in infants, children and adolescents aged 1 month to 18 years and adults and 
therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances.

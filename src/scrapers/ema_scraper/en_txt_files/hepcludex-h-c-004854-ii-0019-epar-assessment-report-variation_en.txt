1. Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Gilead Sciences Ireland Unlimited 
Company submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 2 September 2022 an application for a 
variation. 
The following changes were proposed:

Annex II of the Product Information; this is a Multicenter, Open-label, Randomized Phase III Clinical 
Study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of Bulevirtide in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis Delta. Consequently, 
the MAH proposes a switch from conditional marketing authorisation to full marketing authorisation given 
the fulfilment of the SOB. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial changes in the SmPC. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet. 
2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Chronic  HDV  infection  with  active  hepatitis,  is  indicated  by  a  positive  HDV  RNA  and  ALT  elevation. 
Approximately 5% of individuals infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) are coinfected with hepatitis D virus 
(HDV).  Chronic  HBV/HDV  coinfection  is  associated  with  an  unfavourable  outcome,  with  many  patients 
developing liver cirrhosis, liver failure and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma within 5–10 years.  
Currently there is no therapy specific for HDV approved in the EU other than bulevertide (BLV). Hepcludex 
is indicated for “the treatment of chronic hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in plasma (or serum) HDV-
RNA positive adult patients with compensated liver disease.” 
The scope of this variation is the submission of interim results at 48 weeks from study MYR301, which was 
the key specific obligation for the CMA of BLV. This investigates the efficacy and safety of 2 or 10 mg BLV, 
compared  to  delayed  treatment  over  96  weeks.  MYR301  was  designed  as  a  multicenter,  parallel-group 
open-label, randomized phase III clinical trial. 150 participants received the drug with 50/49/51 patients 
in the arms delayed treatment/BLV 2 mg/ BLV 10 mg. 
In  MYR301,  the  primary  efficacy  end  point  (undetectable  HDV RNA  or  decrease  in  HDV RNA  by 
≥ 2 log10 IU/mL  from  baseline  and  ALT normalization  at  48  weeks)  was  achieved  in  42.9%  in  2  mg  BLV 
treatment group and in 48.0% in the 10 mg group. Results of treatment were significantly higher compared 
to the delayed treatment (2%).  
The key secondary endpoint “the proportion of participants with undetectable HDV RNA” were 12.2% and 
20.0 % in the 2 mg and 10 mg BLV treatment groups respectively, at 48 weeks. None of the patients in 
the delayed treatment group achieved the key secondary endpoint. Furthermore, considerably higher rates 
of ALT normalization were reached with 2mg (51.0%) and 10 mg (56.0%) compared to delayed treatment 
(11.8%) with only numerical differences seen between 2mg and 10mg BLV treatment.  
Overall, BLV is well tolerated, with asymptomatic bile acid increases (18.8% and 27.7% with 2 and 10 mg, 
EMA/CHMP/763187/2022 
Page 4/43 
 
 
 
 
  
 
respectively, pooled safety data set) and injection site reactions (16.3%; 2 mg BLV, 30.0%; 10 mg BLV) 
being the most common events. SAEs frequencies were low (2-4%) in treatment and delayed treatment 
arms. No deaths occurred. Frequently occurring AEs include eosinophilia, fatigue, injection site reactions, 
headache  and  arthralgia  at  48  weeks.  The  safety  database  is  overall  considered  small,  which  precludes 
certain conclusions regarding rare AEs. No safety concerns were identified. 
The presented data confirmed the benefits assumed at the time of the Conditional Marketing Authorisation. 
Moreover, no clinically relevant differences were seen between 2mg and 10mg, supporting the initial dose 
selection of 2 mg. 
No new safety concerns were definitely identified, and it is not expected that the remaining outstanding 
data in MYR301 will alter the benefit risk profile of Hepcludex. The SOB has been reclassified as a Category 
3 study in the RMP and removed from Annex II. The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) has updated 
the SmPC 5.1 adding primary endpoints results from week 48. Moreover, it has shortened the previously 
accepted presentation of data from the phase II programme, as requested.  
The MAH has updated the frequencies of pruritus and injection site reactions from common to very common, 
which is endorsed based on the presented data.  
Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the review of all available data, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance of Hepcludex 
outweigh remains positive. 
Scientific grounds for recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation not subject to 
specific obligations 
The MAH provided within this variation their position that comprehensive data are available about the safety 
and efficacy of Hepcludex and supporting the favourable benefit/risk profile of in all approved populations, 
as the submission of this variation application contains the data outstanding from the last remaining specific 
obligation (SOB) as follows:

Due date 
MYR 301 - A Multicentre, Open-label, Randomized Phase 3 Clinical Study to Assess

Efficacy and Safety of Bulevirtide in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis Delta  
The MAH has therefore requested to take the opportunity of the present renewal of conditional marketing 
authorisation to remove the submission of the MYR 301 from the list of specific obligations and to adopt an 
opinion  recommending  the  granting  of  a  marketing  authorisation  in  accordance  with  Article  14(1)  of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 (‘marketing authorisation not subject to specific obligations’).  
During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data on the current SOB have been generated. The 
clinical safety profile, as well as the efficacy of this product is considered comprehensively characterised and 
supportive of a positive benefit-risk balance. The SOB (MYR 301) may therefore be reclassified as category 3 
studies in the RMP and deleted from Annex II.

this variation, the SmPC, Annex II and PL are also updated to reflect the completion of the specific 
obligation and the CHMP recommendation to grant a marketing authorisation no longer subject to specific 
obligations. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial changes in the SmPC. The Package 
Leaflet is updated accordingly. Version 4.0 of the RMP has also been approved (Study MYR301 was 
reclassified from a Category 2 to a Category 3 study). 
is recommended for approval. 
The CHMP, having considered the application as set out in the appended assessment report and having 
reviewed the data submitted by the marketing authorisation holder including the evidence concerning 
compliance with specific obligations, is of the opinion that the risk-benefit balance of the above 
mentioned medicinal product remains favourable, that all specific obligations laid down in Annex II have 
been fulfilled and that comprehensive data supports a favourable benefit-risk balance of the above 
mentioned medicinal product. Therefore, pursuant to Article 14-a(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the 
CHMP recommends by consensus the granting of a marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 
14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for Hepcludex (bulevirtide). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, II and IIIB are 
recommended. 
As a result of this variation, it is recommended that the following obligation is deleted from the Annex II

Introduction 
Bulevirtide (2 mg given subcutaneously once daily) is conditionally approved for the treatment of chronic 
hepatitis  delta  virus  (HDV)  infection  in  plasma  (or  serum)  HDV-RNA  positive  adult  patients  with 
compensated liver disease under the brand name Hepcludex in the European Union (EU) and other countries 
within  Europe  and  is  fully  approved  as  Myrcludex  B  for  the  treatment  of  CHD  in  adults  in  the  Russian 
Federation. 
HDV  is  a  satellite  virus  of  HBV  which  requires  the  presence  of  HBV  for  its  replication.  Chronic  HBV/HDV 
infection is associated with an increased risk of liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular 
carcinoma.  
On  31  July  2020,  the  European  Commission  granted  a  Conditional  Marketing  Authorization  (CMA)  for 
Hepcludex.  Upon  approval  of  the  Hepcludex  CMA,  there  was  1 Specific  Obligation  (SOB)  to  fulfill  (Study 
MYR301).  
Study MYR301 is the key confirmatory study for BLV. It is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter, 
parallel-group study that evaluates the efficacy and safety of BLV administered subcutaneously (SC) at a 
dose of 2 mg or 10 mg once daily for treatment of CHD in comparison with delayed treatment.  
Eligible participants received immediate treatment with BLV 2 mg/day or BLV 10 mg/day, each given for 
144 weeks, or delayed treatment with BLV 10 mg/day after an observational period of 48 weeks (delayed 
treatment), after which they were treated for 96 weeks. 
Included in this submission are updated clinical efficacy and safety data (Week 48) from the ongoing Study 
MYR301  (SOB)  that  support  the  use  of  BLV  for  the  treatment  of  CHD  in  adults  with  compensated  liver 
disease. Supportive pooled safety data analysis from Week 48 of the Phase 2 Study MYR203 and the Phase 
3  Study  MYR301  are  also  included,  where  appropriate,  to  support  the  proposed  presentation  of  adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs) and their frequencies in the EU summary of product characteristics (SmPC) updates. 
This m2.5 addresses the benefit-risk assessment generated for the SOB and presents data up to Week 48 
from the ongoing Study MYR301. Included in this submission are the relevant clinical study reports (CSRs): 
• MYR301 Week 24 Interim CSR 
• MYR301 Week 48 Interim CSR (Revision) 
5.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
5.1  Pharmacokinetics 
Blood sampling was performed at the randomization/baseline visit (Visit 1) and at all treatment visits after 
the start of BLV therapy. Sampling was done 1 hour ± 15 minutes after BLV SC injection. During the first 
48 weeks, PK samples were collected only for the BLV 2 mg and BLV 10 mg groups. Frozen samples were 
sent to the central laboratory for analysis. 
At Day 1, measured 1 hour ± 15 min after SC injection of BLV, the geometric mean (%CV) concentrations 
of BLV were 16.2 μg/L (66.8%) in participants treated BLV 2 mg and 82.0 μg/L (98.9%) in participants 
treated with BLV 10 mg. In the BLV 2 mg group, similar plasma concentrations were observed from Week 
4 to Week 48, with geometric mean plasma concentrations of 20.8 μg/L and 22.2 μg/L at Week 4 and Week 
48, respectively. In the BLV 10 mg group, the geometric mean plasma concentrations were 158.2 μg/L and 
EMA/CHMP/763187/2022 
Page 8/43 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
126.1 μg/L at Week 4 and Week 48, respectively. Overall, this indicated that steady state is achieved by 
Week  4,  with  no  further  increase  in  plasma  concentrations  at  later  time  points.  High  variability  in  BLV 
plasma concentrations was observed in BLV dose groups (2 mg and 10 mg), with %CV ranging from 64% 
to 152% across time points.

weeks of treatment (safety analysis set). 
5.2  Assessor’s Discussion – pharmacokinetics 
The MAH has only collected sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) data within the present Phase III study MYR301. 
PK samples were taken at all treatment visits at a single time point of 1 hour ± 15 minutes after BLV sc 
injection. BLV concentrations measured in the present study MYR301, correspond approximately to its Cmax 
values. Plasma concentrations measured after 2 mg dose were lower than after 10 mg dose, as expected. 
Geometric mean concentrations measured at week 48 after the dose of 2 mg and 10 mg were 22.2 μg/L 
and  126.1  μg/L,  respectively.  Concentrations  measured  at  Week  4  were  generally  similar  to  Week  48 
concentrations (for both dose levels), thus implying a steady-state condition reached by Week 4. Overall, 
a relatively high variability in BLV plasma concentrations was observed at both dose levels. The MAH is not 
proposing  any  SmPC  updates  related  to  PK  as  a  part  of  the  current  Variation  II  procedure,  which  is 
considered acceptable.

7. Clinical Efficacy aspects 
7.1. Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study Participants and Treatments 
This ongoing Phase 3, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter study compares the efficacy 
and safety of BLV administered as delayed treatment (10 mg subcutaneous once daily after 48 weeks) 
versus  immediate  treatment  (2  mg  or  10  mg  subcutaneous  once  daily)  for  the  treatment  of  CHD  in 
participants with compensated cirrhosis or without cirrhosis. 
Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the following 3 treatment groups for a treatment 
period of 144 weeks: 
•  Treatment Group A: Delayed treatment with BLV 10 mg/day for 96 weeks after an observational 
period of 48 weeks with an additional follow-up period of 96 weeks 
•  Treatment Group B: Immediate treatment with BLV 2 mg/day for 144 weeks with a  further follow-
up period of 96 weeks 
•  Treatment Group C: Immediate treatment with BLV 10 mg/day for 144 weeks with  a further follow-
up period of 96 weeks 
Randomization was stratified for liver cirrhosis status (no/yes). 
Key inclusion criteria: Eligible participants were males or females aged 18 to 65 years with positive 
serum anti-HDV  antibody  results  or  PCR  results  for  serum/plasma  HDV  RNA  for  at  least  6  months 
before screening, positive PCR results for serum/plasma HDV RNA at screening, and ALT level > 1 × 
ULN, but less than 10 × ULN. Participants with controlled human immunodeficiency virus coinfection 
were allowed as well as participants with HCV antibodies, if screening HCV RNA test was negative.  
Key exclusion criteria: Child-Pugh hepatic insufficiency score over 7 points; participants with current 
or previous (within the past 2 years) decompensated liver  disease; one or more additional known 
primary or secondary causes of liver disease, other than hepatitis B; use of interferons (IFN) within 
6 months before screening. 
A  total  of  183  participants  were  screened.  Of  the  183  participants  screened,  150  were   randomized 
(delayed treatment group: 51 participants; BLV 2 mg treatment group: 49 participants; BLV 10 mg 
treatment group: 50 participants), and 99 participants received at least 1 dose of study drug (BLV 2 
mg treatment group: 49 participants; BLV 10 mg treatment group: 50 participants); 51 participants 
were randomized to the delayed   treatment group and as such did not receive study drug before their 
data cut-off date for the Week 48 primary end point analysis. 
Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
Participants who had ongoing treatment with nucleoside/nucleotide analogues for CHB were allowed to 
continue their treatment as prescribed on screening and during study participation. For participants with 
no ongoing treatment with nucleoside/nucleotide analogues for CHB, treatment was to be initiated at the 
baseline visit or later in the study if indicated in accordance with the current EASL/AASLD treatment 
guidelines (current as of November 2018). Anti-HBV treatment was to be started if one of following 
conditions was met:  
• 
• 
(HBV DNA > 2000 IU/mL and ALT > ULN) or (HBV DNA > 2000 IU/mL and at least moderate liver 
necroinflammation or fibrosis) or (HBV DNA > 2000 IU/mL and ALT > ULN and at least moderate 
liver necroinflammation or fibrosis)

Study MYR301 Key dates 
Endpoints 
The primary efficacy end point for Study MYR301  was the proportion of participants achieving combined 
response  at  Week 48.  Combined  response  was  defined  as  fulfilment  of  2 conditions  simultaneously: 
undetectable HDV RNA (HDV RNA < limit of detection [LOD]) or decrease in HDV RNA by ≥ 2 log10 IU/mL 
from baseline, and ALT normalization. 
The  key  secondary  efficacy  end  point  was  the  proportion  of  participants  receiving  BLV  treatment  with 
undetectable HDV RNA at Week 48. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints included the following: 
•  Proportion of participants with ALT normalization at Week 48 
•  Change from baseline at Week 48 in liver stiffness as measured by elastography 
•  The proportion of participants with HDV RNA decrease by ≥ 2 log10 IU/mL from baseline or undetectable 
HDV RNA (viral response) at Week 48.  
Exploratory efficacy end points included the following: 
•  Liver fibrosis and changes in histological activity at Week 48 (for participants who consented to 
undergo a liver biopsy at baseline and Week 48) 
•  Serological analyses at Week 48: 
o  HBsAg loss with or without seroconversion 
o  HBsAg response (defined as HBsAg decrease by > 1 log10 IU/mL) 
o  Change from baseline in HBsAg levels (log10 scale) 
o  HBeAg loss with or without seroconversion 
•  Change from baseline in HBV DNA levels (log10 scale) at Week 48 
• 
Incidence of liver-related events from baseline through Week 48 
•  Quality of life questionnaires (assessed at Week 48) 
Statistical analyses 
Full Analysis Set  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all participants either randomized to the delayed treatment group 
or  randomized  to  BLV  and  received  BLV  at  least  once  after  randomization.  Analysis  of  the  FAS  was 
based on the planned treatment (ie, participants were analyzed “as randomized”).  
EMA/CHMP/763187/2022 
Page 11/43 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Per Protocol Analysis Set 
The  Per  Protocol  (PP)  Analysis  Set  for  the  Week  48  primary  end  point  analysis  was  defined  as  all 
participants in the FAS for whom no PD judged as having an impact on the primary efficacy analysis 
was reported or identified. 
Safety Analysis Set  
The Safety Analysis Set included all participants randomized to the delayed treatment group or randomized 
to BLV and received BLV at least once after randomization. Analysis on the safety population was based on 
the actual treatment (ie, participants were analyzed “as treated”). 
Analyses  
An  interim  analysis  was  performed  on  the  primary  end  point  at  Week  24.  Therefore,  to  account  for  the 
repeated analysis and also maintain the nominal 2-sided significance level of 0.05, this level was to be split 
among  the  interim  (Week  24)  and  primary  end  point  analysis  (Week  48),  with  an  allocation  of  0.01  to 
interim and 0.04 to the main analysis.  
Multiple group comparisons for the primary end point and the inclusion of a main secondary end point were 
to be handled with a hierarchical testing procedure. All other analyses were to be considered exploratory 
and no adjustment for multiple testing was performed. This includes the liver stiffness parameter. 
The  expected  response  rates  at  Week  48  for  the  BLV  2  mg  and  10  mg  doses  were  at  least  45%.  The 
conservative  expectation  for  the  delayed  treatment  response  rates  was  8%  or  less.  These  assumptions 
were  based  on  results  from  the  preceding  Phase  2  study  (Study  MYR202).  With  a  sample  size  of  47 
participants  per  treatment  group,  a  Fisher’s  exact  test  with  a  0.04  2-sided  significance  level  had  97.8% 
power to detect this difference between the BLV 10 mg and the delayed treatment proportions and between 
the  BLV  2  mg  and  the  delayed  treatment  proportions.  The  power  to  reject  both  null  hypotheses 
simultaneously was 95.6%. This sample size was slightly increased to 50 participants per treatment group 
to account for a few potential early withdrawals before exposure. Hence, 150 participants were planned to 
be randomized. 
Resistance analysis 
Resistance analysis was performed on participants who experienced on-treatment virologic breakthrough 
or HDV RNA decline < 1 log10 IU/mL (non-responders) at Week 48. 
Study Conduct 
Following finalization of the original Week 48 CSR dated 18 January 2022, virologic sample switches were 
identified for some participants in the study, which impacted virology results for some participants. 
Subsequently, an assessment of the impact on the efficacy endpoints related to HDV RNA results was 
promptly conducted. Upon completion of the assessment, the MAH identified 14 affected HDV RNA 
samples from 10 participants. Protocol deviations relating to sample switches were only considered major 
if they impacted key time points (e.g., baseline or Week 48). The 5 major PDs identified from this 
assessment were categorized as “H – Laboratory Procedure.” 
The issue of sample switches was reflected in HDV RNA profiles over 48 weeks. Laboratory kits used for 
the collection and storage of HDV RNA samples also contained sample tubes that were used for additional 
analyses including: HBV and HDV virology (ie, plasma HBV DNA, HBsAg and anti-HBsAg antibody, HBeAg 
and antibody against hepatitis B e antigen, HBV and HDV genotype), immunogenicity (ie, ADA), sparse 
EMA/CHMP/763187/2022 
Page 12/43 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
PK samples, and samples for HBV and HDV sequencing and HDV phenotyping and for NTCP polymorphism 
sequencing (baseline only). 
The procedures for collection and processing of safety samples were separate from the collection and 
processing procedures for efficacy samples. ALT levels were determined in real time as a component of 
routine safety monitoring, and as such, these samples were processed differently than virologic (efficacy) 
samples.

A  total  of  150 participants  were  randomized  (delayed  treatment  group:  51 participants;  BLV  2 mg 
treatment  group:  49 participants;  BLV  10 mg  treatment  group:  50 participants),  and  99 participants 
received at least 1 dose of study drug (BLV 2 mg treatment group: 49 participants; BLV 10 mg treatment 
group: 50 participants); 51 participants were randomized to the delayed treatment group and as such did 
not receive study drug before their data cutoff date for the Week 48 primary end point analysis  
Of  the  99  participants  randomized  and  treated  with  BLV  at  16  sites  in  4  countries:  56  in  Russia,  20  in 
Germany, 17 in Italy, and 6 in Sweden, 4 participants discontinued the study prior to the Week 48 data 
cutoff date.

Disease characteristics at baseline 
Table 2 MYR301: Baseline Disease Characteristics (Full Analysis Set) 
At baseline, 47.3% of participants overall had cirrhosis, and all these participants were Child-Pugh Class A; 
the mean (SD) Child-Pugh score was 5.3 (0.4) and all had a Child-Pugh A score below 7. 
Concomitant Medications

The most common concomitant medications were in the following drug classes: 
•  Delayed treatment group: antivirals for systemic use (62.7%, 32 of 51 participants), vitamins and 
anesthetics (19.6%, 10 of 51 participants each), and analgesics (13.7%, 7 of 51 participants 
•  BLV  2  mg  treatment  group:  antivirals  for  systemic  use  (63.3%,  31  of  49  participants),  vitamins 
(24.5%, 12 of 49 participants), and analgesics and drugs for acid-related disorders (22.4%, 11 of 
49 participants) 
•  BLV 10 mg treatment group: antivirals for systemic use (54.0%, 27 of 50 participants), vitamins 
(18.0%, 9 of 50 participants), and anesthetics (16.0%, 8 of 50 participants) 
Antivirals for systemic use were the most common drug class.  
In the study, 30% (45 of 150) of participants had prior use of any anti-HBV medication while 60% (90 of 
150) of participants had concomitant use of any anti-HBV medication during the first 48 weeks of the study. 
The  most  common  anti-HBV  medications  used  during  the  study  were  tenofovir  (not  specified)  (delayed 
treatment group 27.5%, 14 participants; BLV 2 mg treatment group: 32.7%, 16 participants; BLV 10 mg 
treatment group: 24.0%, 12 participants), TDF (delayed treatment group 29.4%, 15 participants; BLV 2 
mg  Bulevirtide  treatment  group:  16.3%,  8  participants;  BLV  10  mg  treatment  group:  18.0%,  9 
participants), and entecavir (delayed treatment group 13.7%, 7 participants; BLV 2 mg treatment group: 
14.3%, 7 participants; BLV 10 mg treatment group: 10.0%, 5 participants).  
Primary Efficacy End Point 
The primary efficacy end point was the combined response at Week 48 of treatment, which was defined as 
fulfilment  of  2 conditions  simultaneously:  undetectable  HDV RNA  (HDV RNA  < LOD)  or  decrease  in 
HDV RNA by ≥ 2 log10 IU/mL from baseline, and ALT normalization. An interim analysis of the combined 
response was performed also at week 24. 
The proportion of participants achieving the combined response increased from Week 24 to Week 48 in the 
BLV treatment groups. The combined response rates (95% CI) at Week 48 were 44.9% (30.7% to 59.8%) 
and  48.0%  (33.7%  to  62.6%)  in  treatment groups  BLV 2 mg  and  BLV 10 mg,  versus  2.0% (0.0%  to 
10.4%) in the delayed treatment group (Table 3). 
The differences in proportions of responders at Week 48 for the combined response between each of the 
BLV treatment groups and the delayed treatment group were statistically significant (Table 3).

Interim result. 
There was a statistically significant difference at Week 24 if P < 0.01. 
There was a statistically significant difference at Week 48 if P < 0.04. 
The comparison of BLV 2 mg versus delayed treatment was considered significant only if the comparison of 10 mg 
versus delayed treatment was significant as well. 
Combined response was defined as (undetectable HDV RNA or decrease in HDV RNA by ≥ 2 log10 IU/mL from 
baseline) and alanine aminotransferase normalization. 
The CI was calculated using Clopper-Pearson (exact) for within-group proportions and exact unconditional for 
difference in proportions. 
A confidence level of 95% was used for within-group CIs. For difference in proportions, the confidence level used was 
99% for 24 weeks (Week 24 interim analysis) and 96% for Week 48 (Week 48 primary end point analysis). 
Fisher’s exact tests were used for each comparison of BLV 2 mg and 10 mg versus delayed treatment using a 
significance level of 0.01 at Week 24 and 0.04 at Week 48. 
Secondary Efficacy End Points 
Undetectable HDV RNA at Week 48 (Key Secondary End Point) 
The  proportion  of  responders  (95%  CI)  with  undetectable  HDV  RNA  was  12.2%  (4.6%  to  24.8%)  and 
20.0%  (10.0%  to  33.7%)  in  BLV  2 mg  and  BLV  10 mg  treatment  groups,  respectively  (Table 4).  The 
difference in proportions of responders (96% CI) at Week 48 with undetectable HDV RNA between the 2 mg 
and 10 mg BLV groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.4139).

Alanine Aminotransferase Normalization at Week 48 
At Week 48, 51.0% and 56.0%, respectively in the in the 2 mg and 10 mg BLV treatment arms achieved 
ALT normalisation. In the delayed treatment group, the proportion of participants with ALT normalization 
at Week 48 was 11.8%. These analyses were not type I error controlled.

Proportions of Participants for Each Treatment Group, Using Fisher`s Exact Test (Full Analysis Set) 
Change from Baseline in Liver Stiffness at Week 48 
In Study MYR301, liver stiffness was measured at baseline and at Week 48 by FibroScan. The mean (SD) 
liver stiffness at baseline was 13.99 (8.19) kPa in the BLV 2 mg treatment group, 14.81 (9.26) kPa in the 
BLV  10 mg  treatment  group,  and  15.26  (8.95)  kPa  in  the  delayed  treatment  group.  There  was  a  mean 
decrease in liver stiffness in both of the BLV treatment groups. 
At Week 48, the LS means (95% CI) for change from baseline in liver stiffness was−3.08 kPa for the BLV 
2 mg treatment group, −3.17 kPa for BLV 10 mg treatment group, and 0.88 kPa for the delayed treatment 
group. These analyses were not type I error controlled (Table 6).

Additional Efficacy End Point 
Viral  response  was  defined  as  HDV  RNA  decrease  by  ≥ 2 log10 IU/mL  from  baseline  or  undetectable 
HDV RNA  at  Week  48.  The  proportions  of  participants  who  achieved  a  viral  response  at  Week 48  were 
71.4% (95% CI: 56.7% to 83.4%) in the BLV 2 mg treatment group, 76.0% (95% CI: 61.8% to 85.9%) 
in the BLV 10 mg treatment group, and 3.9% (95% CI: 0.5% to 13.5%) in the delayed treatment group 
These analyses were not type I error controlled.  
Exploratory Efficacy End Points 
Fibrosis and Histological Activity 
Assessments of liver fibrosis and changes in histological activity were performed only for those participants 
who underwent liver biopsy at baseline and Week 48: 25 of 49 participants (51.0%) in the BLV 2 mg group, 
31 of 50 participants (62.0%) in the BLV 10 mg group, and 26 of 51 participants (51.0%) in the delayed 
treatment group. Table 5 presents the change from baseline in fibrosis at Week 48 in the full analysis set. 
Improvements  in  fibrosis  and  necroinflammation  (histological  activity  stage)  parameters  were  generally 
seen  in  the  BLV  treatment  groups  compared  with  the  delayed  treatment  group.  The  percentages  of 
participants who had an improvement (i.e., decrease of at least 1 point) in the fibrosis parameters (Ishak 
fibrosis  score,  Knodell  fibrosis  score,  and  Metavir  fibrosis  stage)  at  Week  48  were  numerically  higher  in 
each of the  BLV treatment groups than in the delayed treatment group,  particularly for the Metavir and 
Knodell  scoring  systems.  The  percentages  of  participants  who  had  an  improvement  in  the  fibrosis 
parameters were similar for the BLV 2 mg and BLV 10 mg treatment groups.

No  participant  across  the  treatment  groups  experienced  HBsAg loss  and  no  participant  across  treatment 
groups experienced HBsAg seroconversion by Week 48. 
HBsAg response at Week 48:  
HBsAg  response  was  defined  as  HBsAg  decrease  by  > 1 log10 IU/mL  at  postbaseline  assessment.  The 
difference  in  proportions  of  participants  at  Week 48  for  the  HBsAg response  between  each  of  the  BLV 
treatment groups and the delayed treatment group was not statistically significant.

7 participants  (14.0%)  in  the  BLV  10 mg  treatment  group,  there  were  no  participants  across  the  3 
treatment groups who experienced HBeAg loss by Week 48. 
HBV DNA levels 
A total of 45 participants (30%) had used nucleoside/nucleotide analogues prior to the start of the study, 
and during the first 48 weeks of treatment, 90 participants (60%) were treated with nucleoside/nucleotide 
analogues. All anti-HBV treatment was initiated prior to or at baseline (by Day 2), with similar proportions 
receiving anti-HBV across the 3 treatment groups. At baseline, mean HBV DNA levels were low (< 1.5 log10 
IU/mL) overall and comparable between treatment groups (Table 11). At Week 48, the LS means change 
in HBV DNA levels was small in all treatment groups.

Quality-of-Life-Questionnaires  
Quality of life assessments were conducted in Study MYR301. At Week 48, scores for the individual EuroQol 
(5 dimensions) domains, EuroQol visual analogue scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, and the Hepatitis Quality 
of Life Questionnaire (HQLQ) components were generally similar between each of the BLV treatment groups 
when compared with the delayed treatment group, with the exception of role physical of the HQLQ, in which 
there was an improvement between the BLV treatment groups and the delayed treatment group. 
Comparison of Results in Subpopulations for Week 48 
Comparison of Results in Cirrhosis Subpopulations 
Efficacy subgroups for the primary, secondary, and exploratory efficacy end points in Study MYR301 were 
based on the presence of cirrhosis.   
Subgroup Analysis of Combined Response (Primary Efficacy End Point) 
The combined response rate in the BLV 2 mg group was lower in participants with cirrhosis (34.8%) (95% 
CI: 16.4% to 57.3%) than in participants without cirrhosis (53.8%) (95% CI: 33.4% to 73.4%), a likely

reflection of the lower ALT normalization rates seen in participants with cirrhosis. In the BLV 10 mg group, 
the combined response rate was similar for participants with and without cirrhosis: 50.0% (95% CI: 29.1% 
to 70.9%) of participants with cirrhosis versus 46.2% (95% CI: 26.6% to 66.6%) of participants without 
cirrhosis achieved a combined response.

Subgroup Analysis of Undetectable HDV RNA Response (Secondary Efficacy End Point) 
Percentages of participants with undetectable HDV RNA for BLV 2 mg was higher for the participants with 
cirrhosis (21.7%) compared to participants without cirrhosis (3.8%). For BLV 10 mg group, percentages of 
participants  with  undetectable  HDV  RNA  were  similar  for  the  participants  with  cirrhosis  (25.0%)  than  in 
participants without cirrhosis (15.4%).

Subgroup Analysis of Biochemical Response (Secondary Efficacy End Point) 
In the BLV 2 mg group, the percentage of participants with cirrhosis who had normalized ALT (39.1%) was 
lower than the percentage of participants without cirrhosis who had normalized ALT (61.5%). In the BLV 
10 mg group, the percentage of participants with cirrhosis who had normalized ALT (50.0%) was similar to 
the percentage of participants without cirrhosis who had normalized ALT (61.5%).

Additional Subgroup Analysis 
Analysis of these additional subgroups was conducted solely for the primary end point of combined 
response at Week 48.  
Age  Group  (< 45,  ≥ 45  years):  In  the  BLV  2 mg  group,  the  combined  response  rate  was  lower  in 
participants < 45 years of age (35.7%) (95% CI: 18.6% to 55.9%) than in participants ≥ 45 years of age 
(57.1%) (95% CI: 34.0% to 78.2%). In the BLV 10 mg group, the combined response rate was similar 
across age groups: 48.6% (95% CI: 31.4% to 66.0%) in participants < 45 years of age and 46.7% (95% 
CI: 21.3% to 73.4%) in participants ≥ 45 years of age achieved a combined response. 
Sex at Birth: In the BLV 2 mg group, the combined response rate was similar across subgroups for sex at 
birth, with 43.3% (95% CI: 25.5% to 62.6%) of male participants and 47.4% (95% CI: 24.4% to 71.1%) 
of female participants achieving a combined response. In the BLV 10 mg group, the combined response 
rate  was  slightly  higher  for  male  participants  (56.7%)  (95%  CI:  37.4%  to  74.5%)  than  for  female 
participants (35.0%) (95% CI: 15.4% to 59.2%). 
Race (White, Other): In the BLV 2 mg group, the combined response rate was higher in White participants 
(48.8%) (95% CI: 32.9% to 64.9%) than Other participants (25.0%) (95% CI: 3.2% to 65.1%). In the 
BLV 10 mg group, the combined response rate was similar by race, with 46.5% (95% CI: 31.2% to 62.3%) 
of White participants and 57.1% (95% CI: 18.4% to 90.1%) of Other participants achieving a combined 
response.  As  the  majority  of  participants  in  Study  MYR301  were  White  (83.7%  in  the  BLV  2  mg  group; 
86.0% in the BLV 10 mg group), the analysis and 95% CI likely reflects the small number of participants 
in the “other” category.  
Baseline ALT (≤ 1.5 × ULN, > 1.5 × ULN): In the BLV 2 mg group, the combined response rate was similar 
across  subgroups  for  baseline  ALT  levels,  with  40.0%  (95%  CI:  12.2%  to  73.8%)  of  participants  with 
baseline ALT ≤ 1.5 × ULN and 46.2% (95% CI: 30.1% to 62.8%) of participants with baseline ALT > 1.5 × 
ULN achieving a combined response. In the BLV 10 mg group, the combined response rate was also similar, 
with 54.5% (95% CI: 23.4% to 83.3%) of participants with baseline ALT ≤ 1.5 × ULN and 46.2% (95% CI: 
30.1% to 62.8%) of participants with baseline ALT > 1.5 × ULN achieving a combined response. 
Baseline HDV RNA log10 (< Median, ≥ Median): In the BLV 2 mg group, the combined response rate was 
numerically higher in participants with HDV RNA log10 levels ≥ median baseline value (58.3%) (95% CI: 
36.6% to 77.9%) compared with participants with baseline HDV RNA log10 levels < the median (33.3%) 
(95% CI: 15.6% to 55.3%). In the BLV 10 mg group, the combined response rate was numerically lower 
in participants with HDV RNA log10 levels ≥ baseline value (40.0%) (95% CI: 21.1% to 61.3%) compared 
with participants with baseline HDV RNA log10 levels < median (56.0%) (95% CI: 34.9% to 75.6%). 
The MAH concludes that at Week 48, the combined response rates for BLV 2 mg were consistent across 
all major subgroups, including subgroups relating to cirrhosis status.  
Immunogenicity Evaluation Results  
Study MYR301 
Two participants, both of whom were in the BLV 10 mg treatment group, were ADA-positive at baseline. 
By Week 16, 5 participants (10.2%) in the BLV 2 mg group and 5 participants (10.0%) in the BLV 10 mg 
group were ADA-positive. Over the 48-week treatment period, 22.4% (11 of 49) of participants treated in 
the BLV 2 mg group and 18.0% (9 of 50) of participants treated in the BLV 10 mg group were ADA-
positive, indicating that ADA prevalence was not impacted by dose.  
EMA/CHMP/763187/2022 
Page 26/43 
 
 
 
 
  
The change from baseline to Week 48 in the anti-BLV antibodies concentration showed a mean (SD) 
increase, with a larger increase seen in the BLV 10 mg group (345 [1294] ng/mL) in comparison to the 
BLV 2 mg group (127 [378] ng/mL).  
The difference between Week 24 and Week 48 for ADA prevalence was small: the number of participants 
who were positive for ADA at Week 24 were 5 participants for the BLV 2 mg group and 7 participants for 
the BLV 10 mg group, and at Week 48 were 6 participants and 3 participants for the BLV 2 mg and BLV 
10 mg groups, respectively; therefore, efficacy by ADA assessment was not repeated with the Week 48 
data.  
Table 17. ADA positivity overview for 2mg and 10 mg treatment groups  
Integrated summary of immunogenicity and impact on efficacy in Studies MYR202, MYR203 and MYR301 
MYR202 was a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical study to assess efficacy and safety of 
3 doses of bulevirtide for 24 weeks in combination with tenofovir compared to tenofovir alone to suppress 
HBV replication in patients with chronic hepatitis D.  MYR203 was a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, 
randomized, comparative, parallel arm phase 2 study to assess efficacy and safety of bulevirtide in 
combination with peginterferon alfa-2a versus peginterferon alfa-2a alone in patients with chronic viral 
hepatitis B with Delta-agent. 
The incidence and prevalence up to Week 24 and Week 48 are summarized by treatment group (2mg and 
10mg BLV monotherapy), see tables below.  
There were no meaningful differences in efficacy endpoints (combined response, viral response, and ALT 
normalization) between clinical trial participants with and without ADAs in the BLV 2 mg and 10 mg 
groups at Week 24 and Week 48, see table below.

Clinical Virology  
Resistance testing included sequencing of the N-terminal of PreS1 domain of HBV, covering BLV sequence 
positions (PreS1 BLV region) , and the HDV HDAg gene. Moreover, there was phenotypic testing of clinical 
isolates at baseline and Week 24 or Week 48 for participants with virologic breakthrough (VB, defined as 2 
consecutive increases in HDV RNA of ≥1 log10 IU/mL from nadir or 2 consecutive HDV RNA values ≥LLOD 
if previously <LLOD) or non-responders (decline <1 log10 IU/mL). In addition, host NTCP polymorphism 
analysis was performed for these participants at baseline. 
Week 24 Resistance Analysis 
EMA/CHMP/763187/2022 
Page 28/43 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Resistance analysis was performed on 8 participants who were non-responders at Week 24 with 6 and 2 
participants in the BLV 2 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively. No participants experienced VB at Week 24. 
No amino acid substitutions at HBV N-terminal of PreS1 domain covering BLV sequence positions (PreS1 
BLV region) or HDV HDAg associated with reduced susceptibility to BLV were identified in the isolates from 
any of these 8 participants at baseline and Week 24.  
In the BLV 2 mg group, 6 participants qualified for phenotypic analysis due to less than 1 log10 HDV RNA 
decline from baseline. At baseline, EC50 data was obtained from 4 of 6 non-responders with EC50 values 
ranging from 0.31 nM to 0.47 nM. At Week 24, EC50 data was obtained from 3 of 6 non-responders with 
EC50 values ranging from 0.31 nM to 0.63 nM. Three non-responders had both baseline and Week 24 EC50 
values available. Phenotypic analysis of the Week 24 clinical isolates from the 3 participants showed that 
there were no changes in sensitivity to BLV, with 1.0 − 1.3 fold change range in EC50 values for the Week 
24 isolates compared to the corresponding baseline isolates. 
In the BLV 10 mg group, 2 participants qualified for phenotypic analysis due to less than 1 log10 HDV RNA 
decline from baseline. At baseline, EC50 data was obtained from both the 2 non-responders with an EC50 
value of 0.38 nM and 0.09 nM respectively. At Week 24, EC50 data was only obtained from 1 non-responder 
with an EC50 value of 0.55 nM. Phenotypic analysis showed that there was no change in sensitivity to BLV, 
with a 1.4 fold change in EC50 value for the Week 24 isolate compared to the corresponding baseline isolate 
Week 48 Resistance Analysis  
Resistance  analysis  was  performed  on  11  participants  who  experienced  VB  (5  participants)  or  non-
responders  (6  participants)  at  Week  48  with  9  and  2  participants  in  the  BLV  2  mg  and  10  mg  groups, 
respectively.  No  amino  acid  substitutions  at  HBV  N-terminal  of  PreS1  domain  covering  BLV  sequence 
positions (PreS1 BLV region) or HDV HDAg associated with reduced susceptibility to BLV were identified in 
the isolates from any of these 11 participants at baseline and Week 48 (Table 13 and 14).  
Phenotypic analysis of the Week 48 clinical isolates from the 5 participants in the 2 mg arm who qualified 
for analyses showed that there were no changes in sensitivity to BLV, with 0.8 −1.5 fold change range in 
EC50 values for the Week 48 isolates compared to the corresponding baseline isolates (Table 13). For the 
10 mg arm there was one clinical isolated with a substitution, and there was no change in sensitivity to 
BLV, with a 1.3 fold change in EC50 value (Table 14).  
In addition, 1 baseline NTCP variant detected in 1 non-responder (also non-responder at week 24) was also 
observed in responders. Another baseline NTCP variant detected in 1 non-responder (also non-responder 
at week 24) was not at the NTCP binding region, therefore is unlikely to affect BLV binding and the treatment 
outcomes.

The BLV EC50 values from 116 baseline samples from participants showed similar susceptibility to BLV in 
vitro  in  participants  across  different  treatment  response  groups.  In  the  BLV  2  mg  treatment  arm  (non-
responder, median EC50=0.42 nM; partial responder, EC50=0.38 nM; responder, EC50=0.27 nM) as well 
as the 10 mg treatment arm (non-responder, median EC50=0.24 nM; partial responder, EC50=0.41 nM; 
responder, EC50=0.41 nM). These results showed no differences compared to the delayed treatment group 
(EC50=0.35 nM).

7.3 Assessor’s Discussion – efficacy 
Study MYR301  is  a  Phase 3,  randomized,  open-label,  multicenter,  parallel-group  study  comparing  the 
efficacy  and  safety  of  BLV administered  as  delayed  treatment  (10 mg/day  after  48 weeks)  versus 
immediate  treatment  (2 mg  or  10 mg/day)  for  the  treatment  of  CHD  for  144  weeks.  A  total  of 
150 participants were randomized (delayed treatment group: 51 participants; BLV 2 mg treatment group: 
49 participants;  BLV  10 mg  treatment  group:  50 participants).  Of  the  99 participants  randomized  and 
treated  with  BLV,  4 participants  discontinued  the  study  prior  to  the  Week 48  data  cutoff  date,  due  to 
withdrawal of consent (n=3) and physician decision (n=1). Interim results after 48 weeks are presented.   
Superiority of BLV treatment vs. delayed treatment was demonstrated at 48 weeks in that 42.9% in 2 mg 
BLV treatment group and in 48.0% in the 10 mg group achieved the primary efficacy endpoint (undetectable 
HDV RNA or decrease in HDV RNA by ≥ 2 log10 IU/mL from baseline and ALT normalization) compared to 
only 2 % in the delayed treatment group. The key secondary endpoint “the proportion of participants with 
undetectable  HDV  RNA” was not  statistically  significant  between  the  2  mg  (12.2%)  and  10  mg  (20.0%) 
BLV treatment groups. However, a difference is noted compared to the participants in the delayed treatment 
group where none achieved the secondary endpoint.  
Additional  secondary  endpoints  were  explorative.  More  patients  with  ALT  normalisation,  changes  in  liver 
stiffness and HDV RNA decrease by ≥ 2 log10 IU/mL from baseline were observed in both treatment groups 
compared  to  the  delayed  treatment  arm.  Subgroup  analyses  on  cirrhotic  patients  indicated  a  treatment 
effect of BLV. A numerically larger proportion of cirrhotic patients achieved the primary endpoint in the 10 
mg BLV treatment group compared to the 2 mg BLV group, implying a dose dependent increase in efficacy.   
The MAH has provided integrated clinical immunogenicity data which was also assessed as part of the latest 
PSUSA (period 31 January 2022 to 30 July 2022).  It is agreed that there were no meaningful differences 
in  efficacy  endpoints  (combined  response,  viral  response,  and  ALT  normalization)  between  clinical  trial 
participants  with  and  without  ADAs  in  the  BLV  2  mg  and  10  mg  groups  at  Week  24  and  Week  48.  The 
Hepcludex EU SmPC has been updated with a statement related to immunogenicity and ADA prevalence in 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC which is endorsed. 
Resistance  analysis  showed  that  patients  who  experienced  virological  breakthrough  at  48  weeks  did  not 
have PreS1 BLV region or HDAg amino acid substitutions, neither at baseline nor at week 48. Phenotyping 
at week 24 and 48 demonstrated that the clinical isolates tested remained sensitive to BLV. In addition, 
the  BLV  EC50  values  from  baseline  samples  were  similar  across  non-responders,  participants  with  VB, 
partial responders and virologic responders.  
Off-treatment durability of virological responses remain to be evaluated.  
Sample switches were detected by the MAH during resistance analysis week 48 and therefore other 
possible switches were evaluated by assessment of individual participant HDV RNA vs time curves and bi-
directional viral blips, defined as any fluctuation of > 2 log10 from the preceding and subsequent 
timepoints for all participants in Study MYR301. Additional sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were 
undertaken, and a total of 8 participants (4 pairs) were identified as having switched samples.  
Once the issue was discovered all participants samples were evaluated for potential switches. No 
additional switches were identified which is reassuring and the approach used seems appropriate. 
The MAH performed audits at the responsible sites. Most likely the switches occurred during blood draw 
because quality control checks were not properly followed at the impacted sites. The switched or 
compromised samples were from three different sites in Russia and one in Germany. All of the Study 
MYR301 sites were retrained on bio-sample management as part of the immediate corrective action. It is 
acknowledged that switches most likely occurred due to inadequate training of site staff. 
EMA/CHMP/763187/2022 
Page 31/43 
 
 
 
 
  
The MAH claimed the effect on other laboratory values other than HDV-RNA is minimal.  Analytes that 
were included in the same kits as the impacted samples were considered as probable switches and 
treated as missing data, this corrective action is supported. Different processes were in place for safety 
samples which were analysed on the same day for real time ongoing safety assessments. The MAH has 
conducted a review of the impacted participants samples (hematology parameters, serum chemistries, 
including alanine aminotransferase levels, and total bile salt levels) and this analysis did not indicate that 
switching of safety samples had occurred. 
Overall, the actions taken by the MAH seem sufficient to ensure no additional samples were switched and 
the MAH will proactively assess for potential switches in subsequent analyses of participants in the study. 
It is agreed that the interpretation of the results from Study MYR301 remains unchanged. 
The MAH has suggested to update section 5.1 in the SmPC which was endorsed with adjustments as 
specified in the product information sections of the AR and the SmPC. In general, only type I error-
controlled data should constitute claims regarding the product performance. The MAH suggested including 
a claim regarding liver stiffness in the SmPC Section 5.1. However, the observed decrease in LSM with 
BLV treatment seem to more likely be due to decreased necroinflammation than improved/stable fibrosis. 
As the LSM data is only of exploratory nature and the evidence for a notable impact on fibrosis is weak, 
including these data in the SmPC is not supported. 
Data confirm the efficacy of BLV as well as the selection of the 2 mg dose. 
The benefit remains positive.  
8. Clinical Safety aspects 
8.1. Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Sources of Data Supporting the Clinical Safety of Bulevirtide 
The safety analysis consists of on-treatment Week 48 safety data from the ongoing Study MYR301 (Table 
1). Supportive pooled safety data analysis from Week 48 of the Phase 2 Study MYR203 and the Phase 3 
Study MYR301 are also included to support the proposed  presentation of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
and their frequencies in the EU summary of product characteristics (SmPC) updates. 
An overview of the MYR301 Week 48 safety data is presented by randomized treatment group. In addition, 
the safety data from the pooled clinical studies were utilized to revise frequencies of adverse events (AEs) 
considered to be adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or laboratory abnormalities associated with BLV treatment.

Analysis of Adverse Events 
All  AEs  presented  were  treatment-emergent  and  are  referred  to  as  AEs  throughout  this  document. 
Additionally, the relationship of AEs to study treatments and severity of AEs was investigator assigned. 
Study MYR301 AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs leading to study drug discontinuation, and AEs of 
interest are summarized below.  
For AEs that were considered to be ADRs or laboratory abnormalities to BLV, on-treatment Week 48 safety 
data from Study MYR301 were pooled with on-treatment Week 48 safety data from Study MYR203 to align 
with the proposed EU SmPC updates. 
8.2. Results 
Overall Extent of Exposure 
The  safety  profile  of  BLV  presented  in  this  summary  for  Study  MYR301  is  based  on  data  from  150 
participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug (BLV 2 mg treatment group: 49 participants; BLV 
10 mg treatment group: 50 participants) or randomized to delayed treatment group (51 participants)  
The  mean  (SD)  duration  of  exposure  to  study  drug  in  Study  MYR301  was  similar  between  the  2 BLV 
treatment groups: 47.90 (0.38) weeks (for BLV 2 mg) and 45.75 (8.83) weeks (for BLV 10 mg).  
Adverse events 
Overall Summary of Adverse Events 
Table 23 provides an overall summary of AEs by treatment group in Study MYR301 up to Week 48. The 
percentages of participants in each treatment group who experienced at least 1 AE were similar across the 
treatment groups. 
The majority of AEs considered related to study drug by the investigator were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Few 
participants  had  Grade 3  AEs  considered  related  to  study drug  (BLV  2 mg  treatment  group:  2.0%, 
1 participant;  BLV 10  mg  treatment  group:  6.0%,  3 participants);  there  were  no  participants  who 
experienced  a  Grade 4  AE.  Frequencies  of  Grade  3  or  4  AEs  were  similar  across  all  treatment  groups 
EMA/CHMP/763187/2022

(delayed treatment group: 5.9%, 3 participants; BLV 2 mg treatment group: 10.2%, 5 participants; BLV 
10 mg treatment group: 8.0%, 4 participants). 
Serious  adverse  events  were  similar  across  treatment  groups  (delayed  treatment  group:  2.0%,  1 
participant;  BLV  2 mg  treatment  group:  4.1%,  2  participants;  BLV  10 mg  treatment  group:  2.0%,  1 
participant), and none were considered related to BLV. No participants discontinued study drug due to AEs 
and no deaths were reported.

In the BLV 10 mg group, the following nonbradycardia cardiac AEs occurred in 1 participant (2.0%) each: angina 
pectoris, atrioventricular block first degree, and tachycardia. 
Adverse events were coded according to MedDRA Version 24.0. 
Treatment-emergent events began on or after the study drug start date up to 30 days after permanent discontinuation of 
study drug or led to premature study drug discontinuation. For delayed treatment group, treatment-emergent events began 
on or after the randomization date up to the Week 48 visit date, or up to study discontinuation date if discontinued study 
before the Week 48 visit. 
Multiple AEs were counted only once per participants for the highest severity grade for each SOC and PT. 
System organ classes were presented alphabetically, and PTs within SOC were presented by descending order of the 
total frequencies.

The following AEs were observed in ≥ 10% of participants and occurred more frequently in the BLV 2 mg 
and  10 mg  treatment  groups  than  in  the  delayed  treatment  group;  all  are  considered  ADRs  (fatigue, 
injection site reactions, headache, pruritus) or laboratory abnormalities (eosinophilia) associated with BLV 
treatment: 
Eosinophilia: 10.2% (5 participants) in the BLV 2 mg treatment group and 10.0% (5 participants) in the 
BLV 10 mg treatment group versus 0 in the delayed treatment group 
Fatigue: 10.2% (5 participants) in the BLV 2 mg treatment group and 14.0% (7 participants) in the BLV 
10 mg treatment group versus 2.0% (1 participant) in the delayed treatment group 
Injection  site  reactions:  16.3%  (8  participants)  in  the  BLV  2 mg  treatment  group  and  30.0% (15 
participants) in the BLV 10 mg treatment group (based on AEs under the MedDRA high-level term [HLT] 
“injection  site  reactions”)  versus  0  in  the  delayed  treatment  group  (note:  this  group  received  no 
injections of study drug).   
Headache: 18.4% (9 participants) in the BLV 2 mg treatment group and 20.0% (10 participants) in the BLV 
10 mg treatment group versus 0 in the delayed treatment group 
Pruritus: 12.2% (6 participants) in the BLV 2 mg treatment group and 16.0% (8 participants) in the BLV 
10 mg  treatment  group  versus  0  in  the  delayed  treatment  group);  pruritus  is  described  further  in 
Section 0. 
The frequencies and types of AEs were similar in both the BLV 2 mg and 10 mg treatment groups, with the 
exception of the AEs with the HLT “injection site reactions” (ie, injection site reaction, erythema, pruritus, 
swelling),  which  were  reported  more  frequently  in  participants  randomized  to  the  BLV  10 mg  treatment 
group than those in the BLV 2 mg treatment group. 
Adverse Events from Pooled Safety Data Analysis of Studies MYR203 and MYR301 Compared With 
Adverse Events in Study MYR301 
Table 25  presents  a  summary  of  ‘very  common’  AEs  (experienced  by  ≥ 10%  of  participants)  in  any 
treatment group in the pooled data from Studies MYR203 (Week 48) and MYR301 (Week 48). 
The following AEs were observed very commonly (in ≥ 10% of participants) in either or both Study MYR301 
Week 48 analysis and the pooled analysis of safety data and had an increased frequency in the BLV groups 
compared with the delayed treatment group; all considered to be ADRs to BLV.  
Headache:  BLV  2 mg  treatment  group:  18.4%  (9  participants)  in  Study  MYR301  and  15.6%  (10 
participants) in the pooled data; BLV 10 mg treatment group: 20.0% (10 participants) in Study MYR301

Eosinophilia:  BLV  2 mg  treatment  group:  10.2%  (5  participants)  in  Study  MYR301  and  9.4%  (6 
participants) in the pooled data; BLV 10 mg treatment group: 10.0% (5 participants) in Study MYR301 
and 7.7% (5 participants) in the pooled data (Section 0) 
Fatigue: BLV 2 mg treatment group: 10.2% (5 participants) in Study MYR301 and 9.4% (6 participants) 
in the pooled data; BLV 10 mg treatment group: 14.0% (7 participants) in Study MYR301 and 10.8% 
(7 participants) in the pooled data.  
Total  bile  acids  increased*:  BLV  2 mg  treatment  group:  2.0%  (1  participant)  in  Study  MYR301  and 
18.8% (12 participants) in the pooled data; BLV 10 mg treatment group: 6.0% (3 participants) in Study 
MYR301 and 27.7% (18 participants) in the pooled data 
* Note, the reporting of AEs associated with total bile salt elevations was carried out differently across the 
studies: in Study MYR203, elevations were reported by the investigator as AEs related to study treatment; 
in  Study  MYR301,  only  bile  salt  elevations  that  were  symptomatic  or  judged  by  the  investigator  to  be 
clinically  significant  were  reported  as  AEs.  This  change  in  protocol-specified  reporting  accounts  for  the 
difference in frequency of the AE of total bile acids increased in Study MYR301.

Adverse events were coded according to MedDRA Version 24.0. 
Treatment-emergent events began on or after the study drug start date up to 30 days after permanent discontinuation 
of study drug, or led to premature study drug discontinuation. For delayed treatment group in Study MYR301, treatment-
emergent events began on or after the randomization date up to Week 48 visit date, or up to the discontinuation date if 
participants discontinued before Week 48. 
Multiple AEs were counted only once per participant for the highest severity grade for each SOC and PT. 
SOCs were presented alphabetically and PTs within SOC were presented by descending order of the total column. 
For Study MYR301, only symptomatic bile acids increase cases were collected. 
Other Adverse Events of Interest 
Hepatic Safety 
All Hepatic AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, and none resulted in discontinuation of study drug.  
EMA/CHMP/763187/2022 
Page 37/43 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
In Study MYR301, the Hepatic AEs by treatment group were as follows; all observed events had a frequency 
of < 10%: 
•  Delayed treatment group: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST)  increased  (5.9%,  3  participants  each);  gamma-glutamyltransferase  increased  (2.0%, 
1 participant) 
•  BLV 2 mg treatment group: ALT increased, hyperbilirubinemia, blood bilirubin increased (4.1%, 2 
participants each); AST increased, hepatic pain (2.0%, 1 participant each) 
•  BLV  10 mg  treatment  group:  ALT  increased  (6.0%,  3  participants);  hyperbilirubinemia,  gamma-
glutamyltransferase  increased  (4.0%,  2  participants  each);  AST  increased,  blood  bilirubin 
increased, hepatic pain (2.0%, 1 participant each) 
To evaluate the potential for liver toxicity with BLV, an analysis of potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI) 
based  on  the  principles  of  Hy’s  Law  was  performed  using  the  following  3 laboratory-based  criteria:  ALT 
and/or  AST  > 3 ×  upper  limit  of  normal  (ULN)  and  total  bilirubin  > 2  × ULN;  ALT  > 5 × ULN;  and  total 
bilirubin > 2 × ULN. Given that all the participants in this analysis have an underlying liver disease, these 
criteria provide a conservative evaluation of the potential for liver toxicity, according to the MAH. 
Participants who met the criteria only at baseline were excluded from the analyses as these events were 
not considered treatment emergent. In the BLV treatment groups, 11.1% (11 of 99) of participants met 
the specified laboratory-based criteria while on treatment: 6 participants in the BLV 2 mg treatment group 
and 5 participants in the BLV 10 mg treatment group (compared with 19.6% [10 of 51] of participants in 
the delayed treatment group). None of these events were considered to meet criteria for Hy’s Law cases 
due to potential alternative etiologies from underlying HDV infection and medical history. 
An  external  Hepatic  Safety  Adjudication  Committee  (HSAC)  was  implemented  to  assess  all  severe  and 
serious AEs related to the hepatobiliary system and other significant safety issues as considered necessary 
by  the  sponsor.  The  HSAC  independent  review  of  these  cases  of  potential  DILI  concurred  with  the 
assessment that none of these cases are consistent with BLV-induced liver injury. 
In the pooled analyses of safety data, on-treatment hepatic events were observed at similar frequencies to 
Study MYR301 for the BLV 2 mg and BLV 10 mg treatment groups.  
Eosinophilia 
Both AEs and laboratory abnormalities associated with eosinophilia are described below. 
In  Study  MYR301,  the  AEs  of  eosinophilia  and  eosinophil  count  increased  by  treatment  group  were  as 
follows: 
•  Delayed treatment group: eosinophil count increased (2.0%, 1 participant) 
•  BLV 2 mg treatment group: eosinophilia (10.2%, 5 participants) 
•  BLV  10 mg  treatment  group:  eosinophilia  (10.0%,  5  participants)  and  eosinophil  count  increased 
(2.0%, 1 participant) 
All  eosinophilia  AEs  were  Grade 1  in  severity,  and  none  resulted  in  discontinuation  of  study  drug  or 
interruption of study treatment. The eosinophilia AEs were considered related to study drug for 8.2% (4 of 
49) of participants in the BLV 2 mg treatment group and 6.0% (3 of 50) of participants in the BLV 10 mg 
EMA/CHMP/763187/2022

treatment group. The AE of eosinophil count increased was considered by the investigator to be related to 
study drug only for 1 participant (2.0%) in the BLV 10 mg treatment group. Overall, the frequency of AEs 
of eosinophilia and eosinophil count increased were comparable for participants treated with BLV 2 mg and 
BLV 10 mg. Of the events considered related to study drug by the investigator, 1 participant had a hepatic 
AE of GGT increased, which was concurrent with eosinophil count increased. 
In  the  pooled  analysis  of  safety  data  from  Studies  MYR203  and  MYR301,  the  AEs  of  eosinophilia  and 
eosinophil count increased by treatment group were as follows: 
•  Delayed treatment group: eosinophil count increased (2.0%, 1 participant) 
•  BLV 2 mg treatment group: eosinophilia (9.4%, 6 participants) 
•  BLV 10 mg treatment group: eosinophilia (7.7%, 5 participants) and eosinophil count increased (1.5%, 
1 participant) 
Given these results, the frequency of eosinophilia in participants receiving BLV 2 mg in the pooled data was 
categorized as common (1 to < 10% of participants). 
Laboratory Abnormalities 
Six  participants  (2 participants  in  the  BLV  2 mg  and  4  participants  in  the  BLV  10 mg  treatment  groups) 
experienced  persistent  elevation  of  absolute  eosinophils  above  ULN  on  ≥ 2 consecutive  visits.  The 
elevations in eosinophils were generally transient and resolved with ongoing BLV treatment.  
Eosinophil Laboratory Abnormalities and Analysis for Potential Association with DILI  
Although  eosinophilia  can  be  indicative  of  DILI,  none  of  the  6 participants  who  experienced  persistent 
elevation  of  absolute  eosinophils  (defined  above)  met  the  laboratory-based  criteria  for  potential  DILI. 
However, 1 of the 6 participants in the BLV 10 mg treatment group who experienced persistently elevated 
eosinophil  counts  had  a  nonconcurrent  hepatic  AE  of  blood  bilirubin  increased  (there  was  a  potential 
alternative  etiology  to  the  event:  the  participant  had  underlying  cirrhosis  and  had  ongoing  chronic 
pancreatitis and chronic cholecystitis, both of which are known to cause elevations in serum bilirubin). 
Injection Site Reactions 
Across the BLV development program, participants  randomized to the BLV 10 mg treatment group were 
required to administer  2 injections of BLV 5 mg given daily, compared with 1 injection daily for the BLV 
2 mg treatment group. 
In  Study  MYR301,  injection  site  reactions  were  evaluated  using  the  HLT  of  “injection  site  reactions”; 
additionally, local reactions at the injection site were evaluated by the investigator according to the table 
for  clinical  abnormalities  from  “Guidance  for  Industry:  Toxicity  Grading  Scale  for  Healthy  Adult  and 
Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine Clinical Trials.  
In  Study  MYR301,  AEs  in  the  HLT  “injection  site  reactions”  occurred  very  commonly  (ie,  in  ≥ 10% 
of participants)  in  the  BLV-containing  treatment  groups,  with  higher  frequencies  seen  in  the  BLV  10  mg 
treatment group (30.0%, 15 participants) than in the BLV 2 mg treatment group (16.3%, 8 participants). 
This is likely due to the higher daily injection burden in the BLV 10 mg treatment group (2 daily injections 
versus 1 daily injection). 
All but 2 of the observed local reactions at injection sites were of mild intensity (2 participants in the BLV 
10 mg treatment group had moderate erythema/redness). 
EMA/CHMP/763187/2022 
Page 39/43 
 
 
 
 
  
In the pooled analyses of safety data, injection site reactions were analyzed using the same approach as in 
Study  MYR301,  utilizing  the  HLT  “injection  site  reactions.”  Injection  site  reactions  in  the  pooled  clinical 
study data were also very commonly observed (ie, in ≥ 10% participants) in both of the BLV-containing 
groups. Frequencies of injection site reactions in the pooled data were higher in the BLV 10 mg treatment 
group (27.7%, 18 participants) than in the BLV 2 mg treatment group (15.6%, 10 participants). 
The injection site reaction AEs by BLV treatment group and delayed treatment in Study MYR301 and in the 
pooled  data  are  presented  in    (Table 26.  As  there  were  no  study  drug  injections  for  participants  in  the 
delayed  treatment  group  through  Week  48,  no  injection  site  reaction  occurred  in  this  group  (Table 26).

AE = adverse event; BLV = bulevirtide (GS-4438), formerly known as Myrcludex B; PT = preferred term 
Adverse events were coded according to MedDRA Version 24.0. 
Treatment-emergent events began on or after the study drug start date up to 30 days after permanent discontinuation 
of study drug, or led to premature study drug discontinuation. For delayed treatment group in Study MYR301, treatment-
emergent events began or worsened after the randomization date up to Week 48 visit date, or up to the discontinuation 
date if participants discontinued before Week 48. 
Multiple AEs were counted only once per participant for the highest severity grade for each PT. 
PTs were presented by descending order of the total column.

Hypersensitivity, Angioedema, and Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Responses 
In Study MYR301, no participants experienced an anaphylactic reaction or anaphylactoid response or had 
an  AE  of  hypersensitivity.  One  participant  in  the  BLV  2 mg  treatment  group  experienced  an  AE  of 
angioedema  on  Day  109  that  was  nonserious,  Grade  2  in  severity,  and  not  considered  related  to  BLV 
therapy.  
In the pooled analyses of safety data, one participant experienced an AE of angioedema in the BLV 2 mg 
treatment group (from Study MYR301). No participants experienced an AE of hypersensitivity, anaphylactic 
reaction or anaphylactoid response. 
Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders 
In  Study  MYR301,  skin  and  subcutaneous  disorder  AEs  were  experienced  by  a  similar  percentage  of 
participants  in  the  BLV  2 mg  and  BLV  10 mg  treatment  groups  (BLV  2 mg  treatment  group:  18.4%, 
9 participants;  BLV  10 mg  treatment  group:  24.0%,  12 participants),  but  were  only  experienced  by  1 
participant in the delayed treatment group (2.0%, 1 participant). All skin and subcutaneous disorder AEs 
were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, and none resulted in discontinuation of study drug.

The frequency of pruritus in Study MYR301 was 12.2% (6 participants) in the BLV 2 mg group, 16.0% (8 
participants)  in  the  10 mg  group,  versus  0  participants  in  the  delayed  treatment  group.  Therefore,  the 
frequency of pruritus was assessed to be very common (≥ 10% of participants) in Study MYR301. 
In the pooled analyses of safety data, pruritus was observed at a frequency of 10.9% (7 participants) in 
the BLV 2 mg group, 12.3% (8 participants) in the BLV 10 mg group, versus 0 participants in the delayed 
treatment group. Therefore, the frequency of pruritus in the pooled data was categorized as very common 
(≥ 10% of participants). 
Increased Bile Salts 
Bile salt elevations are expected given the known mechanism of action of BLV that inhibits NTCP, a bile acid 
transporter  contained  within  hepatocytes.  In  accordance  with  the  MYR301  study  protocol,  if  an  isolated 
increase  of  total  bile  salts  above  the  ULN  was  both  asymptomatic  and  judged  by  the  investigator  to  be 
clinically insignificant, it was not reported as an AE, which was the case for the vast majority of bile salt 
increases during 48 weeks. 
In Study MYR301, the vast majority of bile salt increases were not reported as AEs. Those reported as AEs 
were asymptomatic but considered clinically significant by the investigator. The frequencies of the AE of 
total bile acids increased were low for both of the BLV treatment groups, but were numerically higher in 
the  BLV  10 mg  treatment  group  than  the  BLV  2 mg  treatment  group  (BLV  2 mg  treatment  group: 
2.0%, 1 participant; BLV 10 mg treatment group: 6.0%, 3 participants).  
In  the  pooled  analyses  of  safety  data,  the  frequency  of  the  AE  of  total  bile  acids  increased  was  18.8% 
(12 participants) in the BLV 2 mg treatment group and 27.7% (18 participants) in the BLV 10 mg group. 
Note that the frequency in the pooled data is higher than in Study MYR301, due to the difference in reporting 
of AEs associated with bile salt elevations in the different studies (Section 0). Given this, the frequency of 
total bile acids increased in the pooled data was categorized as very common (≥ 10%).

Bile Salts and Pruritus 
To assess the possible impact of elevated bile salts associated with BLV treatment on the development of 
pruritus, an ad hoc analysis was performed for participants in MYR301. There did not appear to be a clear 
correlation between the presence of pruritus and the levels of bile salts in either the BLV 2 mg or BLV 10 mg 
treatment group (Figure 2).

Without Pruritus (Safety Analysis Set ) 
Liver-related clinical events 
One liver-related clinical event (bleeding from esophageal varices) was reported in 1 participant (2.0%) in 
the delayed treatment group, and 1 planned liver-related hospitalization not associated with any AE was 
reported in 1 participant (2.0%) in the BLV 2 mg treatment group. 
Antidrug Antibody (ADA)–Positivity Versus –Negativity 
A participant was defined as ADA-positive if at least 1 postbaseline sample was positive and was defined 
as ADA-negative if all postbaseline samples were negative for the confirmatory assay. Overall, there were 
fewer  BLV-treated  participants  in  the  ADA-positive  subgroup  (20.2%,  20 of  99 participants)  than  BLV-
treated participants in the ADA-negative subgroup (78.8%, 78 of 99 participants)  
The most commonly reported AE in the ADA-positive subgroups in both the BLV 2 mg and 10 mg treatment 
groups was injection site reactions. The same was true for the ADA-negative subgroups. 
Antidrug  antibody–positive  participants  generally  had  either  similar  or  less  frequent  events  across  the 
majority  of  preferred  terms  than  ADA-negative  participants  in  the  BLV  treatment  groups.  However, 
interpretation  of  the  significance  of  any  differences  in  individual  AEs  between  ADA-positive  versus 
ADA-negative is limited due to small numbers of events and the differences in sample sizes within the BLV 
2 mg and 10 mg treatment groups. 
Renal Safety 
Overall, the frequencies of AEs of renal and urinary disorders were low across all treatment groups in Study 
MYR301.  During the 48-week period, there were no clinically relevant changes from baseline within

groups or differences between BLV 2 mg and BLV 10 mg in pH, specific gravity, erythrocytes, leukocytes, 
and nitrite parameters measured during urinalysis. 
8.3 Assessor’s Discussion - Safety 
For the safety analysis to support frequencies of AR in the SmPC, a total of 180 individuals from the MYR 
301  and  MYR  203  (thereof  150  individuals  from  the  MYR301  study)  were  included  with  the  following 
distribution: 51 individuals in the delayed treatment arm, 64 individuals in the 2 mg BLV treatment arm 
and 65 individuals in the 10 mg BLV treatment arm.  
In the MYR301 safety data set, 49% in the 2 mg BLV treatment group and 72% in the 10 mg BLV group 
experienced TEAEs related to the study drug. Only isolated SAEs were reported, and none of them evaluated 
as related to treatment.  
TEAEs overrepresented in the BLV treatment groups compared to the delayed treatment arm, and at least 
probably causally related, are overall well reflected in the SmPC and comprise eosinophilia, pruritus, fatigue, 
injection site reactions, headache, arthralgia, nausea and total bile acid increased.  
The  MAH  suggested  updating  the  frequency  of  pruritus  (currently  common)  and  infection  site  reactions 
(currently common) to very common AEs in the SmPC, which is supported based on the presented data. 
All  common  AEs  that  can  be  suspected  to  be  causal  to  BLV  treatment  are  reflected  in  the  SmPC  except 
asthenia and hypertension, which show a dose dependent increase in frequency. Nine cases of hypertension 
have been identified in the clinical trials for which the majority had risk factors or alternative explanations 
including pre-existing conditions. Three cases were identified post-marketing, all with plausible alternative 
explanations. It was agreed with the MAH that based on the totality of data there is insufficient evidence 
to support causality. The MAH suggestion to not include hypertension as an ADR in the SmPC section 4.8 
was supported. 
The MAH identified 9 cases of asthenia in the clinical trial program. In those cases, asthenia was in most 
of the cases mild to moderate and resolved in 5 cases. Patients had multiple underlying diagnoses 
ongoing such as concurrent infection (3), depression (2), lumbal sciatic pain (1) and hemiparesis which 
complicates the possibility to draw firm conclusion regarding causality with the drug. 16 post-marketing 
cases were identified, of which 14 cases presented alternative explanations including additional 
underlying diagnoses and comedication with Peg-INF (11 cases), for which asthenia is listed as a common 
event, which limits the possibility for a firm confirmation of causality. Although terms used to describe 
asthenia (e.g., “(episodic) weakness” or weak side of the body“) or fatigue (“fatigue “, “tiredness “ or 
“exhaustion”) are not entirely interchangeably used, the aspect of a certain similarity is acknowledged. 
Thus, the suggestion of the MAH to not include as an additional separate term in section 4.8 was 
supported. 
The benefit-risk remains positive.

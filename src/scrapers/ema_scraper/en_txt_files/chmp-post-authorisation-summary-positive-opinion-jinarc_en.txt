On 28 June 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Jinarc. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe 
Ltd. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows:2 
“Jinarc is indicated to slow the progression of cyst development and renal insufficiency of 
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in adults with CKD stage 1 to 3 4 at 
initiation of treatment with evidence of rapidly progressing disease (see section 5.1).” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

1.  Introduction 
On 21st September 2022, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study (Study No. HZA107116) for 
Relvar Ellipta and its duplicate Revinty Ellipta (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol [as trifenatate]), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
On 13th November 2013, Relvar Ellipta (Fluticasone furoate/Vilanterol [as trifenatate] Inhalation 
Powder [FF/VI]) was approved by the European Commission (EC) for "the regular treatment of asthma 
in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older where use of a combination product (long-acting 
beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate", as well as for "the symptomatic treatment of 
adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)".  
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, as amended, the application included an EMA 
Decision on the granting of a class waiver for the condition COPD (EMA/825560/2008) and an EMA 
Decision on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for the condition asthma (EMEA-
000431-PIP01-08-M04; P/0049/2012), which included a waiver in children under 5 years of age and a 
deferral in children aged 5-11 years. According to the last EMA Decision (P/0092/2021), the agreed PIP 
for FF/VI (EMEA-000431-PIP01-08-M12) is expected to be completed by October 2022. 
In accordance with Article 46 of the regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, Glaxo Group Ltd hereby submits to 
the EMA a final study report for study number HZA107116 which is part of the last PIP agreed to FF/VI 
(PIP Study 12).  
The MAH stated that the study HZA107116 titled “A randomised, double-blind, parallel group, 
multicentre, stratified, study evaluating the efficacy and safety of once daily fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol inhalation powder compared to once daily fluticasone furoate inhalation powder in 
the treatment of asthma in participants aged 5 to 17 years old (inclusive) currently uncontrolled on 
inhaled corticosteroids” is part of a clinical development program. The type II variation application 
consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e., containing several studies) is expected to be 
submitted by March 2023. A line listing of all the concerned studies has not been submitted by the 
applicant.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Fluticasone furoate/Vilanterol (as trifenatate) Inhalation Powder (FF/VI) is authorised in the European 
Union (EU) as a pre-dispensed multi dose dry powder inhaler in strengths of 100/25 micrograms and 
200/25 micrograms. Both strengths of this inhalation powder for oral inhalation are approved in the 
paediatric population (adolescents aged 12 years and older) for use as a once-daily (OD) treatment of 
asthma. 
In the hereby submitted study, orally inhaled FF/VI (50/25 micrograms or 100/25 micrograms) or 
orally inhaled FF (50 micrograms or 100 micrograms) were administered OD in asthmatic children and

adolescents (aged 5 to <18 years) during its 24-week double-blind treatment period. Both FF/VI and 
FF treatments, were administered as dry inhalation powder by using the same inhaler device (ELLIPTA 
inhaler) as the Relvar/Revinty products approved in the EU. 
The doses of each of the components of FF/VI 50/25 micrograms administered in the 5 to less than 12 
years age group were selected from the results of 2 Phase IIb dose ranging studies (HZA106853 for VI 
and HZA106855 for FF) in asthmatic participants aged 5 to 11 years of age (inclusive). The dose of 
FF/VI 100/25 micrograms was selected as the appropriate dose in this study for the 12 to less than 18 
years age group based on the data generated from the FF and VI Phase 2b and FF/VI Phase 3 studies 
in participants aged 12 years and older. Moreover, FF/VI 100/25 micrograms is the approved starting 
dose in over 60 countries for the once daily treatment of asthma. 
The formulations of FF alone used in the present study are not currently approved in the EU. However, 
as said above, the dose of FF 50 micrograms has been previously assessed in completed paediatric 
studies performed in asthmatic children and adolescents. FF 100 micrograms was selected for this 
study as this is the starting dose currently approved for FF in participants aged 12 years of age and 
older.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for the study number HZA107116 (EudraCT number: 2016-004086-
87) titled “A randomised, double-blind, parallel group, multicentre, stratified, study evaluating the 
efficacy and safety of once daily fluticasone furoate/vilanterol inhalation powder compared to once 
daily fluticasone furoate inhalation powder in the treatment of asthma in participants aged 5 to 17 
years old (inclusive) currently uncontrolled on inhaled corticosteroids”. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study number HZA107116 (EudraCT number: 2016-004086-87) titled “A randomised, double-
blind, parallel group, multicentre, stratified, study evaluating the efficacy and safety of once daily 
fluticasone furoate/vilanterol inhalation powder compared to once daily fluticasone furoate inhalation 
powder in the treatment of asthma in participants aged 5 to 17 years old (inclusive) currently 
uncontrolled on inhaled corticosteroids”. 
Description 
HZA107116 was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, stratified, parallel group, multicentre study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of once daily fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (as trifenatate) inhalation 
powder (FF/VI) compared to once daily fluticasone furoate inhalation powder (FF) in the treatment of 
asthma in participants aged 5 to 17 years old (inclusive) currently uncontrolled on inhaled 
corticosteroids. Study randomisation was stratified by age as follows: participants from 5 to 11 years 
were randomly (1:1) allocated to receive FF/VI 50/25 micrograms or FF 50 micrograms whereas 
participants from 12 to 17 years were randomly (1:1) allocated to receive FF/VI 100/25 micrograms or 
FF 100 micrograms. 
This study was conducted over a total duration of approximately 29 weeks: a 4-week open-label run-in 
period where all participants received fluticasone propionate (FP) 100 micrograms twice daily, a 24-
week double-blind treatment period where participants received FF/VI or FF as described above, and a

1-week follow-up period. Participants received a short-acting beta agonist (SABA) (i.e., 
salbuterol/salbutamol) as needed throughout the entire study period as rescue medication for 
symptomatic relief of asthma symptoms.

6.  Other:  
A participant should not have used any inhaled SABA within 4 hours of Visit 1. 
Screening and Run-in Failures 
Screen failures were defined as participants who consented to participate in the clinical study but were 
not subsequently randomised in the study whereas Run-in failures are withdrawals after Visit 1 
(Screening) and prior to randomisation. 
Participants who failed any of the screening or run-in criteria could be rescreened once after a period 
of at least 1 month from the date of screen failure or run-in failure.  
Any rescreened participant had to satisfy all of the protocol-specified inclusion/exclusion requirements 
at the time of the rescreening visit. Rescreened participants were to be assigned a new participant 
number at the time of rescreening. 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria for Randomisation to Treatment 
Participants had to meet the following criteria to be eligible for randomisation: 
1. Growth 
a. Prepubertal: Tanner Stage 1. 
b. Body weight and BMI: Between the 3rd and 97th percentile based on the US CDC 
standard statistics or any local standards outside the US. 
c. Baseline growth velocity: Between the 3rd and 97th percentile based on North 
America Longitudinal Standard Growth Velocity charts. 
d. Bone age: Within 2 years of participant’s chronological age as determined by 
hand/wrist x-ray using the Greulich and Pyle method during the baseline period.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/49502/2023 
Page 10/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Disease Changes 
a. Prohibited Diseases: No new medical conditions that would have been exclusionary 
at Visit 1. 
3. Medications 
a. Corticosteroid Use: No use corticosteroid during the baseline period that would likely 
have a systemic effect. 
b. Prohibited Medications: No use of any medications during the baseline period that 
were detailed in the inclusion/exclusion criteria during the baseline period for 
worsening asthma symptoms. 
4. Study Compliance: 
a. Responsibility: Participant/parent/guardian had to demonstrate the ability to comply 
with all study procedures during the run-in study period, including proper study 
treatment administration during the randomisation visit. 
b. Single-blind treatment: Complied with single-blind placebo treatment as recorded in 
the daily e-diary and based on the dose counter. Participants did not take their inhaler 
at least 80% of the time during the last 30 days of the run-in period were not eligible 
for randomisation. 
5. Assessments: Able to use the ELLIPTA inhaler correctly. 
A participant was not eligible for randomisation in this study if they had: 
1. Changes in asthma medication that occur after screening. 
2. Occurrence of a culture-documented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the upper or 
lower respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear during the run-in period that led to a change in 
asthma management or, in the opinion of the investigator, was expected to affect the 
participant’s asthma status or the participant’s ability to participate in the study. 
3. Evidence of an exacerbation, defined as: 
• a deterioration of asthma requiring the use of oral corticosteroids for at least 3 days, 
or 
• a depot corticosteroid injection, or 
• an in-patient hospitalisation due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids 
between screening and randomisation. 
4. Clinical visual evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis at the Randomisation Visit. 
5. Unable to use the ELLIPTA inhaler correctly. 
Withdrawal Criteria  
Participants could be discontinued from study intervention at any time by the investigator if the study 
intervention was considered to be detrimental for them to continue on study intervention. Specifically, 
a participant was discontinued from study intervention if he/she met any of the following criteria 
outlined below: 
• A participant became pregnant. 
• Female participants who reached menarche after Visit 1 and who did not agree to follow 1 of 
the options listed in the modified list of highly effective methods for avoiding pregnancy in 
females of reproductive potential (which included abstinence) as outlined in the clinical study 
protocol.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/49502/2023 
Page 11/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• A participant met the liver stopping criteria. 
• A participant met the QTc stopping criteria. 
A participant could discontinue study intervention at any time at his/her own request. An early 
treatment discontinuation visit was conducted within approximately 24 hours of the participant 
stopping study medication. In the event a participant discontinued study intervention at or during a 
scheduled visit, an early treatment discontinuation visit was not required; however, all study 
procedures scheduled at an early treatment discontinuation visit were to be performed at this visit 
instead and reasons for treatment discontinuation must have been collected. These participants were 
not allowed to restart study intervention; however, participants were asked to continue to follow the 
regular visit schedule, including the completion of the daily electronic patient diary (until Visit 6), and 
attending the clinic at Visit 6 to obtain serial FEV1 measurements. The investigator was to prescribe 
appropriate asthma medication to participants who discontinued study intervention and elected to 
continue in the study. After treatment discontinuation, the prohibited medications listed in the clinical 
study protocol were no longer applicable. Every effort was made to contact participants who did not 
attend the end of treatment visit to collect information on any AEs, SAEs and exacerbations, and to 
collect the e-diary. 
A participant could withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request (or at the request of 
his/her legal guardians). In this case, all study-related medications and other study-related materials 
were to be returned to the site by the participant. An early withdrawal visit was to be scheduled within 
approximately 24 hours of the participant withdrawing from the study. In the event a participant 
withdrew at or during a scheduled visit, an early withdrawal visit was not required; however, all study 
procedures scheduled at an early withdrawal visit were to be performed at this visit instead. The 
primary reason for withdrawal from the study was recorded in the e-CRF, and any data collected up 
until the point of withdrawal was used in the analyses. 
Participants Lost to Follow-up  
The following actions were to be taken for participants who failed to attend the clinic for a required 
study visit: 
• The site was to attempt to contact the parent/participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the parent/participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wished to and/or should continue in the study. 
• In cases where the participant was deemed ‘lost to follow-up’, the investigator or designee was to 
make every effort to regain contact with the parent/participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, 
if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent 
methods). These contact attempts were to be documented in the participant’s medical record. 
• If the parent/participant continued to be unreachable, only then was the participant considered to 
have withdrawn from the study, with a primary reason of “Lost to Follow-up”. 
Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria  
Clinical laboratory tests to check liver function were not planned at screening or during study conduct. 
QTc Stopping Criteria

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/49502/2023 
Page 12/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
QT corrected interval by QTcF was used for each individual participant to determine eligibility for and 
discontinuation from the study. 
• The QTc must have been based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate ECGs obtained over a 
brief (e.g., 5 to 10 minutes) recording period. 
A participant who met the bulleted criteria based on the average of triplicate ECG readings was 
withdrawn from study intervention: 
• QTcF >500 ms OR Uncorrected QT >600 ms 
• Change from baseline of QTcF >60 ms. 
For participants with underlying bundle branch block, the discontinuation criteria listed in the clinical 
study protocol were to be followed. 
Treatments 
Different treatments were planned to be administered during the different periods of the study: a 4-
week open-label run-in period, a 24-week double-blind treatment period, and a 1-week follow-up 
period.  
Study interventions 
Study interventions that were administered in this study are detailed in Table 1. 
Orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (FP) 100 micrograms was administered twice daily as dry powder 
inhaler during the 4-week open-label run-in period.  
During the 24-week double-blind treatment period, a fixed-dose combination of FF and VI (50/25 
micrograms for children aged 5 to 11 years and 100/25 micrograms for adolescents aged 12 to 17 
years of age) administered OD as dry powder was evaluated compared to a dose of FF alone (50 
micrograms for children aged 5 to 11 years and 100 micrograms for adolescents aged 12 to 17 years 
of age).

Sample size 
Approximately 2900 participants were to be screened to achieve a total of 870 participants to be 
randomised in a ratio of 1:1 giving 435 randomised participants per arm in the 5 to 17 years old 
population. There were to be 652 randomised participants who were 11 years old or less at screening 
(and at least 163/652 [25%] were to be aged 5 to less than 8 years), giving 326 randomised 
participants per arm in the 5 to 11 years old population, and 218 participants in the 12 to 17 years old 
population. A 70% screening failure rate was expected. 
Assumptions for 5 to 17 Years Old Population 
The sample size calculation for the 5 to 17 years old population was based on the primary efficacy 
endpoint of weighted mean FEV1 (0 to 4 hours). The sample size allowed for up to 20% of participants 
to not contribute to the primary endpoint giving a total of 348 evaluable participants per arm. 
The standard deviation was assumed to be 280 mL for 5 to 11 years old population and 500 mL for 12 
to 17 years old population based on previous studies. Using the assumed representation across the age 
ranged (652 and 218 randomised participants, respectively), a standard deviation of 348 mL has been 
assumed for the 5 to 17 years old population based on a weighted average of the variances (i.e., 
assuming equal means). 
The sample size had 93% power, based on a true population difference of 90 mL and significance 
declared at the two-sided 5% significance level. The smallest observed effect predicted to result in a 
statistically significant difference between treatment groups was 52 mL. 
Assumptions for 5 to 11 Years Old Population 
The sample size calculation for the 5 to 11 years old population was based on the primary efficacy 
endpoint of AM PEF and on the nominated powered secondary endpoint of change from baseline in 
rescue-free 24-hour periods. The sample size allowed for up to 4% of participants to not contribute to 
either endpoint giving a total of 312 evaluable participants per arm.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/49502/2023 
Page 15/60 
 
 
 
 
 
For the primary endpoint of AM PEF, a standard deviation of 30 L/min was assumed, based on previous 
studies. The sample size had 91% power, based on a true population difference of 8 L/min and 
significance declared at the two-sided 5% significance level. 
The smallest observed effect predicted to result in a statistically significant difference between 
treatment groups was 4.7 L/min. 
For the nominated powered secondary endpoint of change from baseline in rescue-free 24-hour 
periods, a standard deviation of 30% was assumed, based on previous studies. The sample size had 
99% power, based on a true population difference of 10% and significance declared at the two-sided 
5% significance level. The smallest observed effect predicted to result in a statistically significant 
difference between treatment groups was 4.7%. 
Assuming a correlation of 0.1 between the primary endpoint and the nominated powered secondary 
endpoint, the overall power for both endpoints in the 5 to 11 years old population was 90%. 
Sample Size Re-estimation 
No sample size re-estimation was performed. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Treatment Assignment 
Participants meeting the criteria for randomisation were randomised to 1 of 2 treatment arms using 
Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS)/Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). Before the study 
was initiated, the telephone number and call-in directions for the IVRS and/or the log in information 
and directions for the IWRS were provided to each site. 
Study intervention was dispensed (according to treatment assigned using IVRS at the study visits 
summarised in the Schedule of Assessments (SoA). Returned study intervention must not have been 
re-dispensed to the participants. 
Blinding 
This was a double-blind study and the following applied: 
• The IVRS/IWRS were programmed with blind-breaking instructions. The blind might have 
been broken if, in the opinion of the investigator, it was in the participant’s best interest for the 
investigator to know the study intervention assignment. GSK had to be notified before the 
blind was broken unless identification of the study intervention was required for a medical 
emergency in which the knowledge of the specific blinded study intervention affected the 
immediate management of the participant’s condition (e.g., an antidote was available). In this 
case, GSK was to be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason that 
the blind was broken was to be recorded in the source documentation and CRF, as applicable. 
• The date and reason for the unblinding was to be fully documented in the CRF and source 
documentation. 
• A participant might have continued in the study if that participant’s treatment assignment 
was unblinded by GSK GCSP personnel. The primary reason for discontinuation (the event or 
Condition which led to the unblinding) was to be recorded in the CRF.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/49502/2023

• GSK’s GCSP staff might unblind the treatment assignment for any participant with an SAE. If 
the SAE required that an expedited regulatory report was to be sent to 1 or more regulatory 
agencies, a copy of the report, identifying the participant’s treatment assignment, might have 
been sent to investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or GSK policy. 
Treatment codes could be unblinded by the investigator or treating physician only in the case of a 
medical emergency or in the event of a serious medical condition, when knowledge of the study 
intervention was essential for the clinical management or welfare of the participant. GSK Global 
Safetystaff could unblind treatment codes in the event of a SAE. 
Statistical Methods 
Analysis Sets 
For purposes of analysis, the following populations were defined: 
• 
Total Population 
The Total Population comprised all participants screened and for whom a record existed on the study 
database and was used for the tabulation and listings of reasons for withdrawal before randomisation. 
• 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) (5 to 17 Years Old) Population 
The ITT (5 to 17 Years Old) Population comprised all participants randomised to treatment and who 
received at least 1 dose of study medication. Randomised participants were assumed to have received 
study medication unless definitive evidence to the contrary existed. Outcomes were reported according 
to the randomised treatment allocation. This constituted one of the 2 primary populations for all 
efficacy measures and safety measures. 
• 
The ITT (5 to 11 Years Old) Population 
The ITT (5 to 11 Years Old) Population is a subset of the ITT (5 to 17 Years Old) Population for 
participants aged 11 years old or younger at screening. Outcomes were reported according to the 
randomised treatment allocation. This constituted one of the 2 primary populations for all efficacy 
measures and safety measures. 
Interim Analyses 
No interim analysis was planned for this study. 
Final Analyses   
•  Hypotheses 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the 5 to 17 years old population was weighted mean FEV1 (0 to 4 
hours). For the 5 to 11 years old population the primary efficacy endpoint was the change from 
baseline in AM PEF and the nominated powered secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in 
rescue-free 24-hour periods. For each of these endpoints there was a single inequality comparison of 
FF/VI versus FF. Demonstration of efficacy for each of these inequality comparisons was based on a 
hypothesis testing approach, whereby the null hypothesis was that there was no difference between 
treatment groups for the endpoint of interest and the alternative hypothesis was that there was a 
difference between treatment groups. A 2-sided 5% risk associated with incorrectly rejecting any of 
the null hypotheses (significance level) was considered acceptable for this study. As the comparisons 
on the 5 to 17 years old population and the 5 to 11 years old population were being made for different 
purposes, they each had distinct multiple testing strategies which were assessed separately. For each

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

of the 2 populations, in order to account for multiplicity across the key endpoints, a step-down closed-
testing procedure was applied to the inequality comparison of FF/VI versus FF whereby this comparison 
was required to be significant at the 0.05 level for the primary endpoint in order to infer on the 
secondary endpoints and inference for a test in the pre-defined hierarchy of secondary endpoints was 
dependent upon statistical significance having been achieved for the previous comparison in the 
hierarchy of secondary endpoints. If a given statistical test failed to reject the null hypothesis of no 
treatment difference at the significance level of 0.05, then all tests lower down in the hierarchy were to 
be interpreted as descriptive only. 
Figure 2 Statistical Testing Strategy for 5 to 17 Years Old Population 
Figure 3 Statistical Testing Strategy for 5 to 11 Years Old Population 
The treatment comparisons defined as part of the multiple testing strategy were limited to the 
specified key comparisons shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Analyses of other efficacy measures in 
either population for the FF/VI versus FF treatment comparison were nested under the secondary 
efficacy measures and no multiplicity adjustment was planned for these other efficacy endpoints. 
In each population, if significance was achieved for the FF/VI versus FF treatment comparison on the 
primary efficacy endpoint, then the secondary endpoints were tested in a closed-testing manner using 
the hierarchy of comparisons. If significance was also achieved for each of the secondary efficacy

endpoints, then all other efficacy endpoints were tested for the FF/VI versus FF treatment comparison 
without further multiplicity adjustment. 
• 
Treatment Comparisons 
−  Primary Comparison of Interest 
The primary treatment comparison for the 5 to 17 years old population was F.F/VI versus FF for the 
primary efficacy endpoint of weighted mean FEV1 (0 to 4 hours) at Week 12.  
The primary treatment comparison for the 5 to 11 years old population was FF/VI versus FF for the 
primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in AM PEF averaged over Weeks 1 to 12. 
Please, note that the population of interest for the EMA was the ITT (5 to 11 Years Old) Population 
whereas the population of interest For the FDA was the ITT (5 to 17 years old). 
−  Other Comparisons of Interest 
The primary treatment comparison of FF/VI versus FF was also performed for the secondary and other 
efficacy endpoints. 
•  Key Elements of Analysis Plan 
The FF/VI 50/25 micrograms and FF/VI 100/25 micrograms treatment groups were combined into one 
FF/VI treatment group for the purpose of reporting. Similarly, the FF 50 micrograms and FF 100 
micrograms treatment groups were combined into one FF treatment group for the purpose of 
reporting.  
The main analysis for all efficacy endpoints evaluated the primary de facto estimand of treatment 
policy (effectiveness-type estimand): the mean difference between treatment groups for the time point 
of interest regardless of whether the participant remained on-treatment. This means that for any given 
endpoint, all available data for a participant were used including any data that had been collected after 
the participant discontinued study medication. Specific details for inclusion were detailed in the 
reporting and analysis plan, but in general the minimum data required was a baseline evaluation and 
at least one postbaseline evaluation. For the powered endpoints only, a secondary de jure efficacy-type 
estimand was evaluated by using only on-treatment data. 
Endpoints relating to daily diary assessments were calculated from all available data over the time 
period of interest. In addition to the Weeks 1 to 12 time period, smaller time periods were also defined 
in order to perform sensitivity analyses. However, for any given time period that was defined, no 
imputations were performed on missing daily diary data within that time period. Any defined time 
period for a diary data endpoint was considered missing if less than 2 days (i.e., 24-hour periods) were 
recorded in that time period. 
For the derivation of the percentage of symptom-free 24-hour periods, a given 24-hour period was 
considered as missing if both the day-time and night-time data were missing or if one was symptom-
free but the other was missing. However, if either the daytime or the night-time has symptoms then 
the 24-hour period were considered not symptom-free. 
The same principals were applied to the derivation of the percentage of rescue-free 24-hour periods. 
Any tests for interactions were 2-sided at the 10% level of significance. In all cases, if any assumptions 
of the proposed method of analyses were not met, alternative methods of analyses were to be used. 
It was anticipated that a large number of centres participated in the study. Therefore, it was likely that 
many centres enrolled very small number of participants. Consequently, all centres within the same 
country were pooled. In addition, if there were any countries enrolling very small numbers in total

(<12 in either of the ITT 5 to 17 or 5 to 11 years old populations), these countries were pooled with 
another country within a similar geographical region. All amalgamations were finalised and 
documented prior to unblinding the treatment codes. These amalgamations were used wherever region 
was incorporated into the analysis. 
Baseline values for each endpoint were those used as appropriate from either Visit 2 or Visit 3 for clinic 
visit endpoints or derived from the last 7 days of the run-in daily diary prior to the randomisation of 
the patient. 
−  Primary Efficacy Analyses 
Primary Efficacy Analyses for 5 to 17 Years Old Population  
To address the primary effectiveness-type estimand, the primary analysis on the ITT (5 to 17 Years 
Old) population included data from all participants regardless of whether or not they were on-
treatment at the time of their Week 12 serial FEV1 measurements.  
To address the secondary efficacy-type estimand, the analysis was repeated using only on-treatment 
data.  
The primary endpoint of weighted mean FEV1 (0 to 4 hours) at Week 12 was derived using the post-
dose assessments (after 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4 hours) with their actual times and using the pre-
dose assessment as the 0-hour measurement. The weighted mean was calculated as the average area 
under the curve using the trapezoidal rule, and dividing by the relevant time interval (i.e., the time 
between the actual time of dose and the actual time of the last FEV1 measurement being used).  
The weighted mean was analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with effects due to 
baseline pre-dose FEV1, region, sex, age and treatment group. The adjusted means for each treatment 
and the estimated treatment differences for the treatment comparison were presented together with 
95% confidence intervals (CI) for the difference and a p-value for the treatment comparison.  
Primary Efficacy Analyses for 5 to 11 Years Old Population  
To address the primary effectiveness-type estimand, the primary analysis on the ITT (5 to11 years old) 
population included all available AM PEF data from Weeks 1 to 12, regardless of whether the 
participant had been still on-treatment at the time of the measurement.  
To address the secondary efficacy-type estimand, the analysis was repeated using only on-treatment 
data.  
The primary endpoint of change from baseline in AM PEF averaged over Weeks 1 to 12 was calculated 
for each participant using only data that were from the first 84 calendar days after randomisation.  
The primary analysis as performed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with effects due to 
baseline AM PEF, region, sex, age and treatment group. The adjusted means for each treatment and 
the estimated treatment differences for the treatment comparison were presented together with 95% 
CIs for the difference and a p-value for the treatment comparison.  
A sensitivity analysis for the primary effectiveness-type estimand was performed including all data 
from Weeks 1 to 12 (regardless of treatment state). For this analysis, the Weeks 1 to 12 time period 
was split into 6 separate time periods: Weeks 1 to 2, Weeks 3 to 4, Weeks 5 to 6, Weeks 7 to 8, 
Weeks 9 to 10 and Weeks 11 to 12. The data was then analysed using a mixed model repeated 
measures (MMRM) model, which allowed for effects due to baseline AM PEF, region, sex, age, time 
period and treatment group. This model also contained a time period-by-baseline interaction term and 
a time period-by-treatment interaction term. Missing data were not implicitly imputed in this analysis.

However, all non-missing data for a participant was used within the analysis to estimate the average 
treatment effect over Weeks 1 to 12. 
−  Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Change from Baseline in the Percentage of Rescue-free 24-Hour Periods for the ITT (5 to 11 
Years Old) Population 
To address the primary effectiveness-type estimand, the primary analysis on the ITT (5 to 11 Years 
Old) population included all available data from Weeks 1 to 12, regardless of whether the participant 
had been still on-treatment at the time of the question.  
To address the secondary efficacy-type estimand, the analysis was repeated using only on-treatment 
data.  
The powered secondary endpoint of change from baseline in the percentage of rescue-free 24-hour 
periods over Weeks 1 to 12 was calculated for each participant using only data that were from the first 
84 calendar days after randomisation.  
The primary analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with effects due to baseline, region, sex, 
age and treatment group. The adjusted means for each treatment and the estimated treatment 
differences for the treatment comparison were presented together with 95% CIs for the difference and 
a p-value for the treatment comparison.  
A sensitivity analysis for the primary effectiveness-type estimand was performed including all data 
from Weeks 1 to 12 (regardless of treatment state). For this analysis, the Weeks 1 to 12 time period 
was split into 6 separate time periods: Weeks 1 to 2, Weeks 3 to 4, Weeks 5 to 6, Weeks 7 to 8, 
Weeks 9 to 10 and Weeks 11 to 12. The data were then analysed using a MMRM model, which allowed 
for effects due to baseline, region, sex, age, time period and treatment group. This model also 
contained a time period-by-baseline interaction term and a time period-by-treatment interaction term. 
Missing data were not implicitly imputed in this analysis.  
However, all non-missing data for a participant were used within the analysis to estimate the average 
treatment effect over Weeks 1 to 12. 
Change from Baseline in the Percentage of Rescue-free 24-Hour Periods for the ITT (5 to 17 
Years Old) Population 
The change from baseline in the percentage of rescue-free 24-hour periods over Weeks 1 to 12 was a 
secondary endpoint for the 5 to 17 years old population and was calculated for each participant using 
only data that were from the first 84 calendar days after randomisation. The primary analysis was 
performed using an ANCOVA model with effects due to baseline, region, sex, age and treatment group. 
Change from Baseline in the Percentage of Symptom-free 24-Hour Periods 
The change from baseline in the percentage of symptom-free 24-hour periods over Weeks 1 to 12 was 
calculated for each participant using only data that were from the first 84 calendar days after 
randomisation. The primary analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with effects due to 
baseline, region, sex, age and treatment group. 
Change from Baseline in AM FEV1

Change from baseline in AM FEV1 at Week 12 was defined using the pre-dose FEV1 assessment at the 
Week 12 clinic visit. Analysis was performed using an MMRM model, which allowed for effects due to 
baseline FEV1, region, sex, age, visit and treatment group. This model also contained a visit-by-
baseline interaction term and a visit-by-treatment interaction term. Missing data were not implicitly 
imputed in this analysis. However, all non-missing pre-dose data for a participant taken at scheduled 
Visits 3, 4 and 5 (Weeks 4, 8 and 12) were used within the analysis to estimate the Week 12 treatment 
effects. 
Change from Baseline in ACQ-5 
Change from baseline in ACQ-5 at Week 24 was analysed using an MMRM model, which will allow for 
effects due to baseline, region, sex, age, visit and treatment group.  
This model also contained a visit-by-baseline interaction term and a visit-by-treatment interaction 
term. Missing data were not implicitly imputed in this analysis. However, all non-missing data for a 
participant taken at scheduled Visits 5 and 8 (Weeks 12 and 24) were used within the analysis to 
estimate the Week 24 treatment effects. 
Weighted Mean FEV1 (0 to 4 hours) for 5 to 11 Years Old Population 
Weighted mean FEV1 (0 to 4 hours) at Week 12 was a secondary endpoint for the 5 to 11 years old 
population. It was analysed using an ANCOVA model with effects due to baseline FEV1, region, sex, 
age and treatment group. 
Change from Baseline in AM PEF for 5 to 17 Years Old Population 
The change from baseline in PM PEF over Weeks 1 to 12 was a secondary endpoint for the 5 to 17 
years old population and was calculated for each participant using only data that were from the first 84 
calendar days after randomisation. The primary analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with 
effects due to baseline, region, sex, age and treatment group. 
Change from Baseline in PM PEF 
The change from baseline in PM PEF over Weeks 1 to 12 were calculated for each participant using only 
data that were from the first 84 calendar days after randomisation. The primary analysis was 
performed using an ANCOVA model with effects due to baseline, region, sex, age and treatment group.

Table 14 Summary of Change from Baseline in AM PEF (L/min) Over Weeks 1 to 12 On- and Post-
Treatment Data - Intent-to-Treat Population (5 to 11 Years Old) 
The LS means change from baseline was 12.0 (Std Err: 1.86) L/min for the FF/VI treatment and 8.8 
(STD Err 1.86) L/min for the FF treatment (Table 15). For the primary comparison of the primary 
endpoint analysis of AM PEF (L/min) over Weeks 1 to 12 on- and post-treatment, using ANCOVA with 
covariates of baseline, region, sex, age and treatment, the difference between treatment of 3.2 L/min 
did not reach statistical significance (p=0.228) (Table 15). 
Table 15 Statistical Analysis of Change from Baseline in AM PEF (L/min) Over Weeks 1 to 12 On- and 
Post-Treatment Data - Intent-to-Treat Population (5 to 11 Years Old) 
Additional statistical analysis supported this result. Using the repeated measures analysis method 
adjusted for baseline, region, sex, age, treatment, week, week by baseline interaction and week by 
treatment group interaction method, gave a treatment difference of 2.5 L/min (95% CI: -2.7,7.6), and 
using Jump to Reference Multiple Imputation method also give a treatment difference of 2.5 L/min 
(95% CI: -2.7,7.6). Including only the on-treatment data, an ANCOVA-based statistical analysis 
resulted in a treatment difference of 3.1 L/min (95% CI: -2.1, 8.3). 
The sensitivity analysis that excluded the data from sites with data concerns was consistent with the 
primary analysis giving a treatment difference of 3.7 L/min (95% CI -1.6, 8.9).

−  Rescue-Free 24-Hour Periods 
Over Weeks 1 to 12, the mean change from baseline for the FF/VI treatment was slightly larger than 
the mean change from baseline for the FF treatment (Table 16). 
Table 16 Summary of Change from Baseline in Percentage of Rescue-Free 24-Hour Periods Over Weeks 
1 to 12 On- and Post-Treatment Data -Intent-to-Treat Population (5 to 11 Years Old) 
The LS means change from baseline was similar between both treatments, i.e., 27.1 (Std Err 1.75) for 
the FF/VI treatment and 25.8 (Std Err 1.74) for the FF treatment. The treatment difference observed 
using the ANCOVA with covariates of baseline, region, sex, age and treatment was: 1.3 (95% CI: -3.6, 
6.2). 
Consistent results were seen when using the repeated measures analysis method (1.4 [95% CI: -3.5, 
6.3]) and the Jump to Reference Multiple Imputation method (1.4 [95% CI: -3.5, 6.3]). Also, 
regarding the on-treatment data only the treatment difference observed was 1.2 (95% CI: -3.7, 6.1). 
The sensitivity analysis that excluded the data from sites with data concerns was consistent with the 
primary analysis giving a treatment difference of 1.5 (95% CI: -3.5, 6.4). 
−  Symptom-Free 24-Hour Periods 
The baseline data of the symptom-free 24-hours period were similar for both treatments. The mean 
(SD) change from baseline over Weeks 1 to 12 in the percentage of symptom-free 24-hour periods 
was 27.2 (33.16%) for the FF/VI treatment and 25.8 (34.94%) for the FF treatment (Table 17).

−  AM FEV1 
FEV1 was measured at Visit 2 (Run-in visit) and Visit 4 to Visit 6. The baseline data of the AM FEV1 
were similar for both treatments (mean [SD] AM FEV1 for FF/VI was 1.413 [0.3744] L and for FF 1.424 
L [0.3998]). 
At Visit 4, the changes from baseline in AM FEV1 showed a difference between FF/VI and FF with a 
mean (SD) change from baseline of 0.237 (0.2682) L for the FF/VI treatment and 0.187 (0.2758) L for 
the FF treatment (Table 18). 
At Visit 5 and 6, the difference between the changes from baseline in AM FEV1 between FF/VI and FF 
treatments were smaller (Table 18).

The mean (SD) values of the ACQ-5 score at baseline were similar in both treatments (mean [SD] 
score in FF/VI was 1.91 [0.808], in FF was 1.83 [0.784]). The improvement in asthma control based 
on the results of ACQ, was similar for both treatments. At Visit 6 (Week 12), the changes from baseline 
were slightly larger for the FF/VI treatment (mean [SD] change -1.15 [0.930]) than for the FF 
treatment (mean [SD] change -1.00 [0.865]), and also at Visit 9 (Week 24), for the FF/VI treatment 
(mean change [SD] -1.25 [0.944]) and for the FF treatment (mean [SD] change -1.13 [0.975]) (Table

−  Exacerbations 
Any asthma exacerbation was reported for 27/337 (8%) participants in the FF/VI group and for 32/336 
(10%) participants of the FF group on- and post-treatment. Most of these participants in both groups 
experienced 1 asthma exacerbation in total. Two asthma exacerbations were reported for 2 (<1%) 
participants in the FF/VI group and for 5 (1%) participants in the FF group. None of the participants in 
either group experienced more than 2 asthma exacerbations on- and post-treatment. 
In the FF group only, 1 participant permanently discontinued the study intervention due to an asthma 
exacerbation. 
All participants in both treatment groups who had an asthma exacerbation received treatment with 
systemic or oral corticosteroids. One participant in the FF/VI group and 2 (<1%) participants in the FF 
group were hospitalised, and none were intubated due to an asthma exacerbation. Three participants 
in the FF/VI group and one in the FF group were reported as visiting ER due to their asthma 
exacerbation. 
•  Other Endpoints: PM PEF 
The baseline data of PM PEF were similar for both treatments, the mean (SD) AM PEF of the FF/VI 
treatment was 205.2 (62.70) L/min, for the FF treatment 208.7 (65.62) L/min (Table 23).

The change from baseline of the PM PEF, measured every evening over Week 1 to 12, was larger in the 
FF/VI treatment than in the FF treatment. The LS mean change (Std Err) was 13.7 (1.80) L/min for the 
FF/VI treatment and 8.1 (1.80) L/min for the FF treatment. The ANCOVA- based statistical analysis 
with covariates of baseline, region, sex, age and treatment showed a treatment difference of 5.6 L/min 
(95% CI: 0.6, 10.6). 
Additional statistical analysis using the repeated measures analysis adjusted for baseline, region, sex, 
age, treatment, week, week by baseline method and Jump to Reference Multiple Imputation method 
were consistent with the main analysis.

Secondary Endpoints 
−  Rescue-Free 24-Hour Periods 
The baseline in percentage of rescue-free 24-hour periods was similar between both treatments. The 
mean change from baseline in the percentage of rescue-free 24-hour periods over Weeks 1 to 12 of 
the treatment period was similar for both treatments (mean [SD] was 25.9 [33.78] for FF/VI treatment 
and 25.8 [36.55] for FF treatment) (Table 25). 
Table 25 Summary of Change from Baseline in Percentage of Rescue-Free 24-Hour Periods Over Weeks

The difference between the treatments in percentage of rescue-free 24-hour periods over Weeks 1 to 
12 of the treatment period was -0.3 (95% CI: -4.5, 3.8) (using an ANCOVA with covariates of baseline, 
region, sex, age and treatment).  
These findings are supported by the statistical analysis using the repeated measures method averaged 
over Weeks 1 to 12 (difference: 0.0 [95% CI: -4.1, 4.2]), and the Jump to Reference method 
(difference: 0.0 [95% CI: -4.1, 4.2]).

FEV1 was measured at Visit 2 (Run-in visit) and Visit 4 to 6. The baseline data of the AM FEV1 were 
similar for both treatments (mean AM FEV1 for FF/VI was 1.665 L and for FF 1.645 L). 
At Visit 4 (Week 4), the changes from baseline in AM FEV1 showed a difference between FF/VI and FF 
with a mean (SD) change from baseline of 0.274 (0.3459) L for the FF/VI treatment and 0.210 
(0.3202) L for the FF treatment. (Table 27). 
At Visit 5 and 6 (after 8 and 12 weeks), the difference between the changes from baseline in AM FEV1

Visit 6 (Week 12) using an alternative missing data rule. This showed a treatment difference at Visit 6 
(Week 12) of 4.4 L/min (95% CI: -2.2, 11.1). 
−  ACQ-5 
ACQ-5 was assessed at Visit 3 (randomisation), Visit 6 (Week 12) and Visit 9 (Week 24). The mean 
values of the ACQ-5 score at baseline were similar in both treatments (mean score in FF/VI was 1.90, 
in FF was 1.82). The improvement in asthma control based on the results of ACQ, was similar for both 
treatments. At Visit 6 (Week 12), the changes from baseline were slightly larger for the FF/VI 
treatment (mean change -1.08) than for the FF treatment (mean change -0.96), and at Visit 9 (Week 
24), the differences in the changes from baseline of the ACQ-5 score were similar (Table 31).

Using the repeated measures analysis adjusted for baseline, region, sex, age, treatment, visit, visit-by-
baseline interaction and visit-by-treatment interaction analysis method, the treatment difference at 
Week 24 was -0.01 (95% CI: -0.10, 0.09). 
−  Exacerbations 
Any asthma exacerbation was reported for 33/454 (7%) participants in the FF/VI group and for 38/448 
(8%) participants of the FF group on- and post-treatment. Most of these participants with asthma 
exacerbations in both groups experienced 1 asthma exacerbation in total; 2 asthma exacerbation were 
reported for 2/454 (<1%) participants in the FF/VI group and for 6/448 (1%) participants in the FF 
group. None of the participants in either group experienced more than 2 asthma exacerbations on- and 
post-treatment. 
In each group, 1 participant permanently discontinued the study intervention due to an asthma 
exacerbation; all participants in both groups received systemic or oral corticosteroids for treatment; 2 
(<1%) participants in both groups each were hospitalised and none were intubated due to an asthma 
exacerbation. None of the participants in either group were in an intensive care unit or in a general 
ward on- and post-treatment, and none were intubated due to an asthma exacerbation. 
•  Other Endpoints: PM PEF 
The baseline data of PM PEF were similar for both treatments, the mean AM PEF of the FF/VI treatment 
was 236.4 L/min, for the FF treatment 235.3 L/min.

Table 32 Summary of Change from Baseline in PM PEF (L/min) Over Weeks 112 On- and Post-Treatment 
Data - Intent-to-Treat population (5 to 17 Years Old) 
The change from baseline of the PM PEF, measured every evening over Weeks 1 to 12, was larger in 
the FF/VI treatment than in the FF treatment (Table 32). The LS mean change (Std Err) was 16.8 
(1.69) L/min for the FF/VI treatment and 8.6 (1.70) L/min for the FF treatment. The ANCOVA-based 
statistical analysis with covariates of baseline, region, sex, age and treatment showed a treatment 
difference of 8.2 L/min (95% CI: 3.5, 12.9). 
Additional statistical analysis using the repeated measures analysis adjusted for baseline, region, sex, 
age, treatment, week, week by baseline method and Jump to Reference Multiple Imputation method 
were consistent with the main analysis.

−  Overview of Adverse Events 
An overview of the AEs occurring during on-treatment is shown in Table 33. Overall, 181/454 (40%) 
participants in the FF/VI group and 163/448 (36%) participants in the FF group experienced at least 1 
AE. In 6 (1%) participants of the FF/VI group and 4 (<1%) participants of the FF group, the 
investigator considered the AEs to be drug-related. In 3 (<1%) participants of the FF/VI group and 1 
participant of the FF group, at least 1 AE led to permanent discontinuation from study intervention or 
to premature withdrawal from the study. In both groups, at least 1 SAE was reported for 5 (1%) 
participants in each group. No drug-related SAE, no fatal AE and no drug-related fatal AE were 
reported.

Treatment-Related Serious Events 
None of the SAEs reported were considered by the investigator to be drug-related. 
•  Other Significant Adverse Events 
−  Adverse Events Leading to Permanent Discontinuation 
For 3/454 (<1%) participants in the FF/VI group, the AEs of intestinal obstruction, lethargy and 
insomnia led to permanent discontinuation, and for 1 participant in the FF group the AE of dysphonia 
led to discontinuation. 
−  Adverse Events of Special Interest 
A summary of all AEs of special interest (AESIs) is shown in Table 35. Slightly more participants 
(44/454 [10%]) participants in the FFV/VI group experienced at least 1 AESI than in the FF group 
(37/448 [8%] participants). 
The majority of AESIs reported were similar in type and frequency in both groups, with the exception 
of hypersensitivity events and glucose events, which were reported in more participants in the FF/VI 
group. Of the hypersensitivity events, allergic rhinitis was the most commonly reported for 19/454 
(4%) participants in the FF/VI group and for 6 (1%) participants in the FF/448 group. Effects on 
glucose were reported for 3 (<1%) participants in the FF/VI group and none in the FF group. The set of 
symptoms of effects on glucose, reported in the FF/VI group comprised increased blood glucose,

•  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
−  Evaluation of Fasting Blood Glucose Pre- and Post-Treatment 
Fasting blood glucose was assessed at Screening and at Visit 9. The summary data are shown in Table 
36. For both treatments, a slight decrease of the fasting blood glucose can be observed (Table 37). 
The LS mean change (Std Err) was similar in both treatments (FF/VI: -0.14 [0.024]; FF: -0.14 
[0.023]). There was also no statistically relevant difference for the changes from baseline between 
both treatments (p=0.970).

−  ECG Recordings 
ECG Values and Change from Baseline 
During the study, ECG recordings were taken at Screening and at Visit 9. Apart from the RR interval 
which showed slight differences between both treatments at Screening and at Visit 9, the median 
values of the parameters at Screening and Visit 9 seem to be similar between both treatments. 
Similarly, the changes from baseline were similar between both treatments and all parameters. 
Statistical analysis of heart rate at Week 9 did not show a difference between both treatments 
(difference 0.0, 95% CI -1.6, 1.6). 
Regarding the individual data, each 1 participant in either group showed prolonged QT intervals, which 
constituted an AE. In addition, in 1 participant in the FF group, a prolongation of the PR interval 
constituted an AE. The prolonged QT intervals were considered by the investigator to be related to the 
study drug, the PR prolongation to be not related to the study drug. All AEs were assessed as mild in 
their intensity. The AEs of prolonged QT intervals were resolving at the end of the study, the PR 
prolongation was resolved. 
Interpretation of ECG Recordings 
In the FF/VI group, the number of participants with abnormal ECG recording was similar at screening 
and Week 9, 65/453 (14%) participants versus 64/402 (16%) participants. In the FF group, 61/448 
(14%) participants showed an abnormal ECG result at screening, and at Visit 9, number of participants 
with abnormal ECG results decreased to 49/398 (12%). 
ECG Data with Potential Clinical Importance 
At screening, Visit 9 and any time post-baseline, ECG findings of clinical importance comprised sinus 
bradycardia, idioventricular rhythm, ectopic supraventricular rhythm and right bundle branch block for 
both treatments. No further ECG findings of clinical importance were reported at any timepoint for 
either treatment. 
At screening, the number of participants of both treatments were comparable for each finding. At Visit 
9 and any timepoint post-baseline, the number of participants with any ECG findings of clinical 
importance increased from to 51/453 (11%) participants to 63/402 (16%) and 66/408 (16%) 
participants, respectively, in the FF/VI group, whereas in the FF group, only a slight increase from

49/448 (11%) participants to 50/398 (13%) and 54/414 (13%) participants, respectively, was 
observed. 
Most often, the symptom sinus bradycardia was reported in both groups, whereas all other symptoms 
were only reported for 1 or 2 participants at any timepoint in either treatment (Table 38).

QTc, QTc(F) and QcTB 
From all participants in both groups, only 1 participant in the FF/VI group showed a QTc(F) value of 
>450 to ≤480 ms at screening. All other participants had QTc(F) values of ≤450 ms. At Visit 9 and 
regarding the maximum value post-baseline, there were 1 participant in the FF/VI group and 2 (<1%) 
participants in the FF group, who had a QTc(F) value of >450 to ≤480 ms. 
Approximately half of the participants in both groups had QTc(F) changes from baseline of 30 ms at 
maximum. None of them had changes to baseline ≥60 ms in either group. 
The statistical analyses of the change from baseline for the QTc(F) data at Week 24 did not reveal a 
statistically relevant change (LS mean [Std Err]: FF/VI = -1.5 [0.74] ms, FF = -0.2 [0.74] ms). There 
was also no statistically relevant difference between both treatments (p = 0.204). 
Regarding the QTc(B) data, no relevant differences between the QTc(F) and the QTc(B) data could be 
seen. 
−  On- and Post-Treatment Pneumonia 
For the FF/VI group, no case of on-treatment pneumonia was reported, 1 participant experienced 
pneumonia during post-treatment. The AE resolved during the observation time, was assessed as 
moderate in their intensity and not considered by the investigator to be drug-related.

(15%) participants showed an abnormal ECG result at screening, and at Visit 9, number of participants 
with abnormal ECG results decreased to 40/298 (13%). 
ECG Data with Potential Clinical Importance 
At screening, Visit 9 and any time point post-baseline, ECG findings of clinical importance comprised 
sinus bradycardia, idioventricular rhythm, ectopic supraventricular rhythm and right bundle branch 
block for both treatments. No further ECG findings of clinical importance were reported at any 
timepoint for either treatment. 
At screening, the number of participants with any ECG abnormality of potential clinical importance was 
similar for both groups (FF/VI: 30 [9%]) versus 32 [10%] participants). 
In the FF/VI group, the number of participants with any ECG findings of clinical importance increased 
from to 30/336 (9%) participants to 49/303 (16%) participants and 52/305 (17%) participants from 
screening to Visit 9 and any timepoint post-baseline, whereas in the FF group, the number of 
participants with ECG findings of clinical importance was similar at all timepoints, 32/336 (10%), 
30/298 (10%) and 32/307 (10%) participants, respectively. 
Most often, the symptom sinus bradycardia was reported in both groups, whereas all other symptoms 
were only reported for 1 or 2 participants at any timepoint in either treatment. 
QTc, QTc(F) and QcTB 
At screening all participants in both groups showed QTc(F) values of ≤450 ms. At Visit 9, 1 participant 
in the FF/VI showed a QTc(F) value within >450 to ≤480 ms. None of the participants in the FF group 
showed a QTc(F) value above 450 ms at any timepoint. 
Approximately half of the participants in both groups had QTc(F) changes from baseline of up to 30 
ms, none of them had changes from baseline >60 ms in either group. 
The statistical analyses of the change from baseline for the QTc(F) at Week 24 data did not reveal a 
statistically relevant change (LS mean [SE]: FF/VI = -1.1 [0.86] ms, FF = 0.4 [0.86] ms). There was 
also no statistically relevant difference between both treatments (p = 0.210). 
Regarding the QTc(B) data, no relevant differences between the QTc(F) and the QTc(B) data could be 
seen.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol inhalation powder (FF/VI) is currently approved by the European 
Commission for the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, 
where use of a combination product (long-acting beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is 
appropriate. 
This Article 46 procedure of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, concerns the submission of the study 
number HZA107116 (EudraCT number: 2016-004086-87). This study is part of the EU Paediatric 
Investigation Plan of FF/VI agreed upon for the treatment of asthma indication in children and 
adolecescents aged 5 to <18 years (EMEA-000431-PIP01-08-M12). 
HZA107116 was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, stratified, parallel group, multicentre study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of once daily (OD) FF/VI compared to OD FF in the treatment of 
asthma in participants aged 5 to 17 years old (inclusive) currently uncontrolled on inhaled 
corticosteroids. Study randomisation was stratified by age as follows: participants from 5 to 11 years 
were randomly (1:1) allocated to receive FF/VI 50/25 micrograms or FF 50 micrograms whereas 
participants from 12 to 17 years were randomly (1:1) allocated to receive FF/VI 100/25 micrograms or 
FF 100 micrograms. This study was conducted over a total duration of approximately 29 weeks: a 4-
week open-label run-in period where all participants received fluticasone propionate (FP) 100 
micrograms twice daily, a 24-week double-blind treatment period where participants received FF/VI or 
FF as described above, and a 1-week follow-up period. Participants received a short-acting beta 
agonist (SABA; i.e. salbuterol/salbutamol) as needed throughout the entire study period as rescue 
medication for symptomatic relief of asthma symptoms. The study design is considered acceptable for 
a phase 3 performed in paediatric asthmatic participants from 5 years of age and older. 
The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of OD FF/VI with OD FF in participants with asthma, 
being the secondary objective the safety assessment of OD FF/VI. In this application, the primary 
endpoint for the 5 to 11 years population (required by EMA] was change from baseline, averaged over 
Weeks 1 to 12 of the treatment period, in pre-dose (i.e., trough) morning peak expiratory flow (AM 
PEF), captured daily via electronic patient diary (eDiary). This was a secondary endpoint for the 5 to17 
years population. Weighted mean FEV1 (0 to 4 hours) at Week 12 was a secondary endpoint for the 5 
to 11 years population, and the primary endpoint for the 5 to 17 years population. Common efficacy 
secondary endpoints to both 5 to 11 years and 5 to 17 years populations included change from 
baseline in: rescue-free 24-hour periods over Weeks 1 to 12 of the treatment period, symptom-free 
24-hour periods over Weeks 1 to 12 of the treatment period, AM FEV1 at Week 12, ACQ-5 at Week 24, 
and incidence of exacerbations over the 24-week treatment period. Secondary safety endpoints 
common to both 5 to 11- and 5 to 17 years population included incidence of AEs, evaluation of fasting 
blood glucose pre- and post-treatment, evaluation of ECG at screening and end of treatment. Other 
endpoint common to both paediatric sub-populations was change from baseline, averaged over Weeks 
1 to 12 of the treatment period in PM PEF, captured daily via eDiary.To account for multiplicity across 
key endpoints, a step-down closed-testing procedure was applied whereby inference for a test in the 
pre-defined hierarchy was dependent upon statistical significance having been achieved for previous 
tests in the hierarchy. The submitted study methodology appears adequate for its primary objective. 
Proposed efficacy and safety endpoints appear to be relevant to develop a medicinal product for the 
treatment of asthma in paediatric subjects from 5 years of age and older. 
A total of 2402 participants were screened, of whom 1187/2402 (49%) participants failed screening 
and 309/2402 (13%) participants failed in the run-in period. Of all 906 participants randomised, a total 
of 902 participants were randomised and received study intervention (454 in the FF/VI group and 448 
in the FF group) with 673/906 (74%) participants included into the ITT population of the 5 to 11 years 
old (337 participants in the FF/VI group and 336 participants in the FF group). A total of 864/902 (96%)

participants completed the study. The number of screened and randomised subjects as well as the 
number of subjects per treatment arm, are in agreement with the planned sample size. 
The majority of the participants were between 8 and 11 years old (471/902; 52%) (mean [SD] age 
10.0 [2.99] years), male (546/902;61%), not Hispanic or Latino (651/902; 72%) with a mean BMI of 
18.55 (3.404) kg/m2. The demographic and baseline data with respect to age, race, ethnicity, medical 
conditions, asthma history, and lung function were comparable between both groups, with more male 
participants in the FF/VI group than in the FF group (289/454 [64%] versus 257/448 [57%], 
respectively).  
Regarding the primary endpoint (AM PEF) for 5 to 11 years population, the mean change from baseline 
over Weeks 1 to 12 was larger for the FF/VI treatment than for the FF treatment. The LS means 
change from baseline was 12.0 (Std Err: 1.86) L/min for the FF/VI treatment and 8.8 (Std Err 1.86) 
L/min for the FF treatment. For the primary comparison of AM PEF (L/min) over Weeks 1 to 12 on- and 
post-treatment, using ANCOVA with covariates of baseline, region, sex, age and treatment, the 
difference between treatment of 3.2 L/min did not reach statistical significance (p=0.228). Although a 
clinically significant improvement in weighted mean FEV1 (0 to 4 hours) was also seen in the 5 to 11 
years old population (representing 2 third of the 5 to 17 years old population) no statistical inference 
can be made on this endpoint because of the statistical testing hierarchy. Secondary endpoints such as 
symptom-free 24-hour periods, AM FEV1, ACQ-5, and PM PEF, were similar for both treatments. Any 
asthma exacerbation was reported for 27/337 (8%) participants in the FF/VI group and for 32/336 
(10%) participants of the FF group on- and post-treatment. 
As regards of the 5 to 17 years population safety results, 181/454 (40%) participants in the FF/VI 
group and 163/448 (36%) participants in the FF group experienced at least 1 AE. In 6/454 (1%) 
participants of the FF/VI group and 4/448 (<1%) participants of the FF group, the investigator 
considered the AEs to be drug-related. In 3/454 (<1%) participants of the FF/VI group and 1/448 
participant of the FF group, at least 1 AE led to permanent discontinuation from study intervention or 
to premature withdrawal from the study. In both groups, at least 1 SAE was reported for 5 (1%) 
participants in each group. No drug-related SAE, no fatal AE and no drug-related fatal AE were 
reported. The majority of the drug-related AEs occurring were reported at maximum for 1 participant 
per group, only dysphonia was reported for 2 (<1%) participants in the FF group and for 1 participant 
in the FF/VI group. 
For 5 to 11 years population, 133/337 (39%) participants in the FF/VI group and 122/336 (36%) 
participants in the FF group experienced at least 1 AE. In 4 (1%) participants of the FF/VI group and 4 
(1%) participants of the FF group, the investigator considered the AEs to be drug-related. In 2 (<1%) 
participants of the FF/VI group and 1 participant of the FF group, at least 1 AE led to permanent 
discontinuation from study intervention or to premature withdrawal from the study. In both groups, at 
least 1 SAE was reported for 4 (1%) participants in each group. No drug-related SAE, no fatal AE and 
no drug-related fatal AE were reported. A total of 4 (1%) participants in the FF/VI group and 4 (1%) 
participants in the FF group experienced at least 1 AE, which was considered by the investigator to be 
drug-related. The majority of the drug-related AEs occurring were reported at maximum for 1 
participant per group, only dysphonia was reported for 2 (<1%) participants in the FF group. 
Overall, the study failed to accomplish its primary objective as no significant difference between FF/VI 
and FF in the 5 to 11 years old population for AM PEF were demonstrated. However, FF/VI was well 
tolerated for both populations and no new safety concerns were identified during the study. 
In agreement with the MAH proposal, it is considered that a type II variation application consisting of 
the full relevant data package (i.e., containing several studies) should be submitted by March 2023.

3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
In accordance with Article 46 of the regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, Glaxo Group Ltd hereby submits to 
the EMA a final study report for study number HZA107116 which is part of the last PIP agreed to FF/VI 
(PIP EMEA-000431-PIP01-08-M12).  
HZA107116 was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, stratified, parallel group, multicentre study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of once daily fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (as trifenatate) inhalation 
powder (FF/VI) compared to once daily fluticasone furoate inhalation powder (FF) in the treatment of 
asthma in participants aged 5 to 17 years old (inclusive) currently uncontrolled on inhaled 
corticosteroids. Study randomisation was stratified by age as follows: participants from 5 to 11 years 
were randomly (1:1) allocated to receive FF/VI 50/25 micrograms or FF 50 micrograms whereas 
participants from 12 to 17 years were randomly (1:1) allocated to receive FF/VI 100/25 micrograms or 
FF 100 micrograms. 
Overall, the study failed to accomplish its primary objective as no significant difference between FF/VI 
and FF in the 5 to 11 years old population for AM PEF was demonstrated. Nevertheless, FF/VI safety 
profile observed in the study HZA107116 was consistent with the already known safety profile of 
FF/VVI in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with asthma. 
  Fulfilled: 
No further action required. The MAH has planned to submit a variation application for paediatric studies 
by March 2023.

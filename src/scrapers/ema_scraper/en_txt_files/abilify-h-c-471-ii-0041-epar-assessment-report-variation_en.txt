1. 
Introduction 
Acutely  agitated  patients  with  neuropsychiatric  illness  risk  harming  themselves  or  others. 
Psychomotor  agitation  is  defined  in  the  Diagnostics  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders, 
Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) as “excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension.”  
Patients experiencing agitation may manifest a range of disturbed behaviours that interfere with their 
diagnosis and care (e.g. threatening behaviours, escalating or urgently distressing behaviours, or self-
exhausting behaviour) requiring clinicians to use intramuscular antipsychotic medications to achieve 
immediate control of the agitation.  
Treating  patients  during  the  first few  hours  of  agitation  is  most  important  in  emergency  and  critical 
care situations. Because such patients may be unable or unwilling to take oral antipsychotic drugs, it 
may be necessary to use an alternative route of administration to treat them. 
Currently,  a  limited  choice  of  rapid  acting  intramuscular  (IM)  formulations  of  antipsychotics  is 
available for agitated patients with neuropsychiatric illness. 
In  this  type  II  variation,  the  MAH  applied  for  an  extension  of  indication  of  Abilify  7.5mg/ml  as 
follows (the new indication is underlined): 
‘Aripiprazole is indicated for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with 
schizophrenia  or  in  patients  with  manic  episodes  in  Bipolar  I  Disorder,  when  oral  therapy  is  not 
appropriate.’ 
2. 
Non Clinical aspects 
Environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
The MAH predicted that based on available forecasts the approval of this formulation and use will not 
significantly increase the use of aripiprazole in the EU.  
Overall,  given  the  latest  ERA  submitted  and  related  commitments  made  by  MAH  in  the  type  II 
variation  EMEA/H/C/471/II/39,  the  CHMP  considered  the  available  information  to  date,  to  be 
acceptable.

Clinical aspects 
3.1 Clinical efficacy 
The  development  program  completed  to  support  this  extension  of  indication  consisted  of  one 
randomised,  double-blind  study  (CN138013)  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  aripiprazole 
intramuscular (IM), lorazepam, or placebo in the treatment of acutely agitated patients diagnosed with 
Bipolar I Disorder, manic or mixed. 
Study CN180013 was conducted in accordance with GCP as stated by the MAH. 
METHODS 
Study design 
It is a randomised, double-blind, IM study comparing 2 fixed doses of aripiprazole (10 and 15 mg) and 
1 dose of lorazepam (2mg) with placebo over 24 hours in patients with bipolar  I disorder, manic or 
mixed and acute agitation with a PEC (positive and negative syndrome scale excited component): at 
least 2 components ≥4 and sum of 5 components ≥15 but ≤ 32.  
Primary and Secondary Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of IM aripiprazole versus placebo in the treatment 
of acutely agitated patients with a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder, manic or mixed. This was assessed 
by the mean change from baseline to 2 hours post first IM injection using the PEC scale. 
Secondary objectives were: 
- 
- 
- 
to compare the efficacy of IM aripiprazole versus placebo in the treatment of acute agitation in 
patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  Bipolar  I  Disorder,  manic  or  mixed,  as  assessed  by  the  Clinical 
Global Impressions Improvement Scale (CGI-I), Clinical Global Impressions Severity of Illness 
Scale (CGI-S), Agitation-Calmness Evaluation Scale (ACES), and Corrigan Agitated Behavior 
Scale (CABS). 
to compare the effects in this study of IM lorazepam, a known active therapy and standard of 
care in the treatment of acutely agitated patients with Bipolar I Disorder, manic or mixed, versus 
placebo. 
to determine the safety and tolerability of IM aripiprazole in the treatment of acutely agitated 
patients with Bipolar I Disorder, manic or mixed. This was assessed by the mean change from 
baseline  to  each  specified  observation  time  in  the  Simpson-Angus  Scale  (SAS)  and  Barnes 
Akathisia  Rating  Scale  (Barnes).  Safety  and  tolerance  was  evaluated  by  reports  of  adverse 
events (AEs) and clinically significant changes in electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and 
laboratory tests. 
Efficacy Endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  measure  was  mean  change  from  baseline  to  2  hours  post  first  IM  injection  in 
PEC Score. Efficacy rating scales completed during this study included PEC, ACES, CGI-I, CGI-S, 
CABS, PANSS, and Y-MRS.

Sample size 
The planned sample size of 260 evaluable patients (65 per treatment group) would yield 90% power to 
differentiate between placebo and at least 1 of the 2 aripiprazole treatment groups (10 mg or 15 mg), 
when  the  true  difference in  the  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  PEC  score  was  3.4.  This  assumed  a 
standard  deviation  of  5.4  and  a  2-sided  test  at  the  0.025  level  of  significance  (adjusted  for  2 
comparisons versus placebo to ensure an overall probability of type 1 error ≤ 0.05).

Three hundred twenty-nine (329) patients were enrolled in the study and 301 patients were randomised 
to  double-blind  treatment:  75  to  the  placebo  group,  70  to  the  lorazepam  group,  78  to  the  10-mg 
aripiprazole  group,  and  78  to  the  15-mg  aripiprazole  group.  Of  the  301  patients  randomised  to 
treatment, 291 were included in the safety and efficacy Samples. Two hundred eighty-two (94%) of 
the 301 randomised patients completed the study.

For  the  subgroup  of  non  sedated  patients  (defined  on  the  basis  of  the  ACES  Score),  statistically 
significant differences versus placebo in the primary efficacy measure were observed in favour of the 
10-mg and 15-mg aripiprazole groups, as well as for the lorazepam group.  
Secondary endpoints and other efficacy measures 
Aripiprazole  10-mg  and  15-mg  were  statistically  superior  to  placebo  on  all  secondary  efficacy 
measures at 2 hours post first IM injection (LOCF data set, see Table 5).  
Table 5

The  mean  CGI-I  Score,  and  the  mean  change from  baseline  in  the  CGI-S,  ACES,  and  CABS  Score 
showed  statistically  significant  comparisons  versus  placebo  in  favour  of  the  10-mg  and  15-mg 
aripiprazole  groups.  Furthermore,  statistically  significantly  higher  rates  of  PEC  response  were 
observed for 10-mg and 15-mg aripiprazole than for placebo. Lorazepam was statistically superior to 
placebo on these secondary outcome measures.  
Statistically significantly higher rates in terms of CGI response were observed for all active treatment 
groups  at  all  timepoints.  Patients  in  the  10-mg  and  15-mg  aripiprazole  groups  were  more  likely  to 
respond and/or to respond sooner in terms of PEC response than patients in the placebo group during 
the 2-hour period post first IM injection.  
Furthermore, patients in the placebo group were more likely to require and/or require sooner a second 
or  third  injection  than  patients  in  the  10-mg  and  15-mg  aripiprazole  groups,  as  well  as  in  the 
lorazepam group (see Table 6). 
Table 6: Number and Percentage of Patients Who Received Study Medication by Number of 
Injections: IM Placebo-Controlled Study CN138013, Efficacy Sample 
Aripiprazole  10-mg  and  15-mg,  as  well  as  lorazepam,  were  statistically  superior  to  placebo  for  the 
mean change in the PEC Score from predose (ie, immediately prior to second IM injection) to 2 hours 
post second IM injection.  
For the subgroup of patients who were non responders to the first IM injection (defined as a patient 
who received a second injection within 4 hours of the first and who was not a PEC responder in the 
evaluation just prior to the second injection), statistically significant differences versus placebo were 
observed  in  the  mean  change  from  predose  in  favour  of  the  10-mg  and  15-mg  aripiprazole  and 
lorazepam  groups.  In  addition,  aripiprazole  10-mg  and  lorazepam  also  showed  superiority  over 
placebo at the 60 minute time point. Following the third IM injection, 10-mg aripiprazole appeared to 
be similar in effect as lorazepam for the mean change in the PEC Score from baseline (ie, immediately 
prior to first IM injection). 
DISCUSSION ON CLINICAL EFFICACY 
The  repeated  measures  analysis  on  the  PEC  Score  through  2  hours  post  first  IM  injection  showed 
improvement  over  time  for  all  treatment  groups.  The  improvement  was  statistically  significantly 
greater for the 10-mg and 15-mg aripiprazole and lorazepam groups than placebo. 
The PEC score has not been formally validated in bipolar patients with acute mania. However, results 
from  all  secondary  efficacy  measures  are  reassuring  and  support  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  for 
study CN138013. 
Overall, the CHMP recommended to reflect the results of this study in section 5.1 of the SPC. ‘In one 
short-term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trial involving 291 patients with bipolar disorder presenting 
7
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with  agitation  and  disturbed  behaviours,  aripiprazole  solution  for  injection  was  associated  with 
statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/behavioural symptoms compared to placebo 
and was similar to the reference arm lorazepam. The observed mean improvement from baseline on 
the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for 
lorazepam, and 8.7 for aripiprazole. In subpopulation analyses on patients with mixed episodes or on 
patients with severe agitation, a similar pattern of efficacy to the overall population was observed but 
statistical significance could not be established due to a reduced sample size.’ 
Furthermore, inclusion of the approved information for oral aripiprazole related to this indication has 
been made into section 5.1 of the SPC. 
3.2 Clinical safety 
Patient Exposure 
The  safety  sample  comprised  1214  patients:  795  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  schizophrenia, 
schizoaffective, or schizophreniform disorder (CN138012, CN138050), 291 patients with a diagnosis 
of  bipolar  I  disorder,  manic  or  mixed  (CN138013),  and  128  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  dementia 
(additional  safety  study  CN138131  conducted  in  elderly  patients  and  provided  by  the  applicant).  
A total of 660 patients received aripiprazole as initial treatment, 240 patients received haloperidol, 69 
patients  received  lorazepam,  and  245  patients  received  placebo.  In  addition,  62  placebo-treated 
patients received 10-mg aripiprazole as a third injection and 27 placebo-treated patients received 15-
mg aripiprazole as a third injection. Therefore, from the 4 IM placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 studies a 
total of 749 patients received IM aripiprazole. This safety sample was already evaluated by CHMP at 
the  time  of  the  opinion  for  the  extension  of  the  marketing  authorisation  to  IM  aripiprazole 
(EMEA/H/C/471/II/15 and X/16). 
Adverse events 
Aside from those events that are associated with the method of administration (e.g. injection site pain), 
the  profile  of  AEs  reported  with  IM  aripiprazole  was  generally  similar  to  those  observed  with  oral-
tablet aripiprazole (Table 7).

Deaths and other serious adverse events 
There were 2 reports of death in patients who received study medication in the IM Phase 2/3 clinical 
program. These were not considered related to study treatment. 
There  were  no  SAEs  reported  in  Studies  CN138016  and  CN138017.  One  SAE  was  reported  in  the 
Study CN138132: a 40-year old black female, experienced Grade 3 neutropenia that began on Day 27 
after aripiprazole 15-mg treatment and lasted for 91 days. 
Thirty-two  of  the  1214  patients  in  the  IM  safety  Sample  (CN138012,  CN138050,  CN138013, 
CN138131) experienced  SAEs.  One  SAE  for  a  patient  in  the  placebo  group  occurred  after the third 
injection, which was 15-mg aripiprazole. Most events were related to patients’ underlying psychiatric 
diseases,  and  only  one  report  event  of  dystonia  with  6.5  mg  haloperidol  was  considered  by  the 
investigators to be related to study medication. 
Other safety findings 
In the pooled schizophrenia studies (CN138012, CN138050), a higher incidence of increased fasting 
serum glucose in aripiprazole- and haloperidol-treated patients than placebo-treated patients following 
injection with study medication was reported.  
When  QT  intervals  were  evaluated  uncorrected  and  using  other  correction  methods  (QTcB,  QTcN, 
and QTcF), there were no clinically meaningful differences across treatment groups.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Eight of the 1214 patients discontinued from the studies because of an AE during the IM phase. Five 
aripiprazole-treated  patients  discontinued  and  only  1  of  these  patients  (10-mg)  discontinued  due  to 
possible drug related events (agitation and musculoskeletal stiffness). None of the 89 placebo-treated 
patients  who  received  a  third  IM  injection,  which  was  either  10-mg  or  15-mg  aripiprazole, 
discontinued from the studies because of an AE. 
DISCUSSION ON CLINICAL SAFETY 
The  safety  profile  of  aripiprazole  using  the  IM  formulation  was  similar  to  that  of  the  oral-tablet 
formulation. Based on data collected to date the IM formulation appears favourable. There was only a 
small  number  of  SAEs,  and  very  few  AEs  led  to  discontinuation.  There  were  no  important  clinical 
concerns regarding laboratory, vital sign, or ECG findings. Section 4.8 of the SPC has been updated to 
reflect the safety information, already approved for oral aripiprazole at the time of the type II variation 
EMEA/H/C/471/II/39. 
4.   Risk Management Plan 
Reference  is  made  to  the  Risk  Management  Plan  version  3.0  submitted  in  the  type  II  variation 
EMEA/H/C/471/II/39, which was considered acceptable by CHMP. 
5.   Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  benefit-risk  for 
Abilify 7.5 mg/ml solution for injection in the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in 
patients with manic episodes in Bipolar I disorder, when oral therapy is not appropriate, is favourable 
and recommended the variation to the marketing authorisation.

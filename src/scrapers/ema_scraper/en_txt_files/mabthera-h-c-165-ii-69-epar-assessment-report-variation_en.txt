1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1 Introduction 
Follicular lymphoma is generally a slow-growing form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) involving 
mature B lymphocytes, accounting for 11%–22% of all lymphoid malignancies and around 70% of 
indolent lymphomas. In Europe, there are around 74 800 new cases of NHL (all types) each year, 
including around 16 500 new cases of follicular lymphoma. The incidence of follicular lymphoma 
increases with age and it very rarely occurs in children. Most patients are over 50 years old, and the 
median age at diagnosis is 60 years. Men and women are about equally affected. Most patients 
(> 80%) with follicular lymphoma have widespread disease at diagnosis (Ann Arbor stage III/IV), 
including involvement of peripheral and central (abdominal and thoracic) lymph nodes and spleen.  The 
bone marrow is involved in 50%-60% of patients.  The disease is heterogeneous, and a number of 
prognostic factors have been identified, some of which are included in the widely used Follicular 
Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI). 
Follicular lymphoma generally follows an indolent course, although the majority of patients die of 
lymphoma after a series of relapses and remissions of decreasing duration. Although follicular 
lymphoma is usually very responsive to initial chemotherapy, the disease typically becomes 
increasingly resistant to cytotoxic agents. Around 30% of follicular lymphomas may eventually 
transform to intermediate or high-grade lymphomas, which are clinically more aggressive and have a 
poor outcome. Patients are also at risk of developing therapy related secondary malignancies, such as 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The risk increases with time and 
depends on the number, intensity, and type of previous cytotoxic treatments. Overall, the 2-year 
survival rate of patients with follicular lymphoma is about 90%. Median survival has improved in recent 
years from around 6–10 years at the end of the 1990s to >10 years and as high as 18 years in one 
recent series. 
Treatment options for patients with follicular lymphoma include ‘’watch and wait’’, radiotherapy, and 
systemic treatments.  Radiotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients with stage I/II disease, 
and in a subset of these patients this may sometimes be curative. Since the natural course of the 
disease is heterogeneous and spontaneous regressions may occur, initiation of chemotherapy is only 
recommended for patients with symptoms, haematopoietic impairment, bulky disease, or rapid 
lymphoma progression. 
Chemotherapy and immunotherapy (with interferon-alpha [IFN-] or rituximab) have both been 
evaluated as maintenance therapy in patients with follicular lymphoma.  Rituximab is licensed in the 
EU as maintenance therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma responding to 
induction with chemotherapy, with or without rituximab.   
MabThera (rituximab) is a chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody that binds to CD20, a 
hydrophobic transmembrane protein which is present on the cell surface of pre-B- and mature B-
lymphocytes, but not on hematopoietic stem cells, pro–B–cells, normal plasma cells or other normal 
tissues. Importantly, CD20 is present on the malignant B-cells in most patients with mature B-cell 
lymphomas and leukemias.  Rituximab binds to CD20 on these cells and leads to their elimination via a 
number of different mechanisms, including antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), 
complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and apoptosis. 
Rituximab is administered by intravenous infusion. 
Rituximab is currently approved in the EU for the following indications: 
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III–IV 
follicular lymphoma; 
as maintenance therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma responding to 
induction therapy with chemotherapy with or without rituximab; 
for the treatment of patients with stage III–IV follicular lymphoma who are chemo resistant or are in 
their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy; 
for the treatment of patients with CD20-positive diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 
combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) chemotherapy. 
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with previously untreated and 
relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.  Only limited data are available on efficacy and 
CHMP variation assessment report

safety for patients previously treated with monoclonal antibodies including rituximab or patients 
refractory to previous rituximab plus chemotherapy (further information is provided in section 5.1 of 
the EU SmPC). 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of adult patients with severe active rheumatoid 
arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to other disease-modifying anti-
rheumatic drugs including one or more tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapies. 
This variation concerns an application for extension of the approved indications to include use of 
Mabthera as maintenance therapy in follicular lymphoma patients responding to induction therapy. 
1.2 Clinical aspects 
GCP 
The MAH states that the PRIMA study was conducted in full conformance with the principles of the 
“Declaration of Helsinki” and with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research was 
conducted, whichever afforded the greater protection to the patient. The study adhered fully to the 
principles outlined in the “Guideline for Good Clinical Practice” ICH Tripartite Guideline (January 1997) 
or with the local law, if it afforded greater protection to the patient. 
Clinical efficacy 
Main study 
PRIMA study 
The PRIMA study was a randomised (1:1), multicentre/multinational, open-label, comparative, parallel 
group, two-arm study comparing rituximab maintenance with observation, in patients with previously 
untreated follicular lymphoma who responded to induction therapy with a rituximab-based 
chemoimmunotherapy regimen [R-CHOP (rituximab- cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and 
prednisone,  R-CVP (rituximab-cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone) or R-FCM (rituximab-
fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and mitoxantrone)]. 
METHODS 
Study Participants  
To be eligible for the study, patients had to have histologically-confirmed grade 1, 2 or 3a follicular 
lymphoma according to National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI-WG) criteria, and high tumour 
burden according to Groupe d’Etude des Lymphomes Folliculaire (GELF) criteria, indicating a need to 
initiate treatment. Patients with high grade (3b) or transformed lymphomas or with central nervous 
system (CNS) involvement were not eligible. 
Inclusion criteria, induction phase 
• Histologically confirmed follicular lymphoma grade 1, 2, or 3a, with a lymph node biopsy performed 
within four months before study entry and with material available for central review.

trial if a recent biopsy [obtained within the last four months] was available). 
• Patients with at least one of the following high-tumour-burden GELF criteria requiring initiation of 
treatment: 
– bulky disease defined as a nodal or extranodal (except spleen) mass > 7 cm in its greater diameter

Inclusion criteria, maintenance/observation phase 
To enter the maintenance/observation phase, patients had to meet the following criteria: 
• Patients must have achieved a partial response (PR) or complete response/unconfirmed complete 
response (CR/CRu) at the end of induction treatment. 
• All indicator lesions reported on the on-study form must have been re-evaluated. 
Exclusion criteria, induction phase 
Patients that met any of the following criteria were excluded from study entry: 
• Transformation to high-grade lymphoma (secondary to ‘low-grade’ follicular lymphoma). 
• Grade 3b follicular lymphoma. 
• Presence or history of CNS disease (either CNS lymphoma or lymphomatous meningitis). 
• Patients regularly taking corticosteroids during the four weeks prior to study entry, unless 
administered at a dose equivalent to ≤ 20 mg/day prednisone over that time.

× Upper Limit Normal (ULN), unless these abnormalities were related to lymphoma. 
• Known HIV infection or active hepatitis B or C infection within 28 days prior to registration. Testing 
for hepatitis B was not mandatory but recommended for all patients considered at high risk of infection 
and in endemic areas. Patients with any serological evidence of current or past hepatitis B exposure 
were excluded unless the findings were clearly due to vaccination. 
• Serious underlying medical conditions that could impair the patient’s ability to participate in the trial 
(eg, ongoing infection, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, gastric ulcers, or active autoimmune disease). 
• Life expectancy of less than six months. 
• Known sensitivity or allergy to murine products. 
• Treatment within a clinical trial within 30 days prior to study entry. 
• Any other co-existing medical or psychological condition that would preclude the patient’s 
participation in the study or compromise their ability to give informed consent. 
• Adult patients under tutelage (not competent to sign the informed consent form). 
Exclusion criteria, maintenance/observation phase 
Patients were excluded from the maintenance/observation phase of the study if they met any of the 
following criteria: 
• Patients who had serious underlying medical conditions that could impair their ability to participate in 
the trial (eg, ongoing infection, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, gastric ulcers, or active autoimmune 
disease). 
•  Patients  who  could  not  complete  all  cycles  of  induction  treatment  due  to  toxicity  or  had  not 
completed at least four cycles of R-CHOP + 2R, six cycles of R-CVP, or four cycles of R-FCM induction 
treatment. 
•  Patients  who  had  a  delay  in  treatment  of  more  than  14  days  following  any  cycle  of  induction 
chemotherapy. 
Treatments 
The study had two treatment phases: 
Induction phase: 
During the (non-randomised) induction phase, patients with advanced follicular lymphoma were 
evaluated for response to one of three possible induction regimens, R-CHOP, R-CVP, or R-FCM. Most 
patients (75%) received R-CHOP induction therapy. As the three induction regimens differed in the 
number of immunochemotherapy cycles usually administered for patients with follicular lymphoma (8 
cycles of R-CVP, 6 cycles of R-CHOP, and 6 cycles of R-FCM), two additional infusions of rituximab (375 
mg/m2) were added to the standard R-CHOP and R-FCM regimens for the PRIMA study. As a result, 
each patient in the induction phase would receive the same number of rituximab infusions (eight) prior 
to randomisation in the maintenance/observation phase, and the scheduled treatment phase would be 
24 weeks for all three regimens. 
Maintenance/observation phase: 
Patients who responded to induction treatment with a CR/CRu or PR were randomised to receive either 
rituximab maintenance therapy (one dose of 375 mg/m2 every eight weeks for two years, i.e., a total 
of 12 doses) or observation (no further treatment, one visit every 8 weeks, a total of 12 visits).  All 
randomised patients were to be treated/observed for two years and then followed up for five years.   
The trial design is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Trial design 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the PRIMA study was to evaluate the benefit of maintenance therapy with 
rituximab on progression-free survival (PFS) compared to no maintenance therapy (observation) after 
induction of response with chemotherapy plus rituximab in patients with high tumour-burden follicular 
lymphoma. 
The secondary objectives were as follows: 
To evaluate event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), time to next anti-lymphoma treatment 
(TTNLT), time to next chemotherapy treatment (TTNCT), response rates at the end of maintenance 
treatment, transformation rate at first relapse, and quality of life (QoL) for three different 
chemotherapy regimens combined with rituximab, with or without maintenance rituximab, for first line 
treatment of high tumour burden follicular lymphoma. 
To assess safety of rituximab maintenance therapy over 2 years as measured by the incidence of 
toxicity. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was PFS, defined as the time from randomisation to first documented disease 
progression, relapse, or death from any cause as evaluated by the investigator and by an Independent 
Review Committee (IRC).   
Secondary endpoints were EFS (the time from randomisation to first documented progression, relapse, 
initiation of a new anti-lymphoma treatment or death from any cause), OS (the time from 
randomisation to death, regardless of cause), TTNLT [time from randomisation to first documented 
administration of any new anti-lymphoma treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, radio 
immunotherapy, immunotherapy)], TTNCT (time from randomisation to first documented 
administration of new chemotherapy or new cytotoxic agent), response rates at the end of 
maintenance treatment, transformation rate at first relapse, QoL and overall safety. 
Sample size 
The primary endpoint of PFS was used to determine the final sample size of the study. To demonstrate 
a 45% increase in median PFS from the time of randomisation (six months after the start of induction 
therapy), for  example, from 37.2 months to 54 months, 900 patients were required to be randomised 
in the maintenance/observation period. With an estimated response rate to induction 
immunochemotherapy of 75%, 1200 patients would need to be recruited in the induction period to 
ensure that 900 patients entered the maintenance/observation phase. 
The sample size calculation was based on the following assumptions: 
• Overall alpha = 5% 
• Power = 80% 
• 1:1 randomisation between the treatment arms 
• A monthly hazard rate of 0.0186 in the observation group corresponding to a median PFS of 37.2 
months 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 5/48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
• A monthly hazard rate of 0.0186 within the first six months after randomisation (to mimic a possible 
lag in treatment effect) and 0.0121 thereafter for the maintenance arm (corresponding to a median 
PFS of 54 months) 
• 900 patients would be randomised within 24 months (23 patients per month within the first 16 
months, and 53 patients thereafter) 
• One interim analysis would be performed after 75% of the total number of required PFS events. The 
alpha-spending function using the O’Brien–Fleming boundary was applied to maintain the overall two-
sided Type I error of 0.05. 
Randomisation 
Patients who achieved a CR/CRu or PR after induction treatment and also fulfilled all other eligibility 
criteria were randomised in the maintenance/observation phase of the study. A stratified block 
randomisation procedure (block size: four) was used. Randomisation was stratified by induction 
regimen (R-CHOP, R-CVP, R-FCM), by response (CR/CRu, PR), by region GELA sites, Europe non-GELA, 
South America, Asia, Australia/New Zealand), and by centre (in countries other than France and 
Belgium, the country was considered as a single centre). Patients were allocated in a ratio of 1:1 to 
receive rituximab maintenance or no treatment (observation).  
Blinding 
The pivotal study was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Four analysis populations were defined:  
-  Induction analysis population (IAP): all patients who received at least one component of the planned 
induction treatment regimen (R-CVP, R-CHOP, R-FCM).  
- Maintenance intent-to-treat population (MITT): all randomised patients regardless of whether they 
received study treatment or not were included in this analysis population according to the maintenance 
therapy that they were randomised to receive. 
- Maintenance per protocol population (PPP): all randomised patients who received at least six courses 
of maintenance treatment or completed at least six observation visits or who terminated 
treatment/observation because of progression or death and adhered to the protocol. 
- Maintenance safety population (MSAP): all patients who received at least one dose of maintenance 
trial treatment/attended at least one observation visit and had at least one safety follow-up, whether 
withdrawn prematurely or not. 
The statistical analysis for the primary and secondary endpoints are summarised in table 1:

RESULTS 
Participant flow 
The patient disposition in the induction and in the maintenance phase is presented in Figures 2 and 3 
respectively. 
Figure 2.  Patient disposition in the induction phase 
Of the 1202 patients registered, 1193 received a first course of induction treatment and are included in 
the induction analysis population (IAP). Nine patients withdrew from the study after registration but 
prior to receiving treatment and were excluded from the IAP. Of the 1193 patients treated, 1114

patients completed all eight cycles of induction treatment (ie, 6 R-CHOP + 2R, 8 R-CVP, or 6 R-FCM + 
2R), with each additional rituximab injection for the R-CHOP and R-FCM regimens considered as a 
cycle. The proportion of patients completing eight cycles was over 95% in the R-CHOP group, about 
90% in the R-CVP group, and 75% in the R-FCM group. 
Figure 3.  Patient disposition in the maintenance phase 
A total of 1019 patients at 208 centres were randomised in the maintenance/observation phase of the 
PRIMA study: 506 patients were randomised to receive rituximab maintenance therapy, and 513 
patients were randomised to the observation arm. The first patient was randomised on 5 July 2005, 
and the last patient was randomised on 22 November 2007. 
Recruitment 
A total of 1217 patients were enrolled in the PRIMA trial over a period of 29 months: the first patient 
was registered on 24 December 2004 and the last patient was registered on 11 April 2007. Three 
participating sites in Mexico were closed prematurely because of compliance issues and it was agreed 
by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) that data for the 15 patients registered at those 
sites should be excluded from the main statistical analyses.  
A total of 1202 patients were enrolled in the PRIMA trial from 220 centres in 24 countries, excluding 
the Mexican sites. France was the major recruiting country, enrolling over 50% of patients in the study.

Conduct of the study 
Five amendments were made to the PRIMA study protocol. Key features of these amendments are 
described below: 
• Amendment 1 (Protocol Version 3.1), dated 24 August 2005: This amendment applied to patients 
enrolled at French study sites only. It scheduled monitoring of serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and 
IgM) as well as levels of circulating B-cells (CD19-positive), T-cells (CD3-positive), and natural killer 
cells (CD16- or CD56-positive) every six months for three years after randomisation or until recovery 
to baseline if not reached by this time. Measurement of anti-tetanus toxoid antibodies was also 
scheduled at baseline, at the end of the induction phase, and at the end of the 
maintenance/observation phase. 
• Amendment 2 (Protocol Version 3.2), dated 14 February 2006: This amendment increased the target 
enrolment from 640 patients (with 480 to be randomised in the maintenance/observation phase) to 
900 patients (with 675 to be randomised in the maintenance/observation phase) to allow for more 
informative subgroup analyses within each induction immunochemotherapy group. 
• Amendment 3 (Protocol Version 4.0), dated 16 August 2006: This amendment modified the primary 
endpoint of the study from EFS to PFS and increased the total number of study patients from 900 to 
1200. The number of PFS events required for the final analysis was also modified, partly to account for 
a possible six-month lag inrituximab treatment benefit following randomisation. In line with these 
changes, the number of PFS events that would trigger interim efficacy analyses was also increased 
(from 100 and 150 events for the first and second interim analyses, respectively, to 172 and 258 
events). The amendment also removed rituximab plus mitoxantrone, chlorambucil, and prednisone as 
a potential induction immunochemotherapy regimen (no patients had been treated with this induction 
regimen at the time), stipulated the minimum induction treatment required for randomisation, 
increased the duration of follow-up after completion of the maintenance/observation phase from three 
to five years, and introduced an independent, blinded review of lymphoma response and progression. 
• Amendment 4 (Protocol Version 5.0), dated 22 February 2008: This amendment removed the first 
preplanned analysis which was scheduled to take place after 50% of events. This change was made 
following a recommendation by the DSMC who pointed out that at the expected time of the first 
interim analysis there would be limited follow-up of patients and a large proportion of patients would 
still be on active treatment. Therefore, regardless of the results of that first interim analysis, a 
recommendation to stop the study early would be highly unlikely since the results would be considered 
immature and would require confirmation with longer follow-up. Accordingly, the protocol was 
amended to include only one interim analysis after 75% of events occurred. The guidelines for 
completing and reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) were clarified to make it explicit that SAEs on 
both maintenance and observation arms were reportable. Prior to this amendment, SAE reporting in 
the observation arm was not clearly specified in the protocol. However, investigators and monitors 
were instructed to treat both arms equally with respect to the reporting of SAEs and the case report 
form gave the same instructions for both arms. The oversight in the protocol wording was corrected as 
part of this amendment. 
• Amendment 5 (Protocol Version 5.1), dated 4 December 2008: (administrative change only).

Numbers analysed 
The primary population for the efficacy analyses was the MITT population comprising all patients who 
completed the randomisation process. The MITT population comprised 1018 patients: 513 patients in 
the observation arm and 505 patients in the rituximab arm. Based on all patients randomised, 5 
patients in each arm were excluded from the MSAP as they did not receive study drug or did not attend 
an observation visit, respectively, after randomisation. 
A total of 844 patients were included in the PPP. A higher proportion of patients in the observation arm 
(103 patients, 20%) than in the rituximab arm (72 patients, 14%) were excluded from the PPP. The 
main reason for this difference was inadequate maintenance treatment/observation visits (47 patients 
in the observation arm vs 11 patients in the rituximab arm).

* p-values and hazard ratios were calculated using the stratified log-rank test and stratified Cox regression for time-
to-event  endpoints,  respectively.  Stratification  factors were  induction treatment  received  and response to  induction 
treatment.  p-values  for  response  rate  were  calculated  using  the  2  test,  and  odds  ratios  were  calculated  by  using 
logistic regression (response rate analyses were unadjusted). 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Progression Free Survival (PFS) 
At the time of the analysis (clinical cut-off date 14 January 2009), the median duration of follow-up 
was 25 months. At the time of the analysis, 174/513 patients in the observation arm and 93/505 
patients in the rituximab arm (33.9% vs 18.4%) had experienced a progression event (i.e., disease 
progression/relapse or death) since randomisation (Table 6). Maintenance therapy with rituximab in 
patients responding to induction therapy reduced the risk of experiencing a progression event by 50% 
compared with no further treatment (stratified HR 0.50, 95% CI [0.39;0.64], p < 0.0001). The 
Kaplan-Meier estimated median PFS times could not be calculated for either arm, however, the 25th 
percentile times were calculated as 507 days (16.7 months) for patients on observation and 1096 days 
(36 months) for patients on rituximab maintenance (p < 0.0001, log-rank test).

Supportive study 
ECOG 1496 trial 
The ECOG 1496 study was a phase III, randomised, controlled, multicentre, intergroup study of the 
efficacy and safety of rituximab as post-induction therapy compared with observation. 
METHODS 
To be eligible for the study, patients had to have International Working Formulation (IWF) Grades A 
through C lymphoma (i.e., patients with marginal zone, lymphoplasmacytoid and small lymphocytic 
lymphoma were eligible, as well as patients with follicular lymphoma). 
The main criteria for inclusion were previously untreated patients ≥18 years of age with Stage III or IV 
low-grade (IWF Grades A through C), CD20, B-cell lymphomas. An ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 
was required. 
The original protocol was designed to compare cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (CF) and CVP as 
induction regimens, but as a result of increased early mortality in the CF induction arm, the study was 
amended so that all further patients received CVP induction (cyclophosphamide 1 g/m2 on day 1, 
vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 on day 1 and prednisone 100 mg/m2 on days 1-5). 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 18/48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
Patients who achieved a CR, PR, or SD following induction therapy (Stage 1) were randomised to 
rituximab maintenance (375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks, repeated at 6-month intervals for a total of 
four cycles [16 doses total]) or observation. 
A total of 401 patients received CVP induction therapy (119 randomised to the CVP arm, and 282 
assigned to CVP following the protocol amendment), of whom 322 showed a response or stable disease 
and were randomised to receive rituximab maintenance (n=162) or observation (n=160) in Stage 2 of 
the study.  The maintenance randomisation was stratified by extent of residual disease post-induction 
(minimal or gross) and histology (follicular or other). A total of 305 patients (157 in the rituximab arm 
and 148 in the observation arm) were assessable for efficacy.  Of these, 248 patients were considered 
to have follicular lymphoma, including 125 in the rituximab maintenance arm and 123 in the 
observation arm. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was duration of PFS, defined as the time from maintenance 
randomisation (Stage 2) to the first occurrence of disease progression, relapse, or death from any 
cause. Secondary efficacy endpoints included duration of OS (from maintenance randomisation) and 
response improvement within 2 years of maintenance randomisation. 
RESULTS 
Participant flow 
A total of 401 patients received CVP induction therapy (119 randomised to the CVP arm, and 282 
assigned to CVP following the protocol amendment).  The overall response rate to induction therapy 
was 73% (13% CR; 60% PR) and 19% had SD; data based on induction population N=387 taken from 
Hochster et al, 2009 (Hochster H. et al (2009), JCO 27:1607-1614). In total, 322 of 401 patients 
showed a response or SD and were randomised to receive rituximab maintenance (n=162) or 
observation (n=160).  These patients comprised the primary analysis population (PAP).  Two hundred 
and forty eight (248) patients were considered to have follicular lymphoma, including 125 in the 
rituximab maintenance arm and 123 in the observation arm.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Progression Free Survival (PFS) 
At  the  time  of  data  transfer  (November  8,  2004)  based  on  a  median  follow  up  of  27  months,  133 
patients had experienced a PFS event, 46 in the rituximab maintenance arm and 87 in the observation 
arm. Based on the stratified analysis, the hazard ratio of progression, relapse, or death for patients in 
the  rituximab  maintenance  arm  relative  to  those  in  the  observation  arm  was  0.36  (95%  CI:  0.25, 
0.52).  
In  the  subset  of  patients  with  follicular  lymphoma,  in  the  observation  arm,  68/123  patients  (55.3%) 
were considered to have a progression event compared to 34/125 patients (27.2%) in the rituximab.  
The  hazard  ratio  of  progression,  relapse,  or  death  for  patients  in  the  rituximab  maintenance  arm 
relative to those in the observation arm was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.56) (Table 12).

Updated analysis 
An updated efficacy analysis has been performed for the ECOG 1496 study, based on a median follow-
up of 67 months for the observation arm and 71 months for the rituximab maintenance arm. As of the 
clinical cut-off date of 31 May, 2008, a total of 282 patients had been followed for over 3 years (136 in 
the  observation  arm  and  146  in  the  rituximab  maintenance  arm).    Of  these,  212 patients  had 
experienced  a  PFS  event  (124 patients  in  the  observation  arm  and  88  patients  in  the  rituximab 
maintenance  arm).    Median  PFS  was  15  months  in  the  observation  arm  versus  55  months  in 
the rituximab  maintenance  arm.    After  this  extended  follow-up  period,  maintenance  therapy  with 
rituximab reduced the risk of progression by 56% compared with no further treatment (HR 0.436, 95% 
CI  [0.330, 0.576]).  For  the  subset  of  patients  with  follicular  lymphoma  after  3  years  follow-up  the 
results  were  as  follows:  median  PFS  4.3  years  in  the  rituximab  maintenance  arm  compared  with  1.3 
years for observation patients (HR 0.4, 95% CI [0.3, 0.6]).  
At  the  clinical  cut-off  for  the  final  analysis  of  the  ECOG 1496  study,  46  patients  (29%)  in  the 
observation arm and 37 patients (23%) in the rituximab maintenance arm had died.  The median OS 
time  had  not  been  reached  and  no  statistically  significant  difference  in  OS  was  observed.  The  hazard 
ratio  for  OS  for  the  maintenance  rituximab  arm  relative  to  the  observation  arm  was  0.773  (95%  CI 
[0.501, 1.193], p = 0.19). The 3-year OS for the subset of patients with follicular lymphoma was 91% 
for rituximab maintenance versus 86% for observation (HR 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.2; p = 0.08).  
Response Improvements during the rituximab maintenance/observation phase 
Of  the  263 patients  who  had  SD  or  PR  as  their  best  response  to  induction,  129 patients  were 
randomised  to  the  observation  arm  and  134 patients  were  randomised  to  the  rituximab  maintenance 
arm.    The  percentage  of  patients  with  SD  or  PR  after  induction  whose  response  improved  within 
2 years  following  randomisation  to  rituximab  maintenance  or  observation  was  20.9%  and  7.0%, 
respectively.    The  difference  between  the  arms  of  13.9%  was  statistically  significant  (95%  CI: 
[5.6%, 22.6%]; p  0.001) (Table 14).

  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
After  a  median  follow  up-time  of  25  months  the  results  from  the  pivotal  study  showed  that  the  25th 
percentile PFS for patients on observation was 16.7 months and for patients on rituximab maintenance 
it was 36 months, with a Hazard Ratio of 0.5 (CI 0.39; 0.64).  
The  increase  of  PFS  was  seen  in  the  total  group  as  well  as  in  the  sub-group  of  patients  treated  with 
induction R-CHOP. In the sub-groups treated with induction R-CVP or R-FCM a trend for PFS increase 
was observed, however the difference was not statistically significant. This could possibly be explained 
by  the  low  percentage  of  patients  receiving  these  induction  therapies  and  experiencing  an  event, 
resulting in wide CI.  
There  is  no  head-to-head  comparison  of  the  efficacy  of  R-CVP  vs.  R-CHOP  in  patients  with  follicular 
lymphoma  .  In  a  meta-analysis  concerning  this  issue,  it  was  concluded  that  both  R-CHOP  and  R-CVP 
can achieve excellent overall responses, by which the response rates for R-CHOP were slightly higher.  
The PFS of follicular lymphoma patients who were treated with R-CHOP as induction therapy, proved to 
be significantly increased after rituximab maintenance in comparison to observation (no maintenance). 
There  is  no  rationale  to  assume  a  different  effect  of  rituximab  maintenance  treatment  after  various 
induction regimes (R-CVP or R-CHOP).  
The  results  of  the  secondary  endpoints,  EFS,  Time  to  next  anti-lymphoma  treatment,  time  to  next 
chemotherapy treatment, response rate at end of maintenance/observation phase, were consistent and 
in  line  with  the  increase  in  PFS  and  suggest  a  benefit  for  rituximab  maintenance  treatment  at  first 
remission. 
However the improvement of PFS didn’t translate into a significant increase in OS, (HR of 0.89 with a 
CI 0.42; 1.74). The lack of a significant improvement of OS could be explained by the low number of 
deaths recorded (18 deaths in the observation arm and 16 deaths in the rituximab maintenance arm) 
at the time of analysis (after a median follow up time of 25 months), resulting in a wide CI. Another 
explanation  could  be  that  the  results  are  diluted  by  the  efficacy  of  any  next  line  (possibly  rituximab-
containing) therapy at progression.  
After  updated  analysis,  based  on  a  later  clinical  cut-off  (June  30,  2009),  no  statistical  significant  OS 
benefit could be determined either, as too few additional events had occurred. 
Patients  will  be  followed  until  5  years  after  completion  of  the  2-year  maintenance/observation  period 
for  PFS  and  OS.  The  OS  data  to  be  obtained  after  completion  of  the  follow-up  period  must  be 
considered  important  to  assess  the  safety  of  rituximab  maintenance  after  first  remission  induction. 
Results must be submitted as a FUM.  
The  result  from  the  supportive  study  concerning  the  increase  in  PFS  in  response  to  rituximab 
maintenance is in agreement with the results obtained in the pivotal study. Concerning PFS benefit, a 
HR  of  0.37  in  favour  of  rituximab  maintenance  therapy  was  reported.      In  the  supportive  study, 
rituximab  maintenance  seems  to  be  even  more  beneficial,  however  the  effect  can  be  exaggerated  by 
the fact that none of the patients were treated with rituximab during the induction phase and therefore 
the patients in the observational arm never had the benefit of any rituximab treatment during this trial. 
Like  in  the  pivotal  study,  the  OS  is  not  significantly  increased  after  rituximab  maintenance  at  first 
remission when compared with OS in the observation arm.  
Nevertheless,  the  percentage  of  patients  (including  patients  with  follicular  lymphoma  or  other 
lymphoma) who improved from SD/PR to PR/CR two years after randomisation was significantly higher 
in the rituximab maintenance arm vs. observation (20.9% vs. 7.0%). In the setting of the supportive 
study, this observation further attests to the clinical benefit of rituximab maintenance therapy.

 
Induction Phase 
Of the 1018 patients who entered the randomised maintenance/observation phase of the study, all but 
three  had  completed  their  induction  therapy  according  to  the  protocol.    One  patient  in  each  of  the 
rituximab  maintenance  and  observation  arms  completed  only  6  of  the  eight  rituximab/chemotherapy 
induction  cycles,  while  an  additional  patient  in  the  rituximab  maintenance  arm  received  7  out  of  the 
eight induction treatment cycles. Nine of the 1018 patients withdrew before the start of observation or 
maintenance  treatment,  and  finally  the  rituximab  maintenance/observation  phase  safety  analysis 
population (MSAP) comprised 1009 patients (508 observation, 501 rituximab).

Maintenance/observation phase 
At the clinical cut-off of January 14 2009, 285 patients (57%) in the rituximab arm had received all 12 
treatment cycles and completed the 2 years of rituximab maintenance therapy (Table 16).  In 
comparison, 95 patients (19%) in the observation arm had completed all 12 observation visits.  The 
median number of visits attended for patients in the observation arm was 9, compared to 12 visits 
attended (cycles received) in the rituximab arm.

  Adverse Events 
The proportion of patients who experienced at least one adverse event (including Grade 3–5 toxicities, 
Grade 2–5 infections, and SAEs) during the maintenance/observation phase was 52% in the rituximab 
arm  vs  35%  in  the  observation  arm.  The  most  common  categories  of  AEs  were  infections  and 
infestations  (mainly  bronchitis),  neoplasms  (mainly  basal  cell  carcinoma),  and  blood  and  lymphatic 
system disorders (mainly neutropenia). The incidence of other categories of AEs was < 4% and similar 
in  the  two  study  arms.  AEs  which  occurred  with  an  incidence  of  1%  or  more  in  either  arm  are

The majority of AEs were Grade 2 in severity (165/269 [61%] in the observation arm; 291/459 [63%] 
in the rituximab arm), and the majority (85%) of those events were Grade 2 infections (144 events in 
the observation arm, and 248 events in the rituximab arm).  
More patients in the rituximab arm than in the observation arm experienced at least one Grade 3 or 4 
adverse  event  (23%  vs  16%).  This  difference  was  mainly  due  to  a  higher  incidence  of  Grade  3  or  4 
neutropenia (4% vs <1%) and infections (4% vs <1%) in the rituximab arm than in the observation 
arm, respectively.  
There were five Grade 5 (fatal) AEs. 
 
Other serious adverse events (SAEs) 
A total of 193 SAEs were reported for 158 patients (63 [12%] in the observation arm, and 95 [19%] in 
the  rituximab  arm)  during  the  maintenance/observation  phase  (Table  19).  No  single  type  of  SAE 
occurred with an incidence of 1% or more in either arm. The most common class of SAEs overall was 
neoplasms  (39  events  overall  affecting  37  patients),  including  basal  cell  carcinoma  (2  patients  in  the 
observation arm vs 4 patients in the rituximab arm), colon cancer (three patients in the rituximab arm) 
and breast cancer (two patients in the rituximab arm). The most common class of SAE in the rituximab 
arm was infections and infestations (25 patients [5%] vs 6 patients [1%] in the observation arm). In 
the  rituximab  arm,  3  patients  had  SAEs  of  pneumonia,  2  patients  had  diverticulitis,  and  two  patients 
had hepatitis B. In the observation arm, 3 patients had SAEs of urinary tract infections. Other serious 
infections  were  reported  by  1  patient  in  each  case.  Serious  cardiac  disorders  were  reported  for  2 
patients in the observation arm compared with 11 patients in the rituximab arm.

  Deaths 
At the time of data cut-off (January 14, 2009), a total of 31 patients in the safety population (MSAP) 
had died (Table 20).  The number of deaths was higher in the observation arm than in the rituximab 
arm  (18  patients  vs  13  patients).  The  most  common  cause  of  death  was  disease  progression 
(lymphoma),  which  accounted  for  12  deaths  in  the  observation  arm  and  10  deaths  in  the  rituximab 
arm.  The  incidence  of  non-lymphoma  deaths  was:  6  patients  in  the  observation  arm  vs  3  patients  in 
the rituximab arm. 
Five of the 9 remaining deaths were considered to be outcome of AEs (Table 21). Two fatal AEs in the 
observation  arm  were  a  result  of  neoplasms:  leukaemia  considered  as  possibly  related  to  trial 
treatment and metastatic neoplasm considered to be treatment-unrelated. The 3 recorded fatal AEs in 
the  rituximab  arm  resulted  from  a  treatment-unrelated  disorder  (unknown/unevaluable  event), 
hepatitis B considered to be probably treatment-related and pulmonary haemorrhage considered to be 
treatment-unrelated. 
The remaining 4 deaths (not due to lymphoma or reported as AEs) were all in the observation arm and 
were due to acute myeloid leukaemia, coronary artery disease, myelodysplastic syndrome, and sepsis.

Laboratory findings 
 
Haematology and Biochemistry 
Haematology and biochemistry parameters were very similar between the two arms during the course 
of the maintenance/observation phase, except for lymphocyte counts, which increased with time in the 
observation arm compared with the rituximab arm. This difference was probably due to B-cell recovery 
in the observation arm compared with continued B-cell suppression in the rituximab arm. 
The  majority  of  patients  in  both  study  arms  showed  no  change  in  NCI-CTC  grade  for  any  laboratory 
test parameter during the maintenance/observation phase. In the rituximab arm, a higher number of 
shifts to Grade 3/4 values was observed for lymphopenia as well as leucopenia and neutropenia. There 
were very few shifts to Grade 3/4 for blood chemistry parameters, and for these parameters there was 
little difference between the two study arms. 
In  the  rituximab  arm,  8%  of  patients  recorded  newly  occurring  Grade  3  or  4  neutropenia  based  on 
laboratory  counts,  while  4%  of  patients  recorded  AEs  of  neutropenia.  Similarly,  10%  of  patients 
recorded newly occurring Grade 3 or  4 lymphopenia based on laboratory data, while less than 1%  of 
patients recorded adverse events of lymphopenia. 
Additional Laboratory Parameters 
Differential Lymphocyte Counts 
Patients  at  study  sites  in France  underwent  additional  sampling  for  immunophenotyping  of  peripheral 
blood  cells.  Absolute  levels  of  circulating  B-cells  (CD19-positive),  T-cells  (CD3-positive),  and  natural 
killer  cells  (CD16-  or  CD56-positive)  were  assessed  before  induction  therapy,  after  induction  therapy 
(baseline),  and  every  six  months  for  the  first  three  years  after  randomisation  or  until  recovery  if  not 
reached at this time. 
B-Cells 
Analysis  of  CD19-positive  lymphocyte  subsets  showed  suppression  of  B-cells  in  both  study  arms  at 
baseline  (after  completion  of  induction  therapy)  and  continued  B-cell  suppression  during  the 
maintenance/observation  phase  for  patients  in  the  rituximab  arm.  In  comparison,  patients  in  the 
observation arm showed recovery of B-cells during the maintenance/observation phase, with the mean 
value  returning  to  within  the  normal  range  by  visit  6  (ie,  approximately  one  year  after  completing 
in  the  observation  arm  at  the  end  of  the 
induction  therapy).  The  mean  B-cell  count

Page 30/48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
maintenance/observation  phase  was  0.16 × 109/L  (compared  with  undetectable  counts  in  the 
rituximab arm. 
T-Cells 
The  mean  T-cell  counts  at  baseline  (after  completion  of  induction  therapy)  was  0.90 × 109/L  in  the 
observation  arm  vs  0.91 × 109/L  in  the  rituximab  arm  (both  within  the  standard  reference  range). 
Although  the  mean  values  increased  to  1.06 × 109/L  in  the  observation  arm  and  decreased  to 
0.86 × 109/L  in  the  rituximab  arm  at  visit 3),  there  was  little  difference  between  the  two  arms  over 
subsequent visits and most patients in the two arms remained within the normal range throughout the 
maintenance/observation phase. 
Natural Killer Cells 
The  mean  counts  of  natural  killer  (NK)  cells  at  baseline  (after  completion  of  induction  therapy)  were 
0.17 × 109/L  in  the  observation  arm  vs  0.17 × 109/L  in  the  rituximab  arm.  These  values  increased 
slightly  during  the  course  of  the  maintenance/observation  phase,  and  remained  within  the  normal 
range throughout the maintenance/observation phase. At visit 12, the mean counts were 0.24 × 109/L 
in the observation arm and 0.23 × 109/L in the rituximab arm. 
Immunoglobulins 
Over the course of the maintenance/observation phase, mean Ig (IgG, IgA and IgM) values and 95% 
confidence intervals in both study arms remained within the normal range.  
the  numbers  of  patients  with  available 
Although 
the 
maintenance/observation phase, the majority of evaluable patients in both arms continued to have IgG 
levels of 4 g/L or higher. At the end of the maintenance/observation phase, 11 patients (26%) in the 
observation  arm  and  36  patients  (47%)  in  the  rituximab  arm  had  IgG  levels  lower  than  7 g/L.  One 
patient  (2%)  in  the  observation  arm  and  4  patients  (5%)  in  the  rituximab  arm  had  IgG  levels  lower 
than 4 g/L at the end of the maintenance/observation phase. 
IgG  data  decreased  during 
Recovery  of  IgG  levels  during  the  maintenance/observation  phase  was  observed  for  5  of  the  11 
patients  who  had  IgG  levels  at  the  end  of  induction  lower  than  the  LLN  and  lower  than  the  value  at 
screening (1/5 patients [20%] in the observation arm, and 4/6 patients [67%] in the rituximab arm). 
Of  7  patients  with  IgA  concentrations  below  LLN  and  their  screening  value  after  induction,  none 
showed  recovery.  During  the  maintenance  period,  9/11  patients  showed  recovery  of  IgM 
concentrations in the observation arm vs 2 /16 patients in the rituximab arm.

Infections  were  the  most  commonly  occurring  AEs  in  all  three  age  categories.  For  patients  under 
65 years,  the  incidence  of  AEs  was  54%  in  the  rituximab  arm  vs  32%  the  observation  arm.  For 
patients aged 65–74 years, the overall incidence of AEs was 47% in the rituximab arm vs 46% in the 
observation  arm.  In  the  75 year  age  group,  the  incidence  of  AEs  was  52%  in  the  rituximab  arm  vs 
50% in the observation arm. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Nine  pregnancies  were  reported  in  the  PRIMA  trial,  including  2  pregnancies  in  the  female  partners  of 
male  patients.  Two  pregnancies  occurred  during  the  induction  phase,  and  7  pregnancies  occurred 
during  the  maintenance/observation  phase.  Of  the  6  patients  who  became  pregnant  during  the 
maintenance/observation  phase,  3  patients  were  in  the  observation  arm  and  3  patients  were  in  the 
rituximab  arm.  The  3  women  in  the  observation  arm  received  4,  6,  and  7  doses  of  rituximab, 
respectively, and all delivered normal babies, 1 baby delivered at 35th gestational week, the 2 others 
probably both at full term.  
  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new information is available 
  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Discontinuation  
A  total  of  27  patients  discontinued  maintenance  treatment/observation  as  a  result  of  AEs  (8  patients 
[2%] in the observation arm, and 19 patients [4%] in the rituximab arm). The most common AEs that 
led to treatment discontinuation were neoplasms, which accounted for the withdrawal of 6 patients in 
the  observation  arm  and  5  patients  in  the  rituximab  arm.  Four  patients  in  the  rituximab  arm  were 
withdrawn as a result of infections: hepatitis B (2 patients), endocarditis, and mycobacterial infection. 
One  case  of  hepatitis  B  was  considered  to  be  unrelated  to  trial  treatment,  and  the  other  3  infections 
were  considered  as  being  probably  treatment-related.  Five  patients  discontinued  treatment  after 
becoming pregnant. 
Adverse Events Leading to Dose Interruptions or Modifications 
A  total  of  30  patients  had  their  dosing  of  rituximab  interrupted  or  modified  as  a  result  of  an  AE.  The 
most  common  reasons  for  interrupting  the  dose  schedule  or  for  modifying  the  rituximab  dose  were 
infections  and  infestations  (12  patients)  including  three  bronchitis  events  and  two  upper  respiratory 
tract infections, and blood and lymphatic disorders (9 patients) including seven neutropenia events and 
five leucopenia events. 
 
Post marketing experience 
Since the first marketing authorisation of rituximab, more than 2.1 million patients have been treated 
with this antibody. The majority of these were patients with NHL.  
With  a  data  cut-off  date  of  31  December  2009,  a  total  of  44,681  AEs  have  been  reported  with 
rituximab  worldwide  to  the  global  safety  database.  Of  these  reported  AEs,  21,642  were  classified  as 
serious.  The  events  were  reported  from  spontaneous  sources  (post-marketing  experience).  Other 
sources  include  clinical  trials  in  oncology  and  rheumatoid  arthritis  (company-sponsored  and 
investigator-sponsored trials). A summary of all AEs in the global safety database for rituximab as of 
31  December  2009  is  shown  in  the  table  23.  The  most  frequently  reported  events  were  from  the 
system organ classes (SOCs) general disorders and administration site conditions (15.9%), infections 
and  infestations  (14%),  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (10.4%)  and  respiratory,  thoracic  and 
mediastinal disorders (9.5%).

Patient Exposure  
 
Patients in the ECOG 1496 study were to receive a minimum of 6 cycles and a maximum of 8 cycles of 
CVP induction therapy. Of the patients that proceeded to the rituximab maintenance/observation phase 
of  the  study,  a  total  of  96%  (309/322)  received  between  6  and  8  cycles  of  induction  CVP  (157/161 
patients  [97.5%]  were  subsequently  treated  with  rituximab  maintenance  and  152/161  patients 
[94.4%] who then underwent observation).  
At  the  time  of  data  transfer  (November  8,  2004),  52%  (83/161)  of  patients  treated  with  rituximab 
maintenance  had  received  the  protocol-specified  maximum  of  16  infusions,  and  42  patients  (26%) 
were still in the study and continuing to receive rituximab maintenance.  
  Adverse events 
At  the  time  of  data  transfer  (November  8,  2004),  144  patients  (89%)  who  received  rituximab 
maintenance had experienced one or more AEs during the rituximab maintenance/observation phase of 
the study compared with 101 patients (63%) in the observation arm.  The most common AEs, affecting 
between  30-45%  of  rituximab-treated  patients,  were  haematological  (leucopenia,  anaemia),  fatigue, 
and peripheral sensory neuropathy. Other common events in the rituximab arm included infections and

nervous system disorder (each 19%), lung disorder (18%) and liver and skin disorder (each 17%), all 
of which had a higher frequency with rituximab than with observation. 
All  AEs  for  which  there  was  at  least  a  2%  higher  frequency  among  patients  in  the  rituximab

Grade  3  or  4  adverse  events  were  recorded  for  26  (16.1%)  of  the  rituximab  maintenance  patients 
compared with 18 (11.2%) patients in the observation arm.  The Grade 3 or 4 AE with a ≥ 2% higher 
frequency amongst patients in the rituximab maintenance arm compared with those in the observation 
arm  was  granulocytopenia  (3.7%  vs.  0.6%).  Grade  3  or  4  cardiac  events  were  more  frequent  with 
rituximab (4 patients [2.5%] vs 1 patient [0.6%]).

At  the  cut-off  date,  21  patients  (13.1%)  in  the  observation  arm  and  15  patients  (9.3%)  in  the 
rituximab arm had died during the study.  Of these, 10 patients in the observation arm and 8 patients 
in the rituximab arm were considered to have died due to progressive disease.  There was one AE that 
resulted in death: one patient in the observation arm died due to an infection.  The cause of death was 
recorded as “not treatment- or disease-related” for 7 patients in the observation arm and 3 patients in 
the rituximab arm and as “missing/unknown for 4 patients in each arm.

A  total  of  5  expedited  AEs,  all  cardiac  in  nature,  were  recorded  in  2  patients  during  Stage  2 
(maintenance  phase)  of  the  study.  One  patient  treated  with  rituximab  maintenance  therapy 
experienced  extrasystoles,  ventricular  arrhythmia  and  ventricular  tachycardia  (all  Grade  4),  while  1 
patient in the observation arm experienced myocardial infarction and myocardial ischemia (both Grade 
4).

  Discussion on clinical safety 
Based  on  the  results  from  the  pivotal  study,  the  most  common  AE  in  the  rituximab  arm  during  the 
maintenance/observational  phase,  was  infection  and  infestations  (especially  bronchitis  and  upper 
respiratory tract infection), which was reported for 37% of patients in the rituximab arms vs. 22 % of 
patients in the observation arm. Also AE belonging to the blood and lymphatic system class were more 
frequently  observed  in  the  rituximab  maintenance  arm.  The  difference  was  mainly  caused  by  higher 
number of neutropenia cases (14 in the rituximab arm vs. 5 in the observation arm). 
Overall, the most common class of SAE was neoplasm, occurring in both trial arms (17 patients in the 
observation arm and 20 in the rituximab arm).  
The most common class of SAE in the rituximab arm was infections and infestations (25 patients in the 
rituximab arm vs. 6 patients in the observational arm). 
The  number  of  deaths  was  higher  in  the  observation  arm  than  in  the  rituximab  arm  (18  vs.  13 
patients).  Also  the  incidence  of  non-lymphoma  deaths  was  higher  in  the  observation  arm  than  in  the 
rituximab arm. 
The  results  from  the  supportive  study  concerning  the  reported  AEs  and  the  difference  between 
maintenance  rituximab  and  observation  were  comparable  with  the  AEs  reported  in  the  pivotal  study. 
More  AEs  in  the  blood  and  lymphatic  system  and  infections  were  observed  in  the  rituximab 
maintenance arm in comparison with the observational arm.  
The potential risk of PML and the risk of second malignancies require additional risk minimization 
activities and the proposed monitoring is adequate. As a consequence, section 4.4 of the 
SmPC has been updated to include information on the PML risk. Finally, since PML 
occurs predominantly in patients that are immunosuppressed, section 4.3 of the SmPC has been 
updated to include contraindication for patients in a severely immunocompromised state.

Due  to  postmarketing  cases  of  Posterior  Reversible  Encephalopathy  Syndrome  (PRES)  and  Reversible 
Posterior  Leukoencephalopathy  Syndrome  (RPLS),  the  SmPC  has  been  updated  to  reflect  the  risk 
factors for PRES/RPLS.  
Overall,  rituximab  maintenance  therapy  was  well  tolerated  and  no  unexpected  safety  findings  were 
observed.

Routine: There are no treatments available to prevent, 
retard, stop, or reverse the disease once established in 
patients.  
Enhanced  pharmacovigilance  practices  including  the 
use  of  a  guided  questionnaire  and  regular  assessment 
reports  of  all  PML  cases  are  performed  to  monitor 
cases  of  PML.  The  MAH  considers  the  wording  in  the 
SmPC  sufficient  to  inform  prescribers  of  this  risk  with 
extended information in the label.

Routine:  B-Cell  depletion  is  the  expected  therapeutic 
outcome  with  rituximab.  but  detailed  information  on 
B-cell  and  immunoglobulin  changes  is  provided  in  the 
SmPC.  The  effect  of  prolonged  B-cell  depletion  in  the 
rituximab  maintenance  population  will  be  analysed 
using  long-term  follow-up  from  PRIMA.  Additionally, 
the  MAH  considers  the  wording  in  the  SmPC  sufficient 
to inform prescribers of this risk.

Routine:  The  labelling  for  the  RA  indication  cautions 
prescribers regarding the use of rituximab in patients 
with  an  active  infection  or  other  predispositions  to 
serious infection, and regarding the prompt evaluation 
and  treatment  of  infections  that  occur  following 
rituximab  therapy.  Company  representatives  will  be 
informed as part of their training to draw prescribers’ 
attention 
information. 
Additional:  In  ongoing  and  planned  clinical  trials, 
prospective  monitoring  of  laboratory  markers  of 
humoral  immune  status  (eg,  B  cell  counts,  Ig 
counts/titres,  complete  blood  counts)  is  performed. 
The  clinical  trials  allow  placebo  comparisons  of 
humoral  immunity  markers  during  the  double  blind 
period, as well as long term follow up for patients who 
continue with rituximab in open label extensions. 
In  ongoing  and  planned  clinical  trials,  prospective 
focused  evaluation  of  all 
data  collection  and 
infections/symptoms  of 
is  conducted. 
Spontaneous  reports  of  hepatitis  B  infection  will  be 
assessed  using  a  standardized  questionnaire  to 
determine if the infection is de novo or a reactivation 
of  a  previous  infection.  All  reports  of  Hepatitis  B  or 
reactivation of Hepatitis B are expedited for reporting 
to  the  agency,  with  regular  data  reviews.  All  reports 
of  tuberculosis  or  reactivation  of  tuberculosis  will  be 
carefully analysed and reported to the agency. 
As  part  of  its  rituximab-specific  protocol,  the  BSRBR, 
ARTIS  and  RABBIT  will  collect  data  regarding  the 
incidence  of  serious  infections  and  the  administration 
of IV immunoglobulins.  
Routine:  The  decision  for  all  patients  to  receive  IV 
corticosteroid  pre-medication  was  based  on  the 
reduced  incidence  and  severity  of  acute  infusion 
reactions  in  patients  in  study  WA17043,  who  were 
pre-treated with IV corticosteroid. In study WA17043, 
medically-reviewed  acute  infusion  reactions  following 
the  first  infusion  of  the  first  course  occurred  in 
18/65 (28%)  patients  who  received  rituximab  (1 g 
dose)  without 
IV  corticosteroid  pre-medication 
compared  to  24/127  (19%)  patients  who  received 
rituximab  with  IV  corticosteroid  premedication.  The 
addition  of  oral  corticosteroid  between  rituximab 
infusions  did  not  appear  to  provide  any  additional 
benefit  over  use  of  IV  corticosteroid  alone  for  the 
prevention  of  acute  infusion  reactions.  Therefore  the 
sponsor  considers  the  use  of  IV  corticosteroid  as 
pre-medication  to  be  advisable  prior  to  all  rituximab 
infusions. This advice is reflected in the SmPC. 
Additional:  Spontaneous  reports  of  possible  infusion 
reactions  will  be  assessed  and  evaluated  using  good 
pharmacovigilance practices. 
In  ongoing  and  planned  clinical  trials,  prospective 
data  collection  and  evaluation  of  serious/severe 
infusion  reactions  will  continue  to  be  carried  out  in 
in  open-label 
long  term 
extensions. 
As  part  of  the  proposed  rituximab-specific  protocols, 
the  British  Society  of  Rheumatology  Biologics

the  German  registry  (RABBIT)  will  report  serious 
infusion reactions.

Benefit risk assessment 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
The  data  presented  from  the  pivotal  PRIMA  trial  and  the  supporting  ECOG  1496  trial  showed  that 
rituximab maintenance therapy every two months for two years gives a significant improvement of PFS 
in  patients  with  advanced  follicular  lymphoma  who  have  responded  to  standard  induction 
chemotherapies. PFS has been recognized by the CHMP as a relevant primary endpoint in this clinical 
situation, and as such, an improvement in PFS may be of clinical relevance.  
The  results  of  the  PRIMA  study  showed  that  the  25th  percentile  PFS  for  patients  on  observation  was 
16.7  months  and  for  patient  on  rituximab  maintenance  was  36  months,  with  a  HR  0.50  [(CI  0.39; 
0.64),  investigator  based]  or  0.54  (IRC-based).  However,  it  is  difficult  to  evaluate  the  absolute  PFS 
gain with nearly 75% of the patients still classified as responders at the end of the maintenance phase. 
The median has not been reached in the investigator-assessed dataset. For the IRC-assessed dataset 
the median PFS gain is 6.2 months (from 30.9 to 37.1 months). In the context of a very long natural 
history (median OS about 10 years) of the targeted disease, the long-term benefit of this gain is still 
uncertain. 
Furthermore,  there  is  no  difference  in  OS  for  the  two  treatment  strategies  (observation  vs. 
maintenance). 
On  the  positive  side,  rituximab  maintenance  significantly  delays  time  to  next  anti-lymphoma  therapy 
by  a  year  (a  secondary  endpoint)  and  may  decrease  the  transformation  rate  (non  statistically 
significant result). More patients are classified as responders (CR/CRu/PR) at the end of maintenance 
therapy (74% versus 55%). 
The  results  of  the  supportive  ECOG1496  were  comparable  to  the  results  of  the  PRIMA  study:  a 
statistically  significant  increase  of  the  PFS  was  observed  (HR  of  0.37  with  a  CI  of  0.25;  0.56)  after 
rituximab  maintenance  therapy  in  comparison  with  observation  only.  The  PFS  improvement  in  this 
study seems to be even better than in the PRIMA study. However the benefit might be overestimated 
as the patients included in the observational arm didn’t receive rituximab at any moment of the trial.   
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
A  median  follow-up  of  about  2  years  is  relatively  short  for  the  assessment  of  long-term  benefit  of 
rituximab  maintenance  although  the  cut-off  date  allows  a  final  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  PFS. 
Taking  into  account  that  all  patients  will  have  a  continuous  pattern  of  relapse  and  retreatments,  it  is 
not  realistic  to  evaluate  the  influence  of  rituximab  maintenance  on  OS.  However,  patients  must  be 
followed up for PFS and OS for at least five years, final OS data should be submitted in time (FUM).    
There  certainly  are  data  to  support  that  a  long  remission  after  first-line  therapy  predicts  a  better 
response to subsequent therapies and a longer survival. However, as maintenance therapy after first-
line treatment has yet to show an OS benefit, the biology may be different in patients who relapse on 
the background of rituximab maintenance therapy than in patients who have only been observed. The 
rituximab resistance rate after rituximab maintenance therapy at first remission has not been studied. 
More data about the rituximab resistance rate as the result of post-first line maintenance therapy are 
needed to estimate this effect on the success (response, PFS, OS) of eventual rituximab retreatment.  
Both  the  pivotal  study  and  the  supportive  study  showed  a  clear  trend  towards  a  lower  HR  for  PFS 
events in younger patients (0.45 in patients < 60 yrs. vs. 0.59 in patients > 60 yrs in the PRIMA trial). 
One  might  suspect  that  the  benefit  is  further  diluted  in  even  older  patients,  e.g.  patients  >  70  year, 
who make up a considerable fraction of follicular lymphoma patients (25-30 %), according to a Dutch 
population-based  registry  study  (Maartense  et  al.  (2002),  Ann  Oncol  13(8):  1275-1284.)  and 
approximately 20% in the ECOG 1496 study. Further subgroup analyses of the PRIMA trial (for which 
the trial is not powered) indicate that patients older than 70 or 75 years may have lesser benefit from 
rituximab maintenance therapy (HRs between 0.80 and 1.15, with very wide confidence intervals).  A 
further subgroup analysis of the elderly patients is needed when more mature data become available, 
with more events making the subgroup statistics more meaningful.  
The PRIMA study included only patients with a high-tumour burden according to the GELF criteria and 
it  is  not  entirely  clear  whether  the  data  can  be  extrapolated  to  all  patients  with  follicular  lymphoma. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 46/48 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
However,  the  supportive  ECOG  study  included  patients  with  stage  III-IV  according  to  the  Ann  Arbor 
staging system making the claimed indication reasonable. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
Safety  data  from  the  pivotal  PRIMA  trial  are  in  line  with  the  SmPC  and  previous  post-marketing 
experience for this monoclonal antibody that has been marketed in the EU since 1998. The important 
difference in safety is a clear increase in the incidence of infections and leuko-/neutropenia in patients 
treated  with rituximab  as maintenance.  There  is  an increased  incidence  of  SAEs  related  to  infections, 
cardiac disorders and gastrointestinal disorders in the rituximab arm. The numbers are still rather low 
(maybe even if compared to an age-matched background population). 
There  is  a  clearly  increased  incidence  of  infectious  AEs  and  SAEs  in  the  rituximab  arm.  While  the 
difference is clear regarding SAEs, the numbers are quite low (25 infectious SAEs in the rituximab arm 
and 6 SAEs in the observation arm). 
The  data  do  not  raise  concerns  about  a  high  risk  of  HBV  reactivation  during  rituximab  maintenance 
therapy.  As  in  other  studies,  it  is  uncertain  whether  the  observed  sporadic  occurrence  of  PML  is 
secondary  to  rituximab  or  to  previous  chemotherapy/compromised  immune  system  function. 
Unconfounded cases of PML have been reported in patients with RA treated with rituximab. 
Furthermore, significant laboratory value differences between the rituximab and the observation arms 
are  the  suppressed  level  of  B-cells  and  the  (usually  within  normal  ranges)  reduced  immunoglobulin 
counts in the rituximab arm. 
It is reassuring that the numbers of deaths are lower in the rituximab maintenance arm with regards to 
both lymphoma-related and non-lymphoma-related deaths. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Relatively few elderly patients (>75 yrs) were included in the pivotal study. AEs and SAEs do not seem 
to increase with age. However, the elderly patients selected for a randomised trial do not necessarily 
reflect  an  age-matched  background  population  for  which  we  are  concerned  when  considering  the 
risk/benefit balance. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
It  is  a  dogma  in  cancer  therapy  that  achievement  of  durable  remission  is  of  clinical  benefit  because 
eradication of all neoplastic cells is a prerequisite for long-term cure. A lesser reduction in the tumour 
burden  for  a  period  of  time  may  also  be  of  clinical  benefit.  Therefore,  PFS  represents  an  accepted 
intermediate efficacy endpoint. PFS should generally be supported by a prolongation in OS. However, 
considering the very long natural history for patients with newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma with a 
median survival of about 10 years, PFS remains the only realistic efficacy endpoint. In evaluating the 
importance of a clear PFS gain as shown in this application, one has to take into account the natural 
course of disease of patients with follicular lymphoma. The disease usually follows an indolent course 
with  a  continuous  pattern  of  relapses  after  each  therapy,  the  remissions  having  decreasing  duration 
with  increasing  number  of  retreatments.  In  younger  and  middle-aged  patients  the  cause  of  death  is 
most  commonly  the  lymphoma  or  the  therapy  related  with  secondary  malignancies.  At  the  time  of 
death many patients will have had transformation to a more malignant aggressive lymphoma. 
On that clinical background a PFS gain in a rather narrow time window cannot stand alone as measure 
of  clinical  benefit.  Significant  PFS  gain  has  been  adequately  demonstrated  by  the  pivotal  and 
supportive  study.  The  primary  endpoint  is  supported  by  a  higher  response  rate  at  the  end  of 
maintenance  therapy  (75%)  compared  to  a  rate  of  55%  in  patients  also  reflected  in  a  delay  of  12 
months in time to next therapy. Since such therapy most probably will comprise cytostatics, this delay 
is considered to be of clinical benefit. There are also data to support that a long remission after first-
line therapy predicts a better response to subsequent therapies and a longer survival. However, these 
data  are  mainly  derived  from  clinical  series  without  maintenance  and  it  is  uncertain  whether  the 
findings can be extrapolated to the population in question. A high response rate will most probably also 
mean  less  constitutional  symptoms  but  this  effect  has  not  been  specifically  addressed  in  this 
application.  Finally,  there  are  no  indications  that  rituximab  maintenance  enhances  the  risk  of 
histological transformation. Although insignificant so far, the incidence of transformation may be lower 
in patients receiving maintenance therapy. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 47/48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
On  the  negative  side,  the  burden  of  additional  maintenance  therapy  in  terms  of  toxicity  should  be 
taken in account. The known safety profile of rituximab remains unchanged when the antibody is used 
as maintenance every two months for two years. The mortality is numerically lower in the maintenance 
group both in relation to lymphoma deaths and non lymphoma deaths. 
Therefore, no serious unfavourable effects have been detected. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
The application has demonstrated a very clear gain in PFS supported by a higher remission rate at the 
end  of  maintenance,  a  delay  in  the  time  to  next  antilymphoma  therapy  and  a  potential  lower  rate  of 
histological transformation.  
No serious safety concerns have been identified. 
Therefore, the CHMP considered that the Benefit-Risk ratio of rituximab for the treatment of follicular 
lymphoma patients responding to induction therapy is positive. 
All  the  proposed  consequential  changes  to  sections  4.1,  4.2,  4.3,  4.4,  4.8,  4.9  and  5.1  of  the  SmPC 
and to the Package Leaflet were agreed. 
Further,  the  MAH  has  updated  annex  IIB  to  reflect  the  latest  version  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan 
(version  5.1)  agreed  with  the  CHMP,  which  is  acceptable.  Minor  editorial  changes  have  also  been 
implemented.

1.  Introduction 
On 26 August 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for XAGRID, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that  the  SPD422-404  study,  “multicentre  paediatric  disease  registry  in  essential 
thrombocythaemia (ET)”, is a stand alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Xagrid is brand name for  anagrelide hydrochloride presented as capsules in one dose strength of 0.5 
mg. 
In the SPD422-404 study, the drug was available as capsules at dosage strength of 0.5 mg. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Anagrelide  hydrochloride  (XAGRID®)  is  the  only  selective  inhibitor  of  megakaryocyte  maturation  and 
platelet production, and is indicated for the treatment of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). 
It is approved in a total of 47 countries globally including the United States (US) and European Union 
(EU) and is licensed as either AGRYLIN or XAGRID. 
In 2007 the Paediatric Regulation came into force in the EU with the objective to improve the health of 
children  in  Europe  by  facilitating  the  development  and  availability  of  medicines  for  children.  The 
Regulation  introduced  obligations  and  incentives  for  research  into  new  and  existing  drugs  and 
introduced  the  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (PIP)  which  needs  to  be  agreed  with  the  EMA  Paediatric 
Committee (PDCO). The need for such research for XAGRID was discussed extensively with the PDCO; 
a briefing document along with the study proposal was submitted and reviewed by the PDCO between 
August 2009 and April 2010. 
In April 2010, the MAH agreed with the PDCO to conduct a disease registry study (study SPD422-404) 
to investigate disease progression, symptoms, and  treatment effects on platelet count, to summarize 
drug utilization of cytoreductive therapies, to summarize long term assessment of disease progression, 
and to summarize safety of cytoreductive therapies in a population of paediatric subjects. 
The  Post  Approval  Measure  is  submitted  under  Article  46  and  comprises  of  a  final  study  report.  The 
MAH confirms no changes to the approved Product Information have been requested as a consequence 
of this study report.

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
SPD422-404  study  “Multicentre  paediatric  disease  registry  in  essential 
thrombocythaemia (ET)” 
Description 
A noninterventional study to evaluate the conditions under which cytoreductive therapy is prescribed in 
paediatric population as well as the effect and duration of treatment. 
This  multicentre  study  was  performed  in  Italy,  UK,  France,  Germany,  Spain,  Greece,  Swizerland  and 
Czech Rep. This study aimed to enroll 60 subjects at approximately 29 sites. With an expected average 
of 2 subjects per site, analysis was not broken down by site. 
Period of study: 28 September 2010 to 01 March 2016 (end of data collection) 
Observation period will be at least 1 day and up to a maximum of 60 months. 
A data cut will take place in March 2013. 
Methods 
Objectives 
The objectives of this study were:  
-To observe disease progression, symptoms and treatment effects on platelet count, 
-To summarise drug utilisation of cytoreductive therapies, 
-To summarise incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), 
-To summarise the long-term assessment of disease progression /safety. 
Disease  progression  was  defined  for  a  patient  if  disease  progression  was  reported  as  an  AE  or  there 
were  any  reports  of  leukaemia  or  myelofibrosis.  Patients  who  report  the  additional  use  of  other 
cytoreductive therapy or any significant dose increases in cytoreductive drug therapy were investigated 
for possible disease progression. 
Symptoms of the disease were captured through the reporting of AEs assessed by the investigator as 
being related to ET. 
Details of drug utilisation of cytoreductive treatments included type of treatment, dose level, duration 
of exposure, and reasons for change or modification. 
Percentages  of  patients  taking  each  cytoreductive  therapy  (including  patients  who  switch)  were 
calculated. 
Adverse  events  were  collected  throughout  the  duration  of  the  study  and  were  summarized  by 
treatment and severity. 
Frequency  of  drug  related  side  effects  observed  were  calculated  over  appropriate  time  periods  for 
patients  who  were  treated  with  cytoreductive  therapy  and  for  patients  who  were  untreated  (no 
treatment/ASA alone).

Study design 
Figure 1: 
Study population /Sample size 
Planned 
The  study  planned  to  recruit  at  least  60  subjects  with  ET  (aged  6-17  years  inclusive)  during  the 
enrollment period up to March 2013 who, according to the treating physician, had ET using the World 
Health Organization (WHO) criteria as guidance. Subjects could be enrolled regardless of cytoreductive 
therapy.  To  ensure  50%  of  subjects  had  at  least  1  year  observation  at  the  time  of  data  cut  (March 
2013), it was anticipated that 30 subjects would be enrolled by March 2012. 
Analyzed 
A total of 69 patients were enrolled and 64 had follow-up data. 
Treatments 
Commercially  available  ET  treatments  (hydroxycarbamide  and  interferon  α-2A)  were  used;  there  was 
thus  no  specific  paediatric  formulation  for  anagrelide.  The  study  followed  the  usual  medicinal  clinical 
practice of paediatrics haematologists and their decisions in treating children. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The study outcomes will be assessed by measuring the following variables in accordance with routine 
clinical practice: 
-  Cytoreductive  drug  utilisation  within  this  paediatric  ET  population  (details  will  include  duration  of 
exposure and reasons for switching) for treatments recorded as taken prior to or during the study 
- Platelet counts 
- Adverse events 
- Clinical laboratory evaluations 
- Vital signs (weight, heart rate and blood pressure). 
EMA/791522/2016  
Page 5/23 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Efficacy endpoints: 
The following efficacy information was collected: 
- Platelet counts 
- Number of thrombohemorrhagic events (collected as AEs) 
- Information on disease progression 
- Information on symptoms/side effects of ET 
- Physician’s Overall Assessment of Treatment Outcome 
Safety endpoints: 
The following safety information was collected: 
- Adverse events (all AEs) 
- Clinical laboratory evaluations 
- Vital signs (including weight, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure [SBP and DBP]) 
- Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram 
Statistical Methods 
All analyses and listings included all enrolled patients. 
->Treatment cohorts 
Data were summarized for subjects who were treated with cytoreductive therapy and for subjects who 
were not treated with cytoreductive therapy (“No treatment/anti-aggregatory [AA]) Alone”) during the 
observation period only. Usage of cytoreductive therapy prior to date of assent was not considered for 
assignment to cohorts unless it was ongoing on the date of registration itself. 
If no cytoreductive treatments were reported during the observation period it was assumed the subject 
did  not  take  any  cytoreductive  therapy.  It  was  anticipated  that  subjects  may  have  changed  their 
cytoreductive  therapy  during  the  observation  period  and  therefore  it  was  possible  that  a  patient 
originating in the “No Treatment/AA Alone” group later qualified for the cytoreductive group. In these 
cases  all  data  collected  prior  to  the  first  dose  of  cytoreductive  therapy  was  analyzed  in  the  “No 
Treatment/AA  Alone”  group  and  all  data  collected  at  or  after  the  first  dose  of  cytoreductive  therapy 
was analyzed in the Cytoreductive Therapy cohort. Once in the Cytoreductive Therapy cohort, subjects 
remained in the Cytoreductive Therapy cohort. 
Subjects treated with XAGRID were of particular interest and therefore were summarized as a subset 
of  the  Cytoreductive  Therapy  cohort.  Data  collected  at  or  after  the  first  dose  of  XAGRID  in  the 
observation  period  were  analyzed  in  the  XAGRID  cohort  (as  well  as  continuing  to  be  analyzed  in  the 
Cytoreductive Therapy cohort). Once in the XAGRID cohort they remained in this cohort regardless of 
further  treatment  changes.  Additional  specific  treatment  groups  could  be  analyzed  separately 
depending on the frequency of use. 
The  first  cohort  date  was  the  registration  date  and  the  end  date  of  a  cohort  was  the  last  visit  date 
unless the subject switched cohorts and initiates cytoreductive therapies during the observation period. 
In this case, the first date of the Cytoreductive Therapy cohort was the date of start of cytoreductive 
therapy and the end date of the “No Treatment/AA Alone” cohort was the previous day. 
EMA/791522/2016  
Page 6/23 
 
 
  
 
 
 
These cohorts were not independent; however, no inferential analyses were planned for this study and 
the number of subjects included in multiple groups was reported. 
->Definition of Baseline 
Time  of  baseline  and  registration  in  the  study  were  arbitrary  times  and  could  capture  the  subject  at 
any  time  during  the  course  of  their  disease.  Some  subjects  could  have  been  diagnosed  many  years 
before their data are captured and others diagnosed at or near the time of enrollment. 
For  subjects  taking  cytoreductive  therapy  at  the  time  of  the  first  visit,  the  registration  visit  was  the 
baseline visit. In addition, for subjects not taking cytoreductive therapy at enrollment, the registration 
visit was baseline for the “No Treatment/AA Alone” cohort. If a subject initiated cytoreductive therapy 
during the observation period, the baseline for the Cytoreductive Therapy cohort was the date where 
therapy started. 
Similarly  for  the  XAGRID  Group,  if  the  subject  was  taking  XAGRID  at  the  time  of  registration,  the 
registration  visit  was  baseline.  Otherwise,  if  the  subject  started  treatment  with  XAGRID  during  the 
observation period, the visit where the subject started taking XAGRID was the baseline visit. 
->Time intervals 
The post baseline time intervals for analysis were driven by the frequency of visits to the investigator. 
If  feasible,  the  data  were  summarized  in  3-month  intervals.  This  was  reviewed  prior  to  interim  and 
final data cuts. 
Depending on the frequency of visits, the time interval could be narrowed or expanded. Data collected 
less frequently could require longer time intervals to be used for analysis. 
->Examination of subgroups 
The subgroups of subjects with disease progression and symptoms at diagnosis were investigated. 
Subject to the range of subjects enrolled, data could also be summarized according to age groups (6-
11 years, 12-17 years). 
->Interim analyses and data monitoring 
Two  sets  of  statistical  analyses  of  all  data  were  performed  for  this  study,  1  at  the  completion  of  the 
study  in  2016  and  1  at  the  time  of  the  data  cut  in  March  2013  (after  completion  of  enrollment  and 
after at least 30 subjects had been observed for at least 1 year). 
All tables, figures, and listings planned for the final analysis were presented in 2013 after completion of 
enrollment.  The  long-term  assessment  of  disease  progression  was  made  by  including  all  the  3-year 
follow-up data collected up to the completion of the study in 2016. 
There will not be a data monitoring committee for this study.

Baseline data 
Table 2: Demographics (All Enrolled Patients) 
Overall,  the  majority  of  patients  were  female  (59.4%)  and  White  (75.4%).  The  mean  (SD)  age  was 
12.4 (3.26) years. Demographic data were well balanced between the different cohorts. 
Overall,  the  mean  (SD)  time  from  diagnosis  to  cohort  start  was  58.2  (48.81)  months.  Patients  who 
started cytoreductive therapy, did so after approximately 10 months: the time from diagnosis to cohort 
start  was  66.7  (55.20)  months  in  the  “Cytoreductive  Therapy”  cohort  and  66.1  (46.60)  months  and 
XAGRID cohort compared with 58.1 (50.04) months in the “No Treatment/AA Alone” cohort. 
The majority of patients (64 patients [92.8%] overall) were diagnosed using the WHO criteria. 
Symptoms  of  ET  included  headache  (19  patients  [27.5%]  overall),  dizziness  and  paraesthesia  (5 
patients  [7.2%]  overall),  and  symptoms  listed  as  other  (17  patients  24.6%]  overall).  Headache  and 
dizziness  were  more  commonly  reported  for  patients  in  the  “Cytoreductive  therapy”  and  XAGRID 
cohorts.  Symptoms  listed  as  “other”  were  more  commonly  reported  for  patients  in  the  “No 
treatment/AA Alone” cohort. 
The majority of patients (65 patients [94.2%] overall) had no thrombohemorrhagic event at the time 
of diagnosis. 
EMA/791522/2016  
Page 11/23 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The majority of patients (61 patients [88.4%] overall) had no family history of MPN. 
Efficacy results 
All analyses were conducted on all enrolled patients. 
Table 3: All Enrolled Patients per Cohort 
Patients  were  treated  with  XAGRID  in  low  doses  (median  dose  of  0.028  mg/kg  [based  on  the  first 
weight measurement] or 0.019 mg/kg [based on the last weight measurement). Other cytoreductives 
taken  during  the  study  were  hydroxycarbamide,  taken  at  a  median  dose  of  22.117  mg/kg  (based  on 
the  first  weight  measurement)  and  14.955  mg/kg  (based  on  the  last  weight  measurement),  and 
interferon  α-2A,  taken  at  a  median  dose  of  0.003  mg/kg  (based  on  both  the  first  and  last  weight 
measurement). 
Salicylic acid was used by approximately 30% of patients at a median dose of 81.3 mg. 
Platelet count 
Mean  (SD)  platelet  count  at  baseline  was  highest  in  the  “No  Treatment/AA  Alone”  cohort  (980.4 
[552.76  x  109/L)  and  lower  in  the  “Cytoreductive  Therapy”  (766.8  [484.93]  x109/L)  and  XAGRID 
(653.5  [338.34]  x  109/L)  cohorts.  The  majority  of  patients  in  all  3  cohorts  had  platelet  count  values 
≤1500 x 109/L (ie, 85.7%, 87.5%, and 100% of patients, respectively). 
Mean (SD) platelet count at Month 55-57 was higher compared with baseline in the “No Treatment/AA 
Alone”  cohort  (1067.3  [699.57]  x  109/L)  and  lower  compared  with  baseline  in  the  “Cytoreductive 
Therapy” (364.0 [284.26] x 109/L) and XAGRID (364.0 [284.26] x 109/L). The majority of patients in 
all  3  cohorts  had  platelet  count  values  ≤1500  x  109/L  (ie,  75.0%,  100%,  and  100%  of  patients, 
respectively). Note that at the Month 55-57 time point, platelet count data were available for a limited 
number of patients (N=4, 2, and 2, respectively). 
Thrombohemorragic events 
One  patient  in  the  “Cytoreductive  Therapy”  cohort  experienced  2  thrombohemorrhagic  events  during 
the study (intracranial venous thrombosis and cerebral venous thrombosis). 
None of the patients in the XAGRID cohort experienced a thrombohemorrhagic event during the study. 
Disease progression 
A  total  of  2  patients  (3.8%)  in  the  “No  Treatment/AA  Alone”  cohort  and  2  patients  (9.5%)  in  the 
“Cytoreductive Therapy” cohort of which 1 patient (6.7%) on XAGRID, experienced disease progression 
during  the  study.  Note  that  2  of  these  patients  (1  each  the  “No  Treatment/AA  Alone”and 
“Cytoreductive Therapy” [XAGRID] cohorts) experienced myelofibrosis. 
Symptoms of essential thrombocythemia 
EMA/791522/2016  
Page 12/23 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Overall,  8  patients  (15.1%)  in  the  “No  Treatment/AA  Alone”  cohort  and  6  patients  (28.6%)  in  the 
“Cytoreductive  Therapy”  cohort  [of  whom  4  patients  (26.7%)  on  XAGRID],  had  ET  symptoms  during 
the study.  
Physician’s overall assessment of treatment outcome 
As  per  the  investigator,  16  out  of  24  patients  who  received  cytoreductive  therapy  achieved  their 
platelet targets and 14 out of these 24 patients had an improvement in ET symptoms. In addition, 12 
out of 15 patients who received AA therapy experienced an improvement in ET symptoms and 28 out 
of 30 patients who did not receive AA therapy experienced no ET symptoms that required therapy. 
CHMP comment 
As  a  general  comment,  the  SPD422-404  study  “Multicentre  paediatric  disease  registry  in  essential 
thrombocythaemia  (ET)”  is  a  noninterventional  study  assessing  the  conditions  under  which 
cytoreductive  therapy  is  prescribed  in  paediatric  population  as  well  as  the  effect  and  duration  of 
treatment. The results concerning the use of Xagrid specifically are limited. Indeed, the low number of 
patients  in  the  Xagrid  cohort  (15  patients)  limits  the  interpretation  of  the  results.  Consequently,  the 
CHMP agrees with the MAH not to update the approved Product Information with these limited data. 
Safety results  
Overall, 49 patients (71.0%) experienced an AE during the observation period:  
- 34 patients (64.2%) in the “No Treatment/AA Alone” cohort 
- 16 patients (76.2%) in the “Cytoreductive Therapy of whom 11 patients (73.3%) on XAGRID. 
The 100-patient-years exposure rate was 69.2, 74.9, and 69.6, respectively. 
Fourteen patients (20.3%) experienced an AE related to ET disease during the observation period, with 
8  patients  (15.1%)  in  the  “No  Treatment/AA  Alone”  cohort  and  6  patients  (28.6%)  in  the 
“Cytoreductive Therapy of whom 4 patients (26.7%) on XAGRID. The 100-patient-years exposure rate 
was 10.6, 15.0, and 11.3, respectively. 
TEAE 
Globally,  TEAEs  were  mainly  reported  in  SOCs  “Infections  and  infestations”  (22  patients;  31.9%), 
“Nervous  system  disorders”  (17  patients;  24.6%)  and  “Gastrointestinal  disorders”  (15  patients; 
21.7%). 
Most common TEAEs are summarized in the table hereafter. 
Overall, 49 patients (71.0%) experienced an AE during the observation period. The most common AEs 
were  gastroenteritis  (5  patients  [7.2%]  overall),  menorrhagia  (4  patients  [5.8%]  overall),  and 
EMA/791522/2016  
Page 13/23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, epistaxis, dysmenorrhea, and joint dislocation (3 patients [4.3%] 
overall each). All other preferred terms occurred in at most 2 subjects overall.  
In most of the SOCs, incidence was higher in the cytoreductive therapy cohort. Incidence was higher in 
the subcohort of Xagrid treatment in the following SOCs: “Reproductive system and breast disorders”, 
“General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions”  and  “Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue 
disorders”.  This  was  due  to  the  higher  incidence  of  asthenia,  fatigue,  and  pyrexia  (1  patient  each  on 
XAGRID  and  none  on  “No  treatment/AA  Alone”)  and  muscular  weakness  and  pain  in  extremity  (1 
patient each on XAGRID and none on “No treatment/AA Alone”), respectively. Moreover, regarding the 
“Reproductive  system  and  breast  disorders”  SOC,  menorrhagia  (1)  and  dysmenorrhea  (1)  were 
reported with Xagrid. 
Adverse  events  in  the  SOC  “Injury,  poisoning,  and  procedural  complications”  occurred  solely  in 
patients not receiving any treatment. 
No medically significant differences between the treatment groups in incidence of preferred terms were 
observed.

Overall,  1  patient  in  the  “Cytoreductive  Therapy”  cohort  experienced  a  thrombohemorrhagic  event 
during  the  study.  On  24  Nov  2011,  a  17-year-old  female,  treated  with  hydroxycarbamide  for  ET 
disease  from  01  Aug  2011,  the  patient  experienced  the  serious  AE  of  moderate  cerebral  venous 
thrombosis  and  the  nonserious  AE  of  severe  intracranial  venous  sinus  thrombosis.  Both  events  were 
considered  related  to  the  underlying  ET  disease  and  not  related  to  the  ET  treatment.  The  patient 
received heparin and fluindione. The SAE of cerebral venous thrombosis was considered resolved on 11 
Jan  2012;  the  nonserious  AE  of  intracranial  venous  sinus  thrombosis  was  ongoing  at  the  end  of  the 
observation period.  
Related TEAE 
Twelve patients (17.4%) experienced an AE related to ET therapy during the observation period:  
- 6 patients (11.3%) in the “No Treatment/AA Alone” cohort  
- 6 patients (28.6%) in the “Cytoreductive Therapy of whom 4 patient (26.7%) on XAGRID.  
Apart  from  menorrhagia  (experienced  by  3  patients  [4.3%]  overall;  2  patients  (3.8%)  in  the  “No 
treatment/AA Alone” and 1 patient in the “Cytoreductive Therapy” cohort who was on XAGRID [4.8% 
and 6.7%, respectively]), none of the preferred terms occurred in more than 1 subject overall. 
Related TEAE reported in the “Cytoreductive Therapy” were:  
EMA/791522/2016  
Page 15/23 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
- Abdominal pain upper (1 patient, on XAGRID therapy) 
- Menorrhagia (1 patient, on XAGRID therapy) 
- Asthenia and Fatigue (1 patient each; each on XAGRID therapy) 
- Anaemia (1 patient, on XAGRID therapy) 
- Varicella (1 patient; none with Xagrid) 
- Myelofibrosis (1 patient, on XAGRID therapy) 
- Headache (1 patient; none with Xagrid) 
Except  for  menorrhagia,  none  of  these  PTs  were  reported  in  the  “no  treatment/AA  alone”  cohort. 
However, except for menorrhagia, none of the PTs reported in the “no treatment/AA alone” cohort was 
reported in the “cytoreductive therapy” cohort; related TEAEs reported in the “no treatment/AA alone” 
cohort were:  
- Menorrhagia (2 patients) 
- Gingival disorder, Mouth haemorrhage, Nausea (1 each) 
- Injury (1) 
- Decreased appetite (1) 
- Petechiae (1) 
- Haematoma (1) 
No significant safety finding was identified among the related TEAEs reported. 
Severe TEAE 
The majority of patients experienced AEs of mild or moderate intensity:  
-  mild  intensity:  28  patients  [40.6%]  overall;  19  patients  [35.8%]  in  the  “No  Treatment/AA  Alone” 
cohort and 10 patients [47.6%] in the “Cytoreductive Therapy” cohort of whom 7 patients [46.7%] on 
XAGRID; 
-  moderate  intensity:  16  patients  [23.2%]  overall;  13  patients  [24.5%]  in  the  “No  Treatment/AA 
Alone”  cohort  and  3  patients  [14.3%]  in  the  “Cytoreductive  Therapy”  cohort  of  whom  2  patients 
[13.3%] on XAGRID). 
A  total  of  5  patients  (7.2%)  experienced  a  TEAE  of  severe  intensity  (2  patients  [3.8%]  in  the  “No 
Treatment/AA Alone” cohort and 3 patients [14.3%] in the “Cytoreductive Therapy” cohort of whom 2 
patients [13.3%] on XAGRID). The cases are further summarized below:  
-  Serious  severe  myelofibrosis  in  a  17-year-old  female  treated  with  Xagrid;  The  SAE  was  considered 
related to the ET disease and ET treatment and led to a dose reduction.  
- Non-serious severe migraine in a 12-year-old female treated with Xagrid. The AE was considered not 
related to the ET disease or the ET treatment and resolved during the observation period. 
EMA/791522/2016

- Non-serious severe intracranial venous sinus thrombosis and serious severe depression in a 17-year-
old  female  treated  with  “cytoreductive  therapy”.  Both  events  were  considered  related  to  the  ET 
disease. 
- Serious severe atrial septal defect II in a 12-year-old female receiving “No treatment/AA Alone”. The 
SAE was considered not related to the ET disease and resolved during the observation period. 
-  Serious  severe  ascites,  oesophageal  varices  haemorrhage,  haematemesis,  hepatic  failure,  and  non-
serious severe neutropenia in a 17-year-old female receiving “No treatment/AA Alone”. All 5 SAEs were 
considered related to the ET disease and resolved during the observation period. 
No specific safety information was raised though these severe cases. 
Of note, the case of severe depression was mistakenly associated by the MAH to the “no treatment/AA 
Alone” cohort, while it is associated to “cytoreductive treatment” as per the provided listings. 
Serious TEAEs 
Eleven patients (15.9%) experienced an SAE during the observation period:  
- 7 patients (13.2%) in the “No Treatment/AA Alone” cohort 
- 4 patients (19.0%) in the “Cytoreductive Therapy of whom 1 patient (6.7%) on XAGRID.  
The 100-patient-years exposure rate was 8.1, 8.2, and 1.9, respectively. 
There was no fatal AE. 
No patient in any treatment group discontinued treatment due to an AE. 
Apart  from  haematemesis  (experienced  by  2  patients  [2.9%]  overall;  1  patient  (1.9%)  in  the  “No 
Treatment/AA Alone” cohort and 1 patient [4.8%] in the “Cytoreductive Therapy” cohort who was not 
on  XAGRID)  and  myelofibrosis  (experienced  by  2  patients  [2.9%]  overall;  1  patient  (1.9%)  on  “No 
treatment/AA  Alone”  and  1  patient  [6.7%]  each  XAGRID),  none  of  the  preferred  terms  occurred  in 
more than 1 subject overall. 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
A total of 16 patients (32.7%), 4 patients (25.0%), and 3 patients (25.0%) in the “No Treatment/AA 
Alone”,  “Cytoreductive  Therapy”,  and  XAGRID  cohorts,  respectively,  had  a  platelet  count  >1500  x 
109/L  at  the  time  of  diagnosis.  At  baseline,  this  had  already  decreased  to  7  patients  (14.3%),  2 
patients  (12.5%),  and  0  patients,  respectively.  After  22-24  months  of  observation,  the  proportion  of 
patients with platelet count >1500 x 109/L was 2 patients (12.5%), 1 patient (10.0%), and 1 patient 
(14.3%), respectively. At the time of the last data collection (Months 55-57), only 1 patient (25.0%) in 
the “No Treatment/AA Alone” group had a platelet count >1500 x 109/L. 
Hemoglobin levels showed a mild increase over time, which was generally most pronounced in patients 
in the “No Treatment/AA Alone” cohort:  
EMA/791522/2016  
Page 17/23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
- “No Treatment/AA Alone”: from 127.13 (11.178) g/L at diagnosis, to 134.33 (10.109) at baseline and 
141.07 (13.398) after 22-24 months. 
- “Cytoreductive Therapy”: from 121.87 (14.734) g/L at diagnosis, to 122.94 (14.808) at baseline and 
128.42 (17.622) after 22-24 months. 
-  “Xagrid”:  from  122.24  (16.714)  g/L  at  diagnosis,  to  125.42  (15.395)  at  baseline  and  127.53 
(15.619) after 22-24 months. 
Hematocrit showed a mild increase over time, which was generally most pronounced in patients in the 
“No Treatment/AA Alone” cohort.  
Mean corpuscular volume  increased over time, especially in the “Cytoreductive Therapy” and XAGRID 
cohorts.  
Mean  platelet  volume,  at  the  time  of  diagnosis,  was  7.922  (4.3573),  11.357(8.1808),  and  8.125 
(1.7251)  fL  in  the  “No  Treatment/AA  Alone”,  “Cytoreductive  Therapy”,  and  XAGRID  cohorts, 
respectively.  At  baseline,  mean  (SD)  platelet  volume  was  7.984  (1.1784),  8.760  (1.716),  and  9.767 
(1.4364)  fL,  respectively.  Mean  (SD)  distribution  width  was  20.62  (13.652),  10.20  (NA;  data  for  1 
patient  only),  and  10.20%  (NA;  data  for  1  patient  only).  After  22-24  months  of  observation,  mean 
(SD) platelet volume was 8.250 (1.6345), 9.320 (1.6208), and 9.700 (1.9519) fL, respectively. Mean 
(SD)  distribution  width  was  15.40  (0.283),  14.90  (2.828),  and  14.90  (2.828)%,  respectively.  In 
addition,  mean  platelet  count  showed  a  decrease  over  time  in  the  “Cytoreductive  Therapy”  and 
XAGRID cohorts; see efficacy section for additional details. 
Blasts were not present in the blood of any of the patients during the observation period. Apart from 1 
patient  on  XAGRID  (Month  52-54),  the  blast/leukocyte  fraction  was  0  for  all  patients  throughout  the 
observation period. 
Bilirubin increased over time in both cohorts, including in the subgroup of Xagrid.  
Alkaline phosphatase decreased over time in the “No Treatment/AA Alone” and XAGRID cohorts.  
Aspartate aminotransferase also showed a decrease over time, which was most pronounced in patients 
on XAGRID.  
Alanine  aminotransferase  showed  a  slight  increase  in  the  “No  Treatment/AA  Alone”  cohort  and 
remained fairly stable in the “Cytoreductive Therapy” and XAGRID cohorts.  
Creatinine  increased  over  time  in  both  cohorts,  including  in  the  Xagrid  sub-group.  The  increase  was 
most pronounced in the “Cytoreductive Therapy” and XAGRID cohorts.  
Gamma glutamyltransferase decreased over time in the “Cytoreductive Therapy” and XAGRID cohorts 
and increased in the “No Treatment/AA Alone” cohort.  
Lactate  dehydrogenase  decreased  over  time  in  the  “Cytoreductive  Therapy”  and  XAGRID  cohorts  and 
remained fairly stable in the “No Treatment/AA Alone” cohort.  
Mean  changes  from  baseline  in  other  laboratory  parameters  were  generally  small  and  none  were 
considered clinically relevant. 
CHMP assessment comment 
According to the MAH, mean platelet volume and distribution width decreased over time in patients in 
the “Cytoreductive Therapy” and XAGRID cohorts. However, it should be noted that increase in mean 
EMA/791522/2016  
Page 18/23 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
platelet volume was noted in the Xagrid group. Moreover, data on platelet distribution width were only 
available in 2 patients in “cytoreductive therapy” cohort (and 1 to 2 patients in Xagrid, depending on 
time of examination), making data very limited for further conclusion.  
Similarly, PAL results should be considered limited in the “cytoreductive treatment” cohort, considering 
the low number of patients. 
Bilirubine  increased  in  both  cohorts,  including  with  Xagrid.  No  signal  was  raised  regarding  ASAT  and 
ALAT.  Increase  in  creatinine  with  observed  in  both  cohorts,  including  with  Xagrid.  Of  note,  creatinine 
increase is listed in the SmPC for Xagrid. 
Gamma-GT  and  LDH  decreased  in  cytoreductive  therapy  cohort,  including  Xagrid,  while  gamma-GT 
increased in the “no treatment/AA alone” arm and LDH remained stable in this arm. 
No specific safety signal was identified in the clinical laboratory results. 
Vital Signs 
The incidence of abnormalities for pulse, SBP, and DBP was limited throughout the observation period. 
One  patient  on  “No  Treatment/AA  Alone”  experienced  the  nonserious  AE  of  mild  hypertension, 
considered  not  related to ET  disease  or  ET  treatment  and  was  ongoing  at  the  end  of  the  observation 
period. No other AEs related to vital signs abnormalities occurred. 
BMI  tended  to  increase  over  time,  with  a  decrease  in  underweight  patients  tending  to  BMI 
normalization and increase in obese patients.  
No  clinically  significant  abnormalities  in  ECG  and  echocardiogram  and  no  AEs  related  to  ECG  and 
echocardiogram occurred during the observation period. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In 2007 the Paediatric Regulation came into force in the EU with the objective to improve the health of 
children  in  Europe  by  facilitating  the  development  and  availability  of  medicines  for  children.  The 
Regulation  introduced  obligations  and  incentives  for  research  into  new  and  existing  drugs  and 
introduced  the  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (PIP)  which  needs  to  be  agreed  with  the  EMA  Paediatric 
Committee (PDCO). The need for such research for XAGRID was discussed extensively with the PDCO; 
EMA/791522/2016  
Page 19/23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
a briefing document along with the study proposal was submitted and reviewed by the PDCO between 
August 2009 and April 2010. 
In April 2010, the MAH agreed with the PDCO to conduct a disease registry study (study SPD422-404) 
to investigate disease progression, symptoms, and  treatment effects on platelet count, to summarize 
drug utilization of cytoreductive therapies, to summarize long term assessment of disease progression, 
and to summarize safety of cytoreductive therapies in a population of paediatric subjects. 
Efficacy discussion: 
A  total  of  69  patients  were  enrolled  and  64  had  follow-up  data.  The  majority  of  patients  (N=53/64) 
who  started  the  study  were  not  taking  any  cytoreductive  therapy.  Five  of  these  patients  (9.4%) 
switched to cytoreductive therapy at some point during the observation period. 
Two  out  of  these  5  patients  switched  to  XAGRID  specifically.  Twenty-one  patients  (including  the 
aforementioned  5  switched  patients  who  started  the  study  on  “No  treatment/AA  Alone”)  took 
cytoreductive  therapy  during  the  observation  period.  Fifteen  out  of  these  21  patients  took  XAGRID. 
Note  that  patients  starting  cytoreductive  therapy  during  the  study  were  included  in  the  “No 
Treatment/AA  Alone”  cohort  up  until  the  time  of  first  dose.  After  first  dose  of  cytoreductive  therapy, 
patients were included in “Cytoreductive Therapy” cohort (and the XAGRID cohort when applicable). 
A total of 15 patients (21.7%), of whom 13 (24.5%) in the “No Treatment/AA Alone” cohort, 2 (9.5%) 
in  the  “Cytoreductive  Therapy”  cohort,  and  2  (13.3%)  in  the  XAGRID  cohort  did  not  complete  the 
study.  The  reasons  for  discontinuation  included  patients  lost  to  follow-up  (N=9  patients  overall), 
reasons listed as other (N=5 patients overall), and withdrawal by patient (N=1 patient overall). 
The  mean  (SD)  duration  of  observation  was  1106.2  (489.02)  days  in  the  “No  Treatment/AA  Alone” 
cohort, 1277.1 (327.23) days in the “Cytoreductive Therapy” cohort and 1293.9 (332.36) days in the 
XAGRID cohort (1249.1 [410.46] days overall). 
Overall,  the  majority  of  patients  were  female  (59.4%)  and  White  (75.4%).  The  mean  (SD)  age  was 
12.4 (3.26) years. Demographic data were well balanced between the different cohorts. 
A  total  of  21  patients  (30.4%)  took  cytoreductive  therapy  during  the  study.  Most  of  these  patients 
(N=18) took 1 cytoreductive; 3 patients took 2 cytoreductives. Anagrelide (XAGRID)  was  used by 15 
patients  (21.7%)  at  a  median  dose  of  1.0  mg  for  a  median  of  1253  days  (20.5%  of  total  patient 
years). 
Patients  were  treated  with  XAGRID  in  low  doses  (median  dose  of  0.028  mg/kg  [based  on  the  first 
weight measurement] or 0.019 mg/kg [based on the last weight measurement). 
Additional  results  indicate that  cytoreductive  therapy  (and  XAGRID  more  specifically)  was  effective  in 
reducing platelet count. Mean (SD) platelet count at Month 55-57 was higher compared with baseline 
in the “No Treatment/AA Alone” cohort (1067.3 [699.57] x 109/L) and lower compared with baseline in 
the  “Cytoreductive  Therapy”  (364.0  [284.26]  x  109/L)  and  XAGRID  (364.0  [284.26]  x  109/L). 
Furthermore, no thrombohemorrhagic events or occurred in patients treated with XAGRID. One patient 
in the XAGRID cohort developed myelofibrosis. 
Safety discussion:  
Overall, 49 patients (71.0%) experienced an AE during the observation period.  
Eleven  patients  (15.9%)  experienced  a  serious  AE,  including  4  in  the  “cytoreductive  therapy”  cohort 
(19.0%)  whom  1  on  Xagrid.  No  SAE  had  a  fatal  outcome.  No  AE  led  to  treatment  discontinuation.

Apart  from  haematemesis  (2  patients  overall,  none  on  Xagrid)  and  myelofibrosis  (2  patients  whom 1 
on Xagrid), none of the PTs occurred in more than 1 subject overall. 
One serious, severe and related case of MF was reported in a 17-years-odl female patient on Xagrid. 
The  most  common  AEs  were  gastroenteritis  (5  patients  [7.2%]  overall),  menorrhagia  (4  patients 
[5.8%] overall), dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, epistaxis, dysmenorrhea, and joint dislocation (3 
patients  [4.3%]  overall  each).  No  medically  significant  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  in 
incidence of PTs were observed. 
The  incidence  of  AEs  in  the  SOCs  “General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions”  and 
“Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders was higher in the XAGRID cohort compared with the 
“No Treatment/AA Alone” cohort. This was due to the higher incidence of asthenia, fatigue, and pyrexia 
(1 patient each on XAGRID and none on “No treatment/AA alone”) and muscular weakness and pain in 
extremity (1 patient each on XAGRID and none on “No treatment/AA alone”), respectively. 
Twelve  AEs  were  assessed  as  treatment  related,  including  6  in  the  “cytoreductive  therapy”  cohort 
whom  4  patients  on  Xagrid.  Apart  from  menorrhagia  (experienced  by  3  patients  [4.3%]  overall;  2 
patients  (3.8%)  in  the  “No  treatment/AA  Alone”  and  1  patient  each  in  the  “Cytoreductive  Therapy” 
cohort who was on XAGRID [4.8% and 6.7%, respectively]), none of the preferred terms occurred in 
more than 1 subject overall. 
The majority of patients experienced AEs of mild (28 patients [40.6%] overall; 19 patients [35.8%] in 
the “No Treatment/AA Alone” cohort and 10 patients [47.6%] in the “Cytoreductive Therapy” cohort of 
whom 7 patients [46.7%] on XAGRID) or moderate intensity (16 patients [23.2%] overall; 13 patients 
[24.5%] in the “No Treatment/AA Alone” cohort and 3 patients [14.3%] in the “Cytoreductive Therapy” 
cohort  of  whom  2  patients  [13.3%]  on  XAGRID).  A  total  of  5 patients  (7.2%)  experienced  a  TEAE  of 
severe intensity (2 patients [3.8%] in the “No Treatment/AA Alone” cohort and 3 patients [14.3%] in 
the “Cytoreductive Therapy” cohort of whom 2 patients [13.3%] on XAGRID). 
Changes in clinical laboratory parameters in the different cohorts were consistent with what might be 
expected  in  pediatric  patients  with  ET  receiving  “No  Treatment/AA  Alone”  or  cytoreductive  treatment 
(XAGRID  or  other  cytoreductive  treatment).  Lactate  dehydrogenase  decreased  over  time  in  the 
“Cytoreductive  Therapy”  and  XAGRID  cohorts  and  remained  fairly  stable  in  the  “No  Treatment/AA 
Alone” cohort. 
No clinically relevant observations were made related to vital signs or ECG. 
Based  on  these  data,  no  new  safety  signal  nor  unexpected  trend  was  identified  with  Xagrid  in  the 
paediatric population, from 6 to 17 years. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
In April 2010, the MAH agreed with the PDCO to conduct a disease registry study (study SPD422-404) 
to investigate disease progression, symptoms, and  treatment effects on platelet count, to summarize 
drug utilization of cytoreductive therapies, to summarize long term assessment of disease progression, 
and to summarize safety of cytoreductive therapies in a population of paediatric subjects. 
Efficacy discussion: 
A  total  of  69  patients  were  enrolled  and  64  had  follow-up  data.  The  majority  of  patients  (N=53/64) 
who  started  the  study  were  not  taking  any  cytoreductive  therapy.  Five  of  these  patients  (9.4%) 
switched to cytoreductive therapy at some point during the observation period. 
EMA/791522/2016

A  total  of  fifteen  out  of  these  21  patients  took  XAGRID.  Note  that  patients  starting  cytoreductive 
therapy during the study were included in the “No Treatment/AA Alone” cohort up until the time of first 
dose.  After  first  dose  of  cytoreductive  therapy,  patients  were  included  in  “Cytoreductive  Therapy” 
cohort (and the XAGRID cohort when applicable). 
The  mean  (SD)  duration  of  observation  was  1106.2  (489.02)  days  in  the  “No  Treatment/AA  Alone” 
cohort, 1277.1 (327.23) days in the “Cytoreductive Therapy” cohort and 1293.9 (332.36) days in the 
XAGRID cohort (1249.1 [410.46] days overall). 
Overall,  the  majority  of  patients  were  female  (59.4%)  and  White  (75.4%).  The  mean  (SD)  age  was 
12.4 (3.26) years. Demographic data were well balanced between the different cohorts. 
A  total  of  21  patients  (30.4%)  took  cytoreductive  therapy  during  the  study.  Most  of  these  patients 
(N=18) took 1 cytoreductive; 3 patients took 2 cytoreductives. Anagrelide (XAGRID)  was  used by 15 
patients  (21.7%)  at  a  median  dose  of  1.0  mg  for  a  median  of  1253  days  (20.5%  of  total  patient 
years). 
Additional  results  indicate that  cytoreductive  therapy  (and  XAGRID  more  specifically)  was  effective  in 
reducing platelet count. Mean (SD) platelet count at Month 55-57 was higher compared with baseline 
in the “No Treatment/AA Alone” cohort (1067.3 [699.57] x 109/L) and lower compared with baseline in 
the “Cytoreductive Therapy” (364.0 [284.26] x 109/L) and XAGRID (364.0 [284.26] x 109/L).  
One patient in the XAGRID cohort developed myelofibrosis. 
Safety discussion:  
Overall, 49 patients (71.0%) experienced an AE during the observation period, including 11 with SAE 
(15.9%). None had a fatal outcome and no AE led to treatment discontinuation.  
One serious, severe and related case of MF was reported in a 17-years-old female patient on Xagrid. 
The  incidence  of  AEs  in  the  SOCs  “General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions”  and 
“Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders”  was  higher  in  the  XAGRID  cohort,  mainly  due  to 
cases  of  asthenia,  fatigue,  and  pyrexia,  and  muscular  weakness  and  pain  in  extremity  only  reported 
with Xagrid. 
Twelve  AEs  were  assessed  as  treatment  related,  including  6  in  the  “cytoreductive  therapy”  cohort 
whom 4 patients on Xagrid. No safety signal was raised. 
Overall,  the  majority  of  patients  experienced  AEs  of  mild  or  moderate  intensity.  A  total  of  5  patients 
(7.2%)  experienced  a  TEAE  of  severe  intensity  (2  patients  [3.8%]  in  the  “No  Treatment/AA  Alone” 
cohort and 3 patients [14.3%] in the “Cytoreductive Therapy” cohort of whom 2 patients [13.3%] on 
XAGRID). 
Changes  in  clinical  laboratory  results  did  not  raise  safety  signal.  No  clinically  relevant  observations 
were made related to vital signs or ECG. 
Based  on  these  data,  no  new  safety  signal  or  unexpected  trend  was  identified  with  Xagrid  in  the 
paediatric population, from 6 to 17 years.

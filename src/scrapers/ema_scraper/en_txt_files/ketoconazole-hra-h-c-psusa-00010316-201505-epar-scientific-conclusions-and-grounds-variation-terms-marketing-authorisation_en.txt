Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for ketoconazole (centrally 
authorised product only), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 enzyme. Pharmacokinetics of medicines that are 
substrates of CYP3A4 can be affected when administered concomitantly with ketoconazole, 
potentially leading to clinically significant serious Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) and/or the need 
for dose adjustment of these medicinal products. PRAC considers that, in view of the available data 
the interaction of ketoconazole with CYP3A4 substrates should be added to the product information. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR(s), the PRAC considered that 
changes to the product information of medicinal products containing ketoconazole were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ketoconazole (centrally authorised product only) the 
CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing 
ketoconazole (centrally authorised product only) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to 
the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), the oral prodrug of tenofovir, is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase 
inhibitor (NtRTI).  After absorption, tenofovir DF is rapidly converted to tenofovir, which is metabolized 
intracellularly to the active metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir has an in vitro antiviral activity 
against retroviruses and hepadnaviruses by inhibiting the reverse transcriptase enzyme hence, by DNA 
chain termination. Because tenofovir was not well absorbed from the intestine, the prodrug, tenofovir 
disoproxil, was developed to increase the bioavailability. 
Viread was first approved in EU for the treatment of HIV-infected adults in February 2002. Viread was 
then approved in EU for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in adults in April 2008. Tenofovir is 
also a component of the fixed-dose combination tablets Truvada (emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir DF 
300 mg tablet), Atripla (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir DF 300 mg tablet) and 
Eviplera (emtricitabine / rilpivirine hydrochloride / tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), which are indicated 
for treatment of HIV-1 infection. In 2010, the indications for Viread were extended to include patients 
with hepatitis B with decompensated liver disease. Recently, Viread received authorization for use in 
HIV-infected children from 2 years of age with NRTI resistance or toxicities precluding the use of first 
line agents and in HBV-infected adolescents 12 to <18 years of age with compensated liver disease 
and evidence of active immune disease (Commission Decision 22/11/2012). 
The indication for Viread in CHB in adults was based primarily on data from 266 adult subjects with 
hepatitis B early antigen positive (HBeAg+) compensated CHB and 375 subjects with hepatitis B early 
antigen negative (HBeAg−) compensated CHB who enrolled in the similarly designed pivotal studies 
GS-US-174-0102 (HBeAg− subjects) and GS-US-174-0103 (HBeAg+ subjects). In those studies, a 
limited number of nucleoside-experienced patients (mainly with prior LAM experience) were included. 
In a pooled analysis of these 2 studies, there were no differences in efficacy response for LAM-
experienced (N = 75) compared to LAM-naive subjects (N = 566) after up to 5 years of TDF therapy. 
Benefit of treatment with TDF has also been observed in 13 patients with LAM-R at baseline in study 
GS-US-174-0106 that evaluate the efficacy and safety of TDF versus FTC/TDF combination therapy in 
ADV-refractory patients with or without previous LAM usage.  
The purpose of the current submission is to seek a new indication for Viread 245 mg film-coated 
tablets for the treatment of subjects with lamivudine-resistant (LAM-R) CHB. Accordingly, efficacy, 
safety, and resistance data in LAM-R subjects with CHB treated with TDF or FTC/TDF are provided. 
In addition and in partial fulfilment of follow-up measure (FUM) 234, pharmacokinetic (PK) data are 
provided for a subset of subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 50 to 80 
mL/min) treated with TDF. 
Rationale for the study 
The development of nucleos(t)ide analogues has been a major breakthrough for the treatment of CHB, 
providing effective suppression of viral replication and reducing the risk of long term complications. 
However, a major limitation of nucleos(t)ide analogues is the selection of HBV resistance variants 
which can lead to treatment failure and progression to liver disease. The rate of resistance 
development in treatment-naive patients varies depending on the treatment: up to 80% after 5 years 
with lamivudine (LAM), up to 29% after 5 years with adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), 40%/20% in hepatitis B 
e antigen positive/negative (hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg]+/-) patients after 4 years with telbivudine 
Viread 
Assessment report

(LdT), and 1.2% after 6 years with entecavir (ETV) in naïve patients. To date, resistance to TDF has 
not been documented. 
Thus, the issue of resistance has been considerably weakened with the availability of potent agents 
with high genetic barrier for resistance, namely entecavir and tenofovir. However, there is an 
important number of patients who have experienced failure to antiviral therapy, mostly to LAM or ADV 
that poses problems for antiviral treatment. When resistance develops during treatment of CHB with a 
nucleos(t)ide analogue, a rescue therapy with the most effective antiviral effect and without cross-
resistance is recommended. 
In vitro, the ADV-R mutations rtA181V and/or rtN236T confer low level cross resistance to tenofovir 
(TFV), while the LAM-R mutations rtL180M and/or rtM204V remain sensitive to TFV. Additionally, the 
ADV/ LAM-R mutation rtA181T remains sensitive to TFV.  
There is currently no clear consensus as regards the management of patients with lamivudine 
resistance and recommendation varies according to therapeutic guidelines. 
While the EASL guideline (2009) previously recommended the addition of tenofovir (or adefovir if 
tenofovir was not available) in patients with lamivudine resistance, the updated guideline (2012) now 
recommends to switch to tenofovir (or add adefovir if tenofovir is not available) since “most of the 
experts based on current evidence suggest that switching to tenofovir is as effective as adding 
tenofovir to lamivudine”. For patients with LAM-R, the current practice guidelines from the American 
Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommend the addition of TDF or ADV, while 
maintaining LAM therapy (or telbivudine) to decrease the risk of subsequent antiviral resistance.  
Of note, as regards the management of patients with ADV resistance who had prior LAM experience, 
EU and US guideline are in line. The EASL guideline recommends a switch to tenofovir and to add a 
nucleoside analogue. Similarly, in US it is recommended that ADV may be stopped and TDF+LAM, 
TDF+FTC, or TDF+ETV may be used (durability of response is however unknown). 
No large, prospectively-designed clinical study has previously been conducted to establish whether TDF 
combination therapy (TDF+LAM or TDF+FTC) is the appropriate treatment for LAM-R patients, or 
conversely, if TDF monotherapy would be equally effective. However, as discussed above, some limited 
data suggest that TDF monotherapy may be equally effective in the treatment of LAM-R patients. 
The MAH is conducting study GS-US-174-0121 to compare the efficacy and safety of TDF monotherapy 
compared with FTC/TDF combination therapy in the treatment of subjects with CHB who, at the time of 
screening, were receiving LAM and who had documented LAM-R mutations (rtM204V/I with or without 
rtL180M). A total of 240 weeks of blinded treatment are planned; the report provided in this 
submission summarizes the results through Week 96. 
1.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
1.2.1.  Introduction 
Non-clinical safety pharmacology studies reveal no special hazard for humans. Findings in repeated 
dose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys at exposure levels greater than or equal to clinical 
exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use include renal and bone toxicity and a 
decrease in serum phosphate concentration. Bone toxicity was diagnosed as osteomalacia (monkeys) 
and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) (rats and dogs). The bone toxicity in young adult rats and 
dogs occurred at exposures ≥ 5-fold the exposure in paediatric or adult patients; bone toxicity

occurred in juvenile infected monkeys at very high exposures following subcutaneous dosing (≥ 40-fold 
the exposure in patients). Findings in the rat and monkey studies indicated that there was a 
substance-related decrease in intestinal absorption of phosphate with potential secondary reduction in 
BMD. 
1.2.2.  Pharmacology 
No additional pharmacology data has been submitted. 
1.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No additional pharmacokinetics data has been submitted. 
1.2.4.  Toxicology 
No additional toxicology data has been submitted. 
1.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No update of the ERA has been provided in the current submission. The MAH submitted the ERA 
previously provided in the setting of the extension of indication to HIV and HBV-infected paediatric 
patients (dated October 2011). Main data are summarized below:

1.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No update of the ERA has been provided in the current submission.  
The MAH does not give any justification with regards to the new submission as results of the extension 
of the indication in patients with LAM-R that may result in an increase in environmental exposure. 
However, this is unlikely to have significant impact given the PEC remains the same by utilization of 
the default value of Fpen (1%) and in addition the PEC/PNEC ratio is very low (2.5.10-6 to 7.8 x10-4). 
More importantly, the MAH submitted an updated ERA for the active ingredient TDF during the MAA of 
Strilbild (Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir) that lead to identify significant limitations to 
the Viread ERA. Questions have been raised to this purpose. Hence, those questions also apply to this 
procedure: 
-   With  respect  to  the  ERA  for  tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate  (TDF),  it  is  acknowledged  that  an 
attempt  has  been  made  to  clarify  the  identification  of  the  unknown  transformation  products 
at  >10%.    The  applicant  suggests  that  the  transformation  product  at  12  min  is  potentially 
tenofovir  monoester  [mono(POC)-PMPA].  Pursuant  to  the  bioconversion  pathway  for  TDF  this 
transformation  product  is  formed  before  TFV  (=R-PMPA)  was  generated.    However,  according  to 
Table 9 of the study report (OECD 308; total system, Taunton River) the 12 min peak was formed 
after  the  TFV  disappeared.    As  the  actual  findings  are  not  in  line  with  the  pathway  proposed 
originally,  the  potential  persistent  transformation  product  or  peak  at  12  min  (HPLC)  should  be 
formally identified. 
-  
The  MAH  has  indicated  that  aquatic  toxicity  studies  conducted  with  TDF  produced  higher 
exposures to tenofovir than that achieved if studies were conducted with tenofovir alone and that 
further studies with tenofovir are not required.  However, it is noted that tenofovir was observed 
as a transformation product after a significant proportion of the TDF partitioned into the sediment 
and  tenofovir,  which  is  a  polar  dianion,  would  be  expected  to  have  a  longer  half-life  in  water.  
Hence, it is maintained that the MAH should provide a tailored environmental risk assessment for 
tenofovir  with  fate  studies  including  the  adsorption/desorption  study,  transformation  studies  in 
aquatic  systems  (OECD  308)  and  the  Early-Life  Stage  Toxicity  Test  (OECD  210).    Furthermore, 
additional  studies  performed  in  accordance  with  OECD  308  would  facilitate  the  identification  of 
unknown  transformation  products,  e.g.  the  12  min  peak  and  would  help  to  identify  the  study 
duration that allows derivation of reliable half-lives. The MAH should ensure that all transformation 
products ≥10% are identified and that the half-lives are calculated. 
In its response to CHMP, the MAH agrees to conduct a tailored environmental risk assessment for 
tenofovir, including an adsorption/desorption study (OECD 106), transformation studies in aquatic 
sediment  systems  (OECD  308)  and  an  early-life  stage  toxicity  test  (OECD  210).  Additionally, 
transformation products ≥ 10% will be fully characterized. 
1.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation to be addressed: 
-   With respect to the ERA for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, it is acknowledged that an attempt has 
been made to clarify the identification of the unknown transformation products at >10%.  The 
applicant suggests that the transformation product at 12 min is potentially tenofovir monoester 
[mono(POC)-PMPA]. Pursuant to the bioconversion pathway for TDF this transformation product is 
formed before TFV (=R-PMPA) was generated.  However, according to the study report (OECD 
308; total system, Taunton River) the 12 min peak was formed after the TFV disappeared.  As the 
actual findings are not in line with the pathway proposed originally, the potential persistent 
transformation product or peak at 12 min (HPLC) should be formally identified. 
-   The MAH should provide a tailored environmental risk assessment for tenofovir with fate studies 
including the adsorption/desorption study, transformation studies in aquatic systems (OECD 308) 
and the Early-Life Stage Toxicity Test (OECD 210).  Furthermore, additional studies performed in 
Viread 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/143539/2013 
Page 7/69 
 
 
 
accordance with OECD 308 would facilitate the identification of unknown transformation products, 
e.g. the 12 min peak and would help to identify the study duration that allows derivation of 
reliable half-lives.  The applicant should ensure that all transformation products ≥10% are 
identified and that the half-lives are calculated. 
The MAH proposes to submit the study reports by the end of Q2 2015. 
The CHMP also considers the following additional measure necessary to address the non- clinical 
issues: 
Within the context of a future variation, to include a statement in Section 5.3 of the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) for all pharmaceutical forms and strengths of Viread, as follows: 
“The  active  ingredient  tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate  and  its  main  transformation  products  are 
persistent in the environment”. 
Overall, there are no non-clinical objections to the approval of this application.  
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
The clinical documentation submitted by the MAH consists of one ongoing, long-term (240-week), 
Phase 3b clinical study GS-US-174-0121.  
This study consists of TDF monotherapy or FTC/TDF combination therapy for the treatment of CHB in 
subjects who, at the time of screening, were receiving LAM and who had documented LAM-R mutations 
(rtM204V/I with or without rtL180M). In addition, PK profiles of TDF in subjects with mild (CLcr 50 to 
80 mL/min) renal impairment have been examined in Study GS-US-174-0121.

and Tolerability of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (DF) Monotherapy Versus Emtricitabine plus Tenofovir 
DF Fixed-Dose Combination Therapy in Subjects with Chronic Hepatitis B who are Resistant to 
Lamivudine 
Methods 
Study GS-US-174-0121 is an ongoing Phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 240-week 
study comparing the antiviral efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TDF versus the fixed-dose combination 
of FTC/TDF for the treatment of CHB infection in LAM-R subjects. Eligible subjects had to be currently 
receiving LAM and have genotypic evidence of LAM resistance (confirmed LAM-R associated 
mutation[s] [rtM204V/I ± rtL180M] in the HBV polymerase/reverse transcriptase [pol/RT] gene, and 
an HBV DNA level of ≥ 3 log10 IU/mL at screening.  
Randomization was stratified by hepatitis B early antigen (HBeAg) status (negative or positive) and 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level (≥ 2 × upper limit of normal range [ULN] or < 2 × ULN) at 
screening.

Study participants 
The study enrolled adult subjects (18 to 75 years of age) with CHB infection (HBsAg+ for at least 6 
months), HBeAg+ or HBeAg− status, and HBV DNA ≥ 3 log10 IU/mL at screening. Subjects were 
required to have CLcr ≥ 50 mL/min, ALT < 10 × the upper limit of the normal range (ULN), and no 
evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Subjects must not have had serological evidence of co-infection 
with hepatitis C virus, HIV, or hepatitis D virus. Subjects with decompensated liver disease, or who 
were pregnant or breastfeeding, were excluded from the study. 
Eligible subjects had to be currently receiving LAM at screening, with confirmation of HBV pol/RT 
mutation(s) known to confer resistance to LAM (rtM204I/V ± rtL180M) by central laboratory 
assessment prior to randomization. Prior or current ADV treatment of ≤ 48 weeks (inclusive of 
ADV+LAM combination therapy) at screening was allowed. Previous treatment with interferon must 
have ended at least 6 months prior to screening. 
The study includes 62 centres in North America (United States and Canada), Europe (Austria, Bulgaria, 
Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Spain, and Turkey), and New 
Zealand.

Among secondary efficacy endpoints analyzed at Week 96: HBV DNA < 169 copies/mL (29 IU/mL); 
HBV DNA level and change from baseline; Normal ALT (≤ ULN) and normalized ALT; Virologic 
breakthrough; HBeAg loss and seroconversion; HBsAg loss and seroconversion; Genotypic evidence of 
TDF resistance mutation(s) development 
Pharmacokinetics 
Plasma samples were collected from subjects in the PK substudy at 0 (predose), 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours 
postdose at a single clinic visit occurring at Week 4 or anytime thereafter. Subjects were instructed to 
take their daily dose of study drug at the same time as the 0 hour PK sample for at least 2 days prior 
to the visit. 
Safety 
Adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, and vital signs were evaluated at each study visit. Hip and 
spine bone mineral density (BMD) was measured via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA scan) at 
baseline and Weeks 24, 48, 72, and 96 (only required at sites capable of DEXA scans). 
Sample size 
A 2-sided large-sample normal approximation test of proportions with 125 subjects per treatment 
group would have had at least 80% power to detect a difference of 20% between the groups, 
assuming response rates of 50% and 70% in the TDF and FTC/TDF groups, respectively. 
Viread 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/143539/2013 
Page 11/69 
 
 
The actual number of subjects enrolled into this study was 280, which was 30 subjects over the 
planned enrolment limit. With this increase in the sample size, the study had at least 90% power to 
detect a difference of 20% between the groups, assuming response rates of 50% and 70% in the TDF 
and FTC/TDF groups, respectively. 
Randomisation 
Two hundred and eighty subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive TDF plus FTC/TDF placebo 
once daily or FTC/TDF plus TDF placebo once daily. 
Randomization was stratified by HBeAg status (negative or positive) and alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) level (≥ 2 × ULN or < 2 × ULN) at screening. 
A centralized randomization procedure was used whereby numbered kits containing bottles of study 
drug were assigned to subjects via an interactive voice response system according to the 
randomization code 
This was a double-blind, double-dummy study. Subjects were assigned a subject number at the time of 
randomization. All pre-baseline and baseline tests and procedures were completed prior to the receipt 
of the first dose of study drug. Initiation of treatment with study medication took place on the day of 
the baseline visit. 
Statistical methods 
Analyses of efficacy  
The primary efficacy analysis of the number and percentage of subjects achieving HBV DNA < 400 
copies/mL at Week 96 was performed after the last subject reached Week 96. The difference between 
the TDF and FTC/TDF treatment groups was evaluated using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, 
controlling for randomization strata, on the FAS with missing = failure (M=F) approach. A supportive 
analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was conducted using FAS, excluding missing data (missing = 
excluded [M=E]). 
The endpoint of HBV DNA < 169 copies/mL was analyzed using the same approach as for the primary 
efficacy endpoint. Both an M=E and an M=F approach was used for analyses of the following secondary 
categorical endpoints:  HBV DNA < 169 copies/mL, ALT normal, and ALT normalized. An M=F approach 
was used for HBeAg/HBsAg loss and seroconversion endpoints. 
The primary analysis set used for the safety analyses (safety analysis set) included all randomized 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug, and included all data collected during the course 
of the study (on-treatment and during treatment-free follow-up). The safety analysis set and a 
modified safety analysis set, including all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
drug and who did not have a DEXA baseline assessment violation, were used for the BMD analyses. 
Tests of homogeneity across treatment groups (TDF vs FTC/TDF) were performed for each 
demographic and baseline characteristic. A chi-square test was used for categorical variables, and a 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for continuous variables. 
Protocol amendments 
The original study protocol was amended 4 times; the first two amendments occurred prior to the start 
of the study.  The HBV DNA entry threshold was reduced from 105 copies/mL to 104 copies/mL to 
Viread 
Assessment report

Page 12/69 
 
 
 
 
 
reflect the current standard of treatment for either switching or adding on to therapy in patients with 
resistance to current anti-HBV therapy. 
During the double-blind treatment phase and two additional changes to the protocol were done:  
- 
A third amendment was done where the entry criteria for the lower threshold of HBV DNA was 
changed again from ≥ 4 log10 copies/mL to ≥ 3 log10 IU/mL, as current treatment practices 
were such that this cutoff was used more often in a clinical setting to guide treatment change. 
In addition, exclusion criteria relating to laboratory values used to define hepatic 
decompensation were made less stringent to permit enrollment of compensated cirrhotics. 
- 
Analysis of the primary endpoint was modified to occur at Week 96 and was not to be 
conducted using group sequential testing annually (ie, every 48 weeks) beginning after the last 
subject reached Week 48. A Week 48 group sequential analysis was not conducted in lieu of 
the change in endpoint 
Results 
Participant flow 
Due to a high screen failure rate and the large number of investigational sites participating in the trial, 
a total of 752 subjects were screened to finally enrol the planned sample size (250 subjects). 280 
subjects were finally randomized and treated (141 subjects received TDF once daily [TDF group], and 
139 subjects received FTC/TDF once daily [FTC/TDF group]). 
A total of 258 subjects (94.3% of subjects [133/141] in the TDF group and 89.9% of subjects 
[125/139] in the FTC/TDF group) completed the study through Week 96. 
Twenty-two subjects discontinued the study prior to completing 96 weeks of study treatment. Of 
these, 5 subjects discontinued due to safety, tolerability, and efficacy reasons at or before Week 96 (1 
subject in the TDF group and 3 subjects in the FTC/TDF group experienced an AE leading to 
discontinuation. Two of these subjects subsequently died).

Table 3.  GS-US-174-0121: Disposition of Subjects (Full Analysis Set)  
Over 80% of screen failures were due to either lack of documented LAM-R and/or not receiving current 
treatment with LAM, or were due to having an insufficient HBV DNA level. By establishing these strict 
criteria for Study 121, it was the purpose to ensure that the population of subjects included in this 
study was highly reflective of the population of patients with LAM-R in clinical practice.

Recruitment 
Conduct of the study 
A total of 120 of 280 subjects (42.9%) had a least one important protocol deviation during the study 
(Table 8-3). A higher rate of subjects in the FTC/TDF group (48.9%) than in the TDF group (36.9%) 
had at least one important protocol deviation. 
Table 4.  GS-US-174-0121: Important protocol deviations (Safety Analysis Set)  
A total of 56 of 280 subjects (20.0%) were enrolled despite violation of at least one inclusion criterion. 
Inclusion criteria deviations included the following: 2 subjects were enrolled and randomized to the 
TDF group in the absence of LAM-R and for this reason these subjects were discontinued from the 
study. Subject 1069-4082 was then confirmed to have the mutation M204I at baseline. Three subjects 
(1 randomized to TDF, 2 subjects randomized to FTC/TDF) were enrolled with HBV DNA < 1000 IU/mL 
at screening. One subject randomized to FTC/TDF was enrolled with a platelet count and an albumin 
value lower than defined in the inclusion criteria. A total of 17 subjects (8 in the TDF group and 9 in 
the FTC/TDF group) were enrolled under Protocol Amendment 3 which had not yet been approved by 
the IRB at the time of their enrolment. This deviation occurred across 11 study sites. Deviations from 
management of previous and current HBV treatment included the following: 31 subjects (14 in the TDF 
group and 17 in the FTC/TDF group) did not meet the inclusion criteria regarding previous allowed 
anti-HBV treatment. Additionally, 4 subjects stopped LAM at an inappropriate time (2 subjects

randomized to TDF and 2 to FTC/TDF discontinued treatment with LAM before baseline; the remaining 
subject randomized to FTC/TDF continued treatment after baseline for approximately 4 weeks). 
Baseline data 
Demographics and baseline characteristics 
Overall, demographics and baseline characteristics were similar between the TDF and FTC/TDF 
treatment groups. Subjects were predominantly were predominantly male (75.4%), with a mean age 
of 46.7 years (range of 18 to 73 years), and were white (61.4%) or Asian (33.6%). Overall, mean 
(standard deviation [SD]) years positive for HBV was 10.8 (7.73) years. The majority of subjects were 
enrolled at sites in Europe (60.4%).  
Prior to randomization, subjects had to be receiving LAM with confirmation of HBV pol/RT mutation(s) 
known to confer resistance to LAM (rtM204V/I ± rtL180M). At baseline, the median number of days of 
prior LAM therapy overall was 1229.0 days. Eligible subjects were also allowed to have had prior or 
current ADV treatment of ≤ 48 weeks at the time of screening (inclusive of combination ADV+LAM).  
Approximately twice as many subjects had received prior treatment with ADV in the FTC/TDF group 
compared with the TDF group (28.1% vs 15.6%, respectively [p = 0.012]); the clinical significance of 
this difference is unknown. Prior interferon therapy was reported for 28.6% of all subjects. 
The mean baseline HBV DNA value overall was 6.46 log10 copies/mL. Overall, the majority of subjects 
(213/280) had ALT levels < 2 × ULN at baseline. Similar proportions of subjects were HBeAg− 
(52.5%) and HBeAg+ (47.5%). All subjects were HBsAg+ at baseline. The mean (SD) years positive 
for HBV was 10.8 (7.73) years. The most common baseline HBV genotype in both treatment groups 
was genotype D (44.7%). Genotype A was present in a lower percentage of subjects in the TDF group 
compared with the FTC/TDF group (19.0% vs 25.0%, respectively). Genotype B was present in a 
higher percentage of subjects in the TDF group compared with the FTC/TDF group (19.0% vs 8.1%, 
respectively). Genotype C was present in 19.0% of subjects overall, and within a similar proportion of 
subjects within each treatment group (TDF group, 18.2%; FTC/TDF group, 19.9%). One subject in the 
TDF group had genotype E and 1 subject in the FTC/TDF group had genotype H. For 7 subjects, 
baseline viral genotype data was missing.

Adherence 
Adherence to study drugs was elevated in both treatment groups with a mean adherence rate around 
98% and 99% of patients (i.e., all but 1 in the TDF and 2 in the TDF/FTC arms) reporting adherence > 
80%.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the percentage of subjects with HBV DNA < 400 
copies/mL at Week 96 (FAS, M=F analysis). Differences between the TDF and FTC/TDF treatment 
groups were evaluated using the CMH test, controlling for randomization strata (HBeAg status and 
ALT). Sensitivity analyses were performed for the primary efficacy endpoint to evaluate the difference 
between the TDF and FTC/TDF treatment groups using a large-sample normal approximation test of 
proportions. 
Table 8. 
At no time point through Week 96 with either the M=E or M=F analysis was there a statistically 
significant difference between the 2 treatment groups in the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA < 
400 copies/mL. At Week 96, similar proportions of subjects in both treatment groups had HBV DNA < 
400 copies/mL based on both the M=F and the M=E analyses (p > 0.43, CMH test).

were antigen positive at baseline were included. 
d P-values apply to the overall column. 
e For 5 TDF subjects and 2 FTC/TDF subjects, the conserved-site changes were reversions toward consensus. 
Only 1 subject (HBeAg-negative; genotype A; FTC/TDF group) in the study achieved HBsAg loss, which 
occurred at Week 16 and sustained through Week 96 while treatment was continued. This loss was not 
accompanied by seroconversion to antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs). This result is comparable with other 
studies.

The virologic suppression and biochemical response (normal and normalized ALT) observed in the TDF 
group in this LAM-R study through Week 96 was generally consistent with that observed in two Phase 
3 studies of TDF 300 mg in a non-LAM-R population (Studies GS-US-174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103) 
as summarized in Table below. It should be noted that subtle differences in the method for handling 
missing data in each study somewhat limits the comparison.

Subgroup analysis 
Subgroup analyses were performed for HBV DNA endpoints by race (Asian subjects vs non-Asian 
subjects), and by randomization strata (ALT ≥2 xULN vs ALT < 2 xULN) for HBeAg+ and HBeAg-
subjects, respectively.

Resistance analysis 
- 
Pretreatment genotypic analysis 
Viral genotyping was performed on baseline serum samples from all subjects, and the majority of 
subjects were found to have genotypes A−D. Genotype D virus was the most commonly observed 
genotype (44.7%). 
Distribution of resistance mutation detected at screen (by INNO-LiPA) and baseline (population 
sequencing) is presented in the table below: 
Table 12.  Distribution of Resistance Mutations Detected at Screen (and Baseline by Treatment Arm) 
Overall rtM204V/I was detected in 278 subjects by INNO-LiPA and in 253 subjects by population 
sequencing. The mutation rtL180M was seen in 183 or 184 subjects by INNO-LiPA or population 
sequencing. rtL80V/I was detected in more subjects by INNO-LiPA (132) than by population 
sequencing (97) and rtV173L was the least frequent LAM-R mutation detected in 19 and 26 subjects by 
INNO-LiPA or population sequencing respectively. In addition, mutations at the LAM/ADV-R position 
rtA181 were detected in a minority of subjects, 6 at screening and 5 at baseline. 
•  Viral response in subjects with prior ADV exposure and/or ADV-R mutations at baseline 
Of the 280 subjects enrolled in Study 121, 61 were previously treated with ADV (17 subjects were 
enrolled despite having > 48 weeks of ADV treatment). Of these, 22 were in the TDF group and 39 
were in the FTC/TDF group. In each group, the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL 
at Week 96 was comparable for subjects with and without ADV exposure. In the TDF monotherapy 
group, 20/22 (90.9%) subjects with prior ADV exposure had HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL at Week 96 
compared with 106/119 (89.1%) subjects without prior ADV exposure. In the FTC/TDF group, 33/39 
(84.6%) subjects with prior ADV exposure had HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL at Week 96 compared with 
87/100 (87%) subjects without prior ADV exposure.  
Viread 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/143539/2013 
Page 23/69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Only 5 subjects had mutations detected at the ADV resistance (ADV-R) positions rtA181 and/or rtN236 
at baseline. All 5 subjects had mutations at rtA181; no subject had any mutations detected at rtN236. 
Table 13 summarizes relevant clinical information for these subjects. 
Table 13. 
 GS-US-174-0121: HBV DNA Values at Baseline and Week 96 of Subjects with Adefovir 
Resistant Mutations at Baseline. 
Four of the five subjects with ADV-R at baseline had HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL at Week 96, including 
the 1 subject on TDF monotherapy. Subject 2041 did not achieve HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL at Week 
96; however, this subject had a high baseline HBV DNA level (8.97 log10 copies/mL), and had an HBV 
DNA decline of > 6.25 log10 by Week 96 with no evidence of virologic breakthrough (Week 96 HBV 
DNA value was 524 copies/mL). 
• 
Impact of baseline HBV DNA level in ADV experienced patients 
At baseline, 22/141 (15. 6%) and 39/139 (28.1%) of subjects in the TDF and FTC/TDF groups, 
respectively, had a history of ADV therapy in addition to documented LAM-R. The impact of baseline 
HBV DNA level (< 107 versus ≥ 107 copies/mL) on treatment response in this subgroup of subjects 
was further explored. Below is a summary of treatment responses by baseline viral load and by 
assigned treatment (Table 14). Regardless of the presence or absence of prior ADV experience, 
treatment responses were comparable between the 2 groups for those with low and high HBV DNA 
values at baseline. 
As might be expected, the response rates overall at Week 96 in subjects with no exposure to ADV were 
not as robust in those with high baseline viral loads as those with lower viral loads (84.5% vs 91.4%, 
respectively); however, the opposite trend was observed in the small subgroup of subjects with high 
baseline viral load and prior ADV exposure. At Week 96, 90% of subjects with high baseline viral load 
and ADV experience had HBV DNA viral load < 400 copies/mL compared with 84.5% of subjects with 
high baseline viral load who were ADV-naive. A summary of the results is seen in Table 14 below. 
Given these findings, the results suggest that there was no clinical difference in treatment response in 
the subgroup of subjects with prior ADV exposure, even when baseline viral load is considered.

Viral response in subjects with prior ETV exposure and/or ETV-R mutations at baseline 
Overall, 13 subjects (7 in the TDF group, 6 in the FTC/TDF group) were enrolled in Study 121 with 
previous exposure to ETV, despite prior ETV use being an exclusion criterion. Four of these subjects (2 
in each treatment group) also had entecavir resistance (ETV-R) at baseline. Additionally, 21 subjects 
with no history of ETV exposure harboured ETV-R mutations at baseline. The presence of ETV-R in 
LAM-experienced, ETV-naïve subjects has been previously documented. In total, 34 subjects with 
either ETV exposure or ETV-R were enrolled in Study 121, 19 in the TDF group and 15 in the FTC/TDF 
group. 
The percentage of subjects with ETV exposure and/or resistance who completed 96 weeks of treatment 
(30/34, 88.2%) was comparable to the overall study population (258/280, 92.1%). 
In the TDF group, 16/19 (84.2%) subjects with ETV exposure and/or resistance completed 96 weeks of 
treatment compared with 117/122 (95.9%) subjects in the TDF group without ETV exposure and/or 
resistance (Fisher’s exact test p-value = 0.075). In the FTC/TDF group, 14/15 (93.3%) of subjects with 
ETV exposure and/or resistance completed 96 weeks of treatment compared with 111/124 (89.5%) 
subjects in the FTC/TDF group without ETV exposure and/or resistance (Fisher’s exact test p-value = 
1.000). 
In considering the mean HBV DNA and HBV DNA decline through Week 96 for subjects with or without 
ETV exposure and/or resistance at baseline, no significant differences were observed between groups, 
regardless of whether they were treated with TDF or FTC/TDF. The table below summarizes the mean 
viral load at baseline and Week 96, as well as the mean change in HBV DNA at W96 for all groups.

Table 15.  GS-US-174-0121: Mean Viral Load at Baseline and Week 96 and Mean Change in HBV DNA 
at Week 96 by Entecavir Exposure or Resistance 
An additional analysis was performed to evaluate the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA < 400 
copies/mL through Week 96. There was no significant difference observed between treatment groups 
at any study visit for subjects with ETV exposure and/or resistance. Furthermore, there was no 
significant difference in Week 96 response rates within the FTC/TDF treatment group, with 12/15 
(80.0%) subjects with ETV exposure and/or resistance having HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL at Week 96, 
compared with 108/124 (87.1%) subjects without ETV exposure and/or resistance (Fisher’s exact test 
p-value = 0.43). In the TDF group, subjects with ETV exposure and/or resistance had a lower rate of 
subjects with HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL at Week 96 (14/19, 73.7%) compared with subjects without 
ETV exposure and/or resistance (112/122 91.8%) (Fisher’s exact test p-value = 0.03). This difference 
may be explained by the fact that in the TDF group, a lower percentage of subjects with ETV exposure 
and/or resistance (16/19, 84.2%) completed 96 weeks of treatment compared with subjects without 
ETV exposure and/or resistance (117/122 95.9%), despite this difference not reaching statistical 
significance (Fisher’s exact test p-value = 0.075). 
-   Resistance surveillance 
Clinical isolates were obtained for genotypic analysis from subjects who met the following criteria 
during the 96-week double-blind treatment period: 
•  
Samples from subjects with HBV DNA ≥ 400 copies/mL (viremic) at Weeks 48 and 96 with or 
without virologic breakthrough. Virologic breakthrough was defined as 1.0 log10 copies/mL or 
greater (at least ten-fold) increases in HBV DNA from nadir, or values ≥ 400 copies/mL after 
being < 400 copies/mL while on study medication and confirmed after 2 consecutive values. 
•  
Last on-study samples from viremic subjects who completed at least 24 weeks of treatment 
but discontinued prior to Week 96. 
In the TDF arm, genotypic analysis was conducted on 18 subjects at Year 1 and/or 2. In the 
FTC/TDF arm, genotypic analysis was conducted on 17 subjects at Year 1 and/or 2.

Of the 18 subjects who qualified for genotypic analysis in the TDF group at Week 48 and/or Week 96, 
three subjects discontinued prior to Week 96 (or had no HBV DNA data available after Week 84), 1 
subject with confirmed virologic breakthrough and 2 subjects with unconfirmed virologic breakthrough. 
Of these, 1 subject had conserved and polymorphic site changes, 1 had no change from baseline, and 
1 was unable to be genotyped. 
The remaining 15 subjects were viremic (HBV DNA > 400 copies/mL) in the absence of virologic 
breakthrough at Week 48, with 6 subjects remaining viremic at Week 96. For these viremic subjects, 
HBV DNA levels generally declined from baseline to Week 48 and 96. Of the 15 viremic subjects, 7 had 
polymorphic and/or conserved-site changes in the HBV pol/RT at the last time of testing, 6 had no 
changes in the HBV pol/RT compared to baseline and 2 were unable to be genotyped.

testing. Seven subjects had no changes in the HBV pol/RT compared to baseline, and 1 subject was 
unable to be genotyped. The subject who could not be genotyped had no changes compared with 
baseline detected at an earlier time point.

No ADV resistance-associated mutation was detected in any of the patients who qualified for genotypic 
evaluation. 
Based on these data, no subjects showed genotypic resistance to TDF through Week 96. 
Phenotypic evaluations were performed for 4 subjects (3 in the TDF group and 1 in the FTC/TDF group) 
who developed changes at conserved sites at Week 48 and did not subsequently suppress HBV DNA to 
< 400 copies/mL by Week 96. None of the isolates containing conserved-site changes in the HBV 
pol/RT conferred reduced susceptibility to TFV.

PK Sub-study  
Subjects with CLcr between 50 to 80 mL/min at study entry were included in a PK substudy. These 
assessments were done once, during a single clinic visit occurring on or after Week 4 of study 
participation to ensure subjects were at steady state. It was anticipated that a minimum of 30 and a 
maximum of 50 subjects would meet the criteria for participation in the PK substudy (ie, screening 
CLcr 50 to 80 mL/min). 
Of the 280 subjects randomized to receive of TDF or FTC/TDF in the study, 78 subjects were included 
in the intensive PK substudy analysis set. Of these, 38 subjects received FTC/TDF and 41 subjects 
received TDF. 
Plasma was collected at time 0 (pre-dose), and at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-dose at a single clinic 
visit at Week 4 or anytime thereafter. Subjects were instructed to take their daily dose of study 
medication at the same time as the time 0 hour PK sample (e.g. 8:00 am) for at least 2 days prior to 
the visit. Additional details have been provided. 
In addition to the PK substudy described above, all subjects who experienced a CLcr decrease to < 50 
mL/min during the study were required to have this value confirmed within 72 hours (or alternatively, 
a 24-hour urine for CLcr could have been measured in lieu of a calculated CLcr). If the CLcr was 
confirmed to have been < 50 but ≥ 30 mL/min, the dosing interval was adjusted to every 48 hours. 
Subjects were then instructed to return to the clinic 1 week after the commencement of the dose 
adjustment to have a full PK profile performed. This was performed to ensure, retrospectively, that 
study drug levels (TFV) were maintained within an acceptable therapeutic range. The procedures were 
identical to those of the PK substudy with the exception that additional time points were included as 
noted below. 
Plasma samples were collected at least 1 week after the start of every-other-day dosing at: 0 (pre-
dose), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, and 48 hours post-dose. Subjects were instructed to take their every-other-
day dose of study drug at the same time as the 0 hour PK sample (e.g. 8:00 am). 
All subjects with confirmed CLcr of < 30 mL/min were to have been discontinued from the study. 
Concentrations of tenofovir (TFV) in plasma samples were determined using a fully validated LC-
MS/MS bioanalytical method. All samples were analyzed in the timeframe supported by frozen stability 
storage data. Assay validation parameters are summarized in the table below. 
Table 20. 
Steady-state tenofovir (TFV) PK parameters (Cmax, Clast, Tmax, Tlast, and AUCtau) were estimated by 
application of a nonlinear curve-fitting software WinNonlin® using non-compartmental method. The 
non-compartmental method employed Model 200 in conjunction with the linear up/log down 
trapezoidal rule.

Intensive PK sampling was conducted at steady state (at Week 4 or any time thereafter). However, 
samples were collected up to 8 hours post-dose only. The zero (pre-dose [C0h]) time point was used as 
a surrogate for the 24-hour post-dose (C24h) time point for purposes of estimating AUCtau. Due to 
limited sampling duration, steady-state t 1/2 could not be reliably estimated and therefore is not 
presented.

According to the MAH, those data are consistent with historical data in subjects with normal renal 
function (GS-01-929 and GS-01-932), suggesting that TFV PK is not affected in subjects with mild 
renal impairment. 
Subjects whose CLcr decreased to < 50 but ≥ 30 mL/min were dose adjusted by increasing the dosing 
interval to every 48 hours. Although based on a limited sample size (n = 7), the TFV exposures 
following dose adjustment in subjects with CLcr < 50 but ≥ 30 mL/min were in the range of those 
observed with subjects with CLcr 50 to 80 mL/min receiving once daily treatment.

Ancillary analyses 
Cirrhotic patients 
Liver histology was not required for patients entering Study 121 and non-invasive methods for 
assessing fibrosis were also not employed, making identification of cirrhotic subjects challenging. 
Seven (2.5%) subjects were identified as having a diagnosis of cirrhosis based on medical history, 4 
(2.8%) in the TDF group and 3 (2.1%) in the FTC/TDF group. There were 2 additional subjects, both in 
the FTC/TDF treatment group, who were diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during the 
study. One of these subjects with HCC (No. 4037-1013) was noted to be cirrhotic at the time of a 
serious adverse event (SAE) for sepsis, intra-abdominal infection, and diarrhea, while the other subject 
(No. 1591-4056) was noted by his treating physician to have possibly transitioned to cirrhosis at the 
time of the SAE of HCC. 
Overall, the treatment responses in these 9 (3.2%) subjects were excellent, in all but 1 instance 
(Subject 4037-1013 having the highest baseline HBV DNA level [Table 24]); full HBV DNA suppression

copies/mL).  A summary of efficacy results for these subjects is shown in Table 24.

1.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical study 
Ongoing study GS-US-174-0121 compares the efficacy and safety of TDF monotherapy with FTC/TDF 
combination therapy in the treatment of subjects with CHB who, at the time of screening, were 
receiving LAM and who had documented LAM-R mutations (rtM204V/I with or without rtL180M).  A 
total of 240 weeks of blinded treatment are planned; the report provided in this submission 
summarizes the results through Week 96 as the basis to extend the indication for Viread to patients 
with LAM-R.  
The study population was a mixed population of patients with HBeAg positive or negative disease. 
Patients should have confirmation of HBV pol/RT mutation(s) known to confer resistance to LAM 
(rtM204I/V +/- rtL180M) as determined by hybridization-based assay (INNO LiPA).  
To be included, patients should have baseline HBV DNA level ≥ 3 log10 IU/mL. The HBV DNA entry 
threshold was reduced through 2 protocol amendments from 5 log10 copies/ml to 4 log10 copies/ml 
Viread

and then 3 log10 IU//ml to be more consistent with current standard of treatment. Viral load rapidly 
increases in these patients and an early intervention would be crucial to prevent the occurrence of 
hepatitis flares and hepatic decompensation. Therefore, such modification is considered acceptable.  
Likely due the fact that TDF has some degree of cross-resistance with ADV, prior or current ADV 
treatment (inclusive of ADV+LAM) was allowed if ≤ 48 weeks. However, presence of resistance to ADV 
was not an exclusion criteria.  
TDF+FTC combination was used as comparator in this study, which is endorsed. TDF+FTC combination 
therapy is not approved for the treatment of patients with CHB, despite used in this setting in clinical 
practice. As a matter of fact, use of the convenient single tablet FTC/TDF in CHB patients is supported 
by therapeutic guidelines, notably by the EASL guideline. It is agreed that ETV monotherapy is not an 
optimal option for the management of patients with LAM-R due to the cross-resistance profile of the 
drugs. Other comparators might have been used such as ADV+LAM combination therapy or TDF+LAM 
combination therapy. However, given that TDF is known to be superior to ADV (moreover, literature 
data suggest add-on combination therapy with ADV+LAM is an effective therapy but only when 
initiated during the early stages of resistance development) and considering that FTC is a lamivudine–
like agent, the choice of the fixed-dose combination FTC/TDF in this study is endorsed.  
The primary endpoint was HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 96 (HBV DNA <169 copies/ml was 
included among secondary endpoints). Virological suppression has been fully recognised as a surrogate 
marker of treatment efficacy and sustained reduction of HBV DNA levels are associated with improved 
prognosis. Satisfactorily, biochemichal and serological endpoints are amongst secondary endpoints. No 
liver biopsy was performed in the study and indeed liver biopsy is not mandatory when deciding 
treatment management of patients with LAM-R. Moreover, correlation between viral suppression and 
histological improvement is now well documented (notably established for TDF by the 5 years 
histological data from pivotal studies -102/-103). 
 Randomization was stratified by HBeAg status and ALT level (< or > 2 ULN). HBeAg + and - diseases 
are two distinct disease with different response to therapy and HBeAg status is a well-endorsed 
stratification factor. Since there were no requirements as regards ALT level at screening and it is 
anticipated that a substantial number of patients would have normal ALT value since currently under 
therapy, stratification according to ALT level seems appropriate. Moreover, this factor might help 
ensure balanced repartition of patients who entered in the study following breakthrough or with partial 
response to prior treatment. 
Of note, analysis of the primary endpoint was modified per protocol amendment 4 to occur at Week 96 
and was not to be conducted using group sequential testing annually (ie, every 48 weeks). A single 
comparison at a longer time-point is considered relevant and this change in primary endpoint is not 
anticipated to have significantly impacted statistical analysis.  
A high screen failure rate (62%) was reported in the study. The MAH provided major reasons for 
screen failure in the study (i.e. lack of documented LAM-R and/or not receiving current treatment with 
LAM, or insufficient HBV DNA level).  Length of exposure to ADV did not account for important reason 
for screen failure while it could have been expected as a limiting factor for enrolment given that longer 
than 48 weeks pre-treatment with ADV could be observed in practice. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 280 patients were randomized and treated (141 subjects received TDF once daily and 139 
subjects received FTC/TDF once daily). 
Viread 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/143539/2013 
Page 40/69 
 
 
 
A total of 258 subjects (94.3% of subjects [133/141] in the TDF group and 89.9% of subjects 
[125/139] in the FTC/TDF group) completed the study through Week 96. 
Baseline characteristics of patients were similar in both groups but with the exception of prior ADV 
treatment. Almost twice as many patients received prior treatment with ADV in the FTC/TDF group 
compared with the TDF group (28.1% vs 15.6%). The level of HBV DNA at the beginning of TDF 
treatment in ADV resistant patients is considered a factor that could have an influence in the 
probability of complete virologic response.  However, the data presented, provide reassurance that 
baseline viral load and prior ADV-experienced did not significantly impact response to TDF in this 
study.  Indeed, high rate of virological suppression (> 80% having < 400 copies/ml) were reported in 
ADV-experienced and non ADV-experienced patients as well as in patients with high viral load or low 
viral load receiving TDF. Although based on small sample sizes, there is no obvious evidence that these 
factors may significantly reduce the likelihood of response. There is also no apparent advantage of 
FTC/TDF combination therapy over TDF in the subgroups, even though it is noted that in the likely 
harder-to-treat population of ADV-experienced patients with high viral load, FTC/TDF provided a 
higher, albeit a non-significant increased responder rate.  
Of note, enrolment of compensated cirrhotic was allowed per amendment 3. It was shown that in the 9 
patients with known cirrhosis participating in Study 121, treatment efficacy was similar to the overall 
population.  
Results for the primary endpoint (proportion of subjects with HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL (69 IU/mL) at 
week 96) show that 89.4% (126/141) of subjects in the TDF group and 86.3% (120/139) of subjects 
in the FTC/TDF group met the primary efficacy endpoint. When a more stringent criteria is used 
(proportion of patients with HBV DNA <169 copies/ml) the results are quite similar (85.8% of subjects 
in the TDF group and 83.5% of subjects in the FTC/TDF group). HBV DNA levels declined over the 
study period with similar mean changes from baseline in both groups (mean change from baseline in 
HBV DNA in the TDF group was −4.16 log10 copies/mL and in the FTC/TDF group was −4.27 log10 
copies/mL). These results are consistent with what has been observed in previous studies in HBV 
infected adults. As previously observed in HBV infected adults, the high virological potency of TDF does 
not translate into high rate of HBeAg or HBsAg seroconversion.  Although the mechanism is unclear, 
the literature is consistent in reporting from prospective, randomized, controlled trials that the rate of 
hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion is lower in patients with LAM-R HBV compared with treatment-
naive patients, regardless of the rescue regimen employed.   Moreover, only 1 patient achieved Hbs Ag 
loss without seroconversion to anti-HBs, which is however comparable with other published data.  
HBeAg and HBsAg loss and seroconversion will be further monitored throughout the remainder of the 
study period. 
Around 40% of patients in both groups had ALT levels within the normal range at baseline. This is 
consistent with the target population, as salvage therapy should be initiated at the time of virologic 
breakthrough, prior to the biochemical breakthrough. As expected, a clear benefit in both treatments 
was also demonstrated for the biochemical response [the percentage of subjects with normal ALT at 
week 96 increased to around 70 % (in both groups)]. 
Based on the resistance surveillance and genotypic analysis data, no subjects showed genotypic 
resistance to TDF through Week 96. Proportion of viral breakthrough was low and no clear pattern of 
mutations to TDF was found. 
Overall, a clear benefit of TDF monotherapy in patients with lamivudine resistance has been 
demonstrated in this study. However due to small numbers involved, the available data (week 96 
results) cannot clarify whether TDF+FTC would not be more beneficial than TDF monotherapy in 
patients having pejorative criteria (such as high viral load, prior ADV experience, with or without 
rtA181T resistance mutation, prior ETV exposure).

The proposed indication by the MAH reflects the populations studied in respective supportive studies. 
The indication was restricted to patients with compensated CHB and evidence of LAM-R virus. The 
CHMP considers that tenofovir should be indicated in patients with LAM-R regardless of whether they 
have compensated or decompensated CHB.  Indeed, although there is limited experience in patients 
with both lamivudine-resistant CHB and decompensated liver disease, (study GS-US-174-0121 was 
conducted in patients with LAM-R and compensated CHB and few patients with evidence of LAM-R were 
included in study GS-US-174-0108 in patients with decompensated CHB), the high potency and high 
genetic barrier of TDF as well as the lack of cross-resistance between TDF and LAM, make the 
extrapolation adequate. Viread is considered as the standard of care for patients with LAM-R in both 
situations. 
1.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
As the basis to extend the indication for Viread to CHB patients with LAM-R, the MAH submitted the 96 
weeks report of the study GS-US-174-0121 that compares the efficacy and safety of TDF monotherapy 
versus FTC/TDF combination therapy in patients with CHB who, at the time of screening, were 
receiving LAM and who had documented LAM-R mutations (rtM204V/I with or without rtL180M). The 
study was designed to answer the question whether TDF alone is as effective as TDF+FTC to manage 
patients with lamivudine resistance. The study is still ongoing and will provide blinded comparison of 
the two strategies over 240 weeks. 
Overall, the study design can be considered as adequate. At week 96, a similarly high proportion of 
patients achieved viral suppression in both treatment groups (TDF: 89.4% vs TDF/FTC: 86.3%). Viral 
potency is also observed with the most stringent criterion of HBV DNA <169 copies/ml and comparable 
results were observed between both treatments arms at week 96 on all (virological, biochemical and 
serological) endpoints.  
Those results confirm that TDF is highly effective in patients with LAM-R.  The CHMP nevertheless 
highlights the limitation notably as regards the potential advantage of FTC/TDF over TDF in patients 
having pejorative factors. Indeed, taking account of limited sample size, the available data (week 96 
results) cannot clarify whether TDF+FTC would not be more beneficial than TDF monotherapy in 
patients having pejorative criteria (such as high viral load, prior ADV experience, with or without 
rtA181T resistance mutation, prior ETV exposure).    
Even though patients with decompensated CHB were not specifically enrolled in this study in LAM-R, it 
is considered that due to its high potency and genetic barrier, the lack of cross-resistance between TDF 
and LAM and in view of the clinical experience already gained in decompensated patients (study GS-
US-174-0108), tenofovir is also a valid option in patients with LAM-R and decompensated CHB. 
1.5.  Clinical safety 
1.5.1.  Introduction 
The salient aspect of the safety profile of TDF relies on its renal and bone toxicity.  
Long-term data in CHB are currently available from the open-label extension phase of studies 102&103 
consisting of treatment with TDF up to 384 weeks (Year 8).

Cumulative  worldwide  exposure  to  TDF  or  TDF-containing  products  since  first  marketing  approval  in 
the  US  on  26  October  2001  to  31  May  2012  is  estimated  to  be  around  5  million  patients-years  of 
treatment. 
The principal clinical safety data for TDF in subjects with CHB who are resistant to LAM are derived 
from on-going, long-term, Phase 3b clinical study sponsored by Gilead Sciences, GS-US-174-0121. The 
safety analysis set (primary analysis set for the Week 96 safety interim analysis) includes 141 subjects 
who received TDF 300 mg and 139 subjects who received FTC 200 mg/TDF 300 mg. 
1.5.2.  Main study 
Patient exposure 
In GS-US-174-0121, a total of 280 subjects (141 in the TDF group and 139 in the FTC/TDF group) 
were randomized and treated. The percentage of subjects with 96 weeks of study drug exposure was 
similar in the TDF (94.3%) and FTC/TDF (92.1%) groups. A total of 133 subjects received 96 weeks of 
continuous treatment with TDF, and 128 subjects received 96 weeks of continuous treatment with 
FTC/TDF. 
The mean (standard deviation [SD]) duration of exposure to randomized study drug was 721.5 
(149.73) days in the TDF group and 719.1 (137.25) days in the FTC/TDF group.

Table 27.  GS-US-174-0121: Overall Summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety 
Analysis Set) 
Common Adverse Events 
The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was similar between the TDF group (70.2%) and the 
FTC/TDF group (70.5%). The most frequently reported treatment-emergent AEs included headache 
(14.2% in the TDF group and 11.5% in the FTC/TDF group), nasopharyngitis (10.6% in the TDF group 
and 10.1% in the FTC/TDF group), and fatigue (7.1% in the TDF group and 10.8% in the FTC/TDF 
group). There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of treatment-emergent AEs 
between the 2 treatment groups. 
Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent AEs were reported by a higher percentage of subjects in the 
FTC/TDF group (10.8%) compared with the TDF group (2.8%). The only Grade 3 or 4 treatment-
emergent AEs reported in 2 or more subjects were ALT increased (1 subject in the TDF group and 2 
subjects in the FTC/TDF group), headache (1 subject in the TDF group and 1 subject in the FTC/TDF 
group), and depression (2 subjects in the FTC/TDF group). 
The percentage of subjects who reported a treatment-emergent AE that was considered by the 
investigator to be related to study drug was similar between the 2 treatment groups (18.4% in the TDF 
group and 20.9% in the FTC/TDF group). The most frequently reported study drug-related AEs 
included fatigue (3.5% in the TDF group and 5.0% in the FTC/TDF group), nausea (2.8% in the TDF 
group and 4.3% in the FTC/TDF group), and headache (0.7% in the TDF group and 3.6% in the 
FTC/TDF group). Most study drug-related AEs were Grade 1 in severity, and most did not require dose

modification or interruption or discontinuation of study drug. The only Grade 3 or 4 study drug-related 
AE was flank pain in 1 subject in the FTC/TDF group. 
Adverse Events by Severity 
Grade 3 and 4 treatment-emergent AEs were reported in 2.8% of subjects (4 of 141) in the TDF group 
and 10.8% of subjects (15 of 139) in the FTC/TDF group. The only Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent 
AEs reported in 2 or more subjects were ALT increased (1 subject in the TDF group and 2 subjects in 
the FTC/TDF group), headache (1 subject in the TDF group and 1 subject in the FTC/TDF group), and 
depression (2 subjects in the FTC/TDF group). 
Treatment related AE 
Table 28.  GS-US-174-0121: Treatment-Emergent Study Drug-Related Adverse Events Reported in 2 
or More Subjects (Safety Analysis Set) 
In general drug-related AEs were more frequent in the FTC/TDF group (20.9% versus 18.4% in TDF-
treated patients). Gastrointestinal disorders were the most commonly AEs reported by SOC. Fatigue 
(3.5% and 5.0% in the TDF and FTC/TDF groups respectively), nausea (2.8% and 4.3% in the TDF and 
the FTC/TDF group) and headache (0.7% and 3.6%) were the more frequently reported treatment 
related AEs. Similarly, more patients experienced treatment-related AEs of Grade 2 or higher in the 
combination group (8.6% in the FTC/TDF group versus 2.8% in the TDF-treated patients). Fatigue and 
Viread 
Assessment report

headache were the only grade 2 (or higher) treatment-related AEs reported in more than 1 subject 
(fatigue in 4 subjects in the FTC/TDF group and headache in 2 subjects in the FTC/TDF group). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
There were three deaths during study period. The causes of death included gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage, cardiac arrest, and bronchopneumonia; all considered unrelated to study drug. All of 
these deaths occurred prior to Week 96. In addition, 1 subject died due to an SAE of hepatocellular 
carcinoma before starting study medication (ie, pre-randomization). 
Serious adverse events  
Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 5.7% of subjects (8 of 141) in the TDF group and 12.2% 
of subjects (17 of 139) in the FTC/TDF group. Treatment-emergent SAEs reported in 2 or more 
subjects included ALT increased in 4 subjects (1 in the TDF group and 3 in the FTC/TDF group), 
gastritis in 2 subjects (1 in the TDF group and 1 in the FTC/TDF group), and osteoarthritis in 2 subjects 
(both in the FTC/TDF group). 
Adverse events of special interest 
-  Renal disorders 
Renal Adverse events 
Treatment-emergent AEs in the renal and urinary disorders system organ class were reported in 2.8% 
of subjects (4 of 141) in the TDF group and 7.2% of subjects (10 of 139) in the FTC/TDF group. The 
most frequently reported treatment-emergent renal and urinary disorder AEs included proteinuria in 4 
subjects (1 in the TDF group and 3 in the FTC/TDF group), mild nephropathy in 3 subjects (1 in the 
TDF group [unrelated to study drug] and 2 in the FTC/TDF group [1 study drug related, 1 unrelated to 
study drug]), hematuria in 3 subjects (all in the TDF group), and glycosuria in 2 subjects (both in the 
FTC/TDF group). All other renal and urinary disorder AEs were reported in 1 subject each and included 
tubulo-interstitial nephritis in the TDF group and nephrolithiasis, nocturia, and renal colic in the 
FTC/TDF group. None resulted in permanent discontinuation of study drug. 
Renal laboratory abnormalities 
A total of 28 subjects (14 in the TDF group and 14 in the FTC/TDF group) had at least one marked 
clinical laboratory abnormality. The incidence of each individual marked laboratory abnormality was 
low (<4% of subjects in either treatment group). 
No subject had a confirmed increase from baseline in serum creatinine of at least 0.5 mg/dL. Two 
subjects (both in the TDF group) had a confirmed serum phosphorus concentration of <2 mg/dL. A 
total of 9 subjects (5 in the TDF group and 4 in the FTC/TDF group) had a confirmed CLcr rate of < 50 
mL/min. All 9 of these subjects had a baseline Clcr rate between 49−61 mL/min (by Cockcroft-Gault 
calculation). By Week 96, 4 of these subjects had Clcr < 50 mL/min, 4 subjects had Clcr ≥50 mL/min, 
and 1 subject had a last Clcr value of 47 mL/min (confirmed) at Week 84 (subject discontinued from 
the study prematurely due to an SAE of pneumonia).

Figure 5.  Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault) by Visit for Subjects with Confirmed Creatinine 
Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault) < 50 mL/min 
As illustrated in the graph above, renal function of patients who experienced CrCl <50ml/min seems to 
remain stable during the study. No patients discontinued for renal disorders at Week 96. Longer term 
data are awaited to further assess renal tolerance of TDF in patients with mild renal impairment at 
baseline. 
-  Hepatobiliary disorders 
Hepatobiliary AE 
Treatment-emergent AEs in the hepatobiliary disorders system organ class were reported in 0.7% of 
subjects (1 of 141) in the TDF group and 2.2% of subjects (3 of 139) in the FTC/TDF group. All 
treatment-emergent hepatobiliary disorder AEs were reported in 1 subject each and included hepatic 
pain in the TDF group and cholelithiasis, hepatic cirrhosis, and hepatomegaly in the FTC/TDF group. No 
hepatobiliary AEs were considered related to study drug, and none resulted in dose modification or 
interruption or discontinuation of study drug. 
Hepatic flare: 
-  
On-treatment: On-treatment hepatic flares (>2 X baseline value and >10 X ULN) were reported in 
3 subjects (2 subjects in the TDF group and 1 subject in the FTC/TDF group). The hepatic flares 
Viread 
Assessment report

Page 47/69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for each of these subjects resolved, and study drug was continued. The hepatic flares were 
accompanied by continued decreases in HBV DNA. 
-   Off-treatment: One subject in the FTC/TDF group experienced an off-treatment hepatic flare after 
discontinuing study drug due to pregnancy (see below). Approximately 2 months after 
discontinuing study drug, the subject had a severe SAE of ALT increased (an off-treatment ALT 
flare) on Day 251 (Grade 4 ALT peak value was 2285 U/L on Day 251, which was >2 X baseline 
and >10 X ULN and was accompanied by Grade 1 decrease in albumin and normal total bilirubin 
[0.5 mg/dL]). The SAE of ALT increased was resolved by Day 308 and was considered to be 
unrelated to study drug. Pregnancy outcome information was provided to DSPH after the data cut-
off for this interim Week 96 analysis. At 40 weeks of gestational age, the subject gave birth to a 
healthy female infant. 
-  Bone disorders 
Bone-related AE 
Treatment-emergent fractures were reported in 5 subjects (3 in the TDF group and 2 in the FTC/TDF 
group). None of the fractures were considered related to study drug, and none resulted in dose 
modification or interruption or discontinuation of study drug. All fractures were noted as trauma 
related.  
Bone DEXA measurement: 
- 
Spine:  Lumbar  spine  total  BMD  (g/cm2)  initially  decreased  from  baseline  to  Week  24  in  both 
treatment  groups,  and  subsequently  plateaued  with  minimal  further  decreases  in  BMD 
observed from Weeks 24 to 96. The mean (SD) percentage decrease in spine total BMD from 
baseline to Week 24 was −1.74% (2.87%) in the TDF group (n = 132) and −1.85% (2.57%) 
in the FTC/TDF group (n = 127). The mean (SD) percentage decrease in spine total BMD from 
baseline to Week 96 was −1.27% (3.78%) in the TDF group (n = 126) and −1.65% (3.68%) 
in the FTC/TDF group (n = 113). 
Figure 6.  GS-US-174-0121: Mean Percent Change from Baseline in Total Spine Bone Mineral Density 
(g/cm2) by Visit (Safety Analysis Set) 
A similar pattern of change in spine BMD was apparent in spine BMD T-scores and Z-scores over the 
first 96 weeks of the study (ie, scores were decreased by Week 24, and then remained relatively stable 
over Weeks 24 to 96). The mean (SD) decrease in spine BMD T-scores from baseline to Week 24 was 
−0.17 (0.257) in the TDF group (n = 132) and −0.17 (0.233) in the FTC/TDF group (n = 127). The 
Viread 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/143539/2013 
Page 48/69 
 
 
 
 
mean (SD) decrease in spine BMD Z-scores from baseline to Week 24 was −0.16 (0.259) in the TDF 
group (n = 132) and −0.16 (0.234) in the FTC/TDF group (n = 127). After Week 24, minimal changes 
were observed in spine T-scores and Z-scores through Week 96. There were no statistically significant 
differences in spine total BMD, T-score, or Z-score changes from baseline between the TDF and 
FTC/TDF groups at any post-dose time point. 
At baseline, 60% of subjects (83 of 138) in the TDF group and 58% of subjects (76 of 131) in the 
FTC/TDF group had normal spine BMD T-scores (≥−1). Baseline T-scores for spine BMD were −1 to 
−2.5 (consistent with osteopenia) in 32% of subjects (44 of 138) in the TDF group and 36% of 
subjects (47 of 131) in the FTC/TDF group. Baseline T-scores for spine BMD were < −2.5 (consistent 
with osteoporosis) in 8% of subjects (11 of 138) in the TDF group and 6% of subjects (8 of 131) in the 
FTC/TDF group. From baseline to Week 96, the clinical status category (ie, ≥−1 [normal], −1 to −2.5 
[consistent with osteopenia], or < −2.5 [consistent with osteoporosis]) for spine BMD T-score 
improved for 7 subjects and worsened for 22 subjects in the overall population (n = 269, p = 0.051). 
In the overall population, 3 subjects shifted from a spine T-score consistent with osteopenia at baseline 
to a spine T-score consistent with osteoporosis at Week 96, and 1 subject shifted from a spine T-score 
consistent with osteoporosis at baseline to a spine T-score consistent with osteopenia at Week 96. 
Figure 7.  GS-US-174-0121: Week 96 Spine T-score Versus Baseline Spine T-Score (Safety Analysis 
Set) 
At baseline, 91% of subjects (126 of 138) in the TDF group and 91% of subjects (119 of 131) in the 
FTC/TDF group had normal spine BMD Z-scores (≥−2). Baseline Z-scores for spine BMD were below 
the expected range for age (< −2) in 9% of subjects (12 of 138) in the TDF group and 9% of subjects 
(12 of 131) in the FTC/TDF group. From baseline to Week 96, the clinical status category for spine 
BMD Z-score in the overall population improved (ie, shifted from a spine Z-score < −2 to a spine Z-
score ≥−2) for 3 subjects and worsened (ie, shifted from a spine Z-score ≥−2 to a spine Z-score < 
−2) for 3 subjects (n = 269). 
- Hip: Compared to changes observed in spine BMD, decreases in hip BMD occurred more gradually 
throughout the first 96 weeks of the study, reaching the lowest point at Week 96. 
The mean (SD) percentage decrease in hip total BMD from baseline to Week 96 was −1.73% (2.593%) 
in the TDF group (n = 125) and −1.82% (2.825%) in the FTC/TDF group (n = 111).

Similar gradual decreases in hip BMD T-scores and Z-scores were apparent over the first 96 weeks of 
the study. The mean (SD) decrease in hip BMD T-scores from baseline to Week 96 was −0.13 (0.194) 
in the TDF group (n = 125) and −0.14 (0.221) in the FTC/TDF group (n = 111). The mean (SD) 
decrease in hip BMD Z-scores from baseline to Week 96 was −0.09 (0.191) in the TDF group (n = 125) 
and −0.10 (0.219) in the FTC/TDF group (n = 111). There were no statistically significant differences 
in hip total BMD, T-score, or Z-score changes from baseline between the TDF and FTC/TDF groups at 
any post-dose time point. 
Figure 8.  GS-US-174-0121: Mean Percent Change from Baseline in Hip Total Bone Mineral Density 
(g/cm2) by Visit (Safety Analysis Set). 
At  baseline,  79%  of  subjects  (107  of  135)  in  the  TDF  group  and  74%  of  subjects  (98  of  132)  in  the 
FTC/TDF group had normal hip BMD T-scores (≥−1). Baseline T-scores for hip BMD were −1 to −2.5 
(consistent with osteopenia) in 19% of subjects (26 of 135) in the TDF group and 25% of subjects (33 
of  132)  in  the  FTC/TDF  group.  Baseline  T-scores  for  hip  BMD  were  <  −2.5  (consistent  with 
osteoporosis)  in  1%  of  subjects  (2  of  135)  in  the  TDF  group  and  1%  of  subjects  (1  of  132)  in  the 
FTC/TDF  group.  From  baseline  to  Week  96,  the  clinical  status  category  for  hip  BMD  T-score  in  the 
overall population improved for 2 subjects and worsened for 14 subjects (n = 267, p = 0.028). In the 
overall population, only 1 subject shifted from a hip T-score consistent with osteopenia at baseline to a 
hip  T-score  consistent  with  osteoporosis  at  Week  96,  and  no  subject  shifted  from  a  hip  T-score 
consistent with osteoporosis at baseline to a hip T-score consistent with osteopenia at Week 96.

Figure 9.  GS-US-174-0121: Week 96 Hip BMD T-score Versus Baseline Hip BMD T-score (Safety 
Analysis Set). 
At baseline, 99% of subjects (134 of 135) in the TDF group and 97% of subjects (128 of 132) in the 
FTC/TDF group had normal hip BMD Z-scores (≥−2). Baseline Z-scores for hip BMD were below the 
expected range for age (< −2) in 1% if subjects (1 of 135) in the TDF group and 3% of subjects (4 of 
132) in the FTC/TDF group. From baseline to Week 96, the clinical status category for hip BMD Z-score 
in the overall population improved (ie, shifted from a hip Z-score < −2 to a hip score ≥−2) for 1 
subject and worsened (ie, shifted from a hip Z-score ≥−2 to a hip Z-score < −2) for 2 subjects (n = 
267). 
Laboratory findings 
The most frequently reported treatment-emergent marked laboratory abnormalities included urine 
blood (5 subjects in the TDF group and 3 subjects in the FTC/TDF group), urine glucose (1 subject in 
the TDF group and 3 subjects in the FTC/TDF group), prolonged prothrombin time (2 subjects in the 
TDF group and 2 subjects in the FTC/TDF group), elevated ALT (2 subjects in the TDF group and 2 
subjects in the FTC/TDF group), increased serum amylase (2 subjects in the FTC/TDF group), 
decreased phosphorus (1 subject in the TDF group and 1 subject in the FTC/TDF group), decreased 
platelets (1 subject in the TDF group and 1 subject in the FTC/TDF group), and elevated AST 
The most commonly (> 2 subjects) reported Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent laboratory 
abnormalities included urine blood (11 subjects), urine glucose (10 subjects), increased ALT (10 
subjects), increased AST (7 subjects), elevated fasting serum glucose (5 subjects), increased serum 
amylase (4 subjects), prolonged prothrombin time (4 subjects), and increased uric acid (3 subjects).  
Of the 11 subjects with treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 blood in the urine, all except 1 subject were 
female, suggesting that menstrual contamination may have contributed to these findings. 
Of the 10 subjects with treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 urine glucose, all except 2 subjects (Subjects 
4196-1018 and 4848-4070 in the FTC/TDF group) had a medical history of diabetes mellitus. Of the 5 
subjects with treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 increases in fasting serum glucose, 2 were in the TDF 
group and 3 were in the FTC/TDF group. All 5 subjects had a medical history of diabetes mellitus.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Four subjects permanently discontinued study drug due to a treatment-emergent AE (1 in the TDF 
group and 3 in the FTC/TDF group). All treatment-emergent AEs resulting in discontinuation of study 
drug were reported in 1 subject each and included neutropenia, malignant lung neoplasm, 
bronchopneumonia, and fatigue/bone pain/headache/somnolence/hypoesthesia. The AEs of fatigue, 
bone pain, headache, and somnolence were considered to be related to study drug; the other AEs 
leading to discontinuation were considered unrelated. 
Ancillary analyses 
Cirrhotic patients 
In the 9 subjects with known cirrhosis participating in Study 121, study drug treatment was generally 
safe and well tolerated. 
None of the subjects in this subset discontinued treatment for an AE related to study drug, and none 
experienced a Grade 3 or 4 drug-related AE or a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality reported as an 
AE. 
There were only 2 subjects, both in the FTC/TDF group, (Nos. 4037-1013 and 1591-4056) who 
experienced SAEs during the study, none of which were considered related to study drug.  
Subject 4037-1013, a 58-year-old white male with a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, was 
diagnosed with HCC during the study. This subject died from cardiac arrest on Day 711 related to SAEs 
of sepsis, abdominal infection, and diarrhea. 
Subject 1591-4056 experienced an SAE of HCC (moderate) on Day 421 (no date of resolution 
provided). Earlier in the study, this subject had experienced 2 separate episodes of creatinine 
clearance (CLcr) decreased (mild) on Days 225 (CLcr was 71 mL/min; Cockcroft-Gault calculation) 
through 281 (CLcr was 78 mL/min; Cockcroft-Gault calculation) and again on Day 337 (CLcr was 68 
mL/min; Cockcroft-Gault calculation) (no date of resolution provided; last available value was 67 
mL/min on Day 679, Week 96;Cockcroft-Gault calculation). Both of these AEs of CLcr decreased were 
considered by the investigator to be study drug related. 
Other reported adverse events (AEs) of clinical relevance (renal and bone related) in this subgroup 
were as follows. Three of these subjects reported AEs that were considered by the investigator to be 
study drug related: Subject 4530-4102 (TDF group) experienced an AE on Day 167 of osteoporosis (no 
date of resolution provided); Subject 1591-4017 (FTC/TDF group) experienced an AE of creatinine 
renal clearance decreased on Day 421 (no date of resolution provided); and Subject 1591-4069 
(FTC/TDF group) reported an AE of creatinine clearance decreased on Day 337 (no date of resolution 
provided). All of these treatment-related AEs were mild in severity. 
Comparison of key safety results in patients with CrCl < 80 versus > 80 ml/min 
The MAH conducted an ad hoc analyses of key safety results (AEs, renal-laboratory assessments, and 
BMD) in renally impaired subjects (n= 74 patients with mild renal impairment) compared with subjects 
with normal renal function (n=206). 
Subjects with baseline CLcr > 80 mL/min were significantly younger (median age 42.0 years) than 
those with baseline CLcr < 80 mL/min, more were male (81.1%) and they had significantly greater 
median ALT and fewer prior IFN or ADV exposure.

Treatment-emergent AE: 
The proportions of subjects experiencing AEs were slightly higher in the lower CLcr category (77%) 
versus the higher baseline CLcr category (68.0%); however, this difference was not statistically 
significant and was driven by the fact that more subjects in the lower baseline CLcr category 
experienced metabolism and nutritional disorders (12.2%) than those in the higher baseline CLcr 
category (2.4%) (p = 0.015). 
As expected, more subjects in the lower CLcr category experienced decreased creatinine clearance 
(6.8% versus 1.5% in the higher baseline CLcr category) (p = 0.032). 
Adverse events leading to discontinuations were summarized by baseline CLcr category and by 
baseline CLcr category and treatment; there were no notable differences between CLcr categories in 
the frequency or nature of AEs leading to discontinuation  
Renal:  
Mean change from baseline to Week 96 in serum creatinine was small and identical in both baseline 
CLcr categories (0.07 mg/dL). Moreover, mean serum phosphorus decreased similarly from baseline to 
Week 96 in both the lower (-0.06 mg/dL) and higher (-0.03 mg/dL) baseline CLcr groups.  
Mean baseline CLcr for subjects in the lower baseline CLcr category was 67.1 mL/min; in the higher 
CLcr category mean baseline CLcr was 103.6 mL/min. Mean CLcr decreased from baseline to Week 96 
in both the lower and higher CLcr groups, but more so in the higher baseline CLcr group (−9.1 
mL/min) than the lower CLcr group (−5.5 mL/min). 
Of note, 9 of 74 subjects (12.2%) in the lower baseline CLcr category experienced confirmed creatinine 
clearance below 50 mL/min, and 2 of 206 subjects (1.0%) in the higher baseline CLcr category 
experienced confirmed serum phosphorus below 2 mg/dL. 
Bone: 
Baseline mean (SD) total spine BMD was similar between the lower (1.05 [0.215] g/cm2) and higher 
(1.07 [0.177] g/cm2) CLcr categories, and mean (SD) change from baseline to Week 96 was also 
similar between baseline CLcr categories (−1.68 [3.602] g/cm2 lower CLcr category, −1.37 [3.777] 
g/cm2 higher CLcr category) (p = 0.46). Mean (SD) change from baseline to Week 96 in total spine 
BMD T-score and Z-score were similar between baseline CLcr categories. 
Baseline mean (SD) total hip BMD was similar between the lower (0.96 [0.181] g/cm2) and higher 
(1.00 [0.141] g/cm2) CLcr categories, and mean (SD) change from baseline to Week 96 was also 
similar between baseline CLcr categories (−2.30 [2.702] g/cm2 lower CLcr category, −1.58 [2.681] 
g/cm2 higher CLcr category) (p = 0.13). Mean (SD) change from baseline to Week 96 in total hip BMD 
T-score and Z-score were similar between baseline CLcr categories. 
Post marketing experience 
Viread was first approved in the US on 26 October 2001 and has an International Birth Date of 
31 October 2001.  
The cumulative worldwide patient exposure to TDF (alone and in combination products Truvada, 
Atripla, and Eviplera/Complera) from first marketing approval in the US on 26 October 2001 to 31 
March 2012 is estimated to be over 5 million patient-years of treatment.

No new safety signals have been identified in the assessment of safety data for TDF in patients with 
CHB in the Gilead DSPH database. 
1.5.3.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety analysis set from ongoing study GS-US-174-0121 includes 141 subjects who received TDF 
300 mg and 139 subjects who received FTC 200 mg/TDF 300 mg. The mean duration of treatment for 
TDF-exposed patients was similar between treatment groups: 721.5 days in the TDF group and 719.1 
days in the FTC/TDF group. In addition, long-term data in CHB are currently available from the open-
label extension phase of studies 102&103 consisting of treatment with TDF up to 384 weeks (year 8). 
For the clinical trial GS-US-174-0121, the frequency of AEs was similar for both treatment groups 
(70.2% for the TDF group and 70.5% for the FTC/TDF population) as well as the proportion of subjects 
reporting one treatment-related AE (18.4% in the TDF group versus 20.9% in the FTC/TDF group). 
However, higher frequency of grade 2, 3 or 4 treatment-related AE was reported in FTC/TDF-treated 
patients (8.6%) compared to TDF-treated patients (2.8%).  
No new adverse events have been identified. As expected, the SOC more frequently reported was 
“Gastrointestinal disorders”. Fatigue (3.5% and 5.0% in the TDF and FTC/TDF groups respectively), 
nausea (2.8% and 4.3% in the TDF and the FTC/TDF group) and headache (0.7% and 3.6%) were the 
more commonly reported treatment-related AEs. Similarly, more patients experienced treatment-
related AEs of Grade 2 or higher in the combination group (8.6% in the FTC/TDF group versus 2.8% in 
the TDF-treated patients).  
Special attention was paid to liver AEs, renal toxicity and bone toxicity. No new concerns were raised. 
Few patients reported hepatic AEs (0.7% in TDF population and 2.2% in the FTC/TDF group). Only 3 
patients (2 in the TDF group and 1 in the FTC/TDF population) experienced ALTs flares.  In general, in 
line with previous findings, data do not suggest major liver toxicity. The current wording stated in 
SmPC section 4.4 on the risk of hepatitis exacerbations during TDF treatment is considered 
appropriate.  
No major issues related to renal toxicity were identified. New concerns regarding the bone toxicity 
have not been observed either. An unexpected pattern of decrease in hip BMD was nevertheless 
observed, with gradual decrease not reaching a plateau at Week 96. Even though mean change from 
baseline in hip BMD remains small, this will need to be closely monitored in longer term reports and 
the potential for bone toxicity should continue to be monitored in future PSURs. 
A higher proportion of subjects experienced treatment-emergent SAEs in the FTC/TDF group (12.2%) 
compared to the TDF group (5.7%). Three deaths occurred during study period. None of them were 
considered related to the study drug.  
1.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In conclusion, no new AEs have been identified in this lamivudine-resistant population. The safety 
profile of TDF in patients with LAM-R in this study was consistent with the known safety profile of TDF 
as previously described in patients with CHB. In particular no major liver, renal or bone toxicities were 
reported in this study. An unexpectedly pattern of decrease in hip BMD was nevertheless observed, 
with gradual decrease not reaching a plateau at Week 96. Even though mean change from baseline in 
hip BMD remains small (as was also observed for hip BMD), this will need to be closely monitored in 
longer term reports and the potential for bone toxicity should continue to be monitored in future 
PSURs.

Moreover, this study was identified as part of FUM 234 [Submission of a comprehensive plan to 
generate data regarding the safety, exposure, and tolerability of Viread in patients with creatinine 
clearance 20 to 60 ml/min] as a source of information as regards the safety of Viread in patients with 
impaired renal function. In this study patients with CrCl 50-80 ml/min could have been included 
(whereas more stringent criterion is generally applied) and a total of 74 patients (41 in the TDF arm 
and 33 in the TDF/FTC arm) had 50ml/min>CrCl<80 ml/min at baseline. Comparison of the safety 
profile between patients with baseline CrCl <80 ml/min versus those with baseline CrCl >80 ml/min did 
not indicate significant difference in the safety profile (and notably no obvious deterioration of the 
renal function) in patients with mild renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function in 
this study 
1.5.5.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The next data lock point will be 31 March 2013.  
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.  
1.6.  Risk management plan 
1.6.1.  PRAC advice 
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan. 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 12.3 of 24 August 2012, the PRAC 
considers by consensus that the risk management system for Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (Viread) in 
the treatment of proposed indication is acceptable.  The following points should be taken into account 
in the next routine update of the RMP: 
1.  Epidemiology  of  resistance  to  lamivudine  in  patients  with  chronic  hepatitis  B  should  be 
provided. 
2.  Relevant  non  clinical  data  regarding  TDF  related  bone  toxicity  should  be  provided  when  the 
RMP will be format to the new template 
3.  Clinical  exposure  in  patients  with  chronic  hepatitis  B  (CHB)  who  are  resistant  to  lamivudine 
(LAM-R) should be provided 
4.  As regards the section detailing important identified risk (section 2.3.4.2.1), the renal toxicity 
section has not been updated to incorporate newly available data from study GS-US-174-0121 
and week 288 analyses of studies GS-US-174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103. However, renal data 
from  these  studies  were  reflected  in  other  parts  of  the  RMP.  For  the  sake  of  completeness, 
there might be a need to update this section as well; this should be commented by the MAH. 
5.  The applicant should discuss the points raised in assessment report of RMP 12.0: 
1)  In  vitro  studies  on  human  colonic  cell  line  caco-2  to  evaluate  a  potential  inhibitory 
effect of tenofovir DF on absorption of phosphate in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract have 
been completed and removed from this updated RMP. Due to the lack of consistency in 
the  behavior  of  phosphate  in  the  assay, phosphate  uptake  in  a  caco-2  monolayer  cell 
assay  does  not  appear  to  be  a  useful  approach.  No  additional  nonclinical  studies  are 
planned. However, the MAH should discuss the usefulness of other in vitro, as well as 
Viread 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/143539/2013 
Page 55/69 
 
 
in  vivo,  approaches  for  assessing  the  potential  inhibitory  effect  of  tenofovir  DF  on 
absorption of phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract. 
2)  Given  the  small  sample  size  in  studies  GS-US-174-0108  and  GS-US-174-0107, 
especially regarding patients with CPT score >9 (8 subjects with a baseline CPT score 
>9 in study -108 and 34 subjects with Orthotopic Liver Transplant who completed  96 
weeks  of  study  -107),    safety  in  patients  with  decompensated  liver  diseases  and  CPT 
score>9  (including  long  term  safety)  and  safety  in  liver  transplant  recipients  should 
continue  to be  monitored and  separately  reported in  the  PSUR.  Therefore,  in  order to 
keep coherence between the RMP and the PSUR, these concerns should be maintained 
as " missing information" in the RMP.  
3)  The  current  educational  materials  have  been  endorsed  in  April  2011.  Meanwhile,  the 
HIV  physician  survey  was  made  available  that  yield  interesting  results  that  may 
improve  the  renal  risk  minimisation  activities.  Therefore,  the  MAH  is  requested  to 
discuss the following comments: 
-  
The MAH should consider improvements to the brochure section regarding renal 
function monitoring, eg:  
-   As  for  dosing  interval  adjustment,  a  tabular  presentation  of  recommended 
renal  monitoring  schedule  might  deliver  more  efficient  information  and 
should be considered. 
-   Monthly monitoring of serum phosphate should be highlighted 
-   Monthly  renal  function  monitoring  should  be  mentioned  separately,  for  the 
initiation period (0-6 month) and the 6-12 month treatment period. 
- 
The MAH should consider adding the following information in the renal brochure: 
- 
- 
- 
some severe renal AEs have been reported  
reversibility of TDF renal toxicity has not been established 
the time to onset of the renal ADRs for subjects receiving TDF had a broad 
range  (In  clinical  studies,  time  to  onset  from  29    to  1291  days,  with  a 
median  of  296  days  (~  9  months)  and  in  spontaneous  reporting  (latest 
PSUR  Section  9.1.1.2),  50%  of  the  cases  occur  within  the  first  year, 
including 17% during the 6-12 month treatment period) 
4)  The  results  of  the  survey  of  HBV  physicians  are  similar  to  those  observed  for  HIV 
physicians and raise the same comments. 
5)  For the following updated versions of RMP, the MAH is requested to also submit tracked 
change versions 
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

Educational initiatives 
Objective and 
Rationale 
Managing risk through medical education activities, primarily aimed at 
communicating the importance of assessing creatinine clearance (CLcr) at 
baseline and during therapy, and the need for appropriate dose reduction in 
patients with renal impairment. 
Proposed Actions 
Educational initiatives (HIV) (see Section 5.2 for further details) 
‘HIV and the Kidney’ educational program 
HIV renal educational brochure (including creatinine clearance slide ruler) 
Educational initiatives (HBV) (see Section 5.3 for further details) 
Renal educational program for HBV (part of ‘Hepatology Perspectives’ 
educational program) 
HBV renal educational brochure (including creatinine clearance slide ruler) 
The HIV and HBV renal educational brochures, which include key renal 
messages, are provided in Annex 7. In accordance with the CHMP’s conclusions 
on Version 10 of the Viread EU-RMP, the creatinine clearance slide ruler has 
been included in updated HIV and HBV renal educational brochures. The 
updated brochures have been submitted to each national authority for 
assessment and approval prior to distribution.  
HIV Survey 
Gilead has conducted a HIV physician survey in Europe which was designed to 
formally assess the impact of key safety messages promoted by the renal 
educational program. Further HIV surveys were conducted in Q4 2008, Q1 
2010 and Q4 2011 following the roll-out of the ‘HIV and the Kidney’ 
educational program across the EU (see Section 5.2).  
HBV Survey 
Gilead has conducted a HBV physician survey in Europe providing a benchmark 
of HBV physician knowledge and practices relating to renal management of 
patients with CHB. Further HBV surveys were conducted in Q2 2010 and Q4 
2011 following the roll-out of the HBV renal educational program across the EU

Period 
Further waves of research will assess changes in knowledge/awareness over 
time following the implementation of educational campaigns.  
The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

resistant hepatitis B virus. 
A change to the proposal has been made in the light of the CHMP’s recommendation not to restrict the 
indication to compensated liver disease only, in such patients (highlighted). 
Section 4.1 “Therapeutic indication”  
Hepatitis B infection 
 Viread 245 mg film-coated tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults with: 
•  
compensated liver disease, with evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated 
serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and histological evidence of active inflammation 
and/or fibrosis (see section 5.1). 
•  
• 
compensated liver disease and evidence of lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (see sections 
4.8 and 5.1).

2.  
The MAH proposed to update SmPC section 4.8 to reflect safety consequences obtained from 
study GS-US-174-0121. 
Section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” 
Patients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B: No new adverse reactions to tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate were identified from a randomised, double-blind study (GS-US-174-0121) in which 280 
lamivudine-resistant patients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (n = 141) or 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (n = 139) for 96 weeks. 
3.  
The MAH proposed to update SmPC section 5.1 to include the study GS-US-174-0121 
description and results including information on genotypic data. 
The CHMP considered that the description of the study results in section 5.1 could be shortened.  
Additional changes have been made in the light of the MAH’s response to the RSI (highlighted).  
Section 5.1 “Pharmacological properties” 
Experience in patients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B at 96 weeks: The efficacy and 
safety of 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind study 
(GS-US-174-0121) in HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative patients (n=280) with compensated 
liver disease, with viraemia (HBV DNA ≥ 1000 IU/ml) and genotypic evidence of lamivudine 
resistance (rtM204I/V +/-rtL180M). Only five had ADV-associated resistance mutations at 
baseline. One hundred forty-one and 139 adult subjects were randomised to a tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate and emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treatment arm, respectively. Baseline 
demographics were similar between the two treatment arms: At baseline, 52.5% of subjects were 
HBeAg negative, 47.5% were HBeAg positive, mean HBV DNA level was 6.5 log10 copies/ml, and 
mean ALT was 79 U/l, respectively. 
After 96 weeks of treatment, 126 of 141 subjects (89%) randomised to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
had HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, and 49 of 79 subjects (62%) had ALT normalisation. After 96 weeks of 
treatment with emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, 120 of 139 subjects (86%) had 
HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, and 52 of 83 subjects (63%) had ALT normalisation. Among the HBeAg 
positive subjects randomised to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, 10 of 65 subjects (15%) experienced 
HBeAg loss, and 7 of 65 subjects (11%) experienced anti-HBe seroconversion through week 96. In the 
HBeAg positive subjects randomised to emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, 9 of 68 
subjects (13%) experienced HBeAg loss, and 7 of 68 subjects (10%) experienced anti-HBe 
seroconversion through week 96. No subject randomised to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate experienced 
HBsAg loss or seroconversion to anti-HBs. One subject randomised to emtricitabine plus tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate experienced HBsAg loss. The efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in patients 
with high baseline viral load (>107 copies/ml), prior adefovir dipivoxil experience, or prior entecavir 
experience or entecavir resistance was similar to those without these factors. 
Clinical resistance 
[…] 
In study GS-US-174-0121, 141 patients with lamivudine resistance substitutions at baseline received 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for up to 96 weeks.  Genotypic data from paired baseline and on 
treatment HBV isolates were available for 6 of 9 patients with HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at their last

time point on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.  No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were identified in these isolates. 
As a consequence of this variation, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated.  
Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity of this variation to perform minor linguistic amendments 
for the CZ and DE annexes.  Also, a factual error in the Estonian SmPC section 5.1 is corrected. 
Annex II and Labelling are updated in accordance to latest guidance. 
2.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
At week 96, a similarly high proportion of patients achieved viral suppression in both treatment groups 
(TDF: 89.4% vs TDF/FTC: 86.3%). Viral potency is also observed with the most stringent criterion of 
HBV DNA <169 copies/ml and comparable results were observed between both treatments arms at 
week 96 on all (virological, biochemical and serological) endpoints. Those results are in line with those 
reported in patients without lamivudine resistance and confirm that TDF is highly effective in patients 
with LAM-R (at least in those harbouring rtM204V/I +/-rtL180M). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Although high viral response rate is achieved, it remains that the level of translation into HBe (and 
HBs) seroconversion remains limited. However, it is acknowledged that literature reports lower rates of 
seroconversion in patients with LAM R as compared to patients with wild type. 
Moreover, whether TDF+FTC would not be more beneficial than TDF monotherapy in patients having 
pejorative criteria (such as high viral load, prior ADV experience, with or without rtA181T resistance 
mutation, prior ETV exposure) cannot be ascertained from the study submitted given the limited 
number of patients cumulating pejorative criteria. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
This study did not add any new safety issue to the already known risks for renal and bone toxicity of 
TDF. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The long term impact of renal and bone toxicity is a concern that is to be kept under close scrutiny. 
The MAH conducted an ad hoc analyses of key safety results (AEs, renal-laboratory assessments, and 
BMD) in renal impaired subjects (n= 74 patients with mild renal impairment) compared with subjects 
with normal renal function (n=206). Although there was no apparent signal towards a significant 
alteration of renal safety in patients with mild renal impairment, this cannot be regarded as sufficient 
to derive full reassurance in these patients. This will have to be kept under scrutiny through the RMP 
and PSUR.

An unexpected pattern of decrease in hip BMD was observed, with gradual decrease not reaching a 
plateau at Week 96. Even though mean change from baseline in hip BMD remains small, this will need 
to be closely monitored in longer term reports and the potential for bone toxicity should continue to be 
monitored in future PSURs. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
As previously observed in naïve patients, TDF also demonstrated high virologic potency and genetic 
barrier in lamivudine-resistant patients. As for naïve patients, the benefit-risk balance of tenofovir for 
the treatment of adults with lamivudine resistant chronic hepatitis B is positive. 
Even though patients with decompensated CHB were not specifically enrolled in this study in LAM-R, it 
is considered that due to its high potency and genetic barrier, the lack of cross-resistance between TDF 
and LAM, and in view of the clinical experience already gained in decompensated patients (study GS-
US-174-0108), tenofovir is also a valid option in patients with LAM-R and decompensated CHB. 
3.  Recommendations 
The application for the extension of the indication for the treatment of adults with lamivudine resistant 
chronic hepatitis B is approvable since other concerns have all been resolved. 
Final Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a – Change to therapeutic indication - Addition of a new 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Type 
II 
Extension of the indication: Treatment of adults with lamivudine resistant chronic hepatitis B.  As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC were updated.   
Annex I and IIIa were updated to reflect the fact that the EDQM short standard term ‘tablet(s)’ was 
introduced into the Viread packaging.  
Furthermore, the PI was brought in line with the latest QRD template version 8 An update was agreed 
to include minor linguistic amendments for the CZ and DE annexes.  A factual error in the Estonian 
SmPC was corrected. 
Amendments to the SmPC, Annex II and Labelling were approved.

• 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted:  
At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
When the submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they should be submitted at the 
same time. 
• 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall ensure that all physicians who are expected to 
prescribe/use Viread in adults and/or paediatric patients are provided with a physician educational 
pack containing the Summary of Product Characteristics and an appropriate educational brochure, as 
detailed below: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
HIV renal educational brochure, including the creatinine clearance slide ruler 
HBV renal educational brochure, including the creatinine clearance slide ruler 
HIV paediatric educational brochure 
HBV paediatric educational brochure 
The HIV and HBV renal educational brochures should contain the following key messages: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
That there is an increased risk of renal disease in HIV and HBV infected patients associated with 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing products such as Viread 
That Viread should only be used in patients with impaired renal function if the potential benefits 
of treatment are considered to outweigh the potential risks 
The importance of dose interval adjustment of Viread in adult patients with creatinine clearance 
of 30-49 ml/min 
That Viread is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
< 30 ml/min).  If no alternative treatment is available, prolonged dose intervals may be used 
That use of Viread should be avoided with concomitant or recent use of nephrotoxic medicinal 
products.  If Viread is used with nephrotoxic medicinal products, renal function should be closely 
monitored according to the recommended schedule 
That patients should have their baseline renal function assessed prior to initiating Viread therapy 
The importance of regular monitoring of renal function during Viread therapy 
Recommended schedule for monitoring renal function considering the presence or absence of 
additional risk factors for renal impairment

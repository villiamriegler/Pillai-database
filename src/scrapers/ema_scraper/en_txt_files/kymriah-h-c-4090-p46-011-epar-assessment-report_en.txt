1.  Introduction 
On 20 November 2019, the MAH submitted the final study results from a completed paediatric study 
for Kymriah, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of a post-authorisation measure (PAM) for this study. 
A short critical expert overview summarizing the results in the final CSR has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study B2205J is a supportive stand-alone study. 
The MAH has recently submitted a type II group of variations currently under review in a parallel 
procedure (Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/004090/II/0013/G) that includes updated interim results from 
this study as well as the pivotal phase II study B2202. Both of these multicentre studies enrolled 
comparable patient populations with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and had similar study 
designs. The MAH has in the requested group of variations proposed updates and amendments to the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC; section 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2) the Package Leaflet and the 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) related to the current approved ALL indication. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Kymriah cells dispersion for infusion, where 1-3 infusion bags contain a total of 1.2x106 to 6x108 
genetically modified anti CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) positive viable autologous T cells 
(tisagenlecleucel). The concentration of CAR positive viable T cells is dependent on patient body weight 
for treatment of patients with B-cell ALL. The cellular composition and the final cell number varies 
between individual patient batches. 
The approved dose range for paediatric and young adult patients with B-cell ALL is 0.2 to 5x106 CAR 
positive viable T cells/kg body weight for subjects ≤50 kg and 0.1 to 2.5x108 CAR positive viable T 
cells (non-weight based) for patients >50 kg. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
•  Study CCTL019B2205 (B2205J; Protocol no.03) 
Study B2205J (ENSIGN) is a phase II, single arm, open-label multi-center study designed to 
demonstrate or support the efficacy and safety of tisagenlecleucel in paediatric and young adult 
patients with B-cell ALL who have relapsed or are refractory to prior therapies. 
Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) was approved in the EU via the centralized procedure (Procedure No. 
EMEA/H/C/004090) on 23-Aug-2018. Kymriah is indicated for the treatment of: 
• 
Paediatric and young adult patients up to and including 25 years of age with B-cell ALL that is 
refractory, in relapse post-transplant or in second or later relapse.

Page 3/48 
 
 
 
•  Adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or 
more lines of systemic therapy. 
The evidence of efficacy in paediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) B-cell 
ALL was at the time of initial marketing authorization (MA) primarily based on data from the pivotal 
study B2202, which is a phase II open-label, multicentre, single arm study. Results from the first 
interim analysis (IA1) of study B2205J provided supportive evidence for the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel 
(see Table 1).

Results from study B2205J have been reported previously in two interim clinical study reports (CSRs). 
The first interim CSR (data cut-off [DCO] date: 01-Feb-2016; final CSR: 24-Nov-2016) was submitted 
to EMA as part of the initial MA application for tisagenlecleucel on 02-Nov-2017. The second interim 
CSR (DCO: 06-Oct-2017; final CSR: 01-Nov-2018) served to fulfil the paediatric investigation plan 
(PIP) Study 2 of PIP EMEA-001654-PIP01-M03, and compliance was confirmed on 01-March-2019 
based on this CSR. 
The final results from the complete data set of this study are now submitted according to Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, which requires that any MAH-sponsored study involving use in the 
paediatric population of a medicinal product covered by a MA should be submitted to the competent 
authority within six months of completion of the concerned study.

Objective(s) and Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel therapy as measured by overall 
remission rate (ORR), which includes complete response (CR) and CR with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi) as determined by Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessment within 6 months 
after tisagenlecleucel administration for patients with B-cell ALL. 
The secondary efficacy objectives included the following: 
Table 2. Secondary objectives and related endpoints in study B2205J 
The pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with a best 
overall disease response of CR or CRi. The best overall disease response was the best disease response 
recorded from tisagenlecleucel infusion until start of new anticancer therapy (including SCT). 
For the best overall disease response to be categorized as CR or CRi, ,remission status was required to 
be maintained for at least 4 weeks (28 days) without clinical evidence of relapse. 
Study design/Treatments 
Study B2205J had several sequential periods for all subjects as follows: screening, enrolment, and pre-
treatment (cell product preparation, bridging- and lymphodepleting (LD) chemotherapy), treatment 
and primary follow-up (which included one single dose of tisagenlecleucel infusion and follow-up until

month 60). Subjects who discontinued from primary follow–up (i.e. patients with relapse after 
remission, treatment failure, stem cell transplantation (SCT) while in remission, or who withdrawn) 
prior to month 60 entered a secondary follow-up and from primary or secondary follow-up, patient 
entered long-term survival and safety follow-up (see Figure 1 below). 
Figure 1. Study design of B2205J 
Leukapheresis: Leukapheresis was performed as per study protocol or per local institutional guidelines. 
Bridging chemotherapy: Bridging chemotherapy was allowed per investigator choice. 
Lymphodepletion (LD): Prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion, a LD chemotherapy cycle was planned. 
Cyclophosphamide-based regimens were the agents of choice and the LD regimen consisted of: 
• 
Fludarabine (30 mg/m2 iv daily for 4 doses) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 iv daily for 2 
doses starting with the first dose of fludarabine) 
If the patient had a previous grade 4 hemorrhagic cystitis with cyclophosphamide, or the patient 
demonstrated a chemorefractory state to a cyclophosphamide-containing regimen administered shortly 
before LD chemotherapy, then the following was used: 
•  Cytarabine (500 mg/m2 iv daily for 2 days) and etoposide (150 mg/m2 iv daily for 3 days 
starting with the first dose of cytarabine) 
If patients had a white blood cell (WBC) count ≤ 1,000 cells/μL within one week prior to 
tisagenlecleucel infusion, LD chemotherapy was not required. 
Tisagenlecleucel infusion: Investigational treatment consisted of a single iv infusion with a target dose 
range of 2.0 to 5.0×106 tisagenlecleucel cells (i.e. CAR-positive viable T-cells) per kg body weight (for 
patients ≤ 50 kg) or of 1.0 to 2.5×108 tisagenlecleucel cells (for patients >50 kg). 
The following cell dose ranges were allowed if all other safety release criteria were met: 
• 
• 
Patients ≤ 50 kg: 0.2 to 5.0×106 CAR-positive viable T-cells per kg body weight 
Patients >50 kg: 0.1 to 2.5×108 CAR-positive viable T-cells

The tisagenlecleucel dose was administered via a single iv infusion. 
The total duration of the study is 5 years. After tisagenlecleucel infusion, efficacy is assessed monthly 
for the first 6 months, then quarterly up to 2 years and semi-annually afterwards up to 5 years, or 
until the patient relapse. In addition, semiannual and annual evaluations are to be performed for up to 
15 years in the long-term follow up on all patients under a separate destination protocol (study A2205) 
as recommended by health authority guidance for patients treated with gene therapies.

infusion 
g.  Anti T-cell antibodies: Administration of any T cell lytic or toxic antibody (e.g. 
alemtuzumab) within 8 weeks prior to tisagenlecleucel was prohibited since residual 
lytic levels may destroy the infused tisagenlecleucel cells and/or prevent their in vivo 
expansion. If such an agent had been administered within 8 weeks prior to 
tisagenlecleucel, the Sponsor had to be contacted, consultation with an pharmacology 
expert was considered, and measuring residual drug levels was considered, if feasible, 
prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
11. Women of child-bearing potential (defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming 
pregnant) and all male participants, unless they are using highly effective methods of 
contraception for a period of 1 year after the tisagenlecleucel infusion. Women who are not of 
reproductive potential (defined as either <11 years of age, Tanner Stage 1, post-menopausal 
for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e. have had no menses) or have undergone 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and/or bilateral oophorectomy) were eligible without 
requiring the use of contraception. In case of use of oral contraception, women must be stable 
on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment. 
12. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women. NOTE: female study participants of reproductive 
potential must have had a negative serum or urine pregnancy test performed within 48 hours 
before infusion. 
Statistical Methods 
Analysis sets 
The Enrolled set comprised all patients who were enrolled in the study. Enrolment date was defined as 
the point at which the patient met all inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the patients’ leukapheresis 
product was received and accepted by the manufacturing facility. 
The Full analysis set (FAS) comprised of all patients who received infusion of tisagenlecleucel. 
The Efficacy Analysis Set (EAS) consisted of a subset of patients in the FAS who were treated with 
tisagenlecleucel at least 6 months prior to the last subject last visit (LSLV). In the final report, EAS was 
identical to the FAS. 
The Safety set comprised of all patients who received infusion of tisagenlecleucel. 
The Per-protocol set (PPS) consisted of a subset patients in the FAS who were compliant with major 
requirements of the clinical study protocol. 
The Pharmacokinetic analysis set (PAS) consisted of a subset of patients in the FAS who had at least 
one sample providing evaluable PK data. 
Hypothesis and primary efficacy analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed by testing whether the ORR was greater than 20% at 
overall one-sided 2.5% level of significance:  
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/321779/2020  
Page 10/48 
 
 
 
 
 
H0: p ≤ 0.2 vs. Ha: p >0.2.  
This was tested by comparing the lower bound of two-sided exact Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals 
for ORR in the EAS to 20%.  
Interim analysis 
An interim analysis and a final analysis was planned for the primary endpoing (ORR), and an α-
spending function according to Lan-DeMets (O’Brien-Fleming) was used to control the Type I error for 
the primary endpoint (ORR) at a one-sided level of significance of 2.5%. The bound for declaring 
success at the interim/final analysis was determine based on the actual number of patients (29/45), 
and the corresponding confidence interval calculated. If the calculated confidence interval for ORR 
exceeded 20% the study was to be declared a success.

Statistical methods for secondary endpoints 
No formal hypothesis testing was planned or carried out for secondary endpoints. For secondary 
endpoints involving disease assessments the IRC assessment (done during treatment and primary 
follow-up phase only) was considered primary.  
Percentage of patients who achieved CR or CRi at Month 6 without SCT between CTL019 infusion and 
Month 6 response assessment, and Percentage of patients who achieved CR or CRi and then proceed to 
SCT while in remission before Month 6 response assessment, were presented with .two-sided exact 
95% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals.  
For time-to-event analyses (DOR, RFS, EFS and OS), the survival function was estimated using the 
Kaplan-Meier (product-limit) method. Median survival and KM-estimates at specific time points with 
95% confidence intervals were presented.  
Duration of remission (DOR) was defined as the duration from the date when the response criteria of 
CR or CRi was first met to the date of relapse or death due to underlying cancer.  
Relapse free survival (RFS) was measured by the time from achievement of CR or CRi whatever 
occured first to relapse or death due to any cause during CR or CRi.  
Event free survival was the time from date of first CTL019 infusion to the earliest of: Death from any 
cause after remission, Relapse or Treatment failure. Treatment failure was defined as no response in 
the study and discontinuation from the study due to any of the following reasons: Death Adverse 
event, Lack of efficacy, New anticancer therapy.  
For DOR,RFS and EFS Patients were censored at the last disease assessment prior or on the date of: 
ongoing no event, lost to follow-up, withdrew consent, New anti-cancer therapy, adequate assessment 
no longer available, event after at least two missing scheduled disease assessments. Sensitivity 
analyses not censoring for SCT were performed.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/321779/2020  
Page 11/48 
 
 
 
Overall survival was defined as the time from date of first CTL019 infusion to the date of death due to 
any reason. Patients not known to have died were censored at latest date known to be alive. No 
censoring for SCT was done.  
Missing Data  
Patients with unknown clinical response were treated as non-responders, or by censoring for the time 
to event endpoints as described above.  
Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroup analyses were considered exploratory and only ORR by age subgroups was presented.  
(Statistical methods of analysis) 
Assessor’s comment 
Standard methods have been applied for testing of hypotheses and estimation of primary and 
secondary endpoints. The censoring rules applied to the time-to-event endpoints are the same as in 
the B2202 pivotal study. Overall the statistical methods are endorsed. 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation was primarily based on the hypothesis testing for ALL patients. Based on 
the null hypothesis of ORR ≤ 20% and alternative hypothesis of ORR >20%, 45 ALL patients in the FAS 
was calculated to provide 93% power to demonstrate statistical significance using a 2-look Lan-Demets 
group sequential design with O’Brien-Fleming type boundary at one-sided cumulative 0.025 level of 
significance, if the underlying ORR is 45%. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Study B2205J enrolled and treated paediatric and young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL and 
lymphoblastic lymphoma at 9 investigative centres in the US. Study initiation date was 14-Aug-2014 
(first subject first visit) and study completion date was 24-May-2019 (last subject last visit). 
A total of 85 paediatric and young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma were 
screened, 75 were enrolled in the study and 64 patients were infused with tisagenlecleucel. Ten 
screened patients could not be enrolled (nine subjects did not satisfy all clinical inclusion criteria or met 
exclusion, and one was not enrolled due to physician decision). Among the enrolled patients, 14.7% 
(11/75) discontinued after enrolment and prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion (8.0% [6 patients] died and 
6.7% [5 patients] discontinued due to product related issues. The median times from screening and 
enrolment to tisagenlecleucel infusion were 54.5 days (range: 33 to 182) and 37.5 (range: 22 to 118), 
respectively.

Table 4. Overall patient disposition (Enrolled set) 
All patients (n = 64) who received tisagenlecleucel infusion completed 6 months follow up and were 
included in the efficacy analysis set (EAS), including 84.4% (54/64) patients <18 years of age. 
There were no major protocol deviations leading to exclusion from PPS. Of the 64 subjects, 12 subjects 
(18.8%) were excluded from the PPS not due to protocol deviation but due to an infused dose below 
the minimum target dose: less than 2x106 tisagenlecleucel transduced viable T cells/kg for subjects ≤ 
50 kg (n = 4) and less than 1x108 transduced cells for subjects > 50 kg (n = 8). Minor protocol 
deviations were reported in 12 subjects who received tisagenlecleucel infusion and one additional 
patient who did not receive tisagenlecleucel. The minor protocol deviations are not considered to have 
had a significant impact on the assessment of the final study results. 
Baseline data 
The demographics and baseline disease characteristics for all patients who were enrolled and received 
tisagenlecleucel infusion in study B2205J are presented in Table 5, Table 6 and Table 7 below:

Assessor`s comment 
The applicant has not described in detail which data/analysis the report on biopharmaceutics will 
contain. The submitted package with this Article 46 procedure does not include updated dose-
exposure-response analysis. It is presumed this will be submitted later (OC). 
Cellular kinetics and pharmacokinetic data 
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Updated results (i.e. updated cellular kinetics) are presented for study B2205J with study completion 
date: 24-May-2019 (last subject last visit). 
Results 
All tisagenlecleucel infused subjects were included in the kinetic analysis for the derivation of cellular 
kinetic parameters (n = 64). Transgene levels were determined in peripheral blood via quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with a lower limit of quantification of 10 copies/200 ng of DNA that 
approximates to 50 copies/μg of genomic DNA. Cellular kinetic parameters of tisagenlecleucel were 
derived from qPCR data, and summarized. Concentration-time profiles of tisagenlecleucel as measured 
by qPCR by response category are displayed in Figure 2 (D28) and Figure 3. 
CR/CRi subjects showed a trend for greater maximal expansion (Cmax) and durability of persistence 
(AUC0-28d and AUC0-84d) relative to a limited number of NR subjects.

The median time to reach Cmax (Tmax) for tisagenlecleucel transgene was approximately 10 
days in the CR/CRi subjects and 20 days in the NR subjects.  
The transgene levels in pheripehral blood was higher in CR/CRi patients than in NR. 
Tisagenlecleucel was measurable in peripheral blood up to 921 days in CR/CRi subjects. 
In CR/CRi subjects the transgene levels in bone marrow were present at the first post-infusion 
time point (at Day 28), followed by a decline in levels over time. A wide range of transgene 
levels measured across all CR/CRi subjects showing the trafficking of tisagenlecleucel to the 
bone marrow space while transgene was not measureable in the NR subjects at collections 
beyond Day 28. 
•  Biomarker studies further supported the on-target effects of tisagenlecleucel including B-cell 
aplasia. As measured by the average level of peripheral blood CD19-positive B-cells, 
tisagenlecleucel effectively eradicated CD19 positive B-cells in CR/CRi subjects. The KM 
estimated probability that a subject will remain with B-cell aplasia was 67.6% (95% CI: 
52.0%, 79.1%) at Month 6, and 53.9% (95% CI: 37.6%, 67.7%) at Month 12 and at Month 
30.

Assessor`s comment: 
The cellular kinetics profile appears consistent with that of the two prior interim studies, although 
direct comparisons have not been submitted. The dose- and exposure-efficacy relationships have not 
been reinvestigated based on the updated data from study B2205J.  
For the variation EMEA/H/C/4090/II/013/G (currently ongoing) the applicant submitted updated 
analysis of the exposure-response relationship. In that analysis, in contrast to previous analyses, the 
updated data reveal an apparent exposure-response relationship, with DOR being considerably longer 
in DLBCL patients with exposure above the median exposure, most notably for Cmax, but also for 
AUC0-28d. In ALL patients, there was still no apparent relationship between weight-adjusted dose and 
DOR in patients ≤50 kg. In patients >50 kg, DOR was notably shorter in patients who received a dose 
lower than the median dose (1.75 x 108 CAR-positive viable T cells). However, due to the small 
number of patients in this analysis, the results should be interpreted with caution. The MAH’s plans to 
further assess the dose and the exposure-response relationships as more data become available was 
supported.  
The applicant is asked to clarify their approach for assessing the clinical relevance of the trend for 
difference in exposure-response between responders and non-responders as more data come 
available. Specifically, the following point should be addressed for updated exposure-response analysis 
and any implications of new results for the dosing rationale should be discussed (OC). 
- exposure categorized into quartiles  
- additional analyses to re-evaluate the relationship between exposure parameters (preferably 
considering all potentially important exposure parameters, including AUC0-28d, AUC0-84d and Cmax, 
unless otherwise justified) and PFS, EFS (i.e. as in the initial MAA submission) as well as DOR.  
- tumor burden and the actual dose administered to the individual patients.

Efficacy results 
Results from the IA1 with DCO of 01-Feb-2016 and a median follow-up of 11.5 months was submitted 
to EMA as part of the initial MAA. The main efficacy results from the IA1 is summarised in Table 8 
below: 
Table 8. Summary of efficacy results from study B2205J (IA1) 
The final analysis includes updated efficacy data based on 75 patients who were enrolled, including 64 
who received tisagenlecleucel infusion and completed 6 month follow up. The median follow-up time 
for the 64 patients treated with tisagenlecleucel defined as median duration from first infusion until 
LSLV was 31.74 months (range: 17.6-56.0).

Table 9. Summary of final efficacy results from study B2205J (EAS/FAS) 
A total of 13 of the 45 patients (28.9%) who achieved a BOR of CR or CRi reported relapse per IRC 
review prior to LSLV. The median DOR was not reached. The estimated relapse-free rate among 
responders was 79.5% (95% CI: 62.9, 89.3) at month 6, 70.5% (95% CI: 52.8, 82.6) at month 12, 
and 62.8% (95% CI: 43.9, 76.9) at month 24 after onset of remission per IRC review for the EAS/FAS. 
There was 100% concordance between the IRC assessment and local assessment of BOR and ORR 
within 6 months post -tisagenlecleucel infusion in the enrolled set (Table 10).

Clinical response with and without SCT at Month 6 
Among the 64 patients who were infused at least 6 months prior to LSLV, 34 patients (53.1%; 95% 
CI: 40.2, 65.7) achieved CR or CRi at month 6 without SCT between tisagenlecleucel infusion and the 
month 6 response assessment. In addition, five patients (7.8%; 95% CI: 2.6, 17.3) achieved CR or 
CRi and then proceeded to SCT while in remission before month 6 response assessment in the EAS.

Safety results 
The amendment submitted applies to the published clinical study report (CSR) entitled “A Phase II, 
single arm, multicenter trial to determine the efficacy and safety of CTL019 in pediatric subjects with 
relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia” dated 12-Nov-2019. 
The purpose of this amendment is to correct results (text) reported for the overall survival (OS). The 
changes are in the following sections: 
 Section 11.2.6 (Overall survival) 
 Section 13 (Discussion and overall conclusions) 
Changes in safety results are summerised below. 
At the time of approval, a preliminary report of the current study (B2205J) was submitted as a 
supportive study, Phase II, patients enrolled: N=35, patients infused: N=29.  
The safety assessment in pediatric patients with B-cell ALL was based on data presented by pooling 
safety data from study B2205J with safety data from the pivotal study B2202 (Phase II study, patients 
enrolled: N=92, patients infused: N =75). 
The study B2205J was completed 24-may-2019 and the following safety data is presented based on 
data observed in 64 subjects followed for a median of 31.74 months. 
Adverse events 
The AEs remained consistent with that reported in the previous two interim CSRs (Clinical Study 
Reports) and with similar incidence rates with more subjects (N = 64 vs N = 58 and N = 29). Majority 
of the AEs were reported within 8 weeks. Similarly, AEs suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel cell 
product by PT occurred at a higher frequency during the first 8 weeks after the infusion.

Severity 
Out of 64 subjects, AEs of 47 subjects were with maximum grade 4; and AEs of 12 subjects were with 
maximum grade 3. The most commonly reported grade 3 AEs by PT regardless of the study drug 
relationship were febrile neutropenia (35.9%), anemia (29.7%), decreased appetite (18.8%), alanine 
aminotransferase increased (21.9%), WBC count decreased (18.8%), CRS (12.5%), aspartate 
aminotransferase increased (12.5%), hypokalemia (12.5%), hypophosphatemia (10.9%), hypotension 
(10.9%), and lymphocyte count decreased (10.9%). 
The most commonly reported grade 4 AEs by PT regardless of the study drug relationship were also 
similar and were as follows: neutrophil count decreased (32.8%), WBC count decreased (28.1%), 
platelet count decreased (18.8%), CRS (17.2%), hypotension (12.5%), and neutropenia (12.5%). 
Seriousness 
The most frequently reported SAEs were: CRS, febrile neutropenia, hypotension, and pyrexia which 
was consistent with that reported in the previous two interim CSRs (Data cut-off 27-Nov-2016 and 06-
Oct-2017, respectively). Seven additional subjects reported SAEs since the second interim CSR. Fifty-
two subjects (81.3%) reported at least 1 SAE irrespective of study drug relationship. The most 
frequently reported SAEs were consistent with those reported in the previous two interim CSRs (N = 
58 and N = 29): CRS in 41 subjects (64.1% vs 67.2% and 69.0%), febrile neutropenia in 23 subjects 
(35.9% vs 32.8% and 34.5%), and hypotension in 7 subjects (10.9% vs 12.1% and 13.8%) and

Forty-six subjects (71.9%) reported at least 1 SAE suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel infused 
product. The most frequently reported SAEs suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel cell product 
were: CRS (64.1%), and febrile neutropenia (31.3%) 
Deaths 
Overall, 30 subjects (46.9%) died at any time after tisagenlecleucel infusion. Eleven deaths were 
reported since the second interim CSR. 
No new deaths were reported within 30 days of tisagenlecleucel infusion since the second interim CSR. 
Twenty-eight subjects (43.8%) died > 30 days post-infusion, out of which 24 (37.5%) subjects died 
due to ALL disease progression and 1 subject each (1.6%) died due to complications of transplant 
surgery, glioblastoma multiforme, seizure and sepsis.

Adverse events of special interest  
The majority of these AESI occurred within 8 weeks of tisagenlecleucel infusion.  
With more subjects and longer follow-up compared to the previous two interim CSRs (N = 58 and N = 
29, respectively), most AESIs appear similar in incidence including CRS. 
Fifty-eight (90.6%) subjects had at least 1 AESI suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel cell 
product (10 additional subjects since the second interim CSR. The most frequently reported AESI 
suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel cell product was CRS (78.1%) similar to that reported in the 
second interim CSR. The most frequent AESIs reported in subjects < 18 years of age were similar to 
the overall population.

AESIs after 8 weeks to 1 year and after 1 year post tisagenlecleucel infusion: 
Thirty five subjects (62.5%) had at least 1 AESI after 8 weeks to 1 year post tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
The most frequent AESI by group term was infections (58.9%). No incidence of CRS was observed in 
study subjects beyond 8 weeks of tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
Cytokine release syndrome 
The median time to onset of CRS was 4.5 days (range: 1 to 20 days). The median time to onset of CRS 
in subjects with CR/CRi was 4.0 days. Eight subjects reported CRS of grade 3 and 11 subjects reported 
CRS of grade 4. All the CRS events were suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel cell product. 
Thirteen subjects (26.0%) received concomitant medication or non-drug therapy such as systemic 
anti-cytokine therapy, 12 subjects received tocilizumab, 9 subjects received corticosteroids, and 5 
subjects were treated with other anticytokine therapy (Etanercept) and 12 subjects required high dose 
vasopressors. Out of these 50 subjects, the outcome was reported as recovered/resolved in all except 
1 subject. In Subject the event was reported as not resolved. The subject died while the event was 
ongoing. Among 50 subjects with CRS, none of the events were fatal.

infections. Overall, other infections were reported in 2 subjects each or 1 subject each of which 6 
events were grade 3 or 4 (1 each of gastroenteritis, pneumonia, Staphylococcal infection, catheter site 
infection, septic embolus and urinary tract infection enterococcal).   
Infections suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel cell product were reported in 7 subjects (10.9%) 
and were as follows: staphylococcal infection, acute sinusitis, catheter site cellulitis, enterococcal 
infection, herpes simplex, influenza, orchitis, and urinary tract infection enterococcal. 
The outcome was reported as fatal in 2 subjects with grade 4 infection. Subject experienced septic 
embolus on Day 25 and died the same day due to embolic stroke and Subject experienced respiratory 
tract infection on Day 1038 and died on Day 1047 
Prolonged depletion of normal B cells or Agammaglobulinemia 
AESI agammaglobulinemia was reported in 27 subjects (42.2%) within 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel 
infusion.  Of these 27 subjects, AESI agammaglobuminemia was suspected to be tisagenlecleucel-
related in 25 subjects with 4 subjects having grade 3 AESI agammaglobuminemia. No grade 4 AESI 
agammaglobuminemia were reported. Prophylaxis for Agammaglobulinemia was recommended as per 
local guidelines. Of note, many subjects had IVIg replacement initiated prior to the subject developing 
grade 3 agammaglobulinemia. 
Neurological events 
The SMQ (broad) “noninfectious encephalopathy/delirium” was used to identify and define the 
frequency of SNAR (serious neurological adverse reactions) grouped AEs. This query included the PT of 
“Autoimmune encephalopathy”, “CAR T-cell-related encephalopathy syndrome”, “Delirium” and 
“Tremor”. 
Nineteen subjects (29.7%) all of which had CRS had transient neuropsychiatric events within 8 weeks 
of tisagenlecleucel infusion (no additional subjects since the second interim CSR [Study B2205J second 
interim CSR]. Six subjects had confusional state, all with a maximal CTCAE grade less than 3. Four 
subjects experienced delirium and encephalopathy, 3 subjects experienced seizures. Other events were 
reported in 1 or 2 subjects. 
Neurological events suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel cell product were reported in 13 
subjects (20.3%). Grade 3 neurological events suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel cell product 
were encephalopathy, seizure, and dysphagia in 1 subject each (1.6%). 
The outcome was reported as recovered or resolved in all subjects except six (due to confusion, in 3 
patients, disturbance in attention, dysarthria and tremor one patient each). 
Tumor lysis syndrome 
One AESI of tumor lysis syndrome was reported within 8 weeks of tisagenlecleucel infusion. Subject 
reported grade 3 tumor lysis syndrome and it was suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel cell 
product from Day 6 to Day 9. The outcome was reported as recovered or resolved.

Aggravation of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), cerebral edema, and hematological disorders 
(including aplastic anemia and bone marrow failure) 
The majority of these AESI occurred within 8 weeks of tisagenlecleucel infusion. Forty-seven subjects 
(73.4%) had hematological disorders, WBC decreased in 30 subjects, anemia in 27 subjects, neutrophil 
count decreased in 25 subjects, febrile neutropenia in 22 subjects, platelet count decreased in 19 
subjects, lymphocyte count decreased in 14 subjects, neutropenia in 8 subjects, thrombocytopenia in 8 
subjects, lymphopenia in 3 subjects, and hemoglobin decreased and pancytopenia in 1 subject each. 
Aggravation of GVHD and cerebral edema was reported in 1 subject each (1.6%). Grade 3 or 4 
hematological disorders were reported in 45 subjects. 
Conclusion on safety by the MAH: 
In this final CSR for Study B2205J, there were no unexpected safety findings in the pediatric subjects 
with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL identified. The safety profile corresponds to that observed in the 
other studies of tisagenlecleucel in this indication, and as reported in prior Interim CSRs for Study 
B2205J, the final CSR for Study B2101J as well as in the Interim CSRs for pivotal Study B2202 and 
previously discussed in the context of the Kymriah Marketing Application, and continues to be 
consistent with the known safety profile for tisagenlecleucel. The benefit risk assessment remains 
unchanged and positive. 
Based on the results of Study B2205J, the Marketing Authorization Holder does not propose any 
changes to the pediatric information of the current Kymriah Core Data Sheet or the Kymriah European 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Final efficacy results compared to the IA1 results reported at the time of initial MA 
The MAH has submitted comprehensive overviews of the demographics and baseline disease 
characteristics of both the enrolled patient population (N=75) as well as the EAS/FAS population 
(N=65) in study B2205J. Overall, the baseline data between the enrolled and infused sets appear to be 
similar. Still, the submitted data reveal that a higher proportion from the two older age groups (82%; 
9/11) and male patients (91%; 10/11) are those who drop out after enrolment in study B2205J before 
receiving the study treatment. Thus, among the patients who received tisagenlecleucel a slightly 
higher proportion of 53% were female patients. In contrast, male patients constituted a majority 
(57%) of the infused patients in the pivotal study B2202. In total, 41% of the infused patients in study 
B2205J underwent a prior hematopoietic SCT (HSCT), whereas 3% had two prior HSCTs. The median 
number of previous therapies patients had received was 3 (range: 1-9); the majority (89%) had 
relapsed disease, and the minimum bone marrow blast count was 8%. The demographics, baseline 
disease status and disease history of the population appear to be representative for the current 
approved indication of patients with r/r B-cell ALL. 
Among the 64 patients who received tisagenlecleucel, 57 patients (89%) received bridging therapy 
while waiting for the infusion. In addition, 94% (60/64) of the patients who received tisagenlecleucel 
received LD chemotherapy after enrolment and prior to infusion in order to facilitate engraftment and 
homeostatic expansion of tisagenlecleucel. The proportions of patients reported to have been receiving 
bridging- and LD therapies and the type of chemotherapy combinations the infused patients received in 
study B2205J appear to be similar to study B2202. 
The primary endpoint of best ORR within 6 months based on IRC assessment in the EAS of 29 patients 
from the IA1 (DCO: 01-Feb-2016) was 69.0% (20/29; 95% CI: 43.6%, 88.1%). Among the 
responding patients, 62.1% (18/29) achieved a CR, while 6.9% (2/29) obtained a CRi.

The ORR reported in the final analysis in the FAS of 64 patients was 70.3% (45/64; 95% CI: 52.9, 
82.4). Among the responding patients, 59.4% (38/64) achieved a CR, while 10.9% (7/64) obtained a 
CRi. The ORR for the enrolled set in the final analysis was 60.0% (45/75: 95% CI 48.0, 71.1). Among 
all the enrolled patients, 38 patients (50.7%; 38/75) achieved a best response of CR, and 7 patients 
(9.3%; 7/75) obtained a best response of CRi. 
With respect to the secondary endpoints, all patients in the final analysis who achieved a BOR of CR or 
CRi except for two patient, also achieved bone marrow MRD negative remission (43/64; 67.2%; 95% 
CI: 54.3, 78.4). The total proportion was slightly higher than reported in the first interim analysis. The 
median DOR was not reached. Median follow up from onset of response was 10.97 months (range: 4.7, 
47.1). Among the responding patients, 31.1% (14/45) were still in remission at the DCO of the final 
analysis. In total, 28.9% (13/45) of the patients who achieved a BOR of CR or CRi reported relapse 
prior to LSLV. 
The median EFS in the final analysis increased compared to the interim analyses, i.e. median EFS was 
15.6 months (95% CI: 6.4, NE). The estimated event-free probability was 67.0% (53.5, 77.4) at 
month 6, 53.6% (39.3, 66.0) at month 12 and 47.8% (95% CI: 33.0, 61.1) at month 24. This could 
be expected with a longer median follow-up of 31.74 months (range: 17.6-56.0).  
The median OS in the infused patients was 29.9 months (95% CI: 15.1, 42.4) in the final analysis with 
a median follow-up time of 15.13 months (range: 4.1, 49.3). The median OS in the enrolled patient 
population was 25.9 months (95% CI: 10.2, 37.7) with a median follow of 13.60 months (range: 3.7, 
50.2). The estimated probability of survival from infusion was 84.4% (95% CI: 72.9, 91.3) at month 6, 
65.4% (95% CI: 52.4, 75.7) at month 12 and 54.7% (95% CI: 39.8, 67.4) at month 24 in the infused 
patient population. In the enrolled patient population, the estimated probability from enrolment was 
78.7% (95% CI: 67.1, 86.5) at month 6, 59.9% (95% CI: 47.4, 70.3) at month 12 and 56.5% (95% 
CI: 43.9, 67.3) at month 24. 
At the time of the final OS analysis, 34 patients were censored of whom 19 patients where alive at the 
DCO, whereas 15 patients were reported as “lost to-follow up”. According to the MAH, 14 of these 
patients discontinued the study at about 24 months follow-up and switched to the long-term follow-up 
study A2205B. Another patient discontinued “when the subject reached 18 years of age and did not 
have IRB approved adult informed consent form (ICF)”. The OS curve, especially beyond 24 months 
including the estimated median OS should therefore be interpreted with caution. The MAH has clarified 
in the response to the request for further information, the rationale for censoring for OS follow up in 
the final analysis for the 14 patients who switched to the long–term follow-up study A2205B and have 
provided individual patient data at the time of transition for these 14 patients. However, no updated 
OS analyses including these patients have been submitted. The MAH’s approach to define patients that 
transitioned to study A2205B as “lost–to-follow-up” and therefore censoring them in the final OS 
analysis in study B2205J is not supported. Several of these patients have been censored for OS a 
considerably long time prior the last DCO of 24-May 2019. Updated OS analyses for study B2205J with 
the latest possible survival status for the 14 patients transitioned to the follow-up study should 
therefore be provided and included in the recommended update of section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
In total, 5 of the 64 patients who achieved CR or CRi proceeded to SCT while in remission before the 6 
months response assessment. According to additional data provided, a total of 9 patients among the 
64 infused patients proceeded to HSCT during the study. The proportion of patient proceeding to HSCT 
constitutes only 14% (9/64) of the total FAS population. The exclusion or censoring of patients 
proceeding to HSCT was explored in requested sensitivity analyses for OS. The analyses revealed no 
impact on the event free probability estimates at different time points or on the median OS compared 
to the OS FAS.

Overall, it is agreed that the efficacy results from the final analysis are consistent with the IA1 results 
reported at the time of initial MA. In addition, the final data included almost the double of patients with 
r/r B-cell ALL than the IA1 and contained more mature data from the target patient population. 
Efficacy results from supportive study B2205J compared to the pivotal study B2202 
Study B2205J enrolled comparable patient populations with r/r B-cell ALL and had similar study design 
as study B2202. The main difference between the two studies was the definition of the primary efficacy 
endpoint ORR, which was measured within 6 months after tisagenlecleucel administration in study 
BB2205J compared to 3 months in study B2202. Furthermore, a University of Pennsylvania 
manufacturing process was used for the manufacturing of tisagenlecleucel for the first 29 batches 
included in the IA1, whereas a Novartis manufacturing process was used thereafter for the 
manufacturing of CAR T-cells to the rest of the patients enrolled in study B2205J. Thus, the IA1 results 
are based solely on tisagenlecleucel products produced by using the Pennsylvannia manufacturing 
process whereas the final analysis is based on patients receiving tisagenlecleucel from the Novartis 
manufacturing process as well. 
Overall, the updated efficacy results from the final analysis of study B2205J is consistent with the 
efficacy data reported in an updated interim analysis of the pivotal study B2202 with the DCO of 13-
Apr-2018, which are currently under assessment in a type II group of variations (Procedure No. 
EMEA/H/C/004090/II/0013/G). 
Nevertheless, the best ORR within 6 months in study B2205J is lower than the ORR reported within 3 
months in study B2202 in both all the enrolled patients (60% vs 67%) as well as in the infused patient 
population (69% vs 82%). The proportion of enrolled patients who achieved a best response of CR was 
the same (51%) in the two studies, and a slightly lower proportion in study B2205J obtained a best 
response of CRi (9.3% vs 16.5%). The median DOR was not reached in any of the two studies. In 
contrast to the interim analysis for the pivotal study B2202 was the median EFS reached at the latest 
DCO of the final analysis (15.6 months; 95% CI: 6.4, NE) of study B2205J. The estimated event-free 
probability was comparable at month 6 (67% vs 71%), month 12 (54% vs 56%) and month 24 (48% 
vs. 53%) between study B2205J and B2202. 
The median OS was only reached in the final analysis of study B2205J, both in the infused patients 
(29.9 months; 95% CI: 15.1, 42.4) as well as in the enrolled patient population (25.9 months; 95% 
CI: 10.2, 37.7). The estimated probability of survival from enrolment in the enrolled patient population 
was comparable at month 6 (79% vs. 78%), lower at month 12 (60% vs. 70%), but the same at 
month 24 (57%) in study B2205J compared to study B2202. The proportion of patients who achieved 
CR or CRi and then proceeded to SCT while in remission before month 6 was identical (8%) between 
the two studies. 
In conclusion, the efficacy results from the complete data set of study B2205J are considered to 
confirm the data underlying the approved indication of Kymriah in r/r ALL patients. Study B2205J had 
similar study design and enrolled comparable patient populations with r/r B-cell ALL as the pivotal 
study B2202. In addition, the efficacy results from the final analysis are consistent with the IA1 results 
reported at the time of initial MA, the final data included almost the double of patients with r/r B-cell 
ALL compared to the IA1 and contained more mature data from the target patient population. Since 
the complete data set of study B2205J along with updated data from study B2202 provide a more 
robust foundation for the approved ALL indication, the MAH is strongly recommended to present the 
final study results of study B2205J in section 5.1 of the SmPC during a variation application following 
the conclusion of this procedure.

Safety data from the supportive study B2205J and compared to the pivotal study B2202 
AEs reported in this final analyses of study C2205J  (N = 64) are consistent with the safety profile of 
tisagenlecleucel previously reported in interim CSRs (N = 58 and N = 29). 
The majority of the subjects who developed CRS that was manageable with supportive measures; in 
some cases CRS events required hospitalization and administration of anti-cytokine therapy (24% 
received one or more doses of tocilizumab). No deaths were attributable to CRS. 
The last updated SmPC section 4.8 uses frequency data based on the pivotal study B2202 
(paediatric and young adult B-cell ALL): 
The most common non-haematological adverse reactions were cytokine release syndrome (77%), 
infections (72%), hypogammaglobulinaemia (53%), pyrexia (42%) and decreased appetite (38%). 
The most common haematological adverse reactions were decreased white blood cells (100%), 
decreased haemoglobin (100%), decreased neutrophils (100%), decreased lymphocytes (100%) and 
decreased platelets (97%). 
Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions were reported in 89% of patients. The most common Grade 3 and 4 
non-haematological adverse reaction was cytokine release syndrome (48%). 
The most common Grade 3 and 4 haematological laboratory abnormalities were white blood cells 
decreased (97%), lymphocytes decreased (96%), neutrophils decreased (95%), platelets decreased 
(77%) and haemoglobin decreased (48%). 
Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions were more often observed within the initial 8 weeks post-infusion 
(82% of patients) compared to after 8 weeks post-infusion (51% of patients). 
The frequency data (AEs all grades) seen in the final study report of the supportive study B2205J 
are much the same or lower: cytokine release syndrome 78.1%, infections (within first 8 weeks) 
40.6%, hypogammaglobulinaemia 50.0%, pyrexia 39.1%, decreased appetite 34.4%. The frequencies 
of haematological adverse reactions seems lower in study B2205J than found in the pivotal study 
B2202: white blood cell decreased 54.7%, anaemia 42.2%, neutrophil count decrease 43.8%, 
lymphocyte count decreased 25.0%, platelet count decrease 25.0%.   
The frequency data given in the SmPC is referred to study B2202 specifically and for most adverse 
events, except the haematological events, are pretty much the same. The frequency table categorising 
AEs in very common, common etc will be the same.  
It can be agreed that no further updates of the PI concerning SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8 is needed 
based on data in the final study report. 
3.  Rapporteur’s updated overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the MAH submitted the final study 
results from the complete data set of study B2205J. The study is a phase II, single arm, open-label 
multi-center study designed to demonstrate or support the efficacy and safety of tisagenlecleucel in 
paediatric and young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL. The evidence of efficacy for the approved ALL 
indication was primarily based on data from the pivotal study B2202 at the time of initial MA. Results 
from the IA1 of study B2205J with data from 29 patients was concluded at that time to be immature 
and therefore only provided supportive evidence for the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

The cellular kinetics profile reported in the final study report of study B2205J appears consistent with 
that of the two prior interim studies, although direct comparisons have not been submitted. The dose- 
and exposure-efficacy relationships have not been reinvestigated based on the updated data from 
study B2205J. Based on prior analysis, there is a trend for difference in exposure-response between 
responders and non-responders, however the clinical relevance of this for the dosing rationale is not 
yet clear. The MAH’s plans to further assess the dose and the exposure-response relationships as more 
data become available is supported. Some clarification is requested to understand their approach. 
The final study results from the complete data set of study B2205J are considered to support the data 
underlying the approved indication of Kymriah in r/r ALL patients. It is therefore agreed that the data 
from this study do not change, but rather confirm the favourable benefit-risk conclusion of Kymriah in 
the currently approved ALL indication. Study B2205J had similar study design and enrolled comparable 
patient populations with r/r B-cell ALL as the pivotal study B2202. In addition, the efficacy results from 
the final analysis are consistent with the IA1 results reported at the time of initial MA, the final data 
included almost the double of patients with r/r B-cell ALL compared to the IA1 and contained more 
mature data from the target patient population. Since the complete data set of study B2205J along 
with updated data from study B2202 provide a more robust foundation for the approved ALL indication, 
the MAH should present the final study results of study B2205J in section 5.1 of the SmPC during a 
variation application following the conclusion of this procedure. 
The last updated SmPC section 4.8 uses frequency data based on the pivotal study B2202 (paediatric 
and young adult B-cell ALL). The frequency data (AEs all grades) seen in the final study report of the 
supportive study B2205J are much the same or lower: cytokine release syndrome 78.1%, infections 
(within first 8 weeks) 40.6%, hypogammaglobulinaemia 50.0%, pyrexia 39.1%, decreased appetite 
34.4%. The frequencies of haematological adverse reactions seems lower in study B2205J than found 
in the pivotal study B2202: white blood cell decreased 54.7%, anaemia 42.2%, neutrophile count 
decrease 43.8%, lymphocyte count decreased 25.0%, platelet count decrease 25.0%. 
The frequency data given in the SmPC refers to study B2202 specifically and for most adverse events, 
except the haematological events, are pretty much the same. The frequency table categorising AEs in 
very common, common etc will however be the same. It can be agreed that no further updates of the 
PI concerning SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8 is needed based on data in the final study report. 
The procedure is concluded and there is no request for more information. However, the final variation 
application to update the SmPC with the complete data set of study B2205J is awaited. 
The overall benefit-risk balance of Kymriah remains positive for the treatment of paediatric and young 
adult patients up to and including 25 years of age with B cell ALL that is refractory, in relapse post-
transplant or in second or later relapse. 
  Fulfilled: 
The procedure is concluded and there is no request for more information. 
However, the MAH should commit to submit an application for a variation to update section 5.1 of the 
SmPC with the complete data set of the paediatric B-cell ALL study B2205J.

4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1.  A biopharmaceutics report on humoral and cellular immunogenicity will be submitted later. 
Please clarify when the report will be submitted and what the report will contain, specifically 
whether updated exposure response analysis will be conducted. 
2.  Please clarify the approach for assessing the clinical relevance of the trend for difference in 
exposure-response between responders and non-responders as more data come available. 
Specifically, the following point should be addressed for updated exposure-response analysis 
and any implications of new results for the dosing rationale should be discussed: 
a.  exposure categorized into quartiles  
b.  additional analyses to re-evaluate the relationship between exposure parameters 
(preferably considering all potentially important exposure parameters, including AUC0-
28d, AUC0-84d and Cmax, unless otherwise justified) and PFS, EFS (i.e. as in the initial 
MAA submission) as well as DOR.  
c. 
tumor burden and the actual dose administered to the individual patients. 
3.  Please provide an overview of the demographics, baseline disease status and disease history 
for all the enrolled patients (N=75), including those who did not receive the study drug, as 
these comprises the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. 
4.  Please provide data describing the proportion of patients who received bridging- and 
lymphodepleting therapies and further specify which therapy combinations were selected for 
the patient population in the FAS. 
5.  The rationale for censoring the 14 patients for OS follow up in the final analysis who switched 
to the long –term follow-up study is not understood. Please justify why relevant follow-up data 
for these 14 patients were not included, or provide updated analyses including these patients. 
6.  The impact HSCT had on the OS results is not known since no sensitivity analysis of OS 
excluding patients receiving HSCT post-randomisation was provided. The MAH should provide 
sensitivity analysis exploring the impact of HSCT on the OS results. 
7.  The updated efficacy data from study B2205J should be reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Please make a proposal for inclusion of study results from the final analysis of study B2205J in 
section 5.1 of the current SmPC. 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable without clock stop.

5.  MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Clinical pharmacology 
Question 1 
A biopharmaceutics report on humoral and cellular immunogenicity will be submitted later. Please 
clarify when the report will be submitted and what the report will contain, specifically whether updated 
exposure response analysis will be conducted. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The biopharmaceutics report will be based on data from the two single-arm, multicenter clinical  
studies in pediatric and young adult r/r B-cell ALL patients, Study B2205J and pivotal Study  
CCTL019B2202 (hereafter referred to as B2202) pooled, to provide larger number of patients in the 
analysis sets and thus to increase statistical power of the biopharmaceutics evaluations  and 
correlative analyses. The report will be submitted with the final CSR for Study B2202 (estimated in 
2022, the study completion depends on last patient last visit date) and will contain analyses of product 
characteristics as well as correlations between cellular kinetics, dose efficacy and safety endpoints. For 
updated exposure response analysis, please see response to Question 2.   
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has provided the estimated submission date and a brief overview of the content of the 
biopharmaceutical analysis, please refer also to question 2.  
Issue resolved. 
Question 2 
Please clarify the approach for assessing the clinical relevance of the trend for difference in exposure-
response between responders and non-responders as more data come available. Specifically, the 
following point should be addressed for updated exposure-response analysis and any implications of 
new results for the dosing rationale should be discussed: 
a)  exposure categorized into quartiles  
b)  additional analyses to re-evaluate the relationship between exposure parameters (preferably 
considering all potentially important exposure parameters, including AUC0-28d, AUC0-84d and 
Cmax, unless otherwise justified) and PFS, EFS (i.e. as in the initial MAA submission) as well as 
DOR.  
c)  tumor burden and the actual dose administered to the individual patients. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Cellular kinetic concentrations and parameters have been summarized by response category in the 
B2205J final CSR (dated 12-Nov-2019), showing consistent trends with responders having higher 
exposure than non-responders but with overlapping distributions. The Kymriah SmPC reflects the 
cellular kinetics data in paediatric and young adult B cell ALL patients based on a pool of studies B2202 
and B2205J. These data have been recently updated (SmPC dated 03-  Mar-2020) in the context of 
procedure EMEA/H/C/004090/II/0013/G based on data cut-off  dates of 13-Apr-2018 for Study B2202 
and 06-Oct-2017 for Study B2205J (second interim CSR). The procedure also contained Module 2.7.2 
“Addendum to Summary of Clinical Pharmacology Studies in Pediatric and Young Adult 
Relapsed/Refractory (r/r) B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)” based on the respective data

cut-off dates of Studies B2202 and B2205J. Five additional patients were infused in Study B2205J 
between the 06-Oct-2017 data cut-off date for the second interim CSR and the 24-May-2019 cut-off 
date for the final CSR. Based on the totality of current data, Novartis considers that pharmacological 
conclusions remain unchanged.  
Quartile based exposure analyses as well as efficacy analyses on DOR using pooled data from Studies 
B2205J and B2202 will be updated at the conclusion of Study B2202 and will be included in an 
additional report. Dose-response and dose-safety analysis will also be updated. Sensitivity analyses will 
be run to investigate the impact of baseline tumor burden considering the caveat that tumor burden 
may have changed between the time of collection and the time of infusion due to bridging and/or 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The plan for updated exposure-response analysis has been clarified as requested and an additional 
report with the requested analysis will be submitted upon the conclusion of Study B2202. Regarding 
the sensitivity analysis on impact of tumor burden; if data is available on tumor burden at the time of 
administration for all/some of the patients, these should be included in the analysis.  
Issue resolved. 
Efficacy 
Question 3 
Please provide an overview of the demographics, baseline disease status and disease history for all the 
enrolled patients (N=75), including those who did not receive the study drug, as these comprises the 
intention-to-treat (ITT) population. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Demographics, baseline disease status for the enrolled set are displayed at the [B2205J final CSR - 
Tables 14.1-4.1] and [B2205J final CSR – Table 14.1-4.4]. The MAH also provided an additional table, 
i.e. Table 2-1 that depicts the primary disease history and prior antineoplastic therapies for the 
enrolled set. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has submitted the requested data on the demographics and baseline disease characteristics 
for the enrolled set, including information on primary disease history and prior antineoplastic therapies. 
A summary of demographics and baseline disease history for all patients who were enrolled (the 
enrolled set) and those who received tisagenlecleucel infusion (the infused set) in study B2205J are

Overall, the baseline data between the enrolled and infused sets appear to be quite similar. However, 
the submitted data reveal that a higher proportion from the two older age groups (82%; 9/11) and 
male patients (91%; 10/11) are those who drop out after enrolment in study B2205J before receiving 
the study treatment. Thus, among the patients who received tisagenlecleucel a slightly higher 
proportion of 53% were female patients. In comparison constituted the male patients with 57% the 
majority of the infused patients in the pivotal study B2202. Furthermore, the patients enrolled in study 
B2205J compared to the pivotal study B2202 were slightly older with the majority of the patients in the 
≥10 to <18 years of age group (52 vs. 41%). In addition, a higher proportion of the enrolled patients 
had not underwent a prior HSCT compared to those enrolled in study B2202 (57% vs. 40%). The 
median numbers of previous therapies patients had received were identical between the two studies, 
i.e. 3 (range: 1-9), and a similar proportion of approximately 90% of all the enrolled patients had 
relapsed disease. Thus, despite some differences as outlined above, the demographics, baseline 
disease status and disease history of the included patient population in study B2205J appear to be 
representative for the current approved indication of patients with r/r B-cell ALL. 
Issue clarified.

Question 4 
Please provide data describing the proportion of patients who received bridging- and lymphodepleting 
therapies and further specify which therapy combinations were selected for the patient population in 
the FAS. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Historically, lymphodepleting (LD) agents before adoptive T-cell therapy were selected based on clinical 
experience from single agent and combination chemotherapies and include the alkylating agent 
cyclophosphamide and the family of nucleoside analogues, encompassing the pyrimidine nucleoside 
cytarabine and the purine nucleosides cladribine, pentostatin and fludarabine that demonstrate potent 
cytotoxic activity (Lowe, 2018). In the early paediatric ALL studies of tisagenlecleucel, the use of LD 
chemotherapy prior to infusion was recommended but left at the discretion of the investigator, and the 
regimen of choice was dependent on the patient’s underlying disease and prior therapies. Thirteen out 
of the first 16 patients infused with tisagenlecleucel received a LD conditioning regimen prior to 
adoptive transfer of T cells. Six patients received a LD-conditioning regimen consisting of 
cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, five patients received cyclophosphamide and etoposide, one 
patient received etoposide and cytarabine and one patient received cyclophosphamide alone. Based on 
this experience, cyclophosphamide and fludarabine was chosen as the regimen of choice. However, for 
patients with prior history of Grade 4 haemorrhagic cystitis with cyclophosphamide, or if the patient 
demonstrated a chemo refractory state to a cyclophosphamide-containing regimen administered 
shortly before LD chemotherapy, cytarabine and etoposide was recommended. Both cytarabine and 
etoposide are part of the treatment guidelines to treat patients with ALL and have myelosupressive 
effects, including lymphodepletion (NCCN Guidelines, Cytarabine and Etoposide prescribing 
information). 
In study B2205J, four infused patients did not receive LD chemotherapy as per protocol criteria, since 
WBC were ≤1000 within one week prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. One patient received a regimen of 
both cytarabine and etoposide as LD regimen. All remaining patients received the combination of 
cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, including one patient who received both regimens, first LD 
chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (from D-14 to D-11). However, the 
patient still had an elevated blast count observed in the peripheral blood and an alternate regimen of 
LD chemotherapy was given with cytarabine and etoposide (150 mg/m2) from D-7 to D-5. All other 
patients received fludarabine in combination with cyclophosphamide as LD regimen. 
Concerning bridging therapy, the use of any additional chemotherapy prior to the LD chemotherapy 
was at the discretion of the investigator and dependent on the patient’s disease burden. Table 14 
below lists the proportion of patients in the FAS who received both bridging- and LD therapies prior to 
tisagenlecleucel infusion. An overview of the breakdown of concomitant antineoplastic therapy before 
LD therapy by ATC class and preferred term, by whether patient received study infusion has been 
submitted. In total, 83% in the FAS received both bridging- and LD chemotherapies. Patient level data 
for these patients on concomitant antineoplastic therapy prior to start of infusion were provided.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH explain how the selection of an appropriate LD chemotherapy regimen has evolved during 
conductance of the early paediatric ALL studies of tisagenlecleucel. The use of LD chemotherapy prior 
to infusion was recommended in these studies, but the regimen of choice was left at the discretion of 
the investigator, and was dependent on the patient’s underlying disease and prior therapies. Based on 
experiences from these studies, cyclophosphamide in combination with fludarabine have been chosen 
as the preferred LD regimen. 
Among the 64 patients who received tisagenlecleucel, 57 patients (89%) received bridging therapy 
while waiting for the infusion. This is the same proportion as has been reported in the pivotal study 
B2202 (87%; 69/79). The most common concomitant antineoplastic medications used before LD 
therapy in study B2205J were methotrexate (70%), vincristine (53%), cytarabine (42%), etoposide 
(36%), and mercaptopurine (34%), either used alone or in combination. Similarly, in study B2202 
were methotrexate (66%), cytarabine (65%), vincristine (57%), etoposide and mercaptopurine (34% 
of each), and dexamethasone (33%) the most common bridging therapies used by the infused 
patients. 
In total, 94% (60/64) of the patients who received tisagenlecleucel received LD chemotherapy after 
enrolment and prior to infusion in order to facilitate engraftment and homeostatic expansion of 
tisagenlecleucel. This proportion is similar to that reported in study B2202 (96%; 76/79). The most 
common LD therapies were fludarabine (30 mg/m2 iv daily for 4 doses) and cyclophosphamide (500 
mg/m2 iv daily for 2 doses starting with the first dose of fludarabine) each used in 92% of the infused 
patients as recommended by the protocol. The protocol defined alternative LD therapies of cytarabine 
(500 mg/m2 iv daily for 2 days) and etoposide (150 mg/m2 iv daily for 3 days starting with the first 
dose of cytarabine, e.g. for patients who had previous grade 4 haemorrhagic cystitis with 
cyclophosphamide) were each used in only 2 patients, i.e. 3% of the infused patients. In total, 6% 
(4/64) of the infused patients did not receive any LD chemotherapy as they had WBC ≤1000 within 
one week prior to infusion. The most common LD therapies used in study B2202 were also fludarabine 
and cyclophosphamide, each used in 95% of the infused patients. The alternative LD therapies of 
cytarabine and etoposide were infrequently used, each in only one patient. Three patients in this study 
did not receive any LD therapy. 
In summary, the proportions of patients reported to have been receiving bridging- and LD therapies 
and the type of chemotherapy combinations the infused patients received appear to be similar in the 
two paediatric B-cell ALL studies B2205J and B2202. 
Issue resolved. 
Question 5 
The rationale for censoring the 14 patients for OS follow up in the final analysis who switched to the 
long–term follow-up study is not understood. Please justify why relevant follow-up data for these 14 
patients were not included, or provide updated analyses including these patients. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
This report concerns study B2205J and therefore includes information only from the B2205J database 
with a DCO of 24-May-2019 and locked on 18-Jul-2019. At the time of study closure, patients in 
primary follow-up had the option to transition to the long-term follow up study A2205B and were 
censored for events at the time of their last contact date. Considering that survival status was updated 
every 3 months, those patients whose last contact date was at least 105 days (i.e., 3 months plus 2

weeks, assuming 1 month = 30.4375 days) earlier than the analysis DCO of 24-May-2019 were 
categorized as lost to follow-up. 
There were 14 patients in this category and their follow-up data after the transition was not included in 
the OS analysis in the B2205J final analysis. For the 14 patients censored as lost to follow-up and 
transitioned to A2205B, relevant follow-up data (including an updated OS analysis for all infused 
patients in study B2205J) will be submitted exceptionally if requested as part of the upcoming annual 
report for the A2205B study, which will be appended to the next PSUR (PSUR4 with a reporting interval 
13-Feb-2020 to 12-Aug-2020). Individual patient data at the time of transition to study A2205B has 
been provided. 
Novartis acknowledges the Agency’s comment about the relevance of the appropriate follow-up data 
for these 14 patients and the impact on the interpretation of the overall survival curve. Note that in the 
B2205J final CSR it is stated that the OS curve beyond 24 months should be interpreted with caution 
(including the estimated median OS), since it was at about 24 follow-up that the 14 subjects 
discontinued the trial in order to switch to the long-term follow-up study. This meant a low number of 
subjects at risk, and less reliable survival estimates. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has clarified the rationale for censoring for OS follow up in the final analysis for the 14 
patients who switched to the long–term follow-up study A2205B and have provided individual patient 
data at the time of transition for these 14 patients. However, no updated OS analyses including these 
patients have been submitted. The MAH’s approach to define patients that transitioned to study 
A2205B as “lost–to-follow-up” and therefore censoring them in the final OS analysis in study B2205J is 
not supported. In total, 13 of the 14 patients had confirmed an overall response of CR or CRi at the 
latest assessment before transition to the long-term follow up study. According to the reported 
individual patient level data, 8 of these patients have been censored for OS in study B2205J as far 
back as from 2015-2018, meaning a considerably long time before the last DCO of 24-May 2019. 
Several of these patients, i.e. 6 patients, were censored approximately one year or less after infusion 
with tisagenlecleucel. 
In the final OS analysis of study B2205J, there are only 14 patients "at risk" at 24 months follow-up 
among the total 64 infused patients and 30 reported deaths (See Fig 6). It is noted that there is 
frequent censoring in the OS KM curve during 12-24 months and few reported deaths in the same time 
interval. If only a few of the 14 patients who transitioned to the follow-up study and were decided by 
the MAH to be censored for OS actually died before the last DCO, this would impact the OS curve. 
Standard requirements in a setting with a rather high proportion of “lost to follow-up” for OS, would be 
to submit a conservative sensitivity analysis and discuss the impact of a scenario where censoring is 
linked to an unfavourable clinical outcome. 
An updated OS analysis for study B2205J (including both the ITT, i.e. the enrolled patient population, 
and the FAS population) with the latest possible survival status for the 14 patients transitioned to the 
follow-up study should be provided and included in an updated version of section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Issue not pursued further in this procedure.

Question 6 
The impact HSCT had on the OS results is not known since no sensitivity analysis of OS excluding 
patients receiving HSCT post-randomisation was provided. The MAH should provide sensitivity analysis 
exploring the impact of HSCT on the OS results. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Sensitivity analysis exploring the impact of HSCT on the OS results are shown in the table below. There 
is no difference in overall survival if patients that received HSCT post infusion are excluded or censored 
at the time of HSCT. 
Table 15. Overall survival (OS) (FAS) 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Based on the new data provided, 9 of the 64 infused patients proceeded to HSCT during the study, i.e. 
number of patients in FAS OS compared to number of patients in FAS OS excluding patients receiving 
HSCT. According to the final CSR report, only 4 patients were censored due to HSCT in the DOR 
analysis, whereas 6 patients were censored due to HSCT in the EFS analysis. 
No individual patient data for patients proceeding to HSCT has been provided and the dates of 
censoring for OS are not known. Patients may have progressed or been censored for other primary 
reasons than HSCT in the DOR and EFS analysis, for instance due to “New cancer therapy other than 
HCST”, and later proceeded to HSCT and therefore censored in the OS analysis. The proportion of

patient proceeding to HSCT constitutes only 14% (9/64) of the total FAS population and the exclusion 
or censoring of these patients in the analyses seems to have no impact on event-free probability 
estimates at different time points or on the median OS. 
Issue resolved. 
Question 7 
The updated efficacy data from study B2205J should be reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Please 
make a proposal for inclusion of study results from the final analysis of study B2205J in section 5.1 of 
the current SmPC. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
In the original marketing authorization application of Kymriah, Novartis suggested inclusion of study 
B2205J data as supportive information. During review of the MAA, it was agreed with EMA that the 
presentation of efficacy and safety data in the SmPC should focus on the pivotal study B2202 and data 
related to supportive study B2205J were removed. The SmPC was recently updated (03-Mar-2020) 
with safety and efficacy data from study B2202 including longer follow-up of patients compared to the 
original SmPC. The final results of study B2205J do not provide new information in respect to efficacy/ 
safety of tisagenlecleucel in the paediatric population and the benefit risk profile remains positive, so 
no update to the SmPC is warranted. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
It is acknowledged that the presentation of the efficacy and safety data of study B2205J was agreed to 
be removed from the SmPC during the review of the MAA. At the time of the initial MA, data from only 
29 patients was available from this study and it was therefore concluded during the review that the 
data from study B2205J were immature and could only be considered as supportive to the data of the 
pivotal study B2202. However, the submitted efficacy results from the final analysis of study B2205J 
are considered sufficiently mature and further support the data underlying the approved indication of 
Kymriah for patients with r/r B-cell ALL. 
As already discussed in the assessment report above, a University of Pennsylvania manufacturing 
process was used for the manufacturing of tisagenlecleucel for the first 29 batches included in the IA1, 
whereas a Novartis manufacturing process was used thereafter for the manufacturing of CAR T-cells to 
the rest of the patients enrolled in study B2205J. The results of the IA1 were therefore solely based on 
tisagenlecleucel products produced by using the University of Pennsylvannia manufacturing process, 
whereas the final analysis was based on patients receiving tisagenlecleucel from the Novartis 
manufacturing process as well. In relation to the assessment of the manufacturing process 
development for tisagenlecleucel, covering several process versions, the CAT/CHMP have concluded 
that the quality data for the most significant changes associated with the various options introduced for 
starting material processing and transfer of the process from the initial manufacturing site to MP, did 
not indicate that the changes had any major impact on product composition and comparability. 
It is agreed that the final study results of study B2205J do not change, but rather confirm the 
favourable benefit-risk conclusion of Kymriah in the currently approved ALL indication. Study B2205J 
was designed to either demonstrate or support the efficacy and safety of tisagenlecleucel in paediatric 
and young adult patients with B-cell ALL who had relapsed or were refractory to prior therapies. 
Although it was planned to include patients with relapsed or refractory paediatric B-cell ALL and 
lymphoblastic lymphoma in study B2205J were only patients with ALL enrolled. Thus, study B2205J 
had similar study design and enrolled comparable patient populations with r/r B-cell ALL as the pivotal

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

study B2202. Two different manufacturing processes were used in study B2205J, but the differences in 
these processes have earlier been concluded by the CAT/CHMP to not have had any major impact on 
product quality and comparability. In addition, the efficacy results from the final analysis are consistent 
with the IA1 reported at the time of initial MA, the final data included almost the double of patients 
with r/r B-cell ALL compared to the IA1 and contained more mature data from the target patient 
population. On these grounds, the MAH is strongly recommended to update section 5.1 of the SmPC 
with the final results from the complete data set of study B2205J. 
The procedure is concluded and there is no request for more information. However, the MAH 
should commit to submit an application for a variation to update section 5.1 of the SmPC 
with the complete data set of the paediatric B-cell ALL study B2205J.

1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

The European Commission triggered a referral under 
12/11/2020 
19/02/2021 
Annex II 
Please refer to the assessment report:  
Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC and requested the 
CHMP to assess the impact of nitrosamine impurities 
on the benefit-risk balance of valsartan-containing 
medicinal products and to issue a recommendation 
on whether the relevant marketing authorisations 
should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
During the CHMP plenary meeting in September 
2018, the scope of the referral has been widened to 
include all sartans with a tetrazole group in their 
molecular structure (candesartan, irbesartan, 
losartan, olmesartan and valsartan). The CHMP 
Opinion was issued on 31 January 2019 and the 
Commission Decision was issued on 2 April 2019. 
In a letter dated 29 July 2020, the European 
Commission requested the EMA to assess the impact 
of the outcome of the Article 5(3) assessment on 
nitrosamines adopted on 25 June 2020 on the 
CHMP’s opinion of 31 January 2019 for the scientific 
assessment and review under Article 31 of Directive 
2001/83/EC regarding angiotensin-II-receptor 
antagonists (sartans) containing a tetrazole group 
(EMEA/H/A-31/1471). The CHMP was requested to 
give its recommendation whether the conditions of 
the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

Based on the CHMP review of the available information and 
on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
the CHMP was of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit risk profile of Irbesartan 
Winthrop continues to be favourable.  
The CHMP recommended the renewal of the Marketing

Authorisation for Irbesartan Winthrop, subject to the 
conditions as laid down in Annex II to the Opinion. The 
CHMP was also of the opinion that the renewal can be 
granted with unlimited validity. 
The renewal required no amendments to the terms of the 
Community Marketing Authorisation.

Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in

irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 
mg/kg/day), including mortality at the highest dose. No 
significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, 
or live fetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect 
survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. Studies

Available data regarding use of AIIRAs during lactation 
4.3 and 4.6 as well as PL section 2 to implement the 
CHMP recommendation on a harmonised labelling 
relating to the use of Angiotensin II Receptor 
Antagonists during pregnancy and lactation. 
Furthermore, minor typographical changes have 
been introduced to SPC section 4.4. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
have been assessed. There are no concrete data to support 
the contraindication of use of AIIRAs during breast-feeding. 
All AIIRA agents were found in the milk of lactating rats but 
no human data about their transfer into breast milk are 
available. There is only a theoretical presumption of low 
transport according to their high plasma protein binding 
and low oral availability. A harmonised wording 
recommending an alternative treatment with better 
established safety profiles during breast-feeding, especially 
while nursing a newborn or preterm infant, has been 
included in the section 4.6 of the SPC and section 2 of the 
PL.

Cooper’s study published in the NEJM in June 2006 
4.3, 4.4, and 4.6 as well as PL section 2 to 
implement the CHMP recommendation on a 
harmonised labelling relating to the use of ACE 
inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists 
during pregnancy. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
identified a signal of increased risk of congenital 
malformations, particularly cardiac defects after exposure 
to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy. 
Since the role of confounding factors such as diabetes and 
hypertension cannot be accurately defined based on the 
available data, the teratogenic potential of ACE inhibitors is 
not demonstrated, even though data suggest that such 
exposure cannot be considered as safe and should be 
avoided.

There are fewer data regarding the risks associated with 
first trimester exposure to Angiotensin II receptor 
antagonists (AIIRAs) than for ACE inhibitors. Nevertheless, 
there is no evidence that the risk is lower for AIIRAs, and it 
is considered that any conclusions on ACE inhibitors are 
also valid for AIIRAs. 
Therefore, the existing contraindication for the 2nd and 3rd 
trimester of pregnancy remained, but a harmonised 
wording regarding pregnancy across the class was 
introduced.

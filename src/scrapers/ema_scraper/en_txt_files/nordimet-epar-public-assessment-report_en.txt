Figure 1. Structural formula of methotrexate. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/527385/2016 
Page 7/21 
  
  
 
 
 
The active substance is a yellow or orange, crystalline, hygroscopic powder. It is practically insoluble in 
water, in ethanol (96 per cent) and in methylene chloride. It dissolves in dilute mineral acids and in dilute 
solutions of alkali hydroxides and carbonates 
Methotrexate exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. The active substance 
corresponds to the (S) stereoisomer. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC. 
As there is a monograph of methotrexate in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the active 
substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for the active 
substance which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
Specification 
The active substance specification is in line with the current version of the Ph. Eur. monograph for 
methotrexate. It includes tests for appearance, identification (IR), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), 
enantiomeric purity (HPLC), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), water (Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), and is 
supplemented with a residual solvent test for ethanol (GC) and a test for bacterial endotoxin (Ph. Eur.) 
The information concerning the analytical procedures is covered in the CEP. The additional in-house head 
space gas chromatography method to control the level of ethanol in methotrexate drug substance is also 
included in the CEP. 
Batch analysis data from two commercial scale batches of the active substance analysed by both the active 
substance and the finished product manufacturer were provided. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
The active substance manufacturer and finished product manufacturer use chemical reference substances 
from EDQM (EP CRS) for testing the active substance. 
Stability 
The stability program and results obtained were assessed by EDQM and the re-test period and storage 
conditions are included the CEP. The re-test period of the active substance is 5 years if stored in double 
polyethylene bag with outer black bag in fiber drum. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product consists of a clear, yellow 25 mg/ml methotrexate solution for injection with a pH of 8.0-
9.0 and an osmolality of approximately 300 mOsm/kg, in pre-fill pen (0.3-1.0 ml filling volume).  
1 ml of solution contains 25 mg methotrexate 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/527385/2016 
Page 8/21 
  
  
 
1 pre-filled pen of 0.3 ml contains 7.5 mg methotrexate. 
1 pre-filled pen of 0.4 ml contains 10 mg methotrexate. 
1 pre-filled pen of 0.5 ml contains 12.5 mg methotrexate. 
1 pre-filled pen of 0.6 ml contains 15 mg methotrexate. 
1 pre-filled pen of 0.7 ml contains 17.5 mg methotrexate. 
1 pre-filled pen of 0.8 ml contains 20 mg methotrexate. 
1 pre-filled pen of 0.9 ml contains 22.5 mg methotrexate. 
1 pre-filled pen of 1.0 ml contains 25 mg methotrexate. 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a methotrexate solution for injection in pre-filled 
syringes hybrid to the reference product Lantarel FS 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg and 25 mg, with three 
additional strengths: 12.5 mg, 17.5 mg and 22.5 mg. 
Since the manufacturer already had experience with the manufacture of methotrexate 25 mg/ml solution for 
injection in vials, the development focused on the feasibility to produce finished product in pre-filled syringes. 
A concentration of 25 mg/ml was used with the aim to fill standard 1 ml syringes to levels of 0.3–1.0 ml. The 
development work focused on the development and validation of analytical methods, the development and 
testing of the filling process at pilot scale, the accelerated stability testing, the stopper testing, the production 
of validation batches and the stability testing of validation batches. 
As methotrexate 25 mg/ml solution for injection is a USP and BP compendial product composed of 
methotrexate active substance dissolved in an isotonic aqueous solution of sodium chloride, adjusted for pH 
with sodium hydroxide, compatibility studies between the active substance and the excipients were not 
conducted. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. 
Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Nonetheless, specific confirmatory studies to define target points for pH for the bulk solution, osmolality and 
density were conducted. The selection of the target pH for the bulk solution was based on the specification 
from the USP and BP (being 7.0–9.0), the actual solubility of methotrexate, its stability and the 
physiologically compatible limits. Based on these, a target pH of 8.2 ± 0.1 was selected. The confirmatory 
study for osmolality was in line with the expected outcome. Finally, a specific study was undertaken in order 
to assess the influence of temperature on the density of a 25 mg/ml methotrexate solution, since the final 
volume adjustment during the manufacturing process was anticipated to be carried out by weight 
adjustment. The density of the solution was determined against water at three different temperature points.  
The main focus of the manufacturing process development was the syringes filling operation. The 0.3 and 1.0 
ml filling volumes were selected to conduct these studies since they represent the extremes of the whole 
range of the fill volumes for the proposed syringes. Process validation data from three batches of each fill 
volume were presented. All six batches met all acceptance criteria and were found acceptable. 
With regards to the choice of the sterilization method, the use of sterile filtration has been justified based on 
the observed degradation of the product under heat sterilization (121 °C for 15 min), and stability data on 
the product sterilized by filtration stored under long term, intermediate and accelerated conditions.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/527385/2016 
Page 9/21 
  
  
In-process controls for microbial contamination and bioburden are used, and conformance with relevant Ph. 
Eur. monographs has been confirmed. 
Packaging materials for the product were selected based on the physicochemical properties of the active 
substance, the dosage form, stability of the finished product and the marketing requirements. The primary 
packaging selected is a 1 ml type I glass syringe with attached stainless steel needle and a chlorobutyl rubber 
plunger stopper. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The rationale for the selection of 
the components has been presented. During development two different halobutyl plunger stoppers were 
tested for the chosen syringe barrel. Based on the results from a stability study on a bulk solution of 
methotrexate 25 mg/ml filled in syringes with different plunger stoppers, the chlorobutyl rubber plunger 
stopper was selected for commercial use. 
The syringes are placed in a disposable, fixed, single dose unit pen designed to accommodate all registered 
strengths. To assess the long-term functionality of the pen to deliver the correct volume of the formulation, 
long term, intermediate and accelerated stability studies conforming to current ICH guidelines were 
performed. These are described in the stability section of this report. Briefly, samples from 3 batches of 0.3 
ml, 0.6 ml and 1.0 ml filling volumes were tested for identity (IR), extractable volume and container closure 
integrity testing. All samples met the specifications at all time points. Therefore, the choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of the finished product consists of four main steps: compounding and pH 
adjustment, sterilization of the bulk solution by membrane filtration, filling into syringes and packaging. The 
process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
The manufacturing process is carried out in clean and/or sterile areas reserved for the manufacture of 
parenteral solutions. The compounding and pH adjustment of the solution are carried out in Class C clean 
room environment. The sterilization and filling of the syringes are carried out in Class A/B clean room 
environment. 
The bioburden of solution is checked prior to filtration through the first filter. The integrity of both filters is 
checked after filtration. 
The manufacturing process and IPCs correspond to the actual standards of pharmaceutical technology and 
are suitable to guarantee an appropriate quality of the finished product.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. Data from six pilot 
scale batches (three with a fill volume of 0.3 ml and three with a fill volume of 1 ml)  have been presented.  
Although some OOS results were observed, these were investigated and it was concluded that they did not 
affect the process or the intrinsic quality of the product. Based on the data presented and the justification 
from the OOS it was concluded that the capability of the manufacturing process to produce finished product 
of intended quality in a reproducible manner was demonstrated.  
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance 
(methotrexate solution and pen), identification (IR, UPLC), extractable volume, pH, syringe integrity, sub-
visible and visible particles, assay (UPLC), related substances (UPLC) uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/527385/2016 
Page 10/21 
  
  
sterility (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). It also includes autoinjector functionality 
specifications: extractable volume, injection time, cap removal force and needle extension.  
Acceptable justification has been presented to omit colour of solution from the specification. The colour of the 
methotrexate solution is bright yellow. The colour is very intense and was found to be far outside the range 
described in Ph. Eur. 2.2.2. No colour change had been observed in any batches throughout the shelf-life. 
Additionally, during photostability testing the colour of dark and exposed samples showed no non-
compliances. The same is applicable for long term stability samples. Therefore it was concluded that the 
colour was not critical for the quality of the product. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for nine batches three batches of product with 0.3 ml fill volume, three batches of 
product with 1.0 ml fill volume and three commercial batches with different fill volumes (1.0 ml, 0.6 ml, 0.3 
ml) confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification have been provided. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of six pilot scale batches (three with 0.3 ml fill volume, three with 1.0 ml fill volume) and three 
commercial scale batches (with fill volumes of 0.3 ml, 0.6 ml or 1.0 ml) of finished product  stored under long 
term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH for up to 36 months, under intermediate conditions 30 ºC / 65% RH for 
up to 12 months, and under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH for up to 6 months according to the 
ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, identification, extractable volume, pH, integrity test, sub-visible 
particles, visible particles, assay, related substances, uniformity of dosage units, sterility and bacterial 
endotoxins. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
The studies conducted on the pilot scale batches showed satisfactory stability up to 30 months of storage 
under long term conditions, but some OOS results were observed for all the batches at the 36 month time- 
point. A borderline OOS result was observed in one of the pilot scale batches at 6 months. This result was 
attributed to a combination of relatively high content at release and analytical variation. Studies under 
accelerated conditions showed some OOS results after 6 months of storage.  Studies under intermediate 
conditions showed satisfactory stability after 12 months of storage. 
The studies carried out on the commercial scale batches showed satisfactory stability after 24 months of 
storage under long term conditions. Although one batch showed an OOS for pH at 24 months, this was not 
observed in the same batch stored under intermediate conditions, and a reanalysis of the sample indicated 
that the original measurement was an analytical error. Studies under accelerated conditions showed OOS 
results after 6 months of storage. Studies under intermediate conditions showed satisfactory stability after 12 
months of storage.

In addition, one 1.0 ml commercial scale batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The results showed an increase in an impurity 
beyond the upper specification limit Moreover, an unknown impurity was also observed at a level close to the 
specification limit. Therefore, based on these results, it is concluded that the product should be kept 
protected from light. 
In conclusion, based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years stored below 25°C and 
keeping the pre-filled pen in the outer carton in order to protect from light as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology was submitted, based on up-
to-date scientific literature. The overview provided detailed information on the mechanism of action of 
methotrexate and thus justification that there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology data.  
The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with that of the reference product.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/527385/2016 
Page 12/21 
  
  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant submitted a phase I Enviromental Risk Assessment (ERA) based on prevalence data for each 
indication. The total PECsurface water was below 0.01 mcg/l and therefore a phase II assessment was not 
considered necessary in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of 
Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2). 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology was submitted which was 
considered adequate to justify that there is no need for additional non-clinical pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology data.  The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with that of the 
reference product.  
The CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Methotrexate is an established drug which has been used safely and effectively in humans for over 50 years 
in the European Union (EU) and USA. It is currently authorised for long-term use in children and adults by 
oral and parenteral routes of administration. The recommended starting dose in Lantarel FS,  the reference 
product used in this application, for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 7.5 mg per week which can be 
up-titrated to 15-20 mg per week. In children (from 3 years) and adolescents with polyarthritic forms of 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis the recommended dose is 10-15 mg / m2 body surface area / week which in 
exceptional cases can be increased up to 20-30 mg / m2 body surface area / week. Finally in psoriasis and 
psoriatic arthritis, the recommended initial dose after a test dose is 7.5 mg per week.  
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
The clinical pharmacokinetics of methotrexate following oral and systemic administration are well known and 
no new data on methotrexate disposition were submitted. 
Nordimet 25mg/mL solution for injection has been developed as a hybrid generic product with reference to an 
authorised methotrexate injection product which is available in the following strengths: 7.5mg, 10 mg, 
15 mg, 17.5 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg. In addition to these strengths, Nordimet will also be available as 12.5, 17.5 
and 22.5 mg, which is acceptable as the additional strengths are within the range of the reference product. 
The posology recommendations in all indications are in line with those of Lantarel FS.  
According to the CHMP Guideline on bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1), as the test product is 
an aqueous solution containing the same concentration of the same active substance and the same excipients 
in similar amounts as the medicinal product currently approved, bioequivalence can be considered 
established and no bioequivalence studies are required.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
No new pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies were submitted.  
Nordimet is to be administered as an aqueous subcutaneous injection. It has an identical qualitative and 
quantitative composition in terms of the active substance as its reference medicinal product and also contains 
the same excipients. Given the accepted bioequivalence between the proposed new product and the 
marketed reference product, the absence of new data on methotrexate absorption, distribution, metabolism, 
and excretion in the target population and its potential for drug-drug interactions is acceptable. The 
additional strengths compared to the reference product are considered acceptable, as they are within the 
range of strengths of that product and do not impact on the posology recommendations for Nordimet.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The CHMP considered that the applicant has provided sufficient justification for the lack of clinical studies 
based on the claim that Nordimet is a hybrid of the reference product Lantarel FS.   
As the product contains the same active ingredient in the same concentration and pharmaceutical formulation 
as the reference product, the lack of bioequivalence studies was considered acceptable.  
The literature data and the publicly available information presented in the dossier were considered acceptable 
and sufficient to support the use of Nordimet in the applied indications.

Pharmacovigilance  
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
PSUR submission 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Product information 
2.6.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a hybrid version of methotrexate solution for injection. Additional strengths to those 
are being proposed but which are within the ranges of strengths of the reference product.  The indications of 
the reference product Lantarel FS are in line with those of Nordimet.  
No non-clinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient, to support the use 
of Nordimet in its applied indications. 
This application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the 
efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based 
on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
A bioequivalence study was not submitted and this was considered acceptable as Nordimet contains the same 
active ingredient in the same concentration and pharmaceutical formulation using the same route of 
administration (parenteral) as the reference product. 
The CHMP, having considered the quality data provided as well as the non-clinical and clinical information 
submitted in the application, is of the opinion that Nordimet is comparable to the reference product Lantarel 
FS in the applied indications and that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information.  
Therefore, the benefit risk balance for Nordimet is considered positive.

4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Nordimet is favourable in the following indications: 
• 
• 
• 
active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients; 
polyarthritic forms of severe, active juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), when the response to  nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been inadequate; 
severe recalcitrant disabling psoriasis, which is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy such 
as phototherapy, psoralens and ultraviolet A (PUVA), and retinoids and severe psoriatic arthritis in adult 
patients. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

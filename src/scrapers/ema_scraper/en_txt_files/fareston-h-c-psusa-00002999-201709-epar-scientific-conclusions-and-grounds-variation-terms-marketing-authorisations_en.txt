Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for toremifene, the scientific conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows:  
Cumulatively  18  cases  reporting  Adverse  Drug  Reactions  (ADRs)  of  hepatic  steatosis  (16)  and  of  non-
alcoholic  steatohepatitis  (NASH)  (2)  with  toremifene  were  identified  by  the  MAH.  Six  of  them  were 
serious.  Diagnosis  of  hepatic  steatosis/NASH  was  supported  by  liver  biopsy  for  3  cases.  Latency  period 
(documented  for  7  reports)  varied  from  4  months  to  2  years.  Confounding  factors  were  present  for  2 
cases.  Positive  dechallenge  was  reported  in  four  cases  and  in  one  of  these  cases  also  rechallenge  was 
positive. Based on this review it is agreed to amend the ADR table in section 4.8 of Fareston EU SmPC to 
add the ADR hepatic steatosis, with frequency unknown. There is no need to update the package leaflet, 
considering that the ADR of hepatitis is already mentioned with “frequency not known”. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for toremifene the CHMP  is of the opinion  that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing toremifene is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

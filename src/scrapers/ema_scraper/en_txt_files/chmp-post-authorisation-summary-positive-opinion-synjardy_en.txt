On 26 January 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Synjardy. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Boehringer Ingelheim

The CHMP adopted a change to the existing indication as follows2: 
"Synjardy is indicated in for the treatment of adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus

• 
• 
• 
in patients insufficiently inadequately controlled on their maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone 
in patients inadequately controlled with metformin  combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal 
products for the treatment of diabetes, in patients insufficiently controlled with metformin 
and these medicinal products, including insulin (see sections 4.5 and 5.1 for available data on 
different combinations) 
in patients already being treated with the combination of empagliflozin and metformin as separate 
tablets. 
For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular

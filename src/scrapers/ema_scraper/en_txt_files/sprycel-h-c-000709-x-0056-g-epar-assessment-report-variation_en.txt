2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant requested the approval for the following indication:  
Sprycel is indicated for the treatment of children and adolescents aged 1 year to 18 years with  Ph+ 
chronic phase CML. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
CML is relatively rare in both adults and children, with rates increasing with increased age; rates peak 
in the age range of 65-74 years. The incidence of the disease in paediatric patients increases in teen 
years: CML constitutes 2% of all leukemias in children younger than 15 years and 9% of all leukemias 
in adolescents between 15 and 19 years, with an annual incidence of 1 and 2.2 cases per million in 
these two age groups, respectively. An estimated 12-14% of paediatric and young adult patients die 
within 5 years of CML diagnosis. Overall, the genetic basis and course of disease is similar in adult and 
paediatric CML patients. Children and adolescents tend to have a more aggressive clinical presentation 
than older adults, although the impact of this feature on progression and response to treatment in 
paediatric patients remains unknown. 
Exposure to ionizing radiation is the only known risk factor. While there is no known familial disposition 
to CML, rare families in which multiple members develop MPNs, including CML, have been described. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Chronic myeloid leukemia is a clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm derived from an abnormal 
multipotent hematopoietic stem cell that has acquired the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, usually through 
t(9;22)(q34;q11), also known as the Philadelphia chromosome. The development of chronic phase CML 
appears to be a direct result of BCR-ABL1 activity, which promotes its development by allowing: 
uncontrolled proliferation of transformed cells; discordant maturation; escape from apoptosis; altered 
interaction with the cellular matrix.  
The progression of CML from chronic phase to accelerated phase or blast crisis is a complex, multistep 
process, but also appears to involve the constitutive expression of the BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase.  
The following events appear to be necessary for the transformation of chronic phase CML into an acute 
phase of disease: Constitutive expression of the BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase; Differentiation arrest; 
Genetic instability and additional chromosomal abnormalities; Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes  
Mouse models have provided support for BCR-ABL1 as the principal cause of these malignancies and 
have allowed for the in vivo study of BCR-ABL1 signaling, identification of novel genes involved in CML 
development, and testing of potential therapies. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
CML has a triphasic or biphasic clinical course: a chronic phase, which is present at the time of 
diagnosis in approximately 85 percent of patients; an accelerated phase, in which neutrophil 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302652/2018 
Page 7/82 
  
  
differentiation becomes progressively impaired and leukocyte counts are more difficult to control with 
treatment; and blast crisis, a condition resembling acute leukemia in which myeloid or lymphoid blasts 
proliferate in an uncontrolled manner. 
The clinical findings at diagnosis of CML vary among reported series and also depend upon the stage of 
disease at diagnosis. Twenty to 50 percent of patients are asymptomatic, with the disease first being 
suspected from routine blood tests. Among symptomatic patients, systemic symptoms such as fatigue, 
malaise, weight loss, excessive sweating, abdominal fullness and bleeding episodes due to platelet 
dysfunction are common. 
Abdominal pain and discomfort may include left upper quadrant pain (sometimes referred to the left 
shoulder) and early satiety, due to the enlarged spleen with or without peri-splenitis and/or splenic 
infarction. Tenderness over the lower sternum, due to an expanding bone marrow, is sometimes seen. 
Acute gouty arthritis may also present at this time, due to overproduction of uric acid.  
Other frequent findings include splenomegaly, anemia, white blood cell count above 100,000/microL 
and platelet count above 600,000 to 700,000/microL. Involvement of extramedullary tissues such as 
the lymph nodes, skin, and soft tissues is generally limited to patients with blast crisis. 
The peripheral smear typically demonstrates a leukocytosis with a median white count of 
approximately 100,000/microL. The white blood cell differential typically shows virtually all cells of the 
neutrophilic series, from myeloblasts to mature neutrophils with peaks in the percent myelocytes and 
segmented neutrophils. Blasts typically account for less than 2 percent. The presence of a greater 
percent of myelocytes than the more mature metamyelocytes ("leukemic hiatus" or "myelocyte bulge") 
is one of the classic findings in CML. The granulocytes of chronic phase are morphologically normal 
with no evidence of dysplasia, but dysplasia can develop in more advanced disease, and particularly in 
accelerated phase. 
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy demonstrates granulocytic hyperplasia with a maturation pattern 
that reflects that seen in the peripheral smear. Other non-specific bone marrow findings include an 
increase in reticulin fibrosis and vascularity. 
The peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate differential count are key components of determining 
the disease stage. In general, peripheral blood and bone marrow blasts between 10 and 19 percent are 
diagnostic of accelerated phase disease, while blasts over 20 percent are diagnostic of blast crisis.  
The vast majority of patients (90% to 95%) demonstrate the t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) reciprocal 
translocation that results in the Ph chromosome. 
Various scoring systems have also been devised in an attempt to predict disease outcome. While the 
Sokal and Euro (Hasford) scores were developed prior to the discovery of imatinib, the EUTOS score 
was developed and validated using data from 2060 patients enrolled in prospective studies of imatinib 
and is intended to be a better predictor of clinical responses to that drug. High-risk patients defined by 
this scoring system have a one in three chance of failing to respond to imatinib. 
2.1.5.  Management 
In the EU (European Union), imatinib (Glivec) is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric 
patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl) positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid 
leukaemia (CML) for whom bone marrow transplantation is not considered as the first line of 
treatment; adult and paediatric patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha 
therapy, or in accelerated phase or blast crisis and adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302652/2018 
Page 8/82 
  
  
Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) integrated with 
chemotherapy. 
In addition, Tasigna was approved for the treatment of paediatric patients with newly diagnosed 
Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in the chronic phase and 
paediatric patients with chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome positive CML with resistance or 
intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib.  
There is a high unmet medical need for approved therapies that can improve responses in paediatric 
patients with CML-CP who received imatinib as first-line treatment. Approximately 10% to 30% of 
adult and paediatric patients with CML-CP discontinue from imatinib due to declining response to 
treatment, progression of disease, or intolerance of adverse drug effects. Options are also needed for 
newly-diagnosed subjects and before considering HSCT. Paediatric patients with no suitable donor for 
HSCT have an even more critical unmet need for disease management.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as powder for oral suspension containing 10 mg/ml of dasatinib (as 
monohydrate) as active substance.  
Other  ingredients  are:  sucrose,  carmellose  sodium,  simethicone  emulsion  (consisting  of  simethicone, 
polyethylene  glycol  sorbitan  tristearate,  polyethoxylate  stearate,  glycerides,  methylcellulose,  xanthan 
gum,  benzoic  acid,  sorbic  acid,  sulfuric  acid),  tartaric  acid,  trisodium  citrate  anhydrous,  sodium 
benzoate  (E211),  silica  hydrophobic  colloidal,  and  mixed  berry  flavour  containing  benzyl  alcohol, 
sulphur dioxide (E 220). 
The product is available in  high density polyethylene  bottle  with polypropylene  child-resistant  closure 
as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. Each pack also contains a low density polyethylene press-in-
bottle  adapter  (PIBA)  and  an  oral  dosing  syringe  (polypropylene  syringe  barrel  with  high  density 
polyethylene syringe plunger rod) in a sealed plastic bag. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance used to manufacture the new pharmaceutical form: oral suspension is the same 
as  that  used  in  the  manufacture  of  the  currently  authorised  Sprycel  film-coated  tablets 
(EU/1/06/363/001-015). 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The  finished  product  is  a  powder  for  oral  suspension  (PFOS)  containing  0.99  g  (10  mg/ml  after 
constitution) of the active substance. 
In  accordance  with  the  PIP  which  includes  the  requirement  of  an  age-appropriate  formulation,  the 
marketing authorisation holder has formulated a taste-optimized oral suspension product (powder for 
oral  suspension).  The  goal  of  the  development  of  the  powder  for  oral  suspension  was  to  provide  a 
stable, palatable, and dose uniform suspension at a concentration of 10 mg/mL upon constitution with 
water. In the selection of formulations for evaluation, consideration was given to the preferred dosage 
forms  as  outlined  in  the  EMA  Reflection  Paper,  Formulations  of  Choice  for  the  Paediatric  Population. 
Solution and suspension formulations were  considered to be preferable over other dosage forms such 
as  powders  or  chewable  tablets  in  the  targeted  age  group  of  1  to  6  years,  since  they  are  most 
acceptable for children who are not yet able to chew or swallow and they provide for greater flexibility 
in delivering variable doses. Feasibility of different formulation approaches were evaluated, including a 
ready  to-use  solution  and  powder  for  oral  solution,  however,  these  formulation  approaches  were  not 
pursued due to limited solubility of dasatinib in the vehicles and taste-masking challenges.  
The powder will be constituted with water at the pharmacy and provided to the patient as a multi-dose 
product presentation with press-in-bottle adaptor and oral dosing syringe. 
The active substance used is the crystalline monohydrate form, which is the same as that used in the 
marketed  film-coated  tablets.  Quality  risk  assessments  and  experiments  were  performed  to 
understand the compositional requirements for a  robust formulation and the  impact of manufacturing 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302652/2018 
Page 10/82 
  
  
process  parameters  on  the  identified  critical  quality  attributes  (CQAs).  Several  commonly  used 
excipients for powder for oral solution/suspension were evaluated as binary mixtures (with or without 
water)  for  compatibility  with  dasatinib.  The  levels  of  individual  and  total  impurities  were  monitored. 
Dasatinib was prone to significant degradation in the presence of certain excipients. All excipients are 
well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality  is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards with the 
exception  of  mixed  berry  flavour.  All  flavour  ingredients  contained  in  the  mixed  berry  flavour  are 
recognized as safe (GRAS). In addition, the constituents of the mixed berry flavour are listed in the EU 
list of flavouring substances as defined by Regulation EU 872/2012. There are no novel excipients used 
in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in 
paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.  
Formulation  development studies  were  performed  to  select  the  type  and  level  of  the  excipients  for  a 
palatable formulation, which, when constituted with water, would be easily dispersed and dispensed by 
the patient/care giver using the supplied oral dosing syringe.  
During  formulation  development  palatability  and  taste,  selection  of  sweetener,  selection  of  pH/buffer 
system,  suspending  agents,  preservation  system  (and  level),  antifoaming  agent,  flavouring  agent, 
constitution time and re-dispersibility time, and particle size were studied. Characteristics such as the 
pH solubility/stability profile of the active substance, chemical compatibility, and taste led to the use of 
the tartrate-based buffer system at a pH where the selected preservative is effective. Other excipients 
providing  desired  product  profile  performance  and  manufacturability  were  selected  for  evaluation 
based  on  the  drug-excipient  compatibility  study  and  the  amount  required  was  confirmed  during  the 
development studies.  
Formulation comparability studies  were  provided.   An  open-label crossover bioequivalence  (BE)  study 
was  conducted  in  fasted  adult  healthy  subjects  to  compare  the  bioavailability  of  reference  tablets, 
dasatinib PFOS and dispersed tablets 
The  applicant  has  applied  QbD  principles  in  the  development  of  the  finished  product.  However,  no 
design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the finished product 
The  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process  was  designed  to  consistently  meet  the  identified 
finished product critical quality attributes (CQAs). Risk assessments were performed at multiple stages 
throughout  development  to  guide  development  studies  and  to  establish  the  control  strategy  for  the 
commercial  manufacturing  process.  The  process  development  studies  evaluated  different 
manufacturing process parameters to determine the effect on selected product attributes. The powder 
blend is manufactured using a series of milling and blending steps followed by filling of the final powder 
blend  into  bottles.  Initial  selection  of  the  processing  steps  and  parameters  was  based  upon  prior 
knowledge and experiences gained from other powder finished products. 
Manufacturing  process  risk  assessments  throughout  process  development  to  determine  the  potential 
failure  modes  associated  with  the  manufacturing  process  and  to  quantify  the  level  of  risk  to  the 
product  quality  attributes  were  employed.  The  risk  assessments  are  used  to  guide  the  design  of  the 
process development studies so that appropriate controls and/or mitigation measures can be identified 
and  implemented  to  minimize  the  risk  to  an  acceptable  level.  For  the  proposed  commercial  process, 
process risk assessments using Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) were conducted to identify the 
level of risk in the manufacturing process 
Dasatinib  PFOS  is  supplied  in  a  120  mL  high  density  polyethylene  bottle  (with  polypropylene  child-
resistant  closure).  Each  pack  also  contains  a  low  density  polyethylene  press-in-bottle  adapter  (PIBA) 
and a 12-mL oral dosing syringe (polypropylene syringe barrel with high density polyethylene syringe 
plunger  rod)  in  a  sealed  plastic  bag.  The  material  complies  with  Ph  Eur  and  EC  requirements.  The 
Assessment report

choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is  adequate  for  the 
intended use of the product. The syringe is CE marked. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  3  main  steps:  preparation  of  milled  sucrose-simethicone 
mixture,  preparation  of  milled  sucrose,  and  preparation  of  final  blend,  filling  and,  packaging  and 
labelling operation 
A simple validation protocol is provided. No validation is provided for pilot or commercial batches. The 
prospective  process  validation  will  be  completed  prior  to  the  launch  of  the  commercial  product.  The 
validation batches will be processed according to an approved manufacturing batch record and per an 
approved process validation protocol. During the validation study, process steps will be monitored and 
the  results  will  be  documented  in  a  process  validation  report.  The  manufacturing  process  of  the 
product  is  considered  as  standard  process,  therefore,  it  is  accepted  that  only  the  validation  protocol 
suffices and that no actual process validation is provided in the dossier. 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of 
manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description  of  powder  (visual),  description  of  suspension  (visual),  identification  (HPLC,  Raman,  IR-
ATR),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities/degradants  (HPLC),  dissolution  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  mass  (Ph  Eur), 
pH, sodium benzoate (HPLC) and microbial limits (TAMC, TYMC, Escherichia Coli). 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  appropriately  validated  in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. The reference standard used in the analysis of the finished product 
is  the  same  as  used  for  the  active  substance.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference 
standards used has been presented. 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  8  commercial  batches  confirming  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The  finished  product  is  released  on  the  market  based  on  the  above  release  specifications,  through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from  3 commercial scale batches of finished product  stored  for up to  24  months  under 
long  term  conditions  (5  °C,  25  °C  /  60%  RH,  and  30  °C  /  75%RH  )  and  for  up  to  6  months  under 
accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches 
of  medicinal  product  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  appearance  of  the  suspension,  assay,  impurities,  sodium 
benzoate, dissolution, water content, pH, constitution time, identity and microbial limits (TAMC, TYMC, 
Escherichia Coli). The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
The  finished  product  shows  little  or  no  change  in  long  term  stability  studies.  All  results  meet  the 
proposed  acceptance  criteria.  In  addition,  stress  stability  studies  (-20°C,  50°C,  open  bottle,  and 
Assessment report

freeze/thaw  temperature  cycling)  were  performed  in  one  batch.    All  results  meet  the  proposed 
acceptance criteria. 
One batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances  and Products.  The photostability study results indicate that  the  product does not need to 
be protected from light. 
In-use  constitution  studies  were  performed  in  3  batches  at  the  initial  and  12  month  time  points. 
Finished product bottles were constituted with purified water, and stored for  up to 2 months at 5 °C, 
30 °C/75% RH, and for 1 month at 40°C/75%RH (initial time point only) and then tested. There was 
essentially little to no change observed and all results met the proposed acceptance criteria.  
In-use studies were also performed in 3 batches at the initial and 12 month time points for constituted 
finished  product.  Bottles  were  constituted  with  water  and  stored  at  5°C  and  30°C/75%RH.  The 
individual bottles were tested at initial and 30 days. There was essentially little to no change observed. 
The test results for both the initial and 12-month in-use studies remained essentially unchanged when 
compared with the zero-time values at the initial use-time studies. 
Food mixing studies were performed on the PFOS at initial and at 9 months (stored at 30 °C/75% RH) 
using 4 different vehicles  for mixing with the constituted dasatinib PFOS,  10  mg/mL. The constituted 
suspension  was  first  stored  for  2  months  (60  days)  at  30  °C/75%  RH,  then  2  mL  of  the  constituted 
suspension  was  mixed  with  15  grams  of  liquid  or  food/vehicle,  and  stored  for  up  to  2  hours  at 
30 °C/75% RH  and  then  tested.  There  was  essentially  little  to  no  change  observed  in  assay  (%  of 
initial), impurities, and dissolution for suspension mixed with food/liquid through 2 hours of storage at 
30 °C/75% RH. Results remained essentially unchanged at the initial and 9-month time points. 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf-life  of  the  power  is  of  24  months  stored  bellow 
25 °C , after constitution, the oral suspension is stable for 60 days when stored in a refrigerator (2 °C 
–  to  8 °C)  and  do  not  freeze  as  stated  in  the  SmPC  (section  6.3)  are  acceptable.  Constituted  oral 
suspension may be mixed with milk, yogurt, apple juice, or apple sauce and may be stored at or below 
25 °C for up to 1 hour. 
Adventitious agents 
Sucrose is the only specified risk material of animal origin, used as an excipient in the finished product. 
In  the  processing  of  sucrose,  the  manufacturer  uses  animal  bone-charcoal  as  a  filtering  agent  to 
decolorize  the  raw  sugar  and  to  produce  white  sugar  crystals.  TSE/BSE  “risk  free”  declaration  for 
animal charcoal used in the manufacturing process of sucrose was provided. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The  applicant  has  applied  QbD  principles  in  the  development  of  the  finished  product.  However,  no 
design space was claimed.

2.3.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No additional nonclinical toxicology studies were conducted with dasatinib in view of the paediatric 
indications, which is consistent with the ICH S9 guidance that states that a dedicated nonclinical 
toxicology study in juvenile animals is not needed to support a paediatric registration of anticancer 
drugs. This approach is considered acceptable.  
An updated environmental risk assessment was submitted, however further information should be 
gathered from an OECD 106 study in 3 soils; this is recommended to be provided post-authorisation. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Existing non-clinical data with dasatinib are sufficient to cover the new pharmaceutical formulation and 
use in paediatric CML patients; no new data were necessary. 
The MAH is recommended to submit additional information on the ERA following the completion of an 
OECD 106 study in 3 soils.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Bioequivalence (BE) study CA180352 
Study CA180352 was an open-label, randomized, 3-period, 3- treatment crossover study conducted in 
healthy  adult  subjects  to  compare  the  dasatinib  PFOS  to  the  intact  tablet  formulation  as  well  as  the 
same  tablet  formulation  dispersed  in  orange  juice.  There  were  77  subjects  completed  the  study.  PK 
samples were collected predose (0), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 18 and 24 hours post dose. 
Taste assessments of the PFOS were made 10 seconds and 1 minute after administration.  
Plasma PK parameters for dasatinib following a single  oral dose  of  100 mg administered  as an  intact 
tablet  (Treatment  A),  PFOS  (Treatment  B)  or  dispersed  tablet  (Treatment  C)  for  77  subjects  are 
summarized in Table 4.

PPK  analysis  of  exposure  differences  between  PFOS  72  mg/m2  and  tablet  60  mg/m2  in  paediatric 
subjects 
The  PPK  analysis  using  pooled  data  from  paediatric  clinical  studies  was  conducted  to  characterize 
dasatinib PK in paediatric subjects, and to quantify the differences in exposure produced by 72 mg/m2 
PFOS,  relative  to  60  mg/  m2  tablet.  The  effect  of  formulation  on  dasatinib  PK  showed  that  the 
bioavailability of PFOS was approximately 40%  lower than that of the tablet formulation in paediatric 
subjects. The bioavailability of PFOS (FR) was 64.4% (95% CI 47.3% -87.8%) of the intact tablet, and 
the absorption rate (KA) was 120% (95% CI 67.5% -215%) of the tablet although with wide CI which 
also crossed 1. 
PBPK simulation results for the gastric transit time sensitivity analysis of the suspension are presented

Influence of food 
In  the  paediatric  Phase  1  study  CA180018,  no  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  was  identified  across 
the tablet dose levels of 60 to 120 mg/m2  QD. In the paediatric Phase  2  study CA180226,  tablets or 
PFOS were administered irrespective of food intake, and the safety profile of dasatinib was consistent 
with the known safety profile in adult subjects with no clinically relevant safety concerns for paediatric 
subjects taking either tablet or PFOS during the first year of treatment.  
Palatability studies of PFOS 
Palatability of the PFOS  formulation was assessed in studies CA180312 (at the time of manufacture), 
CA180447  (1  year  manufacture)  and  CA180458  (2  years  post-manufacture)  by  adult  sensory

panellists, in study CA180352 by healthy adult  subjects and also in Cohort 3b in study CA180226 by 
paediatric subjects with newly diagnosed CML-CP. 
Specifically, the mixed berry-flavoured PFOS formulation was selected for further development, based 
on  the  results  of  assessing  the  taste  properties  of  API  prototype  powder  for  oral  solution  (POS)  and 
PFOS  formulations.  The  dasatinib  PFOS  exhibited  good  flavour  stability  one-year  and  two-year  post 
manufacture, both freshly constituted and after 30 and 60 days of room temperature storage.  
In the BE study CA180352, healthy adult subjects were asked to evaluate the immediate taste (within 
the first 10 seconds) and the aftertaste (after 1 minute) of the PFOS using the Palatability Assessment, 
a  5-point  taste  rating  scale  (1  =  extremely  poor;  2  =  poor;  3  =  fair;  4  =  good;  5 = excellent).  The 
majority of subjects rated the taste of the PFOS as fair to excellent within 10 seconds of dosing.  
In study CA180226, palatability assessments using a hedonic scale were conducted in conjunction with 
the morning dose of dasatinib PFOS in cohort 3b on Day 1 of Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4. The assessment was 
completed  by  a  caregiver  for  subjects  younger  than  6  years.  Paediatric  subjects  older  than  6  years 
completed  the  assessment  independently.  Subjects  older  than  6  years  that  could  not  complete  the 
assessment independently were exempt from the palatability assessment.

CA180226)
For assessment by paediatric subjects, the score of 4 (good) was most frequently reported within the 
>  12  year  age  group.  The  median  palatability  assessment  score each  week  was  3.0  (maybe  good  or 
maybe bad). 
Distribution 
In study CA180018 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PK data were available for 9 subjects. The mean 4 hour 
post-dose  CSF  concentration  of  dasatinib  in  children  and  adolescents  ranged  from  1.0  to  3.8  ng/mL 
whereas  the  mean  dasatinib  plasma  concentrations  at  the  same  time  point  ranged  from  38  to  88 
ng/mL in the same groups of subjects. Hence, in pediatric subjects, the concentrations of dasatinib in 
CSF  at  4  hours  post-dose  are  1%  -  5%  of  the  concentration  in  plasma.  In  study  CA180038  only  1 
subject had measurable concentrations in CSF, 2.3 ng/mL 2 hr post-dose on Day 7.

Elimination 
Dasatinib is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP) 3A4. Extensive study on the 
ontogeny of CYP3A4 has  showed  that the enzyme activity is low at  birth  and  reaches adult values in 
the first years of life.  One subject in the infant and toddler group was included in the analysis. 
The dasatinib metabolite, BMS-582691, was measured in study CA180018 and CA18038. It was rapidly 
formed in paediatric subjects, with the median Tmax ranging from 0.9 to 2.1 hours.  
A summary of the metabolite BMS-582691 PK by dose from study CA180038 is provided in Table 11.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Oral administration of dasatinib to  pediatric subjects resulted in systemic exposures in terms of Cmax, 
AUC(0-T),  and  AUC(INF)  that  were  consistent  with  dose  proportionality  in  the  dose  range  of  60  to  120 
mg/m2.  There  was  an  increase  (in  log  scale)  in  PK  parameters  with  increasing  dose  as  shown  by  a 
slope that was significantly different from 0 using the power models for each parameter (Table 12).  
The  PPK  analysis  showed  that  dasatinib  concentration  time  profiles  in  pediatric  subjects  can  be 
adequately  described  by  a  linear  2-compartment  model,  which  further  supports  the  dose 
proportionality of dasatinib PK in the pediatric population.

Dose-response/Exposure-response analysis of efficacy 
With the lower bioavailability of the PFOS to that of the tablet in paediatric subjects, it was important 
to  explore  the  relationship  between  efficacy  and  dasatinib  treatment  cohort  (72  mg/m2  PFOS  vs.  60 
mg/m2 tablet) in order to inform the benefit-risk assessment for the PFOS.  
D-R/E-R  analyses  were  performed  with  respect  to  two  efficacy  endpoints  in  paediatrics  subjects  with 
newly  diagnosed  CML-CP:  time  to  MMR  and  BCR-ABL  pharmacodynamics,  using  the  PK  and  efficacy 
data collected in the Phase 2 paediatric study CA180226. 
The primary endpoint CCyR was not included as only few subjects were non-responders (n=6).

The longitudinal temporal profiles of BCR-ABL transcript levels in bone marrow cells were evaluated as 
a complement to the analyses of the dichotomous endpoints of MMR. 
D-R efficacy analyses included paediatric subjects with newly diagnosed CML-CP in CA180226 Cohorts 
3a and 3b, and the E-R analysis used data only from Cohort 3b. There were 84 subjects treated with 
dasatinib,  51  (60.71%)  of  which  received  dasatinib  tablet  of  60  mg/m2  QD,  and  the  rest  (n=33) 
received dasatinib PFOS of 72 mg/m2 QD. 
Analysis of MMR 
The relationship was described by a semi-parametric CPH model. The CPH models were developed in 2 
stages.  First,  the  relationship  between  dasatinib  treatment  cohort  (PFOS  72  mg/m2  vs.  tablet  60 
mg/m2) and time to MMR was characterized in a base CPH model. Second, a full model was developed 
by incorporating effects of pre-specified variables (body weight, age and BCR-ABL levels at baseline) in 
addition  to  that  of  dasatinib  treatment  cohort.  Inferences  of  covariate  effects  were  based  on  the  full 
model. 
The parameter estimates of the full model are listed in Table 14.

The performance of full model was evaluated by comparing the model-predicted cumulative probability 
of MMR with that determined by Kaplan-Meier analyses. Figure 2 presents the evaluation results with 
respect  to  formulation,  the  main  predictor  of  interest.  The  Kaplan-Meier  curves  were  in  good 
agreement with the CPH model predictions, indicating an adequate model performance in cohorts with 
both tablet and PFOS formulations.

Figure 2: Predictive check of D-R (MMR) full model 
Analysis of BCR-ABL 
The longitudinal temporal profiles of BCR-ABL transcript levels in bone marrow cells were evaluated to 
examine patients’ response at a better resolution. 
The D-R relationship was characterized by a non-linear mixed effect model. First, the parameters that 
characterized the BCR-ABL time profiles were estimated in the base model. Second, a full model was 
developed  by  incorporating  effects  of  all  potentially  predictive  variables  (dasatinib  treatment  cohort, 
baseline age and body weight) on the dynamics parameters. Inference of covariate effects was based 
on the full model. 
BCR-ABL pharmacodynamics were described by a bi-phasic exponential function with respect to time. 
The analysis indicated that the decline rate was slightly slower in the PFOS cohort (by ~7%), however, 
the difference was not statistically significant (95 % CI 0.72 – 1.2).  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics  data  have  been  collected  in  3  clinical  studies  in  paediatric  subjects,  2  phase  1 
studies,  CA180018  and  CA180038,  and  1  phase  2  study,  CA  180226,  cohort  3b.  Included  paediatric 
subjects were mainly the target paediatric population, Ph+ CML-CP. PK in paediatric subjects has also 
been evaluated by PPK analysis.  
The  pharmacokinetics  of  dasatinib  have  been  evaluated  in  104 paediatric  patients  in  the  age  1 to 18 
years have been collected -which is adequate to characterize the PK in this population- with leukaemia 
or  solid  tumours  (72 who  received  the  tablet  formulation  and  32 who  received  the  powder  for  oral 
suspension). 
Pharmacokinetics of the tablet formulation of dasatinib were evaluated for 72 paediatric patients with 
relapsed or refractory leukaemia or solid tumours at oral doses ranging from 60 to 120 mg/m2 once 
daily and 50 to 110 mg/m2 twice daily. Data was pooled across two studies and showed that dasatinib 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302652/2018 
Page 27/82 
  
  
 
 
was rapidly absorbed. Mean Tmax was observed between 0.5 and 6 hours and mean half-life ranged 
from 2 to 5 hours across all dose levels and age groups. Dasatinib PK showed dose proportionality with 
a dose-related increase in exposure observed in paediatric patients. There was no significant difference 
of dasatinib PK between children and adolescents. The geometric means of dose-normalized dasatinib 
Cmax, AUC (0-T), and AUC (INF) appeared to be similar between children and adolescents at different 
dose levels. A PPK model-based simulation predicted that the body weight tiered dosing 
recommendation described for the tablet, in section 4.2, is expected to provide similar exposure to a 
tablet dose of 60 mg/m2. These data should be considered if patients are to switch from tablets to 
powder for oral suspension or vice versa. 
The PK characteristics of dasatinib appear to be similar in paediatric and adult subjects, and also in the 
three investigated paediatric age groups, infant/toddlers, children and adolescents. Data are limited in 
children below the age of 2 years and/or < 10 kg, but suggest a lower exposure for the youngest 
children.    
With  no  evidence  of  impact  on  efficacy  for  the  lower  exposure,  it  is  acceptable  not  to  recommend  a 
higher  dose  in  the  youngest  children.  No  effect  of  disease  type  has  been  identified.  Clearance  and 
volume of distribution increase with increase in weight, supporting the BSA-based dosing in paediatric 
subjects.  Inter-subject  variability  was  considerable  in  children  (48.4  %),  but  similar  to  that  in  adults 
(44.4 %). Dasatinib was measured in CSF 4 hours post dose with a ratio of 1- 5 %. Data are limited, 
but dasatinib distribution to CNS appears to be higher in children than in adults. 
PPK  analysis  has  showed  similar  exposure  (Cavgss,  Cminss,  Cmaxss)  between  the  60  mg/m2  dose  of  the 
tablets  in  paediatric  subjects  and  the  adult  dose  of  100  mg  QD.  The  60  mg/m2  tablet  dose  is 
considered the reference dose in paediatric subjects.  
An  age  appropriate  formulation  has  been  developed  for  paediatric  subjects  incapable  of/unwilling  to 
swallow tablets. Bioequivalence between the PFOS, dispersed tablets in orange juice and intact tablets 
has been investigated in a bioequivalence study in healthy adult subjects. The PFOS and the dispersed 
tablets were not bioequivalent to the reference tablets. In adults, AUCinf was 19 % lower for PFOS and 
dispersed tablets had a 16 % lower AUCinf compared to intact tablets. This led to a PFOS dose used in 
cohort 3b in study CA180226 of 72 mg/m2. PPK model-based simulations assessed exposure of PFOS 
in paediatric subjects, and this showed an even lower exposure of PFOS in paediatric subjects, namely 
40 % lower. A shorter gastric transit time, investigated with a PBPK model, is a plausible explanation 
for the lower exposure of both PFOS and dispersed tablets. Simulations has  predicted a PFOS dose of 
90 mg/m2 to provide similar exposure to the 60 mg/m2 tablet dose for both Cavgss, Cmin and Cmax. The 
proposed paediatric PFOS dose is therefore 90 mg/m2. The Applicant has suggested a post-marketing 
PK “window-study” to evaluate the proposed 90 mg/m2 dose.   
Food has an effect on tablet absorption in adults with reduced Cmax and higher AUC, but with negligible 
clinical relevance. This also applies to paediatric subjects, when investigated with PBPK simulations.    
A weight-tiered approach has been investigated for both PFOS and tablets, and the simulations predict 
similar exposure to the 60 mg/m2 dose in paediatric subjects.  
The palatability of the PFOS has been assessed to be “fair” in both adult and paediatric subjects with 
some variability, and the flavour is stable for up to two years after manufacture.  
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of dasatinib have been investigated in a substantial number of paediatric 
subjects, and no major issues has been identified. The use of PPK and PBPK model based simulations 
to investigate exposure, bioequivalence and food effect in this rare target population is supported. The 
models have been found to be adequate and suitable for the purposes. The genetic basis and course of 
Ph+  CML-CP  is  similar  in  adult  and  paediatric  patients.  A  similar  exposure-response  to  dasatinib  in

paediatric subjects compared to adults will support extrapolation of adult efficacy data in the proposed 
indication. 
Dose-response  and  exposure  response  analysis  have  been  conducted  with  data  from  the  phase  II 
studyThe  CA180226 in 84 paediatric subjects with newly diagnosed (treatment naïve)  CML-CP. Dose-
response  and exposure-response  has been explored  for  two efficacy-endpoints used in  CML-CP: MMR 
and  BCR-ABL.  Only  few  patients  had  dispersed  tablets  and  no  effect  on  D-R  or  E-R  analysis  is 
expected.  
No  statistically  significant  relationship  was  identified  between  dasatinib  dosage  form/exposure  and 
efficacy  with  the  dose  range  of  60  mg/m2  tablet  to  72  mg/m2  PFOS,  however,  there  was  a  trend  of 
increased  MMR  probability  and  faster  decline  of  BCR-ABL  transcript  levels  with  increasing  dasatinib 
exposure measured by Cavgss. This support the proposed increase in PFOS dose from 72 mg/m2 to 90 
mg/m2  to  match  the  exposure  of  60  mg/m2  tablets  more  closely.  No  change  in  safety  issues  can  be 
expected with the proposed higher PFOS dose. 
PFOS  is  proposed  indicated  to  pediatric  subjects  and  adult  patients  with  CML  who  cannot  swallow 
tablets.  Weight  tiered  doses  have  been  suggested  taking  into  account  the  lower  bioavailability. 
Pediatric  and  adults  patients  >  45  kg  are  likely  to  have  similar  physiology  and  for  patients  >  45  kg 
PFOS dose of 120 mg is proposed in line with the findings in the adult BE study.  
Further, it is agreed that the very low bioavailability of dasatinib following suspension administration is 
not unique to the suspension formulation, but is also observed with the dispersed tablets in adults. 
Effect of food on the bioavailability and variability of dasatinib for the suspension has not been 
investigated clinically, but the high intra-subject variability might be related to physiological variability 
in gastric pH and gastric transit time, administration under fed condition might be preferable as this 
reduces the variability for the tablets.  
The  proposed  PFOS  dose  of  90  mg/m2  is  based  on  simulations,  which  appear  to  be  justified  and 
acceptable, however, confirmation from clinical data is needed. A PK “window” study has been agreed 
with  a  finalized  CSR  in  1Q  2020.  A  WT-tiered  dosing  approach  likely  to  ease  daily  dosing  has  been 
proposed and appears to provide similar exposure with acceptable differences to the tablet reference 
60 mg/m2 to subjects < 45 kg (see RMP). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the PK data of dasatinib available in paediatric subjects with Ph+ CML-CP adequately support 
the proposed tablet dose of 60 mg/m2. An age-appropriate formulation with acceptable taste and taste 
stability has been developed.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
A post-marketing study to confirm the dasatinib exposure administering 90 mg/m2 PFOS is 
recommended. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
PPK model-based simulation was used to determine a mg/ m2 PFOS dose and weight-tiered (WT) doses 
for  both  tablet  and  PFOS,  that  can  provide  similar  exposure  to  tablet  60  mg/m2.  The  developed  full 
model was used to predict dasatinib exposure in paediatric patients at following BSA-normalized doses:

60  mg/m2  QD  given  as  tablet;  60,  72,  80,  90,  100,  110  and  120 mg/  m2  QD  given  as  PFOS.  The 
simulation  included  500  paediatric  subjects  and  assumed  a  log-normal  body  weight  distribution  as 
observed in the PPK analysis dataset. Figure 3 presents distributions of the predicted paediatric Cavgss, 
Cminss, and Cmaxss for the investigated doses of the tablet or PFOS, together with the exposure from the

Tablet – proposed dose 60 mg/m2 
In  study  CA180018,  across  the  pre-specified  dose  levels  of  60  to  120  mg/  m2  QD,  no  maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) was identified. These response rates are comparable to those at equivalent adult 
dosing  of  100  mg  QD.  The  efficacy  of  the  60  and  80  mg/m2  QD  doses  were  generally  comparable; 
however, the 60 mg/m2 dose appeared to be better tolerated than the 80 mg/m2 dose. 
Similar exposure to the dasatinib dose of 60 mg/m2 was achieved in paediatric subjects compared to 
adult  dose  of  100  mg  QD.  The  mean  observed  Cavgss  (CV%)  value  in  study  CA180018  was 
12.79 (59.1%)  ng/mL  with  60  mg/m2  QD  dasatinib,  similar  to  the  mean  (CV%)  value  of 
14.16 (20%) ng/mL  in  adults.  Similarly,  the  mean  observed  minimum  concentration  (Cmin)  ±  SD 
value was 1.8 ± 1.2 ng/mL at 24 hours post-dose for 60 mg/m2 QD in paediatric subjects, whereas in 
adults,  the  mean  steady  state  Cmin  (Cminss)  (CV%)  value  was  2.69  (26%)  ng/mL  with  100 mg QD. 
The range of the Cminss values for paediatric and adult subjects overlapped. 
Simulation was conducted to predict dasatinib exposure provided by the 60 mg/m2 tablet in paediatric 
subjects  across  their  body  weight  range.  It  showed  that  the  predicted  paediatric  exposures  (Cavgss, 
Cminss and Cmaxss) increased slightly with increasing body weight, but generally are consistent with 
the adult exposures across the body weight range observed in the paediatric clinical studies. 
The  benefit-risk  profile  at  tablet  dose  of  60  mg/m2  was  further  characterized  and  confirmed  in  the 
Phase 2 study CA180226. The high and durable responses (both cytogenetic and molecular) observed 
2
in the study at 60 mg/m
 tablet are as high as those reported for adult CML-CP treated with dasatinib 
and  for  paediatric  CML-CP  treated  with  first line  imatinib.  The  safety  profile  of  dasatinib  60 mg/m2 
tablet  in  CA180226  with  paediatric  CML-CP  subjects  was  manageable  and  generally  consistent  with 
adult  data,  except  that  there  were  no  events  of  pleural/pericardial  effusion,  pulmonary  oedema  / 
hypertension, or arterial pulmonary hypertension related to dasatinib. 
Weight-tiered (WT) dosing - tablets:  
WT-tiered  dosing  in  paediatric  patients  was  further  evaluated  by  simulating  dasatinib  exposures  for 
each  body  weight  tier  using  the  paediatric  PPK  model  (5-120  kg  with  every  5  kg  increment)  under 
various  dosing  scenarios  (tablet  dose  from  20  to  100  mg),  taking  into  account  the  available  tablet 
dosing  strengths.  The  WT-tiered  doses  were  selected  to  produce  similar  summary  steady-state 
exposures  to  target  exposures  of  the  60  mg/m2  tablet  QD,  which  have  been  demonstrated  in  study 
CA180226  to  be  safe  and  efﬁcacious  in  paediatric  Ph+  CML-CP  patients.  The  exposures  were 
considered similar if the difference in geometric mean of simulated steady-state exposures are within 
20%. Based on the simulations, tablet doses of 40 mg, 60 mg and 70 mg are suggested for paediatric 
patients weighing from 10 to <20 kg, 20 to <30 kg and 30 to <45 kg, respectively. Paediatric patients 
weighing  at  least  45  kg  should  receive  the  dose  of  100  mg  tablet.  The  tablet  formulation  is  not 
recommended for patients weighing less than 10 kg, the powder for oral suspension should be use for 
these patients.

PFOS – proposed dose  90 mg/m2 
Dasatinib PFOS has been developed for use in paediatric patients who cannot swallow tablets. The BE 
study  CA180352  characterized  the  PK  of  the  PFOS  and  evaluated  the  bioequivalence  of  dasatinib 
between  the  PFOS  or  dispersed  tablet  and  the  marketed  tablet  in  healthy  adult  subjects.  Results 
showed that the PFOS and the dispersed tablet were not bioequivalent to the intact tablet formulation. 
The exposure (by AUC[INF]) for PFOS was found to be approximately 19% less than intact tablets in 
healthy adults. 
The PPK analysis showed that dasatinib administered as PFOS resulted in ~40% lower bioavailability in 
paediatric subjects. The exposure of PFOS dose at the studied dose of 72 mg/m2 was ~30% lower than 
that of tablet dose at 60 mg/m2, and the magnitude of difference was similar across the age groups.  
The E-R analyses explored the relationship between dasatinib treatment cohort and efficacy of Cohort 
3a  with  60  mg/m2  tablet  and  Cohort  3b  with  72  mg/m2  in  the  Phase  2  study  CA180226.  Results 
showed  that  time  to  achieve  MMR  was  numerically  longer,  and  the  rate  of  decline  of  BCR-ABL  was 
numerically  slower  in  paediatric  subjects  taking  72  mg/m2  PFOS  relative  to  those  taking  60  mg/m2 
tablet, although the difference was not statistically significant. These results suggested that in order to 
optimize the benefit-risk profile of PFOS use, it is optimal to recommend a PFOS dose that can match 
the exposure of the 60 mg/m2 tablet. 
All exposure measures (Cavgss, Cminss and Cmaxss) increased with increasing dose of PFOS, in a manner 
proportional  to  dose.  Among  the  simulated  PFOS  doses,  the  Cavgss  produced  by  doses  ≤  80  mg/m2 
was  lower  than  the  reference  tablet  at  60  mg/m2.  At  90  mg/m2  and  100  mg/m2  PFOS,  Cavgss  was 
similar  to  the  reference  values,  with  less  than  10%  difference  of  geometric  mean.  At  higher  PFOS 
doses of 110 and 120 mg/m2, the Cavgss generally exceeded the reference values. A similar trend was 
observed on the distributions of Cminss and Cmaxss. The Cminss produced by 90 and 100 mg/m2 PFOS were 
similar to that of the tablet 60 mg/m2. Compared to the Cmaxss at tablet 60 mg/m2, Cmaxss at 90 mg/m2 
PFOS was similar while that at 100 mg/m2 PFOS was approximately 15% higher. 
These  simulation  results  suggested  that  among  the  examined  PFOS  doses,  90  mg/m2  provides  a 
similar exposure (<10% difference in geometric mean) to the 60 mg/m2 tablet across age groups and 
all 3 exposure measures. 
Weight-tiered dosing – PFOS: 
PPK  model-based  simulations  were  also  performed to evaluate  and  select  WT-tiered  PFOS  doses  that 
can  provide  similar  exposure  to  the  60  mg/m2  tablet.  The  same  body  weight  groups  (5-120  kg  with 
every 5 kg increment) and dosing scenarios (PFOS doses 20 to 150 mg) were explored and the same 
exposure similarity criteria (<20% difference in geometric mean) were used as those used in the WT-
tiered tablet dose selection.  
Based  on  the  simulations,  PFOS  doses  of  40  mg,  60  mg,  90  mg  and  105  mg  are  recommended  for 
paediatric  patients  weighing  from  5  to  <10  kg,  10  to  <20 kg,  20  to  <30  kg  and  30  to  <45  kg, 
respectively. Paediatric patients weighing at least 45 kg are recommended to take the dose of 120 mg 
PFOS.

Objectives 
The primary study objectives were cohort specific: 
 
To  estimate  the  major  cytogenetic  response  (MCyR)  rate  to  dasatinib  therapy  in  children  and 
adolescents with CML-CP who proved resistant to or intolerant to imatinib, representing Cohort 1, 
specifically: the rate of MCyR as defined as complete (0%) or partial (1-35% of Ph+ metaphases in 
at least 20 metaphases in bone marrow. 
 
To estimate the CHR rate in children and adolescents with Ph+ ALL, AP-CML and BP CML, who were 
resistant  to,  intolerant  to,  or  who  relapsed  after  prior  imatinib  therapy,  representing  Cohort  2, 
specifically: the rate of CHR including no more than 5% blasts in bone marrow and normal white 
blood cell count without blasts in peripheral blood. 
 
To estimate the CCyR rate to dasatinib therapy in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed 
CP-CMgL who are treatment naïve (except hydroxyurea), representing Cohort 3. 
The secondary objectives were:

was described and the role of mutations as predictors of response was explored. 
Sample size 
An exact single-stage design was used to test in each cohort whether dasatinib yielded a response rate 
that was of clinical interest. 
Cohort  1:  A  response  rate  in  excess  of  30%  for  MCyR  was  considered  of  clinical  interest.  The  study 
design  tested the  null  hypothesis that  the  true  MCyR  rate  was  less  than  or  equal  to  30%  versus  the 
alternative hypothesis that it exceeded 30%. The one-sided type I error rate was 2.5% and assuming 
a  60%  true  MCyR  rate  (30%  more  than  the  response  rate  under  the  null  hypothesis),  25  response-
evaluable subjects were required to have at  least 84% power to reject the null hypothesis. The drug 
was considered of clinical interest if there were 13 or more responders out of the total of 25 response 
evaluable subjects. 
Cohort  2:  A  response  rate  in  excess  of  15%  for  CHR  was  considered  of  clinical  interest.  The  study 
design  tested  the  null  hypothesis  that  the  true  CHR  rate  was  less  than  or  equal  to  15%  versus  the 
alternative hypothesis that it exceeded 15%. The one-sided type I error rate was 2.5% and assuming 
a 35% true CHR (20% more than the response rate under the null hypothesis), 34 response-evaluable 
subjects  were  required  to  have  at  least  80%  power  to  reject  the  null  hypothesis.  The  drug  was 
considered  of  clinical  interest  if  there  were  at  least  10  responders  out  of  the  total  of  34  Dasatinib 
response-evaluable subjects. However, given that enrollment into Cohort 2 was closed early before 34 
response  evaluable  subjects  were  treated,  analyses  with  respect  to  that  cohort  was  based  on  17 
treated  subjects.  The  drug  was  considered  of  clinical  interest  in  this  cohort  if  there  were  at  least  7 
responders out of 17 response evaluable subjects. 
Cohort  3:  A  response  rate  in  excess  of  55%  for  CCyR  was  considered  of  clinical  interest.  The  study 
design  tested  the  null  hypothesis  that  the  true  CCyR  rate  was  less  than  or  equal  to  55%  versus  the 
alternative hypothesis that it exceeded 55%. The one-sided type I error rate was 2.5% and assuming 
a  75%  true  CCyR  rate  among  newly  diagnosed  subjects  with  CP  CML  (20%  more  than  the  response 
rate  under  the  null  hypothesis),  50  response-evaluable  subjects  in  Cohort  3a  yielded  83%  power  to 
reject  the  null  hypothesis.  The  drug  was  considered  of  clinical  interest  if  there  were  35  or  more 
responders out of the total of 50 response evaluable subjects. A minimum of 30 subjects in Cohort 3b 
were administered PFOS.

Statistical methods 
For efficacy analyses, the response rates (hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular) were estimated by 
cohort (and disease) on all treated subjects along with their two-sided, 95% exact confidence intervals 
by the method of Clopper and Pearson2. 
The following data sets were used in this study: 
All  treated  subjects:  All  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  dasatinib.  Demographic,  baseline 
characteristics, safety and efficacy analyses were performed on all treated subjects. 
Mutation  data  set:  All  available  mutation data  from  subjects  who  received  dasatinib  were  included  in 
the mutation data set. 
PK  data  set:  All  available  PK  data  from  subjects  in  Cohort  3b  who  received  dasatinib  PFOS  were 
included in the PK data set. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Of the 145 subjects that were enrolled, 130 subjects were treated with dasatinib: 
  29 subjects in Cohort 1: CML-CP 
  17 subjects in Cohort 2: Advanced CML and Ph+ ALL 
  8 subjects with BP-CML 
  9 subjects with Ph+ ALL 
  84 subjects in Cohort 3: Treatment Naive CML-CP 
  51 subjects in Cohort 3a (tablet) 
  33 subjects in Cohort 3b (PFOS) 
Of  the  130  treated  subjects,  50  subjects  entered  follow-up:  14  subjects  in  Cohort  1  (48.3%),  13 
subjects in Cohort 2 (76.5%), 14 subjects (27.5%) in Cohort 3a, and 9 subjects (27.3%) in Cohort 3b. 
Of the 50 subjects that entered follow-up, the most common reason for the end of follow-up in Cohort 
1  was  other  (2  subjects  [6.9%])  specified  as  patient  transferred  to  adult  unit  and  bone  marrow  
transplant,  Additionally,  in  Cohort  2  the  most  common  reason  for  the  end  of  follow-up  was  death  (8 
subjects  [47.1%]).  Finally  in  Cohort  3a,  the  most  common  reason  for  the  end  of  follow-up  was 
withdrawal by subject (4 subjects [7.8%]).

Figure 5 
The  median  duration  of  dasatinib  therapy  in  each  cohort  was  as  follows:  Cohort  1  (49.91  months), 
Cohort 2 (3.22 months) and Cohort 3 (42.30 months). Within the sub-cohorts of Cohort 3, the median 
duration of dasatinib therapy in Cohort 3a was 52.24 months, and in Cohort 3b was 27.40 months. As 
of  the  data  cutoff  for  this  report,  a  total  of  76  subjects  (58.5%)  were  still  receiving  study  drug:  14 
subjects (48.3%) in Cohort 1, 1 subject (11.1%) in Cohort 2 (Ph+ ALL), 37 subjects (72.5%) in Cohort 
3a,  and  24  subjects  (72.7%)  in  3b.  In  Cohort  1,  the  most  common  reason  for  study  drug 
discontinuation was progressive disease (5 subjects [17.2%]). In Cohort 2, the most common reasons 
for study drug discontinuation (7 subjects [41.2%]) were specified as lack of efficacy, increased white 
cell  count,  disease  and  control  and  start  of  tyrosine-kinase  inhibitor  (TKI)  and  chemotherapy 
association,  loss  of  response,  increase  of  transcript  BCR-ABL  in  the  bone  marrow  and  in  blood,  and 
investigator  decision.  In  Cohort  3a,  the  most  common  reasons  for  study  drug  discontinuation  (6 
subjects  [11.8%])  were  specified  as  T315I  mutation,  loss  of  major  molecular  remission  per 
investigator, loss of CCyR, and subject will undergo to HSCT with a suitable donor found. In Cohort 3b, 
the  most  common  reasons  for  study  drug  discontinuation  (6  subjects  [18.2%])  were  specified  as 
decision  to  administer  HSCT,  suboptimal  response,  2nd  malignancy  -  emergence  of  other  leukemia 
type, and subject transitioned to adult hospital.  
Recruitment 
Subjects  were  enrolled  at  80  sites  worldwide  in  18  countries:  Argentina,  Australia,  Brazil,  Canada, 
France, Germany, Great Britain, India, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Singapore, 
South  Africa,  Spain,  and  USA.  The  study  enrolled  subjects  sequentially  in  the  3  Cohorts.  The  first 
patient first visit date was 20  March 2009 in Cohort  1, 28  September 2009 in Cohort 2,  19  February 
2010 in Cohort 3a and 28 February 2013 in Cohort 3b, respectively. The last patient last visit date for 
this CSR was 1 September 2016. The clinical database lock for this CSR occurred on 4 November 2016.

Conduct of the study 
Changes to the original protocol (dated 09-Jul-2008) up to last subject last visit for this report (01-
Sep-2016) include 19 amendments and 8 administrative letters. Most amendments were related to the 
inclusion of newly-diagnosed patients in December 2009, and three years later for a sub-cohort to 
receive PFOS. Clarifications on criteria were implemented; removal of information on post-menopausal 
women and  update of information for women of child bearing potential added in amendment 18; 
amendments reflecting precautions such as hepatitis reactivation, ECG for cardiac monitoring, practical 
adjustments.

 
The MCyR rate of clinical interest as defined per protocol (> 30%) was met by 3 months of 
treatment: 55.2% (95% CI: 35.7, 73.6) (Table S.5.10). 
  MCyR rate was 79.3% at 6 months, 89.7% at 12 months, and 89.7% at 24 months of 
treatment (Table S.5.10). 
  CCyR rate was 65.5% at 6 months, 75.9% at 12 months, and 82.8% at 24 months of 
treatment (Table S.5.12). 
The median time to MCyR for subjects who achieved a MCyR was 3.1 months (Table 7.1-1, Figure 
7.2.1-1, Table S.5.19). The median time to CCyR for subjects who achieved a CCyR was 3.9 months. 
Figure 6 
Median durations of MCyR and CCyR were not estimated since less than half of the subjects progressed 
or died. Progression or death was reported in 5 of 26 subjects with a MCyR and in 4 of 24 subjects with 
a CCyR.

Sensitivity analyses  demonstrated that MCyR and  CCyR rates were comparable  to  the response  rates 
when filtered for subjects without relevant protocol inclusion criteria deviations (n = 25), for subjects 
without major or unknown cytogenetic response at baseline (n = 20), or for subjects without complete 
or  unknown  cytogenetic  response  at  baseline  (n  =  26)  .  Rates  by  subject  age  category  also  were 
comparable. 
Cytogenetic Response - Cohort 3 
CCyR (Cohort 3 primary endpoint) was observed in 94.0% (79/84) of subjects at any time with newly 
diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP. The MCyR and CCyR rates at 24 months were 96.4% and 94.0%, respectively. 
Cohorts 3a and 3b had comparable 24-month rates of MCyR (98.0% and 93.9%) and of CCyR (96.1% 
and 90.9%), respectively. The CCyR rate of clinical interest as defined per protocol (> 55%)  was met 
at 6 months of treatment in Cohort 3 overall (67.9%, 95% CI 56.8-77.6) and at 9 months of treatment 
for  both  Cohort  3a  (92.2%,  81.1-97.8)  and  Cohort  3b  (78.8%,  61.1-91.0).  Among  all  Cohort  3 
subjects, CCyR rate increased to 94.0% by 15 months of treatment, and MCyR increased from 61.9% 
at  3  months  to  96.4%  at  9  months  of  treatment.  For  subjects  in  Cohort  3b  who  switched  dasatinib 
dosing from PFOS to tablet, cytogenetic response was maintained after the switch. 
The  median  time  to  MCyR  was  3.0  months.  Median  times  to  major  or  complete  response  were 
comparable for Cohorts 3a and 3b. Among subjects who achieved CCyR within the first 12 months of 
treatment  (including  subjects  in  Cohort  3b  who  only  received  the  dasatinib  PFOS  formulation),  the 
median times to CCyR were 5.5 months for Cohort 3a, 5.6 months for Cohort 3b, and 5.5 months for 
the entire Cohort 3. 
Median durations of CCyR and MCyR were not estimated since less than half of the subjects progressed 
by the time of database lock. Disease progression was reported in 6 of 81 subjects with a MCyR at any 
time.  Progression  was  reported  in  4  subjects  in  Cohort  3a  out  of  all  79  subjects  in  Cohort  3  with  a 
CCyR at any time and by Month 12. No subject in Cohort 3b with a CCyR progressed or died.

Secondary outcome 
Hematologic Response - Cohort 1 
For the 29 subjects with imatinib-resistant/intolerant Ph+ CML-CP in Cohort 1: 
 
The confirmed CHR rate at 24 months was 93.1% (27/29 subjects). 
  By 6 months of treatment, 89.7% (26/29) of subjects achieved a CHR. 
 
The median time to CHR for subjects with a CHR was 0.7 months  
  Median CHR duration was not estimated since less than half of the subjects progressed or died 
by the time of database lock. 
 
Loss of response was reported in 5 of 27 subjects with a CHR. 
  Disease progression due to loss of CHR occurred in 2 subjects (6.9%). 
Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the CHR rate was comparable to the response rates by subject 
age category, CHR rate of subjects without relevant protocol inclusion criteria deviations (n = 25), and 
CHR rate of subjects without CHR or unknown hematologic response at baseline (n = 15).

Hematologic Response - Cohort 3 
For the 84 subjects with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP in Cohort 3: 
 
The confirmed CHR rate at 24 months was 95.2% (80/84 subjects). 
CHR rates at 24 months for Cohorts 3a and 3b were 100% and 87.9%, respectively (Table 7.1-1). 
 
The  Cohort  3  CHR  rate  at  6  months  was  92.9%  (78/84  of  subjects).  Cohorts  3a  and  3b  had 
comparable rates over time. 
 
The median time to CHR for Cohort 3 subjects with a CHR was 1.2 months. Cohorts 3a and 3b 
had comparable median times to CHR. 
  Median CHR duration was not estimated since less than half of the subjects progressed by the 
time of database lock. 
 
Loss of response was reported in 7 of 81 subjects with a CHR. 
  Disease progression due to loss of CHR occurred only in 2 subjects in Cohort 3a (3.9%). 
Sensitivity  analyses  demonstrated  that  CHR  rates  for  Cohort  3,  Cohort  3a,  or  Cohort  3b  were  
comparable to the response rates by subject age category (Table S.5.5), CHR rates of subjects without 
relevant  protocol  inclusion  criteria  deviations  (n  =  81),  or  CHR  rates  of  subjects  without  CHR  or 
unknown hematologic response at baseline (n = 82).

Molecular Response - Cohort 1 
The  molecular  response  rates  at  24  months  in  Cohort  1  (n  =  29)  were  55.2%  MMR  (16  subjects), 
31.0% MR4 (9 subjects), and 17.2% CMR (5 subjects). The molecular response rates at any time were 
62.1%  MMR  (18  subjects),  34.5%  MR4  (10  subjects),  and  24.1%  CMR  (7  subjects).  MMR  was  first 
observed at 3 months of treatment in 5 subjects (17.2%), and this rate rose to 62.1% (18 subjects) at 
36  months  (Table  S.5.31,  Figure  S.5.17).  MR4  was  first  observed  at  3  months  of  treatment  in  1 
subjects (3.4%) and this rate rose to 34.5% (10 subjects) at 48 months. CMR was first observed at 6 
months of treatment in 2 subjects (6.9%), and this rate rose to 24.1% (7 subjects) at 48 months. 
Molecular Response - Cohort 3 
For  Cohort  3  in  total  (n  =  84),  the  molecular  response  rates  at  24  months  were  70.2%  MMR  (59 
subjects),  39.3%  MR4  (33  subjects),  and  21.4%  CMR  (18  subjects)  (Table  7.1-1).  The  molecular 
response  rates  at  any  time  for  Cohort  3  were  79.8%  MMR  (67  subjects),  46.4%  MR4  (39  subjects), 
and  29.8%  CMR  (25  subjects).  Since  the  median  exposure  duration  was  27.40  months  in  Cohort  3b 
(see Section 6.1), exposure durations cannot support comparisons of efficacy between Cohorts 3a and 
3b  beyond  24  months  of  treatment.  Molecular  response  rates  for  Cohort  3a  and  Cohort  3b, 
respectively, were: 
  MMR: 56.9% and 45.5% at 12 months, and 74.5% and 63.6% at 24 months  
  MR4: 21.6% and 9.1% at 12 months, and 45.1% and 30.3% at 24 months

  CMR: 9.8% and 6.1% at 12 months, and 29.4% and 9.1% at 24 months  
The  downward  trend  in  molecular  response  over  time  for  those  subjects  in  Cohort  3b  who  switched 
dasatinib dosing from PFOS to tablet was maintained (Figure S.5.28). The MMR, MR4, and CMR rates 
at any time, respectively, were 88.2%, 52.9%, and 43.1% in Cohort 3a, and 66.7%, 36.4%, and 9.1% 
in Cohort 3b (Table S.5.30). The median time to MMR for subjects with a MMR in Cohort 3a, Cohort 3b, 
and Cohort 3 overall was 8.9 months (Table 7.1-1, Figure 7.4.2-1, Table S.5.34). 
For subjects in Cohort 3, Cohort 3a, and Cohort 3b, median durations of MMR were not estimated since 
less than half of the subjects progressed by the time of database lock. Progression was reported in 3 of 
45 subjects with a MMR in Cohort 3a only.

Progression-free Survival 
PFS was defined in the protocol as time from  the  first dosing date until the time progressive  disease 
was first documented by the investigator or death. Results based on the alternative definition in which 
second  malignant  disease  was  included  as  event  type  besides  progressive  disease  and  death,  were 
identical to the results based on the protocol definition. Table  7.5-1 presents the reasons for  disease 
progression among subjects in Cohorts 1 and 3.

Progression-free Survival - Cohort 1 
PFS was defined in the protocol as time from  the  first dosing date until the time progressive  disease 
was first documented by the investigator or death. Results based on the alternative definition in which 
second  malignant  disease  was  included  as  event  type  besides  progressive  disease  and  death,  were 
identical to the results based on the protocol definition. The median for protocol-defined PFS was not 
reached  in  Cohort  1  since  disease  progressed  in  only  7  of  29  subjects.  By  24  and  48  months  of 
treatment,  an  estimated  81.7%  and  77.6%  of  subjects,  respectively,  in  Cohort  1  were  alive  without 
disease  progression.  The  2  subjects  with  development  of  BP-CML  did  not  have  extramedullary 
involvement.  For  Subject  CA180226-29-26006,  a  Grade  3  SAE  of  progression  to  blast  phase  CML 
(unrelated to study drug) was reported on study Day 59. Dasatinib treatment was discontinued on the 
same day, and the subject is being treated for this event. 
Subject CA180226-92-26058 had  bone marrow relapse (lymphoblasts = 20%) detected on Day 678; 
consequently, dasatinib dose was increased from 100 mg/day to 120 mg/day. On Day 789, the subject 
was  hospitalized  for  treatment  of  Grade  3  recurrent  leukemia  (unrelated  to  study  drug)  with  29.6% 
lymphoblasts in the bone marrow and re-emergence of abnormal karyotype to t(9:22). Following onset 
of  this  event,  the  subject  withdrew  consent,  and  dasatinib  was  discontinued  on  Day  797.  Treatment 
with  cytarabine,  daunorubicin,  asparaginase,  and  vincristine  was  started,  and  the  subject  was 
discharged  24  days  after  the  last  dasatinib  dose.  A  cerebral  aspergillosis  infection  was  detected  45 
days after the last dasatinib dose, and the subject died of respiratory arrest 6 weeks later.

Progression-free Survival - Cohort 3 
When PFS was based on the alternative definition in which second malignant disease was included as 
event type besides progressive disease and death, 1 additional event was identified when compared to 
PFS based on the protocol definition. The median for protocol-defined PFS according to either definition 
was  not  reached  in  Cohort  3,  Cohort  3a,  or  Cohort  3b  since  only  7  of  84  (8  of  84  according  to  the 
alternative definition) of subjects in Cohort 3 progressed. Figure 7.5.2-1 below is based on the protocol 
definition of PFS. 
At  24  months,  an  estimated  95.1%  (95%  CI:  87.4%,  98.1%)  of  subjects  in  Cohort  3  were  alive 
without progression (94.0% in Cohort 3a and 96.8% in Cohort 3b) according to the protocol definition 
of PFS, and an estimated 93.9% (95% CI: 86.0%, 97.4%) of subjects in Cohort 3 were alive without 
progression  (94.0%  in  Cohort  3a  and  93.8%  in  Cohort  3b)  according  to  the  alternative  definition  of 
PFS. 
The  1  subject  in  Cohort  3b  (CA180226-91-26132)  with  disease  progression  due  to  development  of 
blast-phase CML was discontinued from PFOS dasatinib on study Day 137, hospitalized for treatment of 
a SAE of Grade 4 recurrent leukemia (not related to study drug) on Day 138, and immediately began 
treatment with hydroxyurea, imatinib (Day 143), asparaginase, and filgrastim. Bone marrow blast cell 
counts  increased  from  1%  at  baseline to 83%  (Day  141)  prior  to  the  change  in  treatment.  Blast  cell 
counts decreased to 30% at Day 145 and 0% at Day 149 and at follow-up 2 weeks and 4 weeks later. 
Extramedullary involvement was not detected while on treatment.

progression was first documented by the investigator or death from  any cause. Results based on the 
alternative  definition  in  which  second  malignant  disease  was  included  as  event  type  besides 
progressive  disease  and  death,  were  identical  to  the  results  based  on  the  protocol  definition.  The

BCR-ABL Mutations - Cohort 1 
Six  subjects  in  Cohort  1  had  single  BCR-ABL  mutations  at  baseline.  Five  of  these  subjects  had  a 
confirmed CHR. Of the 7 subjects with disease progression (see Section 7.5), 4 subjects had mutation 
data  at  the  time  of  disease  progression,  treatment  failure,  or  end  of  treatment.  Of  these,  3  subjects 
had single BCR-ABL mutations. Two of these subjects had these mutations at baseline. No subject had 
> 1 mutation at baseline or the end of treatment. 
BCR-ABL Mutations - Cohort 3 
One subject in Cohort 3a had  a single BCR-ABL mutation at baseline  (P58S), the  position of  which is 
located in the Cap  region of the ABL protein and N-terminal to the  SH3, SH2 and kinase  domains.24 
The  half  maximal  inhibitory  concentration  (IC50)  to  dasatinib  for  this  mutation  is  unknown.  This 
subject also had a confirmed CHR. Of the 6 subjects in Cohort 3a with disease progression, 2 subjects 
had  mutation  data  at  the  time  of  disease  progression,  treatment  failure,  or  end  of  treatment,  but 
neither subject had mutations. No subjects in Cohort 3b with mutation data had BCR-ABL mutations at 
baseline or at the time of disease progression, treatment failure, or end of treatment, including the 1 
subject in Cohort 3b with disease progression.

Ancillary analyses 
The efficacy reported with dasatinib 72 mg/m2 PFOS was compared to historical data with the current 
standard of care, imatinib, in a comparable paediatric patient population (table x) ).  
In  a  French  Phase  IV  study,  paediatric  subjects  with  newly  diagnosed  CML-CP  were  treated  with 
imatinib  260  mg/m2.  At  12  months,  the  CCyR  rate  was  61%  (27/44)  and  the  MMR  rate  was  31% 
(14/44). 
In  an  Italian  study,  39  paediatric  subjects  with  newly  diagnosed  CML-CP  and  8  subjects  previously 
exposed  to  interferon  were  treated  with  imatinib  340  mg/m2/day.  The  CCyR  rate  at  12  months 
reported,  including only  evaluable  patients  was  96%  (24/25).  The  MMR  rate  at  12  months,  including 
only  evaluable  patients  was  66.6%  (14/21)  in  peripheral  blood  and  63.7%  (14/22)  in  bone  marrow. 
When accounting for the total number of patients exposed to imatinib, as was done in CA180226 and 
in the French Phase IV study, the CCyR rate at 12 months was 51% (24/47) and the MMR rate at 12 
months was 30% (14/47), which is comparable to the French study and lower than the response rates 
seen for dasatinib PFOS 72 mg/m2 based on all the treated patients (N=33), as shown in Table 25. 
In  the  imatinib  SmPC,  in  51  paediatric  subjects  with  newly  diagnosed  CML-CP,  the  CCyR  rate  at  12 
months was 65% and MMR was not reported.

Clinical studies in special populations 
The paediatric clinical development program in CML include results obtained in Black/African (4), 
Caucasian (56), Asian (23) and one American Indian or Alaska native in the main study, newly 
diagnosed group.  
Concomitant morbidities have not been studied.  
Supportive studies 
Studies CA18003 (Phase 1, dose finding in imatinib intolerant/resistant patients, and solid tumours) 
and CA18002 (Phase 1, dose escalation in imatinib resistant/intolerant patients) have been discussed 
under clinical pharmacology.  
The cohort 2 in CA180226 with advanced Ph+ leukaemia was closed for further enrolment to 
monotherapy with dasatinib by DMC due to insufficient treatment response and disease progression. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Three trials supporting this application of Dasatinib for the treatment of children and adolescents aged 
1 year to 18 years with Ph+ chronic phase CML are open label, non-comparative trials. 
Trial  CA180018  was  a  phase  I  study  in  which  six  patients  were  treated  at  80mg/m2  QD  and  eleven 
patients at 60mg/m2 QD, with comparable response rates at the two dose levels. Although the rates of 
Hematologic and Cytogenetic responses were higher in patients treated with the higher dasatinib dose 
(80 mg/m2) than with the lower one (60mg/m2) (while molecular response rates were lower with the 
higher  dose),  the  conclusion  that  the  dose  of  60mg/m2  is  the  recommended  dose  for  phase  II  is 
acceptable, as the number of subjects in each group was very low for these differences to be valued.  
Trial  CA180226,  considered  the  pivotal  study,  was  a  phase  II  where  patients  in  Cohort  1  (imatinib-
resistant/intolerant  CML-CP)  and  Cohort  3  (newly  diagnosed  treatment-naïve  CML-CP,  subdivided  in 
Cohorts  3a,  with  tablet  dosing,  and  3b,  with  powder  for  oral  suspension  dosing)  were  treated  with 
dasatinib 60mg/m2 QD.  
A  third  study  was  presented  (Study  CA180038),  a  phase  I  trial  mainly  enrolling  patients  with  solid 
tumor  diagnoses,  and  only  9  patients  with  CML  in  non-described  phases,  who  weren’t  assessed  for 
efficacy with the adequate endpoints for CML. This study is not contributive for the present assessment 
of efficacy.   
Given the low incidence of CML in the paediatric age, and the limited scope of this application for a new 
formulation  in  a  new  indication  of  a  drug  that  is  approved  and  well-studied  in  adults  in  the  same 
indication,  as  well  as  the  rather  objective  endpoints  of  hematologic,  cytogenetic,  and  molecular 
response rates, the open, non-comparative design of the main trials in the application is acceptable.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Newly  diagnosed  patients  in  the  main  study  on  planned  daily  dasatinib  treatment  60mg/m2  tablets 
(cohort  3a,  51  patients)  all  achieved  CHR  at  any  time,  90%  had  major  cytogenetic  response  at  6 
months, and 98% at 12 months  –  67% and  96%  being  complete,  respectively.  By molecular biology 
31%  obtained  the  classic  MMR  endpoint  at  6  months  and  57%  at  12  months,  88%  at  any  time  on 
tablet  treatment.  For  newly  diagnosed  patients  in  the  main  study  on  planned  daily  PFOS  treatment 
72mg/m2 (cohort 3b, 33 patients), the same efficacy endpoints were: 91% CHR at any time, 91% had 
MCyR at 6 months and 94% at 12 months  – of these 70% and 88% were complete, respectively. By 
molecular biology 18% had MMR at 6 months, 46% at 12 months, and 67% at any time.  
Other  parameters  like  MR4  and  CMR  also  show  less  effect  by  molecular  biology  in  the  PFOS  group, 
whereas  the  time  to  obtain  CCyR  is  the  same  (5.5  months).  The  overall  survival  for  the  newly 
diagnosed patients is identical, whatever the treatment, but it is a major concern that the efficacy by 
molecular  biology  is  slower  and  less  than  on  dasatinib  tablet  treatment.  One  way  to  interpret  these 
results  are  that in  a limited  group  of  patients,  who  do  achieve  a  complete  cytogenetic  remission  and 
acceptable MMR rates, the risk for disease progression even over more than 5 years of follow up do not 
necessarily reflect significantly in the results on survival. However, it was demonstrated – as expected 
from  adult  CML  monitoring  –  that  the  progression  free  survival  in  landmark  plot  by  BCR-ABL  less  or 
above  10%  at  three  months  in  all  treated  subjects,  newly  diagnosed  treatment  naïve  patients  was 
significantly less (40%) at 4-5 years in the group with sub-optimal response, versus optimal response 
patients with a PFS of 90%.  
It is acknowledged that the number of paediatric patients is very low, and it is not questioned that the 
PFOS  formulation  and  administration  really  fulfil  an  unmet  medical  need,  which  was  initiated  by  a 
request  from  CHMP  /  PDCO  some  ten  years  ago.  It  is  convincingly  demonstrated  that  dasatinib 
treatment has a better effect in CML-CP in children, compared with historic data on imatinib. This is not 
only  due  to  a  PFOS  administration  per  se,  but  the  effect  of  a  more  potent  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor 
(TKI) contributes as well. Clinical data of PFOS supports its use in paediatric CML-CP patients, and the 
concern of efficacy when compared to tablet formulation in children, and compared to adults may now 
be reviewed again. 
It has been questioned if paediatric CML-CP is the same disease biologically as adult CML-CP. The key 
pathological factor is the t(9;22), which justifies treatment by the TKI principle, but there seems to be 
differences  in  host  factors  and  cell  biology  translating  to  another  clinical  presentation  (Hijiya  et  al. 
Blood 2016). However, the only rational practice, until further is to treat in the same way as in adult 
patients,  and  adhere  to  the  same  guidelines  from  ELN,  in  Europe  (Baccarani  et  al.  Blood 2013). 
Therefore,  when  a  child  is  diagnosed  with  CML-CP  the  treatment  will  be  evaluated  by the  recognized 
response  criteria  at  regular  intervals  (3,6,12  months  in  the  first  year).  Accepting  the  present 
application  and  the  justification  for  the  dose  PFOS  90  mg/m2  in  children,  the  concern  of  a  reduced 
effect  previously,  may  consequently  be  anticipated  to  be  corrected  by  a  dose-adjustment  if  the 
response  is  not  optimal,  as  in  treatment  routinely  using  the  optimal  starting  dose  in  adults. 
Measurement  of  P-dasatinib  is  not  available  in  common  practice,  nor  are  plasma-measurements  of 
other TKI. Therefore, the monitoring of the young patients is as important to perform, as in adult CML 
patients,  e.g.  due  to  an  increasing  weight  or  adverse  events,  necessitating  to  consider  dose 
adjustments. The narratives on three patients, who were increased in PFOS dosage, have been noticed 
and  that  the  treatment  apparently  was  changed  in  two  patients  at  a  relatively  late  time  in  the 
treatment, for which there may be various explanations.  
The  response  assessment  using  hematologic,  cytogenetic  and  molecular  criteria  are  emphasized 
together  with  the  recommendation  for  dose  adjustments  in  the  SmPC  section  4.2.  Naturally,  any 
treatment effect is also a compromise in adverse events and toxicity, which play an important role in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302652/2018 
Page 60/82 
  
  
treatment  of  the  individual  patient,  and  with  a  major  importance  due  to  the  likely  need  for  chronic 
treatment  and  still  un-settled  risks  in  this  context  of  young  patients.  The  recommendation  in  the 
SmPC: “The following dose escalations shown in Table 2 are recommended in paediatric patients who 
do  not  achieve  a  haematologic  or  cytogenetic  response”  is  therefore  suggested  to  highlight  that  the 
response  must  be  reached  at  the  recommended  time  points  (refer  to  the  product  information)  and 
maintained  after  the  first  year.  The  recommendations  in  dose  adjustments  for  adverse  reactions  are 
endorsed. If a dose-increase seems justified due to an unsatisfactory PCR-level, but is not possible to 
implement due to adverse events, despite measures to try to reduce these manifestations, which may 
reduce  QoL  significantly,  a  change  in  treatment  medication,  perhaps  mutation  analysis  has  to  be 
considered.  The  dosing  schedule  may  also  contribute  to  reduce  the  risk  for  administration  of  under-
dosing in children, which has been observed in report on medication errors and off-label use from 28-
Jun-2015 through 27-June-2017,  
It is accepted that the Major Molecular Response  rate at 12 months on PFOS is reported  to be 45%, 
which do indicate that 55% of the young patients do not. The MMR, or better is considered a clinical, 
safe hallmark in adult CML treatment. The MMR Response rate increase after the first year, reflecting 
the optimal response obtained over time, but also the limbo according to present CML-guidelines, for 
the  patients  not  in  MMR  after  one  year  or  thereafter  –  until  strict  failure  may  occur.  However,  the 
results presented underline the importance of response evaluation in the individual patient, as in adult 
patients. Any positive immune-modulating effect of dasatinib in children, in tablet or PFOS formulation 
in  children  is  not  clarified,  but  it  may  very  well  add  to  the  long-term  effect,  because  response  rates 
increases over time.  
The tablet dose of 60 mg/ m2 QD for paediatric subjects with CML-CP is supported. It has been 
sufficiently demonstrated that exposure matches the adult dose of 100 mg QD for the same indication. 
The proposed PFOS dose is based on simulations as it was demonstrated that the bioavailability of 
PFOS compared to tablets in paediatric subjects appeared to be lower in paediatric subjects than in 
adults. To achieve similar exposure with the PFOS as tablet 60 mg/m2, the PFOS dose should be 90 
mg/m2. The dosage of 90 mg/m2 PFOS is justified for children from 1 year of age and day 1 in 
treatment with dasatinib. (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). However, since no paediatric 
subjects have been treated with the proposed dose in a clinical setting, methods to ensure close 
monitoring in the post marketing setting are warranted (see RMP).  
In  the  main  study,  previously  treated,  CML-CP  patients,  the  same  key-endpoint  in  imatinib  resistant 
(34 patients) versus intolerant patients (10 patients), showed an unconfirmed CHR rate at any time in 
all patients (pooled results), and MCyR at six months (79/90%) and at 12 months (85/100%), of these 
(74/80%)  and  77/80%)  were  complete,  respectively.  The  MMR  at  3  months  was  (15/20%),  at  6 
months (26/30%) and at 12 months (41/40%). MMR was achieved  in 56%  and 60%, respectively at 
any time. The results indicate a more slowly effect in resistant patients, than in imatinib-intolerant, but 
overall  obtained  almost  the  same  effect  by  efficacy  parameters  in  this  limited  group  of  patients,  but 
with  a  trend in  particular for  resistant patients  of less  molecular  responses.  This  pattern  of  results is 
positive  for  the  effect  on  previously  treated  patients  as  a  group,  and  indicate  that  dasatinib  do 
overcome imatinib resistance. This pattern of results is somewhat expected compared to the TKI-naïve 
dasatinib-treated patients as a group.   
No  point-mutations  were  demonstrated  in  six  newly  diagnosed,  tablet  treated  patients  albeit  at 
different  time  upon  disease  progression.  No  subjects  in  the  PFOS  treated  cohort  with  mutation  data 
had  BCR-ABL  mutations  at  the  time  of  disease  progression,  treatment  failure,  or  end  of  treatment, 
including  the  1  subject  in  Cohort  3b  with  disease  progression.  It  may  indicate  that  dasatinib  do  not 
cause a specific selection pressure in newly diagnosed CML-CP paediatric patients.

The  efficacy  and  survival  of  patients  with  Ph+  advanced  disease  (AP,BP  and  acute  leukaemias)    11 
treated  subjects  (of  a  total  group  of  58  patients)  in  study  180018  and  180226  (all  prior  imatinib 
treated) showed an effect of dasatinib treatment, e.g. by 27% CHR at any time, on monotherapy in a 
group  of  patients  with  dubious  prognosis.  The  follow-up  time  (survival)  is  very  short.  No  results  on 
effect  and  safety  seem  to  contra-indicate  the  use  in  CP,  although  observations  are  confounded  by 
many other factors. Detailed narratives have been provided for seven patients (6 subjects with acute 
lymphoblastic  leukemia  [ALL]  from  either  CA180018  or  CA180226  [Cohort  2]  and  1  chronic  myeloid 
leukemia-blast  phase  [CML-BP]  subject  from  CA180226  [Cohort  2])  who  died  of  causes  other  than 
disease  progression.  The  cause  of  those  7  deaths  were  due  to  expected  complications,  and  the 
information  do  not  indicate  any  relation  to  the  dasatinib  monotherapy,  which  however  may  only  be 
considered a palliative option in these circumstances.  
The number of patients in non-white race categories are limited, but is considered acceptable because 
satisfactory results on efficacy have been reported in adult (east) Asian population.  
Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that the number of paediatric patients is in overall very low, however 
the PFOS formulation and administration will indeed fulfil an unmet medical need, as per a request 
from CHMP / PDCO.  
The results presented, based on patient cohorts, criteria and design of studies on paediatric CML-CP, in 
imatinib treated or newly diagnosed children, support the applied indication by dasatinib tablet 
treatment. The introduction of an oral formulation, PFOS into clinical practice is well prepared and very 
relevant in this age-group.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results presented based on patient cohorts, criteria and design of studies on paediatric CML-CP, in 
imatinib treated or newly diagnosed children support the use of dasatinib tablet treatment.  
The  introduction  of  an  oral  formulation,  PFOS  into  clinical  practice  is  very  relevant  in  this  age-group. 
Dosing by tablet and PFOS has been reflected in the SmPC, based on the present knowledge and PPK 
and PBPK models. The dosage of 90 mg/m2 PFOS is now satisfactorily justified for the paediatric use of 
dasatinib.   
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A total of 188 patients may be included in the review on exposure to dasatinib in paediatric Ph+ 
leukaemias.

A similar pattern of AEs is observed in  newly diagnosed  and  previously TKI-treated  CML-CP  patients. 
Almost all subjects experience AE, and excpet for hematologic AEs manifested by cytopenias most AE 
are  less  than  grade  3.  The  two  most  notably  observations  is  the  very  positive  result  that  no  deaths 
were recorded in CP patients, and the second is the abscence of pleural effusions, which is a frequent 
clinical  problem  in  treatment  of  adult  CML.  Pediatric  patients  in  the  CA180226  trial  had  an 
approximately 50% lower Cmin with dasatinib 60 mg/m2 tablet than adult patients with dasatinib 100 
mg. Thus, the frequency of events of pleural effusion, ascites, pericardial effusion, pulmonary edema, 
or pulmonary hypertension were expected to be lower (or absent) in pediatric patients treated with the 
60  mg/m2  dose  of  dasatinib.  Moreover,  dasatinib-related  pleural  effusion  may  occur  through  a 
reduction  in  interstitial  fluid  pressure  or  vascular  permeability  changes,  which  are  more  frequent  in 
adults.     
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Symptoms like diarrhoea, rash, headache, oedema and muscle-joint are Present to a similar degree as 
the AE profile of dasatinib in adults. Some symptoms like diarrhea may be potentially more dangerous 
in small children than in adults, but still almost always less than grade 3. Some cardiac manifestations 
have  been  observed,  however  not  severe  and  appear  manageable.  No  clinically  meaningful  cardiac 
impact on QTc or function seems to have been observed.   
Likely, the less concurrent comorbidity at inclusion or follow-up in children compared to adult patients 
have some influence on the impression of an acceptable AE profile of dasatinib in first- or second line 
treatment  in  CML-CP.  Bleeding  may  pose  a  problem  in  adults,  and  have  been  observed,  but  none 
severe.  Paediatric  growth  and  development  AEs  were  not  observed  in  dasatinib  first  line  treatment, 
and observations in previously treated patients may include some late effect of imatinib. Therefore the 
planned follow-up on all patients is very relevant  to  settle this AE, which  however  may improve over 
time and may be considered acceptable given the indication, and in only 2% considered to be severe.  
The  current  protocol  language  defines  the  duration  of  Long-term  Growth  and  Development 
Assessments in alignment with the RMP and PIP, which is a yearly assessment while on treatment and 
yearly for up to 5 years after treatment discontinuation. Overall, 23 subjects were enrolled in Cohort 3 
(<  11  years  old),  and  currently  >50%  of  those  subjects  are  on  treatment  after  more  than  5  years. 
There  is  no  protocol  defined  end  of  Long-term  Growth  and  Development  Assessments  on  treatment. 
BMS  agrees  to  amend  Study  CA180226  to  require  early  long-term  growth  and  development 
assessments for subjects on treatment in Cohort 3 who were < 11 years old when enrolled, continuing 
until  subjects  are  18  years  old.  It  is  noticed,  that  overall,  3  subjects  in  the  study  received 
levothyroxine while on treatment with dasatinib.  
Liver or renal affection by treatment with dasatinib is not a specific problem in paediatric CML-CP.   
Serious adverse events and deaths 
SAE 
Except for infections and SAEs from blood- and lymphatic system contributing to the majority of SAEs, 
no special AE has emerged as a major problem. The distribution of SAEs are similar in naïve and TKI-
treated  CML-CP  patients,  and  a  trend  towards  more  grade  3  AEs  in  imatinib  resistant/intolerant 
patients  (35%)  than  in  newly-diagnosed  treated  by  dasatinib  (26%)  (Table  2.3-1).  As  expected  the 
symptoms  and  manifestations  are  much  more  extensive  in  advanced  Ph+  leukaemias,  but  these 
observations  do  not  distract  the  favourable  impression  by  dasatinib  treatment  in  CML-CP  in  children. 
(Table 29)

Table 29 
One potentially serious adverse event, which cannot be described until further follow-up is the impact 
of  dasatinib  treatment  on  fertility.  Rational  measures  have  been  instituted  by  information  to  female 
patients. The risk of developmental defects in a foetus during non-imatinib TKI treatment is not known. 
It is acknowledged that it is mentioned in the SmPC (section 4.6) that physicians and other healthcare 
providers  should  counsel  male  patients  of  appropriate  age  about  possible  effects  of  SPRYCEL  on 
fertility, and this counselling may include consideration of semen deposition. 
Deaths 
In  the  CML-CP  pooled  population,  there  were  4  (8.7%)  deaths  reported  in  the  imatinib 
resistant/intolerant  group,  1  cerebral  haemorrhage,  1  disease  progression,  2  ‘other’.    For  the  cases 
reported  as  ‘other’  1  subject  died  due  to  fatal  bleeding  in  digestive  tract  and  the  other  cause  was 
respiratory failure due to the disease.  
There were no deaths within 30 days of last treatment. As of the database lock, none of the 84 naïve 
subjects have died (Table 2.2-1). 
In  the  advanced  CML,  Ph+  ALL  and  AML  pooled  population,  45  subjects  died  (77.6%).  32 
subjects died due to disease progression, 7 due to the reason as ‘other’, 5 due to infections, and 1 due 
to  fatal  bleeding.  17  (29.3%)  deaths  occurred  within  30  days  of  last  treatment,  the  most  common 
reason being ‘other’ (Table 2.2-1). 
A listing of deaths in all treated subjects is provided in Appendix 16.

Details for deaths occurring in CA180226 are presented in Table S.6.2 of the CA180226 Final CSR and 
in Table 9.2 of the CA180018 Final CSR. No safety issues on dasatinib emerge.  
Long-term Safety-Effects on Growth and Development 
The  effects  of  dasatinib  on  Growth  and  Development  and  Bone  Metabolism  is  part  of  the  long  term 
safety assessment, assessed annually while subjects is on study therapy and were to be followed for 5 
years from the time the subject discontinued the study therapy. 
Dasatinib  administered  to  paediatric  subjects  appears  to  have  no  clinically  significant  impact  as 
measured by increases or decreases in Z-scores for weight, height, or BMI, and compared to reference 
ranges  during  the  study.  However,  it  is  difficult  to  make  any  definitive  conclusions  from  these  data, 
particularly considering chronic disease in these patients may affect these parameters. 
In general, a Z-score that is far from 0 in either direction (± 2 standard deviations) may represent a 
growth problem. 
Weight, Height and BMI  
CML-CP pooled population 
In the naive group, at >2 years to ≤3 years, mean changes in height, weight, and BMI Z-scores were -
0.57, -0.02, and 0.54 (Appendices 26, 27, and 28, respectively). 
In the imatinib resistant/intolerant group, at 2 years to ≤3 years, mean changes in height, weight, and 
BMI Z-scores were -0.23, 0.60, and 0.07. 
Advanced CML, Ph+ ALL and AML pooled population 
At 2 years to ≤3 years, mean changes in height, weight, and BMI Z-scores were -0.51, 0.07, and 0.14, 
respectively. 
Bone Growth and Development-Related AEs 
In the CML-CP pooled population, bone growth and development AEs (any grade) were reported in 
7  (8.3%)  and  grade  3-4  were  reported  in  2  (2.4%)  of  the  naive  subjects.  Drug-related  AEs  were 
reported  in  2  (2.4%)  of  subjects.  The  AEs  reported  were  gynecomastia  (1  subject)  and  growth 
retardation (1 subject). 
In  the  imatinib  resistant/intolerant  group,  bone  growth  and  development  AEs  (any  grade)  were 
reported in 6 (13.0%) and grade 3-4 were reported in 1 (2.2%). Drug-related AEs were reported in 4 
(8.7%) subjects. The AEs reported were epiphyses delayed fusion (1 subject), osteopenia (1 subject), 
gynecomastia  (1  subject),  growth  retardation,  epiphyses  delayed  fusion,  osteoporosis  (3  events  in  1 
subject).  
In  the  advanced  CML,  Ph+  ALL  and  AML  pooled  population,  1  (1.7%)  subject  had  growth 
retardation and foot fracture AEs which were not drug-related AEs. 
Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors 
The  frequencies  of  all-causality  and  drug-related  AEs  in  the  pooled  CML  and  the  advanced  CML,  Ph+ 
ALL  and  AML  populations  for  subgroups  of  age,  gender,  race,  region,  and  Karnofsky/Lansky 
performance  status  were similar to  the  AE  frequencies  in the  overall  pooled  CML  and  advanced  CML, 
Ph+ ALL and AML populations. Numerical differences in frequencies of all-causality AEs of any grade in 
dasatinib-treated  subjects  were  observed  in  some  subgroups.  These  differences  are  of  limited 
interpretability due to low sample sizes and event rates, and do not alter the overall safety profile of 
dasatinib in these subgroups

Safety of Dasatinib Powder for Oral Suspension 
In  study  CA180226,  33  paediatric  (0  to  18  years  of  age)  treatment  naive  CML-CP  subjects  were 
enrolled in an expanded cohort to receive dasatinib PFOS, as an age-appropriate formulation. The dose 
of dasatinib administered in PFOS formulation was 72 mg/m2 and subjects in this cohort were required 
to take dasatinib PFOS formulation for a minimum of 12 months. After 12 months, those subjects who 
remained on study were allowed to switch to take dasatinib tablet formulation if they chose. 
The  median  duration  of  dasatinib  PFOS  therapy  in  CA180226  was  12  months  and  the  median  daily 
dose  was  71.26  mg/m2/day.  Twenty-two  subjects  (66.7%)  had  PFOS  to  tablet  change,  while  6 
subjects continue to receive PFOS. 
No  clinically  relevant  safety  concerns  were  noted  in  treatment-naive  paediatric  subjects  treated  with 
tablets or with PFOS during the first year of treatment. No differences in the safety profile were noted 
between tablets and PFOS. 
  No deaths or drug-related SAEs were reported in naive CML-CP subjects treated with PFOS. 
  AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in 3 (3.6%) subjects. All of these AEs 
(drug  hypersensitivity,  leukemia,  and  leukemia  recurrent)  were  Grade  3-4  and  subjects 
discontinued  due  to  AEs  during  the  first  year  of  treatment.  Only  1  subject  discontinued 
treatment  due  to  a  drug-related  AE  (Grade  3  drug  hypersensitivity).  The  subject’s 
hypersensitivity reaction was treated and resolved thereafter. 
 
For  those  subjects  who  switched  dasatinib  dosing  from  PFOS  to  tablet,  rates  and  severities 
before and after the switch were decreasing as expected over the course of the treatment for 
all AEs and SAEs and study drug-related AEs and SAEs. 
  Bone  growth  and development  AEs  related  to  study  drug  were  reported in  2 (2.4%)  subjects 
naive  CML-CP  subjects  (1  subject  each  receiving  PFOS  and  tablet);  neither  of  these  AEs  was 
severe in intensity. 
Laboratory findings 
Functionally,  the  haematological  AEs  may  represent  rapidly  progressive  serious  situations  (also)  in 
children, but in  CML-CP  the summary of On  Treatment  Grade  3 or  4  Laboratory Abnormalities (Table 
3.1-1  and  3.2.3-1)  illustrate  neutropenia  as  the  most  frequent  –  and  well-known  and  manageable 
situation  at  specialized  departments  where  these  patient  are  followed.  The  risk  of  grade  4 
thrombopenia in a child pose probably in most instances a less risk than in an adult, and in particular 
elderly patient due to less risk of a vascular component for bleeding. The fact that all patients in CP are 
alive is an indirect parameter to support the point of view of manageable handling of – also laboratory 
-  grade  3-4  AEs  in  children  on  dasatinib  treatment.  Treatment  with  dasatinib  in  paediatric  CML-CP  is 
associated with very limited renal, hepatic or electrolyte impact. The summary of On-Treatment grade 
4  abnormalities  indicate  a  trend  to  more  affected  patients  in  the  imatinib  treated  group,  but  minor 
differences  and  most  less  than  5%,  except  neutropenia.  The  results  add  value  to  the  safety  of 
dasatinib treatment, at the recommended dosage, for the applied indication.  
Safety in special populations 
The  clinical  studies  in  paediatric  Ph+  positive  leukaemias,  and  most  relevantly  assessed  in  chronic 
phase  chronic myeloid leukaemia do not indicate any association to efficacy or safety and intrinsic or 
extrinsic  factors.  The  interpretation  is  restricted  by  some  precaution  due  to  the  limited  patient 
population. In particular the very young patients, the number of Black / African descendants are very 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302652/2018 
Page 68/82 
  
  
few.  Still,  no  data  indicate  a  relation  of  extrinsic  factors  in  adults,  and  the  age  distribution  must 
accommodate to the rarity of patients and meaningful reason to suppose an impact pathophysiological 
of young age, provided the same dosing effect.  
Amongst PFOS treated children, two patients discontinued due to leukaemia/leukaemia relapse (CML) 
during  treatment,  within  the  first  year.  The  disease  progression  rate  on  dasatinib  /  imatinib  in  the 
DASISION  study  (258  patients,  each  arm)  were  at  two  years:  5/7%,  and  the  treatment  failure  (no 
remission) rate 3/4%. Progression or treatment failure (combined) at five years in the DASISION study 
was reported to be 11/14% for dasatinib / imatinib treatment, respectively. The observed “leukaemia 
risk”  in  PFOS  at  one  year  may  be  interpreted  as  2/33  subjects  or  6%  at  one  year,  which  may  be 
comparable to TKI effects observed in the DASISION study in adults. At one year is before the patients 
could switch to tablets and may be associated with the relatively reduced efficacy in clonal control of 
CML addressed previously. Responses to dasatinib PFOS observed in Study CA180226 by hematologic, 
cytogenetic  and  molecular  responses  support  the  comparability  of  dasatinib  PFOS  treatment  of 
pediatric treatment-naive Ph+ CML-CP to tablet treatment of adult treatment-naive Ph+ CML-CP 
Immunological events 
Dasatinib has not been reported to cause  an antibody production in treated patients. The medication 
may  however  cause  immunomodulatory  effects,  which  also  may  be  important  for  the  effect. 
Lymphocytosis after treatment with dasatinib in chronic myeloid leukaemia is prognostic for the effects 
on response and toxicity in adult CML patients. Patients under 12 years old do not generally have the 
consistent  consecutive  lymphocyte  levels  required  to  meet  the  definition  of  lymphocytosis,  and  thus, 
were  not  included  in  the  analysis  presented  here.  No  definitive  conclusion  can  be  drawn  from  2 
subjects > 12 year pertaining the impact of lymphocytosis. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Specific drug interaction studies have only been conducted in adults. No new information in paediatric 
subjects is available. The interaction with grape-fruit or juice is well known to increase the exposure to 
dasatinib  by  an  inhibition  of  CYP3A4.  The  same  must  be  an  interaction  in  children,  and  some  more 
emphasis is suggested in the PI, than already stated. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Discontinuations due to AEs in paediatric Ph+ leukaemia occur with an acceptable incidence depending 
on  diagnostic  population.  In  particular  in  the  chronic  phase  of  disease,  discontinuation  regardless  of 
causality  and  not  by  any  particular  cause  occurred  in  less  than  5%.  In  both  the  naive  and  imatinib 
resistant/intolerant groups  no  more  than  1  subject  reported  an  AE  leading  to discontinuation  for  any 
particular  preferred  term.  The  result  is  based  on  an  acceptable  number  of  patients  to  support  the 
indication.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Clinical safety in adult CML patients involve aspects like cardiac effects, effusions, infections and bone 
marrow insufficiency, among many others, although manageable. The results on clinical safety in 
children aged 1-18 years-old, exposed in the majority to the medication in more than two years, with 
CML-CP for the assessment of dasatinib in 84 newly diagnosed and in 46 imatinib treated have not 
identified novel issues, and the most frequent AE are dispersed over different manifestations like 
headache, nausea, stomach and intestinal discomfort, physical disability, skin inconveniences and in 
particular leuko-neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia, and a risk of infections – all of which 
affect quality of life in young patients.  
The overall safety profile of SPRYCEL in the paediatric population was similar to that of the adult 
population, regardless of formulation, with the exception of no reported pericardial effusion, pleural 
effusion, pulmonary oedema, or pulmonary hypertension in the paediatric population. Of the 
130 SPRYCEL-treated paediatric subjects with CML-CP, 2 (1.5%) experienced adverse reactions leading 
to treatment discontinuation (see SmPC section 4.8.) 
Dasatinib has a myelosuppressive effect. The difference compared to adult patients is that the AEs may 
more rapidly progress from a mild to a severe clinical situation – infections, diarrhoea possibly most 
important. Unexpectedly, no pleural (or other effusions) were observed in newly diagnosed patients, 
despite an exposure in most patients of more than two years. The pattern of AEs were not significantly 
different in previously imatinib treated patients.  
Even though merely all patients experience some AE, the minor part are severe, and in  CML-CP leads 
to treatment discontinuation in less than 5%.  Severe and fatal  AEs were reported  more frequently in 
advanced  phase  CML  and  Ph+  ALL  than  chronic  phase  CML  as  would  be  expected  based  on  the 
underlying  disease.  In  the  CML-CP  pooled  population,  the  incidence  of  Drug-related  Serious  Adverse 
Events  can  be  considered  low  and  most  events  concern  haematological  toxicity  or  fever/infection.  In 
this population, 4 (8.7%) deaths may appear significant but it is noted that all the cases were reported 
in  the  imatinib  resistant/intolerant  group.  All  subjects  had  progressed  and  deaths  occurred  after  30 
days from last dose. 
In paediatric trials of SPRYCEL in imatinib-resistant/intolerant paediatric patients and treatment-naive 
paediatric patients after at least 2 years of treatment, treatment-related adverse events associated 
with bone growth and development were reported in 6 (4.6%) patients, one of which was severe in 
intensity (Growth Retardation Grade 3). These 6 cases included cases of epiphyses delayed fusion, 
osteopaenia, growth retardation, and gynecomastia (see SmPC section 4.4. and 5.1). These results are 
difficult to interpret in the context of chronic diseases such as CML, and require long-term follow-up 
(see RMP). 
Attention  should  be  paid to  hormonal  effects  or  cardiac  toxicity  during  long-term  treatment,  and  any 
impact is expected to be captured by PSUR.  (Thyroid-) Hormonal adverse events are mentioned in the 
PI  as  a  potential  rare  event.  Aspects  on  male  fertility,  in  an  individual  assessment  and  involving 
parents, as well as the adolescent subject  for semen  deposition before treatment is addressed in the 
SmPC  (section  4.6).  The  point  of  view  on  childhood  CML  as  a  separate  disease  (in  a  major  part)  of 
children  compared  to  adults,  and  the  attitude  towards  a  more  aggressive  treatment  strategy  from 
diagnosis has not been supported by the results obtained on safety in the studies presented.  
Results on safety of the oral suspension, PFOS in CML-CP were pooled with tablet treated patients.  
In the paediatric CML studies, the rate of laboratory anomalies was consistent with the known profile 
for laboratory parameters in adults.

Cardiac effects and other side effects of dasatinib therapy in patients less than 18 years of age will 
continue to be followed by means of routine pharmacovigilance. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile in paediatric patients was comparable to the safety profile in adults. Frequency, type 
and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in adults.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that version 15.3 of the risk management plan is acceptable.  
The applicant is reminded that information of potential for off-label use of the PFOS to the adult 
population for which this indication is not accepted should be considered during the procedure II/59. 
The applicant is further reminded that the PFOS formulation and tablets are not bioequivalent and 
dosing in milligrams for the two Sprycel formulations will be different for the children of the same 
weight. Thus, there might be a potential for medication errors. The applicant should consider whether 
the safety specification should be amended to include the risk of medication errors, and propose risk 
minimisation measures as necessary. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Significance of paediatric studies 
The CHMP is of the opinion that CA180038 and CA180018, which are contained in the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan, P/0118/2013 have been completed after 26 January 2007, are 
considered as significant. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH is seeking to add a paediatric indication to the Ph+ chronic phase CML in the indication.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In paediatric patients, imatinib is the drug of choice and continued until lack of response or intolerable 
side effects. The opportunity to pause TKI in case of many years in deep MR, reflecting a functional 
cure, as in adults has not been proven in children. HSCT is considered in case of disease progression, 
provided a suitable sibling or unrelated donor, but associated with a risk of mortality and chronic 
morbidity, justified by the cure rate of 70-80%. Alternative monotherapy like interferon-alfa is rarely 
used in CML anymore, due to less efficacy and more safety issues than TKI, although without long 
term side-effects. Introduction of 2nd generation TKI like dasatinib may overcome imatinib resistance, 
relapse and intolerance and thereby postpone or eliminate the need for HSCT, with favourable 
prognosis (in adults).  
It is therefore an unmet need to have a second line treatment or an alternative first line treatment in 
CML-CP with a disease-specific TKI. An improved OS has not been demonstrated in adults comparing 
imatinib and dasatinib, but dasatinib do generally induce more rapid CyR and MR than imatinib in TKI 
naïve patients. The administration of tablets to small children is a well-known obstacle, which may 
improve by introduction of a powder for oral suspension (PFOS) of dasatinib. Results are presented as 
well by PFOS treatment in newly diagnosed, paediatric patients. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
 Study  CA180226  is  considered  the  pivotal  trial.  It  is  an  open  label,  Phase  2  worldwide,  multi-centre 
trial  evaluating  the  efficacy  and  safety  in  three  cohorts  below  age  18years:  1:  imatinib  resistant  or 
intolerant  CML-CP  (n=29),  2:  AP,  BC  or  Ph+  acute  leukaemia,  who  are  resistant  /  intolerant  to  or 
relapsed  after  imatinib  treatment  (n  =  58)  and  3:  newly-diagnosed  CML-CP  (TKI-naive),  divided  in 
patients  for  tablet  treatment  (3a,  n=51)  or  PFOS  (3b,  n=33).  After  one  year  treatment,  patients  in 
group  3b  may  use  tablets  instead  of  PFOS.  The  dosage  in  CML-CP  (cohort  1  and  3a)  was  60  mg 
dasatinib/m2 as tablet (which may be dispersed), or in cohort 3b PFOS 72 mg/m2 once daily. Dosing 
was  80  mg/m2  QD  in  cohort  2,  reasoned  by  the  much  more  aggressive  disease  biology.  Study  start 
was 20-03 2009, data-base lock 04-11 2016 in cohort 1, cohort 2 was terminated by MDC due to lack 
of efficacy, and cohort 3 is ongoing. By the time of database closure, in Cohort 3A (tablet dosing), 37 
subjects (72.5%) remained on treatment, and 14 subjects (27.5%) withdrew from treatment and were 
in follow-up. In Cohort 3b (PFOS dosing), 24 subjects (72.7%) remained on treatment, and 9 subjects 
(27.3%) were in follow-up. 
Study  CA180018  is  an  open  label,  phase  1,  dose-escalation  study,  which  included  imatinib 
resistant/intolerant  patients  (n=17).  Some  integrated  efficacy  data  from  Studies  CA180018  and 
CA180226  are  presented  in  the  application  on  subjects  with  imatinib-resistant,  imatinib-intolerant 
(n=46 in total), and imatinib-resistant/intolerant CML-CP and on subjects with advanced CML. Efficacy 
results for newly diagnosed subjects with treatment-naive CML-CP are from Study CA180226.

3.2.   Favourable effects 
Newly diagnosed CML-CP patients: 
Results are presented separately for cohort 3a (tablet, n=51) and 3b (PFOS, n=33) and given in classic 
efficacy  terms  in  CML  treatment,  by  criteria  adopted  from  treatment  in  adult  CML.  For  MCyR  by  6 
months: 90/91%, at 12 months: 98/94%. CCyR by 6 months 67/70%, at 12 months 96/88%, by 24 
months: 96/91% and at any time: 96/91%.  MMR by 6 months: 31/18%, at 12 months: 57/46%, by 
24 months: 75/64% and at any time until data base lock: 88/67%. The deep MR (MR4) was achieved 
by 6 months in 3.9/3.0%, at 12 months 21.6/9.1%, by 24 months 45/30% and at any time 53/36%. 
The complete MR was  obtained at any time  in 43/9%. Accordingly,  a hematologic complete response 
was confirmed in 100/91%, unconfirmed achieved in  100/94%. Five children (9.8%) had progressive 
disease by tablet treatment, one patient (3%) by PFOS treatment. A total of 14 patients (27.5%) and 
9 patients (27.3%) were off-treatment in cohort 3a and 3b, respectively.  
Imatinib resistant/intolerant CML-CP patients: 
Results are presented separately for imatinib resistant and imatinib intolerant patients (n=46), for the 
same parameters of efficacy. For MCyr by 3 months: 56/80%, by 6 months: 79/90%, at 12 months: 
85/100% and by 24 months of treated patients: 85/100%.  The CCyR by 3 months were 44/60%, by 6 
months 74/80%, at 12 months 77/80% and by 24 months 79/90%.  The MMR rate by 3 months 
15/20%, by 6 months 27/30%, at 12 months 41/40%, by 24 months 53/60%. CHR was confirmed at 
any time in 93% and unconfirmed in 100% in cohort 1 in study CA180226 (n=29). A total of 7 patients 
(15%) had progressive, refractory or resistant disease, and 31 patients (67%) were off treatment at 
data base closure in November 2016. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Uncertainty  regarding  the  switch  from  dasatinib  tablets  (60  mg/m2)  to  PFOS  90  mg/m2  treatment  is 
addressed in the PI and will be investigated in a PK "window study" in which eligible subjects already 
on dasatinib tablets (60mg/m2) would switch to PFOS (90 mg/m2) during which time the necessary PK 
samples would be collected. The Applicant has performed an additional detailed feasibility assessment, 
and it is expected that the CSR for this study could be available in 1Q 2020.   
The  PFOS  formulation  and  tablets  are  not  bioequivalent  and  dosing in  milligrams  for  the  two  Sprycel 
formulations  will  be  different  for  the  children  of  the  same  weight  which  is  a  concern  for  potential 
medication  errors.  Appropriate  dosing  instructions  on  switching  are  included  in  the  PI.  The  MAH  will 
take appropriate measures to minimise the risk of medication errors including a further revision of the 
packaging to include a warning about the non-bioquivalence between formulations. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Almost all experienced AEs among newly diagnosed patients (99%), in 66% they were severe. 
Likewise in previously treated patients 96% had an AE of any grade, in 63% the AE was grade 3-4.  
The pattern of AEs in newly diagnosed was very similar to treatment by dasatinib in adults, dominated 
by (all grade / grade 3-4 in %) myelosuppression (54/36%), infections (79/16%), gastrointestinal 
(76/10%), skin (60/4%), general disorders (62/6%) and headache appearing all grades in 46%, 
severe in 1.2%. Musculoskeletal, respiratory AEs were frequent but seldom severe. In previously TKI-
treated patients registration of severe AE were more frequent in musculoskeletal (8.7%), nervous 
system disorders (headache 8.7%), but less severe in myelosuppression (20%). Infections, 
gastrointestinal and other AEs were similar appearing as in newly diagnosed patients. Cardiac

dysfunction and disorders were registered in less than 3% in both groups, less than grade 3. In both 
patient populations laboratory findings reflected the cytopenias induced by TKI. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There is limited data on long-term exposure. It is noted that in the CML-CP pooled population 76 
subjects (58.5%) remained on treatment at the data lock date. Information on long term exposure will 
be collected through PSURs.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Since the efficacy of dasatinib in terms of haematological responses is in line with the known efficacy 
of the product; the lack of bioequivalence of the PFOS and dispersed tablets with the reference tablets 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/302652/2018 
Page 79/82 
  
  
                 
 
 
 
 
has been addressed with a PFOS dose increase to 90 mg/m2. The dosage of 90 mg/m2 PFOS is now 
satisfactorily justified for children < 45 kg from 1 year of age and day 1 in treatment with dasatinib.  
Paediatric and adults patients > 45 kg are likely to have similar physiology and for patients > 45 kg 
PFOS dose of 120 mg is proposed in line with the findings in the adult BE study. This is reflected in the 
SmPC.  
The safety profile in paediatric patients was comparable to the safety profile in adults. Frequency, type 
and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in adults.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The administration of tablets to small children is a well-known problem, which is addressed by the 
introduction of a powder for oral suspension (PFOS) of dasatinib. 
The efficacy and safety of dasatinib PFOS is demonstrated and an appropriate dose is determined.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Sprycel 10 mg/mL powder for oral suspension for the treatment of paediatric 
patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia in 
chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP), or with Ph+ CML-CP resistant or intolerant to prior therapy including 
imatinib, is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Sprycel is not similar to Tasigna (nilotinib) and Iclusig 
(ponatinib) within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See 
appendix1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of, Sprycel 10 mg/mL powder for oral suspension is favourable in the 
following indication: 
Sprycel is indicated for the treatment of paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia 
chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML CP), or with Ph+ 
CML CP resistant or intolerant to prior therapy including imatinib. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Sprycel subject to

Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0118/2013 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
In accordance with Article 45(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, significant studies in the agreed 
paediatric investigation plan P/0118/2013 have been completed after the entry into force of that 
Regulation. 
In addition, CHMP recommends the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation concerning 
the following changes:

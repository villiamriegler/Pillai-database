2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Maviret (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB)) is a fixed-dose combination developed for the treatment of 
chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection is a global health problem, with over 170 million individuals chronically 
infected worldwide.  It is also a major European public health challenge, with a prevalence of 0.4-3.5% in 
different EU member states. Approximately 15 million persons are chronically infected with HCV 
throughout Europe. The prevalence of HCV in the general adult population ranges from ≤0.5% (Northern 
European countries) to ≥3% (Greece, Italy, and Eastern European countries). 
It is the most common single cause of liver transplantation in the European Union. 
Depending on various risk factors, between 10-40% of patients with chronic HCV infection will develop 
cirrhosis over time. Death related to the complications of cirrhosis (mainly liver decompensation and 
hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC) may occur at an incidence of approximately 4% per year. In 2010, more 
than 0.5 million deaths worldwide were attributed to infection with HCV. Curing hepatitis C was shown to 
significantly reduce the risk of disease progression and related mortality, as well as the development of 
HCC. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
There are 6 major hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes and numerous subtypes with prevalence varying by 
geographic region.  
Genotype 1 is the most prevalent in Europe accounting for 70% of chronically infected Europeans with 
GT1b subtype predominating over GT1a in most European countries including those with the highest 
prevalence. Genotype 3 is the next most common genotype in Europe, ranging from 24.8% to 30.4% of 
HCV cases followed by GT2 which ranges from 0.1% to 10.4%. Genotype 5 has only been reported in 
Western Europe, comprising not more than 2% of all HCV genotypes; GT6 comprises less than 1% of HCV 
genotypes in any of the EU nations. HCV GT4 has become increasingly prevalent in Southern European 
countries where prevalence rates among HCV-infected patients of 10–24% have been reported. 
Chronic hepatitis C is a serious disease and is the leading cause of liver transplantation in the developed 
world and the most common chronic blood borne infection in both the United States and Europe with 
approximately 80% of infected individuals becoming chronically infected. 
In these patients, chronic hepatic inflammation and fibrosis persist over several decades. Depending on 
various risk factors, between 10% and 40% of patients with chronic HCV infection will develop cirrhosis. 
Death related to the complications of cirrhosis may occur at an incidence of approximately 4% per year; 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurs in this population at an estimated incidence of 1% to 5% per year. 
Patients diagnosed with HCC have a 33% probability of death during the first year. In 2010, more than 0.5 
million deaths worldwide were attributed to infection with HCV. In addition to liver-related morbidity and 
mortality, HCV infection is related to extrahepatic complications including cryoglobulinemia, renal 
disease, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular complications. 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 8/126 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
Clinically, the infection is generally asymptomatic but it may present with a wide variety of symptoms 
from nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue or malaise to symptoms characteristic of complications from 
advanced or decompensated liver disease related to synthetic dysfunction and portal hypertension. Other 
manifestations include cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, cryoglobulinemia and glomerulonephritis, as 
described above. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Successful eradication of HCV has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of disease progression and 
related mortality as well as the development of HCC. Sustained virological response (SVR) is also 
associated with reduced occurrence of the extrahepatic complications diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD) and cardiovascular events and a decrease in all-cause mortality. 
Treatment of HCV infection has progressed considerably within the last years thanks to the development 
of several specifically-targeted antiviral drugs, directed against essential HCV proteins (direct-acting 
agents, DAAs). Several IFN-free DAA regimens are currently available in Europe and allows high rate of 
virological cure (>90%) with generally 12 weeks of treatment in a convenient fixed dose combination. 
However, the approved and recommended regimens are not equally potent across all HCV genotypes and 
subpopulations. Notably, efficacy is reduced in patients with baseline viral variants resistant to NS5A 
inhibitors, especially in patients with GT1a or GT3. Despite the high SVR rates achieved with current DAA 
regimens, the infection is not eliminated from a substantial number of patients (1-9% in GT1 and even 
more in GT3 cirrhotics who represent nowadays the most difficult to treat population) and there is 
currently limited retreatment options for patients who have failed IFN-free treatment regimens. 
Additional limitations of several current regimens include the requirement of ribavirin for certain 
populations, significant drug to drug interactions, limited options for subjects with renal insufficiency. 
Overall, beyond the need for an improved option for GT3 patients having pejorative factors at baseline 
(baseline NS5A RAS, cirrhosis), there remains a true unmet medical need in some situation of 
retreatment, notably in patients with genotype 3 and prior NS5A failure (with Y93H quasi universally 
selected in case of failure compromising response to subsequent lines of therapy). Moreover, as 
sofosbuvir is not recommended in patients with severe renal disease and as grazoprevir/elbasvir was 
approved for severe renal disease patients with infections due to HCV GT1 and GT4 only, the situation of 
patients with GT2, GT3 and GT5-6 with CKD stage 4 and 5, including those on dialysis, is currently not 
covered. There is also a need for salvage therapy that does not contain sofosbuvir for the small subset of 
patients with DAA-failure and CKD stage 4-5. 
About the product 
Maviret is a fixed dose combination (FDC) of two next generation DAAs: glecaprevir, (GLE, ABT-493), an 
inhibitor of HCV NS3/4A protease which is necessary for the proteolytic cleavage of the HCV encoded 
polyprotein and pibrentasvir (PIB, ABT-530), an inhibitor of HCV NS5A, showing potent pan-genotypic 
activity in vitro with limited cross-resistance with earlier DAAs, and minimal renal elimination. 
The GLE/PIB registrational program included a broad subject population across all genotypes : 
treatment-naive and treatment-experienced (to (peg)IFN, ribavirin, sofosbuvir) patients with or without 
(compensated) cirrhosis, patients with CKD stage 4-5, HIV-HCV co-infected patients and 
DAA-experienced patients to NS5A inhibitor and/or NS3/4A PI. 
The FDC is to be taken orally once daily with food with the following regimen:

Type of Application and aspects on development 
CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered to 
be of major public health interest. This was based on its potent pan-genotypic activity in vitro with limited 
cross-resistance with earlier DAAs and on its minimal renal elimination, which was seen as conferring 
added value to respond to the unmet medical need. CHMP agreed that the above constitute an important 
therapeutic innovation compared to previously available NS5A inhibitors. 
Overall, the fact that Maviret could be used in patients with CKD was welcomed.  Based on PK data, 
including a PK study in patients with renal impairment and on the data from the dedicated phase III study 
in patients with CKD stage 4 and 5, including patents on haemodialysis, CHMP considered Maviret to 
represent an additional option for patients with severe renal impairment and that it would address an 
unmet medical need.

General information 
The chemical name of glecaprevir is (3aR,7S,10S,12R,21E,24aR)-7-tert-butyl-N-{(1R,2R)- 
2-(difluoromethyl)-1-[(1-methylcyclopropane-1-sulfonyl)carbamoyl]cyclopropyl}-20,20-difluoro-5,8-di
oxo-2,3,3a,5,6,7,8,11,12,20,23,24a-dodecahydro-1H,10H-9,12-methanocyclopenta 
[18,19][1,10,17,3,6]-trioxadiazacyclononadecino-[11,12-b]quinoxaline-10-carboxamide hydrate 
corresponding to the molecular formula C 38H46F4N6O9S (anhydrate) and C38H 46F4N6O9S •  xH2O 
(hydrate). It has a relative molecular mass 838.87 g/mol (anhydrate) and has the following structure: 
Figure 1 - Structure of glecaprevir 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of mass spectrometry (MS), 
infrared (IR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Glecaprevir is 
sufficiently characterised and its structure is adequately elucidated. 
Glecaprevir appears as a white to off-white crystalline powder. It shows pH dependent solubility in 
aqueous media, being practically insoluble at pH 2.1 and 5.1 and very slightly soluble at pH 6.6. Its pka 
values were found to be 4.0 and 11.7 and the partition coefficient (Log P) 2.5 at pH 7.4.  
Glecaprevir has seven stereogenic centers and is manufactured as a single stereoisomer and its chiral 
purity is controlled through in-process controls and specifications for starting materials and 
intermediates. The molecule does also contain a double bond with E (trans) configuration. 
The active substance exhibits polymorphism. A number of crystalline forms of glecaprevir have been 
identified but it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process consistently produces the same 
crystalline form, which has been shown that it does not change during the proposed re-test period. It is 
characterized and controlled by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) analysis.  
Glecaprevir active substance is qualified as a new active substance in itself as it has been demonstrated 
that it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The synthesis of glecaprevir comprises five steps using four starting materials. All starting materials are 
controlled by suitable specifications. The intermediates have been defined. The proposed limits and 
specifications for the isolated intermediates have been acceptably justified based on the development 
studies along with supportive batch data and these are considered sufficient to guarantee the quality of 
the final drug substance. 
Critical and non-critical process steps and parameters have been identified and adequate in-process 
controls are applied during the synthesis of the active substance. The characterisation of the active 
Assessment report

substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active 
substances.  
The potential impurities are controlled in the active substance by validated test methods. It has been 
demonstrated that the impurities are generally adequately controlled during manufacturing of the active 
substance. The proposed tests and acceptance criteria for glecaprevir active substance are considered 
acceptable and justified.  
Glecaprevir is packaged in double low density polyethylene (LDPE) bags, placed in high density 
polyethylene (HDPE) or fiber drums (secondary packaging). The LDPE bags used as primary packaging 
material are food grade and comply with the requirements of Ph. Eur. and European Directive 10/2011 as 
amended.  
Specification 
The glecaprevir specification includes appropriate tests and limits for appearance (visual), solution (Ph. 
Eur.), identification (IR, HPLC), polymorphism (XRPD), particle size distribution, assay, impurities, 
residual solvents, sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.) and 
acetamide (GC). 
The origin, fate and control of mutagenic or potentially mutagenic impurities have been described in detail 
including adequate spiking experiments as applicable and the results thereof. The provided data is 
considered sufficient and the proposed control strategy, which is in line with the recommendations and 
principles outlined in the ICH M7 guideline, is acceptable. 
However, particularly with regard to the levels of a particular impurity, in order to obtain further 
confirmation that the control limit will be consistently met the CHMP has requested results from a 
sufficient number of commercial batches of glecaprevir analysis to demonstrate consistent compliance 
with the control limit (post authorisation recommendation). 
The control strategy for solvents is considered acceptable and appropriate limits for residual solvents are 
included in the glecaprevir specification. In addition, residual solvent data on 10 batches of glecaprevir 
are provided. For those residual solvents that results were below 10% of the ICH Q3C option 1 limit or 
10% of the claimed PDEs no control test is deemed necessary. 
Omission of testing for certain metals (used in the synthesis of starting materials) and elemental 
impurities has been sufficiently justified in line with ICH Q3D. 
Sufficient evidence has been provided regarding the control of chiral purity. 
The analytical procedures used in the control of the active substance have generally been satisfactorily 
described and validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Information regarding the reference 
standards used in the analytical testing is satisfactory. 
Batch analysis data from nine production scale batches of the active substance were provided. The results 
are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three pilot scale batches of glecaprevir from the clinical manufacturing site, stored in the 
intended commercial package for up to 12 months under long term conditions at 30°C / 75% RH, and for 
up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. The planned length of study is 48 months. Supplemental stability data provided include data for 
three batches up to commercial scale from the proposed manufacturing site. These studies have been 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017

initiated for all three batches and data is available for two batches through 9 months and one batch 
through 6 months under long term conditions (30 °C / 75 % RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75 % RH). 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, impurities, water content, crystal form and microbial quality. 
The test methods were the same as for release and are stability indicating. No significant changes were 
observed over the course of the stability studies apart from an upward trend show in water content which 
remain within the specification. This trend is attributed to the intrinsic nature of the active substance 
which is a non-stoichiometric, labile hydrate. No impact of water content increase on degradation and 
crystalline form is evidenced. 
Photostability testing on two pilot scale batches following the ICH guideline Q1B was also conducted and 
results confirmed that the active substance is sensitive to light. Therefore, glecaprevir active substance 
must be packaged in its secondary storage container, to ensure adequate protection from exposure to 
high intensity light. 
Additionally, results on temperature excursion and temperature cycling stability studies performed in one 
of the primary stability study on drug substance batches were provided. All stability data obtained after 
these studies met the requirements of the shelf-life specification. No adverse results were observed for all 
parameters tested besides an increase in water content remaining however within specification. 
Temperature excursion studies are also included supporting temperature excursions during shipping of up 
to 50°C for 1 month. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months of glecaprevir 
stored at or below 30°C in the proposed container closure system.  
Pibrentasvir

Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 13/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of mass spectrometry (MS), 
infrared (IR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Pibrentasvir is 
sufficiently characterised and its structure is adequately elucidated. 
Pibrentasvir active substance is a white to off-white to light yellow non-hygroscopic crystalline powder, 
practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in ethanol. It shows pH dependant solubility in aqueous 
media, being very slightly soluble at pH 1.1 and practically insoluble at and above pH 2.1. It also shows 
low passive permeability. Its pKa values were found to be 3.5, 4.1 and 11.6 and the partition coefficient 
(logP) is 7.5. 
Pibrentasvir has eight stereogenic centres and is manufactured as a single isomer. The optical purity of 
the chiral centres is controlled in the starting materials. Epimerisation of all eight chiral centers during the 
manufacturing process to form the enantiomer of pibrentasvir is not possible. The stereoisomeric purity of 
the active substance is controlled through the starting material specifications and the design of the 
manufacturing process. The determination of the stereochemistry in the starting materials in combination 
with confirmation of the relative stereochemistry of pibrentasvir and stereochemical controls on process 
materials provides unequivocal proof of the stereochemistry of pibrentasvir. 
Pibrentasvir molecule exhibits polymorphism and a number of crystalline forms have been identified as 
solvates but it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process consistently produces the same 
crystalline form. The crystalline form of the active substance does not change during the proposed re-test 
period. The crystalline form is characterized and controlled by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) analysis.   
Pibrentasvir active substance is qualified as a new active substance in itself as it has been demonstrated 
that it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Pibrentasvir active substance is manufactured by a six-stage process from four starting materials which 
are well-defined and controlled by acceptable specifications. 
The tests and acceptance criteria for the starting materials, in process controls and isolated intermediates 
are complete and sufficiently justified by purge studies. 
Adequate in-process controls and critical process parameters have been identified and applied during the 
synthesis. 
The potential impurities are controlled in the active substance by validated test methods. It has been 
demonstrated that the impurities are generally adequately controlled during manufacturing of the active 
substance. The proposed tests and acceptance criteria for pibrentasvir active substance are considered 
acceptable and justified. 
Purging of non-mutagenic and mutagenic impurities originating from the starting materials has been 
adequately demonstrated. Some of the non-mutagenic impurities persist through the manufacturing 
process. However, these impurities are controlled in the starting materials with acceptance criteria 
justified by the purge experiments and the corresponding daughter impurities are additionally individually 
controlled in the active substance. The formation, fate and purging of impurities are adequately discussed 
and appropriate controls are generally proposed. However, particularly with regard to the levels of a 
particular impurity, in order to obtain further confirmation that the control limit will be consistently met 
the CHMP has requested results from a sufficient number of commercial batches of pibrentasvir analysis 
to demonstrate consistent compliance with the control limit (post authorisation recommendation).

Pibrentasvir is packaged in double low density polyethylene (LDPE) bags, placed in a high-density 
polyethylene (HDPE) or fibre drum. The polythene bags used as primary packaging material are food 
grade and comply with the requirements of Ph. Eur. and European Directive 10/2011 as amended.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for appearance (visual), clarity 
and colour of solution (Ph. Eur.), identification (IR, HPLC), crystal form (XRPD), particle size (laser 
diffraction), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), elemental impurities (ICP-OES), residual solvents (GS), 
sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), water content, (Ph. Eur.), microbiologic quality (Ph. Eur.) and acetamide (GC). 
 The specifications are based on batch analyses of several batches of the drug substance prepared by the 
commercial process, and batches used for clinical and toxicological and stability data. The proposed 
specification is acceptable and adequately justified.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described, validated and are suitable for the quality 
control of pibrentasvir drug substance. Information regarding the reference standards used in the 
analytical testing is satisfactory. 
Batch analysis data from 17 pilot scale and 1 commercial scale batches of the active substance were 
provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three pilot scale batches of active substance from the site for clinical manufacture stored 
in the intended commercial packaging for up to 18 months under long term conditions (30 °C / 75 % RH) 
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75 % RH) was provided according to the 
ICH guidelines. The planned length of study is 48 months. Supplemental stability data include data for 
three batches up to commercial scale from the proposed manufacturing site. These studies have been 
initiated for all three batches and data is available for two batches through 9 months and one batch 
through 3 months under long term conditions (30 °C / 75 % RH) and for up to 6 months  and 3 months, 
respectively, under accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75 % RH). 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, impurities, water content, microbiological quality and 
polymorphism. The test methods were the same as for release and are stability indicating. No significant 
changes to any of the measured parameters were observed under long term and accelerated conditions 
and all remained within specification. 
Photostability testing on one pilot scale following the ICH guideline Q1B was provided and confirm that the 
active substance is photosensitive. The results also demonstrate that the primary storage container 
provides sufficient light protection. Pibrentasvir must be stored in its secondary storage container to 
ensure adequate protection from exposure to high intensity light. 
Stress testing during analytical method validation (temperature degradation, hydrolysis, acid and base 
exposure, photo-degradation and oxidation) was also performed. No degradation was observed under the 
conditions tested. Stress testing of pibrentasvir was also performed by subjecting pibrentasvir active 
substance to thermal cycling and thermal excursions. The data generated support temperature 
excursions during shipping of up to 50°C for 1 month. 
The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months when stored at or below 30°C in the 
commercial packaging. Stability data for production site-specific batches are comparable to the primary 
stability batch data.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is an immediate release film coated tablet containing 100 mg of glecaprevir and 40 
mg of pibrentasvir. The film-coated tablets are pink, oblong, biconvex, with “NXT” debossed on one side, 
the other side being plain intended for oral administration. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 
of the SmPC. 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development work was to develop a stable formulation containing 100 mg 
of glecaprevir and 40 mg of pibrentasvir.  A systematic approach was taken to develop the tablet 
formulation and manufacturing process. The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as follows: 
an oral dosage form containing 100 mg of glecaprevir and 40 mg of pibrentasvir of acceptable 
appearance, meeting the relevant compendial requirements for this pharmaceutical form, comprised of 
known excipients and stable in different climatic zones. An initial list of product critical quality attributes 
(CQAs) was generated based on the QTPP. Subsequently, a systematic evaluation, understanding, and 
refinement of the manufacturing process were carried out using design of experiments, statistical 
analysis, simulations, and mathematical models were undertaken to define the relationship of the 
material attributes and process parameters to the product CQAs. After determining the CQAs, critical 
process parameters (CPPs), and in-process controls (IPCs), the control strategy was defined to ensure 
final product quality. A final risk assessment was then completed to demonstrate risks previously 
identified are mitigated using the proposed control strategy. 
Both active substances, glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, are poorly water soluble compounds. The solubility 
of both glecaprevir and pibrentasvir in aqueous media at 25 °C is a function of pH. Glecaprevir’s, solubility 
is not measurable at pH 2.0 and increases to 843 μg/mL at pH 6.8. Pibrentasvir’s solubility was not 
measurable at pH ≥ 3.3 at 25°C. It increased to 1.5 μg/mL at pH 2.6 and to ~0.4 mg/mL at pH 1.0. Based 
on their biopharmaceutical properties they are individually formulated as amorphous solid dispersions to 
increase the apparent aqueous solubility and obtain adequate in vivo absorption. Several particle sizes 
distribution (PSD) of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir active substances were evaluated in the blending and  
amorphous solid dispersion processes and appropriate PSD specifications were set to meet the finished 
product critical quality attributes (CQAs). 
The choice and amount of excipients have been based on the evaluation of product manufacturability and 
performance. Vitamin E (tocopherol) polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) and propylene glycol 
monocaprylate (PGMC II) quantities in the final dose of Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir film-coated tablets 
comply with tolerable upper intake level established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and 
the acceptable daily intake (ADI) determined by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health 
Organization (FAO/WHO) Expert Committee on Food Additives respectively. All the tablet core excipients 
comply with Ph. Eur. or NF monographs. The coating agent powder is non-compendial but itis components 
are of Ph. Eur. or NF (iron oxide) quality. The compatibility between the active substances and the 
excipients is demonstrated by the finished product stability studies.  
The Phase 1 first in human clinical studies were conducted with formulated tablets (formulations of 
individual glecaprevir and pibrentasvir tablets) at strengths of 2.5 and 25 mg for glecaprevir tablets and 
1.5 and 15 mg for pibrentasvir tablets. The majority of Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies were 
conducted with formulated tablets at strengths of 100 mg for glecaprevir tablets and 40 mg for 
Assessment report

pibrentasvir tablets. The individual tablets were co-administered in the clinical studies. The commercial 
formulation was used in all Phase 2 extension and Phase 3 clinical studies and stability studies.  
The manufacturing of amorphous solid dispersions was optimised to achieve the QTTP requirements, 
ensure stability of the active substances and intermediates and manufacturability. 
Film-coated tablets  
A co-formulated tablet composed of the two intermediates was chosen. The dosage form allows both 
glecaprevir and pibrentasvir to be formulated in the same tablet.  Human PK studies were conducted to 
compare the in vivo performance of the uncoated fixed dose combination formulation with the single dose 
tablets containing 100 mg glecaprevir and 40 mg pibrentasvir used in phase II. The exposures of 
glecaprevir and pibrentasvir released from the uncoated tablet are stated to be comparable. 
The film-coating is non-functional and dissolution is similar between uncoated and coated tablets 
indicating that there is no relevant impact of film-coating on drug release over the ranges examined. 
The dissolution test method has been selected based on the physicochemical properties of the active 
substances, dissolution profiles of various amorphous formulations, dissolution performance at different 
conditions (media, apparatus, speed) and discriminating capability with respect to composition and 
manufacturing parameters.  
Different types and amounts of surfactants have been evaluated. The concentration of the surfactant has 
been justified mainly based on solubility considerations.  The rotation speed has been sufficiently 
justified. The chosen medium has been selected based on the aqueous solubility of both substances and 
the fact that similar dissolution profiles could be obtained for both substances.  
The dissolution method has been shown discriminating with respect to certain formulation changes and 
process parameters. The evaluation of the dissolution profiles has been done by comparison of f1 and f2 
values. 
Regarding manufacturing process development, it was guided by a combination of univariate and 
multivariate experiments. 
The interaction of critical process parameters (CPPs) was assessed for the glecaprevir and pibrentasvir 
intermediates by applying design of experiments (DOE) to both the blending and amorphous solid 
dispersion unit operations. The proposed CPPS ranges were suitably demonstrated through multivariate 
experiments and interactions between the process parameters and material attributes were addressed. In 
addition the proposed process parameter ranges are also adequately supported by the experience gained 
during development and manufacture of clinical and stability batches.  
The container closure system of Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir film-coated tablets, 100 mg/40 mg is a blister 
made of clear polyvinyl chloride / polyethylene/ polychorotrifluoroethene (PVC/PE/PCTFE) polymer and 
aluminium foil with vinyl heat seal coating. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process can be divided in two steps. The first step of the process comprises 
preparation of the glecaprevir and pibrentasvir intermediates and the second step of the process includes 
tableting and film-coating. 
The manufacturing process of both intermediates and the film-coated tablets has been described in 
sufficient detail and is considered a standard process for solid oral dosage forms taking also into 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 17/126 
 
 
 
 
 
consideration the manufacturer’s prior knowledge and experience gained through the development and 
commercial manufacture of similar products marketed. 
The critical process parameters (CPPs) have been thoroughly justified in the dossier.  
The critical process parameters and their acceptable ranges as well the in-process controls (IPCs) during 
the manufacturing process have been presented and are adequately justified. No critical process 
parameters have been identified for the amorphous solid dispersion unit operations. The control strategy 
ensures that the manufacturing process consistently delivers a product that meets the defined criteria for 
all release specifications.  
The manufacturing process for the film-coated tablets will be validated prior to marketing according to an 
acceptable process validation scheme which has been provided. Process validation will be performed on at 
least three commercial scale batches of the respective intermediates and film-coated tablets, which is 
acceptable. Additional sampling will be performed during the manufacturing of the intermediates and 
tablet manufacture. 
In conclusion, it is considered that the manufacturing process is sufficiently robust to provide assurance 
that film-coated tablets of consistent quality, complying with the designated specification, are produced. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for 
description (visual), identification of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (HPLC, UV), assay of glecaprevir and 
pibrentasvir (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), degradation products of glecaprevir and 
pibrentasvir (HPLC), dissolution of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.) and 
microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of 
finished product has been presented. 
Absence of crystallinity is controlled at the intermediate level and it is not considered necessary to include 
the test in the finished product specification. With respect to the absence of crystallinity the products are 
stable and no crystallisation has been observed during the manufacture of the product or in stability 
studies. The control strategy for minimizing crystallinity has been described in detail and is considered 
acceptable. 
Regarding dissolution, since the release of both active substances occurs over a period exceeding 60 
minutes, a two-point specification for both glecaprevir and pibrentasvir is proposed to provide a better 
control of the dissolution profile. 
A risk assessment according to ICH Q3D option 2b has been performed for the product considering all 
potential sources. The estimated maximum daily exposure levels of all potential elemental impurities 
were less than the control threshold level (30% of the PDE). In addition, seven production scale batches 
have been screened for ICH Q3D Class 1 and Class 2 elements. In every batch, the levels were well below 
30% of the oral PDE. Therefore no testing of elemental impurities will be performed on the finished 
product. 
Batch analysis data for 3 production scale batches, 6 intermediate scale batches and 3 primary stability 
batches have been presented. All batches were manufactured at the commercial manufacturing site. The 
results show that the finished product can be manufactured with consistent quality and meeting its 
specifications. 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017

Stability of the product 
Three primary stability batches of film-coated tablets manufactured at the proposed manufacturer (at 
about 40% of commercial batch scale) and stored in the package proposed for marketing have been 
studied under long term conditions (30°C/75% RH) for up to 18 months and under accelerated conditions 
(40°C/75% RH) for 6 months according to the ICH Stability Guidelines. Samples were tested for 
appearance, assay, degradation products, water content, dissolution, water activity, crystallinity and 
microbial quality. The analytical methods are the same as for release testing and are stability indicating. 
No meaningful change is observed in any attribute studied at long-term and accelerated storage 
condition. All data reported comply with the proposed specifications and no trends were observed. 
Stability data of clinical batches showed absence of crystallinity by XPRD for all batches investigated, even 
when water content levels reached 11.0%. 
Stability of bulk film-coated tablets when stored in the proposed container closure system (heat-sealed 
laminated foil (aluminium) bags) has also been investigated. A holding time of 12 months is considered 
adequately supported by presented data. It has been confirmed that the manufacturing date is 
established as the date of first mixing of an excipient with drug substance. 
A photostability study was carried out on the primary batches according to ICH Q1B Guideline. The results 
indicate that the film-coated tablets are not sensitive to light therefore storage restrictions are not 
considered necessary.  
Additional stability data on the primary stability batches include temperature excursion studies (-20°C for 
0.5 months, 5°C for 12 months, 50°C/75%RH for 0.5 months), temperature cycling studies (9 months at 
30°C/75%RH then cycling from -20°C to 50°C/75% RH over 35 days followed by 30°C/75% RH). Stability 
was assessed for description, assay, degradation products, dissolution, water content and crystallinity. 
No meaningful change was observed. These studies support exposure of the drug product to short periods 
of freezing or high temperatures that may be encountered during shipping. 
Based on the provided stability data, the proposed shelf life of 30 months without any special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
There are no materials of human or animal origin used in the manufacture of the finished product. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that from 
a quality perspective the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017

CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
•  Results from a sufficient number of commercial batches of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir acetamide 
analysis to demonstrate consistent compliance with the control limit. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Glecaprevir was evaluated in both HCV NS3/4A protease cleavage enzyme assays and HCV subgenomic 
replicon cell-based assays for inhibition of HCV. Glecaprevir displays low nanomolar (IC50 = 3.5 – 11.3 
nM) activity against HCV genotypes 1 - 6 in enzymatic assays and was active against the genotype 1a, 1b, 
2a, 2b, 3a, 4a and 6a (EC50 = 0.85 to 4.6 nM) replicons in vitro. Glecaprevir was more than 10000-fold 
more selective for inhibition of human HCV NS3/4A protease compared to representative 
human/mammalian polymerases. 
In the in vitro replicon transient transfection assay, pibrentasvir retained its activity against a panel of 74 
clinical samples from HCV genotypes 1-6 infected subjects, with an EC50 median value of 1.1 pM (range 
0.27 to 3.5 pM). 
Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir did not exhibit antiviral activity against HIV-1 or HBV. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Receptor screening:  
Glecaprevir (10 μM) displaced control-specific binding by greater than 50% only at the chloride (Cl-) 
channel, (IC50 11 μM), and has a weak effect on AT1, A1, BZD, CCK1, NK2 and 5-HT1b. These effects are 
not likely to be of clinical significance considering that the in vitro screening was performed at 10 µM and 
that the reported Cmax plasma level of GLE is 1.4 µM and considering the high binding to plasma proteins.  
Pibrentasvir (10 μM) did not displace control-specific binding by greater than 50% at any receptors, ion 
channels, or transporters. Minor effect observed for BZD (-33%), CCK1 (-20%), ETa (-19%), H1 (-22%), 
Y2 (-23%), 5-HT1b (-20%); 5HT2a (-19%), σ (-21%) at 10µM. These effects are not likely to be of 
clinical significance considering that the in vitro screening was performed at 10 µM and that the reported 
Cmax plasma level of PIB is 0.09 µM and considering the high binding to plasma proteins.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Central nervous system: GLE and PIB did not give any CNS/neurobehavioral effects in rats or mouse 
respectively at doses up to 100 mg/kg.  
Cardiovascular: The IC50 for inhibition of hERG tail current was 85.6 μg/mL for GLE, higher than the 
reported Cmax plasma level (1.11 µg/ml).  
Glecaprevir produced no major cardiovascular effects up to 100 mg/kg oral in conscious dogs and up to 
0.553 µg/kg/min IV in anaesthetised dogs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 20/126 
 
 
 
 
 
Pibrentasvir produced no significant block (<2%) of hERG tail current at 1.11 µg/ml, higher than the 
reported Cmax plasma level (0.1 µg/ml), and no major cardiovascular effects up to 100 mg/kg oral in 
conscious dog, or up to 19 µg/kg/min IV in anesthetized dog. 
Respiratory: Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir produced no major respiratory effects up to 60 mg/kg oral in 
rats or 100 mg/kg oral in mouse, respectively. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
See section 2.4.3. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) in plasma samples of mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and monkey. Metabolites in 
plasma, urine, faeces, bile, hepatocyte and liver microsomal incubations from mouse, rat and dog ADME 
(absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) studies were separated by HPLC, detected by on-line 
radioflow detection, identified and structurally elucidated by MS/MS. The bioanalytical methods are 
considered adequate by CHMP.  
Absorption 
GLE is rapidly absorbed with Tmax <1h in all species but monkeys (Tmax: 2.8h), with a bioavailability of 
>90% in rodents, and lower for dogs (44%) and monkeys (26%) and quickly eliminated with a half–life 
of 1.7-4.3 hours in all species tested (mice, rat, dog, monkey), as compared to 6.6 h in humans. 
Glecaprevir plasma concentrations in fasted dogs were slightly higher than those obtained in fed animals 
(solution formulation). No major difference is observed between genders. 
PIB is slowly absorbed with Tmax of 3.7-9h in all species, with a bioavailability of <10% in rodents, and 
slightly higher for dogs (29.8%) and monkeys (14.1%), and quickly eliminated with a half–life of 5.7-12.9 
hours in all species tested (mice, rat, dog, monkey), as compared to 14.9h in humans. 
Due to the species differences in exposures in rodents, mice have been chosen for multiple dose toxicity 
studies. After multiple doses, no difference is observed between genders in all species. 
Plasma protein binding and blood-plasma ratios 
GLE and PIB are highly bound to plasma proteins. Mean blood-to-plasma concentration ratios were 0.64, 
0.60, 0.55, 0.75 and 0.57 in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human, respectively for GLE. Concerning PIB, 
blood-to-plasma concentration ratios were 0.59, 0.57, 0.66, 0.60 and 0.62 in mouse, rat, dog, monkey 
and human, respectively. 
Tissue distribution 
GLE was widely distributed in most tissues with peak levels at 0.5-2 hours, and radioactivity declined to 
below the limit of quantification at 24h, except in liver (highly distributed: ratio tissue / blood up to 269, 
and persist up to 96h post dose), large and small intestine. GLE is present in the brain only at 0.5h post 
dose at very low concentrations, and in eye uveal tract and skin up to 8h post dose even if the 
radioactivity is low. No major affinity has been observed for tissues containing melanin. 
PIB was widely distributed in most tissues with a peak levels at 4-8 hours. Highest concentrations are in 
bile, adrenal gland, liver and small intestine. Radioactivity declined to below the limit of quantification at 
24h, except in the Harderian gland, preputial gland, prostate gland, salivary gland, stomach, thymus,

urinary bladder, cecum/large intestine. PIB is not present in the brain and eye. No major affinity has been 
observed for tissues containing melanin. 
Metabolism / Excretion 
GLE is the major component and all metabolites observed in all species are minor. GLE was cleared 
primarily through the biliary/faecal route in rat, dog and human, with minimal excretion in urine.  
PIB is scarcely metabolized in all species, and is eliminated in faeces as unchanged parent drug. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profiles of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir have been evaluated in a comprehensive set of 
non-clinical studies where the compounds have been evaluated separately. The performed studies include 
repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 6 months in rodents and 9 months in dogs, in vitro and in vivo 
genotoxicity, male and female fertility and early embryonic development in rodents, embryo-foetal 
development toxicity in rodents and rabbits, peri- and post-natal development studies in rodents, 
phototoxicity studies and impurity qualifying studies. In addition, one combination repeat-dose study has 
also been performed. 
The main species for toxicological evaluation were rat and dog for glecaprevir and mouse and dog for 
pibrentasvir. The test species were justified as the rodent and non-rodent species with the highest 
systemic exposure. All selected species are considered as relevant from a metabolite perspective.  
Both glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are lipophilic, with minimal aqueous solubility and the effect of 
formulation and dose defined the maximum feasible exposures in all toxicology species. 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies were conducted with glecaprevir. One pharmacokinetic study with 
intravenous administration in rabbits was conducted with pibrentasvir.  
Mortality was observed in  two rabbits after intravenous administration of pibrentasvir at 50 mg/kg, while 
a dose of 5 mg/kg was well tolerated. The Applicant appreciated that the pibrentasvir plasma 
concentrations following the 50 mg/kg dose likely exceeded the 40 μg/mL solubility limit for pibrentasvir 
in plasma and this may have contributed to the observed mortality. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The species selected for the definitive toxicology studies are rats and dogs for glecaprevir and mouse and 
dogs for pibrentasvir on the basis of similarities in their pharmacokinetic and metabolic profiles to human. 
Concerning GLE, repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats and dogs for up to 4, 26 and 
39 weeks, respectively. 8 unscheduled deaths (3, 1, 1, 3 rats in the control group, 10, 40, and 120 mg/kg 
respectively) have been observed in the 26-weeks rats study. 
The toxicological profile of GLE was mainly characterized by gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity associating 
clinical signs and histological lesions of the stomach (neutrophilic infiltration, ulceration / necrosis) at very 
high doses in rat (>120 mg/kg from 2 week study), hyperplasia and inflammation with degeneration 
muscle of oesophagus in mice treated for 4 weeks. 
Gastro-intestinal toxicity (faecal effect, infiltration in stomach in some dogs, necrosis muscle in 
oesophagus in one dog) was also observed in dogs, with gallbladder oedema after 2 and 13 weeks of 
treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 22/126 
 
 
 
 
 
GLE was also characterized by hematologic changes in all species. 
GLE has also an impact on AST/ALT and/or GGT in dogs without major histopathologic correlates. No 
major hepatic findings have been observed in rats but focal mild necrosis of the liver correlating with 
increased liver enzymes (AST (+9.0-fold) and ALT (+7.7-fold)) in one female treated at the mid dose for 
26 weeks in rats, and necrosis in 2 rats at the high dose after 13 weeks. 
Concerning PIB, repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats and dogs for up to 26, 13 and 
39 weeks, respectively. Deaths have been observed in all study in mice but the 7-day study. 
No major adverse effects have been identified at maximal feasible exposures (8 μg•hr/mL in rat, 123 
μg•hr/mL in mouse and 25 μg•hr/mL in dog). 
Decreases in absolute reticulocytes (-25% to -62%) in the 39-week study in dog were noted, without 
concurrent decrease in RBC mass; this was reversible. 
Moreover, PIB induced lung adenoma in one male at high dose in 1 month mice study, a benign 
hepatocellular adenoma in liver and benign bronchiolar-alveolar adenoma in lung in one male at high dose 
in 26-weeks mice study, mammary adenocarcinoma in one female at high dose in 13-weeks rats study. 
However, these effects are interpreted as being incidental as they are common background findings in 
these species. 
Due to cardiovascular issues observed with other products indicated for the treatment of HCV, 
cardiotoxicity with GLE and PIB has been investigated. CHMP noted that neither GLE nor PIB did induce 
major findings in safety pharmacology studies.  
CHMP also noted that some cardiac toxicities have been observed in repeat dose toxicity studies with both 
substances: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
increase of minimal infiltration mononuclear cell in heart in rats treated for 13-weeks with GLE at 
the high dose (5M at 120 mg/kg/d versus 3M in control); 
higher incidence of cardiomyopathy in female in rats treated for 26-weeks with GLE at the high 
dose (9F at 60 versus 4F in control) 
papillary fronds in heart in dogs (1F) treated for 2 weeks with GLE at the low dose 
hyperplasia (1M at 20 mg/kg, 1M 1F at 60mg/kg) and infiltration 1F at 60 mg/kg in heart in dogs 
treated for 13 weeks with GLE at lower doses. 
higher incidence of sinus bradycardia and Second degree AV block in dogs treated for 39 weeks 
with GLE at high doses. Moreover potassium level have been decreased by GLE in rat treated for 
26 weeks (-15% to -16% in M), and in 4-weeks study with the combination GLE/PIB (-19% in M). 
cardiomyopathy in mouse treated for 14 days with PIB at the high dose (1M); 
cardiomyopathy in a mouse treated for 26weeks with PIB at the high dose (1M). It could be noted 
that this mouse died with unknown cause and likely associated with oral gavage and/or animal 
handling procedures according the applicant). Moreover, another mouse in this study was 
euthanized due to dosing injury with foreign material, bacterial colonies, 
adhesion/inflammation/fibrosis in heart. 
fibrosis in heart in rat treated for 13 weeks with PIB at the high dose (2M) 
ectopic tissue in dog treated for 13 weeks with PIB at the high dose (1M) 
hyperplasia in dog treated for 39 weeks with PIB at the low dose (1F) 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 23/126 
 
 
 
 
 
Due to the low incidence of each of these effects, not always dose responsive, no significant signal is 
raised and clinical data will be scrutinized. 
Oral administration of a combination of GLE/PIB at 12.5/20 mg/kg/day for 1 month was well tolerated in 
rats and did not result in any signs of toxicity, especially major concerns about hematologic risk. 
Genotoxicity 
Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir genotoxicity was negative in in vitro (gene mutations in bacteria and 
mammalian chromosome aberration assays) and in vivo (micronucleus assay) GLP genotoxicity studies. 
CHMP concluded that both glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are non-genotoxic. 
Carcinogenicity 
Because the duration of treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is less than 6 months, and because 
genotoxicity studies and repeat-dose toxicity did not reveal any concern, no carcinogenicity study has 
been performed.  
As per the Maviret SmPC, the maximal treatment duration is 16 weeks.  Maviret is not recommended for 
the re-treatment of patients with prior exposure to NS3/4A- and/or NS5A-inhibitors. 
Reproduction and developmental toxicity 
In rats, GLE did not affect fertility or early embryonal development at up to 120 mg/kg/day (137x or 63x 
the 300mg human clinical exposure based on AUC in HCV-infected subjects without cirrhosis or 
HCV-infected subjects with cirrhosis respectively).  
In mice, PIB did not affect fertility or early embryonal development at up to 100 mg/kg/day (100x the 120 
mg human clinical exposure based on AUC in HCV-infected subjects without and with cirrhosis) but an 
increase of Pre (2.1-2.6% versus 0.4% in control) and post (5.9-8% versus 2% in control) implantation 
loss in all treated animals. However these implantation losses are within the range of historical data. 
GLE was shown to be devoid of embryo-foetotoxic or teratogenic potential in rats at up to 120 mg/kg/d 
[safety margin of 116x or 53x the 300mg human clinical exposure based on AUC in HCV-infected subjects 
without cirrhosis or HCV-infected subjects with cirrhosis respectively]. However, in rabbit maternal 
toxicity [clinical findings (abnormal faecal findings, decreased and discoloured urine, anogenital hair 
discoloured brown, and thin body appearance), lower body weights] and embryofoetotoxicity [early 
delivery, 1 animal with all resorbed foetuses and an increase of post-implantation loss (early, late, and 
combined), Mean foetal body weights decreases (13% to 21% less)] have been observed at an estimated 
mean AUC (the only toxicokinetic sample collection conducted was on GD 7 due to excessive toxicity) 
lower than the 300 mg human clinical exposure. In the main study in rabbit, only 2 doses (20 and 60 
mg/kg) have been studied due to toxicity observed in the previous study. The applicant concluded that 
GLE was not teratogenic at the dose levels evaluated due to the fact that visceral/skeletal malformations 
/ variations observed in the treated groups were observed at a low incidence, not dose responsive, similar 
incidence in control or/and were within recent historical control data for this laboratory. 
However, this conclusion was considered questionable by CHMP due to the fact that the exposure at the 
high dose tested is lower than the 300mg human clinical exposure. 
Moreover, some variations have been observed only at the high dose: Caudal vertebra - Centra 
hemicentric in 2 foetuses (1.3% foetuses; 12.5% litters) and no such variation has been observed in 
historical data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 24/126 
 
 
 
 
 
It could also be noted that despite the variations/malformations are within historical data, sternum 
misaligned, ribs fused, skull nasal bone (Additional ossification), thoracic vertebra (centra fused), 
gallbladder smaller than normal, kidney (increased renal pelvic cavitation), kidney (malpositioned, 
malrotated), aortic arch dilatated in thoracic cavity are observed in several foetuses only at high doses 
(and none in control). 
Despite the fact that variation/malformation concerned only 1 animal/group, some 
variation/malformation have been observed only at treated animals and at a higher proportion of that 
seen on historical data (caudal vertebra- vertebra(e), hemivertebra(e); cervical neural arch(es), 
additional ossification centre; thoracic vertebra(e)- neural arch(es) misshapen; skull- frontal bone, 
Additional ossification centre). Therefore the embryofoetal toxicity risk cannot be fully characterized, but 
the Maviret SmPC takes into account the low exposure of GLE in rabbit as explained by the CHMP scientific 
advice in 2015, and the embryofoetotoxicity observed on DRF and main studies (post-implantation loss 
and variation / malformation).  
PIB was shown to be devoid of embryo-foetotoxic or teratogenic potential in mouse at dose up to 100 
mg/kg [safety margin of 50x the 120 mg human clinical exposure based on AUC in HCV-infected subjects 
with and without cirrhosis]. 
In the main study in rabbit, the applicant concluded that PIB was not teratogenic at the dose levels 
evaluated due to the fact that Visceral/skeletal malformations / variations observed in the treated groups 
were observed at a low incidence, not dose responsive, similar incidence in control or/and were within 
recent historical control data for this laboratory. 
For PIB, exposures in embryofoetal development studies were sufficient to characterize the embryofoetal 
risk.  
No major effect has been observed in rats treated with GLE in the prenatal and postnatal development 
studies in rats. Concerning PIB, it could be noted that viability index was decreased at the mid dose (10 
mg/kg) for litter of F0, and the percentage of post-implantation loss was increased at high dose for litter 
of F1. However, it is noted that the increase of pre- (2.1-2.6% versus 0.4% in control) and post- (5.9-8% 
versus 2% in control) implantation loss observed in all treated animals in fertility study in mice were 
within the range of historical data. Therefore it could be concluded by CHMP that no major effect has been 
observed in mice treated with PIB. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic assessment of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir was included in all toxicology studies conducted 
in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits. Toxicokinetic parameters (AUC, Cmax and Tmax) were determined in 
pivotal GLP-compliant repeated dose toxicity studies using validated analytical methods. Adequate 
plasma exposure for glecaprevir and pibrentasvir was reached in all species used for evaluation of general 
toxicity. 
Local Tolerance  
No separate local tolerance studies were conducted with GLE/PIB. Since the intended therapeutic route is 
oral, local tolerance can be evaluated within the frame of general toxicity studies. In repeat dose toxicity 
studies with GLE, erosions/ulcerations and inflammation in the stomach occurred in rats, most likely 
reflecting high local concentrations of the test compound with associated local irritative effects. No risk 
has been identified for PIB. 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 25/126 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunotoxicity 
Based on the lack of GLE or PIB-related changes in haematology, immune organ weights or 
histopathology, serum globulins or increased incidence of infections, the weight of evidence from 
repeated dose toxicology studies of up to 26 weeks' duration in mice / rats or 39 weeks' duration in dogs 
do not indicate an effect of GLE and PIB on the immune system. 
Impurities 
The initial assessment risk concerning acetamide, a product of hydrolysis of acetonitrile used in chemical 
syntheses of GLE and PIB and considered as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) by IARC was not 
acknowledged. In the response to the CHMP concern, the applicant committed to control acetamide 
levels. CHMP agreed with the Applicant’s proposal, but requested a confirmation of compliance with this 
limit through a post-authorisation measure. 
Other toxicity studies 
Glecaprevir absorbed light in the range of 290 to 350 nm and exhibits photo instability to UV-visible light 
in aqueous solutions at neutral pH. Despite the fact that GLE is not very well distributed to the skin and 
eye (tissue/plasma ratios for skin and eye <1), phototoxicity test have been performed. Glecaprevir was 
positive in the in vitro 3T3 test, but was considered by the applicant as negative in an in vivo assay in 
pigmented rats. However, it could be noted that focal retinopathy and corneal dystrophy in one or both 
eyes have been observed in all groups but the comparator article (8-MOP). Moreover corneal dystrophy 
appears in animals regardless of UVR exposure. The applicant explained these effects as a known 
occurrence, related to the UVR exposure process for retinopathy, and not an adverse response to GLE 
administration and UVR exposure due to the low distribution in eye, the absorb light below 400 nm and 
the diffuse corneal oedema in rats treated with positive control that could prevent detection of regions of 
corneal dystrophy / retinopathy. 
PIB absorbed light in the range of 254 to 289 nm, was negative in the in vitro 3T3 test, and therefore has 
not a potential for phototoxicity. 
CHMP agreed that no juvenile animal data were needed, as the product will be indicated in adults only.

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation to be addressed and the following final 
data to be submitted:

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Pharmacological characterisation of glecaprevir, an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, and pibrentasvir, an NS5A 
inhibitor, has shown potent activity in the low nanomolar or picomolar range, respectively against all 
major HCV genotypes (GT1-6). No secondary pharmacological targets were identified in the in vitro 
screening for off-target activity and there were no safety issues identified in the non-clinical safety 
pharmacology studies. Consequently, no additional non-clinical investigations are considered necessary 
by CHMP. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The non-clinical pharmacokinetic profiles of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are in general considered to have 
been adequately characterized. Rats and dogs were chosen by the Applicant as target species for the 
toxicology studies of glecaprevir whereas mice and dogs were chosen as target species for the toxicology 
studies of pibrentasvir due to similar elimination and metabolic profiles as in humans. There are 
essentially no metabolites present in human plasma after treatment with glecaprevir or pibrentasvir 
(none of the metabolites were over 10% of total drug related material and were classified as minor 
metabolites in accordance with relevant guidelines), i.e. there is no need for qualification of metabolites 
in non-clinical toxicity studies. No rabbit specific metabolites of glecaprevir or pibrentasvir were detected 
in rabbit liver microsomes justifying the use of rabbit for the embryo-foetal developmental. 
Toxicology  
The toxicology documentation for glecaprevir and pibrentasvir was considered comprehensive by CHMP, 
and studies in general have been conducted in accordance with relevant guidelines and GLP. It was noted 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 30/126 
 
 
 
 
 
that the Applicant had sought scientific advice for the non-clinical program, and followed the 
recommendations received. In the repeat-dose toxicity studies with each compound, no target organs of 
toxicity were identified. The combination study did not reveal any new or additive toxicity at AUC 
exposures corresponding approximately to the intended clinical exposure. For glecaprevir, maximum 
achieved plasma exposures in the longest duration studies were 735 and 1440 µg∙hr/mL for the rat and 
dog, respectively. These AUC exposures correspond to 153/70-fold and 300/137-fold the clinical AUC 
exposure in non-cirrhotic/cirrhotic patients, respectively. For pibrentasvir, maximum  achieved plasma 
exposures in the longest duration studies were 123 and 25  µg∙hr/mL for the CD-1 mouse and dog, 
respectively. These AUC exposures correspond to 85-fold and 17-fold the clinical AUC exposure in 
patients, respectively.  
Reproductive toxicity 
In the reproductive and developmental toxicology program, there were no test item-related findings in 
any of the fertility studies with glecaprevir and pibrentasvir at 137/63-fold the clinical AUC exposure in 
non-cirrhotic/cirrhotic patients for glecaprevir and 100-fold the clinical AUC exposure for pibrentasvir.  
In animals reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when the components 
of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir were administered separately during organogenesis at exposures up to 53 
times (rats; glecaprevir) or 50 times (mice; pibrentasvir) higher than the human exposures at the 
recommended dose of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir. In rabbit, due to maternal toxicity, even though adequate 
doses were tested, maximal exposure could not be achieved to fully characterize the reproductive toxicity 
of pibrentasvir and of glecaprevir at clinical exposures (0.07 times for glecaprevir and 1.5 times for 
pibrentasvir). Moreover, embryo-foetal loss has been observed in the rabbit with glecaprevir, which 
precluded evaluation of glecaprevir at clinical exposures in this species. For PIB, exposures in 
embryofoetal development studies were sufficient to characterize the embryofoetal risk. Overall, while 
the systemic exposure in the GLE rabbit EFD studies was low, it is acknowledged that studies in rabbits 
and rats with GLE do not indicate direct significant harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. 
Finally there was no significant harmful effect with either compound in rodent peri-/postnatal 
developmental studies in which maternal systemic exposures (AUC) to glecaprevir and pibrentasvir were 
approximately 47 and 74 times higher, respectively, than the exposure in humans at the recommended 
dose. Overall, given that there was some degree of uncertainty on the rabbit data for GLE, as a 
precautionary measure CHMP agreed that Maviret is not recommended to be used in pregnancy. This 
information is considered adequately reflected in the Maviret SmPC. 
Genotoxicity/carcinogenicity 
Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir genotoxicity was negative in in vitro (Gene mutations in bacteria and 
mammalian chromosome aberration assays) and in vivo (micronucleus assay) GLP genotoxicity studies. 
The applicant argued that taking into account the fact that the duration of treatment with 
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is less than 6 months, and that genotoxicity studies and repeat-dose toxicity did 
not reveal any concern, no carcinogenicity study was required and therefore no carcinogenicity was 
performed. CHMP acknowledged that the maximal duration will be 16 weeks, Maviret is not recommended 
for the re-treatment of patients with prior exposure to NS3/4A- and/or NS5A-inhibitors. This has been 
reflected in the Maviret SmPC. 
Ecotoxicology 
Some data on the ERA were provided by the applicant, however, due to several missing studies (which 
have been requested to be submitted post-approval), a full environmental risk assessment of glecaprevir 
and pibrentasvir is not possible at the present time.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical dossier is considered comprehensive and studies in general have been conducted in 
accordance with relevant guidelines and GLP. The Applicant has sought scientific advice for the 
non-clinical program, and followed the recommendations received.  
The non-clinical part of the dossier is considered to be sufficient. No major deficiencies have been 
identified. CHMP nevertheless agreed that the outstanding issues regarding the environmental risk 
assessment need to be addressed post-approval by the applicant for both compounds.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
2.4.2.1.  PK properties 
Chemical considerations 
Several formulations of GLE and PIB (as separated or combined tablets) were used during the clinical 
development of GLE/PIB: the FIH formulation, Phase 2a and Phase 2b separated tablets of GLE and PIB, 
and the combined Phase 3 tablet of GLE/PIB 100/40 mg (used in the all Phase 3 studies). 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 33/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, additional GLE and PIB formulations were evaluated in bioavailability and ADME studies, but 
were not developed further.  
Given the low permeability and solubility in aqueous media of GLE and PIB (both BCS Class 4), no 
parenteral formulations were developed. 
GLE and PIB exhibit several asymmetric carbons are both enantiomers and a unique enantiomer was 
selected (for each active entity) for clinical development. 
Absorption  
Several formulations of GLE and PIB (as separated or combined tablets) were used during the clinical 
development of GLE/PIB. As regards to the absorption properties of the fixed dose combination GLE/PIB 
(corresponding to the tablet used in all the Phase 3 studies and submitted within this MAA procedure), it 
could be noted that this tablet should be administered with food to maximize GLE and PIB exposures and 
reach plasmatic concentrations equivalent to those measured with separated tablets of GLE and PIB used 
in phase 2 studies under fasting condition. Overall, food increased exposures of both GLE and PIB. 
Following moderate and high-fat breakfast, GLE exposures increased to 1.8- to 3.2-fold, and PIB 
exposures were increased to 1.4- to 2.1-fold of those under fasting conditions. Fat or calorie content had 
limited impact on exposures of GLE and PIB. 
After single oral doses of GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg co-formulated Phase 3 tablets in the non-fasting state, 
GLE and PIB Tmax in plasma was around 5.0 hours.  
GLE is a substrate and inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, greater than dose-proportional 
increases in GLE exposure may relate to GLE mediated inhibition of these transporters. PIB is a substrate 
for efflux transporters P-gp and/or BCRP. When GLE 300 mg QD and PIB 120 mg QD are coadministered, 
the GLE exposure remains similar (17% difference). However, the coadministration of PIB with GLE 
saturates intestinal P-gp and BCRP transporters and increases the bioavailability of PIB, leading to an 
increasing PIB exposure approximately three times that of PIB alone. 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 34/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
GLE and PIB are mainly bound to human plasma proteins (respectively 97.5% and >99.9%) regardless of 
their concentrations (ranging from 0.1 to 30 µM). The unbound fraction of GLE and PIB in human plasma 
was similar between HCV-negative subjects with different degrees of renal and hepatic impairment and 
healthy subjects, except for subjects with severe hepatic impairment where the unbound glecaprevir 
fraction was significantly increased relative to healthy subjects. 
GLE and PIB were not preferentially distributed into red blood cells with a mean human blood-to-plasma 
ratio of 0.57 and 0.62, respectively. 
Elimination 
Metabolism 
In vitro, GLE exhibited limited metabolism, predominantly by CYP3A4/5 and to a much less extent by 
CYP2D6, 2C9, and 2C8. PIB is not significantly metabolized in vitro. In healthy male subjects, unchanged 
GLE and PIB were the only radiochemical component of drug related materials in plasma following 
administration of [14C]GLE and [14C]PIB. Overall, GLE and PIB are not significantly metabolized and 
exposure to metabolites is marginal, with no major metabolite (>10% of total drug) identified.  
Excretion 
The majority (>90%) of the plasmatic unchanged GLE and PIB is excreted in faeces. The renal clearance 
of GLE and PIB is negligible, with no PIB and <1% of GLE detected in urine.  
The t1/2 of GLE 300 mg coadministered with PIB 120 mg following multiple QD doses was 6 to 9 hours.  
The t1/2 of PIB 120 mg coadministered with GLE 300 mg following multiple QD doses was 23 to 29 hours. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Linearity 
Following single and multiple doses in healthy subjects, GLE and PIB exposure exhibited greater than 
dose-proportional increase: 
Table 8 GLE multiple dose pharmacokinetics (study M13-356)

EMA/449689/2017  
Page 35/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 9 PIB multiple dose pharmacokinetics (study M13-355) 
Time dependency 
When coadministered, both GLE and PIB reached steady-state within 5-6 days. With the GLE 400 mg QD 
+ PIB 120 mg QD combination, after seventh day of dosing relative to the first, GLE Cmax and AUC24 
were similar (≤ 23% difference) and C24 was higher (↑ 49%), and PIB exposures were higher (↑ 27% 
AUC24, ↑ 113% C24). 
Variability 
GLE has high variability in Cmax and AUC (ranged from 54% – 98% and 49% – 77%, respectively). PIB 
has moderate to high variability in Cmax and AUC (ranged from 25% – 60% and 26% – 64%, 
respectively). Presence of food has minimal impact on the variability of GLE and PIB exposure. 
Intra-individual variability was not discussed by the Applicant. 
2.4.2.2.  Population PK analysis 
GLE and PIB PK profiles were mainly characterized in healthy subjects with the separated tablet 
formulations. In HCV patients, PK data were collected by sparse sampling from four phase 2 and six phase 
3 studies and analysed using a population PK (PPK) approach. In total, 21866 plasma concentrations for 
GLE (from 2710 subjects) and 22013 plasma concentrations for PIB (from 2704 subjects) were included 
in the PopPK analysis. The majority of the subjects (89%) included in the pharmacokinetic analysis 
received GLE 300 mg and PIB 120 mg dose.  
With regard to the population PK analysis, GLE and PIB plasma concentration-time data were described by 
a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination and inter-individual variability in 
key pharmacokinetic parameters CL/F (GLE and PIB) and V2/F (PIB only). The base models accounted for 
dose and presence of cirrhosis on GLE, and the effect of coadministration with GLE on PIB. Final models 
that included intrinsic and extrinsic covariates are as follows:

The estimated exposures in HCV-infected subjects with or without cirrhosis are as follows: 
Table 12 GLE 300 mg QD and PIB 120 mg QD multiple dose exposures in healthy and 
HCV-infected subjects without cirrhosis 
Finally, the fact GLE and PIB are mutually interacting and that their PK is not linear raises some issues on 
the level of confidence derived from the PKPOP analyses.

2.4.2.3.  Intrinsic factors 
Body weight 
The effect of weight on GLE and PIB exposure in HCV-infected subjects was evaluated using the 
population PK analysis. In the final model, weight was identified as significant covariate for PIB PK 
parameters: Increased weight was associated with increased PIB distribution volume (↑ 7% per 10 kg), 
resulting in lower exposure (approximately 3% decreased exposure per 10 kg). This was not considered 
clinically significant by CHMP. Weight was not a significant covariate for GLE PK parameters. 
Sex 
Effect of sex on GLE and PIB exposure in HCV-infected subjects was evaluated using PPK analysis. In the 
final model, sex was identified as significant covariate for GLE and PIB PK parameters: females had lower 
apparent clearance of GLE (↓ 19%) and PIB (↓ 22%) compared to males, resulting in higher exposure of 
GLE (↑ 39%) and PIB (↑ 37%) in females. However, this was not considered clinically significant by CHMP. 
Age 
Effect of age on GLE and PIB exposure in HCV-infected subjects was evaluated using PPK analysis. In the 
final model, age was identified as significant covariate for PIB PK parameters: Increased age was 
associated with a lower apparent clearance of GLE (↓ 5% per 10 years) and PIB (↓ 2% per 10 years), 
resulting in higher exposure of GLE (↑ 32% per 10 years) and PIB (↑ 13% per 10 years). However, this 
was not considered clinically significant by CHMP. 
Race 
Two studies (M15-432 and M14-066) were performed to assess the PK and safety of GLE and PIB between 
Asian and Caucasian subjects. 
- Study M15-432 included 135 male and female adults (45 Han Chinese, 45 Japanese and 45 Caucasian) 
randomly assigned in equal ratios to 5 cohorts: 
The results with the combination of GLE 300 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD are as follows:

Caucasian) randomly assigned in equal ratios to 2 cohorts: 
The results are as follows: 
Figure 4 - Relative bioavailability of GLE and PIB in Han Chinese or Japanese versus 
Caucasian subjects (study M14-066) 
Overall, there is a trend for lower GLE and PIB exposures in Chinese subjects as compared to Caucasian 
in the studies, but these differences are minor and not clinically significant. 
Renal impairment 
Study M13-600 is a Phase 1 open-label study assessing the PK and safety of a single dose of GLE 300 mg 
+ PIB 120 mg under non-fasting conditions in subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment 
and in subjects with end-stage renal disease with or without dialysis. 46 adult male and female subjects 
were enrolled:

The results are as follows:

Figure 6 - Effect of haemodialysis on GLE and PIB in dialysis-dependent ESRD subjects (study 
M13-600) 
The percentage of unchanged GLE or PIB excreted in urine was minimal across groups (≤ 0.28%) and was 
not clinically relevant. Protein binding for GLE and PIB was not significantly different in mild, moderate, 
severe, or ESRD (not on dialysis) groups compared to the normal group. 
Overall, renal impairment, with or without dialysis, was not determined to have a clinically significant 
effect on GLE or PIB exposures in non-HCV infected subjects or in patients with HCV. No dose adjustment 
is recommended when GLE/PIB is administered in subjects with renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Study M13-604 is a Phase 1 open-label study assessing the PK and safety of a single dose of GLE + PIB 
under non-fasting conditions in non-HCV subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment 
compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. 27 adult male and female subjects were enrolled. In 
each groups, subjects received 2 or 3 different dosing regimen of PIB +/- GLE (with at least a 14-day 
washout between each dosing regimen).  
The results with GLE 300 mg + PIB 120 mg are as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 42/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 7 - Relative bioavailability of GLE and PIB in subjects with hepatic impairment versus 
subjects with normal hepatic function (study M13-604) 
The fraction unbound of GLE in plasma from subjects with mild or moderate impairment and of PIB in all 
hepatic impairment groups was not significantly different from normal subjects, but was significantly 
higher for GLE in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (p < 0.05).  
The percentage of GLE bound to plasma proteins in subjects with mild or moderate impairment (97% to 
98%) was not significantly different than in normal subjects, but was significantly lower for GLE in 
subjects with severe hepatic impairment (95%). The percentage of PIB bound to plasma proteins in all 
impairment groups (≥ 99.99%) was not significantly different than in normal subjects. 
Overall, the use of GLE/PIB is not recommended in HCV subjects with CP-B hepatic impairment given the 
2-fold increase of GLE exposure observed in this study and the greater than predicted effect of CP-A 
hepatic impairment in HCV-infected subjects relative to non-HCV infected subjects. In subjects with CP-C, 
GLE/PIB is contraindicated given the large increases in GLE exposure (increase to 11-fold). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
- 
In vitro 
Based on in vitro data on the GLE/PIB metabolism, the effect of any CYP inhibitors or inducers on PIB 
pharmacokinetics is not expected to be significant and clinically relevant. 
GLE inhibits CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. PIB has not shown any CYP inhibition at concentration up to 
30µM. GLE and PIB does not exhibit any CYP2B6 inhibition. Besides, it is agreed that neither GLE nor PIB 
are time-dependent inhibitors of the studied CYP450. 
Based on data from in vitro studies, it cannot be excluded that GLE and PIB induce CYP3A4 at the 
intestinal level. 
GLE and PIB inhibited in vitro UGT1A1 and UGT1A4 but did not show inhibition of UGT1A6, UGT1A9 or 
UGT2B7 (IC50 >50 µM) in human liver microsomes.

However knowing that UGT2B7 is also located at intestinal level, it is unknown whether GLE may inhibit 
this enzyme considering its worst estimated concentration at this level i.e. 143.2 µM. Based on the data 
provided, the recalculation of the AUC ratio using ka=0,1 min-1, as the worst-case estimate ( EU Guideline 
on the investigation of Drug Interaction, January 2013) predicts a R value= 1,63  (values <1,25 are not 
expected to have DDI).  
GLE and PIB are both substrates of the efflux transporters P-gp, and/or BCRP. GLE is a substrate of the 
uptake transporter OATP1B1 and 1B3 but not PIB. Neither GLE nor PIB is an OCT-1 substrate. 
The liability for GLE and PIB to be substrate of BSEP (bile salt export pump) has not been investigated.

However CHMP agreed that this is not a concern because BSEP has a narrow substrate specificity mainly 
transporting conjugated bile salts and structurally similar compounds (2013 ITC Whitepaper). Hence 
BSEP is unlikely to have a role in the disposition of NMEs. 
Furthermore, the impact of any polymorphism of P-gp BCRP, and OATP1B1/3 has been clarified as part of 
the D106 assessment and no effect on the efficacy/safety of GLE/PIB is expected. 
GLE and PIB are P-gp and BCRP, BSEP and OATP1B1 inhibitors. GLE also inhibits OATP1B3. Inhibition of 
OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1 and MATE2K by GLE and PIB has not been identified up to 30µM. 
The results of the investigations of stability and adsorptions issues in the in vitro transporter inhibition 
studies were not found.  Data supporting the presence of actual concentration for GLE and PIB during the 
incubation have been submitted.  
The transporter studies with OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1 and MATE2 were performed in HEK cells where 
target concentrations were confirmed investigating the effect on OCT-1. Regarding PIB, stating solubility 
in incubation buffer is not considered adequate and the applicant should provide data on 
stability/adsorption of PIB in the assays on OCT1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1 or MATE2K 
inhibition for the data to be is considered reliable. CHMP recommended that these data are submitted as 
a post-authorisation measure by end of March 2018. 
In vivo 
Twenty-two clinical interaction studies were conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the magnitude of 
the potential interactions with GLE/PIB. Because the FDC was not available before phase III studies, most 
of DDI studies used individual tablets of GLE and PIB. 
As part of the D106 Q/R assessment, clarifications was made on which situations and exposure increases 
and decreases in GLE and PIB exposures that should lead to a contraindication and which should lead to 
a "not recommended" statement (notably as regards carbamazepine or other strong/moderate 
P-gp/CYP3A inducers. 
Drugs that increase exposures of GLE/PIB: No upper exposure level of GLE that would result in a 
contraindication has been defined.  However, due to limited data in this high exposure range, drug 
interactions resulting in exposures greater than 6-fold of the HCV non-cirrhotic population are "not 
recommended."  And, a further 3-fold increase due to drug interactions in subjects with cirrhosis will 
result in GLE exposures 6-fold of non-cirrhotic subjects.  Thus the maximum increase in GLE exposure 
allowed due to drug interactions for all subjects was established at 3-fold. For PIB no safety problems 
have been observed making GLE the limiting factors. This is agreed on.  
Drugs that decrease exposures of GLE/PIB: An exposure-response (SVR12) evaluation of PIB was further 
discussed in Q105. No ER relationship was found for GLE. The results for PIB show that even patients with 
low PIB concentrations experience response rates over 95%. Further, the Applicant states that a 
reduction of PIB exposure by 70% is expected to decrease the SVR12 response rate in TN GT3 patients 
below 90% which is considered clinically meaningful.  
Consequently the combination of GLE/PIB with strong inducers should be contra-indicated and with 
moderate inducers not recommended. 
GLE and PIB combination 
The effect of GLE on PIB and reciprocally has been assessed as part of the study M13-586, Arm 1. Results 
show that that GLE (400 mg/day) significantly raises PIB exposure about 3.5-fold probably due to P-gp 
and BCRP inhibition. Additionally, based on results obtained as part of the study (cohort 2 and 3), GLE 
(300 mg, multiple doses) is expected to increase about 3-fold PIB exposure whereas no clinically relevant 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017

effect is observed of PIB (120 mg multiple doses) on GLE exposure (AUC ratio= 1,7 with a 90%CI 
[1,053-1,309]). 
PIB increases GLE exposure, but this is not expected to be clinically relevant. 
Effect of GLE/PIB on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs 
Effect of GLE and PIB on CYP450 enzymes 
GLE/PIB significantly affects the exposure of the probe CYP1A2, CYP3A4 CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 substrates 
caffeine, midazolam, omeprazole and dextromethorphan (DMX), but in a different way. Indeed, the  GLE 
and PIB combination increases caffeine and midazolam AUC, about 37% and 27%, respectively, whereas 
it decreases dextromethorphan and omeprazole exposure about 25% and 21%. These effects are driven 
by GLE and not fully clear as regards CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 since in vitro GLE is not expected to 
inhibit these enzymes at therapeutic concentrations.  
However, except for omeprazole at a dose higher than 20 mg, although uncertainties remain on the 
mechanism behind the observed changes, this is not expected to be clinically relevant. As regards 
omeprazole at dose higher than 20 mg, the risk of reduced efficacy if allowing concomitant 40 mg qd 
treatment is considered unnecessary. Therefore the co-administration of Maviret with omeprazole 40 mg 
qd is not recommended. 
Felodipine and amlodipine are sensitive CYP3A substrates. GLE increases felodipine and amlodipine AUC 
about 31% and 21%, respectively. These results are consistent with the weak CYP3A4 inhibition observed 
with midazolam the exposure of which increasing lesser than 2 -fold. Even though these changes are 
statistically significant, they are not expected to be clinically relevant.  The effects of felodipine and 
amlodipine on GLE and PIB PK have also been studied and no pharmacokinetic interaction has been 
identified. No dose adjustment is recommended when GLE/PIB is combined with felodipine or amlodipine. 
Effect of GLE and PIB on UGT1A1 and UGT1A4 
Raltegravir is metabolised by UGT1A1. Results from the study M13-593 show a significant increase of 
raltegravir Cmax and AUC, about 1.34- and 1.47-fold respectively. RAL Cmin increases about 2-fold with a 
90%CI [1.42-4.9], this variation may be attributed to RAL variability and food intake. The large 
therapeutic margin and the safety profile of RAL allow this effect to not be considered clinically relevant. 
Therefore, RAL can be combined with GLE/PIB without dose adjustment.  
Levothyroxine has been identified as an UGT1A1 substrate (Williams J.A and al. Drug metabolism and 
disposition, 2004). However, currently data on DDI with levothyroxine bring on a risk of loss of efficacy 
rather than on an increased risk of toxicity. Therefore if the interaction is not ruled out between GLE/PIB 
and levothyroxine, due to UGT1A1 inhibition by the FDC, its clinical relevance is questionable. Therefore, 
this combination should be in the list of risk that should be monitored and add in the RMP. 
No significant change has been observed on lamotrigine, an UGT1A4 substrate, when it is combined with 
GLE and PIB. No clinically relevant changes are observed on GLE and PIB exposures. 
P-gp inhibition 
GLE and PIB increase the exposure of digoxin about 48% and its Cmax about 72%. No significant effect on 
the PK of both GLE and PIB is observed. The Applicant therefore recommends the decrease of the dose of 
digoxin to about half. This is not supported by CHMP. As a matter of fact, this effect could be more 
pronounced in the clinical setting notably, in women patients in whom the therapeutic margin of digoxin 
is narrower than in men, and in patients with an altered renal function. This study does not sufficiently 
reflect the clinical conditions to decide of any dose recommendations. Then, only the measure of 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 46/126 
 
 
 
 
 
digoxinemia allows an adequate dose adjustment to be made. This has been reflected in the Maviret 
SmPC. 
Likewise, with GLE and PIB, dabigatran AUC and Cmax increase about 2.4-fold and 2-fold, respectively. 
The magnitude of this interaction is similar to the one observed with dronedarone, a P-gp inhibitor, with 
which the combination of dabigatran is strictly contra-indicated. Therefore the proposed SmPC warning to 
not recommend dabigatran with the FDC is not supported. Dabigatran with GLE/PIB must be 
contra-indicated. This is reflected in the Maviret SmPC. 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 inhibition 
- Losartan and valsartan 
Losartan is a P-gp and an OATP2B1 substrate and not an OATP1B1 and 1B3 substrate. GLE and PIB, 
significantly increase losartan and its active metabolite Cmax, by 2.5-fold and 2.2-fold. This is driven by 
P-gp inhibition. Besides, their AUC modestly increase about 1.14-fold and 1.56-fold. This is not expected 
to be clinically meaningful.  
Valsartan is an OATP1B1- and OATP1B3 substrate. With GLE and PIB, valsartan exposure increases 
about 1.3-fold translating the moderate impact of GLE and PIB on valsartan disposition. According to 
these results, and considering the safety margin of valsartan, no dose adjustment is needed with 
GLE/PIB. 
- HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors (statins) 
Pravastatin is not metabolised but is taken up by OAT1B1 and 1B3 into the hepatocytes.  With GLE/PIB, 
its AUC increases about 2.3-fold due to inhibition of these uptake transporters by GLE. The Applicant 
recommends to decrease about 50% the dose of pravastatin. This proposal is not supported. Pravastatin 
is a well-tolerated statin and a doubling of its exposure is not expected to be clinically relevant. 
Furthermore, current recommendations in the pravastatin EU SmPC is to initiate the treatment with a low 
dose, 10 mg day, in case of unfavorable factors (DDI, hepatic impairment) and to adjust the dose 
according to the impact on lipids. There is no data that authorized to claim a half dose of pravastatin may 
lead to an optimal efficacy on lipids-lowering. The dose of pravastatin should not exceed 20 mg/day. This 
was reflected in the Maviret SmPC. 
Rosuvastatin is an OATP1B1 and also a BCRP substrate, the exposure of which is expected to increase 
when combined with an inhibitor of these transporters as GLE and PIB. The study M13-579 shows a 
substantial increase in rosuvastatin Cmax about 5.6-fold and a 2-fold increase in its AUC. Therefore a low 
daily-dose of rosuvastatin (5 mg/day) should be used. This was reflected in the Maviret SmPC. 
Atorvastatin is OATP1B1 and 1B3 substrate and also a P-gp, BCRP substrate. The substantial increase its 
Cmax and AUC, about 22-fold and 8-fold, respectively, requires to contra-indicate this statin with GLE/PIB. 
This is reflected in the Maviret SmPC. 
Simvastatin is an OATP1B1 and 1B3 substrate and also a P-gp, BCRP substrate. In the study M14-721, 
GLE and PIB increase the Cmax and AUC of both simvastatin and simvastatin hydroxy acid (its active 
metabolite) by 2-fold and 2.3-fold, and 11-fold and 4.5-fold, respectively. These results are consistent 
with the PK features of simvastatin and the active hydroxy acid metabolite. The Cmax of the latter 
translates the inhibitory effect at the biliary level of GLE and PIB on P-gp and BCRP. CHMP agreed that this 
co-administration should be contraindicated. This is reflected in the Maviret SmPC. 
Lovastatin is an OATP1B1 and 1B3 substrate and also a P-gp substrate. As simvastatin and its hydroxyl 
acid metabolite, AUC and Cmax of the parent compound and acid lovastatin (active metabolite) 
significantly increase with GLE/PIB about 1.7-fold and 1.1 fold, and 4.1-fold and 5.7-fold, respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 47/126 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, their co-administration is not recommended. However, some guidance will be specified in case 
this co-administration is unavoidable. 
Pitavastatin and fluvastatin share the same feature towards OATP1B1 and 1B3 as pravastatin but this has 
not been studied. This is reflected in the Maviret SmPC. 
Effect of GLE and PIB on Ethinyl Estradiol (EE)/Norgestimate (NGM), Norethindrone (NET), or 
EE/Levonorgestrel (LNG) Based Oral Contraceptives 
Oral contraceptive agents undergo metabolism by multiple pathways as CYP450 and UGT. EE is also a 
substrate of OATP1B1 and 2B1. With GLE and PIB, plasma exposures of EE, norgestrel, norgestromin and 
levonorgestrel increase about 28% and 40 %, 63%, 44%, and 68% respectively. Usually, these changes 
are not expected to be clinically relevant. Nevertheless the onset of asymptomatic grade 1 (n=3), 2 (n=1) 
and 3 (n=1) ALT elevation in 5 healthy women is compelling and foreshadow that these events, actually, 
may be more pronounced and symptomatic in the target population intended to be treated by GLE/PIB. 
The Applicant proposes to not recommend the combination of this DAA with EE containing regimen. This 
recommendation is not supported. 
As a matter of fact, as part of the DDI study M12-205 (R& D 13-949) with the FDC ombitasvir, 
paritaprevir, ritonavir, the event of transaminase elevation was reported in five subjects and were 
assessed as moderate in severity. Of note 3 of these 5 healthy women discontinued prematurely the 
study. Additionally these events occurred without any significant increase of EE AUC. During clinical trials 
with another FDC containing the DAA, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, transient elevations of ALT to 
greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 1% of subjects, these elevations were 
significantly more frequent in the subgroup of subjects who were using EE as combined oral contraceptive 
or contraceptive vaginal rings. Consequently, it has been decided that the combination of EE with 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir ritonavir is strictly contra-indicated. 
Presently in GLE/PIB case, specific recommendations have been given as part of the pivotal clinical trials 
that any treatment by EE must be stopped 2 weeks before starting the DAA and only restarted 30 days 
after the end of the DAA treatment. Then, one cannot preclude that in the clinical setting the magnitude 
of the ALT elevations will be more pronounced and clinically relevant. Consequently, the combination of 
GLE/PIB and EE should be contra-indicated.  
No significant PK change is observed with norethindrone then no dose adjustment is recommended. 
No clinically significant interactions were observed between GLE and PIB with progestin-only 
contraceptives. 
Opioid Replacement 
The study M13-602 shows that no clinically relevant interaction is expected with buprenorphine or 
methadone. Consequently, no dose adjustment is needed with GLE/PIB. 
Effect of other drugs on GLE/PIB pharmacokinetics 
Transporters/enzyme inducers: carbamazepine and rifampicin 
Rifampicin is a strong enzyme and transporter inducer but also exhibits OATP inhibitory effect that can be 
evidenced only after a single oral dose. In the study M14-723, a single rifampicin dose increased GLE 
exposure (↑ 6.5-fold Cmax, ↑ 8.6-fold AUCinf), but had no effect on PIB exposure (≤ 9% change).  Multiple 
doses of rifampicin slightly increased GLE (↑ 40% Cmax), but PIB exposures were decreased (↓ 79% Cmax, 
↓ 83% AUCinf).  When GLE and PIB were administered 24 hours after the last dose of rifampicin, exposures 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 48/126 
 
 
 
 
 
were decreased for both GLE (↓ 86% Cmax, ↓ 88% AUCinf) and PIB (↓ 83% Cmax, ↓ 87% AUCinf). Therefore, 
GLE/PIB is contra-indicated with rifampicin. 
Repeated doses of carbamazepine significantly decreases GLE and PIB AUC, about 66% and 50%, 
respectively (Study M14-724) using 200 mg BID. Doses up to 400 mg could be used in clinical practice. 
Based on these GLE/PIB should be contraindicated with carbamazepine, as well as all strong inducers. 
For moderate inducers the combination with GLE/PIB should be not recommended. This is reflected in the 
Maviret SmPC. 
Acid-Reducing Agents 
Omeprazole was used as a prototypical proton-pump inhibitor to evaluate the effect of acid-reducing 
agents on the pharmacokinetics of GLE and PIB.  Omeprazole was administered in the morning 
approximately 1 hour before starting breakfast (QD regimen) or in the evening without food (QPM 
regimen).   
GLE exposure was slightly lower (↓ 22% Cmax, ↓ 29% AUCinf) when GLE and PIB were coadministered with 
omeprazole 20 mg QD compared to GLE and PIB alone; PIB exposure was similar (≤ 3% difference). 
GLE exposure was lower (↓ 64% Cmax, ↓ 51% AUCinf) when GLE and PIB were coadministered with 
omeprazole 40 mg QD compared to GLE and PIB alone; PIB exposure was similar (≤ 15% difference). 
GLE exposure was lower (↓ 46% Cmax, ↓ 49% AUCinf) when GLE and PIB were coadministered with 
omeprazole 40 mg QPM compared to GLE and PIB alone; PIB exposure was similar (≤ 7% difference). 
The Applicant suggests no dose adjustment with GLE/PIB. This is not supported by CHMP since results 
with OMP 40 mg are close to those observed with carbamazepine. However, GLE/PIB can be used with 
omeprazole at a dosage that does not exceed 20 mg QD and according to the conclusion drawn as part of 
the D106 Q/R assessment, omeprazole 40 mg QD is not recommended due to the risk of loss of GLE/PIB 
efficacy. This is reflected in the Maviret SmPC. 
Immunosuppressant  
With ciclosporin 100 mg/day, GLE and PIB exposure (AUC) increase about 14%, 37% and 22%. On the 
contrary, with ciclosporin 400 mg, GLE and PIB exposure raises about 5- and 1.9- fold, respectively, 
whereas ciclosporin exposure falls within the 90%CI of [0.8-1,25]. 
These difference can be explain by the balance between the three compounds towards P-gp, BCRP and 
OATP and their affinity/inhibition for these transporters whereas at 400 mg day, ciclosporin inhibitory 
effect counterbalances this state and inhibition of GLE and PIB efflux and uptake (only with GLE) transport 
by ciclosporin prevails over. 
As part of the D106 Q/R assessment, the Applicant finally suggests to not recommend the use of 
ciclosporin doses >100 mg per day with GLE/PIB face to uncertainties as regards the safety profile of the 
combination. However, since ciclosporin + GLE/PIB is not contra-indicated, an additional 
recommendation is added for patients eligible for GLE/PIB and receiving ciclosporin dose >100 mg/day. 
This is reflected in the Maviret SmPC. 
DDI with other drugs for HIV Treatment: 
HIV protease inhibitors (atazanavir, darunavir, lopinavir, ritonavir) 
Darunavir/ritonavir strongly inhibits CYP3A, P-gp, BCRP and OATP this effect is mainly driven by 
ritonavir. When GLE/PIB is combined with this PI, GLE exposures substantially increases about 5-fold, 
3-fold and 8-fold for AUC Cmax and Cmin, respectively. This is related to the inhibition of multiple pathways 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 49/126 
 
 
 
 
 
involved in GLE disposition as the uptake and efflux transport by OATP1B1/B3, P-gp and BCRP at the 
hepatocyte and enterocyte level.  
PIB AUC and Cmin increase but weakly and this is not considered clinically relevant. These results finally 
show the modest impact on PIB exposure of P-gp and BCRP inhibition on its elimination. Moreover the 
estimated boosting effect of GLE on PIB exposure, that is an increase about 3-fold of PIB AUC, is also not 
evidenced.  
DRV/RTV exposures are also increased but this is not considered clinically relevant. The Applicant 
suggests that the combination of GLE/PIB and DRV/RTV is not recommended. Considering the 90%CI of 
GMR for GLE AUC, [3.615-6.842], that does not discard an increase AUC more than 6-fold, 
contra-indicate the combination of DRV/RTV with GLE/PIB is then raised. As a matter of fact, with 
ATV/RTV, GLE AUC mean ratio increases about 6.5-fold, with a 90% CI [5.23-8.1] a total of 10/24 
subjects report ALT elevations. The Applicant links this adverse event to ATV and proposes to 
contra-indicate ATV/RTV combination with GLE. The applicant has proposed a differential approach for 
LPV/RTV and DRV/RTV (not recommended) as compared to ATV/RTV (contra-indicated). Indeed, 
although PK parameters of GLE and PIB were significantly affected in presence of LPV/RTV and DRV/RTV, 
the concern on increased transaminases were mainly derived from the findings with ATV/RTV. After 
discussion through the procedure this approach was endorsed by CHMP, but with a close scrutiny to be 
maintained in post marketing. 
Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (rilpivirine, efavirenz):  
Rilpivirine is mainly metabolised by CYP3A4. With GLE/PIB, its AUC increases about 1.8-fold. The 
magnitude of the interaction is lesser than observed with DRV/RTV with which no dose adjustment is 
currently recommended in rilpivirine SPC. Therefore, no dose adjustment is needed with GLE/PIB. 
Efavirenz (EFV)/Emtricitabine (FTC)/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) 
GLE/PIB does not significantly alter the exposure of efavirenz and emtricitabine. Tenofovir AUC, Cmax 
and Cmin increase about 29%, 22%, and 38% and is probably related to P-gp inhibition by GLE/PIB. These 
changes are similar to those observed with ATV/RTV or DRV/RTV. Therefore, no dose adjustment is 
recommended but the observed increased in tenofovir exposure could potentiate tenofovir associated 
adverse events, including renal disorders.  
As regards the effect of efavirenz on GLE and PIB exposure, the Applicant estimated a 70% decrease in 
GLE/PIB exposure based on the results obtained in other healthy subjects. Efavirenz is a known moderate 
to strong inducer and CHMP agreed that its combination with GLE/PIB should be not recommended.  
Elvitegravir (EVG)/Cobicistat (c)/Emtricitabine (FTC)/Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF; Arm 1) or Abacavir 
(ABC)/Dolutegravir (DTG)/Lamivudine 
Elvitegravir AUC increases about 46%, cobicistat AUC increases about 42% but it can be agreed that no 
dose adjustment is needed. Scrutiny will be exercised in post marketing. Emtricitabine and TAF changes 
are not considered clinically relevant. 
As regards abacavir, dolutegravir, lamivudine, no clinically relevant interaction is expected likewise the 
observed changes in GLE/PIB PK do not need any dose adjustment to be made. This is reflected in the 
Maviret SmPC. 
Drugs for HCV Treatment

GLE and PIB increased exposure of sofosbuvir via inhibition of P-gp and BCRP, but did not affect exposure 
of GS-331007 metabolite. No clinically significant interactions were observed between GLE and PIB with 
sofosbuvir. 
Other DDI 
According to the pharmacokinetic profile of the following drugs, a discussion on the drug-drug interaction 
risk with GLE/PIB has been requested:  
- voriconazole, a CYP3A,2C substrate and inhibitor 
- dronédarone, a P-gp inhibitor 
- colchicine, a P-gp/CYP3A substrate 
- repaglinide, an OATP1B/B3 and CYP3A/2C8 substrate 
- gemfibrozil, an OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitor 
- methotrexate (MTX), paclitaxel, mitoxantrone, irinotecan: BCRP substrates 
As part of the D106 AR, clarifications have been provided by the Applicant. However the lack of data on 
the ability of these drugs to be substrates or inhibitors of transporters notably OATP1B1 and 1B3, made 
the predictability of the net effect quite difficult. As an illustration, MTX is a MRP4 substrate but the effect 
by GLE/PIB on MRP4 is unknown.  
Besides, regarding, gemfibrozil and repaglinide, the Applicant is referring to a PBPK simulation for the 
prediction of GLE/PIB interaction. The applicant has not submitted qualifications supporting the use of 
CYP2C8 and OATP1B1/3 quantitatively. In addition as there is a lack of abundance data for OATP1B, there 
is not enough scientific support to make quantitative simulations. It is therefore not possible to use these 
simulations for dosing recommendations. However, even though a clinically relevant interaction cannot 
be completely ruled out in the absence of dedicated DDI studies, CHMP considered that scrutiny towards 
signals is warranted in the post marketing setting, rather than a statement in the Maviret SmPC.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Glecaprevir is an inhibitor of HCV NS3/4A protease which is necessary for the proteolytic cleavage of the 
HCV encoded polyprotein (into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B proteins) and is 
essential for viral replication.  
Pibrentasvir is an inhibitor of HCV NS5A which is essential for viral replication. In vitro resistance selection 
and data on cross-resistance support NS5A is the target of PIB. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology

In the presence of 40% human plasma there was approximately 10-fold and 40-fold decrease in inhibitory 
potency against GT1a-H77 and GT1b-Con1 replicons for glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, respectively, 
reflecting the high degree of protein binding for both agents. 
Glecaprevir: Replicon resistance selection studies were conducted in GT1a-H77, GT1b-Con1, 
GT2a-JFH-1, GT2b, GT3a, GT4a, and GT6a cell lines at 10-, 100- or 500-fold above the EC50 of GLE for the 
respective cell lines. 
The major amino acid substitutions selected in NS3 by GLE in the GT1, 2 and 4 replicon cell lines were 
A156T and A156V. In GT3a replicon, most of the colonies selected contained A156G or Y56H + Q168R. Of 
note, the one baseline NS3 substitution (A166S) that was associated with a reduced clinical efficacy in 
genotype-3 infection was not selected in vitro, and does to our understanding not confer a reduced 
susceptibility in vitro. In GT6a replicon, GLE selected D168H and D168V. 
Effects on phenotypic susceptibility of these substitutions and other single substitutions typical for the 
class are summarized in the next table. Of note, in GT1a, substitutions at position 80 had no impact on 
activity of GLE. In GT3a, Q80R reduced susceptibility by 21-fold; a substitution seemingly of overall low 
clinical importance (next section).

Pibrentasvir: Selection of resistant substitutions within NS5A were conducted in GT1a, GT1b, GT2a, 
GT2b, GT3a, GT4a, and GT6a cell lines at 10-, 100- or 1000-fold above the EC50 of PIB for the respective 
cell lines. None of the cells survived selection with 100- or 1000-fold over the EC50 value of PIB in any cell 
line with the exception of GT1a-H77 (colony survival at 100-fold EC50 was 0.0002%). There were no 
surviving colonies with selection at 10-fold over the EC50 value of PIB in the GT1b-Con1, GT2b, GT4a, 
GT5a and GT6a replicon cell lines. PIB had a TD50 of > 32,000,000 pM in the MTT cytotoxicity assay 
(yielding a therapeutic index that exceeded 106-fold). 
The major substitution selected in GT1a-H77 was Y93H in NS5A at 10-fold over the EC50 value. This 
substitution (not selected with genotype 1b virus), yielded a fold change of 7. At 100 fold change above 
EC50, substitutions Q30D (fold change 95), Y93D (FC not available), Q30 deletion (FC not available), or 
H58D + Y93H (FC 2000) were detected in 1 colony each. Substitutions selected at 100-fold over the EC50 
value required a 2 – 3 nucleotide change. 
In the GT2a cell line, only three colonies survived selection at 10-fold over the EC50 value of PIB; 
F28S+M31I (FC 15,000) was present in two colonies while P29S+K30G (FC 2.3) was present in one 
colony. In the GT3a cell line, three colonies containing Y93H (FC 1) were selected at fold change 10 over 
EC50. The one baseline NS5A substitution (A30K) that was associated with a reduced clinical efficacy in 
genotype-3 infection was not selected in vitro.   
The impact on in vitro susceptibility by a large number of single, double and triple substitutions, were 
studied in transient replicons for genotypes 1-6. No single substitutions conferred a relevant fold change 
to PIB (all genotypes). Certain (but far from all) double and triple mutants conferred high fold changes to 
genotype 1a and genotype 3a virus. For genotype 2a one double mutant studied yielded high level 
resistance (clinical relevance likely very low). Combinations of substitutions that did confer resistance are 
shown in the next table. The table also highlights the absence of substitutions conferring in vitro

resistance in genotype 1b-virus.  Indeed, for genotype 1b, 2b, 4a, 4d, 5a and 6a none of the double/triple 
mutants studied conferred a relevant FC to PIB.

Subtypes 4a, 4d, 5a and 6a: 
Tested single and double mutants did not confer any FC (FC ranging from 0.8-2, mostly 
being around 1) 
Note: Large numbers of mutants tested without any effects on FC (for example double mutants for 
genotype 1a virus) are not shown in this table. 
The Applicant did a comparison of effects by various NS5A RAVs on PIB and the presently approved 
NS5AS inhibitors (DVC, LDV, VEL, OBV, ELB). In summary, the resistance barrier seems higher for PIB 
than for other approved agents of the class (see following table).

Additive activity was documented for PIB and GLE. Moreover, combination resulted in enhanced 
suppression of resistant colony emergence indicating a higher genetic barrier to resistance when GLE and 
PIB are combined. Combination of each agent with sofosbuvir resulted in additive to synergic activity. Of 
note, combination of each agent with RBV also led to additive to synergistic inhibition of HCV replication. 
CLINICAL VIROLOGY 
Phase IIa Monotherapy Study (M13-595) 
This was a Phase 2a, randomized, open-label, multicenter dose-ranging study that explored the safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of GLE and PIB administered as monotherapy for 3 
days in HCV GT1-infected treatment-naïve adults with and without compensated cirrhosis. GLE was dosed 
100 to 700 mg QD, and PIB dosed 15-240 mg (15, 40, 120 or 240 mg) QD. Following monotherapy 
patients received Viekirax + Exviera + RBV for 12 weeks.  
An immediate and substantial decline in HCV viral load was observed on study day 1 for all doses of 
ABT-493 (100 mg to 700 mg QD), with slightly slower onset with the 100 mg dose. A ~4 log10 decline 
(range: –3.7 to –4.2 log10 IU/mL) in mean HCV viral load was observed in all GLE (ABT-493) dose groups 
after 3 days, irrespective of cirrhosis status.

Figure 8 - Mean change in HCV RNA from baseline to each time point during ABT-493 
monotherapy 
An immediate and substantial decline in HCV viral load was also observed on Study Day 1 for the 40 mg, 
120 mg, and 400 mg doses of ABT-530. A ~4 log10 decline (range: –3.8 to –4.3 log10 IU/mL) in mean 
HCV viral load was observed in these PIB (ABT-530) dose groups after 3 days, irrespective of cirrhosis 
status. The 15 mg dose has been found to result in statistically lower maximal mean HCV RNA decrease 
(–3.38 log10 IU/mL at 3 days, P < 0.01 for each dose comparison).

Among the 30 genotype 1a- and 5 genotype 1b-infected subjects with post-baseline sequence data 
during the ABT-493 monotherapy period, 1 genotype 1a-infected subject (with Q80K pre-existing at 
baseline) had a treatment-emergent A156T variant in NS3. The patient was in the 700 mg dose group. 
Among the 33 genotype 1a- and 7 genotype 1b-infected subjects who received ABT-530 and had baseline 
sequencing data, 3 genotype 1a-infected subjects with pre-existing variants in NS5A at baseline had 
multiple treatment-emergent variants in NS5A during monotherapy. All 3 subjects had preexisting 
variants that as single variants do not confer resistance to ABT-530, but acquired additional variants at 
resistance-associated amino acid positions (30, 31, 32, 58, 92, and/or 93) during monotherapy. 
2.4.3.1.  QT study 
Study M15-543 was performed in 48 healthy volunteers accordingly to the ICH E14 guideline. GLE and 
PIB were co-administered as single doses of 400 mg and 120 mg, respectively, or 600 mg and 240 mg, 
respectively. The active control was moxifloxacin. 
The active control is positive, and the combination GLE + PIB at supra-therapeutic doses is negative. 
While the GLE/PIB could have been further increased, the negative results of this study are reinforced by 
the absence of particular signal based on electrophysiological investigations and animal data. 
2.4.3.2.  PK/PD relationships 
Efficacy 
The exposure-efficacy relationships were evaluated for SVR12 and rapid virologic response (RVR), 
defined as an undetectable serum HCV RNA at Week 4 of treatment. Data were issued from 2635 subjects 
who received the GLE and PIB combination, with or without RBV, across 9 Phase 2 and 3 studies. 
GLE exposure was not significantly associated with SVR12 rates across all evaluated populations at the 
proposed GLE/PIB dose and durations. PIB exposure was a statistically significant predictor of SVR12 (p 
< 0.05) in treatment-naïve and PRS-experienced non-GT3 subjects and treatment-naïve GT3 subjects. A 
50% decrease in PIB AUC resulted in a 0.8% decrease in SVR12 (from 99.7% to 98.9%) for 
treatment-naïve and PRS-experienced non-GT3 subjects, and a 3.3% decrease in SVR12 (from 98.1 to 
94.8%) for treatment-naïve GT3 subjects. Due to the low virologic failure rates, a 50% decrease in PIB 
exposure is not expected to have a clinical meaningful impact on SVR12 rates. 
No apparent correlation was observed between RVR and GLE or PIB AUC from GT1 to GT5. Although a 
slight trend between RVR and GLE quartiles was observed for GT6-infected subjects, the overall RVR rate 
in GT6-infected subjects is comparable or higher than the RVR rates observed in other non GT6-infected 
subjects. The logistic regression analyses did not identify significant relationship between GLE/PIB 
exposure and RVR within the GLE and PIB exposure ranges evaluated in the analyses. 
Similar relationships were observed when Ctrough was used as a measure of exposure. 
Safety 
No positive exposure-response relationship was observed between PIB and GLE exposures and ALT 
elevations. Results were similar when using Cmax instead of AUC. 
The frequency of ≥ Grade 2 post-baseline total bilirubin values increased with increasing GLE and PIB AUC 
values. Based on the logistic regression analyses, higher GLE AUCs are correlated with higher odds of 
post-baseline total bilirubin elevation ≥ Grade 2. PIB AUC values were not significantly associated with ≥ 
Grade 2 total bilirubin elevation. Results were similar when using Cmax instead of AUC:

Figure 10 - Maximum post-baseline total bilirubin elevation in grade versus AUC values 
The incidence and severity of post-baseline total bilirubin elevations appeared to increase with increasing 
GLE and PIB exposures. Increasing GLE exposure to 2-fold is predicted to increase the rate of 
post-baseline total bilirubin elevation ≥ Grade 2 from 2.38% to 3.71%, respectively, which is not 
considered to be clinically meaningful.

AUC 
GLE and PIB exposures in subjects with diarrhoea were comparable to the exposures observed in other 
subjects and their GLE and PIB exposures fell within the exposure ranges of subjects who did not have 
diarrhoea. The frequency of diarrhoea appears to be not associated with GLE or PIB AUC values. Logistic 
regression analyses did not identified association between diarrhoea and GLE or PIB exposures. Results 
were similar when using Cmax. 
2.4.4.  Discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic properties: 
Several formulations of GLE and PIB (as separated or combined tablets) were used during the clinical 
development of GLE/PIB. As regards the absorption properties of the FDC GLE/PIB (corresponding to the 
tablet used in all the Phase 3 studies and submitted within this MAA procedure), it could be noted that this 
tablet should be administered with food to maximize GLE and PIB exposures and reach plasmatic 
concentrations equivalent to those measured with separated tablets of GLE and PIB used in Phase 2 
studies without regard to food. 
According to the results of the mass-balance study M13-890, GLE and PIB are both not significantly 
metabolized. The plasmatic unchanged GLE and PIB are mostly excreted in faeces and their renal 
clearance is negligible, with less than 1% of the products detected in urine. The study performed in renal 
impaired subjects shows that a maximum average increase of ≈50% for GLE and PIB exposure is observed 
in subjects with eGFR < 30 ml/min, with doubled exposures in some patients. Although this increase is not 
clinically relevant and could support the use of GLE/PIB in renal impaired subjects, such increase was not 
expected given renal elimination was not identified as a significant route of elimination. In the same way, 
the systemic exposure of GLE and PIB is significantly increased in moderate and severe hepatic impaired 
subjects, although oxidative metabolism was not identified as a significant route of elimination.  
GLE and PIB PK profiles were mainly characterized in healthy subjects with the separated tablet 
formulations. In HCV patients, PK data were collected by sparse sampling in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 60/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and analysed using a population PK (PPK) approach. As a result, the estimated exposure of PIB in 
HCV-infected subjects is lower than those measured in healthy subjects (AUC24 at 2170 ng.h/ml in 
healthy subjects vs 1430 ng.h/ml in HCV subjects without cirrhosis). Furthermore, GLE and PIB exhibited 
greater than dose-proportional increase of their exposure. This non-linear PK property of GLE and PIB was 
modelled based on the findings of dose-escalation studies conducted in healthy volunteers and introduced 
as a fixed effect in the PPK analysis where only HCV patients’ data were included. 
Interactions 
In vitro 
GLE is mainly cleared through the biliary and fecal route. Only 22,6 % of the administered dose 
represents the parent drug, about 42% was the sulphonamide hydrolysis product M6 yielded by gut 
microflora and 26% gather oxidative metabolites and their sulphonamide hydrolysis products.  
PIB is mainly recovered as unchanged in feces about 98,5% of the total drug based on the results of the 
mass-balance study in healthy volunteers. 
The effect of any CYP inhibitors or inducers on PIB pharmacokinetics is not expected to be significant and 
clinically relevant. 
GLE inhibits CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. PIB has not shown any CYP inhibition at concentration up to 
30µM. GLE and PIB does not exhibit any CYP2B6 inhibition. Besides, it is agreed that neither GLE nor PIB 
are time-dependent inhibitors of the studied CYP450. It cannot be excluded that GLE and PIB, induce 
CYP3A4. 
GLE and PIB inhibited in vitro UGT1A1 and UGT1A4 but did not show inhibition of UGT1A6, UGT1A9 or 
UGT2B7 (IC50 >50 µM) in human liver microsomes. 
GLE and PIB are both substrates of the efflux transporters P-gp and/or BCRP. GLE is a substrate of the 
uptake transporter OATP1B1 and 1B3 but not PIB. Neither GLE nor PIB is an OCT-1 substrate. 
The liability for GLE and PIB to be substrate of BSEP (bile salt export pump) has not been investigated.  
GLE and PIB are P-gp and BCRP, BSEP and OATP1B1 inhibitors. GLE also inhibits OATP1B3. Inhibition of 
OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1 and MATE2K by GLE and PIB has not been identified up to 30µM. 
In vivo 
GLE and PIB combination 
The effect of GLE on PIB and reciprocally has been assessed as part of the study M13-586, Arm 1. Results 
show that that GLE (400 mg/day) significantly raises PIB exposure about 3,5-fold probably due to P-gp 
and BCRP inhibition.  
P-gp substrate 
GLE and PIB increase the exposure of digoxin of about 48% with a 90% CI [1,4-1,57] and its Cmax of 
about 72% with a 90%CI [1,45-2,04]. The Applicant therefore recommends a decrease of about half the 
dose of digoxin. This is not supported by CHMP. As a matter of fact, this effect could be more pronounced 
in the clinical setting notably, in women patients in whom the therapeutic margin of digoxin is narrower 
than in men, and in patients with an altered renal function. This study does not sufficiently reflect the 
clinical conditions to decide of any dose recommendations. Caution and therapeutic concentration 
monitoring of digoxin is recommended.

Likewise, with GLE and PIB, dabigatran AUC and Cmax increase about 2,4-fold and 2-fold, respectively. 
The magnitude of this interaction is similar to the one observed with dronedarone, a P-gp inhibitor, with 
which the combination of dabigatran is strictly contra-indicated. Therefore the proposed SmPC warning to 
not recommend dabigatran with the FDC is not supported. Dabigatran with GLE/PIB is contra-indicated. 
The combination with GLE/PIB led to increase statins exposure up to 8-fold. Therefore, GLE/PIB should be 
contra-indicated with atorvastatin and simvastatin, and not recommended with lovastatin. With 
pravastatin and rosuvastatin, a low dose should be used. 
EE containing oral contraceptives  
Oral contraceptive agents undergo metabolism by multiple pathways as CYP450 and UGT. EE is also a 
substrate of OATP1B1 and 2B1. With GLE and PIB, plasma exposures of EE, norgestrel, norgestromin and 
levonorgestrel increase about 28% and 40 %, 63%, 44%, and 68% respectively. Usually, these changes 
are not expected to be clinically relevant. Nevertheless the onset of asymptomatic grade 1 (n=3), 2 (n=1) 
and 3 (n=1) ALT elevation in 5 healthy women is compelling and foreshadow that these events, actually, 
may be more pronounced and symptomatic in the target population intended to be treated by GLE/PIB. 
The Applicant proposes to not recommend the combination of this DAA with EE containing regimen. This 
recommendation is not supported by CHMP, who agreed that this should be strengthened to a 
contra-indication. 
Inducers: Carbamazepine and rifampicin 
With rifampicin, GLE and PIB exposure decrease about 88% and 87%, respectively. With carbamazepine, 
this is about 66% and 50% respectively, but the 200 mg BID tested dose of carbamazepine being lower 
than the standard therapeutic dose, this warrants caution in the interpretation. Therefore, rifampicin and 
carbamazepine are contra-indicated with GLE/PIB.  
Acid-reducing agents 
GLE/PIB can be used with omeprazole at a dosage that does not exceed 20 mg QD.  
Ciclosporin 
With ciclosporin, 100 mg/day, GLE and PIB exposure (AUC) increase about 14%, 37% and 22%. On the 
contrary, with ciclosporin 400 mg, GLE and PIB exposure raises about 5- and 1,9- fold, respectively, 
whereas ciclosporin exposure falls within the 90%CI of [0,8-1,25]. 
These difference can be explained by the balance between the three compounds towards P-gp, BCRP and 
OATP and their affinity/inhibition for these transporters whereas at 400 mg day, ciclosporin inhibitory 
effect counterbalances this state and inhibition of GLE and PIB efflux and uptake (only with GLE) transport 
by ciclosporin prevails over. 
GLE/PIB is not recommended for use in patients requiring stable ciclosporin doses > 100 mg per day. If 
the combination is unavoidable, use can be considered if the benefit outweighs the risk with a close 
clinical monitoring. 
HIV boosted protease inhibitors: DRV/RTV, ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV 
The applicant has proposed a differential approach for LPV/RTV and DRV/RTV (not recommended) as 
compared to ATV/RTV (contra-indicated). Indeed, although PK parameters of GLE and PIB were 
significantly affected in presence of LPV/RTV and DRV/RTV, the concern on increased transaminases were 
mainly derived from the findings with ATV/RTV. After discussion through the procedure CHMP agreed to 
maintain close scrutiny in the post marketing setting.

The combination of efavirenz with GLE/PIB is not recommended. 
No clinically relevant interaction is expected with GLE/PIB and no dose adjustment is needed with 
amlodipine, felodipine, valsartan, losartan, buprenorphine/naloxone, methadone, abacavir, dolutegravir, 
emtricitabine, lamivudine, rilpivirine, raltegravir, lamotrigine, midazolam, caffeine, dextromethorphan, 
tolbutamide, norethindrone, levonorgestrel, norgestimate, tenofovir alefenamide. 
Pharmacodynamics: 
Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is a fixed dose combination of 2 new generation pan-genotypic DAA. 
Glecaprevir is an inhibitor of HCV NS3/4A protease with high pan-genotypic activity, with mean EC50 
ranging from 0.8 to 4.6 nM across GT1-4 and GT6. In contrast to previous protease inhibitors, this new 
generation PI has important potency against HCV GT 2 and GT3, even though the activity is lower than 
against GT1 (2- to 5- fold the activity against genotype 1). The Applicant has explored its use in 
combination with pibrentasvir in all genotypes. 
In vitro, glecaprevir showed optimized pharmacodynamics properties as compared to previous PIs. 
Indeed, apart from the poorly fit A156T resistance-associated substitution (RAS), glecaprevir activity is 
poorly affected (<5-fold loss of activity) by common GT1 RAS associated with virologic failure to other 
PIs, including single substitutions at key resistance-associated positions R155 or most but not all 
substitution at position D168.  
In vitro selection experiments and studies on effects by various amino acid substitutions on the 
susceptibility to GLE and PIB showed that substitutions at positions A156 and D168 are key mutations for 
GLE across genotypes 1-6. These NS3/4A RAVs are typical for other approved agents of this class: 
telaprevir (R155, A156), boceprevir (156, 155), simeprevir (R155, D168), grazoprevir (D168, 156), 
paritaprevir (D168, R155). These RAVs have a low viral fitness, and as a consequence they are 
infrequently detected in viruses from the untreated patient. It was also previously shown that such RAVs, 
selected during failing HCV therapy (containing an HCV protease inhibitor), reverted to wild type within 1 
year of follow-up in the  majority of cases (e.g. Sullivan 2013). Provided that a certain time would elapse 
from a previous treatment failure with NS3/4A-containing therapy, such previously selected drug 
resistance may therefore not have a relevant impact on GLE antiviral activity in a subsequent 
re-treatment.  
Naturally occurring NS3 polymorphisms seen in higher frequencies have a viral fitness close to that of wild 
type virus. For the NS3/4A class, Q80K, detected in 10-30% of untreated GT1a-infected patients, has 
been shown to lower treatment outcomes for some regimens (simeprevir, paritaprevir), despite a limited 
impact on genotypic susceptibility. This polymorphism has no impact on GLE in vitro susceptibility, or 
treatment outcomes. The one and only NS3 polymorphism with a negative impact on treatment outcomes 
with GLE/PIB, concerning genotype 3-infection, was substitution A166S, which was detected in the 
baseline virus of around 9% of genotype 3-infected patients. This clinical impact is not so clear from the 
in vitro results (not selected in vitro, and to our understanding with no impact on in vitro susceptibility) 
The applicant was requested to discuss this issue and has clarified that the apparent enrichment of A166S 
at baseline in the virologic failure subjects was most likely coincidental and does not contribute to 
virologic failure. 
Pibrentasvir is an inhibitor of HCV NS5A with picomolar pan-genotypic activity across all genotypes (EC50 
values of 1.4 pM to 5.0 pM in GT1-6). PIB appears similarly highly potent in all genotypes including GT1, 
GT2 and GT3, which contrast with other NS5A inhibitors and in the different subtypes tested (notably in 
GT4 and GT6). Moreover, in vitro activity does not seem to be significantly impacted by presence of 
common RAS (notably L31M in GT2a or Y93H, A30K in GT3).  
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 63/126 
 
 
 
 
 
In vitro, pibrentasvir retains activity against Y93H which confers to this drug a potential advantage over 
other NS5A.  
While certain double and triple mutants conferred fold changes to genotype 1a and genotype 3a virus, 
most of the combinations studied did not. For the other geno/sub types, the double/triple mutants studied 
did not confer a seemingly relevant FC to PIB in vitro. In analogy with A166S and outcomes in genotype 
3-infection, the one baseline NS5A substitution (A30K) that was associated with a reduced clinical efficacy 
(again in genotype-3 infection, detected in 6% of baseline samples) was not selected in vitro, and yielded 
no fold change. The applicant, in response to the day 90 LoQ, further underlines that A30K unlike Y93H 
requires at least two nucleotide changes from the WT sequence. 
Additive activity was documented for PIB and GLE and combination of both drugs has been shown to 
increase the genetic barrier to resistance. There was additive to synergistic activity with sofosbuvir, with 
ribavirin.  
Glecaprevir has been shown to have no specific activity against HIV and HBV. Moreover, GLE activity was 
not impacted in presence of common HIV PIs, lopinavir and darunavir, and vice versa.  
As regards the salient aspect of the clinical virology, in monotherapy study in GT1, a ~4 log decline in viral 
load was documented after 3 days of each GLE or PIB monotherapy. Few patients developed RAS at key 
position in NS3 or NS5A. Unfortunately, the viral kinetic/resistance in monotherapy has not been explored 
in other GT, notably in GT3. 
The applicant’s choice in monotherapy design (only in GT1 patients) has limitation to adequately 
substantiate the genetic barrier in the key patient population of GT3 patients. 
As regards the PK/PD relationships for safety aspects, a trend to higher incidence of total bilirubin 
elevation in subjects with higher GLE exposure was highlighted. This may be due to the inhibition of 
UGT1A1 by GLE/PIB. However, the clinical significance of such relationship seems limited. 
Finally, based on the total amount of in vitro, in vivo data and the QTc study, this FDC does not raise 
particular issue on the risk of QT prolongation. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The GLE/PIB 300/120mg dose has been selected to maximize SVR and minimize selection of resistant 
variants while balancing the safety of this combination. This dose selection was made on the basis of the 
following studies: 
•  A Phase 2a monotherapy study in HCV GT1-infected patients (Study M13-595) that showed that 
GLE doses of 100 mg to 700 mg QD or for PIB doses of 40 mg to 400 mg QD led to similar 
decreases ~4 log in mean HCV plasma RNA viral load from baseline on day 3.

Assessment report

Page 64/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Further, GLE doses of 300 mg and 200 mg combined with PIB 120 mg or 40 mg for 12 weeks have 
been evaluated in Phase II dose ranging studies (Part I and II of SURVEYOR studies). Rates of 
virologic failure were examined across genotypes and suggest GLE/PIB dose of 300/120 will 
maximize SVR rate compared to lower dose-combinations. Notably, two virological breakthroughs 
were observed in GT3-infected patients receiving 200mg GLE (and PIB 40mg and 120mg 
respectively) while no GT3 infected subject receiving 300 mg GLE combined with 120 mg PIB 
experienced virologic breakthrough. In addition, in GT1, 1 patient had relapse in the 40mg PIB arm 
while all GT1 achieved SVR in the 120mg PIB arm (co-administered with the same dose of GLE). 
Table 7 - Summary of virologic failures observed in dose-ranging studies M14-867 and 
M14-868 (part 1 and part 2) 
•  Moreover modeling and simulations including simulations within difficult to treat populations or with 
8 weeks treatment duration suggest that higher SVR rates can be achieved with a regimen of 
GLE/PIB dose of 300/120mg compared to lower dose combinations. Exposure-efficacy analyses as 
well as results from phase II studies (in non-cirrhotic patients) suggest that addition of ribavirin 
would not have a meaningful impact on SVR. 
• 
Exposure safety analysis shows wide safety margins for GLE exposure (at least 6-fold) to ALT and 
total bilirubin elevations. Although GLE 300 mg increases PIB exposure at 120 mg by 4-fold, the PIB 
exposure was less than the exposures of PIB 600 mg QD for which favorable safety profile was 
reported in study M13-356.

As reflected in the above table, the main studies were conducted in non-cirrhotic treatment-naive 
patients or patients having failed previous treatment with PegIFN+ribavirin/PR (including some patients

A small sample sized study was performed in DAA treatment experienced patients (almost exclusively 
GT1 and only 4 GT4), the MAGELLAN-1 (M15-410) study. Some HIV co-infected patients were included in 
the development programme and a dedicated study is ongoing in this population. 
A dedicated study was performed in cirrhotic patients and in patients with CKD. 
The studies shared some common features: 
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria to define study populations were harmonized across the registrational 
studies; key inclusion and exclusion criteria in the majority of these studies are listed as follows:

There were no upper limits for baseline body mass index (BMI) or age in the registrational studies and 
subjects were included regardless of any positive toxicology screen result. 
Screening laboratory inclusion criteria were similar across all 9 studies, except for small differences in the 
Phase 2 supportive studies (and the study/parts in cirrhotic subjects or CKD Stage 4 or 5 subjects, as 
appropriate): 
The following laboratory parameters must have been fulfilled at screening in the majority of these 
studies: 
•  Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase ≤ 10 × the upper limit of normal 
(ULN); 
•  Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN (for subjects without cirrhosis) or a total bilirubin ≤ 3 × ULN (for subjects 
• 
with cirrhosis); 
Platelets ≥ 60,000/μL (≥ 40,000/μL in Study M15-462) and ≥ 90,000/μL in subjects with and 
without cirrhosis, respectively; 
•  Haemoglobin A1c indicating no uncontrolled diabetes (e.g., ≤ 8 or ≤ 8.5%); 
•  Haemoglobin ≥ the lower limit of normal; 
•  Albumin ≥ 2.8 g/dL or ≥ lower limit of normal in subjects with or without cirrhosis, respectively; 
International normalized ratio ≤ 2.3 or ≤ 1.5 in subjects with or without cirrhosis, respectively, 
• 
unless subject had known haemophilia or was stable on an anticoagulant regimen affecting 
international normalized ratio. 
The main differences between studies were related to HCV genotype, the presence or absence of severe 
renal impairment, and the presence or absence of cirrhosis. 
Subjects with cirrhosis were allowed in 4 registrational studies (Study M14-172, Study M14-868 Part 3, 
Study M15-410 Part 2, and Study M15-462). A consistent definition for documenting the presence or 
absence of cirrhosis was employed: 
An absence of cirrhosis was defined by documented evidence of: 
•  A liver biopsy within 24 months prior to or during screening, demonstrating the absence of 
cirrhosis, e.g., a METAVIR, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, IASL, Scheuer, or Laennec fibrosis score of ≤ 3, 
Ishak fibrosis score of ≤ 4; or 
•  A FibroScan® score of < 12.5 kPa within 6 months of screening or during the screening period; or 
o  Subjects with an indeterminate FibroScan® score (12.5 ≤ score < 14.6) were to have a 
qualifying liver biopsy 
•  A screening FibroTest score of ≤ 0.48 and aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index 
(APRI) < 1. 
o  Subjects with an indeterminate FibroTest (0.48 < result < 0.75), or conflicting FibroTest 
and APRI results (e.g., FibroTest ≤ 0.48, but APRI ≥ 1) were to have a qualifying 
FibroScan® or qualifying liver biopsy 
The presence of cirrhosis was defined by documented evidence of: 
•  Histologic diagnosis of cirrhosis on a liver biopsy e.g., a METAVIR, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, IASL, 
Scheuer, or Laennec fibrosis score of > 3 or Ishak fibrosis score of > 4; or 
FibroScan® score ≥ 14.6 kPa; 
• 
o  Subjects with an indeterminate FibroScan® score (12.5 ≤ score < 14.6) were to have a 
qualifying liver biopsy; or 
•  A screening FibroTest score of ≥ 0.75 and APRI > 2; 
o  Subjects with an indeterminate FibroTest (0.48 < result < 0.75) or discordant FibroTest 
and APRI results (e.g., FibroTest ≥ 0.75, but APRI ≤ 2) were to have a qualifying 
FibroScan® or liver biopsy

Study designs: 
All efficacy data through Post-Treatment Week 12 were included for the primary endpoint (sustained 
virologic response 12 weeks post dosing [SVR12]) and secondary endpoints of on-treatment virologic 
failure (OTVF) and post-treatment relapse. Comparisons to an active control, historical controls, and 
across arms with different treatment durations of GLE/PIB were conducted for the primary efficacy 
endpoint analyses. 
The individual registrational studies employed different and complementary study designs, that is: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Comparison to historical control: Studies M13-590, M15-464, and M14-868 Part 4 evaluated primary 
efficacy compared to a historical SVR12 rate for the current standard-of-care direct-acting antiviral 
agent (DAA) regimen at the time of study start. A –6% margin was used for non-inferiority to the 
historical rate in all of these comparisons. 
Duration controlled: Studies M13-590, M13-594, M14-868 (Part 3) and M15-410 (Part 2) each 
implemented a duration-controlled study design evaluating either 8 weeks versus 12 weeks with a –
5% margin (Study M13-590), 8 weeks versus 12 weeks with a –6% margin (Study M13-594), or 12 
weeks versus 16 weeks without hypothesis testing (Study M14-868 Part 3 and Study M15-410 Part 
2) of GLE/PIB. 
Placebo-controlled: Study M15-464 was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled, and 
enabled characterization of the GLE/PIB safety profile. 
Active-controlled: Study M13-594 randomized and compared 12 weeks GLE/PIB versus 12 weeks 
sofosbuvir (SOF) and daclatasvir (DCV) with a –6% non-inferiority margin. 
Open-label, single arm: Additional studies employed single-arm, open-label, assigned duration study 
designs among important subpopulations, including: 
(1) subjects with compensated (Child-Pugh Class A) cirrhosis (Study M14-172 and Study 
M14-868 Part 3),  
(2) subjects with CKD Stage 4 or 5 (Study M15-462), and  
(3) HCV GT2-, GT4-, GT5-, and GT6-infected subjects without cirrhosis (Study M13-583, 
12-weeks of GLE/PIB in HCV GT4, GT5 or GT6; Study M14-868 Part 4: 8 weeks of 
GLE/PIB in HCV GT2, GT4, GT5, or GT6). 
A single, active comparator or historical control could not be employed across the registrational studies 
since, at the time of study conduct, there was no single regimen that was approved across all HCV 
genotypes: 
- Study M13-590: The first of the 3 ranked primary efficacy endpoints was a comparison of the SVR12 rate 
of the 12-week treatment duration (Arm A) in the intention-to-treat mono-infected HCV GT1 population 
excluding  prior SOF + RBV ± pegylated interferon (pegIFN) failures (ITT-PS) to the historical SVR12 rate 
of 97% from ombitasvir/paritaprevir/r + dasabuvir ±RBV or SOF/LDV. 
- Study M15-464 Arm A and Study M14-868 Part 4 Arm S GT2: Non-inferiority of the SVR12 rate of 
GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg QD for 12 weeks (Study M15-464) or 8 weeks (Study M14-868 Part 4 Arm S 
GT2), excluding prior SOF + RBV ± pegylated interferon (pegIFN) failures, to the historical SVR12 rate of 
95% of SOF + RBV for 12 weeks was to be established. 
- Study M13-594: Non-inferiority of the SVR12 rate for GT3-infected TN subjects without cirrhosis of 
GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg QD for 12 weeks (Arm A) could be achieved with respect to the active control 
arm.

During the conduct of the Phase 3 Study M15-464, treatment assignment remained blinded to the 
investigator, subject, study site personnel, and AbbVie throughout the 12-week Double-Blind Treatment 
Period for an unbiased comparison of safety. All other Phase 2 and 3 studies were open-label. 
Randomization was utilized in Studies M15-464, M13-594, M13-590, M14-868, and M15-410. Studies 
M13-583, M14-172, and M15-462 were single-arm studies; therefore, no randomization was performed. 
Study M14-867 was not randomized. 
Missing Data Imputation for SVR : 
For analyses of SVR, subjects missing visit values will have backward imputation applied, if possible. For 
backward imputation, if the nearest HCV RNA value after the SVR window is unquantifiable or 
undetectable, then it will be used to impute the HCV RNA value in the SVR window. If a subject is missing 
an HCV RNA value within the appropriate SVR window after performing backward imputation, then this 
value will be imputed with an HCV RNA value from a local laboratory if present; otherwise, the HCV RNA 
value will be missing. Subjects with missing HCV RNA data in the analysis window, after imputations, will 
be imputed as a failure.

Sample size 
291 to 321 subjects were planned to be enrolled in a 2:1 ratio to the ABT-493 and ABT-530 treatment arm 
or placebo (194 to 214 subjects in Arm A and 97 to 107 subjects in Arm B). The 21 to 51 subjects (14 to 
34 subjects in Arm A) with prior SOF + RBV ± pegIFN failure were not to be included in the primary 
endpoint; therefore, 180 subjects were to be available in Arm A for the primary endpoint (SVR12). 
Randomisation 
The study consisted of 3 periods: 
•  Double blind (DB) treatment period: subjects randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 12 weeks 
of ABT-493/ABT-530 (Arm A) or 12 weeks of matching placebo (Arm B), respectively.  
•  Open-Label (OL) Treatment Period: subjects randomized to placebo in the DB Treatment Period 
received OL ABT-493/ABT-530 for 12 weeks.  
• 
Post-Treatment Period: subjects randomized to active drug (Arm A) who completed or 
prematurely discontinued study drug during the DB treatment period and subjects randomized to 
placebo (Arm B) who completed the OL Treatment Period or prematurely discontinued study drug 
in the OL Treatment Period were followed for 24 weeks post-treatment to monitor HCV RNA levels 
and to evaluate safety, efficacy, and the emergence and persistence of resistant viral variants.  
Randomization of subjects was stratified into 3 strata by type of previous treatment experience, i.e., HCV 
treatment-naïve or the last treatment regimen that the subject had received: 
• 
IFN or  
• 
pegIFN ± RBV or  
•  SOF + RBV ± pegIFN  
Blinding (masking) 
During the DB treatment period, the applicant, investigators, and subjects were blinded to drug 
assignment and virologic results.  
Statistical methods 
Primary efficacy analysis 
Percentage of subjects treated with ABT-493/ABT-530 with SVR12 compared to the 95% SVR12 rate of 
the current standard-of-care (SOF + RBV for 12 weeks). Non-inferiority margin 6%. 
Secondary efficacy analysis 
The percentage of these subjects treated with ABT-493/ABT-530 with SVR12 would be superior to the 
95% SVR12 rate of the current standard of care (SOF + RBV for 12 weeks) if the LCB of the 2-sided 95%

Open-label 
Statistical methods 
Primary efficacy analysis 
Non-inferiority in the SVR12 rate of the 12-week regimen (Arm A) to the standard of care (SOF + DCV) 
was shown if the lower bound of the CI for the difference (Arm A minus Arm B) was above the 
non-inferiority margin of –6% or if the lower bound of the CI for the SVR12 rate within Arm A was greater 
than 92%. Non-inferiority of Arm C to Arm A was defined similarly.  
Secondary efficacy analysis 
Superiority of Arm A to Arm B would have been shown if the lower bound of the CI for the difference in 
SVR12 rates between arms (Arm A minus Arm B) would have been above 0%.  
Numbers analysed

Treatments 
Part 1  
•  GT2-infected treatment-naïve (TN) and treatment-experienced (TE) subjects without cirrhosis 
were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 1 of 3 treatment arms: 
o  Arm A: ABT-493 300 mg once daily (QD) + ABT-530 120 mg QD for 12 weeks 
o  Arm B: ABT-493 200 mg QD + ABT-530 120 mg QD for 12 weeks 
o  Arm C: ABT-493 200 mg QD + ABT-530 120 mg QD + RBV 1,000 mg or 1,200 mg (weight 
based) divided twice daily (BID) for 12 weeks 
•  GT3-infected TN and TE subjects without cirrhosis were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio into 1 of 4 
treatment arms: 
o  Arm D: ABT-493 300 mg QD + ABT-530 120 mg QD for 12 weeks 
o  Arm E: ABT-493 200 mg QD + ABT-530 120 mg QD for 12 weeks 
o  Arm F: ABT-493 200 mg QD + ABT-530 120 mg QD + RBV 1,000 mg or 1,200 mg (weight 
based) divided BID for 12 weeks

Subjects were stratified in Part 1 by prior HCV treatment history (naïve or experienced). 
Part 2 
Arms in Part 2 were enabled for enrolment based on pre-specified safety and efficacy criteria for data from 
Part 1 Arms A – G, once all subjects in Part 1 had reached Post-Treatment Week 4. AbbVie determined 
which of the enabled arms in Part 2 would be enrolled. Based on favourable Part 1 results, all planned 
treatment arms in Part 2 were enabled per protocol. AbbVie decided to enrol enabled Arms J, L, O, and P 
in Part 2. 
•  GT2-infected TN and TE subjects without cirrhosis were enrolled into:  
o  Arm J: ABT-493 mg QD + ABT-590 120 mg QD for 8 weeks 
•  GT3-infected TN and TE subjects without cirrhosis were enrolled into: 
o  Arm LTN: ABT-493 300 mg QD + ABT-530 120 mg QD for 8 weeks 
o  Arm LTE: ABT-493 300 mg QD + ABT-530 120 mg QD for 12 weeks 
•  GT3-infected TN subjects with cirrhosis were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 1 of 2 treatment 
arms: 
o  Arm O: ABT-493 300 mg QD + ABT-530 120 mg QD for 12 weeks 
o  Arm P: ABT-493 300 mg QD + ABT-530 120 mg QD + RBV 800 mg QD for 12 weeks 
Part 3 
Arms in Part 3 were enabled for enrolment of GT3-infected subjects based on pre-specified criteria for 
efficacy data from Part 2 Arms L (TE cohort) and O (TN cohort) once all applicable subjects in Arms L and 
O had reached Post-Treatment Week 4. AbbVie determined which of the enabled arms in Part 3 for 
non-cirrhotic and/or cirrhotic subjects would proceed to enrolment. 
Non-cirrhotic and/or cirrhotic subjects meeting all eligibility criteria were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 1 
of 2 treatment arms in Part 3 with randomization stratified by presence or absence of cirrhosis and by 
prior HCV treatment history (naïve or experienced) for cirrhotic subjects. 
Arms Q and R in Part 3 for all GT3 cohorts (non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic) were enabled based on the 
supporting data from Part 2 and the pre-specified efficacy criteria. 
•  GT3-infected TN subjects with cirrhosis were only enrolled into: 
o  Arm Q: ABT-493/ABT-530 300 mg/120 mg QD for 12 weeks

Primary efficacy analysis 
For each arm, or for each population within an arm, as applicable, the number and percentage of subjects 
achieving SVR12 were summarized along with 95% confidence intervals using Wilson score intervals 
In Part 4, the percentage of GT2-infected DAA-naïve subjects without cirrhosis treated with 
ABT-493/ABT-530 who achieved SVR12 would be non-inferior to the historical 95% SVR12 rate of the 
current standard of care (SOF + RBV for 12 weeks) in GT2-infected DAA-naïve subjects without cirrhosis 
if the lower confidence bound (LCB) of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval using normal approximation 
of the percentage of these subjects with SVR12 was > 89%.

Summary of main efficacy results 
A total of 2,376 subjects were randomized or enrolled in the registrational studies or supportive Phase 2 
studies. The percentage of subjects who prematurely discontinued study drug was low (1.6%), with 0.5% 
of subjects discontinuing due to an AE. 
Main demographic characteristics in the phase 2 and phase 3 analysis sets are summarized below: 
Table 10 - Demographic Characteristics (ITT Population, Phase 2 and 3 Analysis Set) 
The overall population included in the development program was roughly balanced according to sex, 
European patients account for almost 40% of the population. A fair amount of patients is more than 65 
years old. Besides the GT1, the GT3 population is significant. GT5 and GT6 were also represented (32 
(including 2 cirrhotic) and 48 (7 cirrhotic) respectively).  
Main baseline disease characteristics were the following:

Page 86/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 11 - Baseline Disease Characteristics (ITT Population, Phase 2 and 3 Analysis Set) 
A total of 308 patients (13%), of which 116 GT3 with cirrhosis received GLE/PIB in the phase II/III 
studies. Most of the patients had F0-F1 fibrosis (70%) and patients with baseline fibrosis stage F3 account 
for 10% (n=245) of the studied population. The majority of the treatment experienced population 
consists in PR pretreated patients including a small proportion of patients with also experience to SOF.  
A summary of SVR12 according to subgroup is presented:  
- In non-GT3 patients,  
SVR12 rate were high regardless of cirrhosis status. Rates of on treatment virologic failures or relapses 
were very low across treatment arms (durations) and genotypes, next table. 
GLE/PIB demonstrated non-inferiority to corresponding pre-specified historical controls in the individual 
studies (M13-590, M15-464 and M14-868). Furthermore, in GT1-infected subjects, GLE/PIB for 8 weeks 
was non-inferior to 12 weeks using the protocol-specified NI-margin (5%) in study M13-590. The one and 
only genotype-1 infected patient with virological failure (8 week-arm, table below), had OTVF (not 
relapse) and a fibrosis stage of F0/F1.

Numbers with GT4-6 are limited. However, failures were very rare. The two relapses occurred in genotype 
2-infected patients treated for 8 weeks; both were treatment experienced, and with a fibrosis stage of 
F0/F1 and F3, respectively. (As mentioned, numbers of genotype 2-infected with F2/F3 fibrosis who 
received 8 weeks was around 30). Further, in vitro results shown in the pharmacodynamics section 
support bridging of efficacy to that obtained in genotype 1-infection. In addition, with regards to early 
viral kinetics, nearly 100 % of patients had unquantifiable HCV RNA at week 4 across genotypes in the 
above studies (data not shown). 
Table 13 - SVR12 rates by prior treatment experience, HCV genotype and duration for 
non-GT3-infected subjects (ITT population, phase 2 and 3 analysis set) 
Evidently, the presence of baseline polymorphisms in NS3 and/or NS5A did not have an impact on SVR12 
rates for subjects infected with these genotypes (previously untreated or PRS experienced). 
Treatment-emergent substitutions at A156V (in NS3) plus Q30R/L31M/H58D (in NS5A) were seen in the 
two failures with genotype 1a-infection, and no emergent substitutions were seen in the two failures with 
genotype 2-infection.  
While prior treatment by PR or PRS is not expected to raise issue on cross resistance, it is acknowledged 
that such patients are still selected for other parameters that may have a negative impact on the

likelihood of achieving SVR, regardless of the treatment chosen. The data highlight the limitation in terms 
of SVR rate in TE-PRS GT2 8 weeks and in terms of sample size for GT 5-6 however bridging efficacy with 
GT1 based on in vitro activity and lack of expected cross resistance with PR/PRS can be acknowledged.  
- In GT3 patients, 
A stepwise approach was adopted for GT3 patients. Thus, the pivotal phase III ENDURANCE-3 study 
included GT3 treatment-naïve patients only and GT3 patients were not included in the pivotal study in 
cirrhotic (EXPEDITION-1) or in the DAA-failure study (MAGELLAN-1). However, GT3 cirrhotic patients and 
GT3 treatment-experienced but DAA-naïve patients were later included in a dedicated part of the 
SURVEYOR-II study.  
In ENDURANCE-3, GT3 treatment-naïve subjects without cirrhosis were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 
receive GLE/PIB 12 weeks or SOF+DCV 12 weeks. After enrollment in those arms was completed, 
additional subjects were to be assigned to GLE/PIB 8 weeks. 
Numbers with F3 fibrosis are limited, but in fact the highest in the 8-week arm (i.e. not favouring the 
outcome in that arm).

Non-inferiority of GLE/PIB 12 weeks as compared to SOF+DCV 12 weeks was achieved in the ITT and PP 
population (ITT: lower bound of 95% CI for the difference was –5.6%, which was above the

non-inferiority margin of –6%). However, it is noteworthy that there were numerically higher rate of 
virologic failure, notably relapse in GLE/PIB arms (1.4-3.3%) as compared to SOF/DCV (0.9%). 
Moreover, there were 2 breakthroughs in GLE/PIB arms versus none in SOF/DCV.  
Non-inferiority of the 8 weeks GLE/PIB regimen to that of the 12 weeks regimen was also achieved in the 
ITT and PP populations (ITT: lower bound of 97.5% CI for the difference was –5.4%, which was above 
the non-inferiority margin of –6%). However, more relapses were observed in the 8 weeks treatment 
arm (3.3%) as compared to the 12 weeks treatment arms (1.4%).  
Two patients with F3 fibrosis relapsed following 8 weeks of therapy (2/27 treated). Both had the A30K 
polymorphism present in the baseline virus, which may have played a role as well. In summary, there is 
a tendency (without statistical significance) for lower results in patients with moderate and severe fibrosis 
treated for 8 weeks. Baseline HCV-RNA levels do not seem of relevant importance for the outcome (even 
with the shorter treatment duration).

While some concerns could have been raised on the limited difference in SVR rates in F3, even though 
acknowledging that the difference might be accentuated by random baseline imbalances, useful 
complementary data on 8 weeks of GLE+ PIB therapy in genotype 3 was provided by Abbvie upon request 
(TN, non-cirrhotic patients; SURVEYOR-II, part 2, arm L), table below. Here 28/29 achieved SVR12, the

As rather unexpected the TE with PRS seems to have somewhat higher impact than cirrhosis on likelihood 
of SVR. The highest relapse rate in the pooled data set is seen in TE non-cirrhotic patients treated for 12 
weeks (in SURVEYOR-II). The virological failure rate in those treated for 16 weeks was low; indeed 48/51 
(94%) achieved SVR12 of those hardest to cure, cirrhotic patients with prior treatment failure. 
Outcome by baseline polymorphisms, and resistance in those failing (GT 3) 
While not predicted from in vitro data, the presence of A166S in NS3 or A30K in NS5A irrespective of other 
polymorphisms was associated with lowered SVR 12 rates (next table). The overall SVR12 rate in the 
presence of A30K without A166S was 85.7% (8 weeks) and 92.9% (12 weeks), whereas the SVR12 rate 
in the presence of A166S without A30K was 92.3% (8 weeks) and 100% (12 weeks), suggesting that 
impact of the combination of these polymorphisms was more strongly associated with NS5A-A30K than 
with the NS3 polymorphism. Given the overall 6.3% prevalence of A30K among GT3-infected patients, 
the predicted decrease in SVR12 attributable to impact of A30K between 8 and 12 weeks durations in 
treatment-naïve subjects without cirrhosis is < 1%. The frequency of double mutation (A166S + A30K) is 
very low.

A typical pattern of resistance in patients failing therapy is that touched upon in the pharmacodynamic 
section, where A30K is present at baseline, and A30K + Y93H at failure (NS5A, FC 70), accompanied by 
key mutation 156 or 168 in NS3 at failure. 
Some patients who failed therapy certainly did end up with a virus with troublesome resistance with 
regards a successful immediate re-treatment. For reasons discussed in the pharmacodynamics section 
there are reasons to believe that NS3 resistance would revert rather rapidly post treatment, which may 
yield options for successful re-treatment, for example with the addition of sofosbuvir. It is expected that 
data will be gained in the future. 
Of note, failures to the bi-therapy in the clinical development programme were rescued by the FDC 
intensified with sofosbuvir and ribavirin (MAGELLAN-3 study). The applicant was asked to discuss options 
to rescue GLE/PIB failure and to provide any available data from the ongoing MAGELLAN-3 study at the 
D90. The data submitted in response concern limited numbers or preliminary data (notably no SVR12 
data for MAGELLAN-3). It is noted, that re-treatment studies concern agents where the resistance is 
either not an issue (peg-IFN + ribavirin + sofosbuvir) or where sofosbuvir +/- ribavirin is added to the 
NS3/4A and NS5A class and the treatment duration is increased in order to optimize therapy. 
In patients with DAA-experience to NS5A and/or PI  
The applicant conducted a dedicated phase II study in patients with prior DAA (NS5A and/or PI) failure 
with or without cirrhosis. The study only planned to enroll patients infected with GT1 or GT4-6 
(MAGELLAN-1): 
Part 1 included chronic HCV GT1-infected adult subjects without cirrhosis. Different doses/regimens were 
tested, including addition of ribavirin. In part 1, overall SVR12 rates were > 86% in all treatment arms. 
The virologic failure rate among those with available SVR12 data in Arms B and C was the same at 4.5% 
(1/22), suggesting that the presence of RBV in the regimen does not improve efficacy. 
Part 2 of the study included a broader population: HCV GT1 or GT4 – GT6-infected DAA-experienced 
subjects with compensated liver disease with or without cirrhosis.  
In part 2, HCV GT1- or GT4– GT6-infected, DAA treatment-experienced subjects with compensated liver 
disease with or without cirrhosis were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of 2 treatment arms: 
- Arm D: ABT-493/ABT-530 300 mg/120 mg QD for 12 weeks 
- Arm E: ABT-493/ABT-530 300 mg/120 mg QD for 16 weeks. 
Randomization was stratified by HCV genotype (GT1 or GT4 – GT6) and by previous experience to the 
following 2 DAA regimen classes: 
1. NS5A inhibitor (± PI)-experienced, limited to DCV-, LDV-, or OBV-containing combination regimens; 
or 
2. NS5A inhibitor-naïve/NS3/4A PI-experienced, limited to: PTV/r-, SMV-, TVR-, or BOC-containing 
combination regimens. 
The study in practice concern GT-1 infection; all but 4 patients had genotype 1, the other 4 had genotype 
4-infection. Notably the study does not deliver any re-treatment data on genotype-3 infected patients. 
The median time since prior treatment differs between arms; this could have an impact on outcomes, in 
particular for those for those exposed to NS3/4A for reasons discussed in the pharmacodynamics section 
(reversion of resistance).

The overall prevalence of baseline polymorphisms at key amino acid positions (for the NS3/4A and NS5A 
classes) was around 15 % in NS3 and 60 % in NS5A. Of those with prior exposure to the NS5A class, key 
substitutions were detected in around 80% (using a 15% threshold of deep sequencing); for those with 
prior NS3/4A experience, key NS3 substitutions were detected in 20% of cases (15/75).  Approximately 
30 % had no baseline polymorphisms in either target. 
Six GT1-infected subjects in the 12-week arms and 4 GT1-infected subjects in the 16-week arm 
experienced virologic failure. Main data is summarised below. Please note that the second part of the

Among PI-experienced/NS5A inhibitor-naïve subjects, the presence of baseline polymorphisms had no

As expected, NS5A RAVs were highly prevalent among NS5A inhibitor-experienced subjects, whether the 
previous treatment was with an NS5A inhibitor alone or an NS5A inhibitor plus a PI. Those naïve to PIs 
maintained high SVR rates overall, and in the recommended 16-week arm there was only 1 virologic 
failure.  
In subjects experienced to both classes, the lower response was driven by subjects who had mutations in 
both NS3 (positions 155, 156, 168) and NS5A targets (positions 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, 93); here the 
response rate was 4/9. Among subjects that did not have baseline polymorphisms in both targets, the 
overall SVR12 rate was 92.9 % (26/28), including 87.5 % (14/16) at the 12-week duration and 100% 
(12/12) at the 16-week duration. 
There were 27 subjects with cirrhosis in the study of which 14/15 (93.3 %) subjects who received 
GLE/PIB for 12 weeks reached SVR12 and 9/12 (75.0 %) who received GLE/PIB for 16 weeks reached 
SVR12, results lower than in non-cirrhotic patients.  
Below outcomes by prior actual regimens, commonly used in the EU, are shown.  Of note, time since that 
prior failure is not taken into account.

As expected the failure rate was higher in those exposed to both the NS3/4A and the NS5A inhibitor 
classes. At failure, and sometime after, double class resistance can be detected in the virus in the majority 
of such patients, including key NS3 mutations conferring cross resistance to GLE, for GZR D168 and 156; 
for PTV D168 and R155. Over time the NS3 substitutions revert to WT. The proportion of patients with a 
virus that contain NS5A double mutations conferring cross resistance to GLE (at failure) is more limited, 
but does exist.  
A total of 10 virological failures were reported in this study.  
The impact of any single specific polymorphism was difficult to determine due to low prevalence in the 
overall subject population or its presence in combination with other variants within a single subject. Based 
on phenotype data for the different combinations of polymorphisms present at baseline in subjects who 
experienced virologic failure, there was no predictive value for treatment outcome based on drug 
susceptibility. In addition, the combination of polymorphisms seen from patient to patient did not show a 
specific pattern that was predictive of virologic failure. 
Resistance outcomes (baseline and at failure) for those failing therapy in MAGELLAN-1 is shown in the 
next table.  
Those data illustrate that patients with DAA experience are more likely to experience BT. As a matter of 
fact, among the 10 virologic failures reported, 6 were breakthrough and 4 were relapse. Patients with 
both NS5A and PI experience are overrepresented in the patients experiencing virologic failure.

The majority of patients do seem to end up with a virus that would be very hard to treat.

Clinical studies in special populations  
- Patients with severe renal impairment 
The applicant conducted a dedicated phase III study in GT1-6-infected patients with CKD stage 4 or 5 
(EXPEDITION-4). Given that sofosbuvir is not an appropriate option in these patients and that 
grazoprevir/elbasvir only covers CKD with GT1 or GT4, this dedicated study was welcome for this FDC the 
PK of which being marginally affected by renal impairment. 
The CKD population mainly consisted in GT1 patients, with balanced TN and TE population (with almost 
exclusively IFN pretreatment, only 2 patients with SOF pretreatment. Around 82% were undergoing 
dialysis.

SVR12 was achieved by 98.1% (102/104) of subjects in the ITT population. No subject experienced 
on-treatment virologic failure or post-treatment relapse. 
- Patients with HIV-HCV coinfection 
In ENDURANCE-1, a total of 33 HIV-HCV GT1 co-infected patients were included, all were on stable ART 
regimen containing either dolutegravir, raltegravir or rilpivirin. All achieved SVR12. 
A dedicated study in HCV GT1-6/HIV co-infected patients (EXPEDITION-2) is ongoing. As part of the 
responses to the D90, some contributory data (notably on 8 weeks regimen for GT2 and GT3) were 
provided as follows:

In the Phase 2 and 3 Analysis Set, after stratification by prior treatment experience, HCV genotype, 
treatment duration, and study, the differences observed in SVR12 rates across demographic and baseline 
disease characteristics of race, age, ethnicity, HCV subtype, HCV treatment history, IL28B genotype, 
baseline fibrosis stage, geographic region, country, baseline measurement of BMI, HOMA-IR, platelets, 
albumin, creatinine clearance, estimated glomerular filtration rate, HIV-1 infection, history of diabetes, 
history of depression or bipolar disorder, history of bleeding disorder, baseline metabolic syndrome, 
cirrhosis, severe renal impairment, injection drug use, concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors, and 
stable opiate substitution use were not statistically significant. 
The statistically significant subgroup results were:  
- Sex: Females tend to have higher SVR12 rates than males: 98.7% versus 96.4%,  
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017

- Baseline HCV RNA level: There was a significantly higher SVR12 rate in subjects with baseline HCV RNA 
< 1 million IU/mL than in glecaprevir/pibrentasvir subjects with baseline HCV RNA ≥ 1 million IU/mL : 
98.5% versus 96.6%. The largest observed differences were 12.1% for the overall rate among TE-NS5A 
and/or TE-PI subjects and 11.0% among TE-PRS GT3-infected subjects),  
- Baseline polymorphisms in NS3 and/or NS5A: there was a significant difference in SVR12 rates between 
subjects with baseline polymorphisms in NS3 only (100.0%), NS5A only (96.0%), both NS3 and NS5A 
(61.1%), and none (98.0%). The low overall SVR12 rate of 61.1% for subjects with both NS3 and NS5A 
baseline polymorphisms was largely driven by 5 failures among the 9 subjects (Study M15-410) with both 
prior NS5A and PI experience who had RAS in both targets (overall SVR12 rate of 44.4%). 
- DAA compliance: there was a significantly higher SVR12 rate in subjects who were compliant (97.8% of 
subjects, based on overall compliance between 80% and 120%) compared to those who were not 
(94.0%). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The main studies were conducted in non-cirrhotic treatment-naive patients or patients having failed 
previous treatment with PegIFN+RBV (including some patients with PegIFN+RBV+ Sofosbuvir, (“PRS”)).  
The applicant’s choice in terms of clinical development does not capitalize on the theoretical potential 
added value of this new NS5A for HCV GT3 patients with viral strains harbouring NS5A RAS. Indeed, the 
population of pretreated patients mostly consists of Peg-IFN+Ribavirin (+/- sofosbuvir) and only a small 
sample sized study (MAGELLAN-1) has been dedicated in DAA experienced patients and without targeting 
GT3 patients. Thus scrutinizing the virologic response according to NS5A baseline RAS +/- NS3/4 is the 
only way to substantiate this theoretical added value.  
Another potential added value relies on the marginal renal elimination of both components of this FDC 
making this option a potential candidate for the challenging population of patients with renal impairment 
including patients with dialysis. This potential added value has been adequately substantiated when 
considering that not only a PK study has been performed in patients with renal impairment including 
haemodialysis but also a dedicated study in HCV infected patients with CKD 4-5 has been performed 
(EXPEDITION-4/M15-462). As recognized by the CHMP when granting the accelerated review, GLE/PIB 
could cover an unmet medical need, considering that sofosbuvir cannot be used in patients with renal 
impairment and that grazoprevir/elbasvir can only be used in patients with GT1 and GT4 with CKD. 
The clinical development also included several so-called “registrational” studies, as well as supportive 
studies. Among them, one was an active controlled open label study (ENDURANCE-3/M13-594) versus 
sofosbuvir-daclatasvir 12 weeks in GT3 treatment naïve non cirrhotic patients. 
Another study was double blind placebo controlled (ENDURANCE-2/ M15-464) in GT2 treatment naïve or 
treatment experienced non cirrhotic patients.  
Other studies were non-comparative open label studies targeting different patient populations according 
to genotype and testing different treatment duration (8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks).  
Overall, around 300 patients with compensated cirrhosis were included in the clinical development with 
notably one dedicated study in compensated cirrhotic patients with GT1, GT2, GT4, GT5 and GT6 
(EXPEDITION-1/M14-172). Based on PK and safety grounds this FDC is not recommended in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment and contra-indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. As a 
whole, NS3/4A inhibitors are likely not adequate candidates for treating patients with hepatic 
Assessment report

decompensation for PK reasons (plasma levels increase up to 10-fold). Nevertheless, in clinical practice 
other effective options may not be available. This is especially true for the management of GT3 patients 
with very limited therapeutic options.  
Prior treatment with PR or PRS is not an issue with regards to GLE or PIB resistance. However, such 
patients are still selected for other parameters that may have a negative impact on the likelihood of 
achieving SVR, regardless of the treatment chosen. On the basis of subgroup analyses by prior treatment 
experience (TN and TE-PRS) the claimed dosing regimen is the same for patients infected with HCV 
genotypes 1,2, 4-6, with or without such prior therapy (i.e. 8 weeks in non-cirrhotic patients and 12 
weeks in cirrhotic patients). For genotype-3 infected patients, the same durations are suggested for TN 
patients (i.e. 8 weeks in non-cirrhotic patients and 12 weeks in cirrhotic patients) while a prolonged 
duration of 16 weeks is suggested for those with prior failure on a PRS regimen, regardless of cirrhosis.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
GLE/PIB dosed 300/120 mg QD has been evaluated in a large number of patients (2369 in the phase 2/3 
safety population). 
Treatment durations of 8 and 12 weeks were studied in non-cirrhotic patients infected with genotypes 
1,2,4,5 and 6, with or without a prior treatment failure with peg-IFN + ribavirin. For these patients both 
durations were equally effective, virological failure rates being very low. Although this study population 
mainly concerned patients with very limited fibrosis (F0/F1), the numbers with F2/F3 treated for 8 weeks 
were deemed sufficient by CHMP to support the 8 week treatment duration in non-cirrhotic patients 
(throughout the range to F3 fibrosis), having the close to 100% SVR rate in mind. As expected, numbers 
treated with genotyped 4-6 is limited. However, not a single failure was seen in those treated, and the 
same treatment recommendation is supported by the in vitro data presented, as well as previous 
experiences of treating these genotypes. Of note, early viral kinetics was similar across genotypes, with 
close to 100 % of patients having unquantifiable HCV RNA at week 4. 
Cirrhotic patients (prior treatment failure with peg-IFN + ribavirin included) with the mentioned 
genotypes were treated for 12 weeks. Observed SVR rates were 99%, a single relapse occurred in a 
patient with genotype 1-infection, supporting 12 weeks of treatment for such patients. 
With such success rates, baseline polymorphisms in NS3 and NS5A targets did not have an impact on 
treatment outcomes in these patients. 
Previously untreated, patients with genotype-3 infection, without cirrhosis, were studied in a dedicated 
trial (ENDURANCE-3). GLE/PIB was compared to active control, sofosbuvir + daclatasvir, both given for 
12 weeks. Following an amendment, GLE/PIB for 8 weeks was also studied, restricted to non-cirrhotic 
patients. All three treatments yielded high SVR rates (95-96%). GLE/PIB for 12 weeks was non-inferior to 
control, and GLE/PIB for 8 weeks was non-inferior to GLE/PIB for 12 weeks. The 8 weeks treatment 
resulted in a numerically higher relapse rate (5/150, 3.3%) than did 12 weeks (3/222, 1.4%). However, 
the difference was limited and was non-significant, and CHMP agreed that the results can be considered 
supportive of 8 weeks treatment for non-cirrhotic, previously untreated patients with genotype 
3-infection. The simplicity of an 8 week regimen, regardless of the HCV genotype, is considered important 
as part of an programmatic approach for HCV eradication. Treatment-naïve cirrhotics were treated for 12 
weeks in SURVEYOR-II and EXPEDITION-4, resulting in an SVR rate of 64/65 (no virological failures), 
supporting that option for this population.  
Two more studies (SURVEYOR-II, EXPEDITION-4) included (in part) genotype-3 infected patients with or 
without cirrhosis and with or without prior treatment failure (IFN or peg-IFN +/-  ribavirin or sofosbuvir + 
ribavirin +/- peg-IFN). Twelve and 16 weeks of treatment were explored. For patients with prior

treatment failure, the 12 week treatment (only studied in non-cirrhotics) resulted in a numerically higher 
relapse rate (4/48, 8.3%) than did 16 weeks, which notably gave SVR in 48/51 treatment experienced 
patients with cirrhosis (those hardest to cure). The results support the conservative approach proposed 
by the applicant: a 16 week treatment duration of patients with prior failure to the mentioned treatments. 
For genotype-3 infected patients, an impact by a naturally occurring polymorphism in NS5A was seen. It 
concerns the presence of A30K, detected in 6% of baseline samples. When comparing the relapse rates in 
previously untreated, the relapse rate was numerically higher in those treated for 8 weeks than in those 
treated for 12 weeks (4/18 vs 1/14). However, taking into account the prevalence of the A30K mutation, 
the overall SVR rate with 8 weeks of treatment would be predicted to increase some single percent if the 
substitutions were screened for and such patients were excluded/treated longer. In summary, CHMP 
agreed that a general recommendation for the screening of baseline resistance in genotype-3 infected is 
not considered warranted. 
In addition to the above, a study was performed in patients who had failed prior treatment that included 
agents from one or both DAA classes of interest (NS3/4A and NS5A), around 30% had cirrhosis 
(MAGELLAN-1). The study overwhelmingly concerned genotype 1 infection (in addition 4 patients infected 
with genotype-4 infection), and genotype 3-infected patients were not included. Patients were treated for 
12 or 16 weeks. In those previously exposed to NS3/4A only (n=38) there were no virological failures; in 
those exposed to NS5A only (n=38) there were 3 failures, and in those exposed to both classes (n=37) 
there were 7 failures, without any interpretable difference between treatment arms (12 or 16 weeks). Of 
note, in those with dual class resistance, where key polymorphisms to NS3 and NS5A were detected at 
baseline samples, 5 out of 9 failed therapy. When looking at resistance at failure, advanced resistance to 
both classes was seen in the majority of patients. On the basis of these outcomes the company proposes 
that prior exposure to the NS3/4A class does not have to be accounted for, and that patients with prior 
exposure to NS5A, regardless genotype (genotype-3 infection included), may be recommended GLE/PIB 
therapy for 16 weeks. 
Patients with prior PI-experience, but naïve to the NS5A class did not have relevant NS3 mutations at 
baseline, as the time since prior therapy was considerable and resistance had generally reverted, and also 
since the linear PIs used in prior regimens primarily selects for key mutations not conferring cross 
resistance to glecaprevir. Thus, these patients may not be representative for the bulk of “PI experienced 
patients” eligible for re-treatment today and in the future.  
At present the main protease inhibitors of relevance would be paritaprevir and grazoprevir, which both 
may confer cross resistance to glecaprevir, which would be relevant if reversion has not yet taken place. 
Indeed, in patients with prior failure on a regimen including both NS3 and NS5A inhibitors, time since 
prior failure (i.e. the duration where NS3 resistance have time to revert to wild type) was shown to be an 
important factor, as anticipated. Thus, although PI-experienced, NS5A naïve, patients were successfully 
treated in MAGELLAN-1, prior NS3 failure cannot be disregarded if GLE/PIB would be used for retreatment 
in patients failing on the presently used first line regimens. It is a matter of what agents that were used 
(key mutations selected) and timing, and the likelihood of success would be based on guesswork without 
the use of resistance screening, unless a considerable time has passed since the prior treatment failure. 
The sample size of NS5A experienced, PI naïve patients is limited to 38 patients who mostly had genotype 
1a infection. The sample size is too small to generate a general resistance algorithm that can be 
adequately used to predict treatment failure. Those failing this re-treatment end up with advanced dual 
class resistance, including high level resistance to pibrentasvir, which is likely the present NS5A inhibitor 
for which the least impact of common viral variability or resistance mutations on potency is seen.

Notably, 32% (6/19) of the GT1-infected subjects previously treated with ombitasvir and paritaprevir ± 
dasabuvir [i.e. Viekirax/Exviera, one of the standard regimens use in the EU) had resistance-associated 
substitutions in both virological targets at the time of enrolment in MAGELLAN-1. As double class 
resistance was associated with a suboptimal outcome, this indicates that GLE/PIB is not a suitable 
regimen for the re-treatment of such patients, in particular as a resistance testing algorithm that can be 
used to guide therapy is not available.  
In the subset of double class experienced patients, GLE/PIB therapy seemed to cure all patients with a 
baseline virus that lacked NS3 resistance. However, some NS5A experienced, but PI naïve patients 
(without NS3 key mutations) also failed therapy. Hence, screening for NS3 class resistance is not a 
sufficient tool to decide which of these vulnerable patients would be better of receiving an optimised 
retreatment regimen including sofosbuvir. 
In summary, the sample size of MAGELLAN-1 is not large enough to derive a resistance algorithm that can 
adequately predict what genotype-1 infected patients may use GLE/PIB as a retreatment regimen. 
Further, the limited data available only concern genotype 1-infection; data is lacking for other genotypes 
and an extrapolation is not considered possible. Given the accumulation of resistance seen in case of 
failure with GLE/PIB retreatment, GLE/PIB is currently not considered an adequate re-treatment option 
for patients with prior failure on a regimen that included the NS3 or NS5A class.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Of particular interest this FDC comprises two pangenotypic components with high potency and high 
genetic barrier. In the HCV GT1-infected population (the most widely represented in the EU) the observed 
results -with 99% SVR12 achieved with a convenient 8 weeks treatment duration in non-cirrhotic TN or 
TE-PRS patients and 97% in cirrhotic patients with a 12 weeks treatment duration- support the fact that 
this FDC will represent an optimization in the therapeutic armamentarium. 
As part of the response to CHMP questions throughout the assessment, some clarifications and some 
additional data from ongoing studies (EXPEDITION-2 notably) were provided by the applicant in support 
of the efficacy of the product. CHMP thus acknowledged that the applicant’s proposal for a treatment 
recommendation could overall be followed in DAA treatment naïve patients, having in mind the possibility 
of bridging efficacy from GT1 based on comparable in vitro activity leading to favour a simplified regimen 
for a programmatic approach to HCV eradication (targeted by 2030 by WHO). 
Nevertheless, CHMP noted that since the clinical development has been built mainly to promote the use of 
this dual therapy in first line treatment rather than in retreatment, the limited sample sized MAGELLAN-1 
study (without GT3 patients) in DAA TE leaves many uncertainties for the use of this dual therapy in 
patients failing DAA. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
For the evaluation of the safety data, the applicant used three analysis sets: 
- 
Placebo-controlled analysis set using safety data from study M15-464 (ENDURANCE-2), a 
double blind, placebo-controlled study in HCV GT2-infected subjects without cirrhosis comparing GLE/PIB 
300mg/120mg versus placebo for 12 weeks (GLE/PIB n= 202, PLA n= 100). 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 103/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
Active-controlled analysis set using safety data from study M13-594 (ENDURANCE-3), an 
open-label, active-controlled study in HCV GT3-infected subjects without cirrhosis comparing GLE/PIB 
300mg/120mg with SOF+ DCV for 8 or 12 weeks  (GLE/PIB n= 390, SOF+DCV n=115). 
- 
Phase 2 and 3 analysis set using safety data from all subjects (n= 2, 369) in the 21 arms of the 
Phase 2 and 3 studies who received at least 1 dose of a co-administered or co-formulated GLE 300 mg QD 
and PIB 120 mg QD, without RBV (N = 2,369).  This analysis set includes subjects with compensated liver 
disease and/or with or without CKD Stages 4 – 5 (Study M15-462).  
In the summary of the clinical safety, the Phase 2 and 3 analysis set was primarily presented excluding 
study in patients with renal impairment (M15-462) corresponding to a total 2265 patients. Safety data 
derived from the 104 patients in study M15-462 were presented and discussed separately, which is 
acceptable. A summary of the main safety data derived from other Phase 2 studies not included in the 
Phase 2 and 3 analysis set was also provided.  
Overall, a total of 2, 369 HCV-infected adult subjects received the fixed dose combination GLE/PIB or 
co-administered GLE and PIB at the dose of 300mg/120mg once daily. Excluding the 104 subjects with 
CKD in study M15-462 that are discussed separately in the summary of clinical safety, the Phase 2 and 3 
analysis set comprise a total of 2,265 patients, which is consistent with the ICH recommendations to 
assess the safety profile of the drug and to detect the most commonly reported adverse drug reactions. 
Among those, 850 subjects were assigned for 8- week treatment duration (37.5%), 1295 subjects 
assigned for 12 weeks treatment duration (57.2%) and 120 subjects were assigned for 16 weeks (5.3%).  
A total of 288 patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child Pugh A) were included in the Phase 2-3 program. 
The safety of GLE/PIB in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment was not assessed in the 
clinical development program. At this stage only a few patients are co-infected with HIV-1 (n=33). 
Adverse events 
The safety profile of GLE/PIB is overall good with few severe AEs or serious AEs reported respectively in 
2.9% and 2.1% of subjects in the Phase 2 and 3 analysis set. There was no obvious difference in the 
percentages of subjects with any AE and any drug-related AEs with placebo and active comparator arm 
(SOF/DCV) in the placebo or active controlled studies. Few subjects (0.4%) discontinued study drugs due 
to AEs.

Adverse events reported with GLE/PIB were generally of mild intensity, and did not lead to study drug 
discontinuation. Of note, one subject with history of angiotectasia in the jejunum and episodes of 
gastro-intestinal bleeding experienced an event of diarrhoea with positive re-challenge of GLE/PIB in 
study M15-642. Furthermore, two subjects discontinued GLE/PIB due to gastrointestinal disorders 
(dyspepsia for one, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain for the second), with positive de-challenge and 
with a drug causality suspected by the investigator.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
A total of seven deaths were reported in the Phase 2 and 3 analysis set, including one death in study 
M15-462. Two other deaths were reported in the Phase 2 clinical studies not included in the Phase 2 and 
3 analysis set since subjects received other dosing regimens of GLE and PIB than the final recommended. 
All occurred in the post-treatment period and were considered as not related to study drug:

c.  Preferred terms reported as having an outcome of death. 
Of note, autopsy report available in the DSUR confirmed acute ethanol and combined methadone toxicity 
for the cause of death. 
In the Phase 2 and 3 analysis set (excluding safety data from study M15-462), a total of 48 patients 
(2.1%) experienced at least one SAE.  
The reported SAEs concerned mostly the system organ class (SOCs), neoplasms, infections and 
infestations and the SOC injury poisoning and procedural complications. No specific pattern in the type of 
SAEs was evidenced.  Only one SAE was considered as related to study drug: a SAE of transient ischemic 
attacks occurring on treatment Day 11 and later post-treatment 24. The patient’s medical history 
comprises obesity, smoking, and cardiac conduction abnormality that are known risk factors for TIA. No 
similar cases were reported in the dossier.  
Six subjects (0.3%) experienced an event of de novo HCC. All cases were evidenced during treatment or 
within 4 months post-treatment and did not seem concurrent to GLE/PIB virological failure. The case of 
aggressive metastatic hepatic cancer with fatal outcome reported in a non-cirrhotic subject is worth being 
noted. As part of the D90 RSI, it was stated to the applicant that the PRAC conclusions on article 20 
referral procedure regarding the risk of recurrent and de novo HCC for all DAA containing products also 
applies to the RMP for GLE/PIB.  
One non-serious case met the criteria for potential cases of hepatotoxicity. This subject had elevations of 
ALT > 5N and concomitant Grade 2 total bilirubin increased that were all evidenced at Day 87, one day 
after ending 12 weeks of treatment. The review of the laboratory findings for this patient, and the 
presence of gallstones seen by ultrasound several days later are rather in favor of the result of a transient 
obstructive pattern than a drug-induced liver toxicity. 
Laboratory findings 
The rate of Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities including liver function tests was low in the Phase 2-3 
analysis sets and no major signal was identified.  
ALT elevations

Asymptomatic Grade 3 ALT elevations were reported in Phase 1 studies among healthy subjects who 
received higher doses of GLE. ALT elevations were also reported in DDI studies with atazanavir/ritonavir 
and with ethinyl-estradiol containing oral contraceptives. 
In the Phase 2 and 3 analysis set, as expected with the clearance of viral HCV infection, an improvement 
from baseline in ALT values was observed with GLE/PIB compared with placebo. Only, four subjects had 
potentially clinically relevant ALT elevations defined as follows: 
Criteria 
ALT > 5 x ULN and > 2 x baseline 
ALT > 3 x ULN (Grade 2+ and increase 
from nadir grade) and total bilirubin > 2 x 
ULN

One subject was previously presented. The remaining three Grade 3 ALT elevations were transient and 
occurred in a context of an overall improving ALT trend with antiviral treatment and are not indicative of 
a direct drug-induced liver toxicity.  No Grade 4 ALT elevations were reported in the Phase 2 and 3 
analysis set. 
Overall, ALT elevations are low in patients receiving GLE/PIB 300mg/120mg in the Phase 2 and 3 clinical 
studies and did not seem clinically relevant. However, safety data from Phase 1 studies with higher GLE 
exposures in healthy subjects or in combination with atazanavir or ethinyl-estradiol containing products 
in the DDI studies lead to consider that GLE/PIB would not be devoid of any hepatic risk in some situations 
that could be met in the real-life setting. 
Bilirubin elevations 
The proportion of Grade 1, Grade 2 and Grade 3 bilirubin elevations in the Phase 2 and 3 analysis set was 
6.8%, 2.3% and 0.4% respectively. No Grade 4 value was reported.  
In the placebo and active controlled studies, more patients experienced Grade 1-3 hyperbilirubinemia in 
GLE/PIB 12weeks arm than in the comparator arm ( i.e 7.2% versus 2.6% in the active –controlled study 
and 11.8% versus 4% in the placebo controlled study). The majority of bilirubin elevations were linked to 
elevation in indirect fraction of bilirubin in relation to the GLE-induced inhibition of bilirubin metabolism. 
These elevations are generally transient and asymptomatic. Few subjects (n=7, 0,3%) had direct 
hyperbilirubinemia. Two of them had also concomitant ALT elevations, and those cases were not 
indicative of the role of the study drugs. None of patients with hyperbilirubinemia experienced AEs such 
as jaundice, ocular icterus or laboratory or clinical events suggestive of liver failure. Despite no major 
safety was highlighted from these data, a statement on the risk of hyperbilirubinemia in patients receiving 
GLE/PIB is added in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Comparison with other previously authorized NS3/4A protease inhibitors  
As shown in the table below, the hepatic risk of GLE/PIB seems overall lower than that previously 
described with previously authorized NS3/4A protease inhibitors. This is somewhat mitigated by the fact 
EE-based regimens were prohibited during Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, placing thus GLE/PIB in the best 
case scenario as compared with Viekirax.

Safety in special populations 
Safety in patients with chronic kidney disease (n=104) 
In the study, 26.9% of subjects were > 65 years and BMI was > 30kg/m2 in 24% of subjects. A history 
of cardiovascular disease was reported in 89.4% of patients (coronary artery disease in 12.5% and/or a 
history of hypertension in 85.6%). A history of diabetes was reported in 41.3% of subjects.  
Except pruritus that is known to be more commonly reported in CKD subjects on haemodialysis, the 
distribution of AEs in GLE/PIB treated subjects with CKD is similar to that observed in non CKD subjects. 
No subjects met criteria for potential hepatotoxicity based on results for a single laboratory parameter 
(ALT or total bilirubin) or based on results for both ALT and total bilirubin. In relation with the underlying 
comorbidities in this population of patients, notably hypertension and cardiomyopathy, a higher rate of 
cardiovascular AEs is reported, some of them with suggestive chronology with study drug, without a 
causal association can be confirmed. Specific attention should be paid on these issues in the post 
marketing setting.

In the Phase 2 and 3 Analysis Set (excluding Study M15-462), 288 (12.7%) subjects with cirrhosis were 
included. The percentage of patients with any SAE or Grade 3 AEs is higher in patients with cirrhosis 
(5.9% and 6.9%) compared to non-cirrhotic patients (1.6% and 2.3%). However, none of SAE and 
severe AE reported in patients with cirrhosis were judged as potentially related to study drugs by the 
investigator. Fatigue, diarrhoea and pruritus were reported in greater frequency in patients with 
compensated cirrhosis (Child Pugh A). For laboratory abnormalities, more cirrhotic subjects had Grade 
3-4 decreased platelets, total bilirubin increased and hyperglycemia. However, the differences observed 
do not seem clinically meaningful. Otherwise there was no reliable difference in the incidence and the 
pattern of AEs reported in cirrhotic patients compared with non-cirrhotic patients.

HIV coinfection 
In Study M13-590, HCV/ HIV co-infected subjects were eligible and 33 were enrolled. No formal 
conclusion can be reached on the safety profile of GLE/PIB in patients with HIV/HCV co-infection due to 
the small number of patients enrolled. However, it is agreed that the limited data do not raise particular 
concern. 
A dedicated study M14-730 in HCV-infected subjects who are co-infected with HIV-1 is ongoing 
(approximately 160 subjects were planned). This study will provide further safety information in this 
specific population of patients. 
Influence of intrinsic factors (age, gender, race, BMI) 
No major of influence of age, gender, race/ethnicity and BMI was observed when regarding the type and 
the incidence of adverse events and the description of laboratory abnormalities reported in the Phase 2 
and 3 analysis set. A greater percentage of subjects ≥ 65 years of age experienced any SAE (7.3% versus 
2.4%) and any AE of Grade ≥ 3 (7.3% versus 3.2%) compared with younger subjects. This was 
apparently driven by the data of study M15-462 where a higher percentage of subjects > 65 years of age 
and a higher rate of comorbidities were reported compared with in other studies. Similarly, a higher 
proportion if black subjects experienced any SAE (7.1% vs 2.8%) and any severe AE (7.1% versus 3.6%) 
compared with non-black subjects, this seems again driven by a greater rate of black subjects in the study 
with CKD with higher rate of comorbidities. Otherwise, no trend was observed for the pattern of reported 
AEs and the Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities. 
Immunological events  
Immunological events were not specifically discussed by the applicant. There was no evidence towards a 
significant risk of hypersensitivity reactions with GLE/PIB.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the Phase 2 and 3 Analysis Set, 0.4% of subjects (n=8) discontinued study drug due to any AE. In the 
Phase 2 and 3 analysis set, 8 patients (0,4%) stopped study drug due to adverse events. Among these, 
three were considered as related to GLE/PIB by the investigator. In other Phase 2 studies not included in 
the analysis set, two additional subjects reported AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study 
drugs including one case in which relatedness with GLE/PIB was suspected by the investigator. Among the 
ten subjects who stopped study drugs, three stopped due to neoplasm, none of them were considered 
linked to the DAA. Among the four cases where a causal relationship with study drugs was suspected by 
the investigator, three described gastro-abdominal disorders (abdominal pain, dyspepsia, diarrhoea) that 
resolved after treatment was stopped. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database for this application includes a total of 2369 HCV-infected adult subjects who received 
the intended recommended dose of GLE/PIB 300mg/120mg once daily, including 1295 subjects who 
received 12 weeks of treatment duration. This is in line with ICH recommendations in terms of required 
patient exposure.  
Among 2369 subjects who received GLE/PIB 300mg/120mg QD in the clinical development program, 104 
patients had severe renal impairment, the majority under haemodialysis (study M15-462), and a total of 
308 were cirrhotic patients. Safety of GLE/PIB in subjects with CKD was assessed separately.  Subjects 
with decompensated Child Pugh B or C cirrhosis were not included in the program, and no further studies 
are planned for such patients. 
The safety profile of GLE/PIB is overall favourable with few severe AEs or serious AEs, reported in 2.9% 
and 2.1%, respectively (phase 2 and 3 analysis set, excluding subjects with CKD). Only four Grade 3 and 
1 SAE were considered related to study drugs by the investigator, with no specific pattern identified. Few 
patients discontinued the study drug due to AEs (0.4%). The most commonly adverse drug reactions 
reported in the Phase 2 and 3 analysis set were fatigue, headache and gastrointestinal disorders such as 
diarrhoea and nausea. These adverse reactions are included in section 4.8 of the Maviret SmPC and 
reflected in the package leaflet. 
The safety profile of GLE/PIB was similar in patients with compensated cirrhosis and in non-cirrhotic 
subjects, in patients with severe renal impairment and/or haemodialysis, except a higher rate of pruritus 
(which is not unexpected in patients under haemodialysis). The overall safety profile did not strictly differ 
from the rest of the population with normal renal function. However, in line with underlying comorbidities 
in this population of patients, notably hypertension and cardiomyopathy, a higher rate of cardiovascular 
AEs was reported in this population, some of them with suggestive chronology with study drug. A causal 
association cannot be confirmed, but specific attention should be paid on this issue in the post-marketing 
setting. 
A total of seven deaths were reported during the phase 2 and 3 clinical studies with GLE/PIB 
300mg/120mg once daily. All deaths occurred during the post-treatment period and none was considered 
related to study drug. The diagnosis of a rapidly aggressive hepatic cancer with metastasis leading to 
death 2.5 months after the end of antiviral therapy in one patient without cirrhosis is worth being noted. 
It was concluded that the impact of DAAs treatment on the incidence and type of de novo HCC warrants 
further investigations, through a prospective cohort study in HCV-infected patients. A joint study 
involving all MAHs was encouraged.  
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 111/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The rate of de novo HCC was 0.3% (6/2369) in the clinical development program and 1.7% (5/288) in 
patients with cirrhosis, which is in the range of the expected incidence of HCC in this population of 
patients. Since patients with a history of HCC were not included in the studies, no recurrence rates of HCC 
could be reported. Similarly, no cases of HBV reactivation were observed, since HBV/HCV co-infected 
cases were not allowed to be enrolled in the studies. The class labelling agreed by the PRAC on the latter 
issue is included in section 4.4 of the Maviret SmPC. Furthermore, the PRAC conclusions regarding the 
HCV DAA article 20 referral procedure on HCC recurrence and de novo and on HBV reactivation are 
adequately reflected in the RMP of GLE/PIB. 
With regard to laboratory abnormalities, no signal is identified, with low percentages of Grade 3-4 
abnormalities for all laboratory values identified. The rate of Grade 3 ALT elevations (>5 XULN) in the 
phase 2-3 analysis set was 0.1% (n=3). There were no Grade 4 ALT values. One patient met the criteria 
of potential cases of hepatotoxicity with elevations of ALT > 5N and concomitant Grade 2 total bilirubin 
increased that were evidenced at Day 87, one day after 12 weeks of treatment. The review of the 
laboratory findings for this patient, and the presence of gallstones seen by ultrasound several days later 
are in favour of a transient obstructive pattern rather than a drug-induced liver toxicity as etiology of the 
ALT and total bilirubin elevations. Other Grade 3 ALT elevations are not indicative of drug causality. No 
monitoring is mandated on the basis of these findings.  
Bilirubin elevations with potential clinical interest were reported in 1.2% of patients in the phase 2 -3 
analysis set, the majority of them of indirect predominance in relation to the known inhibition of bilirubin 
metabolism induced by GLE. Seven subjects (0.3%) reported bilirubin elevations with direct or mixed 
predominance, none of them describing a serious pattern. Nevertheless, physicians are informed about 
the potential for bilirubin elevations through a statement added in section 4.8 of the Maviret SmPC. 
Overall, data available from the phase 2 and 3 clinical studies are quite reassuring as regards the risk of 
ALT elevations that seems overall lower than that seen with previous NS3/4A protease inhibitor and 
without clinical significance. However, safety data from phase 1 studies with higher GLE exposures in 
healthy subjects or in some DDI studies with atazanavir and ethinyl-estradiol containing products lead to 
the consideration that GLE/PIB would not be totally devoid of any hepatic risk in some situations that 
could be met in the real life setting. Due to substantially higher GLE exposures yielded by co-treatment 
with atazanavir/r, and ALT elevations reported in healthy subjects with this combination, CHMP agreed 
that such co-administration is rightly contraindicated in the Maviret SmPC. Further, due to ALT elevations 
reported in patients treated with ethinyl estradiol (EE) in a DDI study on oral contraceptives, 
EE-containing regimens were prohibited medications in the Phase 2-3 clinical trials and no further clinical 
data were gained with this combination. A potential increased risk of clinically significant ALT elevations 
or even hepatotoxicity in female patients receiving EE-based oral contraception cannot therefore be ruled 
out in real life setting. Consequently, CHMP agreed that EE-containing medications are contra-indicated in 
the SmPC of Maviret. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of Maviret (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) is favourable with no major concern identified. 
While the risk of ALT elevations seems lower as compared to previously authorized NS3/4A, it remains 
that some situations (namely in case of combination with EE-based regimens) have been identified at 
increased hepatic risk. This has been appropriately covered in the Maviret SmPC by the addition of a 
contra-indication with EE-containing medicines.

Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The new EURD list entry will use the EBD (which is also 
the international birth date (IBD)) to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substances 
The applicant compared the structures of glecaprevir and that of pibrentasvir with active substances 
contained in authorised medicinal products in the European Union and declared that they are not salts, 
esters, ethers, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes or derivatives of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers glecaprevir and pibrentasvir to be new active 
substances as they are not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Maviret (glecaprevir / pibrentasvir) is included 
in the additional monitoring list as it includes two new active substances.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Glecaprevir-pibrentasvir is new fixed dose combination for the treatment of adult patients with chronic 
hepatitis C. Natural history of HCV infection is a continuum that goes worsening over approximatively 20 
years and evolves from minimal liver fibrosis (F0-F1) to compensated and then to decompensated 
cirrhosis (F4, Child Pugh C) and/or hepatocarcinoma. HCV is the main cause of liver transplant. There are 
6 major different HCV viral genotypes, GT1 to GT6 with different subtypes and with a different 
geographical repartition. Genotype 1 is the most prevalent in Europe, accounting for 70% of chronically 
infected Europeans, with GT1b subtype predominating over GT1a in most European countries including 
those with the highest prevalence. Genotype 3 is the next most common genotype in Europe. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
After almost 20 years with the bi-therapy with (Peg-)IFN+ Ribavirin (PR) and then with the first 
generation of Direct Antiviral Agents (DAA), boceprevir and telaprevir (two NS3/4A protease inhibitors 
that were still to be used with PR and had concerning tolerance profile)  major advances have been made 
in the management of chronic HCV infection.   
Several other DAA are now approved in the EU, within the three existing pharmacological classes: NS5B 
inhibitors (sofosbuvir, dasabuvir), NS5A inhibitors (daclatasvir, ledipasvir, ombitasvir, elbasvir, 
velpatasvir), NS3/4A inhibitors (simeprevir, grazoprevir, paritaprevir). These DAAs are now part of 
various IFN free regimens. Given its antiviral activity and its high genetic barrier, a sofosbuvir-containing 
DAA regimen is the most widely currently used IFN free regimen. Thanks to these new agents/regimens, 
SVR rates >90% can be achieved in most patients. 
Difficult-to-treat patients are cirrhotic patients who may require intensified regimens, with a longer 
treatment duration or addition of ribavirin. Moreover, in patients experiencing virologic failure the 
likelihood of a successful rescue is dependent on the accumulated resistance (RAS) that may persist long 
term. To this purpose, while NS3/4A RAS can reverse to wild type after sufficient time and while signature 
mutation to the NS5B inhibitor sofosbuvir (S282T) is rare, NS5A RAS are much more challenging, as it 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 117/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
would appear that  they tend to persist. In particular, the likelihood of the virologic response of HCV GT3 
to treatment is compromised by the presence of the Y93H mutation with current NS5A inhibitors. GT3 as 
a whole and especially NS5A experienced HCV GT3-infected patients has become the most 
difficult-to-treat population. 
This new FDC comprises two pan-genotypic components. In December 2016 the CHMP has considered 
that this FDC has the potential to respond to an unmet medical need and to represent a significant 
advance for the therapeutic management of patients in case its benefit-risk balance would be concluded 
positive, and thus agreed with the applicant’s request for an accelerated review. 
From a public health perspective there is a need for regimens that can be administered with the same 
simple posology regardless of the HCV genotype and of the cirrhosis status (which is currently not the 
case with available DAA), in order to enable hepatitis C treatment to be handled quickly and easily in order 
to have a meaningful impact on the HCV epidemiology. Indeed, the 2014 World Health Assembly 
requested the World Health Organization (WHO) to examine the feasibility of eliminating hepatitis B and 
C, and the 2015 Agenda for Sustainable Development commits to combating viral hepatitis with a goal of 
eradicating hepatitis B and C by 2030. Effective and simple treatment of HCV (and HBV) infection is an 
important part of achieving that goal. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
As illustrated in the following table, the Maviret clinical development program covers all the 6 major HCV 
genotypes GT1-6 and includes efficacy and safety data from 8 registrational studies and 3 supportive 
Phase 2 studies that were conducted in various populations and tested different treatment durations (8 
weeks (short term treatment in non-cirrhotic patients), 12 weeks, 16 weeks). The non-inferiority 
hypothesis was tested to compare 8 vs 12 weeks of treatment in non-cirrhotic patients (-5% in 
ENDURANCE-1/M13-590, -6% in ENDURANCE-3 study/M13-594), while the comparison of 12 versus 16 
weeks of treatment was made with only descriptive statistics. 
Overall around 2300 patients were enrolled in the clinical development.

The main studies were conducted in non-cirrhotic treatment-naive patients or patients having failed 
previous treatment with PegIFN+ribavirin (PR), including some patients with previous treatment with 
PR+ sofosbuvir (PRS). Those are mainly the ENDURANCE studies (ENDURANCE-1 in GT1, ENDURANCE-2 
in GT2, ENDURANCE-3 in GT3, ENDURANCE-4 in GTs 4-6) together with the SURVEYOR studies 
(SURVEYOR I and II) that complete the ENDURANCE studies to some extent. 
One study was an active controlled open label non-inferiority (margin -6%) study (ENDURANCE-3/ 
M13-594) versus sofosbuvir-daclatasvir 12 weeks in GT3 treatment naïve non cirrhotic patients. 
Another study was double blind placebo controlled (ENDURANCE-2/ M15-464) and was conducted in HCV 
GT2 treatment naïve or TE-PRS non cirrhotic patients.  
A study of limited size (identified by the applicant as supportive) was performed in DAA treatment 
experienced patients (almost exclusively GT1, in addition four GT4 subjects), the MAGELLAN-1 
(M15-410) study. Some HIV co-infected patients were also included in the Maviret development 
programme and a dedicated study is ongoing in this population (EXPEDITION-2). 
Overall, around 300 compensated cirrhotic patients were included in the Maviret clinical development 
with notably one dedicated study in compensated cirrhotic patients with GT1, GT2, GT4, GT5 and GT6 
(EXPEDITION-1/M14-172). Based on PK and safety grounds this FDC is not recommended in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment and contra-indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Moreover, 
it is acknowledged that as a whole NS3/4A are not adequate candidates for treating patients with hepatic 
decompensation due to the risk of worsening the liver disease.  
Finally a dedicated study was performed in patients with CKD 4-5 (EXPEDITION-4/M15-462).  
Apart from the double blind placebo controlled study (ENDURANCE-2), all studies are open label studies.  
The standard Sustained Virologic Response 12 weeks after end of treatment (SVR12) was the primary 
endpoint.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Of particular interest, Maviret comprises two components of pan-genotypic activity.  
Notably, in contrast to previous protease inhibitors, glecaprevir has important potency against GT 2 and 
GT3. 
Pibrentasvir appears similarly highly potent (picomolar activity) in all HCV genotypes. As a significant 
improvement as compared to other NS5A available, PIB is the first NS5A inhibitor with a conserved 
activity against viral strains containing the Y93H mutation (no impact in GT3 and GT1b and 7-fold reduced 
activity in GT1a). Having in mind the fact that the presence of Y93H at baseline is the main reason for 
lower response rates seen in GT3 patients treated with current NS5A inhibitors, and that this mutation is 
selected in case of NS5A failure in GT3 population, the antiviral activity of PIB against Y93H HCV strains 
makes Maviret of potential interest for this difficult to treat population.  
In the HCV GT1 population, the genotype most widely represented in the EU, the results observed in TN 
or TE-PRS patients, with 99% SVR12 achieved with a convenient 8 weeks treatment duration in 
non-cirrhotic patients and 97% in cirrhotic patients with a 12 weeks treatment duration without need for 
ribavirin, are supportive of the fact that this FDC will likely represent an optimization in the therapeutic 
armamentarium. Similar results, regardless of the prior PRS failure, were obtained in patients infected 
with HCV genotypes 2 and 4-6.  
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 119/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In TN HCV GT3-infected patients, the 8 weeks treatment resulted in a numerically higher relapse rate 
(5/150, 3.3%) than did the 12 weeks treatment arm (3/222, 1.4%). However, CHMP agreed that the 
difference can be seen as non-significant, and that the results are considered supportive of 8 weeks 
treatment for non-cirrhotic, previously untreated patients with HCV genotype 3-infection. CHMP also 
noted that the simplicity of an 8 week regimen, and the same treatment duration in previously untreated 
patients, regardless of the HCV genotype, is also considered an important part of a programmatic 
approach for HCV eradication (targeted by 2030 by WHO). 
Moreover, in line with the marginal renal elimination and the PK study in patients with renal impairment, 
the dedicated phase III study in GT1-6-infected patients with CKD stage 4 or 5 (EXPEDITION-4) has 
shown that GLE/PIB could adequately cover an unmet medical need for these patients. Indeed, in this 
study with around 82% of patients undergoing dialysis, a high SVR12 rate was achieved [98.1% 
(102/104)]. 
In MAGELLAN-1 (in practice concerning genotype 1-infection), 12 or 16 weeks of Maviret was given to 
patients who had failed prior treatment that included agents from one or both DAA classes of interest 
(NS3/4A and NS5A), of which around 30% had cirrhosis. In those exposed to NS3/4A only (n=38) there 
were no virological failures, likely because resistant virus selected by prior therapy had reverted to wild 
type virus prior to study entry. In those exposed to NS5A only (n=38) 3 failures were seen, and in those 
exposed to both classes (n=37) 7 failures, without an interpretable difference between arms (12 or 16 
weeks). Of note, for the latter group where key polymorphisms to NS3 and NS5A were detected at 
baseline samples, 5 out of 9 patients failed therapy.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The evaluation of 8 versus 12 weeks of therapy (for the non-cirrhotic population) to a very large extent 
concerned patients with very limited fibrosis (F0/F1), with limited numbers having more severe fibrosis 
(F2/F3), i.e. those patients who may have a higher risk for relapse with shorter treatment duration. 
However, the numbers with F2/F3 treated for 8 weeks are still deemed sufficient by CHMP to support the 
8 week treatment duration in non-cirrhotic patients (throughout the range to F3 fibrosis), having the close 
to 100% cure rate in mind.  
As expected, numbers treated with infections with HCV genotypes 4-6 are also limited. However, not a 
single failure was seen in those treated, and the same treatment recommendation is also supported by 
the in vitro data presented. Of note, early viral kinetics was similar across genotypes, with close to 100 % 
of patients having unquantifiable HCV RNA at week 4.  
For patients with prior exposure to the NS3/4A and or NS5A class, an overall limited population, CHMP 
agreed that the results obtained in the small MAGELLAN-1 study should be interpreted cautiously. Since 
cross-resistance between classes are seen, it was shown that the outcome with GLE/PIB re-treatment 
depends on what prior regimen the patients failed on, and for the NS3/4A class, on how much time has 
passed since the administration of that failing treatment. Due to the limited sample size, it is not possible 
to generate a relevant resistance testing algorithm to select patients for whom retreatment with GLE/PIB 
is appropriate. Furthermore, there is uncertainty about the impact of the additional resistance generally 
incurred in case of retreatment failure. Importantly, the study did not include genotype 3-infected 
patients with prior failure to sofosbuvir + an NS5A inhibitor. Although pibrentasvir seems fully active to 
genotype-3 virus with the key mutation typically seen at failure with other NS5A inhibitors (Y93H), it is 
still not certain that the in vivo response would be as expected (taking other potential amino acid 
substitutions into account).

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of GLE/PIB has been assessed in a large population of HCV-infected subjects including 
patients with severe renal impairment or under haemodialysis and patients with cirrhosis. The total 
number of exposed HCV-infected subjects to the dosing regimen of GLE/PIB 300mg/120mg once daily is 
considered acceptable by CHMP. 
No major safety concern was identified in the Maviret clinical development program. Besides fatigue, 
which is a very common AE reported in the core population, the safety profile of GLE/PIB is mainly marked 
by non-serious gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions, notably diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal 
distension or pain. Despite they were of mild intensity and that they generally did not lead to drug 
discontinuation, these ADRs were overall reported more commonly in patients receiving GLE/PIB than 
placebo in the placebo-controlled study ENDURANCE-2 (M15-464). 
Severe bilirubin elevations (Grade 3-4), the majority of them with indirect predominance (in relation to 
the impact of GLE on bilirubin metabolism) have been reported in 1.2% of subjects in the phase 2- 3 
analysis set. While the rate of hyperbilirubinemia of mixed or direct origin was low and was not describing 
a serious pattern, CHMP deemed important that this was underlined in the Maviret SmPC. 
While ALT elevations have been seen in healthy subjects that received higher doses of GLE, but also in 
drug-drug interactions studies with atazanavir on the one hand and with ethinyl-oestradiol containing 
medications on the other hand, CHMP agreed that the clinical data derived from the phase 2-3 analysis set 
were not indicative of a risk of clinically significant ALT elevations with Maviret. 
As an increase of GLE exposure was expected to be > 10-fold in subjects with severe liver impairment 
(Child-Pugh C), thus exceeding the safety margin, the use of GLE/PIB has been contra-indicated in this 
population of patients. The use of GLE/PIB in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment is not 
recommended, as GLE exposures are expected to double in these subjects. 
Finally, the main unfavourable effect is the risk for development of double class resistance, which is seen 
in a high proportion of the few patients failing therapy. For patients already carrying viruses with 
resistance to the NS3 and NS5A class (MAGELLAN-1), further resistance developed, resulting in viruses 
that would seem hard to cure with available DAA options. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
A potential risk of higher incidence of de novo and recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma in DAA-treated 
subjects has emerged in the literature and has extensively been discussed at the PRAC level as part of an  
Article 20 referral. Further studies have been requested by PRAC to investigate this potential risk and 
changes in the RMP for all concerned DAA-containing medicinal products have consequently been 
requested. This request also applies for Maviret since it is not expected that the impact of GLE/PIB-based 
therapy would diverge from the other DAA for this issue. 
In the clinical development program of Maviret, six cases of HCC were collected (0.3%).  
Hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure have been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients 
with advanced liver disease receiving already authorized NS3/4A protease inhibitors containing products. 
The GLE/PIB program did not contain patients with decompensated cirrhosis (Child Pugh B/C). In such 
patients the exposure of GLE is increased (around a factor 5 in Child Pugh B, yet much higher in Child 
Pugh C), whereas PIB exposure is not affected. CHMP noted that GLE/PIB is “not recommended” for the 
treatment of Child Pugh B patients, but such patients may still be treated (for example in case of also 
having renal impairment). It is unknown whether the safety profile is impacted in such patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 121/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Initially, the applicant proposed to not recommend the combination of GLE/PIB with EE-containing 
products in the Maviret SmPC. However, given the risk of ALT elevations identified in the drug-drug 
interaction study, strongly indicating a drug-induced pattern, and the fact that no clinical data have been 
gained with such a combination in the clinical program (EE-containing medications were disallowed), a 
more conservative approach has been taken and CHMP asked that a contra-indication is added in section 
4.3. 
Overall, the occurrence of serious hepatic events in the real life setting notably in patients cumulating 
several risk factors or DDI cannot be excluded and should be closely monitored within PSURs.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
GLE/PIB provides a simple, highly effective and well tolerated pan-genotypic regimen. For the main bulk 
of patients to be treated in the future, namely non-cirrhotics without prior therapy, particular advantages 
are seen, since genotyping is not necessary, and a treatment of 8 weeks is sufficient. Therapy for 12 
weeks yielded excellent results, without the use of ribavirin, in the cirrhotic previously untreated patients. 
Patients with severe renal impairment and infected with HCV genotypes other than 1 and 4, are currently 
lacking treatment alternatives, as an appropriate dosing regimen for sofosbuvir has not been determined, 
and, furthermore, those infected with genotype 1a may need ribavirin as part of available regimens. 
Ribavirin is problematic to give to such patients, both due to a considerable impact on pharmacokinetics, 
as well as due to its haematological side effect, to which patients with renal insufficiency are more 
susceptible. For these patients GLE/PIB is an important new regimen, which can be given without dose 
adjustments, without ribavirin, and with the same efficacy and safety as in other patients.  
Patients still to be treated, and with prior failure to peg-IFN + ribavirin, is a population of diminishing size. 
In practice this mainly concern patients with genotype 1-infection (poor response rates to such therapy), 
and many of them have already been successfully treated with other new DAA regimens. For genotype-1 
infected patients, GLE/PIB given for 8 weeks or 12 weeks (when cirrhosis is present) also yielded the 
same excellent results in these selected patients. CHMP noted that fairly limited numbers of HCV 
Assessment report  
EMA/449689/2017  
Page 123/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
genotype-3 infected patients who failed therapy with peg-IFN + ribavirin (or possibly sofosbuvir + 
ribavirin) are yet to be treated (response rates relatively high with prior therapies). Of note, many such 
patients may already have been successfully treated with sofosbuvir + daclatasvir or 
sofobuvir/velpatasvir in the EU. Although GLE/PIB yielded high cure rates also for these patients (selected 
for negative predictors for cure), if given for 16 weeks, such patients have other 12 week options that are 
highly effective, and the role of GLE/PIB for such patients may be more limited.  
Patients who failed prior therapy that included the NS3- or NS5A class, or both, have been studied in 
limited numbers. Of note, this population is quite limited, since the new regimens have been shown to 
yield very high efficacy outcomes also in real life (not only in clinical trials), and these patients should be 
managed by experts. High overall efficacy was seen in such patients treated with GLE/PIB for 12 or 16 
weeks. However, the regimen is not optimal for many patients, and the limited sample size does not allow 
for the identification of a resistance testing algorithm to identify patients suitable for retreatment with 
GLE/PIB (rather than with a triple-class regimen including sofosbuvir). Failure on GLE/PIB retreatment is 
anticipated to aggravate NS3/4A and NS5A-class resistance. Therefore, the use of GLE/PIB in such 
patients may incur a loss of chance, and CHMP agreed that the use of GLE/PIB as a retreatment regimen 
cannot be recommended on the basis of the available, limited dataset.  
No particular concern is raised on the safety profile of this FDC on the basis of >2000 patients exposed so 
far. However, CHMP agreed that the Maviret SmPC should more adequately reflect that the use of this 
FDC could be associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and notably diarrhoea. ALT elevations have been 
observed throughout the clinical development without raising major issue. However, the clinical 
development with a selected population (limited co-administrations) might not fully predict the situation 
in real life. This will have to be kept under scrutiny.  
For the sake of consistency with other DAA the RMP has been adjusted taking into account the outcome 
of the recent PRAC referral on signal of HCC recurrence. 
The risk for double class resistance following a treatment failure is considered the one identified important 
unfavourable effect of this regimen. Such resistance may result in a low chance for SVR with a subsequent 
regimen, in particular if re-treatment needs to be undertaken without too much delay (cirrhotic patients), 
prior to a potential reversion of NS3 resistance. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit of Maviret (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) (efficacy) outweighs the risks (resistance development) 
with the proposed recommendation (8-16 weeks of therapy) for patients without prior exposure to the 
NS3 and NS5A DAA class.  
For the quite limited population with prior exposure to these DAA classes there is a risk for treatment 
failure since cross resistance within the classes does occur and where a (second) treatment failure with 
GLE/PIB may lower the chance considerably for a successful subsequent treatment. Re-treatment with 
GLE/PIB in such patients could be guided by resistance screening, but at present the company has not 
been able to provide data on what specific baseline resistance that would carry a risk for treatment failure. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk balance of Maviret (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) in the treatment of adult patients 
with chronic hepatitis C is positive.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for dimethyl fumarate (psoriasis), the 
scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Cumulative up to June 2020, 4 cases of herpes zoster (1 serious) were retrieved from the MAH safety 
database. Despite the low numbers, in view of available data from spontaneous reports including cases 
with a temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, 
the PRAC considers a causal relationship between Skilarence and herpes zoster is at least a reasonable 
possibility. The PRAC therefore proposes that the product information is amended accordingly to reflect 
this ADR. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for dimethyl fumarate (psoriasis) the CHMP is of the opinion 
that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing dimethyl fumarate (psoriasis) is 
unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Eylea is for intravitreal injection only. 
Eylea must only be administered by a qualified physician experienced in administering intravitreal 
injections. 
Posology 
wet AMD 
The recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg aflibercept, equivalent to 0.05 mL. 
Eylea treatment is initiated with one injection per month for three consecutive doses. The treatment 
interval is then extended to two months. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the physician’s judgement of visual and/or anatomic outcomes, the treatment interval may be 
maintained at two months or further extended using a treat-and-extend dosing regimen, where 
injection intervals are increased in 2- or 4-weekly increments to maintain stable visual and/or anatomic 
outcomes. 
If visual and/or anatomic outcomes deteriorate, the treatment interval should be shortened accordingly. 
There is no requirement for monitoring between injections. Based on the physician’s judgement the 
schedule of monitoring visits may be more frequent than the injection visits. 
Treatment intervals greater than four months or shorter than 4 weeks between injections have not been 
studied (see section 5.1). 
Macular oedema secondary to RVO (branch RVO or central RVO) 
The recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg aflibercept equivalent to 0.05 mL. 
After the initial injection, treatment is given monthly. The interval between two doses should not be 
shorter than one month. 
If visual and anatomic outcomes indicate that the patient is not benefiting from continued treatment, 
Eylea should be discontinued. 
Monthly treatment continues until maximum visual acuity is achieved and/or there are no signs of 
disease activity. Three or more consecutive, monthly injections may be needed. 
Treatment may then be continued with a treat-and-extend regimen with gradually increased treatment 
intervals to maintain stable visual and/or anatomic outcomes, however there are insufficient data to 
conclude on the length of these intervals. If visual and/or anatomic outcomes deteriorate, the treatment 
interval should be shortened accordingly. 
The monitoring and treatment schedule should be determined by the treating physician based on the 
individual patient’s response.  
Monitoring for disease activity may include clinical examination, functional testing or imaging 
techniques (e.g. optical coherence tomography or fluorescein angiography). 
Diabetic macular oedema 
The recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg aflibercept equivalent to 0.05 mL. 
Eylea treatment is initiated with one injection per month for five consecutive doses, followed by one 
injection every two months. 
Based on the physician’s judgement of visual and/or anatomic outcomes, the treatment interval may be 
maintained at 2 months or individualized, such as with a treat-and-extend dosing regimen, where the 
treatment intervals are usually increased by 2-week increments to maintain stable visual and/or 
anatomic outcomes. There are limited data for treatment intervals longer than 4 months. If visual 
and/or anatomic outcomes deteriorate, the treatment interval should be shortened accordingly. 
Treatment intervals shorter than 4 weeks have not been studied (see section 5.1). 
The schedule for monitoring should be determined by the treating physician.  
If visual and anatomic outcomes indicate that the patient is not benefiting from continued treatment, 
Eylea should be discontinued. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Myopic choroidal neovascularisation 
The recommended dose for Eylea is a single intravitreal injection of 2 mg aflibercept equivalent to 
0.05 mL. 
Additional doses may be administered if visual and/or anatomic outcomes indicate that the disease 
persists. Recurrences should be treated as a new manifestation of the disease. 
The schedule for monitoring should be determined by the treating physician. 
The interval between two doses should not be shorter than one month. 
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) 
The recommended dose for Eylea is a single intravitreal injection of 0.4 mg aflibercept equivalent to 
0.01 mL. 
Treatment of ROP is initiated with a single injection per eye and may be given bilaterally on the same 
day. In total, up to 2 injections per eye may be administered within 6 months of treatment initiation if 
there are signs of disease activity. The treatment interval between the 2 doses injected into the same 
eye should be at least 4 weeks. 
Special populations 
Hepatic and/or renal impairment 
No specific studies in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment have been conducted with Eylea. 
Available data do not suggest a need for a dose adjustment with Eylea in these patients (see 
section 5.2). 
Elderly population 
No special considerations are needed. There is limited experience in patients older than 75 years with 
DME. 
Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy of Eylea in children and adolescents below 18 years of age for indications 
other than ROP have not been established (see section 4.4). There is no relevant use of Eylea in the 
paediatric population for the indications of wet AMD, CRVO, BRVO, DME and myopic CNV. 
Method of administration 
Intravitreal injections must be carried out according to medical standards and applicable guidelines by 
a qualified physician experienced in administering intravitreal injections. In general, adequate 
anaesthesia and asepsis, including topical broad spectrum microbicide (e.g. povidone iodine applied to 
the periocular skin, eyelid and ocular surface), have to be ensured. Surgical hand disinfection, sterile 
gloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent) are recommended. 
Immediately following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in 
intraocular pressure. Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve 
head or tonometry. If required, sterile equipment for paracentesis should be available. 
Following intravitreal injection, adult patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive 
of endophthalmitis (e.g. eye pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without delay. 
Patients with ROP should be observed by healthcare professionals for any signs suggestive of 
endophthalmitis (e.g. redness/irritation of the eye, ocular discharge, lid swelling, photophobia).  
Parents and caregivers should also be instructed to observe and report any signs suggestive of 
endophthalmitis without delay.

Each pre-filled syringe should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. Extraction of multiple 
doses from a pre-filled syringe may increase the risk of contamination and subsequent infection. 
Adults 
The pre-filled syringe contains more than the recommended dose of 2 mg aflibercept (equivalent to 
0.05 mL solution for injection). The extractable volume of the syringe is the amount that can be 
expelled from the syringe and is not to be used in total. For the Eylea pre-filled syringe, the extractable 
volume is at least 0.09 mL. The excess volume must be expelled before injecting the recommended 
dose (see section 6.6). 
Injecting the entire volume of the pre-filled syringe could result in overdose. To expel the air bubbles 
along with excess medicinal product, slowly depress the plunger to align the base of the plunger 
dome (not the tip of the dome) with the dosing line on the syringe (equivalent to 0.05 mL i.e. 2 mg 
aflibercept) (see sections 4.9 and 6.6). 
The injection needle should be inserted 3.5-4.0 mm posterior to the limbus into the vitreous cavity, 
avoiding the horizontal meridian and aiming towards the centre of the globe. The injection volume of 
0.05  mL is then delivered; a different scleral site should be used for subsequent injections. 
After injection any unused product must be discarded. 
Paediatric population 
For treatment of preterm infants, the PICLEO paediatric dosing device in combination with the pre-
filled syringe must be used for administration of a single dose of 0.4 mg aflibercept (equivalent to 
0.01 mL solution for injection) (see section 6.6). 
The injection needle should be inserted into the eye 1.0 to 2.0 mm from the limbus with the needle 
pointing towards the optic nerve. 
After injection any unused product must be discarded. 
For handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance aflibercept or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Active or suspected ocular or periocular infection. 
Active severe intraocular inflammation. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Intravitreal injection-related reactions  
Intravitreal injections, including those with Eylea, have been associated with endophthalmitis, 
intraocular inflammation, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, retinal tear and iatrogenic traumatic 
cataract (see section 4.8). Proper aseptic injection techniques must always be used when administering 
Eylea. In addition, patients should be monitored during the week following the injection to permit 
early treatment if an infection occurs. 
Adult patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or any of 
the above mentioned events without delay. 
Patients with ROP should be observed by healthcare professionals for any signs suggestive of 
endophthalmitis (e.g. redness/irritation of the eye, ocular discharge, lid swelling, photophobia).  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Parents and caregivers should also be instructed to observe and report any signs suggestive of 
endophthalmitis without delay. 
The pre-filled syringe contains more than the recommended dose of 2 mg aflibercept (equivalent to 
0.05 mL) for adult patients. The excess volume must be expelled prior to administration (see 
sections 4.2 and 6.6). 
The pre-filled syringe contains more than the recommended dose of 0.4 mg (equivalent to 0.01 mL) 
for preterm infants (see section 6.6). The pre-filled syringe must be used in combination with the 
PICLEO paediatric dosing device to avoid a higher than recommended volume that could result in 
increased intraocular pressure (see sections 4.9 and 6.6). 
Increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including 
those with Eylea (see section 4.8). Special precaution is needed in patients with poorly controlled 
glaucoma (do not inject Eylea while the intraocular pressure is ≥ 30 mmHg). In all cases, both the 
intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head must therefore be monitored and 
managed appropriately. 
Immunogenicity 
As this is a therapeutic protein, there is a potential for immunogenicity with Eylea (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of intraocular inflammation, e.g. pain, 
photophobia, or redness, which may be a clinical sign attributable to hypersensitivity. 
Systemic effects 
Systemic adverse events including non-ocular haemorrhages and arterial thromboembolic events have 
been reported following intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors and there is a theoretical risk that 
these may relate to VEGF inhibition. There are limited data on safety in the treatment of patients with 
CRVO, BRVO, DME or myopic CNV with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attacks or 
myocardial infarction within the last 6 months. Caution should be exercised when treating such 
patients. 
Other 
As with other intravitreal anti-VEGF treatments for AMD, CRVO, BRVO, DME and myopic CNV 
the following also applies: 
•  The safety and efficacy of Eylea therapy administered to both eyes concurrently have not been 
systematically studied (see section 5.1). If bilateral treatment is performed at the same time this 
could lead to an increased systemic exposure, which could increase the risk of systemic adverse 
events. 
•  Concomitant use of other anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) 
There is no data available on the concomitant use of Eylea with other anti-VEGF medicinal 
products (systemic or ocular). 
•  Risk factors associated with the development of a retinal pigment epithelial tear after anti-
VEGF therapy for wet AMD, include a large and/or high pigment epithelial retinal detachment. 
When initiating Eylea therapy, caution should be used in patients with these risk factors for 
retinal pigment epithelial tears. 
•  Treatment should be withheld in patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or stage 3 
or 4 macular holes. 
•  In the event of a retinal break the dose should be withheld and treatment should not be resumed 
until the break is adequately repaired. 
•  The dose should be withheld and treatment should not be resumed earlier than the next 
scheduled treatment in the event of: 
o  a decrease in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of ≥30 letters compared with the 
last assessment of visual acuity; 
o  a subretinal haemorrhage involving the centre of the fovea, or, if the size of the 
haemorrhage is ≥50%, of the total lesion area. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  The dose should be withheld within the previous or next 28 days in the event of a performed or 
planned intraocular surgery. 
•  Eylea should not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk 
to the foetus (see section 4.6). 
•  Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at 
least 3 months after the last intravitreal injection of aflibercept (see section 4.6). 
•  There is limited experience with treatment of patients with ischaemic CRVO and BRVO. In 
patients presenting with clinical signs of irreversible ischaemic visual function loss, the 
treatment is not recommended. 
Paediatric population 
The warnings and precautions for adults also apply to preterm infants with ROP. The long-term safety 
profile in preterm infants has not been established. 
Populations with limited data 
There is only limited experience in the treatment of subjects with DME due to type I diabetes or in 
diabetic patients with an HbA1c over 12% or with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. 
Eylea has not been studied in patients with active systemic infections or in patients with concurrent 
eye conditions such as retinal detachment or macular hole. There is also no experience of treatment 
with Eylea in diabetic patients with uncontrolled hypertension. This lack of information should be 
considered by the physician when treating such patients. 
In myopic CNV there is no experience with Eylea in the treatment of non-Asian patients, patients who 
have previously undergone treatment for myopic CNV, and patients with extrafoveal lesions. 
Information about excipients 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say essentially 
’sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Adjunctive use of verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) and Eylea has not been studied, therefore, 
a safety profile is not established. 
Paediatric population 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 
3 months after the last intravitreal injection of aflibercept (see section 4.4). 
Pregnancy 
There are no data on the use of aflibercept in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown embryo-foetal toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Although the systemic exposure after ocular administration is very low, Eylea should not be used 
during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
Based on very limited human data, aflibercept may be excreted in human milk at low levels. 
Aflibercept is a large protein molecule and the amount of medication absorbed by the infant is 
expected to be minimal. The effects of aflibercept on a breast-fed newborn/infant are unknown.  
As a precautionary measure, breast-feeding is not recommended during the use of Eylea. 
Fertility 
Results from animal studies with high systemic exposure indicate that aflibercept can impair male and 
female fertility (see section 5.3). Such effects are not expected after ocular administration with very 
low systemic exposure. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Injection with Eylea has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to possible 
temporary visual disturbances associated either with the injection or the eye examination. Patients 
should not drive or use machines until their visual function has recovered sufficiently. 
4.8 
Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
A total of 3,102 patients constituted the safety population in the eight phase III studies. Among those, 
2,501 patients were treated with the recommended dose of 2 mg. 
Serious ocular adverse reactions in the study eye related to the injection procedure have occurred in 
less than 1 in 1,900 intravitreal injections with Eylea and included blindness, endophthalmitis, retinal 
detachment, cataract traumatic, cataract, vitreous haemorrhage, vitreous detachment, and intraocular 
pressure increased (see section 4.4). 
The most frequently observed adverse reactions (in at least 5% of patients treated with Eylea) were 
conjunctival haemorrhage (25%), retinal haemorrhage (11%), visual acuity reduced (11%), eye 
pain (10%), cataract (8%), intraocular pressure increased (8%), vitreous detachment (7%), and 
vitreous floaters (7%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Description of selected adverse reactions 
In the wet AMD phase III studies, there was an increased incidence of conjunctival haemorrhage in 
patients receiving anti-thrombotic agents. This increased incidence was comparable between patients 
treated with ranibizumab and Eylea. 
Arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) are adverse events potentially related to systemic VEGF 
inhibition. There is a theoretical risk of arterial thromboembolic events, including stroke and 
myocardial infarction, following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. 
A low incidence rate of arterial thromboembolic events was observed in the Eylea clinical trials in 
patients with AMD, DME, RVO, myopic CNV and ROP. Across indications no notable difference 
between the groups treated with aflibercept and the respective comparator groups were observed. 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with Eylea. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
The safety of Eylea for the treatment of ROP was evaluated in a 6-month phase III study, which 
included 75 preterm infants treated with aflibercept 0.4 mg at baseline. The long-term safety profile in 
preterm infants has not been established. 
Adverse reactions reported in more than one patient treated with aflibercept 0.4 mg were retinal 
detachment, retinal haemorrhage, conjunctival haemorrhage, injection site haemorrhage, intraocular 
pressure increased and eyelid oedema. 
Adverse reactions established for adult indications are considered applicable to preterm infants with 
ROP, though not all were observed in the phase III study. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9   Overdose 
In clinical trials, doses of up to 4 mg in monthly intervals have been used and isolated cases of 
overdoses with 8 mg occurred. 
Overdosing with increased injection volume may increase intraocular pressure. Therefore, in case of 
overdose, intraocular pressure should be monitored and if deemed necessary by the treating physician, 
adequate treatment should be initiated (see section 6.6).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals / Antineovascularisation agents 
ATC code: S01LA05 
Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF receptor 1 and 2 
extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1. 
Aflibercept is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells by recombinant DNA technology. 
Aflibercept acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF-A and PlGF with higher affinity than 
their natural receptors, and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF 
receptors. 
Mechanism of action 
Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are members of 
the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as potent mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular 
permeability factors for endothelial cells. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases; VEGFR-1 and 
VEGFR-2, present on the surface of endothelial cells. PlGF binds only to VEGFR-1, which is also 
present on the surface of leucocytes. Excessive activation of these receptors by VEGF-A can result in 
pathological neovascularisation and excessive vascular permeability. PlGF can synergize with VEGF-
A in these processes, and is also known to promote leucocyte infiltration and vascular inflammation.

Pharmacodynamic effects 
wet AMD 
Wet AMD is characterised by pathological choroidal neovascularisation (CNV). Leakage of blood and 
fluid from CNV may cause retinal thickening or oedema and/or sub-/intra-retinal haemorrhage, 
resulting in loss of visual acuity. 
In patients treated with Eylea (one injection per month for three consecutive months, followed by one 
injection every 2 months), central retinal thickness [CRT] decreased soon after treatment initiation, 
and the mean CNV lesion size was reduced, consistent with the results seen with ranibizumab 0.5 mg 
every month. 
In the VIEW1 study there were mean decreases in CRT on optical coherence tomography (OCT) (-130 
and -129 microns at week 52 for the Eylea 2 mg every two months and ranibizumab 0.5 mg every 
month study groups, respectively). Also at the 52 week time point, in the VIEW2 study there were 
mean decreases in CRT on OCT (-149 and -139 microns for the Eylea 2 mg every two months and 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg every month study groups, respectively). The reduction of CNV size and 
reduction in CRT were generally maintained in the second year of the studies. 
The ALTAIR study was conducted in Japanese patients with treatment naïve wet AMD, showing 
similar outcomes to the VIEW studies using 3 initial monthly Eylea 2 mg injections, followed by one 
injection after a further 2 months, and then continued with a treat-and-extend regimen with variable 
treatment intervals (2- week or 4- week adjustments) up to a maximum 16 week interval according to 
pre-specified criteria. At week 52, there were mean decreases in central retinal thickness (CRT) on 
OCT of -134.4 and –126.1 microns for the 2-week adjustment group and the 4-week adjustment group, 
respectively. The proportion of patients without fluid on OCT at week 52 was 68.3% and 69.1% in the 
2- and 4-week adjustment groups, respectively. The reduction in CRT was generally maintained in 
both treatment arms in the second year of the ALTAIR study. 
The ARIES study was designed to explore the non-inferiority of an Eylea 2 mg treat-and-extend dosing 
regimen initiated immediately after administration of 3 initial monthly injections and one additional 
injection after 2 months vs. a treat-and-extend dosing regimen initiated after one year of treatment. For 
patients requiring a more frequent than Q8 dosing at least once over the course of the study, CRT 
remained higher, but the mean decrease in CRT from baseline to week 104 was -160.4 microns, similar 
to the patients treated at Q8 or less frequent intervals. 
Macular oedema secondary to CRVO and BRVO 
In CRVO and BRVO, retinal ischaemia occurs and signals the release of VEGF which in turn 
destabilises the tight junctions, and promotes endothelial cell proliferation. Up-regulation of VEGF is 
associated with the breakdown of the blood retina barrier, increased vascular permeability, retinal 
oedema, and neovascularisation complications. 
In patients treated with 6 consecutive monthly injections of Eylea 2 mg, there was a consistent, rapid 
and robust morphologic response (as measured by improvements in mean CRT) observed. At week 24, 
the reduction in CRT was statistically superior versus control in all three studies (COPERNICUS in 
CRVO: -457 vs. -145 microns; GALILEO in CRVO: -449 vs. -169 microns; VIBRANT in BRVO: -
280 vs. -128 microns). This decrease from baseline in CRT was maintained to the end of each study, 
week 100 in COPERNICUS, week 76 in GALILEO, and week 52 in VIBRANT. 
Diabetic macular oedema 
Diabetic macular oedema is a consequence of diabetic retinopathy and is characterised by increased 
vasopermeability and damage to the retinal capillaries which may result in loss of visual acuity.  
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients treated with Eylea, the majority of whom were classified as having Type II diabetes, a rapid 
and robust response in morphology (CRT, DRSS level) was observed. 
In the VIVIDDME and the VISTADME studies, a statistically significant greater mean decrease in CRT 
from baseline to week 52 was observed in patients treated with Eylea than with the laser control, -
192.4 and -183.1 microns for the 2Q8 Eylea groups and -66.2 and -73.3 microns for the control 
groups, respectively. At week 100 the decrease was maintained with -195.8 and -191.1 microns for the 
2Q8 Eylea groups and -85.7 and -83.9 microns for the control groups, in the VIVIDDME and 
VISTADME studies, respectively. 
A ≥2 step improvement in DRSS was assessed in a pre-specified manner in VIVIDDME and VISTADME. 
The DRSS score was gradable in 73.7% of the patients in VIVIDDME and 98.3% of the patients in 
VISTADME. At week 52, 27.7% and 29.1% of the Eylea 2Q8 groups, and 7.5% and 14.3% of the 
control groups experienced a ≥2 step improvement in the DRSS. At week 100, the respective 
percentages were 32.6% and 37.1% of the Eylea 2Q8 groups and 8.2% and 15.6% of the control 
groups. 
The VIOLET study compared three different dosing regimens of Eylea 2 mg for treatment of DME 
after at least one year of treatment at fixed intervals, where treatment was initiated with 5 consecutive 
monthly doses followed by dosing every 2 months. At week 52 and week 100 of the study, i.e. second 
and third year of treatment, the mean changes in CRT were clinically similar for treat-and-extend 
(2T&E), pro re nata (2PRN) and 2Q8, respectively, -2.1, 2.2 and -18.8 microns at week 52, and 2.3, 
-13.9 and -15.5 microns at week 100. 
Myopic choroidal neovascularisation 
Myopic choroidal neovascularisation (myopic CNV) is a frequent cause of vision loss in adults with 
pathologic myopia. It develops as a wound healing mechanism consequent to Bruch’s membrane 
ruptures and represents the most vision-threatening event in pathologic myopia. 
In patients treated with Eylea in the MYRROR study (one injection given at start of therapy, with 
additional injections given in case of disease persistence or recurrence), CRT decreased soon after 
treatment initiation favouring Eylea at week 24 (-79 microns and -4 microns for the Eylea 2 mg 
treatment group and the control group, respectively), which was maintained through week 48. In 
addition, the mean CNV lesion size decreased. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
wet AMD 
The safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in two randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, 
active-controlled studies in patients with wet AMD (VIEW1 and VIEW2) with a total of 
2,412 patients treated and evaluable for efficacy (1,817 with Eylea). Patient ages ranged from 49 to 
99 years with a mean of 76 years. In these clinical studies, approximately 89% (1,616/1,817) of the 
patients randomised to treatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or older, and approximately 
63% (1,139/1,817) were 75 years of age or older. In each study, patients were randomly assigned in a 
1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 4 dosing regimens: 
1) Eylea administered at 2 mg every 8 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses (Eylea 2Q8); 
2) Eylea administered at 2 mg every 4 weeks (Eylea 2Q4); 
3) Eylea administered at 0.5 mg every 4 weeks (Eylea 0.5Q4); and 
4) ranibizumab administered at 0.5 mg every 4 weeks (ranibizumab 0.5Q4). 
In the second year of the studies, patients continued to receive the initially randomised dosage but on a 
modified dosing schedule guided by assessment of visual and anatomic outcomes with a protocol-
defined maximum dosing interval of 12 weeks.

In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in the Per Protocol Set 
who maintained vision, i.e. losing fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at week 52 from baseline. 
In the VIEW1 study, at week 52, 95.1% of patients in the Eylea 2Q8 group maintained vision 
compared to 94.4% patients in the ranibizumab 0.5Q4 group. In the VIEW2 study, at week 52, 95.6% 
of patients in the Eylea 2Q8 group maintained vision compared to 94.4% patients in the ranibizumab 
0.5Q4 group. In both studies Eylea was shown to be non-inferior and clinically equivalent to the 
ranibizumab 0.5Q4 group. 
Detailed results from the combined analysis of both studies are shown in Table 2 and Figure 1 below.

Figure 1. Mean Change in Visual Acuity 
from Baseline to Week 96 for the Combined 
Data from the View1 and View2 Studies 
In combined data analysis of VIEW1 and VIEW2, Eylea demonstrated clinically meaningful changes 
from baseline in pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoint National Eye Institute Visual Function 
Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) without clinically meaningful differences to ranibizumab. The 
magnitude of these changes was similar to that seen in published studies, which corresponded to a 15-
letter gain in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA). 
In the second year of the studies, efficacy was generally maintained through the last assessment at 
week 96, and 2-4% of patients required all injections on a monthly basis, and a third of patients 
required at least one injection with a treatment interval of only one month. 
Decreases in mean CNV area were evident in all dose groups in both studies. 
Efficacy results in all evaluable subgroups (e.g. age, gender, race, baseline visual acuity, lesion type, 
lesion size) in each study and in the combined analysis were consistent with the results in the overall 
populations. 
ALTAIR was a 96 week multicentre, randomised, open-label study in 247 Japanese patients with 
treatment naïve wet AMD, designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Eylea following two different 
adjustment intervals (2- weeks and 4- weeks) of a treat-and-extend dosing regimen. 
All patients received monthly doses of Eylea 2 mg for 3 months, followed by one injection after a 
further 2 month interval. At week 16, patients were randomised 1:1 into two treatment groups: 1) 
Eylea treat-and-extend with 2-week adjustments and 2) Eylea treat-and-extend with 4-week 
adjustments. Extension or shortening of the treatment interval was decided based on visual and/or 
anatomic criteria defined by protocol with a maximum treatment interval of 16 weeks for both groups. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change in BCVA from baseline to week 52. The secondary 
efficacy endpoints were the proportion of patients who did not lose ≥15 letters and the proportion of 
patients who gained at least 15 letters of BCVA from baseline to week 52. 
At week 52, patients in the treat-and-extend arm with 2-week adjustments gained a mean of 9.0 letters 
from baseline as compared to 8.4 letters for those in the 4-week adjustment group [LS mean difference 
in letters (95% CI): -0.4 (-3.8,3.0), ANCOVA]. The proportion of patients who did not lose ≥15 letters 
in the two treatment arms was similar (96.7% in the 2-week and 95.9% in the 4-week adjustment 
groups). The proportion of patients who gained ≥15 letters at week 52 was 32.5% in the 2-week 
adjustment group and 30.9% in the 4-week adjustment group. The proportion of patients who extended 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
their treatment interval to 12 weeks or beyond was 42.3% in the 2-week adjustment group and 49.6% 
in the 4-week adjustment group. Furthermore, in the 4-week adjustment group 40.7% of patients were 
extended to 16 week intervals. At the last visit up to week 52, 56.8% and 57.8% of patients in the 
2-week and 4-week adjustment groups, respectively had their next injection scheduled at an interval of 
12 weeks or beyond. 
In the second year of the study, efficacy was generally maintained up to and including the last 
assessment at week 96, with a mean gain from baseline of 7.6 letters for the 2-week adjustment group 
and 6.1 letters for the 4-week adjustment group. The proportion of patients who extended their 
treatment interval to 12 weeks or beyond was 56.9% in the 2-week adjustment group and 60.2% in the 
4-week adjustment group. At the last visit prior to week 96, 64.9% and 61.2% of patients in the 
2-week and 4-week adjustment groups, respectively had their next injection scheduled at an interval of 
12 weeks or beyond. During the second year of treatment patients in both the 2-week and 4-week 
adjustment groups received an average of 3.6 and 3.7 injections, respectively. Over the 2 year 
treatment period patients received an average of 10.4 injections. 
Ocular and systemic safety profiles were similar to the safety observed in the pivotal studies VIEW 1 
and VIEW 2. 
ARIES was a 104-week multicentre, randomised, open-label, active-controlled study in 269 patients 
with treatment naïve wet AMD, designed to assess the non-inferiority in terms of efficacy as well as 
the safety of a treat-and-extend dosing regimen initiated after 3 consecutive monthly doses followed 
by extension to a 2 monthly treatment interval vs. a treat-and-extend dosing regimen initiated after the 
first year of treatment. 
The ARIES study also explored the percentage of patients that required more frequent treatment than 
every 8 weeks based on the investigator’s decision. Out of the 269 patients 62 patients received more 
frequent dosing at least once during the course of the study. Such patients remained in the study and 
received treatment according to the investigator’s best clinical judgement but not more frequently than 
every 4 weeks and their treatment intervals could be extended again afterwards. The average treatment 
interval after the decision to treat more frequently was 6.1 weeks. Week 104 BCVA was lower in 
patients requiring more intensive treatment at least once over the course of the study compared with 
patients who did not and the mean change in BCVA from baseline to end of the study was 
+2.3 ± 15.6 letters. Among the patients treated more frequently, 85.5% maintained vision, i.e. lost less 
than15 letters, and 19.4% gained 15 letters or more. The safety profile of patients treated more 
frequently than every 8 weeks was comparable to the safety data in VIEW 1 and VIEW 2. 
Macular oedema secondary to CRVO 
The safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in two randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, 
sham-controlled studies in patients with macular oedema secondary to CRVO (COPERNICUS and 
GALILEO) with a total of 358 patients treated and evaluable for efficacy (217 with Eylea). Patient 
ages ranged from 22 to 89 years with a mean of 64 years. In the CRVO studies, approximately 52% 
(112/217) of the patients randomised to treatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or older, and 
approximately 18% (38/217) were 75 years of age or older. In both studies, patients were randomly 
assigned in a 3:2 ratio to either 2 mg Eylea administered every 4 weeks (2Q4), or the control group 
receiving sham injections every 4 weeks for a total of 6 injections. 
After 6 consecutive monthly injections, patients received treatment only if they met pre-specified 
retreatment criteria, except for patients in the control group in the GALILEO study who continued to 
receive sham (control to control) until week 52. From this timepoint all patients were treated if pre-
specified criteria were met. 
In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who gained at least 
15 letters in BCVA at week 24 compared to baseline. A secondary efficacy variable was change in 
visual acuity at week 24 compared to baseline. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The difference between treatment groups was statistically significant in favour of Eylea in both 
studies. The maximal improvement in visual acuity was achieved at month 3 with subsequent 
stabilisation of visual acuity and CRT until month 6. The statistically significant difference was 
maintained through week 52. 
Detailed results from the analysis of both studies are shown in Table 3 and Figure 2 below.

Figure 2:  
for the COPERNICUS and GALILEO Studies (Full Analysis Set) 
Mean Change from Baseline to Week 76/100 in Visual Acuity by Treatment Group 
In GALILEO, 86.4% (n=89) of the Eylea group and 79.4% (n=54) of the sham group had perfused 
CRVO at baseline. At week 24, this was 91.8% (n=89) in the Eylea group and 85.5% (n=47) in the 
sham group. These proportions were maintained at week 76, with 84.3% (n=75) in the Eylea group 
and 84.0% (n=42) in the sham group. 
19 
 
 
 
In COPERNICUS, 67.5% (n = 77) of the Eylea group and 68.5% (n = 50) of the sham group had 
perfused CRVO at baseline. At week 24, this was 87.4% (n = 90) in the Eylea group and 58.6% 
(n = 34) in the sham group. These proportions were maintained at week 100 with 76.8% (n = 76) in the 
Eylea group and 78% (n = 39) in the sham group. Patients in the sham group were eligible to receive 
Eylea from week 24. 
The beneficial effect of Eylea treatment on visual function was similar in the baseline subgroups of 
perfused and non-perfused patients. Treatment effects in other evaluable subgroups (e.g. age, gender, 
race, baseline visual acuity, CRVO duration) in each study were in general consistent with the results 
in the overall populations. 
In combined data analysis of GALILEO and COPERNICUS, Eylea demonstrated clinically 
meaningful changes from baseline in pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoint National Eye Institute 
Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25). The magnitude of these changes was similar to that 
seen in published studies, which corresponded to a 15-letter gain in Best Corrected Visual Acuity 
(BCVA). 
Macular oedema secondary to BRVO 
The safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in a randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, active-
controlled study in patients with macular oedema secondary to BRVO (VIBRANT) which included 
Hemi-Retinal Vein Occlusion. A total of 181 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy (91 with 
Eylea). Patient ages ranged from 42 to 94 years with a mean of 65 years. In the BRVO study, 
approximately 58% (53/91) of the patients randomised to treatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or 
older, and approximately 23% (21/91) were 75 years of age or older. In the study, patients were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either 2 mg Eylea administered every 8 weeks following 6 initial 
monthly injections or laser photocoagulation administered at baseline (laser control group). Patients in 
the laser control group could receive additional laser photocoagulation (called ‘rescue laser treatment’) 
beginning at week 12 with a minimum interval of 12 weeks. Based on pre-specified criteria, patients in 
the laser group could receive rescue treatment with Eylea 2 mg from week 24, administered every 
4 weeks for 3 months followed by every 8 weeks.  
In the VIBRANT study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who gained at 
least 15 letters in BCVA at week 24 compared to baseline and the Eylea group was superior to laser 
control.  
A secondary efficacy endpoint was change in visual acuity at week 24 compared to baseline, which 
was statistically significant in favour of Eylea in the VIBRANT study. The course of visual 
improvement was rapid and peaked at 3 months with maintenance of the effect until month 12. 
In the laser group 67 patients received rescue treatment with Eylea beginning at week 24 (Active 
Control/ Eylea 2 mg group), which resulted in improvement of visual acuity by about 5 letters from 
week 24 to 52. 
Detailed results from the analysis of the VIBRANT study are shown in Table 4 and Figure 3 below.

Mean Change in BCVA as Measured by ETDRS Letter Score from Baseline to 
At baseline, the proportion of perfused patients in the Eylea and laser groups was 60% and 68%, 
respectively. At week 24 these proportions were 80% and 67%, respectively. In the Eylea group the 
proportion of perfused patients was maintained through week 52. In the laser group, where patients 
were eligible for rescue treatment with Eylea from week 24, the proportion of perfused patients 
increased to 78% by week 52.  
Diabetic macular oedema 
The safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in two randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, 
active-controlled studies in patients with DME (VIVIDDME and VISTADME). A total of 862 patients 
were treated and evaluable for efficacy, 576 with Eylea. Patient ages ranged from 23 to 87 years with a 
mean of 63 years. In the DME studies, approximately 47% (268/576) of the patients randomised to 
treatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or older, and approximately 9% (52/576) were 75 years of 
age or older. The majority of patients in both studies had Type II diabetes. 
In both studies, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dosing regimens: 
1) Eylea administered 2 mg every 8 weeks following 5 initial monthly injections (Eylea 2Q8); 
2) Eylea administered 2 mg every 4 weeks (Eylea 2Q4); and 
3) macular laser photocoagulation (active control). 
Beginning at week 24, patients meeting a pre-specified threshold of vision loss were eligible to receive 
additional treatment: patients in the Eylea groups could receive laser and patients in the control group 
could receive Eylea. 
In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in BCVA at 
week 52 and both Eylea 2Q8 and Eylea 2Q4 groups demonstrated statistical significance and were 
superior to the control group. This benefit was maintained through week 100. 
Detailed results from the analysis of the VIVIDDME and VISTADME studies are shown in Table 5 and

Treatment effects in evaluable subgroups (e.g., age, gender, race, baseline HbA1c, baseline visual 
acuity, prior anti-VEGF therapy) in each study and in the combined analysis were generally consistent 
with the results in the overall populations. 
In the VIVIDDME and VISTADME studies, 36 (9%) and 197 (43%) patients received prior anti-VEGF 
therapy, respectively, with a 3-month or longer washout period. Treatment effects in the subgroup of 
patients who had previously been treated with a VEGF inhibitor were similar to those seen in patients 
who were VEGF inhibitor naïve. 
Patients with bilateral disease were eligible to receive anti-VEGF treatment in their fellow eye if 
assessed necessary by the physician. In the VISTADME study, 217 (70.7%) of Eylea patients received 
bilateral Eylea injections until week 100; in the VIVIDDME study, 97 (35.8%) of Eylea patients 
received a different anti-VEGF treatment in their fellow eye. 
An independent comparative trial (DRCR.net Protocol T) utilised a flexible dosing regimen based on 
strict OCT and vision re-treatment criteria. In the aflibercept treatment group (n = 224) at week 52, 
this treatment regimen resulted in patients receiving a mean of 9.2 injections, which is similar to the 
administered number of doses in the Eylea 2Q8 group in VIVIDDME and VISTADME, while overall 
efficacy of the aflibercept treatment group in Protocol T was comparable to the Eylea 2Q8 group in 
VIVIDDME and VISTADME. A 13.3 mean letter gain with 42% of patients gaining at least 15 letters in 
vision from baseline was observed in Protocol T. Safety outcomes demonstrated that overall incidence 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
of ocular and non-ocular adverse events (including ATEs) were comparable across all treatment 
groups in each of the studies and between the studies. 
VIOLET, a 100-week multicentre, randomised, open-label, active controlled study in patients with 
DME compared three different dosing regimens of Eylea 2 mg for treatment of DME after at least one 
year of treatment at fixed intervals, where treatment was initiated with 5 consecutive monthly doses 
followed by dosing every 2 months. The study evaluated non-inferiority of Eylea 2 mg dosed 
according to a treat-and-extend regimen (2T&E where injections intervals were kept at a minimum of 
8 weeks and gradually extended based onclinical and anatomical outcomes) and Eylea 2 mg dosed as 
needed (2PRN where patients were observed every 4 weeks and injected when needed based on 
clinical and anatomical outcomes), compared to Eylea 2 mg dosed every 8 weeks (2Q8) for the second 
and third year of treatment. 
The primary efficacy endpoint (change in BCVA from baseline to week 52) was 0.5 ± 6.7 letters in the 
2T&E group and 1.7 ± 6.8 letters in the 2PRN group compared to 0.4 ± 6.7 letters in the 2Q8 group, 
achieving statistical non-inferiority (p<0.0001 for both comparisons; NI margin 4 letters). The changes 
in BCVA from baseline to week 100 were consistent with the week 52 results: -0.1 ± 9.1 letters in the 
2T&E group and 1.8 ± 9.0 letters in the 2PRN group compared to 0.1 ± 7.2 letters in the 2Q8 group. 
The mean number of injections over 100 weeks were 12.3, 10.0 and 11.5 for 2Q8fix, 2T&E and 
2PRN, respectively. 
Ocular and systemic safety profiles in all 3 treatment groups were similar to those observed in the 
pivotal studies VIVID and VISTA. 
In the 2T&E group, the increments and decrements for the injection intervals were at the investigator’s 
discretion; increments of 2 weeks were recommended in the study. 
Myopic choroidal neovascularisation 
The safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in a randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, sham-
controlled study in treatment-naïve, Asian patients with myopic CNV. A total of 121 patients were 
treated and evaluable for efficacy (90 with Eylea). Patient ages ranged from 27 to 83 years with a 
mean of 58 years. In the myopic CNV study, approximately 36% (33/91) of the patients randomised to 
treatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or older, and approximately 10% (9/91) were 75 years of 
age or older. 
Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either 2 mg Eylea intravitreally or sham 
injections administered once at study start with additional injections given monthly in case of disease 
persistence or recurrence until week 24, when the primary endpoint was assessed. At week 24, patients 
initially randomised to sham were eligible to receive the first dose of Eylea. Following this, patients in 
both groups continued to be eligible for additional injections in case of disease persistence or 
recurrence. 
The difference between treatment groups was statistically significant in favour of Eylea for the 
primary endpoint (change in BCVA) and confirmatory secondary efficacy endpoint (proportion of 
patients who gained 15 letters in BCVA) at week 24 compared to baseline. Differences for both 
endpoints were maintained through week 48. 
Detailed results from the analysis of the MYRROR study are shown in Table 6 and Figure 5 below.

Paediatric population 
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) 
The efficacy, safety and tolerability of Eylea 0.4 mg for the treatment of ROP in preterm infants were 
assessed based on the 6-month data from the multicentre, randomised, 2-arm, open-label parallel-
group study FIREFLEYE, which was designed to evaluate Eylea 0.4 mg given as intravitreal injection 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in comparison to laser photocoagulation therapy (laser). Eligible patients had treatment-naïve ROP 
classified according to the International Classification for Retinopathy of Prematurity in at least one 
eye with one of the following retinal findings: 
•  ROP Zone I Stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+, or 
•  ROP Zone II Stage 2+ or 3+, or 
•  AP-ROP (aggressive posterior ROP) 
Eligible patients had a maximum gestational age at birth of 32 weeks or a maximum birth weight of 
1500 g. The patients weighed >800 g at the day of treatment. 
Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive intravitreal Eylea 0.4 mg or laser therapy. All 
113 patients treated at baseline (Eylea 0.4 mg n=75; laser n=38) were evaluated for the primary 
efficacy analysis. 
Treatment success was defined as absence of active ROP and unfavourable structural outcomes in both 
eyes at 24 weeks after the start of study treatment. The success criterion (non-inferiority of Eylea 0.4 
mg therapy to conventional laser therapy) was statistically not met, although treatment success was 
numerically slightly higher with Eylea 0.4 mg (85.5%) compared to laser (82.1%) at 24 weeks. 
However, available data from infants at 2 years of age in the extension study FIREFLEYE NEXT (54 
infants: 36 Eylea 0.4 mg group and 18 laser group) tend to confirm long term efficacy of Eylea 0.4 
mg. 
The majority of patients treated with Eylea 0.4 mg received a single injection per eye (78.7%) and 
were treated bilaterally (94.7%). No patient received more than 2 injections per eye.

During the 24 weeks of the study, a lower proportion of patients in the Eylea 0.4 mg group switched to 
another treatment modality due to lack of response compared with the laser group (10.7% vs. 13.2%).  
Unfavourable structural outcomes were reported in a similar proportion of patients in the Eylea 0.4 mg 
group (6 patients, 8%) compared with laser (3 patients, 7.9%). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Eylea 
in all subsets of the paediatric population in wet AMD, CRVO, BRVO, DME and myopic CNV 
populations (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). In addition, the European Medicines 
Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Eylea in the following subsets 
of the paediatric population in ROP: term newborn infants, infants, children and adolescents.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Eylea is administered directly into the vitreous to exert local effects in the eye. 
Absorption / Distribution 
Aflibercept is slowly absorbed from the eye into the systemic circulation after intravitreal 
administration and is predominately observed in the systemic circulation as an inactive, stable 
complex with VEGF; however only “free aflibercept” is able to bind endogenous VEGF. 
In a pharmacokinetic sub-study in 6 neovascular wet AMD patients with frequent sampling, maximum 
plasma concentrations of free aflibercept (systemic Cmax) were low, with a mean of approximately 
0.02 microgram/mL (range 0 to 0.054) within 1 to 3 days after a 2 mg intravitreal injection, and were 
undetectable two weeks following dosage in almost all patients. Aflibercept does not accumulate in 
the plasma when administered intravitreally every 4 weeks. 
The mean maximum plasma concentration of free aflibercept is approximately 50 to 500 times below 
the aflibercept concentration required to inhibit the biologic activity of systemic VEGF by 50% in 
animal models, in which blood pressure changes were observed after circulating levels of free 
aflibercept attained approximately 10 microgram/mL and returned to baseline when levels fell below 
approximately 1 microgram/mL. It is estimated that after intravitreal administration of 2 mg to 
patients, the mean maximum plasma concentration of free aflibercept is more than 100-fold lower than 
the concentration of aflibercept required to half-maximally bind systemic VEGF (2.91 microgram/mL) 
in a study of healthy volunteers. Therefore, systemic pharmacodynamic effects such as blood pressure 
changes are unlikely. 
In pharmacokinetic sub-studies in patients with CRVO, BRVO, DME or myopic CNV mean Cmax of 
free aflibercept in plasma were similar with values in the range of 0.03 to 0.05 microgram/mL and 
individual values not exceeding 0.14 microgram/mL. Thereafter, plasma concentrations of free 
aflibercept declined to values below or close to the lower limit of quantitation generally within one 
week; undetectable concentrations were reached before the next administration after 4 weeks in all 
patients. 
Elimination 
As Eylea is a protein-based therapeutic, no metabolism studies have been conducted. 
Free aflibercept binds VEGF to form a stable, inert complex. As with other large proteins, both free 
and bound aflibercept are expected to be cleared by proteolytic catabolism. 
Renal impairment 
No special studies in patients with renal impairment have been conducted with Eylea. 
Pharmacokinetic analysis of patients in the VIEW2 study, of which 40% had renal impairment 
(24% mild, 15% moderate, and 1% severe), revealed no differences with respect to plasma 
concentrations of active drug after intravitreal administration every 4 or 8 weeks. 
Similar results were seen in patients with CRVO in the GALILEO study, in patients with DME in the 
VIVIDDME study, and in patients with myopic CNV in the MYRROR study. 
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetic properties of aflibercept were evaluated in preterm infants with ROP at a dose of 
0.4 mg aflibercept (per eye). Following intravitreal injection, concentrations of free and bound 
aflibercept were higher than those observed in wet AMD adult patients receiving 2 mg (in one eye) but 
lower than after i.v. administration of the maximum tolerated dose of 1 mg/kg in adult patients. Mean 
concentrations of free aflibercept declined to approximately 0.13 microgram/mL at week 4 after 
dosing. Plasma concentrations of free aflibercept declined to values below or close to the lower limit 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of quantitation within approximately 8 weeks. Mean concentrations of adjusted bound aflibercept 
increased up to 1.34 microgram/mL at week 4 and declined thereafter. 
An exploratory PK/PD analysis showed no relationship between systemic aflibercept concentrations and 
pharmacodynamic effects such as blood pressure changes. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Effects in non-clinical studies on repeated dose toxicity were observed only at systemic exposures 
considered substantially in excess of the maximum human exposure after intravitreal administration at 
the intended clinical dose indicating little relevance to clinical use. 
Erosions and ulcerations of the respiratory epithelium in nasal turbinates in monkeys treated with 
aflibercept intravitreally were observed at systemic exposures in excess of the maximum human 
exposure. At the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 0.5mg/eye in monkeys the systemic 
exposure for free aflibercept was 42- and 56-fold higher based on Cmax and AUC when compared to 
corresponding values observed in adult patients, and 2-fold higher based on Cmax when compared to 
corresponding values observed in preterm infants. 
No studies have been conducted on the mutagenic or carcinogenic potential of aflibercept. 
An effect of aflibercept on intrauterine development was shown in embryo-foetal development studies 
in pregnant rabbits with intravenous (3 to 60 mg/kg) as well as subcutaneous (0.1 to 1 mg/kg) 
administration. The maternal NOAEL was at the dose of 3 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg, respectively. A 
developmental NOAEL was not identified. At the 0.1 mg/kg dose, the systemic exposures based on 
Cmax and cumulative AUC for free aflibercept were approximately 17- and 10-fold higher, 
respectively, when compared to corresponding values observed in humans after an intravitreal dose of 
2 mg. 
Effects on male and female fertility were assessed as part of a 6-month study in monkeys with 
intravenous administration of aflibercept at doses ranging from 3 to 30 mg/kg. Absent or irregular 
menses associated with alterations in female reproductive hormone levels and changes in sperm 
morphology and motility were observed at all dose levels. Based on Cmax and AUC for free aflibercept 
observed at the 3 mg/kg intravenous dose, the systemic exposures were approximately 4,900-fold and 
1,500-fold higher, respectively, than the exposure observed in humans after an intravitreal dose of 
2 mg. All changes were reversible.

Special precautions for storage 
Store in a refrigerator (2 °C to 8 °C). 
Do not freeze. 
Store in the original package in order to protect from light. 
The unopened blister may be stored outside the refrigerator below 25 °C for up to 24 hours. After 
opening the blister, proceed under aseptic conditions. 
6.5  Nature and contents of container  
Solution in pre-filled syringe (type I glass) marked with a dosing line, with a plunger stopper 
(elastomeric rubber) and a Luer lock adaptor with a tip cap (elastomeric rubber). Each pre-filled 
syringe contains an extractable volume of at least 0.09 mL. Pack size of 1 pre-filled syringe. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
The pre-filled syringe is for single use in one eye only. Extraction of multiple doses from a pre-filled 
syringe may increase the risk of contamination and subsequent infection. 
Do not open the sterile pre-filled syringe blister outside the clean administration room. Any unused 
medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements 
The pre-filled syringe contains more than the recommended dose of 2 mg aflibercept (equivalent to 
0.05 mL) for adult patients and 0.4 mg aflibercept (equivalent to 0.01 mL) for preterm infants. See 
following sections “Use in the adult population” and “Use in the paediatric population”.  
The solution should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or discolouration or 
any variation in physical appearance prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, 
discard the medicinal product. 
For the intravitreal injection, a 30 G x ½ inch injection needle should be used. 
Instructions for use of pre-filled syringe: 
Use in the paediatric population 
To prepare the pre-filled syringe for administration to preterm infants, follow the steps 1 and 2 below 
and then adhere to the instructions for use included in the package of the PICLEO paediatric dosing 
device.  
Use in the adult population 
To prepare the pre-filled syringe for administration to adults, follow all steps below. 
1.  When ready to administer Eylea, open the carton and remove the sterilised blister. Carefully peel open 
the blister ensuring the sterility of its contents. Keep the syringe in the sterile tray until you are ready 
for assembly. 
2.  Using aseptic technique, remove the syringe from the sterilised blister. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
To remove the syringe cap, hold the syringe in one hand while 
using the other hand to grasp the syringe cap with the thumb 
and fore finger. Please note: You should twist off (do not snap 
off) the syringe cap.  
4. 
To avoid compromising the sterility of the product, do not pull back on the plunger 
5.  Using aseptic technique, firmly twist the injection needle onto 
the Luer-lock syringe tip. 
6.  Holding the syringe with the needle pointing up, check the 
syringe for bubbles. If there are bubbles, gently tap the syringe 
with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7. 
The excess volume must be discarded prior to administration. Eliminate all bubbles and expel excess 
medicinal product by slowly depressing the plunger to align the base of the plunger dome (not 
the tip of the dome) with the dosing line on the syringe (equivalent to 0.05 mL i.e. 2 mg 
aflibercept). 
Note: This accurate positioning of the plunger is very important, because incorrect plunger 
positioning can lead to delivering more or less than the labelled dose. 
8. 
9.  
Inject while pressing the plunger carefully and with constant pressure. Do not apply additional 
pressure once the plunger has reached the bottom of the syringe. Do not administer any residual 
solution observed in the syringe. 
The pre-filled syringe is for single use only. Extraction of multiple doses from a pre-filled syringe may 
increase the risk of contamination and subsequent infection. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Eylea is indicated for adults for the treatment of  
• 
• 
neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (see section 5.1), 
visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO or 
central RVO) (see section 5.1),

4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Eylea is for intravitreal injection only. 
Eylea must only be administered by a qualified physician experienced in administering intravitreal 
injections. 
Posology 
wet AMD 
The recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg aflibercept, equivalent to 0.05 mL. 
Eylea treatment is initiated with one injection per month for three consecutive doses. The treatment 
interval is then extended to two months. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the physician’s judgement of visual and/or anatomic outcomes, the treatment interval may be 
maintained at two months or further extended using a treat-and-extend dosing regimen, where 
injection intervals are increased in 2- or 4-weekly increments to maintain stable visual and/or anatomic 
outcomes. 
If visual and/or anatomic outcomes deteriorate, the treatment interval should be shortened accordingly. 
There is no requirement for monitoring between injections. Based on the physician’s judgement the 
schedule of monitoring visits may be more frequent than the injection visits. 
Treatment intervals greater than four months or shorter than 4 weeks between injections have not been 
studied (see section 5.1). 
Macular oedema secondary to RVO (branch RVO or central RVO) 
The recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg aflibercept equivalent to 0.05 mL. 
After the initial injection, treatment is given monthly. The interval between two doses should not be 
shorter than one month. 
If visual and anatomic outcomes indicate that the patient is not benefiting from continued treatment, 
Eylea should be discontinued. 
Monthly treatment continues until maximum visual acuity is achieved and/or there are no signs of 
disease activity. Three or more consecutive, monthly injections may be needed. 
Treatment may then be continued with a treat-and-extend regimen with gradually increased treatment 
intervals to maintain stable visual and/or anatomic outcomes, however there are insufficient data to 
conclude on the length of these intervals. If visual and/or anatomic outcomes deteriorate, the treatment 
interval should be shortened accordingly. 
The monitoring and treatment schedule should be determined by the treating physician based on the 
individual patient’s response. 
Monitoring for disease activity may include clinical examination, functional testing or imaging 
techniques (e.g. optical coherence tomography or fluorescein angiography). 
Diabetic macular oedema 
The recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg aflibercept equivalent to 0.05 mL.  
Eylea treatment is initiated with one injection per month for five consecutive doses, followed by one 
injection every two months. 
Based on the physician’s judgement of visual and/or anatomic outcomes, the treatment interval may be 
maintained at 2 months or individualized, such as with a treat-and-extend dosing regimen, where the 
treatment intervals are usually increased by 2-week increments to maintain stable visual and/or 
anatomic outcomes. There are limited data for treatment intervals longer than 4 months. If visual 
and/or anatomic outcomes deteriorate, the treatment interval should be shortened accordingly. 
Treatment intervals shorter than 4 weeks have not been studied (see section 5.1). 
The schedule for monitoring should be determined by the treating physician. 
If visual and anatomic outcomes indicate that the patient is not benefiting from continued treatment, 
Eylea should be discontinued. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Myopic choroidal neovascularisation 
The recommended dose for Eylea is a single intravitreal injection of 2 mg aflibercept equivalent to 
0.05 mL. 
Additional doses may be administered if visual and/or anatomic outcomes indicate that the disease 
persists. Recurrences should be treated as a new manifestation of the disease. 
The schedule for monitoring should be determined by the treating physician. 
The interval between two doses should not be shorter than one month. 
Special populations 
Hepatic and/or renal impairment 
No specific studies in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment have been conducted with Eylea. 
Available data do not suggest a need for a dose adjustment with Eylea in these patients (see 
section 5.2). 
Elderly population 
No special considerations are needed. There is limited experience in patients older than 75 years with 
DME. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Eylea have not been established in children and adolescents. There is no 
relevant use of Eylea in the paediatric population for the indications of wet AMD, CRVO, BRVO, 
DME and myopic CNV. 
Method of administration 
Intravitreal injections must be carried out according to medical standards and applicable guidelines by 
a qualified physician experienced in administering intravitreal injections. In general, adequate 
anaesthesia and asepsis, including topical broad spectrum microbicide (e.g. povidone iodine applied to 
the periocular skin, eyelid and ocular surface), have to be ensured. Surgical hand disinfection, sterile 
gloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent) are recommended. 
The injection needle should be inserted 3.5-4.0 mm posterior to the limbus into the vitreous cavity, 
avoiding the horizontal meridian and aiming towards the centre of the globe. The injection volume of 
0.05 mL is then delivered; a different scleral site should be used for subsequent injections. 
Immediately following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in 
intraocular pressure. Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve 
head or tonometry. If required, sterile equipment for paracentesis should be available. 
Following intravitreal injection patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of 
endophthalmitis (e.g. eye pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without delay. 
Each vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. Extraction of multiple doses from a 
single vial may increase the risk of contamination and subsequent infection. 
The vial contains more than the recommended dose of 2 mg aflibercept (equivalent to 0.05 mL 
solution for injection). The extractable volume of the vial is the amount that can be withdrawn from 
the vial and is not to be used in total. For the Eylea vial, the extractable volume is at least 0.1 mL. The 
excess volume must be expelled before injecting the recommended dose (see section 6.6). 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Injecting the entire volume of the vial could result in overdose. To expel the air bubbles along with 
excess medicinal product, slowly depress the plunger so that the flat plunger edge aligns with the line 
that marks 0.05 mL on the syringe (equivalent to 0.05 mL i.e. 2 mg aflibercept) (see sections 4.9 
and 6.6). 
After injection any unused product must be discarded. 
For handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance aflibercept or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Active or suspected ocular or periocular infection. 
Active severe intraocular inflammation. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Intravitreal injection-related reactions  
Intravitreal injections, including those with Eylea, have been associated with endophthalmitis, 
intraocular inflammation, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, retinal tear and iatrogenic traumatic 
cataract (see section 4.8). Proper aseptic injection techniques must always be used when administering 
Eylea. In addition, patients should be monitored during the week following the injection to permit 
early treatment if an infection occurs. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive 
of endophthalmitis or any of the above mentioned events without delay. 
The vial contains more than the recommended dose of 2 mg aflibercept (equivalent to 0.05 mL). The 
excess volume must be discarded prior to administration (see sections 4.2 and 6.6). 
Increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including 
those with Eylea (see section 4.8). Special precaution is needed in patients with poorly controlled 
glaucoma (do not inject Eylea while the intraocular pressure is ≥ 30 mmHg). In all cases, both the 
intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head must therefore be monitored and 
managed appropriately. 
Immunogenicity 
As this is a therapeutic protein, there is a potential for immunogenicity with Eylea (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of intraocular inflammation, e.g. pain, 
photophobia, or redness, which may be a clinical sign attributable to hypersensitivity. 
Systemic effects 
Systemic adverse events including non-ocular haemorrhages and arterial thromboembolic events have 
been reported following intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors and there is a theoretical risk that 
these may relate to VEGF inhibition. There are limited data on safety in the treatment of patients with 
CRVO, BRVO, DME or myopic CNV with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attacks or 
myocardial infarction within the last 6 months. Caution should be exercised when treating such 
patients. 
Other 
As with other intravitreal anti-VEGF treatments for AMD, CRVO, BRVO, DME and myopic CNV 
the following also applies: 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  The safety and efficacy of Eylea therapy administered to both eyes concurrently have not been 
systematically studied (see section 5.1). If bilateral treatment is performed at the same time this 
could lead to an increased systemic exposure, which could increase the risk of systemic adverse 
events. 
•  Concomitant use of other anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) 
•  There is no data available on the concomitant use of Eylea with other anti-VEGF medicinal 
products (systemic or ocular). 
•  Risk factors associated with the development of a retinal pigment epithelial tear after anti-
VEGF therapy for wet AMD, include a large and/or high pigment epithelial retinal detachment. 
When initiating Eylea therapy, caution should be used in patients with these risk factors for 
retinal pigment epithelial tears. 
•  Treatment should be withheld in patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or stage 3 
or 4 macular holes. 
•  In the event of a retinal break the dose should be withheld and treatment should not be resumed 
until the break is adequately repaired. 
•  The dose should be withheld and treatment should not be resumed earlier than the next 
scheduled treatment in the event of: 
o  a decrease in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of ≥30 letters compared with the 
last assessment of visual acuity; 
o  a subretinal haemorrhage involving the centre of the fovea, or, if the size of the 
haemorrhage is ≥50%, of the total lesion area. 
•  The dose should be withheld within the previous or next 28 days in the event of a performed or 
planned intraocular surgery. 
•  Eylea should not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk 
to the foetus (see section 4.6). 
•  Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at 
least 3 months after the last intravitreal injection of aflibercept (see section 4.6). 
•  There is limited experience with treatment of patients with ischaemic CRVO and BRVO. In 
patients presenting with clinical signs of irreversible ischaemic visual function loss, the 
treatment is not recommended. 
Populations with limited data 
There is only limited experience in the treatment of subjects with DME due to type I diabetes or in 
diabetic patients with an HbA1c over 12% or with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. 
Eylea has not been studied in patients with active systemic infections or in patients with concurrent 
eye conditions such as retinal detachment or macular hole. There is also no experience of treatment 
with Eylea in diabetic patients with uncontrolled hypertension. This lack of information should be 
considered by the physician when treating such patients.  
In myopic CNV there is no experience with Eylea in the treatment of non-Asian patients, patients who 
have previously undergone treatment for myopic CNV, and patients with extrafoveal lesions.  
Information about excipients 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say essentially 
’sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Adjunctive use of verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) and Eylea has not been studied, therefore, 
a safety profile is not established. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 
3 months after the last intravitreal injection of aflibercept (see section 4.4). 
Pregnancy 
There are no data on the use of aflibercept in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown embryo-foetal toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Although the systemic exposure after ocular administration is very low, Eylea should not be used 
during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
Based on very limited human data, aflibercept may be excreted in human milk at low levels. 
Aflibercept is a large protein molecule and the amount of medication absorbed by the infant is 
expected to be minimal. The effects of aflibercept on a breast-fed newborn/infant are unknown.  
As a precautionary measure, breast-feeding is not recommended during the use of Eylea. 
Fertility 
Results from animal studies with high systemic exposure indicate that aflibercept can impair male and 
female fertility (see section 5.3). Such effects are not expected after ocular administration with very 
low systemic exposure. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Injection with Eylea has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to possible 
temporary visual disturbances associated either with the injection or the eye examination. Patients 
should not drive or use machines until their visual function has recovered sufficiently. 
4.8 
Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
A total of 3,102 patients constituted the safety population in the eight phase III studies. Among those, 
2,501 patients were treated with the recommended dose of 2 mg. 
Serious ocular adverse reactions in the study eye related to the injection procedure have occurred in 
less than 1 in 1,900 intravitreal injections with Eylea and included blindness, endophthalmitis, retinal 
detachment, cataract traumatic, cataract, vitreous haemorrhage, vitreous detachment, and intraocular 
pressure increased (see section 4.4). 
The most frequently observed adverse reactions (in at least 5% of patients treated with Eylea) were 
conjunctival haemorrhage (25%), retinal haemorrhage (11%), visual acuity reduced (11%), eye 
pain (10%), cataract (8%), intraocular pressure increased (8%), vitreous detachment (7%), and 
vitreous floaters (7%).  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety data described below include all adverse reactions from the eight phase III studies in the

cases of severe anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
In the wet AMD phase III studies, there was an increased incidence of conjunctival haemorrhage in 
patients receiving anti-thrombotic agents. This increased incidence was comparable between patients 
treated with ranibizumab and Eylea. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) are adverse events potentially related to systemic VEGF 
inhibition. There is a theoretical risk of arterial thromboembolic events, including stroke and 
myocardial infarction, following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. 
A low incidence rate of arterial thromboembolic events was observed in the Eylea clinical trials in 
patients with AMD, DME, RVO and myopic CNV. Across indications no notable difference between 
the groups treated with aflibercept and the respective comparator groups were observed. 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with Eylea. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9   Overdose 
In clinical trials, doses of up to 4 mg in monthly intervals have been used and isolated cases of 
overdoses with 8 mg occurred. 
Overdosing with increased injection volume may increase intraocular pressure. Therefore, in case of 
overdose, intraocular pressure should be monitored and if deemed necessary by the treating physician, 
adequate treatment should be initiated (see section 6.6).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals / Antineovascularisation agents 
ATC code: S01LA05 
Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF receptor 1 and 2 
extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1. 
Aflibercept is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells by recombinant DNA technology. 
Aflibercept acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF-A and PlGF with higher affinity than 
their natural receptors, and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF 
receptors. 
Mechanism of action 
Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are members of 
the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as potent mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular 
permeability factors for endothelial cells. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases; VEGFR-1 and 
VEGFR-2, present on the surface of endothelial cells. PlGF binds only to VEGFR-1, which is also 
present on the surface of leucocytes. Excessive activation of these receptors by VEGF-A can result in 
pathological neovascularisation and excessive vascular permeability. PlGF can synergize with VEGF-
A in these processes, and is also known to promote leucocyte infiltration and vascular inflammation. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
wet AMD 
Wet AMD is characterised by pathological choroidal neovascularisation (CNV). Leakage of blood and 
fluid from CNV may cause retinal thickening or oedema and/or sub-/intra-retinal haemorrhage, 
resulting in loss of visual acuity. 
In patients treated with Eylea (one injection per month for three consecutive months, followed by one 
injection every 2 months), central retinal thickness [CRT] decreased soon after treatment initiation, 
and the mean CNV lesion size was reduced, consistent with the results seen with ranibizumab 0.5 mg 
every month. 
In the VIEW1 study there were mean decreases in CRT on optical coherence tomography (OCT) (-130 
and -129 microns at week 52 for the Eylea 2 mg every two months and ranibizumab 0.5 mg every 
month study groups, respectively). Also at the 52 week time point, in the VIEW2 study there were 
mean decreases in CRT on OCT (-149 and -139 microns for the Eylea 2 mg every two months and 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg every month study groups, respectively). The reduction of CNV size and 
reduction in CRT were generally maintained in the second year of the studies. 
The ALTAIR study was conducted in Japanese patients with treatment naïve wet AMD, showing 
similar outcomes to the VIEW studies using 3 initial monthly Eylea 2 mg injections, followed by one 
injection after a further 2 months, and then continued with a treat-and-extend regimen with variable 
treatment intervals (2-week or 4-week adjustments) up to a maximum 16 week interval according to 
pre-specified criteria. At week 52, there were mean decreases in central retinal thickness (CRT) on 
OCT of -134.4 and –126.1 microns for the 2-week adjustment group and the 4-week adjustment group, 
respectively. The proportion of patients without fluid on OCT at week 52 was 68.3% and 69.1% in the 
2- and 4-week adjustment groups, respectively. The reduction in CRT was generally maintained in 
both treatment arms in the second year of the ALTAIR study. 
The ARIES study was designed to explore the non-inferiority of an Eylea 2 mg treat-and-extend dosing 
regimen initiated immediately after administration of 3 initial monthly injections and one additional 
injection after 2 months vs. a treat-and-extend dosing regimen initiated after one year of treatment. For 
patients requiring a more frequent than Q8 dosing at least once over the course of the study, CRT 
remained higher, but the mean decrease in CRT from baseline to week 104 was -160.4 microns, similar 
to the patients treated at Q8 or less frequent intervals. 
Macular oedema secondary to CRVO and BRVO 
In CRVO and BRVO, retinal ischaemia occurs and signals the release of VEGF which in turn 
destabilises the tight junctions and promotes endothelial cell proliferation. Up-regulation of VEGF is 
associated with the breakdown of the blood retina barrier, increased vascular permeability, retinal 
oedema, and neovascularisation complications. 
In patients treated with 6 consecutive monthly injections of Eylea 2 mg, there was a consistent, rapid 
and robust morphologic response (as measured by improvements in mean CRT) observed. At week 24, 
the reduction in CRT was statistically superior versus control in all three studies (COPERNICUS in 
CRVO: -457 vs. -145 microns; GALILEO in CRVO: -449 vs. -169 microns; VIBRANT in BRVO: -
280 vs. -128 microns). This decrease from baseline in CRT was maintained to the end of each study, 
week 100 in COPERNICUS, week 76 in GALILEO, and week 52 in VIBRANT. 
Diabetic macular oedema 
Diabetic macular oedema is a consequence of diabetic retinopathy and is characterised by increased 
vasopermeability and damage to the retinal capillaries which may result in loss of visual acuity.  
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients treated with Eylea, the majority of whom were classified as having Type II diabetes, a rapid 
and robust response in morphology (CRT, DRSS level) was observed. 
In the VIVIDDME and the VISTADME studies, a statistically significant greater mean decrease in CRT 
from baseline to week 52 was observed in patients treated with Eylea than with the laser control, -
192.4 and -183.1 microns for the 2Q8 Eylea groups and -66.2 and -73.3 microns for the control 
groups, respectively. At week 100 the decrease was maintained with -195.8 and -191.1 microns for the 
2Q8 Eylea groups and -85.7 and -83.9 microns for the control groups, in the VIVIDDME and 
VISTADME studies, respectively. 
A ≥2 step improvement in DRSS was assessed in a pre-specified manner in VIVIDDME and VISTADME. 
The DRSS score was gradable in 73.7% of the patients in VIVIDDME and 98.3% of the patients in 
VISTADME. At week 52, 27.7% and 29.1% of the Eylea 2Q8 groups, and 7.5% and 14.3% of the 
control groups experienced a ≥2 step improvement in the DRSS. At week 100, the respective 
percentages were 32.6% and 37.1% of the Eylea 2Q8 groups and 8.2% and 15.6% of the control 
groups. 
The VIOLET study compared three different dosing regimens of Eylea 2 mg for treatment of DME 
after at least one year of treatment at fixed intervals, where treatment was initiated with 5 consecutive 
monthly doses followed by dosing every 2 months. At week 52 and week 100 of the study, i.e. second 
and third year of treatment, the mean changes in CRT were clinically similar for treat-and-extend 
(2T&E), pro re nata (2PRN) and 2Q8, respectively, -2.1, 2.2 and -18.8 microns at week 52, and 
2.3, -13.9 and -15.5 microns at week 100. 
Myopic choroidal neovascularisation 
Myopic choroidal neovascularisation (myopic CNV) is a frequent cause of vision loss in adults with 
pathologic myopia. It develops as a wound healing mechanism consequent to Bruch’s membrane 
ruptures and represents the most vision-threatening event in pathologic myopia. 
In patients treated with Eylea in the MYRROR study (one injection given at start of therapy, with 
additional injections given in case of disease persistence or recurrence), CRT decreased soon after 
treatment initiation favouring Eylea at week 24 (-79 microns and -4 microns for the Eylea 2 mg 
treatment group and the control group, respectively), which was maintained through week 48. In 
addition, the mean CNV lesion size decreased. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
wet AMD 
The safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in two randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, 
active-controlled studies in patients with wet AMD (VIEW1 and VIEW2) with a. total of 
2,412 patients treated and evaluable for efficacy (1,817 with Eylea). Patient ages ranged from 49 to 
99 years with a mean of 76 years. In these clinical studies, approximately 89% (1,616/1,817) of the 
patients randomised to treatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or older, and approximately 
63% (1,139/1,817) were 75 years of age or older. In each study, patients were randomly assigned in a 
1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 4 dosing regimens: 
1) Eylea administered at 2 mg every 8 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses (Eylea 2Q8); 
2) Eylea administered at 2 mg every 4 weeks (Eylea 2Q4); 
3) Eylea administered at 0.5 mg every 4 weeks (Eylea 0.5Q4); and 
4) ranibizumab administered at 0.5 mg every 4 weeks (ranibizumab 0.5Q4). 
In the second year of the studies, patients continued to receive the initially randomised dosage but on a 
modified dosing schedule guided by assessment of visual and anatomic outcomes with a protocol-
defined maximum dosing interval of 12 weeks. 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in the Per Protocol Set 
who maintained vision, i.e. losing fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at week 52 from baseline.  
In the VIEW1 study, at week 52, 95.1% of patients in the Eylea 2Q8 group maintained vision 
compared to 94.4% patients in the ranibizumab 0.5Q4 group. In the VIEW2 study, at week 52, 95.6% 
of patients in the Eylea 2Q8 group maintained vision compared to 94.4% patients in the ranibizumab 
0.5Q4 group. In both studies Eylea was shown to be non-inferior and clinically equivalent to the 
ranibizumab 0.5Q4 group. 
Detailed results from the combined analysis of both studies are shown in Table 2 and Figure 1 below.

Figure 1. Mean Change in Visual Acuity 
from Baseline to Week 96 for the Combined 
Data from the View1 and View2 Studies 
In combined data analysis of VIEW1 and VIEW2 Eylea demonstrated clinically meaningful changes 
from baseline in pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoint National Eye Institute Visual Function 
Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) without clinically meaningful differences to ranibizumab. The 
magnitude of these changes was similar to that seen in published studies, which corresponded to 
a 15-letter gain in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA). 
In the second year of the studies, efficacy was generally maintained through the last assessment at 
week 96, and 2-4% of patients required all injections on a monthly basis, and a third of patients 
required at least one injection with a treatment interval of only one month. 
Decreases in mean CNV area were evident in all dose groups in both studies. 
Efficacy results in all evaluable subgroups (e.g. age, gender, race, baseline visual acuity, lesion type, 
lesion size) in each study and in the combined analysis were consistent with the results in the overall 
populations. 
ALTAIR was a 96 week multicentre, randomised, open-label study in 247 Japanese patients with 
treatment naïve wet AMD, designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Eylea following two different 
adjustment intervals (2-weeks and 4-weeks) of a treat-and-extend dosing regimen. 
All patients received monthly doses of Eylea 2 mg for 3 months, followed by one injection after a 
further 2 month interval. At week 16, patients were randomised 1:1 into two treatment groups: 1) 
Eylea treat-and-extend with 2-week adjustments and 2) Eylea treat-and-extend with 4-week 
adjustments. Extension or shortening of the treatment interval was decided based on visual and/or 
anatomic criteria defined by protocol with a maximum treatment interval of 16 weeks for both groups. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change in BCVA from baseline to week 52. The secondary 
efficacy endpoints were the proportion of patients who did not lose ≥15 letters and the proportion of 
patients who gained at least 15 letters of BCVA from baseline to week 52. 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At week 52, patients in the treat-and-extend arm with 2-week adjustments gained a mean of 9.0 letters 
from baseline as compared to 8.4 letters for those in the 4-week adjustment group [LS mean difference 
in letters (95% CI): -0.4 (-3.8,3.0), ANCOVA]. The proportion of patients who did not lose ≥15 letters 
in the two treatment arms was similar (96.7% in the 2-week and 95.9% in the 4-week adjustment 
groups). The proportion of patients who gained ≥15 letters at week 52 was 32.5% in the 2-week 
adjustment group and 30.9% in the 4-week adjustment group. The proportion of patients who extended 
their treatment interval to 12 weeks or beyond was 42.3% in the 2-week adjustment group and 49.6% 
in the 4-week adjustment group. Furthermore, in the 4-week adjustment group 40.7% of patients were 
extended to 16 week intervals. At the last visit up to week 52, 56. 8% and 57.8% of patients in the 
2-week and 4-week adjustment groups, respectively had their next injection scheduled at an interval of 
12 weeks or beyond. 
In the second year of the study, efficacy was generally maintained up to and including the last 
assessment at week 96, with a mean gain from baseline of 7.6 letters for the 2-week adjustment group 
and 6.1 letters for the 4-week adjustment group. The proportion of patients who extended their 
treatment interval to 12 weeks or beyond was 56.9% in the 2-week adjustment group and 60.2% in the 
4-week adjustment group. At the last visit prior to week 96, 64.9% and 61.2% of patients in the 
2-week and 4-week adjustment groups, respectively had their next injection scheduled at an interval of 
12 weeks or beyond. During the second year of treatment patients in both the 2-week and 4-week 
adjustment groups received an average of 3.6 and 3.7 injections, respectively. Over the 2 year 
treatment period patients received an average of 10.4 injections. 
Ocular and systemic safety profiles were similar to the safety observed in the pivotal studies VIEW1 
and VIEW2. 
ARIES was a 104-week multicentre, randomised, open-label, active-controlled study in 269 patients 
with treatment naïve wet AMD, designed to assess the non-inferiority in terms of efficacy as well as 
the safety of a treat-and-extend dosing regimen initiated after 3 consecutive monthly doses followed 
by extension to a 2 monthly treatment interval vs. a treat-and-extend dosing regimen initiated after the 
first year of treatment. 
The ARIES study also explored the percentage of patients that required more frequent treatment than 
every 8 weeks based on the investigator’s decision. Out of the 269 patients 62 patients received more 
frequent dosing at least once during the course of the study. Such patients remained in the study and 
received treatment according to the investigator’s best clinical judgement but not more frequently than 
every 4 weeks and their treatment intervals could be extended again afterwards. The average treatment 
interval after the decision to treat more frequently was 6.1 weeks. Week 104 BCVA was lower in 
patients requiring more intensive treatment at least once over the course of the study compared with 
patients who did not and the mean change in BCVA from baseline to end of the study was 
+2.3 ± 15.6 letters. Among the patients treated more frequently, 85.5% maintained vision, i.e. lost less 
than15 letters, and 19.4% gained 15 letters or more. The safety profile of patients treated more 
frequently than every 8 weeks was comparable to the safety data in VIEW 1 and VIEW 2. 
Macular oedema secondary to CRVO 
The safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in two randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, 
sham-controlled studies in patients with macular oedema secondary to CRVO (COPERNICUS and 
GALILEO) with a total of 358 patients treated and evaluable for efficacy (217 with Eylea). Patient 
ages ranged from 22 to 89 years with a mean of 64 years. In the CRVO studies, approximately 52% 
(112/217) of the patients randomised to treatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or older, and 
approximately 18% (38/217) were 75 years of age or older. In both studies, patients were randomly 
assigned in a 3:2 ratio to either 2 mg Eylea administered every 4 weeks (2Q4), or the control group 
receiving sham injections every 4 weeks for a total of 6 injections. 
After 6 consecutive monthly injections, patients received treatment only if they met pre-specified 
retreatment criteria, except for patients in the control group in the GALILEO study who continued to 
receive sham (control to control) until week 52. From this timepoint all patients were treated if pre-
specified criteria were met. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who gained at least 
15 letters in BCVA at week 24 compared to baseline. A secondary efficacy variable was change in 
visual acuity at week 24 compared to baseline. 
The difference between treatment groups was statistically significant in favour of Eylea in both 
studies. The maximal improvement in visual acuity was achieved at month 3 with subsequent 
stabilisation of visual acuity and CRT until month 6. The statistically significant difference was 
maintained through week 52. 
Detailed results from the analysis of both studies are shown in Table 3 and Figure 2 below.

Figure 2:  
Mean Change from Baseline to Week 76/100 in Visual Acuity by Treatment Group 
for the COPERNICUS and GALILEO Studies (Full Analysis Set) 
In GALILEO, 86.4% (n=89) of the Eylea group and 79.4% (n=54) of the sham group had perfused 
CRVO at baseline. At week 24, this was 91.8% (n=89) in the Eylea group and 85.5% (n=47) in the 
sham group. These proportions were maintained at week 76, with 84.3% (n=75) in the Eylea group 
and 84.0% (n=42) in the sham group. 
50 
 
 
In COPERNICUS, 67.5% (n = 77) of the Eylea group and 68.5% (n = 50) of the sham group had 
perfused CRVO at baseline. At week 24, this was 87.4% (n = 90) in the Eylea group and 58.6% 
(n = 34) in the sham group. These proportions were maintained at week 100 with 76.8% (n = 76) in the 
Eylea group and 78% (n = 39) in the sham group. Patients in the sham group were eligible to receive 
Eylea from week 24. 
The beneficial effect of Eylea treatment on visual function was similar in the baseline subgroups of 
perfused and non-perfused patients. Treatment effects in other evaluable subgroups (e.g. age, gender, 
race, baseline visual acuity, CRVO duration) in each study were in general consistent with the results 
in the overall populations. 
In combined data analysis of GALILEO and COPERNICUS, Eylea demonstrated clinically 
meaningful changes from baseline in pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoint National Eye Institute 
Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25). The magnitude of these changes was similar to that 
seen in published studies, which corresponded to a 15-letter gain in Best Corrected Visual Acuity 
(BCVA). 
Macular oedema secondary to BRVO 
The safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in a randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, active-
controlled study in patients with macular oedema secondary to BRVO (VIBRANT) which included 
Hemi-Retinal Vein Occlusion. A total of 181 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy (91 with 
Eylea). Patient ages ranged from 42 to 94 years with a mean of 65 years. In the BRVO study, 
approximately 58% (53/91) of the patients randomised to treatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or 
older, and approximately 23% (21/91) were 75 years of age or older. In the study, patients were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either 2 mg Eylea administered every 8 weeks following 6 initial 
monthly injections or laser photocoagulation administered at baseline (laser control group). Patients in 
the laser control group could receive additional laser photocoagulation (called ‘rescue laser treatment’) 
beginning at week 12 with a minimum interval of 12 weeks. Based on pre-specified criteria, patients in 
the laser group could receive rescue treatment with Eylea 2 mg from week 24, administered every 
4 weeks for 3 months followed by every 8 weeks. 
In the VIBRANT study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who gained at 
least 15 letters in BCVA at week 24 compared to baseline and the Eylea group was superior to laser 
control. 
A secondary efficacy endpoint was change in visual acuity at week 24 compared to baseline, which 
was statistically significant in favour of Eylea in the VIBRANT study. The course of visual 
improvement was rapid and peaked at 3 months with maintenance of the effect until month 12. 
In the laser group 67 patients received rescue treatment with Eylea beginning at week 24 (Active 
Control/ Eylea 2 mg group), which resulted in improvement of visual acuity by about 5 letters from 
week 24 to 52. 
Detailed results from the analysis of the VIBRANT study are shown in Table 4 and Figure 3 below.

At baseline, the proportion of perfused patients in the Eylea and laser groups was 60% and 68%, 
respectively. At week 24 these proportions were 80% and 67%, respectively. In the Eylea group the 
proportion of perfused patients was maintained through week 52. In the laser group, where patients 
were eligible for rescue treatment with Eylea from week 24, the proportion of perfused patients 
increased to 78% by week 52.  
Diabetic macular oedema 
The safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in two randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, 
active-controlled studies in patients with DME (VIVIDDME and VISTADME). A total of 862 patients 
were treated and evaluable for efficacy, 576 with Eylea. Patient ages ranged from 23 to 87 years with a 
mean of 63 years. In the DME studies, approximately 47% (268/576) of the patients randomised to 
treatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or older, and approximately 9% (52/576) were 75 years of 
age or older. The majority of patients in both studies had Type II diabetes. 
In both studies, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dosing regimens: 
1) Eylea administered 2 mg every 8 weeks following 5 initial monthly injections (Eylea 2Q8); 
2) Eylea administered 2 mg every 4 weeks (Eylea 2Q4); and 
3) macular laser photocoagulation (active control).  
Beginning at week 24, patients meeting a pre-specified threshold of vision loss were eligible to receive 
additional treatment: patients in the Eylea groups could receive laser and patients in the control group 
could receive Eylea. 
In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in BCVA at 
week 52 and both Eylea 2Q8 and Eylea 2Q4 groups demonstrated statistical significance and were 
superior to the control group. This benefit was maintained through week 100.

Treatment effects in evaluable subgroups (e.g., age, gender, race, baseline HbA1c, baseline visual 
acuity, prior anti-VEGF therapy) in each study and in the combined analysis were generally consistent 
with the results in the overall populations. 
In the VIVIDDME and VISTADME studies, 36 (9%) and 197 (43%) patients received prior anti-VEGF 
therapy, respectively, with a 3-month or longer washout period. Treatment effects in the subgroup of 
patients who had previously been treated with a VEGF inhibitor were similar to those seen in patients 
who were VEGF inhibitor naïve. 
Patients with bilateral disease were eligible to receive anti-VEGF treatment in their fellow eye if 
assessed necessary by the physician. In the VISTADME study, 217 (70.7%) of Eylea patients received 
bilateral Eylea injections until week100; in the VIVIDDME study, 97 (35.8%) of Eylea patients received 
a different anti-VEGF treatment in their fellow eye. 
An independent comparative trial (DRCR.net Protocol T) utilised a flexible dosing regimen based on 
strict OCT and vision re-treatment criteria. In the aflibercept treatment group (n = 224) at week 52, 
this treatment regimen resulted in patients receiving a mean of 9.2 injections, which is similar to the 
administered number of doses in the Eylea 2Q8 group in VIVIDDME and VISTADME, while overall 
efficacy of the aflibercept treatment group in Protocol T was comparable to the Eylea 2Q8 group in 
VIVIDDME and VISTADME. A 13.3 mean letter gain with 42% of patients gaining at least 15 letters in 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vision from baseline was observed in Protocol T. Safety outcomes demonstrated that overall 
incidences of ocular and non-ocular adverse events (including ATEs) were comparable across all 
treatment groups in each of the studies and between the studies. 
VIOLET, a 100-week multicentre, randomised, open-label, active controlled study in patients with 
DME compared three different dosing regimens of Eylea 2 mg for treatment of DME after at least one 
year of treatment at fixed intervals, where treatment was initiated with 5 consecutive monthly doses 
followed by dosing every 2 months. The study evaluated non-inferiority of Eylea 2 mg dosed 
according to a treat-and-extend regimen (2T&E where injections intervals were kept at a minimum of 
8 weeks and gradually extended based on clinical and anatomical outcomes) and Eylea 2 mg dosed as 
needed (2PRN where patients were observed every 4 weeks and injected when needed based on 
clinical and anatomical outcomes), compared to Eylea 2 mg dosed every 8 weeks (2Q8) for the second 
and third year of treatment. 
The primary efficacy endpoint (change in BCVA from baseline to week 52) was 0.5 ± 6.7 letters in the 
2T&E group and 1.7 ± 6.8 letters in the 2PRN group compared to 0.4 ± 6.7 letters in the 2Q8 group, 
achieving statistical non-inferiority (p<0.0001 for both comparisons; NI margin 4 letters). The changes 
in BCVA from baseline to week 100 were consistent with the week 52 results: -0.1 ± 9.1 letters in the 
2T&E group and 1.8 ± 9.0 letters in the 2PRN group compared to 0.1 ± 7.2 letters in the 2Q8 group. 
The mean number of injections over 100 weeks were 12.3, 10.0 and 11.5 for 2Q8fix, 2T&E and 
2PRN, respectively. 
Ocular and systemic safety profiles in all 3 treatment groups were similar to those observed in the 
pivotal studies VIVID and VISTA. 
In the 2T&E group, the increments and decrements for the injection intervals were at the investigator’s 
discretion; increments of 2 weeks were recommended in the study. 
Myopic choroidal neovascularisation 
The safety and efficacy of Eylea were assessed in a randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, sham-
controlled study in treatment-naïve, Asian patients with myopic CNV. A total of 121 patients were 
treated and evaluable for efficacy (90 with Eylea). Patient ages ranged from 27 to 83 years with a 
mean of 58 years. In the myopic CNV study, approximately 36% (33/91) of the patients randomised to 
treatment with Eylea were 65 years of age or older, and approximately 10% (9/91) were 75 years of 
age or older. 
Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either 2 mg Eylea intravitreally or sham 
injections administered once at study start with additional injections given monthly in case of disease 
persistence or recurrence until week 24, when the primary endpoint was assessed. At week 24, patients 
initially randomised to sham were eligible to receive the first dose of Eylea. Following this, patients in 
both groups continued to be eligible for additional injections in case of disease persistence or 
recurrence. 
The difference between treatment groups was statistically significant in favour of Eylea for the 
primary endpoint (change in BCVA) and confirmatory secondary efficacy endpoint (proportion of 
patients who gained 15 letters in BCVA) at week 24 compared to baseline. Differences for both 
endpoints were maintained through week 48. 
Detailed results from the analysis of the MYRROR study are shown in Table 6 and Figure 5 below.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Eylea 
in all subsets of the paediatric population in wet AMD, CRVO, BRVO, DME and myopic CNV 
populations (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Eylea is administered directly into the vitreous to exert local effects in the eye. 
Absorption / Distribution 
Aflibercept is slowly absorbed from the eye into the systemic circulation after intravitreal 
administration and is predominately observed in the systemic circulation as an inactive, stable 
complex with VEGF; however only “free aflibercept” is able to bind endogenous VEGF. 
In a pharmacokinetic sub-study in 6 neovascular wet AMD patients with frequent sampling, maximum 
plasma concentrations of free aflibercept (systemic Cmax) were low, with a mean of approximately 
0.02 microgram/mL (range 0 to 0.054) within 1 to 3 days after a 2 mg intravitreal injection, and were 
undetectable two weeks following dosage in almost all patients. Aflibercept does not accumulate in 
the plasma when administered intravitreally every 4 weeks. 
The mean maximum plasma concentration of free aflibercept is approximately 50 to 500 times below 
the aflibercept concentration required to inhibit the biologic activity of systemic VEGF by 50% in 
animal models, in which blood pressure changes were observed after circulating levels of free 
aflibercept attained approximately 10 microgram/mL and returned to baseline when levels fell below 
approximately 1 microgram/mL. It is estimated that after intravitreal administration of 2 mg to 
patients, the mean maximum plasma concentration of free aflibercept is more than 100-fold lower than 
the concentration of aflibercept required to half-maximally bind systemic VEGF (2.91 microgram/mL) 
in a study of healthy volunteers. Therefore, systemic pharmacodynamic effects such as blood pressure 
changes are unlikely. 
In pharmacokinetic sub-studies in patients with CRVO, BRVO, DME or myopic CNV mean Cmax of 
free aflibercept in plasma were similar with values in the range of 0.03 to 0.05 microgram/mL and 
individual values not exceeding 0.14 microgram/mL. Thereafter, plasma concentrations of free 
aflibercept declined to values below or close to the lower limit of quantitation generally within one 
week; undetectable concentrations were reached before the next administration after 4 weeks in all 
patients. 
Elimination 
As Eylea is a protein-based therapeutic, no metabolism studies have been conducted. 
Free aflibercept binds VEGF to form a stable, inert complex. As with other large proteins, both free 
and bound aflibercept are expected to be cleared by proteolytic catabolism. 
Renal impairment 
No special studies in patients with renal impairment have been conducted with Eylea. 
Pharmacokinetic analysis of patients in the VIEW2 study, of which 40% had renal impairment 
(24% mild, 15% moderate, and 1% severe), revealed no differences with respect to plasma 
concentrations of active drug after intravitreal administration every 4 or 8 weeks. 
Similar results were seen in patients with CRVO in the GALILEO study, in patients with DME in the 
VIVIDDME study, and in patients with myopic CNV in the MYRROR study.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Effects in non-clinical studies on repeated dose toxicity were observed only at systemic exposures 
considered substantially in excess of the maximum human exposure after intravitreal administration at 
the intended clinical dose indicating little relevance to clinical use. 
Erosions and ulcerations of the respiratory epithelium in nasal turbinates in monkeys treated with 
aflibercept intravitreally were observed at systemic exposures in excess of the maximum human 
exposure. The systemic exposure based on Cmax and AUC for free aflibercept were approximately 
200 and 700-fold higher, respectively, when compared to corresponding values observed in humans 
after an intravitreal dose of 2 mg. At the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 0.5 mg/eye 
in monkeys the systemic exposure was 42- and 56-fold higher based on Cmax and AUC, respectively. 
No studies have been conducted on the mutagenic or carcinogenic potential of aflibercept. 
An effect of aflibercept on intrauterine development was shown in embryo-foetal development studies 
in pregnant rabbits with intravenous (3 to 60 mg/kg) as well as subcutaneous (0.1 to 1 mg/kg) 
administration. The maternal NOAEL was at the dose of 3 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg, respectively. A 
developmental NOAEL was not identified. At the 0.1 mg/kg dose, the systemic exposures based on 
Cmax and cumulative AUC for free aflibercept were approximately 17- and 10-fold higher, 
respectively, when compared to corresponding values observed in humans after an intravitreal dose of 
2 mg. 
Effects on male and female fertility were assessed as part of a 6-month study in monkeys with 
intravenous administration of aflibercept at doses ranging from 3 to 30 mg/kg. Absent or irregular 
menses associated with alterations in female reproductive hormone levels and changes in sperm 
morphology and motility were observed at all dose levels. Based on Cmax and AUC for free aflibercept 
observed at the 3 mg/kg intravenous dose, the systemic exposures were approximately 4,900-fold and 
1,500-fold higher, respectively, than the exposure observed in humans after an intravitreal dose of 
2 mg. All changes were reversible.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Solution for injection (injection) 
Clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to pale yellow, iso-osmotic solution, pH 5.8. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Eylea is indicated in adults for the treatment of 
- 
- 
neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) (see section 5.1) 
visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Eylea must only be administered by a qualified physician experienced in intravitreal injections. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 8 mg aflibercept, equivalent to 0.07 ml solution. The posology is the same 
for the nAMD and DME indications. The 8 mg dose requires use of the Eylea 114.3 mg/ml vial. 
Eylea treatment is initiated with 1 injection per month for 3 consecutive doses. Injection intervals may 
then be extended up to every 4 months based on the physician’s judgement of visual and/or anatomic 
outcomes. Subsequently, the treatment intervals may be further extended up to 5 months, such as with 
a treat-and-extend dosing regimen, while maintaining stable visual and/or anatomic outcomes (see 
section 5.1). 
If visual and/or anatomic outcomes deteriorate, the treatment interval should be shortened accordingly 
based on the physician’s discretion. The shortest interval between 2 injections is 2 months in the 
maintenance phase. 
Eylea at monthly doses of 8 mg has not been studied for more than 3 consecutive doses. 
The frequency of monitoring visits should be based on the patient’s status and at the physician’s 
discretion. For events in which treatment should be withheld see section 4.4.

Special populations 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
No specific studies in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have been conducted. 
Available data do not suggest a need for a dose adjustment with Eylea in these patients (see 
section 5.2). 
Elderly 
Available data do not suggest a need for a dose adjustment with Eylea in these patients. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Eylea 114.3 mg/ml in children and adolescents below 18 years have not 
been established. There is no relevant use of Eylea 114.3 mg/ml in the paediatric population in the 
nAMD and DME indications. 
Method of administration  
Eylea is for intravitreal injection only. 
Intravitreal injections must be carried out according to medical standards and applicable guidelines by 
a qualified physician experienced in administering intravitreal injections. In general, adequate 
anaesthesia and asepsis, including topical broad spectrum microbicide (e.g. povidone iodine applied to 
the periocular skin, eyelid and ocular surface), have to be ensured. Surgical hand disinfection, sterile 
gloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent) are recommended. 
The injection needle should be inserted 3.5 to 4.0 mm posterior to the limbus into the vitreous cavity, 
avoiding the horizontal meridian and aiming towards the centre of the globe. The injection volume of 
0.07 ml is then delivered. A different scleral site should be used for subsequent injections. 
Immediately following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in 
intraocular pressure. Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve 
head or tonometry. If required, sterile equipment for paracentesis should be available. 
Following intravitreal injection, patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of 
endophthalmitis (e.g. eye pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without delay. 
Each vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye.  
After injection, discard any unused product or waste material in accordance with local requirements. 
For handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
- 
- 
- 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Ocular or periocular infection. 
Active severe intraocular inflammation. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Intravitreal injection-related reactions  
Intravitreal injections, including those with Eylea, have been associated with endophthalmitis, 
intraocular inflammation, retinal detachment, retinal tear and traumatic cataract (see section 4.8). 
Proper aseptic injection techniques must always be used when administering Eylea. Patients should be 
instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or any of the above mentioned events 
without delay and should be managed appropriately.  
Intraocular pressure increased  
Transient increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of an intravitreal 
injection, including those with Eylea (see section 4.8). Both the intraocular pressure and perfusion of 
the optic nerve head must therefore be monitored and managed appropriately. Special precaution is 
needed in patients with poorly controlled glaucoma (do not inject Eylea while the intraocular pressure 
is ≥ 30 mmHg).  
Immunogenicity 
As this is a therapeutic protein, there is a potential for immunogenicity with aflibercept (see 
section 5.1). Patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of intraocular 
inflammation, e.g. pain, photophobia, or redness, which may be a clinical sign attributable to 
hypersensitivity. 
Systemic effects 
Systemic adverse events including non-ocular haemorrhages and arterial thromboembolic events have 
been reported following intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors and there is a theoretical risk that 
these may relate to VEGF inhibition (see section 4.8). 
There are limited data on safety in the treatment of patients with nAMD and DME with a history of 
stroke, transient ischaemic attacks or myocardial infarction within the last 6 months. Caution should 
be exercised when treating such patients. 
Bilateral treatment 
The safety and efficacy of bilateral treatment with Eylea 114.3 mg/ml per eye have not been studied 
(see section 5.1). If bilateral treatment is performed at the same time this could lead to an increased 
systemic exposure, which could increase the risk of systemic adverse events. 
Concomitant use of other anti-VEGF 
There are limited data available on the concomitant use of Eylea with other anti-VEGF medicinal 
products (systemic or ocular). 
Withholding treatment 
Treatment should be withheld in the event of: 
- 
a decrease in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of ≥ 30 letters compared with the last 
assessment of visual acuity 
a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or stage 3 or 4 macular holes 
a retinal break 
a subretinal haemorrhage involving the centre of the fovea, or, if the size of the haemorrhage is 
≥ 50 % of the total lesion area 
performed or planned intraocular surgery within the previous or next 28 days.

Retinal pigment epithelial tear 
Risk factors associated with the development of a retinal pigment epithelial tear after anti-VEGF 
therapy for nAMD include a large and/or high pigment epithelial retinal detachment. When initiating 
aflibercept therapy, caution should be used in patients with these risk factors for retinal pigment 
epithelial tears. 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 
4 months after the last intravitreal injection with Eylea 114.3 mg/ml (see section 4.6). 
Populations with limited data 
There is only limited experience with Eylea treatment in diabetic patients with an HbA1c over 12 % or 
with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. 
Eylea has not been studied in patients with active systemic infections or in patients with concurrent 
eye conditions such as retinal detachment or macular hole. There is also no experience of treatment 
with Eylea in diabetic patients with uncontrolled hypertension. This lack of information should be 
considered by the physician when treating such patients.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 
4 months after the last intravitreal injection with Eylea 114.3 mg/ml. 
Pregnancy 
There are limited data on the use of aflibercept in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Eylea 114.3 mg/ml should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the 
potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
Based on very limited human data, aflibercept may be excreted in human milk at low levels. 
Aflibercept is a large protein molecule and the amount of medication absorbed by the infant is 
expected to be minimal. The effect of aflibercept on a breast-fed newborn/infant is unknown. 
As a precautionary measure breast-feeding is not recommended during the use of Eylea 114.3 mg/ml. 
Fertility 
There are no fertility data in humans. Results from animal studies with high systemic exposure 
indicate that aflibercept can impair male and female fertility (see section 5.3).  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Injection with Eylea has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to possible 
temporary visual disturbance associated either with the injection or eye examination. Patients should 
not drive or use machines until their visual function has recovered sufficiently.

Serious adverse reactions were cataract (4.0%), retinal haemorrhage (2.6%), intraocular pressure 
increased (2.4%), vitreous haemorrhage (1.0%), cataract subcapsular (0.5%), retinal detachment 
(0.4%), and retinal tear (0.3%). 
The most frequently observed adverse reactions in patients treated with Eylea 114.3 mg/ml were 
cataract (4.0%), vitreous floaters (3.5%), visual acuity reduced (3.2%), conjunctival haemorrhage 
(3.1%), vitreous detachment (2.9%), retinal haemorrhage (2.6%), and intraocular pressure increased 
(2.4%). 
The safety profile observed in the 3 clinical studies was similar in patients treated with 
Eylea 114.3 mg/ml (N=1 217) and Eylea 40 mg/ml (N=556), and in patients with nAMD and DME. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
A total of 1 217 patients treated with Eylea 114.3 mg/ml constituted the safety population in 3 clinical 
phase II/III studies (CANDELA, PULSAR, PHOTON). 
The safety data described below include all adverse reactions with a reasonable possibility of causality 
to the injection procedure or medicinal product reported.

The following adverse reactions of Eylea 40 mg/ml are also considered expected with 
Eylea 114.3 mg/ml but have not been reported in the clinical studies with Eylea 114.3 mg/ml: ocular 
hyperaemia, retinal degeneration, abnormal sensation in eye, lenticular opacities, corneal epithelium 
defect, anterior chamber flare, eyelid irritation, endophthalmitis, traumatic cataract, hypopyon, severe 
anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Product-class-related adverse reactions 
Arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) are adverse reactions potentially related to systemic VEGF 
inhibition. There is a theoretical risk of ATEs, including stroke and myocardial infarction, following 
intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. A low incidence rate of ATEs was observed in the aflibercept 
clinical studies in patients with nAMD and DME. Across indications, no notable difference between 
the groups treated with Eylea 114.3 mg/ml and the comparator groups treated with Eylea 40 mg/ml 
were observed. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdosing with increased injection volume may increase intraocular pressure. Therefore, in case of 
overdose, intraocular pressure should be monitored and, if deemed necessary by the treating physician, 
adequate treatment should be initiated (see sections 4.4 and 6.6).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals / Antineovascularisation agents, ATC code: S01LA05 
Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF receptor 1 and 2 
extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1. 
Aflibercept is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells by recombinant DNA technology. 
Mechanism of action 
Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are members of 
the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as potent mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular 
permeability factors for endothelial cells. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1 and 
VEGFR-2, present on the surface of endothelial cells. PlGF binds only to VEGFR-1, which is also 
present on the surface of leucocytes. Excessive activation of these receptors by VEGF-A can result in 
pathological neovascularisation and excessive vascular permeability. PlGF can act independently to 
activate the VEGFR-1 to promote an inflammatory response within the retina, and is known to 
increase in pathological states such as nAMD, diabetic retinopathy (DR), DME, and retinal vein 
occlusion (RVO). 
69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Aflibercept acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF-A and PlGF with higher affinity than 
their natural receptors, and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF 
receptors.  
In animal studies, aflibercept can prevent pathological neovascularization and vascular leakage in a 
number of different models of ocular disease.  
nAMD 
nAMD is characterised by pathological choroidal neovascularisation (CNV). Leakage of blood and 
fluid from CNV may cause retinal oedema and/or sub-/intra-retinal haemorrhage, resulting in loss of 
visual acuity. 
The pharmacodynamic effects of aflibercept 114.3 mg/ml administered every 12 (8Q12) and every 16 
(8Q16) weeks are described in comparison with aflibercept 40 mg/ml administered every 8 weeks 
(2Q8) for the nAMD indication. These effects are shown as the change in CNV size from baseline to 
week 12; change in total lesion area from baseline to weeks 48 and 60; and change from baseline in 
central retinal thickness (CRT). 
In the pooled group of patients treated with 8Q12 or 8Q16, reductions in CNV size (LS mean, based 
on a mixed model for repeated measurements [MMRM]) at week 12 were -1.63 mm2 compared 
to -1.17 mm2 for patients treated with 2Q8.

Diabetic macular oedema is characterised by increased vasopermeability and damage to the retinal 
capillaries which may result in loss of visual acuity. 
The pharmacodynamic effects of aflibercept 114.3 mg/ml administered every 12 (8Q12) and every 16 
(8Q16) weeks are described in comparison with aflibercept 40 mg/ml administered every 8 weeks

Immunogenicity 
After dosing with Eylea 114.3 mg/ml for up to 48 weeks treatment-emergent antibodies to 
Eylea 114.3 mg/ml were detected in 1.2% to 3.8% of patients treated for DME and nAMD. No 
evidence of anti-drug antibodies impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety was observed. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
nAMD 
Study objectives 
The safety and efficacy of Eylea 114.3 mg/ml were assessed in a randomised, multi-centre, 
double-masked, active-controlled study (PULSAR) in patients with treatment naïve nAMD.  
The primary objective was to determine if treatment with Eylea 114.3 mg/ml at intervals of 12 (8Q12) 
or 16 weeks (8Q16) provides non-inferior best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) change compared to 
Eylea 40 mg/ml every 8 weeks in patients with nAMD. 
The secondary objectives were to determine the effect of Eylea 114.3 mg/ml versus Eylea 40 mg/ml 
on anatomic and other visual measures of response, and to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and 
pharmacokinetics of aflibercept. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in BCVA measured by the early 
treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) letter score at week 48. 
The key secondary endpoints were the change in BCVA from baseline at week 60 and the proportion 
of patients with no intraretinal fluid (IRF) and no subretinal fluid (SRF) in central subfield at week 16. 
Further secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients gaining at least 15 letters in BCVA from 
baseline at week 48, the proportion of patients achieving an ETDRS letter score of at least 69 
(approximate 20/40 Snellen equivalent) at week 48, and the change from baseline in National Eye 
Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25) total score at week 48, among others.  
In the PULSAR study a total of 1 009 patients were treated. The patients were assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio 
to 1 of 3 parallel treatment groups: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
Eylea 114.3 mg/ml administered every 12 weeks (8Q12) 
Eylea 114.3 mg/ml administered every 16 weeks (8Q16) 
Eylea 40 mg/ml administered every 8 weeks (2Q8) 
All patients received 3 initial injections of the assigned dose at 4-week intervals. 
Per study protocol the interval of the 8Q12- and 8Q16-groups was to be shortened if both of the 
following criteria were met: 
1. 
2. 
>5 letters loss in BCVA from week 12, and 
>25 microns increase in CRT from week 12 or new foveal haemorrhage or new foveal 
neovascularisation. 
Regardless of whether patient intervals were maintained or shortened in year 1, per study protocol all 
patients in the 8Q12- and 8Q16-groups were eligible for interval extension (by 4 weeks increments), 
beginning at week 52, if the following criteria were met: 
1. 
<5 letters loss in BCVA from week 12, and 
2. 
no fluid in the central subfield on optical coherence tomography (OCT), and 
3. 
no new onset of foveal haemorrhage or foveal neovascularisation. 
For patients who did not meet the criteria for shortening or extension of the interval, the dosing 
interval was maintained. The minimum interval between injections was 8 weeks in all groups. 
Patients with bilateral disease were eligible to receive Eylea 40 mg/ml treatment or another anti-VEGF 
medicinal product in their fellow eye. 
72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patient characteristics at baseline 
Patient ages ranged from 50 to 96 years with a mean of 74.5 years. 
Approximately 92% (309/335) and 87% (295/338) of the patients randomised to the 8Q12- and 
8Q16-groups, respectively, were 65 years of age or older and approximately 51% (172/335) and 51% 
(171/338) were 75 years of age or older. 
Results 
Patients in the 8Q12-, 8Q16- and 2Q8-groups who completed week 48 received a median (mean) of 
6.0 (6.1), 5.0 (5.2) and 7.0 (6.9) injections, respectively. 
At week 48, in the 8Q12-group, 79.4% of patients maintained Q12 intervals while in the 8Q16-group 
76.6% of patients maintained Q16 intervals.  
Patients in the 8Q12-, 8Q16- and 2Q8-groups who completed week 60 received a median (mean) of 
7.0 (7.1), 6.0 (6.2) and 9.0 (8.8) injections, respectively. 
At week 60, 43.1% of patients in the 8Q12-group were extended to a dosing interval of 16 weeks, and 
38.5% of patients in the 8Q16-group were extended to a dosing interval of 20 weeks. 
Treatment with 8Q12 and 8Q16 was shown to be non-inferior and clinically equivalent to treatment 
with 2Q8 in terms of the primary efficacy endpoint ‘mean change in BCVA at week 48’ and the key 
secondary efficacy endpoint ‘mean change in BCVA at week 60’. 
Furthermore, treatment with Eylea (pooled 8Q12- and 8Q16-groups) was shown to be superior to 
treatment with 2Q8 in terms of the key secondary efficacy endpoint ‘proportion of patients with no 
intraretinal fluid (IRF) and no subretinal fluid (SRF) in the central subfield at week 16’ (see table 4).

Aflibercept at all doses (8Q12, 8Q16, 2Q8) demonstrated meaningful increase from baseline in the 
pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoint national eye institute visual function questionnaire (NEI 
VFQ-25).  
No clinically meaningful differences were found between the 8Q12-, 8Q16- and 2Q8-groups in 
changes of NEI VFQ-25 total score at week 48 from baseline. 
Efficacy results in evaluable subgroups for age, gender, geographic region, ethnicity, race, baseline 
BCVA, and lesion type were consistent with the results in the overall population. 
Efficacy was generally maintained through week 60. 
DME 
Study objectives 
The safety and efficacy of Eylea 114.3 mg/ml were assessed in a randomised, multi-centre, 
double-masked, active-controlled study (PHOTON) in patients with DME.  
The primary objective was to determine if treatment with Eylea 114.3 mg/ml at intervals of 12 (8Q12) 
or 16 weeks (8Q16) provides non-inferior BCVA change compared to Eylea 40 mg/ml every 8 weeks. 
The secondary objectives were to determine the effect of Eylea 114.3 mg/ml versus Eylea 40 mg/ml 
on anatomic and other visual measures of response, and to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and 
pharmacokinetics of aflibercept. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in BCVA measured by the early 
treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) letter score at week 48. 
One key secondary endpoint was the change in BCVA from baseline at week 60. 
Further secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients gaining at least 15 letters in BCVA from 
baseline at week 48, the proportion of patients achieving an ETDRS letter score of at least 69 
(approximate 20/40 Snellen equivalent) at week 48, and the change from baseline in National Eye 
Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25) total score at week 48, among others. 
In the PHOTON study a total of 658 patients were treated. The patients were assigned in a 2:1:1 ratio 
to 1 of 3 parallel treatment groups: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
Eylea 114.3 mg/ml administered every 12 weeks (8Q12) 
Eylea 114.3 mg/ml administered every 16 weeks (8Q16) 
Eylea 40 mg/ml administered every 8 weeks (2Q8) 
All patients in the 8Q12- and 8Q16-groups received 3 initial injections and all patients in the 
2Q8-group received 5 initial injections at 4-week intervals. 
75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Per study protocol the interval of the 8Q12- and 8Q16-groups was to be shortened if both of the 
following criteria were met: 
1. 
2. 
>10 letter loss in BCVA from week 12 in association with persistent or worsening DME, and 
>50 microns increase in CRT from week 12. 
Regardless of whether patient intervals were maintained or shortened in year 1, per study protocol all 
patients in the 8Q12- and 8Q16-groups were eligible for interval extension (by 4 weeks increments), 
beginning at week 52, if the following criteria were met: 
1. 
<5 letter loss in BCVA from week 12, and 
2. 
CRT <300 microns on SD-OCT (or <320 microns if measured including RPE). 
For patients who did not meet the criteria for shortening or extension of the interval, the dosing 
interval was maintained. The minimum interval between injections was 8 weeks in all groups. 
Patients with bilateral disease were eligible to receive Eylea 40 mg/ml treatment in their fellow eye. 
Patient characteristics at baseline 
Patient ages ranged from 24 to 90 years with a mean of 62.3 years. 
Approximately 44% (143/328) and 44% (71/163) of the patients randomised to the 8Q12- and 
8Q16-groups, respectively, were 65 years of age or older and approximately 11% (36/328) and 14% 
(14/163) were 75 years of age or older. 
The proportion of patients who were treated previously for DME was balanced between the treatment 
groups (43.6% in 8Q12-, 43.6% in 8Q16-, 44.3% in 2Q8-group). 
Results 
Patients in the 8Q12-, 8Q16- and 2Q8-groups who completed week 48 received a median (mean) of 
6.0 (6.0), 5.0 (5.0) and 8.0 (7.9) injections, respectively. 
At week 48, in the 8Q12-group, 91.0% of patients maintained Q12 intervals while in the 8Q16-group 
89.1% of patients maintained Q16 intervals.  
Patients in the 8Q12-, 8Q16- and 2Q8-groups who completed week 60 received a median (mean) of 
7.0 (7.0), 6.0 (6.0) and 10.0 (9.8) injections, respectively. At week 60, 42.6% of patients in the 
8Q12-group were extended to a dosing interval of 16 weeks, and 34.2% of patients in the 8Q16-group 
were extended to a dosing interval of 20 weeks. 
Treatment with Eylea (both 8Q12- and 8Q16-groups) was shown to be non-inferior and clinically 
equivalent to treatment with 2Q8 in terms of the primary efficacy endpoint ‘mean change in BCVA at 
week 48’ and the key secondary efficacy endpoint ‘mean change in BCVA at week 60’.

weeks 
Eylea at all doses (8Q12, 8Q16, 2Q8) demonstrated meaningful increase from baseline in the 
pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoint national eye institute visual function questionnaire (NEI 
VFQ-25).  
No clinically meaningful differences were found between the 8Q12-, 8Q16- and 2Q8-groups in 
changes of NEI VFQ-25 total score at week 48 from baseline. 
Efficacy results in evaluable subgroups for age, gender, geographic region, ethnicity, race, baseline 
BCVA and baseline CRT and prior DME treatment were consistent with the results in the overall 
population. 
Efficacy was generally maintained through week 60. 
Treatment effects in the sub-group of previously treated patients were similar to those seen in patients 
who were treatment naïve. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
aflibercept in all subsets of the paediatric population in nAMD and DME (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption / Distribution 
Aflibercept is slowly absorbed from the eye into the systemic circulation after intravitreal 
administration and is predominately observed in the systemic circulation as an inactive, stable 
complex with VEGF; however only “free aflibercept” is able to bind endogenous VEGF. 
Following unilateral intravitreal administration of 8 mg aflibercept, the mean (SD) Cmax of free 
aflibercept in plasma was 0.25 (0.21) mg/l, and the median time to maximal concentration in plasma 
was 1 day, in the nAMD and DME population combined. The accumulation of free aflibercept in 
plasma following 3 initial monthly doses was minimal. Subsequently, no further accumulation was 
observed. These data are also supported by population pharmacokinetic analyses. 
78 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Aflibercept is a protein-based therapeutic and no metabolism studies have been conducted. 
Aflibercept is expected to undergo elimination through both target-mediated disposition via binding to 
free endogenous VEGF and metabolism via proteolysis. The median time to reach the last quantifiable 
concentration of free aflibercept in plasma for 8 mg administered intravitreally was 3 weeks. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
No special studies in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have been conducted with 
Eylea 114.3 mg/ml. 
The systemic exposures to aflibercept in patients with mild to severe renal impairment were similar to 
those with normal renal function. Limited available data in patients with mild hepatic impairment do 
not indicate an influence on systemic exposures to aflibercept compared to patients with normal 
hepatic function. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Erosions and ulcerations of the respiratory epithelium in nasal turbinates in monkeys treated with 
aflibercept intravitreally were observed at systemic exposures in excess of the maximum human 
exposure. The systemic exposure for free aflibercept was approximately 26- and 33-fold higher based 
on Cmax and AUC when compared to corresponding values in adult patients after an intravitreal dose of 
8 mg. At the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 0.5 mg/eye in monkeys the systemic 
exposure was 3.2- and 3.8-fold higher based on Cmax and AUC when compared to corresponding 
values in adult patients. 
No studies have been conducted on the mutagenic or carcinogenic potential of aflibercept. 
An effect of aflibercept on intrauterine development was shown in embryo-foetal development studies 
in pregnant rabbits with intravenous (3 to 60 mg/kg) as well as subcutaneous (0.1 to 1 mg/kg) 
administration. The maternal NOAEL was at the dose of 3 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg, respectively. A 
developmental NOAEL was not identified. At the 0.1 mg/kg dose, the systemic exposure for free 
aflibercept was approximately 1.0- and 1.0-fold based on Cmax and cumulative AUC when compared 
to corresponding values in adult patients after an intravitreal dose of 8 mg. 
Effects on male and female fertility were assessed as part of a 6-month study in monkeys with 
intravenous administration of aflibercept at doses ranging from 3 to 30 mg/kg. Absent or irregular 
menses associated with alterations in female reproductive hormone levels and changes in sperm 
morphology and motility were observed at all dose levels. Based on Cmax and AUC for free aflibercept 
observed at the 3 mg/kg intravenous dose, the systemic exposures were approximately 377-fold and 
104-fold higher, respectively, than the exposure in humans after an intravitreal dose of 8 mg. All 
changes were reversible.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Eylea is and what it is used for 
Eylea is a solution which is injected into the eye to treat eye conditions in adults called  
- 
- 
neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD),  
impaired vision due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO 
(BRVO) or central RVO (CRVO)), 
impaired vision due to diabetic macular oedema (DME), 
impaired vision due to myopic choroidal neovascularisation (myopic CNV). 
- 
- 
Aflibercept, the active substance in Eylea, blocks the activity of a group of factors, known as Vascular 
Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGF-A) and Placental Growth Factor (PlGF). 
In patients with wet AMD and myopic CNV, these factors, in excess are involved in the abnormal 
formation of new blood vessels in the eye. These new blood vessels can cause the leak of blood 
components into the eye and eventual damage to tissues in the eye responsible for vision.  
In patients with CRVO, a blockage occurs in the main blood vessel that transports blood away from 
the retina. VEGF levels are elevated in response causing the leakage of fluid into the retina and 
thereby causing a swelling of the macula, (the portion of the retina responsible for fine vision), which 
is called macular oedema. When the macula swells with fluid, central vision becomes blurry. 
In patients with BRVO, one or more branches of the main blood vessel that transports blood away 
from the retina is blocked. VEGF levels are elevated in response causing the leakage of fluid into the 
retina and thereby causing macular oedema. 
101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Diabetic macular oedema is a swelling of the retina occurring in patients with diabetes due to leaking 
of fluid from blood vessels within the macula. The macula is the portion of retina responsible for fine 
vision. When the macula swells with fluid, central vision becomes blurry. 
Eylea has been shown to stop the growth of new abnormal blood vessels in the eye which often leak 
fluid or bleed. Eylea can help to stabilise, and in many cases, improve the vision loss related to wet 
AMD, CRVO, BRVO, DME and myopic CNV. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Eylea 
You will not be given Eylea 
- 
if you are allergic to aflibercept or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have an active or suspected infection in or around the eye (ocular or periocular infection). 
if you have severe inflammation of the eye (indicated by pain or redness).  
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Eylea 
- 
- 
if you have glaucoma. 
if you have a history of seeing flashes of light or floaters and if you have a sudden increase of 
size and number of floaters. 
if surgery was performed or is planned on your eye within the previous or next four weeks. 
if you have a severe form of CRVO or BRVO (ischaemic CRVO or BRVO), treatment with 
Eylea is not recommended. 
Furthermore, it is important for you to know that 
- 
the safety and efficacy of Eylea when administered to both eyes at the same time has not been 
studied and if used in this way may lead to an increased risk of experiencing side effects. 
injections with Eylea may cause an increase in eye pressure (intraocular pressure) in some 
patients within 60 minutes of the injection. Your doctor will monitor this after each injection. 
if you develop an infection or inflammation inside the eye (endophthalmitis) or other 
complications, you may have eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye redness, blurred 
or decreased vision, and increased sensitivity to light. It is important to have any symptoms 
diagnosed and treated as soon as possible.  
your doctor will check whether you have other risk factors that may increase the chance of a 
tear or detachment of one of the layers at the back of the eye (retinal detachment or tear, and 
retinal pigment epithelial detachment or tear), in which case Eylea must be given with caution. 
Eylea should not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk 
to the unborn child.  
women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at 
least three further months after the last injection of Eylea. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
The systemic use of VEGF inhibitors, substances similar to those contained in Eylea, is potentially 
related to the risk of blood clots blocking blood vessels (arterial thromboembolic events) which may 
lead to heart attack or stroke. There is a theoretical risk of such events following injection of Eylea 
into the eye. There are limited data on safety in treating patients with CRVO, BRVO, DME and 
myopic CNV who have had a stroke or a mini-stroke (transient ischaemic attack) or a heart attack 
within the last 6 months. If any of these apply to you, Eylea will be given with caution.  
There is only limited experience in the treatment of  
- 
- 
- 
patients with DME due to type I diabetes. 
diabetics with very high average blood sugar values (HbA1c over 12%). 
diabetics with an eye disease caused by diabetes called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. 
102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is no experience in the treatment of  
- 
patients with acute infections. 
- 
patients with other eye conditions such as a detachment of the retina or a hole in the macula. 
- 
diabetics with uncontrolled high blood pressure.  
- 
non-Asian patients with myopic CNV. 
- 
patients previously treated for myopic CNV. 
- 
patients with damage outside the central part of the macula (extrafoveal lesions) for myopic 
CNV. 
If any of the above applies to you, your doctor will consider this lack of information when treating you 
with Eylea. 
Children and adolescents 
The use of Eylea in children and adolescents under 18 years of age for indications other than 
retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) has not been studied.  
. 
Other medicines and Eylea 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
- 
- 
- 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at 
least three further months after the last injection of Eylea. 
There is no experience of using Eylea in pregnant women. Eylea should not be used during 
pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the unborn child. If you 
are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before treatment 
with Eylea. 
Small amounts of Eylea may pass into human milk. The effects on breast-fed newborns/infants 
are unknown. Eylea is not recommended during breast-feeding. If you are a breastfeeding 
woman, discuss this with your doctor before treatment with Eylea.  
Driving and using machines 
After your injection with Eylea, you may experience some temporary visual disturbances. Do not drive 
or use machines as long as these last. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Eylea 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say essentially 
'sodium-free’. 
3. 
How you will be given Eylea 
A doctor experienced in giving eye injections will inject Eylea into your eye under aseptic (clean and 
sterile) conditions.  
The recommended dose is 2 mg aflibercept (0.05 mL). 
Eylea is given as an injection into your eye (intravitreal injection). 
Before the injection your doctor will use a disinfectant eyewash to clean your eye carefully to prevent 
infection. Your doctor will also give you a local anaesthetic to reduce or prevent any pain you might 
have with the injection.  
wet AMD 
Patients with wet AMD will be treated with one injection per month for three consecutive doses, 
followed by another injection after a further two months. 
Your doctor will then decide whether the treatment interval between injections may be kept at every 
two months or be gradually extended in 2- or 4-weekly intervals if your condition has been stable. 
103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If your condition worsens, the interval between injections can be shortened. 
Unless you experience any problems or are advised differently by your doctor, there is no need for you 
to see your doctor between the injections. 
Macular oedema secondary to RVO (branch RVO or central RVO) 
Your doctor will determine the most appropriate treatment schedule for you. You will start your 
treatment with a series of monthly Eylea injections. 
The interval between two injections should not be shorter than one month. 
Your doctor may decide to stop treatment with Eylea, if you are not benefiting from continued 
treatment. 
Your treatment will continue with monthly injections until your condition is stable. Three or more 
monthly injections may be needed. 
Your doctor will monitor your response to treatment and may continue your treatment by gradually 
increasing the interval between your injections to maintain a stable condition. If your condition starts 
to worsen with a longer treatment interval, your doctor will shorten the interval accordingly. 
Based on your response to treatment your doctor will decide on the schedule for follow up 
examinations and treatments. 
Diabetic macular oedema (DME) 
Patients with DME will be treated with one injection per month for the first five consecutive doses 
followed by one injection every two months thereafter. 
Treatment interval may be kept at every two months or adjusted to your condition, based on your 
doctor’s examination. Your doctor will decide on the schedule for follow up examinations. 
Your doctor may decide to stop treatment with Eylea if it is determined that you are not benefiting 
from continued treatment. 
Myopic CNV 
Patients with myopic CNV will be treated with one single injection. You will receive further injections 
only if your doctor’s examinations reveal that your condition has not improved. 
The interval between two injections should not be shorter than one month. 
If your condition goes away and then comes back, your doctor may re-start the treatment. 
Your doctor will decide on the schedule for follow up examinations. 
Detailed instructions for use are given at the end of the leaflet under “How to prepare and administer 
Eylea to adults”. 
If a dose of Eylea is missed 
Make a new appointment for an examination and injection. 
Stopping treatment with Eylea 
Consult your doctor before stopping the treatment. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) could potentially occur. These may be serious and require that 
you contact your doctor immediately. 
With administration of Eylea, there may be some side effects affecting the eyes which are due to the 
injection procedure. Some of these may be serious and include blindness, a serious infection or 
inflammation inside the eye (endophthalmitis), detachment, tear or bleeding of the light-sensitive 
layer at the back of the eye (retinal detachment or tear), clouding of the lens (cataract), bleeding in 
the eye (vitreous haemorrhage), detachment of the gel-like substance inside the eye from the retina 
(vitreous detachment) and increase of pressure inside the eye, see section 2. These serious side 
effects affecting the eyes occurred in less than 1 in 1,900 injections in clinical studies. 
If you experience a sudden decrease in vision, or an increase in pain and redness in your eye after your 
injection, contact your doctor immediately.  
List of side effects reported 
The following is a list of the side effects reported to be possibly related to the injection procedure or to

- 
- 
- 
- 
deterioration of eyesight  
bleeding in the back of the eye (retinal haemorrhage) 
bloodshot eye caused by bleeding from small blood vessels in the outer layers of the eye  
eye pain 
Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
- 
detachment or tear of one of the layers in the back of the eye, resulting in flashes of light with 
floaters sometimes progressing to a loss of vision (retinal pigment epithelial tear*/detachment, 
retinal detachment/tear)

105 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): 
- 
allergic reactions (hypersensitivity)** 
o  ** Allergic reactions like rash, itching (pruritus), hives (urticaria), and a few cases of severe 
allergy (anaphylactic/anaphylactoid) reactions were reported. 
serious inflammation or infection inside the eye (endophthalmitis) 
inflammation in the iris or other parts of the eye (iritis, uveitis, iridocyclitis, anterior chamber 
flare) 
abnormal sensation in the eye 
eyelid irritation 
swelling of the front layer of the eyeball (cornea) 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): 
- 
- 
- 
- 
blindness 
clouding of the lens due to injury (traumatic cataract) 
inflammation of the gel-like substance inside the eye 
pus in the eye  
In the clinical trials, there was an increased incidence of bleeding from small blood vessels in the outer 
layers of the eye (conjunctival haemorrhage) in patients with wet AMD receiving blood thinners. This 
increased incidence was comparable between patients treated with ranibizumab and Eylea. 
The systemic use of VEGF inhibitors, substances similar to those contained in Eylea, is potentially 
related to the risk of blood clots blocking blood vessels (arterial thromboembolic events) which may 
lead to heart attack or stroke. There is a theoretical risk of such events following injection of Eylea 
into the eye.  
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a possibility for an immune reaction (formation of antibodies) 
with Eylea.  
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this 
leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
How to prepare and administer Eylea to adults  
The pre-filled syringe should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. 
Do not open the sterile pre-filled syringe blister outside the clean administration room. 
The pre-filled syringe contains more than the recommended dose of 2 mg aflibercept (equivalent to 
0.05 mL). The excess volume must be discarded prior to administration.  
The solution should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or discolouration or 
any variation in physical appearance prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, 
discard the medicinal product.  
The unopened blister may be stored outside the refrigerator below 25 °C for up to 24 hours. After 
opening the blister, proceed under aseptic conditions. For the intravitreal injection, a 30 G x ½ inch 
injection needle should be used. 
Instructions for use of pre-filled syringe: 
1.  When ready to administer Eylea, open the carton and remove the sterilised blister. Carefully peel open 
the blister ensuring the sterility of its contents. Keep the syringe in the sterile tray until you are ready 
for assembly. 
2.  Using aseptic technique, remove the syringe from the sterilised blister. 
108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
To remove the syringe cap, hold the syringe in one 
hand while using the other hand to grasp the syringe 
cap with the thumb and fore finger. Please note: 
You should twist off (do not snap off) the syringe 
cap.  
To avoid compromising the sterility of the product, do not pull back on the plunger. 
4. 
5.  Using aseptic technique, firmly twist the injection 
needle onto the Luer-lock syringe tip. 
6.  Holding the syringe with the needle pointing up, 
check the syringe for bubbles. If there are bubbles, 
gently tap the syringe with your finger until the 
bubbles rise to the top. 
109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7. 
Eliminate all bubbles and expel excess medicinal product by slowly depressing the plunger to 
align the base of the plunger dome (not the tip of the dome) with the dosing line on the syringe 
(equivalent to 0.05 mL i.e. 2 mg aflibercept). 
Note: This accurate positioning of the plunger is very important, because incorrect plunger 
positioning can lead to delivering more or less than the labelled dose 
8.       Inject while pressing the plunger carefully and with constant pressure. Do not apply additional 
pressure once the plunger has reached the bottom of the syringe. Do not administer any residual 
solution observed in the syringe. 
9.   The pre-filled syringe is for single use only. Extraction of multiple doses from a pre-filled syringe 
may increase the risk of contamination and subsequent infection.

How to store Eylea  
1.  What Eylea is and what it is used for 
Eylea is a solution which is injected into the eye. Eylea belongs to a group of medicines called 
antineovascularisation agents. It contains the active substance called aflibercept. 
Eylea is used in babies born prematurely to treat an eye condition called retinopathy of prematurity 
(ROP). Babies with ROP have abnormal growth of new blood vessels in the back of the eye (retina) 
induced by Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). This may cause vision impairment and in 
severe cases permanent blindness. 
Aflibercept, the active substance in Eylea, blocks the activity of a group of factors, known as Vascular 
Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGF-A) and Placental Growth Factor (PlGF). 
Eylea has been shown to stop the growth of new abnormal blood vessels in the eye which often leak 
fluid or bleed. Eylea can help to stabilise, and in many cases, improve the vision loss related to ROP. 
2.  What you need to know before the baby is given Eylea 
The baby will not be given Eylea if he or she 
- 
- 
- 
is allergic to aflibercept or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
has an active or suspected infection in or around the eye (ocular or periocular infection). 
has severe inflammation of the eye (indicated by pain or redness). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to the baby’s doctor before the baby is given Eylea 
- 
if surgery was performed or is planned on the baby’s eye within the previous or next four 
weeks. 
111 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, it is important for you to know that 
- 
- 
- 
injections with Eylea may cause an increase in eye pressure (intraocular pressure) in some 
patients within 60 minutes of the injection. The baby’s doctor will monitor this after each 
injection. 
if the baby develops an infection or inflammation inside the eye (endophthalmitis) or other 
complications, the baby may have redness/irritation of the eye, ocular discharge, lid swelling 
and increased sensitivity to light. It is important to have any symptoms diagnosed and treated 
as soon as possible. 
Please tell the baby’s doctor immediately if the baby develops any signs or symptoms 
outlined.  
the baby’s doctor will check whether the baby has other risk factors that may increase the 
chance of a tear or detachment of one of the layers at the back of the eye (retinal detachment or 
tear), in which case Eylea must be given with caution. 
The systemic use of VEGF inhibitors, substances similar to those contained in Eylea, is potentially 
related to the risk of blood clots blocking blood vessels (arterial thromboembolic events) which may 
lead to heart attack or stroke. There is a theoretical risk of such events following injection of Eylea 
into the eye. 
There is no experience in the treatment of  
- 
patients with acute infections 
- 
patients with other eye conditions such as a detachment of the retina or a hole in the macula 
If any of the above applies to the baby, the baby’s doctor will consider this lack of information when 
treating the baby with Eylea. 
Other medicines and Eylea 
Tell the baby’s doctor if the baby is receiving, has recently received or might receive any other 
medicines. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Eylea 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say essentially 
'sodium-free’. 
3. 
How the baby will be given Eylea 
A doctor experienced in giving eye injections will inject Eylea into the baby’s eyes under aseptic 
(clean and sterile) conditions. 
The recommended dose is 0.4 mg aflibercept (0.01 mL). 
Eylea is given as an injection into the baby’s eye (intravitreal injection).  
Before the injection the baby’s doctor will use a disinfectant eyewash to clean the baby’s eye carefully 
to prevent infection. The baby’s doctor will also give the baby a local anaesthetic to reduce or prevent 
any pain the baby might have with the injection. 
The treatment is started with a single injection per eye and may be given into the second eye on the 
same day. The baby’s doctor will monitor the condition of the baby’s eye(s). Depending on how the 
baby responds to the treatment, the baby’s doctor will decide if and when further treatment is needed. 
The treatment interval between the 2 doses injected into the same eye should be at least 4 weeks. 
Detailed instructions for use are given at the end of the leaflet under “How to prepare and administer 
Eylea to preterm infants”. 
112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stopping treatment with Eylea 
If you are considering stopping Eylea treatment for the baby, please discuss this with the baby’s doctor 
at your next appointment. The baby’s doctor will advise you and decide how long the baby should be 
treated with Eylea. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask the baby’s doctor. 
4. 
Possible side effects

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
How to prepare and administer Eylea to preterm infants 
The pre-filled syringe should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. Extraction of multiple 
doses from a pre-filled syringe may increase the risk of contamination and subsequent infection. 
Do not open the sterile pre-filled blister outside the clean administration room. Any unused medicinal 
product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 
The pre-filled syringe contains more than the recommended dose of 0.4 mg aflibercept (equivalent to 
0.01 mL). For treatment of preterm infants, the PICLEO paediatric dosing device in combination with 
the pre-filled syringe must be used for administration of a single dose of 0.4 mg aflibercept (equivalent 
to 0.01 mL). See following section “Instructions for use of pre-filled syringe”. 
The solution should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or discolouration or 
any variation in physical appearance prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, 
discard the medicinal product. 
The unopened blister may be stored outside the refrigerator below 25 ºC for up to 24 hours. After 
opening the blister, proceed under aseptic conditions. 
For the intravitreal injection, a 30 G x ½ inch injection needle should be used. 
Instructions for use of pre-filled syringe: 
To prepare the pre-filled syringe for administration to preterm infants, follow the steps 1 and 2 below 
and then adhere to the instructions for use included in the package of the PICLEO paediatric dosing 
device. 
1.  When ready to administer Eylea, open the carton and remove the sterilised blister. Carefully peel open 
the blister ensuring the sterility of its contents. Keep the syringe in the sterile tray until you are ready 
for assembly. 
2.  Using aseptic technique, remove the syringe from the sterilised blister.

How to store Eylea  
1.  What Eylea is and what it is used for 
Eylea is a solution which is injected into the eye to treat eye conditions in adults called 
- 
- 
- 
- 
neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD),  
impaired vision due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO 
(BRVO) or central RVO (CRVO)), 
impaired vision due to diabetic macular oedema (DME), 
impaired vision due to myopic choroidal neovascularisation (myopic CNV). 
Aflibercept, the active substance in Eylea, blocks the activity of a group of factors, known as Vascular 
Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGF-A) and Placental Growth Factor (PlGF). 
In patients with wet AMD and myopic CNV, these factors, in excess are involved in the abnormal 
formation of new blood vessels in the eye. These new blood vessels can cause the leak of blood 
components into the eye and eventual damage to tissues in the eye responsible for vision. 
In patients with CRVO, a blockage occurs in the main blood vessel that transports blood away from 
the retina. VEGF levels are elevated in response causing the leakage of fluid into the retina and 
thereby causing a swelling of the macula, (the portion of the retina responsible for fine vision), which 
is called macular oedema. When the macula swells with fluid, central vision becomes blurry. 
In patients with BRVO, one or more branches of the main blood vessel that transports blood away 
from the retina is blocked. VEGF levels are elevated in response causing the leakage of fluid into the 
retina and thereby causing macular oedema. 
Diabetic macular oedema is a swelling of the retina occurring in patients with diabetes due to leaking 
of fluid from blood vessels within the macula. The macula is the portion of retina responsible for fine 
vision. When the macula swells with fluid, central vision becomes blurry. 
Eylea has been shown to stop the growth of new abnormal blood vessels in the eye which often leak 
fluid or bleed. Eylea can help to stabilise, and in many cases, improve the vision loss related to wet 
AMD, CRVO, BRVO, DME and myopic CNV. 
118 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Eylea 
You will not be given Eylea 
- 
if you are allergic to aflibercept or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have an active or suspected infection in or around the eye (ocular or periocular infection). 
if you have severe inflammation of the eye (indicated by pain or redness).  
- 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Eylea: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you have glaucoma. 
if you have a history of seeing flashes of light or floaters and if you have a sudden increase of 
size and number of floaters. 
if surgery was performed or is planned on your eye within the previous or next four weeks. 
if you have a severe form of CRVO or BRVO (ischaemic CRVO or BRVO), treatment with 
Eylea is not recommended. 
Furthermore, it is important for you to know that: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
the safety and efficacy of Eylea when administered to both eyes at the same time has not been 
studied and if used in this way may lead to an increased risk of experiencing side effects. 
injections with Eylea may cause an increase in eye pressure (intraocular pressure) in some 
patients within 60 minutes of the injection. Your doctor will monitor this after each injection. 
if you develop an infection or inflammation inside the eye (endophthalmitis) or other 
complications, you may have eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye redness, blurred 
or decreased vision, and increased sensitivity to light. It is important to have any symptoms 
diagnosed and treated as soon as possible.  
your doctor will check whether you have other risk factors that may increase the chance of a 
tear or detachment of one of the layers at the back of the eye (retinal detachment or tear, and 
retinal pigment epithelial detachment or tear), in which case Eylea must be given with caution. 
Eylea should not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk 
to the unborn child.  
women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at 
least three further months after the last injection of Eylea. 
The systemic use of VEGF inhibitors, substances similar to those contained in Eylea, is potentially 
related to the risk of blood clots blocking blood vessels (arterial thromboembolic events) which may 
lead to heart attack or stroke. There is a theoretical risk of such events following injection of Eylea 
into the eye. There are limited data on safety in treating patients with CRVO, BRVO, DME and 
myopic CNV who have had a stroke or a mini-stroke (transient ischaemic attack) or a heart attack 
within the last 6 months. If any of these apply to you, Eylea will be given with caution. 
There is only limited experience in the treatment of  
- 
- 
- 
patients with DME due to type I diabetes. 
diabetics with very high average blood sugar values (HbA1c over 12%). 
diabetics with an eye disease caused by diabetes called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. 
119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is no experience in the treatment of  
- 
patients with acute infections. 
- 
patients with other eye conditions such as a detachment of the retina or a hole in the macula. 
- 
diabetics with uncontrolled high blood pressure.  
- 
non-Asian patients with myopic CNV. 
- 
patients previously treated for myopic CNV. 
- 
patients with damage outside the central part of the macula (extrafoveal lesions) for myopic 
CNV. 
If any of the above applies to you, your doctor will consider this lack of information when treating you 
with Eylea. 
Children and adolescents 
The use of Eylea in children or adolescents under 18 has not been studied because wet AMD, CRVO, 
BRVO, DME and myopic CNV occur mainly in adults. Therefore, its use in this age group is not 
relevant. 
Other medicines and Eylea 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
- 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at 
least three further months after the last injection of Eylea. 
- 
- 
There is no experience of using Eylea in pregnant women. Eylea should not be used during 
pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the unborn child. If you 
are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before treatment 
with Eylea. 
Small amounts of Eylea may pass into human milk. The effects on breast-fed newborns/infants 
are unknown. Eylea is not recommended during breast-feeding. If you are a breastfeeding 
woman, discuss this with your doctor before treatment with Eylea.  
Driving and using machines 
After your injection with Eylea, you may experience some temporary visual disturbances. Do not drive 
or use machines as long as these last. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Eylea 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say essentially 
’sodium-free’. 
3. 
How you will be given Eylea 
A doctor experienced in giving eye injections will inject Eylea into your eye under aseptic (clean and 
sterile) conditions. 
The recommended dose is 2 mg aflibercept (0.05 mL).  
Eylea is given as an injection into your eye (intravitreal injection). 
Before the injection your doctor will use a disinfectant eyewash to clean your eye carefully to prevent 
infection. Your doctor will also give you a local anaesthetic to reduce or prevent any pain you might 
have with the injection. 
120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
wet AMD 
Patients with wet AMD will be treated with one injection per month for three consecutive doses, 
followed by another injection after a further two months. 
Your doctor will then decide whether the treatment interval between injections may be kept at every 
two months or be gradually extended in 2- or 4-weekly intervals if your condition has been stable. 
If your condition worsens, the interval between injections can be shortened. 
Unless you experience any problems or are advised differently by your doctor, there is no need for you 
to see your doctor between the injections. 
Macular oedema secondary to RVO (branch RVO or central RVO) 
Your doctor will determine the most appropriate treatment schedule for you. You will start your 
treatment with a series of monthly Eylea injections. 
The interval between two injections should not be shorter than one month. 
Your doctor may decide to stop treatment with Eylea, if you are not benefiting from continued 
treatment. 
Your treatment will continue with monthly injections until your condition is stable. Three or more 
monthly injections may be needed. 
Your doctor will monitor your response to treatment and may continue your treatment by gradually 
increasing the interval between your injections to maintain a stable condition. If your condition starts 
to worsen with a longer treatment interval, your doctor will shorten the interval accordingly. 
Based on your response to treatment your doctor will decide on the schedule for follow up 
examinations and treatments. 
Diabetic macular oedema (DME) 
Patients with DME will be treated with one injection per month for the first five consecutive doses 
followed by one injection every two months thereafter. 
Treatment interval may be kept at every two months or adjusted to your condition, based on your 
doctor’s examination. Your doctor will decide on the schedule for follow up examinations. 
Your doctor may decide to stop treatment with Eylea if it is determined that you are not benefiting 
from continued treatment. 
Myopic CNV 
Patients with myopic CNV will be treated with one single injection. You will receive further injections 
only if your doctor’s examinations reveal that your condition has not improved. 
The interval between two injections should not be shorter than one month. 
If your condition goes away and then comes back, your doctor may re-start the treatment. 
Your doctor will decide on the schedule for follow up examinations. 
If a dose of Eylea is missed 
Make a new appointment for an examination and injection.

4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) could potentially occur. These may be serious and require that 
you contact your doctor immediately. 
With administration of Eylea, there may be some side effects affecting the eyes which are due to the 
injection procedure. Some of these may be serious and include blindness, a serious infection or 
inflammation inside the eye (endophthalmitis), detachment, tear or bleeding of the light-sensitive 
layer at the back of the eye (retinal detachment or tear), clouding of the lens (cataract), bleeding in 
the eye (vitreous haemorrhage), detachment of the gel-like substance inside the eye from the retina 
(vitreous detachment) and increase of pressure inside the eye, see section 2. These serious side 
effects affecting the eyes occurred in less than 1 in 1,900 injections in clinical studies. 
If you experience a sudden decrease in vision, or an increase in pain and redness in your eye after your 
injection, contact your doctor immediately.  
List of side effects reported 
The following is a list of the side effects reported to be possibly related to the injection procedure or to 
the medicine. Please do not get alarmed, you might not experience any of these. Always discuss any 
suspected side effects with your doctor. 
Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
- 
- 
- 
- 
deterioration of eyesight  
bleeding in the back of the eye (retinal haemorrhage) 
bloodshot eye caused by bleeding from small blood vessels in the outer layers of the eye  
eye pain 
Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
- 
detachment or tear of one of the layers in the back of the eye, resulting in flashes of light with 
floaters sometimes progressing to a loss of vision (retinal pigment epithelial tear*/detachment, 
retinal detachment/tear) 
degeneration of the retina (causing disturbed vision) 
bleeding in the eye (vitreous haemorrhage) 
certain forms of clouding of the lens (cataract) 
damage to the front layer of the eyeball (the cornea) 
increase in eye pressure  
moving spots in vision (floaters) 
detachment of the gel-like substance inside the eye from the retina (vitreous detachment, 
resulting in flashes of light with floaters) 
a feeling of having something in the eye 
increased tear production 
swelling of the eyelid  
bleeding at the injection site 
redness of the eye  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
*  Conditions known to be associated with wet AMD; observed in wet AMD patients only. 
122 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): 
- 
- 
- 
allergic reactions (hypersensitivity)** 
serious inflammation or infection inside the eye (endophthalmitis) 
inflammation in the iris or other parts of the eye (iritis, uveitis, iridocyclitis, anterior chamber 
flare) 
abnormal sensation in the eye 
eyelid irritation 
swelling of the front layer of the eyeball (cornea) 
- 
- 
- 
** Allergic reactions like rash, itching (pruritus), hives (urticaria), and a few cases of severe allergy 
(anaphylactic/anaphylactoid) reactions were reported. 
Rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): 
- 
- 
- 
- 
blindness 
clouding of the lens due to injury (traumatic cataract) 
inflammation of the gel-like substance inside the eye 
pus in the eye  
In the clinical trials, there was an increased incidence of bleeding from small blood vessels in the outer 
layers of the eye (conjunctival haemorrhage) in patients with wet AMD receiving blood thinners. This 
increased incidence was comparable between patients treated with ranibizumab and Eylea. 
The systemic use of VEGF inhibitors, substances similar to those contained in Eylea, is potentially 
related to the risk of blood clots blocking blood vessels (arterial thromboembolic events) which may 
lead to heart attack or stroke. There is a theoretical risk of such events following injection of Eylea 
into the eye.  
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a possibility for an immune reaction (formation of antibodies) 
with Eylea.  
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this 
leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu.  
<-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
The vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. 
The vial contains more than the recommended dose of 2 mg aflibercept (equivalent to 0.05 mL). The 
excess volume must be discarded prior to administration.  
The solution should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or discolouration or 
any variation in physical appearance prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, 
discard the medicinal product. 
The unopened vial may be stored outside the refrigerator below 25° C for up to 24 hours. After 
opening the vial, proceed under aseptic conditions. 
For the intravitreal injection, a 30 G x ½ inch injection needle should be used. 
Instructions for use of vial: 
1. 
Remove the plastic cap and disinfect the outer part of 
the rubber stopper of the vial. 
125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  Attach the 18 G, 5-micron filter needle supplied in the 
carton to a 1 mL sterile Luer-lock syringe. 
3. 
Push the filter needle into the centre of the vial stopper until the needle is completely inserted into 
the vial and the tip touches the bottom or bottom edge of the vial. 
4.  Using aseptic technique withdraw all of the Eylea vial 
contents into the syringe, keeping the vial in an upright 
position, slightly inclined to ease complete withdrawal. 
To deter the introduction of air, ensure the bevel of the 
filter needle is submerged into the liquid. Continue to 
tilt the vial during withdrawal keeping the bevel of the 
filter needle submerged in the liquid. 
5. 
6. 
Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when emptying the vial in order to completely 
empty the filter needle. 
Remove the filter needle and properly dispose of it. 
Note: Filter needle is not to be used for intravitreal injection. 
7.  Using aseptic technique, firmly twist a 30 G x ½ inch 
injection needle onto the Luer-lock syringe tip. 
126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8.  Holding the syringe with the needle pointing up, check 
the syringe for bubbles. If there are bubbles, gently tap 
the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the 
top. 
9. 
Eliminate all bubbles and expel excess medicinal product by slowly depressing the plunger so that 
the flat plunger edge aligns with the line that marks 0.05 mL on the syringe. 
10.  The vial is for single use only. Extraction of multiple doses from a single vial may increase the risk 
of contamination and subsequesnt infection. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Eylea is and what it is used for 
What Eylea is 
Eylea contains the active substance aflibercept. It belongs to a group of medicines called 
antineovascularistion agents.  
Your doctor will inject Eylea into your eye to treat eye disorders in adults called: 
- 
- 
wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) 
visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME). 
These disorders affect the macula. The macula is the central part of the light sensitive membrane at the 
back of the eye. It is responsible for clear vision. 
Wet AMD is caused when abnormal blood vessels form and grow below the macula. The abnormal 
blood vessels may leak fluid or blood into the eye. Leaky blood vessels that cause swelling of the 
macula cause DME. Both disorders may impact your vision. 
How Eylea works 
Eylea stops growth of new abnormal blood vessels in the eye. Eylea can help to stabilise and often 
improve vision. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive Eylea  
You will not receive Eylea if you 
- 
- 
- 
are allergic to aflibercept or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
have an infection in or around the eye 
have pain or redness in your eye (severe eye inflammation). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before receiving Eylea if you: 
- 
- 
have glaucoma – an eye condition caused by high pressure in the eye 
have a history of seeing flashes of light or dark floating spots and if their size or number 
suddenly increases 
had eye surgery in the last 4 weeks or eye surgery is planned in the next 4 weeks. 
- 
128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Tell your doctor immediately if you develop: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
These may be symptoms of an inflammation or infection and your doctor may stop giving you Eylea. 
redness of the eye  
eye pain 
increased discomfort 
blurred or decreased vision 
increased sensitivity to light 
Furthermore, it is important for you to know that: 
- 
the safety and efficacy of Eylea when administered to both eyes at the same time have not been 
studied and such use may increase risk of experiencing side effects. 
injections with Eylea may cause an increase in eye pressure in some patients within 60 minutes 
of the injection. Your doctor will monitor this after each injection. 
your doctor will check for other risk factors that may increase the chance of a tear or 
detachment of one of the layers at the back of the eye. In such cases your doctor will give you 
Eylea with caution. 
women who could become pregnant must use effective birth control during treatment and for at 
least 4 months after the last injection of Eylea. 
The use of substances similar to those contained in Eylea is potentially related to the risk of blood 
clots blocking blood vessels, which may lead to heart attack or stroke. Theoretically, this could also 
happen after an injection of Eylea into the eye. If you had a stroke, a mini-stroke or a heart attack 
within the last 6 months, your doctor will give you Eylea with caution.  
Children and adolescents 
The use of Eylea in children or adolescents under 18 has not been studied because the diseases 
indicated occur mainly in adults. Therefore, its use in this age group is not relevant. 
Other medicines and Eylea 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
- 
Women who could become pregnant must use effective birth control during treatment and for at 
least 4 months after the last injection of Eylea. 
There is no experience on the use of Eylea in pregnant women. Women should not receive 
Eylea during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the woman outweighs the potential risk to 
the unborn child. 
Small amounts of Eylea may pass into human milk. The effect on breast-fed newborns/infants 
are unknown. Eylea is not recommended during breast-feeding. 
Therefore, if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby, ask your doctor for advice before you receive this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
After receiving Eylea, you may experience some temporary vision problems. Do not drive or use 
machines as long as these last. 
3. 
How Eylea will be given 
The recommended dose is 8 mg aflibercept per injection. 
- 
- 
You will receive 1 injection every month for the first 3 months. 
After that, you may receive injections up to every 5 months. Your doctor will decide on the 
frequency based on the condition of your eye. 
129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Method of administration 
Your doctor will inject Eylea into your eye (intravitreal injection). 
Before the injection, your doctor will use a disinfectant eyewash to clean your eye carefully to prevent 
infection. Your doctor will give you an eye drop (local anaesthetic) to numb the eye to reduce or 
prevent pain from the injection. 
If you missed a dose of Eylea 
Make a new appointment with your doctor as soon as possible. 
Before stopping Eylea treatment 
Speak with your doctor before stopping treatment. Stopping treatment may increase your risk of vision 
loss and your vision may worsen. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. 
4.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
The vial is for single use in one eye only. Extraction of multiple doses from a single vial may increase 
the risk of contamination and subsequent infection. 
Do not use if the package or its components are expired, damaged, or have been tampered with. 
Check the label on the vial to make sure you have the strength of Eylea that you intended to use. The 
8 mg dose requires use of the Eylea 114.3 mg/ml vial. 
The intravitreal injection should be performed with a 30 G × ½ inch injection needle (not included). 
1.  Prior to administration visually inspect the solution for injection. 
Do not use the vial if particulates, cloudiness, or discolouration are visible. 
2.  Remove the plastic cap and disinfect the 
outer part of the rubber stopper of the vial. 
3.  Use aseptic technique to carry out steps 3-10. 
Attach the filter needle supplied in the carton 
to a 1-ml sterile, Luer-lock syringe. 
4.  Push the filter needle into the centre of the vial stopper until the needle is completely inserted 
into the vial and the tip touches the bottom or bottom edge of the vial.

5.  Withdraw all of the Eylea vial content into the syringe, keeping the vial in an upright position, 
slightly inclined to ease complete withdrawal. To deter the introduction of air, ensure the 
bevel of the filter needle is submerged into the liquid. Continue to tilt the vial during 
withdrawal keeping the bevel of the filter needle submerged in the liquid.

6.  Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when emptying the vial to completely 
empty the filter needle. After injection any unused product must be discarded. 
7.  Remove the filter needle and properly dispose of it. 
Note: The filter needle is not to be used for the intravitreal injection. 
8.  Firmly twist the 30 G × ½ inch injection 
needle onto the Luer-lock syringe tip. 
9.  Holding the syringe with the needle pointing 
up, check the syringe for bubbles. If there are 
bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your 
finger until the bubbles rise to the top.

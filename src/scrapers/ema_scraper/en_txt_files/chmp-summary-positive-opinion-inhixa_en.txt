Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Inhixa 
enoxaparin sodium 
On 21 July 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, 
recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Inhixa, intended for 
prevention and treatment of various disorders related to blood clots in adults. The applicant for this 
medicinal product is Techdow Europe AB. 
Inhixa will be available as a solution for injection [2,000 IU (20 mg) in 0.2 mL, 4,000 IU (40 mg) in 0.4 mL, 
6,000 IU (60 mg) in 0.6 mL, 8,000 IU (80 mg) in 0.8 mL and 10,000 IU (100 mg) in 1 mL]. The active 
substance of Inhixa is enoxaparin sodium, an antithrombotic agent (ATC code: B01AB05). Enoxaparin 
sodium is a low-molecular weight heparin that has a high activity against the blood clotting factor Xa and a 
low anti-factor IIa or antithrombin activity.  
The benefits with Inhixa are its ability to treat blood clots formed in blood vessels and to stop blood clots 
forming in blood vessels.  
The most common side effect is haemorrhage which can be severe and in some cases fatal. Other adverse 
reactions include thrombocytopenia (including immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia), allergic reactions 
(including anaphylactic /anaphylactoid reaction), hyperkalaemia, injection site reactions, increased hepatic 
enzymes, hepatitis, skin and subcutaneous disorders (urticaria, pruritus, erythema bullous dermatitis) and 
osteoporosis (following long-term therapy).  
The full indication is: 
“Inhixa is indicated for adults for: 
Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, particularly in patients undergoing orthopaedic, general or 
oncological surgery. 
Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients bedridden due to acute illnesses including acute 
heart failure, acute respiratory failure, severe infections, as well as exacerbation of rheumatic 
diseases causing immobilisation of the patient (applies to strengths of 40 mg/0.4 mL).

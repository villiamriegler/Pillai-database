CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of adults, adolescents and children 6 years or older, with diabetes mellitus, where treatment 
with insulin is required. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The potency of this preparation is stated in units. These units are exclusive to Apidra and are not the 
same as IU or the units used to express the potency of other insulin analogues (see section 5.1). 
Apidra should be used in regimens that include an intermediate or long acting insulin or basal insulin 
analogue and can be used with oral hypoglycaemic agents. 
The dose of Apidra should be individually adjusted.

Special populations 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetic properties of insulin glulisine are generally maintained in patients with renal 
impairment. However, insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment (see 
section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetic properties of insulin glulisine have not been investigated in patients with 
decreased liver function. In patients with hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished 
due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. 
Elderly 
Limited pharmacokinetic data are available in elderly patients with diabetes mellitus. Deterioration of 
renal function may lead to a decrease in insulin requirements. 
Paediatric population 
There is insufficient clinical information on the use of Apidra in children younger than the age of 
6 years. 
Method of administration 
Apidra 100 Units/ml solution for injection in a vial 
Intravenous use 
Apidra can be administered intravenously. This should be carried out by healthcare professionals. 
Apidra must not be mixed with glucose or Ringer’s solution or with any other insulin. 
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion 
Apidra may be used for Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) in pump systems suitable 
for insulin infusion with the appropriate catheters and reservoirs. Patients using CSII should be 
comprehensively instructed on the use of the pump system. 
The infusion set and reservoir used with Apidra must be changed at least every 48 hours using aseptic 
technique. These instructions may differ from general pump manual instructions. It is important that 
patients follow the Apidra specific instructions when using Apidra. Failure to follow Apidra specific 
instructions may lead to serious adverse events. 
When used with a subcutaneous insulin infusion pump, Apidra must not be mixed with diluents or any 
other insulin. 
Patients administering Apidra by CSII must have an alternative insulin delivery system available in 
case of pump system failure (see section 4.4 and 4.8). 
Apidra 100 Units/ml solution for injection in a vial 
For further details on handling, see section 6.6. 
Apidra 100 Units/ml solution for injection in a cartridge 
Apidra 100 Units/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable pen. If 
administration by syringe, intravenous injection or infusion pump is necessary, a vial should be used 
(see section 4.4). For further details on handling, see section 6.6. 
Apidra SoloStar 100 Units/ml solution for injection in a pre-filled pen 
Apidra  SoloStar  100  Units/ml  in  pre-filled  pen  is  only  suitable  for  subcutaneous  injections.  If 
administration by syringe, intravenous injection or infusion pump is necessary, a vial should be used 
(see section 4.4). 
Subcutaneous use 
Apidra should be given by subcutaneous injection shortly (0-15 min) before or soon after meals or by 
continuous subcutaneous pump infusion. 
Apidra should be administered subcutaneously in the abdominal wall, thigh or deltoid or by 
continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. Injection sites and infusion sites within an injection area 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(abdomen, thigh or deltoid) should be rotated from one injection to the next in order to reduce the risk 
of lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8).  
The rate of absorption, and consequently the onset and duration of action, may be affected by the 
injection site, exercise and other variables. Subcutaneous injection in the abdominal wall ensures a 
slightly faster absorption than other injection sites (see section 5.2). 
Care should be taken to ensure that a blood vessel has not been entered. After injection, the site of 
injection should not be massaged. Patients must be educated to use proper injection techniques. 
Mixing with insulins 
When administered as a subcutaneous injection, Apidra must not be mixed with other medicinal 
products except NPH human insulin. 
For further details on handling, see section 6.6. 
Before using SoloStar, the Instructions for use included in the Package leaflet must be read carefully 
(see section 6.6). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypoglycaemia. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, neutral protamine Hagedorn 
[NPH], lente, long-acting, etc.), origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of 
manufacture may result in the need for a change in dose. Concomitant oral antidiabetic treatment may 
need to be adjusted. 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin 
absorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A 
sudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. 
Blood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment 
of antidiabetic medications may be considered. 
Hyperglycaemia 
The use of inadequate doses or discontinuation of treatment, especially in insulin-dependent diabetic, 
may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are potentially lethal. 
Hypoglycaemia 
The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the insulins used and may, 
therefore, change when the treatment regimen is changed. 
Conditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less 
pronounced include long duration of diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, diabetic nerve disease, 
medicinal products such as beta blockers or after transfer from animal-source insulin to human insulin. 
Adjustment of dose may be also necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change 
their usual meal plan. Exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of 
hypoglycaemia. 
When compared with soluble human insulin, if hypoglycaemia occurs after an injection with rapid 
acting analogues, it may occur earlier. 
Uncorrected hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness, coma, or 
death.

Insulin requirements may be altered during illness or emotional disturbances. 
Apidra 100 Units/ml solution for injection in a cartridge 
Pens to be used with Apidra 100 units/ml solution for injection in a cartridge 
Apidra 100 units/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable pen. If 
administration by syringe, intravenous injection or infusion pump is necessary, a vial should be used. 
The Apidra cartridges should only be used with the following pens: 
JuniorSTAR which delivers Apidra in 0.5 unit dose increments 
− 
−  ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar and AllStar PRO which all deliver Apidra in 1 unit dose 
increments. 
These cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been 
established with the listed pens (see section 4.2 and 6.6). 
Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. 
Medication errors 
Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins, particularly long-acting insulins, have 
been accidentally administered instead of insulin glulisine. Insulin label must always be checked 
before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin glulisine and other insulins. 
Apidra 100 Units/ml solution for injection in a vial 
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion 
Malfunction of the insulin pump or infusion set or handling errors can rapidly lead to hyperglycaemia, 
ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis. Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycaemia 
or ketosis or diabetic ketoacidosis is necessary. 
Cases of diabetic ketoacidosis have been reported when Apidra has been given in continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion in pump systems. Most of the cases were related to handling errors or 
pump system failure. 
Interim subcutaneous injections with Apidra may be required. Patients using continuous subcutaneous 
insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have alternative 
insulin delivery system available in case of pump system failure (see section 4.2 and 4.8). 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Apidra contains metacresol, which may cause allergic reactions. 
Combination of Apidra with pioglitazone 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in 
mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Apidra is considered. If the combination is 
used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. 
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. 
Apidra SoloStar 100 Units/ml solution for injection in a pre-filled pen 
Handling of the SoloStar pre-filled pen 
Apidra SoloStar 100 units/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe, intravenous injection or infusion pump is necessary, a vial should be used. 
Before using SoloStar, the Instructions for use included in the Package leaflet must be read carefully. 
SoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for use (see section 6.6). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Studies on pharmacokinetic interactions have not been performed. Based on empirical knowledge 
from similar medicinal products, clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely to occur. 
A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of insulin 
glulisine and particularly close monitoring. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering activity and increase susceptibility to 
hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), pentoxifylline, 
propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. 
Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering activity include corticosteroids, danazol, 
diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic 
medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, 
oestrogens, progestins (e.g. in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic 
medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). 
Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the 
blood-glucose-lowering activity of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia, which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, 
guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 
4.6  Pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of insulin 
glulisine in pregnant women. 
Animal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin glulisine and human 
insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see 
section 5.3). 
Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. Careful monitoring of glucose 
control is essential. 
It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control 
throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally 
increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements 
decline rapidly. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether insulin glulisine is excreted in human milk, but in general insulin does not pass 
into breast milk and is not absorbed after oral administration. 
Breast-feeding mothers may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. 
Fertility 
Animal reproduction studies with insulin glulisine have not revealed any adverse effects on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or 
hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in 
situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or operating machines). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be 
considered in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypoglycaemia, the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the insulin dose is 
too high in relation to the insulin requirement. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Description of selected adverse reactions 
•  Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
Symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale skin, 
fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in 
concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation. 
Hypoglycaemia can become severe and may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may 
result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. 
Apidra 100 Units/ml solution for injection in a vial 
Cases of hyperglycaemia have been reported with Apidra when used with CSII (see section 4.4) that 
has led to Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA); most of the cases were related to handling errors or pump 
system failure. The patient should always follow the Apidra specific instructions and always have 
access to alternative insulin delivery system in case of pump system failure. 
•  Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur during 
treatment with insulin. These reactions are usually transitory and normally they disappear during 
continued treatment. 
Lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin 
absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce 
or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
•  General disorders and administration site conditions 
Systemic hypersensitivity reactions may include urticaria, chest tightness, dyspnoea, allergic 
dermatitis and pruritus. Severe cases of generalized allergy, including anaphylactic reaction, may be 
life-threatening. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy 
expenditure. 
There are no specific data available concerning overdoses with insulin glulisine. However, 
hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages. 
Management 
Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products. It is 
therefore recommended that the diabetic patient constantly carries some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits 
or sugary fruit juice. 
Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated by 
glucagon (0.5 mg to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received 
appropriate instruction, or by glucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. Glucose must 
also be given intravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. 
Upon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in 
order to prevent relapse. 
After an injection of glucagon, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to find the reason 
for this severe hypoglycaemia and prevent other similar episodes.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting. 
ATC code: A10AB06 
Mechanism of action 
Insulin glulisine is a recombinant human insulin analogue that is equipotent to regular human insulin. 
Insulin glulisine has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action than regular human 
insulin. 
The primary activity of insulins and insulin analogues, including insulin glulisine, is regulation of 
glucose metabolism. Insulins lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, 
especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits 
lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis. 
Studies in healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that insulin glulisine is more 
rapid in onset of action and of shorter duration of action than regular human insulin when given 
subcutaneously. When insulin glulisine is injected subcutaneously, the glucose lowering activity will 
begin within 10-20 minutes. After intravenous administration, a faster onset and shorter duration of 
action, as well as a greater peak response were observed as compared with subcutaneous 
administration. The glucose-lowering activities of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin are 
equipotent when administered by intravenous route. 
One unit of insulin glulisine has the same glucose-lowering activity as one unit of regular human 
insulin. 
Dose proportionality 
In a study with 18 male subjects with diabetes mellitus type 1 aged 21 to 50 years, insulin glulisine 
displayed dose-proportional glucose lowering effect in the therapeutic relevant dose range 0.075 to 
0.15 Units/kg, and less than proportional increase in glucose lowering effect with 0.3 Units/kg or 
higher, like human insulin. 
Insulin glulisine takes effect about twice as fast as regular human insulin and completes the glucose 
lowering effect about 2 hours earlier than regular human insulin. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A phase I study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus assessed the glucose lowering profiles of 
insulin glulisine and regular human insulin administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.15 Units/kg, at 
different times in relation to a 15-minute standard meal. Data indicated that insulin glulisine 
administered 2 minutes before the meal gives similar postprandial glycaemic control compared to 
regular human insulin given 30 minutes before the meal. When given 2 minutes prior to meal, insulin 
glulisine provided better postprandial control than regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the 
meal. Insulin glulisine administered 15 minutes after starting the meal gives similar glycaemic control 
as regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the meal (see figure 1).

Obesity 
A phase I study carried out with insulin glulisine, lispro and regular human insulin in an obese 
population has demonstrated that insulin glulisine maintains its rapid-acting properties. In this study, 
the time to 20% of total AUC and the AUC (0-2h) representing the early glucose lowering activity 
were respectively of 114 minutes and 427 mg/kg for insulin glulisine, 121 minutes and 354 mg/kg for 
lispro, 150 minutes and 197 mg/kg for regular human insulin (see figure 2).

Figure 2: Glucose infusion rates (GIR) after subcutaneous injection of 0.3 Units/kg of insulin glulisine 
(GLULISINE) or insulin lispro (LISPRO) or regular human insulin (REGULAR) in an obese 
population. 
Another phase I study with insulin glulisine and insulin lispro in a non-diabetic population in 
80 subjects with a wide range of body mass indices (18-46 kg/m²) has demonstrated that rapid action 
is generally maintained across a wide range of body mass indices (BMI), while total glucose lowering 
effect decreases with increasing obesity. 
The average total GIR AUC between 0-1 hour was 102 ± 75 mg/kg and 158 ± 100 mg/kg with 0.2 and 
0.4 Units/kg insulin glulisine, respectively, and was 83.1 ± 72.8 mg/kg and 112.3 ± 70.8 mg/kg with 
0.2 and 0.4 Units/kg insulin lispro, respectively.  
A phase I study in 18 obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (BMI between 35 and 40 kg/m2) 
with insulin glulisine and insulin lispro [90% CI: 0.81, 0.95 (p=<0.01)] has shown that insulin 
glulisine effectively controls diurnal postprandial blood glucose excursions. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus–Adults 
In a 26-week phase III clinical study comparing insulin glulisine with insulin lispro both injected 
subcutaneously shortly (0-15 minutes) before a meal in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus using 
insulin glargine as basal insulin, insulin glulisine was comparable to insulin lispro for glycaemic 
control as reflected by changes in glycated haemoglobin (expressed as HbA1c equivalent) from 
baseline to endpoint. Comparable self-monitored blood glucose values were observed. No increase in 
the basal insulin dose was needed with insulin glulisine, in contrast to insulin lispro. 
A 12-week phase III clinical study performed in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus receiving 
insulin glargine as basal therapy indicate that the immediate post-meal administration of insulin 
glulisine provides efficacy that was comparable to immediate pre-meal insulin glulisine (0-15 minutes) 
or regular insulin (30-45 minutes). 
In the per-protocol population there was a significantly larger observed reduction in GHb in the 
pre-meal glulisine group compared with the regular insulin group. 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus–Paediatric 
A 26-week phase III clinical study compared insulin glulisine with insulin lispro both injected 
subcutaneously shortly (0-15 minutes) before a meal in children (4-5 years: n=9; 6-7 years: n=32 and 
8-11 years: n=149) and adolescents (12-17 years: n=382) with type 1 diabetes mellitus using insulin 
glargine or NPH as basal insulin. Insulin glulisine was comparable to insulin lispro for glycaemic 
control as reflected by changes in glycated haemoglobin (GHb expressed as HbA1c equivalent) from 
baseline to endpoint and by self-monitored blood glucose values. 
There is insufficient clinical information on the use of Apidra in children younger than the age of 
6 years. 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus–Adults 
A 26-week phase III clinical study followed by a 26-week extension safety study was conducted to 
compare insulin glulisine (0-15 minutes before a meal) with regular human insulin (30-45 minutes 
before a meal) injected subcutaneously in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus also using NPH 
insulin as basal insulin. The average body mass index (BMI) of patients was 34.55 kg/m2. Insulin 
glulisine was shown to be comparable to regular human insulin with regard to glycated haemoglobin 
(expressed as HbA1c equivalent) changes from baseline to the 6-month endpoint (-0.46% for insulin 
glulisine and -0.30% for regular human insulin, p=0.0029) and from baseline to the 12-month endpoint 
(-0.23% for insulin glulisine and -0.13% for regular human insulin, difference not significant). In this 
study, the majority of patients (79%) mixed their short acting insulin with NPH insulin immediately 
prior to injection and 58% of subjects used oral hypoglycaemic agents at randomization and were 
instructed to continue to use them at the same dose. 
Race and gender 
In controlled clinical studies in adults, insulin glulisine did not show differences in safety and efficacy 
in subgroup analyses based on race and gender.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
In insulin glulisine the replacement of the human insulin amino acid asparagine in position B3 by 
lysine and the lysine in position B29 by glutamic acid favours more rapid absorption. 
In a study with 18 male subjects with diabetes mellitus type 1, aged 21 to 50 years, insulin glulisine 
displays dose-proportionality for early, maximum and total exposure in the dose range 
0.075 to 0.4 Units/kg. 
Absorption and bioavailability 
Pharmacokinetic profiles in healthy volunteers and diabetes patients (type 1 or 2) demonstrated that 
absorption of insulin glulisine was about twice as fast with a peak concentration approximately twice 
as high as compared to regular human insulin. 
In a study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.15 Units/kg, 
for insulin glulisine the Tmax was 55 minutes and Cmax was 82 ± 1.3 µUnits/ml compared to a Tmax of 
82 minutes and a Cmax of 46 ± 1.3 µUnits/ml for regular human insulin. The mean residence time of 
insulin glulisine was shorter (98 min) than for regular human insulin (161 min) (see figure 3). 
Figure 3: Pharmacokinetic profile of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin in type 1 diabetes 
mellitus patients after a dose of 0.15 Units/kg. 
In a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.2 Units/kg 
insulin glulisine, the Cmax was 91 µUnits/ml with the interquartile range from 78 to 104 µUnits/ml. 
When insulin glulisine was injected subcutaneously into abdomen, deltoid and thigh, the 
concentration-time profiles were similar with a slightly faster absorption when administered in the 
abdomen compared to the thigh. Absorption from deltoid sites was in-between (see section 4.2). The 
absolute bioavailability (70%) of insulin glulisine was similar between injection sites and of low 
intra-subject variability (11% CV). Intravenous bolus administration of insulin glulisine resulted in a 
higher systemic exposure when compared to subcutaneous injection, with a Cmax approximately 
40-fold higher. 
Obesity 
Another phase I study with insulin glulisine and insulin lispro in a non-diabetic population in 
80 subjects with a wide range of body mass indices (18-46 kg/m²) has demonstrated that rapid 
absorption and total exposure is generally maintained across a wide range of body mass indices. 
The time to 10% of total INS exposure was reached earlier by approximately 5-6 min with insulin 
glulisine. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution and elimination 
The distribution and elimination of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin after intravenous 
administration is similar with volumes of distribution of 13 l and 22 l and half-lives of 13 and 
18 minutes, respectively. 
After subcutaneous administration, insulin glulisine is eliminated more rapidly than regular human 
insulin with an apparent half-life of 42 minutes compared to 86 minutes. In an across study analysis of 
insulin glulisine in either healthy subjects or subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus the 
apparent half-life ranged from 37 to 75 minutes (interquartile range). 
Insulin glulisine shows low plasma protein binding, similar to human insulin. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
In a clinical study performed in non-diabetic subjects covering a wide range of renal function 
(CrCl >80 ml/min, 30-50 ml/min, <30 ml/min), the rapid-acting properties of insulin glulisine were 
generally maintained. However, insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal 
impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetic properties have not been investigated in patients with impaired liver function. 
Elderly 
Very limited pharmacokinetic data are available for elderly patients with diabetes mellitus. 
Children and adolescents 
The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of insulin glulisine were investigated in 
children (7-11 years) and adolescents (12-16 years) with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Insulin glulisine was 
rapidly absorbed in both age groups, with similar Tmax and Cmax as in adults (see section 4.2). 
Administered immediately before a test meal, insulin glulisine provided better postprandial control 
than regular human insulin, as in adults (see section 5.1). The glucose excursion (AUC 0-6h) was 
641 mg.h.dl-1 for insulin glulisine and 801 mg.h.dl-1 for regular human insulin. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data did not reveal toxicity findings others than those linked to the blood glucose 
lowering pharmacodynamic activity (hypoglycaemia), different from regular human insulin or of 
clinical relevance for humans.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Apidra 100 Units/ml solution for injection in a vial 
Subcutaneous use 
Apidra vials are for use with insulin syringes with the corresponding unit scale and for use with an 
insulin pump system (see section 4.2). 
Inspect the vial before use. It must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid 
particles visible. Since Apidra is a solution, it does not require resuspension before use. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin 
glulisine and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
Mixing with insulins 
When mixed with NPH human insulin, Apidra should be drawn into the syringe first. Injection should 
be given immediately after mixing as no data are available regarding the mixtures made up a 
significant time before injection. 
Continuous subcutaneous infusion pump 
Refer to section 4.2 and 4.4 for advice. 
Intravenous use 
Apidra should be used at a concentration of 1 Unit/ml insulin glulisine in infusion systems with 
sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion with or without 40 mmol/l potassium chloride 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
using coextruded polyolefin/polyamide plastic infusion bags with a dedicated infusion line. Insulin 
glulisine for intravenous use at a concentration of 1 Unit/ml is stable at room temperature for 48 hours. 
After dilution for intravenous use, the solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior 
to administration. It must only be used if the solution is clear and colourless, not when cloudy or with 
visible particles. 
Apidra was found to be incompatible with Glucose 5% solution and Ringer’s solution and, therefore, 
must not be used with these solution fluids. The use of other solutions has not been studied. 
Apidra 100 Units/ml solution for injection in a cartridge 
Apidra 100 units/ml in a cartridge is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable pen. If 
administration by syringe, intravenous injection or infusion pump is necessary, a vial should be used. 
The Apidra cartridges are to be used only in conjunction with the pens: ClikSTAR, Autopen 24, 
Tactipen, AllStar, AllStar PRO or JuniorSTAR (see section 4.2 and 4.4). Not all of these pens may be 
marketed in your country. 
The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer.  
The manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, 
attaching the needle, and administering the insulin injection. Inspect the cartridge before use. It must 
only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible. Before insertion of the 
cartridge into the reusable pen, the cartridge must be stored at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours. Air 
bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instruction for using pen). Empty 
cartridges must not be refilled. 
If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be 
discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. 
To prevent any kind of contamination, the re-usable pen should be used by a single patient only. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin 
glulisine and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
Apidra SoloStar 100 Units/ml solution for injection in a pre-filled pen 
Apidra SoloStar 100 units/ml in a pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe, intravenous injection or infusion pump is necessary, a vial should be used. 
Before first use, the pen must be stored at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours. 
Inspect the cartridge before use. It must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid 
particles visible, and if it is of water-like consistency. Since Apidra is a solution, it does not require 
resuspension before use. 
Empty pens must never be reused and must be properly discarded. 
To prevent any kind of contamination, the use of the pre-filled pen should remain strictly for a single 
patient use. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin 
glulisine and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
Handling of the pen 
The patient should be advised to read the instructions for use included in the package leaflet 
carefully before using SoloStar.

•  Before each use, a new needle must always be carefully attached and a safety test must be 
performed. A dose should not be selected and/or the injection button should not be pressed 
without a needle attached. Only use needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar. 
•  Special caution must be taken to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. 
•  SoloStar must never be used if it is damaged or if the patient is not sure if it is working 
properly. 
•  The patient must always have a spare SoloStar available in case the SoloStar is lost or 
damaged. 
Storage instructions 
Please check section 6.4 of this SPC for instructions on how to store SoloStar. 
If SoloStar is in cool storage, it should be taken out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm 
up. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. 
The used SoloStar must be discarded as required by your local authorities. 
Maintenance 
SoloStar has to be protected from dust and dirt. 
The outside of the SoloStar can be cleaned by wiping it with a damp cloth. 
The pen must not be soaked, washed or lubricated as this may damage it. 
SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. The patient should 
avoid situations where SoloStar may be damaged. If the patient is concerned that the SoloStar may be 
damaged, he must use a new one. 
Step 1 
Check the insulin 
The label on the pen should be checked to make sure it contains the correct insulin. The Apidra 
SoloStar is blue. It has a dark blue injection button with a raised ring on the top. After removing the 
pen cap, the appearance of insulin should also be checked: the insulin solution must be clear, 
colourless, with no solid particles visible, and must have a water-like consistency. 
Step 2 
Attach the needle 
Only needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar should be used. 
A new sterile needle will be always used for each injection. After removing the cap, the needle should 
be carefully attached straight onto the pen. 
Step 3 
Perform a safety test 
Prior to each injection a safety test has to be performed to ensure that pen and needle work properly 
and to remove air bubbles. 
A dose of 2 units has to be selected. 
The outer and inner needle caps should be removed. 
While holding the pen with the needle pointing upwards, the insulin reservoir should be tapped gently 
with the finger so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. 
Then the injection button should be pressed in completely. 
If insulin has been expelled through the needle tip, then the pen and the needle are working properly. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If no insulin appears at the needle tip, step 3 should be repeated until insulin appears at the needle tip. 
Step 4  
Select the dose 
The dose can be set in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If a dose 
greater than 80 units is required, it should be given as two or more injections. 
The dose window must show “0” following the safety test. The dose can then be selected. 
Step 5 
Inject the dose 
The patient should be informed on the injection technique by his health care professional. 
The needle should be inserted into the skin. 
The injection button should be pressed in completely. Then the injection button should be held down 
10 seconds before withdrawing the needle. This ensures that the full dose of insulin has been injected. 
Step 6 
Remove and discard the needle 
The needle should always be removed after each injection and discarded. This helps prevent 
contamination and/or infection, entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin. Needles 
must not be reused. 
Special caution must be taken when removing and disposing the needle. Recommended safety 
measures for removal and disposal of needles must be followed (e.g. a one handed capping technique) 
in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases. 
The pen cap should be replaced on the pen.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Apidra is and what it is used for 
Apidra is an antidiabetic agent, used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus; it 
may be given to adults, adolescents and children, 6 years of age and older. Diabetes mellitus is a 
disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. 
It is made by biotechnology. It has a rapid onset within 10-20 minutes and a short duration, about 4 
hours. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Apidra 
Do not use Apidra 
- 
- 
If you are allergic to insulin glulisine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), follow the guidance for hypoglycaemia (see 
box at the end of this leaflet). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Apidra. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood tests), diet and physical activity (physical 
work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidney problems, speak to your doctor as you may need a lower dose. 
There is insufficient clinical information on the use of Apidra in children younger than the age of 
6 years. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Apidra). Contact your doctor 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your 
doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other 
antidiabetic medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc, 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require extra care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you 
require insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Apidra 
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: 
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulphonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: 
- 
- 
- 
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Apidra with alcohol 
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Careful control of your 
diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
There are no or limited data on the use of Apidra in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels). 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines).  
You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.

Important information about some of the ingredients of Apidra 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
Apidra contains metacresol 
Apidra contains metacresol, which may cause allergic reactions. 
3.  How to use Apidra 
Dose 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin 
usage, your doctor will determine how much Apidra you will need. 
Apidra is a short-acting insulin. Your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with an 
intermediate, long-acting insulin, a basal insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels. 
If you switch from another insulin to insulin glulisine, your dosage may have to be adjusted by your 
doctor. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are 
able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high 
or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Method of administration 
Apidra is injected under the skin (subcutaneously). It may also be given intravenously by healthcare 
professionals under close supervision by a doctor. 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject Apidra. Apidra can be injected 
in the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or by continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. The 
effect will be slightly quicker if the insulin is injected into your abdomen. As for all insulins, injection 
sites and infusion sites within an-injection area (abdomen, thigh or upper arm) must be rotated from 
one injection to the next. 
Frequency of administration 
Apidra should be taken shortly (0-15 minutes) before or soon after meals. 
Instructions for proper use 
How to handle the vials 
Apidra vials are for use with insulin syringes with the corresponding unit scale and for use with an 
insulin pump system. 
Look at the vial before you use it. Only use it if the solution is clear, colourless and has no visible 
particles in it. 
Do not shake or mix it before use. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This 
is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem 
with Apidra, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. 
If you have to mix two types of insulin 
Apidra must not be mixed with any preparation other than NPH human insulin. 
If Apidra is mixed with NPH human insulin, Apidra should be drawn into the syringe first. Injection 
should be given immediately after mixing. 
How to handle an infusion pump system 
Before using Apidra in the pump system you should have been given detailed instructions on how to 
use the pump system. In addition, you should have been provided with information about what to do if 
you become ill or if your blood sugar levels get too high or too low, or if the pump system fails.  
Use the pump system recommended by your doctor. Read and follow the instructions that come with 
your insulin infusion pump. Follow your doctor’s instructions about the basal infusion rate and the 
mealtime insulin boluses to be taken. Measure your blood sugar level regularly to make sure you get 
the benefit of the insulin infusion and to make sure that the pump is working properly. 
Change the infusion set and reservoir at least every 48 hours using aseptic technique. These 
instructions may differ from the instructions that come with your insulin infusion pump. When you use 
Apidra in the pump system, it is important that you always follow these specific instructions. Failure 
to follow these specific instructions may lead to serious adverse events. 
Apidra must never be mixed with diluents or any other insulin when used in a pump. 
What to do if the pump system fails or when the pump is used incorrectly 
Pump or infusion set problems or using the pump incorrectly can result in you not getting enough 
insulin. This can quickly cause you to have high blood sugar and diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of 
acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar).  
If your blood sugar level starts to rise, contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as soon as possible. 
They will tell you what needs to be done. 
You may need to use Apidra with syringes or pens. You should always have an alternative insulin 
delivery system available for injection under the skin in case the pump system fails. 
If you use more Apidra than you should 
- If you have injected too much Apidra, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must 
eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see 
box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Apidra 
- If you have missed a dose of Apidra or if you have not injected enough insulin, your blood sugar 
level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on 
the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Apidra 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Apidra without 
speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups 
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Apidra and 
other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious side effects 
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) can be very serious. Hypoglycaemia is a very commonly 
reported side effect (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means 
that there is not enough sugar in the blood. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may 
become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If 
you have symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions to increase your blood sugar level immediately. 
See the box at the end of this leaflet for important further information about hypoglycaemia and its 
treatment. 
If you experience the following symptoms, contact your doctor immediately: 
Systemic allergic reactions are side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
Generalised allergy to insulin: Associated symptoms may include large-scale skin reactions (rash 
and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angioedema), shortness 
of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heartbeat and sweating. These could be symptoms of 
severe cases of generalised allergy to insulin, including anaphylactic reaction, which may be 
life-threatening. 
Hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) means that there is too much sugar in the blood. The 
frequency of hyperglycaemia cannot be estimated. If your blood sugar level is too high, this tells you 
that you may need more insulin than you have injected.  
Hyperglycaemia can cause diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body 
is breaking down fat instead of sugar). 
These are serious side effects. 
These conditions can happen when there are problems with the infusion pump or when the 
pump system is used incorrectly. 
This means you may not always get enough insulin to treat your diabetes. 
If this happens you must seek urgent medical help. 
Always have available an alternative insulin delivery system for injection under the skin (see 
section 3 under “How to handle an infusion pump system” and “What to do if the pump system fails or 
when the pump is used incorrectly”). 
For more information on signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia refer to the box at the end of this 
leaflet. 
Other side effects 
•  Skin changes at the injection site:  
If you inject insulin too often at the same place, the fatty tissue may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or 
thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). Lumps under the skin may also be 
caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not 
known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site 
with each injection to help prevent these skin changes. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skin and allergic reactions at the injection site 
Common reported side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
• 
Reactions at the injection site may occur (such as reddening, unusually intense pain on injection, 
itching, hives, swelling or inflammation). They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor 
reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. 
Eye reactions 
Side effects where the frequency cannot be estimated from the available data 
• 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA 
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are a person with diabetes. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur? 
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Apidra"). 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia 
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia? 
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur? 
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and  
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT  
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Apidra"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
- 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia 
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions and loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
you are elderly, 
you have had diabetes for a long time, 
you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Apidra). 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing 
can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia? 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS INTENDED FOR HEALTHCARE 
PROFESSIONALS ONLY: 
Apidra can be administered intravenously, which should be carried out by healthcare professionals. 
Instruction for intravenous administration 
Apidra should be used at a concentration of 1 Unit/ml insulin glulisine in infusion systems with 
sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion with or without 40 mmol/l potassium chloride 
using coextruded polyolefin/polyamide plastic infusion bags with a dedicated infusion line. Insulin 
glulisine for intravenous use at a concentration of 1 Unit/ml is stable at room temperature for 48 hours. 
After dilution for intravenous use, the solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior 
to administration. Never use the solution if it has become cloudy or contains particles; use it only if it 
is clear and colourless. 
Apidra was found to be incompatible with Glucose 5% solution and Ringer’s solution and, therefore, 
must not be used with these solution fluids. The use of other solutions has not been studied.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Apidra is and what it is used for 
Apidra is an antidiabetic agent, used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus; it 
may be given to adults, adolescents and children, 6 years of age and older. Diabetes mellitus is a 
disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. 
It is made by biotechnology. It has a rapid onset within 10-20 minutes and a short duration, about 4 
hours. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Apidra 
Do not use Apidra 
- 
- 
If you are allergic to insulin glulisine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), follow the guidance for hypoglycaemia (see 
box at the end of this leaflet). 
Warnings and precautions 
Apidra in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen (see also 
section 3). Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Apidra. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood tests), diet and physical activity (physical 
work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidney problems, speak to your doctor as you may need a lower dose. 
There is insufficient clinical information on the use of Apidra in children younger than the age of 
6 years. 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Apidra). Contact your doctor 
if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your 
doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other 
antidiabetic medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
supplies of insulin, needles, etc, 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require extra care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you 
require insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Apidra 
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: 
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),  
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulphonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: 
- 
- 
- 
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Apidra with alcohol 
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Careful control of your 
diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
There are no or limited data on the use of Apidra in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
-  
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels).  
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). 
You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.

Important information about some of the ingredients of Apidra 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
Apidra contains metacresol 
Apidra contains metacresol, which may cause allergic reactions. 
3.  How to use Apidra 
Dose 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin 
usage, your doctor will determine how much Apidra you will need. 
Apidra is a short-acting insulin. Your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with an 
intermediate, long acting insulin, a basal insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels. 
If you switch from another insulin to insulin glulisine, your dosage may have to be adjusted by your 
doctor. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are 
able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high 
or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Method of administration 
Apidra is injected under the skin (subcutaneously). 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject Apidra. Apidra can be injected 
in the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or by continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. The 
effect will be slightly quicker if the insulin is injected into your abdomen. As for all insulins, injection 
sites and infusion sites within an-injection area (abdomen, thigh or upper arm) must be rotated from 
one injection to the next. 
Frequency of administration 
Apidra should be taken shortly (0-15 minutes) before or soon after meals. 
Instructions for proper use  
How to handle the cartridges 
Apidra in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to 
your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
To ensure you get the accurate dose, the Apidra cartridges are to be used only with the following pens: 
- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units  
- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar or AllStar PRO which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. 
Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. 
The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, 
attaching the needle, and administering the insulin injection. 
Before insertion of the cartridge into the reusable pen, the cartridge must be stored at room 
temperature for 1 to 2 hours. 
Look at the cartridge before you use it. Only use it if the solution is clear, colourless and has no visible 
particles in it. 
Do not shake or mix it before use. 
Special care before injection 
Air bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). 
Empty cartridges must not be refilled. 
To prevent any kind of contamination, the reusable pen should be used only by you. 
Problems with the insulin pen? 
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen. 
If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be 
discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. 
If you use more Apidra than you should 
- If you have injected too much Apidra, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must 
eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see 
box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Apidra 
- If you have missed a dose of Apidra or if you have not injected enough insulin, your blood sugar 
level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on 
the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Apidra 
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Apidra without 
speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups 
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Apidra and 
other insulins.

4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious side effects 
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) can be very serious. Hypoglycaemia is a very commonly 
reported side effect (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means 
that there is not enough sugar in the blood. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may 
become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If 
you have symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions to increase your blood sugar level immediately. 
See the box at the end of this leaflet for important further information about hypoglycaemia and its 
treatment. 
If you experience the following symptoms, contact your doctor immediately: 
Systemic allergic reactions are side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). 
Generalised allergy to insulin: Associated symptoms may include large-scale skin reactions (rash 
and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angioedema), shortness 
of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heartbeat and sweating. These could be symptoms of 
severe cases of generalised allergy to insulin, including anaphylactic reaction, which may be 
life-threatening. 
Hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) means that there is too much sugar in the blood. The 
frequency of hyperglycaemia cannot be estimated. If your blood sugar level is too high, this tells you 
that you may need more insulin than you have injected. This can be serious if your blood glucose level 
becomes very high. 
For more information on signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia refer to the box at the end of this 
leaflet. 
Other side effects 
•  Skin changes at the injection site:  
If you inject insulin too often at the same place, the fatty tissue may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or 
thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). Lumps under the skin may also be 
caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not 
known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site 
with each injection to help prevent these skin changes. 
Skin and allergic reactions at the injection site 
Common reported side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
• 
Reactions at the injection site may occur (such as reddening, unusually intense pain on injection, 
itching, hives, swelling or inflammation). They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor 
reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. 
Eye reactions 
Side effects where the frequency cannot be estimated from the available data 
• 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA 
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are a person with diabetes. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur? 
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Apidra"). 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia 
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia? 
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur? 
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and  
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT  
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Apidra"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: 
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia 
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in  
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions and loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
you are elderly,  
you have had diabetes for a long time,  
you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Apidra”). 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing 
can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia? 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.  
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following:  
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Apidra is and what it used for 
Apidra is an antidiabetic agent, used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus; it 
may be given to adults, adolescents and children, 6 years of age and older. Diabetes mellitus is a 
disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar. 
It is made by biotechnology. It has a rapid onset within 10-20 minutes and a short duration, about 4 
hours. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Apidra 
Do not use Apidra 
- 
- 
If you are allergic to insulin glulisine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), follow the guidance for hypoglycaemia (see 
box at the end of this leaflet). 
Warnings and precautions 
Apidra in a pre-filled pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin (see also section 3). Speak to 
your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Apidra. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood tests), diet and physical activity (physical 
work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidney problems, speak to your doctor as you may need a lower dose. 
There is insufficient clinical information on the use of Apidra in children younger than the age of 
6 years. 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Apidra). Contact your doctor 
if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your 
doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other 
antidiabetic medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
supplies of insulin, needles, etc, 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require extra care: 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).  
If you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you 
require insulin. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Other medicines and Apidra 
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: 
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
sulphonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: 
- 
- 
- 
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Apidra with alcohol 
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Careful control of your 
diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
There are no or limited data on the use of Apidra in pregnant women. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
-  
-  
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels).  
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). 
You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.

Important information about some of the ingredients of Apidra 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
Apidra contains metacresol 
Apidra contains metacresol, which may cause allergic reactions. 
3.  How to use Apidra 
Dose 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin 
usage, your doctor will determine how much Apidra you will need. 
Apidra is a short-acting insulin. Your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with an 
intermediate, long acting insulin, a basal insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels. 
If you switch from another insulin to insulin glulisine, your dosage may have to be adjusted by your 
doctor. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are 
able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high 
or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Method of administration 
Apidra is injected under the skin (subcutaneously). 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject Apidra. Apidra can be injected 
in the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or by continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. The 
effect will be slightly quicker if the insulin is injected into your abdomen. As for all insulins, injection 
sites and infusion sites within an-injection area (abdomen, thigh or upper arm) must be rotated from 
one injection to the next. 
Frequency of administration 
Apidra should be taken shortly (0-15 minutes) before or soon after meals. 
Instructions for proper use 
How to handle SoloStar 
SoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin glulisine. Apidra in a pre-filled pen is only 
suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by 
another method. 
Read carefully the "SoloStar Instructions for use" included in this package leaflet. You must use 
the pen as described in these Instructions for use. 
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Before use always attach a new needle, and perform a safety test. Only use needles that are compatible 
for use with SoloStar (see “SoloStar Instructions for use”). 
Look at the cartridge sealed in the disposable pen injector before you use it. Only use it if the solution 
is clear, colourless and has no visible particles in it. Do not shake or mix it before use. 
Always use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you 
think you may have a problem with SoloStar, please consult your Health Care Professional. 
If you use more Apidra than you should 
- If you have injected too much Apidra, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must 
eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see 
box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Apidra 
- If you have missed a dose of Apidra or if you have not injected enough insulin, your blood sugar 
level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on 
the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Apidra 
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Apidra without 
speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Insulin Mix-ups 
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Apidra and 
other insulins. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious side effects 
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) can be very serious. Hypoglycaemia is a very commonly 
reported side effect (may affect more than 1 on 10 people). Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means 
that there is not enough sugar in the blood. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may 
become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If 
you have symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions to increase your blood sugar level immediately. 
See the box at the end of this leaflet for important further information about hypoglycaemia and its 
treatment. 
If you experience the following symptoms, contact your doctor immediately: 
Systemic allergic reactions are side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). 
Generalised allergy to insulin: Associated symptoms may include large-scale skin reactions (rash 
and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angioedema), shortness 
of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heartbeat and sweating. These could be symptoms of 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
severe cases of generalised allergy to insulin, including anaphylactic reaction, which may be 
life-threatening. 
Hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) means that there is too much sugar in the blood. The 
frequency of hyperglycaemia cannot be estimated. If your blood sugar level is too high, this tells you 
that you may need more insulin than you have injected. This can be serious if your blood glucose level 
becomes very high. 
For more information on signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia refer to the box at the end of this 
leaflet. 
Skin changes at the injection site:  
Other side effects 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you notice any of the following side effects: 
• 
If you inject insulin too often at the same place, the fatty may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken 
(lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by 
build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not known). The 
insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each 
injection to help prevent these skin changes. 
Skin and allergic reactions at the injection site 
Common reported side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
• 
Reactions at the injection site may occur (such as reddening, unusually intense pain on injection, 
itching, hives, swelling or inflammation). They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor 
reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. 
Eye reactions 
Side effects where the frequency cannot be estimated from the available data 
• 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. 
5.  How to store Apidra 
Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA 
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are a person with diabetes. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur? 
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Apidra"). 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia 
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia? 
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur? 
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
 substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT  
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Apidra"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: 
- 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia 
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions and loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
you are elderly,  
you have had diabetes for a long time,  
you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Apidra”). 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing 
can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia? 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.  
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following:  
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Apidra SoloStar solution for injection in a pre-filled pen. INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
SoloStar is a pre-filled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is 
appropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. 
Read these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or 
follow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from 
a person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To 
ensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the 
dosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. 
You can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. 
Keep this leaflet for future reference. 
If you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or 
call the local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet.

Important information for use of SoloStar: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that are compatible for use with 
SoloStar. 
Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. 
Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). 
This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else. 
If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to 
avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. 
Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. 
Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged. 
Step 1. 
Check the insulin 
A. 
B. 
C. 
Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. The Apidra 
SoloStar is blue. It has a dark blue injection button with a raised ring on the top. 
Take off the pen cap. 
Check the appearance of your insulin. Apidra is a clear insulin. Do not use this SoloStar if the 
insulin is cloudy, coloured or has particles. 
69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 2.  
Attach the needle 
Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential 
needle blocks. 
A. 
B. 
Remove the protective seal from a new needle. 
Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, 
depending on the needle type). 
• 
If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause 
leakage, or break the needle. 
Step 3.  
Perform a safety test  
Always perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: 
• 
• 
ensuring that pen and needle work properly 
removing air bubbles 
A. Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. 
B. 
Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the 
inner needle cap and discard it. 
Keep 
Discard 
C.  Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. 
D.  Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. 
70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
E. 
Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. 
You may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. 
• 
• 
• 
If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to 
remove them. 
If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again.   
If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use 
this SoloStar. 
Step 4.  
Select the dose 
You can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you 
need a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. 
A. 
B. 
• 
• 
Check that the dose window shows “0” following the safety test. 
Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past 
your dose, you can turn back down. 
Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out. 
You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the 
dosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and 
complete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose. 
Step 5.  
Inject the dose 
A.  Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  
B. 
Insert the needle into the skin. 
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C.  Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way.  The number in the dose 
window will return to “0” as you inject. 
10 secs 
D.  Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the 
needle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. 
The pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the 
total of 300 units of insulin has been used. 
Step 6.  
Remove and discard the needle 
Always remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. 
This helps prevent: 
• 
• 
Contamination and/or infection, 
Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. 
A. 
Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To 
reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. 
•  If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, 
special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. 
Follow recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (contact your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and 
transmission of infectious diseases. 
B.  Dispose of the needle safely, as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
C.  Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection. 
Storage instructions  
Please check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar. 
If your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up to 
room temperature. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. 
Discard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities. 
72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Maintenance 
Protect your SoloStar from dust and dirt. 
You can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth. 
Do not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. 
Your SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid 
situations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be 
damaged, use a new one.

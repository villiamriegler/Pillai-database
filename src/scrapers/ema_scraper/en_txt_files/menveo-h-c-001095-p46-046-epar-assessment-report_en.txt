1.  Introduction 
On the 28th of March 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Menveo, in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
During the procedure the MAH informed the EMA that the study report for study V72_72 was 
republished due to modifications to the MenACWY hSBA LOQ values.  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
Menveo (MenACWY vaccine) is indicated for active immunization of children (from 2 years of age), 
adolescents and adults at risk of exposure to Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y, to 
prevent invasive disease. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official 
recommendations.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study MENB REC 2ND GEN-038 (V72_72) is a standalone study. 
Study MENB REC 2ND GEN-038 (V72_72) has not been conducted as part of an agreed paediatric 
investigation plan (PIP). In this study, submitted as part of this procedure, Menveo, further referred to 
as MenACWY, was used:  
- 
- 
as a negative control to assess test-based vaccine effectiveness of MenB-containing vaccines  
as a comparator for demonstrating non-inferiority of a 2-dose series of the investigational vaccine, 
MenABCWY, versus a single dose of MenACWY, in terms of immune response to meningococcal 
serogroups A, C, W and Y.  
- 
to confirm that reactogenicity and safety to healthy subjects have been assessed, as per 
vaccination schedule. 
For the current procedure, only results related to Menveo (MenACWY) will be assessed and discussed.  
During the current procedure, the MAH republished the clinical study report due to a change to the 
limits of quantitation (LOQs) of the Men A, C, W and Y agar-overlay hSBA. The assessment presented 
in this report will take into consideration version 02 of the CSR.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Menveo consists of powder and solution for injection. Menveo is a quadrivalent meningococcal 
serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y oligosaccharide vaccine, conjugated to Corynebacterium diphtheriae 
CRM197 carrier protein. Menveo should be injected intramuscularly as a single dose (0.5 mL) into the 
deltoid area.  
Menveo is commercially available. According to the protocol, the commercial vaccines are assumed to 
comply with the specifications given in the manufacturer’s Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

MENB REC 2ND GEN-038 (V72_72) study: A phase III, randomized, controlled, observer-blind 
study to demonstrate effectiveness, immunogenicity and safety of GSK's meningococcal Group B and 
combined ABCWY vaccines when administered to healthy adolescents and young adults. Menveo was 
used as one of the active comparator vaccines in the study.  
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
MENB REC 2ND GEN-038 (V72_72) 
Description 
The primary purpose of the MENB REC 2ND GEN-038 (V72_72) study was to evaluate the vaccine 
effectiveness of the Meningococcal Group B (Bexsero) and the combined Meningococcal Serogroups A, 
B, C, W, and Y (MenABCWY) vaccine by measuring the bactericidal serum activity against a large panel 
of epidemiologically relevant invasive disease strains of Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis) 
serogroup B using an endogenous complement human serum bactericidal assay (enc-hSBA). This was 
evaluated when Meningococcal Group B vaccine was administered in a 3-dose (0,2,6-months) or a 2-
dose (0,6-months; 0,2-months) schedule and when the combined MenABCWY vaccine was 
administered in a 2-dose (0,6-months) schedule (Figure 1). In addition, safety of the vaccines 
administered as per the vaccination schedule to healthy subjects were also assessed.

Assessor’s comment 
Healthy subjects between 10-25 years of age received either MenACWY (Menveo), rMenB+OMV NZ 
(Bexsero), MenABCWY (combination vaccine based on Menveo and Bexsero) or placebo at visit 1, 3, 5 
and 6 (day 1, 61, 181 and 211). Only results on MenACWY will be assessed. Participants in the ACWY-
group, MenB_0_2_6 and MenB_0_6 received a single dose of MenACWY at visit 1, 6 and 3, 
respectively.  
EMA/8739/2024

Data from the ACWY group will be discussed for immunogenicity since the immune response to MenA, 
C, W and Y one month after the Menveo vaccination was only assessed in this study group and not in 
the others receiving MenACWY. Data from the MenB_0_6 group and the ACWY group will be discussed 
for safety. It is regretted that solicited AEs were not collected after vaccination 4 (Day 211). As a 
result, only limited safety data is collected for the Menveo dose administered to the MenB_0_2_6 
group.  
The design of the study will be described below, however, no assessment of the adequacy of the trial 
design is provided as the trial was not designed to assess Menveo. The assessment performed for the 
current procedure focusses on deriving useful information on Menveo that might impact the SmPC 
and/or RMP.  
Methods 
Study participants 
Healthy males and females between 10 and 25 years of age at the time of the first vaccination were 
included. Subjects who were either unvaccinated with MenACWY vaccine or have received a single 
previous dose of MenACWY vaccine could participate in the study, if they have received the vaccination 
at least 4 years prior to informed consent and assent as applicable (with the exception of 
meningococcal C vaccination, if the last dose of MenC was received at ≤24 months of age). 
Exclusion criteria included current or previous, confirmed or suspected disease caused by N. 
meningitidis, contact with and/or intimate exposure to an individual with confirmed N. meningitidis 
infection within 60 days of enrolment, previous MenB vaccination, history of hypersensitivity to 
components of the vaccine, a known or suspected disorder of the immune system, neuroinflammatory 
or neurological conditions, pregnancy. 
Assessor’s comments 
MenACWY is indicated for children (from 2 years of age), adolescents and adults. MenACWY can also 
be administered as a booster dose. In this study, healthy subjects of 10-25 of age were included. Not 
all subjects were naïve for MenACWY. This is consistent with the current use according to the SmPC. 
Subjects could participate in the study, if they have received a previous MenACWY vaccination at least 
4 years prior to informed consent. It is unclear why this timeframe of 4 years was chosen as a 
considerable percentage of subjects has a persistent immune response 5 years after vaccination with 
Menveo (as stated in the SmPC). This indicates that these participants might have a higher baseline 
hSBA titer and the vaccine will most likely act as a booster dose. The MAH was requested to elaborate 
on this. The MAH indicated that participants with a previous history of MenACWY vaccination were 
included to ensure adequate representation of US adolescents and young adults that have been 
vaccinated according to ACIP recommendations. The timeframe of at least 4 years between primary 
and booster vaccination reflects the US prescribing information. Of the population enrolled in the 
MenACWY group, only 13% (22 out of 177) has received MenACWY vaccination at least 4 years 
previous. The results in participants without previous vaccination with MenACWY are included in the 
report. As expected, the results in the group without the previous ACWY vaccination are slightly 
reduced compared to the total population, however, they do not substantially alter the conclusions of 
the report with regard to MenACWY vaccination. 
A similar question remains for the meningococcal C vaccination. The MAH stated that participants were 
eligible in case MenC vaccine was received at ≤ 24 months of age. It can be agreed that MenC 
vaccination has been and still is standard of care in multiple countries. This might in part explain the

# MenABCWY formulation consisting of MenACWY lyo (lyophilised component) and of MenB liquid component, to be 
reconstituted together before administration (0.5 mL) by a qualified healthcare professional. Both the manufacture 
and the final composition of the MenB component of the MenABCWY are identical to that of the commercial Bexsero. 
However, to ensure a consistent reconstitution procedure and to reduce the risk of under-dosing the MenB 
component, the filling weight has been increased from a nominal 0.609 g presents in commercial Bexsero to 0.640g 
in the MenB component, used to reconstitute MenABCWY.  
** The volume of the saline pre-filled syringe may be between 0.6ml and 0.8 mL. The full volume is to be injected. 
All injections were administered intramuscularly as a single dose into the deltoid area of the non-
dominant arm.  
Assessor’s comments 
MenACWY is administered as a single dose of 0.5 mL. Composition and vaccination regimen used in the 
study is similar to composition and posology described in the SmPC for Menveo.

The volume to be administered for vaccines is 0.5 mL whereas the volume to be administered for 
placebo is 0.65 mL. It is not understood why different volumes were chosen. However, considering that 
the unblinded personnel responsible for preparing and/or delivering injections were not involved in the 
analysis, this issue was not further pursued.  
Objective(s)  
Assessor’s comments 
Note that only objectives and endpoints relevant for evaluating the response to MenACWY are listed. 
Primary objective: 
- 
To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of the MenACWY vaccine. 
Secondary objective:  
- 
To assess the immune response to MenACWY (single dose) vaccine against N. meningitidis 
serogroups A, C, W and Y, at pre-vaccination (Day 1, Month 0) and 1 month after the MenACWY 
vaccination.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary safety endpoints 
- 
The frequencies and percentages of subjects with solicited local (i.e., injection site pain, erythema, 
swelling, induration) and systemic (i.e., fever [body temperature ≥ 38.0°C], nausea, fatigue, 
myalgia, arthralgia, headache) adverse events (AEs) during the 7 days (including the day of 
vaccination) following each vaccination at Day 1, Day 61 and Day 181. 
- 
The frequencies and percentages of subjects with any unsolicited AEs (including all SAEs, AEs 
leading to withdrawal, AESIs and medically attended AEs) during the 30 days (including the day of 
vaccination) following each vaccination at Day 1, Day 61 and Day 181. 
- 
The percentages of subjects with SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, AESIs and medically attended 
AEs throughout the study period (Month 0 to Month 12). 
Secondary immunogenicity endpoints 
- 
- 
The percentage of subjects with hSBA titres ≥ LLOQ for serogroups A, C, W and Y at baseline (Day 
1, Month 0) and at 1 month after the MenACWY vaccination in the ACWY group (Day 31, Month 1). 
The percentage of subjects with 4-fold rise in hSBA titres at 1 month after the MenACWY 
vaccination in the ACWY group (Day 31, Month 1) relative to baseline (Day 1, Month 0). 
-  hSBA GMTs against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y at baseline (Day 1, Month 0) and at 
1 month after the MenACWY vaccination in the ACWY group (Day 31, Month 1). 
-  hSBA GMRs against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y at 1 month after the single 
MenACWY vaccination in the ACWY group (Day 31, Month 1) as compared to baseline (Day 1, 
Month 0). 
- 
The total IgG as measured by ELISA GMCs against serogroups A, C, W and Y at baseline (Day 1, 
Month 0) and at 1 month after the MenACWY vaccination in the ACWY group (Day 31, Month 1).

Assessor’s comments 
Safety endpoints taken along in the study are in line with the Guideline on clinical evaluation of 
vaccines. Local and systemic solicited adverse events are well chosen, based on the SmPC.  
The immune response following MenACWY vaccination was determined as the percentage of subjects 
with hSBA titres ≥ LLOQ, percentage of subjects with a 4-fold rise in hSBA titres, hSBA GMTs and 
hSBA GMRs and total IgG at one month after vaccination. This is considered acceptable. An hSBA titre 
of 1:4 is considered a surrogate of protection. As all LLOQs for the assays fall above 1:4, this is 
considered a conservative measure and will highlight potential protection. 
Sample size 
Approximately 3651 healthy adolescents and young adults aged 10-25 years were planned to be 
enrolled into the study. Of the planned subjects, a subset was planned to receive MenACWY: 
-  MenB_0_2_6 group: Approximately 912 subjects were planned to receive MenACWY vaccine at 
visit day 211 (month 6);  
-  MenB_0_6 group: Approximately 912 subjects were planned to receive MenACWY vaccine at visit 
day 61 (month 2);  
-  MenACWY group: Approximately 183 subjects were planned to receive MenACWY vaccine at visit 
day 1 (month 0). 
Assessor’s comments 
The study was not powered to study MenACWY as MenACWY was used only as an active comparator 
vaccine in the study. The numbers are adequate to determine immunogenicity and the reactogenicity 
profile. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Allocation of the subject to a study group/a treatment number at the investigator site was performed 
using a randomisation system on internet (SBIR). The randomisation algorithm used a minimisation 
procedure accounting for study, region (US and ex-US countries), previous MenACWY vaccination 
(Yes/No), and age category (10-17 years of age and 18-25 years of age). Minimisation factors had 
equal weight in the minimisation algorithm. 
Data was collected in an observer-blind manner; the participants and those responsible for the 
evaluation of any study endpoint (e.g. safety, reactogenicity, and effectiveness) will all be unaware of 
which vaccine/product was administered. A minimum number of study site personnel responsible for 
preparing and / or delivering the injections were to be unblinded. 
Assessor’s comments 
The randomisation procedure is based on a minimisation procedure accounting for the factors study, 
region (US and ex-US countries), previous MenACWY vaccination (Yes/No), and age category (10-17 
years of age and 18-25 years of age). It is unclear why minimisation was applied for this sizable trial 
as this procedure is mainly applied in case stratification is not possible due to many prognostic factors 
for small trials (Guideline on adjustment for baseline covariates in clinical trials). Minimisation does not 
guarantee balance within combinations of prognostic factors. However, as adequacy of trial design was 
not the focus of this procedure, this issue is not further pursued.

Statistical Methods 
Analysis sets 
Enrolled Set = Subject/ Subject for whom parent(s)/LAR’s agreed to participate in a clinical study after 
completion of the informed consent process, who meet screening/eligibility criteria and randomized 
and/or received study intervention or undergone an invasive procedure. 
Exposed Set = All subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study treatment. The allocation in a 
group is done in function of all administered treatments. 
Full Analysis Set = All subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study treatment and have post-
vaccination effectiveness or immunogenicity data. 
Per Protocol Set = All subjects in the Full Analysis Set minus subjects with protocol deviations that lead 
to exclusion from the Per Protocol Set. 
Solicited Safety Set = All subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study treatment (Exposed Set) 
who have solicited safety data beyond 30 minutes post vaccination. 
Unsolicited Safety Set = All subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study treatment (Exposed Set) 
that report unsolicited AEs/report not having unsolicited AEs.  
Analysis of primary safety endpoints: 
Analyses were conducted on the Solicited Safety Set (solicited local and systemic AEs and other 
solicited AEs), Unsolicited Safety Set (unsolicited AEs), and Overall Safety Set. The safety analyses 
were descriptive.  
Analysis of secondary immunogenicity endpoints: 
Immunogenicity of the MenACWY vaccine against serogroups A, C, W and Y was evaluated by serum 
bactericidal assays using exogenous source of human complement (hSBAs), using indicator strains 
representing serogroups A, C, W and Y. To this end, whole blood was drawn from the MenACWY group 
at pre-vaccination (Visit 1, month 0) and Visit 2 (month 1) for the bactericidal assays (enc-hSBA and/ 
or hSBA(s) and ELISA (or equivalent). 
The hSBA titres at both time points were logarithmically transformed (base10) to fulfil the normal 
distribution assumption. For each N. meningitidis serogroup A, C, W and Y, the GMTs and GMRs 
(postvaccination/baseline) were obtained from an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with factors for 
vaccine group, region (US/ex-US), age category (10-17 YoA/18-25 YoA), and previous MenACWY 
vaccination (y/n), and then exponentiating the log-transformed means and their 95% CIs.  
An Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was used to evaluate the serotype-specific IgG 
responses to A, C, W, and Y at baseline and month 1. The total IgG were analysed in a comparable 
way as described above for hSBA titres. Since total IgG is measured as concentration instead of titer, 
the resulting geometric mean of the concentrations is abbreviated as GMC. 
To assess the percentage of subjects with 4-fold rise in hSBA titres, the 4-fold rise is defined as: 
- 
- 
- 
a post-vaccination hSBA titre ≥4 times the LOD or ≥LLOQ, whichever is greater, for subjects with a 
pre-vaccination hSBA titre <LOD 
a post-vaccination hSBA titre ≥4 times the LLOQ for subjects with a pre-vaccination hSBA titre 
≥LOD but <LLOQ, and 
a post-vaccination hSBA titre ≥4 times the pre-vaccination titre for subjects with a pre-vaccination 
hSBA titre ≥LLOQ. 
EMA/8739/2024  
Page 9/26 
 
  
 
 
For each N. meningitidis A, C, W and Y and for each (individual response) the percentages of subjects 
with hSBA titres ≥LLOQ and of subjects with 4- fold rise and the corresponding exact 2-sided 95% CIs 
based on Clopper-Pearson method were calculated.  
Analyses were based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS).  
Assessor’s comments 
In previous studies, efficacy of Menveo has been inferred by measuring the generation of serogroup-
specific anti-capsular antibodies with bactericidal activity. Serum bactericidal activity (SBA) was 
measured using human serum as the source of exogenous complement (hSBA). The hSBA 1:4 is 
considered a surrogate of protection. As LLOQ is often higher than 1:4, as is the case in this study, this 
is considered a conservative surrogate.  
For determining the 4-fold rise in hSBA titers, note that different cut offs (LLOQ) were used as 
compared to previous assays employed in the clinical development of Menveo. The MAH confirmed that 
a different quantitative hSBA assay, the MenACWY agar-overlay hSBA assay, was used compared to 
the assay used during the initial application, the manual (tilt) hSBA assay.    
Direct comparisons of immune responses between the present study and older studies should be 
avoided or at least interpreted with caution.  
During the course of the current procedure the MAH republished the clinical study report due to a 
change to the limits of quantitation for the MenA, C, W and Y agar-overlay hSBA. Based on the 
validation of the agar-overlay hSBA in 2020 using LSOP 9000064782 version 02, dilution linearity led 
to other LLOQ values for Men A, C, W and Y. Based on the validation of dilutional linearity for version 
07, the LLOQ increased. As the LLOQ of the assay increased and remained well above the correlate of 
protection (CoP), no clinical impact is expected based on changes in the LLOQs. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 3657 subjects were enrolled (Figure 2), and 3638 subjects were randomized and received at 
least 1 dose of study vaccination.

In the ACWY group 163/178 completed the study, 15 withdrawn from the study due to consent 
withdrawal not due to an (S)AE (n=7), lost to follow-up (n=4), an adverse event requiring expedited 
reporting (n=1), protocol deviation (n=1), migrated/moved away from study area (n=1) or another 
reason (n=1).  
In the MenB_0_6 group, where also the safety effects of MenACWY administration is evaluated, 
811/906 completed the study, 95 where withdrawn from the study due to consent withdrawal not due 
to an (S)AE (n=38), lost to follow-up (n=36), protocol deviation (n=8), migrated/moved away from 
study area (n=7), an adverse event requiring expedited reporting (n=2), an unsolicited non-serious 
adverse event (n=2) or a solicited adverse event (n=2).  
Overall, 478 out of 3638 (13.1%) subjects in the Exposed Set had received a previous MenACWY 
vaccination. Of which n=22 in the ACWY group (8 subjects of 10-17 years of age and 14 subjects of 
18-25 years of age) and n=119 in the MenB_0_6 group (68 subjects of 10-17 years of age and 51 
subjects of 18-25 years of age). 
Assessor’s comments 
In the participant flow 177 subjects were randomised into the MenACWY group. Whereas 178 subjects 
were in the (un)solicited safety set. It was unclear where this extra subject came from. The MAH 
stated that the additional subject in the unsolicited safety set was due to one participant who was 
randomised to the MenB_0_6 group, but received MenACWY vaccine as a first dose. This subject was 
included and analysed in the safety analyses of the MenACWY group.  
In the MenACWY group and the MenB_0_6 group, approximately 10% of participants withdrew during 
the study. The main reason was consent withdrawal not due to an (S)AE. This is not unexpected in the 
population studied. 
There were 22 subjects in the ACWY group and 119 subjects in the MenB_0_6 group that had received 
a previous MenACWY vaccination. Thus, majority was naïve for MenACWY.

Recruitment 
This study was conducted at 114 centers in 7 countries: 7 in Australia, 12 in Canada, 12 in Czechia, 3 
in Estonia, 10 in Finland, 5 in Turkey and 65 in United States (US).  
Baseline data 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics were generally balanced in the study groups (Table 3). 
The mean age of subjects who participated in this study was 16.5 (SD, 4.7) years across groups. There 
was a slightly higher percentage of 10–17-year-olds (59.3%) than 18–25-year-olds (40.6%). Overall, 
53.5% of participants in the study were females. A total of 89% of subjects were of White heritage and 
the majority (93.7%) identified as Not Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Thirty percent of the enrolled 
subjects were from US and the rest of the subjects were from Australia, Canada, Czechia, Estonia, 
Finland and Turkey. Overall, 478 out of 3638 (13.1%) subjects in the Exposed Set had received a 
previous MenACWY vaccination (of which n=22 in the ACWY group and n=119 in the MenB_0_6 
group).

Assessor’s comments 
The majority of subjects in the ACWY group and MenB_0_6 were adolescents between 10-17 years of 
age (57.6% and 59.7% respectively). 
Baseline characteristics were balanced between the ACWY and MenB_0_6 group. 
Number analysed 
A total of 3333 (91.6 % of the enrolled subjects) subjects were included in the full analysis set (FAS), 
from which a total of 2994 (89.8%) subjects were included in the per protocol set (PPS). The most 
common reasons for elimination from PPS were out of window treatment administration (3.5%, 
overall) and out of window assessment for immunogenicity (3.0%, overall). 
A total of 370 subjects (10.2%) withdrew prematurely from the study. The most common reasons for 
premature withdrawal throughout the study were withdrawal of consent, not due to an (S)AE (4%, 
overall) and lost to follow-up (3.9%, overall).  
For the two groups receiving Menveo that were analysed for efficacy and safety in this procedure; in 
total 95 (10.5%) and 15 (8.4%) subjects of the MenB_0_6 group and ACWY group respectively, 
withdrew prematurely from the study. This was most commonly due to withdrawal of consent, not due 
to an (S)AE (4.2% in the MenB_0_6 group and 3.9% in the ACWY group) and lost to follow-up (4.0% 
in the MenB_0_6 group and 2.2% in the ACWY group). 
Efficacy results 
Assessor’s comments 
As indicated, only results directly relevant for evaluating the response to MenACWY are assessed. For 
efficacy only the first vaccination of the ACWY group is taken along in the assessment.  
Percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ LLOQ  
At baseline, the percentages of subjects with hSBA titres ≥ LLOQ against N. meningitidis serogroups 
were: 11.7% for A, 25.9% for C, 12.9% for W, and 13.5% for Y. At 1 month after a single dose of 
MenACWY vaccine, there was an increase in the percentage of subjects with hSBA titres ≥ LLOQ 
(ranging from 63.5% to 90.2% across serogroups; Table 4).

Percentage of subjects achieving a 4-fold rise in hSBA titers 
At 1 month after the single MenACWY dose, the percentages of subjects with at least a 4-fold rise in 
hSBA titers against N. meningitidis serogroups were: A (85.3%), C (56.7%), W (66.2%), and Y

Assessor’s comments 
The percentage of subjects with hSBA titres greater or equal to LLOQ against serogroups A, C, W and Y 
were 11.7%, 28.8%, 12.9% and 13.5%, respectively at baseline. The percentages increased at 1 
month after the single dose of MenACWY to 90.2%, 64.0%, 69.3% and 80.0%, respectively. The 
percentages of subjects with at least a 4-fold rise in hSBA titers against N. meningitidis serogroups 
were: A (86.0%), C (56.7%), W (66.2%), and Y (72.1%). The hSBA GMTs against serogroups A, C, W 
and Y were low, and increased following the vaccination. The same was observed for total IgG.  
Based on version 02 of the CSR only minor changes to the results compared to version 01 of the CSR 
were noted. The changes did not impact the conclusions of the study with regard to MenACWY 
vaccination as presented. It is noteworthy that even though the LLOQ for the MenA hSBA increased, 
the number of participants with a 4-fold rise increased for subjects with a pre-vaccination titer ≥LLOQ. 
This is not considered possible, however, as it only pertains to 1 participant this is not further pursued 
as it will not change the outcome or the results of this study. Finally, it was not fully understood why 
there were any changes in GMT or GMR for MenY as no change in LLOQ was reported. However, the 
EMA/8739/2024  
Page 14/26 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
changes were so minor that this is not further pursued. The MAH is strongly encouraged to ensure 
correct data presentation in case this study will be used in future submissions. 
In the SmPC, the percentage of subjects (11-18 years of age) with hSBA ≥ 1:8 is 75%, 85%, 96% and 
88% for serogroup A, C, W and Y respectively. For adults, the percentage of subjects (19-55 years of 
age) with hSBA ≥ 1:8 is 69%, 80%, 94% and 79% for serogroup A, C, W and Y respectively. Although 
direct comparison between this study and previous studies is difficult, the MAH was requested to 
discuss the rather low percentage of subjects with a 4-fold rise in hSBA levels for serogroup C and W 
one month after vaccination. In addition, GMT levels one month after MenACWY vaccination observed 
in this study are considerably higher (194.3-474.8) when compared to GMTs listed in the SmPC. It is 
acknowledged that a direct comparison of GMTs data across studies conducted in different populations 
and time periods should be performed with caution. The MAH indicated that these differences can be 
attributed to the characteristics of the serology assay used, including different LLOQ and definition 
used to calculate the 4-fold rise and the use of a different imputation method for calculating the GMTs.  
Safety results 
Assessor’s comments 
Note that only (un)solicited AEs following a MenAWCY vaccination in the MenB_0_6 and ACWY group 
(administered at day 61 and day 1, respectively) were presented by the Applicant in the body text of 
the report. Only limited safety data was collected after vaccination 4 (Day 211) in the MenB_0_2_6 
group that received a MenACWY vaccination at Visit 6, Day 211 (see above). 
A total of 3619 (99.5%) and 3618 (99.5%) subjects were included in the Exposed Set for the 
Unsolicited Safety Set and Solicited Safety Set, respectively. No safety follow-up was the reason for 
the elimination of a few subjects from both these sets. 
In the ACWY group, 177 subjects received a MenACWY vaccination at Visit 1, month 0. In the 
MenB_0_6 group, 906 subjects received a Men B (Bexsero) vaccination at Visit 1, month 0 followed by 
a MenACWY vaccination (n=854) at Visit 3, month 2. One participant in the MenB_0_6 group received 
MenACWY vaccination at Visit 1 and was included and analysed in the safety analyses in the MenACWY 
group. 
Solicited AEs  
After MenACWY vaccination 
• 
• 
• 
In the 7 days following the MenACWY vaccination, at least one solicited AE was reported in 53.6% 
of subjects in the MenB_0_6 group and in 70.8% of subjects in the ACWY group (Table 7)  
In 28.9% of subjects in the MenB_0_6 group and 41.0% of subjects in the ACWY group had at 
least one local AE (injection site pain, erythema, swelling, induration) and 41.9% and 59.6% of 
subjects in respective groups had at least one systemic AE (fever, nausea, fatigue, myalgia, 
arthralgia, headache). 
The most frequently reported solicited local AE was pain (27.6% in the MenB_0_6 group and 
37.6% in the ACWY group) in both the groups followed by erythema (3.2% and 6.2%).  
•  Most of the observed solicited local AEs after the MenACWY vaccination were mild to moderate in 
severity in both groups. None of the subjects in the ACWY group experienced severe pain and 
0.6% (n=5) reported severe pain in the MenB_0_6 group, and other severe solicited local AEs 
reported by less than or equal to 1.1% of subjects in both the MenACWY group and MenB_0_6 
group. 
EMA/8739/2024

• 
The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs were fatigue (28.0% and 43.8%) and 
headache (27.4% and 38.8%) in the MenB_0_6 and ACWY group, respectively.  
•  Most of the solicited systemic AEs were mild in severity in both groups. Less than or equal to 2.2% 
of subjects had severe systemic AEs across the 2 groups. After the MenACWY vaccination, 12 
(1.5%) subjects in the MenB_0_6 group and 3 (1.7%) subjects in the ACWY group had fever 
(temperature ≥ 38°C).

Unsolicited AEs 
• 
• 
In the ACWY group, 29 (16.3%) subjects reported at least one unsolicited AE within the 30 days 
following the MenACWY vaccination. The most commonly reported unsolicited AEs were classified 
under the MedDRA SOC of Infections and infestations (3.9%), Gastrointestinal disorders (3.4%), 
General disorders and administration site conditions (1.7%). 
In the MenB_0_6 group, 88 (10.3%) subjects reported at least one unsolicited AE within in the 30 
days following the MenACWY vaccination. The most commonly reported unsolicited AEs were 
classified under the MedDRA SOC of Infections and infestations (3.5%), Injury, poisoning and 
procedural complications (1.9%), Gastrointestinal disorders (1.4%).  
•  Unsolicited AEs assessed as causally related to vaccination by the investigator were reported by 
6.2% and 5.6% of subjects in MenB_0_6 and ACWY groups, respectively. The causally related AEs 
were more frequently reported under the SOC “General disorders and administration site 
conditions”, reported by 3% to 3.4% of subjects in MenB_0_6 and ACWY groups, respectively. The 
most commonly reported causally related unsolicited AE, by PT, was injection site pain (8 subjects) 
in the MenB_0_6 group and injection site induration in the ACWY group (2 subjects).  
•  Most of the unsolicited AEs were mild to moderate in intensity, and most of them resolved before 
study termination. 
SAE and deaths reported during entire study period 
•  During the course of the study, 22 (2.4%) subjects in the MenB_0_6 and 5 (2.8%) subjects in the 
ACWY group reported at least one SAE. Of which, 2 in the MenB_0_6 group were assessed as 
possibly related. Nausea, vomiting, pyrexia, headache were reported in 1 subject within 12 hours 
after MenACWY vaccination in MenB_0_6 group. These events were resolved in 2 days. The other 
SAE in this group was Colitis ulcerative and was reported 44 days after vaccination 3 (rMenB+OMV 
NZ vaccine). This event was still ongoing at the end of the study.  
• 
There was 1 reported AESI in the MenB_0_6 group. The aforementioned SAE, Colitis ulcerative, 
reported after vaccination 3 (rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine) was also identified as an AESI.  
EMA/8739/2024

• 
There was 1 fatal unsolicited event (overdose) in the MenB_0_6 group and was considered not 
related to the administered study vaccinations.  
Discontinuations 
• 
There were 4 subjects in the MenB_0_6 and 1 subject in the ACWY group that reported unsolicited 
events leading to premature withdrawal from the study. Two of the non-serious unsolicited AEs 
that led to withdrawal in the MenB_0_6 group were assessed as causally related to vaccination by 
the investigator; one subject reported arthritis and one subject reported pyrexia and injection site 
hematoma. Arthritis was reported 11 days after Bexsero vaccination (rMenB+OMV NZ). Two 
subjects in the MenB_0_6 and one subject in the ACWY group experienced at least one SAE that 
led to withdrawal from the study: two subjects in MenB_0_6 group (overdose, major depression 
and suicide attempt) and one subject in ACWY group (testis cancer). Overdose was fatal (below). 
None of the SAEs that led to withdrawal from study were assessed as causally related to 
vaccination. 
Assessor’s comments 
The most frequently reported solicited local AE was pain followed by erythema. The most frequently 
reported solicited systemic AE were fatigue and headache. This is in line with the SmPC.  
Unsolicited AEs assessed as causally related to vaccination by the investigator were reported by 6.2% 
and 5.6% of subjects in MenB_0_6 and ACWY groups, respectively. The majority of related unsolicited 
AEs could be considered reactogenicity events or were events already listed as ADRs in the SmPC. Two 
AEs, one report of ‘Pain in extremity’ of a subject in the MenB_0_6 group and one report of ‘Back pain’ 
in the ACWY group, referred to events not already included in the SmPC. As these are single cases, no 
strong conclusions on relatedness can be drawn. In addition, for pain in extremity there is overlap with 
injection site pain. Therefore, these AEs were not considered new safety signals. Unsolicited events 
assessed as related to the vaccine were also registered in the MenB_0_2_6 group after MenACWY 
vaccination (vaccination 4). No new safety events were observed in this group.   
In  total,  approximately  2.5%  of  subjects  in  the  MenB_0_6  group  and  the  ACWY  group,  22  and  5 
respectively, reported at least one SAE. Of which one participant reported SAEs which were considered 
possibly related to MenACWY vaccination by the investigator.  
One subject in the MenB_0_6 group reported nausea, vomiting, pyrexia and headache within 12 hours 
after MenACWY vaccination. These SAEs led to hospitalisation. They were resolved in two days. These 
PTs are already listed as ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC and are therefore not considered new safety 
signals.  
There was 1 fatal event (overdose). It is agreed that this was considered not related to vaccination.  
In general, currently no new major safety signals were reported.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MENB REC 2ND GEN-038 (V72_72) study was conducted as part of the development program of 
the investigational meningococcal combination vaccine MenABCWY, intended to protect against the five 
most common Neisseria meningitidis serogroups (A, B, C, W and Y). Menveo was used as a comparator 
vaccine in the study. For this procedure, the immune response to- and safety and reactogenicity of the 
MenACWY vaccine were assessed. 
EMA/8739/2024  
Page 17/26 
 
  
 
 
 
Immunogenicity of the MenACWY vaccine against serogroups A, B, C, W and Y was evaluated by serum 
bactericidal assays using exogenous source of human complement (hSBAs), using indicator strains 
representing serogroups A, C, W and Y. The percentage of subjects with hSBA titres greater or equal to 
LLOQ against serogroups A, C, W and Y were low respectively at baseline. The percentages increased 
at 1 month after the single dose of MenACWY to 90.2%, 64.0%, 69.3% and 80.0%, respectively. The 
percentages of subjects with at least a 4-fold rise in hSBA titers against N. Meningitidis serogroups 
were: A (86.0%), C (56.7%), W (66.2%), and Y (72.1%). The hSBA GMTs against serogroups A, C, W 
and Y were low, and increased following the vaccination. The same was observed for total IgG. 
Indicating an immune response as could be expected.  
During the current study no new safety signals were reported. The most frequently reported solicited 
local AE was pain followed by erythema. The most frequently reported solicited systemic AE were 
fatigue and headache, which is in line with the SmPC. Unsolicited events were reported by 10.3% and 
16.3% of subjects receiving a MenACWY vaccination, most of which were mild to moderate in intensity.  
Approximately 2.5% of subjects reported at least one SAE. One subject reported SAEs (nausea, 
vomiting, pyrexia, headache) 12 hours after the MenACWY vaccination, which were assessed as related 
to the study vaccination. The subject discontinued due to these SAEs. However, as these AEs are 
already included in the SmPC, this is not considered a new safety signal. There was one fatal event 
unrelated to the study vaccination.  
The MAH considers no changes to the current SmPC of MenACWY are necessary. This can be agreed.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
In conclusion, in the current study a single MenACWY vaccination generated an immune response as 
expected.  No new safety signals were observed. 
It can be agreed that an update of the SmPC based on the current study is not required. 
  Fulfilled 
No regulatory action required. 
4.  Request for supplementary information 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
Study design: 
1.  Subjects could participate in the study, if they have received a previous MenACWY vaccination at 
least 4 years prior to informed consent. It is unclear why this timeframe of 4 years was chosen as 
a considerable percentage of subjects has a persistent immune response 5 years after vaccination 
with Menveo (as stated in the SmPC). This indicates that these participants might have a higher 
baseline hSBA titer and the vaccine will most likely act as a booster dose. The MAH is requested to 
explain this. 
EMA/8739/2024  
Page 18/26 
 
  
 
 
  
 
2.  Subjects were exempted from study participation when they had received a meningococcal C 
vaccination of which the last dose was received at ≤24 months of age. The MAH is requested to 
explain this. 
3.  For determining the 4-fold rise in hSBA titers, different cut offs (LLOQ) were used as compared to 
previous assays employed in the clinical development of Menveo. The MAH is requested to indicate 
whether different assays were used in this study compared to the studies submitted during Menveo 
approval and to provide comparisons between the assay if available. 
4.  A total of 177 subjects were randomized into the MenACWY group, whereas 178 subjects were in 
the (un)solicited safety set. It is unclear where this extra subject came from. The MAH is requested 
to explain this. 
Efficacy: 
5.  The MAH is requested to discuss the rather low percentage of subjects with a 4-fold rise in hSBA 
levels for serogroup C and W one month after MenACWY vaccination.  
6.  GMT levels one month after MenACWY vaccination observed in this study are considerably higher 
(194.3-458.7) when compared to GMTs listed in the SmPC. The MAH is requested to also elaborate 
on this discrepancy. 
Safety: 
7.  Narratives for all SAEs were not provided, which hampers any assessment of relatedness to 
MenACWY vaccination. The MAH is asked to present all narratives of SAEs occurring in groups 
receiving a MenACWY vaccination; the MenB_0_2_6, MenB_0_6 group and the ACWY group.  
8.  A higher percentage of subjects reported a local or systemic solicited event in the ACWY group 
when compared to the MenB_0_6 group. The MAH is requested to discuss this difference. 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop. 
MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Question 1 
Subjects could participate in the study, if they have received a previous MenACWY vaccination at least 
4 years prior to informed consent. It is unclear why this timeframe of 4 years was chosen as a 
considerable percentage of subjects has a persistent immune response 5 years after vaccination with 
Menveo (as stated in the SmPC). This indicates that these participants might have a higher baseline 
hSBA titer and the vaccine will most likely act as a booster dose. The MAH is requested to explain this. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Study MENB REC 2ND GEN-038 (V72_72) was a post-approval commitment for rMenB+OMV NZ 
vaccine in the US and was merged with the Phase 3 study for GSK pentavalent investigational 
MenABCWY vaccine. 
One of the primary objectives of study V72_72 was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the 
investigational MenABCWY vaccine versus MenACWY vaccine in vaccine-naïve subjects. However, CBER 
recommended to enrol a subset of subjects with a prior history of MenACWY primary vaccination to 
ensure adequate representation of US adolescents and young adults who had been vaccinated 
according to the ACIP recommendations (Meningococcal Vaccination: Recommendations of the 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, United States, 2020 | MMWR (cdc.gov)). 
EMA/8739/2024  
Page 19/26 
 
  
 
 
Considering this CBER recommendation, the Company decided to include subjects who received a 
previous MenACWY vaccination within a timeframe of 4 years. This timeframe reflects the US 
prescribing information regarding the timing of the booster in adolescents and young adults (i.e., 
“Booster Vaccination Adolescents and Adults Aged 15 through 55 Years: A single booster dose of 
MENVEO may be administered to individuals aged 15 through 55 years who are at continued risk for 
meningococcal disease if at least 4 years have elapsed since a prior dose of a meningococcal 
(serogroups A, C, Y, W-135) conjugate vaccine.”). Data supporting this timeframe derived from study 
V59_77, which was submitted in Europe as part of an Article 46 application 
(EMEA/H/C/001095/P46/039). Study V59_77 data did not provide any new conclusions regarding the 
persistence of the immune response as already presented in the MenACWY SmPC. Consequently, the 
Company confirmed that there was no impact on the SmPC and no need to update it. The Agency 
endorsed the rationale provided by the Company.  
It is important to note that the percentage of MenACWY vaccine-primed subjects is only 13% of the 
enrolled population (22 out of 177) in study V72_72. The majority of subjects enrolled in the study 
were vaccine-naïve and the non-inferiority analysis was conducted on subjects who were vaccine 
naïve. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH indicated that participants with a previous history of MenACWY vaccination were included to 
ensure adequate representation of US adolescents and young adults that have been vaccinated 
according to ACIP recommendations based on recommendations of CBER. The timeframe of 4 years 
reflects the US prescribing information. This is acknowledged.  
Only 13% of the enrolled population in the MenACWY group (22 out of 177) has received MenACWY 
vaccination at least 4 years previous. In participants without previous ACWY vaccination, as expected, 
the results were reduced. In participants without previous ACWY vaccination, the percentage of 
participants with hSBA ≥LLOQ 1 month after study vaccination was 89.7%, 59.0%, 65.3% and 76.9% 
for Men A, C, W and Y respectively, compared to 90.2%, 64.0%, 69.3% and 80.0% in the total 
population. The same holds true for the percentage of participants achieving 4-fold rise being 86.0%, 
50.9%, 62.4% and 70.2% in participants without previous ACWY vaccination and 86.0%, 56.7%, 
66.2% and 72.1%. All results are slightly reduced, however the 95% CI overlap. This indicates that in 
participants with a previous vaccination with MenACWY, the current vaccine does act as a booster. 
However, it does not substantially alter any conclusions regarding MenACWY vaccination. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved. 
Question 2 
Subjects were exempted from study participation when they had received a meningococcal C 
vaccination of which the last dose was received at ≤24 months of age. The MAH is requested to explain 
this. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The Company would like to clarify that, as outlined in the study protocol inclusion criterium mentioned 
in the clinical study report, subjects who received a dose of MenC vaccine at ≤24 months of age were 
considered eligible for the enrolment. 
EMA/8739/2024  
Page 20/26 
 
  
 
 
 
Since the study was conducted also outside the US, where MenC vaccination has been the standard of 
care for a significant period, vaccination with MenC has been included among the group of eligible 
vaccinations. Subjects who had received the last dose of MenC at ≤24 months of age were considered 
overall ACWY naïve. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH stated that participants were eligible in case MenC vaccine was received at ≤ 24 months of 
age. It can be agreed that MenC vaccination has been and still is standard of care in multiple countries. 
The explanation is accepted.  
It is noteworthy that the percentage of participants that have hSBA ≥LLOQ for MenC at baseline is 
substantially higher compared to MenA, W and Y, being 28.8% for Men C compared to 11.7%, 12.9% 
and 13.5% for MenA, W and Y respectively. Even in the participants without previous ACWY 
vaccination, the percentage of participants achieving hSBA ≥LLOQ for MenC was 23.1% compared to 
9.2%, 10.7% and 9.0% for Men A, W and Y. This might be explained by participants who did receive 
MenC vaccination at ≤ 24 months of age. This indicates that even though the MAH considers these 
participants “ACWY-naïve, this population of previously MenC vaccinated participants should be taken 
into consideration. However, it does not alter the conclusions of the study. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved. 
Question 3 
For determining the 4-fold rise in hSBA titres, different cut offs (LLOQ) were used as compared to 
previous assays employed in the clinical development of Menveo. The MAH is requested to indicate 
whether different assays were used in this study compared to the studies submitted during Menveo 
approval and to provide comparisons between the assay if available. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The Company confirms that the different cut-offs (limit of blank [LOB], limit of detection [LOD], lower 
limit of quantitation [LLOQ] and upper limit of quantitation [ULOQ]) for each of the MenACWY 
serogroups are associated with different validated human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) formats 
that were used in study V72_72 compared to the assay formats used in studies submitted to the 
Agency in the course of the Menveo vaccine development. 
In the Phase 3 study V72_72, functional immunogenicity induced by the Men A, C, W and Y 
glycoconjugate components of the MenABCWY investigational vaccine and by the licensed Menveo 
vaccine has been assessed with a newly validated quantitative hSBA format, the MenACWY agar-
overlay hSBA. 
The MenACWY agar-overlay hSBA format relays on the same principles of the manual (tilt) hSBA, the 
assay format previously used for clinical testing of Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies submitted in support of 
Menveo initial marketing authorization application (please refer to Standard Operating Procedure 
222582-03 entitled Determination of antibodies against Neisseria meningitidis bacteria of the 
serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y in human sera using SBA (serum meningitidis bacteria) of the 
serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y submitted to EMA with sequence 0042 in the context of procedure 
EMEA/H/C/1095/II/018). 
EMA/8739/2024  
Page 21/26 
 
  
 
 
 
The former manual (tilt) hSBA was performed in the Clinical Serology Laboratory, Novartis Vaccines 
and Diagnostics GmbH in Marburg, Germany. Novartis Vaccines Marburg was acquired by GSK in 2015 
and later became part of Nexelis in 2021, which is now part of Q2 Solution. 
In an effort to streamline and reduce the number of assay formats across GSK clinical trials with 
meningitis vaccines, the manual (tilt) hSBA format for Men A, C, W and Y, performed in Marburg, 
Germany, has been discontinued. The clinical testing of recent and ongoing studies is performed in 
GSK Laboratory in Wavre, Belgium, using the MenACWY agar-overlay hSBA, which has been validated 
using the MenA (3125), MenC (C11), MenW (240070) and MenY (860800) immunogenicity reference 
strains, in compliance with the most recent industry standards for assay validation. 
As of note, the assay format previously used for testing Menveo Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies relied on 
F8238 reference strain to measure Men A bactericidal antibodies, which is different from the one used 
in the current assay (3125).  
The information regarding this new assay format was provided to the Menveo EMA Rapporteur in the 
context of a National Scientific Advice meeting with the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board (MEB) to 
discuss the data generated for the planned line extension application for the new 1-vial presentation of 
Menveo (SA number/case number WAG 23306 case 958685; date of the meeting: 4 October 2022; 
date of the advice: 31 October 2022). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH confirmed that a different serological assay was used during the current study compared to 
the studies included in the initial application. This is acknowledged. 
During the SA no question regarding the use and or applicability of the assay was posed. If the results 
of the current study are to be included in future submissions, it is expected that the assay is fully 
validated. Validation documents are expected to be included in the future submission.  
Conclusion 
Issue solved. 
Question 4 
A total of 177 subjects were randomized into the MenACWY group, whereas 178 subjects were in the 
(un)solicited safety set. It is unclear where this extra subject came from. The MAH is requested to 
explain this. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The extra subject was randomized to the MenB_0_6 group but received MenACWY vaccine as a first 
dose. For this reason, this subject was included and analysed in the safety analyses in the MenACWY 
group, therefore the solicited and unsolicited safety set, which is based on the exposed set, included 
178 instead of 177 subjects. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The explanation of the MAH is understood and appreciated. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved. 
EMA/8739/2024  
Page 22/26 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Question 5 
The MAH is requested to discuss the rather low percentage of subjects with a 4-fold rise in hSBA levels 
for serogroup C and W one month after MenACWY vaccination. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The Company acknowledges the observed low percentage of subjects with a 4-fold rise in hSBA levels 
for serogroup C and W one month after MenACWY vaccination and would like to explain that these 
differences can be attributed to the characteristics of the serology assay used, including different LLOQ 
employed to calculate the 4-fold rise in hSBA levels and 4-fold definition. Of note, a more conservative 
approach was taken in study V72_72 compared to the MenACWY development program studies. 
Based on that, the Company believes that these observations do not lead to a different immunological 
response to the vaccine, which is overall robust. Despite the differences in assay characteristics, the 
results remain clinically meaningful and consistent across studies. Furthermore, the results are in line 
with the information outlined in the currently approved SmPC. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
It is acknowledged that comparing immunogenicity results across studies conducted in different 
populations and time periods should be performed with caution. The explanation of the MAH regarding 
the use of a different assay, leading to differences in the LLOQ to calculate a 4-fold rise, and a different 
definition of a 4-fold rise can be accepted. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved. 
Question 6 
GMT levels one month after MenACWY vaccination observed in this study are considerably higher 
(194.3-458.7) when compared to GMTs listed in the SmPC. The MAH is requested to also elaborate on 
this discrepancy. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The Company acknowledges the observed difference in GMT levels one month after MenACWY 
vaccination between study V72_72 and the GMTs reported in the SmPC.  
However, the Company would like to clarify that a direct comparison of GMTs data across studies 
conducted in different populations and time periods should be performed with caution. In addition, 
study V72_72 data have been generated through serology assays with different characteristics and 
using a different imputation method for calculating the GMTs. 
Despite the above, the GMTs results aligned with the response observed in previous studies detailed in 
the SmPC. It is important to note that, despite these observations, the immunological response to the 
vaccine remains robust and is expected to be consistent with the data reported in the SmPC. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Again, it is acknowledged that comparing immunogenicity results across studies conducted in different 
populations and time periods should be performed with caution. The explanation of the MAH regarding 
the use of a different assay and different imputation method for calculating GMTs can be accepted. 
EMA/8739/2024

Conclusion 
Issue solved. 
Question 7 
Narratives for all SAEs were not provided, which hampers any assessment of relatedness to MenACWY 
vaccination. The MAH is asked to present all narratives of SAEs occurring in groups receiving a 
MenACWY vaccination; the MenB_0_2_6, MenB_0_6 group and the ACWY group. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The Company acknowledges the request and provides the complete narratives of SAEs occurring in 
groups receiving a MenACWY vaccination (MenB_0_2_6 group, MenB_0_6 group, and ACWY group) as 
annexes to this document. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
It is noted that not all narratives are provided in the annex as narratives already presented in the 
report were not also included in the annex. However, the fact that the additional narratives were 
provided is appreciated. It can be agreed, based on these narratives, that the newly provided 
narratives do not give rise to any new safety signal. None of the SAEs were considered related to 
MenACWY vaccination, which can be agreed. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved. 
Question 8 
A higher percentage of subjects reported a local or systemic solicited event in the ACWY group when 
compared to the MenB_0_6 group. The MAH is requested to discuss this difference. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The Company acknowledges the observed overall higher percentage of subjects reporting a local or 
systemic solicited event in the ACWY group when compared to the MenB_0_6 group. 
It is important to note that the percentages of local and systemic solicited events in the ACWY group 
are consistent with the data generated during the MenACWY development program studies, which 
supported its licensure.  
There is no biologically plausible reason for the observed difference. Indeed, the study was designed to 
minimize the potential introduction of reporting bias by ensuring that the study subjects were unaware 
of which vaccine they received, as it was conducted in a blinded manner. 
Overall, the observed data are in line with the data reported in the SmPC. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The fact that the study is blinded and includes placebo injections is appreciated. It can be agreed that 
the data are in general in line with the data reported in the SmPC.

Conclusion 
Issue solved. 
Question 9 
Critically review the failure of your quality system, including root cause analysis and CAPAs, that 
caused the need for republishing of the Clinical Study Report. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
As mentioned in Response to Question 3, the clinical testing of study V72_72 was performed using the 
Men A, C, W and Y agar-overlay hSBAs. The need for republishing the clinical study report comes from 
a change to the Men A, C, W and Y agar-overlay hSBA limits of quantitation (LOQs). 
As per internal quality control framework, the Company monitors the stability of a validated assay 
through regular testing (minimum once every 6 months) of a proficiency panel of samples (referred to 
as “Assay stability monitoring [ASM] test”). 
In December 2022 and January 2023, ASM tests revealed an excursion of stability of the 4 Men A, C, 
W and Y agar-overlay hSBAs. There was a trend to underestimate Men A, C, W and Y hSBA titers. 
Investigations were launched and duly documented through an unplanned event in quality-controlled 
system. The Company identified a change to sample preparation introduced in the assay standard 
operating procedure (SOP) “Measurement of bactericidal activity of human serum antibodies to 
Neisseria meningitidis A, C, W & Y with the manual agar overlay hSBA” version 06 (LSOP 9000064782 
version 06) as the main root cause of the observed trend. 
As corrective action, the Company invalidated the laboratory results generated according to this LSOP 
9000064782 version 06. These data included dilutional linearity validation data generated in 2022 
using a negative non-depleted serum matrix following CBER recommendations, and from which were 
derived the LOQs used in the version 01 of the CSR for study V72_72. The version 06 was made 
obsolete. The version 07 of the SOP was issued to re-introduce the sample preparation in use in LSOP 
9000064782 version 05 and previous versions. Dilutional linearity validation experiments were 
repeated leading to an update of Men A, C, W and Y agar-overlay hSBA limits. These new limits, 
compiled in Table 1, were used to create the version 02 of the CSR for study V72_72. 
Of note, the Company would like to clarify that clinical testing of study V72-72 was finalized before 
effectivity of the LSOP 9000064782 version 06. Impact of the stability excursion only affected the 
above mentioned dilutional linearity validation data generated in 2022, and in turn, the assay LOQs. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The explanation of the MAH is appreciated. It is acknowledged that sample preparation can affect 
dilutional linearity.  
Based on the validation of the agar-overlay hSBA in 2020 using LSOP 9000064782 version 02, dilution 
linearity led to other LLOQ values for Men A, C, W and Y. As the LLOQ of the assay increased and 
remained well above the CoP, no clinical impact is expected based on changes in the LLOQ. 
It is noteworthy however, that based on the CSR version 2, not only limits of quantitation for the hSBA 
were updated, but also for the ECL assay. It is currently unknown why the ECL assay was subjected to 
an update. Considering that the update of the ECL assay only led to minute changes in IgG results in 
the Menveo group, this issue is not further pursued.

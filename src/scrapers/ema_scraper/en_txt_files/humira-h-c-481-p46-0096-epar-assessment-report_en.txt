1.  Introduction 
On 17 August 2016, the MAH submitted a clinical study report concerning a completed paediatric study 
performed in Japan for Humira, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as 
amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Humira and 
that there is no consequential regulatory action. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Clinical aspects 
2.1.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted the final study report from the Japanese non-PASS PMOS study P12-706. 
2.1.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
Clinical study number and title  
HUMIRA® 40 mg syringe 0.8mL for Subcutaneous Injection Special investigation (All-case survey) in 
patients with Crohn's disease 
Methods 
The investigation was performed as a single cohort non-interventional observational study, for the 
purpose of evaluating the safety and effectiveness of adalimumab in patients with Crohn's disease 
under actual clinical use. Patients with moderate to severe active Crohn's disease not responding to 
conventional treatment were included. 
Adalimumab was administered by subcutaneous injections at a starting dose of 160 mg, and 
subsequent dose of 80 mg at week 2 and 40 mg eow from week 4. 
The observation period for each subject was 24 weeks. 
The primary endpoint of the study was safety as determined by the list of adverse reaction and 
infections. 
The secondary endpoint was effectiveness evaluated by CDAI, endoscopic findings and by treating 
practitioners overall assessment of improvement on completion of the study or discontinuation. 
Statistical tests were two-tailed with the significance level 0.05. Statistical methods used were: 
stepwise multivariate analyses, paired t-test, and Cochran-Armitage test. No adjustment was made for 
multiple centres because the number of subjects per centre was limited. The primary analysis of the 
primary safety and effectiveness variable was performed using Observed Case (OC).

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Overall there were 1,716 patients enrolled of whom 1,693 were included in the safety analysis set and 
1667 patients in the efficacy analysis set.  
Baseline data 
Of 1,693 patients included in the safety analysis set, 65.5% (1109/1693) were male and 34.5% 
(584/1693) were female. The mean age at administration was 35.5 ± 11.7 years, mean BMI was 19.9 
± 3.15, mean morbidity period of Crohn's disease as of the first administration of adalimumab was 
11.1 ± 8.0 years. The reason for use was Crohn's disease in 99.8% (1690/1693), intestinal Bechet's 
diseases in 0.1% (2/1693), and multiple non-specific small intestine ulcer in 0.1% (1/1693). 
At baseline, 110 (6.5%) patients were between the age of 15 and 19 years and 13 (0.8%) patients 
were younger than 15 years. There were 54 paediatric patients under the age of 18 years ranging 
between 9 and 17 years of age at baseline. 
During the follow-up period, 17.2% (292/1693) of the patients needed discontinuation of adalimumab 
therapy due to lack of efficacy (37.0%, 108/292), adverse events (28.4%, 83/292), no visit (including 
hospital transfer) (16.8%, 49/292), patient request (12.7%, 37/1693), and other reasons (5.1%, 
15/292). 
CHMP comment 
No baseline characteristics, demographic data, medical history or reasons for discontinuations have 
been presented for the paediatric population. 
Safety results 
During the observation period, 527 adverse drug reactions were reported by 360 patients (21.3%). 
One hundred twenty-six (126) serious adverse drug reactions were reported by 96 patients (5.7%). 
196 serious AEs were reported by 147 (8.7%) patients. Forty-five (45) cases reported by 44 patients 
were serious infections (2.3%). 
Of the 54 paediatric patients fifteen experienced a total of 19 AEs. The most common AEs were CD and 
upper respiratory tract inflammation which were reported twice, respectively. Three SAEs (CD (2), 
blood creatine phosphokinase increased) were reported in 2 patients. Five infections were reported 
(pneumonia, nasopharyngitis, infectious mononucleosis, herpes zoster, influenza) which all were non-
serious and which completely resolved or improved during the observation period. No deaths, 
malignancies, TB, or demyelinating disorder occurred in paediatric patients. 
CHMP comment 
No new safety issues were identified in the paediatric population included in the study. 
Efficacy results 
The changes in CDAI scores from baseline to Week 24 in 1667 patients in the effectiveness analysis 
set, CDAI scores (mean ± SD) changed from 204.3 ± 105.7 at Week 0 to 142.9 ± 90.4 at Week 4, 
142.7 ± 93.8 at Week 8, and 149.1 ± 100.9 at Week 24. CDAI scores at each evaluation time point 
were significantly lower than the score at Week 0 (p < 0.0001, paired t-test).

CHMP comment 
Efficacy results have been presented for the whole population included but not for the paediatric 
population of interest. 
2.1.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Although no new safety issues have been identified in the paediatric population included in the study 
no data has been presented on the characteristics of the included children or on the efficacy of the 
treatment in this population. For an evaluation of the benefit risk in the studied population such data 
should be submitted. 
Secondary round 
Baseline data paediatric population 
Of the 54 paediatric patients included in the study (9 to 18 years of age), the proportion of males was 
61 % (33/54 patients). 
The largest proportion of patients at baseline had CD of the ileum (72 %) and colon (59 %). 
All paediatric patients had received either 5-aminosalicylic acid (92.6%; 50/54 patients), steroids 
(18.5%; 10/54), or immunosuppressants1 (11.1%; 6/54) for Crohn's disease prior to this study.  
Efficacy results 
At week 24, CDAI scores were available from 31 patients. Of these 67.7% (21/31 patients) achieved 
clinical remission (CDAI < 150).  
Treatment discontinuation before the end of observation period, 24 weeks, occurred in 10 pediatric 
patients. Reasons for the discontinuation were "inadequate response" in 6 patients, "no visit" in 2 and 
"adverse events" in 2 patients. For 3 of the 6 subjects with an inadequate response at week 24, CDAI 
scores were < 150 at week 4 but increased thereafter. For 3 patients with an inadequate response 
there were no CDAI score available. The adverse events that were the causes for discontinuations 
concerned Liver disorder in one patient and Crohn's disease and Blood creatine phosphokinase 
increased in one. 
2.1.4.  Updated discussion on clinical aspects 
The requested efficacy data have been submitted. Efficacy was shown in the pediatric population and 
no new safety concerns were identified.  
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The MAH’s conclusion that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Humira 
and that there is no consequential regulatory action, is supported.  
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: No regulatory action required.

3.  Scientific discussion  
3.1.  Introduction 
Cervarix was registered in the European Union on 20 September 2007. The vaccine is currently licensed 
for use in more than  100 countries worldwide. Cervarix is indicated for the prevention of premalignant 
cervical lesions and cervical cancer causally related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18. The 
indication is based on demonstration of efficacy in women aged 15-25 years following vaccination with 
Cervarix and on the immunogenicity of the vaccine in girls and women aged 10-25 years. The vaccination 
course consists of three doses administered according to a 0, 1, 6 month schedule via intramuscular 
injection. 
The MAH has submitted data from the final analysis of study HPV-008, to support the present variation. 
On the basis of these data the MAH proposes to update section 4.1 of the SmPC to include persistent 
infection and to further update sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The study report of study HPV-008 should be considered final for the histopathological primary and 
secondary endpoints (CIN1+, CIN2+). The MAH performed the final analysis of study HPV-008 once the 
number of subjects required for the statistical analysis of the composite endpoint was reached. At that 
time point the majority of subjects had not yet reached the study endpoint that was fixed at Month 48 
and therefore several analyses were still pending. The MAH expects to provide this information in an 
annex report that is expected by the end of 2010 (FUM23). 
3.2.  Clinical efficacy 
3.2.1.  Study HPV 008 
HPV-008 is a controlled, double blinded Phase III randomised clinical trial performed in Asia Pacific, 
Europe, Latin America and North America. HPV-008 has been conducted under the supervision of an 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) with duration of 48 months of follow-up. 
The (event-driven) interim analysis was performed when 23 cases of  CIN2+ associated with HPV-16 or 
HPV-18 were detected in the Total Vaccinated Cohort (TVC). 
The final analysis of all histopathological and virological endpoints had to be performed when at least 36 
evaluable cases of CIN2+ associated with HPV-16 or HPV-18 infection, including at least 15 cases of 
CIN2+ associated with HPV-18 infection were detected in the According to Protocol (ATP) cohort of 
efficacy. The submitted final analysis was performed when 60 CIN2+ cases were identified (Data Lock 
Point of 31st August 2008).

3.2.1.1.  Methods 
Study participants and sample sizes 
A total of 18729 subjects were enrolled in the study. The study is conducted in  135 centres in 14 
countries spread across four study regions: Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America and North America. The 
target was to enrol approximately 18 000 unscreened women aged 15 to 25 years.  
Inclusion Criteria 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected to allow enrolment of a broad population of women, 
including both those previously uninfected with HPV (HPV naïve) and those previously or currently 
infected with HPV (HPV non-naïve). No HPV serological testing, HPV DNA screening or cervical cytological 
screening was performed prior to enrolment.  
A woman between, and including, 15 and 25 years of age at the time of the first vaccination. 
Subject must be free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical 
examination before entering into the study. 
Subject must have a negative urine pregnancy test. 
Subject must be of non-childbearing potential (e.g. surgically sterilized) or, if of childbearing potential, 
she must be abstinent or must be using adequate contraceptive precautions for 30 days prior to the first 
vaccination and must agree to continue such precautions for two months after completion of the 
vaccination series. 
Subject has had no more than 6 lifetime sexual partners prior to enrolment. This criterion may not be 
applicable in subjects less than 18 years of age, according to local regulatory/ethical requirements. 
Subject must have intact cervix (e.g. no history of cauterization or surgical treatment involving damage 
to the transformation zone of the cervix). 
Main Exclusion Criteria 
Pregnant or breastfeeding. Women must be at least 3 months post-pregnancy and not breastfeeding to 
enter the study. 
A woman planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions during 
approximately the first nine months of the study (Months 0-8). 
Previous administration of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) or AS04 adjuvant. 
Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) 
within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. 
Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immune-
modifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. Inhaled and topical steroids were 
allowed.  
Planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days before and 30 days 
after (i.e. days 0-29) each dose of vaccine.  
Page 4/27
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
History of having had colposcopy or has planned a colposcopy to evaluate an abnormal cervical cytology 
(Pap smear) test. 
Received immunoglobulins and/or blood product within 90 days preceding enrolment. Enrolment will be 
deferred until the subject is outside of specified window. 
Study cohorts/data sets analysed 
At the final analysis, the ATP cohort for efficacy was the primary cohort for all endpoints, except for 
endpoints evaluated in HPV DNA positive women at Month 0. 
Analysis of safety is performed on the Total Vaccinated cohort (primary analysis) and on the ATP cohort 
for safety. 
Analysis of immunogenicity is performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity (primary analysis) and on 
the Total Vaccinated cohort. 
According-to-protocol (ATP) cohort for analysis of efficacy 
The ATP cohort for analysis of efficacy includes all valuable subjects (i.e. those meeting all eligibility 
criteria, complying with the procedures defined in the protocol, with no elimination violations) for whom 
data concerning efficacy endpoint measures are available and have a normal or low-grade cytology (i.e. 
negative or ASCUS or Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL)) at Month 0. In addition, 
subjects must be negative for HPV DNA (by PCR) at Months 0 and 6 for the corresponding HPV type 
considered in the analysis (i.e. HPV type associated with the efficacy endpoint). For this cohort, the 
follow-up time for a subject started at the day after Dose 3. For all stratified efficacy endpoints, the 
principal analysis is performed on subjects who were seronegative (by ELISA) prior to vaccination for the 
corresponding HPV type considered in the analysis. At the final analysis, the ATP cohort for efficacy was 
the primary cohort for all endpoints, except for endpoints evaluated in HPV DNA positive woman at Month 
0. 
Total Vaccinated cohort for efficacy 1 (TVC-1) 
The total vaccinated cohort for efficacy-1 (TVC-1) included all vaccinated subjects who had received at 
least one dose, for whom data concerning efficacy endpoint measures were available and who had a 
normal or low-grade cytology (defined as negative, or ASCUS or LSIL) at Month 0. For this cohort, the 
follow-up time for a subject started the day after Dose 1. 
In addition, subjects had to be negative for HPV DNA (by PCR) at Month 0 for the corresponding HPV type 
in the analysis (i.e., the HPV type associated with the efficacy endpoint), except for the endpoints 
evaluated in HPV DNA positive women at Month 0. At the final analysis, TVC-1 was the primary cohort for 
all endpoints evaluated in HPV DNA positive women at Month 0. 
For all stratified efficacy endpoints, the principal analysis was performed on subjects who were 
seronegative (by ELISA) prior to vaccination for the corresponding HPV type. 
Total Vaccinated cohort for efficacy 2 (TVC-2) 
The total vaccinated cohort for efficacy 2 (TVC-2) included all vaccinated subjects who had received at 
least one dose and for whom data concerning efficacy endpoint measures were available, and who had a 
normal cytology at Month 0. For this cohort, the follow up-time for a subject started the day after Dose 1. 
Page 5/27
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, subjects had to be negative for HPV DNA (by PCR) at Month 0 for the corresponding HPV type 
in the analysis (i.e., the HPV type associated with the efficacy endpoint), except for the endpoints 
evaluated in HPV DNA positive women at Month 0. 
For all stratified efficacy endpoints, the principal analysis was performed on subjects who were 
seronegative (by ELISA) prior to vaccination for the corresponding HPV type. 
The TVC-2 analysis complements the TVC-1 analysis for efficacy and was only performed on primary, 
secondary endpoints and selected exploratory endpoints. 
Total vaccinated cohort for efficacy (TVC)  
The TVC for efficacy included all vaccinated subjects who had received at least one dose and for whom 
data were available for the analysis of efficacy endpoints. For this cohort, the follow-up time for a subject 
started the day after Dose 1. Unless otherwise specified, the results for the TVC cohort are provided in 
the Supplements to the clinical study report. 
ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity 
The ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity includes all valuable subjects (i.e. those meeting all 
eligibility criteria, complying with the procedures defined in the protocol, with no elimination criteria 
during the study) for whom data concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures are available. This 
includes subjects for whom assay results are available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine 
antigen component after vaccination. Subjects who acquire either HPV-16 or HPV-18 infection during the 
trial are excluded from the ATP cohort for immunogenicity. 
Treatments 
The candidate HPV vaccine and hepatitis A control vaccine were administered (0.5 ml dose) 
intramuscularly into the deltoid of the non-dominant arm according to a 0, 1, 6-month schedule. 
For the immunogenicity subset blood samples were drawn from all subjects at Months 0, 7 and 24 for 
HPV-16/18 serology testing by ELISA. Exit colposcopy was performed within 30 days after cytology 
results of the Month 48 visit depending on the cytological results. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of study HPV-008 was to demonstrate, that Cervarix protects individuals from 
histopathologically confirmed CIN2+ associated with HPV-16 or HPV-18 cervical infection detected within 
the lesional component of the cervical tissue specimen (by PCR), overall and stratified according to initial 
(Month 0) HPV-16 and/or 18 serostatus (by ELISA). CIN2+ is defined as CIN2, CIN3, adenocarcinoma in-
situ (AIS) and invasive cervical cancer. 
Secondary objectives included the prevention of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, protection 
against persistent infection with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 and the immunological response to vaccination. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint for the interim analysis was protection against CIN2+ lesions associated with HPV-
16 and/or HPV-18 among subjects who are negative for HPV DNA (by PCR) at baseline for the 
corresponding HPV type. 
Page 6/27
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary Endpoints included  
Protection against persistent infection (6-month and 12-month definition) with HPV-16 or HPV-18 among 
subjects who are negative for HPV DNA at baseline for the corresponding HPV type. 
Protection against persistent infection (6-month definition) with the following oncogenic HPV types 16, 
18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68.  
Protection against CIN2+ and CIN1+ associated with HPV-16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 
66 and 68. 
Immune response in a subset of subjects from selected study sites and immune correlates of protection 
against persistent infection. 
Statistical methods 
Incidence rates and vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 (by PCR) in 
HPV DNA negative and seronegative subjects at baseline have been calculated using the conditional exact 
method. 
3.2.1.2.  Results 
Primary endpoint: CIN2+ associated with HPV-16/18 
At the time of the final analysis there were 60 cases of the primary endpoint in the ATP cohort for efficacy 
(48 cases associated with HPV-16, 17 cases associated with HPV-18 and 5 cases associated with both  
HPV-16 and HPV-18) in subjects who were HPV DNA negative at Month 0 and 6, and seronegative at 
Month 0, for the corresponding type found in the lesion.  
Vaccine efficacy (VE) against CIN3, adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and invasive cervical cancer (CIN3+) 
was to be evaluated as an exploratory endpoint if there were a sufficient number of CIN3+ cases. 
Vaccine efficacy against HPV-16/18 CIN2+  
Statistically significant VE was observed for CIN2+ associated with HPV-16, HPV-18 and HPV-16/HPV-18 
(see Table 1). The primary objective was met.

Of the 60 cases of CIN2+, there were 12 cases of CIN3+ (9 cases of CIN3, 2 cases of AIS and 1 case of 
both CIN3 and AIS) with 2 cases in the HPV group and 10 cases in the HAV group. As there were 
sufficient cases of CIN3+ identified, an additional exploratory analysis was performed of VE against 
CIN3+ associated with HPV-16/18. VE against CIN3+ associated with HPV-16/18 was statistically 
significant at 80.0% [96.1% CI: 0.3, 98.1], p=0.0221 with 2 cases in the HPV group versus 10 cases in 
the HAV group in the ATP cohort for efficacy.  
Similar results were observed in TVC-1. Vaccine-efficacy against CIN2+ associated with HPV-16/18 was 
94.5% [96.1% CI: 86.2, 98.4], p<0.0001 with 5 cases in the HPV group versus 91 cases in the HAV 
group in TVC-1. 
Vaccine efficacy against HPV-16/18 CIN2+ in HPV DNA negative and seronegative subjects (exploratory 
HPV TAA) 
The pre-specified analysis of the VE against HPV-16/18 CIN2+ shown in Table 1 was based only on the 
detection of viral DNA by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in the biopsy sample without considering 
whether or not the HPV type(s) detected were likely to be causally responsible for the development of the 
lesion. This is important since further investigation identified that multiple oncogenic HPV types are 
frequently detected in cervical lesions. 
A high proportion of the 60 CIN2+ cases in the primary analysis of the ATP cohort had more than one 
HPV type detected in the lesion (36 cases with another HPV type of which 33 were with non-vaccine 
oncogenic HPV types). A review of the HPV DNA detected in biopsies and preceding cytological specimens 
showed that in 6 of these cases in the ATP cohort for efficacy (3 cases in the HPV group and 3 in the HAV 
group) multiple HPV types were identified in the lesion without preceding infection with the vaccine type. 
For each of these cases, another oncogenic HPV type was also detected in the lesion and there was 
evidence of long standing infection with the other oncogenic HPV type (in each case infection with the 
other type was present at study entry). These data strongly suggested that the 3 cases in the HPV group 
were not vaccine breakthrough cases, but were likely to be causally associated with a non-vaccine HPV 
type. The exploratory analysis based on HPV TAA is shown in Table 2.

LL,UL=96.1% Lower and Upper confidence limits; P-value=Two-sided Fisher Exact test  
When the HPV TAA was applied to the analysis of CIN3+ related to HPV-16/18 in the ATP cohort for 
efficacy, VE was significant at 100% [96.1% CI: 36.4, 100], p=0.0038 with 0 cases in the HPV group 
versus 8 cases in the HAV group. 
Similar results were seen in TVC-1 using the HPV TAA for this analysis. Vaccine-efficacy against CIN2+ 
associated with HPV-16/18 was 97.7% [96.1% CI: 91.0, 99.8], p<0.0001 with 2 cases in the HPV group 
versus 87 cases in the HAV group in TVC-1. 
Vaccine efficacy against HPV-16/18 CIN2+ in HPV DNA negative subjects at baseline, regardless of initial 
serostatus 
At enrolment, 13.9% of subjects were HPV DNA negative and seropositive for HPV-16 and 10.6% of 
subjects were HPV DNA negative and seropositive for HPV-18. 
In subjects HPV DNA negative at baseline, regardless of initial serostatus, VE against CIN2+ associated 
with HPV-16/18 was statistically significant in both the ATP cohort for efficacy and TVC-1. 
Vaccine efficacy against HPV-16/18 CIN2+ in HPV DNA negative and seropositive subjects 
There were fewer cases of histopathological and virological endpoints associated with HPV-16/18 in the 
smaller population of subjects who were HPV DNA negative but seropositive for the corresponding type at 
baseline. 
There were 8 cases of CIN2+ associated with HPV-16 and no cases with HPV-18 (2 cases in the HPV 
group and 6 cases in the HAV group) in the ATP cohort for efficacy. Of these 8 cases, there were 3 cases 
of CIN3, all in the HAV group. Multiple HPV types were detected in the majority of lesions. In TVC-1 there 
were 13 cases of the CIN2+, all associated with HPV-16 (3 in the HPV group and 10 in the HAV group).  
VE against CIN2+ associated with HPV-16/18 in the ATP cohort for efficacy and TVC-1 was therefore not 
statistically significant. 
Based on the exploratory analysis using the HPV TAA, vaccine efficacy was not statistically significant in 
the ATP cohort for efficacy, but was statistically significant in TVC-1 (VE=88.5% [96.1% CI: 10.8, 99.8], 
p=0.0215), with 1 case in the HPV group versus 9 cases in the HAV group. 
When these cohorts were analysed using the HPV TAA, VE against CIN2+ associated with HPV-16 was not 
statistically significant in the ATP cohort for efficacy (VE=100% [96.1% CI: -22.1, 100], p=0.0623), with 
0 cases in the HPV group versus 5 cases in the HAV group, but was statistically significant in TVC-1 
(VE=88.5% [96.1% CI: 10.8, 99.8], p=0.0215), with 1 case in the HPV group versus 9 cases in the HAV 
group. 
However, statistically significant VE was observed for both 6M and 12M-persistent infections with HPV-
16/18 and for other clinical endpoints (ASC-US+ and CIN1+) associated with HPV-16/18 in subjects that 
were HPV DNA negative and seropositive at baseline in TVC-1.

For oncogenic HPV types other than HPV-16 and HPV-18, VE against 6-month persistent infection was 
statistically significant for HPV-31, HPV-33 and HPV-45 in the ATP cohort for efficacy. Similar results were 
seen in TVC-1, the VE against HPV-51 was also significant.

Vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ associated with oncogenic HPV in subjects HPV DNA negative for the 
corresponding type at baseline, regardless of initial serostatus 
VE against CIN2+ associated with High-risk (oncogenic) HPV types: HPV-16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 
52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68 (HR-HPV) in subjects HPV DNA negative for the corresponding HPV type at 
baseline, regardless of serostatus was statistically significant. VE against CIN2+ associated with All high-
risk (oncogenic) HPV types excluding HPV-16 and HPV-18 (High-risk (oncogenic) HPV types: HPV-31, 33, 
35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68) (HRW-HPV) was also statistically significant. However, it 
should be noted that the analyses of HRW-HPV may include lesions with multiple HPV types which, 
although associated with another oncogenic type besides HPV-16/18, may also contain HPV-16 or HPV-18 
within the lesion (as these two types are ignored in the case definition). Therefore, the analysis of VE for 
histopathological endpoints with HRW-HPV may still be partially confounded by the presence of HPV-16 
and/or HPV-18 (Table 6). 
Statistically significant efficacy was observed against CIN2+ associated with high-risk types combined, 
excluding HPV-16 and HPV-18 (VE=54.0% [96.1% CI: 34.0;68.4] in the ATP cohort and VE=46.0% 
[96.1% CI: 27.0;60.3] in the TVC-1 cohort). 
For the oncogenic HPV types other than HPV-16/18, statistically significant VE was observed for HPV-31, 
HPV-51 and HPV-58 in the ATP cohort. The point estimate for VE against HPV-45 was 100%, but this 
analysis did not reach statistical significance due to few cases (0 cases in the HPV group versus 4 cases in 
the HAV group).

For the oncogenic HPV types other than HPV-16/18, statistically significant VE against CIN2+ was 
observed for HPV-31, HPV-33, HPV-35 and HPV-51 in TVC-1. In contrast to the results in the ATP cohort 
for efficacy, statistically significant  VE was observed for HPV-33 and HPV-35, but not for HPV-58 in TVC-
1. 
In the TAA analysis, vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ associated with high-risk HPV types combined, 
excluding HPV-16 and HPV-18, was 53.9% [96.1% CI: 32.6;69.0]). 
Following CHMP request to provide all available evidence that 6-month and 12-month persistent 
infections due to non-HPV16/18 types are surrogate markers that are equivalent to CIN2+ lesions in 
predicting cervical cancer the MAH has submitted table 7 below summarising all the relevant results 
obtained.

ATP: includes women who received 3 doses of vaccine, were DNA negative and seronegative at month 0 and DNA negative at month 6 to the relevant HPV type (HPV-16 or HPV-18) 
TVC-1: includes women who received at least one dose of vaccine for whom data concerning efficacy endpoint measures were available and who had a normal or low-grade cytology (i.e. negative 
or ASC-US or LSIL) at Month 0. Subjects had to be negative for HPV DNA (by PCR) at Month 0 for the corresponding HPV type considered in the analysis (i.e. HPV type associated with the efficacy 
endpoint), except for the endpoints evaluated in HPV DNA positive women at Month 0. The follow-up time for subjects started the day after Dose 1 
TVC: includes all women who received at least one dose of vaccine, irrespective of their HPV DNA status, cytology and serostatus at baseline. This cohort included women with or without current 
and/or prior HPV infection. Case counting for the TVC started on day 1 after the first dose. 
TVC-naïve: is a subset of the TVC that includes women with normal cytology, and who were HPV DNA negative for 14 oncogenic HPV types and seronegative for HPV-16 and HPV-18 at baseline.

Overall vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ in subjects irrespective of HPV type in the lesion, stratified 
according to a subjects’ baseline HPV DNA status 
Vaccine efficacy against all CIN2+, (prophylactic efficacy) irrespective of HPV DNA results, in subjects 
DNA negative for all oncogenic HPV types at baseline, regardless of initial serostatus (TVC-1) was 
63.8% (96.1% CI: 49.0;74.7) 
Vaccine efficacy against all CIN2+, (overall efficacy) irrespective of HPV DNA results, in all subjects 
irrespective of baseline HPV DNA and serostatus (TVC-1) was 30.9% (96.1% CI: 16.4;43.0) 
In the broader Total Vaccinated Cohort (TVC) which included all vaccinated women, overall efficacy 
against CIN2+ was 30.4% (96.1% CI: 16.4;42.1) and prophylactic efficacy in women negative for 14 
oncogenic types was 70.2% (96.1% CI: 54.7;80.9). 
Vaccine efficacy against CIN3+ irrespective of HPV DNA results in all subjects, irrespective of their 
baseline HPV DNA and serostatus (TVC-1) was 37.7% (96.1% CI: 12.6;55.9) with 64 CIN3+ cases in 
the vaccine group versus 103 CIN3+ cases in the control group. 
In the broader Total Vaccinated Cohort (TVC) which included all vaccinated women, overall efficacy 
against CIN3+ was 33.4% (96.1% CI: 9.1;51.5) and prophylactic efficacy in women negative for 14 
oncogenic types was 87.0% (96.1% CI: 54.9;97.7). 
Reduction of local cervical therapy 
Cervarix reduced definitive cervical therapy procedures (includes loop electrosurgical excision 
procedure [LEEP], cold-knife Cone, and laser procedures) by 68.8% (96.1% CI: 50.0;81.2) in TVC 
naïve and by 24.7% (96.1% CI: 7.4;38.9) in TVC.  
Vaccine efficacy against HPV-16/18 in HPV DNA positive subjects at baseline 
Results for vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ and CIN1+ associated with HPV-16/18 in subjects who were 
HPV DNA positive at baseline were not statistically significant. The lack of efficacy in subjects infected 
at baseline with the type considered in the analysis indicated the lack of therapeutic effect in the 
presence of active infection. 
Vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ associated with HPV-16/18 in HPV DNA positive and seronegative 
subjects at baseline in TVC-1 was 37.8% [96.1% CI: -20.9, 68.8], p=0.1216, with 18 cases in the HPV 
group versus 27 cases in the HAV group. The majority of cases in this analysis were associated with 
HPV-16 (41 cases) and only 5 cases were associated with HPV-18. 
Vaccine effect on viral clearance of HPV-16/18 infection in HPV DNA positive subjects at baseline (TVC-
1) 
The analyses were performed on subjects that were HPV DNA positive for the corresponding type at 
baseline. Clearance was defined as the first negative sample for HPV DNA (by PCR) for the 
corresponding HPV type after Month 0, after which no positive samples occur, i.e. subjects had to be 
negative at the last visit for which a DNA result was available. 
No significant differences were observed between the HPV and HAV group in terms of clearance of HPV 
infection present at the study start (Table 11).

3.2.1.3.  Discussion 
The prophylactic efficacy of Cervarix in female adolescents and young adult women is fully confirmed 
by the longer follow-up (approximately 39 months) and the generation of more robust efficacy data in 
the final analysis of study HPV-008. Since vaccine efficacy in the follow-up period essentially evaluates 
prevention of newly acquired infections and associated lesions, the proportion of new lesions in the 
control group acquired after study entry increased over time. As a consequence, vaccine efficacy at the 
final analysis was higher than at the interim analysis. 
Although the young adolescent / pre-adolescent female population remains the primary focus for 
universal mass vaccination programmes, women who have previously been exposed to HPV through 
sexual activity can still benefit from prophylactic vaccination with Cervarix. Vaccine efficacy against 
CIN2+ associated with HPV-16/18, regardless of baseline serostatus, was indicative of prophylactic 
vaccine efficacy in a general population of women, unscreened for serology. Individuals already 
infected with one vaccine type prior to vaccination were protected from clinical disease caused by the 
other vaccine type. 
The overall impact of vaccination in subjects irrespective of the HPV DNA in the lesion, regardless of 
serostatus, against CIN2+ demonstrated statistically significant efficacy in the broader Total 
Vaccinated Cohort 30.4% (96.1% CI: 16.4;42.1) and was consistent with the overall reduction of local 
cervical therapy (24.7%). The prophylactic efficacy against CIN2+ in women who were negative for 14 
oncogenic HPV types at baseline (representative of an HPV naïve population), irrespective of the HPV 
DNA type in the lesion and regardless of initial serostatus, was statistically significant (VE=70.2% 
(96.1% CI: 54.7;80.9) in TVC. 
Cervarix has demonstrated a level of efficacy beyond the vaccine types HPV-16 and HPV-18. Disease 
endpoints such as CIN2+ are the most relevant endpoints when considering the potential public health 
benefit of cross-protection with combined oncogenic HPV types. Statistically significant efficacy was 
observed against CIN2+ associated with high-risk types combined, excluding HPV-16 and HPV-18 
Page 19/27
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
(VE=54.0% [96.1% CI: 34.0;68.4] in the ATP cohort and VE=46.0% [96.1% CI: 27.0;60.3] in the 
TVC-1 cohort).  
Statistically significant vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ was observed for HPV types -31, -51 and -58 in 
the ATP cohort and for HPV types -31, -33, -35 and -51 in the TVC-1 cohort. 
For the evaluation of specific high-risk (oncogenic) types, persistent infection overcomes the possible 
confounding effect of multiple infections in CIN lesions. Statistically significant vaccine efficacy against 
6-month persistent infection was observed for HPV types -31, -33 and -45 in the ATP cohort and for 
HPV types -31, -33, -45 and -51 in the TVC-1 cohort. Vaccine efficacy against 6-month persistent 
infection with specific oncogenic HPV types is consistent with the efficacy against clinical endpoints and 
strengthens the data package. However, to better support this claim the MAH was requested to provide 
all available evidence that 6-month and 12-month persistent infections due to HPV 16/18 as well as 
non-HPV16/18 types are surrogate markers that are equivalent to CIN2+ lesions in predicting cervical 
cancer. 
Furthermore the CHMP requested an ad hoc expert meeting on HPV vaccines to address the relevance 
of persistent infection as surrogate markers for cervical cancer. The meeting took place on 3 December 
2009 and addressed the CHMP list of questions reaching the below conclusions. 
Data for HPV vaccines demonstrate the appropriateness of using HPV 16/18 persistent infection as a 
surrogate endpoint to show efficacy of a given vaccine. Persistent infection can be used as a surrogate 
endpoint for cervical cancer for the non-vaccine HPV types, provided that high efficacy estimates 
against persistent infection are obtained. Furthermore persistent infection can be used to replace 
CIN2+ as a primary efficacy endpoint for the individual non-vaccine types. However, the clinical 
endpoint CIN2+ should continue to be followed as a secondary endpoint. Persistent infection predicts 
clinical benefit irrespective of duration of persistence, i.e. 6-, 12- or 18-months. 
Additional data provided by the MAH (see table 7) shows that HPV 31 is the only non-vaccine HPV type 
for which robust and consistent cross-protection has been demonstrated, i.e. in all study populations 
and for all endpoints (CIN 2/3, 6M PI and 12M PI). 
For the other relevant non-vaccine HPV types inconsistent results were seen, as detailed below: 
For HPV 33, only cross-protection against 6M PI reached statistical significance in all study populations 
However, VE against 6M PI (45.7%) in the ATP cohort cannot be considered high, which was a 
provision for acceptance of this endpoint as concluded by the Ad Hoc Expert HPV Group meeting (see 
conclusions above). Moreover, no efficacy against CIN 2/3 (primary endpoint evaluated first in the 
hierarchical approach) and 12M PI could be shown in the ATP analysis. The ATP cohort represents the 
primary efficacy population and it is also the only population for which the efficacy results of non-
vaccine HPV types are presented in the SmPC. 
With respect to HPV 51, only in the CIN 2/3 endpoint statistically significant cross-protection across all 
study populations was obtained, whereas for 6M PI a non-significant result was obtained in the primary 
efficacy population. The modest cross-protection effect for HPV 51 can be questioned since the 96.1% 
CIs for 6 Month PI and 12 Month PI were very wide in all study populations. The reliability of the 
results observed for this non-vaccine HPV type is questioned. 
With respect to HPV 45 and 58 no convincing cross-protection has been demonstrated based on the 
data provided.

Furthermore, the CHMP requested the MAH to address the long term efficacy and the concern of 
possible type replacement. In response the MAH has proposed to perform a collaboration with HPA to 
complement study HPV-27. 
HPV-27 study is designed to evaluate the long-term impact of Cervarix on the occurrence of cervical 
cancers and precancerous lesions (CIN3+) using a passive, cancer registry-based follow-up. Subjects 
enrolled in the HPV-027 are those who participated in the HPV-008 study, enrolled from Finland. In 
addition, a parallel cohort of unvaccinated subjects was enrolled at the same time of the HPV-008 
subjects. Since the sample size is limited this study will not allow the assessment of type replacement. 
Collaboration with HPA: the HPA’s Centre for Infections has developed a two-phase national HPV 
surveillance program to evaluate the impact of the routine HPV vaccination with Cervarix introduced in 
the UK in September 2008 for girls aged 12-13 years along with a catch-up programme targeted to 
girls aged up to 17 years. The HPA protocol was submitted within this application. Phase 1 (2009-
2014) is primarily focused on HPV infection surveillance, Phase 2 (2015 onwards), which is still under 
development, will shift the focus on HPV disease surveillance. The HPA has agreed to provide their HPV 
surveillance report to the MAH and the MAH has committed to provide reports to the CHMP every two 
years under confidentiality. See letter of undertaking. 
The CHMP agrees with the MAH proposal to have a mixed approach of clinical trial follow-up and health 
authority follow-up of mass vaccinated cohorts. See letter of undertaking. 
During the procedure the MAH has provided a reanalysis of the data and background for the changes 
for the final HPV008 data results. The CHMP agreed that the study conclusions remained unchanged 
after this reanalysis. 
Based on the data submitted, on the conclusions of the ad hoc expert meeting and further to the MAH 
commitment to perform the above mentioned studies monitoring long-term duration of cross-
protection against CIN 2/3 and cancer, as well as type replacement the CHMP endorsed the update of 
the product information as detailed in section 3.7. 
3.3.  Immunogenicity 
3.3.1.  Data sets analysed 
Analysis of immunogenicity was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity (primary analysis) 
and the Total Vaccinated Cohort. Analysis of antibody kinetics was performed on subjects in the ATP 
cohort for immunogenicity who had an ELISA/PBNA result available at all timepoints. At the final 
analysis, only results from the anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 ELISA and Pseudovirion-Based 
Neutralisation Assay (PBNA) (neutralising antibodies) testing were available. No data were available for 
the monoclonal inhibition enzyme immunoassays (V5/J4-monoclonal antibodies). The anti-hepatitis A 
ELISA will only be performed at the end of the study. 
3.3.2.  Results 
Immune response to natural infection measured by ELISA (Total Vaccinated Cohort)

immunological clearance of infection are presented in Table 12. The calculation of Geometric Mean

Titer (GMT)s was performed on subjects who were seropositive for HPV-16 or HPV-18 at Month 0 and 
who were HPV DNA negative for the antigen considered (i.e. who had successfully “cleared” the 
infection and mounted an immune response). Selection of this population was considered to be the 
most relevant to indicate GMTs that may reflect protective immune responses against natural infection. 
Subjects who had cleared HPV-16 infection had GMTs of 29.8 EL.U/ml [28.6; 31.0]. Subjects who had 
cleared HPV-18 infection had GMTs of 22.6 EL.U/ml [21.6; 23.6].

Immune response induced by vaccine 
The immunogenicity subset included a subset of subjects from study sites selected to collect blood 
samples at Months 0, 6, 7, 12, 24, 36 and 48. The ATP cohort for immunogenicity included subjects 
from this immunogenicity subset with at least one ELISA result available after completion of the full 
three-dose vaccination course (N=1,933). At the final analysis, anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 ELISA 
results were available for Months 0, 6, 7, 12, 24 and 36. A further subset of 100 subjects had blood 
samples taken at Months 0, 7, 12 and 24 to be tested for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 PBNA. 
The MAH has not provided within the submitted pack the immune responses at Month 48. The annex 
report is expected by the end of 2010 (FUM23).  
Anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 ELISA (ATP cohort for immunogenicity) 
The MAH has not provided within the submitted pack the immune responses at Month 48. The annex 
report is expected by the end of 2010.  
One month post Dose 3 (at Month 7), 99.5% of the subjects in the HPV group had seroconverted for 
anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies and at least 99.8 % of the subjects remained seropositive up 
to Month 36, i.e., up to 30 months after completion of the full vaccination course. 
A substantial increase (approximately 10-fold) in GMTs for both antibodies was observed from Month 6 
(post Dose 2) to Month 7 (post Dose 3). After a gradual decline from Month 7 through Month 24, GMTs 
reached a plateau between Month 24 and Month 36. 
Overall, the immune responses after vaccination were comparable for subjects initially seronegative or 
seropositive for HPV-16. At Month 7, GMTs were higher in initially seronegative subjects, but at Month 
12 GMTs were comparable between subjects initially seronegative and initially seropositive for HPV-16. 
For HPV-18, the immune responses were similar between subjects initially seronegative for HPV-18 
and subjects initially seropositive for HPV-18 at all assessed timepoints. Similar immune responses 
Page 22/27
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were also observed between subjects initially seronegative for both antigens and subjects initially 
seropositive for either antigen. 
3.3.3.  Discussion 
The interpretation of the low GMT values observed in the immune response to natural infection in 
comparison with the values observed in subjects vaccinated remains unclear since there is no 
recognised serological correlate for clinical protection. 
The immune responses data at Month 48 are waited. The annex report is expected by the end of 2010 
(FUM23).  
3.4.  Clinical safety 
At the time of the final analysis, a total of eight non-serious adverse events (AEs) leading to premature 
discontinuation of the study were reported, of which five in the HPV group and three in the HAV group. 
At the time of the final analysis, 17 deaths were reported (9 in the HPV group, 8 in the HAV group). 
None of the fatal events was assessed as possibly related to vaccination. 
At the time of final analysis, 1724 serious adverse events (SAE) were reported in 1400 subjects (701 
in HPV group, 699 in HAV group). The number of doses followed by one or more SAEs and the number 
of events experienced were similar between the two groups. The most common non-fatal SAE under 
the SOC of infections and infestations was appendicitis (0.4% in the HPV group, 0.5% in the HAV 
group). 
Overall, medically significant conditions were reported in a similar percentage of subjects in the HPV 
and HAV groups: 31.8% and 32.4%, respectively. The percentage of subjects reporting medically 
significant conditions classified by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Primary 
System Organ Class and Preferred Term during the entire follow-up period is presented in the clinical 
study report. 
The most common medically significant conditions were gynaecological Chlamydia infection, genito-
urinary tract gonococcal infection and depression, all of which were reported in similar percentages of 
subjects in the HPV and HAV groups: 
•   Gynaecological chlamydia infection was reported in 911 (9.8%) subjects in the HPV group and 957 
(10.3%) subjects in the HAV group. 
•   Genito-urinary tract gonococcal infection was reported in 144 (1.5%) subjects in the HPV group 
and 162 (1.7%) subjects in the HAV group. 
•   Depression was reported in 142 (1.5%) subjects in the HPV group and 137 (1.5%) subjects in the 
HAV group. 
The MAH noted that the high incidence of gynaecological chlamydia infection and genito-urinary tract 
gonococcal infection was expected as Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrheae testing was 
included in the study procedures on a yearly basis. 
Page 23/27
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the number of subjects experiencing a new onset of chronic diseases (NOCD) was similar in 
the HPV and HAV groups: 251 (2.7%) and 268 (2.9%) subjects, respectively. 
The most common NOCDs were asthma, urticaria, hypersensitivity, hypothyroidism and seasonal 
allergy, all of which were reported with a similarly low incidence in both groups. Other events were 
reported at an incidence of 0.1% subjects or lower in either group. 
Overall, the number of subjects experiencing an new onset autoimmune diseases (NAOD) was similar 
in the HPV and HAV groups: 78 (0.8%) and 77 (0.8%) subjects, respectively. 
During the entire follow-up period, 3606 pregnancies were reported (1804 in the HPV group and 1802 
in the HAV group) for 3091 subjects (1538 in the HPV group and 1553 in the HAV group). During the 
entire follow-up period, no major differences in the rates of any specific pregnancy outcome were 
observed between the HPV and HAV groups. 
In conclusion, no clinically meaningful differences in overall safety outcomes have been identified and 
compliance with the full vaccination course was equally high between treatment groups. 
Furthermore, the cumulative safety data accounted for in the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 
(period covered 18.05.2008 to 17.11.2008) provided information about the most frequently reported 
postmarketing adverse events. The MAH will continue to monitor hypersensitivity reactions including 
anaphylaxis, other allergic reactions (e.g. angio-oedema) and vasovagal syncope. The CHMP endorsed 
an Opinion in October 2009 to update section 4.4 of the SmPC to include a warning on syncope and to 
update section 4.8 of the SmPC to include allergic reactions (including anaphylactic and anaphylactoid 
reactions), angioedema and syncope or vasovagal responses to injection, sometimes accompanied by 
tonic-clonic movements.

3.6.  Overall discussion and benefit-risk assessment 
The prophylactic efficacy of Cervarix in female adolescents and young adult women is confirmed by the 
longer follow-up (approximately 39 months) and the generation of more robust efficacy data in the 
final analysis of study HPV-008. 
Cervarix has demonstrated a level of efficacy beyond the vaccine types HPV-16 and HPV-18. 
Statistically significant efficacy was observed against CIN2+ associated with high-risk types combined, 
excluding HPV-16 and HPV-18 in the ATP cohort and in the TVC-1 cohort. Statistically significant 
vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ was observed for HPV types -31, -51 and -58 in the ATP cohort and for 
HPV types -31, -33, -35 and -51 in the TVC-1 cohort. Vaccine efficacy against 6 and 12 month 
persistent infection with specific oncogenic HPV types is consistent with the efficacy against clinical 
endpoints. However, HPV 31 is the only non-vaccine HPV type for which robust and consistent cross-
protection has been demonstrated, i.e. in all study populations and for all endpoints. 
The ad hoc expert meeting on HPV vaccines requested by the CHMP to address the relevance of 
persistent infection as surrogate markers for cervical cancer acknowledged the appropriateness of 
using persistent infection as a surrogate endpoint to show efficacy of a given vaccine. 
Although persistent infection is acknowledged as a surrogate marker, the CHMP considered that it has 
not by itself a direct clinically meaningful objective for physicians and women. Therefore, it should not 
be mentioned in the indication. This should rather be mentioned in section 5.1. 
The CHMP agrees with the MAH proposal to address long term efficacy and the concern of possible type 
replacement to have a mixed approach of clinical trial follow-up and health authority follow-up of mass 
vaccinated cohorts. See letter of undertaking. 
The immune responses data at Month 48 are waited by the end of 2010 (FUM23).  
No clinically meaningful differences in overall safety outcomes have been identified between treatment 
groups. 
Based on the data submitted, on the conclusions of the ad hoc expert meeting and further to the MAH 
commitment to perform the above mentioned studies monitoring long-term duration of cross-
Page 25/27
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
protection against CIN 2/3 and cancer, as well as type replacement the CHMP agreed with the update 
of the product information as detailed below. 
3.7.  Changes to the product information 
Further to the assessment of the different proposals of the MAH to amend the Product Information and 
in the light of the assessment of the submitted data, the Product Information was revised as follows: 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
Section 4.1 “Therapeutic indication”  
The MAH’s applied to include persistent infection in the indication, based on the final analysis of study 
HPV-008.  
The CHMP considered that the wording of the indication should only mention the events which are, by 
themselves, direct clinically meaningful objectives of the vaccination for physicians and women. 
Therefore the indication should mention cancer as the major objective (demonstrated through 
surrogates) and lesions clinical surrogates (they are of direct clinical relevance because they lead to 
surgical resection). 
Persistent infection is acknowledged as a surrogate, but it has not by itself a direct clinically meaningful 
objective for physicians and women. Therefore, should not be mentioned in the indication. This should 
rather be mentioned in section 5.1. 
Furthermore the CHMP took the opportunity of this variation to revise the indication to be harmonised 
between the HPV vaccines and the vaccine HPV types were replaced by “certain oncogenic HPV types” 
since for these vaccines some cross protection against related non-vaccine HPV types have been 
demonstrated. The CHMP included the word “certain” to make prescribers aware that the vaccine does 
not protect against all HPV oncogenic types. The information on the different HPV types is covered by a 
cross reference to section 5.1 where these data are presented. Further to cross reference to section 
5.1 a cross reference to section 4.4 was added for important information on the data that support this 
indication.  
Therefore the first paragraph of the indication was revised as follows: 
“Cervarix is a vaccine for the prevention of premalignant cervical lesions and cervical cancer causally 
related to certain oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types. See sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important 
information on the data that support this indication.” 
Section 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions for use”  
A sentence was introduced at the beginning of this section to alert prescribers that the decision to 
vaccinate an individual woman should take into account her risk for previous HPV exposure and her 
potential benefit from vaccination. Furthermore this section was fully revised to be in line with the 
other HPV vaccines. 
Section 4.6 “Pregnancy and lactation” 
The number of pregnancies in the clinical development program was updated. 
Page 26/27
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Section 5.1 “Pharmacodynamic properties”  
This section was updated with the final results and data on cross protection was included. Furthermore 
this section was fully revised to be harmonised with the other HPV vaccines. 
Package Leaflet 
Section 1 of the package leaflet was updated accordingly. 
Annex II 
Annex II was updated with the updated version 5 of the risk management plan. 
4.  Conclusion 
On 24 June 2010 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet.

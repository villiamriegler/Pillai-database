2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion (at the designation stage) 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2012 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to be 
affecting 2.2 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time the application was made; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to the consequences of its clinical presentation, 
including cutaneous tumours, ulcerations, and erythroderma. The condition is life threatening in 
the most aggressive forms and also due to the risk of further malignant transformation; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, sufficient justification has been provided that brentuximab vedotin may be of significant 
benefit to those affected by the condition. This appears justified in particular with regards to a 
potential clinically relevant advantage based on the new mechanism of action which will improve 
the treatment options of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. This is supported by preclinical 
and clinical data.  
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
extension of indication 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The applicant submitted this variation in order to extend the already existing indication.  
Current indications: 
•  ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD30+ 
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL): 
1. 
following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) or 
2. 
following at least two prior therapies when ASCT or multi-agent chemotherapy is not a treatment 
option. 
• 
• 
- ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CD30+ HL at increased risk of 
relapse or progression following ASCT . 
- ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory systemic 
anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL). 
Final proposed extension indication: 
“ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma 
(CTCL) after at least 1 prior systemic therapy” 
The COMP has considered several times that CTCL is a distinct medical entity. Cutaneous T-cell 
lymphoma refers to a heterogeneous group of primary cutaneous lymphomas, the most common type 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/977/2018 
Page 4/9 
 
 
 
of which is mycosis fungoides. The WHO-EORTC classification of 2005 (Willemze May 15, 2005; Blood: 
105; 10) describes two groups, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) and cutaneous B-cell lymphomas 
(CBCLs) as forming the primary cutaneous lymphoma group.  In the classification of tumours of 
haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues (Swerdlow 2016, Blood 127:20), the distinct types of primary 
cutaneous lymphomas are described separately with different codes, under the category of Mature T-
cell and NK-cell neoplasms. In the 2013 ESMO treatment guidelines for primary cutaneous lymphomas, 
the WHO-EORTC classification is followed and the group of CTCL is presented as a separate entity 
(Willemze et al, Oncol 2013; 24 (Suppl 6): vi149-vi154).  
The proposed  therapeutic indication “ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) after at least 1 prior systemic therapy” falls entirely within 
the scope of the designated orphan indication which is designated in broader terms as “treatment of 
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Based on the CHMP assessment, the intention to treat, prevent or diagnose the condition has been 
justified. Please refer to the EPAR of Adcetris. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The applicant asserted that no change has been reported in the chronically debilitating or life-
threatening nature of the condition since the orphan designation was granted on 11th January 2012. 
The condition is chronically debilitating due to manifestations such as cutaneous tumours, ulcerations, 
and erythroderma. The condition is life threatening in the most aggressive forms, also due to the risk 
of further malignant transformation. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
A point prevalence estimate was calculated from incidence, multiplied by the duration of the condition: 
• 
The duration of the condition was conservatively considered to be approximately 20 years, on the 
basis of the median survival estimated to be 18.3 years among mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary 
syndrome (SS) cases, which represent the most common CTCL types.  
•  Data from all member states were considered for the purpose of identifying the incidence. The 
highest reported figure was approximately 0.1 per 10,000 incidence. This refers to an 
approximation of a  reported rate of 0.084 for Germany, which was in turn calculated on the basis 
of German registry RKI data (for T-cell lymphoma) and SEER registry data (for a ratio referring to 
CTCL)  
Based on these two figures, 20 years duration and 0.1 per 10,000 incidence,  the COMP considered 
that the prevalence would be approximately 2 per 10,000 people at the time of review.

Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
As per the 2013 ESMO clinical practice guidelines (Willemza et al, Annals of Oncology 24 (Supplement 
6): vi149–vi154, 2013), the choice of treatment varies greatly, depending on the type of primary 
cutaneous lymphoma and the stage of disease. The two most common types are discussed below from 
these guidelines: 
•  With regards to Mycosis fungoides, patients with only patches and/or plaques covering <10% 
(stage IA) or ≥10% of the skin surface (stage IB) should be treated with skin-directed therapies, 
including topical steroids, psoralens + ultraviolet A (PUVA), narrow-band ultraviolet B (UVB) and 
topical cytostatic agents, such as mechlorethamine or carmustine (BCNU). For patients with more 
extensive infiltrated plaques and tumours or patients refractory to skin-directed therapies, a 
combination of PUVA and interferon alpha or PUVA and retinoids (including bexarotene), a 
combination of interferon alpha and retinoids or total skin electron beam irradiation can be 
considered. In patients with advanced and refractory disease, gemcitabine or liposomal doxorubicin 
may be considered (ESMO guidelines, Ann Oncol 2013; 24 (Suppl 6): vi149-vi154). 
• 
For Sezary syndrome, systemic treatment is required. Skin-directed therapies like PUVA or potent 
topical steroids may be used as adjuvant therapy. Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), either alone 
or in combination with other treatment modalities such as interferon alpha, retinoids, total skin 
electron beam and PUVA, has been suggested as the treatment of choice in SS and erythrodermic 
MF (ESMO guidelines Ann Oncol 2013; 24 (Suppl 6): vi149-vi154). 
Several products are authorised in the EU for the condition, either for CTCL specifically or for broader 
indications. The applicant has identified bexarotene, chlormethine, bleomycin, chlorambucil, 
cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, methotrexate, lomustine, mitoxantrone, interferon 
alpha, vinblastine and, vincristine. In addition to this list the COMP has also previously considered 
fluocinonide, betamethasone, clobetasol, carmustine, mechlorethamine, methylprednisolone, and 
triamcinolone to be authorised for the condition. 
Significant benefit 
The MA is mainly supported by the phase 3 study ALCANZA. ALCANZA was an open-label, randomised, 
multicentre study of brentuximab vedotin versus conventional therapy for previously treated patients 
with CD30-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with CD30-positive 
mycosis fungoides who had received at least one previous systemic therapy, or adult patients with 
CD30-positive pcALCL who had received at least one previous systemic therapy or radiotherapy were 
enrolled. 
Patients received either intravenous brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg once every 3 weeks, for up to 16 
3-week cycles; or physician's choice of oral methotrexate 5–50 mg once per week, for up to 48 weeks, 
or oral bexarotene 300 mg/m2 once per day, for up to 48 weeks, until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an objective global response lasting 
(from first to last response) at least 4 months, assessed by an independent review facility. Key 
secondary endpoints were proportion of patients achieving a complete response, progression-free

The COMP considered the controls (physician’s choice) in the study to be reflecting the standard of 
care and accepted the improved efficacy versus Methotrexate and Bexarotene as confirmation of 
significant benefit over those two authorised products. The COMP further discussed significant benefit 
versus interferon-A. As regards the justification of significant benefit versus interferon, the sponsor 
elaborated on the population included, and efficacy of the ALCANZA study, and proceeded with an 
indirect comparison versus published bibliography studies for IFN-α in CTCL and the SmPC of Roferon-
a (interferon-α).  
There were two comparisons put forward versus interferon alpha: a) a comparison of the ORR rate 
from Alcanza versus the ORR rate from the Roferon-A “summary of product characteristics” which 
numerically supports a clinically relevant advantage and b) a comparison of the median time to next 
treatment analysis (TNTT) versus an analysis of Hughes and co-workers (Blood 2015;125(1):71-81.) 
This was a  retrospective analysis of a cutaneous lymphoma database with 198 MF/SS patients 
undergoing systemic therapies. The primary end point was time to next treatment (TTNT) and this was 
reported to be approximately 9 months (8.7 months). With reference to that analysis, the applicant 
reported that brentuximab vedotin had a longer TTNT based on the ALCANZA results (14.3 months).

With regards to the effects of Brentuximab in patients of the ALCANZA trial who were previously 
treated patients with interferon-a, the sponsor clarified that 26 patients in the Adcetris arm and 28 
patients in the phycisian’s choice arm (bexarotene or methotrexate) had previously received 
interferon. In those patients ORR was reported to be 54% and 7% respectively. The COMP considered 
that such observations are relevant for the confirmation of a clinically relevant advantage in patients 
that had received interferon-α and subsequently progressed. 
It was therefore concluded that the available clinical data support durable clinical responses compared 
to standard of care, in patients who had previously received at least one prior therapy, including 
patients who had received interferon-α. This was considered a clinically relevant advantage.

4.  COMP position adopted on 7 December 2017 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 2 in 10,000 
persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria;  
the condition is chronically debilitating due to the consequences of its clinical presentation, 
including cutaneous tumours, ulcerations, and erythroderma. The condition is life threatening in 
the most aggressive forms and also due to the risk of further malignant transformation; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the assumption that Adcetris may be of potential significant benefit to those affected by the 
orphan condition still holds. The available clinical data support durable clinical responses compared 
to standard of care, in patients who had previously received at least one prior therapy, including 
patients who had received interferon-α. The committee considered that this constitutes a clinically 
relevant advantage. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Adcetris, brentuximab vedotin, 
EU/3/11/939 for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is not removed from the Community 
Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

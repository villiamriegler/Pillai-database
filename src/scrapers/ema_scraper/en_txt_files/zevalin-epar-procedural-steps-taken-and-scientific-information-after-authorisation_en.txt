At the end of study SAG 304820,  the surviving  patients 
entered study SAG 307722  for five years. Of the 204 
patients receiving Y-90 Zevalin following first line 
chemotherapy, 26 (12.7%) patients in the Zevalin arm 
developed a second  primary malignancy compared  to 14 
(6.8%) of patients in the control arm. Seven patients 
(3.4%, 7/204) were diagnosed with MDS/AML after 
receiving Zevalin, compared to one patient (0.5%, 1/205) 
in the control  arm, with a median follow-up of 7.3 years. 
Deaths due to second  primary malignancy included  8 
(3.9%) patients in the Zevalin arm compared to 3 (1.5%) 
patients in the control arm.  Deaths due to MDS/AML 
included five (2.5%) patients in the Zevalin arm compared 
to no patients in the control arm.

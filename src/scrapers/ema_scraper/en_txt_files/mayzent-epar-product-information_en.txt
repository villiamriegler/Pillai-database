CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Mayzent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis 
(SPMS) with active disease evidenced by relapses or imaging features of inflammatory activity (see 
section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with siponimod should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the 
management of multiple sclerosis. 
Before initiation of treatment, patients must be genotyped for CYP2C9 to determine their CYP2C9 
metaboliser status (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2). 
In patients with a CYP2C9*3*3 genotype, siponimod should not be used (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 
5.2). 
Posology 
Treatment initiation 
Treatment has to be started with a titration pack that lasts for 5 days. Treatment starts with 0.25 mg 
once daily on days 1 and 2, followed by once-daily doses of 0.5 mg on day 3, 0.75 mg on day 4, and 
1.25 mg on day 5, to reach the patient’s prescribed maintenance dose of siponimod starting on day 6 
(see Table 1). 
During the first 6 days of treatment initiation the recommended daily dose should be taken once daily 
in the morning with or without food.

TITRATION 
MAINTENANCE 
In patients with CYP2C9*2*3 or *1*3 genotype, the recommended maintenance dose is 1 mg 
taken once daily (1 x 1 mg or 4 x 0.25 mg) (see above and sections 4.4 and 5.2). Additional 
exposure of 0.25 mg on day 5 does not compromise patient safety. 
Treatment maintenance 
In patients with a CYP2C9*2*3 or *1*3 genotype, the recommended maintenance dose is 1 mg (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
The recommended maintenance dose of siponimod in all other CYP2C9 genotype patients is 2 mg. 
Mayzent is taken once daily. 
Missed dose(s) during treatment initiation 
During the first 6 days of treatment, if a titration dose is missed on one day treatment needs to be 
re-initiated with a new titration pack.

Missed dose after day 6 
If a dose is missed, the prescribed dose should be taken at the next scheduled time; the next dose 
should not be doubled. 
Re-initiation of maintenance therapy after treatment interruption 
If maintenance treatment is interrupted for 4 or more consecutive daily doses, siponimod needs to be 
re-initiated with a new titration pack. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Siponimod has not been studied in patients aged 65 years and above. Clinical studies included patients 
up to the age of 61 years. Siponimod should be used with caution in the elderly due to insufficient data 
on safety and efficacy (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
Based on clinical pharmacology studies, no dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal 
impairment (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Siponimod must not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) (see 
section 4.3). Although no dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment, caution should be exercised when initiating treatment in these patients (see sections 4.4 
and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of siponimod in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not yet been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. Siponimod is taken with or without food. 
The film-coated tablets should be swallowed whole with water.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Infections 
Risk of infections 
A core pharmacodynamic effect of siponimod is a dose-dependent reduction of the peripheral 
lymphocyte count to 20-30% of baseline values. This is due to the reversible sequestration of 
lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues (see section 5.1). 
The immune system effects of siponimod may increase the risk of infections (see section 4.8). 
Before initiating treatment, a recent complete blood count (CBC) (i.e. within last 6 months or after 
discontinuation of prior therapy) should be available. Assessments of CBC are also recommended 3 to 
4 months after treatment initiation and at least yearly thereafter, and in case of signs of infection. 
Absolute lymphocyte counts <0.2 x 109/l, if confirmed, should lead to dose reduction to 1 mg, because 
in clinical studies siponimod dose was reduced in patients with absolute lymphocyte counts 
<0.2 x 109/l. Confirmed absolute lymphocyte counts <0.2 x 109/l in a patient already receiving 
siponimod 1 mg should lead to interruption of siponimod therapy until the level reaches 0.6 x 109/l 
when re-initiation of siponimod can be considered. 
Initiation of treatment should be delayed in patients with severe active infection until resolution. 
Because residual pharmacodynamic effects, such as lowering effects on peripheral lymphocyte count, 
may persist for up to 3 to 4 weeks after discontinuation, vigilance for infection should be continued 
throughout this period (see below section “Stopping siponimod therapy”). 
Patients should be instructed to report symptoms of infection to their physician promptly. Effective 
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies should be employed in patients with symptoms of infection while 
on therapy. Suspension of treatment with siponimod should be considered if a patient develops a 
serious infection. 
Cases of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) have been reported for siponimod. Patients with symptoms and 
signs consistent with CM should undergo prompt diagnostic evaluation. Siponimod treatment should 
be suspended until CM has been excluded. If CM is diagnosed, appropriate treatment should be 
initiated. 
Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported for S1P receptor 
modulators, including siponimod, and other therapies for multiple sclerosis (see section 4.8). 
Physicians should be vigilant for clinical symptoms or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings 
that may be suggestive of PML. If PML is suspected, siponimod treatment should be suspended until 
PML has been excluded. If PML is confirmed, treatment with siponimod should be discontinued. 
Herpes viral infection 
Cases of herpes viral infection (including cases of meningitis or meningoencephalitis caused by 
varicella zoster viruses [VZV]) have occurred with siponimod at any time during treatment. If herpes 
meningitis or meningoencephalitis occur, siponimod should be discontinued and appropriate treatment 
for the respective infection should be administered. Patients without a physician-confirmed history of 
varicella or without documentation of a full course of vaccination against VZV should be tested for 
antibodies to VZV before starting siponimod (see below section “Vaccination”). 
Vaccination 
A full course of vaccination with varicella vaccine is recommended for antibody-negative patients 
prior to commencing treatment with siponimod, following which initiation of treatment should be 
postponed for 1 month to allow the full effect of vaccination to occur (see section 4.8). 
The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided while patients are taking siponimod and for 
4 weeks after stopping treatment (see section 4.5). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other types of vaccines may be less effective if administered during siponimod treatment (see 
section 4.5). Discontinuation of treatment 1 week prior to planned vaccination until 4 weeks after is 
recommended. If stopping siponimod therapy for vaccination, the possible return of disease activity 
should be considered (see below section “Stopping siponimod therapy”). 
Concomitant treatment with anti-neoplastic, immune-modulating or immunosuppressive therapies 
Anti-neoplastic, immune-modulating or immunosuppressive therapies (including corticosteroids) 
should be co-administered with caution due to the risk of additive immune system effects during such 
therapy (see section 4.5). 
Macular oedema 
Macular oedema with or without visual symptoms was more frequently reported on siponimod (1.8%) 
than on placebo (0.2%) in the phase III clinical study (see section 4.8). The majority of cases occurred 
within the first 3-4 months of therapy. An ophthalmological evaluation is therefore recommended 
3-4 months after treatment initiation. As cases of macular oedema have also occurred on longer-term 
treatment, patients should report visual disturbances at any time while on siponimod therapy and an 
evaluation of the fundus, including the macula, is recommended. 
Siponimod therapy should not be initiated in patients with macular oedema until resolution. 
Siponimod should be used with caution in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus, uveitis or 
underlying/co-existing retinal disease due to a potential increase in the risk of macular oedema (see 
section 4.8). It is recommended that these patients should undergo an ophthalmological evaluation 
prior to initiating therapy and regularly while receiving siponimod therapy to detect macular oedema. 
Continuation of siponimod therapy in patients with macular oedema has not been evaluated. It is 
recommended that siponimod be discontinued if a patient develops macular oedema. A decision on 
whether or not siponimod should be re-initiated after resolution needs to take into account the 
potential benefits and risks for the individual patient. 
Bradyarrhythmia 
Initiation of siponimod treatment results in a transient decrease in heart rate and may also be 
associated with atrioventricular conduction delays (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). A titration scheme to 
reach the maintenance dose on day 6 is therefore applied at the start of treatment (see section 4.2). 
After the first titration dose, the heart rate decrease starts within one hour and the day 1 decline is 
maximal at approximately 3 to 4 hours. With continued up-titration, further heart rate decreases are 
seen on subsequent days, with maximal decrease from day 1 (baseline) reached on day 5 to 6. The 
highest daily post-dose decrease in absolute hourly mean heart rate is observed on day 1, with the 
pulse declining on average 5 to 6 beats per minute (bpm). Post-dose declines on the following days are 
less pronounced. With continued dosing heart rate starts increasing after day 6 and reaches placebo 
levels within 10 days after treatment initiation. 
Heart rates below 40 bpm were rarely observed. The atrioventricular conduction delays manifested in 
most of the cases as first-degree atrioventricular (AV) blocks (prolonged PR interval on 
electrocardiogram). In clinical studies, second-degree AV blocks, usually Mobitz type I 
(Wenckebach), have been observed in less than 1.7% of patients at the time of treatment initiation. 
Most of the bradyarrhythmic events or atrioventricular conduction delays were asymptomatic, 
transient and resolved within 24 hours and did not require discontinuation of treatment. Should post-
dose symptoms occur (dizziness, non-cardiac chest pain and headache), appropriate clinical 
management should be initiated and monitoring should be continued until the symptoms have 
resolved. If necessary, the decrease in heart rate induced by siponimod can be reversed by parenteral 
doses of atropine or isoprenaline.

Treatment initiation recommendation in patients with certain pre-existing cardiac conditions 
As a precautionary measure, patients with the following cardiac conditions should be observed for a 
period of 6 hours after the first dose of siponimod for signs and symptoms of bradycardia (see also 
section 4.3): 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In these patients, it is recommended that an electrocardiogram (ECG) is obtained prior to dosing and at 
the end of the observation period. If post-dose bradyarrhythmia or conduction-related symptoms occur 
or if ECG 6 hours post-dose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block or QTc ≥500 msec, 
appropriate management should be initiated and observation continued until the symptoms/findings 
have resolved. If pharmacological treatment is required, monitoring should be continued overnight and 
6-hour monitoring should be repeated after the second dose. 
history of symptomatic bradycardia or recurrent syncope, 
uncontrolled hypertension, or 
severe untreated sleep apnoea. 
Due to the risk of serious cardiac rhythm disturbances or significant bradycardia, siponimod should 
not be used in patients with: 
- 
- 
- 
In such patients, treatment with siponimod should be considered only if the anticipated benefits 
outweigh the potential risks, and advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of 
treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy. 
A thorough QT study demonstrated no significant direct QT-prolonging effect and siponimod is not 
associated with an arrhythmogenic potential related to QT prolongation. Initiation of treatment may 
result in decreased heart rate and indirect prolongation of the QT interval during the titration phase. 
Siponimod was not studied in patients with significant QT prolongation (QTc >500 msec) or who 
were treated with QT-prolonging medicinal products. If treatment with siponimod is considered in 
patients with pre-existing significant QT prolongation or who are already being treated with 
QT-prolonging medicinal products with known arrhythmogenic properties, advice from a cardiologist 
should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring 
strategy during treatment initiation. 
Siponimod has not been studied in patients with arrhythmias requiring treatment with class Ia (e.g. 
quinidine, procainamide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medicinal products. 
Class Ia and class III antiarrhythmic medicinal products have been associated with cases of torsades de 
pointes in patients with bradycardia. Since initiation of treatment results in decreased heart rate, 
siponimod should not be used concomitantly with these medicinal products during treatment initiation. 
Experience is limited in patients receiving concurrent therapy with heart-rate-lowering calcium 
channel blockers (such as verapamil or diltiazem) or other substances that may decrease heart rate 
(e.g. ivabradine or digoxin) as these medicinal products were not studied in patients receiving 
siponimod in clinical studies. Concomitant use of these substances during treatment initiation may be 
associated with severe bradycardia and heart block. Because of the potential additive effect on heart 
rate, treatment with siponimod should generally not be initiated in patients who are concurrently 
treated with these substances (see section 4.5). In such patients, treatment with siponimod should be 
considered only if the anticipated benefits outweigh the potential risks. 
If concomitant treatment with one of the above substances is considered during initiation of treatment 
with siponimod, advice from a cardiologist should be sought regarding the switch to a 
non-heart-rate-lowering medicinal product or appropriate monitoring for treatment initiation. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bradyarrhythmic effects are more pronounced when siponimod is added to beta-blocker therapy. For 
patients receiving a stable dose of beta blocker, the resting heart rate should be considered before 
introducing treatment. If the resting heart rate is >50 bpm under chronic beta-blocker treatment, 
siponimod can be introduced. If resting heart rate is ≤50 bpm, then beta-blocker treatment should be 
interrupted until the baseline heart rate is >50 bpm. Treatment with siponimod can then be initiated 
and treatment with beta blocker can be re-initiated after siponimod has been up-titrated to the target 
maintenance dose (see section 4.5). 
Liver function 
Recent (i.e. within last 6 months) transaminase and bilirubin levels should be available before 
initiation of treatment with siponimod. 
In the phase III clinical study, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was observed in 5.6% of patients treated with siponimod 
2 mg compared to 1.5% of patients who received placebo (see section 4.8). In clinical studies 
treatment was discontinued if the elevation exceeded a 3-fold increase and the patient showed 
symptoms related to hepatic function or if the elevation exceeded a 5-fold increase. In the phase III 
clinical study, 1% of all discontinuations met one of these criteria. 
Patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction should have liver enzymes checked 
and siponimod should be discontinued if significant liver injury is confirmed. Resumption of therapy 
will be dependent on whether or not another cause of liver injury is determined and on the benefits to 
the patient of resuming therapy versus the risks of recurrence of liver dysfunction. 
Although there are no data to establish that patients with pre-existing liver disease are at increased risk 
of developing elevated liver function test values when taking siponimod, caution should be exercised 
in patients with a history of significant liver disease. 
Cutaneous neoplasms 
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and other cutaneous neoplasms, including squamous cell carcinoma 
(SCC), have been reported in patients receiving siponimod, especially in patients with longer 
treatment duration (see section 4.8). 
Skin examination is recommended for all patients at treatment initiation, and then every 6 to12 months 
taking into consideration clinical judgement. Careful skin examinations should be maintained with 
longer treatment duration. Patients should be advised to promptly report any suspicious skin lesions to 
their physician. Patients treated with siponimod should be cautioned against exposure to sunlight 
without protection. These patients should not receive concomitant phototherapy with UV-B radiation 
or PUVA-photochemotherapy. 
Unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms/signs 
Rare cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) have been reported for another 
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator. Such events have not been reported for siponimod 
in the development programme. However, should a patient on siponimod treatment develop any 
unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms/signs (e.g. cognitive deficits, behavioural changes, 
cortical visual disturbances or any other neurological cortical symptoms/signs or any symptom/sign 
suggestive of an increase in intracranial pressure) or accelerated neurological deterioration, a complete 
physical and neurological examination should promptly be scheduled and MRI should be considered. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Prior treatment with immunosuppressive or immune-modulating therapies 
When switching from other disease-modifying therapies, the half-life and mode of action of the other 
therapy must be considered to avoid an additive immune effect whilst at the same time minimising the 
risk of disease reactivation. A peripheral lymphocyte count (CBC) is recommended prior to initiating 
siponimod to ensure that immune effects of the previous therapy (i.e. cytopenia) have resolved. 
Due to the characteristics and duration of alemtuzumab immune suppressive effects described in its 
product information, initiating treatment with siponimod after alemtuzumab is not recommended. 
Siponimod can generally be started immediately after discontinuation of beta interferon or glatiramer 
acetate. 
Blood pressure effects 
Patients with hypertension uncontrolled by medicinal products were excluded from participation in 
clinical studies and special care is indicated if patients with uncontrolled hypertension are treated with 
siponimod. 
Hypertension was more frequently reported in patients on siponimod (12.6%) than in those given 
placebo (9.0%) in the phase III clinical study in patients with SPMS. Treatment with siponimod 
resulted in an increase of systolic and diastolic blood pressure starting early after treatment initiation, 
reaching maximum effect after approximately 6 months of treatment (systolic 3 mmHg, diastolic 
1.2 mmHg) and staying stable thereafter. The effect persisted with continued treatment. 
Blood pressure should be regularly monitored during treatment with siponimod. 
CYP2C9 genotype 
Before initiation of treatment with siponimod, patients should be genotyped for CYP2C9 to determine 
their CYP2C9 metaboliser status (see section 4.2). Patients homozygous for CYP2C9*3 
(CYP2C9*3*3 genotype: approximately 0.3 to 0.4% of the population) should not be treated with 
siponimod. Use of siponimod in these patients results in substantially elevated siponimod plasma 
levels. The recommended maintenance dose is 1 mg daily in patients with a CYP2C9*2*3 genotype 
(1.4-1.7% of the population) and in patients with a *1*3 genotype (9-12% of the population) to avoid 
increased exposure to siponimod (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Women of childbearing potential 
Due to risk for the foetus, siponimod is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of 
childbearing potential not using effective contraception. Before initiation of treatment, women of 
childbearing potential must be informed of this risk to the foetus, must have a negative pregnancy test 
and must use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 10 days after treatment 
discontinuation (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). 
Stopping siponimod therapy 
Severe exacerbation of disease, including disease rebound, has been rarely reported after 
discontinuation of another S1P receptor modulator. The possibility of severe exacerbation of disease 
after stopping siponimod treatment should be considered. Patients should be observed for relevant 
signs of possible severe exacerbation or return of high disease activity upon siponimod discontinuation 
and appropriate treatment should be instituted as required. 
After siponimod therapy has been stopped, siponimod remains in the blood for up to 10 days. Starting 
other therapies during this interval will result in concomitant exposure to siponimod. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the vast majority (90%) of SPMS patients, lymphocyte counts return to the normal range within 
10 days of stopping therapy. However, residual pharmacodynamic effects, such as lowering effects on 
peripheral lymphocyte count, may persist for up to 3-4 weeks after the last dose. Use of 
immunosuppressants within this period may lead to an additive effect on the immune system and 
therefore caution should be exercised for 3 to 4 weeks after the last dose. 
Interference with haematological testing 
Since siponimod reduces blood lymphocyte counts via re-distribution in secondary lymphoid organs, 
peripheral blood lymphocyte counts cannot be utilised to evaluate the lymphocyte subset status of a 
patient treated with siponimod. Laboratory tests involving the use of circulating mononuclear cells 
require larger blood volumes due to reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes. 
Excipients 
The tablets contain soya lecithin. Patients who are hypersensitive to peanut or soya should not take 
siponimod (see section 4.3). 
The tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Antineoplastic, immune-modulating or immunosuppressive therapies 
Siponimod has not been studied in combination with antineoplastic, immune-modulating or 
immunosuppressive therapies. Caution should be exercised during concomitant administration due to 
the risk of additive immune effects during such therapy and in the weeks after administration of any of 
these medicinal products is stopped (see section 4.4). 
Due to the characteristics and duration of alemtuzumab immune suppressive effects described in its 
product information, initiating treatment with siponimod after alemtuzmab is not recommended unless 
the benefits of treatment clearly outweigh the risks for the individual patient (see section 4.4). 
Anti-arrhythmic medicinal products, QT-prolonging medicinal products, medicinal products that may 
decrease heart rate 
During treatment initiation siponimod should not be concomitantly used in patients receiving class Ia 
(e.g. quinidine, procainamide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol) anti-arrhythmic medicinal 
products, QT-prolonging medicinal products with known arrhythmogenic properties, 
heart-rate-lowering calcium channel blockers (such as verapamil or diltiazem) or other substances that 
may decrease heart rate (e.g. ivabradine or digoxin) because of the potential additive effects on heart 
rate (see section 4.4). No data are available for concomitant use of these medicinal products with 
siponimod. Concomitant use of these substances during treatment initiation may be associated with 
severe bradycardia and heart block. Because of the potential additive effect on heart rate, treatment 
with siponimod should generally not be initiated in patients who are concurrently treated with these 
substances (see section 4.4). If treatment with siponimod is considered, advice from a cardiologist 
should be sought regarding the switch to non-heart-rate-lowering medicinal products or appropriate 
monitoring for treatment initiation. 
Beta blockers 
Caution should be exercised when siponimod is initiated in patients receiving beta blockers due to the 
additive effects on lowering heart rate (see section 4.4). Beta-blocker treatment can be initiated in 
patients receiving stable doses of siponimod. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The negative chronotropic effect of co-administration of siponimod and propranolol was evaluated in 
a dedicated pharmacodynamic/safety study. The addition of propranolol on top of siponimod 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic steady state had less pronounced negative chronotropic effects 
(less than additive) in comparison to addition of siponimod on top of propranolol 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic steady state (additive HR effect). 
Vaccination 
The use of live attenuated vaccines may carry the risk of infection and should therefore be avoided 
during siponimod treatment and for up to 4 weeks after treatment (see section 4.4). 
During and for up to 4 weeks after treatment with siponimod vaccinations may be less effective. The 
efficacy of vaccination is not considered to be compromised if siponimod treatment is paused 1 week 
prior to vaccination until 4 weeks after vaccination. In a dedicated phase I healthy volunteer study, 
concomitant siponimod treatment with influenza vaccines or shorter treatment pause (from 10 days 
prior to 14 days after vaccination) showed inferior responder rates (approximately 15% to 30% lower) 
compared to placebo, while the efficacy of a PPV 23 vaccination was not compromised by 
concomitant siponimod treatment (see section 4.4). 
Potential of other medicinal products to affect siponimod pharmacokinetics 
Siponimod is metabolised primarily by cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) (79.3%) and to a lesser 
extent by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (18.5%). CYP2C9 is a polymorphic enzyme and the 
drug-drug interaction (DDI) effect in the presence of CYP3A or CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers is 
predicted to be dependent on the CYP2C9 genotype. 
CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Because of a significant increase in exposure to siponimod, concomitant use of siponimod and 
medicinal products that cause moderate CYP2C9 and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibition is not 
recommended. This concomitant drug regimen can consist of a moderate CYP2C9/CYP3A4 dual 
inhibitor (e.g. fluconazole) or a moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor in combination with a separate moderate 
or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. 
The co-administration of fluconazole (moderate CYP2C9/CYP3A4 dual inhibitor) 200 mg daily at 
steady state and a single dose of siponimod 4 mg in healthy volunteers with a CYP2C9*1*1 genotype 
led to a 2-fold increase in the area under the curve (AUC) of siponimod. According to evaluation of 
the drug interaction potential using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling, a 
maximum of a 2-fold increase in the AUC of siponimod is predicted across genotypes with any type of 
CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 inhibitors except for patients with a CYP2C9*2*2 genotype. In CYP2C9*2*2 
patients, a 2.7-fold increase in the AUC of siponimod is expected in the presence of moderate 
CYP2C9/CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inducers 
Siponimod may be combined with most types of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inducers. However, because 
of an expected reduction in siponimod exposure, the appropriateness and possible benefit of the 
treatment should be considered when siponimod is combined: 
- 
with strong CYP3A4/moderate CYP2C9 dual inducers (e.g. carbamazepine) or a moderate 
CYP2C9 inducer in combination with a separate strong CYP3A4 inducer in all patients 
regardless of genotype. 
with moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. modafinil) or strong CYP3A4 inducers in patients with a 
CYP2C9*1*3 or *2*3 genotype. 
- 
A significant reduction of siponimod exposure (by up to 76% and 51%, respectively) is expected 
under these conditions according to evaluation of the drug interaction potential using PBPK 
modelling. The co-administration of siponimod 2 mg daily in the presence of 600 mg daily doses of 
rifampin (strong CYP3A4 and moderate CYP2C9 inducer) decreased siponimod AUCtau,ss and Cmax,ss 
by 57% and 45%, respectively, in CY2C9*1*1 subjects. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Oral contraceptives 
Co-administration with siponimod did not reveal clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics 
and pharmacodynamics of the combined ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel oral contraceptive. 
Therefore the efficacy of the investigated oral contraceptive was maintained under siponimod 
treatment. 
No interaction studies have been performed with oral contraceptives containing other progestagens, 
however an effect of siponimod on the efficacy of oral contraceptives is not expected. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females 
Siponimod is contraindicated in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception 
(see section 4.3). Therefore, before initiation of treatment in women of childbearing potential a 
negative pregnancy test result must be available and counselling should be provided regarding serious 
risk to the foetus. Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment 
and for at least ten days following the last dose of siponimod (see section 4.4). 
Specific measures are also included in the Physician Education Pack. These measures must be 
implemented before siponimod is prescribed to female patients and during treatment. 
When stopping siponimod therapy for planning a pregnancy, the possible return of disease activity 
should be considered (see section 4.4). 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data available from the use of siponimod in pregnant women. 
Animal studies have demonstrated siponimod-induced embryotoxicity and foetotoxicity in rats and 
rabbits and teratogenicity in rats, including embryo-foetal deaths and skeletal or visceral 
malformations at exposure levels comparable to the human exposure at the daily dose of 2 mg (see 
section 5.3). In addition, clinical experience with another sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator 
indicated a 2-fold higher risk of major congenital malformations when administered during pregnancy 
compared with the rate observed in the general population. 
Consequently, siponimod is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). Siponimod should be 
stopped at least 10 days before a pregnancy is planned (see section 4.4). If a woman becomes pregnant 
while on treatment, siponimod must be discontinued. Medical advice should be given regarding the 
risk of harmful effects to the foetus associated with treatment and ultrasonography examinations 
should be performed. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether siponimod or its major metabolites are excreted in human milk. Siponimod and 
its metabolites are excreted in the milk of rats. Siponimod should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
The effect of siponimod on human fertility has not been evaluated. Siponimod had no effect on male 
reproductive organs in rats and monkeys or on fertility parameters in rats.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Siponimod has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, dizziness 
may occasionally occur when initiating therapy with siponimod. Therefore, patients should not drive 
or use machines during the first day of treatment initiation with siponimod (see section 4.4). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse drug reactions are headache (15%) and hypertension (12.6%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Within each system organ class, the adverse drug reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most 
frequent reactions first. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse drug 
reaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 000); not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infections 
In the phase III clinical study in patients with SPMS the overall rate of infections was comparable 
between the patients on siponimod and those on placebo (49.0% versus 49.1%, respectively). 
However, an increase in the rate of herpes zoster infections was reported on siponimod (2.5%) 
compared to placebo (0.7%). 
Cases of meningitis or meningoencephalitis caused by varicella zoster viruses have occurred with 
siponimod at any time during treatment. Cases of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) have also been 
reported for siponimod (see section 4.4). 
Macular oedema 
Macular oedema was more frequently reported in patients receiving siponimod (1.8%) than in those 
given placebo (0.2%). Although the majority of cases occurred within 3 to 4 months of commencing 
siponimod, cases were also reported in patients treated with siponimod for more than 6 months (see 
section 4.4). Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were 
asymptomatic and diagnosed on routine ophthalmological examination. The macular oedema 
generally improved or resolved spontaneously after discontinuation of treatment. The risk of 
recurrence after re-challenge has not been evaluated. 
Bradyarrhythmia 
Initiation of siponimod treatment results in a transient decrease in heart rate and may also be 
associated with atrioventricular conduction delays (see section 4.4). Bradycardia was reported in 6.2% 
of patients treated with siponimod compared to 3.1% on placebo and AV block in 1.7% of patients 
treated with siponimod compared to 0.7% on placebo (see section 4.4). 
The maximum decline in heart rate is seen in the first 6 hours post-dose. 
A transient, dose-dependent decrease in heart rate was observed during the initial dosing phase and 
plateaued at doses ≥5 mg. Bradyarrhythmic events (AV blocks and sinus pauses) were detected with a 
higher incidence under siponimod treatment compared to placebo. 
Most AV blocks and sinus pauses occurred above the therapeutic dose of 2 mg, with notably higher 
incidence under non-titrated conditions compared to dose titration conditions. 
The decrease in heart rate induced by siponimod can be reversed by atropine or isoprenaline. 
Liver function tests 
Increased hepatic enzymes (mostly ALT elevation) have been reported in MS patients treated with 
siponimod. In the phase III study in patients with SPMS, liver function test increases were more 
frequently observed in patients on siponimod (11.3%) than in those on placebo (3.1%), mainly due to 
liver transaminase (ALT/AST) and GGT elevations. The majority of elevations occurred within 
6 months of starting treatment. ALT levels returned to normal within approximately 1 month after 
discontinuation of siponimod (see section 4.4). 
Blood pressure 
Hypertension was more frequently reported in patients on siponimod (12.6%) than in those given 
placebo (9.0%) in the phase III clinical study in patients with SPMS. Treatment with siponimod 
resulted in an increase of systolic and diastolic blood pressure starting early after treatment initiation, 
reaching maximum effect after approximately 6 months of treatment (systolic 3 mmHg, diastolic 
1.2 mmHg) and staying stable thereafter. The effect persisted with continued treatment. 
Seizures 
Seizures were reported in 1.7% of patients treated with siponimod compared to 0.4% on placebo in the 
phase III clinical study in patients with SPMS. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Respiratory effects 
Minor reductions in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and in the diffusing capacity of the 
lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) values were observed with siponimod treatment. At months 3 and 
6 of treatment in the phase III clinical study in patients with SPMS, mean changes from baseline in 
FEV1 in the siponimod group were -0.1 L at each time point, with no change in the placebo group. 
These observations were slightly higher (approximately 0.15 L mean change from baseline in FEV1) in 
patients with respiratory disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma 
treated with siponimod. On chronic treatment, this reduction did not translate into clinically significant 
adverse events and was not associated with an increase in reports of cough or dyspnoea (see 
section 5.1). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In healthy subjects, the single maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 25 mg based upon the 
occurrence of symptomatic bradycardia after single doses of 75 mg. A few subjects received 
unintended doses of up to 200 mg daily for 3 to 4 days and experienced asymptomatic mild to 
moderate transient elevations of liver function tests. 
One patient (with a history of depression) who took 84 mg siponimod experienced a slight elevation in 
liver transaminases. 
If the overdose constitutes first exposure to siponimod or occurs during the dose titration phase of 
siponimod it is important to observe for signs and symptoms of bradycardia, which could include 
overnight monitoring. Regular measurements of pulse rate and blood pressure are required and 
electrocardiograms should be performed (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
There is no specific antidote to siponimod available. Neither dialysis nor plasma exchange would 
result in meaningful removal of siponimod from the body. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: 
L04AA42 
Mechanism of action 
Siponimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator. Siponimod binds selectively to 
two out of five G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for S1P, namely S1P1 and S1P5. By acting as a 
functional antagonist on S1P1 receptors on lymphocytes, siponimod prevents egress from lymph 
nodes. This reduces the recirculation of T cells into the central nervous system (CNS) to limit central 
inflammation. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Reduction of the peripheral blood lymphocytes 
Siponimod induces a dose-dependent reduction of the peripheral blood lymphocyte count within 
6 hours of the first dose, due to the reversible sequestration of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues. 
With continued daily dosing, the lymphocyte count continues to decrease, reaching a nadir median 
(90% CI) lymphocyte count of approximately 0.560 (0.271-1.08) cells/nL in a typical CYP2C9*1*1 or 
*1*2 non-Japanese SPMS patient, corresponding to 20-30% of baseline. Low lymphocyte counts are 
maintained with daily dosing. 
In the vast majority (90%) of SPMS patients, lymphocyte counts return to the normal range within 
10 days of stopping therapy. After stopping siponimod treatment residual lowering effects on 
peripheral lymphocyte count may persist for up to 3-4 weeks after the last dose. 
Heart rate and rhythm 
Siponimod causes a transient reduction in heart rate and atrioventricular conduction on treatment 
initiation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8), which is mechanistically related to the activation of 
G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels via S1P1 receptor stimulation 
leading to cellular hyperpolarisation and reduced excitability. Due to its functional antagonism at S1P1 
receptors, initial titration of siponimod successively desensitises GIRK channels until the maintenance 
dose is reached. 
Potential to prolong the QT interval 
The effects of therapeutic (2 mg) and supratherapeutic (10 mg) doses of siponimod on cardiac 
repolarisation were investigated in a thorough QT study. The results did not suggest an 
arrhythmogenic potential related to QT prolongation with siponimod. Siponimod increased the 
placebo-corrected baseline-adjusted mean QTcF (ΔΔQTcF) by more than 5 ms, with a maximum 
mean effect of 7.8 ms (2 mg) and 7.2 ms (10 mg), respectively, at 3 h post-dose. The upper bound of 
the one-sided 95% CI for the ΔΔQTcF at all time points remained below 10 ms. Categorical analysis 
revealed no treatment-emergent QTc values above 480 ms, no QTc increases from baseline of more 
than 60 ms and no corrected or uncorrected QT/QTc value exceeded 500 ms. 
Pulmonary function 
Siponimod treatment with single or multiple doses for 28 days is not associated with clinically 
relevant increases in airway resistance as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 
and forced expiratory flow (FEF) during expiration of 25 to 75% of the forced vital capacity 
(FEF25-75%). A slight trend of reduced FEV1 was detected at non-therapeutic single doses (>10 mg). 
Multiple doses of siponimod were associated with mild to moderate changes in FEV1 and FEF25-75% 
which were not dose- and daytime-dependent and were not associated with any clinical signs of 
increased airway resistance. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of siponimod has been investigated in a phase III study evaluating once-daily doses of 
2 mg in patients with SPMS. 
Study A2304 (EXPAND) in SPMS 
Study A2304 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event and follow-up duration 
driven, phase III study in patients with SPMS who had documented evidence of progression in the 
prior 2 years in the absence or independent of relapses, no evidence of relapse in the 3 months prior to 
study enrolment and with a median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 3.0 to 6.5 at 
study entry. The median EDSS was 6.0 at baseline. Patients above 61 years of age were not included. 
With regard to disease activity, features characteristic of inflammatory activity in SPMS can be 
relapse- or imaging-related (i.e. Gd-enhancing T1 lesions or active [new or enlarging] T2 lesions). 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive either once-daily siponimod 2 mg or placebo. Clinical 
evaluations were performed at screening and every 3 months and at the time of relapse. MRI 
evaluations were performed at screening and every 12 months. 
The primary endpoint of the study was the time to 3-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) 
determined as at least a 1-point increase from baseline in EDSS (0.5 point increase for patients with 
baseline EDSS of 5.5 or more) sustained for 3 months. Key secondary endpoints were time to 3-month 
confirmed worsening of at least 20% from baseline in the timed 25-foot walk test (T25W) and change 
from baseline in T2 lesion volume. Additional secondary endpoints included time to 6-month CDP, 
percent brain volume change and measures of inflammatory disease activity (annualised relapse rate, 
MRI lesions). Change in cognitive processing speed on Symbol Digit Modality Test score was an 
exploratory endpoint. 
Study duration was variable for individual patients (median study duration was 21 months, 
range: 1 day to 37 months). 
The study involved randomisation of 1 651 patients to either siponimod 2 mg (N=1 105) or placebo 
(N=546); 82% of patients treated with siponimod and 78% of placebo-treated patients completed the 
study. Median age was 49 years, median disease duration was 16 years and median EDSS score was 
6.0 at baseline. 64% of patients had no relapses in the 2 years prior to study entry and 76% had no 
gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions on their baseline MRI scan. 78% of patients had been previously 
treated with a therapy for their MS. 
Time to onset of 3-month and 6-month CDP was significantly delayed for siponimod, with reduction 
in risk of 3-month CDP by 21% compared to placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79, p=0.0134) and 
reduction in risk of 6-month CDP by 26% compared to placebo (HR 0.74, p=0.0058).

Results from the study showed a variable but consistent risk reduction in the time to 3- and 6-month 
CDP with siponimod compared to placebo in subgroups defined based on gender, age, pre-study 
relapse activity, baseline MRI disease activity, disease duration and disability levels at baseline. 
In the subgroup of patients (n=779) with active disease (defined as patients with relapse in the 2 years 
prior to the study and/or presence of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions at baseline) the baseline characteristics 
were similar to the overall population. Median age was 47 years, median disease duration was 15 years 
and median EDSS score at baseline was 6.0. 
18 
 
 
 
 
Time to onset of 3-month and 6-month CDP was significantly delayed in siponimod-treated patients 
with active disease, by 31% compared to placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.69; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.91) and by 
37% compared to placebo (HR 0.63; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.86), respectively. The ARR (confirmed relapses) 
was reduced by 46% (ARR ratio 0.54; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.77) compared to placebo. The relative rate 
reduction of cumulative number of Gd-enhancing T1 weighted lesions over 24 months was 85% (rate 
ratio 0.155; 95% CI: 0.104, 0.231) compared to placebo. The differences in T2 lesion volume change 
and in percentage of brain volume change (average over months 12 and 24) compared to placebo 
were -1 163 mm3 (95% CI: -1 484, -843 mm3) and 0.141% (95% CI: 0.020, 0.261%), respectively.

In the subgroup of patients (n=827) without signs and symptoms of disease activity (defined as 
patients without relapse in the 2 years prior to the study and without presence of Gd-enhancing T1 
lesions at baseline), effects on 3-month and 6-month CDP were small (risk reductions were 7% and 
13%, respectively). 
A post-hoc analysis of study A2304 (EXPAND) showed that siponimod delayed progression to 
EDSS ≥7.0 (sustained until end of study, i.e. time to wheelchair), resulting in a risk reduction of 38% 
(HR from Cox model 0.62; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.92). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of percentage of patients 
progressed to EDSS ≥7.0 at month 24 was 6.97% in the siponimod group and 8.72% in the placebo 
group. In the subgroup of patients with active SPMS, the risk reduction was 51% (HR 0.49; 95% CI: 
0.27, 0.90) and the Kaplan-Meier estimates at month 24 were 6.51% in the siponimod group and 
8.69% in the placebo group. As these results were exploratory in nature, they should be interpreted 
with caution. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
siponimod in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of multiple sclerosis 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The time (Tmax) to reach maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) after multiple oral administration of 
siponimod is about 4 hours (range: 2 to 12 hours). Siponimod absorption is extensive (≥70%, based on 
the amount of radioactivity excreted in urine and the amount of metabolites in faeces extrapolated to 
infinity). The absolute oral bioavailability of siponimod is approximately 84%. For 2 mg siponimod 
given once daily over 10 days, a mean Cmax of 30.4 ng/ml and mean AUCtau of 558 h*ng/ml were 
observed on day 10. Steady state was reached after approximately 6 days of multiple once-daily 
administration of siponimod. 
Despite a delay in Tmax to 8 hours after a single dose, food intake had no effect on the systemic 
exposure of siponimod (Cmax and AUC), therefore siponimod may be taken without regard to meals 
(see section 4.2). 
Distribution 
Siponimod is distributed to body tissues with a moderate mean volume of distribution of 124 litres. 
The siponimod fraction found in plasma is 68% in humans. Siponimod readily crosses the blood-brain 
barrier. Protein binding of siponimod is >99.9% in healthy subjects and in patients with hepatic or 
renal impairment. 
Biotransformation 
Siponimod is extensively metabolised, mainly by cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) (79.3%), and to a 
lesser extent by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (18.5%). 
The pharmacological activity of the main metabolites M3 and M17 is not expected to contribute to the 
clinical effect and the safety of siponimod in humans. 
In vitro investigations indicated that siponimod and its major systemic metabolites M3 and M17 do 
not show any clinically relevant drug-drug interaction potential at the therapeutic dose of 2 mg once 
daily for all investigated CYP enzymes and transporters, and do not necessitate clinical investigation. 
CYP2C9 is polymorphic and the genotype influences the fractional contributions of the two oxidative 
metabolism pathways to overall elimination. PBPK modelling indicates a differential CYP2C9 
genotype-dependent inhibition and induction of CYP3A4 pathways. With decreased CYP2C9 
metabolic activity in the respective genotypes, a larger effect of the CYP3A4 perpetrators on 
siponimod exposure is anticipated (see section 4.5). 
Elimination 
An apparent systemic clearance (CL/F) of 3.11 l/h was estimated in MS patients. The apparent 
elimination half-life of siponimod is approximately 30 hours. 
Siponimod is eliminated from the systemic circulation mainly due to metabolism and subsequent 
biliary/faecal excretion. Unchanged siponimod was not detected in urine. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Linearity 
Siponimod concentration increases in an apparent dose proportional manner after multiple once-daily 
doses of siponimod 0.3 mg to 20 mg. 
Steady-state plasma concentrations are reached after approximately 6 days of once-daily dosing and 
steady-state levels are approximately 2- to 3-fold greater than after the initial dose. An up-titration 
regimen is used to reach the clinically therapeutic dose of 2 mg siponimod after 6 days and 
4 additional days of dosing are required to reach the steady-state plasma concentrations. 
Characteristics in specific groups or special populations 
CYP2C9 genotype 
The CYP2C9 genotype influences siponimod CL/F. Two population pharmacokinetic analyses 
indicated that CYP2C9*1*1 and *1*2 subjects behave as extensive metabolisers, *2*2 and *1*3 
subjects as intermediate metabolisers and *2*3 and *3*3 subjects as poor metabolisers. Compared to 
CYP2C9*1*1 subjects, individuals with the CYP2C9*2*2, *1*3, *2*3 and *3*3 genotypes have 20%, 
35-38%, 45-48% and 74% smaller CL/F values, respectively. Siponimod exposure is therefore 
approximately 25%, 61%, 91% and 284% higher in CYP2C9*2*2, *1*3, *2*3 and *3*3 subjects, 
respectively, as compared to *1*1 subjects (see Table 4) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
There are other less frequent occurring polymorphisms for CYP2C9. The pharmacokinetics of 
siponimod have not been evaluated in such subjects. Some polymorphisms such as *5, *6, *8 and *11 
are associated with decreased or loss of enzyme function. It is estimated that CYP2C9 *5, *6, *8 and 
*11 alleles have a combined frequency of approximately 10% in populations with African ancestry, 
2% in Latinos/Hispanics and <0.4% in Caucasians and Asians.

Elderly 
Results from population pharmacokinetics suggest that dose adjustment is not necessary in elderly 
patients (age 65 years and above). No patients over 61 years of age were enrolled in clinical studies. 
Siponimod should be used with caution in the elderly (see section 4.2). 
Gender 
Results from population pharmacokinetics suggest that gender-based dose adjustment is not necessary. 
Race/Ethnicity 
The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters were not different between Japanese and Caucasian 
healthy subjects, indicating absence of ethnic sensitivity on the pharmacokinetics of siponimod. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
No siponimod dose adjustments are needed in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal 
impairment. Mean siponimod half-life and Cmax (total and unbound) were comparable between 
subjects with severe renal impairment and healthy subjects. Total and unbound AUCs were only 
slightly increased (by 23 to 33%) compared to healthy subjects. The effects of end-stage renal disease 
or haemodialysis on the pharmacokinetics of siponimod have not been studied. Due to the high plasma 
protein binding (>99.9%) of siponimod, haemodialysis is not expected to alter the total and unbound 
siponimod concentration and no dose adjustments are anticipated based on these considerations. 
Hepatic impairment 
Siponimod must not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). No dose 
adjustments for siponimod are needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. The 
unbound siponimod pharmacokinetics AUC is 15% and 50% higher in subjects with moderate and 
severe hepatic impairment, respectively, in comparison with healthy subjects for the 0.25 mg single 
dose studied. The mean half-life of siponimod was unchanged in hepatic impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and monkeys, siponimod markedly affected the lymphoid 
system (lymphopenia, lymphoid atrophy and reduced antibody response), which is consistent with its 
primary pharmacological activity at S1P1 receptors (see section 5.1). 
Dose-limiting toxicities in animal species were nephrotoxicity in mice, body weight development in 
rats and adverse CNS and gastrointestinal effects in monkeys. The main target organs of toxicity in 
rodents included the lung, liver, thyroid, kidney and uterus/vagina. In monkeys, effects on muscle and 
skin were additionally observed. These toxicities developed at more than 30-fold higher systemic 
siponimod levels than the AUC-based human exposure at the maintenance dose of 2 mg/day. 
Siponimod did not exert any phototoxic or dependence potential and was not genotoxic in vitro and in 
vivo. 
Carcinogenicity 
In carcinogenicity investigations, siponimod induced lymphoma, haemangioma and 
haemangiosarcoma in mice, whereas follicular adenoma and carcinoma of the thyroid gland were 
identified in male rats. These tumour findings were either regarded as mouse-specific or attributable to 
metabolic liver adaptations in the particularly sensitive rat species and are of questionable human 
relevance. 
Fertility and reproductive toxicity 
Siponimod did not affect male and female fertility in rats up to the highest dose tested, representing an 
approximate 19-fold safety margin based on human systemic exposure (AUC) at a daily dose of 2 mg. 
The receptor affected by siponimod (sphinosine-1-phosphate receptor) is known to be involved in 
vascular formation during embryogenesis. 
In embryofoetal development studies conducted in rats and rabbits, siponimod induced embryotoxic 
effects in the absence of maternal toxicity. In both species, prenatal mortality was increased. While in 
rats a higher number of foetuses with external, skeletal and visceral malformations (e.g. cleft palate 
and misshapen clavicles, cardiomegaly and oedema) were noted, in rabbit foetuses skeletal and 
visceral variations were predominantly observed. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the prenatal and postnatal development study performed in rats, there was in increased number of 
dead (stillborn or found dead before postnatal day 4) and malformed pups (male pups with urogenital 
malformations and/or decreased anogenital distance; pups of both sexes with oedema, swollen soft 
cranium, or flexed hindlimbs). 
The exposure levels (AUC) at the respective NOAELs for embryofoetal (rats and rabbits) and 
pre/postnatal (rats) development were below the human systemic exposure (AUC) at a daily dose of 
2 mg and consequently no safety margin exists.

Potential long-term safety implications in CYP2C9 poor metabolisers: 
• 
Perform genotyping for CYP2C9 before treatment initiation to determine the siponimod 
maintenance dose. Test requires a DNA sample obtained via blood or saliva (buccal 
swab). The test identifies two variant alleles for CYP2C9: CYP2C9*2 (rs1799853, 
c.430C>T) and CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910, c.1075A>C). Both are single nucleotide 
polymorphisms. This genotyping can be done using a Sanger sequencing method or 
PCR-based assay methods. For further clarifications please refer to your local laboratory. 
Do not prescribe siponimod in patients homozygous for CYP2C9*3*3. 
Adjust the maintenance dose to 1 mg in patients with CYP2C9*2*3 or *1*3 genotypes. 
Bradyarrhythmia (including conduction defects) during treatment initiation: 
• 
Initiate treatment with a titration pack that lasts for 5 days. Start treatment with 0.25 mg 
on day 1, up-titrated to the maintenance dose of 2 mg or 1 mg on day 6 based on the 
CYP2C9 metaboliser status. 
If a titration dose is missed on one day during the first 6 days of treatment, treatment must 
be re-initiated with a new titration pack. 
If the maintenance dose is interrupted for 4 or more consecutive daily doses, treatment 
must be re-initiated with a new titration pack. 
Monitoring requirements at treatment initiation: 
Prior to initiating treatment: 
o 
Perform vitals and baseline ECG prior to the first dose of siponimod in patients 
with sinus bradycardia (heart rate [HR] <55 bpm), history of first- or 
second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or 
heart failure (patients with NYHA class I and II). 
Until 6 hours after first dose: 
o 
Observe patients with sinus bradycardia (heart rate <55 bpm), history of first- or 
second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block or a history of myocardial infarction or 
heart failure (patients with NYHA class I and II) for a period of 6 hours after the 
first dose of siponimod for signs and symptoms of bradycardia and obtain an ECG 
at the end of the 6-hour monitoring period. 
If necessary, the decrease in heart rate induced by siponimod can be reversed by 
parenteral doses of atropine or isoprenaline. 
o 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
o 
o 
• 
Extended observation (>6 hours after first dose): 
o 
If, at the 6-hour time point, the heart rate is at the lowest value following the first 
dose, extend heart rate monitoring for at least 2 more hours and until the heart rate 
increases again. 
Extend heart rate monitoring for at least overnight in a medical facility and until 
resolution of findings in patients requiring pharmacological intervention during 
monitoring at treatment initiation/re-initiation. Repeat the first-dose monitoring 
after the second dose of siponimod. 
Appropriate management should be initiated and observation continued until the 
symptoms/findings have resolved if the following events are observed: 
a. 
New onset third-degree AV block occurring at any time 
b.  Where at the 6-hour time point the ECG shows: New onset second-degree or 
higher AV block, or QTc interval ≥500 msec 
If pharmacological treatment is required, monitoring should be continued overnight 
and 6-hour monitoring should be repeated after the second dose. 
Mayzent is contraindicated in: 
• 
Patients who, in the previous 6 months, had a myocardial infarction, unstable 
angina pectoris, stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart 
failure (requiring in-patient treatment), or New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
class III/IV heart failure. 
Patients with a history of second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular (AV) 
block, third-degree AV block, sino-atrial heart block or sick sinus syndrome, if 
they do not wear a pacemaker. 
Mayzent is not recommended in: 
• 
Patients with the below conditions. Siponimod treatment should be considered in 
these patients only if the anticipated benefits outweigh the potential risks and a 
cardiologist must be consulted to determine appropriate monitoring. At least 
overnight extended monitoring is recommended.

are known to decrease the heart rate 
29 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Infections, including varicella zoster reactivation, reactivation of the other viral infections, PML 
and other rare opportunistic infections: 
• 
There is an increased risk of infections including serious infections, in patients treated 
with siponimod. 
Before initiating treatment, a recent complete blood count (CBC) (i.e. within 6 months or 
after discontinuation of prior therapy) should be available. Assessments of CBC are also 
recommended 3 to 4 months after treatment initiation and at least yearly thereafter, and in 
case of signs of infection. Absolute lymphocyte counts <0.2 x 109/l, if confirmed, should 
lead to dose reduction to 1 mg, because in clinical studies siponimod dose was reduced in 
patients with absolute lymphocyte counts <0.2 x 109/l. Confirmed absolute lymphocyte 
counts <0.2 x 109/l in a patient already receiving siponimod 1 mg should lead to 
interruption of siponimod therapy until the level reaches 0.6 x 109/l when re-initiation of 
siponimod can be considered. 
Before starting siponimod, test for antibodies to varicella zoster virus (VZV) in patients 
without a physician-confirmed history of varicella or without documentation of a full 
course of vaccination against VZV. If tested negative, vaccination is recommended and 
treatment with siponimod should be postponed for 1 month to allow the full effect of 
vaccination to occur. 
Siponimod is contraindicated in patients with immunodeficiency syndrome. 
Siponimod is contraindicated in patients with history of progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy or cryptococcal meningitis. 
Do not initiate siponimod treatment in patients with severe active infection until infection 
is resolved. 
Exercise caution when administering concomitant treatment with anti-neoplastic, 
immune-modulating or immunosuppressive therapies (including corticosteroids) due to 
the risk of additive immune system effects. 
Patients should be instructed to report signs and symptoms of infections immediately to 
their prescriber during and for up to one month after treatment with siponimod. 
Monitor patients carefully for signs and symptoms of infections during and after 
treatment with siponimod: 
• 
Prompt diagnostic evaluation should be performed in patients with symptoms and 
signs consistent with encephalitis, meningitis or meningoencephalitis; siponimod 
treatment should be suspended until exclusion; appropriate treatment of infection, 
if diagnosed, should be initiated. 
Cases of herpes viral infection (including cases of meningitis or 
meningoencephalitis caused by varicella zoster viruses) have occurred with 
siponimod at any time during treatment. 
Cases of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) have been reported for siponimod. 
Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported 
for S1P receptor modulators, including siponimod, and other therapies for multiple 
sclerosis. Physicians should be vigilant for clinical symptoms or MRI findings 
suggestive of PML. If PML is suspected, treatment with siponimod should be 
suspended until PML has been excluded. If PML is confirmed, treatment with 
siponimod should be discontinued. 
• 
• 
• 
Macular oedema: 
• 
Arrange an ophthalmological evaluation prior to initiating therapy and follow-up 
evaluations while receiving therapy in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus, uveitis 
or underlying/co-existing retinal disease. 
An ophthalmological evaluation 3-4 months after treatment initiation with siponimod is 
recommended. 
Instruct the patient to report visual disturbances at any time while on siponimod therapy. 
Do not initiate siponimod treatment in patients with macular oedema until resolution.

Reproductive toxicity: 
• 
Siponimod is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential 
not using effective contraception. Advise women of potential serious risks to the foetus if 
siponimod is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking it. 
A negative pregnancy test result is required prior to initiation of treatment in women of 
childbearing potential. 
• 
•  Women of childbearing potential should be counselled before treatment initiation and 
regularly thereafter about the serious risks of siponimod to the foetus, facilitated by the 
pregnancy-specific patient reminder card. 
•  Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
for at least 10 days following discontinuation of treatment with siponimod. 
Siponimod should be stopped at least 10 days before a pregnancy is planned. When 
stopping siponimod for planning a pregnancy the possible return of disease activity 
should be considered. 
Counsel the patient in case of inadvertent pregnancy. 
If a woman becomes pregnant while on treatment with siponimod, treatment must be 
discontinued. Pregnant women should be advised of potential serious risks to the foetus, 
and ultrasonography examinations should be performed. 
Should a pregnancy occur during treatment or within 10 days following discontinuation 
of treatment with siponimod, please report it to Novartis by calling [insert local number] 
or visiting [insert URL], irrespective of adverse outcomes observed. 
Novartis has put in place a PRegnancy outcomes Intensive Monitoring (PRIM) 
programme, which is a registry based on enhanced follow-up mechanisms to collect 
information about pregnancy in patients exposed to siponimod immediately before or 
during pregnancy and on infant outcomes 12 months post-delivery. 
Other reminders: 
• 
Perform liver function tests prior to initiating siponimod treatment. If patients develop 
symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction during treatment with siponimod, request a 
liver enzymes check. Discontinue treatment if significant liver injury is confirmed. 
Siponimod is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh 
class C). 
Be vigilant for skin malignancies while on treatment with siponimod. Perform skin 
examination prior to treatment initiation and then every 6 to 12 months taking into 
consideration clinical judgement. Careful skin examinations should be maintained with 
longer treatment duration. Patients should be referred to a dermatologist if suspicious 
lesions are detected. Caution patients against exposure to sunlight without protection. 
These patients should not receive concomitant phototherapy with UV-B radiation or 
PUVA-photochemotherapy. Siponimod is contraindicated in patients with active 
malignancies. 
Should a patient develop any unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms/signs or 
accelerated neurological deterioration, a complete physical and neurological examination 
should promptly be scheduled and MRI should be considered. 
Caution should be exercised in elderly patients with multiple co-morbidities, or advanced 
disease/disability (due to possible increased risks of, for example, infections, 
bradyarrhythmic events during treatment initiation). 
If siponimod is discontinued, the possibility of recurrence of high disease activity should 
be considered. 
Provide patients with the Patient/Caregiver Guide and Pregnancy Reminder Card for 
women of childbearing potential. 
Be familiar with the Mayzent Prescribing Information.

Patients should read the package leaflet thoroughly before starting treatment and should keep 
the package leaflet in case they need to refer to it again during treatment. 
The importance of reporting adverse reactions. 
Before starting treatment, a DNA sample via blood or saliva (buccal swab) is taken to determine 
the CYP2C9 genotype to help determine appropriate dosing of siponimod. In certain cases the 
patient may not receive treatment with siponimod due to specific CYP2C9 genotype status. 
Patients need to have chickenpox vaccination 1 month before starting siponimod treatment, if 
the patient is not protected against the virus. 
Siponimod is not recommended in patients with cardiac disease or taking concomitant 
medicines known to decrease heart rate. Patients should tell any doctor they see that they are 
being treated with siponimod. 
For patients with certain heart problems, an ECG before initiating treatment with siponimod 
will be needed. The need for observation (including an ECG monitoring) for 6 hours in a clinic 
after the first dose of siponimod on day 1, if the patient has heart problems. Information that the 
monitoring may need to extend overnight, if the patient experiences symptoms during the first 
6 hours. 
Patients should report immediately symptoms indicating low heart rate (such as dizziness, 
vertigo, nausea or palpitations) after the first dose of siponimod and during the titration period. 
Before starting treatment patients should provide a recent complete blood count. Assessments of 
CBC are also recommended 3 to 4 months after treatment initiation and at least yearly 
thereafter, and in case of signs of infection. 
The signs and symptoms of infection during, and up to one month after treatment with 
siponimod need to be reported immediately to the prescriber, including the following: 
• 
Headache accompanied by stiff neck, sensitivity to light, fever, flu-like symptoms, 
nausea, rash, shingles and/or confusion or seizures (fits) (may be symptoms of meningitis 
and/or encephalitis, caused by either a fungal or viral infection). 
Symptoms such as weakness, visual changes, or new/worsening MS symptoms (may be 
symptoms of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML]). 
• 
Patients should report any symptoms of visual impairment immediately to the prescriber during 
and for up to one month after the end of treatment with siponimod. 
Patients should call the doctor if a dose is missed during the first 6 days of treatment or for 4 or 
more consecutive days after initiating treatment with siponimod. Treatment needs to be 
reinitiated with a new titration pack. 
Liver function tests should be performed before starting treatment and repeated if there are 
symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction. 
Patients should report any unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms/signs (such as 
sudden onset of severe headache, confusion, seizures and vision changes) or accelerated 
neurological deterioration to their doctors. 
Due to the potential teratogenic risk of siponimod women of childbearing potential should: 
• 
Be informed before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter by their physician about 
siponimod serious risks to the foetus and about the contraindication in pregnant women 
and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception, facilitated by 
the Pregnancy Reminder Card. 
Have a negative pregnancy test before starting siponimod, which should be repeated at 
suitable intervals. 
Be using effective contraception during treatment and for at least 10 days after stopping 
treatment to avoid pregnancy due to the potential risk of harm to the unborn baby. 
Report immediately to the prescribing physician any (intended or unintended) pregnancy, 
during treatment and up to 10 days following discontinuation of siponimod treatment. 
• 
• 
• 
32 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
Patients should be informed about the risk of skin malignancies and the need for skin 
examinations at the start of the treatment and thereafter while on treatment with siponimod. 
Patients should be cautioned against exposure to sunlight without protection. Also, patients 
should not receive concomitant phototherapy with UV-B radiation or 
PUVA-photochemotherapy. Patients should inform their doctor immediately if they notice any 
skin nodules (e.g. shiny, pearly nodules), patches or open sores that do not heal within weeks. 
Symptoms of skin cancer may include abnormal growth or changes of skin tissue (e.g. unusual 
moles) with a change in colour, shape or size over time. 
After stopping treatment with Mayzent, patients should inform their doctor immediately if their 
disease symptoms are getting worse (e.g. weakness or visual changes) or if they notice any new 
symptoms. 
Contact details of the siponimod prescriber. 
Pregnancy Reminder Card for women of childbearing potential: 
The pregnancy-specific patient reminder card shall contain the following key messages: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Siponimod is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not 
using effective contraception. 
Doctors will provide counselling before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter regarding 
the potential teratogenic risk of siponimod and required actions to minimise this risk. 
Patients will be informed by their doctor of the need for effective contraception while on 
treatment and for 10 days after discontinuation. 
A pregnancy test must be carried out and negative results verified by the doctor before starting 
treatment. It must be repeated at suitable intervals. 
Patients must use effective contraception during the treatment with siponimod. 
• 
•  While on treatment, women must not become pregnant. If a woman becomes pregnant or wants 
to become pregnant, siponimod should be discontinued. Effective contraception should be 
maintained for at least 10 days following discontinuation of treatment with siponimod. 
Doctors will provide counselling in the event of pregnancy and evaluation of the outcome of 
any pregnancy. 
Patients should inform their doctor straight away if there is worsening of multiple sclerosis after 
stopping treatment with siponimod. 
• 
• 
•  Women exposed to siponimod during pregnancy are encouraged to join the pregnancy exposure 
programme (PRegnancy outcomes Intensive Monitoring, PRIM) that monitors outcomes of 
pregnancy. 
Should a pregnancy occur during treatment or within 10 days following discontinuation of 
treatment with siponimod, it should be immediately reported to the doctor or to Novartis by 
calling [insert local number] or visiting [insert URL], irrespective of adverse outcomes 
observed.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Mayzent is and what it is used for 
What Mayzent is 
Mayzent contains the active substance siponimod. Siponimod belongs to a group of medicines called 
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators. 
What Mayzent is used for 
Mayzent is used to treat adults with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) with active 
disease. Active disease in SPMS is when there are still relapses or when MRI (magnetic resonance 
imaging) results show signs of inflammation. 
How Mayzent works 
Mayzent helps to protect the central nervous system (CNS) from attacks by the body’s own immune 
system. It does this by: 
- 
making some white blood cells (called lymphocytes) less able to move freely within the body, 
and 
stopping these cells from reaching the brain and spinal cord. 
- 
This reduces nerve damage caused by SPMS and as a result Mayzent helps to slow down the effects of 
the disease activity (such as worsening disability, brain lesions and relapses). 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you take Mayzent 
Do not take Mayzent 
- 
if you are allergic to siponimod, peanut, soya or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
if you have an immunodeficiency syndrome. 
if you have ever had progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or cryptococcal meningitis. 
if you have an active cancer. 
if you have severe liver problems. 
if, in the last 6 months, you have had a heart attack, unstable angina, stroke or certain types of 
heart failure. 
if you have certain types of irregular or abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia) and you do not have a 
pacemaker. 
if blood tests show that your body cannot break down this medicine well enough, you should 
not take it (see “Blood tests before and during treatment” below). 
if you are pregnant or could become pregnant and are not using effective contraception. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Mayzent: 
• 
if you have an infection or if your immune system does not work properly (for example due to a 
disease or to medicines that suppress the immune system; see also “Other medicines and 
Mayzent”). 
if you have never had chickenpox and have not been vaccinated against it. You may be at 
greater risk of complications if you develop chickenpox during Mayzent treatment. Your doctor 
may want to vaccinate you against chickenpox before you start treatment. 
if you are planning to have any vaccinations. Your doctor will advise you on this (see “Other 
medicines and Mayzent”). 
if you have ever had, or have, difficulties with your vision (in particular a condition called 
macular oedema) or an infection or inflammation of the eye (uveitis). Your doctor may want 
you to have eye examinations before you start treatment and regularly while you are on 
treatment. Mayzent can cause a swelling in the macula (the area of the eye that enables you to 
see shapes, colours and details) known as macular oedema. Your chance of developing macular 
oedema is higher if you have had it before or if you have ever had uveitis (an inflammation of 
the eye). 
if you have diabetes. The chance of developing macular oedema (see above) is higher in patients 
with diabetes. 
if you have ever had any of the following conditions (even if you are receiving treatment for 
them): severe heart disease, irregular or abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia), stroke or other disease 
related to the blood vessels in the brain, a slow heart rate, fainting, disturbance of heart rhythm 
(indicated by abnormal ECG results). 
if you have severe breathing problems when sleeping (sleep apnoea). 
if you have high blood pressure that cannot be controlled by medicines. Your blood pressure 
will need to be checked regularly. 
if you have ever had liver problems. Your doctor may want to perform blood tests to check your 
liver function before prescribing Mayzent. 
if you could become pregnant, because siponimod can harm the unborn baby when used during 
pregnancy. Before you start treatment, your doctor will explain the risk and ask you to do a 
pregnancy test to ensure that you are not pregnant. You must use effective contraception during 
treatment and up to 10 days after stopping treatment (see “Pregnancy, breast-feeding and 
fertility”).

Look out for the following while taking Mayzent 
If you get any of the following while taking Mayzent, tell your doctor immediately because it could 
be serious: 
• 
if you have an infection. Mayzent lowers the number of white cells in your blood. White blood 
cells fight infection, so you may get infections more easily while you are taking Mayzent (and 
up to 3 to 4 weeks after you stop taking it). These could be serious and possibly even 
life-threatening. 
if you think your multiple sclerosis (MS) is getting worse or if you notice any new or unusual 
symptoms. A rare brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) can 
cause symptoms similar to SPMS. It can occur in patients taking medicines like Mayzent and 
other medicines used for treating MS. 
 if you have fever, feel like you have flu or have a headache together with a stiff neck, sensitivity 
to light, nausea or confusion. These may be symptoms of meningitis and/or encephalitis caused 
by a viral or fungal infection (such as cryptococcal meningitis). 
if you have changes in your vision, for example if the centre of your vision becomes blurred or 
has shadows, a blind spot develops in the centre of your vision, or you have problems seeing 
colours or fine detail. These may be symptoms of macular oedema. You may not notice any 
symptoms in the early stages of macular oedema, and it can cause some of the same visual 
symptoms as an MS attack (optic neuritis). Your doctor may want you to have an eye 
examination 3 or 4 months after starting treatment and possibly again later. If macular oedema 
is confirmed, your doctor may advise you to stop Mayzent treatment. 
if you have symptoms such as sudden onset of severe headache, confusion, seizures and vision 
changes. These may be symptoms of a condition called posterior reversible encephalopathy 
syndrome (PRES). 
if you have symptoms such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, 
yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes or abnormally dark urine. These may be symptoms 
of liver problems. 
if you notice any skin nodules (e.g. shiny, pearly nodules), patches or open sores that do not 
heal within weeks. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Slow heart rate (bradycardia) and irregular heartbeat 
During the first days of treatment, Mayzent can cause the heart rate to slow down (bradycardia). You 
may not feel anything or you may feel dizzy or tired. It may also cause your heartbeat to become 
irregular at the beginning of treatment. If anything indicates that you may be at higher risk of suffering 
from these effects, your doctor may decide to monitor you more closely at the start of treatment, refer 
you first to a heart specialist (cardiologist), or choose not to give you Mayzent. 
50 
 
 
 
 
Tests before and during treatment 
How quickly this medicine is broken down (metabolised) in the body varies from patient to patient and 
different people therefore require different doses. Your doctor will perform a blood or saliva test 
before you start treatment to determine which dose is best for you. In rare cases, the test result may 
indicate that you should not take Mayzent. 
Blood count 
• 
The desired effect of Mayzent treatment is to reduce the amount of white blood cells in your blood. 
This will usually go back to normal within 3-4 weeks of stopping treatment. If you need to have any 
blood tests, tell the doctor that you are taking Mayzent. Otherwise, it may not be possible for the 
doctor to understand the results of the test, and for certain types of blood test your doctor may need to 
take more blood than usual. 
Before you start Mayzent, your doctor will confirm whether you have enough white blood cells in 
your blood and may want to repeat a check regularly. In case you do not have enough white blood 
cells, your doctor may need to stop or reduce your Mayzent dose. 
Before the start of treatment your blood will also be tested to check how well your liver is working. 
Skin cancer 
Skin cancers have been reported in MS patients treated with Mayzent. Talk to your doctor straight 
away if you notice any skin nodules (e.g. shiny pearly nodules), patches or open sores that do not heal 
within weeks. Symptoms of skin cancer may include abnormal growth or changes of skin tissue (e.g. 
unusual moles) with a change in colour, shape or size over time. Before you start Mayzent, a skin 
examination is required to check whether you have any skin nodules. Your doctor will also carry out 
regular skin examinations during your treatment with Mayzent. If you develop problems with your 
skin, your doctor may refer you to a dermatologist, who after consultation may decide that it is 
important for you to be seen on a regular basis. 
Exposure to the sun and protection against the sun 
Mayzent weakens your immune system. This may increase your risk of developing skin cancer. You 
should limit your exposure to the sun and UV rays by: 
• 
wearing appropriate protective clothing. 
• 
regularly applying sunscreen with a high degree of UV protection. 
Worsening of MS after stopping Mayzent treatment 
Do not stop taking Mayzent or change your dose without talking to your doctor first. 
Tell your doctor straight away if you think your MS worsens after you have stopped treatment with 
Mayzent (see “If you stop taking Mayzent” in section 3). 
Elderly patients (65 years of age and above) 
There is no experience with Mayzent in elderly patients. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years of age because it has not yet 
been studied in this age group.

Other medicines and Mayzent 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Make sure to tell your doctor if you are taking or receiving any of the following medicines 
or therapies: 
• 
medicines for an irregular heartbeat, such as amiodarone, procainamide, quinidine or sotalol. 
Your doctor may decide not to prescribe Mayzent because it could intensify the effect on 
irregular heartbeat. 
medicines that slow down the heartbeat, such as diltiazem or verapamil (which belong to a 
group of medicines called calcium channel blockers), digoxin or ivabradine. Your doctor may 
refer you to a heart specialist, as your medicines may need to be changed because Mayzent may 
also slow down your heartbeat in the first days of treatment. If you are taking a beta blocker, 
such as atenolol or propranolol, your doctor may ask you to temporarily stop your beta-blocker 
treatment until you have reached your full daily dose of Mayzent. 
medicines that affect the immune system, such as chemotherapy, immunosuppressants or other 
medicines to treat MS. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking these to avoid an increased 
effect on the immune system. 
vaccines. If you need to have a vaccination, talk to your doctor first. During and for up to 
4 weeks after stopping treatment with Mayzent, you should not be given certain types of 
vaccine (called live attenuated vaccines) as they could trigger the infection that they were 
supposed to prevent (see section 2). 
fluconazole and certain other medicines can increase the levels of Mayzent in the blood and are 
not recommended to be taken in combination with Mayzent. Your doctor will advise you on 
this. 
carbamazepine and certain other medicines can lower the levels of Mayzent in your blood and 
can therefore stop it from working properly. Your doctor will advise you on this. 
modafinil and certain other medicines can lower the levels of Mayzent in the blood of certain 
patients and can therefore stop it from working properly. Your doctor will advise you on this if 
this is relevant for you. 
phototherapy with UV radiation or PUVA photochemotherapy. UV therapy during Mayzent 
treatment may increase your risk of developing skin cancer.

Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Do not use Mayzent during pregnancy, if you are trying to become pregnant or if you are a woman 
who could become pregnant and you are not using effective contraception. If Mayzent is used during 
pregnancy, there is a risk of harm to the unborn baby. If you are a woman who could become 
pregnant, your doctor will inform you about this risk before you start treatment with Mayzent and will 
ask you to do a pregnancy test in order to ensure that you are not pregnant. You must use effective 
contraception while taking Mayzent and for at least 10 days after you stop taking it to avoid becoming 
pregnant. Ask your doctor about reliable methods of contraception. 
If you do become pregnant while taking Mayzent, tell your doctor straight away. Your doctor will 
decide to stop treatment (see “If you stop taking Mayzent” in section 3). Specialised pre-natal 
monitoring will be performed. 
You should not breast-feed while you are taking Mayzent. Mayzent may pass into breast milk and 
there is a risk of serious side effects for the baby. 
Driving and using machines 
Your doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. 
Mayzent is not expected to affect your ability to drive and use machines when you are on your regular 
treatment dose. At the start of treatment you may occasionally feel dizzy. On your first day of 
treatment with Mayzent, therefore, you should not drive or use machines.

Mayzent contains lactose and soya lecithin 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. 
If you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this medicine. 
3. 
How to take Mayzent 
Treatment with Mayzent will be overseen by a doctor who is experienced in the treatment of MS. 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
How much Mayzent to take 
Starting treatment 
You will be given a titration pack, with which your dose will be gradually increased over 5 days. 
Follow the instructions on the pack (see also the “Titration pack” table). 
The purpose of the titration phase is to reduce the risk of side effects on your heart at the start of 
treatment. Your doctor may monitor you closely at the start of treatment if you are at risk of your 
heartbeat becoming slower or irregular.

On day 6, you will switch to your regular treatment dose. 
On the first 6 days of treatment, it is recommended that you take the tablets in the morning with or 
without food. 
Treatment dose 
The recommended dose is 2 mg once daily (one tablet of 2 mg Mayzent) with or without food. 
Your doctor may instruct you to take only 1 mg once daily (one tablet of Mayzent 1 mg or four tablets 
of Mayzent 0.25 mg) if the blood test performed before the start of treatment showed that your body 
breaks down Mayzent slowly (see “Tests before and during treatment”). If this applies to you, note 
that it is nevertheless safe for you to take five 0.25 mg tablets on day 5 of the titration period as 
indicated above. 
Mayzent is for oral use. Take the tablet with water. 
If you take more Mayzent than you should 
If you have taken too many Mayzent tablets, or if you take your first tablet from the treatment dose 
pack instead of the titration pack by mistake, call your doctor straight away. Your doctor may decide 
to keep you under observation.

If you forget to take Mayzent 
During the first 6 days of treatment, if you have forgotten to take your dose on one day, call your 
doctor before you take the next dose. Your doctor will need to prescribe a new titration pack. You will 
have to restart at day 1. 
If you miss a dose when you are on the regular treatment dose (day 7 onwards), take it as soon as you 
remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue as usual. Do not 
take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you forget to take Mayzent for 4 or more days in 
a row, call your doctor before you take the next dose. Your doctor will need to prescribe a new 
titration pack and you will have to restart treatment at day 1. 
If you stop taking Mayzent 
Do not stop taking Mayzent or change your dose without talking to your doctor first. 
Mayzent will stay in your body for up to 10 days after you stop taking it. Your white blood cell 
(lymphocyte) count may remain low for up to 3 to 4 weeks after you stop taking Mayzent. The side 
effects described in this leaflet may still occur during this period (see “Possible side effects” in 
section 4). 
If you have to restart Mayzent more than 4 days after you stopped taking it, your doctor will prescribe 
a new titration pack and you will have to restart treatment at day 1 again. 
Tell your doctor straight away if you think your MS worsens after you have stopped treatment with 
Mayzent. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

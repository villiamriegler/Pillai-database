CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
EXPAREL liposomal is indicated (see section 5.1): 
• 
• 
in adults as a brachial plexus block or femoral nerve block for treatment of post-operative pain.  
in adults and children aged 6 years or older as a field block for treatment of somatic post-
operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
EXPAREL liposomal should be administered in a setting where trained personnel and appropriate 
resuscitation equipment are available to promptly treat patients who show evidence of neurological or 
cardiac toxicity.  
Posology  
The recommended dose of EXPAREL liposomal in adults and children aged 6 years or older is based 
on the following factors: 
• 
• 
• 
Size of the surgical site 
Volume required to cover the area 
Individual patient factors 
A maximum dosage of 266 mg (20 mL of undiluted medicinal product) must not be exceeded.

Field block (infiltration around small- to medium-sized surgical wounds) 
• 
• 
• 
In patients undergoing bunionectomy, a total of 106 mg (8 mL) of EXPAREL liposomal was 
administered, with 7 mL infiltrated into the tissues surrounding the osteotomy and 1 mL 
infiltrated into the subcutaneous tissue. 
In patients undergoing haemorrhoidectomy, a total of 266 mg (20 mL) of EXPAREL liposomal 
was diluted with 10 mL of normal saline, for a total of 30 mL, divided into six 5 mL aliquots, 
injected by visualizing the anal sphincter as a clock face and slowly infiltrating one aliquot to 
each of the even numbers to produce a field block. 
In paediatric patients aged 6 years and older , EXPAREL liposomal should be  administered at a 
dose of 4 mg/kg (maximum not to exceed 266 mg). EXPAREL liposomal  may be either 
administered ‘as is’ or expanded with normal (0.9%) saline to increase the volume up to a final 
concentration of 0.89 mg/mL (ie, 1:14 dilution by volume). The total volume of expansion will 
be  dependent on the incision length. Examples are given is section 6.6. 
Peripheral nerve block (femoral and brachial plexus) 
• 
• 
In patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA), a total of 266 mg (20 mL) of EXPAREL 
liposomal was administered as a femoral nerve block.  
In patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty or rotator cuff repair, a total of 133 mg 
(10 mL) of EXPAREL liposomal was diluted with 10 mL of normal saline, for a total volume of 
20 mL, was administered as a brachial plexus nerve block.  
Co-administration with other local anaesthetics 
The toxic effects of local anaesthetics are additive and their co-administration, taking into account the 
dose of local anaesthetic and the extended pharmacokinetic profile of EXPAREL liposomal, should be 
used with caution including monitoring for neurologic and cardiovascular effects related to local 
anaesthetic systemic toxicity. See section 4.5. 
EXPAREL liposomal is a liposomal preparation and should not be used interchangeably with any 
other formulations of bupivacaine. Bupivacaine hydrochloride (immediate release formulations) and 
EXPAREL liposomal may be administered simultaneously in the same syringe as long as the ratio of 
the milligram dose of bupivacaine solution to EXPAREL liposomal does not exceed 1:2. If preparing 
admixture, the total amount of bupivacaine used (EXPAREL liposomal + bupivacaine HCl) should not 
exceed 400 mg equivalents of bupivacaine HCl in adults. For more information, see section 4.4. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients (65 years of age or older) 
Care should be taken in dose selection of EXPAREL liposomal in elderly patients because 
bupivacaine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to 
bupivacaine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is 
required; however, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out (see sections 5.1 
and 5.2).  
The risk of falls may increase for the elderly patients. 
Renal impairment 
Bupivacaine or its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of 
toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Impaired renal function should 
be considered when performing dose selection of EXPAREL liposomal (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
Bupivacaine is metabolized by the liver. No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5-6) or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score 7-9). 
There are insufficient data to recommend the use of EXPAREL liposomal in patients with severe 
(Child-Pugh score ≥10) hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
EXPAREL liposomal may be administered to paediatric patients 6 years of age and older at a dose of 
4 mg/kg (maximum not to exceed 266 mg) for use as a single-dose field block for treatment of somatic 
post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds.  
The safety and efficacy of EXPAREL liposomal have not yet been established for administration as a 
field block in children aged 1 to less than 6 years of age, nor as a nerve block in children aged 1 to less 
than 18 years of age. No data are available. 
EXPAREL liposomal should not be used in children aged less than 1 year of age because neonates and 
infants have a decreased ability to metabolize anaesthetics due to an immature hepatic system. 
Method of administration  
EXPAREL liposomal is for administration by infiltration or perineural use only.  
EXPAREL liposomal is intended for single-dose administration only. 
EXPAREL liposomal should be injected slowly (generally 1 to 2 mL per injection) with frequent 
aspiration when clinically appropriate, to check for blood and minimize the risk of inadvertent 
intravascular injection. 
EXPAREL liposomal is to be administered with a 25 gauge or larger bore needle to maintain the 
structural integrity of the liposomal bupivacaine particles. 
For instructions on the preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypersensitivity to local anaesthetic medicinal products of the amide type. 
Obstetrical paracervical block anaesthesia due to risk of foetal bradycardia or death.   
Intravascular administration. 
Intraarticular administration (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Efficacy and safety have not been established in major abdominal, vascular and thoracic surgeries. 
Local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST)  
As there is a potential risk of severe life-threatening adverse reactions associated with the 
administration of bupivacaine, any bupivacaine-containing product should be administered in a setting 
where trained personnel and equipment are available to promptly treat patients who show evidence of 
neurological or cardiac toxicity. 
Careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory (adequacy of ventilation) vital signs 
and the patient’s state of consciousness should be performed after injection of bupivacaine. 
Restlessness, anxiety, incoherent speech, light headedness, numbness and tingling of the mouth and 
lips, metallic taste, tinnitus, dizziness, blurred vision, tremors, twitching, depression, or drowsiness 
may be early warning signs of central nervous system toxicity.  
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Toxic local anaesthetic blood concentrations depress cardiac conductivity and excitability, which 
may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmia, and cardiac arrest, which can be fatal. 
In addition, toxic local anaesthetic blood concentrations depress myocardial contractility and cause 
peripheral vasodilation, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. 
Acute emergencies due to neurological or cardiovascular toxicity from local anaesthetics are generally 
related to high plasma concentrations encountered during therapeutic use of local anaesthetics or due 
to unintended intravascular injection of local anaesthetic solution (see sections 4.3 and 4.9).  
Injection of multiple doses of bupivacaine and other amide-containing products may cause significant 
increases in plasma concentrations with each repeated dose due to slow accumulation of the active 
substance or its metabolites or due to slow metabolic degradation. Tolerance to elevated blood 
concentrations varies with the status of the patient. 
Potential cases of LAST have been observed in the post-marketing setting. Although the majority with 
a recorded time to onset were observed within less than 1 hour of EXPAREL liposomal 
administration, a small number with a time to onset greater than 24 hours was reported. No correlation 
of cases of potential LAST with surgical procedure or route of administration has been found with 
EXPAREL liposomal, but redosing of EXPAREL liposomal, overdose, or concomitant use with other 
local anaesthetics may increase the risk of LAST (see section 4.5).  
Neurologic effects 
Central nervous system reactions are characterized by excitation and/or depression. Restlessness, 
anxiety, dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision, or tremors may occur, possibly proceeding to convulsions. 
However, excitation may be transient or absent, with depression being the first manifestation of an 
adverse reaction. This may quickly be followed by drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and 
respiratory arrest. Other central nervous system effects may include nausea, vomiting, chills, and 
constriction of the pupils. The incidence of convulsions associated with the use of local anaesthetics 
varies with the procedure used and the total dose administered.  
Neurologic effects following field block may include persistent anaesthesia, paraesthesias, weakness, 
and paralysis, all of which may have slow, incomplete, or no recovery. 
Cardiovascular function impairment 
Bupivacaine should also be used with caution in patients with impaired cardiovascular function 
because they may be less able to compensate for functional changes associated with the prolongation 
of atrioventricular conduction produced by these medicinal products. 
Hepatic impairment 
Bupivacaine is metabolised by the liver, so it should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic 
disease. Patients with severe hepatic disease are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma 
concentrations because of their inability to metabolise local anaesthetics normally. Increased 
monitoring for local anaesthetic systemic toxicity should be considered in subjects with moderate to 
severe hepatic disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
Only 6% of bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine. Bupivacaine metabolites are known to be 
extensively excreted by the kidney. Urinary excretion is affected by urinary perfusion and factors 
affecting urinary pH. Acidifying the urine hastens the renal elimination of local anaesthetics. Various 
pharmacokinetic parameters of local anaesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of renal 
disease, factors affecting urinary pH, and renal blood flow. Thus, the risk of toxic reactions to this 
medicinal product may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Allergic reactions 
Allergic-type reactions may rarely occur as a result of hypersensitivity to the local anaesthetic or to 
other formulation ingredients. These reactions are characterised by signs such as urticaria, pruritus, 
erythema, angioneurotic oedema (including laryngeal oedema), tachycardia, sneezing, nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness, syncope, excessive sweating, elevated temperature, and possibly anaphylactoid-
like symptoms (including severe hypotension). Cross-sensitivity among members of the amide-type 
local anaesthetic group has been reported. Allergic symptoms should be treated symptomatically.  
Chondrolysis 
Intra-articular infusions of local anaesthetics, including EXPAREL liposomal, following arthroscopic 
and other surgical procedures are contraindicated (see section 4.3). There have been post-marketing 
reports of chondrolysis in patients receiving such infusions.   
Methaemoglobinaemia 
Cases of methaemoglobinaemia have been reported in association with local anaesthetic use. Although 
all patients are at risk for methaemoglobinaemia, infants under 6 months of age and patients with 
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methaemoglobinaemia, 
cardiac or pulmonary compromise, or concurrent exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites 
(see section 4.5) are more susceptible to developing clinical manifestations of the condition. If local 
anaesthetics must be used in these patients, close monitoring for symptoms and signs of 
methaemoglobinaemia is recommended. 
Signs and symptoms of methaemoglobinaemia may occur immediately or may be delayed some hours 
after exposure and are characterized by a cyanotic skin discoloration and abnormal coloration of the 
blood. Methaemoglobin levels may continue to rise; therefore, immediate treatment is required to 
avert more serious central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse reactions, including seizures, 
coma, arrhythmias, and death. Bupivacaine should be discontinued as well as any other oxidizing 
medicinal product. Depending on the severity of the symptoms, patients may respond to supportive 
care (i.e. oxygen therapy, hydration). More severe symptoms may require treatment with methylene 
blue, exchange transfusion, or hyperbaric oxygen. 
Warnings and precautions specific to EXPAREL liposomal 
Different formulations of bupivacaine are not bioequivalent even if the milligram dosage is the same. 
Therefore, it is not possible to convert dosing from any other formulations of bupivacaine to 
EXPAREL liposomal and vice versa. No substitution with other bupivacaine containing products 
should be made. 
Caution is advised when co-administering EXPAREL liposomal and bupivacaine HCl, particularly 
when administering to highly vascular areas where higher systemic absorption is expected. Admixing 
of EXPAREL with other local anaesthetics has not been studied in children and is not recommended 
Using EXPAREL liposomal followed by other bupivacaine formulations has not been studied in 
clinical trials. However, based on the clinical situation, bupivacaine hydrochloride may be 
administered, taking into account the relevant PK profiles and individual patient considerations. As 
with all local anaesthetics, physicians need to evaluate local anaesthetic systemic toxicity risk based 
on total dose with respect to time of administration.  
EXPAREL liposomal has not been evaluated for the following uses and, therefore, is not 
recommended for these types of analgesia or routes of administration: 
• 
• 
epidural  
intrathecal 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EXPAREL liposomal is not recommended for use as a femoral nerve block if early mobilization and 
ambulation is part of the patient’s recovery plan (see section 4.7). Sensory and/or motor loss may 
occur with EXPAREL liposomal use, however, this is temporary and degree of loss and duration 
varies depending on the site of injection and dosage administered. As seen during clinical trials, any 
temporary sensory and/or motor loss may last for up to 5 days. 
Excipients with known effect 
Sodium  
This medicinal product contains 21 mg sodium per 10 mL vial and 42 mg sodium per 20 mL vial, 
equivalent to 1.1% and 2.1%, respectively, of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g 
sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Use of EXPAREL liposomal with other local anaesthetics 
The addition of local anaesthetics administered within 96 hours following administration of 
EXPAREL liposomal should take into account the total bupivacaine exposure. 
EXPAREL liposomal should be used with caution in patients receiving other local anaesthetics or 
active substances structurally related to amide-type local anaesthetics, e.g. certain anti-arrhythmics, 
such as lidocaine and mexiletine, since the systemic toxic effects are additive. 
Other bupivacaine products 
The impact on pharmacokinetic and/or physicochemical properties of EXPAREL liposomal when it is 
co-administered with bupivacaine HCl is concentration dependent. Therefore, bupivacaine HCl can be 
administered simultaneously in the same syringe as long as the ratio of the milligram dose of 
bupivacaine HCl solution to EXPAREL liposomal does not exceed 1:2. The total amount of 
bupivacaine HCl and EXPAREL liposomal being co-administered should not exceed 400 mg 
equivalents of bupivacaine HCl  in adults (see sections 4.4 and 6.6).  
Non-bupivacaine local anaesthetics 
EXPAREL liposomal should only be admixed with bupivacaine as admixing with either lidocaine, 
ropivacaine or mepivacaine has been shown to cause an immediate release of bupivacaine from the 
multivesicular liposomes of the drug delivery system. When EXPAREL liposomal is admixed with 
lidocaine, lidocaine binds to the liposomes, leading to an immediate displacement and release of 
bupivacaine. This displacement can be prevented by ensuring that EXPAREL liposomal is 
administered at least 20 minutes after administering lidocaine. There are no data to support 
administration of other local anaesthetics prior to administration of EXPAREL liposomal.  
Oxidizing medicinal products 
Patients that are administered local anaesthetics may be at increased risk of developing 
methaemoglobinamia when concurrently exposed to the following oxidizing medicinal products: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Nitrates/Nitrites - nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide 
Local anaesthetics - benzocaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine, mepivacaine, tetracaine, prilocaine, 
procaine, articaine, ropivacaine 
Antineoplastic medicinal products - cyclophosphamide, flutamide, rasburicase, isofamide, 
hydroxyurea 
Antibiotics - dapsone, sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, para-aminosalicylic acid 
Antimalarials - chloroquine, primaquine 
Anticonvulsants - phenytoin, sodium valproate, phenobarbital 
Other medicinal products - acetaminophen, metoclopramide, sulfa medicines (e,g., 
sulfasalazine), quinine 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicinal products 
When a topical antiseptic, such as povidone iodine, is applied, the site should be allowed to dry before 
EXPAREL liposomal is administered into the site. EXPAREL liposomal should not be allowed to 
come into contact with antiseptics such as povidone iodine in solution (see also section 6.2). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of bupivacaine in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). EXPAREL liposomal is not recommended 
during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.  
Breastfeeding  
Bupivacaine and its metabolite, pipecoloxylidide, are present in human milk at low levels. There is 
no available information on effects of the medicinal product in the breastfed infant or effects of the 
medicinal product on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in 
breastfed infants a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to 
discontinue/abstain from EXPAREL liposomal therapy taking into account the benefit of breast 
feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.  
Fertility 
There are no clinical data on the effects of EXPAREL liposomal on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Bupivacaine could have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be 
informed in advance that bupivacaine liposomal dispersion can cause temporary loss of sensation or 
motor function. The potential sensory and/or motor loss with EXPAREL liposomal is temporary and 
varies in degree and duration depending on the site of injection, route of administration (i.e. field 
block or nerve block) and dosage administered, and may last for up to 5 days as seen in clinical trials.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) associated with EXPAREL liposomal in clinical trials 
were dysgeusia (6.0%) and hypoaesthesia oral (6.5%). 
The most important serious adverse reactions associated with EXPAREL liposomal were systemic 
toxic reactions. Systemic toxic reactions usually present shortly after administration of bupivacaine 
but may be delayed in some cases. Severe central nervous system toxicity due to EXPAREL liposomal 
may result in convulsions (< 0.001% from post-marketing data). Severe cardiac toxicity due to 
EXPAREL liposomal may result in serious dysrhythmia (0.7% in clinical trials), serious hypotension 
(0.7% in clinical trials), and/or cardiac arrest (< 0.001% from post-marketing data).

Local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. 
It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Clinical presentation 
Rare reports of overdose with EXPAREL liposomal alone or in combination with another local 
anaesthetic have been received. Systemic toxic reactions, primarily involving the central nervous 
system and the cardiovascular system may occur following high blood concentrations of local 
anaesthetics. Approximately 30% of overdose reports were associated with adverse reactions. 
Signs and symptoms of overdose may include CNS symptoms (perioral paraesthesia, dizziness, 
dysarthria, confusion, mental obtundation, sensory and visual disturbances, and eventually 
convulsions) and cardiovascular effects (that range from hypertension and tachycardia to myocardial 
depression, hypotension, bradycardia, and asystole). 
Management of local anaesthetic overdose 
At the first sign of local anaesthetic overdose, oxygen should be administered.  
The first step in the management of convulsions, as well as hypoventilation or apnoea, consists of 
immediate attention to the maintenance of a patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation with 
oxygen and a delivery system capable of permitting immediate positive airway pressure by mask. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immediately after the institution of these ventilatory measures, the adequacy of the circulation should 
be evaluated, keeping in mind that medicinal products used to treat convulsions sometimes depress the 
circulation when administered intravenously. Should convulsions persist despite adequate respiratory 
support, and if the status of the circulation permits, small increments of an ultra-short acting 
barbiturate (such as thiopental or thiamylal) or a benzodiazepine (such as diazepam) may be 
administered intravenously. Supportive treatment of circulatory depression may require administration 
of intravenous fluids and, when appropriate, a vasopressor dictated by the clinical situation (such as 
ephedrine to enhance myocardial contractile force).  
If not treated immediately, both convulsions and cardiovascular depression can result in hypoxia, 
acidosis, bradycardia, dysrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. If cardiac arrest should occur, standard 
cardiopulmonary resuscitative measures should be instituted. 
Endotracheal intubation employing medicinal products may be indicated after initial administration of 
oxygen by mask if difficulty is encountered in the maintenance of a patent airway or if prolonged 
ventilatory support (assisted or controlled) is indicated. 
Lipid emulsion has been used to treat some cases of overdose in the post-marketing setting.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Anaesthetics, amides, ATC code: N01BB01 
Mechanism of action 
Bupivacaine is related chemically and pharmacologically to the amide-type local anaesthetics. It is a 
homologue of mepivacaine and is related chemically to lidocaine.  
Local anaesthetics block the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses presumably by 
increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve 
impulse, and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Systemic absorption of local anaesthetics produces effects on the cardiovascular and central nervous 
systems. At blood concentrations achieved with normal therapeutic doses and route of administration, 
changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular 
resistance are minimal. However, toxic local anaesthetic blood concentrations depress cardiac 
conductivity and excitability, which may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias, and 
cardiac arrest, which can be fatal. In addition, toxic local anaesthetic blood concentrations depress 
myocardial contractility and cause peripheral vasodilation, leading to decreased cardiac output and 
arterial blood pressure.  
Plasma levels of bupivacaine associated with toxicity can vary. Although concentrations of 2,000 to 
4,000 ng/mL have been reported to elicit early subjective CNS symptoms of bupivacaine toxicity, 
symptoms of toxicity have been reported at levels as low as 800 ng/mL.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Clinical studies confirming efficacy 
The efficacy of EXPAREL liposomal was evaluated in four double-blind, controlled trials involving 
703 patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain (pain intensity of ≥ 4 on a 0-10 scale). Acute pain was 
assessed for 24 hours after bunionectomy, 48 hours after total shoulder arthroplasty/rotator cuff repair 
and 72 hours after haemorrhoidectomy and total knee arthroplasty. Of the 703 patients, 352 received

EXPAREL liposomal treatment, 351 received placebo. Patients were of appropriate sex to the type of 
surgery (men/women ratio 329/374), mean age was 53.4 years (range 18-88 years [23.2% (n = 163) 
are ≥ 65 years, and 6.3% (n = 44) are ≥ 75 years (i.e. elderly)], BMI 27.9 kg/m2 (range 18.7-43.9), race 
was predominately White (82.9%). Primary endpoint for all pivotal studies was area under the curve 
(AUC) of pain intensity score. Rescue pain therapy was available in all studies and was tailored to 
surgical type and the clinical practice at the time of study conduct.

Of the 1645 patients in the EXPAREL liposomal field block and peripheral nerve block clinical 
studies, 469 patients were 65 years of age or older and 122 patients were 75 years of age or older.  
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
EXPAREL liposomal in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in postsurgical analgesia (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
The safety and pharmacokinetics of EXPAREL when used as a field block in paediatric patients aged 
6 years and older is supported by data from study 319, a Phase 3, open-label, multi-centre study to 
evaluate EXPAREL when administered via infiltration in paediatric subjects aged 12 to less than 
17 years undergoing spine surgery (Group 1, n=61) and in paediatric subjects aged 6 to less than 
12 years undergoing spine surgery or cardiac surgery (Group 2, n= 34). In Group 1, subjects were 
randomized 1:1 to receive a single dose of either EXPAREL 4 mg/kg (maximum 266 mg) or 
bupivacaine HCl 2 mg/kg (maximum 175 mg). In Group 2, all subjects received a single dose of 
EXPAREL 4 mg/kg (maximum 266 mg). The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics of EXPAREL in children 6 years and older. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
EXPAREL liposomal is bupivacaine encapsulated in the multivesicular liposomal drug delivery 
system. Upon administration, bupivacaine is slowly released from the liposomes over an extended 
period of time.  
Absorption 
Administration of EXPAREL liposomal results in detectable systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine 
through 96 hours after local infiltration and through 120 hours after nerve block. In general, peripheral 
nerve blocks have shown systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine for extended duration when compared 
to local infiltration. Systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine following administration of EXPAREL 
liposomal are not correlated with local efficacy. The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine is 
dependent upon the total dose of medicine administered, the route of administration, and the 
vascularity of the administration site. 
Descriptive statistics of pharmacokinetic parameters of representative EXPAREL liposomal doses in 
field block and peripheral nerve block in adults are provided in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively.

Distribution 
With EXPAREL liposomal, bupivacaine is released from the liposomal matrix by a complex 
mechanism involving reorganization of the barrier lipid membranes and subsequent diffusion of the 
drug over an extended period of time. After bupivacaine has been released from EXPAREL liposomal 
and is absorbed systemically, bupivacaine distribution is expected to be the same as for any 
bupivacaine HCl solution formulation. 
Bupivacaine is distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations found in highly 
perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, and brain. The rate and degree of diffusion is governed 
by the degree of plasma protein binding, the degree of ionization, and the degree of lipid solubility. 
Bupivacaine has a high protein binding capacity (95%) predominantly to α1-acid glycoprotein and 
also albumin at higher concentrations. The plasma protein binding of bupivacaine is concentration-
dependent. A hepatic extraction ratio of 0.37 has been reported for bupivacaine in the literature after 
IV administration. A volume of distribution at steady state of 73 l has been reported for bupivacaine. 
Metabolism 
Amide-type local anaesthetics, such as bupivacaine, are metabolized primarily in the liver via 
conjugation with glucuronic acid. Bupivacaine is extensively metabolised as evidenced by the minimal 
amount of parent drug in the urine. Pipecolylxylidine (PPX) is the major metabolite of bupivacaine; 
approximately 5% of bupivacaine is converted to PPX. The primary liver enzyme in formation of PPX 
was shown to be CYP3A4 using liver microsomes, although CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 may play a 
minor role. Hydroxylation of the aromatic ring is also a principle route of metabolism resulting in 
minor metabolites. It is presumed that lipid components of the liposome undergo similar metabolism 
pathway as the naturally occurring lipids.  
Elimination 
The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anaesthetics and their metabolites. Only 6% of 
bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine. Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local 
anaesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of renal disease, factors affecting urinary pH, 
and renal blood flow. Based on this knowledge, clinicians should practice caution when administering 
any local anaesthetics in patients with renal disease, including EXPAREL liposomal. From population 
pharmacokinetics models based on EXPAREL liposomal clinical studies, apparent clearance ranges 
from 22.9 L/h for wound infiltration studies to 10.6 L/h in regional analgesia, and due to the flip-flop 
kinetics it reflects the rate of absorption.

Elderly 
In population pharmacokinetic models based on nerve block and wound infiltration clinical studies, 
approximately 29% decrease in clearance was observed in elderly patients which was not considered 
clinically relevant. 
Hepatic impairment 
Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anaesthetics can be significantly altered by the 
presence of hepatic disease. A study of EXPAREL liposomal administration in patients with mild to 
moderate hepatic disease found that dosage adjustment in these patients is not required. However, 
based on what is known about amid-type local anaesthetics such as bupivacaine, clinicians should 
consider that patients with hepatic disease, especially those with severe hepatic disease, may be more 
susceptible to the potential toxicities of the amide-type local anaesthetics. 
Renal impairment 
Population PK analysis on clinical trial data for EXPAREL liposomal in nerve block settings showed 
no effect of mild or moderate renal impairment. EXPAREL liposomal was not studied in subjects with 
severe renal impairment. 
Population pharmacokinetics  
Based on the population PK analysis for peripheral nerve block, age, sex, body weight and race had no 
clinically meaningful effect on EXPAREL liposomal pharmacokinetics.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of bupivacaine have not been 
conducted. The mutagenic potential of bupivacaine has not been determined.  
Bupivacaine crosses the placenta. Bupivacaine produced developmental toxicity when administered 
subcutaneously to pregnant rats and rabbits at clinically relevant doses. An increase in embryo-foetal 
15

Incompatibilities 
This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in 
section 6.6. 
EXPAREL liposomal must not be diluted with water or other hypotonic agents as it will result in 
disruption of the liposomal particles.  
Topical antiseptics, such as povidone-iodine, demonstrated a strong interaction with EXPAREL 
liposomal when the solutions are admixed. This is due to the surface-active nature of antiseptics 
interacting with lipids. However, if topical antiseptics are applied to the skin surface and allowed to 
dry prior to local administration of EXPAREL liposomal, no interactions are expected in normal 
clinical practice. 
6.3  Shelf life 
Unopened vials: 2 years. 
After first opening 
Chemical and physical in-use stability of EXPAREL liposomal withdrawn from vials and transferred 
into polypropylene syringes has been demonstrated for 48 hours when stored in a refrigerator (2°C to 
8°C), or 6 hours when stored at room temperature (below 25°C). From a microbiological point of 
view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and 
conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and should not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C 
to 8°C unless opening has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
After dilution 
Chemical and physical in-use stability of EXPAREL liposomal when admixed with other formulations 
of bupivacaine has been demonstrated for 24 hours at room temperature (below 25°C). When admixed 
with 9 mg/mL (0.9%) sodium chloride or lactated Ringer’s solution, chemical and physical in-use 
stability has been demonstrated for 4 hours when stored in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C) and at room 
temperature (below 25°C). From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of dilution 
precludes the risk of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user.  
6.4  Special precautions for storage 
Unopened vials: Store in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C). Do not freeze.

Unopened vials may also be stored at room temperature (below 25°C) for up to 30 days. Vials should 
not be re-refrigerated.  
For storage conditions after first opening of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. 
6.5  Nature and contents of container  
10 mL or 20 mL, single-use Type I glass vials with an ethylenetetrafluoroethylene-faced grey butyl 
rubber stopper, and an aluminium/polypropylene flip-tear-up seal. 
Available in packs of 4 or 10 vials.  
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
EXPAREL liposomal vials are intended for single use only. 
EXPAREL liposomal vials should be visually inspected prior to administration. They should be gently 
inverted multiple times to re-suspend the particles in the dispersion immediately prior to withdrawal 
from the vial.  
EXPAREL liposomal should be administered with a 25 gauge or larger bore needle to maintain the 
structural integrity of the liposomal bupivacaine particles. 
EXPAREL liposomal can be administered in the ready to use dispersion or diluted to a concentration 
of up to 0.89 mg/mL (i.e. 1:14 dilution by volume) with 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride or lactated 
Ringer’s solution. 
The median infiltrated volume for spinal procedures in Study 319 (31 cm x 2 sides x 3 layers / 
1.5mL infiltrate every 1cm) was 124 mL. The median infiltrated volume for cardiac procedures in 
Study 319 (13 cm x 2 sides x 3 layers / 1.5mL infiltrate every 1cm) was 52 mL. 
Bupivacaine hydrochloride (immediate release formulations) can be administered simultaneously in 
the same syringe, as long as the ratio of the milligram dose of bupivacaine HCl solution to EXPAREL 
liposomal does not exceed 1:2. The total amount of bupivacaine HCl and EXPAREL liposomal being 
co-administered should not exceed 400 mg equivalents of bupivacaine HCl in adults. Bupivacaine 
amount in EXPAREL liposomal is expressed as the free base of bupivacaine, thus, when calculating 
the total dose of bupivacaine for coadministration, the amount of bupivacaine from EXPAREL 
liposomal should be converted to the equivalent of bupivacaine HCl by multiplying EXPAREL 
liposomal dose with a factor of 1.128. 
If preparing an admixture of EXPAREL liposomal with bupivacaine or saline or both, the order in 
which the components are combined does not matter. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What EXPAREL liposomal is and what it is used for 
EXPAREL liposomal is a local anaesthetic which contains the active ingredient bupivacaine.  
EXPAREL liposomal is used in adults to reduce pain in a specific part of the body following surgery 
(such as knee or shoulder joint surgery).  
EXPAREL liposomal is also used in adults and children aged 6 years or older to reduce pain in small- 
to medium-sized wounds following surgery.  
2.  What you need to know before you are given EXPAREL liposomal  
You must NOT be given this medicine:  
• 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to bupivacaine (or other similar local anaesthetics) or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6 of this leaflet). 
if you are pregnant and need a local anaesthetic to be injected at the top of the vagina by the 
cervix. Bupivacaine may seriously harm the unborn baby if it is used for this purpose. 
into a blood vessel or into your joints. 
Warnings and precautions  
EXPAREL liposomal should not be used in large abdominal, blood vessel and chest surgeries. 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before being given EXPAREL liposomal: 
• 
• 
if you have a heart problem; 
if you have liver or kidney problems. 
EXPAREL liposomal use may cause temporary loss of sensation or movement. You may notice a 
difference in your ability to feel things or move normally for up to 5 days after being given the 
medicine.  
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following conditions have sometimes been reported with use of other local anaesthetics: 
• 
Allergic reactions 
Allergic reactions may rarely occur after being given any local anaesthetic. Signs of allergic 
reactions to look out for include: hives or skin rash, swelling around the eyes, face, lips, mouth 
or throat, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, feeling dizzy or fainting, or fever. Seek 
urgent medical attention if you notice any of these symptoms after being given EXPAREL 
liposomal as in rare cases these reactions can become life-threatening (see also section 4 of this 
leaflet).  
• 
Neurological conditions 
Toxicity of the central nervous system can also sometimes occur. Early signs of this can 
include: restlessness, anxiety, difficulty speaking, lightheadedness, feeling sick (nausea) or 
being sick (vomiting), numbness and tingling of the mouth and lips, metallic taste, tinnitus 
(i.e. ringing in the ears), dizziness, blurred vision, tremors or twitching, depression, drowsiness. 
Seek urgent medical attention if you notice any of these symptoms after being given 
EXPAREL liposomal. More serious side effects from being given too much bupivacaine include 
fits (convulsions), loss of consciousness and heart attack (see also section 4 of this leaflet).  
• 
Cardiovascular conditions 
Cardiovascular conditions can also sometimes occur after use of local anaesthetics. Signs to 
look out for include: abnormal/irregular heartbeat, low blood pressure, fainting, dizziness or 
lightheadedness, fatigue (tiredness), shortness of breath, or chest pain. Heart attack can also 
sometimes occur. Seek urgent medical attention if you notice any of these symptoms after 
being given EXPAREL liposomal (see also section 4 of this leaflet). 
• 
Methaemoglobinamia 
Methaemoglobinamia is a blood disorder affecting the red blood cells. This condition can occur 
immediately or a few hours after use of local anaesthetics. Signs and symptoms to look out for 
include: pale or grey/blue skin, shortness of breath, feeling lightheaded or fainting, confusion, 
palpitations, or chest pain. Seek urgent medical attention if you notice any of these symptoms 
after being given EXPAREL liposomal. Sometimes methaemoglobinamia can cause more 
serious symptoms such as irregular heartbeat, seizures, coma and even death (see also section 4 
of this leaflet).  
• 
Chondrolysis 
Chondrolysis (breakdown of cartilage in bone joints) has been noticed in patients receiving 
intra-articular infusion of local anaesthetics. Exparel liposomal must not be used for intra-
articular infusion. 
Children and adolescents 
EXPAREL liposomal is not for use in children under 6 years of age to reduce pain in small- to 
medium-sized wounds following surgery . This medicine has not been studied in this age group.  
EXPAREL liposomal is not for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age to reduce pain in 
a specific part of the body following surgery (such as knee or shoulder joint surgery) . This medicine 
has not been studied in this age group.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Important: Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) before using. 
Each EXPAREL liposomal vial is for single use only.  
Unopened EXPAREL liposomal vials should be refrigerated between 2°C to 8°C. EXPAREL 
liposomal should not be frozen. 
Sealed, unopened EXPAREL liposomal vials may also be stored at room temperature (below 25°C) 
for up to 30 days. Vials should not be re-refrigerated.  
After first opening 
Chemical and physical in-use stability of EXPAREL liposomal withdrawn from vials and transferred 
into polypropylene syringes has been demonstrated for 48 hours when stored in a refrigerator (2°C to 
8°C), or 6 hours when stored at room temperature (below 25°C). From a microbiological point of 
view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and 
conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and should not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C 
to 8°C unless opening has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
After dilution 
Chemical and physical in-use stability of EXPAREL liposomal when admixed with other formulations 
of bupivacaine has been demonstrated for 24 hours at room temperature (below 25°C). When admixed 
with 9 mg/mL (0.9%) sodium chloride or lactated Ringer’s solution, chemical and physical in-use 
stability has been demonstrated for 4 hours when stored in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C) and at room 
temperature (below 25°C). From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of dilution 
precludes the risk of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user.  
EXPAREL liposomal vials should be visually inspected prior to administration. The vials should be 
gently inverted to re-suspend the particles in the dispersion immediately prior to withdrawal from the 
vial. Multiple inversions may be necessary if the contents of the vial have settled. 
EXPAREL liposomal is intended for single-dose administration only. The maximum dose should not 
exceed 266 mg (20 mL). The recommended dose for local infiltration is based on size of the surgical 
site, volume required to cover the area and individual patient factors that may impact the safety of an 
amide local anesthetic (see SmPC section 4.2). 
EXPAREL liposomal can be administered in the ready to use dispersion or diluted to a concentration 
of up to 0.89 mg/mL (i.e. 1:14 dilution by volume) with 9 mg/mL (0.9%) sodium chloride or lactated 
Ringer’s solution. EXPAREL liposomal should not be mixed with any other medicinal products, nor 
diluted with water or other hypotonic agents as it will result in disruption of the liposomal particles. 
EXPAREL liposomal is a liposomal preparation and should not be used interchangeably with any 
other formulations of bupivacaine. Bupivacaine hydrochloride (immediate release formulations) and 
EXPAREL liposomal may be administered simultaneously in the same syringe as long as the ratio of 
the milligram dose of bupivacaine solution to EXPAREL liposomal does not exceed 1:2. The total 
amount of bupivacaine HCl and EXPAREL liposomal being co-administered should not exceed 
400 mg equivalents of bupivacaine HCl in adults. Bupivacaine amount in EXPAREL liposomal is 
expressed as the free base of bupivacaine, thus, when calculating the total dose of bupivacaine for 
coadministration, the amount of bupivacaine from EXPAREL liposomal should be converted to the 
equivalent of bupivacaine HCl by multiplying EXPAREL liposomal dose with a factor of 1.128.  
Caution is advised when co-administering EXPAREL liposomal and bupivacaine HCl, particularly 
when administering to highly vascular areas where higher systemic absorption is expected (see SmPC 
section 4.4). 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The administration of EXPAREL liposomal may follow the administration of lidocaine after a delay of 
20 minutes or more.  
When a topical antiseptic such as povidone iodine is applied, the site should be allowed to dry before 
EXPAREL liposomal is administered into the site. EXPAREL liposomal should not be allowed to 
come into contact with antiseptics such as povidone iodine in solution. 
EXPAREL liposomal should be injected slowly (generally 1 to 2 mL per injection) using a 25 gauge 
or larger bore needle. The surgical site should be aspirated frequently, when clinically appropriate, 
during administration to check for blood and minimize the risk of inadvertent intravascular injection.  
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Worldwide, lung cancer represents 11.6% (2.1 million) of the total cancer cases in 2018 (Bray et al. 2018). 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18.4% of the total) 
in 2018. Around 80-90% of the patients with lung cancer have non-small cell lung cancer (Planchard et al. 
Ann of Oncol. 2018). The majority of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) present with locally 
advanced or metastatic disease and for these patients the prognosis is poor, with overall 5-year survival 
rates of 5%  (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result Program [SEER]).  The symptomatic burden is 
high, with patients experiencing debilitating symptoms such as fatigue, loss of appetite, shortness of breath, 
cough, pain, and blood in sputum (Iyer et al. 2014).  
The EGFR pathway is an important signalling pathway that regulates tumourigenesis and cell survival and 
is frequently overexpressed in the development and progression of NSCLC. Activating mutations in EGFR 
are  present  in  a  distinct  subset  of  patients  with  NSCLC  and  have  biological,  clinical,  and  therapeutic 
implications.  Epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  mutations  are  found  in  about  10%  to  20%  of  Caucasian 
patients with lung adenocarcinomas and up to 40% to 60% in Asian patients (Midha et al. 2015; Hsu et al. 
2018). Patients who are Asian, female, non-smokers, or have NSCLC of adenocarcinoma histology are more 
likely to harbour an EGFR mutation (Zhang et al. 2016). The median age of these patients at diagnosis is 
67  years  (Sandelin  et  al.  2015;  Inoue  et  al.  2016).  Approximately  25%  to  40%  of  patients  with  EGFR-
mutated NSCLC present with central nervous system (CNS) metastases (Chooback et al. 2017; Preusser et 
al. 2018). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/647625/2019 
Page 7/88 
 
  
  
The majority of EGFR mutations (90%) are due to deletions within exon 19 or a leucine-858-to arginine 
substitution mutation in exon 21 (L858R) (Murray et al. 2008). Both mutations result in activation of the 
tyrosine kinase domain. The presence of these activating EGFR mutations in advanced NSCLC is associated 
with sensitivity to the small molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), however the degree of benefit 
may differ based on the type of mutation, with the benefit of EGFR TKIs being larger in exon19 deletion 
mutations (Sheng et al. 2016). With currently available EGFR TKIs, prognosis is improving, but remains 
poor  as  most  patients  eventually  develop  treatment  resistance  and  will  eventually  experience  disease 
progression  on  EGFR  TKI  therapy.  The  5-year  survival  rate  was  14.6%  in  EGFR-mutated  NSLC  patients 
treated with erlotinib or gefitinib (Lin et al. 2016). There thus remains a need for new treatment options to 
improve the outcome of these patients. 
Current treatment option 
According to the ESMO guideline for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, first-line treatment options for 
patients with EGFR-positive NSCLC are: gefitinib, erlotinib ± bevacizumab, afatinib, dacomitinib, osimertinib 
or gefitinib + carboplatin + pemetrexed. Of these, gefitinib, erlotinib ± bevacizumab, afatinib, dacomitinib, 
osimertinib are approved by EC as first-line therapy.  
Second-line  treatment  consists  of  osimertinib  in  case  of  a  T790M  mutation  and  platinum-based 
chemotherapy  or  carboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab/atezolizumab 
in  T790M  negative  patients. 
Subsequent treatment for patients who become progressive on osimertinib consist also of platinum-based 
chemotherapy or carboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab/atezolizumab. 
About the product 
Ramucirumab  is  a  human  receptor-targeted  antibody  that  specifically  binds  vascular  endothelial  growth 
factor (VEGF) receptor 2 and blocks binding of its activating ligands VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D. VEGF 
Receptor 2  is  the  key  mediator  of  VEGF  induced  angiogenesis.  As  a  result,  ramucirumab  inhibits  ligand 
stimulated  activation  of  VEGF  Receptor 2  and  its  downstream  signalling  components,  including  p44/p42 
mitogen-activated  protein  kinases,  neutralising  ligand-induced  proliferation  and  migration  of  human 
endothelial cells (Cyramza : EPAR - Product Information). 
In  the  EU,  Cyramza  is  approved  for  the  second-line  treatment  of  advanced  gastric  cancer  or  gastro-
oesophageal  junction  adenocarcinoma  (as  monotherapy  or  in  combination  with  chemotherapy),  locally 
advanced  or  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  (in  combination  with  chemotherapy),  and 
metastatic colorectal cancer (in combination with chemotherapy). Marketing authorisation of Cyramza as 
second-line treatment of patients with  hepatocellular carcinoma who have serum  alpha fetoprotein  of  ≥ 
400 ng/ml is pending European Commission (EC) decision (EMA/CHMP/360998/2019).  
The MAH applied for the following indication which was considered acceptable by CHMP: 
Cyramza  in  combination  with  erlotinib  is  indicated  for  the  first-line  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. 
The recommended dose of ramucirumab in combination with erlotinib is 10 mg/kg every two weeks. 
EGFR mutation status should be determined prior to initiation of treatment with ramucirumab and erlotinib 
using  a  validated  test  method.  See  erlotinib  prescribing  information  for  the  posology  and  method  of 
administration of erlotinib (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
Scientific advice 
On  17  October  2014  the  applicant  Eli  Lilly  requested  scientific  advice  for  their  product  ramucirumab 
(Procedure  No.:  EMEA/H/SA/1505/7/2014/II).  The  CHMP  accepted  PFS  as  primary  endpoint,  but 
recommended that progression free survival 2 (PFS2) data will be collected for additional support of the 
benefit-risk assessment. Erlotinib as background therapy and placebo as comparator were accepted. It was 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/647625/2019 
Page 8/88 
 
  
  
recommended that within patient changes in blood pressure during the first treatment cycle are reported 
for control and experimental arms, i.e. not only as percentage of patients with hypertension, and that these 
data are discussed from an unblinding perspective.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Ramucirumab is a protein, which is expected to be metabolised in the body and biodegrade in the 
environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), ramucirumab is exempt from the submission of 
Environmental Risk Assessment studies as the product and excipients do not expect to pose a significant 
risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant did not submit studies for the ERA. According to the guideline, in the case of products 
containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), a justification for the lack of ERA studies is 
acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

 Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology package includes ramucirumab pharmacokinetic (PK) and immunogenicity data 
from  the  target  population,  drug-drug  interaction  (DDI),  and  exposure-response  (ER)  analyses.  These 
analyses were based on data obtained in the RELAY study. 
RELAY was a phase 1b/3 study in patients with metastatic NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations (exon 19 
deletions or exon 21 [L858R] substitution mutations) who were being treated for their disease for the first 
time. Patients with a known T790M mutation were excluded from study participation. 
Patients received ramucirumab or placebo Q2W until disease progression, the development of unacceptable 
toxicity, noncompliance or withdrawal of consent by the patient, or investigator decision. 
Part A (phase 1b) 
The primary objective of part A was to assess the safety and tolerability of ramucirumab (10 mg/kg Q2W) 
when administered in combination with erlotinib (150 mg/day) as therapy in previously untreated patients 
with metastatic NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations. 
Part B (phase 3) 
The primary objective of part B was to compare PFS for ramucirumab administered in combination with 
erlotinib  versus  placebo  in  combination  with  erlotinib  in  previously  untreated  patients  with  metastatic 
NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations.  
•  Ramucirumab (10 mg/kg) or an indistinguishable placebo intravenous infusion was administered 
over approximately 1 hour on Day 1 of each cycle (14 days [±3 days]). 
• 
Erlotinib (150 mg) was taken orally once daily. On Day 1 of each cycle, patients received erlotinib 
after  completion  of  ramucirumab  infusion  (after  the  observation  period,  post-ramucirumab  or 
placebo infusion). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/647625/2019 
Page 10/88 
 
  
  
 
In part B, patients were randomised evenly between the 2 treatment arms using the following stratification 
factors: 
• 
• 
• 
EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion versus exon 21 [L858R] substitution mutation) 
gender (male versus female) 
region (East Asia versus other) 
•  EGFR testing method (Therascreen® [Qiagen] and Cobas® [Roche] versus other polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) and sequencing-based methods) 
Blood samples for the determination of serum concentrations of ramucirumab were collected from patients 
in part B. No ramucirumab PK data were collected in part A. Samples were collected prior to infusion (trough 
concentration or minimum concentration [Cmin]) for Cycles 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 (Weeks 0, 2, 6, 12, and 26) 
and  approximately  1  hour  following  the  end  of  infusion  (approximate  peak  or  maximum  concentration 
[Cmax]) for Cycles 1 and 14 (Weeks 0 and 26). The PK data from 215 patients receiving ramucirumab plus 
erlotinib in RELAY part B were included in the descriptive PK summary. 
Ramucirumab  concentrations  were  measured  in  serum  samples  using  a  validated  enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay. The bioanalytical method was developed and validated at Intertek Pharmaceutical 
Services (San Diego, CA, USA) and Charles River Laboratories (Senneville, Quebec, Canada) as provided 
in previous submissions (hepatocellular carcinoma and advanced gastric cancer). The bioanalytical methods 
performed  at  Intertek  and  Charles  River  Laboratories  were  cross-validated  and  shown  to  perform 
comparably. 
Ramucirumab  serum  trough  and  approximate  peak  concentration  (1  hour  post  end  of  infusion)  data 
following administration of 10 mg/kg ramucirumab Q2W in combination with erlotinib are summarized in

Study).

Table 2: Summary of ramucirumab trough and peak concentrations for previously untreated patients with 
metastatic NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations following administration of 10 mg/kg of ramucirumab 
Q2W as an IV Infusion over approximately 1 hour in combination with erlotinib (RELAY Study) 
Administration of ramucirumab to NSCLC patients in the RELAY study using the 10 mg/kg Q2W posology 
yielded a Cmin of 68.5 μg/ml (range of 20.3-142 μg/ml) and 85.7 μg/ml (range of 36.0 -197 μg/ml) prior 
to administration of the fourth and seventh dose, respectively. This exposure is somewhat higher than that 
obtained following administration of 10 mg/kg Q3W, as is used for the treatment of NSCLC patients with 
ramucirumab and docetaxel (with geometric means of ramucirumab Cmin of 28.3 μg/ml (range of 2.5-108 
μg/ml) and 38.4 μg/ml (range of 3.1-128 μg/ml) prior to administration of the third and fifth dose). 
Further, dose-normalised ramucirumab peak concentrations obtained with ramucirumab given as 10 mg/kg 
Q2W  in  the  RELAY  study  were  comparable  with  those  obtained  at  a  8  mg/kg  Q2W  dose  given  in  other 
clinical studies with ramucirumab (Table 3), indicating a relatively modest increased absolute peak exposure 
in the RELAY study. The comparable PK of ramucirumab in the RELAY study in combination with erlotinib 
as compared to the other clinical studies where ramucirumab was given as singe agent indicates that co-
administration of erlotinib is unlikely to affect ramucirumab PK.

Population pharmacokinetics in first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC with activating EGFR 
mutations 
Sparse  ramucirumab PK data collected in the  RELAY study were pooled together with the most recently 
submitted  REACH-2  (hepatocellular  carcinoma)  pooled  population  pharmacokinetics  (PopPK)  dataset 
(containing  PK  data  from  previously  conducted  17  Phase  2  and  Phase  3  studies)  for  an  updated  PopPK 
analysis.  
The ramucirumab concentration-time data were well described by a previously developed (REACH-2 PopPK 
report) two-compartment structural model parameterized in terms of CL, V1, V2, and Q with time-varying 
CL. The time-varying CL was incorporated into the model using a sigmoid function parameterized in terms 
of CL, Tmax, T50, and a sigmoid shape parameter. The effect of body weight was included on CL and V1 and 
exponential  inter-patient  variability  terms  were  included  for  CL,  V1,  and  V2.  An  additive  inter-patient 
variability  term  was  included  on  Tmax,  with  covariance  between  CL  and  V1,  and  CL  and  Tmax.  Residual 
variability was accounted for by an additive/proportional error structure. 
The new patient population (first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC with activating EGFR 
mutations)  made  up  about  8%  of  the  RELAY  pooled  PopPK  dataset.  In  addition,  the  majority  of  RELAY 
patients were Asian (77%), with the Asian patients in the RELAY study comprising more than 20% of the 
Asian population in the RELAY pooled PopPK analysis dataset. Distribution of other patient factors and lab 
values were similar between the RELAY and REACH-2 (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) pooled populations. 
Therefore,  only  race  and  patient  population  were  included  into  the  covariate  assessment  in  the  PopPK 
analysis.  Adding  RELAY  data  into  the  REACH-2  (HCC)  pooled  dataset  is  unlikely  to  affect  previous 
conclusions on other covariates. 
In  this  updated  PopPK  analysis,  patient  population  and  race  were  not  found  to  satisfy  the  predefined 
inclusion criteria. Therefore, the final model is same as the previous REACH-2 PopPK analysis.  
A summary of the post hoc estimates of PK parameter (clearance (CL), volume of distribution at steady 
state (Vss)), and half-life (t1/2)) at steady state is presented in Table 4. As shown in this table, the results 
in RELAY study were similar to those previously reported in the REACH-2 pooled PopPK analysis and the 
RELAY pooled PopPK analysis.

Table 4: Post hoc estimates of pharmacokinetic parameters for ramucirumab (steady state) 
Predicted estimates of ramucirumab PK parameters derived from this pooled analysis (RELAY + REACH-2 
PopPK dataset) are summarized in Figure 2 for different patient populations and in Figure 3 for patients 
with different races. The PK parameters are generally comparable among different patient populations 
and races, consistent with the findings from the covariate assessment.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
To support the registration of ramucirumab in combination with erlotinib as 1L treatment for patients with 
metastatic NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations, a DDI substudy was conducted in RELAY part B to assess 
the effect of concomitant ramucirumab on the PK of erlotinib. 
Serial blood samples for determination of erlotinib concentration in plasma were collected in a subset of 
patients in RELAY part B on Day 1 of Cycle 2 and at 24 hours (Day 2 Cycle 2) following their erlotinib dose 
on Day 1 of Cycle 2. Non-compartmental methods of analysis (NCA) were performed on concentration-time 
data from 11 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 15 patients in the placebo plus erlotinib 
arm. 
Distribution of erlotinib exposure parameters in plasma were generally similar between 2 arms (Figure 4). 
Table 5 shows the results of the statistical analysis to assess the effect of co-administration of ramucirumab 
on PK of erlotinib. The ratios of geometric LS means and 90% CIs at 1.23 (90% CI; 1.02, 1.50) for AUCTAU 
and 1.14 (90% CI; 0.97, 1.34) for Cmax, indicated that co-administration with ramucirumab is unlikely to 
affect erlotinib  PK. The erlotinib exposure  levels observed  in  ramucirumab plus erlotinib or placebo plus 
erlotinib arms are generally consistent with data published in the literature (Hidalgo and Bloedow 2003; Lu 
et al. 2006; Gray et al. 2014).

2.3.3.  PK/PD and exposure-response analyses 
Exposure-response (ER) analyses were performed to characterize the relationship between ramucirumab 
exposure and selected measures of efficacy and safety in first-line treatment of patients with metastatic 
NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations. 
Exposure-Efficacy Analysis 
The relationship between ramucirumab exposure and PFS was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) methods, 
Cox models, and case-matched control analysis for RELAY part B ITT population (n=216 ramucirumab plus 
erlotinib arm, n=225 placebo plus erlotinib arm). Model-predicted Cmin,1 was selected for exposure-efficacy 
analysis. 
For the purpose of comparison of the ramucirumab treatment arm with the placebo treatment arm, patients 
who had non-missing ramucirumab concentration data were grouped into 4 quartiles (Cmin,1: <25%, 25% 
to <50%, 50% to <75%, and ≥75%). Efficacy was compared between the ramucirumab treatment arm 
and placebo treatment arm for each of the 4 groups. 
Of note, imbalanced baseline factors were observed among different quartile groups. A couple of factors 
potentially associated with poorer prognosis, including Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance 
status (ECOG PS) (1) and number of metastatic sites (≥3), were somewhat more frequent in lower exposure 
groups. In addition, mean values of tumour burden appeared to be greater in lower exposure groups. 
Exposure as a Continuous Covariate 
Univariate analysis was performed to evaluate the exposure-efficacy relationship for PFS. Results are shown 
in Table 6 for the predicted Cmin,1. This approach did not adjust the imbalanced prognostic factors associated 
with PFS among the quartiles and placebo group.  
The KM plots of PFS by Cmin,1 quartiles for RELAY Part B intention to treat (ITT) population are presented in 
Figure  5. Apparent separation  was observed between placebo  plus erlotinib arm  and each ramucirumab 
plus erlotinib quartile. The median PFS was 18.0,  15.8, 19.6, and 21.9 months for  Q1, Q2,  Q3, and  Q4 
groups,  respectively;  the  median  PFS  in  the  placebo  treatment  arm  was  12.4  months.  The  median  PFS 
values  from  all  exposure  quartiles  were  longer  than  that  of  placebo  plus  erlotinib  arm,  but  no  clear 
exposure-response relationship was observed within the exposure range following 10 mg/kg Q2W in the 
study. 
Result from the univariate analysis showed that the association between PFS and Cmin,1 was not statistically 
significant (p=0.3309) (Table 6).

ITT population.

Multivariate Cox Regression Analysis 
A  multivariate  Cox  regression  analysis  was  conducted  to  account  for  the  significant  prognostic  factor 
associated with PFS (ECOG PS). The comparisons between the placebo and ramucirumab quartile groups 
are shown in (Table 7). After adjusting for the baseline factor that was significantly associated with PFS, a 
strong treatment effect on PFS was observed for all exposure groups with hazard ratio (HR) ranging from 
0.504 to 0.769 among different exposure quartile groups. No apparent exposure-response trending was 
observed.  After  adjusting  for  this  baseline  prognostic  factor,  the  association  between  PFS  and  Cmin,1 
remained statistically insignificant (p=0.2971) (Table 6).

Table 7: Multivariate cox regression analysis of progression-free survival by Cmin,1 quartiles 
As another way to adjust for a potential impact of imbalance in baseline characteristics and of imbalance 
important prognostic factors between the treatments within each exposure group, case-matched control 
analyses for PFS were explored to evaluate the exposure-PFS relationship. There were 2 matching factors 
to be adjusted for PFS in the RELAY Part B ITT population: age group (<65 years versus ≥65 years) and 
ECOG  PS  (0  versus  1).  Age  was  imbalanced,  and  ECOG  PS  (0  versus  1)  was  prognostic.  Based  on  the 
Mahalanobis metric matching, 54 patients from the placebo treatment arm were selected to match 1:1 with 
each of the 4 case groups, respectively. 
To compare the 2 treatment arms in each of the 4 matched case-control groups, KM curves for PFS in each 
quartile group were compared and a clear separation of the PFS curves was observed in all quartile groups. 
Furthermore, Cox regression models, including  the interaction term of treatment by case-control group, 
were fitted in the pooled data of all pairs of case-control patients (Table 8). A strong treatment effect was 
found for all quartiles although the HRs of the Q3 and Q4 groups were numerically lower than those of the 
Q1 and Q2 groups. The trending is similar to that observed in Table 7. 
Table 8: Cox regression of progression-free survival for matched case-control groups after Mahalanobis 
Distance Matching for the RELAY part b ITT population 
Overall, the exposure-efficacy analyses identified no statistical relationship between ramucirumab exposure 
(Cmin,1) and PFS. A strong treatment effect on PFS was observed over the entire range of exposures achieved 
by a dosage of 10 mg/kg given Q2W in the ITT population. 
Exposure-Safety Analysis 
Data  from  a  total  of  216  patients  from  the  ramucirumab  plus  erlotinib  arm  and  225  patients  from  the 
placebo  plus  erlotinib  arm  were  included  in  the  exposure-safety  analysis.  The  exposure-safety  analysis 
evaluated 6 safety endpoints in the safety population, namely the 3 most common grade ≥3 treatment-
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring in at least 5% of patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib 
arm with a difference in incidence from the placebo plus erlotinib treatment arm of at least 2-percentage 
points and 3 adverse events of special interest (AESIs), as follows: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/647625/2019 
Page 18/88 
 
  
  
 
 
•  Grade ≥3 TEAEs: (hypertension (preferred term [PT]), diarrhoea, dermatitis acneiform) 
•  AESIs:  (hypertension  [any  grade],  proteinuria  [any  grade  and  grade  ≥3],  and  liver  failure/liver 
injury  [alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  and  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  increased  (any 
grade)]). 
Two exposure parameters, Cmin,1 and Cmin,ss were used for exposure-safety relationship assessment and the 
findings were generally consistent. Only results based on Cmin,ss are presented in this report. 
The  observed  incidence  of  the  selected  safety  endpoints  by  exposure  quartiles  was  first  summarized 
descriptively.  Additional  ordered  categorical  analysis  was  conducted  only  if  a  trend  was  observed  in 
graphical examinations. 
Grade ≥3 Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) 
The incidence of the selected grade ≥3 TEAEs, including hypertension, diarrhoea, and dermatitis acneiform 
by Cmin,ss quartile is shown in Figure 6. Although the observed incidences of each ramucirumab plus erlotinib 
Cmin,ss quartile were greater than that of the placebo plus erlotinib arm for all 3 selected grade ≥3 TEAEs, 
no trend of increasing incidences with increasing exposure was observed. Therefore, no additional ordered 
categorical analysis was conducted. 
Figure 6: Observed incidence of the selected Grade ≥3 TEAE and AESI by quartile of ramucirumab Cmin,ss in 
the RELAY part B safety population. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
A summary of incidence of the selected AESI by Cmin,ss quartile is shown in Figure 6 (grade ≥3 proteinuria), 
and in Figure 7 (any grade hypertension, proteinuria, and liver failure/liver injury). 
The observed incidences of each ramucirumab plus erlotinib Cmin,ss quartile were generally greater than that 
of the placebo plus erlotinib arm for all of the selected AESIs (any grade and grade ≥3). For the AESIs of 
any grade ALT or AST increased, a trend towards highest incidence of any grade ALT or AST increased was 
observed  in  the  highest  ramucirumab  exposure  group  (Figure  7).  No  association  between  increased 
ramucirumab concentration exposure and incidence was observed for any grade hypertension (Figure 7) 
and proteinuria (any grade [Figure 7] and grade ≥3 [Figure 6]). Therefore, additional ordered categorical 
analysis was only conducted for any grade ALT and AST increased.

RELAY part B safety population. 
Ordered Categorical Model for ALT and AST Increased 
A summary of the numbers of patients with each grade of AST or ALT increased grouped by treatment 
arms is presented in Table 9. Grade 1 incidence appeared to be the primary contribution to the difference 
observed between ramucirumab plus erlotinib and placebo plus erlotinib for any grade ALT or AST 
increased. Comparable incidences were observed between the 2 treatment arms for all other grades of 
ALT or AST increased except for grade 2 AST increased. The observed incidence of grade 2 AST increased 
was numerically higher in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm (6.0%) relative to that in the placebo plus 
erlotinib arm (2.2%). Figure 8 shows ramucirumab exposure distribution for each grade of ALT or AST 
increased. The results suggest that the severity of AST or ALT increased was unlikely related to 
ramucirumab exposure.

Figure 8: Distribution of predicted ramucirumab Cmin,ss by grade of ALT and AST increased for patients in 
ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm in the RELAY Part B safety population. 
Overall, exposure-safety analyses  showed no clear relationship between ramucirumab exposure and the 
incidence  of  selected  safety  endpoints,  including  the  most  common  grade  ≥3  TEAEs  (hypertension, 
diarrhoea,  and  dermatitis  acneiform)  and  AESIs  (any  grade  hypertension,  any  grade  and  grade  ≥3 
proteinuria,  liver  failure/liver  injury  [any  grade  ALT  or  AST  increased]),  over  the  range  of  exposures 
achieved by a dosage of 10 mg/kg given intravenously Q2W. 
Exposure-Dose Adjustment analysis 
The  RELAY  protocol  (provided  specific  instructions  for  dose  adjustments  (dose  delays  [ramucirumab  or 
placebo only], dose reductions and dose omissions) of ramucirumab/placebo and of erlotinib due to AEs. 
Dose adjustments of each treatment (ramucirumab and erlotinib or placebo and erlotinib) were summarized 
by ramucirumab Cmin,ss and Cmin,1 quartiles for the  exposure-safety analysis population. The results were 
generally consistent between these 2 exposure parameters.  
The  summary  results  by  ramucirumab  and  erlotinib  Cmin,ss  (for  all  causes)  are  presented  in  Figure  9. 
Analogous  results  were  obtained  for  analysis  by  ramucirumab  and  erlotinib  Cmin,ss  (cause  due  to  AEs) 
analysis by ramucirumab Cmin, 1. 
Ramucirumab 
No apparent relationship was observed between ramucirumab exposure and dose adjustments (dose delay, 
dose reduction, dose omission) of ramucirumab (Figure 9, panel A). However, the percentage of patients 
with dose adjustments of ramucirumab in all 4 ramucirumab plus erlotinib quartiles was generally higher 
in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm as compared with the placebo plus erlotinib arm. 
Erlotinib 
No  apparent  relationship  was  observed  between  ramucirumab  exposure  and  dose  adjustments  (dose 
reduction  and  dose  omission)  of  erlotinib  (Figure  9,  panel  B).  The  percentage  of  patients  with  dose 
adjustments of erlotinib was generally similar among the placebo plus erlotinib arm and all 4 ramucirumab 
plus erlotinib quartiles.

Figure 9: Summary of dose adjustments of (A) ramucirumab or placebo and (B) erlotinib by Cmin,ss quartiles 
in the RELAY Part B safety population due to all causes. 
Overall, increasing ramucirumab exposure did not appear to be associated with an increased percentage of 
dose adjustments for ramucirumab or erlotinib over the range of exposures achieved by a dosage of 10 
mg/kg given intravenously Q2W. 
Immunogenicity 
The  incidence  of  ramucirumab  immunogenicity  was  analysed  in  the  RELAY  study.  This  assessment  was 
conducted in the safety population of RELAY, which consisted of all patients who received at least 1 dose 
of ramucirumab or placebo. 
The immunogenicity of ramucirumab in RELAY in first-line metastatic NSCLC patients with activating EGFR 
mutations was low. Of the 416 evaluable patients, 6 were treatment–emergent ADA positive (1 patient in 
the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 5 patients in the placebo plus erlotinib arm), and 410 patients were 
treatment–emergent ADA-negative. 
One  patient  (0.5%)  in  the  ramucirumab  plus  erlotinib  arm  and  5  patients  (2.4%)  in  the  placebo  plus 
erlotinib arm developed ADA, which is consistent with results obtained in prior indications. No neutralizing 
antibodies were detected in any of the 6 patients who were treatment–emergent ADA positive  in either 
treatment arm. 
Effect of Immunogenicity on PK 
As indicated in Figure 10, ramucirumab trough concentrations for the 2 Cycle 4 trough samples  in which 
ADAs were detected were within the range of ramucirumab concentrations for samples, which did not have 
ADA  detected.  However,  the  limited  number  of  time-matched  ramucirumab  trough  samples  precluded 
definitive conclusions regarding the effect of immunogenicity on ramucirumab PK

Figure 10: Individual ramucirumab trough concentrations at Cycle 4 (Dose 4). 
Effect of Immunogenicity on Safety  
The AE profile in patients who tested positive for ramucirumab ADA either at baseline or post baseline (that 
is, treatment-emergent ADA positive) was consistent with that observed in the overall safety population. 
Specifically, any association between the presence of baseline ADA or post-baseline treatment-emergent 
ADA  and  the  occurrence  of  infusion-related  reactions,  including  anaphylactic  reactions  was  evaluated. 
Infusion-related reactions were identified based on timing of events relative to study drug administration. 
Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), defined as hypersensitivity events occurring on the day of 
drug  administration,  are  considered  more  specific  to  identify  infusion-related  reactions.  There  were  no 
reports of infusion-related reactions in treatment-emergent ADA-positive patients in either treatment arm. 
Overall,  14  treatment-emergent  ADA-negative  patients  (7  patients  in  each  treatment  arm)  reported  an 
infusion-related  reaction.  The  frequency  of  infusion-related  reactions  was  low,  and  no  difference  was 
observed  in  the  incidence  of  IRRs  between  treatment-emergent  ADA-positive  patients  (0.0%)  and 
treatment-emergent  ADA-negative  patients  (3.4%).  The  evaluation  of  the  data  did  not  support  that 
infusion-related reactions were mediated by treatment-emergent ADAs. 
Overall immunogenicity incidence in RELAY submission combined with the REACH-2 submission 
The  overall  immunogenicity  incidence,  including  25  studies  across  different  indications,  was  previously 
reported in the REACH-2 submission. This cumulative summary from the REACH-2 submission has been 
updated to include data from the RELAY submission (Table 10). 
The  updated  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  ADA  for  all  ramucirumab  treated-patients  and  placebo-
treated patients was 2.9%  and 2.1%,  respectively.  Addition  of  results from RELAY had  no effect on the 
immunogenicity conclusions of the overall ramucirumab program.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology package of this type II variation includes ramucirumab PK and immunogenicity 
data from the target population, drug-drug interactions, and exposure-response analyses. These analyses 
were based on data obtained in the RELAY study. 
Ramucirumab PK 
Administration of ramucirumab to NSCLC patients in the RELAY study using the 10 mg/kg Q2W posology 
yielded a Cmin of 68.5 μg/ml (range of 20.3-142 μg/ml) and 85.7 μg/ml (range of 36.0 -197 μg/ml) prior 
to  administration  of  the  fourth  and  seventh  two-weekly  dose,  respectively.  This  exposure  is  somewhat 
higher than that obtained following administration of ramucirumab 10 mg/kg Q3W, as was used for the 
treatment of NSCLC patients with ramucirumab and docetaxel in the REVEL study (with geometric means 
of ramucirumab Cmin  of 28.3 μg/ml (range of  2.5-108  μg/ml)  and  38.4  μg/ml (range of  3.1-128 μg/ml) 
prior to administration of the third and fifth dose). This higher Cmin in the RELAY study is in line with the 
shorter dosing interval in the RELAY study as compared to the REVEL study, i.e., 10 mg/kg Q2W and Q3W, 
respectively. 
Further, dose-normalised ramucirumab peak concentrations obtained with ramucirumab given as 10 mg/kg 
Q2W in the RELAY study were comparable with those obtained at an 8 mg/kg Q2W dose given in other 
clinical  studies  with  ramucirumab,  indicating  a  relatively  modest  increased  absolute  ramucirumab  peak 
exposure in the RELAY study.  
Sparse ramucirumab PK data collected in the RELAY study were analysed also using a previously developed 
PopPK model. The PK of ramucirumab in the RELAY study were reasonably well described by the previously 
established 2-compartment model with time-varying clearance. In the RELAY patient population, geometric 
mean (coefficient of variation) steady state ramucirumab PopPK model-derived estimates were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
clearance, 0.0113 L/hour (22.1%);  
volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), 4.03 L (15.1%);  
apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), 10.7 days (20.7%). 
These ramucirumab PK properties in first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC with activating 
EGFR  mutations  were  found  to  be  similar  to  other  patient  populations  with  different  tumour  types  and 
different lines of therapy, as well as among different races. 
Drug-drug interactions  
The comparable PK of ramucirumab in the RELAY study in combination with erlotinib as compared to the 
other clinical studies in which ramucirumab was given as singe agent indicates that co-administration of 
erlotinib is unlikely to affect ramucirumab PK. 
A DDI substudy was conducted in the RELAY study to assess the effect of concomitant ramucirumab on the 
PK  of  erlotinib.  Based  on  non-compartmental  methods  of  analysis  on  concentration-time  data  from  11 
patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 15 patients in  the placebo plus erlotinib arm, it was 
concluded that distribution of erlotinib exposure parameters in plasma were generally similar between the 
ramucirumab plus erlotinib and placebo plus erlotinib arms. The ratios of geometric LS means and 90% CIs 
at  1.23  (90%  CI;  1.02,  1.50)  for  AUCTAU  and  1.14  (90%  CI;  0.97,  1.34)  for  Cmax,  indicated  that  co-
administration with ramucirumab is unlikely to affect erlotinib PK. 
Exposure-response analyses  
ER analyses were performed to characterize the relationship between ramucirumab exposure and selected 
measures of efficacy and safety in first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC with activating 
EGFR mutations. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/647625/2019 
Page 24/88 
 
  
  
For  efficacy,  the  ER  analysis  encompassed  PFS.  The  exposure-efficacy  analysis  identified  no  statistically 
significant relationship between ramucirumab exposure (Cmin,1) and PFS. A strong treatment effect on PFS 
was observed over the entire range of exposures achieved by a dosage of 10 mg/kg given Q2W in the ITT 
population. The lack of a statistically significant relationship between ramucirumab Cmin,1 and PFS is different 
from  the  findings  from  other  ramucirumab  Phase  3  studies  in  the  second-line  setting.  A  potential 
explanation may be the somewhat more intense dosing regimen that was applied in the RELAY study as 
compared to other studies.  
The  ER  analyses  for  safety  evaluated  6  safety  endpoints  in  the  safety  population,  namely  the  3  most 
common grade ≥3 TEAEs occurring in at least 5% of patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 3 
AESIs, i.e., hypertension, proteinuria and liver failure/liver injury. The exposure-safety analyses showed 
no relationship between ramucirumab exposure  and the incidence of selected safety endpoints  over the 
range  of  exposures  achieved  by  a  dosage  of  10  mg/kg  given  intravenously  Q2W.  Finally,  increasing 
ramucirumab exposure did not appear to be associated with an increased percentage of dose adjustments 
for  ramucirumab  or  erlotinib  over  the  range  of  exposures  achieved  by  a  dosage  of  10  mg/kg  given 
intravenously Q2W. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibody in the RELAY study was low and consistent with 
the known immunogenicity profile of ramucirumab and with the overall ramucirumab-treated population: 1 
patient (0.5%) in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 5 patients (2.4%) in the placebo plus erlotinib 
arm.  None  of  the  6  patients  who  were  treatment-emergent  ADA  positive  in  either  treatment  arm  had 
neutralizing antibodies. There was no observed link for ramucirumab between immunogenicity and safety 
for patients in RELAY, including occurrence of infusion-related reactions.  
Due to the low rate of ADA formation, no definitive conclusions could be drawn on the potential effect of 
ADA on PK, though an effect seems unlikely, and no analysis of the effect of immunogenicity on efficacy 
was conducted. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology package supporting this type II variation, including ramucirumab and erlotinib 
PK  and  immunogenicity  data  from  the  target  NSCLC  population,  drug-drug  interactions,  and  exposure-
response analyses, is sufficient in support of the application.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The applicant submitted a single pivotal clinical trial (I4T-MC-JVCY) to support this extension of indication 
for  Cyramza.  Study  I4T-MC-JVCY  (RELAY)  was  a  global,  multicentre,  randomised,  placebo-controlled, 
double-blind,  phase  1b/3 study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  ramucirumab  in  combination  with 
erlotinib  for  the  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  metastatic  NSCLC  whose  tumours  have  epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations. 
The applicant sought scientific advice in 2014 (EMEA/H/SA/1505/7/2014/II) on key study design elements 
for study RELAY. The applicant asked whether the CHMP agreed with PFS as primary endpoint and erlotinib 
as backbone therapy.  
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
The  selection of  the  ramucirumab  10  mg/kg  Q2W  dosing  regimen in the  RELAY  study  was  based  on  an 
integrated assessment of the following previously available clinical data:

clinical safety data in early multiple dose ascending (MAD) studies, I4T-IE-JVBM (JVBM) and I4T-
IE-JVBN (JVBN). Weekly doses of ramucirumab ranging from 2 to 16 mg/kg were evaluated in the 
phase 1 Study JVBM. The MTD for weekly dosing was identified as 13 mg/kg every week. Further, 
every-2-week (6 to 10 mg/kg) and every-3-week (15 to 20 mg/kg) dose regimens were evaluated 
in  an  additional  dose-ranging  study  (Study  JVBN).  All  dose  regimens  in  Study  JVBN  were  well 
tolerated and no MTD was identified in this study.

ramucirumab dose of 10 mg/kg given every 3 weeks in combination with docetaxel, demonstrated 
statistically  significant  benefit  in  overall  survival  (OS)  and  a  favourable  benefit-risk  profile  in 
patients with NSCLC.

ER  findings  from  prior  randomised,  second-line  phase  3  ramucirumab  studies  in  gastric  or  GEJ 
adenocarcinoma  (REGARD  and  RAINBOW)  and  REVEL.  Exposure-efficacy  response  analyses 
performed on data obtained from these second-line phase 3 studies suggested that an increase in 
exposure may be associated with improvement in efficacy in terms of both OS and PFS.  
At the time of RELAY study design, the applicant considered that the totality of clinical data indicated that 
there may be an opportunity to further enhance efficacy of ramucirumab while maintaining an acceptable 
safety  profile  by  choosing  a  dosing  regimen  which  produces  higher  ramucirumab  exposure  than  the 
approved dosing regimen in second line NSCLC, 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Based on PK simulation, a dose 
regimen of 10 mg/kg on Day 1 Q2W was selected for Study JVCY for the following reasons: 
•  Using the same 10 mg/kg dose level as REVEL, the Cmax level should not be significantly increased 
and,  therefore,  it  may  help  mitigate  any  potential  Cmax  related  safety  risk.  The  more  frequent 
interval should produce higher overall exposure which may help maximize efficacy of ramucirumab. 
• 
It  is  expected  that  ramucirumab-related  AEs  in  the  NSCLC  indication  may  not  be  significantly 
increased using the selected ramucirumab dose of 10 mg/kg Q2W, since the selected dose for the 
RELAY Study is still approximately 60% lower than the maximum tolerated weekly dose identified 
in the phase 1 dose-escalation study, Study JVBM (13 mg/kg weekly). 
The actual safety and tolerability of the chosen ramucirumab dose (10 mg/kg Q2W) in combination with 
erlotinib (150 mg/day) was initially investigated in part A of study RELAY, prior to start of the phase 3 part 
B of this study. 
RELAY (I4T-MC-JVCY) – part A (phase 1b, safety lead-in portion of the study) 
Part A of the RELAY study was a single-arm, open-label, phase 1b study to confirm the safety and tolerability 
of ramucirumab, at the recommended phase 3 (part B) dose (10 mg/kg Q2W), in combination with erlotinib 
(150 mg/day).  
Methods  
The planned target enrolment of part A was 12 patients (6 patients from Japan and 6 patients from North 
America and Europe).

Objectives 
Primary objective: 
The primary objective of part A was to assess the safety and tolerability of ramucirumab (10 mg/kg every 
2 weeks [Q2W]) when administered in combination with  erlotinib (150 mg/day) as therapy in previously 
untreated patients with EGFR mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC. 
Treatments 
Patients received the following: 
- Ramucirumab (10 mg/kg) intravenous (IV) infusion over approximately 1 hour on day 1 of each cycle (14 
days [±3 days]) followed by a 1-hour observation period. If there was no evidence of an infusion-related 
reaction (IRR) after the initial and second infusions of ramucirumab, no observation period was required 
for  subsequent  treatment  cycles  (in  the  event  an  IRR  occurred  thereafter,  then  the  1-hour  observation 
should have been reinstituted). 
- Erlotinib (150 mg) orally once daily. On day 1 of each cycle, patients received erlotinib after completion 
of ramucirumab infusion (after the observation period, post-ramucirumab infusion). 
Dose-limiting toxicities 
The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment period was through two 2-week treatment cycles, cycles 1 and 
2 (totalling approximately 4 weeks).  
DLT definitions included: 
-  Grade 4 anaemia 
-  Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia 
-  Grade ≥3 febrile neutropenia 
-  Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days 
- 
Elevated urine protein of ≥3 g/24 hour 
-  Grade 4 or refractory hypertension 
-  Grade ≥3 non-hematologic toxicity excluding electrolyte abnormality or grade 3 skin rash 
A patient in part A who either completed cycle 2 or discontinued from study treatment or study participation 
before completing 2 cycles due to a DLT was considered DLT-evaluable.  
A DLT-non-evaluable patient was considered one who experienced disease progression, was noncompliant, 
or  discontinued  for  reasons  other  than  AEs  within  the  first  2  cycles  of  treatment.  Any  patient  who 
discontinued from the study before completing safety monitoring for the DLT assessment period for any 
other reason than DLT was considered non-evaluable for DLT assessment. Additional patients were enrolled 
as replacements for non-evaluable patients. 
Safety data throughout part A were evaluated by an assessment committee (AC). 
Upon review of safety data, the AC recommendation may have recommended one of the following: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
to start enrollment in part B with the starting dose of 10 mg/kg Q2W 
to  enroll  3  additional  patients  at  10  mg/kg  Q2W  and  reassess  the  dose  tolerability  once  these 
additional 3 patients complete the DLT Assessment Period 
to start enrollment in part B with the starting dose of 8 mg/kg Q2W 
to stop the study

Statistical and analytical plans 
Analysis populations 
The safety population consists of all patients enrolled in part A and received at least 1 dose of any study 
treatment.  The  DLT-evaluable  population  consists  of  patients  who  either  completed  first  2  cycles  of 
treatment (approximately 28 days +3 days) or discontinued from study treatment or study participations 
before completing first 2 cycles due to a DLT.   
Safety 
DLT  assessment  was  performed  in  the  DLT-evaluable  population  for  the  AEs  reported  during  the  DLT 
assessment period. The number of patients who experienced any DLT was presented based on the DLT-
evaluable population.  
All other safety analyses were performed using the part A safety population. The safety data collected in 
part A were not combined with the safety data collected in part B.  
Sample size  
At  least  12  previously  untreated  patients  with  metastatic  NSCLC  with  EGFR  activating  mutations  were 
planned to be enrolled. Patients were enrolled across 2 countries (6 patients from Japan; 6 patients from 
Europe [Spain]). Since only 2 dose levels were considered, a modified 3+3 design was used for each cohort 
in Part A. 
The recommended dose of ramucirumab for Part B was decided based on the following rules: 
- 
- 
If the proportion of patients experiencing DLT was <33% (0 or 1 patient with any DLTs) for DLT-
eligible patients from each of the cohorts during the first 2 cycles, the ramucirumab starting dose 
in Part B would be 10 mg/kg Q2W. 
If the proportion of patients experiencing DLTs was ≥33% (2 or more patients with any DLTs) for 
DLT-eligible patients from any of the cohorts during the first 2 cycles, the ramucirumab starting 
dose in Part B would depend on AC  recommendation. 
Results  
The part A safety population included 14 treated patients: 7 patients in Japan and 7 patients in Spain. Two 
patients in the safety population discontinued from ramucirumab and/or erlotinib before completion of cycle 
2 because of non-DLT AEs, and therefore the DLT-evaluable population for the DLT assessment included 
12 patients (6 patients in Japan and 6 patients in Spain). 
In the DLT-evaluable population, 1 patient experienced a DLT of grade 3 increased alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) in cycle 2. This event was assessed as related to study treatment and led to discontinuation from the 
study and the event resolved.  
Following DLT review in part A (on 16 December 2015), the AC recommended to initiate the randomised 
phase 3 portion of the study (part B) with ramucirumab at 10 mg/kg Q2W in combination with erlotinib 150 
mg/daily.  
2.4.2.  Main study 
RELAY (I4T-MC-JVCY) – part B 
Part B of the RELAY study was a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 study that compared the efficacy and 
safety of treatment with ramucirumab plus erlotinib versus placebo plus erlotinib. 
Figure 11 presents the study design of part A (phase 1b) and part B (phase 3).

Objectives 
Primary objective:  
The primary objective was to compare the progression free survival (PFS) of ramucirumab administered in 
combination with erlotinib versus placebo in combination with erlotinib in previously untreated patients with 
EGFR mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC. 
Secondary objectives: 
The secondary objectives were to compare ramucirumab administered in combination with erlotinib versus 
placebo administered in combination with erlotinib for: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
safety and toxicity profile 
overall survival (OS) 
objective response rate (ORR) (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) 
disease control rate (DCR) (CR + PR + stable disease [SD]) 
duration of response (DoR) 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of ramucirumab 
patient-reported outcomes (using Lung Cancer Symptom Scale [LCSS] and EuroQol 5-dimension, 
5-level questionnaire [EQ-5D-5L]) 
drug-drug interaction (DDI) sub-study at selected  sites in approximately 15 patients per arm to 
assess the PK of erlotinib with and without ramucirumab. 
Exploratory objectives: 
The exploratory objectives of part B were as follows: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
comparison of progression-free survival 2 (PFS2) between treatment arms 
association between biomarkers and clinical outcome 
time to deterioration (TtD) in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status (PS) 
time to diagnosis of CNS metastases 
PFS2 and OS analyses for patients who received osimertinib after disease progression versus those 
who did not time to response (CR or PR) for responders. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint:  
The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS, defined as the time from the date of randomisation 
until the date of radiographic documentation of progression (as defined by RECIST  v1.1) or the date of 
death due to any cause, whichever was earlier. Table 11 lists rules for determining date of progression or 
censor for PFS. Censoring was taken in the following order: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/647625/2019 
Page 31/88 
 
  
  
- 
- 
If  a  patient  did  not  have  a  baseline  disease  assessment,  then  the  PFS  time  was  censored  at  the 
randomisation date, regardless of whether or not objective PD or death had been observed for the 
patient; otherwise, 
If a patient was not known to have died or have investigator-assessed PD as of the data-inclusion 
cut-off date for the analysis, the PFS time was censored at the date of last post-baseline adequate 
radiological tumour assessment, or at the date of randomisation if the patient did not have any post-
baseline adequate radiological assessment. 
Table 11: Rules for determining date of progression or censor for progression-free survival 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included  OS,  ORR,  DCR,  and  DoR.  Assessment  for  response,  according  to 
RECIST. The secondary endpoints are shown in Table 12.

Table 12: Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Change from baseline for each LCSS or EQ-5D item at any post-baseline visit was calculated by subtracting 
baseline assessment result from the current assessment result. 
- 
LCSS total score was calculated as the mean of the 9 LCSS items. The LCSS total score was not 
computed for a patient if he/she had one or more missing values for the 9 LCSS items. 
-  Maximum change for each LCSS item was defined as the largest decrease from baseline, which was 
the smallest (that is, most negative or smallest positive) non-missing value among all change from 
baseline  values.  Note:  negative  values  of  change  from  baseline  (that  is,  decreases  in  the  LCSS 
score  towards  the  lower  end  of  the  symptom  scale)  indicate  improvement  in  symptoms.  For  a 
patient and given LCSS item, if all change values are positive, the smallest positive change will be 
the maximum change; if at least one change value is negative, the most negative value will be the 
maximum change. 
-  Time to deterioration (TtD) for each of the 9 LCSS items, Average Symptom Burden Index (ASBI), 
and the LCSS total score was defined as the time from the date of randomisation until the date of 
the  first  ≥15-mm  increase  from  baseline  (de  Marinis  et  al.  2008).  Alternative  definitions  of 
minimally important differences may have been explored as needed. Patients without deterioration 
were  censored  on  the  date  of  the  patient’s  last  post-baseline  LCSS  assessment  for  this  item  or 
randomisation date, whichever was last.

Exploratory efficacy endpoints: 
Exploratory endpoints are shown in Table 13. 
Table 13: Exploratory efficacy endpoints 
Sample size 
The sample size was determined based on the following assumptions:  
- 
- 
- 
the randomisation ratio is 1:1 (ramucirumab:placebo)  
a nominal alpha <0.00001 was spent in order to maintain type-I error for 1 interim futility analysis 
when at least 114 PFS events 
assuming  a  HR  of  0.71  and  at  least  270  PFS  events  (40%  censoring),  provides  at  least  80% 
statistical power to detect superiority of the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm over the placebo plus 
erlotinib arm with a 1-sided log-rank test and a type-I error of 0.02499. 
Randomisation 
Approximately  450  patients  were  planned  to  be  randomised  (1:1)  between  the  2  treatment  arms. 
Randomisation was stratified by the following factors: 
-  Gender (male or female) 
- 
Region (East Asia or other) 
o  East Asia included: South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan 
o  Other included: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Romania, Spain, Turkey, United States, 
and United Kingdom 
- 
- 
EGFR mutation type (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 [L858R] substitution mutation) 
EGFR  testing  method  (Therascreen®  and  Cobas®  or  other  polymerase  chain  reaction  [PCR]  and 
sequencing-based methods). 
The  chosen  stratification  factors  were  identified  as  variables  with  potential  influence  on  the  primary 
objective of PFS. Patients with EGFR mutations benefit from targeted therapy whether they have an exon 
19 deletion or exon 21 substitution mutation; however, the degree of benefit may differ based on the type 
of  mutation  (Seto  et  al.  2014).  Gender  is  linked  with  prognosis;  therefore,  this  was  included  as  a 
stratification factor (Ou et al. 2009; Siddiqui et al. 2010). Region was included as a stratification factor due 
to  the  potential  regional  heterogeneity  of  standards  of  care.  EGFR  testing  methods  are  considered  a 
necessary stratification factor given that heterogeneity in testing methods might increase the enrolment of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

patients with false positive EGFR mutations. Note that local EGFR testing results were used for enrolment 
into the study; central tissue testing was performed to corroborate activating mutation status. 
Blinding (masking) 
Part B of the RELAY study was double-blinded. For part B patients, investigators and all other personnel 
involved in the conduct of the study were blinded to individual treatment assessments for the duration of 
the study. Upon the observance of approximately 270 PFS events, a database cut-off was planned and the 
database was to be locked for the primary PFS analysis, results of which are summarized and discussed in 
this CSR. The database lock date for primary  PFS analysis occurred  on 14 February  2019 with  280 PFS 
events. 
Statistical methods 
Censoring rules PFS  
Refer to Table 11 for the rules for determining date of progression or censor for progression-free survival. 
ORR/DCR handling missing data 
Patients who do not have any post-baseline tumour response assessments for any reason are considered 
non-responders  and  are  included  in  the  denominator  when  calculating  the  response  rate.  Tumour 
assessments  performed  after  initiation  of  new  anticancer  treatment  (systemic  therapy)  will  be  excluded 
from evaluating the best overall response and DCR. 
Efficacy 
PFS,  PFS2,  and  interim  OS  was  based  on  a  stratified  (using  interactive  web-response  system  [IWRS] 
factors) log-rank test and was performed on the ITT population. Additionally, the KM method was used to 
estimate parameters (medians and quartiles) by treatment arm. The HR and its 2-sided 95% confidence 
interval  (CI)  were  estimated  using  a  stratified  Cox  regression  model.  Restricted  mean  difference  in  PFS 
between the treatment arms and its 95% CI will be reported, while the restriction time is defined by the 
latest time where the standard error of the PFS estimates are ≤ 0.075 months. Several sensitivity analyses 
were performed on PFS and OS including one that does not censor for 2 or more visits and does not censor 
for new anti-cancer treatment, i.e. the EMA-preferred PFS analysis. 
Objective response (CR + PR) rate and disease control (CR + PR + SD) rate were provided with exact 95%-
CI per arm and compared using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for the stratification variables.  
Duration of response and time to diagnosis of  CNS metastases  were compared  between both treatment 
arms using unstratified log-rank test and KM estimates. 
Health Outcomes  
TtD was calculated for each of the 9 LCSS items, ASBI, and LCSS total score. The KM method was used to 
estimate parameters for time-to-event analyses on each treatment arm. Hazard ratios for treatment effect 
and their 2-tailed 95% CIs were estimated using the Cox PH model stratified identically to the stratified 
log-rank tests. Mean change from baseline was estimated for the EQ-5D-5L index score and the VAS using 
longitudinal  mixed-model  repeated  measures  (MMRM)  regression  models.  Additional  analyses  may 
investigate for example pattern mixture models in case of missing data. 
Safety 
Safety analyses were performed on all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. 
An overview of AEs was produced that included TEAEs, treatment-emergent SAEs, and AEs leading to death 
or discontinuation of study treatment. Drug exposure and the following safety-related outcomes were also 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/647625/2019 
Page 35/88 
 
  
  
analysed:  AESIs,  dose  adjustments, 
laboratory  results,  vital  signs,  electrocardiograms,  and 
hospitalizations. Treatment-emergent adverse events were summarized by MedDRA Version 21.1 by system 
organ class (SOC) and PT (any grade and grade ≥3) and by maximum CTCAE grade 1-5. The incidence and 
percentage of patients with at least 1 occurrence of a PT were included by the most severe NCI-CTCAE v4.0 
grade. Causality (relationship to study drug) as assessed by the investigator was summarized. Laboratory 
results  were  graded  according  to  NCI-CTCAE  v4.0,  when  applicable.  Additionally,  AE  summaries  were 
presented for selected subgroups including age, sex, and race. 
Exploratory Biomarker Research  
Liquid biopsy EGFR T790M analyses were conducted in patients who had disease progression by data cut-
off and had post-progression next-generation sequencing results from the 30-day follow-up. The observed 
T790M mutation rates and the associated 95% CI were reported for each treatment group. The statistical 
significance of the difference in the T790M mutation rate between treatment groups was assessed using 
Fisher’s exact test. 
Multiplicity 
Interim OS was only to be tested if PFS is statistically significant (hierarchical testing). Type I error control 
over  the  interim  and  final  OS  analysis  at  2.5%  one-sided  was  to  be  achieved  via  Haybittle  Peto  type 
spending function (i.e., 0.0001 at the interim analysis). Apart from the above efficacy interim analysis, one 
safety interim and one futility interim analyses are planned. The safety interim analysis will be performed 
after the first 50 treated patients completed 3 cycles or discontinued from all study  therapies due to any 
reason  prior  to  3  cycles.  A  non-binding  futility  and  safety  interim  analysis  will  be  performed  after 
approximately  107  investigator-assessed  PFS  events  were  observed.  As  guidance,  an  IDMC  may 
recommend stopping the trial for futility if the p-value of the stratified log-rank test for PFS is >0.39 (this 
corresponds to approximately a HR >0.95 under a Cox PH model).

Recruitment 
Part  B  was  conducted  at  106  study  sites,  of  which  100  sites  randomised  patients  across  13  countries 
(Canada,  Germany,  Spain,  France,  United  Kingdom,  Greece,  Hong  Kong,  Italy,  Japan,  Korea,  Romania, 
Turkey, Taiwan, United States). Date first patient randomised was 28 January 2016 and date last patient 
randomised was 1 February 2018.   
As of the data cut-off date for the primary PFS analysis (23 January 2019) the median time of follow-up 
was 20.7 months (range, 0.1-35.4). 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations:   
Table 14 summarizes important protocol deviations. The number of patients who had at least one important 
protocol deviation was similar between treatment arms (22.3% in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm vs. 
17.8% in the placebo plus erlotinib arm). 
The most common protocol deviations were due to: 
- 
- 
use of prohibited concomitant medications (4.9% in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 2.2% 
in the placebo plus erlotinib arm).  
incorrect stratification of patients (4.5% in the  ramucirumab plus erlotinib  arm and 4.0%  in the 
placebo plus erlotinib arm); 16 patients out of 19 were misstratified for the EGFR testing method,

failure to suspend or dose reduce next study drug dose that could have significantly compromised 
patient safety (2.7% in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 2.2% in the placebo plus erlotinib 
arm), and 
patients who remained on study and on study therapy after PD (1.3 % in the ramucirumab plus 
erlotinib arm and 2.7% in the placebo plus erlotinib arm). 
These  protocol deviations were not  likely to have  affected the analyses  or conclusions presented in this 
report.

Protocol amendments:  
The original protocol was approved on 11 December 2014 and amended 6 times. According to the applicant, 
no changes to the protocol were made based on knowledge of unblinded data. 
The important changes and rationale for the changes made to this protocol were as follows: 
-  Revised the statistical assumptions for both the ramucirumab plus erlotinib and placebo plus erlotinib 
arms  in  part  B  based  on  emerging  data  from  recent  first-line  erlotinib  studies  in  EGFR  mutation-
positive  NSCLC  (Soria  et  al.  2018),  meta-analysis  of  individual  patient  data  from  6  randomised 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

controlled trials (Lee et al. 2017), and real-world evidence (Okamoto et al. 2018). The data showed 
that the placebo plus erlotinib arm may perform better than the initially assumed median PFS of 9.5 
months. As a result, the median PFS assumption for the placebo plus erlotinib arm was increased to 
11 months. As reported by Reck et al. (2018), data from the small, single-arm, open-label, phase 1b 
part  (part  A)  of  this  study  showed  a  median  PFS  of  17.1  months.  Consequently,  the  median  PFS 
assumption for the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm was increased from approximately 13 months to 
15.5  months.  Under  the  assumption  of  exponential  PFS,  this  translated  to  an  HR  of  0.71,  and 
therefore the HR was reduced to reflect the revised statistical assumptions from 0.72 to 0.71. 
-  Removed the efficacy interim PFS analysis that was to occur at 224 PFS events due to regulatory 
feedback. 
-  The previous number of events planned for primary analysis was 320. Under the revised assumption 
of an HR equal to 0.71 and no interim analyses, 270 events are sufficient to ensure at least 80% 
power to show superiority of the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm over the placebo plus erlotinib arm 
with a 1-sided type 1 error rate of 0.02499. 
An interim futility analysis was conducted at 114 investigator-assessed PFS events (data cut-off date 16 
October  2017),  and  the  IDMC  recommended  the  trial  continue  without  modification.  A  nominal  1-sided 
alpha <0.00001 was spent in order to maintain type-I error. 
Changes in the statistical analysis plan made after the first patient (31 May 2018 and 13-Dec-2018) was 
included but before the primary PFS analysis were: 
Primary analysis:  
- 
- 
reduction of number of event from 320 to 270, which was based on external studies.  
Removal of PFS interim analysis (planned at 224 events) 
-  Updated rules for determining date of progression or censor 
- 
Clarification that stratification factors will be drawn from the interactive web response system 
PFS2 and OS analyses for patients who received osimertinib after disease progression vs those do not, and 
sensitivity analyses for PFS. Added a sensitivity analysis for primary PFS without censoring for either missed 
visits or new anticancer therapy. 
Furthermore added were:  
-  additional analyses (additional age groups including the 75 age subgroup, liver-metastases subgroup, 
time-to-brain  metastases,  exposure,  summary  of  TEAEs  by  narrow  scope  standardized  Medical 
Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA)  queries  (SMQs)  and  preferred  term  (PT)  ),  updates 
(selected concomitant medications), clarification of wording (‘protocol deviation’ instead of ‘protocol 
violation’), definitions (dose modification, immunogenicity-related variables and a sensitivity analysis 
of ORR/DCR/DOR based on independent assessment. 
-  Part C is an open-label, 2-period, single-arm, exploratory cohort that was added to the main protocol 
(I4T-MCJVCY [JVCY]) and is only applicable to sites in the East Asian region, including Japan (see 
protocol addendum 9.2, approved on 23 May 2018): objectives, analysis populations, analysis plan, 
interim analyses were added. No results from part C were included in the CSR.

Baseline data 
Generally, the patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics of patients in the ITT population 
were balanced between treatment arms (Table 15). As is typical of randomised trials, small differences 
were observed between arms in terms of some baseline characteristics. 
The median age was 65 years (range, 27 to 86 years) in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 64 years 
(range, 23 to 89 years) in the placebo plus erlotinib arm. Most patients in both treatment arms were female 
(62.9% vs. 63.1%), approximately 75% were Asian (76.8% vs. 77.3%), approximately 60% were never-
smokers (59.8% vs. 61.8%), and all had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1.

Numbers analysed 
The ITT population, defined in Table 16, included 449 randomised patients, including 224 randomised to 
the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 225 randomised to the placebo plus erlotinib arm. 
Primary and secondary efficacy analyses were performed on the ITT population (with allocation of patients 
to treatment arms considered as “randomised”). Selected efficacy parameters were analysed using the PP 
population. 
Table 16 defines the PP population, which consisted of 437 patients in the ITT population (216 patients in 
the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 221 patients in the placebo plus erlotinib arm). These patients did 
not have pre-specified criteria violations as defined in Table 16. 
The safety population included 446 patients: 221 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 225 
patients in the placebo plus erlotinib arm.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: Progression-free survival 
RELAY met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients 
who received ramucirumab plus erlotinib compared with placebo plus erlotinib. Table 17 summarizes PFS 
data and Figure 13 displays the Kaplan-Meier plot of PFS for the ITT population.

Secondary endpoints: overall survival 
The OS results are immature with 79 deaths and a censoring rate of more than 80% (data maturity, 17.6%). 
However, no detrimental effect on OS has been observed with ramucirumab plus erlotinib as shown by the 
stratified HR (95% CI) of 0.832 (0.532, 1.303). Table 18 summarizes interim OS data and Figure 14 displays 
the KM plot of OS for the ITT population.

Secondary endpoints: Objective Response Rate, Disease Control Rate and Duration of Response 
Table 19 presents a summary of ORR and DCR for the ITT population. Both ORR (CR + PR) and DCR (CR + 
PR + SD) were similar between treatment arms (76.3% vs. 74.7% and 95.1% vs. 95.6%, respectively). 
Independently-assessed ORR and DCR were 68.7% and 96.3% in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 
61.9% and 95.5% in the placebo plus erlotinib arm, respectively.

Table 19. 
Objective Response Rate and Disease Control Rate ITT Population 
The median DoR was longer in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm than in the placebo plus erlotinib arm 
(18.0 months [95% CI: 13.9-19.8] vs. 11.1 months [95% CI: 9.7-12.3]; p=0.0003).  
The independently-reviewed DoR was 13.73 months in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 8.38 months 
in the placebo plus erlotinib arm.  
Secondary endpoints: Time to Objective Response (CR+PR): 
There was no difference  of median time to  an objective response  between treatment arms; the median 
time to objective response was 1.4 months (range: 0.9 to 21.9 months) in both treatment arms. 
Secondary endpoints: Patient-Reported Outcomes: 
Overall patient compliance for completion across all time points was high for both measures, with rates of 
95.7% in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 96.7% in the placebo plus erlotinib arm for the LCSS and 
96.1% in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 96.6% in the placebo plus erlotinib arm for the EuroQol- 
5-dimension, 5-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L). 
At baseline, compliance for LCSS completion was 96.4% and 96.9% for the ramucirumab plus erlotinib and 
placebo plus erlotinib arms, respectively, and EQ-5D-5L completion was 97.3% in both treatment arms. 
At the 30-day safety follow-up visit, compliance for the LCSS was 74.4% in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib 
arm  and  79.1%  in  the  placebo  plus  erlotinib  arm,  and  compliance  for  the  EQ-5D-5L  was  74.4%  in  the 
ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 79.7% in the placebo plus erlotinib arm. 
The  number  of  expected questionnaires  to  be  completed  at  each  scheduled  assessment  decreased  over 
time as the number of patients discontinuing from therapy increased. 
LCSS Results 
Individual LCSS item scores indicated no differences in time to deterioration (TtD) by treatment arm with 
95% CIs including 1 for all scores except hemoptysis (blood in sputum) (HR = 1.987 [95% CI: 1.206-
3.275]) (Figure 15).

Time to deterioration in the LCSS total score (HR = 0.962 [95% CI: 0.690-1.343]) and the ASBI did not 
differ between treatment arms (HR = 1.012 [95% CI: 0.732-1.400]) 
Figure 15.  Forest plot for time to deterioration for Lung Cancer Symptom Scale, ITT population 
EQ-5D-5L Results 
Mean scores for the index and VAS were generally similar between treatment arms and within arms over 
time,  with  the  exception  of  apparent  lower  scores  in  both  arms  at  the  30-day  short-term  follow-up 
assessment, which is not unexpected given that  patients had  progressed at  that time. Minimal  changes 
from baseline were observed in the scores at the subsequent study visits. Analysis of changes from baseline 
in the index score and VAS revealed no overall differences in health status between treatment arms. 
Exploratory endpoints: Progression-free survival 2  
Table 20 summarizes the pre-specified, exploratory post-progression endpoint of PFS2. PFS2 encompasses 
PFS on both the initial treatment and subsequent treatment and measures continued impact through second 
progression.  
As of the data cut-off date (censoring rate 68.8%), 
- 
118 patients and 157 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib and placebo plus erlotinib arms, 
respectively,  had  disease  progression.  Of  these  patients,  61  patients  (51.7%)  and  79  patients 
(50.3%) had second progression events or died. 
-  Median PFS2 was not reached in either arm. The KM curves separate, favouring the ramucirumab 
plus erlotinib arm, with benefit maintained throughout the duration of follow-up (Figure 16).

Ancillary analyses 
PFS sensitivity analyses 
Table 22 summarizes the results of sensitivity analyses for the primary PFS analysis. Statistical significance, 
magnitude of treatment effect, and robustness of the main PFS analysis were all supported by the sensitivity 
analyses, as demonstrated by consistent HRs ranging between 0.580 and 0.671.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

A pre-specified blinded independent review of radiographic scans was conducted by the BIRC with respect 
to PFS assessment. Of the 449 randomised patients, 440 patients (217 in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib 
arm and 223 in the placebo plus erlotinib arm) were assessed. Per definition the patient were reviewed if 
baseline  and  at  least  one  post-baseline  tumour  assessment  scan  were  available.  Based  on  the  BIRC 
assessment, the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm experienced improved PFS, with a stratified HR of 0.671 
(95%  CI:  0.518-0.869)  similar  to  the  investigator-assessed  primary  analysis  (overlapping  95%  CI) 
supporting the robustness of the investigator-based statistical results and conclusions with respect to PFS. 
The median BIRC-assessed PFS was 16.5 months versus 11.1 months. The KM plot for the BIRC assessment 
is presented in Figure 18. 
The concordance rates were 80.6% in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 76.7% in the placebo plus 
erlotinib arm. Agreement between Investigator and BICR PFS is shown in Table 23.  
The analysis without censoring for missing 2 or more tumour assessments prior to PD/Death or receiving 
anticancer therapy is shown in Table 24.

Table 24: PFS by investigator without censoring for missing 2 or more tumour assessments prior to 
PD/Death or receiving anticancer therapy 
A  number  of  pre-specified  subgroup  analyses  of  PFS  were  performed  in  order  to  further  evaluate  the 
treatment effect. A PFS treatment benefit for the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm was consistently observed 
across all pre-specified patient subgroups (including regions, gender, smoking status and EGFR mutation 
type), except for patients ≥70 years of age. All other age subgroups, including ≥65, <75, and ≥75 years 
of age, favoured the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm. 
Figure 19 displays the Forest plot for PFS in the ITT population for all pre-specified subgroups.

Local EGFR Testing Method 
For the subgroups of patients by local EGFR testing method used for enrolment, a larger treatment effect 
was observed in patients whose tumours were tested by the EGFR testing method of Therascreen®/Cobas® 
test (HR = 0.397) compared with an Other test (HR = 0.873). The treatment-by-testing method interaction 
p-value was 0.0028. 
Pre-planned central testing was conducted during the study using the Therascreen® EGFR tissue assay on 
submitted archival tissue samples and did not inform patient eligibility and study enrolment. 
- 
Among  the  316  patients  (70%  of  the  ITT  population)  with  results  obtained  from  the  central 
Therascreen® testing, 305 patients (96%) had an EGFR activating mutation detected, corroborating 
the local EGFR testing results used for enrolment. It is expected that the lack of a positive EGFR 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/647625/2019 
Page 52/88 
 
  
  
 
central test result in the 11 patients is likely due to tissue heterogeneity and the different tissue 
sections used for central versus local testing. 
- 
Summarized by local testing method, activating EGFR mutations were detected centrally in 95% of 
tested patients who had been tested locally with a Therascreen®/Cobas® test, and in 97% of tested 
patients who had been tested locally with an Other test. 
The similar EGFR activating mutation positivity rates found by central testing between the 2 local testing 
method  subgroups,  indicates  that  the  difference  in  HRs  observed  between  patients  tested  locally  with 
Therascreen®/Cobas® vs. Other tests was not due to false positives from local assay variability. 
Additionally,  when  the  11  patients  were  removed  for  whom  an  EGFR  activating  mutation  could  not  be 
detected in the samples submitted and tested centrally, the HR was essentially the same as that within the 
full set of centrally tested patients. 
Further analyses of baseline characteristics and other factors did not identify an explanation for the PFS 
results for each testing method subgroup. 
When evaluating within geographical regions (Table 21), the differential HR by testing method was only 
observed in patients from East Asia (Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong). This relationship did not 
appear to exist in patients from the EU and North America, in whom similar PFS HRs were observed with 
patients tested either with the local therascreen/cobas EGFR testing method or other test. This is further 
supported by Figure 20 which provides the corresponding PFS curve by testing method for EU and North 
America.

Analyses of post-discontinuation Anticancer Therapy: 
The types of first subsequent therapy received were generally similar between treatment arms. Of those 
that received first subsequent therapy, approximately 24% of patients received chemotherapy and 73% 
received an EGFR TKI. The most common first subsequent EGFR TKI therapies received were erlotinib and 
osimertinib (Table 26).

The  most  common  second  subsequent  therapy  in  the  ramucirumab  plus  erlotinib  arm  were  EGFR  TKIs 
(54.0%) with osimertinib (41.3%) as the most common (Table 27). The most common second subsequent 
therapy in the placebo plus erlotinib arm was chemotherapy (56.6%) with platinum-based chemotherapy 
(38.2%) in particular.

Translational Research Analyses - EGFR T790M point mutation 
Among patients who had progressed by data cutoff, valid Guardant360 NGS results from central testing of 
liquid biopsies are available from 244 (89%) patients at baseline and from 190 (69%) patients at 30-day 
follow-up (Table 28). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/647625/2019 
Page 55/88 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Table 28: Patients with NGS results from baseline or 30-Day follow-up among patients whose tumours 
have progressed 
Table 29 shows rates of post-progression T790M from 30-day follow-up samples by treatment arm. Given 
that  different  criteria  are  applied  in  the  literature  to  define the population  for  this  type  of  analysis,  two 
approaches are presented. 
The first analysis in the table includes the population of patients who had central liquid biopsy NGS results 
showing that no T790M was detected at baseline. Patients who had NGS results at 30-day follow-up, but 
no NGS results available at baseline were excluded from the population. 
This analysis shows that the confirmed treatment-emergent T790M rates are similar between treatment 
arms (25% ramucirumab plus erlotinib, 30% placebo plus erlotinib, p=0.492). 
Many tumours do not shed circulating tumour DNA into the blood, and the quantity of circulating tumour 
DNA appears to be related to the tumour burden. Therefore, the second analysis in Table 29 includes only 
those patients for whom an activating EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or L8585R) was detected in the 
30-day follow-up sample, thereby indicating that the patient’s tumour was shedding DNA and suggesting 
that the liquid biopsy is also likely to detect T790M if it is present in the tumour. This analysis also found 
similar T790M rates between treatment arms (43% ramucirumab plus erlotinib, 47% placebo plus erlotinib, 
p=0.849). 
Table 29: Post-progression EGFR T790M rates from the 30-Day follow-up liquid biopsy sample analysed by 
two population definitions for sensitivity

Page 56/88 
 
  
  
 
 
The relationship between number of treatment cycles received and EGFR T790M emergence based on the 
currently available data is shown in Figure 21. Cumulative T790M rates for patients who had progressed by 
Cycles 12, 24, and 72 were 10%, 13%, and 25% for the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 19%, 27%, 
and  30%  for  the  placebo  plus  erlotinib  arm.  The  cumulative  incidence  of  T790M  rates  suggests  that 
combination of ramucirumab with erlotinib may delay the emergence of this resistance mechanism, but did 
not change the post-progression T790M rate. Note that these patients constitute the set of patients who 
had progressed by the time of data cut-off, and therefore include many of the patients with the shorter 
progression times on the trial.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of ramucirumab plus erlotinib is based on a single pivotal trial (RELAY).  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal trial supporting this extension of indication is RELAY, a global, multicentre, randomised, placebo-
controlled, double-blind, phase 1b/3 study. The double-blind design is considered adequate to investigate 
whether the addition of ramucirumab to erlotinib improves efficacy. The applicant mentions that there was 
no anticipated or identified toxicity of ramucirumab that would potentially unblind investigators to treatment 
assignment. This is not fully agreed, as it is possible that common adverse events specific to ramucirumab 
(e.g. hypertension, epistaxis) could have unblinded investigators. Even so, this is not apparent from other 
results, including BIRC-assessed PFS, which support the primary analysis. Patients were randomised 1:1 
between the 2 treatment arms and 4 stratification factors were used. The study design is in accordance 
with  scientific  advice  sought 
in  2014  on  key  study  design  elements 
for  study  RELAY 
(EMEA/H/SA/1505/7/2014/II). 
Patients were selected based on ‘classical’ activating mutations (exon 19 and L858R), which occur in 90% 
of the patients with an EGFR mutation (Gazdar. Oncogene. 2019). This is similar to other procedures of 
EGFR-tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  (TKIs),  like  for  instance  Vizimpro  (EMEA/H/C/004779/0000)  or  Tagrisso 
(EMEA/H/C/004124/II/0019). Nevertheless, EGFR TKIs have a broader indication, namely ‘‘EGFR activating 
mutations’’  (refer  to  Tarceva  [erlotinib]  SmPC).  The  reason  for  this  is  that  efficacy  of  the  EGFR-TKIs  is 
extrapolated to patients with tumours bearing other (less common) mutations (EMEA/H/C/004779/0000). 
Both erlotinib and ramucirumab (in combination with docetaxel), as well as erlotinib plus bevacizumab and 
other EFGR-TKIs, are approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC. 
In the RELAY study, only patients with metastatic NSCLC were allowed to enrol in the study; this is reflected 
in the proposed indication. Next, only patients with an ECOG performance status of 0-1 were included in 
the study. Real world data show that patients with an ECOG performance status of ≥1 can still be treated 
with an EGFR inhibitor (Schuette et al. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers. 2015, Li et al. PLoS one. 2019), but 
patients  with  ECOG  score  ≥2  were  excluded  from  the  pivotal  studies  of  ramucirumab  in  all  indications. 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC adequately reflects that studied patients had an ECOG performance status of 0-1. 
Also, patients with EGFR-positive NSCLC may have CNS metastases. It is appropriately mentioned in section 
5.1 of the SmPC that patients with CNS metastases were excluded in RELAY. Lastly, the exclusion of patients 
with a T790M mutation is understandable, as resistance to some EGFR inhibitors (e.g. erlotinib) is caused 
by this mutation (Saito et al. The Lancet. 2019). Overall,  the key inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria of the 
RELAY study were acceptable. 
Current  treatment  guidelines  recommend  the  use  of  EGFR-TKIs  as  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with 
advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC (Planchard et al. Ann of Oncol. 2018). The ESMO guideline for 
metastatic  NSCLC  does  not  define  which  of  the  currently  approved  EGFR-TKIs  is  the  preferred  first-line 
treatment option. At the time the RELAY study was initiated, erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib were the only 
approved treatment options for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. Scientific advice was sought in 2014 and 
the  CHMP  agreed  upon  the  choice  of  comparator  for  study  RELAY  (EMEA/H/SA/1505/7/2014/II),  i.e. 
erlotinib (in combination with placebo). 
The  selection of  the  ramucirumab  10  mg/kg  Q2W  dosing  regimen in  the  RELAY  study  was  based  on  an 
integrated  assessment  of  previously  available  clinical  data.  The  applicant  considered  that  the  totality  of 
clinical  data  indicated  that  there  may  an  opportunity  to  further  enhance  efficacy  of  ramucirumab  while 
maintaining an acceptable safety profile. Using the same 10 mg/kg dose as used in study REVEL the Cmax 
level should not be significantly increased (mitigate potential Cmax-related toxicity), but the more frequent 
dosing  interval  (every  2  weeks  instead  of  every  3  weeks)  should  produce  higher  overall  exposure 
(potentially enhancing efficacy). Also, study I4T-MC-JVCY (RELAY) included a phase 1b safety lead-in (part 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/647625/2019 
Page 59/88 
 
  
  
A)  to  determine  the  tolerability  of  ramucirumab  10  mg/kg  Q2W.  One  patient  experienced  a  grade  3 
increased alanine aminotransferase in the DLT-evaluable population (n=12). Based on these findings, the 
assessment committee recommended initiation of part B (phase 3) of study RELAY with the ramucirumab 
dose and schedule of 10 mg/kg Q2W in combination with erlotinib 150 mg once daily, which is understood 
and agreed.  
PFS as primary endpoint is in accordance with scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/1505/7/2014/II). The CHMP 
agreed  with  PFS  as  primary  endpoint,  given  the  expected  long  post-progression  survival.  The  CHMP 
recommended that PFS2 should also be measured (PFS2 was included as an exploratory endpoint in the 
RELAY  study).  PFS  is  not  an  uncommon  primary  endpoint  in  studies  investigating  EGFR-TKIs  in  EGFR-
positive  NSCLC.  For  example,  the  pivotal  trial  supporting  marketing  authorisation  of  bevacizumab  plus 
erlotinib as first-line treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC had PFS as primary endpoint 
(EMEA/H/C/000582/II/0086). The primary definition of PFS (censoring for missed visits and start new anti-
cancer  therapy)  is  not  the  one  recommended  by  EMA  (EMA/CHMP/27994/2008/Rev.1),  but  the  EMA 
recommended analysis is included as one of the sensitivity analysis. Secondary endpoints include overall 
survival, tumour response rate, which are relevant secondary endpoints.  
In general, protocol deviations were unlikely to have had an impact on the efficacy analyses. Remarkably, 
the  percentage  of  patients  receiving  prohibited  concomitant  medication  was  twice  as  high  in  the 
ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm compared to the placebo plus erlotinib arm. Of the prohibited concomitant 
medications, proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) were most frequently administered. The use of proton-pomp 
inhibitors could potentially influence the efficacy of erlotinib (drugs affecting gastric pH decrease erlotinib 
plasma  concentrations).  Upon  request  for  supplementary  information  the  applicant  informed  that  any 
concomitant PPI use was captured as a protocol deviation (35 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib 
arm and 28 patients in the placebo plus erlotinib arm), and if continued for 14 days or longer it was defined 
as an important protocol deviation. Of the 16 patients summarised with important deviations due to use of 
prohibited concomitant medications, 10 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 2 patients in 
the placebo plus erlotinib arm were treated with  PPIs for 14 days or longer. The use  of PPI was similar 
between both treatment arms (although more patients were treated with PPIs for 14 days or longer in the 
ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm), and hence it is unlikely that efficacy results were impacted by concomitant 
PPI use. .However, relatively few patients received prohibited concomitant medications and given that more 
patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm received prohibited medications, this would not be in favour 
of  this  treatment  arm.  Important  changes  to  the  protocol  were  made  during  the  sixth  amendment 
(amendment  f),  which  included  a  revision  of  the  sample  size  (see  discussion  in  the  next  paragraph  - 
statistical assumptions). The reason for this amendment was emerging data from first-line use of erlotinib 
and published data from the phase 1b of study RELAY (Reck et al. Clinical Lung Cancer. 2018) indicating 
that the assumed median PFS for both erlotinib (monotherapy) and ramucirumab plus erlotinib was likely 
underestimated.  
Several protocol amendments were made. Addition of PFS2 as an explorative endpoint (amendment a) and 
measures  to  secure  independent  central  review  of  tumour  scans  and  prevent  statistical  bias  due  to 
informative  censoring  (amendment  b)  are  considered  adequate.  Update  of  the  guidance  regarding 
prohibited  and  restricted  concomitant  CYP3A4  inducers  or  inhibitors  (amendment  d)  to  allow  use  of 
moderate CYP3A4 inducers (with any appropriate dose adjustments per the erlotinib package insert) is also 
considered adequate. 
Changes in the primary analysis included removal of PFS interim analysis, which is agreed as such analyses 
are  discouraged  (EMA/CHMP/27994/2008/Rev.1).  Also,  rules  for  determining  date  of  progression  or 
censoring were updated, and the number of events was reduced from 320 to 270. Given the double blind 
design, it is considered unlikely that these decisions were informed by results from part b of study RELAY. 
Moreover, as for the updating of PFS censoring rules, there is consensus about which censoring rules to 
apply (EMA/CHMP/27994/2008/Rev.1). For the sample size revision, external data and data from the phase 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/647625/2019 
Page 60/88 
 
  
  
1b part of study RELAY indicated that the assumed median PFS for both arms was likely underestimated. 
Given all these considerations, type I error is unlikely to be affected by the changes in the primary analysis. 
An interim futility analysis was conducted at 114 investigator-assessed PFS events (data cut-off date 16 
October 2017) with a nominal 1-sided alpha <0.00001 spent in order to maintain type-I error and the IDMC 
recommending the trial continue without modification. For a futility aim, spending type I error had not been 
needed per se, but it is unlikely to have affected main conclusions from the trial. The statistical methods 
are considered otherwise standard and adequate.  
Demographic and other baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment arms. Most patients in 
both treatment arms were female (62.9% vs. 63.1%), approximately 75% were Asian (76.8% vs. 77.3%), 
approximately 60% were never-smokers (59.8% vs. 61.8%). This is not surprising, since these patients 
are more likely to have an EGFR mutation (Zhang et al. Oncotarget. 2016).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  primary  endpoint  of  the  study  was  met.  Treatment  with  ramucirumab  in  combination  with  erlotinib 
resulted in a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to placebo in combination with erlotinib 
(stratified HR = 0.591 [95% CI: 0.461-0.760]; p<0.0001). A gain of 7 months in median PFS was obtained 
with  the  addition  of  ramucirumab  to  erlotinib  (19.4  months  vs  12.4  months).  The  Kaplan-Meier  curves 
separated at approximately 3 months and remained separated during the following months. The primary 
PFS  analysis  was  supported  by  the  sensitivity  analyses.  The  EMA  recommended  PFS  analysis  (i.e. 
investigator  assessed,  not  censoring  for  new  anti-cancer  therapy  or  missed  visits)  was  in  favour  of 
ramucirumab with erlotinib (stratified HR=0.609 [95%-CI: 0.478, 0.776], median 19.35 vs 12.39 months). 
Moreover,  possibly  informative  censoring  reasons  (no  follow-up  or  withdrawal  consent:  2.2  vs  0.8%) 
occurred little. Therefore, the results from the EMA preferred analysis (investigator-assessed PFS) seems 
quite  robust  against  informative  censoring.  Agreement  between  blinded  independent  review  committee 
(BIRC) and investigator-assessed PFS was similar between arms (80.6% [ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm] 
and 76.7% [placebo plus erlotinib arm]) in the applicant’s primary analysis, but the nature of disagreement 
seems  different  between  experimental  and  control  arm.  In  the  control  arm,  investigators  but  not  BICR 
observed progression twice as much compared to the opposite (16.1% vs 7.2%), while in the experimental 
arm  this  occurred  equally  frequent  (9.7%).  The  applicant  mentions  that  this  was  likely  due  to  random 
chance. This can be agreed, as importantly, both the primary PFS analysis and the BIRC-assessment of PFS 
show a consistent treatment effect in favour of the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm..  
Subgroup  analyses  show  that  all  subgroups  favoured  the  ramucirumab  plus  erlotinib  arm,  except  for 
patients ≥70 years of age. The applicant explains that this is driven by a small number of patients between 
the age of 70 and 75 and was likely due to chance. Another observation from the subgroup analyses was 
that a larger treatment effect was found in the subgroup Therascreen®Cobas® compared to the subgroup 
others. This is a remarkable finding, and could not be explained by the applicant. Results of central EGFR 
testing (to confirm results by local testing) were available for 70% of the ITT population. Of the 30% (133 
patients) without central tissue EGFR results,  the majority (n=110) did not submit samples of sufficient 
quantity and/or quality. For the remaining patients, there were other reasons for the absence of central 
tissue EGFR results, such as patients that did not sign the optional tumour tissue consent in countries were 
mandatory  tumour  collections  is  not  allowed.    The  available  data  showed  that  central  EGFR  testing 
confirmed the results of local testing.  Even so, the applicant had conducted additional analysis, and an 
apparent difference by EGFR testing method appeared to be present in the geographic region of East Asia. 
The Applicant could not identify any explanation for this observation. Consistent HRs by testing method 
were observed for the EU and North America (0.68 [95% CI: 0.36, 1.28) vs 0.51 [95% CI: 0.21, 1.21]), 
which reassures that the overall results are representative for the EU/North America region. There were 
mostly Asian patients enrolled in Relay. However, the point estimate for the PFS hazard ratios indicate no 
difference in treatment effect between race (Asian vs Caucasian). This is in line with the previously agreed 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/647625/2019 
Page 61/88 
 
  
  
notion that there are no relevant differences in EGFR activating mutations (exon 19 deletions and L858R) 
in tumours of Asian and Caucasian NSCLC patients (EMEA/H/C/000582/II/0086). 
It is mentioned in the guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man that, if PFS is 
the primary endpoint, overall survival as secondary endpoint should ensure that there is no relevant impact 
on survival (EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.5). The interim analysis OS did not show a detrimental effect on OS 
(KM  curves  currently  overlap;  HR=0.832  [95%  CI:  0.532,  1.303]).  This  finding  is  in  line  with  the 
expectations of combining an angiogenesis inhibitor with an EGFR-TKI, as similar was seen for bevacizumab 
plus erlotinib in previously untreated EGFR-positive NSCLC (EMEA/H/C/000582/II/0086). However, at the 
data  cut-off  date,  only  79  events  occurred  and  OS  data  was  not  mature  (data  maturity,  17.6%).  It  is 
anticipated that the pre-specified final OS analysis will likely be conducted end of Q2 2023. The applicant 
is recommended to submit the results, once available. 
ORR and DCR were similar between arms, but treatment with ramucirumab plus erlotinib result in a longer 
median  duration  of  response  compared  to  placebo  plus  erlotinib  (extending  the  time-to-progression), 
supporting the primary endpoint. Thus, combining  a VEFGR inhibitor with an EGFR inhibitor results in a 
longer duration of response, delaying progression. There are some discrepancies between the investigator-
assessed  and  BIRC-assessed  ORR,  especially  in  the  percentage  of  patients  having  a  complete  response 
(1.3% vs 7.4 % for ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 0.9% vs 4.9% in the placebo plus erlotinib arm, 
respectively). Despite these discrepancies, the BIRC numerically favoured the ramucirumab plus erlotinib 
arm. 
Quality  of  life  (QoL)  was  measured  with  two  patient-reported  outcome  measures  in  the  RELAY  study. 
Unfortunately, an a priori specification of the expected effect (e.g., improvement, maintenance) was not 
included in the protocol, and it is not clear whether the applicant expected an improvement in QoL or no 
deterioration  in  QoL.  QoL  analyses  did  not  show  any  difference  between  treatment  arms,  except  for 
haemoptysis. Of interest is the time to deterioration for blood in sputum or haemoptysis. Especially taken 
into account the careful selection of patients in regard of risk for haemorrhagic complications of the disease 
or treatment and that haemoptysis did not seem to be a disease symptom of concern at baseline (OC). The 
applicant mentions that patient-reported symptoms, symptom burden, and overall quality of life (QoL) data 
indicated no significant detriment from the addition of ramucirumab to erlotinib. However, it is questioned 
whether these patient-reported outcome measures are sensitive enough to determine whether the addition 
of ramucirumab to erlotinib does not have a detrimental impact on quality of life. The LCSS focusses on the 
effect of treatment on symptom control, and how this effects quality of life and activity status (Hollen et al. 
Eur J Cancer. 1993) and the EQ-5D values health (in mobility, self- care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
and  anxiety/depression)  (Herdman  et  al.  Qual  Life  Res.  2011).  The  influence  of  the  additional  toxicity 
caused by the addition of ramucirumab to erlotinib (treatment-related symptoms) on the QoL is not directly 
evaluated with these instruments, nor the influence of additional clinical visits necessary for ramucirumab 
administration. The latter would also be difficult to assess, as the RELAY study was placebo-controlled and 
both arms were administered ramucirumab or placebo (hence had additional clinical visits). Overall, the 
interpretability of the QoL results and therefore their clinical relevance is unclear. Besides, in the case it is 
expected  that  a  drug  improves  PFS,  a  delay  time  to  deterioration  is  expected  (improvement  in  time  to 
deterioration), as progression might worsen lung cancer symptoms. This means that no improvement with 
this instrument is not necessarily considered a favourable effect.  
The tumour resistance profile can be affected by therapy, and might be of relevance for the activity of next-
line  therapies  (guideline  on  the  evaluation  of  anticancer  medicinal  products  in  man).  Progression-free 
survival 2 was an exploratory endpoint of the RELAY study. The initial and updated PFS2 analyses (8 months 
follow-up) favoured the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm, indicating that there is no negative impact on next 
line treatment by ramucirumab. The post-progression survival of patients with EGFR-positive NSCLC is long, 
and it is reassuring that the treatment benefit seems to be maintained after second progression, based on 
these preliminary results.

Based  on  Guardant  NGS  data,  the  rates  of  treatment-emergent  EGFR  T790M  were  similar  between 
treatment  arms,  suggesting  that  subsequent  treatment  with  agents  targeting  this  EGFR  mutation  will 
remain viable options in the next line of disease care.  
Limited data were available (limited number of events) for the remaining exploratory endpoints (time to 
deterioration in ECOG PS, time to diagnosis of CNS metastases), and no conclusion could be made at this 
moment.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Treatment  with  ramucirumab  in  combination  with  erlotinib  resulted  in  a  significant  improvement  in  PFS 
compared to placebo in combination with erlotinib. Median DoR and PFS2 favoured the ramucirumab plus 
erlotinib arm, supporting the primary endpoint. Overall survival data (data maturity, 17.6%) suggest no 
detrimental effect on OS and final overall survival data should be submitted to the agency for conformation 
of the preliminary results.   
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety of ramucirumab plus erlotinib was based on a global, multicentre, phase 1b/3 study (RELAY). 
The safety lead-in (part A) of study RELAY was to determine the safety and tolerability of ramucirumab 10 
mg/kg  Q2W  plus  erlotinib  150  mg  QD.  One  dose  limiting  toxicity  (grade  3  increased  alanine 
aminotransferase [ALT]) was observed in part A and the randomised phase 3 portion of the study (part B) 
with ramucirumab at 10 mg/kg Q2W in combination with erlotinib (150 mg QD) was initiated. Given that 
only a few patients were treated in part A  of  study  RELAY (n=14), the most relevant  safety  results are 
those  observed  in  part  B.  Especially  as  this  part  of  the  study  enables  to  identify  the  added  toxicity  of 
ramucirumab  in  addition  to  erlotinib  due  to  the  placebo-controlled  design  of  this  part  of  the  study. 
Therefore, the safety section will only focus on part B of study RELAY.   
Patient exposure 
A summary of drug exposure for ramucirumab or placebo is given in Table 31. The RELAY safety population 
consisted of 221 patients who received at least 1 dose of study therapy in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib 
arm and 225 patients in the placebo plus erlotinib arm. In the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm, the median 
duration of therapy was 11.0 months for ramucirumab and 14.1 months for erlotinib. In the placebo plus 
erlotinib arm, the median duration of treatment was 9.7 months for placebo and 11.2 months for erlotinib. 
The median relative dose intensity was similar between arms.

bRelative dose intensity (%) is calculated as (actual amount of drug taken / amount of drug planned per protocol) * 100. 
c Patient is considered to have received a week of therapy after receiving at least 7 doses of erlotinib, either partial or complete. 
Dose Adjustments 
The  number  of  patients  with  a  dose  adjustment  of  ramucirumab  or  placebo  included  dose  delays,  dose 
reductions,  or  dose  omissions  is  depicted  in  Table  32.  Dose  adjustments  of  erlotinib  included  dose 
reductions or dose omissions. Dose delays for erlotinib were not captured on the eCRF. Overall, a higher 
percentage  of  patients  experienced  ramucirumab  dose  adjustments  compared  with  placebo.  A  higher 
percentage of patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm compared with the placebo plus erlotinib arm 
had erlotinib dose adjustments (dose reductions and dose omissions). A higher number of patients receiving 
ramucirumab experienced dose  adjustments (76 vs 59.1%), dose  reduction (10.4 vs 1.8%), dose  delay 
(66,5 vs 53,8%) and dose omissions (28,1 vs 12.4%). Overall the most dose adjustments were due to AEs 
(TEAEs discussed below). 
The proportion of patients experiencing dose adjustment for ramucirumab or placebo between age group 
< 65 years of age was 79.4 vs 54.4% and ≥65-year-old 73.1 vs 64.0%. These were most common due to 
proteinuria, hypertension, cytopenia, increased ALAT or increased bilirubin. In the subgroup of patients < 
70 years of age dose adjustment for ramucirumab or placebo were 79.6 vs 56% compared to patients ≥ 
70-year old 67.2 vs 67.8%. 
Dose  adjustments  for  ramucirumab  were  also  more  common  in  male  compared  to  female  patients, 
respectively 79.3 vs 55.4% and 74.1 vs 61.3%. The differences were smaller in case of geographic region 
and race.

All  patients  in  both  arms  reported  at  least  1  TEAE.  The  incidence  of  grade  ≥3  TEAEs  was  higher  in  the 
ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm than the placebo plus erlotinib arm (71.9% vs. 53.8%). The incidence of 
any-grade  SAEs  was  higher  in  the  ramucirumab  plus  erlotinib  arm  than  the  placebo  plus  erlotinib  arm 
(29.4% vs. 20.9%).

placebo plus erlotinib arm, the majority of the differences in incidence rates were observed in low-grade 
events (grades 1 and 2), with the exception of hypertension, for which the difference in incidence between 
arms was driven equally by low-grade and grade ≥3 events. In addition to hypertension, the other specific 
grade ≥3 TEAEs in ≥5% of patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and with a 2-percentage point 
or higher incidence than in the placebo plus erlotinib arm were dermatitis acneiform and diarrhoea.

arm  with  any  higher  incidence  in  the  ramucirumab  plus  erlotinib  arm  compared  with  the  placebo  plus 
erlotinib arm.  
The most common any-grade TEAEs, with at least a 20% incidence in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm, 
and  observed  at  a  higher  incidence  (at  least  a  5-percentage  point  difference)  in  the  ramucirumab  plus

Of  the  any-grade  TEAEs  occurring  with  ≥20%  incidence  in  the  ramucirumab  plus  erlotinib  arm, 
hypertension, proteinuria, epistaxis, and peripheral oedema were observed with at least twice the incidence 
than in the placebo plus erlotinib arm. The overall incidence of TEAEs leading to the discontinuation of all 
study treatment was similar in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm (12.7%) and the placebo plus erlotinib 
arm (10.7%). A higher percentage of patients discontinued ramucirumab alone due to TEAEs than placebo 
alone (73 patients [33.0%] vs. 34 patients [15.1%], respectively). The most common TEAEs (occurring in 
at  least  5  patients  in  the  ramucirumab  plus  erlotinib  arm)  reported  in  patients  who  discontinued 
ramucirumab or placebo alone and continued treatment with erlotinib, in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib 
arm versus placebo plus erlotinib arm, respectively, were: 
proteinuria (19 patients [8.6%] vs. 0%) 
hyperbilirubinemia (13 patients [5.9%] vs. 15 patients [6.7%])

Grade ≥3 TEAEs 
A higher percentage of patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm (71.9%) reported grade ≥3 TEAEs 
compared with the placebo plus erlotinib arm (53.8%). The difference between the 2 treatment arms was 
predominantly due to the higher rate of grade 3 events in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm than the 
placebo plus erlotinib arm (64.3% vs. 49.3%, respectively). Grade 3 hypertension, reported in 23.5% of 
patients, made the largest single contribution by PT to grade≥3 TEAEs in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib 
arm. Grade ≥3 TEAEs occurring in ≥5% of patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and at a higher 
incidence (at least a 2-percentage point difference) than in the placebo plus erlotinib arm were: 
- hypertension (only grade 3 events) (23.5% vs. 5.3%) 
- dermatitis acneiform (only grade 3) (14.9% vs. 8.9%) 
- diarrhoea (only grade 3 events) (7.2% vs. 1.3%) 
The incidence of grade 4 TEAEs was similar between treatment arms (ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm: 11 
patients  [5.0%];  placebo  plus  erlotinib  arm:  9  patients  [4.0%]).  The  most  commonly-reported  grade  4 
TEAEs were ALT increased (2 [0.9%] vs. 3 [1.3%]) and hepatic function abnormal (2 [0.9%] vs. 2 [0.9%]). 
Adverse events of interest 
Adverse Events of Interest for Erlotinib 
This section details selective adverse events of interest for erlotinib, including interstitial lung disease (ILD), 
skin  reactions,  diarrhoea,  and  nail  disorders  for  which  it  was  clinically  relevant  to  assess  any  potential 
additional toxicity in the context of ramucirumab used in combination with erlotinib. These  events were 
chosen for evaluation based upon medical judgment on the clinical relevance in the target population and/or 
potential overlapping toxicities between ramucirumab and erlotinib. 
The Adverse Events of Interest for erlotinib were ILD, skin reactions, diarrhoea, and nail disorders for which 
it was clinically relevant to assess any potential additional toxicity in the context of ramucirumab used in 
combination with erlotinib. 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) 
Any-grade ILD  was reported in  4 patients (1.8%) in the  ramucirumab  plus erlotinib arm and 7 patients 
(3.1%) in the placebo plus erlotinib arm. Grade ≥3 ILD occurred in 1 patient (0.5%) in the ramucirumab 
plus erlotinib arm and 3 patients (1.3%) in placebo plus erlotinib arm. There were no grade 4 events in 
either treatment arm. One patient (0.4%) in the placebo plus erlotinib arm experienced a grade 5 (fatal) 
ILD  event  which  occurred  30  days  after  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  and  was  assessed  by  the 
investigator as related to study treatment. Three patients (1.3%) discontinued all study treatment due to 
ILD in the placebo plus erlotinib arm. One patient in each treatment arm discontinued erlotinib alone due 
to ILD while continuing ramucirumab alone. No patients discontinued ramucirumab or placebo alone due to 
ILD while continuing erlotinib.  
Skin Reactions 
To evaluate the potential impact of ramucirumab on skin toxicity (including rash) associated with erlotinib, 
relevant TEAEs from the SOC Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders were chosen to create the composite 
term  “skin  reactions”.  Except  for  the  higher  incidence  of  grade  ≥3  dermatitis  acneiform  (14.9%)  in  the 
ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm compared with the placebo plus erlotinib arm (8.9%), no other relevant 
differences  in  skin-related  TEAEs  were  identified  between  treatment  arms.  In  the  race  subgroups,  for 
ramucirumab-treated  patients,  a  higher  incidence  of  any-grade  and  grade  ≥3  dermatitis  acneiform  was 
observed in Asian patients compared to non-Asian patients (any grade: 77.6% vs. 33.3%, respectively; 
grade ≥3: 18.2% vs. 3.9% [all grade 3 events], respectively).

Diarrhoea  
The incidence of diarrhoea of any grade was similar in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm (70.1%) and the 
placebo plus erlotinib arm (71.1%), with the majority of events being grade 1 in severity in both treatment 
arms (48.4% vs. 52.9%, respectively). The incidence of grade ≥3 diarrhoea was higher in the ramucirumab 
plus erlotinib arm than the placebo plus erlotinib arm (7.2% vs. 1.3%, respectively; all grade 3 events). 
No grade 4 or 5 events occurred in either treatment arm. The use of antidiarrheal medications as supportive 
treatment was similar in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and the placebo plus erlotinib arm (58.8% vs. 
56.0%, respectively). 
Nail Disorders  
To  fully  evaluate  the  potential  impact  of  ramucirumab  on  nail  toxicity  (including  paronychia)  associated 
with erlotinib, relevant TEAEs from the SOC Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders were chosen to create 
the  composite  term  “nail  disorders”.  The  incidence  of  any-grade  and  grade  ≥3  nail  disorders  (including 
paronychia) was similar in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm (any grade: 56.6%; grade ≥3: 4.1%) and 
the placebo plus erlotinib arm (any-grade: 55.6%; grade ≥3: 3.1%). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest for ramucirumab 
The following AEs are considered to be AESIs for ramucirumab: IRRs, hypertension, proteinuria, arterial 
thromboembolic events (ATEs), venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), bleeding/haemorrhagic events, GI 
perforation, congestive heart failure (CHF), wound healing complications, fistula, liver failure/liver injury, 
and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS). No RPLS events were observed in this 
study. The AESI are shown in Table 35.

Infusion-Related Reactions, including Hypersensitivity and Anaphylactic Reactions  
Immediate hypersensitivity reactions utilized the following SMQs and PT search criteria to collect relevant 
events: Anaphylactic reaction SMQ, Hypersensitivity SMQ, Angioedema SMQ, PT IRR, PT Cytokine release 
syndrome. The incidence of any-grade IRRs was low and similar in both treatment arms (ramucirumab plus 
erlotinib arm: 2.7%; placebo plus erlotinib arm: 1.8%). No Grade ≥3 IRR occurred during the study.

Hypertension  
The incidence of any-grade and grade ≥3 hypertension was higher in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm 
compared with the placebo plus erlotinib arm (any grade: 45.2% vs. 12.0%; grade ≥3: 23.5% vs. 5.3%, 
respectively).  No  grade  4  or  5  hypertension  events  occurred  in  either  treatment  arm.  Of  any-grade 
hypertension  events,  56.4%  had  recovered  or  were  resolving  at  the  data  cut-off  date.  There  was  no 
association  between  hypertension  and  negative  clinical  outcomes  in  terms  of  cardiovascular  or 
cerebrovascular complications. Twelve patients (12%) had ramucirumab dose delays due to hypertension, 
the majority (8 patients) of whom  had only  1 dose delay. There were no dose  reductions and 1 patient 
(1.0%)  had  a  dose  omission  of  ramucirumab  due  to  hypertension.  No  patients  discontinued  all  study 
treatment due to hypertension. One patient in each treatment arm discontinued ramucirumab or placebo 
alone due to hypertension. The most commonly used antihypertensive agents in both treatment arms were 
calcium  channel  antagonists  and  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors  (ACEIs)  or  angiotensin  II 
receptor blockers (ARBs), followed by diuretics: 
• 
ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm: calcium channel antagonists (49.8%); ACEIs or ARBs (48.9%); 
and diuretics (22.2%). 
• 
placebo  plus  erlotinib  arm:  calcium  channel  antagonists  (24.9%);  ACEIs/ARBs  (26.7%);  and 
diuretics (7.1%)  
Proteinuria  
A higher incidence of any-grade proteinuria was observed in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm (34.4%) 
than in the placebo plus erlotinib arm (8.4%). Most proteinuria events were low grade in severity (grade 2 
in ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and grade 1 in the placebo plus erlotinib arm). Grade ≥3 proteinuria was 
reported  in  6  patients  (2.7%)  (all  grade  3  events)  and  only  in  the  ramucirumab  plus  erlotinib  arm.  No 
patients experienced nephrotic syndrome. There was 1 SAE of grade 3 proteinuria in the ramucirumab plus 
erlotinib  arm.  Proteinuria  was  the  most  common  TEAE  leading  to  dose  adjustments  of  ramucirumab 
occurring in 27 patients (12.2%) (dose reduction: 8.1%; dose delay: 7.2%; and dose omission: 6.8%). 
There  were  no  dose  adjustments  of  placebo  or  erlotinib  due  to  proteinuria.  Of  the  76  patients  in  the 
ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm who experienced one or more treatment-emergent proteinuria events, the 
majority  (48  patients  [63.2%])  experienced  1  event,  and  47  patients  (61.8%)  experienced  no  dose 
adjustments  of  ramucirumab  or  all  study  treatment  discontinuation  due  to  proteinuria.  The  majority  of 
proteinuria  events  (77.3%)  had  recovered  by  the  data  cut-off.  Additional  analyses  showed  that  the 
occurrence  of  treatment-emergent  proteinuria  was  associated  with  AESI  hypertension.  There  was  no 
association between proteinuria and renal failure. In the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm, 2 patients (0.9%) 
discontinued all study treatment due to grade 2 proteinuria. No patients discontinued all study treatment 
due to proteinuria in the placebo plus erlotinib  arm. In the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm, 19 patients 
(8.6%),  including  all  patients  with  grade  3  proteinuria  (urine  protein  ≥3.5  g/24  hours),  discontinued 
ramucirumab alone due to proteinuria and continued erlotinib therapy. No patients discontinued placebo or 
erlotinib alone due to proteinuria. 
Thromboembolic Events 
Arterial Thromboembolic Events (ATE) 
The incidence of any grade ATEs was 0.9% in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm. No ATE occurred in the 
placebo  plus  erlotinib  arm.  One  grade  3  myocardial  infarction  was  reported  in  the  ramucirumab  plus 
erlotinib. 
Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE) 
Any grade VTE were observed in 7 patients (3.2%) in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm compared to 9 
patients (4.0%) in the placebo plus erlotinib arm and grade ≥3 occurred in 3 patients (1.4%) vs. 5 patients 
(2.2%), respectively. No Grade 4 or 5 events were observed.

Bleeding/Haemorrhagic Events 
A  higher  incidence  of  any-grade  bleeding/haemorrhage  events  was  observed  in  the  ramucirumab  plus 
erlotinib arm compared with the placebo plus erlotinib arm (54.8% vs. 26.2%, respectively). The overall 
difference between arms was primarily driven by low-grade (grade 1-2) events of epistaxis. No difference 
was observed in the incidence of grade ≥3 bleeding events between treatment arms (1.8% in both arms). 
The incidence of grade 1-2 gingival bleeding was higher in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm compared 
with the placebo plus erlotinib arm (8.6% vs. 1.3%). No grade ≥3 gingival bleeding occurred in either arm.  
A higher incidence of any-grade pulmonary haemorrhage was observed in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib 
arm compared with the placebo plus erlotinib arm (15 patients [6.8%] vs. 4 patients [1.8%], respectively). 
The  difference  in  incidence  was  primarily  driven  by  grade  1  haemoptysis  in  10  patients  (4.5%).  The 
incidence of grade ≥3 pulmonary haemorrhage was low and  similar between treatment  arms (0.5% vs. 
0.4%). One treatment-related grade 5 event of haemothorax occurred in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib 
arm which was assessed by the investigator as related to study treatment.  
A  higher  incidence  of  any-grade  GI  haemorrhage  was  observed  in  the  ramucirumab  plus  erlotinib  arm 
compared to the placebo plus erlotinib arm (23 patients [10.4%] vs. 6 patients [2.7%], respectively). The 
difference  in  incidence  was  driven  by  low  grade  (grade  1  and  2)  events.  The  incidence  of  grade  ≥3  GI 
haemorrhage was low and similar between treatment arms (1.4% vs. 0.4%). One treatment-related grade 
4 small intestinal haemorrhage occurred in  the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm. There were no grade  5 
events  in  either  treatment  arm.  Dose  adjustments  of  ramucirumab  or  placebo  due  to  bleeding  or 
haemorrhage were reported in 11 patients (5.0%) versus 4 patients (1.8%), respectively. 
The rate of discontinuation of all study treatment due to bleeding/haemorrhage events was low and similar 
between  treatment  arms.  Bleeding/haemorrhage  was  associated  with  anaemia  in  the  ramucirumab  plus 
erlotinib  arm.  Transfusion  support  (including  packed  red  blood  cells  and  platelets)  was  provided  to  8 
patients (3.6%) in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm versus none in the placebo plus erlotinib arm.  
Gastrointestinal Perforation 
One  patient  (0.5%)  in  the  ramucirumab  plus  erlotinib  arm  reported  a  grade  2  GI  perforation  event  (PT 
appendicitis perforated), which was assessed by the investigator as related to study treatment. 
Congestive Heart Failure 
Per protocol, ramucirumab was to be discontinued for grade 3 or grade 4 events consistent with congestive 
heart failure (CHF). Congestive heart failure was reported in 4 patients (1.8%) in the ramucirumab plus 
erlotinib arm compared to 1 patient (0.4%) in the placebo plus erlotinib arm. Two patients (0.9%) in the 
ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm experienced  grade 3  CHF events (PTs cardiac failure and cardiac failure 
congestive)  leading  to  discontinuation  of  ramucirumab  treatment,  and  risk  factors  for  acute  coronary 
syndrome and cardiac failure was identified in 1 of these patients. 
Wound Healing Complications 
The overall incidences of wound healing complications were similar and low in both treatment arms. Two 
patients (0.9%) experienced grade 1 wound complication (PT) in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 
1 patient (0.4%) in the placebo plus erlotinib arm experienced grade 1 impaired healing (PT). No patients 
experienced grade ≥3 wound healing complications. 
Fistula 
One (0.5%) grade 1 oral cavity fistula and one (0.5%) grade 3 tracheoesophageal fistula were reported in 
the ramucirumab arm plus erlotinib. No events of fistula occurred in the placebo plus erlotinib arm. There 
were no SAEs and neither TEAEs was assessed by the investigator as related to study treatment.

Liver Failure/Liver Injury 
Treatment-emergent  AEs  of  liver  failure/liver  injury  including  both  clinical  and  laboratory  terms  were 
identified based on the Standardized MedDRA Query for hepatic disorder. The incidence of any-grade liver 
failure/liver  injury  events,  including  clinical  and  laboratory  events,  was  higher  in  the  ramucirumab  plus 
erlotinib  arm  than  in  the  placebo  plus  erlotinib  arm  (63.3%  vs.  53.3%,  respectively).  The  difference 
between treatment arms was due to the higher incidence of laboratory-related TEAEs in the ramucirumab 
plus erlotinib arm compared to the placebo plus erlotinib arm (61.5% vs. 49.3%, respectively), primarily 
driven  by  grade  1  and  2 events  of  ALT  and  AST  increased.  The  incidence  of  grade  ≥3  liver  failure/liver 
injury events, including ALT and AST increased, was similar between the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm 
(14.0%) and the placebo plus erlotinib arm (12.4%). The incidence of clinical TEAEs of liver failure/liver 
injury events was similar in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and the placebo plus erlotinib arm (any 
grade: 4% vs. 5.3%; grade ≥3: 3.2% vs. 3.1%, respectively).  
Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome 
No reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome events were observed in this study. 
Neutropenia and infections 
In  addition  to  the  above  presented  AESIs,  given  the  known  risk  of  neutropenia  associated  with 
ramucirumab, it was relevant to assess the impact of neutropenia in terms of negative clinical outcomes, 
namely serious infection secondary to neutropenia. Evaluation of infection in the context of combination 
therapy  with  ramucirumab  plus  erlotinib  is  of  clinical  interest  given  the  documented  risk  of  infections 
associated  with  erlotinib  alone.  The  incidence  of  neutropenia  (consolidated  term)  was  similar  in  the 
ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and the placebo plus erlotinib arm.  
Neutropenia 
The incidence of any-grade and grade ≥3 neutropenia was similar in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm 
and the placebo plus erlotinib arm (any-grade: 12.7% vs. 8.0%; grade ≥3: 2.7% vs. 1.3%, respectively. 
One patient (0.5%) in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm had a grade 4 neutropenia. No patient in the 
placebo plus erlotinib arm experienced grade 4 neutropenia. One patient (0.5%) experienced grade 3 febrile 
neutropenia (non-serious event) in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm. There were no reports of SAEs of 
neutropenia  in  either  treatment  arm.  No  association  was  observed  between  treatment-emergent 
neutropenia or febrile neutropenia and the occurrence of treatment-emergent infection events. 
Infections 
The  incidence  of  any-grade  TEAEs  coded  to  the  SOC  Infections  and  Infestations  was  similar  in  the 
ramucirumab plus erlotinib and placebo plus erlotinib arm (80.5% vs.76.0%, respectively). The majority of 
events in both arms were low-grade infections (grade 1: 14.9% and grade 2: 48.4% in the ramucirumab 
plus erlotinib arm; grade 1: 18.7% and grade 2: 50.7% in the placebo plus erlotinib arm). The incidence 
of grade ≥3 infections in the Infections and Infestations SOC was higher in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib 
arm  compared  to  the  placebo  plus  erlotinib  arm  (17.2%  vs.  6.7%,  respectively).  Grade  4  and  grade  5 
infection TEAEs were reported only in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm. In the ramucirumab plus erlotinib 
arm, 38 patients experienced grade ≥3 infections. Of these 38 patients, 27 patients (71.1%) experienced 
1  event,  with  10  patients  (26.3%)  and  1  patient  (2.6%)  experiencing  2  events  and  3  or  more  events, 
respectively.  Of  the  38  patients  experienced  grade  ≥3  infections,  19  patients  (50%)  had  no  treatment 
changes (including dose adjustments of study drug or all treatment discontinuation) due to infection. Dose 
adjustments of study drug due to grade ≥3 infections were mainly erlotinib dose omissions in 13 patients 
(34.2%) and reductions in 8 patients (21.1%). Dose delays of ramucirumab were reported in 9 patients 
(23.7%). There were no dose reductions or dose omissions of ramucirumab. Dose adjustments due to grade 
≥3  infections  were  mainly  erlotinib  dose  omissions  in  9  patients  (60.0%).  The  majority  of  patients  (11 
patients [73.3%]) required treatment with at least 3 systemic antimicrobial agents. The majority of severe 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

infections  occurred  in  the  absence  of  concurrent  neutropenia  in  both  treatment  arms  (36  of  39  events 
[92.3%] in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm; and all 15 events in the placebo arm).  
Lower Respiratory Tract Infections 
In order to fully evaluate pulmonary infections in the NSCLC population, relevant TEAEs from the clinical 
database were chosen to create the composite term of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). The incidence 
of any-grade LRTI was similar between the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and the placebo plus erlotinib 
arm (14 patients [6.3%] vs. 13 patients [5.8%], respectively). The incidence of grade ≥3 LRTIs was higher 
(at least 2% difference) in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm compared to the placebo plus erlotinib arm: 
9  patients  (4.1%)  (including  two  grade  5  events  of  pneumonia  and  one  event  of  pneumonia  bacterial) 
versus 2 patients (0.9%), respectively.  
Pneumonia was the only grade ≥3 LRTI event reported with a higher (at least 2% difference) incidence in 
the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm than the placebo plus erlotinib arm (6 patients [2.7%] vs. 0%). One of 
the LRTIs reported in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm (pneumonia bacterial) occurred with concurrent 
neutropenia. There was no association between LRTI and neutropenia in either treatment arm.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
Table 37 provides an overview of SAEs occurring in at least 2 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib 
arm by MedDRA preferred term. A higher percentage of patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm than 
in the placebo plus erlotinib arm reported any-grade SAEs (29.4% vs. 20.9%) and grade ≥3 SAEs (22.6% 
vs. 15.6%). 
Table 37: SAEs occurring in at least 2 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm by MedDRA preferred 
term by decreasing frequency safety population 
Deaths 
The incidence of death was higher in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm than in the placebo plus erlotinib 
arm.  Eight  (3.6%)  patients  died  while  on  study  therapy  or  within  30  days  of  discontinuation  of  study 
treatment in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm.  
AEs  were  the  primary  cause  of  death  for  6  patients  (encephalitis  influenza,  haemothorax,  lymphoma, 
pneumonia, pneumonia bacterial, and renal failure). Three deaths were attributed to infection events, none 
of which were assessed as treatment-related. Two (0.9%) patients died while on study therapy or within 
30 days of discontinuation of study treatment in the placebo plus erlotinib arm. Both deaths were due to 
study  disease  (Table  38).  One  treatment-related  grade  5  event  of  haemothorax  occurred  in  the 
ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm which was assessed by the investigator as related to study treatment. 
The grade 5 TEAE of haemothorax that began on study Day 74 and ended on study Day 76. The patient 
was hospitalized on study Day 58 (14 days after the last dose of ramucirumab) with worsening dyspnoea 
and confusion, and diagnosed on CT thorax with a tracheoesophageal fistula associated with a right lower 
lobe  abscess  and  pleural  empyema.  The  patient  was  treated  with  thoracic  drainage  and  intravenous

antibiotics. Following initial clinical improvement, the patient’s condition deteriorated approximately 14 days 
later  due  to  pleural  haemorrhage  and  the  patient  died.  The  investigator  assessed  the  event  of  pleural 
haemorrhage as related to ramucirumab and not related to erlotinib.

Summary of deaths safety population 
Laboratory findings 
The assessments of analyses for haematology and serum chemistry laboratory toxicity shifts from baseline 
to worst grade post baseline  were  consistent with the AE data described earlier in  the sections adverse 
events and adverse events of special interest. Findings from analysis of laboratory shift tables for serum 
chemistry and haematology were consistent  with the  analyses  of TEAE data and the trends identified in 
TEAEs  of  anaemia,  neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia,  and  abnormal  laboratory  events  for  the  AESI  liver 
failure/liver  injury  as  described  in  adverse  event  section.  Regarding  immunological  events,  the  rates  of 
treatment-emergent (TE) ADAs were low in both study arms. No patients developed neutralizing antibodies 
against ramucirumab. 
Safety in special populations 
Additional analyses summarising TEAEs by subgroups, including age, gender, race, and geographic region 
are provided in Table 39. The incidence of ≥3 grade was slightly higher in patients ≥65 years. The Asian 
population was overrepresented in the study.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
A  drug-drug  interaction  (DDI)  sub  study  was  conducted  in  11  patients  to  support  this  submission  of 
ramucirumab in combination with erlotinib. The pharmacokinetics of erlotinib were not affected when co-
administered with ramucirumab. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The overall incidence of TEAEs leading to the discontinuation of all study treatment was similar in the 
ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm (12.7%) and the placebo plus erlotinib arm (10.7%). 
A higher percentage of patients discontinued ramucirumab alone due to TEAEs than placebo alone (73 
patients [33.0%] vs. 34 patients [15.1%], respectively). The incidence of TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of erlotinib alone due to TEAEs was low and similar between treatment arms 
(ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm: 3 patients [1.4%]; placebo plus erlotinib arm: 2 patients [0.9%]).  
Post marketing experience 
Ramucirumab (8 mg/kg, intravenously Q2W) was first authorised on 21 April 2014 in the US for use as a 
single agent for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic, gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma with 
disease progression on or after prior fluoropyrimidine- or platinum-containing chemotherapy. The European 
Commission granted a marketing authorisation in December 2014 for ramucirumab for the treatment of 
patients with advanced or metastatic, gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma with disease progression on or after 
prior  fluoropyrimidine-  or  platinum-containing  chemotherapy  in  combination  with  paclitaxel  and  as 
monotherapy for adult patients for whom treatment in combination with paclitaxel is not appropriate. 
Ramucirumab,  as  a  single  agent  or  in  combination  with  different  chemotherapy  regimens,  has  been 
approved in second-line gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, NSCLC, and CRC. 
The  latest  periodic  safety  update  report  (PSUR)/periodic  benefit  risk  evaluation  report  (PBRER)  from 
ramucirumab was completed in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E2C 
(R2)  format  and  summarised  safety  and  other  pertinent  data  arising  from  worldwide  sources  that  were 
received for the reporting period 22 April 2018 and 21 April 2019. Cumulatively, as of 21 April 2019, 10,491 
patients have been enrolled into the ramucirumab clinical program, of which approximately 6426 patients 
have  received  ramucirumab.  Cumulatively,  as  of  30  April  2019,  an  estimated  110,101  patients  have 
received  ramucirumab  worldwide.  The  PSUR/PBRER  review  confirmed  and  supported  the  previously 
established favourable benefit-risk profile for ramucirumab in the currently approved indications. 
No off-label use  events have been reported for  the use  of ramucirumab for the treatment of metastatic 
NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Ramucirumab is currently approved in combination with docetaxel in NSCLC. Erlotinib is currently approved 
in NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations either as monotherapy or in combination with bevacizumab. Both 
drugs have a known safety profile.  
Regarding  patient  exposure,  the  median  duration  of  ramucirumab  treatment  was  longer  than  that  of 
placebo  (11.04  vs  9.66  months);  and  similarly,  the  duration  of  erlotinib  treatment  was  longer  in  the 
ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm than in the placebo plus erlotinib arm (14.13 vs 11.20 months). The median 
relative  dose  intensities  of  each  study  drug  were  consistent  with  the  targeted  dose  and  similar  in  both 
treatment arms.  
Any-grade TEAEs leading to ramucirumab or placebo dose adjustments occurring at a higher incidence 
(≥  5% difference) in the ramucirumab  plus erlotinib  arm compared with the placebo plus erlotinib arm, 
respectively, were proteinuria and platelet count decreased. Proteinuria was the only grade≥3 TEAE leading 
to ramucirumab or placebo dose adjustments with a higher incidence (≥ 2% difference) in the ramucirumab 
plus erlotinib arm than the placebo plus erlotinib arm. The difference in dose adjustments for ramucirumab 
versus  placebo  was  completely  based  on  the  higher  proportion  of  patients  <70-year  old  needing  dose 
adjustments.  
The  adverse  event  profile  of  ramucirumab  or  erlotinib  as  monotherapy  is  different.  Therefore,  the 
combination treatment is expected to result in an overall higher incidence of AE. Common TEAEs observed 
at  a  higher  incidence  in  the  ramucirumab  plus  erlotinib  arm  than  in  the  placebo  plus  erlotinib  arm, 
respectively,  were  adverse  events  known 
to  be  associated  with 
ramucirumab, 
including 
bleeding/haemorrhage events, hypertension, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Additionally, 
ramucirumab  increased  the  incidence  and/or  severity  of  specific  known  toxicities  of  erlotinib,  including 
hepatic laboratory events (ALT and AST increased), alopecia, dermatitis acneiform, and diarrhoea.  
Grade 3 events occurring ≥5% and at a higher incidence (at least a 2-percentage point difference) were 
hypertension,  dermatitis  acneiform  and  diarrhoea.  The  higher  incidence  of  dermatitis  acneiform  in  the 
ramucirumab  plus  erlotinib  arm  was  not  expected,  as  it  is  a  specific  AE  of  erlotinib.  Further  evaluation 
revealed that there is currently insufficient evidence to support a causal association between ramucirumab 
and dermatitis acneiform due to the lack of biological plausibility, no increase in rates of other skin toxicities 
in ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm compared to the placebo plus erlotinib arm in RELAY and the absence of 
a consistent trend towards an increased incidence of any-grade or grade ≥3 rash in the ramucirumab arm 
versus  the  placebo/comparator  arm  in  previously  completed  phase  3  studies.    Therefore,  based  on  the 
totality of the data, it is agreed with the MAH that dermatitis acneiform is not considered to be an ADR for 
ramucirumab  in  combination  with  erlotinib  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  metastatic  NSCLC  with 
activating EGFR mutations. A higher percentage of patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm than in 
the  placebo  plus  erlotinib  arm  had  an  any-grade  serious  adverse  event  and  grade  ≥3  SAE. 
Hospitalizations due to AEs were higher in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm than in the  placebo plus 
erlotinib arm. 
The incidence  of infections was high in both treatment groups. The majority of the infections were low-
grade infections. The incidence of grade ≥3 infections in the infections and infestations SOC was higher in 
the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm compared to the placebo plus erlotinib arm., i.e. 38 patients [17.2%] 
vs. 15 patients [6.7%], respectively. These infections were not associated with concurrent neutropenia. A 
difference of +1.3% percentage point in the incidence of grade ≥3 infections was seen in the REVEL study 
of ramucirumab and docetaxel versus docetaxel and placebo in NSCLC (EMA/CHMP/69093/2016). Infections 
of  grade  ≥3  occurred  in  4%  in  the  erlotinib  group  and  in  2%  in  the  placebo  group  in  the  erlotinib 
monotherapy  versus  placebo  in  the  BR.21  phase  III  trial  of  erlotinib  in  NCSLC.  Based  on  the  notable 
imbalance in the incidence of grade ≥3 infections between the experimental and control arms in RELAY, the 
clinical significance of such events, the recognised association between other VEGF pathway inhibitors and 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/647625/2019 
Page 77/88 
 
  
  
infections, it is agreed that the totality of the data provides a reasonable suspicion of the causal association 
between ramucirumab and the development of infections. Infections is therefore included as an ADR for 
ramucirumab in combination with erlotinib in Section 4.8 of the SmPC.   
The incidence of any-grade and grade ≥3 hypertension was higher in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm 
compared  with the  placebo  plus  erlotinib  arm.  Hypertension  was  manageable with  medication  and  dose 
delays. Of any-grade hypertension events, 56.4% had recovered or were resolving at the data cut-off date. 
No association was found between hypertension and negative clinical outcomes in terms of cardiovascular 
or cerebrovascular complications. 
Hypertension,  mucocutaneous  bleeding,  thromboembolic  events,  and  proteinuria  are  known  on  target 
adverse  events  of  VEGFR-inhibitors.  A  higher  incidence  of  any-grade  bleeding/haemorrhage  events  was 
observed in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm compared with the placebo plus erlotinib arm. The overall 
difference between arms was driven by low-grade events of epistaxis. No difference was observed in the 
incidence  of  grade  ≥3  bleeding  events  between  treatment  arms.  The  incidence  of  grade  ≥3  pulmonary 
haemorrhage  was  low  and  similar  between  treatment  arms.  One  treatment-related  grade  5  event  of 
haemothorax occurred in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm which was assessed by the investigator as 
related  to  study  treatment.  A  higher  incidence  of  any-grade  GI  haemorrhage  was  observed  in  the 
ramucirumab  plus  erlotinib  arm  compared  to  the  placebo  plus  erlotinib.  The difference  in incidence  was 
driven  by  low  grade  events.  The  incidence  of  grade  ≥3  GI  haemorrhage  was  low  and  similar  between 
treatment arms. 
Most proteinuria events were low grade in severity. The majority of proteinuria events had recovered by 
the data cut-off. Additional analyses showed that the occurrence of treatment-emergent proteinuria was 
associated with AESI hypertension.  
The adverse drug reactions proposed by the applicant to be included in the SmPC include infections and 
alopecia. Hair growth stimulated by VEGF may be related to improved follicular vascularisation or a direct 
effect on hair follicle DPCs via VEGF Receptor 2 expressed on DPCs.  Due to the synergistic effect of VEGF 
and EGFR on normal hair development, combined inhibition of both the VEGF and EGFR pathways might be 
expected to increase the risk of alopecia in patients receiving both ramucirumab and erlotinib compared to 
erlotinib alone.  This may in part explain the higher incidence of alopecia in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib 
arm  compared  to  the  placebo  plus  erlotinib  arm  in  RELAY.  The  incidence  of  death  was  higher  in  the 
ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm than in the placebo plus erlotinib arm. Eight (3.6%) patients died while on 
study therapy or within 30 days of discontinuation of study treatment in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib 
arm. Three deaths were attributed to infection events, none of which were assessed as treatment-related. 
As mentioned above, one treatment-related grade 5 event of haemothorax occurred in the ramucirumab 
plus erlotinib arm which was assessed by the investigator as related to study treatment. 
Regarding  laboratory  findings,  the  assessments  of  analyses  for  haematology  and  serum  chemistry 
laboratory toxicity shifts from baseline to worst grade post-baseline were consistent with the available AE 
data.  
Regarding the safety in special populations, the AE profile within gender subgroups between treatment 
arms was consistent with that observed in the overall safety population (gender subgroups male n=165 
and  female  n=281).  Independent  of  treatment  arm,  a  higher  proportion  (≥  5%  difference)  of  female 
patients compared to male patients experienced grade ≥3 laboratory hepatic events, primarily driven by 
grade  3  ALT  and  AST  increased.  The  AE  profile  within  race  subgroups  between  treatment  arms  was 
consistent  with  the  overall  safety  profile  in  the  safety  population.  Independent  of  treatment  arm,  the 
incidence of grade ≥3 TEAEs and SAEs was higher (at least a 5%) in patients ≥65 years than <65 years. 
There was a trend towards higher incidences of specific TEAEs and AESIs in patients ≥65 years compared 
to patients <65 years, however, most differences in the incidences were observed in low-grade (grade 1-
2) events, except for hypertension. This is somewhat contra dictionary to the observed higher incidence of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/647625/2019 
Page 78/88 
 
  
  
dose  adjustments  due  to  AEs  for  the  younger  patient  population  receiving  ramucirumab  compared  to 
placebo.  In  patients  ≥70 years,  the  incidences  of  grade  ≥3  TEAEs  and  SAEs  were  higher  (at  least  a  5-
percentage point difference) in the ramucirumab plus placebo arm compared to the placebo plus erlotinib 
arm (grade ≥3 TEAEs: 81.3% vs. 55.9%; any-grade SAEs: 40.6% vs. 27.1%, respectively). The difference 
in incidence of grade ≥3 TEAEs and SAEs between patients <70 years of age and patients ≥70 years of age 
is  adequately  reflected  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC.).  Regarding  immunological  events,  the  rates  of 
treatment-emergent  ADAs  were  low  in  both  study  arms.  No  patients  developed  neutralizing  antibodies 
against ramucirumab. 
The overall incidence of TEAEs leading to the  discontinuation of all study treatment was similar in the 
ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm (12.7%) and the placebo plus erlotinib arm (10.7%). A higher percentage 
of patients discontinued ramucirumab alone due to TEAEs than placebo alone (73 patients [33.0%] vs. 34 
patients [15.1%], respectively).  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Both  ramucirumab  and  erlotinib  have  already  approved  indications  in  NSCLC  and  their  safety  profile  is 
known. Overall, the AEs were in line with those expected for both study treatments. The additional toxicity 
due  to  the  addition  of  ramucirumab  to  erlotinib  was  considered  manageable.  Unexpectedly,  a  higher 
incidence  of  grade  ≥3  infections  was  observed  in  the  ramucirumab  plus  erlotinib  arm  compared  to  the 
placebo  plus  erlotinib  arm,  and  it  should  be  further  discussed  whether  there  is  a  relationship  between 
ramucirumab and infections. Additionally, a higher incidence of grade ≥3 dermatitis acneiform (an erlotinib-
specific adverse drug reaction) was observed in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm, which warrants further 
discussion.  One  death  due  to  haemothorax  was  considered  related  to  study  treatment  occurring 
approximately 6 days after thoracic drainage for a pleural empyema.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application was of the opinion that the risk 
management plan is acceptable. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. Particularly, a new warning with regard to higher incidence of grade ≥3 adverse events 
and all grade serious adverse events in patients aged 70 years and older, has been added to the product 
information. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The proposed text modifications to the package leaflet resulting from the addition of this new indication are 
minor  and  do  not  include  text  that  is  significantly  different  from  that  already  user  tested.  Overall,  the 
structure and design of the revised Cyramza Package Leaflet has not changed due to the new information 
and the revisions do not significantly affect the overall readability.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed new therapeutic indication for Cyramza in this procedure is: ‘‘Cyramza in combination with 
erlotinib is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer 
with activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations.’’  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
According  to  the  ESMO  guideline  for  metastatic  NSCLC,  first-line  treatment  options  for  patients  with 
metastatic  NSCLC  harbouring  an  EGFR-activating  (sensitising)  mutation  are:  gefitinib,  erlotinib  ± 
bevacizumab, afatinib, dacomitinib, osimertinib or gefitinib + carboplatin + pemetrexed (Planchard et al. 
Ann of Oncol. 2018). The latter (gefitinib + carboplatin + pemetrexed) is not authorised in the EU.  
With currently available EGFR TKIs, prognosis is improving, but remains poor as most patients eventually 
develop treatment resistance and will eventually experience disease progression on EGFR TKI therapy.  
Expanding the selection of first-line options available for the treatment of metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC 
would enhance the strategic possibilities of oncologists on how to use the available agents to provide the 
best  chance  of  long-term  PFS,  potentially  prolonging  time  on  targeted  therapy  and  postpone  cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The Applicant submitted a single pivotal clinical trial to support the extension of indication for Cyramza. 
Study JVCY (RELAY) was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 study that compared the efficacy 
and safety of treatment with erlotinib (150 mg daily) and ramucirumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) versus 
erlotinib  (150  mg  daily)  and  placebo  (10  mg/kg  every  2  weeks)  in  previously  untreated  patients  with 
metastatic NSCLC with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations. The ITT population 
consisted of 449 patients, 224 in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 225 in the placebo plus erlotinib 
arm. The primary endpoint of RELAY was PFS. Secondary endpoints were OS, ORR, DCR, DoR, PROs, safety 
and toxicity, PK and immunogenicity of ramucirumab, DDI substudy to assess the PK of erlotinib without 
ramucirumab. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
A statistically significant improvement in PFS (primary endpoint) was observed for patients who received 
ramucirumab  plus  erlotinib  compared  to  placebo  plus  erlotinib  (stratified  HR  =  0.591  [95%  CI:  0.461-
0.760]; p<0.0001). Median PFS was 19.4 months (95% CI: 15.4-21.6) in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib 
arm compared with 12.4 months (95% CI: 11.0-13.5) in the placebo plus erlotinib arm, representing a 7-
month gain in median PFS. The primary analysis was supported by various sensitivity analyses (HRs ranging 
between 0.580 and 0.671). A PFS treatment benefit for the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm was observed 
across  all  pre-specified  patient  subgroups.  No  detrimental  effect  on  OS  (secondary  endpoint)  has  been 
observed with ramucirumab plus erlotinib as shown by the stratified HR of 0.832 (95% CI: 0.532-1.303; 
median OS was not reached in either arm). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/647625/2019 
Page 83/88 
 
  
  
In spite of  similar ORR (76.3% vs 74.7%) and  DCR  (95.1% vs 95.6%) between arms, the median DoR 
(secondary endpoint) was longer in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm than in the placebo plus erlotinib 
arm (18.0 months [95% CI: 13.9-19.8] vs 11.1 months [95% CI: 9.7-12.3]).  
The updated HR for PFS2 (exploratory endpoint) remained in favour of the ramucirumab plus erlotinib 
arm compared to placebo plus erlotinib arm (HR = 0.755 [95% CI: 0.567, 1.006]). Median PFS2 was 
35.98 months (95% CI: 31.21, NR) for the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 29.17 months (95% CI: 
24.77, 37.82) for the placebo plus erlotinib arm. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The OS results were immature with 79 deaths and a censoring rate of more than 80% (data maturity, 
17.6%). However the PFS2 data are reassuring regarding the impact on post-progression treatment. In 
addition, the MAH is recommended to submit the final OS analysis by end of Q2 2023 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety analysis of ramucirumab in combination  with erlotinib in patients with  EGFR mutated NSCLC 
focussed on differences of the observed AEs of the combination arm compared with the erlotinib-placebo 
arm.  
The most common any-grade TEAEs, with at least a 20% incidence in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm, 
and  observed  at  a  higher  incidence  (at  least  a  5-percentage  point  difference)  in  the  ramucirumab  plus 
erlotinib arm compared with the placebo plus erlotinib arm, respectively, were: hypertension (45.2% vs. 
12.0%),  ALT  increased  (42.5%  vs.  31.1%),  AST  increased  (41.6%  vs.  25.8%),  stomatitis  (41.6%  vs. 
36.4%), alopecia (33.9% vs. 19.6%), proteinuria (33.9 vs. 8.4%), epistaxis (33.5% vs. 12.0%), nausea 
(25.8% vs. 19.6%), peripheral oedema (22.6% vs. 4.4%), cough (21.7% vs. 15.6%), and pyrexia (21.3% 
vs. 12.4%). 
A higher percentage of patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm (71.9%) reported grade ≥3 TEAEs 
compared with the placebo plus erlotinib arm (53.8%). Grade ≥3 TEAEs occurring in ≥5% of patients in 
the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and at  a higher incidence (at least a 2-percentage point  difference) 
than in the placebo plus erlotinib arm were: hypertension (23.5% vs. 5.3%), dermatitis acneiform (14.9% 
vs. 8.9%) and diarrhoea (7.2% vs. 1.3%).  
A higher percentage of patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm compared to the placebo plus erlotinib 
arm experienced grade ≥3 infections (38 patients [17.2%] vs. 15 patients [6.7%], respectively). There is 
a reasonable suspicion of a causal association between ramucirumab and the development of infections. 
A higher percentage of patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm than in the placebo plus erlotinib 
arm reported any-grade SAEs (29.4% vs. 20.9%).  
In patients ≥70 years, the incidences of grade ≥3 TEAEs and SAEs were higher  (at least a 5-percentage 
point difference) in the ramucirumab plus placebo arm compared to the placebo plus erlotinib arm (grade 
≥3 TEAEs: 81.3% vs. 55.9%; any-grade SAEs: 40.6% vs. 27.1%, respectively). This is adequately reflected 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
AEs leading to death while on study therapy or within 30 days of discontinuation of study treatment were 
reported only in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm in 6 patients (2.7%), of which 1 death was related to 
study treatment. In the placebo plus erlotinib arm, there were no deaths reported due to AEs during study 
treatment or within 30 days of treatment discontinuation. 
The  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  leading  to  the  discontinuation  of  all  study  treatment  was  12.7%  in  the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/647625/2019 
Page 84/88 
 
  
  
ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm and 10.7% the placebo plus erlotinib arm. A higher percentage of patients 
discontinued ramucirumab alone due to TEAEs than placebo alone (73 patients [33.0%] vs. 34 patients 
[15.1%], respectively). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The unfavourable effects are sufficiently characterised and routine pharmacovigilance activities are 
considered appropriate.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Treatment with ramucirumab plus erlotinib resulted in a statistically significant PFS improvement compared 
to  placebo  plus  erlotinib.  In  this  setting  (previously  untreated  patients  with  EGFR-positive  NSCLC), 
significantly  prolonging  progression  is  considered  clinical  relevant,  as  discussed  in  other  procedures  of 
EGFR-TKIs. Sensitivity analyses support the primary results and key subgroups favoured ramucirumab plus 
erlotinib.  Median  DoR  and  PFS2  favoured  the  ramucirumab  plus  erlotinib  arm,  supporting  the  primary 
endpoint. Moreover, although data were immature, no detrimental effect on overall survival was observed 
with the addition of ramucirumab to erlotinib. The applicant commits to submit the results to the EMA once 
available. 
A higher percentage of grade ≥3 TEAEs were reported in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib arm, but in general 
these events were manageable with dose  adjustments/discontinuations or medication. Given the similar 
discontinuation rate for all study treatment (13.1% versus 10.7%),  the addition of ramucirumab did not 
result in more frequent discontinuations of erlotinib.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  PFS  improvement  observed  with  ramucirumab  plus  erlotinib  is  considered  clinically  meaningful,  the 
current OS data and PFS2 data do not show a detrimental effect. The additional toxicity of ramucirumab to 
erlotinib is manageable.  
In conclusion, the benefit-risk balance for ramucirumab in combination with erlotinib as first-line treatment 
of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with activating epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) mutations is positive.

Reminders to the MAH 
1. 
In accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the Agency makes available a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product assessed by the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial 
marketing authorisation (MA) and is continuously updated during the lifecycle of the medicinal 
product. In particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the 
assessment report of the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to 
the authorisation, after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. 
Should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains commercially confidential 
information, please provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of 
commercially confidential information (CCI) in “track changes” and with detailed justification by 
27 December 2019. The principles to be applied for the deletion of CCI are published on the EMA 
website at https://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/regulatory-procedural-guideline/principles-be-
applied-deletion-commercially-confidential-information-disclosure-emea-documents_en.pdf. 
2. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version 
of Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
3. 
If the approved RMP is using Rev. 2 of the ‘Guidance on the format of the RMP in the EU’ and the 
RMP ‘Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan’ has been updated in the procedure, the MAH 
is reminded to provide to the EMA Procedure Assistant by Eudralink a PDF version of the ‘Part VI: 
Summary of the risk management plan’ as a standalone document, within 14 calendar days of the 
receipt of the CHMP Opinion. The PDF should contain only text and tables and be free of metadata, 
headers and footers. 
4. 
The MAH is reminded to submit an eCTD closing sequence with the final documents provided by 
Eudralink during the procedure (including final PI translations, if applicable) within 15 days after the 
Commission Decision, or prior to the next regulatory activity, whichever is first. For additional 
guidance see chapter 4.1 of the Harmonised Technical Guidance for eCTD Submissions in the EU.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Vyxeos is intended for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid 
leukaemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
AML is the most frequent form of leukaemia, accounting for approximately 25% of all leukaemias in adults in 
the Western world. The annual crude incidence of AML is 3.7 per 100000, and the number of new cases per 
year in European Union is estimated to be 18400. The estimated number of cases of AML in 2008 was 53486, 
and the prevalence after 5 years from diagnosis was 4.1 per 100000 (RARECARE 2016). 
The incidence of AML increases sharply with age, ranging from 1.8 cases per 100000 people aged under 65 
years of age to 17.6 cases per 100,000 people over 65 years of age. More than half of the subjects with 
newly diagnosed AML in developed countries are over 65 years of age, with a median age at diagnosis of 67, 
and AML is more common in men than in women. 
Overall, the 5-year survival rate for AML is 19%. The mortality rate strongly correlates with age: 5-year 
survival rates are 3% to 8% in patients aged 60 years and older compared with 5-year survival rates of up to 
50% for younger patients. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features/Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Acute myeloid leukemia is a biologically heterogeneous disease that can be classified into 3 distinct 
categories based on clinical ontogeny: de novo AML which arises in the absence of an identified exposure or 
prodromal stem cell disorder (like in MDS). Secondary AML (s-AML) represents transformation of an 
antecedent diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (AML-MRC) or myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), 
therapy-related AML (t-AML) develops as a late complication in patients with prior exposure to leukaemogenic 
therapies. Recently the presence several of several mutations (in SRSF2, SF3B1, U2AF1, ZRSR2, ASXL1, 
EZH2, BCOR, or STAG2) were found to be highly specific for the diagnosis of s-AML (1). 
High-risk AML constitutes a biologically distinct subset of disease and comprises a sizeable percentage of 
cases of adult AML. Based on retrospective review of large registries and given the lack of progress or 
variation in treatment over the past 25 years, a distinct profile of cytogenetic and molecular features can be 
used to assign risk. Although high-risk disease features cluster among clinical phenotypes, such as among 
patients over age 60, those with antecedent haematological disorders, and those who have received prior 
treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy, high-risk karyotype or the expression of mutated flt3, kit, and other 
molecular markers explain both the poor response to induction chemotherapy and the high relapse rate 
previously attributed to clinical variables alone.

EMA/486480/2018 
Page 10/103 
  
  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Acute myeloid leukaemia is a form of leukaemia – i.e., cancer of the white blood cells – characterised by 
infiltration of proliferative, clonal, abnormally differentiated, and occasionally poorly differentiated 
haematopoietic cells of myeloid lineage in the bone marrow, blood, and other tissues. 
In AML, leukaemic blasts replace normal blood cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood, which leads to 
anaemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. This is associated with symptoms of fatigue, shortness of 
breath, disturbed wound healing, infections and bleedings. If left untreated, AML results in death within a few 
weeks to months. 
AMLs are classified according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) classification from 2001, revised in 
2008 and in 2016 (2). The classification incorporates morphological criteria, cytogenetic data, molecular 
genetics, immunophenotype data and clinical information into a diagnostic algorithm to delineate clinically 
significant disease entities. 
The procedures used to diagnose and classify AML are: morphologic assessment of bone marrow specimens 
and blood smears (with ≥20% blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood being diagnostic of AML), 
analysis of the expression of cell-surface and cytoplasmic markers (by flow cytometry), identification of 
chromosomal findings (through cytogenetic testing), and screening for selected molecular genetic alterations. 
Following 2010 ELN recommendations several molecular markers are used as part of standard clinical 
practice for risk stratification (3): 
• 
• 
• 
Alterations in nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1); 
Alternations in CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA); and 
Alterations in Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). 
In addition to these three mutational screenings which are currently being used in routine practice, screening 
of several other mutations such as RUNX1, TP53, ASXL1 are proposed in the these current 2017 ELN 
recommendations. 
Prognostic factors in AML can be subdivided into those that are related to the patient and those that are 
related to the disease. Patient-associated factors (e.g., increasing age, coexisting conditions, and poor 
performance status) commonly predict treatment-related early death, whereas disease-related factors (e.g., 
white-cell count, prior myelodysplastic syndrome or cytotoxic therapy for another disorder, and leukaemic-
cell genetic changes including alterations in FLT3) predict resistance to current standard therapy. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Treatment should be planned with curative intent whenever possible. Intensive chemotherapy is divided into 
an induction phase and consolidation. Potential candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) 
must be identified early at diagnosis or during induction. For more than four decades, the combination of 
cytarabine (100 to 200 mg/m2/day) by continuous infusion on Days 1 through 7 together with daunorubicin 
(45 to 60 mg/m2) on Days 1 through 3 (known as 7 + 3 regimen) has comprised the backbone of induction 
therapy. For patients who respond to induction therapy, post-remission options comprise haematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or consolidation therapy (in the EU often with high-dose cytarabine). 
Although AML patients who receive HSCT generally have better outcome relatively few patients receive this 
potentially curative treatment because factors like older age, comorbidities, and toxicity of prior therapy 
prevent further treatment.

EMA/486480/2018 
Page 11/103 
  
  
In the EU (European Union), approved agents include decitabine (Dacogen) which is authorised for the 
treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary AML, according to the WHO 
classification, who are not candidates for standard induction chemotherapy. Azacitidine (Vidaza) is also 
authorised for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for HSCT with AML with 20-30 % blasts 
and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to WHO classification and AML with >30% marrow blasts according to 
the WHO classification. In addition, histamine dihydrochloride (Ceplene) is authorised for adult patients with 
AML in first remission concomitantly treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2). Midostaurin (Rydapt) is authorised in 
combination with standard daunorubicin and cytarabine induction and high dose cytarabine consolidation 
chemotherapy followed by midostaurin single agent maintenance therapy for adult patients with newly 
diagnosed AML who are FLT3 mutation positive. Finally, Mylotarg is authorised in combination therapy with 
daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (AraC) for the treatment of patients age 15 years and above with 
previously untreated, de novo CD33 positive AML, except acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). 
About the product 
Vyxeos is a liposomal formulation of a fixed combination of daunorubicin and cytarabine in a 1:5 molar ratio. 
The 1:5 molar ratio has been shown in vitro and in vivo to maximise synergistic antitumour activity in AML 
(SmPC, section 5.1). 
Daunorubicin has antimitotic and cytotoxic activity, which is achieved by forming complexes with DNA, 
inhibiting topoisomerase II activity, inhibiting DNA polymerase activity, affecting regulation of gene 
expression, and producing DNA-damaging free radicals (SmPC, section 5.1). 
Cytarabine is a cell cycle phase-specific antineoplastic agent, affecting cells only during the S-phase of cell 
division. Intracellularly, cytarabine is converted into cytarabine-5-triphosphate (ara-CTP), which is the active 
metabolite. The mechanism of action is not completely understood, but it appears that ara-CTP acts primarily 
through inhibition of DNA synthesis. Incorporation into DNA and RNA may also contribute to cytarabine 
cytotoxicity. Cytarabine is cytotoxic to proliferating mammalian cells in culture (SmPC, section 5.1). 
Vyxeos liposomes exhibit a prolonged plasma half-life following intravenous infusion, with greater than 99% 
of the daunorubicin and cytarabine in the plasma remaining encapsulated within the liposomes. Vyxeos 
delivers a synergistic combination of daunorubicin and cytarabine to leukaemia cells for a prolonged period of 
time. Based on data in animals, Vyxeos liposomes accumulate and persist in high concentration in the bone 
marrow, where they are preferentially taken up intact by leukaemia cells in an active engulfment process. In 
leukaemia-bearing mice, the liposomes are taken up by leukaemia cells to a greater extent than by normal 
bone marrow cells. After internalisation, Vyxeos liposomes undergo degradation, releasing daunorubicin and 
cytarabine within the intracellular environment, enabling the medicinal products to exert their synergistic 
antineoplastic activity (SmPC, section 5.1). 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Vyxeos is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of 
adults with high-risk acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) as defined by therapy-related AML (t-AML) or AML with 
myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). The recommended indication for approval is: Vyxeos is intended 
for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) or 
AMLwith myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) (see SmPC, section 4.1). 
Vyxeos dosing is based on the patient’s body surface area (BSA) according to the following schedule: First 
induction: daunorubicin 44 mg/m2 and cytarabine 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 3, and 5; Second induction: 
daunorubicin 44 mg/m2 and cytarabine 100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 3; Consolidation: daunorubicin 29 mg/m2 
and cytarabine 65 mg/m2 on days 1 and 3 (SmPC, section 4.2).

Consolidation therapy is recommended for patients achieving remission who have recovered to absolute 
neutrophil count (ANC) > 500/µL and the platelet count has recovered to greater than 50,000/µL in the 
absence of unacceptable toxicity. A subsequent course of consolidation may be administered in patients who 
do not show disease progression or unacceptable toxicity within the range of 5 to 8 weeks after the start of 
the first consolidation. Treatment should be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit or until 
disease progression, up to maximum of 2 consolidation courses (SmPC, section 4.2). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered to 
be of major public health interest.  
This was based on the therapeutic advantage over conventional 3+7 regimen with a survival benefit in the 
claimed indication of patients with untreated therapy related AML of with myelodysplasia related changes.  A 
survival benefit over the existing standard of care that has been used over the last 40 years is remarkable for 
this disease. In addition, it has the potential of reduced long term toxicity associated with anthracyclines 
although long term data is needed before it can be confirmed.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is a sterile lyophilised liposomal product presented as powder for concentrate for 
solution for infusion containing 44 mg of daunorubicin (as HCl salt) and 100 mg of cytarabine as the active 
substances. Vyxeos is the first liposomal product containing two active substances as a fixed-combination 
product. 
Other ingredients are: distearoylphosphatidylcholine, distearoylphosphatidylglycerol, cholesterol, copper 
gluconate, triethanolamine and sucrose, as described in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The product is available in a 50 mL Ph. Eur. Type 1 colourless glass vial, sealed with a grey chlorobutyl 
stopper with a Flurotec coating on the product contact surface and sealed with an aluminium flip-off seal, as 
described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Cytarabine 
General information 
The chemical name of cytarabine is 4-amino-1-[(2R,3S,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)oxolan-2-
yl]-1,2-dihydropyrimidin-2-one corresponding to the molecular formula C9H13N3O5. It has a relative 
molecular mass 243.22 g/mol and has the following structure (Figure 1):  
Assessment report

Figure 1. Structure of cytarabine 
Cytarabine is the subject of a monograph in Ph. Eur. (0760).  Information on the active substance was 
provided in an active substance master file (ASMF). 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, mass 
spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and UV spectroscopy. Cytarabine is sufficiently 
characterised and its structure is adequately elucidated.  
Cytarabine appears as white to almost white, crystalline powder. It is non hygroscopic and is freely soluble 
in water. 
Cytarabine has four chiral centres. Cytidine, one of essential starting material, is a synthetic product with 
four chiral centers. The synthetic process changes the stereochemistry of the pair of hydroxyl groups from 
cytidine to cytarabine. The stereochemistry of the active substance produced by the manufacturer conforms 
to β form and was confirmed by NMR. 
The crystalline state of cytarabine was investigated by means of Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) 
and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The manufacturing process results always to the same crystalline form. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part 
of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Cytarabine is manufactured synthetically using cytidine as a starting material through three chemical steps 
from cytidine (starting material). 
The synthetic steps are followed by purification and crystallisation of the crude cytarabine, drying, 
pulverising and final packaging. Critical and non-critical process steps and parameters have been identified. 
The proposed in-process controls (IPCs) have been presented and are justified. The control strategy ensures 
consistent quality of the active substance. The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are 
in accordance with the relevant ICH guidelines.  
The potential impurities are controlled in the active substance and intermediate specifications as well as in 
the in-process control during the manufacturing of the active substance by validated test methods. It has 
been demonstrated that the impurities are adequately controlled during manufacturing of the active 
substance. The proposed tests and acceptance criteria for the active substance, the active substance 
intermediates, and in process controls are considered acceptable. 
The active substance is packed in air-tight, polyethylene bag (two ply), and placed in a light resistant tin 
can (outermost packaging). The primary packaging material is in compliance with the Ph. Eur., and EU 
Regulation 10/2011, respectively, as supported by evidence provided by the supplier.

Specification 
The active substance specification inludes appropriate tests and limits for appearance (visual), identification 
(UV, IR, HPLC), appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), loss on drying 
(Ph.  Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), chromatographic purity (HPLC) and assay (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed active substance specifications as applied by the finished product manufacturer or the active 
substance manufacturer comply with the current Ph. Eur. monograph for cytarabine. 
The analytical procedures used in the control of the active substance have been satisfactorily described and 
validated in accordance with the relevant ICH guidelines. Information regarding the reference standards used 
in the analytical testing is satisfactory. 
Batch analysis data for three commercial scale batches of the active substance were provided. The results 
are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process from batch to batch.  
Stability 
Stability data on three production scale batches of cytarabine stored in the intended commercial packaging 
for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25.0 ± 2.0 °C / 60.0 % RH ± 5.0 %) and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (40.0 ± 2.0 °C / 75.0 % RH ± 5.0 %) was provided according to the 
ICH guidelines.  
Samples were tested for parameters such as characters, identification (UV, IR, TLC), appearance of solution, 
specific rotation, related substances, loss on drying and assay.  The test methods are stability indicating. All 
tested parameters consistently meet the required Ph. Eur. specifications under both accelerated and long-
term conditions. No significant changes to any of the measured parameters were observed under long term 
and accelerated conditions and all remained within specification. 
According to Ph. Eur. monograph, cytarabine should be protected from light; no formal photostability study 
was performed, this is acceptable. 
The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
Daunorubicin hydrochloride 
General information 
The chemical name of daunorubicin hydrochloride is (8S,10S)-8-acetyl-10-{[(2R,4S,5S,6S)-4-amino-5-
hydroxy-6-methyloxan-2-yl]oxy}-6,8,11-trihydroxy-1-methoxy-5,7,8,9,10,12-hexahydrotetracene-5,12-
dione hydrochloride corresponding to the molecular formula C27H29NO10.HCl. It has a relative molecular 
mass 563.98 g/mol and has the following structure (Figure 2):  
Assessment report  
EMA/486480/2018 
Page 15/103 
  
  
 
Figure 2. Structure of daunorubicin hydrochloride 
Daunorubicin hydrochloride is the subject of a monograph in Ph. Eur. (0662). Information on the active 
substance was provided in an active substance master file (ASMF). 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination IR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, 
1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The 
crystalline state of the substance was consistently confirmed using X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD). 
Daunorubicin hydrochloride is sufficiently characterised and its structure is adequately elucidated.  
Daunorubicin hydrochloride appears as orange-red powder, hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is freely 
soluble in water and methanol, slightly soluble in alcohol, practically insoluble in acetone. 
Daunorubicin has six chiral centres. The stereochemistry of the active substance is guaranteed by the 
fermentation process that is widely known to be highly stereoselective. The fermentation process used 
employs the strain Streptomyces peucetius that is referenced in the Ph. Eur. Monograph 0662. The 
stereochemistry of the active substance is that provided by the Ph. Eur. Monograph. 
The crystalline state of daunorubicin hydrochloride was investigated by means of X-Ray Powder Diffraction 
technique on three production batches. The diffractograms showed the same crystalline form as that 
described in literature. The manufacturing process results always to the same crystalline form. However 
since daunorubicin hydrochloride is solubilised in buffer solution during manufacture of the finished product 
it is acknowledged that polymorphism of the active substance is not considered as critical attribute for the 
manufacture of Vyxeos. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part 
of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Daunorubicin hydrochloride is manufactured in three main stages. In the first stage, crude daunorubicin 
hydrochloride (or Intermediate I) is obtained starting from fermentation of Streptomyces peucetius. After 
the fermentation phases, the fermentation broth undergoes a number of hydrolysis, filtration, pH 
adjustment and extraction and purification steps, which result in crude daunorubicin hydrochloride (or 
Intermediate I).  
In the second stage, crude daunorubicin hydrochloride undergoes a pre-final crystallisation to obtain pre-
final crystallization daunorubicin hydrochloride (or Intermediate II).  
In the third step, pre-final crystallization daunorubicin hydrochloride is dissolved, recrystallised and sieved 
to obtain the final active substance.

The Master Cell Bank (MCB) is sufficiently characterised. The preparation of Master Cell Bank and Working 
Cell bank (WCB) has been clearly reported. The specification for MCB and WCB is presented and is 
considered satisfactory. 
Critical and non-critical process steps and parameters have been identified. The proposed IPCs have been 
presented and are justified. They include the controls of parameters in the fermentation phases, recovery and 
synthetic phase. 
The control strategy ensures consistent quality of the active substance. The characterisation of the active 
substance and its impurities are in accordance with the relevant ICH guidelines.  
The potential impurities are controlled in the active substance and intermediate specifications as well as in 
the in-process control during the manufacturing of the active substance by validated test methods. It has 
been demonstrated that the impurities are adequately controlled during manufacturing of the active 
substance. The proposed tests and acceptance criteria for the active substance, the active substance 
intermediates I and II, and in process controls are considered acceptable and justified. It is specified in the 
Ph. Eur. monograph that the production process of daunorubicin hydrochloride should be designed to 
eliminate or minimise the presence of histamine. During daunorubicin manufacture it is considered essential 
to minimise the level of histamine in the final produced daunorubicin hydrochloride in order to avoid 
unwanted effects from histamine. The ASMF Holder should provide, as post-approval commitment, evidence 
that the Ph. Eur. monograph recommendation is met. 
The active substance is packed in Type III glass bottles, closed with polypropylene cap equipped with 
polyethylene gasket. The bottle is then put in a transparent polyethylene bag and placed in a cardboard drum 
and stored at 5 ± 3 °C. The glass bottles and polyethylene gasket used as primary packaging materials are in 
compliance with the Ph. Eur., and EU Regulation 10/2011, respectively, as supported by evidence provided 
by the supplier. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for appearance (visual), identification 
(IR, HPLC), identification of chlorides (Ph. Eur.), crystallinity (microscopy), pH (Ph. Eur.), water content 
(Ph. Eur.), related substances (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (Ph. Eur.), assay (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological 
testing (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed active substance specifications as applied by the finished product manufacturer or the active 
substance manufacturer comply with the current Ph. Eur. monograph for daunorubicin hydrochloride. 
The analytical procedures used in the control of the active substance have generally been satisfactorily 
described and validated in accordance with the relevant ICH guidelines. Information regarding the reference 
standards used in the analytical testing is satisfactory. 
Batch analysis data for six commercial scale batches of the active substance were provided. The results are 
within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process from batch to batch.  
Stability 
Stability  data  on  six  production  scale  batches  of  daunorubicin  hydrochloride  stored  in  the  intended 
commercial  packaging  for  up  to  12  months  under  long  term  conditions  (5°  ±  3°C)  and  for  up  to  6  months 
under accelerated conditions (25 °C, 60 % RH) was provided according to the ICH guidelines.

Samples were tested for appearance (accelerated condition only), assay, related substances, water content, 
pH and microbiological testing. The test methods are stability indicating. No significant changes to any of the 
measured  parameters  were  observed  under  long  term  and  accelerated  conditions  and  all  remained  within

The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Vyxeos is a sterile lyophilised liposome formulation intended for parenteral administration. Each single-use 
50 mL vial contains 100 mg cytarabine and 44 mg daunorubicin in a 5:1 molar ratio at a concentration of 
100 units per vial, where 1 unit contains 1.0 mg cytarabine and 0.44 mg daunorubicin (as the free base).  
The product after reconstitution with 19 mL of sterile Water for Injection is a purple colloidal dispersion of 
liposomes with daunorubicin and cytarabine encapsulated in the liposomes providing 5 units/mL (5.0 mg/mL 
cytarabine and 2.2 mg/mL daunorubicin (as the free base)). The liposome membrane is composed of 
distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), distearoylphosphatidylglycerol (DSPG) and cholesterol in a 7:2:1 molar 
ratio.  
Vyxeos is a liposomal formulation of cytarabine:daunorubicin intended for the treatment of acute myeloid 
leukemia. The rationale for developing Vyxeos was based on the principle of ratiometric dosing, in which 
specific drug:drug ratios provide synergistic activity. The anti-tumor ratio-dependent synergy of cytarabine 
and daunorubicin was defined in cell-based screening assays in vitro. This ratio of the drugs was 
encapsulated in liposomes. Nano-scale drug delivery vehicles, such as liposomes, are known to prolong the 
circulation of drugs in vivo. The small size (~100 nm diameter) and specific lipid composition of the Vyxeos 
liposomes result in long circulation times in vivo.  
The Quality Target Product Profile (QTTP) was reviewed and contained a summary of the quality 
characteristics that were used to guide pharmaceutical development for Vyxeos in accordance with ICH Q8. 
Critical Quality Attributes (CQA)  
Based on the QTPP, the critical quality attributes (CQA) to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of the 
finished product were identified. 
The selection of cytarabine and daunorubicin was based on the established clinical practice which has been 
the standard first-line induction treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) for over 40 years.  
In addition, a panel of tumour cell lines was utilised to examine drug ratio-dependent synergy for various 
cytarabine:daunorubicin molar ratios. 
Data analysed using the median effect analysis method showed that the cytarabine:daunorubicin 5:1 molar 
ratio was the most consistently synergistic ratio evaluated, with 53% of cell lines tested displaying synergy 
and 33% antagonism. The maintenance of the 5:1 molar ratio of cytarabine:daunorubicin during drug release 
from the liposome is confirmed based on both in vitro and in vivo evalution in mice and rats. 
Assessment report  
EMA/486480/2018

Since both ASs are water soluble, encapsulation within a liposome carrier was identified as a possible solution 
to maintain fixed drug ratios in vivo. The liposomal membrane composition chosen for the encapsulation of 
cytarabine and daunorubicin was based on prior formulation experience. Therefore the brief discussion 
provided on the selection of lipids was accepted. The lipids comprising the liposomes are 
Distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), Distearoylphosphatidylglycerol sodium salt (DSPG-Na) and cholesterol 
(Chol). Both DSPC and DSPG have a relatively high phase transition temperature (~ 55 °C) and the 
negatively charged lipid (DSPG) is used to help minimise liposome aggregation. 
In vitro developmental data relating to a prior floxuridine and irinotecan liposomal formulation was presented 
to support the chosen lipid ratio of DSPC:DSPG:Chol (70:20:10, mol:mol) instead of new data using 
cytarabine and daunorubicin. This was considered acceptable because, importantly, the underlying strategy 
of Vyxeos is for intact liposomes containing the 5:1 molar ratio to be taken up by leukemia cells. Therefore, 
Vyxeos liposomes are designed for high retention of the drug cargo and low in vivo release rates as they 
circulate in the plasma. Based on PK calculations, at least 99% of the drug in the plasma is encapsulated 
within Vyxeos liposomes. Subsequent in vivo studies confirm the maintenance of the 5:1 molar ratio 
(cytarabine:daunorubicin).  
Based on previous formulation studies performed, different drug loading techniques have been evaluated for 
the loading of cytarabine and daunorubicin respectively. The excipients used are conventional excipients used 
for the manufacture of liposomal formulation and are known in the literature for use with anti-cancer agents, 
therefore the choice of excipients is considered acceptable.  There are no novel excipients used in the 
manufacture of Vyxeos. Diastearoylphosphatidyl choline (DSPC) and distearoylphosphatidylglycerol (DSPG) 
have been used in different parenteral medicinal products approved globally for many years. No chemical or 
physical incompatibilities have been noted between cytarabine and daunorubicin or between cytarabine or 
daunorubicin and the excipients in Vyxeos. Compatibility of cytarabine and daunorubicin with the excipients 
was confirmed in real time and accelerated stability studies.  
Characterisation studies of Vyxeos liposomes were performed. A summary of the characterization studies 
concerning relevant physicochemical properties for Vyxeos liposome for injection including liposome 
morphology; lamellarity; characterization of bilamellar structure; surface charge; trapped volume; phase 
transition temperature were presented. The characterisation of liposomes correlates with observed cryo-EM 
images pre- and post-drug loading revealing the formation of bilamellar liposomes. 
Early Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials were conducted with a slightly different liquid formulation.  The 
change to the lyophilised formulation, which can be stored at 2-8 °C, was made prior to the Phase 3 clinical 
trials to provide better product stability, ease of commercial distribution and ease of preparation in the clinic. 
A comparison of the formulations used in the clinical trials programme and container/closures were 
summarised. The commercial finished product formulation and container/closure system are the same as 
those used for the Phase 3 clinical studies. 
Each manufacturing step has been discussed individually and each unit operation is categorised as either 
critical or non-critical.  
Sufficient information has been presented to demonstrate that stereoisomerisation of either cytarabine or 
daunorubicin is not possible during the finished product manufacturing process. 
Following inspection deficiencies at the ASs manufacturing sites, new manufacturers were identified as 
alternate commercial manufacturers for cytarabine and daunorubicin. The comparability of the ASs has been 
discussed in detail and the quality of the ASs sourced from the different manufacturers is considered 
comparable. A satisfactory comparability investigation for the finished product followed by the second process 
Assessment report  
EMA/486480/2018

performance qualification with a product batch manufactured with the ASs from the new suppliers was also 
performed.  
The in vitro release (IVR) assay is one of the critical controls for Vyxeos. An assessment of the relationship of 
mean particle size with IVR has been performed. It should be noted that IVR / in vivo correlations (IVIVC) 
have not been established. An updated satisfactory method development report of the in vitro drug release 
method has been provided and supported by relevant data during the procedure. The method development 
report is in line with the EMA “Reflection Paper on the Data Requirements for Intravenous Liposomal Products 
Developed with Reference to an Innovator Liposomal Product” (EMA/CHMP/806058/2009/Rev. 02) and 
contains a full discussion of the method development strategy, determination of release media and 
demonstration of the discriminatory nature of the method to formulation and process variants. The proposed 
in vitro drug release method is used for the evaluation of the release characteristics of the two substances, 
and to discriminate between liposome batches with different formulations or compositions. The discriminatory 
of the IVR method is demonstrated by varying the formulation and the manufacturing process parameters. 
Due to the nature of the finished product, a multipoint specification limit / multiple sampling time-points are 
required for the IVR analysis of both active substances. 
The reconstituted product is administered by intravenous (IV) infusion to patients after dilution with either 
0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, or 5% Dextrose in intravenous infusion bags. The physicochemical stability, 
including the compatibility of Vyxeos liposomes with the diluents, infusion bags and administration sets was 
evaluated. The results showed that the diluted Vyxeos solution is compatible with representative infusion 
bags and administration sets. 
Vyxeos finished product is packaged in a 50 mL Ph. Eur. Type 1 colourless glass vial, sealed with a 20 mm 
4432/50 grey chlorobutyl stopper with a Flurotec coating on the product contact surface and sealed with a 
20 mm aluminium flip-off seal. The vial is then packaged into a cardboard carton to protect from light 
exposure.  The primary packaging system has been evaluated with respect to extractables and leachables 
and taking into account the total number of dosing days. No significant amount of leaching components from 
the product contacting packaging components was observed. 
The declarations from the suppliers of the glass vial and rubber stopper are also provided, confirming 
compliance with the Ph. Eur. requirements, including Ph. Eur. 3.2.1. “Glass containers for pharmaceutical 
use”, Ph. Eur. 3.2.9. “Rubber closures for containers for aqueous parenteral preparations for powders and for 
freeze-dried powders”, and BSE/TSE-free statement.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process comprises the following main stages: preparation of liposomes, preparation of 
cytarabine and daunorubicin solutions, liposomes loading with cytarabine and daunorubicin, sterilisation, 
lyophilisation and packaging. Critical process parameters (CPPs) affecting the finished product critical quality 
attributes are presented. Ranges or target values for other non-critical process parameters (PPs) are also 
included. The proposed IPCs for the manufacturing process were established based on historical process 
performance data from commercial scale batches or in some cases the required finished product 
characteristics. A summary of the in-process limits, including the action limit and acceptance limit of the 
identified critical in-process parameters was clearly presented in tabular format.  
The proposed in-process limits are generally supported by the relevant batch analysis during in-process 
testing, but because various batches from development have been pooled together, the calculation mean 
may be affected. In view of the limited commercial batches currently available, it is acceptable to revise the 
Assessment report  
EMA/486480/2018 
Page 20/103 
  
  
IPCs following the manufacture of 26 commercial batches (post-approval commitment). This would provide 
reassurance of the suitability of the proposed IPCs.  
It was not possible to compare batch-to-batch consistency when the hold-time validation studies were only 
performed on one batch to validate a particular stage of the manufacturing process. Therefore, further 
validation data are requested to support the proposed hold-times of the intermediate products at different 
stages of the manufacturing process. The post-approval commitment to provide the data is acceptable.  
The validation program for Vyxeos manufacturing process, which is a non-standard process, consisted of 
qualification of the aseptic filling process at the manufacturing site and validation studies on manufacturing 
unit operations. A prospective validation study has been performed initially on three commercial scale 
batches of Vyxeos. One batch failed release testing for one parameter. Following the OOS results some 
corrective and preventive actions was implemented. A fourth batch was successfully included in the formal 
validation study. Concerns over the out-of-specifications have been adequately discussed and justified. The 
relevant specification control limits have been amended accordingly. 
Each batch was manufactured in the same manufacturing facility, using the same process and the same 
equipment as the commercial process.  
In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is sufficiently robust to provide 
assurance that finished product of consistent quality, complying with the specification, is produced. 
 Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications, include appropriate tests and limits for appearance 
of Lyophilized Cake and  Post-Reconstitution Suspension (visual), reconstitution time, water content of the 
Lyophilized Cake (Ph. Eur.), pH of the reconstituted suspension (Ph. Eur.), particle size (Ph. Eur.), Osmolality 
(Ph. Eur.), Particulate Matter (Ph. Eur.), identification of cytarabine and daunorubicin (HPLC, UV), cytarabine 
and daunorubicin assay (HPLC), cytarabine and daunorubicin % encapsulation (HPLC),  cytarabine and 
daunorubicin impurities (HPLC), cytarabine and daunorubicin content uniformity (Ph. Eur.), DSPC assay 
(HPLC), DSPG-Na assay (HPLC), cholesterol assay (HPLC), Lipid impurities (HPLC), copper assay (atomic 
absorption), residual solvents (GC), endotoxin (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and  in-vitro release. 
Data from eight commercial-scale batches, along with data from twelve process development batches of 
lyophilised finished product form the basis for the justification of specifications for Vyxeos. Batches that were 
rejected during development were not used for specification setting. The proposed commercial IVR 
acceptance criteria are based primarily on the commercial scale batches manufactured at the proposed 
manufacturing site. 
A risk assessment was conducted for Vyxeos finished product to identify potential elemental impurities that 
may be present in the finished product in accordance with ICH Q3D Elemental Impurities in Drug Products. In 
addition to the elemental impurities risk assessment, Vyxeos finished product was tested for levels of heavy 
metals via Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS).  Based on the outcome of the risk 
assessment appropriate control strategy is put in place.   
The finished product is released on the market following traditional final product release testing. The 
procedures for analytical methods used are provided. Most of them are compendial and for these methods 
verification reports were provided. The non-compendial analytical methods were validated according to 
current ICH guidance. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis 
of finished product has been presented.

Batch analysis data from commercial-scale batches of lyophilised finished product manufactured to date for 
use in Phase 3 clinical studies, registration stability studies process validation and commercial batches have 
been presented. These batches were manufactured at the commercial manufacturing site. In addition, batch 
analysis data of batches of frozen liquid product, as well as one batch of liquid formulation of Vyxeos, used in 
Phase I and II development have also been presented as supportive data.  
All product batches were tested using the methods, and released against the specifications, in place at the 
time of test. The results show that the finished product can be manufactured with consistent quality and 
meeting its specifications. 
Stability of the product 
Nine batches of Vyxeos, manufactured at the commercial manufacturing facility according to the commercial 
manufacturing process, have been placed on stability under long term (2 – 8 °C) and accelerated conditions 
(25 °C/60 % RH) according to the ICH guidelines. All stability batches were of commercial scale and kept in 
the proposed container closure system. Results are available for up to 42 months stored in long term and up 
to 24 months at accelerated conditions. 
All test vials were stored upright in the container closure system and analysed based on the following 
parameters: appearance (lyophilised, and post-reconstitution); reconstitution time; cytarabine (identification, 
assay, % encapsulation and impurities); daunorubicin (identification, assay, % encapsulation and impurities); 
DSPC/DSPG/cholesterol assay; lipid impurities; pH; liposome particle size; in vitro release of cytarabine and 
daunorubicin; particulate matter and osmolality. 
There was no change in appearance of the lyophilised plug or the reconstituted dispersion through 42 
months. There were essentially no changes in any of the following: cytarabine and daunorubicin assays, 
impurities, and encapsulation, lipid assays, pH, osmolality, copper assay, triethanolamine assay, residual 
water content, particulate matter, endotoxins or sterility, in-vitro release rate.  There is a slight trend for the 
total daunorubicin impurities to increase through 42 months but remains well within the specification limit. 
However out-of-specification (OOS) results were observed for the in vitro drug release and mean particle size 
of the liposome, both of which are critical parameters for providing quality assurance of the finished product. 
OOS results were sufficiently justified. Nevertheless, only for three batches were there no OOS were 
observed for up to 12 months stability testing under all long-term (5 ± 3 °C), accelerated (25 ºC/60% RH) 
and stress conditions (30 ºC/65% RH or 40 °C/75 % RH). 
In view of the limited number of batches that showed full compliance with the finished product specifications, 
the proposed shelf-life of 48 months is not acceptable; a shelf-life of 24 months can be considered acceptable 
provided that the Applicant commits to place two additional finished product batches, manufactured using the 
currently  proposed  ASs  sources,  manufacturing  process  and  controls,  on  stability.  Updated  stability  data 
should be provided annually until 24 months real time data is available for both batches. 
The updated 18-month stability data for the one batch and 9-month long term stability data for a second 
batch confirms compliance with the proposed finished product specifications for up to the study period of 18- 
and 9- months, respectively.  No significant differences for the tested parameters have been observed for 
these two batches during stability, which is satisfactory.  
Furthermore, stress testing (i.e. photo-stability under ICH photostability conditions, temperature cycling) was 
also performed to study the effect of heat and light on Vyxeos. The stability of Vyxeos post reconstitution has 
also been studied in accordance with ICH Q1A guidance. Samples were analysed against the stability

specifications in place at the time of testing. The photostability studies demonstrated that Vyxeos vials should 
not be exposed to intense light for prolonged periods of time and that the secondary packaging can be 
considered to provide sufficient protection against light-induced product degradation. Chemical and physical 
in-use stability has been demonstrated for 4 hours at 2°C to 8°C for the econstituted suspension in the vial 
and for the diluted infusion solution (SmPC section 6.3). 
Short-term stability studies of lyophilised Vyxeos exposed to low and cycling temperatures were also 
performed. The results demonstrated the product is sensitive to light under ICH photostability conditions, and 
sensitive to elevated temperatures but not sensitive to temperature cycling within the tested range.  
Overall the stability results based on the real-time stability results, a shelf-life of 24 months at storage 
conditions of 5°C ± 3°C for Vyxeos in the commercial container closure configuration is considered 
acceptable. According to results from the photostability study and following ICH requirements Vyxeos is 
sensitive to light. Therefore, the finished product should be protected from prolonged exposure to intense 
light and kept in the secondary packaging until use.  
Adventitious agents 
Cholesterol is the only animal derived excipient used in the manufacture of Vyxeos. It is supplied under 
guarantee from the manufacturer that the source and/or processing used to obtain the cholesterol is in 
compliance with the "Note for guidance on minimizing the risk of transmitting animal spongiform 
encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal products, EMA/410/01 Rev. 3". A certificate of 
suitability from the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and Health Care has been provided.  
All other excipients/components, including the other lipids, are manufactured from raw materials of plant, 
petroleum or chemical origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The source of both active substances has been changed during 
development and new manufacturers were identified as alternate commercial suppliers for cytarabine and 
daunorubicin. The comparability of the ASs has been discussed in detail and the quality of the ASs sourced 
from the different manufacturers is considered comparable. A satisfactory comparability investigation 
followed by the second process performance qualification for the finished product manufactured with active 
substances from the new suppliers was performed. Some issues with a number of development finished 
product batches not meeting all criteria have been investigated and satisfactory corrective actions and 
justifications have been provided. The suitability of the in vitro release assay which is one of the critical 
controls for Vyxeos has been successfully demonstrated. Overall, the results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The daunorubicin ASMF Holder should provide by 31st July 2018, as post-approval commitment, 
evidence that the Ph. Eur. monograph recommendation that the production process of daunorubicin 
hydrochloride should be designed to eliminate or minimise the presence of histamine is met.  
2.  All IPC control limits should be reviewed after manufacturing of 26 commercial batches of the finished 
product. 
3.  Further satisfactory validation data from two batches are required to support the proposed hold-times 
relating to the non-standard processing steps. 
4.  Two additional finished product batches, manufactured using the currently proposed active substance 
sources, manufacturing process and controls, should be placed on stability. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Single dose toxicity studies conducted with Vyxeos comprised a non-GLP single ascending dose study, in 
dogs, and two GLP-compliant single dose studies followed by a 14-day observation period, in rats and dogs. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro assessment of cytarabine:daunorubicin combinations for synergy 
Synergism with respect to cytotoxicity was more evident at higher cytarabine:daunorubicin molar ratios than 
one, and antagonist cytotoxic effects were observed in a larger proportion of cells at ratios lower than one. 
(Study FR-051212TH). A molar ratio of 5:1 cytarabine:daunorubicin showed the greatest degree of synergy 
while minimizing the degree of antagonism in a majority of tumour cell lines.  
Anti-tumour efficacy of Vyxeos against P388 Murine Lymphocytic Leukaemia in BDF-1 Mice (Study 
SR050705) 
In Study SR050705, CPX-351, non-liposomal (free) cytarabine and daunorubicin, and the free drug cocktail 
(cytarabine:daunorubicin) were administered intravenously on Days 1, 4, 7 at the MTD and at dose-matched 
levels in the P388 murine lymphocytic leukaemia model.  
With increasing dosage of daunorubicin, %ILS values increased, whereas cytarabine showed minimal dose 
dependence in the dosage range of 400 to 1000 mg/kg. Administration of the free drug cocktail at the MTD of 
600:9 mg/kg cytarabine:daunorubicin was moderately effective with an MST of 29.5 days and %ILS of 
293.3%, while treatment with higher doses of the free drug cocktail was not tolerated. Overall, the anti-
tumour activity of CPX-351 administered at 12.5:5 mg/kg (in the first experiment) was approximately 3-fold 
greater than the activity of the free drug (cytarabine, 1000 mg/kg) or the free drug cocktail administered at 
the MTD.

Anti-tumour Efficacy of Vyxeos against WEHI-3B Murine Myelomonocytic leukaemia cells implanted in CD-1 
nude mice (Study SR190805) 
Administration of free cytarabine:daunorubicin cocktail at doses ≥ MTD of 600:9 mg/kg was associated with 
high toxicity compared with animals treated with 12:5.3 mg/kg . Mice treated with  had a longer MST and 
larger %ILS than ratio-matched free drug cocktail at matched doses and at the MTD.   
Anti-tumour efficacy of Vyxeos in the CCRF-CEM Human Acute T-Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Xenograft Model: 
Dose-Matched and at MTD Levels (Study SR250805) 
Vyxeos and the 5:1 molar ratio-matched non-liposomal free drug cocktail (cytarabine:daunorubicin) were 
administered at dose-matched and at MTD levels in SCID/Rag2M mice implanted with CCRF-CEM human 
acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia cells. Vyxeos had potent and dose-dependent anti-tumour activity against 
CCRF-CEM human acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia. Maximum anti-tumour effect occurred at a dose of 
12.5:5 mg/kg with 5/5 animals surviving until the end of the study.  
Anti-tumour efficacy of Vyxeos in the CCRF-CEM Human Acute T-Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Xenograft Model: 
Ratio-Matched and Dose-Pushed Levels (Study SR060905) 
Vyxeos and non-liposomal free drug cocktail (cytarabine:daunorubicin) were administered at ratio-matched 
and dose-pushed levels to SCID/Rag2M mice.  Vyxeos had potent and dose-dependent anti-tumour activity 
against CCRF-CEM human acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia. Maximum effect occurred at a dose of 10:4.4 
mg/kg (MST and %ILS values of 79.5 days and 134% respectively with a p-value of 0.0008). Administration 
of Vyxeos at the highest dose of 12:5.3 mg/kg was not tolerated and was associated with significant 
mortality and adverse effects.  
Vyxeos efficacy was also compared with the free drug cocktail administered at ratio-matched and dose-
pushed levels. Treatment with the ratio-matched free cocktail at 25:11 mg/kg was associated with significant 
body weight loss, high toxicity scores, and marked adverse events. Dose escalation of the dose-pushed free 
drug cocktail to 600:9 mg/kg resulted in unacceptable bodyweight loss and toxicity.  Vyxeos at 6:2.64 mg/kg 
and at 10:4.4 mg/kg had respectively a longer MST and a higher %ILS than dose-pushed free drug cocktail 
at the MTD of 300:4.5 mg/kg (respectively 59.5 day MST and 75% ILS for Vyxeos at 6:2.64 mg/kg and 79.5 
day MST and 134% ILS for Vyxeos at 10:4.4 mg/kg compared  to a 53.5 day MST and 57% for the free drug 
cocktail at 300:4.5 mg/kg with a respective p-value of 0.066 and 0.0123. 
Anti-tumour Efficacy of Vyxeos in the HL-60B Human Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia Xenograft Model (Study 
SR160905) 
In Study SR160905, Vyxeos and non-liposomal free drug cocktail (cytarabine:daunorubicin) were 
administered to SCID/[CB17SC-M] mice implanted with HL-60B human acute promyelocytic leukaemia cells. 
The dose regimen consisted of IV injections on Days 8, 11, and 14 after implantation of HL-60B leukaemia 
cells.  
Vyxeos exhibited dose-dependent anti-tumour activity against HL-60B human acute promyelocytic leukaemia 
xenografts, producing a maximum effect at the highest dose of 5:2 mg/kg (MST and %ILS values of 43.0 
days and 43% respectively with a p-value of 0.0006). Treatment with a lower dose of Vyxeos at 2.5:1 mg/kg 
was less effective (MST and %ILS values of 35.0 days and 17%, respectively with a p-value of 0.006). No 
animals survived to Day 45 in either of the Vyxeos-treated groups. However, comparison of survival time 
between Vyxeos groups treated at 5:2 mg/kg and 2.5:1 mg/kg with that of control saline-treated group 
demonstrated statistically significant anti-tumour activity for both Vyxeos doses at p=0.0006 and p=0.006, 
respectively.

Treatment of mice with Vyxeos at 5:2 mg/kg compared to animals treated with the ratio-matched free 
cocktail at the same dose resulted in a longer MST (43 days compared to 33 days) and % ILS (43% 
compared to10%). Dose escalation of the ratio-matched free drug cocktail to the MTD level of 10:4 mg/kg 
did not result in a survival benefit, with the MST value remaining comparable to that of controls.  
The survival effect of Vyxeos at 5:2 mg/kg resulted in a longer MST and higher %ILS than mice treated with 
the ratio-matched free drug cocktail at matched dose of 5:2 mg/kg (43.0 days MST and 43% ILS for Vyxeos 
at 5:2 mg/kg compared to a 33.0 days MST and 10% ILS for the ratio-matched free drug cocktail at matched 
dose of 5:2 mg/kg) and at the MTD of 10:4 mg/kg (43.0 days MST and 43% ILS for Vyxeos at 5:2 mg/kg 
compared to a 27.0 days MST and -10% ILS for the ratio-matched free drug cocktail at matched dose of 10:4 
mg/kg) with p-values at 0.0007 and 0.0012, respectively. CPX-35l anti-tumour activity was also greater than 
the dose-pushed free drug cocktail (a ratio of 200:3; p=0.0009).  
Anti-tumour Efficacy of Vyxeos Compared with Individual Liposomal Agents Against P388 Murine Lymphocytic 
Leukaemia Cells Implanted in BDF-1 Mice (Study SR250505) 
Study SR250505 was a compilation of data from 2 individual experiments (NC003CT312 and NC003CT325) in 
the IP-implanted P388 murine lymphocytic leukaemia model. The dose regimen consisted of multiple IV 
injections administered Q3Dx3 on Days 1, 4, and 7, beginning 1 day after tumour cell implantation. After a 
60-day period, surviving animals were re-inoculated to rule out the possibility of an immunological tumour 
rejection.  
Animals in group treated with the high dose of Vyxeos (10:5 mg/kg) survived for 60 days, representing a >7-
fold increase over the control (saline) median survival time. The studies showed that Vyxeos had potent anti-
tumour activity against P388 syngeneic murine lymphocytic leukaemia. The anti-tumour activity of Vyxeos 
was shown to be dose-dependent, producing the greatest effect at a dosage level of 10:5 mg/kg. Vyxeos 
dose-dependent anti-tumour effect was consistent with animal survival at Day 60. Treatment of mice with 
Vyxeos at 10:5 mg/kg resulted in a longer MST and higher %ILS than individual liposomal drugs 
administered at dose-matched levels that produced a relatively moderate activity (>60 days MST and >675% 
ILS for Vyxeos at 10:5 mg/kg compared to a 22 days MTS and 175% ILS for Liposomal Cytarabine at 10 
mg/kg and a 16 day MST and 100% ILS for Liposomal Daunorubicin at 5 mg/kg with a p-value <0.0001).  
Surviving mice re-inoculated with P388 tumour cells had an MST of 8 days, identical to that of saline-control 
mice. 
Anti-tumour Efficacy of Vyxeos Compared with Free Drug Cocktail and Individual Liposomal Agents Against 
L1210 Murine Lymphocytic Leukaemia Cells Implanted in BDF-1 Mice (Study SR220705) 
In Study SR220705, Vyxeos, and individual liposomal cytarabine and liposomal daunorubicin were 
administered at dose-matched and/or MTD levels in BDF-1 mice implanted with L1210 murine lymphocytic 
cells. The dose regimen consisted of multiple IV injections administered Q3Dx3 on Days 1, 4, and 7, 
beginning 1 day after tumour cell implantation. Vyxeos had potent and dose-dependent anti-tumour activity 
against Ll210 syngeneic murine lymphocytic leukaemia cells. A robust anti-tumour effect was observed at the 
highest dose of Vyxeos used in this study (12.5:5 mg/kg) (MST and %ILS values of >64 days and >814% 
respectively with a p-value of 0.0009). The Vyxeos dose-dependent anti-tumour effect was consistent with 
the survival rate.  
Mice treated with Vyxeos had a longer MST and higher %ILS than those treated with the ratio-matched free 
drug cocktail at both the matched dose level as well as at the MTD (>64 days MST and >814% ILS for 
Vyxeos at 12.5:5 mg/kg compared to a 12 day MST and 71% ILS for the free cocktail administered at the

same dose (12.5:5 mg/kg )with a p-value of 0.0012). Furthermore, all mice treated with the 12.5:5 mg/kg 
dose of Vyxeos survived until the end of the study (9-fold increase in MST vs. saline control), whereas none 
of the mice treated with the free drug cocktail at the same ratio survived until Day 64.  
Mice treated with Vyxeos had a longer MST and higher %ILS than mice treated with individual liposomal 
drugs administered at the MTD (>64 days MST and >814% ILS for Vyxeos at 12.5:5 mg/kg compared to a 
43.5 day MTS and 521% ILS for Liposomal Cytarabine at 15 mg/kg and a 19 day MST and 171% ILS for 
Liposomal Daunorubicin at 10 mg/kg with a respective p-value of 0.0566 and 0.0005). Likewise, the anti-
tumour efficacy of Vyxeos over the individual liposomal drugs was also reflected by an increased incidence of 
survival at Day 64.  
Anti-tumour Efficacy of Vyxeos Compared with Individual Liposomal Agents Following a Delayed Q3Dx3 IV 
Administration Against P388 Murine Lymphocytic Leukaemia in BDF-1 Mice (Study SR221105) 
In Study SR221105 Vyxeos, liposomal daunorubicin, and liposomal cytarabine were administered at dose-
matched and MTD levels to BDF-1 mice implanted with P388 syngeneic murine lymphocytic leukaemia cells. 
The dose regimen consisted of multiple IV injections administered on Days 4, 7, and 10, beginning 4 days 
after IP inoculation of P388 leukaemia cells.  
Vyxeos had potent and dose-dependent anti-tumour activity against the P388 murine lymphocytic leukaemia 
which correlated with survival at Day 64. Mice treated with Vyxeos had a longer MST and higher %ILS than 
the individual liposomal drugs administered at dose-matched levels and at their MTD (38 days MST and 
443% ILS for Vyxeos at 10:4.4 mg/kg compared to a 20.0 day MTS and 186 % ILS for Liposomal Cytarabine 
at 10 mg/kg and a 10 day MST and 43% ILS for Liposomal Daunorubicin at 4.4 mg/kg with a respective p-
value of 0.0006 and 0.0012).  
Anti-tumour Efficacy of Vyxeos Compared with Individual Liposomal Agents Against WEHI-3B Murine 
Myelomonocytic Leukaemia Cells Implanted in CD-1 Nude Mice (Study SR011205)  
In Study SR011205, Vyxeos, liposomal daunorubicin, and liposomal cytarabine were administered at dose-
matched and MTD levels to CD-1 nude mice implanted with WEHI-3B murine myelomonocytic leukaemia 
cells. The dose regimen consisted of multiple IV injections administered on Days 1, 4, and 7, beginning 1 day 
after IP inoculation of tumour cells.  Vyxeos had potent and dose-dependent anti-tumour activity against the 
WEHI-3B murine myelomonocytic leukaemia, producing a maximum effect at a Vyxeosdose of 12:5: 3 mg/kg 
(MST and %ILS values of >102 days and >343% respectively with a p-value of 0.0008). The dose-dependent 
anti-tumour effect of Vyxeos was consistent with an increase in survival. Mice treated with the mid- and high 
dose of Vyxeos demonstrated a >5-fold increase in MST compared with the control (saline).  
Mice treated with Vyxeos had a longer MST and higher %ILS than mice treated with the individual liposomal 
drugs administered at dose-matched levels in WEHI-3B tumour-bearing mice (>102 days MST and >343% 
ILS for Vyxeos at 12:5.3 mg/kg compared to a 24.5 day MTS and 7.0 % ILS for Liposomal Cytarabine at 12 
mg/kg and a 38.5 day MST and 67% ILS for Liposomal Daunorubicin at 5.3 mg/kg with a respective p-value 
of 0.0018 and 0.1006). The anti-tumour effect was consistent with an increased incidence of survival at Day 
102.  
Anti-tumour Efficacy of Liposomal Cytarabine:Daunorubicin at Different Drug to Drug Molar Ratios: Optimal 
Drug Ratio Identification in P388 Xenografts (Study SR090905) 
In study SR090905 three liposomal cytarabine:daunorubicin formulations at various fixed drug:drug molar 
ratios were compared with Vyxeos. Therapeutic treatment consisted of IV injections on Days 1, 4, 7 after IP 
tumour cell implantation. In a P388 murine lymphocytic leukaemia model, anti-tumour activity of Vyxeos 
Assessment report

(5:1 molar ratio) was dose dependent producing maximum effect at the highest dose tested correlating with 
the survival at Day 63 (p=0.001 vs. control). Vyxeos at 10:4 mg/kg (0.8 MTD) resulted in a comparable anti-
tumour activity to that of liposomal cytarabine:daunorubicin administered at 11.6:1 molar ratio administered 
at 15:3 mg/kg (MTD). Mice treated with Vyxeos (5:1) had a longer MST and higher %ILS than formulations 
at 3:1 or 1:1 molar ratio administered at their respective MTD (>63 days MST and 563% ILS for Vyxeos (5:1 
molar ratio) compared to a 47.0 day MTS and 395 % ILS for formulation at 3:1 molar ratio  and a 44.0 day 
MST and 358% ILS for ILS for formulation at 1:1 molar ratio with a respective p-value of 0.1895 and 
0.0563).   
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Following IV bolus doses of Vyxeos or a non-liposomal cocktail of cytarabine and daunorubicin (Study 
CT832), bone marrow exposures to cytarabine and daunorubicin were higher and more sustained with 
Vyxeos than with the non-liposomal formulations, half-lives in bone marrow for cytarabine and daunorubicin 
with Vyxeos were at least twice as long as those in plasma suggesting bone marrow as the site of retention 
for Vyxeos. 
A Rag2 CCRF-CEM xenograft model was used to assess distribution to bone marrow in Study SR150105. 
Following a full course (Q3Dx3) of treatment with either Vyxeos or free drug cocktail, peak bone marrow 
levels of cytarabine or daunorubicin ranged from 2- to 14-fold higher in Vyxeos treated mice than in free 
drug-treated mice. Concomitantly, the bone marrow AUC values for both drugs were higher for Vyxeos 
treated mice than those treated with the free drug cocktail. 
Off-target activity of Vyxeos on normal bone marrow cell lines was evaluated in study SR150105. Vyxeos was 
less cytotoxic in normal bone marrow cells. Intracellular accumulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin were 9 
and 2 times higher in CCRF-CEM cells than in normal bone marrow cells. Similarly, the uptake of liposomal 
lipid in CCRF-CEM cells was 2 times greater than that in normal bone marrow cells. 
The time-dependent intracellular accumulation of daunorubicin from Vyxeos liposomes was examined using 
fluorescence microscopy. In CCRF-CEM cells and chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, daunorubicin was 
observed to accumulate within the nucleus, and fluorescently labeled lipid in the Vyxeos liposomes was 
visible on the plasma membrane, surrounding the nucleus and throughout the cytoplasm. Concomitantly, 
plasma membrane-associated liposomes decreased over time.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Validated bioanalytical methods based on high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) were used to measure plasma concentrations of cytarabine and AraU, daunorubicin 
and daunorubicinol in rats and dogs in GLP toxicology studies.

For the non-GLP studies, qualified methods based on high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet 
light, fluorescence, or mass spectrometry (LC/UV, LC/fluorescence, and LC/MS, respectively) were used to 
measure concentrations of total and free cytarabine and daunorubicin in plasma and bone marrow. 
The general PK of cytarabine and daunorubicin associated with Vyxeos was evaluated in mice, rats, and dogs 
and the results are displayed in Table 1. 
Table 1 PK parameters for cytarabine and daunorubicin in mice, rats, and dogs 
Cytarabine and daunorubicin tissue distributions were evaluated in two studies in which the 14C-labeled 
drugs were administered as components of Vyxeos or as non-liposomal formulations (Studies XBL14628 and 
XBL13687). The results are displayed in Table 2.

AUClast=area under the curve up to the last measurable concentration  
Study CT832 assessed bone marrow targeting in in female CD-1 nude mice. The purpose was to determine 
the bone marrow uptake profiles of cytarabine and daunorubicin associated with administration of Vyxeos and 
non-liposomal formulations (cytarabine and daunorubicin in saline). The mice received an IV bolus dose of 
Vyxeos at 12 units/kg or a combination of 600 mg/kg cytarabine and 9 mg/kg daunorubicin as the non-
liposomal formulations. Following administration of Vyxeos, both cytarabine and daunorubicin showed 
sustained retention in bone marrow; time of the maximum concentration (tmax) was 1 and 2 hours for 
cytarabine and daunorubicin, respectively, and levels of cytarabine and daunorubicin decreased very 
gradually and were still detectable at 24 hours post-dose. Following administration of the non-liposomal 
formulations, both cytarabine and daunorubicin distributed rapidly into bone marrow; tmax was 0.25 and 0.5 
hours for cytarabine and daunorubicin, respectively. Levels of cytarabine decreased quickly and were below 
the limit of detection at 4 hours post-dose. Levels of daunorubicin remained relatively constant through 24 
hours post-dose. 
Bone marrow exposures to cytarabine and daunorubicin were higher and more sustained with Vyxeos than 
with the non-liposomal formulations. Dose-normalised AUCs were more than 2-times higher with Vyxeos 
administration, suggesting greater efficiency in delivering cytarabine and daunorubicin to the bone marrow. 
Assessment report  
EMA/486480/2018

The t½ values were more than 2-times longer with Vyxeos. In addition, the t½ values for cytarabine and 
daunorubicin in bone marrow with Vyxeos were at least twice as long as the t½ in plasma. The 
cytarabine:daunorubicin molar ratio in bone marrow was maintained close to the desired synergistic ratio of 
5:1 (range: 2:1 to 6:1) for the first 24 hours. In contrast, the molar ratio of cytarabine:daunorubicin with the 
non-liposomal formulations changed rapidly over the first 4 hours post-dose, reflecting no control of the 
desired molar ratio in bone marrow. 
A single-dose metabolism study was performed in rats to determine the metabolite profile of 14C-
daunorubicin associated with administration of Vyxeos and a non-liposomal presentation (daunorubicin in 
saline) in plasma, urine, faeces, and bile. Parent daunorubicin was the only prominent circulating entity 
across the two formulations, accounting for approximately 91% of the total circulating radioactivity for 
Vyxeos and approximately 78% for the non-liposomal formulation. In the Vyxeos treatment, the only other 
radioactive component that accounted for at least ~3% of the plasma AUC for total radioactivity was 
daunorubicinol, which amounted to approximately 4% to 5%. The daunorubicinol metabolite:parent ratio 
based on plasma AUC was approximately 0.05 for Vyxeos. 
A single-dose vivo metabolism study was performed in rats to determine the metabolite profile of 14C-
cytarabine associated with administration of Vyxeos and a non-liposomal presentation (cytarabine in saline) 
in plasma, urine, feces, and bile. Plasma profiling showed that parent cytarabine was the only prominent 
circulating entity across the two formulations, accounting for approximately 97% of the total circulating 
radioactivity for Vyxeos and approximately 86% for the non-liposomal formulation. The only other radioactive 
component that accounted for at least ~1% of the plasma AUC for total radioactivity was AraU, which 
amounted to approximately 0.6% to 0.9% with Vyxeos and approximately 8% for the non-liposomal 
formulation. 
Single-dose 14C mass balance and biliary excretion studies were performed in both intact and bile duct-
cannulated male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (Studies XBL14629 and XBL13700). The results are 
displayed in Table 3 and Table 4.

Repeat dose toxicity 
A 2-Cycle IV Infusion Toxicity Study followed by a 28-Day Recovery Period in Sprague-Dawley Rats (Study 
1005-0361) 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the toxicity and toxicokinetic profile of Vyxeos when administered 
as 2 cycles (for a total of 3 doses/cycle) and to assess the reversibility of any test article-related effects 
following a 28-day recovery period. Test article or saline control was administered to 10 animals/sex (main 
study group) by IV infusion for a period of 1 hour at a dose rate of 20 mL/kg/h, as 2 cycles, on Days 1, 3 and 
5, and on Days 22, 24 and 26. The control (Group 1) and high-dose (Group 4) groups included 5 additional 
rats per sex to serve as recovery groups.  
Mortality and poor condition leading to preterminal sacrifice, which were considered related to the test article, 
occurred at mid and high dose levels of Vyxeos. In Group 3 (mid dose), 8 of 10 male rats and 7 of 10 female 
rats died or were sacrificed early between Days 3 and 33; in Group 4 (high dose) all rats died or were 
sacrificed early between Days 8 and 16. Clinical signs preceding death included decreased grooming, 
decreased activity, dehydration, laboured respiration, and changes in the consistency/colour of faeces. The 
underlying histopathological changes that lead to the unscheduled sacrifices or preterminal deaths were 
mostly due to marked or severe hematopoietic hypocellularity of the bone marrow of the sternum and femur, 
as well as marked or severe lymphoid hypocellularity/atrophy of the spleen and thymus. There was also 
glandular and cryptal epithelium necrosis of the large and small intestinal mucosa. Other treatment-related 
changes, such as mild to marked haemorrhage in different tissues (testes, epididymis, adrenals, heart) and 
minimal to marked bacterial deposits in tissues such as the lungs, kidneys, bone marrow, and heart were 
considered secondary to the cytotoxic effects on the bone marrow.  
When compared with the control animals, there were no apparent drug-related clinical signs in Group 2 (low 
dose) and the 4 unscheduled terminations (1 male and 3 females) of this group were considered to be related 
to surgical catheterization and not test-article related. Drug-related reductions in body weight gain were 
noted in Group 2 (low dose) and surviving Group 3 (mid dose) animals, concomitant with reductions in food 
consumption. There were no ophthalmoscopy, coagulation, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis effects related to 
the administration of Vyxeos. Compared with controls, no neurologic effects of Vyxeos were evident in Group 
2 (low dose) rats; interpretation of neurologic assessment of rats in Group 3 (mid dose) was complicated by 
the poor clinical condition of the few remaining animals in that group and no definitive conclusion could be 
drawn. When compared with mean control values obtained on Day 34 (7 days after the last dose), a 
moderate drug-related reduction in WBC counts was noted in Group 2 (low dose). In addition, slight drug-
related decreases in RBCs and associated parameters, including platelet counts, were also noted. Among the 
5 surviving Group 3 (mid dose) rats, 4 animals showed marked reductions in white and RBCs, platelets, 
haemoglobin, and reticulocytes.  
When compared to control values, dose-related reductions in absolute and relative thymic and spleen weight, 
and prostate (for males only) were noted in Vyxeos -treated animals. A dose-related increase in absolute and 
relative adrenal weight was noted in Vyxeos -treated animals.  
Minimal to severe drug- and dose-related histological changes included hematopoietic hypocellularity of 
sternal and/or femoral bone marrow, lymphoid hypocellularity/atrophy of the spleen and/or thymus, and 
lymphoid hypocellularity/atrophy with or without sinusoidal erythrocytosis/hemorrhage of various lymph 
nodes.

A 2-Cycle IV Infusion Toxicity Study in Beagle Dogs followed by a 28-Day Recovery Period (Study 1005-
0372) 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the toxicity and toxicokinetic profile of Vyxeos when administered 
as 2 cycles (for a total of 3 doses/cycle) and to assess the reversibility of any test article-related effects 
following a 28-day recovery period. The test and control articles were administered by IV infusion (except as 
noted for Group 6 where the commercial formation of daunorubicin HCl was given as a slow IV bolus). 
Infusions were delivered over a 1-hour period at a dose rate of 20 mL/kg/h as 1 or 2 cycles. The first cycle 
was administered on Days 1, 3, and 5 to animals of all groups. The second cycle was administered on Days 
22, 24, and 26 to Groups 1 (control), 2 (vehicle), 3 (low dose), and 6 (comparative control). Due to the 
number of deaths and/or preterminal sacrifices in the high-dose Group 5 animals, the remaining animals in 
this group were sacrificed on Day 11. Subsequently, an additional haematology investigation was performed 
on all remaining animals prior to the start of the second cycle of dosing. After evaluation, the second cycle of 
dosing was not administered to surviving Group 4 (mid dose) animals. The surviving Group 4 animals were 
re-assigned as recovery animals to replace the animals from Group 5 (high dose) that were sacrificed early.  
No significant electrocardiography findings were noted. Following the first dosing cycle, all dogs in the high 
dose Vyxeos group (Group 5) were either found dead (2 males) or were sacrificed due to poor condition 
between Days 7 and 10. Two dogs in the mid-dose group (Group 4, 1 male and 1 female) were sacrificed in 
poor condition on Day 12. The probable cause of death in the dogs found dead and the main underlying 
affliction of those that underwent unscheduled sacrifice was considered to be severe bone marrow 
hypocellularity and/or moderate to severe enteric (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, and rectum) 
cryptal/glandular necrosis and lymphoid atrophy of gut-associated lymphoid tissue.  
Decreases in WBCs were evident in animals in Groups 3 (low dose) and 6 (comparative control) at Day 33 [6 
days after the last dose of Vyxeos or the non-liposomal free drugs]. These reductions were the result of 
marked decreases in absolute and relative neutrophil, monocyte, and eosinophil counts. In addition, mild to 
moderate decreases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet counts were noted in Groups 3 and 6. Group 4 
(mid dose) animals, having received only 1 cycle of drug treatment, showed mean haematology values 
similar to those of the control (Group 1) on Day 33 (with the exception of RDW and HDW). Following the 22-
day recovery period (Day 56), the haematological values for Group 4 animals were comparable to those of 
control animals, including RDW and HDW. 
Drug-related severe hematopoietic hypocellularity of sternal and/or femoral bone marrow was observed in all 
animals in the mid- and high-dose groups (Groups 4 and 5; 2 and 3 units/kg, respectively) that were 
sacrificed early. In addition mild to severe cryptal necrosis of the small intestinal mucosa (with or without 
cryptal epithelial hyperplasia or hypertrophy, cryptal dilation, villous atrophy, GALT lymphoid atrophy and 
mucosal hemorrhage) as well as marked to severe glandular necrosis of the large intestinal mucosa were 
noted in these animals. Moderate to severe splenic lymphoid necrosis and/or atrophy of the white pulp, 
moderate to marked thymic lymphoid cortical hypocellularity, and mild to marked lymphoid atrophy of the 
mandibular, mediastinal, mesenteric, or tracheobronchial lymph nodes were also present in the animals 
sacrificed early. Following the recovery period, there were no drug-related histopathological changes noted in 
the surviving dogs in the mid-dose group (Group 4; 2 units/kg) with the exception of 1 dog showing 
moderate splenic lymphoid necrosis. 
The plasma toxicokinetics of liposome-encapsulated cytarabine and daunorubicin (Vyxeos) and their 
respective metabolites, uracil arabinoside and daunorubicinol, were evaluated and confirmed a dose-
dependent increase in exposure to the test article.

Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies of were submitted with Vyxeos (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Cytarabine was genotoxic in cultures of normal proliferating human lymphocytes during late G2-prophase, 
i.e., when cells performed post-replication DNA repair. The frequency of chromosomal aberrations during 
metaphase increased with increasing drug concentration. The genotoxic damage was associated with a block 
in cell cycle progression at the G2 checkpoint, however, this block was consistently overridden before DNA 
repair was complete (checkpoint adaptation). Due to the inhibitory effects of cytarabine on post-replication 
DNA repair processes, activation of the G2 checkpoint blockade promotes the development of genomic 
instability instead of preventing it (4). 
In mutagenicity studies, the effects of Ara-C on the chromosomes of human leukocytes were tested (5). Ara-
C (10-5 M) induced chromosome aberrations in human leukocytes and the effects consisted of gaps and open 
breaks. 
In an in vitro transformation study, exponentially growing HF (secondary Syrian Golden hamster fetal) cells 
and H43 (rat) cells were exposed to various doses of cytarabine for 2 to 24 hours (6). Transformed effects 
were induced by various doses (10-3 to 10-7 M) of Ara-C. 
The effect of Ara-C was tested for the induction of micronuclei in mouse bone marrow erythrocytes (7). Ara-C 
was clastogenic at 12.5 mg/kg IP and 25 mg/kg PO. 
The cytogenetic effects of Ara-C were studied in in vivo and In vitro test systems (8). Male mice received 
either single or daily x5 IP doses of Ara-C at 0, 160, 440, 660, and 870 μg. Animals were sacrificed at 
different time intervals after single and multiple doses. Ara-C exhibited a strong mitodepressive effect in 
mouse bone marrow cells. The effect was more intense in the multiple-dose than single-dose treatment. 
Cytarabine caused a dose-dependent increase in structural abnormalities, polyploidy, and SCEs with both 
schedules. Ara-C caused sperm-head abnormalities after single- and multiple-dose administration. In vitro, 
Ara-C induced dose-dependent structural abnormalities in human leukocytes and in SCE analysis a significant 
effect was noted for all doses from 24-72 hour exposure. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies of were submitted with Vyxeos (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Published literature suggests that cytarabine is not carcinogenic in rats (9)(10). 
Berger conducted a long-term study of carcinogenic effect of Ara-C in Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats received 
either daily IP doses of 5 and 25 mg/kg or pulse doses of 500 mg/kg x 3/week for 72 weeks. Ara-C did not 
reduce the life-expectancy of the animals. Overall tumor incidence (malignant/benign) was slightly higher in 
male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day x 5 (38%), 5 mg/kg/day x 5 (35%) and 500 mg/kg x 3/week (87%) 
and female rats treated with 500 mg/kg x3/week (50%) than control. 
Weisburger tested mice and rats given IP doses of 125 and 250 mg/kg Ara-C 3 times a week for 6 months 
and observed for 1 year. Forty-eight of 50 female rats survived 18 months. Eighteen of these 49 (38%) rats 
had tumors and 6/18 tumors were malignant (10 breast, 3 pituitary, 2 adrenal). If the level of significance is 
computed for control vs treated rats with mammary tumors, its p-value (0.156) is not significant (Fisher’s 
exact test). Thirteen of 49 male rats that survived had tumors and only 3/13 were malignant. Only 10/50 
female and 13/50 male mice survived 18 months after IP doses of 62 and 125 mg/kg Ara-C. Tumor 
incidences were 2/10 (20%) in female mice and 6/13 (46%) in male mice. However, tumor incidence is not

an appropriate parameter for assessing carcinogenicity. There is no basis for concluding Ara-C is carcinogenic 
under the conditions of this experiment. 
The IARC Working Group (IARC 2000) conducted a carcinogenic evaluation of cytostatics (antineoplastic 
medicinal products), including daunorubicin, and classified daunorubicin under Group 2B – Drugs which are 
possibly carcinogenic to humans (generally, limited human evidence, but absence of animal evidence). 
Published literature reports that daunorubicin may be carcinogenic. It can cause renal and mammary tumors 
in rats (11). 
Multiple mammary tumors, mostly adenocarcinomas, were observed in 64% of female Sprague-Dawley rats 
administered a single IV dose of 10 mg/kg daunorubicin. The mean induction time in females was 80 days. 
Single mammary tumors, also mostly adenocarcinomas, were observed on average 91 days after injection in 
37% of the males (12). 
In another study in female Sprague-Dawley rats, a single IV injection of 10 mg/kg daunorubicin resulted in 
the development of mammary tumors in 11 of 24 (46%) of the animals within 8 months after injection. 
Tissue distribution studies found that the liver, kidney, heart, and intestines had higher daunorubicin 
concentrations than mammary tissue in the first 24 hours after injection. A comparison of the in vitro 
metabolism of daunorubicin in mammary tissue and hepatocytes demonstrated approximately 70% of the 
daunorubicin was metabolised in 90 minutes by hepatocyte homogenates, whereas no metabolism was seen 
with mammary tissue homogenates. In addition, daunorubicin injected directly into rat mammary gland was 
neither metabolised nor released into the systemic circulation. These results suggest that retention of 
daunorubicin in the mammary tissue may explain the preferential induction of mammary tumors in rats 
intravenously administered daunorubicin (13). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were submitted with Vyxeos (see discussion on non-
clinical aspects).

Local Tolerance  
No studies on local tolerance were submitted with Vyxeos (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Other toxicity studies 
Toxicological evaluation of copper as an excipient of Vyxeos  
Vyxeos contains copper gluconate, which plays a role in the retention of daunorubicin inside the liposome. 
The amount of copper gluconate in the to-be-marketed formulation of Vyxeos is 5 mg/mL for the 
reconstituted product, of which approximately 14% is copper. The maximum exposure to copper in patients 
under the currently proposed dosing regimen is 42.0 mg per induction dose and 27.3 mg per consolidation 
dose. A patient would theoretically have 319 mg maximum lifetime exposure to copper (5 total induction 
doses [100 units/m2] and 4 total consolidation doses [65 units/m2]). A lifetime exposure of 319 mg copper 
exceeds safe doses reported in the literature for either oral or parenteral administration of copper.  
Whole blood concentrations of copper were measured in several single- and repeat-dose nonclinical 
toxicology studies with the to-be-marketed Vyxeos formulation. In all cases, copper was administered as a 
component of Vyxeos. In single dose Study 1004-331, copper was administered at 0.5 to 2 mg/kg and blood 
samples for copper determinations were collected approximately 14 days after administration of the single 
dose. In repeat-dose Study 1005-0361, copper was administered at 0.5 to 1.5 mg/kg, and blood samples 
were collected approximately 7 or 28 days after the last dose for all animals except in instances of early 
termination. Whole blood copper concentrations increased relative to baseline in a dose-dependent manner. 
In the repeat-dose study, copper concentrations remained higher than baseline for 24 hours from 7 to 9 days 
after the last dose of Vyxeos administration; the highest copper level was observed in an animal that was 
sacrificed on Day 3, and corresponded to about 8 times the baseline concentration. Whole blood 
concentrations of copper concentrations returned to baseline several days to a few weeks after the last dose.  
Dogs also received copper as a component of Vyxeos. In single dose Study 1004-3342, copper was 
administered at 0.2 to 0.8 mg/kg and blood samples for copper determinations were collected predose and 
approximately 2 and 15 days after administration of the single dose. In repeat-dose Study 1005-0372, 
copper was administered at 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg, and blood samples were collected approximately 1 or 3 weeks 
after the last dose for all animals except in instances of early termination. On Day 2 of the single dose study, 
whole blood copper concentrations were increased relative to baseline in a dose-dependent manner; at the 
Assessment report  
EMA/486480/2018

highest dose level of 0.8 mg/kg, copper concentrations were 6 times higher than baseline. In both studies, 
copper concentrations returned to baseline within 8 to 15 days after the last dose.  
Copper levels in plasma, tissues, urine, and feces were used for mass balance calculations. Twelve days after 
single dose administration of Vyxeos in female rats, the total copper levels indicated that 2% of the total 
copper was associated with plasma and tissues and 85% was associated with feces and urine.  
Toxicological evaluation of cobalt as an elemental impurity in Vyxeos drug product  
Administration of Vyxeos induction and consolidation doses may result in exposure to approximately 4.2 and 
2.7 μg/day cobalt, respectively, leading to an absolute maximum total exposure of approximate 31.8 μg 
cobalt for any patient over a lifetime (i.e., 5 induction and 4 consolidation doses). Potential exposure to the 
4.2 μg/day exogenous cobalt can transiently exceed the ICH Q3D guideline parenteral PDE threshold (5 
μg/day).  
The acute oral rat no observed effect level of 175-mg/kg and the 90-day oral rat no observed adverse effect 
level of 3-mg/kg/day results in a > 70,000-fold and 1251-fold safety margin, respectively. There is a 2571-
fold safety margin at the clinical dose of 150 mg/day cobalt (approximately 1 mg/kg/day) that resulted in 
polycythemia following short-term (22 days) ingestion. The safety margin calculations were based on the 
most conservative estimate of bioavailability (18%) relative to the approximate 4.2-μg daily dose of cobalt 
that a patient could be exposed to following administration of a 60-mL induction dose.  
Peak blood cobalt concentrations as high as 0.117 μg/mL were not associated with clinically significant 
changes in haematological, thyroid, cardiac, or neurological parameters in healthy individuals following oral 
administration for 90 days. Theoretical maximum concentrations would be 0.0009 μg/mL, assuming 100% 
bioavailability of the approximate 4.2 μg daily dose of cobalt, given a 4800-mL human blood volume. This 
result in a 130-fold safety margin for the 4.2-μg/day cobalt dose administered during a Vyxeos induction 
dose. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Screening for Persistence, Bioaccumulation, and Toxicity 
The octanol-water partition coefficient (log P) of cytarabine, was determined by the Shake Flask Method 
(Liboiron, 2017). The log P of cytarabine at 21°C, determined for 3 different water:octanol ratios from 0.5 to 
2 using the shake flask method, was determined to be -2.02 ± 0.04. This result is comparable to the 
calculated log P estimate of -2.27 for cytarabine. For daunorubicin, the experimental value of log P reported 
in the literature is 1.83 (EPA, 2017), compared with the estimated value of 1.79. The experimental log P 
values for the drug substances cytarabine, -2.02, and daunorubicin, 1.83, are below 4.5; therefore, further 
screening is not necessary for persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity. 
Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration 
The PECSURFACEWATER value is not above 0.01 µg/L for both drug substances, therefore, the phase II 
environmental-fate and effect analysis is not required.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Vyxeos is a liposomal formulation of a fixed combination (5:1 molar ratio) of the antineoplastic drugs 
cytarabine and daunorubicin hydrochloride. Vyxeos was designed to enhance the anti-tumour efficacy of 
cytarabine and daunorubicin combination therapy by encapsulating both compounds within a drug carrier that 
maintains the synergistic 5:1 molar ratio for extended times after injection. The 5:1 molar ratio of 
cytarabine:daunorubicin HCl has been shown to  demonstrate the most optimal synergy against tumour cells 
synergy against tumour cells in vitro whereas reduced synergy or antagonism was observed at other ratios. 
Superiority of Vyxeos over free cytarabine:daunorubicin HCl cocktail treatment in anti-leukaemic efficacy was 
observed in a number of animal leukaemia models. In addition, Vyxeos liposomes were shown to be able to 
maintain the 5:1 molar ratio of cytarabine:daunorubicin HCl in plasma for an extended period of time 
compared to the free drug cocktail. Furthermore, within bone marrow that contained both normal and 
leukaemic cells, Vyxeos was shown to be preferentially taken up by the leukaemic cell population, however, 
the mechanism whereby this occurs is currently unknown. 
Consistent with ICH S9, no stand-alone safety pharmacology studies were conducted with Vyxeos. Safety 
pharmacology parameters were included as part of the repeat-dose toxicology studies in rat and dog. 
Although the safety pharmacology assessment was confounded by several toxicities, no unexpected CNS or 
CVS safety signals were evident. Overall, the safety pharmacology assessment did not identify toxicities other 
than those already well known for cytarabine and daunorubicin. In view of the known toxicities of both 
compounds, further non-clinical testing is not warranted.  
No stand-alone nonclinical pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have been conducted with Vyxeos. 
The risks of pharmacodynamic drug interactions are expected to be similar to those described in the SmPCs 
and literature of the referenced medicinal products (DepoCyte and DaunoXome) and, by inference, the 
respective active ingredients, cytarabine and daunorubicin. 
The PK studies were performed in mice, rats, and dogs and involved investigations of single- and repeat-dose 
PK, tissue distribution, metabolism, and excretion of Vyxeos following IV administration. The nonclinical 
species, strains, drug doses, and routes of administration were comparable with those used in the nonclinical 
pharmacology and toxicology programmes. The same liquid formulation used in the pharmacology and 
toxicology studies was also used in the nonclinical PK studies. 
Cytarabine:daunorubicin molar ratios in animal plasma were maintained near the desired 5:1 molar ratio for 
at least 24 hours after IV administration. This was attributed to high retention of the drug cargo within the 
liposomes. In vivo release from Vyxeos liposomes is deduced to be very slow, because only a very small 
fraction (<1%) of the total drug concentration in the circulation exists as free drug. 
Due to high retention of drug cargo within Vyxeos liposomes, when cytarabine and daunorubicin are 
administered to animals as components of Vyxeos, the liposomes appear to govern their tissue distribution 
and rates of elimination therefore whilst the non-liposomal drugs have markedly different CL, V, and t½, 
Vyxeos causes these PK parameters to converge. High and sustained plasma concentrations are achieved 
with Vyxeos because CL is approximately 100-times lower than those of the non-liposomal drugs. The volume 
of distribution is approximately the same as the blood volume, because the liposomes are mostly confined to 
the vascular space.  
Upon repeat-dose administration of Vyxeos in animals, there were no major deviations from dose 
proportionality or time linearity for cytarabine or daunorubicin. Very good allometric relationships indicate 
that excretion, metabolism, and distribution data in animals are likely to translate directly to humans.  
Assessment report  
EMA/486480/2018 
Page 39/103 
  
  
Tissue distribution data for cytarabine and daunorubicin suggested that Vyxeos liposomes are slowly taken up 
by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) in several tissues, particularly spleen. Intracellular 
accumulation of Vyxeos is higher within leukaemic than normal bone marrow cells (9.5-fold higher for 
cytarabine; 2.2-fold higher for daunorubicin), indicating selective targeting.  After internalization by 
leukaemia cells, Vyxeos liposomes undergo degradation, releasing the drug cargo within the intracellular 
environment and enabling the drugs to exert their antineoplastic activity. There were different patterns of 
tissue distribution for 14C-cytarabine and 14C-daunorubicin associated with Vyxeos versus the non-liposomal 
formulations. 
The major metabolism and biotransformation pathways in humans are similar to those in animals and 
qualitatively similar for Vyxeos versus non-liposomal drugs the only difference being that the rates of 
excretion are slower with Vyxeos.The presence of the major human metabolites (AraU and daunorubicinol) in 
rats and dogs suggested suitability of these animal models to predict Vyxeos safety in humans.  
The toxicology profile of Vyxeos is sufficiently characterised based on the data and information generated in 
the Vyxeos toxicology studies and is comparable with the known toxicological effects of cytarabine and 
daunorubicin. No unexpected or novel toxicities were noted for Vyxeos, beyond those reported for cytarabine 
or daunorubicin.  
Repeat-dose toxicity of Vyxeos was tested in two-cycle intravenous infusion toxicity studies with 28 day 
recovery periods conducted in rats and dogs. Adverse effects of Vyxeos occurred at all tested dose levels (low 
to null safety margins as based on systemic exposures) and were generally consistent with those known for 
non-liposomal daunorubicin and/or cytarabine, comprising mainly findings of gastrointestinal and 
hematological toxicity. Although central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular system parameters were 
included in these studies, given the observed morbidity and mortality, there was insufficient information to 
arrive at an integrated assessment of safety pharmacology of Vyxeos. Vyxeos contains daunorubicin, which is 
known for its profound cardiotoxicity potential, and cytarabine, which is known to be associated with CNS 
toxicities(SmPC, section 5.3). 
Carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted with Vyxeos(SmPC, 
section 5.3). This is acceptable since cytarabine and daunorubicin are well known compounds and their 
toxicological properties are well characterise and described in the SmPC.  
A high incidence of mammary tumours was observed about 120 days after a single intravenous dose of 
daunorubicin in rats (at about 1.7 times the human dose on a mg/m2 basis). Daunorubicin was mutagenic in 
in vitro tests (Ames assay, V79 hamster cell assay), and clastogenic in vitro (CCRF CEM human 
lymphoblasts) and in vivo (SCE assay in mouse bone marrow) tests (SmPC, section 5.3). 
Cytarabine was mutagenic in in vitro tests and was clastogenic in vitro (chromosome aberrations and SCE in 
human leukocytes) and in vivo (chromosome aberrations and SCE assay in rodent bone marrow, mouse 
micronucleus assay). Cytarabine caused the transformation of hamster embryo cells and rat H43 cells in vitro 
(SmPC, section 5.3). 
Cytarabine was clastogenic to meiotic cells (SmPC, section 5.3). 
Both cytarabine and daunorubicin, tested separately, showed teratogenic and embryotoxic effects in animal 
studies. Furthermore, daunorubicin caused testicular atrophy and total aplasia of spermatocytes in the 
seminiferous tubules in dogs and cytarabine, sperm-head abnormalities in mice. A single dose of cytarabine 
in rats, administered on day 14 of gestation, reduced prenatal and postnatal brain size and caused 
permanent impairment of learning ability (SmPC, section 5.3).

Based on findings in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with Vyxeos (SmPC, section 
4.6). 
Each vial contains 100 mg of copper gluconate, which corresponds to 14 mg of elemental copper. Vyxeos 
should only be used in patients with a history of Wilson’s disease or other copper-related disorder if the 
benefits outweigh the risks. Vyxeos should be discontinued in patients with signs or symptoms of acute 
copper toxicity (SmPC, section 4.4). 
The amounts of cobalt that patients will receive following the therapeutic administration of Vyxeos, is unlikely 
to pose an unacceptable risk to the intended patient population.  
While cytarabine is not a carcinogen, daunorubicin is a possible carcinogen, hence, Vyxeos may be associated 
with a carcinogenic potential. Both daunorubicin and cytarabine are genotoxic, therefore, Vyxeos may be 
associated with a genotoxic risk (SmPC, section 5.3). 
Environmental risk assessment has shown that Vyxeos is not anticipated to have the potential to be 
persistent, bioaccumulative, or toxic to the environment (SmPC, section 5.3).

2.4.3.  Methods 
The bioanalytical methods for cytarabine, daunorubicin and their respective metabolites were based on liquid 
chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) among the studies.  
Absorption  
Vyxeos is administered intravenously, therefore absorption is not applicable. The plasma PK of total 
daunorubicin following administration of Vyxeos is presented in Table 10.

Distribution 
The volume of distribution (%CV) for daunorubicin is 6.6 L (36.8%) and cytarabine is 7.1 L (49.2%). Plasma 
protein binding was not evaluated (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Elimination 
Based on published data, cytarabine to Ara-U and daunorubicin to daunorubicinol are important systemic 
metabolism pathways in humans, and Ara-U and daunorubicinol are major human metabolites. To assess 
these pathways with Vyxeos, data on the plasma PK of Ara-U and daunorubicinol were obtained from 13 – 26 
patients who received Vyxeos at 100 units/m2 on Days 1, 3, and 5 in Study 206. Plasma concentration-time 
profiles show that plasma concentrations of the metabolites were considerably lower than those of the parent 
drugs (~40-60% for daunorubicinol:daunorubicin and ~80% for AraU:cytarabine.  
Figure 3). Median Tmax of Ara-U and daunorubicinol after the Day 5 dose were 8.0 h and 26.2 h, respectively, 
i.e. substantially later than Tmax of the parent drugs. The mean AUClast metabolite/parent ratio was 3.22% for 
Ara-U/cytarabine and 1.79% for daunorubicinol/daunorubicin. These ratios are lower than the ratios typically 
reported for the non-liposomal products, ~40-60% for daunorubicinol:daunorubicin and ~80% for 
AraU:cytarabine.

The effect of Vyxeos on cardiac repolarization was determined following the first induction (100 units/m2 on 
Days 1, 3 and 5) in Study 206. ECG intervals at selected time points were obtained as the averages from 
triplicate recordings for all time points. Each ECG was interpreted using digital, on-screen software allowing 
the placement of electronic markers at the beginning and end of each ECG interval. The primary endpoint 
was to assess the mean change between time-matched measurements of Fridericia’s corrected QT-interval 
(QTcF) following the first induction dose of Vyxeos. Bazett’s corrected QT-interval (QTcB) was also tested for 
comparison. 
A total of 26 patients were enrolled in the study. Twenty-four patients had ECG and PK data; however, not all 
patients had data at all time-points reducing the number available for comparisons. The largest change from 
baseline, upper limit of the one-sided 95% CI of the ΔQTcF was 12.3 msecs at 4 hours post-SOI (start of 
infusion) on Day 1 (mean ± SD, 8.0 ± 11.69 msecs). At 3 hours post-SOI, the UB 95% CI was 10.7 msecs 
(mean ± SD, 5.3 ± 15.17 msecs), but it was not statistically significant. No other change from baseline 95% 
CI crossed was greater than 10 msecs (Figure 6). No patients had QTcF changes from baseline greater than 
60 msecs and no QTcF values were greater than 500 msecs.

2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin and cytarabine administered as Vyxeos were investigated in adult 
patients who received a dose of daunorubicin 44 mg/m2 and cytarabine 100 mg/m2 administered as a 90-
minute intravenous infusion on days 1, 3, and 5. The pharmacokinetics of each medicinal product was based 
on total plasma concentrations (i.e., encapsulated plus unencapsulated medicinal product). Following the 
dose administered on day 5, the mean (% coefficient of variation [CV]) maximum plasma concentrations 
(Cmax) for daunorubicin was 26.0 (32.7%) mcg/mL and cytarabine was 62.2 (33.7%) mcg/mL. The mean 
(%CV) area under the curve (AUC) during one dosing interval for daunorubicin was 637 (38.4%) mcg.h/mL 
and cytarabine was 1900 (44.3%) mcg.h/mL (SmPC, section 5.2). 
When daunorubicin and cytarabine are administered as components of Vyxeos, the liposomes appear to 
govern their tissue distribution and rates of elimination; therefore, while the non-liposomal medicinal 
products have markedly different clearance (CL), volume of distribution (V), and terminal half-life (t1/2) 
Vyxeos causes these pharmacokinetic parameters to converge (SmPC, section 5.2). 
The accumulation ratio was 1.3 for daunorubicin and 1.4 for cytarabine. There was no evidence of time-
dependent kinetics or major departures from dose proportionality over the range of 1.3 mg/3 mg per m2 to 
59 mg/134 mg per m2 (0.03 to 1.3 times the approved recommended dosage) (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Age, sex, race, body weight, body mass index, and white blood cell count do not have a clinically important 
effect on the exposure of total daunorubicin or cytarabine after adjusting dose by body surface area(SmPC, 
section 5.2). 
Assessment report  
EMA/486480/2018 
Page 52/103 
  
  
 
Insufficient pharmacokinetic data were collected in paediatric patients to draw conclusions (SmPC, section 
5.2). 
The pharmacokinetics of Vyxeos in patients aged > 85 years has not yet been evaluated. No data are 
available(SmPC, section 5.2). 
The pharmacokinetics of total daunorubicin and cytarabine were not altered in patients with bilirubin ≤ 50 
µmol/L. The pharmacokinetics in patients with bilirubin greater than 50 µmol/L is unknown(SmPC, section 
5.2). 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis using data from clinical studies in patients, no significant 
difference in clearance of daunorubicin or cytarabine was observed in patients with pre-existing mild to 
moderate renal impairment (30 mL/min ≤ creatinine clearance [CrCL] ≤ 59 mL/min for moderate, and 60 
mL/min ≤ creatinine clearance [CrCL] ≤ 89 mL/min for mild)) compared to patients with baseline normal renal 
function (CrCL ≥ 90 mL/min). The potential effects of severe renal impairment (CrCL 15 mL/min to 29 
mL/min, C-G) and end stage renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin and cytarabine 
administered as Vyxeos are unknown (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Vyxeos can be considered an optimised liposomal formulation of the standard 7+3 daunorubicin and 
cytarabine combination chemotherapy with the advantage of a synergy anti-tumour activity between 
cytarabine and anthracycline and the delivery of these two anti-neoplastic substances at a high cargo to the 
target leukaemic bone marrow.  
Anthracyclines are considered to be among the most active drugs in AML treatment but their use have been 
limited by the cumulative dose related cardiac toxicity. Vyxeos is associated with a lower cumulative dose of 
daunorubicin compared to 7+3 and there is no evidence of having a meaningful clinical effect on cardiac 
repolarization. However, long term safety data would still be needed to confirm any advantage with regards 
to cardiac toxicity, of no concern for this submission given the proposed patient population has very poor 
prognosis. Concurrent use of cardiotoxic agents may increase the risk of cardiotoxicity. Use of Vyxeos in 
patients who have previously received doxorubicin increases the risk of cardiotoxicity. Vyxeos should not be 
administered in combination with other cardiotoxic agents unless the patient's cardiac function is closely 
monitored (SmPC, section 4.5). 
No interaction studies have been performed with Vyxeos. The delivery of daunorubicin and cytarabine in the 
Vyxeos liposomal formulation is anticipated to reduce the possibility of interactions, because systemic free-
drug concentrations of daunorubicin and cytarabine are much lower than when administered as the 
non-liposomal formulation (SmPC, section 4.5). 
Hepatotoxic medicinal products may impair liver function and increase the toxicity. Since daunorubicin is 
metabolised by the liver, changes in hepatic function induced by concomitant therapies may affect 
metabolism, pharmacokinetics, therapeutic efficacy, and/or the toxicity of Vyxeos. Monitor hepatic function 
more frequently when Vyxeos is coadministered with hepatotoxic agents (SmPC, section 4.5). 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of Vyxeos has been reasonably well investigated. The relevant information has been included in the 
SmPC (sections 5.2).

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study CLTR0310-101 
This was a Phase 1, single arm, dose escalation study in subjects > 18 years with AML (multiply relapsed, 
refractory, or with first CR duration of ≤6 months), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), or high risk MDS.  
The primary objective was to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of Vyxeos (defined as maximum 
tolerated dose [MTD]) that could be given to patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. Secondary 
objectives were to evaluate the safety and dose limiting toxicities, PK parameters, and assess preliminary 
efficacy. 
Subjects were to receive up to 2 inductions and 1 consolidation. Vyxeos was administered by 90 minute IV 
infusions on Days 1, 3, and 5 for each induction and on Days 1 and 3 for each consolidation. Dose escalation 
was initiated at 3 units/m2 and a 2-phase accelerated dose escalation schedule was employed with early 
escalation by dose doubling and late escalation by 33% increments. Dose expansion occurred at the declared 
MTD. At every dose level subjects were monitored for signs of antileukemic activity. 
A total of 48 subjects were enrolled in the study, received at least 1 dose, and comprised the safety 
population. Two subjects were excluded from the efficacy evaluable analysis set (N = 46). The majority of 
subjects (60.4%) terminated treatment due to progressive disease or lack of response; 7 subjects (14.6%) 
completed the study. Two subjects discontinued the study due to AEs. 
Most subjects were male (64.6%), white (85.4%) and the mean (SD) age was 59.1 (15.34) years. Most 
subjects (89.6%) had AML; 3 subjects had ALL, and 2 subjects had MDS. At enrolment, the mean (SD) time 
since diagnosis was 11.4 (7.93) months. 
A total of 48 subjects were exposed to Vyxeos at doses from 3 units/m2 to 134 units/m2. Subjects had 1 to 
10 exposures and cumulative dose of 9 to 804 units/m2. Most subjects (26/48, 54%) were treated at the 
higher dose levels (ie, 101 and 134 units/m2). Vyxeos at a dose of 134 units/m2 was administered to 6 
adults, and dose-limiting toxicities were observed in 3 subjects (hypertensive crisis, reduced left ventricular 
ejection fraction in the clinical context of sepsis, and prolonged cytopenia).  
Therefore, the MTD in this study and the dose recommended for Phase 2 was 101 units/m2 administered by a 
90 minute IV infusion on Days 1, 3, and 5 for each induction course and on Days 1 and 3 for each 
consolidation course in subjects able to tolerate intensive chemotherapy.

Table 11. Actual Administered Dose Levels and Number of Patients 
The key efficacy findings were that responses were achieved in multiple subjects, most with prior exposure to 
cytarabine and daunorubicin. No clinical responses were observed in any patient receiving less than 32 
units/m2 of CPX 351. Neither of the two patients with high-risk MDS responded.  
Forty-three patients with AML were treated and 41 patients completed one induction course of therapy. Two 
patients received only two of the planned three doses before adverse events led to treatment discontinuation. 
Ten of 43 AML patients cleared their leukaemias, including one patient with multiple relapses who achieved 
complete responses with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) after treatment at 32 units/m2 following two 
induction courses. 
Complete responses (CR) were achieved after single induction course at dose level as low as 43 units/m2. At 
the MTD dose level, aplasia was observed in 13 of 20 patients leading to 5 CR, 4 of which lasted longer than 
6 months (including two consolidated with stem cell transplant). There were 7 CR among 22 AML patients 
receiving Vyxeos as first salvage, 1 CR and 1 CRp among the 11 patients given second salvage, and 1 CR 
among the 10 treated with third or greater salvage. Among the first salvage patients there were 5 patients 
with primary induction failure (PIF) 1 of whom achieved CR. 
Not unexpectedly, Vyxeos showed substantially greater anti-leukemic efficacy among younger first relapse 
patients, with 4 of 7 (57.1%) patients aged 18-60 achieving CR compared with only 2 of 11 (18.2%) patients 
older than 60. Among the 18 first relapse patients, CR was achieved in 6, and of these patients the remission 
achieved following Vyxeos was longer than the initial remission in 2 patients (12 vs 16+ months in patient 
03-018 at the 101 units/m2 dose level, and 2 vs 5.4 months in patient 03-006 at the 32 units/m2 dose level). 
DLTs in this study were hypertensive crisis, prolonged cytopenia and congestive heart failure. 
The cardiotoxic potential of daunorubicin has been appreciated for at least two decades and cardiac toxicity is 
a well-known side effect of anthracycline therapy, so it is unsurprising that this was observed as a DLT. The 
predominant AEs in this study are related to myelosuppression and its consequences, infections with 
opportunistic organisms during the myelosupressed period. At the recommended Phase 2 dose, 101units/m2, 
there does not seem to be an unusual predisposition to observe the classic cardiovascular consequences of 
anthracycline exposure, which are largely related to cumulative doses. Cardiac events were observed, 
including one patient treated at the Phase 2 recommended dose. 
The declared MTD in this study and the dose recommended for Phase 2 was 101 units/m2 administered by a 
90 minute IV infusion on Days 1, 3, and 5 for each induction course and on Days 1 and 3 for each 
consolidation course in patients able to tolerate intensive chemotherapy.

Vyxeos or cytarabine and daunorubicin given as a 7+3. The number of inductions and consolidations received 
depended on response confirmed by bone marrow assessment. 
The follow-up phase began 30 days after the completion of the last induction or consolidation course, and 
was to last until death or 5 years after randomization.  
The initial induction course began within 24 hours of randomization. 
Each unit of Vyxeos contained 1 mg cytarabine and 0.44 mg daunorubicin base in liposomes. 
First induction: 
•  Vyxeos: 
100 units/m2 by 90-minute IV infusion on Days 1, 3, 5 
•  7+3: 
cytarabine 100 mg/m2/day on Days 1 through 7 by continuous infusion 
daunorubicin 60 mg/m2/day on Days 1, 2, and 3 
Second induction: 
•  Vyxeos  100 units/m2 by 90-minute IV infusion on Days 1 and 3 
•  5+2:  
cytarabine 100 mg/m2/day on Days 1 through 5 by continuous infusion  
daunorubicin 60 mg/m2/day on Days 1 and 2 
Consolidation: 
•  Vyxeos  65 units/m2 by 90-minute IV infusion on Days 1 and 3 
•  5+2:  
cytarabine 100 mg/m2/day on Days 1 through 5 by continuous infusion 
daunorubicin 60 mg/m2/day on Days 1 and 2 
Doses in both treatment groups could be delayed due to toxicities or hypersensitivity reactions. Any doses 
missed or delayed due to these events were administered as soon as the subject recovered from the event. 
Post remission therapy with bone marrow transplant was permitted either in place of or after postremission 
chemotherapy and was administered according to local practice. 
Permitted Therapies 
• 
Premedication for nausea and vomiting per institutional policy  
•  Subjects were not routinely pre-medicated for hypersensitivity or for potential infusion-related 
reactions prior to the first infusion of the first treatment course. If a subject developed a 
hypersensitivity reaction, then the subject should have been pre-medicated at all subsequent 
infusions. 
• 
Prophylactic use of anti-infectives was highly recommended during the period of neutropenia until the 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) returned to 500/μL or greater. The choice of anti-infectives was 
determined according to institutional protocol.  
•  Growth factors were allowed according to institutional protocol

Objectives 
The primary objective was to confirm the efficacy of Vyxeos compared with 7+3 as first line therapy in elderly 
patients (60 to 75 years old) with high risk (secondary) AML. 
The secondary objectives were to confirm the safety of Vyxeos and improvement in the rate of leukemia-free 
state, post induction response, remission duration, event-free survival, and overall best response rate. It also 
included assessment of serum copper elevations, population pharmacokinetics of Vyxeos and 
pharmacoeconomic. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) defined as the time from randomisation to death from any 
cause.  
Secondary 
- Event-free-survival (EFS): time from randomization until the date of induction treatment failure 
(persistent disease), relapse from CR or CRi or death from any cause, whichever came first. 
- Response: subjects who achieved CR or CRi during the treatment phase. 
- Best response: subjects who completed the induction(s) with a response of CRi but were upgraded to CR 
during or after consolidation 
- Remission duration: time from the date of achievement of a remission (CR or CRi) until the date of relapse 
or death from any cause. For subjects whose best response was upgraded from CRi to CR, the remission 
duration for CR+CRi analyses were calculated from the date of CRi to the date of relapse or death. 
- Morphologic Leukemia-free State: bone marrow blasts < 5% and the absence of Auer rods and/or 
extramedullary disease. All randomised subjects with at least 1 evaluable post-randomization bone marrow 
assessment performed on or after Day 14 after the last induction were assessed for MLFS. 
- The number and percentage of subjects transferred for HSCT after induction  
- Medical resource use to identify costs associated with planned and any unplanned treatment/support. 
Criteria used for assessment of response:  
• CR: bone marrow blasts < 5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; ANC 
> 1.0 x 109/L (1000/μL); platelet count > 100 x 109/L (100,000/μL); independence from red cell 
transfusions. 
• CRi: all the CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (< 1.0 x 109/L [1000/μL]) or thrombocytopenia (< 
100 x 109/L [100,000/μL]). 
Subject’s response to induction was made on the first day when all criteria for CR or treatment failure were 
met. Response was assessed locally and decisions about starting post-remission chemotherapy or referral for 
transplant were made per local institutional standards prior to independent review of response. An 
independent hematopathologist evaluated response assessments by reviewing bone marrow reports, data on 
peripheral blood and transfusion reports. The responses reported in this study are those confirmed by the 
independent hematopathologist. 
Assessment report  
EMA/486480/2018 
Page 59/103 
  
  
 
 
The independent confirmation of induction response was completed earlier than assessment of overall 
survival or other secondary endpoints. To minimise the potential for bias, the analysis of induction response 
with independent confirmation was prospectively incorporated as a final analysis into the study protocol and 
was initiated only after subjects had completed randomization and all study treatments. 
In addition, molecular mutation data for CEBPA, FLT3, and NPM1 were obtained via a central or local 
laboratory prior to the primary endpoint analysis. 
Sample size 
The study was designed to enrol 300 subjects so that a minimum of 270 subjects would be evaluable for the 
primary endpoint. It was anticipated that up to 10% of subjects would be ineligible or withdraw consent. All 
sample size and power justifications were based on evaluable subjects only. 
Assuming a median OS of 0.526 years in the 7+3 treatment group, 236 deaths were required for final 
analysis of OS with 93.7% power and a 1-sided significance level (α = 0.025) to detect a hazard ratio of 
0.635 between the 2 treatment groups. 
This study was designed to have 93.7% power for the primary endpoint to ensure that a sensitivity analysis 
of OS, which would censor subjects at the start of transplant, was powered at 90% for the same hazard ratio 
(0.635). 
Randomisation 
At registration, patients were randomised to receive Vyxeos (Study Arm A) or cytarabine + daunorubicin 
(7+3 regimen) (Study Arm B) in a 1:1 ratio. 
Randomization was stratified according to Age (60-69 vs 70-75) and AML type (t-AML vs MDS AML with prior 
treatment with hypomethylating agents vs MDS AML without prior treatment with hypomethylating agents, vs 
de novo AML with karyotype characteristic of MDS vs CMMoL AML). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open label study. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations: 
• 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT): all randomised subjects who were assigned to a treatment group. It constituted the 
primary efficacy population.  
•  Safety population: all subjects who received at least 1 dose of a study medication 
• 
Per protocol population (PP): subjects who were a subset of the ITT population, met all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, received at least 1 dose of a study medication, and have their AML diagnosis 
and type confirmed by an independent pathologist. The analysis of transfer to HSCT was performed on 
this study population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/486480/2018 
Page 60/103 
  
  
•  Morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS): subjects who were a subset of the PP population and had at 
least 1 evaluable post-randomization bone marrow assessment performed on or after Day 14 after the 
last induction. 
Analyses: 
Primary analysis: OS (ITT population). Subjects who did not die at last follow-up were censored on the date 
they were last known to be alive. Subjects were to be followed for up to 5 years. 
Sensitivity analyses: because of potential imbalances in use of HSCT, a sensitivity analysis was performed 
after censoring subjects at the start of HSCT, so that survival potentially attributable to HSCT could be 
removed. 
Subgroup analyses on time to event endpoints (remission duration and EFS) to assess whether the treatment 
effect differs according to the stratification factors. 
Exploratory analyses to determine which prognostic factors had a significant effect on the primary and 
secondary endpoints. The prognostic factors used were: sex, ECOG performance status, karyotype, white 
blood cell (WBC) category, platelet category, hemoglobin category, bone marrow blast count, and FLT3 
mutation. 
Method of analysis 
A stratified log-rank test was used to compare the Vyxeos and 7+3 treatment groups. In addition, the 
distribution of overall survival was estimated in each treatment group with the Kaplan-Meier methodology. 
The hazard ratio and overall survival at different time points, along with corresponding confidence intervals, 
were reported. Exploratory multivariate analyses were performed to assess the treatment effect adjusting for 
key prognostic factors using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. 
Timing of analysis 
The pre-planned analysis of induction response (CR+CRi) was performed after all subjects had been enrolled 
and completed induction and consolidation treatments. This analysis was reviewed by the DSMB to allow 
decisions for initiating other clinical studies of Vyxeos. The use of response information did not bias the 
conduct of the study because all subjects were randomised, had completed all study treatments, and had 
been followed long enough to recover from hematopoietic effects of treatment and because the remaining 
data to be collected on each subject consisted only of relapse and survival information. These analyses did 
not affect the conduct of the trial or the alpha of the primary endpoint. All other analyses were performed 
after the endpoint for the primary analysis had occurred. The analysis for the primary endpoint was 
performed after 236 deaths had occurred. The number of deaths was based on the alternative hypothesis.

Protocol amendments 
The initial protocol (Version 1.0) was issued on 22 May 2012. It was subsequently amended 4 times: on 12 
March 2013 (Version 2.0), 17 September 2013 (Version 2.1, never issued, changes incorporated in Version 
2.2), 9 October 2013 (Version 2.2), and 4 November 2013 (Version 2.3). 
Protocol amendments of clinical relevance were (Amendment version 2.0): Increased the sample size to 300 
to provide greater power. Consequently, the analysis of the primary endpoint was to be performed after 236

deaths occurred;  The mandatory second induction should occur only if it was safe to do so; Added an 
optional consolidation schedule (intermediate dose cytarabine, 1.5 g/m2 twice daily on days 1, 3 and 5) for 
subjects that had exceeded 500 mg/m2 lifetime exposure to daunorubicin or its equivalent; The assessment 
of early deaths was changed so that the assessment by the DSMB was conducted after the first 75 subjects 
had been evaluated for induction mortality 
Protocol compliance 
A total of 9 subjects (4 in the Vyxeos and 5 in the control) violated at least 1 of the inclusion criteria and 17 
subjects (5 in the Vyxeos and 12 in the control) failed at least 1 exclusion criterion.  A total of 9 protocol 
deviations were categorised as major deviations, 4 subjects in the Vyxeos and 5 in the control. In the Vyxeos 
arm two subjects had a delay of 1 week after randomization before they received the investigational product, 
a site delayed reporting an SAE for 1 subject who died, and 1 subject received 100 units/m2 instead of 65 
units/m2 for consolidation. In the control, 2 subjects were assigned the wrong AML subtype, 1 subject 
received idarubicin instead of daunorubicin for 1 treatment course, 1 subject had a delay in receiving 
daunorubicin, and 1 subject failed to sign the consent form for Amendment 2.

Sensitivity analyses 
In a sensitivity analysis that censored OS data at HSCT in the ITT population, a Kaplan-Meier analysis showed 
that subjects in the Vyxeos treatment group had median survival 7.75 months compared to 5.55 months with 
those in the 7+3 treatment group (HR=0.81, for log rank test, 1-sided p = 0.082, ).

No subjects in either the ITT or PP populations with a CRi response were upgraded to CR. Consequently no 
changes occurred in the proportions of subjects with a best response compared with the induction response. 
Secondary endpoint-EFS 
The median EFS was 2.53 (95%CI: 2.07, 4.99) months for the Vyxeos and 1.31 (95%CI: 1.08 , 1.64)  
months for the 7+3 treatment arms (HR = 0.74, 1-sided, p = 0.011). A Kaplan-Meier Estimate for EFS is

Supportive studies 
•  Study 204 
This was a Phase 2 multicenter, randomised, open-label, parallel-arm, fixed-dose study in subjects between 
60 and 75 years with newly diagnosed AML (de novo or secondary).  
Subjects were randomised 2:1 to receive either CPX-351or standard induction (7 + 3) stratified by standard 
or high risk category: High risk: > 70 years, prior hematologic disorder, ≥ 3 cytogenetic abnormalities at 
baseline and standard risk: all other subjects 
The primary objective was to estimate the rate of response and confirm the safety of Vyxeos compared with 
7 + 3 as first line therapy in elderly patients with standard or high risk AML. Secondary objectives were to 
determine OS, EFS and CR duration, the rate of aplasia after 1 or 2 inductions and  effectiveness of Vyxeos 
on response between de novo AML and secondary AML. 
The primary endpoint CR used the same assessment criteria as that for Study 301. 
Patients had a treatment phase (up to 2 inductions and 2 consolidations) and a follow-up Phase (from 
approx. 30 days after last induction or consolidation for up to 2 years from randomization). 
Assessment report  
EMA/486480/2018

•  Vyxeos arm: 100 units/m2 IV over 90 minutes on Days 1, 3, and 5 for the first induction and on days 
1 and 3 for second induction. For consolidation, 100 units/m2 on Days 1 and 3.  
•  7 + 3 arm: first induction with cytarabine 100 mg/m2/day on Days 1 through 7 by continuous 
infusion, and daunorubicin 45 to 60 mg/m2/day on Days 1, 2, and 3. For second induction and 
consolidation cytarabine was dosed on days 1 through 5 and daunorubicin on Days 1 and 2. 
Subjects in the control arm were permitted to cross over to receive Vyxeos if a response was not achieved 
after 2 induction courses or after 1 induction if investigators determined response to a second induction 
would be unlikely. Efficacy data were analysed based on assigned treatment. The data after crossover were 
excluded from analyses. A total of 127 subjects were randomised, 86 to Vyxeos and 41 to 7 + 3.  The 
efficacy analysis set (any subject randomised and treated with Vyxeos or 7+3) included 125 subjects (84 
subjects in Vyxeos, 41 subjects in 7 + 3). After 1 or 2 inductions, 10 subjects from the 7 + 3 group crossed 
over to the Vyxeos group. Mean (SD) age was 67.9 (4.69) years. Baseline demographics and disease 
characteristics (AML type, stratification risk, cytogenetic risk, and ECOG performance status) were well 
balanced across treatment groups.  The majority of patients were high risk (61%), intermediate cytogenetics 
risk (68%) and had de novo AML (65%).

EFS at 1 year (Efficacy Evaluable Set) showed a median EFS 161 days for Vyxeos and 55 days for 7 + 3 
(p=0.0971), HR 0.70 (95% CI (0.5, 1.1). Improved EFS for CPX 351 was seen in both age groups. 
The Kaplan-Meier estimate for median survival could not be estimated for any treatment group as the median 
was not reached because of insufficient follow up. The HR of OS at 1 year for the Vyxeos versus 7 + 3 was 
0.89 (95% CI 0.5, 1.6). The Vyxeos and 7 + 3 treatment groups had 39/84 (46.4%) and 18/41 (43.9%) 
deaths at 1 year, respectively.  
Study 205 
This was a Phase 2 multicenter, randomised, open-label, parallel-arm, active controlled study in patients 
between the ages of 18 and 65 with AML in first relapse. Subjects were stratified according to the European 
Prognostic Index and age, and received either Vyxeos or intensive salvage therapy. 
The primary objective was to estimate the efficacy of Vyxeos compared with intensive salvage therapy in 
patients with AML in first relapse. Primary endpoint was survival at 1-year but the study was not powered to 
detect a statistically significant difference. Secondary variables included CR (including CRi) rate and duration, 
EFS, rate of aplasia, and rate of transfer for stem cell transplant. 
Subjects were permitted to receive up to 2 inductions and 2 consolidations. The study comprised a treatment 
phase (up to 2 inductions and up to 2 consolidations) and a follow-up phase, from the completion of the 
treatment phase, and lasted for 1 year from the date of randomization. Only subjects with recovery from all 
the therapy related nonhematologic AEs and documented CR or CRi were eligible for consolidation. 
The dose of Vyxeos was 100 units/m2 by 90 minute IV infusion, on Days 1, 3, and 5 for the first induction and 
on Days 1 and 3 for a second induction or consolidation. Intensive salvage therapy (was chosen by the 
investigator. 
Results 
A total of 126 subjects were randomised, Vyxeos (81 subjects) and salvage therapy (45 subjects). The 
efficacy evaluable analysis set included the 81 subjects in the Vyxeos treatment and 44 subjects in the 
salvage group who received at least 1 dose of study medication. 
The demographic characteristics of the subjects were similar in the 2 treatment groups. Subjects had a mean 
(SD) age of 50.2 (11.57) years, ranging from 20 to 66 years; most subjects (82%) were between 18 and 60 
years old, had de novo AML (89.6%) or of intermediate cytogenetics risk (60.5%).  
The proportion of subjects surviving at 1 year, the primary endpoint, was higher in the Vyxeos arm (35.8%, 
29/81 subjects) than in the salvage therapy arm (27.3%, 12/44 subjects), but the difference was not 
statistically significant (p = 0.43; Fisher’s Exact). The median survival was 259 days (8.51 months) in the 
Vyxeos and 191 days (6.28 months) in the salvage arm (p=0.19; based on log rank test; HR of survival by 
1-year was 0.75 with 95% CI of [0.5, 1.2]). 
The rates of CR (37.0% vs 31.8%, respectively), CRi (12.3% vs 9.1%), and CR or CRi (49.4% vs 40.9%) 
indicated clinical improvement in the Vyxeos arm compared with salvage therapy, but the differences were 
not significant. The median duration of remission for subjects who achieved CR or Cri  was 301 days in the 
Vyxeos arm and 259 days in the salvage arm. Median EFS was longer in the Vyxeos arm (75 days) than in 
the salvage (43 days), HR of 0.67 (95% CI of [0.4, 1.0], p=0.06) for EFS by 1-year.The rates of aplasia at 
any time during the study and at Day 14 (first induction) were higher in the Vyxeos arm than in the salvage 
arm (76.5% vs 54.5%, respectively, at any time and 75.3% vs 52.3%, respectively, at Day 14). The 
Assessment report

percentage of subjects transferred to stem cell transplant was similar in the 2 arms: 46.9% in the Vyxeos 
arm and 47.4% in the salvage arm. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This application is supported by a single phase III clinical study (301) and the overall design is considered 
adequate.  
The patient population has been adequately selected and reflects those patients with high risk AML with 
documented prior haematological disorder as defined in the proposed indication. The pivotal study included 
only patients without prior anti-AML treatment and who were above 60 years of age. The comparator was the 
standard 7+ 3 regimen which is appropriate and allows a clear comparison of the liposomal formulation 
combination of cytarabine and daunorubicin versus the two components administered separately.  The choice 
of endpoints with OS as primary is satisfactory considering the poor prognosis in this type of AML population. 
All other secondary endpoints are also considered adequate.  
There is sufficient follow up for data maturity and to allow comprehensive assessment of results. The conduct 
of the study appears adequate and there are no concerns. Overall, the study design is in line with the main 
CHMP anti-cancer guideline and followed previous CHMP scientific advice.  
The phase II study 205 provides supportive data of Vyxeos in patients with AML (de novo or secondary) 
above 18 years of age and in first relapse. 
The proposed dose of Vyxeos and the regimen schedule, as administered in the pivotal study, have been 
justified by a dose finding study (101), data from earlier phase II studies (204 and 205) and an exposure 
dose analysis and it is considered acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Both arms in the pivotal study were balanced with regards to baseline demography and disease 
characteristics. A significant improvement of 3.6 months in OS with Vyxeos compared to the 7+3 standard 
treatment has been demonstrated in the pivotal study ITT population (median OS 9.56 months vs 5.95 
months; HR = 0.69, 95% CI : 0.52 to 0.90, 1-sided p = 0.003). This is a clinically relevant effect as the 7+3 
treatment has been the standard for over four decades and no therapy has shown to offer superior efficacy.  
The OS benefit was seen across all randomization strata or those with the adverse risk FLT3 mutation, except 
for the MDS AML with prior hypomethylating agent therapy.  
The favourable result is OS is supported by the outcome in secondary endpoints. A significantly greater 
proportion of subjects in the Vyxeos group achieved CR or CR+ CRi compared with the 7+3 group (CR 37.3% 
vs 25.6%; CR+CRi 47.7% vs. 33.3%). No clinical differences were seen in remission duration between 
Vyxeos vs 7+3 (median 6.93 months vs. 6.11 months). Favourable results for Vyxeos versus 7+3 treatment 
were also documented for EFS (median 2.53 months vs 1.31 months, HR = 0.74, 1-sided p = 0.011), 
achieving a morphologic leukaemia free state (69.0% vs. 55.5%) or the rate of bridging to transplant (52 
[34.0%] vs. 39 [25.0%]). 
More patients in the Vyxeos treatment group received a HSCT in CR or CRi compared with patients in CR or 
CRi for the 7+3 regimen (54.8% vs. 46.2%, respectively). 
Assessment report  
EMA/486480/2018 
Page 75/103 
  
  
An analysis landmarked at the time of SCT, showed that subjects who received a HSCT in the Vyxeos 
treatment group had significantly longer OS than the 7+3 group (HR=0.46, p = 0.009, 1-sided) with median 
survival not reached in the Vyxeos versus 10.25 months for 7+3. It is known that survival in high risk AML 
increases if the patient undergoes transplant, especially if achieved CR after induction.  
Overall the results across randomization data favoured Vyxeos over 7+3, especially across age subgroups. 
Most but not all the analyses across stratification subgroups showed positive outcome for Vyxeos. For the 
subgroup of patients with prior MDS treated with hypomethylating agents the control arm had a longer 
median OS than the experimental arm (7.43 m vs 5.65 m) despite the slight favourable results for CPX 351 
on CR/CRi, MLFS and patients receiving SCT. It is noted that the HR does not favour the control arm (0.98) 
and results in subgroups not powered for confirmatory efficacy should always be viewed with caution as some 
will be in the opposite direction just by chance.  
Overall, the results from study 301 support the indication in untreated patients with high risk AML as defined 
by therapy-related or with myelodysplasia changes. Although this study was conducted in patients of 60 
years up to 75 years no clinically differences in outcome were seen across both age subgroups (60-69 
years/70-75 years). PK data did not show variability with regards to age covariate and free fractions of the 
active substances relative to the encapsulated active substances are similar in the studied population to that 
of adults below the age of 60 years. In addition, data from study 205 in AML patients in first relapse showed 
a beneficial trend with Vyxeos versus salvage therapy (consisting mainly of cytarabine and an anthracycline 
and another agent) in patients below 65 years, the majority below 60 years. Vyxeos is an optimised 
liposomal formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin which is used to treat in AML of all ages fit for intensive 
chemotherapy although newly diagnosed younger patients may receive a more intensive treatment such as 
cytarabine + anthracycline + a third agent. On the other hand, there is no possible rationale why the results 
seen in study 301 cannot be extrapolated to adults of 18 years up to 60 years if they were to receive the 
standard 7+3. It appears there are no differences in disease biology with regards to t-AML and AML-MRC 
between age’s subgroups in adults.  
A point to mention is that Vyxeos is a more convenient therapy administered as 90 minutes’ infusions on 
separate days instead of the 7-days or 5-days continuous infusion cytarabine (with additional daunorubicin 
administration) of the standard 7+3. 
No data are available on the use of Vyxeos in children and this has been reflected in the SmPC. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of Vyxeos in the proposed dose/schedule in adult patients with untreated therapy-related AML or AML 
with myelodysplasia-related changes has been demonstrated. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
A total of 629 subjects were treated in the clinical studies and out of these, 403 subjects received at least 
one dose of Vyxeos. 
Safety data are presented for the pooled safety population that included all subjects in clinical studies 101, 
204, 205, 206 and 301 who received at least one dose of 100 or 101 units/m2 of Vyxeos. The 101 units/m2 
dose is considered the same as the 100 units/m2 dose. In Study 204, 10 subjects from the 7 + 3 group 
crossed over to Vyxeos and their data collected during treatment with 7 + 3 were summarised with 7 + 3, 
and data collected after cross over were summarised with Vyxeos. 
Assessment report  
EMA/486480/2018

The pooled population includes a broad range of AML patients with different AML subtypes, newly diagnosed 
and relapsed patients and of an age range of 18 to 80 years. 
Patient exposure 
The overall extend of exposure is displayed in Table 27.

In the pivotal study 301 all subjects received an initial induction, approximately one-third in both arms 
received a second induction and more subjects in the Vyxeos group received both an initial and second 
consolidation than in the 7+3 (Table 28).

In Study 301, similar percentages of subjects in the Vyxeos group (92%) and the 7 + 3 (91%) reported AEs 
Grade ≥ 3. The most frequently reported in both groups were febrile neutropenia (68% and 71%, in the 
Vyxeos and 7 + 3, respectively), pneumonia (20% and 15%), and hypoxia (13% and 15%). 
•  Related TEAEs

•  AEs of special interest 
Infections 
The incidence of infection was 94.1%  in the Vyxeos group compared with 1.9% in all controls regardless of 
treatment period. Most subjects experienced Grade 3 Infection AEs in both groups. The most frequently 
reported infection AE in both groups was febrile neutropenia (63.2% vs 59.7%, respectively). The incidence 
of other infection AEs was similar between Vyxeos vs all controls, with imbalances for pyrexia (29.1% vs 
22.0%), bacteraemia (10.7% vs 4.2%), and clostridium difficile infection (5.3% vs 1.7%).  
Pneumonia, sepsis and bacteriaemia were the most frequently seen serious infection ADRs in the clinical trial 
population. The incidence of infection events was 78.1%; the incidence of non-serious events of infections 
was 73.1%, the incidence of serious events of infections was 28.5%; the incidence of infections which led to 
discontinuation is 0.5%. The incidence of fatal infections was 6.9%. The fatal infections experienced were 
sepsis and pneumonia (SmPC,  section 4.8). 
Bacterial and viral infection occurred with similar frequency between Vyxeos and All Controls (87.5% vs 
84.7%, and 13.1% vs 10.2%, respectively). Fungal Infection occurred more frequently in subjects receiving 
Vyxeos (18.9%) than in control (11.9%). No viral or fungal infections led to discontinuation of study or death 
in any treatment group.  
The most frequently reported bacterial Infection in Vyxeos and control was Febrile neutropenia (63.2% and 
59.7% of subjects, respectively). The most common viral infection reported with Vyxeos was Herpes simplex 
(1.9%) and for All Controls it was oral herpes (3.0%). The most commonly reported fungal Infection was 
pneumonia fungal (3.5% in Vyxeos versus 1.7% all controls). 
Almost all subjects in study 301 in both treatment groups had at least 1 infection AE (92.8% vs. 92.7% in 
the Vyxeos and 7+3 arms respectively) and most were Grade 3 to 5 (84% vs 86%). The most frequently 
reported were febrile neutropenia, chills, pneumonia, pyrexia, sepsis, cellulitis, and bacteraemia. The most 
notable difference between the arms was for bacteraemia (9.8% vs. 2.6%), especially for grade 5 infections 
(7.2% vs. 2.6%). No grade 4 or 5 viral infections and no grade 5 fungal infections were reported. There were 
no notable differences between arms in viral or fungal infections.  
Bleeding 
A summary of bleeding AE by NCI-CTC Grade is displayed in Table 34.

The most common haemorrhagic event was epistaxis, and the majority of these were considered not serious 
(29.1%). The incidence of haemorrhage events is 69.1%; the incidence of non-serious events of 
haemorrhage was 67.2 %; the incidence of serious events of haemorrhage is 5.6%; the incidence of 
haemorrhage which led to discontinuation is 0. The incidence of fatal haemorrhage was 2.1% .Serious or fatal 
haemorrhagic events, including fatal central nervous system (CNS) haemorrhages, associated with severe 
thrombocytopenia were seen in patients treated with Vyxeos (SmPC,  section 4.8). 
In study 301 more subjects in Vyxeos than in the 7+3 group had a bleeding-related AE (74.5% vs. 59.6%, 
respectively), most were grade 1 to 2, and grade 3 to 5 occurred in 12% vs 8.6%, respectively. Four (2.6%) 
subjects in each arm had a grade 5 bleeding-related AE. The most frequent bleeding-related AEs were 
epistaxis, petechiae, mouth Haemorrhage and ecchymosis. The most notable difference between the Vyxeos 
and 7+3 groups was for epistaxis (35.9% vs. 17.9%, respectively), mouth haemorrhage (10.5% vs. 5.3%, 
respectively), and blood blister (9.2% vs. 3.3%, respectively). 
Cardiac 
During treatment period, cardiac AEs were more frequent in the Vyxeos group than in the All Controls but the 
difference is driven by Grade 1 AEs while similar incidences were reported for Grade 3-5 AEs. 
Table 23 Summary of Cardiac AE by NCI-CTC Grade – Treatment Period (Pooled Safety Population) 
The most frequently reported serious ADRs were decreased ejections fraction and congestive cardiac failure. 
The incidence of all cardiotoxicity events was 72.0%; the incidence of non-serious events of cardiotoxicity 
was 68.5 %; the incidence of serious events of cardiotoxicity was 9.1%; the incidence of cardiotoxicity which 
led to discontinuation is 0. 5%. Incidence of fatal cardiotoxicity events is 0.5%. Cardiac arrest was reported

as a fatal event; the patient experienced thrombocytopenia and neutropenia which contributed to cardiac 
arrest (SmPC, section 4.8). 
The most frequently reported Cardiac AE (Vyxeos vs all controls) were tachycardia (15.2% vs 12.7%, 
respectively), followed by chest pain (7.2% vs 5.9%) and atrial fibrillation (6.9% vs 8.9%) and there were 
small imbalances in pericardial effusion (5.1% vs 2.5%) and cardiac murmur (4.3% vs 0.8%).  
Grade 5 AEs were reported for 2 subjects in Vyxeos and included cardio-respiratory arrest (n = 1) and 
sudden cardiac death (n = 1). 
The most frequently reported Serious Cardiac AEs was ejection fraction decreased (2.4% for Vyxeos vs 3.4% 
all controls). 
The incidence of normal and abnormal ECGs was similar between the Vyxeos group and All Controls. 
Although an imbalance of ~10% incidence in Cardiac AEs was observed between Vyxeos and control groups 
during treatment (50.1% vs 41.9%), the incidence was similar during induction (45.3% vs 40.7%) while it 
was lower during consolidation for subjects receiving Vyxeos 65 units/m2 versus All Controls versus Vyxeos 
100 unit/m2 (15.4% vs 21.8% vs 31.7%) driven primarily by a reduced incidence of atrial fibrillation, 
tachycardia and pericardial effusion. 
Only 5 patients (3 in Vyxeos and 2 in all controls) had high prior use of anthracycline (≥ 500 mg/m2). Within 
the subgroups with low (n=94) and medium (n=65) prior anthracycline use, subjects in the Vyxeos group 
experienced a higher incidence of Cardiac AEs compared with control (41.8% vs 25.9%, and 40.4% vs 
16.7%, respectively) which was driven by the higher incidence of tachycardia in the Vyxeos (17.9% in low 
prior use and 21.3% in medium prior use).  
In study 301 nearly all subjects (96.7%) were anthracycline naïve and there were no differences between 
groups having a cardiac AE (49.0% vs. 47.7%, respectively) and most were grade 1 to 2 (grade 3 to 5 
reported for 16% vs 18%). The most frequently reported AEs for Vyxeos and 7+3 groups were tachycardia 
(15% vs 11.3%), atrial fibrillation (6.5% vs 10.6%), chest pain (7.8% vs 9.3%), ejection fraction decreased 
(5.9% vs 6.6%) and chest discomfort (5.9% vs 4%).  
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity reactions were very common ADRs in Vyxeos clinical trials. The most frequently reported 
hypersensitivity ADRs was rash and the majority of these were not serious (38.9%). The incidence of all 
hypersensitivity events was 66.9%; the incidence of non-serious events of hypersensitivity events was 66.4 
% of which 38.9 % were rash; the incidence of serious events of hypersensitivity is 1.1%; the frequency of 
hypersensitivity which led to discontinuation is 0. The frequency of fatal hypersensitivity events was 0 
(SmPC, section 4.8). 
Rash AEs were more common in the Vyxeos than in the All Controls group (58.4% vs 36.9%) during the 
treatment Period, mainly PT rash (39.2% vs 24.6%), but all AEs were ≤ Grade 3, no subjects discontinued 
due to rash and only 3 subjects (Vyxeos group) had a SAE rash.  
The incidence of rash was higher during induction for both Vyxeos and controls groups (56.5% vs 36.4%) 
and during consolidation the 65 units/m2 dose demonstrated a lower incidence (11.5%) compared with the 
100 units/m2 (38.1%) and was similar to the All Control (16.4%).

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Treatment with either Vyxeos or 7+3 led to neutropenia and thrombocytopenia within 5 to 7 days of the first 
induction course. The time to recovery in absolute neutrophils count (ANC) was delayed for a median of 7 
days (i.e. recovery longer than 28 days) for subjects receiving Vyxeos compared with 7 + 3. During 
consolidation treatment, time to ANC recovery was similar for subjects receiving 65 and 100 units/m2 Vyxeos. 
Platelet nadir was observed around day 14 regardless of treatment, but time to recovery is delayed for 
Vyxeos compared with 7 + 3. 
For subjects in Vyxeos arm who received only 1 induction, the median time from the start of induction to 
recovery from neutropenia (ANC value ≥ 1000/μL) was 37 days (vs. 29 days in control) and recovery from 
thrombocytopenia (≥ 100,000/μL) was 40 days (vs. 30 days in control). Similarly, the median time to 
recovery for all subjects in the ITT population was longer in the Vyxeos group than in the control (44 vs. 35 
days for ANC and 49 vs. 44 days for platelets, respectively).  
Although subjects treated with 2 inductions spend longer periods of time with neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia no clinically meaningful differences were observed in the time to recovery from 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia compared to those who received one induction. 
There were no clinically relevant changes in hemoglobin for Vyxeos compared with control treatment. 
In study 301 all subjects had a haematological toxicity of any grade during study and no notable differences 
were seen between Vyxeos and 7+3. Most subjects had grade 4 event, regardless of the grade they had prior 
to treatment, mainly neutropaenia (99% each arm) and thrombocytopaenia (98% vs 99%). 
Chemistry 
No clinically relevant changes in serum creatinine or serum bilirubin were observed. There was no indication 
of a difference in transaminase elevations during Study 301 for either study treatment.

Serum Copper 
Since Vyxeos contains copper encapsulated in the liposome, which acts as a chelating agent to maintain a 
slow release rate for daunorubicin, subjects were monitored for serum copper concentrations during each of 
the clinical studies in the Vyxeos program. 
In the Pooled Safety Population, upon administration of Vyxeos, a rise in serum copper levels during 
induction and consolidation periods was evident compared with control but, by the last observation post 
baseline median levels had begun to return to normal ranges. 
Study 206 included specific PK analysis of serum copper following administration of 3 doses of 100 units/m2 
Vyxeos every other day that resulted in increases in serum copper concentrations which returned to baseline 
levels within 10 to 11 days after the last dose.

Grade 3 AEs occurred with similar frequency between age groups for most SOC categories. For Vyxeos, a 
higher incidence was observed in subjects > 65 years for respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
(17.2% of subjects < 65, and 25.0% of subjects > 65), and vascular disorders (9.2% of subjects < 65, and 
14.2% of subjects > 65) driven primarily by a higher incidence in ≥ 65 years of atrial fibrillation (0.6% vs 
4.2%), hypoxia (5.5% vs 12.7%) and hypertension (4.3% vs 8.0%).  
Fewer deaths were reported for subjects treated with Vyxeos compared with All Controls, regardless of age 
group. Up to 60 days following treatment those < 65 years had comparable death rates between the 2

treatment groups (both had death rate of 12.9%) but subjects ≥ 65 years, the Vyxeos group experienced a 
reduced death rate compared with All Controls (12.3% vs 23.1%). 
No major differences were observed for related AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation by age category. 
Table 39 TEAE of Special Interest by Geriatric Status and Sponsor-defined Class – Study Period 
(Pooled Safety Population) 
•  Race 
Within the pooled population, related AEs and SAEs analysed by race category showed no major differences.  
•  Gender 
In the Vyxeos group, TEAEs leading to death were more frequent for female (23.3%) than male (15.3%) 
subjects; the opposite was true for the all controls (22.5% males vs 14.3% females). No major differences 
were observed for related AEs and SAEs. 
•  Renal function 
In the pooled safety population Vyxeos group, 181 subjects (48.3%) had normal renal function (CrCL ≥ 90 
mL/min), 139 (37.1%) had mild renal impairment (CrCL from 60 to 89 mL/min), 54 (14.4%) had moderate 
renal impairment (CrCL from 30 to 59 mL/min), and 1 (0.2%) had severe renal impairment (CrCL from 15 to 
29 mL/min). Overall there were insufficient numbers of subjects to evaluate possible relationships between 
renal function category and TEAEs leading to discontinuation or death. The incidence of SAEs was higher for 
the Vyxeos treatment group than the All Controls treatment group, regardless of renal function category. No 
notable differences were observed among renal categories in the incidence of any TEAEs Grade 3 to 5 or 
SAEs for either the Vyxeos or all controls (data not shown). 
•  Hepatic impairment 
In the pooled safety population, the majority of subjects who received Vyxeos had bilirubin less than 1.2 
mg/dL (332 subjects; 88.5%) and the remainder had bilirubin within the range of 1.2 to 3 mg/dL (42 
subjects; 11.2%). There were no patients with end stage disease or bilirubin higher than 3 mg/dL. 
Consequently, results of this subgroup analysis should be interpreted with caution.  
A higher incidence of SAEs was reported for Vyxeos group compared with all controls, regardless of hepatic 
function category. Few differences in the AE profile were observed for the Vyxeos treatment or when 
comparing the Vyxeos treatment group with all controls by hepatic function category.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There were no adverse events attributable to drug-drug interactions during the Vyxeos clinical development 
program. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the Pooled Safety population, less than 3% discontinuations due to TEAEs were reported and all occurred 
during induction (Table 41). 
Table 40 TEAE leading to discontinuation, by SOC and PT-treatment period (pooled safety 
population) 
In study 301 five subjects discontinued the study due to AEs, 3 subjects in the CPX-301 group (2%) due to 
cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy and acute renal failure (1 subject each), and 2 subjects (1.3%) in the 7 + 3 
group due to SAE of ejection fraction decreased.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
At least 403 subjects received one dose of Vyxeos and included a broad population of AML patients, both 
newly diagnosed and relapsed, and of an age range of 18 years up to 80 years. The proposed target 
population and dose regimen is well represented from 153 subjects treated with Vyxeos in the pivotal study 
301. The safety database in the proposed target population is considered adequate for assessment.  
Patients receiving Vyxeos in the proposed regimen and doses were exposed to a reduced total dose of 
cytarabine and daunorubicin compared to the standard 7+3 regimen despite having received a longer 
duration of treatment (study 301 median duration treatment with Vyxeos 62 days versus 41 days with 7+3). 
This would imply an advantage of Vyxeos therapy, especially with regards to cumulative dose exposure to 
anthracyclines, and is considered as a clinical benefit. 
The safety profile of Vyxeos appears in accordance with that expected from non-clinical data and is similar to 
the administration of the two components as 7+3.  
The incidence of AE was similar between treatment groups except for a moderate higher incidence of serious 
AE with Vyxeos. However, the reported AE leading to discontinuation was low in all treatment groups (< 2%). 
It is reassuring to observe that despite the higher exposure and cumulative dose with Vyxeos the reported 
frequency of AE is not worse than 7+3. 
Overall, the AE profile seen with Vyxeos was similar to all controls or 7+3 regimen. The most common AE 
reported with Vyxeos were febrile neutropenia, nausea, diarrhoea and constipation, and there are no 
differences across age subgroups.  
The most frequently occurring adverse reactions (ADRs) were hypersensitivity including rash, febrile 
neutropenia, oedema, diarrhoea/colitis, mucositis, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, decreased 
appetite, headache, cough, chills, arrhythmia, pyrexia, sleep disorders, and hypotension (SmPC, section 4.8). 
Vyxeos is associated with a more prolonged myelosuppression than 7+3, due to its PK properties of releasing 
a “full” cargo of daunorubicin and cytarabine to the bone marrow. Subsequently, it is not surprising that the 
recovery of neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia takes longer for Vyxeos, around 7-10 days extra. Although 
bleeding AE are reported with a higher incidence with Vyxeos than 7+3 most events are of low grade. In 
addition, infections were reported with similar incidence in both arms (around 92%-93%) but the difference 
between Vyxeos and 7+3 was seen in serious infections (32% vs 21%), especially bacteriaemia. The risk of 
serious infections appears to be managed with supportive care as it did not translate into a higher 
discontinuation of study treatment or overall AE related mortality (see section 4.8).  
Severe myelosuppression (including fatal infections and haemorrhagic events) has been reported in patients 
after administration of a therapeutic dose of Vyxeos. Serious or fatal haemorrhagic events, including fatal 
central nervous system (CNS) haemorrhages, associated with severe thrombocytopenia, have occurred in 
patients treated with Vyxeos. Baseline assessment of blood counts should be obtained, and patients should 
be carefully monitored during treatment with Vyxeos for possible clinical complications due to 
myelosuppression. Due to the long plasma half-life of Vyxeos, time to recovery of ANC and platelets may be 
prolonged and require additional monitoring (SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8). 
Prophylactic anti-infectives may be administered during the period of profound neutropenia until ANC returns 
to 500/μL or greater. If myelosuppressive complications occur, appropriate supportive measures should be 
used, e.g., anti-infectives, colony-stimulating factors, transfusions. Blood counts should be regularly 
monitored until recovery (SmPC section 4.4). 
Assessment report  
EMA/486480/2018 
Page 93/103 
  
  
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have been reported with daunorubicin 
and cytarabine. For moderate hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., moderate rash, flushing, mild dyspnoea, 
chest discomfort) the treatment should be stopped. Intravenous diphenhydramine (20-25 mg or equivalent) 
and intravenous dexamethasone (10 mg) should be given. The infusion should not be restarted. When the 
patient is retreated, Vyxeos should be given at the same dose and rate and with premedication (see section 
4.8). 
For severe/life-threatening hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., hypotension requiring vasopressor therapy, 
angioedema, respiratory distress requiring bronchodilation therapy, generalised urticaria), the treatment 
should be stopped. Intravenous diphenhydramine (20-25 mg) and dexamethasone (10 mg) should be given, 
and epinephrine (adrenaline) or bronchodilators should be added if indicated. Infusion should not be 
reinitiated, and no retreat is recommended. Treatment with Vyxeos should be permanently discontinued. 
Patients should be monitored until symptoms resolve (SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4). Of note rash, a known AE 
of cytarabine infusions was also reported at a higher incidence with Vyxeos but none of the events were of 
Grade 4/5, and it is easily managed with slowing the infusion or pre-medication.  
A dedicated study (206) showed no evidence of an effect of Vyxeos on cardiac ventricular repolarization. 
Whilst in the pooled safety population, that included some patients with prior anthracycline use, there was an 
increase in cardiac AE in the Vyxeos versus controls (50% vs 42%) the majority were of Grade 1 or 2 and 
serious AE were lower with Vyxeos (7% vs 11%). Tachycardia was the most common AE reported in all 
treatment groups. It seems there is no difference for prior anthracycline exposed patients versus 
anthracycline naïve, although only 5 patients in the data had received high dose of anthracyclines (above 500 
mg/m2) and 159 patients had low or medium prior exposure. Nearly all patients were anthracycline naïve in 
the pivotal study 301 and there were no clinically significant differences observed between Vyxeos and 7+3 
with most cardiac events of Grade1-2 and in line with the pooled safety population analysis. Long term 
cardiotoxicity effects are unknown (see section 4.8).  
Cardiotoxicity is a known risk of anthracycline treatment. Prior therapy with anthracyclines (including patients 
who have previously received the recommended maximum cumulative doses of doxorubicin or daunorubicin 
hydrochloride), pre-existing cardiac disease (including impaired cardiac function), previous radiotherapy of 
the mediastinum, or concomitant use of cardiotoxic products may increase the risk of daunorubicin-induced 
cardiac toxicity. Total cumulative doses of non-liposomal daunorubicin greater than 550 mg/m2 have been 
associated with an increased incidence of treatment-induced congestive heart failure. This limit appears lower 
(400 mg/m2) in patients who received radiation therapy to the mediastinum. The relationship between 
cumulative Vyxeos dose and the risk of cardiac toxicity has not been determined (SmPC section 4.4). 
A baseline cardiac evaluation with an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a multi-gated radionuclide angiography 
(MUGA) scan or an echocardiography (ECHO) is recommended, especially in patients with risk factors for 
increased cardiac toxicity. Cardiac function should be closely monitored.Treatment with Vyxeos should be 
discontinued in patients with impaired cardiac function unless the benefit of initiating or continuing treatment 
outweighs the risk (SmPC section 4.4). 
A comparison of Vyxeos with 7+3 in both, pooled analysis population or pivotal study 301 showed there were 
fewer deaths reported for the experimental treatment across the treatment and follow up phases. The 
primary cause of death during the first 30 or 60 days of the study 301 was progressive leukaemia and AE. By 
the end of study 301 similar proportions of patients died due to AE (~ 20%); although more grade 5 
infections occurred with Vyxeos vs 7+3 (10 subjects/6.5% vs 4 subjects/2.6%) most of these deaths were 
not considered related to study treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/486480/2018 
Page 94/103 
  
  
The incidence of serious AE was higher for Vyxeos than 7+3 in pooled analysis population and study 301 
(59% vs 43%), and the most common AE reported in study 301 were febrile neutropenia and sepsis due to 
the prolonged myelosuppression. The most serious and frequently occurring ADRs were infection, 
haemorrhage, and cardiotoxicity (SmPC, section 4.8). 
Daunorubicin has been associated with local tissue necrosis at the site of medicinal product extravasation. In 
clinical studies with Vyxeos, one event of extravasation occurred, but no necrosis was observed. Care should 
be taken to ensure that there is no extravasation of medicinal product when Vyxeos is administered. Vyxeos 
should be administered intravenously only. Vyxeos should not be  administered via an intramuscular, 
intrathecal, or subcutaneous route (SmPC, sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
There is no evidence of clinically significant abnormal serum copper levels due to the copper encapsulated in 
the liposome. In clinical trials the copper levels remained below 530 microg/mL (4 times above the ULN). 
Each vial contains 100 mg of copper gluconate, which corresponds to 14 mg of elemental copper. Vyxeos 
should only be used in patients with a history of Wilson’s disease or other copper-related disorder if the 
benefits outweigh the risks (SmPC section 4.4). 
Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines in patients that are immunocompromised by 
chemotherapeutic agents may result in serious or fatal infections. Vaccination with a live vaccine should be 
avoided in patients receiving Vyxeos. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered; however, the 
response to such vaccines may be diminished (SmPC section 4.4). 
It should be taken into consideration that the absorption of oral accompanying medicinal products may be 
considerably influenced by gastrointestinal mucositis and/or diarrhoea frequently occurring in association with 
intensive chemotherapy (SmPC section 4.4). 
No relevant changes were noted for chemistry laboratory investigations or urine analysis. Vyxeos treatment 
did not affect s-Crea or s-Bil implying no harmful renal or hepatic effects. There was no indication of a 
difference in transaminase elevations during Study 301 for either study treatment.  
Vyxeos may induce hyperuricemia secondary to rapid lysis of leukaemic cells. Blood uric acid levels should be 
monitored and appropriate therapy initiated in the event that hyperuricemia develops (SmPC section 4.4). 
Hepatic or renal impairment may increase the risk of toxicity associated with daunorubicin and cytarabine. 
Evaluation of hepatic and renal function using conventional clinical laboratory tests is recommended prior to 
administration of Vyxeos and periodically during treatment. There is no experience with Vyxeos in patients 
with baseline serum bilirubin greater than 50 µmol/L, severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 
30 mL/min), or end stage renal disease. Vyxeos should only be used in patients with a severe hepatic and/or 
renal impairment if the benefits outweigh the risks (SmPC, section 4.4). 
Although there was a higher incidence of bleeding events in patients above 65 years, the overall safety 
profile of Vyxeos is considered similar across age subgroups (< or > 65 years) which is important given the 
intensity of the proposed chemotherapy regimen. 
There were no adverse events attributable to drug-drug interactions during the Vyxeos clinical development 
program. 
Throughout all analyses the consolidation dose of 65 mg/m2 showed an improved safety profile compared to 
100 mg/m2 providing a strong justification for the proposed consolidation dosage. 
For the purpose of this application in AML patients with poor survival prognosis, the lack of long term safety 
data is not a concern.    
Assessment report  
EMA/486480/2018 
Page 95/103 
  
  
Vyxeos must not be substituted or interchanged with other daunorubicin and/or cytarabine containing 
products.  Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters, the dose and schedule 
recommendations for Vyxeos are different from those for daunorubicin hydrochloride injection, cytarabine 
injection, daunorubicin citrate liposome injection, and cytarabine liposome injection. The medicinal product 
name and dose should be verified prior to administration to avoid dosing errors. (SmPC section 4.4). 
Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while receiving Vyxeos. Women of 
childbearing potential should use effective contraception while they or their male partner undergo treatment. 
Women of childbearing potential should not receive treatment until pregnancy is excluded. Women of 
childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of Vyxeos. Men with sexual partners 
of reproductive potential and women should use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months 
following the last dose of Vyxeos (SmPC section 4.6). 
There are no data on the use of Vyxeos in pregnant women. Based on results from animal studies and its 
mechanism of action, Vyxeos should not be used during pregnancy, unless the clinical condition of the 
woman requires treatment and justifies the potential risk to the foetus (SmPC section 4.6). 
If the medicinal product is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving Vyxeos, 
the woman should be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus. In any case, cardiologic examination 
and a blood count are recommended in foetuses and newborns born to mothers who received treatment 
during pregnancy SmPC section 4.6). 
It is not known whether Vyxeos is excreted in human milk. Because many medicinal products are excreted in 
human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursingbreast feeding infants from 
Vyxeos, mothers should be advised to discontinue nursingbreast feeding during Vyxeos therapy (SmPC 
section 4.6). 
Vyxeos has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue and dizziness have been 
reported with the use of Vyxeos. Therefore, caution is recommended when driving or operating machines 
(SmPC section 4.7). 
If overdose occurs, exacerbation of adverse reactions associated with Vyxeos is expected and supportive 
treatment (incuding anti-infectives, blood and platelet transfusions, colony-stimulating factors, and intensive 
care as needed) should be provided until the patient recovers. Patients should be observed carefully over 
time for signs of cardiotoxicity and provide appropriate supportive therapy as clinically indicated (SmPC 
section 4.9). 
It is contraindicated in patients with history of serious hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of 
the excipients listed in section 6.1 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of Vyxeos is similar to standard 7+3 and is considered acceptable. The most 
common AEs reported with Vyxeos are febrile neutropenia, nausea, diarrhoea and constipation. Vyxeos 
produces a prolonged myelosuppression and a higher incidence of low grade bleeding events and serious 
infections that can be managed with appropriate supportive care.

2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
Safety concerns 
No important safety concerns were identified. As this drug combination (cytarabine and daunorubicin) has 
been in use for several decades the risks are well known, and they are also clearly presented in the PI. No 
critical difference between Vyxeos and the therapy with conventional daunorubicin/cytarabine combination is 
expected in this respect.  
Pharmacovigilance plan 
N/A 
Risk minimisation measures 
No additional risk minimisation measures are applicable. 
Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.2 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Based on different PUSR frequencies for daunorubicin and cytarabine, the CHMP is of the opinion that a 
separate entry in the EURD list for Vyxeos (cytarabine:daunorubicin) liposome for injection is needed, as it 
cannot follow the already existing entry for daunorubicin / cytarabine. The requirements for submission of 
periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP 
Opinion. The applicant did request the alignment of the new PSUR cycle with the international birth date 
(IBD). The IBD is 3.08.2017. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to determine the 
forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Vyxeos (daunorubicin and cytarabine) is proposed for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed therapy-
related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) or AMLwith myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the EU (European Union), approved agents include decitabine (Dacogen) which is authorised for the 
treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary AML, according to the WHO 
classification, who are not candidates for standard induction chemotherapy. Azacitidine (Vidaza) is also 
authorised for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for HSCT with AML with 20-30 % blasts 
and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to WHO classification and AML with >30% marrow blasts according to 
the WHO classification. In addition, histamine dihydrochloride (Ceplene) is authorised for adult patients with 
AML in first remission concomitantly treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2). Midostaurin (Rydapt) is authorised in 
combination with standard daunorubicin and cytarabine induction and high dose cytarabine consolidation 
chemotherapy followed by midostaurin single agent maintenance therapy for adult patients with newly 
diagnosed AML who are FLT3 mutation positive. Finally, Mylotarg is authorised in combination therapy with 
daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (AraC) for the treatment of patients age 15 years and above with 
previously untreated, de novo CD33 positive AML, except acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). 
AML has a poor prognosis with survival of 37.9% after one year and 17.1% after 5 years from diagnosis that 
decreases steeply with age, from 49.6% (patients aged 15-44 years) to 3.8% (patients aged ≥ 75 years). 
Amongst all AML types, high-risk AML as defined by therapy-related AML or AML with myelodysplasia-related 
changes carries a very poor prognosis and represents an unmet medical need. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main clinical study was study CLTR0310-301 a phase III, multicenter, randomised, trial of Vyxeos 
(cytarabine: daunorubicin) liposome injection versus cytarabine and daunorubicin in patients 60 -75 years of 
age with untreated high risk (secondary) AML study.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no important uncertainties or limitations about the favourable effects. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Due to the neutropenia experienced with Vyxeos, infections of various types were very common ADRs. 
Pneumonia, sepsis and bacteriaemia were the most frequently seen serious infection ADRs in the clinical 
studies population. The incidence of infection events was 78.1%; the incidence of non-serious events of 
infections was 73.1%, the incidence of serious events of infections was 28.5%; the incidence of infections 
which led to discontinuation was 0.5%. 
A variety of haemorrhagic events were seen in clinical studies. The most common haemorrhagic event was 
epistaxis, and the majority of these were considered not serious (29.1%). The incidence of haemorrhage 
events was 69.1%; the incidence of non-serious events of haemorrhage was 67.2 %; the incidence of serious 
events of haemorrhage was 5.6%; the incidence of haemorrhage which led to discontinuation was 0. The 
incidence of fatal haemorrhage was 2.1%.  
Hypersensitivity reactions were very common ADRs in Vyxeos clinical studies. The most frequently reported 
hypersensitivity ADRs was rash and the majority of these were not serious (38.9%). The incidence of all 
hypersensitivity events was 66.9%; the incidence of non-serious events of hypersensitivity was 66.4 %, of 
which 38.9 % were rash; the incidence of serious events of hypersensitivity was 1.1%. There were no 
hypersensitivity events which led to discontinuation and no fatal hypersensitivity events were recorded (see 
section 4.4).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Vyxeos has demonstrated a clinically significant improvement in overall survival compared to the standard of 
care 7+3 in the proposed population of patients with newly diagnosed AML with MRC and therapy related 
AML. This is remarkable given the very poor prognosis of these patients and their unmet medical need. 
Secondary endpoints support the primary outcome, in particular an increased rate of HSCT which is 
potentially the only curative treatment in AML.  
The safety profile appears similar to the known profile of 7+3 except for a more prolonged myelosuppression 
due to the liposomal formulation and an increase in serious AE, in particular infections. These appear to be 
managed with appropriate supportive care as the rate of discontinuations is low. There is no evidence of 
increased cardiac toxicity and in fact, despite longer exposure to treatment the cumulative doses of 
daunorubicin are lower than with 7+3.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In view of the effect in terms of OS and the known ADRs for such a combination (cytarabine and 
daunorubicin), the benefit-risk balance in the proposed indication is considered positive.

3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The pivotal study showed no clinically relevant differences in outcome across age subgroups (60-69 
years/70-75 years) although it excluded patients below 60 years of age. Vyxeos is an optimised liposomal 
formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin which is used as standard therapy in patients of all ages. Most 
patients that receive the standard treatment need to be fit for intensive chemotherapy, and therefore, 
whether the patient’s performance status and their suitability to receive the treatment is based on clinical 
judgement and the physician’s decision. In some younger patients with newly diagnosed AML, other 
treatments, like 7+3 plus a third agent, are sometimes used. However, for patients below 60 years scheduled 
to receive the standard 7+3, Vyxeos seems an optimised formulation which is very likely to be superior to 
7+3 given the results in > 60 years from the pivotal study. It appears there are no differences in disease 
biology for t-AML or AML-MRC between adult ages subgroups. Prognosis is very poor, and these subtypes of 
AML represent an unmet medical need irrespective of age. The exposure response analysis conducted in adult 
patients, included few patients below age of 60 and it indicated the proposed dose is the most appropriate. 
PK data did not show variability with regards to age covariate and results from studies 101 and 206 showed 
that free fractions of daunorubicin and cytarabine in patients below 60 years are similar to those above 60 
years. It is debated in the literature whether a higher cytarabine dose should be administered to younger 
patients with the aim to improve efficacy. However, there are discrepant results across published studies 
which have led to different dosages used across institutions. As the Vyxeos liposomal formulation delivers a 
higher “cargo” of daunorubicin and cytarabine to the bone marrow the dose of cytarabine seems acceptable 
for younger adults. Overall, extrapolation of data from the pivotal study can reasonably be made to adults 
below the age of 60 years. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Vyxeos is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Vyxeos is not similar to Vidaza, Ceplene, Dacogen, Rydapt and 
Mylotarg, within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Vyxeos is favourable in the following indication: 
Vyxeos is indicated for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid 
leukaemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Assessment report  
EMA/486480/2018 
Page 101/103 
  
  
 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 
6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable.

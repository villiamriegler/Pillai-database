severe hypocalcaemia (corrected serum calcium < 7 mg/dL 
or < 1.75 mmol/L) occurred in 3.1% of patients receiving 
treatment with XGEVA.  
Most cases of severe symptomatic hypocalcaemia have 
occurred in the first weeks of initiating therapy. The risk of 
developing hypocalcaemia during XGEVA treatment is 
greater with increasing degree of renal impairment. In a 
clinical study in patients without advanced cancer, 19% of 
patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
< 30 ml/min) and 63% of patients receiving dialysis 
developed hypocalcemia despite calcium supplementation. 
The overall incidence of clinically significant hypocalcemia

new additional data submitted by the MAH 
was 9%.   
Patients should be encouraged to report of symptoms 
indicative of hypocalcaemia. Examples of the clinical 
manifestations of severe symptomatic hypocalcaemia have 
included QT interval prolongation, tetany, seizures, and 
altered mental status (including coma). Symptoms of 
hypocalcaemia in clinical studies included paresthesias or 
muscle stiffness, twitching, spasms and muscle cramps.

the assessment of PSU/014, to revise the warnings 
in SmPC section 4.4 on osteonecrosis of the jaw 
(ONJ), and to add information in sections 4.4 and 4.8 
of the SmPC on the incidence of ONJ based on 
duration of exposure. The Package Leaflet and the 
RMP have been updated accordingly. 
C.I.3.b - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL 
intended to implement the outcome of a procedure 
concerning PSUR or PASS or the outcome of the 
assessment done under A 45/46 - Change(s) with 
new additional data submitted by the MAH 
informs prescribers of the risk of ONJ with XGEVA, provides 
information on the nature of these events, and guides 
physicians in the recognition and management of this risk. 
Further, a DHPC has also been agreed as an additional risk 
minimisation measure in order to inform prescribers of this 
safety concern and the subsequent changes to the SmPC. 
In clinical XGEVA trials, the incidence of ONJ was higher 
with longer duration of exposure. 
The patient-year adjusted incidence of confirmed ONJ was 
1.1% during the first year of treatment, 3.7% in the 
second year and 4.6% per year thereafter. Patients with 
prior history of ONJ or osteomyelitis of the jaw, an active 
dental or jaw condition requiring oral surgery, non-healed 
dental/oral surgery, or any planned invasive dental 
procedure were excluded from the clinical trials. 
Known risk factors for ONJ include invasive dental 
procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, oral 
surgery), poor oral hygiene or other pre-existing dental 
disease. Other risk factors for ONJ are advanced 
malignancies, infections, older age, concomitant therapies 
Page 16/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis 
inhibitors, radiotherapy to the head and neck), smoking 
and previous treatment with bisphosphonates. While on 
treatment, patients should avoid invasive dental procedures 
if possible.  
In patients with risk factors for ONJ, an individual benefit-
risk assessment should be performed before initiating 
therapy with XGEVA.  
For patients who develop ONJ during treatment, doctors 
should create a management plan in close collaboration 
with a dentist or oral surgeon with ONJ expertise, and a 
temporary interruption of treatment should be considered 
until the condition resolves and contributing risk factors are 
mitigated where possible. Patients should be encouraged to 
maintain good oral hygiene practices, receive routine dental 
check-ups, and immediately report any oral symptoms such 
as dental mobility, pain or swelling during treatment with 
XGEVA. Patients should also be advised to refer to the 
Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) for information on 
symptoms of ONJ.

C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - 
Addition of a new therapeutic indication or 
modification of an approved one 
eventually develop bone metastases and skeletal 
complications. Denosumab is currently licensed for the 
prevention of skeletal related events (SRE) in patients with 
solid tumours and known bone metastases. 
As part of the current procedure, the MAH initially applied 
for an extension of indication to add “treatment of 
castration-resistant prostate cancer at high risk of 
developing bone metastases as determined by assessment 
of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). XGEVA prolongs bone-
metastasis-free survival by preventing bone metastases”.  
During the procedure, as part of the response to the 2nd 
CHMP Request for Supplementary Information (RSI), the 
applicant revised the proposed indication to: 
“Delay of bone metastases in men with castration-resistant 
prostate cancer at high risk of developing bone metastases 
based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time of 6 
months or less”. 
Pivotal for this application was a placebo controlled study 
conducted in patients with CRPC at increased risk for bone 
metastases based PSA levels ≥8.0 ng/ml or PSA doubling 
time ≤10 months. As the study was initiated prior to the 
authorisation of XGEVA for prevention of SRE, study 
therapy was stopped at the time of diagnosis of bone 
metastasis. Thus, the benefit of early therapy vs. initiation 
of therapy at the time of overt bone metastasis cannot not 
Page 19/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be assessed. The primary endpoint was bone metastasis 
free survival. 
Following the assessment of the available data the CHMP 
concluded that in the full study population, the treatment 
effect in terms of bone metastasis-free survival has not 
been convincingly documented statistically. Furthermore, 
the apparent treatment effect is modest. Thus available 
data make attempts to undertake a thorough benefit – risk 
assessment futile in the full study population.  
In a post hoc identified subgroup where the apparent 
benefit of treatment is improved without signs of increased 
treatment related risks, the lack of external data supporting 
the notion that the activity of denosumab is increased, 
constitutes a major concern.       
In conclusion, altogether the benefit – risk balance in the 
proposed new indication has not been shown to be 
favourable. Therefore, the CHMP adopted the following 
major objection during the procedure: 
“This submission for an extended indication to encompass 
patients with CRPC is based on a single pivotal trial. In the 
ITT population, the treatment effect is small and the results 
are not considered robustly documented from a statistical 
perspective. 
Post hoc a subgroup of patients was identified with 
apparent increased benefit of therapy. Most likely, 
however, the benefit of therapy is overestimated and may 
not outweigh the risk of ONJ and thus a proper benefit – 
risk assessment cannot be undertaken.”  
In view of the outstanding major objection above, the MAH 
informed the CHMP of their decision not to pursue the 
claimed extension of the indication for XGEVA applied for 
Page 20/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
under the present procedure, but proposed nevertheless to 
pursue with the application to enable implementation of the 
safety-related changes to the SmPC and Package Leaflet, 
and the consequential changes to the risk management 
plan (RMP) that had been agreed during the CHMP review.   
The CHMP endorsed the MAH’s proposed way forward.  In 
view of the final revised scope of the application, the CHMP 
concluded that the proposed safety-related changes to the 
SmPC, Package Leaflet and RMP can be agreed. The 
benefit/risk balance for XGEVA remains positive in the 
already approved indication: 
“Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological 
fracture, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression or 
surgery to bone) in adults with bone metastases from solid 
tumours.”

Discussion “XGEVA-H-C-2173-II-11-AR”.

'atypical femoral fracture' reported in the post-
marketing setting. The Package Leaflet has been 
updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
potential for atypical femoral fractures in cancer patients 
treated with denosumab in clinical trials and the post-
marketing setting. 
A causal relationship of atypical femoral fracture with 
XGEVA cannot be ruled out, and therefore the MAH 
proposed that the XGEVA SmPC is updated to include 
atypical femoral fracture in the special warnings and 
precautions for use and undesirable effects sections.  The 
content of the information in the special warnings and 
precautions section is the same as that recently agreed for 
Prolia and informs prescribers of the risk of atypical femoral 
fracture with XGEVA, provides information on the nature of 
these events, and guides physicians in the recognition and 
management of this risk.  
Atypical femoral fractures have been reported in patients 
receiving XGEVA (denosumab). Atypical femoral fractures 
may occur with little or no trauma in the subtrochanteric 
and diaphyseal regions of the femur. Specific radiographic 
findings characterise these events. Atypical femoral 
fractures have also been reported in patients with certain 
comorbid conditions (e.g. vitamin D deficiency, rheumatoid 
arthiritis, hypophosphatasia) and with use of certain 
pharmaceutical agents (e.g. bisphosphonates, 
glucocorticoids, proton pump inhibitors). These events have 
also occurred without antiresorptive therapy. Similar 
fractures reported in association with bisphosphonates are 
often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be 
examined in denosumab-treated patients who have 
sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Discontinuation of 
XGEVA therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical 
femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of 
Page 22/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment. 
During XGEVA treatment, patients should be advised to 
report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. Patients 
presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an 
incomplete femoral fracture. 
There is no need for further risk minimisation activities. The 
overall benefit risk profile of XGEVA (denosumab 120 mg 
Q4W) remains favorable.

The calculated dose should be rounded to the nearest graduated increment. 
Discontinuation of treatment 
When discontinuing treatment, the dose should be decreased gradually. As with all anti-epileptic 
medicines, abrupt discontinuation should be avoided when possible to minimize the risk of increased 
seizure frequency and status epilepticus. A final echocardiogram should be conducted 3-6 months after 
the last dose of treatment with fenfluramine. 
Special populations 
Patients with renal impairment 
Generally, no dose adjustment is recommended when Fintepla is administered to patients with mild to 
severe renal impairment, however, a slower titration may be considered. If adverse reactions are 
reported, a dose reduction may be needed. (see section 5.2) 
Fintepla has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease. It is not known if fenfluramine 
or its active metabolite, norfenfluramine, is dialyzable. 
There are no specific clinical data on the use of Fintepla with stiripentol in patients with impaired 
renal function. Fintepla is therefore not recommended for use in patients with impaired renal function 
treated with stiripentol. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Generally, no dose adjustment is recommended when Fintepla is administered without concomitant  
stiripentol to patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B). 
In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) not receiving concomitant stiripentol, the  
maximum dosage for these patients is 0.2 mg/kg twice daily, and the maximal total daily dose is 17  
mg. 
There are limited clinical data on the use of Fintepla with stiripentol in patients with mild impaired  
hepatic function (see section 5.2).  
A slower titration may be considered in patients with hepatic impairment. If adverse reactions are  
reported, a dose reduction may be needed. (see section 5.2). 
There are no clinical data on the use of Fintepla with stiripentol in patients with moderate and severe  
impaired hepatic function. Fintepla is therefore not recommended for use in patients with moderate  
and severe hepatic impairment treated with stiripentol. 
Elderly 
There are no data on the use of Fintepla in elderly patients. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Fintepla in children below 2 years of age has not yet been established. No 
data are available. 
Method of administration  
Fintepla is to be administered orally. 
Fintepla may be taken with or without food. 
Fintepla is compatible with commercially available gastric and nasogastric feeding tubes (see section 
6.6). 
Fintepla contains a very limited amount of digestible carbohydrates and is compatible with a ketogenic 
diet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Aortic or mitral valvular heart disease. 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
Within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors due to an increased risk of 
serotonin syndrome. 
4.4   Special warnings and precautions for use 
Aortic or mitral valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension 
Because of reported cases of valvular heart disease that may have been caused by fenfluramine at 
higher doses used to treat adult obesity, cardiac monitoring must be performed using 
echocardiography. Patients with valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension were 
excluded from the controlled clinical studies of fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome and 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. No valvular heart disease was observed during these studies. 
Prior to starting treatment, patients must undergo an echocardiogram to establish a baseline prior to 
initiating treatment (see section 4.3) and exclude any pre-existing valvular heart disease or pulmonary 
hypertension. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Echocardiogram monitoring should be conducted every 6 months for the first 2 years and annually 
thereafter. If an echocardiogram indicates pathological valvular changes, a follow-up echocardiogram 
should be considered at an earlier timeframe to evaluate whether the abnormality is persistent. If 
pathological abnormalities on the echocardiogram are observed, it is recommended to evaluate the 
benefit versus risk of continuing fenfluramine treatment with the prescriber, caregiver, and 
cardiologist. 
Once treatment is discontinued for any reasons, a final echocardiogram should be conducted 3-6 
months after the last dose of treatment with fenfluramine. 
If treatment is stopped because of aortic or mitral valvular heart disease, appropriate monitoring and 
follow-up should be provided in accordance with local guidelines for the treatment of aortic or mitral 
valvular heart disease. 
With past use in higher doses to treat adult obesity, fenfluramine was reported to be associated with 
pulmonary arterial hypertension. Pulmonary arterial hypertension was not observed in the clinical 
programme, but because of the low incidence of this disease, the clinical trial experience with 
fenfluramine is inadequate to determine if fenfluramine increases the risk for pulmonary arterial 
hypertension in patients with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. 
If echocardiogram findings are suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension, a repeat 
echocardiogram should be performed as soon as possible and within 3 months to confirm these 
findings.  If the echocardiogram finding is confirmed suggestive of an increased probability of 
pulmonary arterial hypertension defined as “intermediate probability” by the 2015 European Society 
of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) Guidelines, it should lead to a 
benefit-risk evaluation of continuation of Fintepla by the prescriber, carer, and cardiologist. If the 
echocardiogram finding, after confirmation, suggests of a high probability of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension, as defined by the 2015 ESC and ERS Guidelines, it is recommended fenfluramine 
treatment should be stopped. 
Decreased appetite and weight loss 
Fenfluramine can cause decreased appetite and weight loss (see section 4.8). An additive effect on 
decreased appetite can occur when fenfluramine is combined with other anti-epileptic medicines, for 
example stiripentol. The decrease in weight appears to be dose related. Most subjects resumed weight 
gain over time while continuing treatment. The patient's weight should be monitored. A benefit risk 
evaluation should be undertaken prior to commencing treatment with fenfluramine in patients with a 
history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. 
Fintepla controlled access programme 
A controlled access programme has been created to 1) prevent off-label use in weight management in 
obese patients and 2) confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic 
cardiac monitoring in patients taking Fintepla.  
Somnolence 
Fenfluramine can cause somnolence. 
Other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, could potentiate the somnolence effect of 
fenfluramine (see sections 4.5 and 4.7). 
Suicidal behaviour and ideation  
Suicidal behaviour and ideation have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic medicines in 
several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials with anti-epileptic 
medicines that did not include fenfluramine has shown a small increased risk of suicidal behaviour and 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ideation. The mechanism of this risk is not known, and the available data do not exclude the 
possibility of an increased risk for fenfluramine. Patients and caregivers of patients should be advised 
to seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal behaviour and ideation emerge. 
Serotonin syndrome 
As with other serotonergic agents, serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, may 
occur with fenfluramine treatment, particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic agents 
(including SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, or triptans); with agents that impair metabolism of 
serotonin such as MAOIs; or with antipsychotics that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter 
systems (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). 
Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (eg, agitation, hallucinations, 
coma), autonomic instability (eg, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular 
aberrations (eg, hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea). 
If concomitant treatment with fenfluramine and other serotonergic agents that may affect the 
serotonergic systems is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly 
during treatment initiation and dose increases. 
Increased seizure frequency 
As with other anti-epileptic medicines, a clinically relevant increase in seizure frequency may occur 
during treatment with fenfluramine, which may require adjustment in the dose of fenfluramine and/or 
concomitant anti-epileptic medicines, or discontinuation of fenfluramine, should the benefit-risk be 
negative.  
Cyproheptadine  
Cyproheptadine is a potent serotonin receptor antagonist and may therefore decrease the efficacy of 
fenfluramine. If cyproheptadine is added to treatment with fenfluramine, patients should be monitored 
for worsening of seizures. If fenfluramine treatment is initiated in a patient taking cyproheptadine, 
fenfluramine’s efficacy may be reduced. 
Glaucoma 
Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Discontinue therapy in 
patients with acute decreases in visual acuity. Consider discontinuation if there is ocular pain and 
another cause cannot be determined. 
Effect of CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 inducers 
Co-administration with strong CYP1A2 inducers or CYP2B6 inducers will decrease fenfluramine 
plasma concentrations, which may lower the efficacy of fenfluramine (see section 4.5). If co-
administration of a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducer with fenfluramine is considered necessary, the 
patient should be monitored for reduced efficacy and a dose increase of fenfluramine could be 
considered provided that it does not exceed twice the maximum daily dose (52 mg/day) (see section 
4.2). If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with 
fenfluramine, consider gradual reduction of the fenfluramine dosage to the dose administered prior to 
initiating the inducer (see section 4.2). 
Effect of CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Initiation of concomitant treatment with a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor may result in higher 
exposure and, therefore, adverse events should be monitored, and a dose reduction may be needed in 
some patients. 
Coadministration of a single 0.35 mg/kg dose of fenfluramine with fluvoxamine (a strong CYP1A2 
inhibitor) at steady state (50 mg once daily) in healthy volunteers increased the AUC0-t of 
fenfluramine by a ratio of 2.1-fold and the Cmax by a ratio of 1.2-fold, and decreased the AUC0-t of 
norfenfluramine by a ratio of 1.3-fold and the Cmax by a ratio of 1.4-fold, as compared to 
fenfluramine administered alone.  
Coadministration of a single 0.35 mg/kg dose of fenfluramine with paroxetine (a strong CYP2D6 
inhibitor) at steady state (30 mg once daily) in healthy volunteers increased the AUC0-t of 
fenfluramine by a ratio of 1.8-fold and the Cmax by a ratio of 1.1-fold, and decreased the AUC0-t of 
norfenfluramine by a ratio of 1.2-fold and the Cmax by a ratio of 1.3-fold, as compared to 
fenfluramine administered alone.  
Excipients

12 ml, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
This medicinal product contains glucose which may be harmful to the teeth. 
4.5  
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other central nervous system depressants increase the risk of 
aggravated central nervous system depression. Examples of such depressants are other serotonergic 
agents (including SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, or triptans); agents that impair metabolism 
of serotonin such as MAOIs; or antipsychotics that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter 
systems (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
Clinical studies 
Effect of steady state stiripentol plus clobazam and/or valproate on fenfluramine 
At steady state in the Phase 3 studies, the co-administration of 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (0.4 mg/kg/day), 
maximum 17 mg/day, fenfluramine with a standard anti-epileptic medicine regimen of stiripentol plus 
clobazam and/or valproate, resulted in a 130% increase in fenfluramine AUC0-24 and a 60% decrease 
in norfenfluramine AUC0-24, as compared to 0.35 mg/kg twice daily (0.7 mg/kg/day), maximum 
26 mg/day, fenfluramine without stiripentol (see section 4.2). 
Effect of steady state cannabidiol on fenfluramine 
Co-administration of a single 0.35 mg/kg dose of fenfluramine with repeated doses of cannabidiol 
increased the AUC0-INF of fenfluramine by 59% and the Cmax by 10%, and decreased the AUC0-INF of 
norfenfluramine by 22% and the Cmax by 33%, as compared to fenfluramine administered alone. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Co-administration of a single 0.35 mg/kg dose of fenfluramine, with repeated doses of cannabidiol, 
did not affect the pharmacokinetics of cannabidiol, as compared to cannabidiol alone. No dose 
adjustment is necessary when fenfluramine is co-administered with cannabidiol. 
Effect of rifampicin (a strong inducer of CYP3A and 2C19 and a moderate inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, 
2C8 and 2C9), or strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducers 
Rifampicin induces multiple CYP enzymes which metabolize fenfluramine and norfenfluramine. 
Coadministration of a single 0.35 mg/kg dose of fenfluramine with rifampicin at steady state (600 mg 
once daily) in healthy volunteers decreased the AUC0--t of fenfluramine by 58% and the Cmax by 
40%,  and decreased the AUC0-t of norfenfluramine by 50%, and increased the Cmax of 
norfenfluramine by 13%, as compared to fenfluramine administered alone. An increase in 
fenfluramine dose may be necessary when coadministered with rifampicin or a strong CYP1A2 or 
CYP2B6 inducer (see section 4.4). 
Effect of CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors 
Coadministration of a single 0.35 mg/kg dose of fenfluramine with fluvoxamine (a strong CYP1A2 
inhibitor) at steady state (50 mg once daily) in healthy volunteers increased the AUC0-t of 
fenfluramine by a ratio of 2.1-fold and the Cmax by a ratio of 1.2-fold, and decreased the AUC0-t of 
norfenfluramine by a ratio of 1.3-fold and the Cmax by a ratio of 1.4-fold, as compared to 
fenfluramine administered alone.  
Coadministration of a single 0.35 mg/kg dose of fenfluramine with paroxetine (a strong CYP2D6 
inhibitor) at steady state (30 mg once daily) in healthy volunteers increased the AUC0-t of 
fenfluramine by a ratio of 1.8-fold and the Cmax by a ratio of 1.1-fold, and decreased the AUC0-t of 
norfenfluramine by a ratio of 1.2-fold and the Cmax by a ratio of 1.3-fold, as compared to 
fenfluramine administered alone.  
In vitro studies 
Effect of fenfluramine on other medicinal products 
Co-administration of a single 0.7 mg/kg dose of fenfluramine, with a single dose of a stiripentol, 
clobazam, and valproic acid combination, did not affect the pharmacokinetics of stiripentol, nor the 
pharmacokinetics of clobazam or its Ndesmethyl-metabolite norclobazam, nor the pharmacokinetics 
of valproic acid, as compared to the stiripentol, clobazam, and valproic acid combination alone.  
Effect of fenfluramine on CYP2D6 substrates  
In vitro studies indicate that fenfluramine may inhibit CYP2D6. It has been reported that steady-state 
desipramine concentrations increase approximately 2-fold with concomitant administration of 
fenfluramine. Co-administration of fenfluramine with CYP2D6 substrates may increase their plasma 
concentrations. 
Effect of fenfluramine on CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 substrates  
In vitro studies indicate that fenfluramine may induce CYP2B6 and may induce intestinal CYP3A4. 
Co-administration of fenfluramine with CYP2B6 substrates or CYP3A4 substrates may decrease their 
plasma concentrations. 
Effect of fenfluramine on MATE1 substrates  
In vitro studies indicate that norfenfluramine (major and pharmacologically active metabolite) may 
inhibit MATE1 at clinically relevant concentrations. Co-administration of fenfluramine with MATE1 
substrates may increase their plasma concentrations. 
4.6   Fertility, pregnancy, and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are limited data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of fenfluramine in pregnant 
women. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
in the absence of paternal or maternal toxicity (see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Fintepla during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether fenfluramine/metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Available pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of fenfluramine/metabolites in milk 
(see section 5.3). 
A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
Fintepla therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
No effects of fenfluramine on human fertility up to clinical doses of 104 mg/day were noted. However, 
animal studies suggest that Fintepla may possibly affect female fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Fintepla has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines because it may cause 
somnolence and fatigue. Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have 
gained sufficient experience to gauge whether it adversely affects their abilities (see section 4.8).

Decreased appetite and weight loss 
Fenfluramine can cause decreased appetite and weight loss. In the controlled trials of children and 
young adults with Dravet syndrome 34.7% of fenfluramine-treated patients had an adverse reaction of 
decreased appetite, compared to 7.6% of patients on placebo, and approximately 18.9% of 
fenfluramine-treated patients had a decrease in weight ≥7% from their baseline weight, compared to 
2.4% of patients on placebo. In the controlled clinical trials of children and adults with Lennox-
Gastaut syndrome, 27.8% of fenfluramine-treated patients had an adverse reaction of decreased 
appetite, compared to 11.5% of patients on placebo, and approximately 4% of fenfluramine-treated 
patients had a decrease in weight of ≥7% from their baseline weight, compared to 0% of patients on 
placebo. The decreases in appetite and weight appeared to be dose related. Most subjects resumed 
weight gain over time while continuing fenfluramine treatment. 
Status epilepticus and seizures 
In the Dravet syndrome phase 3 clinical trials, the observed frequency of status epilepticus was 1.5% 
in the placebo group and 5.1% in the combined fenfluramine group. In the LGS phase 3 clinical trial, 
the observed frequency of status epilepticus was 1.1% in the placebo group and 1.1% in the 
fenfluramine group. There were no discontinuations due to status epilepticus in the Dravet syndrome 
and the LGS phase 3 clinical trials. 
In the controlled trials in patients with Dravet syndrome seizures were reported less frequently in the 
fenfluramine treated patients (5.1%) than in patients on placebo (9.8%). However, seizures assessed as 
related to the study drug were more commonly reported in fenfluramine treated patients than placebo, 
2.8% of fenfluramine-treated patients compared to 1.5% of patients on placebo.  In the LGS trial, 
seizures were reported with a similar frequency in the fenfluramine treated patients (6.8%) and 
patients on placebo (6.9%). However, seizures assessed as related to the study drug were more 
commonly reported in fenfluramine treated patients than placebo, 6.3% of fenfluramine-treated 
patients compared to 1.1% of patients on placebo. 
The mean days to onset of seizure events in the LGS phase 3 trial after starting treatment was 26.3 
days in the fenfluramine 0.2 mg/kg/day group, 31.3 days in the fenfluramine 0.7 mg/kg/day and 31.3 
days in the placebo group. 
Echocardiographic safety assessments of valvular regurgitation 
Valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension were evaluated in the placebo-controlled 
and open-label extension studies via echocardiography for 341 Dravet syndrome patients and 263 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome patients. No patient developed valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial 
hypertension in the placebo-controlled studies or during the open-label extension studies with 
exposure of up to 3 years. In the Dravet syndrome double-blind studies, trace mitral valve 
regurgitation was reported in 17.9% of patients in the fenfluramine 0.2 mg/kg/day group (n=7/39), 
23.3% in the fenfluramine 0.4 mg/kg/day group (n=10/43), 22.5% in the fenfluramine 0.7 mg/kg/day 
group (n=9/40), and in 9.5% in the placebo group (n=8/84). Mild mitral valve regurgitation was 
reported in 2.3% of patients in the fenfluramine 0.4 mg/kg/day group (n=1/43). Trace aortic valve 
regurgitation was reported in 7.9% of patients in the fenfluramine 0.7 mg/kg/day group (n=3/40). In 
the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome double-blind study, trace mitral valve regurgitation was reported in 
14.8% of patients in the fenfluramine 0.2 mg/kg/day group (n=13/89), 17.6% in the fenfluramine 0.7 
mg/kg/day group (n=15/87), (and 22.1% in the placebo group (n=19/87). Mild mitral valve 
regurgitation was reported in 1.1% of patients in the fenfluramine 0.7 mg/kg/day group (n=1/87). 
Trace aortic valve regurgitation was reported in 5.6% of patients in the fenfluramine 0.2 mg/kg/day 
group (n=5/89) and 2.3% in the placebo group (n=2/87). One 11-year-old patient in the fenfluramine 
0.2 mg/kg/day group exhibited mild aortic valve regurgitation. No abnormalities in valve morphology 
were observed, and upon a diagnostic evaluation via transoesophageal echocardiogram, the finding 
was downgraded to absent. Trace and mild mitral regurgitation and trace aortic regurgitation are all 
11 
 
 
 
non-pathologic findings as defined by the 2015 ESC and ERS Guidelines. Where trace mitral or aortic 
regurgitation were observed, the results were often transient. 
Lethargy, somnolence, and fatigue 
In the controlled trials in subjects with Dravet syndrome, lethargy was commonly reported in 9.7%, 
and somnolence and fatigue/asthenia were very commonly reported in 13.0% and 18.1%, respectively 
in the fenfluramine treatment groups combined. In the controlled study with Lennox-Gastaut 
syndrome, lethargy was commonly reported in 4% of subjects. Fatigue/asthenia and somnolence were 
very commonly reported in 18.8% and 13.6% subjects, respectively. The majority of the adverse 
reactions of lethargy, somnolence, and fatigue/asthenia were reported in the first 2 weeks of treatment 
with fenfluramine and were mild or moderate in severity. Discontinuation due to lethargy, 
somnolence, and fatigue/asthenia was rare and, in most cases, these adverse events resolved or 
improved with ongoing treatment. In the controlled trials with Dravet syndrome, 0.8% and 
1.6%nsubjects in the fenfluramine treatment groups combined discontinued due to lethargy and 
somnolence, respectively. In the LGS study, 1.7% subjects in the fenfluramine treatment group 
discontinued due to somnolence.  
Gastrointestinal disorders 
In the Phase 3 LGS controlled trial in children and young adults, diarrhoea (11.9%) and vomiting 
(10.8%) were observed more frequently in the combined fenfluramine groups than in the placebo 
group (4.6% and 5.7%, respectively) during the 14-week titration and maintenance periods. The mean 
time to onset of diarrhoea in the fenfluramine groups was 25.0 and 26.1 days in the 0.2 mg/kg/day and 
0.8 mg/kg/day groups respectively versus 46.0 days in the placebo group while the mean time to onset 
of vomiting in the fenfluramine groups was 29.8 and 29.1 days in the 0.2 mg/kg/day and 0.8 
mg/kg/day groups respectively versus 42.8 days in the placebo group. 
In the LGS controlled trial through the open-label trial, diarrhoea and constipation were observed 
more frequently in the higher dose groups. The mean time to onset of diarrhoea was 215.7 days, 95.2 
days, and 79.6 days in the >0 - <0.4 mg/kg/day, 0.4 - <0.6 mg/kg/day, and ≥0.6 mg/kg/day mean daily 
dose groups respectively while the mean time to onset of constipation was 113.0 days, 173.7 days, and 
140.1 days in the >0 - <0.4 mg/kg/day, 0.4 - <0.6 mg/kg/day, and ≥0.6 mg/kg/day mean daily dose 
groups respectively. 
All events reported for diarrhoea and constipation were mild or moderate in severity.  
Infections and infestations disorders 
In the Phase 3 LGS controlled trial in children and young adults, upper respiratory tract infection 
(7.4%) was observed more frequently in the combined fenfluramine groups than in the placebo group 
(3.4%) during the 14 week titration and maintenance periods. The mean time to onset of upper 
respiratory tract infection in the fenfluramine groups was 42.9 days and 40.8 days in the 0.2 
mg/kg/day and 0.8 mg/kg/day groups respectively versus 46.7 days in the placebo group. 
A higher frequency of infections was reported in the active arm among 2–6-year-old age group in the 
LGS controlled study. The combined incidences of upper respiratory tract infections (including 
streptococcal pharyngitis, pharyngotonsillitis, rhinitis, sinusitis and viral upper respiratory tract 
infection) was most commonly reported in 14.2% of subjects in the fenfluramine treatment group. 
Bronchitis (2.3%), influenza (2.3%), otitis media (1.1%), and pneumonia (2.3%) were commonly 
reported. Most of these infections were reported for 2 or more subjects in the fenfluramine treatment 
group and were not reported in the placebo group. In the LGS controlled trial through the open-label 
trial, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis viral, and pneumonia were 
observed more frequently in the higher dose groups. The mean time to onset of these events was 6.0 – 
12 
 
 
155.1 days, 107.1 – 212.5 days, and 155.7 – 320.7 days in the >0 - <0.4 mg/kg/day, 0.4 - <0.6 
mg/kg/day, and ≥0.6 mg/kg/day mean daily dose groups respectively. 
All events reported for nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis viral, were 
mild or moderate in severity. Two cases of severe pneumonia were reported in the 0.4 - < 0.6 
mg/kg/day mean daily dose group during the open-label part of the trial. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Only limited data have been reported concerning clinical effects and management of overdose of 
fenfluramine. Agitation, drowsiness, confusion, flushing, tremor (or shivering), fever, sweating, 
abdominal pain, hyperventilation, and dilated non-reactive pupils were reported at much higher doses 
of fenfluramine than those included in the clinical trial program.  
Vital functions should be monitored closely, and supportive treatment administered in case of 
convulsions, arrhythmias, or respiratory difficulties.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics; ATC code: N03AX26 
Mechanism of action 
Fenfluramine is a serotonin releasing agent, and thereby stimulates multiple 5-HT receptor sub-types 
through the release of serotonin. Fenfluramine may reduce seizures by acting as an agonist at specific 
serotonin receptors in the brain, including the 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors, and also by 
acting on the sigma-1 receptor. The precise mode of action of fenfluramine in Dravet syndrome and 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is not known. 
Clinical efficacy 
Dravet syndrome  
Children and young adults with Dravet syndrome 
The effectiveness of fenfluramine in children and young adults with Dravet syndrome was evaluated 
in three randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled studies (1501, 1502, 1504). 
Study 1 (n=119) and Study 3 (n=143) are the prospective, merged analyses of the first 119 patients 
enrolled (Study 1) and the remaining subsequent total of 143 enrolled patients (Study 3) from 2 
identical double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, ZX008-1501 and ZX008-1502. Study 1501 and 
Study 1502 were conducted in parallel and the design was identical: 3-arm, multicentre, randomised, 
double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled studies consisting of a 6-week baseline period 
followed by a 2-week titration period and a 12-week maintenance period for a total of 14-weeks 
treatment. Patients taking concomitant stiripentol were not enrolled in these studies. Eligible patients 
were randomised 1:1:1 to one of two doses of fenfluramine (0.7 mg/kg/day or 0.2 mg/kg/day, 
maximum 26 mg/day) or placebo. The mean (standard deviation) age of patients enrolled was 
9.0 (4.7) years in Study 1 and was 9.3 (4.7) years in Study 3, with a range of 2 to 18 years. The 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
majority of patients were ≥6 years of age (73.9% in Study 1 and 74.6% in Study 3). All enrolled 
patients were inadequately controlled on at least one anti-epileptic medicine, with or without vagal 
nerve stimulation and/or ketogenic diet, the most frequently used concomitant anti-epileptic medicines 
(≥25% overall) being valproate, clobazam, topiramate and levetiracetam.  
In Study 1, the median baseline convulsive seizure frequency per 28 days was 34.0, 17.5, and 21.2 in 
the placebo, fenfluramine 0.2 mg/kg/day, and fenfluramine 0.7 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. In 
Study 3, the median baseline convulsive seizure frequency per 28 days was 12.7, 18.0, and 13.0 in the 
placebo, fenfluramine 0.2 mg/kg/day, and fenfluramine 0.7 mg/kg/day groups, respectively.

Study 2 (previously known as 1504) (N=87) was a 2-arm, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, 
parallel group, placebo-controlled study consisting of a 6-week baseline period followed by a 3-week 
titration period and a 12-week maintenance period for a total of 15 weeks treatment. Eligible patients 
were randomised 1:1 to fenfluramine 0.4 mg/kg/day (maximum 17 mg/day) or placebo added to their 
stable standard of care regimen of stiripentol (plus clobazam and/or valproate) and possibly other 
anti-epileptic medicines. The mean (standard deviation) age of patients enrolled in Study 2 was 
9.1 (4.80) years, with a range of 2 to 19 years. The majority of patients were ≥6 years of age (72.4%) 
and the minority <6 years (27.6%), male (57.5%) and, where reported, white (59.8%). All enrolled 
subjects were inadequately controlled on at least one anti-epileptic medicine, which included 
stiripentol, with or without vagal nerve stimulation and/or ketogenic diet. The median baseline 
convulsive seizure frequency per 28 days was 10.7 and 14.3 in the placebo and fenfluramine 
0.4 mg/kg/day groups, respectively.

Adults 
The Dravet syndrome population in Study 1 and Study 2 was predominantly paediatric patients, with 
only 7 adult patients who were 18-19 years old (3.4%), and therefore limited efficacy and safety data 
were obtained in the adult Dravet syndrome population. 
Open-label data 
Dravet syndrome patients who participated in Study 1 and Study 2 could participate in an open-label 
extension study (Study 5). The primary objective of the open-label study was long-term effectiveness 
and safety of fenfluramine at doses of 0.2 to 0.7 mg/kg/day, whereby the dose of fenfluramine could 
be titrated to optimize treatment. Data are reported for 330 patients who participated in the open-label 
study and received fenfluramine for up to 3 years (median treatment period: 631 days; range: 7-1086). 
A total of 23% of patients discontinued study participation during the open-label extension treatment 
period, including 15% due to lack of efficacy and 1% due to adverse events.  
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome 
Children and adults with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome  
The effectiveness of fenfluramine for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut 
syndrome in patients 2 to 35 years of age was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled study (Study 4 Part 1). 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study 4 Part 1 compared a 0.7 mg/kg/day (N=87) and a 0.2 mg/kg/day (N=89) dose (up to a maximum 
dose per day of 26 mg/kg) of fenfluramine with placebo.  Patients had a diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut 
syndrome and were inadequately controlled on at least one anti-epileptic medicine, with or without 
vagal nerve stimulation and/or ketogenic diet. The study had a 4-week baseline period, during which 
patients were required to have a minimum of 8 drop seizures while on stable anti-epileptic medicine 
therapy. Drop seizures included: generalized tonic-clonic, secondarily generalized tonic-clonic, tonic, 
atonic, or tonic-atonic seizures that were confirmed to result in drops. The baseline period was 
followed by randomization into a 2-week titration period and a subsequent 12-week maintenance 
period, where the dose of fenfluramine remained stable.     
In Study 4 Part 1, 99% of patients were taking between 1 and 4 concomitant anti-epileptic medicines. 
The most frequently used concomitant anti-epileptic medicines (in at least 25% of patients) were 
clobazam (45.2%), lamotrigine (33.5%), and valproate (55.9%). 
The primary efficacy endpoint in Study 4 Part 1 was percent change from baseline in the frequency of 
drop seizures per 28 days during the combined 14-week titration and maintenance periods (i.e., 
treatment period) in the fenfluramine 0.7 mg/kg/day group compared to the placebo group. Key 
secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients who achieve a ≥50% reduction from baseline 
in drop seizure frequency per 28 days for the fenfluramine 0.7 mg/kg/day group compared to the 
placebo group and proportion of patients who achieve improvement (minimally, much, or very much 
improved) in the Clinical Global Impression − Improvement (CGI-I) as assessed by the Principal 
Investigator for the fenfluramine 0.7 mg/kg/day group compared to the placebo group.  
In Study 4 Part 1, the median percent change from baseline (reduction) in the frequency of drop 
seizures per 28 days was significantly greater for the fenfluramine 0.7 mg/kg/day group compared 
with the placebo group (Table 6). A reduction in drop seizures was observed within 2 weeks of 
initiating treatment with fenfluramine, and the effect remained consistent over the 14-week treatment 
period.  
Among subjects with ≥124 drop seizures per 28 days during Baseline, the reduction in DSF were -
19.98%, -7.37%, -11.21% for subjects in the fenfluramine 0.7 mg/kg/day group, 0.2 mg/kg/day group, 
and placebo group respectively.

The median percent reduction from baseline in drop seizure frequency per 28 days for the lower dose 
of fenfluramine (0.2 mg/kg/day) during the Maintenance Period did not reach statistical significance 
compared to placebo (Median change between 0.2 group of patients and placebo in % change from 
baseline during Maintenance Period -11.48 [95% CI -26.61, 3.31]). 
The seizure type with the greatest median percentage change from Baseline in the fenfluramine 0.7 
mg/kg/day group relative to the placebo group was generalised tonic-clonic seizures (-45.7% 
fenfluramine 0.7 mg/kg/day [n=38] versus 3.7% placebo [n=38]).  
Lennox-Gastaut patients who completed Study 4 Part 1 could participate in Part 2, an open-label, 52-
week, flexible-dose extension study. The primary objective of Study 4 Part 2 was to assess the long-
term safety and tolerability of fenfluramine at doses of 0.2 mg/kg/day to 0.7 mg/kg/day. All patients 
received fenfluramine 0.2 mg/kg/day for 1 month, then the dose was titrated to optimize treatment. 
Among the 172 LGS subjects treated with Fintepla for ≥ 12 months, 46.5% had received a mean daily 
dose of 0.4 to <0.6 mg/kg/day, 33.7% received a mean daily dose ≥ 0.6 mg/kg/day, 19.8% received a 
mean daily dose of >0 to <0.4 mg/kg/day. 
Data are reported for 247 patients who enrolled in Study 4 Part 2 and received fenfluramine for a 
median duration of 364 days (range: 19-542 days). A total of 143 subjects had completed the study, 19 
subjects were ongoing, and 85 subjects had withdrawn. The most common reason for discontinuation 
was lack of efficacy (55 [22.3%]), adverse event (13 [5.3%]), and withdrawal by subject (13 [5.3%]). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Fintepla in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in Dravet syndrome (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine were studied in healthy subjects, in 
paediatric patients with Dravet syndrome, and in paediatric and adult patients with Lennox-Gastaut 
syndrome.  
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Absorption 
Fenfluramine has a time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) in the range of 3 to 5 hours at 
steady state. The absolute bioavailability of fenfluramine is approximately 68%-83%. There was no 
effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of fenfluramine or norfenfluramine. 
For fenfluramine, the Cmax occurs ~3 h following a single oral dose in healthy volunteers and is 28.6 
ng/ml following a dose of 0.35 mg/kg and 59.3 ng/ml following a dose of 0.7 mg/kg fenfluramine. The 
AUCinf is 673 ng × h/ml and 1660 ng × h/ml following 0.35 mg/kg and 0.7 mg/kg, respectively. For 
norfenfluramine, the Cmax occurs ~12 h following a single oral dose in healthy volunteers and is 11.7 
ng/ml and 16.1 ng/ml following a dose of 0.35 mg/kg or 0.7 mg/kg, respectively. The AUCinf is 798 ng 
× h/ml and ~800 ng × h/ml following 0.35 mg/kg and 0.7 mg/kg, respectively. Cmax and AUCinf of 
fenfluramine appear dose proportional over the 0.35 to 0.7 mg/kg dose range in healthy volunteers. 
The Cmax and AUCinf of norfenfluramine are less than dose proportional over the 0.35 to 0.7 mg/kg 
dose range in healthy volunteers. The AUCinf increase was 0.5-fold for the 0.7 mg/kg dose compared 
to the 0.35 mg/kg dose. The Cmax increase was 0.7-fold for the 0.7 mg/kg dose compared to the 0.35 
mg/kg dose. 
In paediatric Dravet syndrome patients following fenfluramine dosing of 0.2 mg/kg/day, administered 
twice daily, steady state exposure (AUC0-24) is 371 ng*h/ml for fenfluramine and 222 ng*h/ml for 
norfenfluramine. In paediatric patients following fenfluramine dosing of 0.7 mg/kg/day, administered 
twice daily with a maximum of 26 mg/day; steady state AUC0-24 is 1400 ng*h/ml for fenfluramine and 
869 ng*h/ml for norfenfluramine following a dose of 0.7 mg/kg/day, administered twice daily. Cmax,ss 
was 68.6 ng/ml for fenfluramine and 37.8 ng/ml for norfenfluramine. When stiripentol is given 
concomitantly, the steady state AUC0-24 is 1030 ng*h/ml for fenfluramine and 139 ng*h/ml for 
norfenfluramine following a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day, administered twice daily; the steady state AUC0-24 
is 3240 ng*h/ml for fenfluramine and 364 ng*h/ml for norfenfluramine following a dose of 
0.35 mg/kg/day, administered twice daily. 
In paediatric and adult patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who receive Fintepla 0.7 mg/kg/day, 
administered twice daily, up to a total daily dose of 26 mg fenfluramine, steady-state systemic 
exposure (Cmax and AUC0-24h) of fenfluramine is slightly lower on average but not considered to be 
meaningfully different than in patients with Dravet syndrome.  
The plasma half-life of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine indicates that approximately 94% of 
steady-state would be reached in approximately 4 days for fenfluramine and 5 days for 
norfenfluramine (4 half-lives). In healthy subjects, the Cmax accumulation ratio is 3.7-fold for 
fenfluramine and 6.4-fold for norfenfluramine and the AUC0-24 accumulation ratio is 2.6-fold for 
fenfluramine and 3.7-fold for norfenfluramine.  
Distribution 
Fenfluramine is 50% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro and binding is independent of 
fenfluramine concentrations. The geometric mean (CV%) volume of distribution (Vz/F) of 
fenfluramine is 11.9 (16.5%) L/kg following oral administration of fenfluramine in healthy subjects.  
Biotransformation 
Over 75% of fenfluramine is metabolised to norfenfluramine prior to elimination, primarily by 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP2D6. Norfenfluramine is then deaminated and oxidized to form inactive 
metabolites. The extent to which these inactive metabolites are present in plasma and urine is 
unknown. The involvement of enzymes other than CYPs (e.g. UGTs) in the metabolism of 
norfenfluramine is unknown, but literature data indicate that norfenfluramine may be glucuronidated 
to a significant extent. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Transporters 
Fenfluramine and norfenfluramine were not in vitro substrates of P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OATP1A2, OATP2B1, OCT1, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K. 
Elimination 
Most of an orally administered dose of fenfluramine (>90%) is excreted in the urine mainly as 
metabolite; less than 5% is found in faeces. The geometric mean (CV%) clearance (CL/F) of 
fenfluramine is 6.9 L/h (29%) and the half-life is 20 hours following oral administration of 
fenfluramine in healthy subjects. The elimination half-life of norfenfluramine is ~30 h. 
Special populations 
Genetic polymorphisms 
No impact of genotype in CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4 on fenfluramine or 
norfenfluramine PK was observed. 
Renal impairment 
Renal elimination is the predominant route of elimination of fenfluramine, with more than 90% of the 
administered dose eliminated in the urine as parent or metabolites. In a study comparing the 
pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 0.35 mg/kg fenfluramine in subjects with severe renal 
impairment (determined by modification of diet in renal disease estimated glomerular filtration rate  < 
30 ml/min/1.73m2) and matched healthy volunteers, Cmax and AUC0-t of fenfluramine increased by 
20% and 87%, respectively, in severe renal impairment. These increases in fenfluramine exposures are 
not clinically significant. Small and insignificant changes in AUC0-t and Cmax of norfenfluramine 
were observed in subjects with severe renal impairment. No dose adjustment is recommended when 
Fintepla is administered to patients with mild to severe renal impairment, however, a slower titration 
may be considered. If adverse reactions are reported, a dose reduction may be needed. 
Hepatic impairment 
In a study comparing the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 0.35 mg/kg fenfluramine in subjects 
with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B, or C, respectively), AUC0-
t of fenfluramine increased by 95% in subjects with mild hepatic impairment, 113% in subjects with 
moderate hepatic impairment, and 185% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment relative to 
matched subjects with normal liver function. Increases in Cmax of fenfluramine ranged from 19% to 
29% in hepatic impairment. Systemic exposures of norfenfluramine either increased slightly by up to 
18% (AUC0-t) or decreased by up to 45% (Cmax) in subjects with hepatic impairment. In subjects 
with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, the mean plasma elimination half-life of 
fenfluramine increased to 34.5 hours, 41.1 hours, and 54.6 hours, respectively, compared to 22.8 hours 
in subjects with normal hepatic function. The corresponding mean plasma elimination half-life of 
norfenfluramine was 54.0 hours, 72.5 hours, and 69.0 hours, respectively, compared to 30.2 hours in 
subjects with normal hepatic function. The differences in exposures in mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Dosage of fenfluramine should be reduced 
in patients with severe hepatic impairment. [see section 4.2, Posology and method of administration 
for special populations]  
The retrospective analysis of steady-state exposures of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine in Study 2, 
Cohort 2 (n=12) indicated no clinically meaningful changes in the absence or presence of stable doses 
of stiripentol in patients with Dravet syndrome in the Phase 3 trials who were categorized with mild 
hepatic impairment as compared to those with normal hepatic function (AST/ALT and BILI ≤ ULN). 
Fenfluramine is not recommended for use in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment 
treated with stiripentol. 
Body weight 
Drug clearance and PK exposure of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine are consistent across a broad 
range of BMI (12.3 to 35 kg/m2). 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gender 
The pharmacokinetics of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine were consistent between males and 
females. 
Race 
The evaluation was limited by the small sample size of non-white subjects that no conclusion on the 
effect of race on the pharmacokinetics can be made. The genetic polymorphs of the enzymes that 
metabolize fenfluramine are similar across races, only their frequency differs. Thus, although the mean 
exposure may differ slightly depending on race, the range of exposure would be expected to be 
similar. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction 
and development.  
In a lactation study, rats were dosed orally with radiolabeled dexfenfluramine at 1.2 mg/kg, and 
samples of plasma and milk were collected over 24 hours following the dose. Both dexfenfluramine 
and nordexfenfluramine were found in milk at 2 hours after dosing and levels declined over 24 hours. 
No dexfenfluramine was found in the milk at 24 hours. Nordexfenfluramine was present in small 
amounts at 24 hours. The radioactivity milk:plasma ratio was 9 ± 2 at 2 hours and 5 ± 1 at 24 hours. 
Based on a bodyweight comparison, the human equivalent dose (0.2 mg/kg dexfenfluramine) is less 
than the maximum recommended human dose of Fintepla. 
Reproduction and development 
Fenfluramine and norfenfluramine crossed the placenta in pregnant rats and rabbits. Plasma exposures 
were higher in rat foetuses than in the dams, while plasma exposures in rabbits were comparable 
between does and foetuses; however the effects in human foetuses are unknown. 
In an embryofoetal development study in rats, decreased foetal body weight and increased incidences 
of external and skeletal malformations were observed at the high dose level in association with 
maternal toxicity. No foetal abnormalities were noted at exposures at least five-fold the plasma AUC 
in humans administered the maximum recommended therapeutic dose of Fintepla. 
No fenfluramine-related external, visceral or skeletal malformations or variations were determined in 
an embryofoetal development study in rabbits but increased post-implantation losses were evident at 
all doses secondarily to fenfluramine maternal toxicity (body weight loss and decreased food 
consumption). Additional clinical signs of dilated pupils and increased respiration rate and tremors 
were observed. Plasma exposures (AUC) in rabbits were below those in humans at the maximum 
recommended therapeutic dose of Fintepla. 
In a pre- and post-natal study in rats, maternal toxicity was associated with an increase in stillbirths at 
the high dose. No adverse effects on the F0 and F1 generations were confirmed at five-fold higher 
plasma exposures (AUC) than in humans at the maximum recommended therapeutic dose of Fintepla. 
In the first generation of offspring, there were no effects on overall reproductive function.  
Fenfluramine did not affect the reproductive performance of male rats. In female rats, a reduction in 
the fertility index (defined by the proportion of matings that resulted in pregnancies) was observed at 
maternally toxic doses that correlated with less corpora lutea, significantly fewer implantation sites 
and a higher percentage of pre- and post-implantation losses. No effects on the fertility index were 
noticed at plasma exposures (AUC) approximately equivalent to those in humans at the maximum 
recommended therapeutic dose of Fintepla.

D.  CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND 
EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
• 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance 
activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the 
marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. 
• 
Additional risk minimisation measures  
Prior to launch of Fintepla in each Member State (MS), the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) 
must agree about the content and format of the educational materials (EM) and the controlled access 
programme (CAP) including communication media, distribution modalities and any other aspects of 
the programme, with the National Competent Authorities (NCA).  
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH shall ensure that, in each MS where Fintepla is marketed, a CAP is implemented to prevent 
off-label use for weight management in obese patients, since the benefit-risk ratio in this population is 
known to be negative.  
In addition, the CAP shall be implemented to confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed 
of the need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking Fintepla due to the potential risk of 
valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.  
The MAH shall ensure that in each MS where Fintepla is marketed, all healthcare professionals who 
are expected to prescribe the product are aware of the CAP and are provided with the educational 
package consisting of: 
•  Summary of product characteristics (SmPC)

•  Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) 
•  Off-label use for weight management 
The HCP guide shall contain the following key messages:  
➢  Brief information about the historical background on fenfluramine and its market withdrawal 
due to the risks of VHD and PAH. 
➢  Emphasis that the currently approved indication has to be strictly adhered to and access is 
therefore controlled ensuring proper information of physicians before prescribing. 
➢  Informing physicians about the conditions of the Fintepla Controlled Access Programme (that 
are agreed on national level). 
➢  Instruction on detection, monitoring, and/or proper management of VHD and PAH associated 
with fenfluramine.  
➢  Advice to encourage patients/carers to enrol patients in the fenfluramine registry to collect 
long-term safety data. 
The educational material for patients and/or caregivers should address the following risks: 
•  Valvular heart disease (VHD) 
•  Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) 
The patient/carer guide shall contain the following key messages: 
➢  Information about the importance of periodic cardiac monitoring (ECHOs) 
➢  Education about the detection and proper management of VHD and PAH associated with 
fenfluramine.  
27 
 
 
 
➢  Encouragement to participate in the fenfluramine registry to collect long-term safety data. 
• 
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures  
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
Fintepla Registry on long-term safety 
The MAH shall perform an observational registry to provide data on long-term

Fintepla contains the active substance fenfluramine.  
Fintepla is used to treat seizures (fits) in patients aged 2 years and over who have either a type of 
epilepsy called Dravet syndrome or one called Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. It can help to reduce the 
number and severity of seizures. 
It is not completely known how Fintepla works. However, it is thought to work by increasing the 
activity in the brain of a natural substance called serotonin and the sigma 1 receptor, and this may 
reduce seizures. 
2.  What you need to know before you or your child takes Fintepla 
Do not take Fintepla if:  
• 
you or your child are allergic to fenfluramine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6) 
you or your child have a heart problem such as ‘valve disease’ or ‘pulmonary arterial 
hypertension’ (high pressure in the arteries of the lungs)  
you or your child have taken medicines called monoamine oxidase inhibitors in the last 
2 weeks. 
• 
• 
Do not take Fintepla if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse before taking Fintepla. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Fintepla if: 
• 
you or your child have glaucoma 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
you or your child have had thoughts about harming or killing yourself 
you or your child are taking a medicine called cyproheptadine, which is used to treat allergies or 
to improve appetite. 
If any of the above applies to you or your child (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse before taking Fintepla. 
Tests and checks 
Before you or your child start taking Fintepla your doctor must check the heart with an 
echocardiogram (ECHO). The doctor will check that the valves in the heart work properly and the 
pressure in the artery between the heart and lungs is not too high. Once you or your child has started 
taking Fintepla, you will have an echocardiogram check every 6 months for the first 2 years and then 
once a year. If Fintepla treatment is stopped, you or your child will need to have an echocardiogram 
6 months after the last dose. 
Your doctor should also check your weight before and during your treatment as Fintepla can cause you 
to lose weight. 
‘Serotonin syndrome’ 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Fintepla if you or your child are taking medicines which 
can increase the levels of serotonin in your brain. This is because taking these medicines and Fintepla 
can cause serotonin syndrome, which is a life-threatening condition. Medicines that can increase 
serotonin levels include: 
• 
• 
• 
‘triptans’ (such as sumatriptan) – used for migraine 
MAOI medicines – used for depression 
SSRI or SNRI medicines – used for depression and anxiety. 
Look out for the signs of serotonin syndrome which include: 
•  being agitated, seeing things which are not there (hallucinations) or passing out 
•  heart and circulation problems such as fast heartbeat, blood pressure going up and down, high 
body temperature, sweating 
twitching muscles and being uncoordinated 
feeling or being sick and diarrhoea. 
• 
• 
Tell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the serious side effects above. 
Other medicines and Fintepla 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken, or might take any 
other medicines. This is because Fintepla can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some 
other medicines can affect the way Fintepla works.  
Fintepla can make you or your child feel sleepy. You or your child may be even more sleepy if you 
take other medicines such as anti-depressants or alcohol at the same time as Fintepla. 
In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken, or 
might take: 
• 
• 
• 
stiripentol, a medicine for epilepsy, as your dose of Fintepla may need to be reduced 
‘triptans’, MAOI, SNRI or SSRI medicines – see above under ‘Serotonin syndrome’ 
carbamazepine, primidone, rifampicin, phenobarbital and other barbiturates, phenytoin, and 
efavirenz, as your dose of Fintepla may need to be increased. 
Also speak with your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child smoke as the dose of Fintepla may 
need to be increased.

baby or are breast-feeding, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  
Driving and using machines 
Talk to your doctor about driving, using machines, or if you or your child undertake activities such as 
cycling or other sports, because you or your child may feel sleepy after taking this medicine. 
Fintepla contains sodium ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate (E 215) and sodium methyl p-
hydroxybenzoate (E 219)  
This may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). 
Fintepla contains sulfur dioxide (E 220)  
This may rarely cause hypersensitivity reactions and bronchospasm.

This may be harmful to the teeth. 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicinal product.

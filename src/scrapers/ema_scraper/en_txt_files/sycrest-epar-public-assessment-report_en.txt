2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Asenapine  is  claimed  to  be  a  novel  psychopharmacologic  agent  with  high  affinity  and  potency  for 
blocking  dopamine,  serotonin,  α-adrenergic  and  histamine  receptors,  and  no  appreciable  activity  at 
muscarinic  cholinergic  receptors.  The  mechanism  of  action  of  asenapine,  like  other  atypical 
antipsychotics is believed to be mediated through a combination of antagonist activity at 5-HT2A and 
D2 receptors.  
The  following  indications  were  initially  applied  for:  treatment  of  schizophrenia,  treatment  of  manic 
episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.  
In adults, the recommended dose can range from 5 mg to 10 mg twice daily. 
Sycrest  (asenapine)  is  a  fast  dissolving  tablet  for  sublingual  administration  containing    asenapine  in 
the form of maleate salt as active substance. The product contains 5mg or 10mg asenapine in gelatin 
and mannitol.  
Schizophrenia  is  a  severe,  disabling  disorder  that  affects  about  1%  of  the  world’s  population. 
According  to  DSM-IV-TR,  the  diagnosis  of  schizophrenia  requires  the  presence  of  at  least  two  of  the 
following symptoms over a period of at least one month: delusion, hallucinations, disorganised speech, 
catatonic  or  grossly  disorganised  behaviour,  negative  symptoms.  Furthermore,  additional  unspecific 
symptoms  (often  termed  prodromal  or  residual  symptoms)  are  required  to  be  present  for  at  least  6 
months.    In  addition,  the  clinical  symptoms  are  required  to  be  associated  with  a  significant 
social/occupational  dysfunction,  often  in  the  sense  of  a  decline  in  performance.    In  a  majority  of 
individuals,  schizophrenia  is  a  chronic  disorder  in  the  sense  that  individuals  experience  disabling 
symptoms  over  long  periods  of  time  after  initial  onset,  which  typically  occurs  in  early  adulthood. 
Complete  remission  is  probably  not  common  in  this  disorder.      In  addition  to  the  positive  symptoms 
(such as delusions and hallucinations) and negative symptoms (such as alogia, affective flattening or 
avolition), which are listed as diagnostic criteria in DSM-IV-TR, many patients also experience various 
cognitive  deficits  as  well  as  symptoms  of  depression  and  anxiety.  Moreover,  schizophrenia  is  a 
disorder associated with a high risk of suicidality, with a frequently reported modal rate of suicide rate 
being  approximately  10%.  Classical  antipsychotic  drugs  typically  show  efficacy  in  the  treatment  of 
positive  symptoms  but  not  in  all  patients.  They  are  generally  less  effective  in  the  treatment  of 
negative symptoms and tend to cause troubling extrapyramidal motor symptoms, which often strongly 
limit their acceptance among patients. Atypical antipsychotics are associated with a lower frequency of 
this  important  side  effect  but  they  cause  other  adverse  effects  that  limit  their  use  in  some  patient 
populations, such as elevated prolactin levels, agranulocytosis, cardiac side effects or excessive weight 
gain. There are therefore still substantial unmet needs in the treatment of schizophrenia.  
Bipolar disorder is a chronic, typically cyclic mood disorder with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 
0.8%  to  1.6%  (DSM-IV-TR).  The  disorder  is  characterized  by  the  occurrence  of  episodes  of 
significantly  altered  mood,  which  may  be  manic,  depressive  (meeting  criteria  for  major  depressive 
episode),  or  mixed.  Bipolar  I  disorder  is  characterized  by  the  occurrence  of  at  least  one  manic  or 
mixed  episode  according  to  the  criteria  of  DSM-IV-TR.  The  duration  of  a  manic  episode  can  extend 
from  days  to  months.  Typical  symptoms  of  a  manic  episode  include  abnormally  and  persistently 
elevated or irritable mood accompanied by inflated self-esteem, ideas of grandiosity, decreased need 
for sleep, increased drive, logorrhoea, or flight of ideas. Manic patients are at increased risk to engage 
in  unrestrained  buying  sprees,  sexual  indiscretions  or  foolish  business  investments.  Patients  with

mixed episodes experience rapidly alternating moods meeting the criteria for both a manic and major 
depressive  episode  over  a  prolonged  period  of  time  of  at  least  one  week.  Individuals  with  bipolar  I 
disorder  have  a  substantially  elevated  risk  of  suicidality,  with  10-15%  of  affected  individuals  finally 
committing suicide (DSM-IV-TR). Treatment of bipolar I disorders comprises an effective treatment of 
manic or mixed symptoms as well as treatment of bipolar depression, which differs substantially from 
the  treatment  of  unipolar  depression  due  to  the  increased  risk  of  a  switch  into  mania.  Moreover,  an 
important long term goal is mood stabilization, ideally in the state of euthymia. For the treatment of 
manic  symptoms,  a  variety  of  drug  treatment  options  have  been  used  in  the  past  decades.  Lithium 
and  antiepileptic  drugs  such  as  valproate  or  carbamazepine  have  demonstrated  antimanic  effects. 
Typical antipsychotics have frequently been used to control manic symptoms; their use however, was 
often limited by the occurrence of EPS. More recently, atypical antipsychotics have increasingly been 
used successfully and approved to treat manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Sycrest  contains  asenapine  in  the  form  of  maleate  salt  as  active  substance.  The  drug  product 
formulation is a fast dissolving tablet for sublingual administration .The bioavailability after sublingual 
dosing is much higher (approximately 35%) than after oral dosing (<2% in tablet formulation). The 
product contains 5mg or 10mg asenapine in gelatin and mannitol and is administered twice daily. 
Sycrest 5 mg and 10 mg tablets are presented as white to-off-white circular tablets, with ‘5’ and ‘10’, 
respectively, embossed on one side. The different tablet strengths are distinguishable from each other 
by the tablet markings, which is acceptable given the nature of the product. 
The  product  is  packaged  in  peelable  cold  form  aluminium/aluminium  blisters  in  cartons  of  20,  60  or 
100 sublingual tablets per carton. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
The  chemical  name  of  the  active  substance  is  (3aR,12bR)-rel-5-chloro-2,3,3a,12b-tetrahydro-2-
methyl-1H-dibenz[2,3:6,7]oxepino[4,5-c]pyrrole-(2Z)-2-butenedioate (1:1). The molecular formula of 
active substance is C17H16ClNO.C4H4O4 , its relative molecular mass 401.84 and its structural formula is 
shown below. 
Asenapine maleate is a white to off-white non hygroscopic powder,  slightly soluble in water, sparingly 
soluble in 0.1 M HCl. Two polymorphic forms have been found. One of them is the more stable form at 
ambient  temperature  and  is  the  desired  one.  Asenapine  maleate  contains  two  chiral  centres  at  C3a 
and C12b and is a racemate (R,R and S,S). The pH of a saturated asenapine solution in water is 4.2 at 
23.5  oC,  its  pKa  is  8.6  (protonated  free  base)  and  its  logP  is  4.9  (neutral  species)  and  1.4  (cationic 
species).

2.2.2.1. 
 Manufacture 
The  manufacturing  process  of  asenapine  maleate  comprises  three  steps  that  yield  the  desired 
polymorph.  If  required,  reprocessing  is  foreseen  in  accordance  with  defined  criteria  and  in  line  with 
ICH Q7. 
The  process  parameters  for  all  steps  including  the  purification  step  of  the  manufacturing  process  for 
asenapine  maleate  are  not  considered  to  be  critical  and  are  easily  controlled  within  the  proven 
acceptable ranges (PAR). The PARs were sufficiently established. 
2.2.2.2. 
 Specification 
The  drug  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance  (visual),  identification  (IR,  HPLC), 
polymorphic  form  (X-RPD),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  heavy  metals 
(ICP-AE), sulphated ash (Ph Eur ), and particle size distribution (LDS). 
Results  from  31  development  batches  and  26  post  development  batches  of  asenapine  maleate  were 
presented.  The  most  recent  4  batches  were  manufactured  wholly  in  accordance  with  the  current 
manufacturing  process  at  the  current  manufacturing  site.  Full  compliance  with  the  current  proposed 
specification is confirmed for these batches. In addition the results of all other batches are acceptable 
and consistent with respect to the analytical parameters tested. No significant variations between the 
individual asenapine maleate batches manufactured via the commercial process have been observed.  
2.2.2.3. 
 Stability 
Four batches of active substance, manufactured according to the proposed commercial manufacturing 
process,  have  been  entered  into  long-term  (25  oC/60%  RH),  intermediate  (30 oC/65%  RH)  and 
accelerated (30 oC/75% RH) stability studies, in accordance with ICH conditions. Samples were stored 
in  packaging  representative  of  that  proposed  for  long-term  storage.  36  months  of  long-term  and 
intermediate data, and results from completed (6 months) accelerated studies are presented. Samples 
were observed to meet the proposed specification throughout the studies, under all storage conditions 
A  photostability  study  was  conducted  on  one  batch  according  to  ICH  Q1B  guideline.  After  light 
exposure assay, colour, water content, polymorphic form and particle size show no change. Analysis of 
samples  indicates  the  formation  of  a  small  amount  of  degradation.  As  this  degradation  was  not 
observed in long term studies and the container closure system provides some protection from light, 
no protection from light other than storage in the container closure system is proposed. 
Forced  degradation  studies  to  asenapine  maleate  powder  and  solutions  using  active  substance  from 
one batch were performed. The results of the studies support the possible degradation pathway. 
In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 1 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMEA. 
In conclusion the proposed retest period and storage conditions are acceptable. 
2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
2.2.3.1. 
 Pharmaceutical Development 
Initial  development  examined  a  conventional  oral  solid  dosage  form,  however,  low  bioavailability 
(<2%) caused by extensive first-pass metabolism dictated that another route be adopted, and it was

decided  to  follow  the  sublingual  route.  The  experience  of  the  finished  product  manufacturer  was 
utilised in the development of sublingual tablets, through a freeze-dried matrix of gelatin and mannitol. 
The  suitability  of  methods  used  to  monitor  tablet  disintegration  and  dissolution  has  been  thoroughly 
investigated during development. 
All  clinical  batches  were  demonstrated  to  meet  the  disintegration  specification  and  showed  similar 
dissolution profiles. 
Asenapine  maleate  salt  was  selected  for  use  in  Sycrest  drug  product  due  to  good  chemical  stability, 
sufficiently  high  melting  point,  good  purifying  effect  upon  crystallization,  and  acceptable  solubility  in 
water. 
Asenapine maleate drug substance is not readily susceptible to heat, pH, light, or oxidative agents. 
One  of  the  two  identified  polymorphic  forms  is  the  desired  form  for  use  in  the  product,  due  to  its 
better stability at ambient temperatures. The polymorphic form is controlled in the active substance. 
Tablets formulated with the other form were demonstrated not to be bioequivalent to those prepared 
with the desired form (study 041009). Development work showed that the dissolved drug substance is 
quickly  frozen  and  lyophilized,  allowing  for  amorphous  asenapine  to  be  present  in  the  final  drug 
product. The drug substance that does not dissolve in the matrix remains crystalline in the final drug 
product. 
Widely  used,  pharmacopoeial  excipients  are  employed.  The  use  of  gelatin  and  mannitol  in  the 
formulation  of  products  of  the  same  technology  is  well-established.  Compatibility  between  the  active 
substance  and  the  excipients  has  been  demonstrated  adequately.  Bioequivalence  between  batches 
manufactured with gelatin from different sources was demonstrated (study A7501015). 
The  different  tablet  strengths  are  distinguishable  from  each  other  by  the  tablet  markings,  which  is 
acceptable given the nature of the product. 
Optimisation of manufacture was performed with development batches of various batch sizes including 
the commercial batch size. 
Extensive  investigation  into  the  development  of  the  manufacturing  process  is  reported,  with  a  full 
consideration  of  critical  manufacturing  parameters  and  justification  of  the  established  target 
parameters and acceptable ranges. 
While  many  aspects  of  the  manufacturing  process  are  common  to  all  products  employing  the  same 
freeze-dried  matrix  technology,  and  other  parameters  are  defined  during  qualification  of  the 
equipment concerned, a number of parameters/conditions require specific evaluation and optimisation. 
Satisfactory  justification  for  the  process  parameters  adopted  for  commercial  scale  manufacture  has 
been provided. 
The selection of the packaging type is based on the experience of the finished product  manufacturer 
and  the  requirements  relating  to  the  production  process  and  protective  properties  for  the  finished 
product.  The  cold-form  aluminium  blister  packs  provide  adequate  protection  from  moisture.  The 
suitability of the proposed packaging is confirmed by stability studies, see IV.8, below. 
‘Sycrest’ 5 mg & 10 mg tablets are presented as white to-off-white circular tablets, with ‘5’ and ‘10’, 
respectively, embossed on one side. 
The development of the formulation, based on the finished product manufacturer’s proprietary ‘Zydis’ 
technology,  in  which  the  active  substance  is  mixed  in  a  solution  of  gelatin  and  mannitol,  and 
subsequently  dispensed  by  weight  into  blister  pockets  before  freeze-drying  and  blister  sealing,  is 
described  in  detail.  Relevant  properties  of  the  active  substance  have  been  considered  and  critical 
manufacturing parameters investigated and defined 
The  manufacturing  process  is  adequately  described,  with  appropriate  controls  in  place.  The 
manufacturing process may be considered as a ‘standard process’ on the basis of the manufacturer’s 
prior experience. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583011/2010

Analytical methodology has been validated adequately. 
2.2.3.2. 
 Adventitious agents 
Gelatin used in Sycrest is of animal origin. The supplier has been issued with Ph Eur Certificates of 
Suitability by the EDQM, in relation to compliance with TSE requirements.  
2.2.3.3. 
 Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process comprising: mixing 
of asenapine maleate into an aqueous solution of gelatin and mannitol and dosed by volume into cold-
formed aluminum blister pockets, freezing the suspension within the pockets subsequently drying by 
subliming  the  ice  in  a  freeze  dryer;  the  dried  product  in  the  blister  pockets  is  then  sealed  by 
application of a lidding foil. 
The  manufacturing  process  development  work  identified  the  critical  steps  in  the  manufacture. 
Discussion  of  each  of  these  steps,  and  the  controls  in  place  to  ensure  conditions  are  fulfilled  is 
provided. 
The  manufacturing  process  of  Sycrest  tablets  is  such  that  the  tablets  are  produced  in  their  primary 
packaging.  Since  tablets  are  formed  in  situ  in  the  blisters,  robustness  during  manufacture  is  not 
required, as no mechanical handling of the tablets occurs during production. For this reason, handling 
of  bulk  tablets  will  not  occur,  making  tablet  strength  irrelevant  as  an  in-process  control,  hence  the 
specification for appearance may be considered as sufficient and representative of a suitable degree of 
handling.  
2.2.3.4. 
 Product specification 
The release and shelf-life specifications of the finished product include tests and limits for appearance 
(visual), identification (HPLC-diode array), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units 
(Ph Eur, only at release), disintegration time (Ph Eur) and water content (Ph Eur).  
Release testing of Sycrest includes a test for appearance. The tablets have to be removed intact from 
the  blister  in  order  to  meet  the  requirements  for  appearance.  This  removal  is  representative  for  the 
handling of the tablets by patients.  
It  is  also  considered  that  sufficient  evidence  has  been  provided  to  demonstrate  that  testing  for 
microbiological  quality  may  be  excluded  from  the  finished  product  specification.  Batch  analytical 
results were presented for a number of development batches up to commercial scale of each strength. 
Full  compliance  with  the  proposed  specification  is  demonstrated.  Only  one  impurity  was  detected 
above the reporting threshold in some batches of the 5 mg strength. This impurity however is stated 
to  be  a  major  metabolite  of  the  active  substance  and,  hence,  may  be  regarded  as  fully  qualified 
toxicologically. 
2.2.3.5. 
 Stability of the product 
Stability  studies  have  been  performed  on  three  pilot  scale  batches  of  each  strength  with  samples 
stored  in  the  proposed  commercial  packaging  at  ICH  recommended  long-term  (25  °C/60%  RH), 
accelerated  conditions  (40  °C/75%  RH),  and  in  addition  under  intermediate  conditions  at  elevated 
humidity  (30  °C/75%  RH),  under  refrigeration  (5  °C/ambient  RH)  and  at  elevated  temperature 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583011/2010  
Page 9/88
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(50 °C/ambient  RH).  Samples  were  tested  with  regard  to  appearance,  disintegration,  water  content, 
assay  and  degradation  products  in  accordance  with  the  specification  and  also  for  microbiological 
quality, dissolution performance, polymorphic characterisation and tablet diameter.  
Data are presented for completed studies for up to 36 months at 25 °C/60% RH, 30 °C/75% RH and 
5 °C/ambient RH, up to six months at 40 °C/75% RH an dup to three months at 50 °C/ambient RH. 
No  significant  deterioration  in  product  quality  was  recorded  in  the  stability  studies  under  any  of  the 
conditions  tested.  Appearance  and  disintegration  time  remained  unchanged  throughout.  Increases  in 
water  content  were  detected  with  time.  However,  the  observed  increase  in  water  content  of  the 
tablets  was  shown  not  to  have  any  noticeable  effect  on  tablet  appearance  or  disintegration 
performance and can, therefore, be considered as non-critical to tablet quality. 
The  individual  graphical  representations  of  the  assay  results  for  each  batch,  with  regression  analysis 
extrapolating to 5 years, predict continued compliance with the proposed assay specification limits.  
Increases in levels of degradation products are apparent with time; these are more marked for the 5 
mg  strength.  Similar  degradant  levels  were  observed  under  both  long-term  and  intermediate 
conditions.  The  individual  graphical  representations  of  the  impurities  results  for  each  batch,  with 
regression analysis extrapolating to 5 years, predict continued compliance with the proposed impurity 
specification  limits  for  each  of  the  specified  impurities  and  for  total  impurities.  No  changes  in 
microbiological  quality,  dissolution  or  tablet  diameter  were  apparent  throughout  studies  under  any 
conditions. No change in polymorphic form was observed. 
Photostability 
A  single  pilot  scale  batch  of  each  strength  was  entered  into  a  photostability  study  under  light 
conditions in accordance with ICH recommendations.  
Samples  were  tested  in  accordance  with  the  proposed  specification  with  regard  to  appearance, 
disintegration,  water  content,  assay  and  degradation  products  and  also  for  tablet  diameter  and 
dissolution performance. Increases in the levels of one impurity were recorded for the directly exposed 
tablets,  which  suggest  a  degree  of  sensitivity  of  the  product  to  light.  No  significant  changes  were 
observed for any of the parameters studied for the unopened blister samples; it is concluded that the 
primary packaging provides adequate protection from light. 
Based upon the stability data provided, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions are considered 
acceptable.  
In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMEA. 
2.2.4.  Discussion and Conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects 
The  quality  of  Sycrest  sublingual  tablet  is  adequately  established.  Information  on  development, 
manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The 
quality of the active substance is considered sufficiently described and adequately supported by data. 
Sufficient  chemical  and  pharmaceutical  documentation  relating  to  development,  manufacture  and 
control  of  the  drug  product  has  been  presented.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH  guidelines  conditions  is  chemically  stable  for  the 
proposed shelf life.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
Pivotal toxicology studies were performed according to Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), as stated by 
the applicant. 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Asenapine, and its known/putative metabolites and enantiomers have been evaluated in a series of in 
vitro  and  in  vivo  pharmacological  tests  used  for  characterization  of  antipsychotic  agents.  Studies 
included  in  vitro  (receptor  binding  and  function)  and  in  vivo  (regional  neuronal  activation, 
neurotransmitter efflux, receptor regulation and behavioural analysis).   
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
2.3.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The binding profile of asenapine has revealed high affinity for a range of human serotonin, dopamine, 
noradrenaline and histamine receptor subtypes. In particular, asenapine had subnanomolar affinity for 
several  human  5-HT  receptor  subtypes  (pKi):  5-HT2C  (10.5),  5-HT2A  (10.2),  5-HT7  (9.9),  5-HT2B 
(9.8), and 5-HT6 (9.6). Subnanomolar affinity was also observed for (pKi): α2B-adrenergic (9.5) and 
dopamine  D3  (9.4)  receptors.  Asenapine  had  an  appreciable  affinity  for  histamine  H2  receptors  (pKi: 
8.2) but not for muscarinic receptors. 
Following  autoradiographic  analysis,  1nM  [3H]-asenapine  demonstrated  varying  degrees  of  specific 
binding  in  the  majority  of  coronal  sections  throughout  the  rostro-caudal  extent  of  the  rat  brain, 
especially in the cortex and choroid plexus associated with high serotonin receptor density. 
Asenapine  acts  as  an  antagonist  at  serotonin,  dopamine,  noradrenaline  and  histamine  receptors.  It 
potently blocked agonist- induced activation of the following studied receptors (pKB): 5-HT2A (9.1), 5-
HT2B (9.9), 5-HT2C (9.0), 5-HT1A (7.4), 5-HT1B (8.1), 5-HT6 (8.0), 5-HT7 (8.5), D2 (9.1), D3 (9.1), 
α2A (7.3), α2B (8.3), α2C (6.8) and H1 (8.4). This profile is different than other atypical antipsychotics 
which did not show appreciable antagonism at 5-HT6 and α2-adrenergic receptors (PKB<5). 
Asenapine potentiated NMDA receptor in isolated rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPC) slice preparation, 
evoking  electrophysiological  responses  in  mPFC  pyramidal  cells.  However  the  magnitude  of 
potentiation  was  reduced  at  higher  concentrations  (7.5,  10,  and  100nM)  and  no  appreciable  binding 
affinity for NMDA receptors has been shown. 
Asenapine  occupied  serotonin,  dopamine,  noradrenaline  and  histamine    receptors  studied  in  different 
regions  of  rat  brain  with  a  distinct  rank  of  order  of  potency  (ED50,  mg/kg,  subcutaneous):  5-  HT2A 
(0.005)>  5-HT2C  (0.02)>  α1  (0.077),  D2  (0.1),  H1  (0.11),  α2  (0.13),  >D3  (1.1),  D1  (1.3)>5-HT1A 
(6.5). 
Following  studies  in  rat  striatum  and  cortex  using  the  irreversible  antagonist  Nethoxycarbonyl-  2-
ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline,  asenapine  (0.25  mg/kg,  intraperitoneal=i.p)  preferentially  occupied  5-
HT2 receptors (84%) as compared to D1 (7%) or D2 (44%). Asenapine (0.1 mg/kg) showed time and 
exposure related increase in D2 receptor occupancy.  Plasma levels of 0.48 ng/ml and 1.24 ng/ml were 
necessary  for  50%  receptor  occupancy  of  the  5-HT2A  (ED50:  0.011  mg/kg)  and  D2  (ED50:  0.016 
mg/kg. The range for plasma levels to achieve 60 – 80% D2 receptor occupancy, was 1-3 ng/ml.

Following  acute  intravenous  administration  of  asenapine  (0.001-1  mg/kg)  to  anaesthetised  rats  at 
central  5-HT2A,  5-HT1A,  α2-adrenergic  and  D2  receptors  mediated  effects  on  monoamine  neurone 
firing activity. Asenapine blocked the inhibitory effects of the 5-HT2A (ED50: 0.075 mg/kg) and the α2 
adrenergic  receptor  activation  (ED50:  0.085  mg/kg)  on  the  noradrenergic  locus  coeruleus  neurone 
firing.  Dopaminergic  neurone  activity  in  ventral  tegmental  area  was  blocked  by  asenapine 
(ED50  :0.040  mg/kg).  Asenapine  did  not  show  any  evidence  of  5-HT1A  receptor  blocking  activity  on 
dorsal  raphe  serotonergic  neurone  firing.  However,  local  microionotophoretic  application  of  asenapine 
in the dorsal raphe or CA3 neurones of the hippocampus revealed partial agonist activity at the 5-HT1A 
receptor. 
Following  subcutaneous  (s.c)  repeated  dose  administration  of  asenapine  (28  days,  twice  daily=BID, 
injection) in rat, dose-dependent and regionally specific effects on serotonin, dopamine and ionotropic 
glutamate receptor subtypes were observed. D2 receptor binding density in mPFC, nucleus accumbens, 
hippocampus at 0.03 and 0.1mg/kg were increased  while the same effect was only observed at higher 
dose  (0.3  mg/kg)  in  the  caudated  putamen  region.  D1  and  D4  receptor  binding  density  was  also 
increased  at  0.1  and  0.3  mg/kg  but  no  effect  on  D3  receptor  binding  density  was  observed  in  any 
region of the brain investigated. At all doses, 5-HTA2A receptor binding density were decreased in the 
mPFC  and  dorsolateral  cerebral  cortex.  Increased  5-HTA1  receptor  binding  density  was  observed  in 
mPFC,  dorsolateral  cerebral  cortex  and  hippocampus  at  0.1  and  0.3  mg/kg  but  no  effect  on  5-HT2C 
receptor binding density was observed in any region of the brain investigated. At all doses, asenapine 
produced  regionally  selective increases  in α1  and  α2    adrenoceptor  binding  density in  the    mPFC  and 
dorsolateral  frontal  cortex.  In  relation  to  effects  on  ionotropic  glutamate  receptor  binding  density, 
asenapine  significantly  decreased  NMDA/MK-801  modulatory  site  receptor  binding  in  the  nucleus 
accumbens  and caudate putamen at all doses and the AMPA receptor binding in the hippocampus at 
0.3 mg/kg. 
Following  autoradiographic  analysis  using  [33P]-labelled  probes  specific  for  c-fos  mRNA  ,  asenapine 
showed neuronal activation in mPFC, amygdaloid nucleus and striatum but also in the parietal cortex, 
medial hippocampal CA2 field and medial habenula. 
Asenapine  significantly  increased  dopamine  efflux  in  the  mPFC  and  hippocampus  following  acute 
administration  at  0.05,  0.1  and  0.5  mg/kg  and  in  the  nucleus  accumbens,  only  at  0.5  mg/kg.  It  also 
increased  acetycholine  efflux  in  the  mPFC  and  hippocampus  at  0.1  and  0.5  mg/kg  but  no  effect  was 
observed in nucleus accumbens. Noradrenaline release in the mand hippocampus was observed at 0.05 
and  0.1  mg/kg  but  there  was  no  increased  effect  on  serotonin  (medial  prefrontal  cortex  or 
hippocampus), glutamate (medial prefrontal cortex or nucleus accumbens) or GABA (medial prefrontal 
cortex or nucleus accumbens) levels at 0.1 mg/kg.  Subchronic administration of asenapine (0.1 mg/kg, 
14 days) also increased dopamine and acetycholine efflux in the mPFC and hippocampus. 
Asenapine inhibited the behavioral effects (head shakes, penile erections, forepaw treading) of various 
serotonergic ligands in rats (ED50: in mg/kg, s.c.) by blocking the following receptors: 5-HT2A (0.001), 
5-HT2C (0.02) and 5-HT1A (0.08). It also antagonised apomorphine-induced climbing in mice (0.02 - 
0.04) and D2, D1 receptor agonists – induced circling behaviour in rats. 
Asenapine  (0.05,  0.1,  0.2  mg/kg,  s.c.)  also  produced  a  dose-  related  suppression  of  conditioned 
avoidance response in rats with an ED50 of 0.12 mg/kg. Only 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg doses of asenapine 
produced significant inhibition at 20 and 90 minutes post treatment. The dose required for about 80% 
inhibition  was  between  0.1-0.2  mg/kg.  Asenapine  also  showed  preferential  inhibition  of  locomotor 
activity  in  stimulated  by  low  doses  of  amphetamine  (1mg/kg,  s.c)  compared  to  high  doses  of 
amphetamine  (3  mg/kg,  s.c  )  with  minimum  effective  doses  (MEDs)  of  0.03  and  0.1  mg/kg

respectively.  Asenapine  reversed  apomorphine-induced  disruption  of  prepubile  inhibition  with  MED  of 
0.03  mg/kg,  s.c.  Effects  on  spontaneous  locomotor  activity  in  mice  were  seen  at  relatively  higher 
doses (0.3-0.4 mg/kg, s.c) with asenapine (ED50: 0.4 mg/ kg,  s.c). 
Following  s.c  administration  in  mice  and/or  rat  models,  asenapine  has  not  shown  antidepressant-like 
activity at dose of 0.025 - 0.1 mg/kg nor anxiolytic like activity at 0.001 - 0.3 mg/kg. 
Following  sc  administration  of  asenapine  in  rats  model,  the  deficit  in  cognitive  behavioural  flexibility 
was  attenuated  at  0.075  mg/kg,  while  no  effect  was  observed  at  lower  doses.  Asenapine  also 
attenuated  the  D-amphetamine  induced  deficit  in  cued  reversal  learning  task  at  the  same  dose.  The 
procognitive effects of asenapine at different tested doses, in treated phencyclidine rats and monkeys 
models were maintained after repeated administration.   
Following  i.p  repeated  administration  of  asenapine  (0.06,  0.2,  0.6  mg/kg,  BID)  in  rats  ahnedonia 
model, chronic mild stress was reduced. However a decrease in sensitivity to the rewarding effects of 
electrical stimulation of ventral tegmental area in rats was observed at 0.1 mg/kg. 
Individual  enantiomers  of  asenapine  have  shown  similar  human  receptor  binding  properties  to 
asenapine (50:50 mixture) and potency for blocking 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT1A, D2, D1 receptor ligands 
mediated  behavioural  responses  in  mice  and  rats.  However,  metabolites  have  shown  lower  receptor 
binding properties compared to asenapine. A lower potency than asenapine was also observed in some 
metabolites  (N-glucuronideasenapine  and  N-desmethyl-asenapine).  The  11-O-sulphated-asenapine 
metabolite has shown inability to cross the blood brain barrier. 
2.3.2.2. 
 Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No studies described specifically as secondary pharmacodynamic have been performed with asenapine. 
Available  supportive  data  are  derived  from  primary  pharmacodynamics  studies  and  these  were 
considered sufficient to characterise the pharmacodynamic profile of asenapine. 
2.3.2.3. 
 Safety pharmacology program 
CNS system 
Following  single  intramuscular  (i.m)  administration  of  asenapine  in  monkeys  previously  sensitised  to 
neuroleptics,  locomotor  activity  dose-dependently  decreased  from  0.025  mg/kg  onwards.  Asenapine 
produced  moderate  syndromes  of  dystonia  and  bradykinesia  that  were  dose-dependent  from  0.025 
mg/kg  onwards.  Decreased  reactivity  to  environmental  stimuli  was  not  present  until  dystonia  and 
bradykinesia  were  observed.  There  were  mild  slow  tongue  protrusions  at  baseline  that  decreased  in 
frequency by about 50% at highest doses. Asenapine produced mild chewing mouth movements. There 
were no effects on lip movements or stereotyped behavior. and no effects on eye blinking, sedation or 
arousal were observed with asenapine.  
Cardiovascular system 
The  main  haemodynamic  effects  of  intravenous  asenapine  were  a  decrease  in  arterial  blood  pressure 
and  orthostatic  hypotension  in  several  species.  In  these  in  vivo  studies,  asenapine  also  displayed 
marked  anti-histaminergic  properties  while  no  effects  on  cholinergic  or  β-adrenergic  systems  were 
observed.  
In  conscious  dog,  orally  administered  asenapine  induced  dose-dependent  negative  inotropic  and 
positive  chronotropic  effects  accompanied  by  ECG  changes  (QTc  interval  prolongation),  orthostatic 
CHMP assessment report

hypotension  on  tilt  with  marked  tachycardia.  Sublingually  administered  asenapine  had  fewer  side-
effects  even  at  doses  yielding  similar  asenapine  plasma  levels.  The  effects  after  sublingual 
administration were dose-dependent tachycardia in the absence of negative inotropy and hypotension. 
Furthermore,  after  passive  tilt,  modest  orthostatic  hypotension  was  observed  accompanied  by  an 
augmented orthostatic rise in heart rate. Sublingual administration of the two asenapine enantiomers 
[the  (S)-enantiomer  and  the  (R)-enantiomer]  showed  the  same  cardiovascular  profile  as  racemic 
asenapine. 
Asenapine  has  shown  to  have  a  greater  potential  to  modify  arterial  blood  pressure  and  heart  rate 
whilst  the  metabolite  (N-desmethylasenapine)  may  possess  more  negative  inotropic  activity  in  dogs. 
Asenapine appeared to block α1 adrenoceptors whilst the metabolite was at least 10 times less potent 
than asenapine in dogs and rats.  
Asenapine  and  N-desmethyl  asenapine  have  produced  a  concentration-dependent  inhibition  of  hERG 
current  (IC50  =  0.3  and  0.7  µM;  IC20  =  42  nM  and  0.2  µM)  in  transfected  HEK293  cells.  A  lower 
activity  of  N+-glucuronide  asenapine  on  hERG  current  inhibition  has  been  observed  (IC50  =  9.3  µM; 
IC20 = 2.3 µM). A decrease in action potential duration was induced by asenapine in canine Purkinje 
fibers.  This  effect  was  dose-dependent  and  more  pronounced  under  low  stimulation  rates  (0.33  Hz) 
than  under  normal  stimulation  rates  (1Hz).  It  was  also  associated  with  a  decrease  in  the  plateau  of 
action potential involving mainly calcium channel current. QTc interval data from the above mentioned 
study  in  conscious  dogs  revealed  that  the  QTcF  (Fridericia’s  correction)  and QTcVdW  (van  de  Water’s 
correction prolongation) was minimal (approximately 15 msec higher than controls at low dose) after 
oral  administration  and  the  increases  did  not  appear  to  be  dose-dependent.  After  sublingual 
administration,  no  statistically  significant  prolongation  of  the  QTcF  and  QTcVdW  intervals  relative  to 
controls was observed.  
Respiratory system 
Asenapine  induced  a  transient  central  respiratory  depressive  effect  (increase  in  tidal  volume,  expired 
volume, enhanced pause), 20 minutes after subcutaneous administration of 5mg/kg, s.c in rats.  The 
no effect level was 1.5 mg/kg with an estimated Cmax of 100 ng/ml. 
Other systems 
Asenapine  has  been  shown  a  2.5  fold  stronger  local  anaesthetic  activity  as  compared  to  lidocaine  in 
isolated toad sciatic nerve (Xenopus laevis). 
In immature rats, a slight effect of asenapine on adrenal and thyroid gland weights was observed but 
there  were  neither  mineralocorticosteroidal  activity  nor  antiestrogenic  effects.  In  immature  rabbits, 
neither a progestational activity nor anti-progrestational activity was observed. However, a significant 
increase in prolactin plasma level was induced by  asenapine after single subcutaneous administration 
in rats. 
Short-lasting effects on the intestinal system after intravenous (i.v.) administration in guinea pigs and  
acute ulcerogenic activity following single oral (p.o.) administration in rats were reported but no effect 
in gastrointestinal motility in rats was observed. 
2.3.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  were  carried  out  with  asenapine.  The  available 
supportive data were based on clinical studies and were considered sufficient to characterize the drug 
interaction profile of asenapine.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  metabolism  and  pharmacokinetics  of  asenapine  were  investigated  using  five  animal  species: 
mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog  and  monkey.  Asenapine  was  rapidly  but  highly  variably  absorbed  (tmax 
ranging from 0.4 - 1.9 h) following sublingual administration in dogs, showing a higher bioavailability 
than after oral administration. In another study in dogs, Cmax was reached within 0.05 - 0.25 h after 
dosing. The exposure to asenapine was linearly dependent upon dose, except for high oral doses. No 
apparent  sex  related  difference  in  asenapine  pharmacokinetics  was  noted  in  rats  and  dogs.  No 
pharmacokinetic differences were observed between the enantiomers in dogs and man. In mice , rats 
and rabbits higher plasma levels (up to 1.9 fold) of the (+) enantiomer were observed as compared to 
the (-) enantiomer. 
The apparent volume of distribution of asenapine following intravenous administration was larger than 
the  total  body  water  (0.7  L/kg)  in  rats  (10L/kg),  rabbits  (5-7  L/kg)  and  dogs  (7L/kg).  Tissue 
distribution of radioactivity throughout the body was noted in rats with transfer of radioactivity across 
the blood brain and placental barriers. In rabbits, transfer of radioactivity across the placental barrier 
was also noted. In rats, the tissues with the greatest uptake were the liver, kidney cortex, eye choroid 
and lacrimal gland. Extensive distribution of radioactivity in selected tissues was also observed in dogs 
(tongue, gall bladder, liver, lungs, pancreas, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, esophagus, skin and eyes). 
There was no retention in melanin containing tissues (eye, skin) of rats and dogs. CNS penetration of 
asenapine and it N-desmethyl metabolite was shown in rats and monkeys, with ready partition into the 
brain tissue. However, there was no transfer of radioactivity across the blood brain barriers of  the 11-
hydroxy-sulfate metabolite.  Asenapine and its metabolites (N-desmethyl and 11-hydroxy-sulfate) had 
relatively  reversible  high binding  to  animal  and  human  plasma  proteins  in  vitro  (>  97%)  and  did  not 
distribute  extensively  into  red  blood  cells  (20-30%).  Asenapine  and  its  N-desmethyl  metabolites 
appeared  to  be  a  weak  substrate  of  the  protein  P-glycoprotein  transporter  (P-gp),  in  transfected 
MDCK- (MDR1 gene) cells. 
In all species, metabolic pathways for asenapine initially involved N-oxidation, N-demethylation and N-
glucuronidation. N-demethylation followed by formation of the carbamoyl glucuronide or followed by N-
formylation, mono-hydroxylation followed by conjugation, di-hydroxylation followed by conjugation on 
one  or  two  of  the  hydroxy  group  were  found  in  all  species  except  in  rats.  In  plasma,  different 
metabolites  were  found  in  all  species,  predominant  metabolite  was  the  N+-glucuronide  asenapine  in 
humans  while  N  desmethyl  and/or  N-oxide  asenapine  were  predominantly  found  in  dogs,  rats  and 
rabbits and mice. In plasma, 11- Hydroxysulfate metabolite was found in rats. Repeated administration 
of asenapine resulted in an increased CYP2E1 and/or CYP1A2 (and to a lesser extent CYP1A1, CYP1A2, 
CYP2B1/CYP2B2)  activities  in  rats.  CYP2C11  and  CYP3A1  activities  were  decreased  in  male  rats.  In 
vitro studies with human hepatocytes demonstrated inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 and induction of 
CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 (only at very high concentrations above the therapeutic range). 
Asenapine related material was mainly excreted in the faeces (35-70%) with a smaller amount in the 
urine (5-11%) after sublingual dosing in dogs .Asenapine and/or its metabolite(s) were also excreted 
in the milk of rats.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
2.3.4.1. 
 Single dose toxicity 
Acute toxicity studies were performed in both rats and dogs using oral and intravenous routes. In rats, 
mortality occurred within 24 hours after oral administration (to 48 hours for some female rats). Median 
lethal dose in rats ranged from 110 to 178 mg/kg. No deaths were noted in dogs after oral dosing (up 
to 200 mg/kg) and in rats by intravenous route (up to 21 mg/kg). Both rats and dogs showed clinical 
signs  of  CNS  deterioration  (e.g  convulsions,  reduced  motor  coordination,  reduced  activity/ventral 
recumbency, stereotype behaviour). Rats had superficial erosions in the glandular stomach epithelium. 
2.3.4.2. 
 Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
Repeated dose toxicity studies were conducted using the oral route of administration in both rats and 
dogs  for  4  and  13  weeks  (dogs  only)  and  to  52  week  duration  (rats  and  dogs).  In  rats,  doses  were 
ranging from 6.5 to 75 mg/kg (13 weeks) and from 0.3- 10.8 mg/kg, (52 weeks).  In dogs, doses were 
ranging from 20 to 80 mg/kg (4 weeks) 1.25- 20 mg/kg (13 weeks) and 0.1- 3.6 mg/kg (52 weeks). 
Additional toxicity study was performed in dogs by intravenous route (39 weeks, dose ranging from 0.1 
to 0.6 mg/kg) as the maximum tolerated dose was not reached in the oral 52 week study. In addition, 
a juvenile rat study was also conducted at dose ranging from 0.4 to 3.2 mg/kg (Day 14 of age to day 
56). 
Following  asenapine  oral  administration,  adverse  clinical  signs  varied  by  species.  Evidence  of  partial 
recovery of these effects was noted.  
In  rats,  notable  effects  observed  consisted  of  reduced  motor  activity,  miosis,  palpebral  ptosis,  dose-
related decrease in body weight and food consumption in males, body weight decrease and increase in 
food  consumption  in  females  and  deteriorated  bodily  condition.  Biochemistry  analysis  showed  small 
reductions  in  blood  glucose,  cholesterol  and  triglycerides.  In  addition,  blood  urea-N  and  creatinine 
values were slightly increased, accompanied by increased urinary volume but without histopathological 
changes. Deaths occurred at high doses.  
In  dogs,  treatment  related  effects  included  miosis,  reduced  activity,  motor  in-coordination,  tremors, 
abnormal behaviour and increased heart rate. At doses ≥ 20 mg/kg only, some animals had reduced 
food  intake  and  lost  weight.  Inhibition  of  spermatogenesis  was  observed  at  40  mg/kg  and  higher.  In 
females, disturbance of the estrus cycle and increased secretory activity of mammary glands were also 
observed. There was a lack of reversibility of the effect on the estrus cycle related morphology of the 
uterus  compared  to  that  of  the  mammary  gland.  Dose-  and  time-dependent  hepatic  changes  were 
observed,  varying  from  various  degrees  of  liver  cell  damage,  accompanied  by  inflammatory  cell 
reactions.  Liver  enzyme  activities  in  blood  reflected  liver  lesions.  Accumulation  of  grayish-brownish 
intrahepatocellular pigment was noted. No deaths occurred. 
In dogs, high i.v doses induced severe clinical signs and body weight loss. The main treatment related 
effects  were  hypoactivity,  excitation  and  compulsive  disorder  which  generally  occured  within  10 
minutes after injection. ECG changes were also noted at all doses. No deaths occurred. 
Toxicokinetic data collected in dog studies (oral and intravenous) showed that the half-life of asenapine 
was  sufficiently  long  to  reach  a  steady-state  with  a  twice  daily  dosage  regimen.  There  was  no  PK 
difference  by  gender  after  single  or  multiple  dosing.  A  linearity  was  observed  between  AUC  and  the 
dose.

2.3.4.3. 
 Genotoxicity 
The mutagenicity of asenapine was evaluated in vitro in an Ames test, DNA repair test, and in a gene 
mutation  assay  in  mouse  lymphoma  cells.  The  clastogenic  potential  was  evaluated  in  vitro  in  human 
lymphocytes and in vivo in a rat micronucleus test. All of these studies had negative results. 
Two tested degradation products induced structural chromosomal aberrations in vitro in human blood 
lymphocytes.  However,  these  were  negative  in  the  Ames  test  and  did  not  show  evidence  of 
clastogenicity or DNA damage in a rat bone marrow micronucleus test and a Comet assay.  
2.3.4.4. 
 Carcinogenicity 
The  oncogenic  potential  of  asenapine  was  assessed  in  mice  and  rats  following  subcutaneous 
administration. Asenapine did not exhibit any organ specific, systemic or local tumorigenic potential. In 
mice,  dose-related  increase  in  morbidity/mortality  was  noted  with  associated  clinical  lesions  at 
different  sites  (skin/appendage,  uro-genital  tract  ,  gastrointestinal)  and  haemolympho-reticular 
tumours.  Fasciitis/fibrosis  was  suggestive  of  minor  local  response  but  no  macroscopic  findings  of 
carcinogenicity  were  found.  A  higher  incidence  of  cardiomyopathy  was  seen  at  high  doses  for  both 
males (0.5-5 mg/kg) and females (0.5-7.5 mg/kg). No treatment-related increases in tumours in the 
skin/subcutis,  or  injection  sites  were  reported.  In  rats,  treatment  dose-dependent  effects  were 
increased  subcutaneous  fibrosis  at  the  injection  sites,  increased  incidence  of  aggregation  of  foamy 
macrophages in lungs (NOAEL 1.2 mg/kg/day) and hypertrophied follicular epithelium in thyroid glands 
(NOAEL  for  males  0.3  mg/kg/day,  for  females  1.2  mg/kg/day).  An  increased  incidence  of 
cystic/haemorrhagic  (cortical)  degeneration  in  adrenal  glands  was  noted  in  males  at  1.2  and  5.0 
mg/kg/day.  The  incidence  and  severity  of  diffuse  C-cell  hyperplasia  in  the  thyroid  glands  was  dose-
dependently decreased. Asenapine has shown to reduce the incidence of a number of types of tumours 
(benign  mammary  tumours  and  pituitary  pars  distalis  tumours  in  females,  fatal  pituitary  pars  distalis 
tumours  and  injection  site  fibromas  in  males,  adrenal    phaeochromocytomas,  squamous  cell  tumours 
and histiocytic sarcoma) for both sexes.  
2.3.4.5. 
 Reproduction Toxicity 
The effect of asenapine on fertility and early embryonic development was assessed in male and female 
rats and in female rabbits. Asenapine did not impair fertility in rats. After oral dosing at 0.5 mg/kg in 
rats,  asenapine  caused  reduced  reproductive  performance  and  retardation  of  skeletal  development  of 
fetuses.  From  2.5-15  mg/kg,  significant  adverse  effects  on  reproductive  performance  and  offspring 
development  occurred  including  embryotoxicity  (increased  post-implantation  loss,  decreased  foetal 
weights,  and  delayed  ossification)  and  mortality.  The  embryotoxic  effects  were  also  observed  via 
intravenous  route  in  rats.  Increased  neonatal  mortality  was  noted  among  offsprings  of  female  rats 
treated  during  gestation  and  lactation,  this  was  most  likely  related  to  impairment  of  the  pups  than 
altered nursing behaviour. In rabbits, oral administered asenapine adversely affected the body weight 
at 15 mg/kg and caused embryotoxicity. The embryotoxic effects were not observed in rabbits dosed 
i.v. Asenapine did not reveal any signs of teratogenecity in both studied species. 
2.3.4.6. 
 Local Tolerance  
Asenapine  was  not  irritating  to  the  oral  cavity  but  did  cause  mild  to  moderate  clinical  signs  (e.g 
hypersalivation, stereotype behavior) in dogs.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583011/2010  
Page 17/88
 
 
 
2.3.4.7.  Other toxicity studies 
Asenapine  did  not  cause  any  sign  of  anaphylaxis  and/or  hypersensitivity  in  guinea  pigs.  It  was  non-
phototoxic in the 3T3-NRU assay. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An  ERA  according  to  CHMP  guideline  on  the  environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  for 
human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, June 2006) was submitted. The physiochemical properties of 
asenapine  are:  Molecular  mass:  401.84;  solubility  in  water,  3.7  mg/ml;  Log  Kow  (neutral):  4.9  and 
Log Kow (acid): 1.4. 
In Phase I, based on a maximum daily dose of 20 mg asenapine, a worst-case Predicted Environmental 
Concentration  in  surface  water  (PECsw)  of  0.1  µg/l  was  calculated  using  default  values.  In  addition, 
Asenapine  was  shown  to  be  not  ready  biodegradable  and  the  Aerobic  and  Anareobic  transformation 
study  in  aquatic  sediment  systems  (OECD  308)  demonstrated  significant  shifting  (>  10 %  after  or  at 
14  days)  of  asenapine  to  the  sediment  therefore  further  effect  testing  of  sediment  organisms.    The 
CHMP  concluded  that  a  Phase  II  (Tiers  A  and  B)  was  required  prior  any  final  conclusions  on  the  ERA 
could  be  reached.  In  addition,  endocrine  disrupting  effects  were  also  observed  for  asenapine  in 
mammals and reproductive effects on aquatic species could not be excluded. The CHMP was of opinion 
that the applicant should conduct a Phase II, Tier A and B studies and a study for potential endocrine 
disrupting effects.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacological studies adequately characterised the properties and principal effects of asenapine 
as well as potential harmful effects on vital organ systems. Receptor binding and functional studies in 
several  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  models  demonstrated  that  asenapine  has  a  combination  of  antagonist 
activities  at  D2  and  5-HT2A  ,  and  also    5-HT1A,  5-HT1B,  5-  HT2C,  5-HT6,  5-HT7,  D3,  and  α2 
adrenergic receptors.  
Several  animal  models  demonstrated  the  potential  usefulness  of  asenapine  as  an  antipsychotic  drug. 
Asenapine showed effects in models of cognitive dysfunction and anhedonia which may have relevance 
to  the  ability  of  asenapine  to  diminish  cognitive  and  negative/  affective  symptoms  associated  with 
schizophrenia.  There  was  also  correlation  between  doses  showing  in  vivo  receptor  activity  and 
neurochemical or neurobehavioural effects. It seems that potent blockade of serotonin, dopamine and 
noradrenaline  receptor  is  primarily  involved  in  mediating  the  effects  of  asenapine  on  behavioral  tests 
predictive of antipsychotic activity.  
The  safety  pharmacology  identified  mainly  CNS  (e.g  dystonia,  bradykinesia)  cardiac  (e.g  decrease  in 
arterial  blood  pressure,  orthostatic  hypotension)  and  endocrine  effects  (e.g  hyperprolactinaemia)  as 
possible targets for asenapine regarding potential adverse effects in man.  
The  results  of  pharmacokinetic  studies  in  animals  showed:  rapid  oral  absorption;  moderate  tissue 
distribution (but crossed the blood brain and placenta barriers), high protein binding and high systemic 
clearance. Asenapine drug related material is excreted both in urine and faeces and notably in milk. 
The majority of the findings in the repeated dose toxicity studies were related to the pharmacological 
activity  of  asenapine.  Clinical  signs  of  CNS  deterioration  (e.g  sedation;  reduced  motor 
activity/coordination)  and  prolactin-mediated  effects  on  mammary  glands  and  oestrus  cycle 
disturbances  were  observed.  In  addition,  hepatotoxicity  was  observed  at  high  dose  in  dogs  that  was 
was  not  observed  after  chronic  intravenous  administration.  Asenapine  had  also  some  affinity  to 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583011/2010  
Page 18/88
 
 
 
 
melanin-containing  tissues.  histopathological  examination  did  not  reveal  any  signs  of  ocular  toxicity. 
Furthermore, asenapine was non phototoxic in a vitro test. 
There was no evidence of genotoxicity in a standard package of tests. 
In carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice using the s.c route of administration, no increases in tumour 
incidences were observed.  
Asenapine did not impair fertility in rats and was not teratogenic in rat and rabbit. Embryotoxicity was 
found  in  reproduction  toxicology  studies  using  rats  and  rabbits.  Asenapine  caused  mild  maternal 
toxicity and slight retardation of foetal skeletal development. Following oral administration to pregnant 
rabbits during the period of organogenesis, asenapine adversely affected body weight at the high dose 
of 15 mg/kg twice daily. At this dose foetal body weight decreased. When asenapine was administered 
intravenously  to  pregnant  rabbits,  no  signs  of  embryotoxicity  were  observed.  In  rats,  embryofoetal 
toxicity  (increased  post-implantation  loss,  decreased  foetal  weights,  and  delayed  ossification)  was 
observed  following  oral  or  intravenous  administration  during  organogenesis  or  throughout  gestation. 
Increased neonatal mortality was observed among the offspring of female ratstreated during gestation 
and lactation. Increased neonatal mortality was noted among offsprings of female rats treated during 
gestation  and  lactation,  this  was  most  likely  related  to  impairment  of  the  pups  than  altered  nursing 
behaviour. 
Finally, the environmental impact of asenapine needed further evaluation and additional studies. The 
applicant committed to carry out such studies as a post-approval commitment.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
At  the  CHMP’s  request,  a  GCP  inspection  was  carried  out  at  3  of  the  74  investigational  sites  of  study 
A7501008  (investigators’  sites  located  in  the  US  and  Thailand).  Some  critical  findings  relating  to 
missing  documents  were  identified,  however  the  overall  conclusions  of  the  inspection  recommended 
that these data could be used for the evaluation of the present application. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The Phase I clinical pharmacology program has been conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with 
schizophrenia  using  oral  or  sublingual  formulations.  The  development  of  the  oral  formulation  was 
discontinued  because  of  its  low  bioavailability  (<2%)  caused  by  extensive  first-pass  metabolism.  In 
addition  to  the  Phase  I  studies,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  asenapine  have  been  investigated  in  two 
pooled analyses across the pharmacokinetic data of a range of clinical trials.  
Plasma concentration of asenapine and its analysed metabolites was determined using GC/MS, LC/MS , 
or  LC/MS/MS  methods  in  the  PK  studies.  Pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  determined  using  non 
compartmental models. Population PK analyses were conducted using nonlinear mixed effects modeling 
methodology (NONMEM).

2.4.2.1. 
 Absorption  
Asenapine  was  rapidly  absorbed  upon  sublingual  administration  with  peak  plasma  concentration 
occurring  within  0.5  to  1.5  hours.  The  absolute  bioavailability  of  sublingual  asenapine  at  5  mg  was 
35% whereas when swallowed was very low (<2% with an oral tablet formulation). Asenapine and its 
N-desmethyl  metabolites  appeared  to  be  a  weak  substrate  of  P-gp.  Minor  differences  were  noted  at 
different sites in the oral cavity, with a greatest extent of absorption via the buccal route as compared 
to the supralingual route. During concomitant water intake, Cmax and AUC of asenapine decreased by 
21 and 19 % after 2 minutes  and by 12 and 10 % after 5 minutes. During concomitant food intake, 
AUC  of  asenapine  immediately  decreased  by  21-22%.  The  SPC  recommends  that  eating  and  drinking 
should  be  avoided  for  10  minutes  after  administration.  Concomitant  smoking  following  sublingual 
administration had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of asenapine. 
Bioequivalence between  5 mg sublingual tablet applied for and the formulation used during phase  III 
studies was demonstrated. No bioequivalence was conducted with 10 mg tablet applied for. 
2.4.2.2. 
 Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, asenapine had a large volume of distribution (1731 L), indicating 
extensive extravascular distribution and reflecting its high lipophilicity. Asenapine is highly bound (95%) 
to human plasma proteins including albumin and α1- acid glycoprotein. 
2.4.2.3. 
 Elimination  
Asenapine had a high hepatic clearance after intravenous administration of 52 L/h. In a mass balance 
study,  the  majority  of  the  radioactive  dose  was  recovered  in  urine  (about  50%)  and  faeces  (about 
40%), with only a small amount excreted in faeces (5-16%) as unchanged drug. Its metabolites (N+-
glucuronide,  Ndesmethyl  and  11-O-sulfate)  showed  similar  elimination  profile  indicating  that  no 
accumulation  of  one  of  these  metabolites  is  to  be  expected.  The  terminal  half  life  was  approximately 
24 hours. 
2.4.2.4. 
 Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The  pharmacokinetics  was  approximately  dose  proportional  for  up  to  5mg  twice  daily  (bid),  the 
exposure thereafter increased less than in proportion to the dose. Increasing the dose from 5 to 10 mg 
twice daily (a two-fold increase) resulted in less than linear (1.7 times) increases in both the extent of 
exposure  and  maximum  concentration.  During  twice-daily  dosing,  steady-state  was  attained  within  3 
days. Overall, steady-state asenapine pharmacokinetics were similar to single-dose pharmacokinetics. 
2.4.2.5. 
 Special populations 
Population  pharmacokinetic  analyses  and  specific  phases  I  studies  evaluating  renal  and  hepatic 
functions, paediatric and elderly populations and the effect of race, gender and age were conducted. 
Specific studies were conducted in subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment at 0.3 and 5 mg 
sublingual  single  dose.  There  was  no  significant  difference  in  AUC  or  Cmax  after  5  mg  dose  between 
subjects  with  mild  to  moderate  renal  impairment  and  control  subjects.  There  were  no  data  in  severe 
renal impairment.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583011/2010

Specific studies were conducted in subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment at 0.3 
and  5  mg  sublingual  single  dose.  There  was  no  significant  difference  after  5  mg  dose  in  total  or 
unbound  AUC  of  asenapine  or  its  metabolites  (N-desmethyl,  N+  glucuronide)  between  subjects  with 
mild  to  moderate  hepatic  impairment  and  control  subjects.  However,  total  and  unbound  AUC  of 
asenapine  were  significantly  increased  by  5.3  and  7  times  higher  in  severe  hepatic  impairment 
subjects. Total exposure of its metabolites was also increased in those subjects. 
In elderly patients (between 65 and 85 years of age), AUC and Cmax were increased by approximately 
30 % as compared with younger adults after 5 and 10 mg BID doses. 
A  specific  study  was  conducted  in  Caucasian  and  Japanese  subjects  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  race. 
There were no significant differences observed between Caucasian and Japanese after 5 mg single or 
bid doses. However, population PK analysis showed a decrease in mean clearance of black subject by 
13.8% as compared to other ethnic origins. 
In adolescent patients (12 to 17 years), AUC and Cmax increased at dose ranging from 1mg to 5 mg 
bid and this increased exposure was less than proportional to the dose. A lower exposure was noted at 
higher dose (10 mg bid). 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not reveal any significant effect of gender nor age. Apart from 
a shorter estimated lag time in patients as compared to healthy volunteers, while their absorption rate 
was  estimated  to  be  approximately  50  %  lower,  no  pharmacokinetic  differences  could  be  observed 
between these 2 populations.  
2.4.2.6.  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro studies suggested inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 and induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 (only 
at very high concentrations above the therapeutic range). The potential interactions were studied  for 
the  following  drugs:  fluvoxamine  (CYP1A2  inhibitor),  imipramine  (CYP1A2/2C19/3A4  inhibitor), 
cimetidine  (CYP3A4/2D6/1A2  inhibitor),  carbamazepine  (CYP3A4/1A2  inducer)  and  valproate  (UGT 
inhibitor), dextrometorphan and paroxetine (CYP2D6 substrate/inhibitor).

Study 2552545 
This  was  an  open-label,  randomized,  two  parallel  group,  multiple  dose,interaction  trial  between 
asenapine, paroxetine and dextromethorphan in healthy male volunteers. 
In  sequence  A,  paroxetine  (20  mg)  was  given  on  Day  1.  After  one  day  of  placebo  dosing,1  mg 
asenapine (BID) was given on Day 4, followed by 3 mg (BID) on Day 5 and 5 mg (BID) on Days 6-16. 
On  Days  12 and  14,  single  doses  of  dextromethorphan  (30  mg)  and  paroxetine  (20  mg)  respectively 
were  co-administered.  In  sequence  B,  after  a  placebo  asenapine  dosing  on  Day  1,  asenapine  (5  mg) 
was  given  at  Day  2.  Paroxetine  20  mg  once  daily  was  given  for  9  days  (Day  7-15).  On  Day  11, 
dextromethorphan  (30  mg  single  dose)  was  co-administered.  On  Days  12  and  13,  placebo  asenapine 
and asenapine (5 mg single dose) were co-administered respectively.  
Seventeen  subjects  were  included  in  sequence  A, of  whom  13  subjects  (24-55  years)  completed  this 
sequence.  Thirty  subjects  were  included  in  sequence  B,  of  whom  twenty-six  subjects  (18-51  years) 
completed this sequence. Results showed a considerable increase of paroxetine plasma concentrations 
upon co-administration of asenapine. On average the AUC0-∞ as well as the Cmax of paroxetine were 
almost  2-fold  higher  after  the  combination  treatment  as  compared  tothe  paroxetine  alone  treatment. 
Vice versa, a drug interaction effect of paroxetine was absent on the AUC and slightly present on the 
Cmax  of  asenapine.  On  average  the  Cmax  of  asenapine  was  13%  lower  after  the  combination 
treatment  as  compared  to  the  asenapine  alone  treatment.  The  N-desmethylasenapine  plasma 
concentrations  were  also  slightly  increased  upon  co-administration  of  paroxetine.  Mean  decreases  in 
DX/DM  ratio  of  approximately  2.5  and  30  times  were  observed,  for  asenapine  and  paroxetine 
confirming CYP2D6 inhibition by both compounds. 
Study 2552646  
This was an open-label, randomized, three-period crossover interaction study between imipramine and 
asenapine in healthy male subjects. 
There were six groups of 4 subjects each. Each of the six possible treatment sequences was allocated 
to a group. The three following treatments were given within the same subject with a washout period 
of at least 1 week between successive drug administrations: 5 mg single sublingual dose of asenapine 
(treatment A), 75 mg single oral dose of imipramine (Treatment B), treatment A+B (treatment C). 
Results showed extensive metabolism of imipramine by CYP2D6 and other cytochromes. An effect was 
observed of imipramine on the peak asenapine plasma concentration (Cmax). On average the Cmax of 
asenapine  was  17%  higher  after  the  combination  treatment  as  compared  to  the  asenapine  alone 
treatment.  No  drug  interaction  effect  of  imipramine  on  extent  of  exposure  (AUC)  to  asenapine  was 
observed.  In  addition,  no  drug  interaction  effect  of  imipramine  on  the  PK  parameters  of  N-
desmethylasenapine  was  present.  The  rate  and  extent  of  exposure  to  imipramine  was  not  altered  by 
co-administration of asenapine. 
Study 2552847  
This  was  an  open-label,  interaction  study  to  investigate  the  effect  of  steady  state  carbamazepine  on 
the single dose pharmacokinetics of 5 mg asenapine in healthy male subjects 
Twenty  four  healthy  male  subjects  (18-45  years),  received  a  single  sublingual  dose  of  asenapine 
before  and  during  treatment  with  carbamazepine. A single  sublingual  dose of  5  mg  of  asenapine  was 
administered once on Day 1 and once on Day 20. Carbamazepine was orally administered on Days 4-7 
as 200 mg BID and on Days 8-22 as 400 mgBID.  
An  effect  of  carbamazepine  on  the  pharmacokinetics  was  present  for  asenapine  as  well  as  for  the 
metabolites  N-desmethylasenapine  and  asenapineN+-glucuronide.  On  average  the  AUC0-∞  of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583011/2010  
Page 22/88
 
 
 
asenapine  was  16%  lower  after  the  combination  treatment  as  compared  to  the  asenapine  alone 
treatment. For N-desmethylasenapine, the AUC0-∞ was 30% lower after the combination treatment as 
compared to the asenapine alone treatment and for asenapine N+-glucuronide 16% lower. The effects 
on  Cmax  were  similar  to  those  on  AUC  for  asenapine  and  N-desmethylasenapine.  The  6β–
hydroxycortisol/free  cortisol  ratio  in  urine  during  treatment  (day  19)  was  approximately  4  times  as 
high as on Day -1 during treatment (Day 19) to pre-treatment (Day -1) confirming the inducing effect 
of carbamazepine on CYP3A4. 
Study 2552948 
This  was  an  open  label,  randomized,  two-way  cross-over  trial  in  24  healthy  male  subjects  (18-45 
years),  in  which  a  single  dose  of  asenapine  was  sublingually  administered  without  (treatment  A)  and 
during treatment with cimetidine (treatment B). 
The following treatments were given in a two-period/two-sequence cross-over fashion, with a washout 
period  of  at  least  2  weeks  between  successive  treatment  periods:  single  sublingual  dose  of  5  mg 
asenapine on Day 1 (treatment A), multiple oral doses of 800 mg BID cimetidine during Days 1-7 with 
a  single  sublingual  dose  of  5  mg  asenapine  on  Day  5  (treatment  B).  On  Days  -1  and  3  during 
treatment B, subjects received a single oral dose of 100 mg caffeine and 30 mg dextromethorphan. 
An  effect  of  cimetidine  on  AUC  and  Cmax  was  present  for  N-desmethylasenapine,  and  to  a  lesser 
extent  for  asenapine,  N+-glucuronide  whereas  for  asenapine  no  drug  interaction  was  observed.  On 
average  the  N-desmethyl  asenapine  AUC0-∞  was  2.2  times  as  high  after  the  combination  treatment 
and  the  Cmax  1.5  times  as  high  as  compared  to  the  asenapine  alone  treatment.  During  treatment, 
paraxanthine/caffeine,  dextrorphan/  dextromethorphan  hydroxycortisol/free  cortisol  ratios  decreased 
by 36% (plasma), 75% (urine) and 23% (urine), respectively confirming observed inhibitory effects of 
cimetidine on CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. 
Study 04103349 
This  was  an  open  label,  randomized,  two-period,  2  sequences,  cross-over  trial  in  26  healthy  male 
subjects (18-55 years), in which a single dose of asenapine was administered alone or simultaneously 
with  multiple  doses  of  fluvoxamine.  In  addition  a  single  dose  of  caffeine  was  administered  alone  and 
simultaneously with multiple doses of fluvoxamine. 
The following treatments were given in a two-period crossover, randomized fashion with a washout of 
at least 1 week between the two treatment periods: a single sublingual dose of 5 mg asenapine on Day 
1 (treatment A), multiple doses of 25 mg fluvoxamine BID on Days 1-7 with a single sublingual dose of 
5 mg asenapine on Day 5 (treatment B) 
During treatment B, subjects received a single oral dose of 100 mg caffeine on Days -1 and 3. 
An  effect  of  fluvoxamine  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  asenapine  was  present  as  well  as  for  the 
metabolites  N-desmethylasenapine  and  asenapine  11-Osulfate.  Fluvoxamine  administered 
simultaneously  with  asenapine  increased  the  mean  extent  of  exposure  (AUC)  to  asenapine  with  29% 
and  the  mean  asenapine  peak  concentration  (Cmax)  with  13%.  In  addition,  it  doubled  the  mean  N-
desmethylasenapine  AUC  but  had  no  effect  on  N-desmethyl  Cmax.  The  mean  asenapine  11-O-sulfate 
AUC  after  the  combination  treatment  was  decreased  with  29%  and  the  mean  asenapine  11-O-sulfate 
Cmax was 2.5 times lower as compared to the asenapine alone treatment.  
During treatment (day3), paraxanthine/caffeine, ratio decreased was decreased 5.4 times as compared 
to pre-treatment (day-1) confirming observed inhibitory effects of fluvoxamine on CYP1A2.

Study 2552750 
This  was    an  open  label,  randomized,  two-way  cross-over  trial  in  24  healthy  male  subjects  (18-55 
years),  in  which  a  single  dose  of  5  mg  asenapine  was  sublingually  administered  alone  (treatment  A) 
and during treatment with valproate 500 mg BID orally for 9 days (treatment B). There was a washout 
of at least 2 weeks between successive treatment periods.  
No drug interaction was observed for the PK parameters Cmax and AUC of asenapine and for the Cmax 
of N-desmethylasenapine. However, a drug interaction effect of valproate on the PK parameters Cmax 
and  AUC  was  present  for  asenapine  N+-glucuronide  and  on  the  AUC  for  N-desmethylasenapine.  On 
average the AUC0-∞ and the Cmax of asenapine N+-glucuronide were respectively 7.4 and 6.6 times 
lower  after  the  combination  treatment  as  compared  to  the  asenapine  alone  treatment.  For  N-
desmethylasenapine, the AUC0-∞ was 30% lower after the combination treatment as compared to the 
asenapine alone treatment.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
2.4.3.1. 
 Mechanism of action 
As for other atypical antipsychotics the efficacy of asenapine in the claimed indications is proposed to 
be mediated, at least in part, through a combination of antagonist activity at D2 and 5-HT2A receptors. 
The  applicant  claimed  that  asenapine  has  a  unique  human  receptor  binding  profile  with  the  highest 
affinity  for  blocking  serotonin  receptors,  followed  by  dopamine  and  alpha-adrenergic  receptors.  It  is 
said  to  display  minimal  affinity  for  muscarinic  receptors.  In  addition  to  the  assumption  of  efficacy 
mediated  via  D2  and  5-HT2A  receptors,  the  applicant  claims  that  actions  at  other  receptors  (e.g.,  5-
HT2C,  5-HT6,  5-HT7  5-HT1A,  5-HT1B,  D3,  and  α2-adrenergic  receptors)  may  be  associated  with 
improvements in cognition, and negative and affective symptoms.  
In general, however, the exact mechanism of action of asenapine, as with other drugs with efficacy in 
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is unknown. 
2.4.3.2. 
 Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Three  clinical  studies  were  conducted  (2  in  healthy  subjects,  1  in  patients  with  schizophrenia)  to 
investigate  the  D2-dopamine  and  5HT2A-  receptors  binding  of  asenapine  using  Positron  Emission 
Tomography (PET). 
In study 25510 (n=3), following administration of a single sublingual dose of placebo followed, at least 
one  week  later,  by  a  single  sublingual  dose  of  100  μg  asenapine,  D2  receptor  occupancy  in  the 
putamen at 2.5h post-dosing of the three healthy males was 12%, 20% and 23%, respectively. The 5-
HT2A receptor occupancy by asenapine in the frontal cortex at 4.5h post-dosing was 15%, 15%, and 
30%, respectively. 
In study 25516 (n=6), following titrated administration of sublingual dose of asenapine (up to 300 μg 
BID) over three days in healthy males, mean D2-receptor occupancy was 31 % (29%) in the putamen 
(caudate  nucleus)  at  2  h  post-dosing  in  four  subjects  and  25%  (31%)  3.5  h  post-dosing  in  two

subjects. The occupancy decreased after this time point reaching 16% (18%) at 6 h, 5% (7%) at 12 h 
and 5 % (3%) at 24 h post dosing. 
In study 041007 (n=8), 6 subjects received BID asenapine doses of 2.4 mg (n = 1), 4.0 mg (n = 1) 
and  4.8  mg  (n  =  4),  and  in  two  subjects  were  on  placebo.  The  individual  percentages  of  central  D2 
occupancy for asenapine subjects ranged from 68-93% at approximately 2-6 h after dosing, with the 
majority  of  subjects  having  ≥90%  occupancy.  After  a  dose  of  4.8  mg,  an  average  occupancy 
percentage  of  79 %  was  obtained  at  approximately  3-4  h  after  dosing.  This  percentage  decreased  to 
66 % at 8 h after dosing and 38 % at 15 h after dosing. Peak occupancy in the subject at 2.4mg (93 
%, subject 1015) was equally high as for subjects on 4.8 mg; this could be attributed to the relatively 
high plasma levels of asenapine observed in this individual. 
Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic  modeling  indicated  striatal  D2  occupancy  by  asenapine  to  be 
directly related to plasma concentrations. At plasma concentrations of 0.72 ng/mL on average 50% of 
D2  receptors  occupancy  was  shown.  A  further  analysis  using  phase  II  trial  data  showed  dose-
dependency for asenapine D2 receptor occupancy (dose range 0.1 – 4.8 mg). 
No secondary pharmacology studies were performed in humans. 
2.4.4.  Discussion and conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  pharmacokinetic  profile  (absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and  elimination)  of  asenapine  has 
been  adequately  characterised.  No  major  PK  differences  were  observed  between  healthy  volunteers 
and patients with schizophrenia.  
Bioequivalence between  5 mg sublingual tablet applied for and the formulation used during phase  III 
studies was demonstrated. No bioequivalence was conducted with 10 mg tablet applied for. Based on 
the available data and feasibility concerns, the CHMP accepted that no bioequivalence was conducted 
with 10 mg tablet applied for. 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment and patients with mild to moderate 
hepatic  impairment.  However,  there  is  no  experience  with  asenapine  in  severe  renal  impairment 
(patients  with  a  creatinine  clearance  less  than  15  mL/min).  and  asenapine  is  not  recommended  in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment due to an observed 7-fold increase exposure in these patients. 
In  elderly  patients  (between  65  and  85  years  of  age),  exposure  to  asenapine  is  approximately  30  % 
higher  than  in  younger  adults.  At  the  5  mg  twice  daily  dose  level,  asenapine  pharmacokinetics  in 
adolescent  patients  (12  to  17  years  of  age,  inclusive)  are  similar  to  those  observed  in  adults.  In 
adolescents, the 10 mg twice daily dose did not result in increased exposure compared to 5 mg twice 
daily. 
Except for fluvoxamine, none of the interacting drugs medicinal products resulted in clinically relevant 
alterations  in  asenapine  pharmacokinetics.  During  combined  administration  with  a  single  dose  of 
asenapine  5  mg,  fluvoxamine  25  mg  BID  resulted  in  a  29  %  increase  in  asenapine  AUC.  The  full 
therapeutic dose of fluvoxamine would be expected to produce a greater increase in asenapine plasma 
concentrations. Therefore, caution concerning co-administration of both asenapine and fluvoxamine is 
reflected in the SPC.

2.4.5.  Clinical efficacy  
The  following  indications  were  initially  applied  for:  treatment  of  schizophrenia,  treatment  of  manic 
episodes  associated  with  Bipolar  I  disorder.  The  clinical  development  program  is  discussed  below  per 
indication. 
SCHIZOPHRENIA 
The clinical development program comprised a total of 20 trials, of which 17 were completed and three 
were ongoing as of the data cut-off date of 01 December 2008. The completed studies (except study 
0415901)  are  summarised  in  Tables  1-3    for  completed  Phase  II,  completed  Phase  III,  and  ongoing 
studies.  
Main studies are as follows: 
• 
Three phase II short-term 6-week, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trials (041002, 
041013, 041004) in subjects with schizophrenia; 
• 
Three phase III short-term 6-week, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trials. Two 
were of fixed dose design (041021, 041023) and the other employed a flexible dose of 5-
10mg BID (041022) in subjects with schizophrenia; 
•  A 52 week randomized placebo controlled relapse prevention trial (A7501012). 
•  A 52 week flexible dose study (25517) using olanzapine as active comparator in patients with 
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Trial 22520 was its double- blind extension. 
•  A 26 week flexible dose study (25543) using olanzapine as active comparator in patients 
schizophrenia with predominant persistent negative symptoms. Trial 25544 was its 26 weeks 
double-blind extension. 
Trials 041512 and 041513 were double-blind, flexible-dose, active-controlled, 1-year extensions to 
the short-term phase III trials (041021/041022 and 041023, respectively). 
The remaining studies (041500,  041505,  041502) were 1-year fixed double blind extensions of the 
phase  II  trials  (041002,  041013  and  041004,  respectively).  A  brief  summary  of  results  from  studies 
041500 and 041502 is provided, considering the small sample sizes of phase II extension trials.  
1 open-label humanitarian study for subjects who had successfully completed one of the short-term phase II trials 
and its extension and who were assessed by the investigator as potentially benefiting from continued therapy at the 
same dosage.

2.4.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The  three  main  phase  II  dose  ranging  studies  were  performed  and  designed  as  short-term  6-week, 
randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trials (041002,  041013,  041004). In all 3 studies, the 
primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline on the PANSS total score.  
In study 041002, six groups of twice daily doses of asepanine (0.2 mg, 0.4 mg, 0.8 mg, 1.6 mg, 2.4 
mg, 5 mg) were studied versus twice daily doses of risperidone 3 mg and placebo. All dose groups of 
asenapine  failed  to  demonstrate  superiority  over  placebo.  In  contrast,  the  risperidone  group  showed 
statistically  significant  difference  over  placebo  in  the  mean  change  from  baseline  score  on  the  Total 
PANSS at weeks 4, 5, and 6 suggesting that the study was sensitive and the tested doses of asenapine 
were  not  effective.  In  the  extension  study  041500,  a  total  of  51  subjects  were  enrolled  and  49 
continued  treatment  with  the  same  treatment  previously  received  in  study  041002.  No  statistical 
significant differences were observed in measured efficacy outcomes between placebo and any of the 
active treatment groups. 
In study 041013, higher twice daily doses of asenapine (1.6 mg and 2 mg) were compared to placebo. 
Mean  changes  from  baseline  were  -3.68  (placebo),  -8.67  (asenapine  1.6  mg)  and  –  5.81  (asenapine 
1.6 mg) showing favourable trends. However, both tested doses failed to reach statistical significance. 
In addition, no dose-response could be established in this study. 
In  study  041004,  twice  daily  dose  of  asenapine  5  mg  was  studied  versus  twice  daily  doses  of 
risperidone  3  mg  and  placebo.  The  tested  dose  demonstrated  statistical  significant  difference  over 
placebo. Main patients characteristics and results of this study are presented in Tables 4-7.

2.4.5.2. 
 Short term studies   
2.4.5.2.1. 
 Methods 
Study design 
The three main phase III short-term studies were designed as follows: 
-  041021:  a    6-week  ,  fixed-dose,  randomised,  double  blind  placebo-  and  active  –controlled  (4 
treatment  groups:  asenapine  5  mg  BID,  asenapine  10  mg  BID,  olanzapine  15  mg  QD,  or  placebo  in 
1:1:1:1 ratio) study in subjects with schizophrenia. 
-  041023  :  a    6-week  ,  fixed-dose,  randomised,  double  blind  placebo-  and  active  –controlled  (4 
treatment  groups:  asenapine  5  mg  BID,  asenapine  10  mg  BID,  haloperidol  4  mg  BID,  or  placebo  in 
1:1:1:1 ratio) study in subjects with schizophrenia; 
-  041022:    a  6-week,  flexible-dose,  randomised,  double  blind  placebo-  and  active  –controlled  (3 
treatment groups: asenapine 5/10 mg BID, olanzapine 10-20 mg QD, or placebo in 1:1:1 ratio) study 
in subjects with schizophrenia.

Studies  041021  and  041022  were  conducted  outside  EU  (Russia;  Ukraine  and  US)  and study  041023 
was conducted in Romania, Canada, India, Russia and US. 
Patients  who  completed  the  above  short  term  studies  were  eligible  to  enter  1-  year,  double  blind, 
flexible  dose,  active  controlled  extension  studies  (041512  for  041021  and  041022  ,  041513  for 
041023). 
In  studies  041512  and  041513,  the  randomized  subjects  continued  on  their  medication  into  the 
extension trial, and were maintained on the same dosage regimen for the first week. Placebo-treated 
subjects  were  randomized  to  asenapine  5  mg  BID  during  the  first  week  of  the  long-term  extension. 
After 1 week all blinded asenapine-treated subjects were maintained or titrated in either direction from 
5–10 mg BID. 
Study participants  
Main inclusion criteria 
Male or female (females must have been non-lactating, non-pregnant, and using an acceptable method 
of  birth  control,  or  not  of  childbearing  potential)  of  at  least  18  years  of  age,  and  current  DSM-IV-
TR−defined  diagnosis  of  schizophrenia  of  the  paranoid  type  [295.30],  disorganized  type  [295.10], 
catatonic type [295.20], or undifferentiated type [295.90].  
Other key inclusion criteria included having a PANSS score of at least 60 at screening and baseline (the 
baseline  PANSS  score  could  not  have  been  20%  or  more  lower  than  the  screening  PANSS  score);  a 
score of at least 4 on two or more of the five items of the positive subscale of the PANSS at screening 
and baseline; and a CGI-S score at least 4 (“moderately ill”) at baseline.  
Subjects were also required to have had a positive response to an antipsychotic medication other than 
clozapine, discontinued any depot neuroleptics prior to baseline, and provided written informed assent.  
Main exclusion criteria 
Potential participants were to be excluded from the trial if they met DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for 
schizophrenia  of  residual  subtype  (295.60)  or  schizoaffective  disorder  (295.70),  or  had  a  concurrent 
Axis I psychiatric disorder other than schizophrenia or a primary diagnosis other than schizophrenia. 
Other  key  exclusion  criteria  included  the  presence  of  an  uncontrolled,  unstable  clinically  significant 
medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator could interfere with the interpretation of safety 
and efficacy evaluations; a seizure disorder beyond childhood or the use of anticonvulsants to prevent 
seizures;  any  clinically  significant  abnormal  laboratory,  vital  sign,  physical  examination,  or  ECG 
findings at screening that precluded trial participation; a requirement during the inpatient phase of the 
trial  for  concomitant  treatment  with  a benzodiazepine  at  a  dose  greater  than  6  mg/day  of  lorazepam 
(or  the  equivalent  dose  of  another  short-acting  benzodiazepine);  a  history  of  substance  abuse  or 
dependence  (excluding  nicotine)  according  to  DSM-IV  criteria  within  6  months  before  screening. 
Subjects  previously  treated  in  an  asenapine  trial,  taking  clozapine  within  the  last  12  weeks  and 
subjects at imminent risk of self-harm or harm to others were also excluded.

Treatments  
Prior  active  treatment  period  (6  weeks),  there  were  a  screening  and  a  2-day  taper  period  (eligible 
severely ill subjects were permitted to be randomized immediately at the discretion of the investigator). 
The active treatment period was initiated on Day 1 following randomization of subjects. 
In  study  041-022,  subjects  randomized  to  the  asenapine  treatment  group  received  5  mg  asenapine 
BID and subjects randomized to the olanzapine treatment group received 10 mg olanzapine once daily 
during  the  first  7  days  of  the  double-blind  treatment  period.  At  the  Day  7  visit,  the  dose  could  be 
increased  in  an  increment  of  5  mg  BID  for  asenapine  or  5  mg  QD  for  olanzapine,  or  the  dose  could 
remain  the  same.  At  each  visit  thereafter,  doses  could  be  increased  in  5  mg  increments  (to  a 
maximum of asenapine 10 mg BID or olanzapine 20 mg QD), decreased (to a minimum of asenapine 5 
mg BID or olanzapine 10 mg QD), or remain the same. Decisions to change the dose were to be made 
by  the  investigator  at  the  subject’s  visit,  and  were  to  be  based  on  symptomatology  and  tolerability. 
Dose decreases could be made between visits only if intolerable adverse events prohibited a delay.  
Outcomes/endpoints  
The primary efficacy measure was the mean change from baseline to Week 6 on the total Positive and 
Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).  
Main  secondary  efficacy  measures  were  mean  change  from  baseline  to  Week  6  on  the  Clinical  Global 
Impressions of Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scales, Calgary Depression Scale 
for  Schizophrenia  (CDSS),  Hamilton  Anxiety  Scale  (HAM-A),  InterSePT  Scale  for  Suicidal  Thinking 
(ISST-Modified), Readiness for Discharge Questionnaire (RDQ), Fleming/Potkin neurocognitive battery; 
and Cognitive Function scale (CogFu). 
Health outcomes measures included functional outcomes, health-related quality of life, and treatment 
satisfaction  using  the  Quality  of  Life  Scale  (QLS),  Personal  Evaluation  of  Transitions  and  Treatments 
(PETiT), Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q). 
Statistical Methods 
All hypothesis testing was conducted using two-sided tests with alpha = 0.05 level of significance. The 
primary  efficacy  analysis  was  defined  as  a  comparison  of  the  least  squares  (LS)  mean  changes  from 
baseline to endpoint in the PANSS total score in each asenapine treatment group versus placebo using 
the last observation carried forward (LOCF) and an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with fixed 
effects  for  treatment  and  investigative  site  (or  pooled  site)  and  baseline  as  covariate  included  in  the 
model.  In  the  primary  analysis  only,  a  Hochberg  adjustment  method  was  used  to  adjust  the  two 
comparisons.  
To assess the robustness of the results against potential bias caused by missing data due to drop outs, 
supportive analyses based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) group were conducted using two methods: the 
previously  defined  ANCOVA  model  using  observed  cases  (OC)  and  a  mixed  model  analysis  using 
repeated  measures  (MMRM).  Comparisons  between  each  asenapine  group  and  the  placebo  treatment 
group for all other efficacy endpoints were considered secondary and were used to support the findings 
of  the  primary  analysis.  An  ANCOVA  model  was  also  used  to  compare  between  treatments  changes 
from  baseline  in  the  PANSS  subscale  and  Marder  factor  scores,  CGI-S  scores,  CDSS  scores,  HAM-A 
total  and  subscale  scores,  ISST-Modified  scores,  Fleming/Potkin  neurocognitive  scores,  CogFu  scores, 
QLS  total  and  subscale  scores,  PETiT  total  and  subscale  scores,  and  Q-LES-Q  subscale  scores.  RDQ

data  were  analyzed  using  Kaplan-Meier  survival  methods.  The  number  and  proportion  of  PANSS 
responders (a 30% or more decrease from baseline in the PANSS total score) and CGI-I responders (at 
least  “much  improved”  from  baseline)  were  analyzed  using  the  Cochran-Mantel-  Haentzel  test  with 
adjustment for site. 
The  olanzapine  (studies  041021  and  041022)  and  haloperidol  (study  041023)  group  versus  placebo 
group comparison were made for assessing assay sensitivity only.

10  mg  BID,  102;  olanzapine  15  mg  QD,  102  subjects.  This  set  of  subjects  was  defined  as  the  all-
subjects-treated group. A total of 386 subjects (92.6% of those randomly assigned to treatment) were 
included  in  the  intent-to-treat  group,  including  93,  102,  96,  and  95  subjects  subjects  in  the  placebo, 
asenapine 5 mg BID, asenapine 10 mg BID, and olanzapine 15 QD treatment groups, respectively. 
Baseline data 
The proportions of subjects in the placebo, asenapine 5 mg BID, asenapine 10 mg BID, and olanzapine 
15  mg  QD  treatment  groups  who  withdrew  from  the  trial  during  the  double-blind  treatment  phase  of 
the trial were 50.0%, 42.3%, 50.0%, and 43.1%, respectively.  
Insufficient  therapeutic  effect  (defined  as  lack  of  efficacy  or  an  adverse  event  considered  to  be  a 
worsening  of  schizophrenia)  led  26  (26.0%)  subjects  treated  with  placebo,  15  (14.4%)  subjects 
treated  with  asenapine  5  mg  BID,  15  (14.7%)  subjects  treated  with  asenapine  10  mg  BID,  and  12 
(11.8%) subjects treated with olanzapine to withdraw from the trial. 
The  four  treatment  groups  were  well  balanced  with  respect  to  most  demographic  characteristics. 
Within the all-subjects-treated group, Most subjects were either Caucasian (46.3%) or Black (44.9%). 
Subjects  ranged  in  age  from  18  to  70  years,  with  an  overall  mean  (SD)  age  of  40.2  (10.9)  years. 
Subjects’  BMI  (Body  Mass  Index)  ranged  from  18  to  56  kg/m2;  the  mean  BMI  (SD)  was  28.0  (5.5) 
kg/m2.  The  proportion  of  males  was  smaller  in  the  placebo  treatment  group  (58.0%)  than  in  the 
asenapine  5  mg  BID  (74.0%),  asenapine  10  mg  BID  (70.6%)  and  olanzapine  (78.4%)  treatment 
groups. 
The  duration  of  the  present  episode  of  schizophrenia  (less  than  1  month  in  60.8%  of  olanzapine-
treated subjects versus 50.0-52.9% of subjects in the other groups, and more than 1 year in 16.7% of 
subjects  in  the  asenapine  10  mg  BID  treatment  group  versus  6.9-12.0%  of  subjects  in  the  other 
treatment groups) and the number of years since the onset of schizophrenia (20 or more years prior to 
the start of the trial in greater than 40% of subjects treated with asenapine 10 mg BID and olanzapine 
compared with 28.0% of subjects treated with placebo). 
Mean scores at baseline on all efficacy parameters were similar across treatment groups. The baseline 
PANSS total score means for placebo, asenapine and olanzapine groups were: 92.43, 96.48, and 92.43,  
respectively.

Outcomes 
No  statistically  significant  differences  in  the  mean  changes  from  baseline  to  endpoint  in  the  PANSS 
total  score  were  observed  between  placebo  (-11.1)  and  asenapine  5  mg  (-14.5)  or  asenapine  10  mg 
BID (-13.4).  Mean change from baseline to week 6 on  PANSS total score for placebo, asenapine 5 mg 
BID,  asenapine  10  mg  BID  and  olanzapine  15  mg  QD  were  -11.1,  -14.5,  -13.4,  -16.5,  respectively. 
Compared  with  placebo,  olanzapine  treatment  resulted  in  a  statistically  significantly  greater  mean 
change from baseline in the PANSS total score (-16.5, p=0.0168). 
With respect to secondary outcome measures, asenapine 5 mg BID and olanzapine treatments resulted 
in statistically significantly greater decreases from baseline to endpoint in the PANSS positive subscale 
score,  Marder  positive  symptoms  factor  score,  and  PANSS  Marder  hostility/excitement  factor  score  at 
endpoint.  Asenapine  10  mg  BID  was  no  different  from  placebo  on  these  measures  at  endpoint. 
Statistically  significant  differences  between  placebo  and  olanzapine  (but  not  asenapine  at  either  dose 
level)  were  achieved  in  PANSS  general  psychopathology  subscale  and  PANSS  Marder  disorganized 
thought  factor  scores  at  endpoint.  None  of  the  active  treatments  had  a  significant  effect  on  PANSS 
negative subscale scores, or on PANSS Marder negative symptom or anxiety/depression factor scores. 
No  statistically  significant  differences  in  the  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  the  CGI-S  scores  were 
observed between asenapine 5 mg BID or asenapine 10 mg BID and placebo at endpoint or any trial 
visit. No statistically significant differences between any active treatment and placebo were observed in 
the proportions of CGI-I responders at endpoint. 
No statistically significant differences between any active treatment group and placebo were observed 
in  the  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  the  CDSS  score,  the  ISST-modified,  the  RDQ,  QLS  total  or 
subscale scores or PETiT total or subscale scores at endpoint . 
Compared  with  placebo,  treatment  with  asenapine  10  mg  BID  resulted  in  statistically  significantly 
greater  mean  increases  from  baseline  to  endpoint  in  the  Q-LES-Q  leisure  time  activities  and  social 
relations subscale scores. Statistically significant differences between olanzapine and placebo were also 
observed  on  the  Q-LES-Q  leisure  time  activities  subscale  at  endpoint.  No  statistically  significant 
placebo  corrected  mean  changes  from  baseline  were  observed  at  endpoint  in  the  Intent-to-  Treat 
group  on  any  of  the  tests  of  neuropsychological  function  that  comprise  the  Potkin’s  Fleming  battery, 
the CogFu, for any active treatment group. 
The  proportion  of  PANSS  responders  was  statistically  significantly  greater  in  the  asenapine  5  mg  BID 
and  olanzapine  treatment  groups  at  endpoint  (LOCF).  No  statistically  significant  differences  in  the 
proportions  of  PANSS  responders  were  observed  between  asenapine  10  mg  BID  and  placebo  at 
endpoint. 
Study 041023  
Participant flow 
A total of 458 subjects were randomized in the trial: placebo, 123 subjects; asenapine 5mg BID, 114 
subjects;  asenapine  10  mg  BID,  106  subjects;  haloperidol,  115  subjects.  Of  these  subjects,  455 
subjects received treatment and were included in the all-subjects treated group: placebo, 123 subjects; 
asenapine  5mg  BID,  111  subjects;  asenapine  10  mg  BID,  106;  haloperidol,  115  subjects.  Of  these 
subjects,  448  subjects  had  at  least  one  post-baseline  PANSS  assessment  and  were  included  in  the

intent-to-treat  group:  placebo,  122  subjects;  asenapine  5  mg  BID,  109  subjects;  asenapine  10  mg 
BID,105 subjects; haloperidol, 112 subjects. 
Baseline data 
The proportions of subjects in the placebo, asenapine 5 mg BID, asenapine 10 mg BID, and haloperidol 
treatment  groups  who  withdrew  from  the  trial  during  the  double-blind  treatment  period  were  43.1%, 
36.9%, 33.0%, and 40.9%, respectively.  
Adverse events led 10.6%, 4.5%, 9.4%, and 10.4% of subjects in the placebo, asenapine 5 mg BID, 
asenapine  10  mg  BID,  and  haloperidol  treatment  groups  to  withdraw  from  the  trial.  Insufficient 
therapeutic  effect  led  25.2%,  12.6%,  16.0%,  and  8.7%  of  subjects  in  the  placebo,  asenapine  5  mg 
BID, asenapine 10 mg BID, and haloperidol treatment groups to withdraw from the trial. 
The  asenapine  5  mg  BID  and  10  mg  BID  treatment  groups  included  a  higher  proportion  of  males 
(67.6% and 63.2%, respectively) than the placebo (52.0%) and haloperidol (54.8%) treatment groups. 
The four treatment groups were well balanced with respect to demographic characteristics at baseline. 
Most subjects were either Caucasian (62.0%) or Black (25.7%). Subjects ranged from 18 to 70 years, 
and the overall mean age was 38.6 years. Subjects’ BMI ranged from 17 to 51 kg/m2; the mean BMI  
was 26.3 kg/m2.  
The mean age of subjects at the onset of schizophrenia was 26.0 years, and for 56.7% of the subjects, 
the onset of their schizophrenia occurred more than 10 years before trial entry. Approximately 53.8% 
of  subjects  had  previously  experienced  4  or  more  episodes  of  schizophrenia  that  resulted  in 
hospitalization.  
Mean  scores  at  baseline  on  all  efficacy  parameters  were  similar  across  treatment  groups.  The  total 
PANSS  mean  scores  at  baseline  were  89.0  for  placebo  treated  subjects  (n=122),  88.9  for  (109) 
asenapine 5 mg BID treated subjects (n=109), 89.4 for asenapine 10 mg BID treated subjects (n=105) 
and 88.5 for haloperidol 4 mg BID treated subjects (n=112), respectively. 
Outcomes 
Treatment with asenapine 5 mg BID resulted in a statistically significantly greater mean change from 
baseline  to  endpoint  (LOCF)  in  the  PANSS  total  score  compared  with  that  in  the  placebo  treatment 
group  (placebo  [-10.7]  versus  asenapine  5  mg  BID  [-16.2],  adjusted  p=0.0290).  Statistically 
significant  differences  in  favor  of  asenapine  5  mg  BID  relative  to  placebo  were  consistently  apparent 
starting on day 21.  
Statistical  analysis  of  the  mean  change  from  baseline  in  the  PANSS  total  scores  using  the  observed-
case (OC) method and the results of a MMRM were consistent with the findings of the LOCF analysis for 
asenapine 5 mg BID.  
The  mean  change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  (LOCF)  in  the  PANSS  total  score  was  statistically 
significantly  greater  in  the  haloperidol  treatment  group  compared  with  the  placebo  treatment  group 
(placebo [-10.7] versus haloperidol [-15.4], unadjusted p=0.0342). 
No  statistically  significant  difference  between  asenapine  10  mg  BID  and  placebo  was  observed  in  the 
mean  change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  (LOCF)  in  the  PANSS  total  score  (placebo  [-10.7]  versus 
asenapine  10  mg  BID  [-14.9],  adjusted  p=0.0680).  In  the  OC  and  MMRM  analyses  of  the  primary 
endpoint  starting  on  day  35,  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  favor  of  asenapine  10  mg  BID  [-
18.5] compared with placebo [-14.0] was observed (p=0.0167).

With  respect  to  secondary  outcome  measures,  treatment  with  asenapine  5  mg  BID  resulted  in 
statistically significant changes from baseline, compared with placebo, the PANSS positive and general 
psychopathology  subscales  and  the  PANSS  Marder  positive  symptoms  and  disorganized  thoughts 
factors; PANSS responders (defined as at least 30% change from the baseline total PANSS score) and 
CGI-I responder rates; as well as the CGI-S and CDSS. Improvements on cognition (OC), quality of life 
(QoL)  were  observed  with  statistical  significant  difference  over  placebo  on  scores  in  the  composite 
memory and processing speed domains of the CNS Vital Signs neurocognitive battery, QLS total score. 
No  differences  between  asenapine  5  mg  BID  and  placebo  were  observed  on  measures  of  negative 
symptoms, the ISST, RDQ, PETiT, or Q-LES-Q.  
Asenapine 10 mg BID showed statistically significant difference over placebo on changes from baseline 
to  endpoint  on  both  the  PANSS  positive  subscale  and  Marder  positive  symptoms  factor.  The  higher 
dose also resulted in a statistically significantly greater proportion of total PANSS 30% responder score 
change from baseline to endpoint, compared with placebo treatment. No further significant treatment 
effects were apparent for asenapine 10 mg BID on any other efficacy or health outcomes measures.  
There was no statistically significant difference for PANSS 30% responder rate changes from baseline 
to endpoint between haloperidol 4 mg BID and placebo treatment. 
Study 041022 
Participant flow 
A total of 277 subjects were randomized in the trial: placebo, 93 subjects; asenapine 5mg/10 mg BID, 
91 subjects; olanzapine 10-20mg QD, 93 subjects. A total of 275 subjects (99.3% of those randomly 
assigned to treatment) received at least 1 dose of double-blind trial medication, including 93, 90, and 
92  subjects  who  received  placebo,  asenapine,  and  olanzapine,  respectively.  This  set  of  subjects  was 
defined as the all-subjects-treated group. A total of 259 subjects (93.5% of those randomly assigned 
to treatment), including 89, 85, and 85 subjects in the placebo, asenapine; and olanzapine treatment 
groups, respectively, were included in the ITT group. 
Baseline data 
The proportions of subjects in the placebo, asenapine, and olanzapine treatment groups who withdrew 
from the trial during the double-blind treatmentperiod were 48.4%, 53.3%, and 53.3%, respectively. 
Adverse events led 5.4% of placebo-treated subjects, 6.7% of asenapine-treated subjects, and 12.0% 
of  olanzapine-treated  subjects  to  discontinue  during  the  double-blind  treatment  phase  of  the  trial. 
Insufficient  therapeutic  response,  led  17.2%,  7.8%,  and  22.8%  subjects  in  the  placebo,  asenapine, 
and olanzapine treatment groups, respectively, to withdraw from the trial. 
Within  the  all-subjects-treated  group,  the  three  treatment  groups  were  well  balanced  with  respect  to 
demographic  characteristics  at  baseline.  The  trial  population  was  predominantly  male  (77.5%),  and 
most  subjects  were  either  Caucasian  (46.5%)  or  Black  (45.1%).  The  subjects  ranged  from  20  to  67 
years, and the mean age was 42.5 years. Subjects’ BMI ranged from 17 to 50 kg/m2, and the mean 
BMI was 28.1 kg/m2.  
Within the all-subjects-treated group, the mean age of subjects at the onset of schizophrenia was 25.8 
years.  The  duration  of  the  present  episode  was  greater  than  6  months  for  14.6%  of  subjects.  The

proportion  of  subjects  who  had  previously  experienced  4  or  more  episodes  of  schizophrenia  that 
resulted in hospitalization was 70.5%.  
Mean scores at baseline on all efficacy parameters were similar across treatment groups. The baseline 
PANSS total score means for placebo, asenapine and olanzapine groups were: 84.7 ,86.8 , and 86.5,  
respectively. 
Outcomes 
No statistically significant differences (p>0.05) in the mean changes from baseline to endpoint in the 
PANSS total score were observed between asenapine (-9.4) and placebo (-9.9) or between olanzapine 
(-11.5) and placebo (-9.9). 
No statistically significant (p>0.05) differences between asenapine and placebo or between olanzapine 
and placebo were observed in the mean changes from baseline to endpoint in any secondary efficacy 
or health outcomes measures. 
Extension studies 
-  Study 041512 
A  total  of  205  subjects  were  randomized  and  treated,  comprising  the  all-subjects-treated  group  (57 
subjects,  placebo/asenapine;  86  subjects,  asenapine  5-10  mg  BID  and  62  subjects,  olanzapine  5-20 
mg QD). The ITT group consisted of 192 subjects (52, placebo/asenapine; 81, asenapine 5-10 mg BID 
and 59, olanzapine 5-20 mg QD). 
Based on the estimation of the time to loss of effect, the median survival times were 29 days in both 
asenapine and olanzapine groups. The number of subjects with a loss of effect in the asenapine 5-10 
mg BID treatment group was 42/46 (91.3%) and in the olanzapine 5-20 mg QD treatment group was 
32/36 (88.5%). In the OC analysis (ITT group),  mean changes from baseline to week 52 and endpoint 
on  PANSS  total  score,  PANSS  subscale  scores,  (positive,  negative,  and  general  psychopathology, 
PANSS  Marder  factor  symptom  scores,  (positive,  negative,  disorganized  thought,  hostility/excitement 
and anxiety/depression), CGI-Severity (CGI-S) were comparable between the two groups.  At Week 52 
and  at  endpoint,  the  asenapine  group  had  a  lower  proportion  of  responders  (72.2%  and  46.9%) 
compared  to  the  olanzapine  5-20  mg  QD  treatment  group  (91.3%  and  72.9%).  In  the 
placebo/asenapine  treatment  group,  71.2%  of  subjects  were  responders  at  endpoint.  At  endpoint, 
35.8%  of  subjects  in  the  asenapine  group  were  responders  compared  to  54.2%  in  the  olanzapine 
group and 71.2% in the placebo/asenapine group. 
-  Study 041513:  
A  total  of  187  subjects  were  randomized,  with  185  subjects  treated,  comprising  50  subjects  in  the 
placebo/asenapine  treatment  group;  92  subjects  in  the  asenapine  5-10  mg  BID  treatment  group  and 
43 subjects in the haloperidol 2-8 mg BID treatment group. The Intent-to-Treat group consisted of 176 
subjects  (47  subjects,  placebo/asenapine;  88  subjects,  asenapine  5-10  mg  BID  and  41  subjects, 
haloperidol 2-8 mg BID). 
The number of subjects with loss of effect included 55/65 (84.6%) subjects in the asenapine 5-10 mg 
BID treatment group and 26/29 (89.7%) subjects in the haloperidol group.

In the OC analysis (ITT group), mean changes from baseline to week 52 and endpoint on PANSS total 
score, PANSS subscale scores, (positive, negative, and general psychopathology, PANSS Marder factor 
symptom 
scores, 
(positive, 
negative, 
disorganized 
thought, 
hostility/excitement 
and 
anxiety/depression), CGI-Severity (CGI-S) were comparable between the two groups.  At Week 52 and 
at endpoint, the asenapine group had a lower proportion of PANSS total score responders (84.6% and 
62.5%) compared to the haloperidol group (100.0% and 78.0%). In the placebo/asenapine treatment 
group 66.0% of subjects were responders at endpoint. 
2.4.5.2.3.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Several meta analyses on short term efficacy results were conducted by the applicant and are 
presented in Figures 1-2. 
Using LOCF to impute missing data, the treatment effect was -2.7 points greater for asenapine versus 
placebo  (p=0.021;  95%  CI  -5.0  to  -0.4).  Similarly,  using  MMRM  to  account  for  missing  data  the 
treatment effect was 3.0 points greater for asenapine versus placebo (p=0.024; 95% CI -5.7 to -0.4).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583011/2010

Using LOCF to impute missing data, the treatment effect was -3.7 points greater for asenapine versus 
placebo  (p=0.011;  95%  CI  -5.9  to  -1.5). Similarly,  using  a  mixed  model  for  repeated  measurements 
(MMRM) to account for missing data the treatment effect was 3.9 points greater for asenapine versus 
placebo (p=0.021; 95% CI -6.3 to -1.4). 
The applicant also presented several sensitivity analyses to investigate the robustness of the estimate 
of the treatment effect for asenapine versus placebo. These are summarised in Table 8.

Considering  the  phase  III  data,  positive  treatment  effect  of  asenapine  versus  placebo  (OR=1.9,  95% 
CI  1.3  to  2.6;  p<0.001)  was  observed,  meaning  that  for  every  10  patients  treated  with  asenapine 
instead of placebo one additional responder would be observed.  
The actual response rates (and their 95% CIs) for asenapine, active control and placebo are presented 
in Table 10.

Based on the LOCF method, the difference was 1.7 points with a 95% confidence interval of -0.04 to 
3.4  (p=0.055).  Based  on  MMRM  method,  a  treatment  difference  of  0.55  points  is  observed  on  the 
PANSS total scale with a 95% confidence interval of -1.17 to 2.28 (p=0.529).  
2.4.5.2.4.  Additional statistical analyses 
Comparative statistical analyses on primary endpoints for studies 004, 021, 022 and 023  were

Main exclusion criteria 
Potential participants were to be excluded from further consideration if they responded well to current 
antipsychotic  treatment  and  there  was  no  clinical  need  to  stop  this  treatment;  had  taken  an 
investigational drug within 30 days prior to baseline; had an uncontrolled, unstable clinically significant 
renal,  endocrine,  hepatic, respiratory,  cardiovascular,  hematological, immunologic,  or  cerebrovascular 
disorder,  or  malignancy;  had  a  seizure  disorder  beyond  childhood  or  were  taking  anticonvulsants  to 
prevent seizures; had any clinically significant abnormal laboratory, vital sign, physical examination, or 
ECG  findings  prior  to  randomization  that  precluded  trial  participation;  showed  a  positive  result  for 
hepatitis; had a diagnosis of schizophrenia of the residual type (DSM-IV, 295.60) required concomitant 
treatment  at  baseline  with  psychotropic  drugs  other  than  zolpidem,  zaleplon,  zopiclone,  chloral 
hydrate,  or  benzodiazepines;  had  a  score  greater  than  “mild”  (i.e.  Score  >  2)  on  any  item  of  the 
Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) at baseline; showed continued use of illicit drugs and/or 
alcohol within 30 days before the screening visit or showed positive findings in the alcohol/drug screen, 
unless  the  investigator  felt  that  the  subject  would  be  compliant  with  the  study  medication  and  would 
be a suitable candidate for the study; had a concurrent psychiatric disorder other than schizophrenia or 
schizoaffective  disorder  coded  on  Axis  I  DSM-IV;  were  a  risk  of  self-harm  or  harm  to  others  at 
screening,  during  the  run-in  period,  or  baseline;  were  previously  exposed  to  asenapine;  or  did  not 
tolerate,  or  did  not  respond  well  to  previous  treatment  with  olanzapine  at  ‘adequate’  dosage  (≥20 
mg/day, ≥ 6 consecutive weeks). 
Treatments  
Prior active treatment period (52 weeks), there were a screening and a 3 to 9 days run-in period. The 
active treatment period was initiated on Day 1 following randomization of subjects to either asenapine 
5 or 10 mg BID or olanzapine 10 to 20 mg QD in a 3:1 ratio. 
Outcomes/endpoints  
The primary efficacy measure was the mean change from baseline to Week 52 on the total Positive and 
Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).  
Main  secondary  efficacy  measures  were  mean  change  from  baseline  to  Week  52  on  the  three  PANSS 
subscales  (Positive,  Negative,  General  Psychopathology)  and  on  the  five  PANSS  Marder  factors 
(Positive symptom, Negative symptom, Disorganized thought symptom, Hostility/Excitement symptom 
and  Anxiety/Depression  symptom),  on  Clinical  Global  Impressions  of  Severity  of  Illness  (CGI-S)  and 
Improvement (CGI-I) scales. 
Health outcomes measures included Quality of life using the Subjective Well-being under Neuroleptics 
(SWN) short form, the norm-based Physical Component Scale (PCS) and the Mental Component Scale 
(MCS)  of  the  Short  Form  health  survey  (SF-12).  Satisfaction  with  treatment  was  measured  through 
patient’s  and  investigator’s  opinions,  and  depression  with  the  Calgary  Depression  Scale  for 
Schizophrenia (CDSS). 
Statistical Methods 
All hypothesis testing was conducted using two-sided tests with alpha = 0.05 level of significance. The 
primary efficacy analysis was defined as a comparison of the change from baseline in the total PANSS 
score  at  Endpoint  in  the  asenapine  and  olanzapine  treatment  groups  using  an  analysis  of  covariance 
(ANCOVA) with treatment as fixed effect, center as random effect and baseline as covariate included in 
the model.  
CHMP assessment report

ANCOVA was also used to compare between treatments the changes from baseline in the total PANSS 
score over time (repeated measures model), the PANSS subscales and the PANSS Marder factors.  
2.4.5.3.1.2.  Results 
Participant flow 
A  total  of  1225  subjects  were  randomized  in  the  trial:  asenapine  5-10  mg  BID,  913  subjects; 
olanzapine  10-20  mg  QD,  312  subjects.  Of  these  subjects,  1219  subjects  received  treatment: 
asenapine 5-10 mg BID, 908 subjects; olanzapine 10-20mg QD, 311 subjects. 
Baseline data 
The majority of subjects (77.8%) suffered from schizophrenia of the paranoid type, while 13.1% of the 
subjects  were  diagnosed  with  schizoaffective  disorder.  For  almost  half  of  the  subjects  (43.9%),  the 
duration of the present episode was 1 to 6 months. Most of the subjects (93.2%) had experienced one 
or  more  earlier  episodes  of  schizophrenia  or  schizo-affective  disorder.  The  longitudinal  course  was 
classified as ‘Episodic with interepisodic residual symptoms’ for  49.7% of the subjects. A total of 691 
treated  subjects  (56.7%)  discontinued  the  trial  prematurely.  The  proportion  of  discontinued  subjects 
was  higher  in  the  asenapine  group  (61.5%)  compared  to  the  olanzapine  group  (42.8%).  Subjects  in 
the asenapine group were more likely to withdraw due to adverse events related to worsening of the 
disease, lack of efficacy and withdrawal of consent. The discontinuation rate caused by adverse events 
not related to worsening of the disease was similar in both treatment groups (6.3% for the asenapine 
group  versus  6.8%  for  the  olanzapine  group).  The  total  number  of  subjects  who  dropped  out  due  to 
insufficient therapeutic effect (i.e. the combination of the subjects discontinued due to lack of efficacy 
and the subjects discontinued due to AEs related to worsening of the disease) was 25.1% and 14.5% 
for  the  asenapine  group  and  olanzapine  group,  respectively.  In  the  asenapine  group,  59.5%  of  the 
subjects had their dose increased to the high dose at some point in time during their treatment. In the 
olanzapine group, 54.3% of the subjects had their dose increased to the high dose.  
Outcomes 
Statistically  significant  difference  (p<0.001)  in  the  mean  change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  in  the 
PANSS total score was observed in favour of olanzapine. At baseline, the PANSS total scores were 92.1 
for both asenapine and olanzapine groups. At week 52, the PANSS total scores were 71.0 and 64.6 for 
asenapine and olanzapine groups, respectively (difference: 6.54, 95% CI: 3,87-9,21). Results of main 
secondary efficacy measures were consistent with those of the total PANSS score. 
2.4.5.3.2.  Study A7501012 
2.4.5.3.2.1.  Methods 
Study participants  
Main inclusion criteria 
Male or female of at least 18 years of age and a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia (DSM-IV-295) with 
documented  history  of  at  least  one  prior  episode  of  acute  schizophrenia  in  the  three  years  preceding 
the  screening  assessment  and  requiring  continuous  antipsychotic  treatment  for  at  least  one  year 
preceding screening. Subjects were clinically stable at the time of being recruited into the trial defined 
by at least a 4-week period of stable symptoms (Period 1) Subjects were eligible for the double-blind 
CHMP assessment report

treatment  phase  (Period  3)  if  they  had  continued  stable  presentation  of  symptoms  during  the  open-
label phase (Periods 1 and 2). Loss of stability was defined as an increase from open-label baseline in 
PANSS  of  20%  or  12  points  (whichever  was  higher)  a  PANSS  total  score  >75or  if  any  of  the  other 
PANSS/ISST screening thresholds were failed. 
Main exclusion criteria 
Subjects were excluded if PANSS was > 80 at screening, CGI-S was >4 at screening or if any of PANSS 
“unusual  thought  content”,  “conceptual  disorganisation”,  “hallucinatory  behaviour”,  “hostility”  or 
“uncooperativeness”  were  ≥4  at  screening  and  InterSePT  Scale  for  Suicidal  Thinking-Modified  (ISST-
Modified) item score of 2 on item #7 “control over suicidal action,” #10 “method: specificity/planning,” 
or #11 “expectancy/ anticipation.” 
Treatments 
Period 1: up to 4 weeks of open-label cross-titration from prior medication to sublingually administered 
asenapine 5 or 10 mg BID  
Period  2:  at  least  22  weeks  of  open  label  monotherapy  treatment  during  which  subjects  were 
maintained on sublingually administered asenapine 5 or 10 mg BID. 
Period 3: A randomised double-blind of treatment of up to 26 weeks , during which subjects stabilised 
on  asenapine  were  randomised  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  received  asenapine  5  or  10  mg  BID  or  placebo 
sublingually administered. 
The  starting  dose  of  asenapine  was  5  mg  BID;  after  the  first  week  of  treatment,  all  subjects  were 
titrated up to a dose of 10 mg BID. The dose could be reduced to 5 mg BID for individual subjects if 
undesirable effects occurred at the 10 mg BID dose; after the effects subsided the dose of asenapine 
could  be  increased  back  to  10  mg.  Subjects  who  could  not  tolerate  the  10  mg  BID  dose  after 
rechallenge were allowed to continue at a 5 mg BID dose. 
Outcomes/endpoints  
The primary endpoint was defined as time to relapse or an impending relapse. A relapse or impending 
relapse was declared if any of the criteria 1, 2, 3 and 4 (1-3 are referred to as “symptomatic relapse 
criteria” were met: 
Criteria 1: a) PANSS total score increase of ≥20% from baseline of the double-blind treatment phase 
and b) Clinical Global Impression (Severity of Illness) (CGI-S) ≥4 (moderately ill), on at least 2 days 
within a 1 week period (Subjects with a PANSS total score <50 at baseline must have had an increase 
from baseline of at least 10 points on the PANSS total score). 
OR 
Criteria  2:    a)  PANSS  score  of  ≥5  (moderately  severe)  on  items  of  “hostility”  (Item  7),  or 
“uncooperativeness” (Item 22) and b) CGI-S ≥4 (moderately ill), on at least 2 days within a 1-week 
period. 
OR 
Criteria  3  a)  PANSS  score  of  ≥5  (moderately  severe)  on  2  items  of  “unusual  thought  content”  (Item 
23),  “conceptual  disorganization”  (Item  2),  or  “hallucinatory  behavior”  (Item  3)  and  b)  CGI-S  ≥4 
(moderately ill), on at least 2 days within a 1-week period

OR 
Criteria 4: In the opinion of the investigator, the subject’s symptoms of schizophrenia had deteriorated 
to such an extent or the risk of violence to self or others or suicide had increased so that 1 or more 
of the following measures was necessary or had occurred: 
•  Required at least an additional 2 mg or greater lorazepam (or equivalent) per day as compared 
to the highest open-label dose of the monotherapy phase; 
•  Addition of open-label antipsychotic medication or mood stabilizers; 
•  Addition or increase in the dose of antidepressant medication; 
• 
Increase in the level of psychiatric care (eg, supervised living, day hospital care); 
•  Hospitalization or increase in the level of hospitalization; 
•  An arrest or imprisonment for objectionable behavior; 
•  Electroconvulsive therapy; 
•  Other. 
Secondary  endpoint  was  defined  as  time  to  early  discontinuation  for  any  reason.  Main  secondary 
efficacy measures included:proportion of subjects in each treatment arm having experienced a relapse 
or impending relapse; having discontinued the study prematurely; change from baseline to the double-
blind treatment phase (Period 3) on the PANSS total score, the PANSS Marder factor scores (positive, 
negative,  disorganized  thought,  hostility/excitement,  anxiety/depression),  CGI-S,  Clinical  Global 
Impression  of  Improvement  (CGI-I),  the  Calgary  Depression  Scale  in  Schizophrenia  (CDS),  the 
modified  InterSePT  Scale  for  Suicidal  Thinking  (ISST  Modified),  the  Global  Cognitive  Function  Scale 
(CogFu),  and  cognitive function  as  assessed  with  a  computerized  cognitive  battery  (CNS Vital  Signs), 
change  during  open-label  treatment  (Periods  1  and  2)  in  Personal  Evaluation  of  Transitions  in 
Treatment (PETiT) total and subscale scores was evaluated. 
Statistical Methods 
Descriptive statistics using Kaplan-Meier survival curves were performed to estimate the probability of 
remaining free of relapse or impending relapse on asenapine compared with placebo. The log-rank test 
was used to test the hypothesis that there was no difference in relapse rates between asenapine and 
placebo. The same methods, Kaplan-Meier estimation and log-rank testing, were used to assess time 
to early discontinuation for any reason.  
The Type I error was controlled at 0.05 for the study.  
2.4.5.3.2.2.  Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 700 subjects received at least one dose of trial medication in the open-label phase of the trial. 
Of these, 386 subjects were randomized into the double-blind phase of the trial, 194 to asenapine and 
192 to placebo, and 314 were not randomized and did not participate in the double-blind phase of the 
trial. 
Baseline data 
A  total  of  207  subjects  completed  the  double-blind  phase  of  the  trial.  The  percentage  of  subjects 
completing  the  double-blind  phase  was  69.6%  in  the  asenapine  group  (69.6%)  compared  with  the 
placebo group (37.5%). A total of 114 subjects relapsed with a lower percentage of subjects relapsing 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583011/2010

in  the  asenapine  group  (12.4%)  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (46.9%).  Most  of  the  relapsed 
subjects in both groups (21/24 relapsed asenapine subjects and 64/90 relapsed placebo subjects) were 
considered relapsed because their symptoms deteriorated and/or intervention was necessary.  
Overall,  within  the  all-subjects-Treated  group,  most  subjects  were  Caucasian  (67.3%).  Subjects 
ranged  in  age  from  18  to  78  years  with  an  overall  mean  (SD)  age  of  39.4  (12.07)  years.  A  majority 
(59.4%) of subjects were male. Subjects’ BMI ranged from 17 to 65 kg/m2, with a mean (SD) BMI of 
27.0  (6.38)  kg/m2.  The  percentage  of  Caucasian  subjects  was  higher  among  randomized  subjects 
(72.8%)  compared  with  non-randomized  subjects  (60.5%)  and  the  percentage  of  Black  subjects  was 
lower among randomized subjects (10.4%) compared with non-randomized subjects (19.1%). 
Additionally,  within  the  group  of  subjects  who  were  randomized  to  double-blind  treatment,  with  the 
exception  of  gender,  there  were  no  notable  differences  between  the  asenapine  and  placebo  groups 
with  respect  to  demographic  characteristics.  The  percentage  of  female  subjects  was  higher  in  the 
asenapine group (45.9%) than in the placebo group (39.6%).  
The mean daily dose of asenapine was 16.7 mg during the open-label period and 17.6 mg during the 
double-blind  period.  The  daily  modal  dose  of  asenapine  during  both  the  open-label  period  and  the 
double-blind period was 20 mg. 
Outcomes 
Based on a log-rank test, there was a statistically significant difference in favor of asenapine between 
the treatment groups with respect to the time to relapse or impending relapse (p<0.0001). The time to 
relapse was longer in the asenapine group compared with the placebo group (see figure 5).

Asenapine  was  also  shown  to  be  more  effective  than  placebo  in  prolonging  the  time  to  early 
termination for any reason and the time to relapse or impending relapse.  
2.4.5.3.3.  Studies 25543 and 25544 
2.4.5.3.3.1.  Methods 
Study participants  
Main inclusion criteria 
In  study  25543,  male  or  female  (females  had  to  be  non-lactating  and  non-pregnant,  or  not  of 
childbearing potential) of at least 18 years of age and a current diagnosis of schizophrenia of paranoid 
(295.30),  disorganized  (295.10),  catatonic  (295.20),  residual  (295.60),  or  undifferentiated  (295.90) 
subtype (the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview [MINI] will be used). Subjects were to have 
a minimum PANSS negative subscale score of 20 at screening and baseline, with a minimum score of 4 
(moderate) on at least 3 of the Marder factors for negative symptoms (blunted affect [N1], emotional 
withdrawal  [N2],  poor  rapport  [N3],  passive  social  withdrawal  [N4],  lack  of  spontaneity  [N6],  motor 
retardation [G7], active social avoidance [G16]), a PANSS positive subscale (Marder factor) score <the 
PANSS  negative  subscale  (Marder  factor)  score  at  screening  and  baseline;  and  demonstrated  clinical 
stability for the past 5 months at time of screening (defined as: no significant changes in schizophrenia 
symptomatology,  no  hospitalizations/  increase  level  of  care/jailing  or  imprisonment  due  to  worsening 
of  the symptoms of schizophrenia during the past 5 months). 
In study 25544, subjects who completed study 25543 and received double-blind therapy. 
Treatments  
In  study  25543,  subjects  received  the  initial  dose of  either  5  mg  BID  asenapine  or  10  mg  once  daily 
(QD)  olanzapine  as  the  active  dose  matched  with  the  comparator  placebo  for  1  week.  After  1  week, 
doses  could  be  increased,  decreased,  or  held  constant  at  the  discretion  of  the  investigator  only. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583011/2010  
Page 49/88
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Decisions  to  change  the  dose  were  to  be  made  at  the  subject’s  visit,  and  based  on  the  subject’s 
symptomotology  and  tolerability.  Dose  changes  could  only  be  made  between  visits  if  intolerable 
adverse events (AEs) prohibit a delay. 
In  study  25544,  subjects  continued  in  their  original  treatment  group—asenapine  (5-  10  mg  BID)  or 
olanzapine (5-20 mg QD)—at the dose received at the end of the treatment visit in study 25543 for the 
first  week.  After  the  first  week,  decisions  to  change  doses  were  made  at  subject  visits  based  on 
symptomatology and tolerability. (If intolerable adverse events prohibited a delay, dose changes could 
be made between visits.) The 26-week extension trial continued until all subjects completed treatment 
or discontinued early. 
Outcomes/endpoints  
The  primary  efficacy  measures  were  the  mean  changes  from  baseline  to  day  182  (study  25543)  and 
day  365  (study  25544)  on  Negative  Symptoms  Assessment  (NSA)  score,  a  16  item  clinician  rating 
scale on negative symptomatology of schizophrenia. 
The key secondary endpoints were the mean changes from baseline to day 182 (study 25543) and day 
365  (study  25544)  on  QLS  total  score,  a  21-item,  clinician  rating  scale  on  psychosocial  functioning. 
Other secondary efficacy measures were : PANSS, CDSS, CNS vital signs, PETiT, LOF, and Q-LES-Q as 
well as CGI-S, CGI-I, CGI-I responders (defined as “very much improved” and “much improved”) and 
time to first CGI-I response. 
Statistical Methods 
Primary  and  key  secondary  endpoints  were  analysed  using  MMRM  method.  All  statistical  tests  were 
two-sided with a = 0.05 significance level.  
Additionally, two separate sensitivity analyses were performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
on  the  changes  from  baseline  in  NSA  total  score,  in  QLS  score  at  each  visit  with  baseline  NSA  total 
score, QLS score and duration of predominant, persistent negative symptoms as covariates. In the first 
analysis, the missing data were imputed by LOCF method. In the second analysis, only the OC method 
was used. 
The differences between asenapine with olanzapine on PANSS, CDSS, and CGI-S were analyzed using 
a  MMRM  analysis,  and  were  further  examined  with  LOCF  and  OC  approaches.  The  other  secondary 
endpoints,  CNS  vital  signs,  PETiT,  LOF,  and  Q-LES-Q,  were  analyzed  using  LOCF  and  OC.  Descriptive 
statistics were produced for CGI. The treatment groups were compared with respect to CGI responder 
rates using Cochran Mantel-Haentzel test. Both treatment groups were compared with respect to time 
to first CGI response using Kaplan-Meier product limit method and the Cox's proportional hazard model. 
Analyses were stratified by duration of persistent negative symptoms (2 year duration strata). 
2.4.5.3.3.2.  Results 
Participant flow 
In  study  25543,  a  total  of  481  subjects  were  randomly  assigned  to  treatment  (241  subjects  were 
assigned to asenapine and 240 subjects were assigned to olanzapine) and received at least 1 dose of 
double-blind trial medication. A total of 433 subjects (90.0% of those randomly assigned to treatment) 
received at least 1 dose of double-blind trial medication and had a least 1 post-baseline NSA evaluation 
(216 and 217 subjects in the asenapine and olanzapine groups, respectively).

In  study  25544,  a  total  of  306  subjects  received  at  least  1  dose  of  double-blind  trial  medication  in 
25544, including 134 subjects in the asenapine group and 172 subjects in the olanzapine group. A total 
of  279  subjects  received  at  least  1  dose  of  double-blind  trial  medication  and  had  a  least  1  post-
baseline  NSA  evaluation  in  25544,  including  122  and  157  subjects  in  the  asenapine  and  olanzapine 
groups, respectively. A total of 266 (86.9%) subjects completed the trial (113 asenapine [84.3%]; 153 
olanzapine [89.0%]).  
Baseline data 
In  study  25543,  the  most  common  reason  for  withdrawal  was  due  to  adverse  events/SAEs  in  the 
asenapine  treatment  group  (36  asenapine  [14.9%]  subjects  versus  18  olanzapine  [7.5%]  subjects). 
The 481 subjects participating in the trial had a mean age of 40.5 years (range 18 to 73 years). Most 
subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  were  in  the  18-64  years  age  category;  there  were  10  (4.1%) 
subjects in the asenapine group and 5 (2.1%) subject in the olanzapine group who were ≥65 years old. 
Overall, there were 153 (31.8%) females and 328 (68.2%) males. Mean weight was 79.8 kg (range 43 
to 140 kg) and mean BMI was 26.7 kg/m2 (range 16 to 44 kg/m2). Over the course of the entire trial, 
the median total daily asenapine dose was 15 mg, and the modal total daily asenapine dose was 20mg. 
The median total daily olanzapine dose was 11 mg, and the modal total daily olanzapine dose was 10 
mg. 
In study 25544, the asenapine treatment group, the most common reason for discontinuation was due 
to  adverse  events  in  the  asenapine  treatment  group  (10  asenapine  [7.5%]  subjects  versus  7 
olanzapine  [4.1%]  subjects).The  306  subjects  participating  in  the  extension  trial  25544  had  a  mean 
age of 40.4 years (range 18 to 71 years). Most subjects in both treatment groups were in the 18- 64 
years age category; there were 3 (2.2%) subjects in the asenapine group and 4 (2.3%) subjects in the 
olanzapine group who were ≥65 years old. Overall, there were 96 (31.4%) females and 210 (68.6%) 
males. Mean weight was 81.0 kg (range 45.4 to 137.5 kg) and mean BMI was 27.2 kg/m2 (range 16.5 
to 44.6 kg/m2). Over the course of the entire trial, the median total daily asenapine dose was 20 mg, 
and the modal total daily asenapine dose was 20 mg. The median total daily olanzapine dose was 10 
mg, and the modal total daily olanzapine dose was 10 mg. 
Outcome 
In  study  25543,    asenapine  (5  mg-10  mg  BID)  was not  significantly  different  from  olanzapine  (5mg-
20mg QD) on the primary efficacy and key secondary endpoints,  changes from baseline to Day 182  in 
NSA total score (p = 0.7869) and in QLS total score (p = 0.9298). 
In  study  25544,  asenapine  (5  mg-10  mg  BID)  was  not  significantly  different  from  olanzapine  (5mg-
20mg QD) on the primary efficacy and key secondary endpoints, changes from baseline to Day 365  in 
NSA total score (p = 0.2344) and in QLS total score (p=0.2838). 
In both studies, mean change from baseline over time on the NSA total score was comparable between 
the two groups. The results of the primary analysis, using MMRM, were corroborated by the LOCF and 
OC analyses. Secondary analyses, such as the NSA global scores, QLS total score, PANSS total score, 
CGI-S scores and CGI-I response rates showed no differences between asenapine and olanzapine.

 Discussion on clinical efficacy 
2.4.5.4.1. 
 Short term studies 
With respect to phase II short-term trials (041002, 041013 and 041004), no dose response could be 
established.  Six  doses  were  tested  across  the  three  trials.  In  trials  041002  and  041013,  the  trend 
favoured  0.4mg  over  0.8mg,  and  1.6mg  over  2.4mg,  respectively.    Only  1  out  of  6  comparisons  
achieved statistical significance (asenapine 5 mg BID in trial 041004) but no other doses were tested 
in this trial to allow the dose response to be assessed.  
The concern over dose response extended into phase III as trials (041023 and 041021) did not provide 
any evidence that the 10mg dose provided additional benefit compared to 5mg, with the trend in both 
studies  favouring  5mg,  and  the  10mg  dose  never  achieving  statistically  significant  superiority  over 
placebo. A major concern over the proposed posology (using 10 mg dose in addition to 5mg) and lack 
of evidence of efficacy of asenapine 10 mg BID was raised by the CHMP.  
After  the  positive  finding  for  the  5mg  dose  in  study  041004,  three  confirmatory  phase  III  short-term 
trials (041021, 041022 and 041023) were conducted. The CHMP considered that there was insufficient 
evidence of efficacy as only 1 out of 5 comparisons to placebo achieved statistical significance ( the 5 
mg arm in study 041023) and the size of the effect of the estimated benefit was considered not to be 
of clinical significance . The CHMP was also concerned whether the analysis was robust to the method 
used  to  impute  missing  data  (LOCF  and  MMRM),  in  view  of  the  high  proportion  of  withdrawal  before 
week 6. 
To  address  the  major  concern  over  insufficient  evidence  of  efficacy,  the  applicant  claimed  that  study 
041004  also  provided  primary  data  in  support  of  the  efficacy  of  asenapine  in  the  acute  treatment  of 
schizophrenia on the basis of the following reasons: 
- 
This study met the criteria for quality of design and conduct of a well-designed proof of efficacy 
study as per EMA guidance1, and as such provided robust evidence of the efficacy of asenapine 
in the treatment of schizophrenia, in the effective dose range of 5-10 mg BID. 
- 
The strength of the positive primary endpoint analysis results for the 041004 and 041023 trials 
is supported by tests of robustness for the primary analysis. 
- 
The  efficacy  of  asenapine  in  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  is  also  supported  by  numerous 
results  of  the  short  term  trials,  when  analyzing  secondary  efficacy  endpoints,  as  specified  in 
the respective study protocols. 
-  A meta-analysis of the short-term trials (041004,041021,041022 and 041023) clearly showed 
that asenapine was superior to placebo and had a comparable effect size to the active controls 
in the studies. 
- 
The  overall  success  rate  of  the  program  with  respect  to  the  number  of  positive  trials  versus 
negative/failed trials is consistent with the results of the initial development program of some 
of the more recently approved antipsychotics. 
- 
The  phase  III  relapse  prevention  trial  A7501012  provided  robust  evidence  of  the  efficacy  of 
asenapine 5-10 mg BID in the long term treatment of schizophrenia. 
-  An  additional  analysis  using  baseline  observation  carried  forward  (BOCF)  provided  generally 
similar results to those seen before and provided reassurance that the study conclusions were 
robust to the method used for handling missing data.

In  the  CHMP  view,  the  above  claims  were  not  addressing  the  major  concern  over  the  insufficient 
evidence  of  efficacy  observed  in  the  phase  III  studies  (041021,041022  and  041023)  in  the  acute 
treatment of schizophrenia. Particularly, the CHMP was of the opinion that: 
-  Study  041004  could  not  be  regarded  as  pivotal  study,  although  it  was  supportive  of  the 
efficacy of asenapine. This study generated the hypothesis that the 5mg dose was efficacious, 
and  the  phase  III  studies  alone  needed  to  be  convincing  in  confirming  that  hypothesis. 
Furthermore,  the  sample size  of  this  study  was  modest  (n=58  for  asenapine)  and  there  were  
considerable drop outs (n= 32 for asenapine). A new meta analysis (excluding study 041004) 
should therefore be provided to further substantiate the short term efficacy of asenapine. 
- 
In  the  absence  of  a  demonstration  of  a  benefit  of  short-term  treatment,  the  long-term 
randomised withdrawal trial cannot be considered to provide evidence of efficacy.  
- 
The  clinical  significance  of  difference  from  placebo  in  mean  total  PANSS  score  and  of  the 
difference from placebo in the response rates should be further substantiated. 
As  requested  by  the  CHMP,  the  applicant  performed  a  new  meta-analysis  (excluding  study  041004). 
Also at the CHMP request, the responder analysis was conducted using missing= failure. Results from 
this retrospective meta-analysis was suggestive of efficacy (for PANSS total score: 2.7  points greater 
for asenapine versus placebo (p=0.021; 95% CI -5.0 to -0.4); for responder rates (missing=failure): 
OR=1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.1; p=0.011). However, the pooled 95% CI was very close to zero and this 
finding raised some concern over the level of evidence from this meta-analysis, taking into account the 
CPMP  point 
to  consider  on  application  with  1.  Meta  analyses  2.  One  pivotal  study 
(CPMP/EWP/2330/99). 
To support the significance of difference from placebo in mean total PANSS score, the applicant 
claimed the following: 
- 
treatment effect as measured by the primary efficacy endpoint in the asenapine clinical 
program was very similar for asenapine compared with the pooled data for the active controls 
used i.e risperidone, olanzapine and haloperidol used at approved dosages (comparators: -4.1 
PANSS Total score points on the primary endpoint; 95% CI -6.5 to -1.7; p=0.0010; asenapine: 
- 
-3.7 points 95% CI -5.9 to -1.5, p=0.0011). 
a literature review (Leucht et al., 20091) on 53 randomised clinical trials ( a total 117 relevant 
treatment arms and 14,861 patients) showed that the effect of asenapine is comparable to that 
of the broad class of second generation antipsychotics. 
-  Results from responder analysis (clinically relevant response as defined as 30% reduction of 
the individual baseline PANSS total score) are supportive of the observed point estimate of 
PANSS Total Score change from baseline in the pooled phase III studies 
The CHMP noted the comparative data presented by the applicant to support the clinical relevance of 
the  efficacy  results  for  asenapine.  Based  on  the  available  published  data  on  aripiprazole  and 
paliperidone,  the  CHMP  noted  that  difference  from  placebo  could  range  from  7  to  19  points  on  the 
PANSS  score.  These  results  appeared  substantially  greater  than  the  treatment  effect  observed  with 
asenapine,  further  questioning  the  magnitude  of  the  effect  observed  for  asenapine  and  its  clinical 
relevance. In conclusion, mean treatment difference from placebo of 2.7 (or 3.7 points if the phase 2 
study 004 is included) from a baseline score of about 90  appeared to be very modest and its clinical 
significance is still questioned by the CHMP.

2.4.5.4.2. 
 Long term studies 
In  study  A7501012  ,  which  used  a  randomised  responder  design,  there  was  a  statistically  significant 
difference in favor of asenapine between the treatment groups with respect to the time to relapse or 
impending relapse (p<0.0001). The time to relapse was longer in the asenapine group compared with 
the placebo group. Asenapine was also shown to be more effective than placebo in prolonging the time 
to  early  termination  for  any  reason  and  the  time  to  relapse  or  impending  relapse.  However  in  the 
absence  of  adequate  evidence  of  efficacy  from  short-term  trials,  a  randomised-responder  relapse 
prevention trial cannot provide meaningful evidence of efficacy.  
In study 25517, statistically significant difference (6.5 points, 95% CI 3.9, 9.2, p<0.0001) in the mean 
change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  (LOCF)  in  the  PANSS  total  score  was  observed  in  favour  of 
olanzapine. The CHMP raised a major concern in this regard. The applicant argued that the difference 
across  groups  was  driven  primarily  by  a  difference  in  rates  of  discontinuation,  similarly  to  what  has 
been observed in the CATIE trial1. Overall, the CHMP was not reassured. In fact the differences in the 
withdrawal rate presented a concern (as the withdrawals were mainly due to lack of efficacy). As this 
study  showed  inferiority  to  olanzapine,  and  did  not  contain  any  other  comparison  to  provide  positive 
evidence, it was concluded that this study did not provide evidence of efficacy for asenapine. 
2.4.5.5. 
 Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP concluded the following:  
- There is insufficient evidence of efficacy from short term trials.  
- The magnitude of the claimed efficacy is of doubtful clinical significance. 
-  In  the  absence  of  adequate  evidence  of  efficacy  from  short  term  trials,  the  randomised  responder 
relapse prevention trial cannot provide meaningful evidence of efficacy. 
- The long term comparison to olanzapine did not provide evidence of efficacy.

2.4.5.7.1. 
 Methods 
Study design 
The two main phase III short-term studies were designed as follows: 
-  A7501004  and  A7501005:      3-week  randomised,  double  blind  placebo–controlled  and  active  –
controlled (3 treatment groups: asenapine 5-10mg BID, olanzapine 5-20 mg QD, or placebo in 2:2:1 
ratio) studies in subjects with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder;  
These  studies  were  conducted  in  Bulgaria  and  Romania  and  outside  EU  (US,  India,  Asia,  Russia, 
Ukraine and Turkey). 
Patients who completed studies A7501004 and A7501005 were eligible to enter 9 week extension 
study A7501006 (see 3.4.9.3. Long term studies). 
The design of these studies and their extension study A7501006 is presented in Figure 6. 
Figure 6 
Study participants  
Main inclusion criteria 
Subjects  had  a  primary  diagnosis  of  bipolar  I  disorder,  current  episode  manic  (DSM-IV  296.4x)  or 
mixed  (DSM-IV  296.6x).  Subjects  were  men  or  women  of  at  least  18  years  of  age  with  documented 
history  of  at  least  one  previous  moderate-to-severe  mood  episode  with  or  without  psychotic  features 
(manic or mixed). Subjects were to have a Young-Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) score ≥20 at screening

and at baseline, and have a current manic or mixed bipolar I episode that must have begun no more 
than 3 months prior to the screening visit. 
Main exclusion criteria 
Main exclusion criteria included the presence of an uncontrolled, unstable clinically significant medical 
condition  that  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator  could  interfere  with  the  interpretation  of  safety  and 
efficacy  evaluations;  a  seizure  disorder  beyond  childhood  or  the  use  of  anticonvulsants  to  prevent 
seizures;  any  clinically  significant  abnormal  laboratory,  vital  sign,  physical  examination,  or  ECG 
findings  at  screening  that  precluded  trial  participation;  subjects    unable  to  reduce  his/her  daily 
benzodiazepine intake to a maximum of 4 mg per day of lorazepam (or the equivalent dose of another 
short-acting  benzodiazepine);  subjects  having  lithium  level  greater  than  0.6  mEq/L,  a  valproate  level 
greater  than  50  μg/mL,  or  a  carbamazepine  level  greater  than  4  μg  /mL  prior  to  baseline,  or  have 
taken lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine within 3 days of baseline; a history of substance abuse or 
dependence  (excluding  nicotine)  according  to  DSM-IV  criteria  within  6  months  before  screening; 
subjects having narrow angle glaucoma;  subjects having seizure disorder or taking anticonvulsivants; 
a history of rapid cycling. Subjects previously treated in an asenapine trial, taking clozapine within the 
last 12 weeks and subjects at imminent risk of self-harm or harm to others were also excluded. 
Treatments  
There  was  a  single-blind  placebo  washout  period  up  to  7  days  followed  by  double-blind,  randomized 
period of 21 days. 
After week 3, patients were given the option to continue into the extension study (A7501006).  
Outcomes/endpoints  
The primary efficacy measure was the mean change from baseline to Day 21 on the Y-MRS total score. 
Main secondary efficacy measures were the mean change from baseline in Y-MRS total score (all time 
points);  Y-MRS  responders  (defined  as  a  50%  decrease  from  baseline  in  Y-MRS  score  at  any  given 
visit); Y-MRS remitters (defined as a Y-MRS total score of 12 or lower at any given visit); change from 
baseline in CGI-BP severity in mania. 
Statistical Methods  
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  analyzed  by  a  fixed-effects  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA).  The 
primary  model  used  the  baseline  score  as  a  covariate.  Comparisons  between  treatment  groups  were 
made  using  the  difference  in  the  model  based  least  square  means.  No  adjustment  was  made  for 
multiple  comparisons  since  the  olanzapine  versus  placebo  comparison  was  made  for  assessing 
sensitivity  only.  The  robustness  of  the  results  against  potential  bias  caused  by  missing  data  was 
checked by 2 methods: 1) an OC analysis, and 2) a MMRM analysis. 
2.4.5.7.1.1.  Results 
Participant flow 
In  study  A7501004,  a  total  of  611  subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  trial,  of  whom  488  subjects  were 
randomized and took at least 1 dose of trial medication: 98 subjects (placebo),185 subjects (asenapine 
5-10  mg  BID)  and  205  subjects  (olanzapine  5-20  mg  once  daily  QD).    A  total  of  342  subjects 
completed  the  trial  (124  asenapine  [67.0%];  161  olanzapine  [78.5%];  and  57  placebo  [58.2%]). 
There were 17 (9.2%) asenapine-treated subjects, 7 (3.4%) olanzapine-treated subjects, and 4 (4.1%) 
CHMP assessment report

placebo-treated  subjects  who  withdrew  due  to  an  adverse  event/SAE.  Of  these  6  (3.2%)  asenapine-
treated  subjects,  2  (1.0%)  olanzapine-treated  subjects,  and  4  (4.1%)  placebo-treated  subjects  who 
withdrew due to an adverse event/SAE related to bipolar I disorder. 
A total of 76 subjects, including 30 from the asenapine group, 12 from the placebo group, and 34 from 
the  olanzapine  group,  who  completed  the  trial,  did  not  continue  into  the  extension  trial  (A7501006). 
The most frequent reason for not continuing into the extension trial was withdrawal of consent (23 of 
the 30 subjects from the asenapine group, 11 of the 12 subjects from the placebo group, and 29 of the 
34  subjects  in  the  olanzapine  group).  There  were  14  (7.6%)  asenapine-treated  subjects,  13  (6.3%) 
olanzapine-treated  subjects,  and  14  (14.3%)  placebo-treated  subjects  who  withdrew  due  to  lack  of 
efficacy.  There  were  25  (13.5%)  asenapine-treated  subjects,  15  (7.3%)  olanzapine-treated  subjects, 
and 13 (13.3%) placebo-treated subjects for whom the reason for withdrawal was withdrawn consent. 
In  study  A7501005,  a  total  of  654  subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  trial,  of  whom  489  subjects  were 
randomized  and  488  took  at  least  1  dose  of  trial  medication:  104  subjects  (placebo),  194  subjects 
(asenapine 5-10 mg BID) and 190 subjects (olanzapine 5-20 mg once daily QD).A total of 338 subjects 
completed  the  trial  (122  asenapine  [62.9%];  152  olanzapine  [79.6%];  and  64  placebo  [61.5%]). 
There  were  20  (10.3%)  asenapine-treated  subjects,  8  (4.2%)  olanzapine-treated  subjects,  and  7 
(6.7%)  placebo-treated  subjects  who  withdrew  due  to  an  adverse  event/SAE.  Of  these,  11  (5.7%) 
asenapine-treated  subjects,  2  (1.0%)  olanzapine-treated  subjects,  and  5  (4.8%)  placebo-treated 
subjects who withdrew due to an adverse event/SAE related to bipolar I disorder. 
A  total  of  100  subjects,  including  35  from  the  asenapine  group,  15  from  the  placebo  group,  and  50 
from  the  olanzapine  group,  who  completed  the  trial,  did  not  continue  into  the  extension  trial 
(A7501006).  The  most  frequent  reason  for  not  continuing  into  the  extension  trial  was  withdrawal  of 
consent  (25  of  the  35  subjects  from  the  asenapine  group,  13  of  the  15  subjects  from  the  placebo 
group,  and  38  of  the  50  subjects  in  the  olanzapine  group).  There  were  16  (8.2%)  asenapine-treated 
subjects,  11  (5.8%)  olanzapine-treated  subjects,  and  17  (16.3%)  placebo-treated  subjects  who 
withdrew  due  to  lack  of  efficacy.  There  were  28  (14.4%)  asenapine-treated  subjects,  16  (8.4%) 
olanzapine-treated  subjects,  and  13  (12.5%)  placebo-treated  subjects  for  whom  the  reason  for 
withdrawal was withdrawn consent. 
Baseline data 
In study A7501004, subjects had a mean age of 38.6 years. Overall, there were 231 (47.3%) females 
and 257 (52.7%) males. Mean weight was 77.2 kg and mean BMI was 26.9 kg/m2. The proportion of 
male subjects was higher in the olanzapine group (57.1%) than in the asenapine (49.7%) or placebo 
(49.0%)  groups.  Overall,  68.9%  of  subjects  had  a  diagnosis  of  a  manic  episode  and  31.1%  had  a 
diagnosis of a mixed episode. The mean total daily dose for asenapine was 18.2 mg/day for asenapine 
and 15.9 mg/day for olanzapine. The most commonly used concomitant medications in all 3 treatment 
groups were psycholeptics (65.4%asenapine, 67.3% olanzapine, and 70.4% placebo). 
In study A7501005, subjects had a mean age of 39.4 years. Overall, there were 42.6% (208) women 
and  57.4%  (280)  men.  Mean  weight  was  78.6  kg    and  mean  BMI  was  27.0  kg/m2.The  proportion  of 
male  subjects  was  higher  in  the  olanzapine  (60.0%)  and  asenapine  groups  (58.8%)  than  in  the 
placebo  (50.0%)  groups.  Overall,  69.3%  of  had  a  diagnosis  of  a  manic  episode  and  30.7%  had  a 
diagnosis of a mixed episode.  The mean total daily dose for asenapine was 18.2 mg/day for asenapine 
and 15.8 mg/day for olanzapine. Overall, 84.5% of asenapine subjects, 77.9% of olanzapine subjects, 
and 83.7% of placebo subjects reported the use of concomitant medications during the trial. The most 
commonly  used  concomitant  medications  in  all  3  treatment  groups  were  psycholeptics  (67.0% 
asenapine, 60.5% olanzapine, and 69.2% placebo).

Outcome 
In  study  A7501004,  Y-MRS  total  scores  were  statistically  significantly  improved  in  the  asenapine  and 
olanzapine  treatment  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  treatment  group  (p=0.0065  for  asenapine 
versus placebo and p<0.0001 for olanzapine versus placebo). The mean change from baseline to Day 
21  was  -11.5,  -7.8,  and  -14.6  for  the  asenapine,  placebo,  and  olanzapine  treatment  groups, 
respectively.  Mean  changes  from  baseline    in  the  CGI-BP,  severity  of  mania  also  showed  statistically 
significant improvements in the asenapine group over placebo at Day 21.  
At  Day  21,  42.6%  of  subjects  in  the  asenapine  group  were  responders  compared  with  34.0%  in  the 
placebo  group.  However,  this  treatment  difference  was  not  statistically  significant  (p=0.1951).  A 
statistically  significant  greater  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  olanzapine  group  were  responders 
compared with the placebo group (p=0.0011) at day 21. 
At  Day  21,  35.5%  of  subjects  in  the  asenapine  group  were  remitters  compared  with  30.9%  in  the 
placebo  group.  However,  this  treatment  difference  was  not  statistically  significant  (p=0.5033).A 
statistically significant greater percentage of subjects in the olanzapine group were remitters compared 
with the placebo group at Day 21 (p=0.0159). 
In  study  A7501005,  Y-MRS  total  scores  were  statistically  significantly  improved  in  the  asenapine  and 
olanzapine  treatment  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  treatment  group  (p<0.0001  for  both 
comparisons with placebo). The mean change from baseline to Day 21 was -10.8, -5.5, and -12.6 for 
the  asenapine,  placebo,  and  olanzapine  treatment  groups,  respectively.  Mean  changes  from  baseline  
in  the  CGI-BP,  severity  of  mania  also  showed  statistically  significant  improvements  in  the  asenapine 
group over placebo at Day 21. 
At  Day  21,  42.3%  of  subjects  in  the  asenapine  group  were  responders  compared  with  25.2%  in  the 
placebo  group.  This  treatment  difference  was  statistically  significant  (p=0.0049).  A  statistically 
significant greater percentage of subjects in the olanzapine group were responders compared with the 
placebo at day 21(p<0.0001). 
At  Day  21,  40.2%  of  subjects  in  the  asenapine  group  were  remitters  compared  with  22.3%in  the 
placebo  group.  This  treatment  difference  was  statistically  significant  (p=0.0020).  A  statistically 
significant  greater  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  olanzapine  group  were  remitters  compared  with  the 
placebo group at Day 21 (p=0.0041). 
2.4.5.8.  Long term studies 
The main long-term studies were designed as follows: 
-  A7501006:    a  9-week,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo  and  active-controlled  (3  treatment 
groups:  asenapine  5-10  mg  BID  or  olanzapine  5-20  mg  QD,  placebo/asenapine  in  3:1  ratio) 
study in subjects with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder; 
-  A7501008  (add  on  therapy):  a  12-week,randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  (2 
treatment groups: asenapine 5-10 mg BID or placebo in 3:1 ratio) study in subjects with manic 
or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder; 
Study  A7501006  was  conducted  in  Bulgaria  and  Romania  and  outside  EU  (US,  India,  Asia,  Russia, 
Ukraine and Turkey). Study A751008 was performed in Czech Republic and outside EU (US, Australia, 
India, Asia and Russia).

Patients who completed studies  A7501006 and A7501008 were eligible to enter a 40 week extension 
studies  A7501007  A7501009,  respectively  and  primarily aimed  to  provide  additional  long  term  safety 
data (see 3.4.6. Clinical Safety). 
2.4.5.8.1.  Study A7501006 
2.4.5.8.1.1.  Methods 
Study design 
This  was  a  9-week,  olanzapine-controlled,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  multicenter,  parallel  group, 
continuation trial.  
Study participants  
Main inclusion criteria 
Subjects  had  a  primary  diagnosis  of  bipolar  I  disorder.  Subjects  were  to  have  completed  studies 
A7501004  or  A7501005  (so  called  “feeder  study”)  without  major  protocol  violations.  Subjects  were 
men or women of at least 18 years of age. Subjects were to be willing to discontinue all psychotropic 
medication during the treatment period except of those specified in the protocol. 
Treatments  
Those  subjects  treated  with  active,  double-blind  therapy  were  to  continue  in  their  original  treatment 
group  (asenapine  5-10  mg  twice  daily  [BID]  or  olanzapine  5-20  mg  once  daily  [QD]).  Subjects 
previously  receiving  placebo  were  blindly  allocated  to  receive  asenapine  (5-10  mg  BID),  and  these 
subjects were only included in the safety analyses (see Figure 6). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  change  from  baseline  to  Week  12  on  the  Young-Mania  Rating 
Scale (Y-MRS). 
Main secondary efficacy measures were the mean change from baseline in Y-MRS total score (all time 
points);  Y-MRS  responders  (defined  as  a  50%  decrease  from  baseline  in  Y-MRS  score  at  any  given 
visit); Y-MRS remitters (defined as a Y-MRS total score of 12 or lower at any given visit); change from 
baseline in CGI-BP severity in mania. 
Statistical Method 
For  the  primary  analysis,  non-inferiority  limit  was set  at  four  points  on  the  Y-MRS  scale.  An  ANCOVA 
with fixed effects for treatment and investigative site (or pooled site) and baseline Y-MRS scores as a 
covariate  was  used  to  test  the  hypothesis  of  non-inferiority  using  a  one-sided  α  =  0.025  significance 
level. Comparison between asenapine and olanzapine was based on the difference in the model based 
least square means . The robustness of the results against potential bias caused by missing data was 
checked by 2 methods: 1) an OC analysis, and 2) a MMRM analysis.

2.4.5.8.1.2.  Results 
Participant flow 
A  total  of  504  subjects,  94  who  had  received  placebo  in  the  feeder  study,  181  who  had  received 
asenapine in the feeder study, and 229 who had received olanzapine in the feeder study, received at 
least 1 dose of trial medication in this extension study. A total of 308 subjects completed the trial (112 
asenapine  [61.9%];  146  olanzapine  [63.8%];  and  50  placebo/asenapine  [53.2%]).  There  were  18 
(19.1%)  placebo/asenapine-treated  subjects,  24  (13.3%)  asenapine-treated  subjects,  22(9.6%) 
olanzapine-treated  subjects  who  withdrew  due  to  an  adverse  event/SAE.  Of  these  9  (9.6%) 
placebo/asenapine-treated subjects, 16 (8.8%) asenapine-treated subjects, and 11 (4.8%) olanzapine-
treated subjects who withdrew due to an adverse event/SAE related to bipolar I disorder. 
Baseline data 
Subjects  had  a  mean  age  of  39.5  years.  Mean  weight  was  76.3  kg  and  mean  BMI  was  26.7  kg/m2. 
Overall,  the  proportion  of  men  participating  in  the  study  (55.0%)  was  slightly  higher  than  the 
proportion of women (45.0%). 
For  asenapine  group,  72.4%  of  subjects  had  manic  episode  versus  72.5%  for  olanzapine  group  and 
27.6%  had  mixed  episode  for  asenapine  group  versus  27.5%  for  olanzapine  group.  In  the 
placebo/asenapine  group,  60.6%  of  subjects  had  a  manic  episode  and  39.4%  had  a  mixed  episode. 
The  mean  total  daily  dose  of  asenapine  was  16.1  mg/day  in  the  placebo/asenapine  group,  17.6 
mg/day  in the asenapine group and 16.1mg/day in the olanzapine group. Psycholeptics were the most 
commonly  used  concomitant  medications  in  the  asenapine  and  olanzapine  groups  (63.5%  asenapine 
and 59.8% olanzapine) 
Outcome 
The  mean  change  from  baseline  to  Day  84  for  the  asenapine  treatment  group  was  -27.3  while  the 
mean change from baseline to Day 84 was -23.7 for the olanzapine treatment group.  
At  Day  21,  60.7%  and  68.7%  of  subjects  in  the  asenapine  and  olanzapine  groups  were  responders, 
respectively.  At  Day  84,  89.5%  and  92.2%  of  subjects  in  the  asenapine  and  olanzapine  groups  were 
responders, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed between the percentage 
of  Y-MRS  responders  in  the  asenapine  treatment  group  and  the  olanzapine  treatment  group,  at  any 
time point. 
At  Day  21,  54.8%  and  55.3%  of  subjects  in  the  asenapine  and  olanzapine  groups  were  remitters, 
respectively.  At  Day  84,  88.4%  and  90.6%  of  subjects  in  the  asenapine  and  olanzapine  groups  were 
remitters, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed between the percentage of 
Y-MRS  remitters  in  the  asenapine  treatment  group  and  those  in  the  olanzapine  treatment  group,  at 
any time point. 
Both  the  asenapine  and  olanzapine  groups  demonstrated  improvement  on  the  CGI-BP  severity  of 
mania, with scores in the asenapine group decreasing from a mean of 4.7 (moderately to markedly ill) 
at  baseline  to  1.7  (normal  to  borderline  mentally  ill)  at  Day  84  and  scores  in  the  olanzapine  group 
decreasing from a mean of 4.6 at baseline to 1.8 at Day 84. The mean changes from baseline to Day 
84  were  -2.9  for  the  asenapine  treatment  group  and  -2.8  for  the  olanzapine  treatment  group.  The 
mean  change  from  baseline  to  Day  21  was  -1.9  for  both  the  asenapine  and  olanzapine  treatment 
groups.  No  statistically  significant  differences  were  observed  between  the  asenapine  treatment  group 
and the olanzapine treatment group for CGI-BP severity of mania.

2.4.5.8.2.  Study A7501008 
2.4.5.8.2.1.  Methods 
Study design 
This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial. The design of this study and 
its extension study A7501009 is presented in Figure 7. 
Figure 7 
Study participants  
Main inclusion criteria 
Subjects  had  a  primary  diagnosis  of  bipolar  I  disorder,  current  episode  manic  (DSM-IV  296.4x)  or 
mixed  (DSM-IV  296.6x).  Subjects  were  men  or  women  of  at  least  18  years  of  age  with  documented 
history  of  at  least  one  previous  moderate-to-severe  mood  episode  with  or  without  psychotic  features 
(manic or mixed). Subjects were to have a Young-Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) score ≥20 at screening 
and at baseline, have a current manic or mixed bipolar I episode that must have begun no more than 3 
months prior to the screening visit, and been continuously treated with lithium or valproate (VPA) for 
at  least  2  weeks  immediately  prior  to  screening.  Subjects  completing  the  trial  were  eligible  for 
enrollment in a 40-week, double-blinded extension trial, A7501009, regardless of the degree to which 
they  had  responded  to  study  medication  in  study  A7501008,  provided  they  met  the  inclusion  and 
exclusion criteria for the study A7501009.

Treatments  
On  Day  1,  subjects  received  5  mg  asenapine  BID  or  placebo  BID.  On  Days  2  through  84,  double-
blinded  asenapine  (or  placebo)  was  dosed  flexibly  (5  or  10  mg  BID),  based  on  efficacy,  safety,  and 
tolerability. All subjects continued open treatment with lithium or VPA for the duration of the trial. 
Treatment with lithium or VPA was continued throughout the course of the trial; that is, switching from 
one  mood  stabilizer  to  the  other  was  prohibited.  During  randomized  therapy,  mood  stabilizer  dose 
adjustments were made based on targeted trough serum levels (lithium [0.6-1.2 mEq/L] or valproate 
[50-125 mcg/mL]) obtained at the discretion of the investigator. An exception to this scenario was that 
dose reductions were permitted in the event of adverse events that in the investigator’s opinion were 
due to the mood stabilizer. That is, the mood stabilizer dose was reduced because of related adverse 
events  even  if  the  corresponding  plasma  level  was  in  the  therapeutic  range  and  the  resulting  new 
mood stabilizer plasma concentration fell into the sub-therapeutic range, so long as the adverse event 
attributed to the mood stabilizer resolved after this reduction was made. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  change  from  baseline,  LOCF,  to  Week  3  on  the  Y-MRS  total 
score. 
Main secondary efficacy measures were the mean change from baseline in Y-MRS total score (all time 
points);  Y-MRS  responders  (defined  as  a  50%  decrease  from  baseline  in  Y-MRS  score  at  any  given 
visit); Y-MRS remitters (defined as a Y-MRS total score of 12 or lower at any given visit); change from 
baseline in CGI-BP severity in mania. 
Statistical methods 
The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 3 in the Y-MRS LOCF score, for which the 
primary analysis was based upon the ITT data set: all subjects who were randomly assigned to therapy, 
who had at least 1 post-baseline Y MRS score, and who took at least 1 dose of study medication. This 
primary  analysis  compared  asenapine  with  placebo  using  a  fixed  effects  analysis  of  covariance 
(ANCOVA) with baseline Y-MRS scores and site as covariates.  
All  hypothesis  tests  comparing  the  treatment  groups  were  performed  using  a  2-tailed  0.05  level  of 
significance. The robustness of the results against potential bias caused by missing data was checked 
by 2 methods: 1) an OC analysis, and 2) a MMRM analysis. 
2.4.5.8.2.2.  Results 
Participant flow 
A  total  of  438  subjects  were  screened  for  participation  in  the  trial.  Of  these,  112  subjects  withdrew 
during  screening,  with  the  most  common  reason  for  withdrawal  during  screening  being  not  meeting 
entry  criteria  (81/112,  72.3%).  A  total  of  326  subjects  were  randomized  to  study  medication:  159 
subjects  to  asenapine,  and  167  subjects  to  placebo.  Of  these,  324  subjects  (158  asenapine;  166 
placebo) received at least 1 dose of study medication. 
A total of 116 subjects completed the trial (61 asenapine [38.4%] and 55 placebo [32.9%]).  A slightly 
higher percentage of asenapine-treated subjects (15.7%) withdrew due to an adverse event compared 
with  placebo-treated  subjects  (11.4%).  Similarly,  a  slightly  higher  percentage  of  asenapine-treated 
subjects  (11.3%)  withdrew  due  to  an  adverse  event  related  to  the  disease  under  study  (bipolar  I

disorder)  compared  with  placebo-  treated  subjects (9.6%).  The  percentage  of  subjects who  withdrew 
due to lack of efficacy was higher in the placebo group (16.2%) than in the asenapine group (8.2%). 
Baseline data 
The  324  adult  subjects  participating  in  the  trial  had  a  mean  age  of  39.3  years.  Most  subjects  in  all 
treatment groups were in the 18-64 years age category; there was 1 (0.6%) subject in the asenapine 
group and 2 (1.2%) subjects in the placebo group who were ≥65 years old. Overall, there were 42.3% 
(137)  females  and  57.7%  (187)  males.  Mean  weight  was  80.5  kg  and  mean  BMI  was  27.5  kg/m2 
(range 17 to 46 kg/m2). 
Overall, 61.1% of had a diagnosis of a manic episode and 38.9% had a diagnosis of a mixed episode; 
this  was  a  consistent  finding  across  treatment  groups.    The  mean  total  daily  dose  of  asenapine  was 
11.8 mg/day. 
A similar percentage of subjects in the asenapine group (80.4%) and the placebo group (81.9%) took 
concomitant medications, excluding lithium and VPA, during the study. Excluding lithium and VPA, the 
most  common  concomitant  medications  used  in  both  treatment  groups  were  lorazepam  (asenapine 
50.0%, placebo 50.6%), zolpidem (asenapine 29.7%, placebo 28.3%), paracetamol (asenapine 20.9%, 
placebo  19.9%),  ibuprofen  (asenapine  19.0%,  placebo  10.8%),  and  temazepam  (asenapine  9.5%, 
placebo 10.8%). 
Outcome 
Using  LOCF  method,  Y-MRS  total  scores  were  statistically  significantly  improved  in  the  asenapine 
treatment  group  compared  with  the  placebo  treatment  group  (p  =  0.0257).  The  mean  change  from 
baseline to Day 21 was -10.3 and -7.9 for the asenapine and placebo treatment groups, respectively.  
Using OC method, statistical analysis of the mean changes from baseline in the Y-MRS total scores did 
not  demonstrate  a  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  asenapine  and  placebo  groups  (p  = 
0.2279).  The  mean  change  from  baseline  to  Day  21  was  -13.0  and  -11.6  for  the  asenapine  and 
placebo  treatment  groups,  respectively.    In  addition,  using  MMRM  analysis,    change  from  baseline  to 
Day  21  in  Y-MRS  total  score  was  not  statistically  significantly  different  between  the  asenapine  and 
placebo group (p = 0.0991). 
At week 12, there was a mean change from baseline of -12.7 YMRS points for asenapine and -9.3  
Y-MRS points for placebo which was statistically significant (p =0.0073). 
Using LOCF method, the percentage of Y-MRS responders in the asenapine treatment was statistically 
significantly higher than in the placebo treatment group at Day 42 (p = 0.0370), Day 63 (p = 0.0488), 
and Day 84 (p = 0.0152), but not at Day 21 (p = 0.1634). Using the OC method, the percentage of 
responders  was  not  statistically  significantly  different  between  the  asenapine  and  placebo  treatment 
groups at any time point from Day 3 to Day 84. 
Using  LOCF  method,  the  percentage  of  Y-MRS  remitters  in  the  asenapine  treatment  group  was 
statistically significantly higher at Day 21 (p = 0.0158), Day 42  (p = 0.0143), Day 63 (p = 0.0196), 
and  Day  84  (p  =  0.0148).  Using  the  OC  method,  the  percentage  of  remitters  was  statistically 
significantly  different  between  the  asenapine  and  placebo  treatment  groups  only  at  Day  21  (p  = 
0.0227)

Using  the  LOCF  method,  improvements  in  CGI-BP  severity  of  mania  were  statistically  significantly 
greater  in  the  asenapine  treatment  group  compared  with  the  placebo  treatment  group  at  all  time 
points. The mean changes from baseline to Day 21 were - 1.1 in the asenapine group compared with -
0.8  in  the  placebo  group  and  the  mean  changes  from  baseline to  Day  84  were  -1.5  in  the  asenapine 
group  compared  with  -1.0  in  the  placebo  group.  Using  OC  method,  CGI-BP  severity  of  mania  results 
also revealed statistically significant improvements in the asenapine group compared with the placebo 
group  at  day  21  (p  =  0.0009).  The  difference  between  the  placebo  and  asenapine  groups  at  Day  84 
was not statistically significant (p = 0.0772).  
2.4.5.8.3.  Additional statistical analyses 
Additional  analysis  on  primary  endpoint  for  studies  A7501006  and  A7501008  were  performed  taking 
into account all randomised patients for study A7501006 (i.e including patients from studies A7501004 
and A7501005) and using BOCF analysis for study A7501008.  
Study A7501006 
Descriptive  statistics  for  the  change  from  baseline  of  the  Y-MRS  Total  scores  are  presented  for  the 
combined dataset in Table 12 by treatment and assessment.

Table 13 
Analysis of the observed change from baseline in the Y-MRS data at Day 21 as an indicator for drop-
out  at  Week  12  indicated  that  decreased  response  on  Y-MRS  at  Day  21  is  highly  predictive  of 
discontinuing  treatment:  for  each  one  point  increase  in  Y-MRS  point  at  Day  21,  the  odds  of 
discontinuing treatment before Week 12 increased by 12.8% (see Table 14). 
Table 14 
Study A7501008 
In the BOCF analysis there was a mean change from baseline of -9.1 YMRS points for asenapine and -
7.2 Y-MRS points for placebo (based on means). The difference between asenapine and placebo using 
the  BOCF  method  to  handle  missing  data  approached  statistical  significance  (p=0.053),  whereas  the 
primary analysis was statistically significant (p=0.026).  
The  observed  responder  rate  was  32%  for  asenapine  versus  23%  on  placebo  applying  the  missing 
equals  failure  approach.  Adjusting  for  (pooled)  center  this  leads  to  an  odds  ratio  of  1.8  in  favor  of 
asenapine, which was statistically significant (p=0.03).  
For asenapine the remitter rate was 31%, versus 18% on placebo (p=0.002). This leads to an OR of 
2.4  (95%  CI  1.4  –  4.1),  indicating  that  as  add-on  therapy  the  odds  of  being  in  remission  at  Week  3 
with asenapine treatment was more than twice as likely as when treated with placebo.

3.4.6 Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Short term studies 
With respect to phase III short terms trials (A7501004 and A7501005), the CHMP considered that the 
efficacy of asenapine has been demonstrated with both studies showing superiority of asenapine over 
placebo  at  week  3  on  the  primary  endpoint.  However,  the  CHMP  was  concerned  over  the  clinical 
significance of the treatment effect seen with asenapine, especially in study A7501004. In this study, 
treatment  differences  were  not  statistically  significant  at  day  21  for  the  responder  (p=0.1951)  and 
remitter  analyses  (p=0.5033).  In  contrast,  a  statistically  significant  greater  percentage  of  subjects  in 
the olanzapine group were responders and remitters compared with the placebo group (p=0.0011 and 
p=0.0159,  respectively)  at  day  21.  The  applicant  further  justified  the  clinical  significance  of  the 
treatment effect seen in short-term trials, presenting meta-analyses on published randomised placebo-
controlled short term studies using second generation antipsychotics. An estimate of a treatment effect 
was calculated based on a meta-analysis combining all compounds was performed, leading to a pooled 
treatment effect of -4.9 points on the YMRS scale ( 95% CI: 6.0 to -3.8). The average treatment effect 
obtained  for  asenapine  of  -4.7  YMRS  points  (with  a  95%  CI  of  -6.6  to  -2.7  YMRS  points)  was 
considered clinically relevant. 
Long term studies 
With respect to phase III long term trials, the CHMP considered that the results for study A7501006, as 
presented  by  the  applicant,  required  further  statistical  analysis  (taking  into  account  all  patients 
randomised  into  studies  A7501004  and  A7501005)  and  justification  on  the  choice  of  non-inferiority 
margin  in  this  study  prior  concluding  on  the  maintenance  of  the  effect  during  the  episode.  The 
additional  statistical  analyses  showed  estimates  of  treatment  difference  between  asenapine  and 
olanzapine  within  the  pre-specified  non-inferiority  margin  of  3  of  the  methods  used  (MMRM,  MI  and 
OC). However, the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval limit exceeded this pre-specified non-
inferiority margin using LOCF method, considered by the CHMP as a more appropriate method account 
for the early drop outs observed in the study, in this case. The CHMP concluded that non-inferiority of 
asenapine versus olanzapine was not shown. Further argumentations were provided by the applicant to 
support the maintenance of the effect of asenapine at week 12. These were related to the chosen non-
inferiority  margin  and  observed  effect  size  with  other  antipsychotics  at  week  12.  Furthermore,  two 
studies  (including  quetiapine  as  active  treatment)  were  identified  as  suitable  for  comparison  of  effect 
sizes  over  placebo  at  week  121.  Based  on  these  data,  the  applicant  considered  that  there  was  some 
evidence  of  superiority  of  asenapine  versus  putative  placebo  using  a  worst  case  scenario  (95%-95% 
rule). 
There  were  some  limitations  in  the  presented  analysis  (e.g  indirect  trials  comparison).  Nevertheless, 
the CHMP was of the opinion that given the demonstrated short term efficacy of asenapine at week 3 
and  positive  trend  of  the  YRMS  score  over  time  (using  both  LOCF  and  OC  methods),  although  non-
inferiority to olanzapine could not be concluded,  the overall data were supportive of the maintenance 
of the effect of asenapine during the episode.

With  respect  to  the  phase  III  long  term  trial  investigating  add-on  therapy  (A7501008),  the  CHMP 
questioned the clinical relevance of the treatment difference seen over placebo, particularly, given the 
lack  of  an  active  comparator  in  this  study.  As  for  the  monotherapy  indication  the  applicant  provided 
justification that the magnitude of the difference between asenapine and placebo on the Y-MRS was in 
line with that seen for other atypical antipsychotics approved for the mania indication and was clinically 
relevant.  An additional statistical analysis was conducted using BOCF method. Results showed a mean 
change  from  baseline  of  -9.1  YMRS  points  for  asenapine  and  -7.2  Y-MRS  points  for  placebo 
approaching  statistical  significance  (p  =0.053),  consistent  with  the  primary  LOCF  analysis  which  was 
statistically significant  with  a mean change from baseline of -10.3 YMRS point for asenapine and -7.9 
Y-MRS  points  for  placebo  (p=0.026).  At  week  12,  there  was  a  mean  change  from  baseline  of  -12.7 
YMRS  points  for  asenapine  and  -9.3  Y-MRS  points  for  placebo  which  was  statistically  significant  (p 
=0.0073). The observed responder rate was 32% for asenapine versus 23% on placebo (OR=1.8) and 
remitter rate was 31%, versus 18% on placebo (OR=2.4; 95% CI: 1.4 – 4.1). In the CHMP view, the 
overall analysis on the add-on therapy results was supportive of the use of asenapine in combination 
with a mood-stabilizer. 
Dose-response studies 
No dose response studies were conducted. The CHMP was concerned that the optimal dosing regimen 
had not been established for the bipolar I disorder indication applied for, particularly considering that 
the  phase  II  data  from  the  schizophrenia  clinical  program  could  not  be  extrapolated.  The  applicant 
argued  that  data  on  dopamine  D2  receptor  occupancy  and  PK/PD  modelling  using  doses  of  5  and  10 
mg BID were supportive of the proposed dosing regimen. Furthermore, more than 90% of patients in 
studies A7501004 and A7501005 remained on the starting dose of 10 mg BID, providing reassurance 
on  the  tolerability  of  this  proposed  regimen.  In  view  of  the  applicant’s  argumentation  and  the 
demonstrated  benefit  of  asenapine  using  flexible  5-10  BID  regimen,  the  CHMP  considered  overall  the 
proposed dosing regimen acceptable, provided that further supportive data are generated via a proper 
dose finding study as part of a post-approval commitment. The company submitted an outline protocol 
for  a  dose-response  study.  The  overall  design  and  size  of  the  trial  was  considered  satisfactory.  The 
choice  of  two  doses  -  5  and  10  mg  -  plus  placebo  was  considered  to  represent  the  minimum 
requirement,  2.5mg  dose  (which  produced  a  high  level  of  D2  occupancy)  in  order  to  explore  the 
minimum effective dose could have also been considered in this study. However, as the dose for mania 
tends to be higher than for schizophrenia the applicant’s proposal could be accepted.   
3.4.7 Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The CHMP concluded the following: 
- The efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks was demonstrated. 
- Maintenance of the effect during the manic episode after 12 weeks was demonstrated. 
- Superior efficacy over lithium or valproate monotherapy was also shown and maintained for up to 12 
weeks. 
- The proposed dosing regimen is acceptable provided that further supportive data are generated via a 
proper dose finding study as part of a post-approval commitment.

3.4.8 Clinical safety 
The  safety  database  presented  in  the  dossier  included  the  following  cohorts:  combined  population 
Phase 2/3 efficacy and safety trials (cohort  E1), 6 week short term schizophrenia trials (cohort  A1: 
041002,  041013;  041004),  long  term  schizophrenia  trials    (cohort  B1:  25517;  25520  ,  041512; 
041513;  25543;  25544;  A7501012),  3  week  short  term  bipolar  mania  trial  (cohort  C1:  A7501004; 
A7501005),  long  term  bipolar  mania  trials  (cohort  D1:  A7501006  ;  A7501007;  A7501008; 
A7501009), clinical pharmacology trials in healthy volunteers (cohort F1), clinical pharmacology trials 
in subjects with psychosis (cohort G1) and ongoing trials (cohort NC1). 
Patient exposure 
Overall  4565  subjects  had  received  sublingual  asenapine  including  3457  subjects  in  the  Phase  2/3 
clinical program.  Of these 3159 (91.4%) received the proposed therapeutic dose of 5 to 10 mg BID. 
as  either  fixed  or  flexible  doses,  while  298  (8.6%)  received  doses  less  than  5  mg  BID,  2826  (298 
received < 5 mg BID) of these subjects had schizophrenia and 631 subjects had bipolar I disorder.  
One thousand and three hundred and fourteen subjects had received asenapine for at least 6 months 
and 785 for at least 12 months. Almost all of these subjects received doses of 5-10 mg BID. 
Adverse events  
Combined safety data from short term placebo controlled trials are presented in Table 15.

Table 17 
In  the  combined  phase  II/III  safety  data  (cohort  E1),  the  most  commonly  reported  adverse  events 
with an incidence greater than or equal to 2.0% were  insomnia (17%), headache (13%) somnolence 
(11%) and anxiety (10.4%) in the pooled asenapine group (<5 mg and 5-10 mg BID). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In the combined phase II/III safety data (cohort E1), serious adverse events were reported in 16% of 
asenapine  treated  subjects  as  compared  to  10  %  in  the  placebo  group  and  12  %  in  the  olanzapine 
CHMP assessment report

group.  Four  %  of  asenapine  treated  subjects  experienced  an  SAE  related  to  treatment,  as  judged  by 
the investigator, most commonly psychiatric related AEs. 
The  rate  of  serious  adverse  events  was  consistently  higher  compared  to  olanzapine.  Of  the  6 
comparisons  with  olanzapine  (3  for  each  indication)  all  favoured  olanzapine  (lower  rates).  The 
differences in the schizophrenia studies reached statistical significance.  
In  cohort  E1,  there  were  19  deaths  (0.5%)  in  the pooled  asenapine  group. Four  deaths  (0.1%)  were 
considered related to study medication, as judged by the investigator: a neonatal death that occurred 
in  a  37  year  old  female  who  became  pregnant  during  the  trial  (A7501005)  and  three  subjects  who 
completed suicide (25543, A7501004 and A7501008/A7501009) including one subject with intentional 
overdose not related to asenapine (A7501008/A7501009). 
Laboratory findings 
Few subjects (<0.5%) reported haematogical related AEs. In all asenapine groups, the most commonly 
reported AEs (0.2-0.3%) was anaemia. None of these reports were considered treatment related and 
none led to discontinuation. Some cases of white blood cells decreased (n=4, 0.1%) leukopenia (n=4, 
0.1%); neutropenia (n=2, 0.1%) and granulocytopenia (n=1, 0.1%) were also reported. None of these 
reports were considered treatment related, one subject discontinued due to these related AEs. 
The incidence of blood CPK increased reported as an adverse event was 1.2% for the asenapine BID 5-
10 mg group versus 1.2% for olanzapine. 
The  incidence  of  adverse  events  related  to  electrolyte  abnormalities  for  asenapine  was  less  than  or 
equal to 0.3% with hypokalaemia having an incidence of 0.3% for the asenapine 5-10 mg BID group. 
One subject discontinued due to this AE. The incidence of adverse events related to renal function was 
0.1% for asenapine group with one subject experiencing acute renal failure that led to discontinuation. 
The  incidence  of  transaminases  (ALT  increased)  for  asenapine  5-10  mg  BID  group  was  1.7%  versus 
3.3% for olanzapine group. These AEs were transient. 
The occurrence of adverse events related to lipid metabolism disorders (HLGT) was 0.8% for asenapine 
5-10 mg BID group versus 1.4% for olanzapine group. These AEs led to discontinuation for one subject 
in the asenapine group (n=1, increased triglycerides) versus 3 subjects in the olanzapine group (n=1, 
elevated cholesterol; n=2, hyperlipidaemia). 
The incidence of blood glucose increased was 1.1% for asenapine 5-10 mg BID group versus 1.6% for 
olanzapine group.  
There  were  some  reported  adverse  events  related  to  prolactin  abnormalities  (<1%  of  all  menstrual 
cycle  and  uterine  bleeding  disorders),  the  incidences  were  comparable  among  the  treatment  groups. 
One  subject  on  asenapine  discontinued  due  to  amenorrhea.    In  the  combined  Phase  II/III  study 
population (cohort E1), the proportions of asenapine subjects in the 5-10 mg BID group with shifted to 
elevated prolactin levels (37%) was 37% for asenapine group versus 46% for olanzapine group. In the 
short-term  trials  (cohorts  A1  and  C1),  the  haloperidol  and  risperidone  groups  had  a  proportion  of 
subjects with elevations in prolactin levels above the reference range of 50% and 85%, respectively at 
endpoint.

A positive effect for asenapine was observed on the QTc interval with no dose-response relationship at 
5,  10,  15,  and  20  mg  of  asenapine(study  A7501001).  The  difference  from  placebo  in  time-matched 
change from baseline in QTc at tmax was statistically significant for both 10 mg BID dose regimen of 
asenapine and quetiapine on Day 16. Exposure-response modeling showed a mild positive effect on the 
QTc  interval.  The  point  estimates  of  QTcF  prolongation  associated  with  mean  steady  state  plasma 
asenapine  Cmax  values  were  less  than  5  msec  for  all  doses  studied  versus  7-8  msec  for  quetiapine. 
The upper bound of both the 90% CI and 95% CI of the asenapine effect was less than 8 msec for all 
asenapine  dose  groups.  In  the  combined  phase  II/III  safety  data  (cohort  E1),  incidences  of  ECG  QT 
prolongation  and  syncope  were  0.7  %  and  0.4%,  respectively,  for  both  asenapine  and  olanzapine 
groups. 
Mean sitting heart rate was increased by 1.0 beats/min for asenapine group versus 1.9 beats/min for 
olanzapine  group.  The  haloperidol  group  had  a  mean  decrease  in  sitting  heart  rate  (-1.9  beats/min). 
No relevant changes in sitting systolic or diastolic BP were observed in the asenapine group. 
Other safety findings 
Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) 
In short term schizophrenia trials (cohort A1), 13.6% of the asenapine 5-10 mg BID group had at least 
one extrapyramidal symptom and a dose-response relationship was apparent. The incidence at < 5 mg 
BID.  (6.4%)  was  comparable  to  placebo  (7.8%)  while  at  the  therapeutic  doses  the  incidence  was 
greater  (10.9%  at  5  mg  BID  and  18.3%  at  10  mg  BID).  An  excess  for  asenapine  5-10  mg  BID  over 
placebo was  seen for most of the EPS categories i.e.  akathisia (6.3% versus 2.6%), dystonia (2.6% 
versus 0.8%), and parkinsonism (5.6% versus 2.8%). 
The incidence of akathisia showed a potential dose relationship: placebo 2.6%, asenapine < 5 mg BID 
fixed dose 0.7%, asenapine 5 mg BID fixed dose 4.0%, and asenapine 10 mg BID. fixed dose 10.6%. 
There  was  also  an  increasing  trend  with  the  higher  dose  regimens  of  asenapine  for  events  in  the 
category  of  parkinsonism:  placebo  2.8%,  asenapine  <  5  mg  BID.  fixed  dose  2.0%,  asenapine  5  mg 
BID fixed dose 5.1%, and asenapine 10 mg BID fixed dose 7.7%. There was no dose relationship for 
the EPS categories of dyskinesia, dystonia, or “unspecified”. 
Highest percentage of subjects with extrapyramidal symptoms  was reported in the haloperidol group 
(39.1%). For risperidone and olanzapine, the percentages were 7.5% and 8.8%, respectively. 
The  asenapine  10  mg  BID  group  did  show  a  greater  percentage  of  subjects  with  Barnes  Akathisia 
Rating Scale (BARS) score ≥2 (15.5%) compared to placebo (9.0%). 
The proportion of subjects prescribed EPS medication in the asenapine 5-10 mg BID group was 11.2% 
versus  8.2%,  9.3%,  and  10.0%  for  placebo,  olanzapine  and  risperidone  groups,  respectively.  The 
proportion of subjects prescribed EPS medication was 41.7% for the haloperidol group. 
In long term schizophrenia trials (cohort B1), incidence of EPS adverse events in the asenapine group 
was 16% versus 5% and 8% for the placebo and olanzapine groups. This incidence was 60% for the 
haloperidol group. Main symptoms were akathisia, parkinsonism, dystonia and dyskinesia. 
In  short  term  bipolar  mania  trials  (cohort  C1),  the  percentage  of  asenapine  treated  subjects  with  at 
least  one  extrapyramidal  symptom    was  10.0%  versus  4.4%  and  9.4%  for  placebo  and  olanzapine 
groups,  respectively.  The  incidence  of  discontinuations  due  to  EPS  was  0.5%  for  placebo,  1.3%  for 
asenapine, and 0.3% for olanzapine.  In the EPS Rating Scales,  the incidence of subjects meeting the 
CHMP assessment report

SARS (Simpson-Angus Rating Scale) threshold was greater for asenapine as compared to both placebo 
and olanzapine groups. A greater proportion of subjects randomized to asenapine received medications 
for EPS (8.7%) compared to placebo and olanzapine (5.4% and 5.8%, respectively). 
In long term bipolar mania trials (cohort D1), the incidence of EPS adverse events for asenapine was 
15.7%  versus  12.7  %  and  16.2%  for  placebo  and  olanzapine  groups,  respectively.  A  greater 
proportion  of  asenapine  subjects  received  medications  for  EPS  (10.4%)  compared  to  olanzapine 
(8.3%). 
In  the  combined  phase  II/III  safety  data  (cohort  E1),  there  were  14  cases  reported  cases  of  tardive 
dyskinesia in subjects treated with asenapine, resulting in an incidence of 0.4% (incidence 1.0 per 100 
patient-years).  Ten  of  the  14  were  considered  at  least  possibly  related  to  study  drug  by  the 
investigators. One case in the asenapine 5-10 mg BID group led to permanent discontinuation and 6 of 
the 14 cases were not resolved at the end of the trial.Two cases occurred in the placebo group (0.2%, 
incidence 1.4 per 100 patient-years), one in the haloperidol group (0.9%, incidence per 100 exposure 
years = 2.9) and none in the risperidone or olanzapine groups. 
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) 
In  total  there  were  three  NMS  cases  as  judged  by  the  investigators.    All  three  subjects  had  received 
asenapine 5-10 mg BID and all were considered SAEs related to study treatment. One was assessed as 
mild  and  two  as  severe.    All  three  subjects  fully  recovered.  There  were  no  cases  of  NMS  reported  in 
either of the active comparator groups. 
Suicidality 
An analysis of the InterSePT Scale for Suicidal Thinking (ISST) was conducted in a number of cohorts. 
Overall, no or small decreases were observed in the mean total ISST score across all treatment groups 
at endpoint. 
Seizures 
There  were  13  reported  cases  of  seizures  in  total,  one  in  the  asenapine  <  5  mg  BID  group  (0.3%), 
seven  in  the  asenapine  5-10  mg  BID  (0.2%),  one  in  the  haloperidol  group  (0.9%),  and  four  in  the 
olanzapine  group  (0.4%).  Ten  cases  were  considered  SAEs.  Eight  of  the  13  seizures  led  to 
discontinuation,  four  in  the  asenapine  5-10  mg  BID  group  (0.1%)  and  four  in  the  olanzapine  group 
(0.4%). The incidence of seizures for the pooled asenapine group per 100 patient exposure years was 
0.58, versus 0.7 for olanzapine and 2.89 for haloperidol. 
Cerebrovascular adverse events 
The  incidence  of  cerebrovascular  accidents  (excluding  Transient  Ischaemic  Attacks=  TIA)  during 
asenapine  treatment  in  patients  included  in  phase  II/III  trials  was  0.068  per  100  patient  exposure 
years.  Two  subjects  treated  with  asenapine  experienced  a  serious  cerebrovascular  event 
(haemorrhagic  stroke  and  TIA,  respectively)  both  had  known  risk  factors  for  developing  these 
conditions. 
Weight gain 
Weight increase was reported as an adverse event in 8.4% of subjects in the asenapine 5-10mg BID 
dose  group  compared  to  1.0%  for  placebo,  2.6%  for  haloperidol,  5%  for  risperidone  and  19.5%  for 
olanzapine.    Mean  body  weight  change  was  +0.8  kg  in  the  asenapine  5-10  mg  BID  group  compared 
with  a  minimal  change  for  placebo  and  +3.5  kg  for  olanzapine.    The  proportion  of  subjects  with 
clinically  significant  weight  gain  (≥ 7 %  weight  gain  from  baseline  at  endpoint)  in  the  short-term 
schizophrenia  trials  was  5.3 %  for  asenapine  compared  to  2.3 %  for  placebo.  The  proportion  of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583011/2010

subjects  with  clinically  significant  weight  gain  (≥ 7 %  weight  gain  from  baseline  at  endpoint)  in  the 
short-term bipolar mania trials was 6.5 % for asenapine compared to 0.6 % for placebo. 
Orthostatic hypotension 
In  the  pooled  asenapine  group,  the  incidence  of  dizziness  and  postural  dizziness  was  relatively  high 
(18.8%  and  8.1%,  respectively).  Pre-syncope,  syncope,  and  vasovagal  syncope  occurred  with  an 
incidence of 3.5%, 1.5% and 1.1%, respectively. No dose-relationship was observed for these events. 
In the combined Phase II/III study population, the AE with the highest incidence in the asenapine 5-10 
mg BID group was dizziness (5.5%) versus 5.4% for olanzapine group. Dizziness was reported with an 
incidence 18.8% in healthy volunteers studies. 
The  incidences  for  orthostatic  hypotension  and  syncope  in  both  the  asenapine  5-10  mg  BID  and 
olanzapine  groups  were  0.4%  each.  In  elderly  subjects,  the  incidence  of  orthostatic  hypotension  was 
4.1% compared to 0.3% in the combined Phase II/III study population. 
Rhabdomyolysis 
Three cases were reported in the asenapine treated subjects. All were reported as SAEs and two cases 
led to discontinuations. 
Safety in special populations 
The population pharmacokinetic analysis of Phase II/III data showed moderately decreasing clearance 
of  asenapine  with  increasing  age.  There  was  a  26%  increase  in  AUC  between  20  and  60  year  old 
patients.  Subgroup  analyses  of  the  impact  of  age  on  the  safety  of  asenapine  for  the  combined 
population all Phase 2/3 data were performed but the number of subjects aged 65 years and older was 
insufficient for a meaningful comparison. Patients under 18 years of age were not studied in the clinical 
trial programme. 
Patients with hepatic and renal impairment were not studied in the Phase II / III studies. 
No  marked  differences  were  observed  with  respect  to  race  in  the  adverse  events  that  are  potentially 
associated  with  asenapine  at  the  recommended  doses  of  5-10  mg  BID.  With  respect  to  gender,  a 
slightly  greater  proportion  of  females  had  elevated  prolactin  levels,  in  both  active  treatment 
comparator groups. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There are no reports of AEs relating to drug interactions in the phase II/III clinical trials. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In  the  combined  phase  II/III  safety  data  (cohort  E1),  discontinuation  due  to  AEs  (with  an  incidence 
equal  or  greater  than  1%)  was  reported  in  17%  of  asenapine  subjects.  These  AEs  were  related  to 
psychiatric disorders, most commonly schizophrenia (3.4%) and depression (1.5%).

3.4.9 Discussion on clinical safety 
The majority of the safety database included patients with schizophrenia. 
The most common adverse events associated with asenapine 5-10 mg BID were sedation, somnolence, 
extrapyramidal effects, oral hypoaesthesia, increased appetite and weight gain. All these effects except 
oral  hypoaesthesia  are  well  known  AEs  of  the  antipsychotic  drug  class.  The  applicant  has  provided  a 
satisfactory justification that the incidence of oral hypoaesthesia is due to the local anaesthetic activity. 
This seemed unlikely to be of major clinical concern although there is probably some risk of oral injury 
e.g. by inadvertent biting. The amount of local anaesthetic is insufficient to cause concerns relating to 
impairment of protective airway reflexes. 
There  were  also  reports  of  other  important  AEs  known  for  this  class  of  drug  including  Neuroleptic 
Malignant  Syndrome,  seizures,  orthostatic  hypotension,  dysphagia,  body  temperature  regulation. 
Warnings  related  to  these  AEs  are  reflected  in  the  SPC.  Particularly,  if  a  patient  develops  signs  and 
symptoms indicative of NMS, asenapine must be discontinued. 
The incidence of psychiatric serious adverse events was higher in the asenapine groups as compared to 
both  placebo  and  olanzapine  groups.  Particularly,  the  incidence  of  “schizophrenia”  as  an  SAE  in  the 
asenapine group was 4.8%versus 2.3% and 2.4% for the placebo and olanzapine groups, respectively.  
The incidence of depression (1.2%) was also greater than for placebo (0.5%), although comparable to 
olanzapine  (1.1%)  whereas  mania  was  more  commonly  reported  in  the  placebo  group  (2.3  versus 
1.0%).  
Dry mouth was reported for asenapine (2.6%) but less frequently than for olanzapine (8%). 
There  were  some  reported  adverse  events  related  to  prolactin  abnormalities  (<1%  of  all  menstrual 
cycle and uterine bleeding disorders), the incidences were comparable among the treatment groups. 
Overall there is no clear signal of a causal relationship of asenapine to suicidality. However, a warning 
related  to  this  AE  is  reflected  in  SPC  as  a  suicide  attempt  is  inherent  in  psychotic  illnesses  including 
bipolar I disorder and close supervision of high-risk patients is required.  
Asenapine  induced  extrapyramidal  symptoms  in  a  proportion  of  patients  with  schizophrenia  in  the 
short-term and long term studies. The overall incidence of EPS in subjects treated with asenapine was 
slightly  higher  than  in  the  risperidone  or  olanzapine  groups,  but  significantly  lower  than  in  the 
haloperidol  group.  The  excess  incidence  over  olanzapine  was  not  apparent  in  the  bipolar  I  disorder 
studies. A warning related to tardive dyskinesia has been reflected in the SPC. 
Asenapine  may  lead  to  substantial  weight  gain,  particularly  in  subjects  who  are  not  overweight  at 
baseline. Close monitoring of this AE was recommended by the CHMP.

Asenapine has a mild effect on QTc at the intended therapeutic doses of 5 to 10 mg BID. A warning for 
patients  with  known  cardiovascular  disease  or  family  history  of  QT  prolongation  or  using  medicinal 
products thought to prolong QT interval has been reflected in the SPC.  
A number of cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with asenapine. There was 
no  signal  of  an  excess  of  cerebrovascular  risk  associated  with  asenapine.  However,  in  line  with  other 
antipsychotic drugs of the class, a warning related to elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis 
has been reflected in the SPC.

Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Based on data collected to date, the safety profile of asenapine appeared favourable. From the safety 
database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the SPC.

SCHIZOPHRENIA 
In  study  041004,  twice  daily  dose  of  asenapine  5  mg  was  studied  versus  twice  daily  doses  of 
risperidone  3  mg  and  placebo.  The  tested  dose  demonstrated  statistically  significant  difference  over 
placebo with a change from baseline to week 6 in PANSS total score of -15.86 for asenapine versus -
5.27 for placebo (p=0.0024). 
In  study  041023,  treatment  with  asenapine  5  mg  BID  resulted  in  a  statistically  significantly  greater 
mean change from baseline to week 6 in the PANSS total score of -16.2 for asenapine versus -10.7 for 
placebo (p=0.0290). 
In study A7501012,  there was a statistically significant difference in favour of asenapine between the 
treatment groups with respect to the time to relapse or impending relapse (p<0.0001) based on a log-
rank  test.  The  time  to  relapse  was  longer  in  the  asenapine  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group. 
Asenapine  was  also  shown  to  be  more  effective  than  placebo  in  prolonging  the  time  to  early 
termination for any reason and the time to relapse or impending relapse.

BIPOLAR I DISORDER 
In  study  A7501004,  Y-MRS  total  scores  were  statistically  significantly  improved  in  the  asenapine  and 
olanzapine  treatment  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  treatment  group  (p=0.0065  for  asenapine 
versus placebo and p<0.0001 for olanzapine versus placebo). The  mean change from baseline to Day 
21  was  -11.5,  -7.8,  and  -14.6  for  the  asenapine,  placebo,  and  olanzapine  treatment  groups, 
respectively.  Mean  changes  from  baseline    in  the  CGI-BP,  severity  of  mania  also  showed  statistically 
significant improvements in the asenapine group over placebo at Day 21.  
In  study  A7501005,  Y-MRS  total  scores  were  statistically  significantly  improved  in  the  asenapine  and 
olanzapine  treatment  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  treatment  group  (p<0.0001  for  both 
comparisons with placebo). The mean change from baseline to Day 21 was -10.8, -5.5, and -12.6 for 
the  asenapine,  placebo,  and  olanzapine  treatment  groups,  respectively.  Mean  changes  from  baseline  
in  the  CGI-BP,  severity  of  mania  also  showed  statistically  significant  improvements  in  the  asenapine 
group over placebo at Day 21. At Day 21, 42.3% of subjects in the asenapine group were responders 
compared  with  25.2%  in  the  placebo  group.  This  treatment  difference  was  statistically  significant 
(p=0.0049).  A  statistically  significant  greater  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  olanzapine  group  were 
responders  compared  with  the  placebo  at  day  21(p<0.0001).  At  Day  21,  40.2%  of  subjects  in  the 
asenapine group were remitters compared with 22.3%in the placebo group. This treatment difference 
was statistically significant (p=0.0020). A statistically significant greater percentage of subjects in the 
olanzapine group were remitters compared with the placebo group at Day 21 (p=0.0041). 
In  study  A7501006,  a  9-week,  olanzapine-controlled,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  multicentre, 
parallel  group,  continuation  trial,  both  the  asenapine  and  olanzapine  groups  showed  improvement  on 
the primary efficacy endpoint. The mean change from baseline to Week 12 on the Young-Mania Rating 
Scale  (Y-MRS)  was  -27.3  for  the  asenapine  treatment  group  and  -23.7  for  the  olanzapine  treatment 
group. 
2.5.3.1.2.  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
SCHIZOPHRENIA 
With respect to phase II short-term trials (041002, 041013 and 041004), no dose response could be 
established. 
In study 041021, no statistically significant differences in the mean changes from baseline to week 6 in 
the  PANSS  total  score  were  observed  between  placebo  (-11.1)  and  asenapine  5  mg  (-14.5)  or 
asenapine 10 mg BID (-13.4). Mean change from baseline to week 6 on  PANSS total score for placebo, 
asenapine 5 mg BID, asenapine 10 mg BID and olanzapine 15 mg QD were -11.1 (1.64), -14.5 (1.59), 
-13.4  (1.63),  -16.5  (1.64),  respectively.  Compared  with  placebo,  olanzapine  treatment  resulted  in  a 
statistically  significantly  greater  mean  change  from  baseline  in  the  PANSS  total  score  (-16.5, 
p=0.0168). 
In study 041023, no statistically significant difference between asenapine 10 mg BID and placebo was 
observed  in  the  mean  change  from  baseline  to  week  6  in  the  PANSS  total  score  (placebo  [-10.7] 
versus  asenapine  10  mg  BID  [-14.9],  adjusted  p=0.0680)  using  the  LOCF  method.  Analyses  of  the 
primary endpoint using OC and MMRM analyses showed a statistically significant difference in favor of 
asenapine 10 mg BID [-18.5] compared with placebo [-14.0] was observed (p=0.0167). 
In study 041022, no statistically significant differences (p>0.05) in the mean changes from baseline to 
week  6  in  the  PANSS  total  score  were  observed  between  asenapine  (-9.4)  and  placebo  (-9.9)  or 
CHMP assessment report

between  olanzapine  (-11.5)  and  placebo  (-9.9).  Furthermore,  no  statistically  significant  (p>0.05) 
differences  between  asenapine  and  placebo  or  between  olanzapine  and  placebo  were  observed  in  the 
mean changes from baseline to endpoint in any secondary efficacy or health outcomes measures.  
Results from a retrospective meta-analysis (including short term phase III studies) was suggestive of 
efficacy  (for PANSS  total score:  2.7  points  greater  for  asenapine  versus  placebo  (p=0.021;  95%  CI  -
5.0 to -0.4); for responder rates: OR=1.9, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.6; p<0.001). However, the pooled 95% CI 
was  very  close  to  zero.  Adding  in  the data  from  the  phase  2  study  041004  improved  the  result,  with 
the  lower  bound  improving  to  -1.5  and  the  p-value  becoming  p=0.0011.  But  as  this  combines  the 
hypothesis generating and the pivotal data there is a higher hurdle to meet. Ideally the phase 3 data 
alone should provide compelling evidence of efficacy. 
In  the  long  term  placebo-controlled,  double-blind  trial  A7501012,  asenapine  was  statistically 
significantly superior to placebo (p<0.001 on log-rank test). If short term benefit could be established 
this  would  provide  support  for  long-term  treatment.  However,  in  the  absence  of  short-term  benefit 
having been demonstrated the study is of limited relevance. 
In  study  A25517,  statistically  significant  difference  (p<0.001)  in  the  mean  change  from  baseline  to 
week 52 in the PANSS total score was observed in favour of olanzapine. At baseline, the PANSS total 
scores were 92.1 for both asenapine and olanzapine groups. At week 52, the PANSS total scores were 
71.0  and  64.6  for  asenapine  and  olanzapine  groups,  respectively  (difference:  6.54,  95%  CI:  3.87-
9.21).  
BIPOLAR I DISORDER 
No dose response studies were conducted. 
In study A7501004, 42.6% of subjects in the asenapine group were responders compared with 34.0% 
in  the  placebo  group  at  week  3.  However,  this  treatment  difference  was  not  statistically  significant 
(p=0.1951).  A  statistically  significant  greater  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  olanzapine  group  were 
responders compared with the placebo group (p=0.0011) at week 3. Additionally, 35.5% of subjects in 
the  asenapine  group  were  remitters  compared  with  30.9%  in  the  placebo  group  and  this  treatment 
difference was also not statistically significant (p=0.5033).A statistically significant greater percentage 
of  subjects  in  the  olanzapine  group  were  remitters  compared  with  the  placebo  group  at  Day  21 
(p=0.0159). 
In  study  A7501008,  analyses  using  several  methods  for  handling  missing  data  (LOCF,  OC,  MMRM) 
showed  different  results.  Overall,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  non-inferiority  of  asenapine  versus 
olanzapine was not shown. 
2.5.3.2. 
 Risks 
2.5.3.2.1. 
 Unfavourable effects 
The  incidences  of  the  most  common  AEs  were  generally  comparable  to  those  seen  for  olanzapine 
except for sedation (but not somnolence) which seemed to be more common with olanzapine (15.1%), 
and  “hypoaesthesia  oral”.  The  applicant  has  provided  a  satisfactory  justification  that  the  incidence  of 
oral hypoaesthesia is due to the local anaesthetic activity. This seemed unlikely to be of major clinical 
concern although there is probably some risk of oral injury e.g. by inadvertent biting. The amount of 
local anaesthetic is insufficient to cause concerns relating to impairment of protective airway reflexes.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583011/2010  
Page 84/88
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  overall  AE  rates  were  not  substantially  different  from  olanzapine.  However  the  rates  of  severe 
adverse  events,  serious  adverse  events  and  adverse  events  leading  to  discontinuation  were 
consistently higher. There was no indication of a different safety profile in the two patient populations. 
The severe / serious / discontinuation AEs were predominantly in the psychiatric, nervous system and 
gastrointestinal  (GI)  system  organ  class  (SOC).  The  excess  over  olanzapine  is  seen  to  lie  almost 
entirely in the psychiatric SOC; there is a weak trend at best to an excess in the nervous system and 
none at all in the GI SOC.  
Differences in psychiatric adverse event rates appear to become apparent in particular with long term 
treatment.  This  is  of  potential  concern  as  treatment  is  often  required  in  the  long  term  especially  in 
schizophrenia  where  treatment  is  often  required  life  long.  However  it  is  agreed  that  a  substantial 
proportion  of  reported  serious  psychiatric  adverse  events  are  likely  to  reflect  hospitalizations  and/or 
other events due to exacerbations of the illness being treated. As asenapine showed consistently less 
efficacy than olanzapine in the clinical trials it seemed plausible that the excess incidence in severe / 
serious  /  discontinuation  AEs 
is  attributable  to  those  efficacy  differences  (e.g 
increased 
hospitalisations) rather than to a safety issue per se.  
Asenapine  shows  clinically  important  advantages  over  olanzapine  in  terms  of  weight  gain  and  effects 
on  metabolic  laboratory  parameters.  However,  it  may  lead  to  substantial  weight  gain,  particularly  in 
subjects  who  are  not  overweight  at  baseline.  Furthermore,  olanzapine  is  recognised  as  being 
particularly problematic in this regard and most atypical antipsychotics are superior to it. The profile of 
asenapine in terms of weight gain appears broadly similar to risperidone.   
The  incidence  of  extrapyramidal  symptoms  (EPS)  in  subjects  treated  with  asenapine  at  therapeutic 
doses (5-10mg BID) was slightly higher than in the risperidone or olanzapine groups. All of the atypical 
antipsychotics studied produced substantially less EPS than haloperidol which is to be expected.  
Dry mouth was reported for asenapine (2.6%) but less frequently than for olanzapine (8%).  
For  prolactin  there  was  no  clear  difference  from  olanzapine  but  asenapine  caused  significantly  less 
elevation of prolactin levels than risperidone and haloperidol.  
Asenapine seemed to be benign in terms of QT prolongation which is an advantage over sertindole and 
ziprasidone.  
2.5.3.2.2. 
 Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety profile is generally in line with that known for this class of drug. Further data are required 
from  the  risk  management  programme  to  characterise  less  common  undesirable  effects  but  no 
substantial issues are identified at the present time.  
2.5.3.3. 
 Benefit-risk balance 
2.5.3.3.1. 
 Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Atypical  antipsychotics  have  an  important  role  in  treating  very  serious  psychiatric  illnesses  but  also 
have  substantial  potential  to  cause  harm.  The  various  products  differ  from  each  other  to  varying 
degrees  in  their  safety  and  efficacy  profiles.  Certain  products,  including  clozapine  and  probably 
olanzapine, are more efficacious than others but the additional efficacy comes at the cost of additional

safety problems. The choice of a particular atypical antipsychotic therefore needs to be tailored to the 
requirements of the individual patient. A new atypical antipsychotic may have a positive risk-benefit if 
it has safety and/or tolerability advantages over other available agents, even if there is a disadvantage 
in  terms  of  efficacy.  In  this  case  the  value  of  the  safety  advantage  needs  to  be  weighed  against  the 
cost in terms of lost efficacy.  
2.5.3.3.2.  Benefit-risk balance 
SCHIZOPHRENIA 
The evidence from the phase 3 short term studies is weak, with inconsistent results and questionable 
clinical  relevance.  Only  1  out  of  5  comparisons  to  placebo  achieved  statistical  significance.  In  the 
numerous  comparisons  between  olanzapine  and  asenapine  the  efficacy  of  sublingual  asenapine 
appeared  consistently  to be  inferior  to  that  of  olanzapine  although  this is  probably  also true  for  most 
other  antipsychotics  (and  olanzapine  has  important  disadvantages  in  terms  of  safety  and  tolerability 
profiles).  In  a  meta-analysis  of  the  three  pivotal  phase  3  trials  the  overall  treatment  effect  of  -2.7 
points difference from placebo was statistically significant, but at a level that falls short of compelling 
(p=0.021;  95%  CI  -5.0  to  -0.4).  The  lower  confidence  limit  was  not  far  from  zero.  This  level  of 
evidence  from  the  meta-analysis  is  considered  not  extreme  enough  to  be  convincing.  Adding  in  the 
phase 2 data did improve the result, with the lower bound improving to -1.5 and the p-value becoming 
p=0.0011.  But  as  this  combined  the  hypothesis  generating  and  the  pivotal  data  there  is  a  higher 
hurdle to meet. Ideally the phase 3 data alone should provide compelling evidence of efficacy. 
The meta-analysis of PANSS 30% responders did not seem to greatly strengthen the equivocal findings 
on  the  primary  endpoint.  The  confidence  interval  for  the  phase  III  meta-analysis  for  the  difference 
between  treatments  did  not  exclude  zero,  though  the  trend  favoured  asenapine.  Even  if  the  phase  II 
study 041004 is added in the lower bound is only 0.1%. 
The  clinical  significance  of  the  difference  from  placebo  in  mean  PANSS  score  remains  doubtful.  The 
mean treatment effect seen for Sycrest of 2.7 points on the PANSS (3.7 if the phase 2 study 041004 is 
included)  was  substantially  less  than  the  comparable  results  from  the  phase  3  trials  for  currently 
approved  products.  The  responder  analyses  for  the  combined  Phase  3  population  were  also 
unconvincing. 
There  was  a  total  absence  of  clinical  evidence  that  the  proposed  upper  dose  of  10mg  is  superior  to 
5mg; indeed the trends tend to favour 5mg over 10mg. 
Asenapine  was  shown  to  be  inferior  to  Olanzapine  in  the  long-term  trial  25517.  As  the  trial  did  not 
include a placebo group it cannot provide any evidence of efficacy.  
In  the  relapse  prevention  trial  A7501012  there  was  a  statistically  significant  benefit  for  staying  with 
asenapine  compared  to  staying  on  placebo  (p<0.001  on  log-rank  test).  If  short  term  benefit  can  be 
established this would provide support for long-term treatment, but as short-term benefit has not been

demonstrated the study is of limited relevance. The extensions to the phase III short-term trials lacked 
the power to draw any conclusions on the comparative efficacy of the two treatments and the lack of a 
placebo control in Negative Symptoms trial 25543 meant that it could not provide evidence of efficacy.  
In  conclusion  there  is  insufficient  evidence  of  short  term  efficacy  to  support  the  schizophrenia 
indication. 
Given  that  the  overall  safety  profile  appeared  comparable  to  other  approved  antipsychotics  in  this 
indication, the benefit-risk balance for asenapine is negative. 
BIPOLAR I DISORDER 
The  efficacy  in  reducing  manic  symptoms  over  3  weeks  was  demonstrated.  However,  the  clinical 
significance  of  the  treatment  effect  of  Sycrest  in  the  short  term  studies  A7501004  and  A7501005 
appeared  modest  (especially  in  the  former)  and  Sycrest  appeared  to  have  inferior  efficacy  to 
Olanzapine. In the company’s responses the size of the treatment effect was shown to be in line with 
responses  seen  for  other  approved  atypical  antipsychotics,  and  the  results  were  also  comparable  to 
those  from  the  phase  3  pivotal  trials  supporting  the  marketing  authorisation  applications  for  other 
atypical  antipsychotics.  The  fact  that  olanzapine  seemed  to  show  greater  efficacy  is  not  a  barrier  to 
approval  as  olanzapine  probably  has  greater  efficacy  than  a  number  of  atypical  antipsychotics 
approved  for  the  treatment  of  bipolar  I  disorder  but  also  has  major  safety  and  tolerability 
disadvantages. 
Maintenance  of  effect  during  the  episode  has  been  demonstrated.  The  original  analysis  of  A7501006 
was inadequate as it did not represent a comparison of randomised groups. In the re-presentation of 
the 12-week data accounting for all randomised patients, non-inferiority to olanzapine was not formally 
shown. It is not considered a requirement to achieve this as olanzapine probably has superior efficacy 
to  most  other  atypical  antipsychotics.  Superiority  to  a  putative  placebo  was  shown  indirectly  but 
reasonably convincingly and this is considered sufficient. Maintenance of effect is therefore considered 
to be adequately shown.  
The benefit of combination treatment with a mood-stabiliser has been sufficiently established.  
The efficacy for asenapine can be considered to be adequately demonstrated as a treatment for Bipolar 
I disorder. 
The overall safety profile appeared comparable to other approved antipsychotics in this indication. 
In conclusion, the benefit-risk balance for asenapine is positive. 
However,  the  optimal  dosing  regimen has  not  been  established as  no  dose  finding  studies  have  been 
conducted.  The  company  has  provided  a  commitment  to  perform  a  dose  finding  study  as  a  post-
approval commitment. 
2.5.3.4.  Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
SCHIZOPHRENIA 
The  CHMP  considered  the  risk-benefit  of  asenapine  in  “the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in  adults”  is 
negative for the following reasons:  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583011/2010

- There is insufficient evidence of efficacy from short term trials.  
- The magnitude of the claimed efficacy is of doubtful clinical significance. 
-  In  the  absence  of  adequate  evidence  of  efficacy  from  short  term  trials,  the  long  term  trials  cannot 
provide meaningful evidence of efficacy. 
- The long term comparison to olanzapine did not provide evidence of efficacy. 
BIPOLAR I DISORDER 
The  CHMP  considered  the  risk-benefit  of  asenapine  is  positive,  provided  the  indication  is  as  follows: 
“treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults”. A dose 
finding study will be carried out by the applicant as part of post-approval commitment. 
2.5.3.5.  Risk management plan 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
(cid:131) 
pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed 
to investigate further some of the safety concerns. 
(cid:131)  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information. 
2.5.4.  Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by  majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Sycrest in the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes 
associated with bipolar I disorder in adults was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of 
the marketing authorisation.

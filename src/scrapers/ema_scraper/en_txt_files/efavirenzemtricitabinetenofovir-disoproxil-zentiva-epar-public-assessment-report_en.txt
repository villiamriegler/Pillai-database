2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva 600-200-245 mg film-coated tablets were 
developed as a generic equivalent to the innovator´s product Atripla 600/200/245 mg film-coated 
tablets. The innovator´s product was authorized in EU on 13.12.2007 as a fixed dose combination for 
treatment of HIV-1 infected adults aged 18 years and over. The marketing authorization holder is 
Bristol-Myers Squibb and Gilead Science Ltd., UK.  
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir is a well-known, well-described antiviral combination for the treatment 
of HIV. The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are currently well described and a number of PK 
data in less frequently studied compartments and in special populations have been published recently. 
Efavirenz binds directly to the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase resulting in allosteric inhibition of DNA- and 
RNA- dependent DNA polymerase. 
Emtricitabine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue of cytidine and undergoes intracellular phosphorylation 
to form the active metabolite, emtricitabine 5´-triphosphate, which competes with deoxycytidine 
5´-triphosphate and becomes incorporated into HIV-1 DNA, resulting in viral DNA chain termination and 
the inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity. 
Tenofovir is a nucleotide analogue of adenosine monophosphate. Its active metabolite, tenofovir 
diphosphate, competes with natural deoxyadenosine triphosphate for the active binding site on the 
HIV-induced reverse transcriptase (HIV DNA polymerase). Incorporation of tenofovir diphosphate into 
viral DNA results in chain termination, since tenofovir diphosphate lacks the hydroxyl group in the 
3´-position, which acts as the point of attachment for the next deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate. Hence, 
reverse transcription, the key step in HIV proliferation, is inhibited. 
The indication applied is for the use of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva in the 
treatment of Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults aged 18 years and over with 
virologic suppression to HIV-1 RNA levels of < 50 copies/ml on their current combination antiretroviral 
therapy for more than three months. Patients must not have experienced virological failure on any prior 
antiretroviral therapy and must be known not to have harboured virus strains with mutations conferring 
significant resistance to any of the three components contained in Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva prior to initiation of their first antiretroviral treatment regimen. 
2.2.  Quality aspects

described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
Efavirenz 
General information 
The chemical name of efavirenz is (4S)-6-Chloro-4-(cyclopropylethynyl)-1,4-dihydro-4- 
(trifluoromethyl)-H-3,1-benzoxazin-2-one corresponding to the molecular formula C 14H9ClF3NO2. It has 
a relative molecular mass of 315.68 g/mol and the following structure: 
The active substance is supplied by two suppliers. 
Figure 1.  Structure of efavirenz. 
Both manufactures sufficiently elucidated the structure of the active substance (AS) by a combination of 
IR, UV, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, XRPD and mass spectroscopy (MS). Additionally specific optical rotation was 
performed by one supplier, whereas the other performed elemental analysis (C, H, N) and DSC.  
Efavirenz appears as a white to slightly pink non-hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is soluble in methanol, 
practically insoluble in water and insoluble in pH range 1.2-8.0. Its pKa was found to be around 10. 
It  contains  one  chiral  centre  resulting  in  two  enantiomers.  S-enantiomer  is  the  desired  one  and  the 
R-enantiomer is controlled in the specification as an impurity. 
Efavirenz exhibits polymorphism. The same polymorphic form is manufactured  and  was  confirmed  by 
XRPD and controlled by DSC. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance by both suppliers has been provided in 
the restricted part of the two ASMFs and it was considered satisfactory. 
Efavirenz is synthesized in three main chemical steps followed by milling, drying, micronizing, sifting and 
packing. The starting materials are well-defined with acceptable specifications. 
The  second  supplier  manufactures  efavirenz  in  four  main  chemical  steps.  The  key  intermediate 
aminocarbinol is manufactured in three stages and then it is further converted to efavirenz in one step. 
The  choice  of  the  starting  materials  has  been  justified  and  they  are  controlled  by  appropriate 
specification.  
Reagents  and  intermediates  in  both  manufacturing  processes  are  also  controlled  by  acceptable 
specifications. Adequate in-process controls (IPC) are applied during the synthesis. The characterisation 
of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new 
Assessment report  
EMA/454542/2017  
Page 13/39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
active substances. Potential and actual impurities including genotoxic impurities were well discussed with 
regards  to  their  origin  and  characterised.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  impurities  are  generally 
adequately controlled during manufacturing of the active substance.  
Efavirenz is packaged in double LDPE bags placed in a HDPE drum. For the primary packaging material 
specifications  including  IR  identification  have  been  provided.  The  materials  comply  with  the  relevant 
European requirements. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for appearance (visual), identity 
(IR, HPLC, UV absorption), solubility (visual), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals, sulfated ash (Ph. 
Eur.),  enantiomeric  purity  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  related  substances  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC), 
polymorphism (XRD) and specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.). 
The potential impurities and possible genotoxic impurities which are possible from the defined starting 
materials are controlled in the final active substance by validated test methods. As the results are either 
below  detection  limit  or  not  detected,  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  impurities  are  generally 
adequately controlled during manufacturing of the active substance. Based on the data provided, the fate 
and carry-over of above impurities has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.  
Batch analysis results from six production scale batches of the active substance were provided by one 
supplier. Batch analysis results from 18 production batch of efavirenz was provided by the other supplier. 
The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability  data  on  three  production  scale  batches  of  active  substance  from  one  supplier  stored  in  the 
intended commercial packaging for up to 48 months under long term conditions (25±2 °C / 60±5% RH), 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40±2 °C / 75±5% RH) and also intermediate studies 
(30±2 °C; 75±5% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Proposed retest period of 5 years 
and  storage  conditions  preserving  in  tight,  light  resistant  container,  stored  at  25  °C  with  excursions 
permitted between 15 °C and 30 °C are accepted. 
Stability  data  on  three  production  scale  batches  from  the  second  supplier  stored  in  the  intended 
commercial packaging for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25±2 °C / 60±5% RH) and for up 
to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40±2 °C / 75±5% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
also provided. The Proposed retest period 5 years and storage conditions not exceeding 25 °C, protected 
from light, in well closed container are accepted. 
Samples  were  tested  for  description,  identification,  polymorphic  form,  limit  of  Efavirenz  enantiomer, 
water content, assay, related substances and specific optical rotation (tested by). The analytical methods 
used were the same as for release and were stability indicating.  
No significant changes to any of the measured parameters were observed under either storage condition 
and all remained within specification (long term and accelerated conditions). 
Photostability  testing  following  the  ICH  guideline  Q1B  was  performed  on  one  batch  by  both 
manufacturers. The active substance is not sensitive to light.

Stress testing (to basic and acidic hydrolysis, oxidation, and thermal and photo degradation) was also 
performed on one batch by each manufacturer. Varying degrees of degradation were observed under the 
conditions tested, which were more prominent under base hydrolysis. The degradation pathways and the 
stability indicating power of the assay and related substance methods have been demonstrated.  
The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months in the proposed container.  
Emtricitabine 
General information 
The 
chemical 
name 
of 
emtricitabine 
is 
4-amino-5-fluoro-1-[(2R,5S)-2-(hydroxymethyl)- 
1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl]-2(1H)-pyrimidinone corresponding to the molecular formula C8H10FN3O3S. It has a 
relative molecular mass of 247.25 g/mol and the following structure: 
The active substance is supplied by two suppliers. 
Figure 2.  Structure of emtricitabine. 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, 
elemental analysis, UV spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, mass  spectrometry. In addition specific optical 
rotation was performed by the first supplier whereas the secondperformed identification by HPLC, and 
X-Ray Powder Diffraction methods as well. 
Emtricitabine appears as a white to off-white non-hygroscopic crystalline powder, sparingly soluble in 
water and in methanol. Its pKa was found to be between 2.15 and 2.27 and the partition coefficient log P 
-0.40. It has 2 chiral centres at carbons 2 and 5 of the oxathiolane ring. There are four possible isomers 
due  to  these  asymmetric  carbons  in  the  molecule  and  the  isomer  2R,5S  is  commercially  produced. 
Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC and specific optical rotation in the intermediate 
product and in the final active substance. 
Emtricitabine  exhibits  polymorphism.  The  same  crystalline  is  consistently  manufactured  by  both 
suppliers,  and  is  characterised  and  controlled  by  XRD  method  (by  the  fisrt  manufacturer)  and  DSC 
method (by the second manufacturer) at release and during stability studies.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance by both suppliers has been provided in 
the restricted part of the two ASMFs and it was considered satisfactory. 
The starting materials used by the two manufacturers are well-defined with acceptable specifications. 
The  synthesis  of  the  key  intermediate  is  performed  using  slightly  different  solvents  in  the  chemical 
reactions by the two ASMF Holders. 
The synthetic scheme of the final active substance from the key intermediate is the same for both active 
substance manufacturers. It is synthesized in three main chemical steps. In addition, the first supplier has 
Assessment report  
EMA/454542/2017  
Page 15/39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a  milling  step  before  packaging.  The  key  intermediate,  solvents  and  reagents  are  described  and  are 
controlled  by  appropriate  specifications.  A  satisfactory  brief  description  of  the  micronisation  step 
performed has also been provided. 
The synthetic route was described in sufficient detail. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the 
synthesis. The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU 
guideline  on  chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  Potential  and  actual  impurities  including  genotoxic 
impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. They are controlled in the 
final active substance by validated test methods and the results from commercial scale active substance 
batches were summarised. As the results were either below detection limit or not detected, it has been 
demonstrated that the impurities are generally adequately controlled during manufacturing of the active 
substance.  
Emtricitabine is packed by both suppliers in two layers of LDPE bags placed in an HDPE container. The 
polythene bags used as primary packaging material are food grade and comply with the requirements of 
Ph. Eur. and European Directive 10/2011 as amended. The specifications of the LDPE bag as well as CoAs 
were presented.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for appearance (visual), solubility 
(visual), identity (IR, HPLC, Specific Optical Rotation), polymorphism (XRD), specific optical rotation (Ph. 
Eur.), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals, chloride content (potentiometry), 
related substances (HPLC, TLC), enatiomeric purity (HPLC), assay (HPLC) and residual solvents (GC). 
Some of the tests are performed depending on the source of the active substance 
The potential impurities and possible genotoxic impurities which are possible from the defined starting 
material are controlled in the final active substance by validated test methods and the results from three 
commercial  scale  emtricitabine  batches  (first  supplier)  and  several  batches,  including  10  commercial 
scale batches from the other supplier are summarised. As the results are either below detection limit or 
not detected, it has been demonstrated that the impurities are generally adequately controlled during 
manufacturing of the active substance. Based on the data provided, the fate and carry-over of above 
impurities has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results from three commercial scale batches from the first supplier and from 13 batches 
(including  10  commercial  scale)  from  the  second  supplier  were  provided.  The  results  are  within  the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on four production scale batches of active substance from first the manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial packaging for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25±2 °C / 60±5 % 
RH)  was  provided.  Three  of  the  above  batches  were  stored  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated 
conditions (40±2 °C / 75±5 % RH) according to the ICH guidelines.  
The second manufacturer has also provided stability data from fifteen pilot and commercial scale  batches 
stored in the intended commercial packaging for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25±2 °C / 
Assessment report

60±5 % RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40±2 °C / 75±5 % RH) according to 
the ICH guidelines. 
Samples  were tested  for the  parameters included in  the  release  specification.  The  analytical  methods 
used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
No significant changes to any of the measured parameters were observed under either storage condition 
and all remained within specification. Based on the presented data a change of polymorphic form during 
the proposed retest period is considered highly unlikely. 
Photostability  testing  following  the  ICH  guideline  Q1B  was  performed  by  each  manufacturer  on  one 
commercial scale batch. The results showed that the active substance is not sensitive to light. 
Stress  testing  (thermal,  light,  hydrolysis,  acidic,  basic,  oxidative  and  reductive  conditions)  was  also 
performed on one commercial scale batch by each manufacturer. Samples were tested for description, 
identification, specific optical rotation (only performed by the first supplier), loss on drying, assay and 
related substances. The degradation pathways and the stability indicating power of the assay and related 
substance methods have been demonstrated.  
The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months in the proposed container. 
Tenofovir disoproxil 
General information 
The  chemical  name  of  tenofovir  disoproxil  phosphate  is  9-((R)-2-bis(((isopropoxycarbonyl)oxy) 
methoxy)phosphinyl)-methoxy)propyl)adenine  phosphate  corresponding  to  the  molecular  formula 
C19H30N5O10P, H3PO4 and has a relative molecular mass of 617.44 g/mol. It has the structure shown in 
figure 7: 
Figure 3.  Structure of tenofovir disoproxil phosphate. 
The molecular structure of Tenofovir disoproxil phosphate has been confirmed by use of spectroscopic 
methods as IR, MS, NMR (13C and 1H), and UV. 
The active substance is a white to off-white crystalline powder, slightly hygroscopic and slightly soluble in 
aqueous  media  across  the  physiological  pH  range.  Given  that  a  wet  granulation  process  is  used  to 
manufacture the tablets and the rapid dissolution of the active substance from that formulation, particle 
size is not expected to affect product performance and is not controlled. A single polymorphic form has 
been observed which is routinely produced by the manufacturing process. There is one chiral centre which 
originates in one of the starting materials and is controlled in the active substance by chiral HPLC.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Tenofovir disoproxil phosphate is synthesized in five main steps using well-defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. One manufacturer is responsible for the production of an intermediate which is 
then converted to the active substance by a second manufacturer. The starting materials were re-defined 
during the procedure in order to ensure that enough of the process is documented in the dossier and 
carried  out  under  GMP,  resulting  in  addition  of  the  second  manufacturer.  The  single  chiral  centre  is 
controlled in one of the starting materials and carries through unaltered to the active substance.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. Potential and actual impurities were well 
discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. A thorough assessment of potential mutagenic 
impurities was carried out and adequate controls have been put in place. The specifications and control 
methods  for  intermediate  products,  starting  materials  and  reagents  have  been  presented.  The 
characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
The active substance is packaged in double LDPE bags inside a drum. The materials comply with the EC 
directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance  (visual),  identity  (IR),  water  content 
(KF),  heavy  metals  (ICP-AES),  phosphoric  acid  assay  (titration),  assay  (titration),  related  compounds 
(HPLC),  9-propenyladenine  (HPLC),  fumaric  acid  (HPLC),  enantiomeric  purity  (chiral  HPLC),  residual 
solvents (GC), and microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.) particle size (Ph. Eur.). 
The mono-POC PMPA impurity present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A is 
a known metabolite and thus considered to be qualified. Other impurities are adequately controlled by the 
specifications. There are no controls for polymorphic form as the produced crystalline form is the only one 
known. The lack of control for particle size is acceptable given the solubility of the active substance in 
relevant media and its rapid dissolution profile from the tablets. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from three production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 12 months under long term conditions (5±3 °C) and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25±2 °C/ 60±5 % RH) according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. Samples were tested for enantiomeric purity, water content and assay. The analytical 
methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. No significant changes to any of 
the  measured  parameters  were  observed  under  either  storage  condition  and  all  remained  within 
specification.

Photostability  testing  following  the  ICH  guideline  Q1B  and  stress  testing  (high  temperature,  elevated 
humidity, acidic, basic and oxidising aqueous media) was performed on one production scale batch. The 
active  substance  is  not  photosensitive  but  is  slightly  sensitive  to  heat  and  extremely  sensitive  to 
combination of heat and moisture. It degrades, mainly via hydrolysis, under all the aqueous conditions. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months at 5±3 °C in the 
proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as pink, oval biconvex film coated immediate release tablets, intended 
for oral administration.  
The aim of the pharmaceutical development work was to develop a stable formulation containing 600 mg 
of Efavirenz, 200 mg of emtricitabine and 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil (phosphate), which would be 
bioequivalent to the reference product Atripla 600mg/200mg/245mg film-coated tablets.  
The  reference  product  was  characterised  with  respect  to  qualitative  composition,  physico-chemical 
characterisation and dissolution behaviour.  The reference medicinal product contains tenofovir disoproxil 
as  a  fumarate  salt,  whereas  the  phosphate  salt  of  tenofovir  disoproxil  is  used  in  the  Zentiva  generic 
formulation. This is acceptable since both salts result in exposure to the same active metabolite, they are 
salts of the same prodrug and they have a very similar impurity profile. Phosphate salt is a frequently 
used salt in pharmaceutical applications which is not expected to cause any toxic effects. Furthermore 
according to the performed bioequivalence study, both molecules have the same bioavailability after oral 
administration.  
The  qualitative  composition  was  determined  based  on  information  from  the  literature  and  from 
development  formulations  trials  considering  the  different  properties  of  the  raw  materials  and  finished 
product  characteristics.  The  qualitative  composition  of  the  generic  product  is  comparable  to  that  of 
reference  product  except  for  the  presence  of  talc  and  colloidal  anhydrous  silica,  only  in  the  generic 
product. Talc is used as glidant to improve the flowability of Emtricitabine+Tenofovir Disoproxil layer; 
colloidal  anhydrous  silica,  was  chosen  as  the  anti-tacking  agent  to  eliminate  tenofovir  disoproxil 
phosphate’s tendency of sticking on metal surfaces.  Sodium laurilsulfate (SLS) was used as surfactant in 
order  to  facilitate  the  dissolution  of  efavirenz  which  has  low  water  solubility.  It  is  known  from  the 
literature that tenofovir disoproxil is incompatible with sodium laurilsulfate. Thus, the reference product is 
designed as bilayer tablet in order to minimise the physical contact between SLS and tenofovir disoproxil. 
The same approach was adopted for the dosage form design of the Zentiva generic product. Excipients 
used are well known and are commonly used for this type of medicinal product; they are of Ph.Eur. quality 
except Opadry II white which is of in-house quality. The colorants used in the formulation of finished 
product meet the requirement of the EC Regulation No. 231/2012. Based on the presented information, 
efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil phosphate do not show any incompatibility either with 
the  excipients  used  in  the  formulation  or  with  each  other,  which  was  also  confirmed  during  the 
accelerated stability studies.  
Based on literature information, emtricitabine is a Class I (high solubility, high permeability), tenofovir 
disoproxil  phosphate  is  a  Class  III  (high  solubility,  low  permeability)  and  efavirenz  is  a  Class  II  (low 
solubility, high permeability) according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification system (BCS). Solubility of 
emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil phosphate are quite high and independent of pH; whereas efavirenz 
shows pH dependent solubility. Amounts of SLS to achieve sink conditions decrease inversely with pH. In 
Assessment report

order  to  select  the  most  suitable  dissolution  conditions,  the  solubility  and  the  influence  of  pH  on  the 
solubility of the three active substances were determined. Individual solubility of active substances in 
purified  water,  0.1N  HCl  and  acetate  buffers  of  pH  4.5  and  6.8  with  and  without  surfactant  were 
evaluated.  The  lowest  amount  of  surfactant  to  be  used  to  dissolve  it  in  the  dissolution  media  was 
determined,  Considering  SLS  and  phosphate  interactions,  acetate  buffers  were  preferred  instead  of 
phosphate  buffers  for  pHs  4.5  and  6.8.  Dissolution  behaviour  of  efavirenz  was  the  limiting  factor  to 
determine the SLS amount in the media and it was observed that SLS did not affect the dissolved amounts 
of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil. It was also confirmed that, with the increase of pH, the amount 
of  SLS  to  achieve  complete  dissolution  decreased.    Based  on  the  results  of  solubility  and  dissolution 
method development studies, the proposed dissolution method (paddle apparatus, 100 rpm, 1000 ml, 
2%  SLS  in  water)  is  considered  sufficiently  justified.  The  discriminatory  power  of  the  method  was 
adequately demonstrated with regard to the efavirenz particle size, changes to the composition of the 
emtricitabine tenofovir layer and tablet hardness. 
It  was  further  confirmed  that  the  Opadry  coating  material,  a  polyvinyl  alcohol  (PVA)  based  solid 
preparation, for tablet coating, has no effect on the dissolution behaviour of the tablets.   
The impurity profiles of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva and Atripla were determined 
using an HPLC method. The impurity profiles can be considered essentially similar based on the submitted 
results. 
The bioequivalence of the generic vs the reference product was demonstrated by bioequivalence study 
ZNV-PO-673. Comparison of dissolution profiles of four pilot batches of the test drug product (including 
the biobatch) showed that all three active substances release was more than 85 % within 15 minutes in 
all tested media.  
Since the drug product contained relatively high contents of active substances which had poor flowability, 
low bulk density and consequently were weak in compressibility direct compression method was not tried. 
Additionally, efavirenz and tenofovir disoproxil phosphate had the tendency to stick on metal surfaces 
which had to be eliminated via granulation techniques. It is also known from the literature and from the 
basic patent of Atripla that the original product is a bi-layer tablet. For Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
Disoproxil  Zentiva  the  same  approach  was 
followed.  Both  the  manufacturing  method  for 
emtricitabine/tenofovir  layer  (dry  granulation  by  roller  compaction)  and  that  for  efavirenz  layer  (wet 
granulation by high-shear granulation) are widely used processes of granulation in the pharmaceutical 
industry and are conducted to improve flowability and density of powder mixture, uniformity of contents 
and compressibility.  
The  primary  packaging  of  Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir  Disoproxil  Zentiva  600/200/245  mg  film 
coated  tablets  was  selected  as  HDPE  bottles  with  child  resistant  polypropylene  (PP)  screw  caps  with 
induction heat sealing (with aluminium foil). Three grams of silica gel is added to each bottle as desiccant 
to  reduce  adventitious  headspace  moisture.  The  provided  stability  results  indicate  that  the  proposed 
packaging materials are suitable for the storage of the finished product. The primary packaging material 
complies with EU-Regulations No.10/2011 and No.1935/2004/EC. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of bilayer tablets comprises the following main steps: 
1.  Preparation  of  the  efavirenz  layer  by  weighing,  pre-mixing,  wet  granulation  (high  shear 
granulation), drying, sifting (oscillating mill), blending, lubrication (final blending). 
2.  Preparation  of  the  emtricitabine  /  tenofovir  disoproxil  layer  by  weighing,  sieving,  blending,  dry 
granulation (roller compaction), sifting (oscillating mill), blending, lubrication (final blending).

3.  Compression of bilayer tablets 
4.  Film coating of tablets 
5.  Packaging 
The manufacturing process follows the conventional approach for solid dosage forms, employing widely 
used,  non-specialized  manufacturing  equipment,  consistent  with  that  available  within  the  proposed 
manufacturer’s facilities. The manufacturing process is considered a standard process and it has been 
described satisfactorily. 
Based  on  the  submitted  risk  assessment  study  to  demonstrate  control  and  understanding  of  the 
manufacturing procedure, no critical steps in the manufacturing process of the finished product have been 
identified. The IPCs have been presented and are adequately justified. The control strategy ensures that 
the manufacturing process consistently delivers a product that meets the defined criteria for all release 
specifications.  
Holding times have been specified for final blend, core tablets and film coated tablets. 
Three batch sizes intended for commercial use have been clearly stated. The process has been validated 
on four batches at the minimum proposed commercial batch size and the validation report was presented. 
The process will be further validated on the first three production larger scale batches. 
In conclusion, it is considered that the manufacturing process is sufficiently robust to provide assurance 
that film-coated tablets of consistent quality, complying with the designated specification, are produced. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  and  shelf  life  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  and  limits  for 
appearance  (visual),  identification  of  efavirenz,  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  disoproxil  (HPLC,  TLC), 
identification of colourants (chemical), identification of phosphoric acid (HPLC), disintegration (Ph. Eur.), 
water content (Ph. Eur.), hardness (Ph. Eur.), average mass (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. 
Eur.),  dissolution  (HPLC),  assay  of  efavirenz,  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  disoproxil  (HPLC),  related 
substances of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil (HPLC) and microbial purity (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed specification is acceptable and provides an adequate control of the product quality. The 
analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  validated.  Satisfactory  information 
regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of finished product has been presented.  
Batch  analysis  data  of  four  commercial  scale  batches  used  for  process  validation  were  presented.  All 
batches are representative of the commercial formula and process and the results show that the finished 
product meets the proposed specification limits. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  of  four  commercial  scale  batches  used  for  process  validation  stored  under  long  term 
conditions for up to 18 months (25 °C / 60% RH), for up to 12 months under intermediate conditions 
(30 °C / 65% RH) and up to 18 months under 30 °C / 75% RH and for up to six months under accelerated 
conditions  (40 °C/ 75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  stability  batches  are 
identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for 
marketing. Stability commitment to conduct stability studies with the first three commercial batches of 
Efavirenz/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil film coated tablet was provided and this is acceptable.  
Samples were tested for appearance, average tablet weight, water content, dissolution, assay, related 
substances and microbial purity. The methods used were the same as for release testing and are stability

indicating. There is no significant change in any of  characteristic of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil 
Zentiva 200/245 mg film coated tablets as tested at any time point. No trends were observed. 
Stability data of in-use stability testing has been provided demonstrating that the product remains stable 
for 30 days following first opening of the container, when stored at laboratory temperature, exposed to 
daylight. The product does not require any special temperature storage conditions. In-use shelf-life 30 
days was established.   
A photostability study was carried out on one commercial scale batch of finished product according to ICH 
Q1B Guideline. Light exposure did not result in any significant change. Additional storage restrictions are 
not considered necessary. 
Forced degradation / stress studies were carried out on one commercial scale batch of finished product in 
order  to  demonstrate  the  stability  indicating  nature  of  the  assay  and  related  substances  methods. 
Samples of tenofovir and emtricitabine drug substances and the drug product were tested after exposure 
to  acidic,  basic,  oxidative  conditions,  elevated  temperature,  and  UV  light.  The  results  of  degradation 
studies together with mass balance calculations demonstrate that that the assay and related substances 
methods are stability indicating.  
Based on the provided stability data, the proposed shelf life of 24 months stored in the original package 
in order to protect from moisture, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No materials of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of the finished product. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which 
is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/454542/2017  
Page 22/39 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No full Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Efavirenz-Emtricitabine-Tenofovir disoproxil manufactured by Zentiva k.s. is considered 
unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for  
Efavirenz-Emtricitabine-Tenofovir disoproxil containing products and the exposure of the environment to 
the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the data provided, the active substances efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil as 
well as the drug product comply with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) requirements for 
the quality concerning the impurities and residual solvents. There are no safety risks associated with the 
impurities, with respect to the use of the drug substance and the finalised drug product. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant 
guideline and additional non clinical studies were not considered necessary. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for film-coated tablet containing efavirenz / emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil. To 
support the marketing authorisation application the applicant conducted one bioequivalence study with 
cross-over design under fasting conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) as well as the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09) in their current version, are of particular relevance.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption

Test and reference products  
Test product : Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva 600/200/245 film-coated tablets 
manufactured by Zentiva k.s. (batch No. P01092015, manufacturing date: 04/09/2015, exp. date: 
03/03/2016)  
Reference product:  Atripla 600/200/245film-coated tablets manufactured by Bristol-Meers Squibb and 
Gilead Science Limited, Ireland (Batch No:12AT096D, exp. date 11/2016). 
The assay content of the test product does not differ more than 5% from reference product Atripla for all 
drug substances. 
Population studied 
Subjects were male or postmenopausal or surgically sterile female, at least 18 years of age but not older 
than 55 years. The main inclusion criteria were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
light-, non- or ex-smokers 
body mass index (BMI) ≥18.50 kg/m2 and <30.00 kg/m2 
no clinically significant abnormality found in the 12-lead ECG performed at study entry negative 
pregnancy test for female subjects 
healthy according to medical history, complete physical examination (including vital signs) and 
laboratory tests (general biochemistry, haematology and urinalysis) 
•  menopausal status was confirmed by measurement of estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone 
(FSH), and absence of menses for one year 
A total of 50 subjects were included in this study and, after randomization, 49 (98%) subjects received 
the Test and 49 (98%) subjects received the Reference. 
Assessment report  
EMA/454542/2017  
Page 25/39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Two subjects (4%) discontinued the study; one for personal reasons (related to clinical events), and one 
due to safety reasons (investigator’s decision); 48 (96%) subjects completed the study. 
One subject was withdrawn from the study before dosing of period 2 for safety reasons (due to severe 
gastroenteritis judged possibly related to the administration of Atripla) as decided by the study 
investigator and only received the Reference in period 1. 
One subject withdrew consent from the study before dosing of period 2 for personal reasons related to 
clinical events (mild nausea and mild diarrhoea). The subject only received the Test in period 1. 
Protocol deviations were documented during the study. Time deviations that were equal to or greater than 
2 minutes were adjusted in the pharmacokinetic analysis to reflect actual sampling times. The other time 
deviations were considered to have a negligible impact on the assessment of bioequivalence and were not 
accounted for in the calculation of the pharmacokinetic parameters. The protocol deviations reported for 
the subjects included in the analysis were judged to have no significant impact on the bioequivalence 
assessment or subject’s safety. 
Analytical methods 
The method for the determination of Efavirenz, Emtricitabine and Tenofovir in human plasma using HPLC 
with MS/MS detection has met acceptance criteria with respect to specificity, sensitivity, precision, 
accuracy, matrix effect, linearity, percent extraction yields and dilution integrity, spanning a theoretical 
concentration range of 25.0 ng/mL to 6000.0 ng/mL for Efavirenz, 10.0 ng/mL to 4000.0 ng/mL for 
Emtricitabine and 2.50 ng/mL to 800.00 ng/mL for Tenofovir. Stability evaluations in matrix and solutions 
have also met acceptance criteria, demonstrating insignificant degradation of Efavirenz, Emtricitabine, 
Tenofovir, Efavirenz-D5, Emtricitabine-15N-D2 and Tenofovir-D6 over the specified storage durations 
and conditions. 
Pharmacokinetic variables 
A single 600 mg/200 mg/245 mg oral dose of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir was administered under 
fasting conditions in each study period. The drug administrations were separated by a wash-out of 35 
calendar days. 
In each study period, 24 blood samples were collected. The first blood sample was collected prior to drug 
administration while the others were collected up to 72 hours after drug administration. 
Statistical methods 
The main absorption and disposition parameters were calculated using a non-compartmental approach 
with a log-linear terminal phase assumption. The trapezoidal rule was used to estimate area under the 
curve. The terminal phase estimation was based on maximizing the coefficient of determination. 
Efavirenz: 
The pharmacokinetic parameters of interest for this study were to be the ln-transformed Cmax and 
AUC0-72. Tmax was to be calculated and provided for information purposes only. 
Emtricitabine and tenofovir: 
The pharmacokinetic parameters of interest for this study were to be the ln-transformed Cmax and 
AUC0-T. Other parameters including Tmax, AUC0-∞, Residual Area, λZ and Thalf were to be calculated and 
provided for information purposes only. 
Assessment report  
EMA/454542/2017

The statistical analysis was based on a parametric ANOVA model of the pharmacokinetic parameters; the 
two-sided 90% confidence interval of the ratio of geometric means for the Cmax, AUC0-T, AUC0-72 and 
AUC0-∞ was based on ln-transformed data; Tmax was based on a non-parametric approach. 
ANOVA model: 
fixed factors: sequence, period, treatment, subject (nested within sequence) 
Criteria for Bioequivalence: 
Statistical inference of efavirenz was to be based on a bioequivalence approach using the following 
standards: 
The ratio of geometric LSmeans with corresponding 90% confidence interval calculated from the 
exponential of the difference between the Test and Reference for the ln-transformed parameters Cmax and 
AUC0-72 were all to be within the 80.00 to 125.00% bioequivalence range 
Statistical inference of emtricitabine and tenofovir was to be based on a bioequivalence approach using 
the following standards: 
The ratio of geometric LSmeans with corresponding 90% confidence interval calculated from the 
exponential of the difference between the Test and Reference for the ln-transformed parameters Cmax and 
AUC0-T were all to be within the 80.00 to 125.00% equivalence range. 
Results 
All 50 subjects were analyzed and 48 subjects were included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical 
analysis.

Therefore, the Test formulation (Efavirenz + Emtricitabine + Tenofovir Disoproxil (Phosphate) 
600/200/245 mg film-coated tablets, Zentiva, k.s., Czech Republic) was judged to be bioequivalent to the 
Reference formulation (Atripla [Efavirenz + Emtricitabine + Tenofovir Disoproxil (Fumarate)]) 
600/200/245 mg film-coated tablets, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Gilead Sciences limited, Ireland) under 
fasting conditions. 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study (ZNV-P0-673) Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil 
600/200/245 mg is considered to be essentially similar to Atripla.  
Safety data 
A total of 72 adverse events were reported by 32 (64%) of the 50 subjects who participated in this study. 
Of these events, 41 occurred after administration of the Test and the other 31 after administration of the 
Reference. 
Twenty-one (43%) of the 49 subjects who received the Test experienced AEs, the most common of which 
was somnolence (9 subjects; 18%). The AEs experienced following the administration of the Test were 
mild (37/41; 90%) or moderate in severity (4/41; 10%).

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of Efavirenz+Emtricitabine+Tenofovir Disoproxil (Phosphate) 
600/200/245 mg film coated tablets of Zentiva k.s. The reference product Atripla is indicated for 
treatment of HIV infection. No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate 
summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered 
sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics 
and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered

sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with a single dose, two-period, two-sequence, two-way 
cross-over design under fasting conditions. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the 
bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. The 
analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation Efavirenz+Emtricitabine+Tenofovir Disoproxil (Phosphate) 600/200/245 mg film 
coated tablets of met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with Atripla. The 
point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all 
contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two 
formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond 
those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is favourable in the 
following indication: 
Treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults aged 18 years and over with 
virologic suppression to HIV-1 RNA levels of < 50 copies/ml on their current combination antiretroviral 
therapy for more than three months. Patients must not have experienced virological failure on any prior 
antiretroviral therapy and must be known not to have harboured virus strains with mutations conferring 
significant resistance to any of the three components contained in Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva prior to initiation of their first antiretroviral treatment regimen.

•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall ensure that all physicians who are expected to 
prescribe/use Efavirenz/Emtricitabine /Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva are provided with a physician 
educational pack containing the following:  
• The Summary of Product Characteristics  
• HIV renal educational brochure, including the creatinine clearance slide ruler  
The HIV renal educational brochure should contain the following key messages:  
• That there is an increased risk of renal disease in HIV infected patients associated with tenofovir 
disoproxil -containing products such as Efavirenz/Emtricitabine /Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  
• Efavirenz/Emtricitabine /Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is not recommended for patients with moderate or 
severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min)  
 • That use of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine /Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should be avoided with concomitant or 
recent use of nephrotoxic medicinal products. If Efavirenz/Emtricitabine /Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is 
used with nephrotoxic medicinal products, renal function should be closely monitored according to the 
recommended schedule.  
• That patients should have their baseline renal function assessed prior to initiating 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine /Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva therapy 
 • The importance of regular monitoring of renal function during Efavirenz/Emtricitabine /Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva therapy 
 • Recommended schedule for monitoring renal function considering the presence or absence of additional 
risk factors for renal impairment 
 • If serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/dl or creatinine clearance decreases during therapy to < 50 ml/min 
then renal function must be re-evaluated within one week. If creatinine clearance is confirmed as < 50 
ml/min or serum phosphate decreases to < 1.0 mg/dl then Efavirenz/Emtricitabine /Tenofovir disoproxil 
Zentiva therapy should be interrupted. Interrupting treatment with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine /Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva should also be considered in case of progressive decline of renal function when no other 
cause has been identified. 
 • Instructions on the use of the creatinine clearance slide ruler

Summary of risk management plan for Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine 
Seqirus (aH5N1) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus. The 
RMP  details  important  risks  of  Zoonotic  Influenza  Vaccine  Seqirus,  how  these  risks  can  be 
minimised, and how more information will be obtained about Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus 
risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine  Seqirus summary of  product  characteristics (SmPC) and its package 
leaflet (PL) give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Zoonotic 
Influenza Vaccine Seqirus should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus should be read in the context 
of all this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), available on the 
EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/zoonotic-influenza-vaccine-seqirus  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Zoonotic 
Influenza Vaccine Seqirus RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Zoonotic  Influenza  Vaccine  Seqirus  is  a  zoonotic  influenza  vaccine  authorised  for  an  active 
immunisation against H5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus in adults (18 years of age and older). It 
contains an inactivated, surface antigen monovalent, influenza vaccine adjuvanted with MF59C.1. 
It is to be administered as two doses of 0.5 mL by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle. 
One  dose of 0.5  mL should be given at an  elected  date and a second  dose of 0.5  mL after an 
interval of at least 3 weeks. 
Further information about the evaluation of Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus benefits will be 
available in Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus EPAR, upon the application approval, including in 
its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage.  
II. 
Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to  minimise  or  further 
characterise the risks 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Important risks of Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus, together with measures to minimise such 
risks and the proposed studies for learning more about Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus risks, 
are outlined below.  
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:  
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL and 
SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;  
• Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;  
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly;  
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a  medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with  or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.  
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus are risks that need special risk management 
activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus. Potential risks 
are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data,  but  this  association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing 
and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

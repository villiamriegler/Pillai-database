Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Bimzelx 
bimekizumab 
On 26 April 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Bimzelx. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is UCB Pharma S.A. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication to include treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adults who have 
had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic 
drugs (DMARDs). 
For information, the full indications for Bimzelx will therefore be as follows:2 
Plaque psoriasis 
Bimzelx is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are 
candidates for systemic therapy. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Bimzelx, alone or in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the treatment of 
active psoriatic arthritis in adults who have had an inadequate response or who have 
been intolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 
days from adoption of the opinion

Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation 
the existing warning on nephrotoxicity for the fixed-dose 
combinations of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) authorised for 
the treatment of HIV infected patients with the scope of 
improving renal safety. The package leaflet has been 
updated accordingly. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

The key SmPC text resulting from this variation reads as 
following a worksharing procedure according to 
Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008. 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to add 
‘crystal nephropathy’ to the list of adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs) with frequency rare based on 
recent post-marketing data; the Package Leaflets are 
updated accordingly. 
In addition, sections 4.4 and 4.6 of the SmPC were 
updated to implement the recommendation of the 
CHMP to remove the disease information relating to 
sexual transmission of HIV and to amend the 
sections related to breast-feeding; the Package

[…] 
PREZISTA/REZOLSTA/SYMTUZA: Corticosteroids primarily 
metabolised by CYP3A (including betamethasone, 
budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone, prednisone, 
triamcinolone). 
REZOLSTA/SYMTUZA: Based on theoretical considerations 
DRV/COBI is expected to increase these corticosteroid 
plasma concentrations. (CYP3A inhibition) 
Concomitant use of boosted 
PREZISTA/REZOLSTA/SYMTUZA and corticosteroids (all 
routes of administration) that are metabolised by CYP3A 
may increase the risk of development of systemic 
corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and 
adrenal suppression. 
Co-administration with CYP3A-metabolised corticosteroids 
is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the 
patient outweighs the risk, in which case patients should be 
monitored for systemic corticosteroid effects. 
Alternative corticosteroids which are less dependent on 
CYP3A metabolism e.g. beclomethasone should be 
considered, particularly for long term use.

In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) took the opportunity to update section 4.2 of 
the SmPC and Package Leaflet to include advice in 
the event of vomiting in line with the approved 
Genvoya SmPC and make minor editorial changes in 
the SmPC; as well as to update the list of local

Update of section 4.3 of the SmPC of Prezista,

concomitant use with dabigatran, as well as to 
update section 4.5 of the SmPC of Prezista, Rezolsta

dabigatran. Therefore, concomitant treatment with 
dabigatran is contraindicated. 
Edoxaban is a substrate of P glycoprotein, which can be 
inhibited by darunavir when used in combination with low-

glycoprotein and/or BCRP. Glecaprevir is also a substrate of

Updated RMPs (version 25.6 for Prezista, 4.6 for

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
implement the template version 2 for the Prezista

removal of observational study on growth in children

study.  The pharmacokinetic data demonstrate that mean 
exposure (AUC) of darunavir boosted with cobicistat was 
56% and 50% lower during the 2nd and 3rd trimester of 
pregnancy, respectively, compared with 6 to 12 weeks 
postpartum. Mean darunavir Cmin concentrations were 
~90% lower during the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy 
as compared to postpartum. Mean darunavir Cmin 
concentrations of 168-184 ng/ml for DRV/COBI during the 
2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy were below the 
previously targeted 550 ng/ml (EPAR Prezista) and 
considerably lower than the mean darunavir Cmin 
concentrations of 1100-1200 ng/ml for the DRV/RTV arm of 
study TMC114HIV3015. 
Exposure of cobicistat was 63% and 49% lower during the 
2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy, respectively, 
compared with 6 to 12 weeks postpartum. As the exposure 
of cobicistat is reduced in pregnant women, probably the 
boosting by cobicistat is no longer maximal. 
In view of the observed low exposure values of 
darunavir/cobicistat during pregnancy, the CHMP agreed to 
strongly recommend against the use of darunavir/cobicistat 
during pregnancy. This should apply to pregnant women 
who are already on a DRV/COBI containing regimen, as 
well as to those who are naïve to DRV/COBI.

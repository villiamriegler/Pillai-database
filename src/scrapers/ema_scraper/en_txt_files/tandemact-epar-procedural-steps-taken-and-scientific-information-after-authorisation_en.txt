Intervention after Stroke (IRIS) trial (IRIS Report) have 
also been provided. 
The results of this study did not show a statistically 
significant association between pioglitazone and prostate 
cancer. The MAH provided available histological data on 
cases of prostate cancer. Though the available data is very 
limited, the results of the histological data from all sources 
available to the MAH (Safety database, Pioglitazone_5018, 
PROactive Extension study and IRIS study) suggest that 
the majority of prostate cancers are prostatic 
adenocarcinomas in keeping with the common histological 
type seen in prostate cancer. Though the available data is 
very limited, there remain uncertainties in relation to any 
causal association between prostate cancer and 
pioglitazone therapy. The Marketing Authorisation Holder 
will continue to closely monitor this issue and will report 
should relevant data emerge.

SmPC, 
Based on the review of the available information the CHMP 
Labelling and 
is of the opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this 
PL 
medicinal product continues to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considered that the 
Page 15/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
benefit risk profile of Tandemact continues to be 
favourable, but considers that its safety profile is to be 
closely monitored for the following reasons: 
The use of pioglitazone/glimepride is associated with a 
number of identified adverse events (cardiac failure, weight 
gain, macular oedema, hypoglycaemia, carcinogenicity in 
particular bladder cancer and bone fractures) as well as 
potential risks (hepatic events, rhabdomyolysis, 
anaphylactoid reactions, blood disorders, cerebrovascular 
ischaemia, cardiac ischaemia) to be closely monitored and 
to be reported in 6 monthly PSURs and included in the Risk 
Management Plan. With regard to the identified risk of 
bladder cancer, the CHMP has reviewed the totality of the 
available data on pioglitazone, including preclinical studies, 
clinical studies, post-marketing data and epidemiological 
studies within an Art. 20 referal procedure and concluded 
that the available data consistently identified a small 
increased risk of bladder cancer associated with the use of 
pioglitazone. Therefore, the CHMP decided that the MAH

and its major metabolites were not genotoxic, as 
established in a comprehensive battery of genotoxicity 
assays. Through re-examination of retained bladder 
specimens in fixative, calculi were found in the bladder and 
it was hypothesized that urinary calculi formation with 
subsequent irritation, hyperplasia and metaplasia may be 
responsible for the carcinogenic responses observed in 
male rats. It was concluded that the administration of 
pioglitazone may be directly responsible for an increased 
incidence of hyperplastic changes in the bladder of the rat.  
The presence of microcrystals exacerbates the hyperplastic 
response but is not considered to be the cause of the 
hyperplastic changes. 
Updated part of Section 5.3 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristic: 
Pioglitazone was devoid of genotoxic potential in a 
comprehensive battery of in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity 
assays. An increased incidence of hyperplasia (males and 
females) and tumours (males) of the urinary bladder 
epithelium was apparent in rats treated with pioglitazone 
for up to 2 years.  
The formation and presence of urinary calculi with 
subsequent irritation and hyperplasia was postulated as the 
mechanistic basis for the observed tumourigenic response 
in the male rat. A 24-month mechanistic study in male rats 
demonstrated that administration of pioglitazone resulted 
in an increased incidence of hyperplastic changes in the 
bladder. Dietary acidification significantly decreased but did 
not abolish the incidence of tumours. The presence of 
microcrystals, although exacerbating the hyperplastic

response is not considered to be the primary cause of the 
hyperplastic changes. The relevance to humans of the 
tumourigenic findings in the male rat cannot be excluded.  
There was no tumorige

Glibenclamide, a sulfonylurea agent, is known to be directly 
responsible for haemolytic anaemia in patients with G6PD 
deficiency. After the review of other sulphonylureas, the 
PhVWP was of the opinion that haemolytic anaemia in 
patients with G6PD deficiency is a class effect of 
sulfonylurea agents.  
The PhVWP and the CHMP considered that given a potential 
class effect, a warning statement should be added in the 
product information of all sulphonylurea agents. Therefore, 
the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) for Tandemact 
was requested to submit this type II variation in order to 
include a warning regarding the increased risk of 
haemolytic anaemia in patients with G6PD deficiency taking

with insulin, primarily as a result of clinical trial data from 
the completion of a large macrovascular outcome study of 
pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
known as 'PROactive' (protocol reference AD-4833/EC444), 
performed following a commitment made to the CPMP in 
June 2000.  
The MAH also submitted, as part of the present variation 
application, data from three efficacy and safety studies of 
pioglitazone used in combination with insulin. 
The main concern of the CHMP was the fact that both 
insulin and pioglitazone alone are associated with fluid

retention and heart failure. However, it appears that 
combination therapy with pioglitazone and insulin is 
associated with an increased risk of heart failure, but not 
an increase in mortality, in particular from the sequelae of 
heart failure. The degree of heart failure would most likely 
be mild, and could be monitored symptomatically or by 
weight gain. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the 
exposure data presented was adequate to support the 
deletion of the contraindication with insulin, provided that 
the risk of heart failure is reflected in detail in the product 
information and in the Risk Management Plan. 
Section 4.3 of the Summary of Products Characteristics was 
updated to remove the contraindication for the use of 
pioglitazone in combination with insulin. Sections 4.4, 4.8 
and 5.1 were consequently updated to add information on 
the risk of heart failure. The relevant sections of the

the results of the mentioned study.

(pioglitazone), the MAH committed to perform a large 
macrovascular outcome study of pioglitazone in patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The MAH submitted the 
results of this macrovascular outcome study (PROactive 
study). 
The PROactive study failed regarding it's pre-specified 
primary endpoint, and any benefit suggested by the 
secondary endpoint suggests an effect in a type 2 diabetic 
population with extensive disease and being treated 
concurrently with multiple anti-diabetic and cardiovascular 
medicines, and treated with 45mg of pioglitazone. As would 
be expected, there were increases in weight in the 
Page 22/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pioglitazone group, and an increase in hypoglycaemia 
corresponding with better control of diabetes. There was 
also an increase in cardiac failure in the pioglitazone group. 
Although these were no new safety issues, the previous 
safety concerns relating to weigh gain, oedema and heart 
failure were confirmed. 
Although the PROactive study suggested that 
administration of pioglitazone was not associated with an 
increased cardiovascular risk, the study failed to document 
a clear benefit, and the safety concerns mentioned above 
remain, particularly in the context of the new indication of 
pioglitazone in combination with insulin. 
The CHMP agreed that some information on the PROactive 
study, which was a significant and well-conducted study, 
could be introduced in section 5.1 of the Summary of 
Product Characteristics.

Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) to provide 
information on all cases of fractures in patients taking 
pioglitazone, as well as an overview of all clinical and non-
clinical studies with glitazones in which bone metabolism 
was investigated or in which an effect on bone has been 
reported. 
Upon evaluation of the data provided by the MAH, the 
CHMP was of the view that there are theoretical reasons 
why thiazolidinediones could be associated with increased 
risk of fracture. Severity and duration of diabetes are risks 
factors for osteoporosis, and it is difficult to draw 
conclusions from the post-marketing data as fractures not 
surprisingly occur in older female patients. However, 
considering the clinical trial database, there appears to be a 
small but definite increased risk of fracture in the female 
patients treated with pioglitazone and analyses of the 
pooled data from controlled, double-blind, randomised, 
comparative clinical studies suggest a relative increase in 
fracture risk with time. 
Based on the available data, the CHMP requested the MAH 
to update the product information for Actos to reflect the 
risk of bone fractures. Sections "Special warnings and 
precautions for use" and "Undesirable effects" of the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) were updated 
with the available data from clinical trials regarding bone 
fractures and with a warning reflecting that the risk of 
fractures should be considered in the long-term care of 
women treated with pioglitazone.  
The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly.

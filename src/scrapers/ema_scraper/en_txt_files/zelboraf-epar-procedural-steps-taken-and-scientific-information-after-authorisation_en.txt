dose could not be determined. Although transient tumour 
regressions were seen, the best overall response rate

was best overall response rate (BORR) in the brain of 
metastatic melanoma patients with previously untreated 
brain metastases, as assessed by an independent review 
committee (IRC). Evaluation of the efficacy of vemurafenib 
using BORR in the brain of previously treated patients was 
a secondary objective. 16 (17.8%) patients with previously 
untreated metastases and 10 (17.9%) patients with 
previously treated metastases responded. The results were

from the ASNM over concerns on reported cases of 
malignancies observed in patients treated with 
vemurafenib. The literature review retrieved two cases of 
vemurafenib-induced malignancy progression in patients 
treated with vemurafenib. In both cases, RAS mutation was 
implicated, confirmed in one case (CMML) and suspected in 
the other case (pancreatic adenocarcinoma).  From the 
MAH safety database, 450 cases were retrieved in the 
search for malignancy cases. 27 cases were classified as: 
new malignancies (n=23); aggravation of existing 
malignancies (n=3) and recurrence of past malignant 
neoplasm (n=1). Tumours from four of the 27 cases (15%) 
were shown to have confirmed genetic mutations of 
interest (EGFR, NRAS, CDKN2A). In addition, the MAH 
performed a cumulative review from the safety database as

2C8 and 2E1 by vemurafenib on human liver microsomal 
cytochrome P450-mediated metabolic activities were 
compared with the effect of specific control inhibitors. The 
results showed that vemurafenib did not strongly inhibit 
CYP2A6, 2B6 or 2E1 (IC50 values were >100 μM) in vitro 
but was shown to inhibit CYP2C8 with an IC50 value of 
approximately 12 μM. Based on the results, vemurafenib is 
unlikely to cause clinically relevant inhibition of cytochrome 
CYP2A6, 2B6 or 2E1 in vivo but could potentially inhibit 
CYP2C8 and impact exposure of concomitant drugs whose 
major clearance route relies of this pathway. Thus, the

information on CYP2C8.

than consistent intake of vemurafenib with or a short time

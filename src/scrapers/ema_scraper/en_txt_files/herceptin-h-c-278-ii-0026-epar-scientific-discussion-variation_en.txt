Introduction 
Trastuzumab is currently approved for the treatment of Her2 over-expressing metastatic breast cancer, 
either as monotherapy if therapy with anthracycline and taxanes has failed or is contraindicated, or in 
combination  with  paclitaxel  inpatients  who  have  not  received  prior  chemotherapy  for  metastatic 
disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable or in combination with docetaxel in patients who 
have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. 
The  MAH  has  submitted  data  from  the  BO16348  (HERA)  trial  to  support  an  extension  of  the 
indication  to  include  adjuvant  treatment  of  patients  with  Her2  positive,  early  breast  cancer  after 
surgery and completion of chemotherapy.  
Clinical aspects 
Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics  of  trastuzumab  has  been  evaluated  in  patients  with  metastatic  breast  cancer 
previously.  Posology  in  metastatic  breast  cancer  is  a  loading  dose  of  4  mg/kg  followed  by  weekly 
infusion  at  a  dose  of  2  mg/kg.  Initially  pharmacokinetic  analysis  was  performed  using  a  one-
compartmental model in phase I, II and III studies. This analysis gave a half-life estimate of 6-8 days 
which was included in the initial SPC. A reassessment using a two-compartmental model gave a half-
life estimate of 28.5 days.  
The BO16348 (HERA) trial contained a pharmacokinetic sub-study because of a different posology. 
Additional data using the same posology in the metastatic breast cancer setting have been submitted. 
Methods 
Serum  samples  were  assayed  for  trastuzumab  concentration  by  a  validated  enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The lower limit of quantification of the assay was 0.15 ng/mL. 
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  derived  by  model-independent  methods.  The  principal  parameters 
of  interest  from  cycles  1  and  13  were  Cmin,  Cmax,  tmax,  AUC  and  Cl.  The  principal  parameter  of 
interest from cycle 18 was the terminal half-life (t½). Trough (pre-dose) concentrations from cycles 2, 
3 and 13 were compared with those obtained previously from patients with metastatic breast cancer at 
the  same  time  points.  Data  from  metastatic  breast  cancer  studies  WO16229  and  BO15935  were 
combined and a graphical comparison with data from the HERA study was made. 
Forty-four patients from the 1 year treatment group entered the PK substudy. Treatment consisted of a 
8  mg/kg  loading  dose  followed  by  6  mg/kg  every  three  weeks.  Blood  samples  for  pharmacokinetic 
analysis  were  collected  pre-dose  and  at  1.5,  2,  3,  4,  6,  8,  24,  96,  168  and  336  h  after  the  start  of 
infusion at cycles 1 and 13. In addition, a pre-dose sample was taken prior to dosing on day 1 of cycles 
2, 3 and 14. On the day of administration of the final dose of Trastuzumab (cycle 18 at the end of year 
1)  samples  were  collected  pre-dose  and  at  1.5,  2,  3,  4,  6,  8  and  24  hours  post-dose,  with  further 
samples taken on days 7, 14, 28 and 42 after the final Trastuzumab administration.

Discussion on pharmacokinetics  
A different posology has been chosen for the treatment of patients with early breast cancer. Instead of 
a  4  mg/kg  loading  dose  and  2  mg/kg  weekly  dose  an  8  mg/kg  loading  dose  and  a  6  mg/kg  dose  is 
administered  every  3  weeks.  The  results  from  the  ongoing  PK  study  are  preliminary,  in  particular 
population PK analyses will be performed after completion of the HERA study.

Accumulation ratios, median trough concentrations and drug concentration profiles at week 13 and 18 
indicate that steady state has  been reached by week 13, the exact time-point prior to week 13 is not 
known.  Accumulation  ratios  and  median  trough  concentrations  are  similar  to  the  results  obtained  in 
studies in patients with metastatic breast cancer using identical posology. 
Half-life  at  cycle  18  was  16  days,  calculated  using  a  non-compartmental  model.  Although  this  is  in 
disagreement to population PK analysis in the metastatic setting, these results should be regarded with 
caution because of low number of individuals (n=8). Final analysis is pending after completion of the 
HERA study. 
No data comparing efficacy for the different posologies have been provided. 
Clinical efficacy 
The MAH submitted data from one pivotal trial (HERA, BO16438) investigating trastuzumab in an 
adjuvant setting after completed chemotherapy and data from two studies investigating trastuzumab 
concurrent to adjuvant chemotherapy (NSABP B-31, NCCTG N9831). 
Main study HERA (BO16438) 
HERA is a multi-centre, randomised, open label, parallel group study comparing observation to one or 
two years of treatment with trastuzumab. The study was conducted worldwide  with the exception of 
the USA. Patients were enrolled at 462 centers in 39 countries.

Trastuzumab  treatment  consisted  of  an  8  mg/kg  loading  dose  and  a  6  mg/kg  dose  that  was 
administered every 3 weeks. Patients were randomised to either observation or Trastuzumab for one or 
two  years.  Concomitant  treatment  with  tamoxifen  or  anastrozole  was  allowed  according  to  centre 
practice.

Primary  objectives  were:  To  compare  disease-free  survival  in  patients  with  HER2  over-expressing 
breast cancer who have completed acceptable adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, if applicable, 
and who have been randomized to trastuzumab for one year versus no trastuzumab. 
Secondary objectives were:  
-To  compare  overall  survival  in  patients  randomized  to  no  trastuzumab  versus  one  year  of 
trastuzumab, and in patients randomized to no trastuzumab versus two years of trastuzumab. 
-To  compare  recurrence-free  survival  in  patients  randomized  to  no  trastuzumab  versus  one  year  of 
trastuzumab, and in patients randomized to no trastuzumab versus two years of trastuzumab.  
-To compare distant disease-free survival in patients randomized to no trastuzumab versus one year of 
trastuzumab, and in patients randomized to no trastuzumab versus two years of trastuzumab. 
-To evaluate safety and tolerability of trastuzumab. 
-To compare the incidence of cardiac dysfunction in patients treated and not treated with trastuzumab. 
•  Primary endpoint 
The  primary endpoint  was  disease-free  survival  (DFS)  defined  as  the  time  from  randomisation  until 
the first event. An event was defined as any loco-regional or distant recurrence of breast cancer, the 
development  of  secondary  primary  cancer  other  than  basal  or  squamous  carcinoma  of  the  skin  and 
carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or death from any cause without documentation of one of these events. 
Lobular  carcinoma  in  situ  was  not  considered  an  event.  The  diagnosis  of  a  first  breast  cancer 
recurrence  could  be  made  only  when  both  clinical  and  laboratory  findings  met  criteria  for  loco-
regional or distant recurrence. 
5 
 
 
 
 
•  Secondary endpoints 
Secondary  endpoints  included  overall  survival,  recurrence  free  survival  and  distant  disease-free 
survival.  Overall  survival  was  defined  from  time  of  randomisation  to  death  due  to  any  cause. 
Recurrence free survival was defined as the time from randomisation to the first local, regional and/or 
distant  tumour  recurrence.  Second  primary  cancers,  contralateral  breast  cancer,  and  deaths  without 
evidence  of  disease  were  treated  as  censoring  events.  Distant  disease-free  survival  is  defined  as  the 
time between randomisation and the date of the first distant tumour recurrence, second primary cancer, 
or  contralateral  breast  cancer,  whichever  occured  first.  Local  and  regional  recurrences  were  ignored 
for  calculating  distant  disease  free  survival.  Deaths  without  evidence  of  disease  were  treated  as 
censoring events. 
•  Sample size 
Sample size was calculated applying a (two-sided) Type I error of 0.025 and anticipating a 5 years 
disease free survival (DFS) rate of 65% in the observational arm, a 23% reduction in the risk of DFS 
following treatment with Trastuzumab and one interim analysis a total number of 951 events to be 
observed was calculated in order to achieve a power of 80% in a log-rank test. Assuming an 
annualized recruitment rate of 1992 patients per year over 2.25 years and a minimum follow-up period 
of 12 months this translates into a sample size of 1494 subjects per group (total: 4482). 
•  Randomisation 
Subjects were centrally randomized on a 1:1:1 basis (no Trastuzumab, 1 year Trastuzumab, 2 years 
Trastuzumab) using an interactive voice response system (IVRS). Randomization was stratified for the 
following factors:  
Nodal status 
1. Any nodal status, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (nodal status unknown prior to 
chemotherapy) 
2. No positive nodes, no neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
3. 1-3 nodes positive, no neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
4. >4 nodes positive, no neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
Adjuvant chemotherapy regimen 
1. no anthracyclines or taxanes

The study protocol planned for one interim efficacy analysis after half (475) of the required 951 events 
had been observed. The aim of this interim analysis was to compare DFS for patients randomized to 
one  year  of  Trastuzumab  versus  no  Trastuzumab  and  two  years  of  Trastuzumab  versus  no 
Trastuzumab.  The  interim  analysis  was  performed  by  an  independent  statistician  and  the  results 
presented to the IDMC.  
To account for the interim analysis an error-spending function of O’Brien-Fleming type was applied. 
The Bonferroni-Holm approach was used to account for the two comparisons vs. the observational 
arm. The significance levels for the most significant pair-wise comparison were 0.0010 for the interim 
analysis and 0.0247 for the final analysis assuring an overall significance level of 0.025 for the more 
significant pair-wise comparison. If significance was reached, the significance levels for the second 
pair-wise comparison were to be 0.0020 for the interim analysis and 0.0494 for the final analysis. The 
overall study-wide significance level for this procedure was 0.05. 
The pairwise comparisons were made using an unstratified log-rank test. The time course of events 
was described by Kaplan-Meier curves and two year DFS rates including their 95% confidence limits 
were given for each treatment group. Risk ratios and 95% confidence limits were given for each pair-
wise comparison. As the IDMC disclosed data from the observation arm and the 1 year Trastuzumab 
arm (but not from the 2 years Trastuzumab arm), all data displays in this report are limited to two arms 
(observational arm and 1 year Trastuzumab). 
Explorative subgroup analyses (e.g. for the stratification factors applied in treatment allocation) were 
performed to assess the consistency of results. 
Similar methods as for DFS were used to analyse the secondary parameter overall survival (OS), 
recurrence free survival (RFS), distant disease free survival (DDFS), time to recurrence (TTR), and 
time to distant recurrence (TTDR).  
All efficacy analyses in this report are based on the Full Analysis Set. 
RESULTS 
The  trial  was  started  on  30.11.2001  and  is  still  ongoing.  Recruitment  was  complete  in  March  2005 
with 5090 patients enrolled. The planned interim analysis was performed after 3386 patients had been 
included  in  the  trial,  1693  of  these  patients  were  randomised  to  the  observation  arm  and  1693  were 
randomised to the 1 year trastuzumab arm. 475 events had been recorded at this point. Disposition of 
patients is shown in the following flow diagram.

Prior and concomitant treatment 
All  patients  had  surgical  treatment,  approximately  one  half  had  breast  conserving  surgery  and  the 
other half had mastectomy. More than 95% in both groups had resection of axillary nodes and about 
half  had  adjuvant  endocrine  therapy  (tamoxifen,  aromatase  inhibitors,  LHRH-agonists,  ovarian 
ablation  and  combinations  thereof).  94%  of  patients  in  both  groups  had  received  anthracycline- 
containing chemotherapy regimen. A summary of adjuvant chemotherapy is table 8.

The primary endpoint of the HERA study is DFS. At the time of interim analysis 219 patients in the 
observation  arm  and  127  patients  in  the  trastuzumab  arm  had  an  event  defined  as  any  recurrence  of 
breast cancer, contralateral breast cancer, second non-breast malignancy or death from any cause (log-
rank test p<0.0001). The mean duration of follow-up was 12.4 months for the observation group and 
12.7 months for the trastuzumab group. Analysis survival by Kaplan-Meier curve (FAS population) is 
shown in the following figure. The  hazard ratio  is  0.54 (95% confidence interval 0.44-0.67).  The  2-
year disease-free survival rate is 78.2% in the observation group and 85.8% in the trastuzumab group.

Fig 5: 
Recurrence free survival 
At the time of interim analysis 208 (12.3%) patients in the observation arm compared to 113 (6.7%) 
patients  in  the  trastuzumab  arm  had  a  relapse  of  disease  (local,  regional  or  distant).  This  result  is 
statistically significant (log-rank test p<0.0001). The hazard ratio was 0.51 (95% CI 0.40-0.64).  
Distant disease-free survival 
At  the  time  of  interim  analysis  184  (10.9%)  patients  in  the  observation  arm  compared  to  99  (5.8%) 
patients  in  the  trastuzumab  arm  had  a  distant  recurrence  of  disease.  This  result  is  statistically 
significant (log-rank test p<0.0001). The hazard ratio was 0.50 (95% CI 0.39-0.64).  
SUPPORTIVE STUDIES 
Two additional studies are provided to support the claim for treatment in early breast cancer. NSABP 
B-31  and  NCCTG  N9831  are  two  randomised  phase  III  studies  comparing  adjuvant  chemotherapy 
with  doxorubicin  and  cyclophosphamide  followed  by  paclitaxel  with  and  without  trastuzumab  in 
patients  with  HER2  positive  breast  cancer.  Both  studies  were  independently  planned  but  of  similar 
design. Therefore a joint interim analysis was performed  
Methods 
Study  B-31  enrolled  women  with  HER2-positive,  early-stage,  node-positive  breast  cancer.  Study 
N9831 enrolled women with early-stage breast cancer who were at high risk of recurrence.  
Important inclusion criteria for both studies were: 
-Pathologic  diagnosis  of  adenocarcinoma  of  the  breast  with  strongly  positive  (3  +)  HER2  protein 
overexpression or HER2 gene amplification  
-Histologically  confirmed  node-positive  disease  or  (Study  N9831  only  following  the  May  2003 
amendment)  high-risk  node-negative disease (defined as tumour  size  >  1  cm  and  oestrogen  receptor 
[ER] and progesterone receptor [PR] negative, or tumour size > 2 cm regardless of hormone receptor 
status) 
-Left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  (LVEF)  greater  than  or  equal  to  the  lower  limit  of  normal  for  the 
local radiological facility 
-Complete resection of the primary breast tumour and axillary nodal dissection (sentinel node biopsy 
alone, if negative, was allowed on Study N9831) 
-84 days (12 weeks) between surgery and randomization 
12 
 
 
Both  studies  were  conducted  primarily  in  the  USA,  smaller  numbers  of  patients  were  recruited  in 
Canada, Guam, Lithuania, Peru, South Africa, United States, and Puerto Rico. 
Treatments 
Patients  received  four  3-week  cycles  of  doxorubicin  (60  mg/m²)/cyclophosphamide  (600  mg/m²) 
followed by paclitaxel (weekly 80 mg/m²or three-weekly 175 mg/m²) for 12 weeks. 
Patients randomized to Arm  2 of Study B-31  or  Arm  C of Study N9831  began trastuzumab  therapy 
concurrently with paclitaxel. The total duration of trastuzumab therapy was 52 weeks. 
The trastuzumab loading dose was 4 mg/kg and the weekly dose was 2 mg/kg. 
Fig 6: 
•  Objectives 
Primary  objective  for  the  planned  joint  interim  analysis  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  weekly 
trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (four cycles of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by 12 weeks 
of paclitaxel [weekly or every-3-week administration] plus weekly trastuzumab) versus chemotherapy 
alone  as  adjuvant  therapy for  women  with  early-stage,  HER2-positive  breast  cancer  as  measured  by 
disease-free survival. 
Co-primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  safety  of  combined  therapy  as  evidence  by  incidence  and 
severity of cardiac and non-cardiac events. 
Secondary objective was to evaluate efficacy as measured by overall survival. 
•  Sample size 
The joint analysis of Studies B-31 and N9831 included patients from Arms 1 and 2 of Study B-31 and 
patients  from  Arms  A  and  C  of  Study  N9831.  The  joint  analysis  was  designed  to  detect  a  25% 
decrease  in  the  event  rate  for  DFS  (the  primary  endpoint)  and  overall  survival  (the  secondary 
endpoint). To achieve 90% power against this alternative and have an overall one-sided 0.025 level of 
significance,  710  events,  accumulated  across  both  trials,  were  required.  A  formal  plan  for  interim 
analyses of efficacy was incorporated into the description of the joint analysis of the two studies. This 
plan was documented before any efficacy evaluations were done in either study.

The primary efficacy endpoint of the joint analysis was DFS. At the time of the first scheduled interim 
analysis to evaluate efficacy, 394 patients had experienced a DFS event. Of these, 261 patients were in 
the  chemotherapy  alone  arm  and  133  patients  were  in  the  trastuzumab  +  chemotherapy  arm.  The  p-
value for the hazard ratio crossed the prespecified early-reporting boundary of 0.001 (nominal 0.0005 
one-sided)  for DFS. As a result, the DMCs of both cooperative groups  independently recommended 
closing the studies to accrual and offering trastuzumab to eligible patients in the chemotherapy alone 
arms. The following table gives a summary of results.

Interim  analysis  of  combined  data  showed  significantly  decreased  hazard  ratio  in  favour  of  the 
trastuzumab group. There is an increase in disease free survival in the trastuzumab group. At 3 years 
this translates to an absolute benefit with respect to disease free survival rate of 11.8% (95% CI:8.7%, 
15.0%), at 4 years of 18.2% (95% CI: 14.4%, 22.1%). Subgroup analysis is shown in the table.

Discussion on Clinical Efficacy 
The MAH has provided the results from one pivotal study (HERA) and two supportive studies (B13 
and  N9831)  for  the  evaluation  of  safety  and  efficacy  of  trastuzumab  for  the  adjuvant  treatment  of 
HER2-positive, early breast cancer. The conduct of these studies is acceptable and no deviations from 
GCP are apparent.  
In  these  trials  the  effect  of  chemotherapy  followed  by  a  one  year  treatment  with  trastuzumab  on 
disease recurrence and overall survival was examined. While HERA allowed a spectrum of currently 
used  adjuvant  chemotherapy  protocols,  B31  and  N9831  had  a  defined  chemotherapy  protocol 
consisting  of  cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin  and  paclitaxel.  However,  most  patients  in  the  HERA 
trial had received anthracyclines which is in line with current recommendations. 
For the HERA trial the MAH has chosen a new posology, the loading dose has been increased from 4 
mg/kg  to  8  mg/kg  and  the  maintenance  dose  from  2  mg/kg  to  4  mg/kg,  schedule  has  been  changed 
from once weekly to once every three weeks. Both supportive studies have been performed using the 
approved posology. Efficacy data comparing both posologies directly are not available but the effect 
size in pivotal study and supportive studies is comparable. 
Primary  objective  in  the  HERA  trial  and  in  the  joint  analysis  of  the  supportive  studies  was 
demonstration of efficacy  as  determined by  disease-free survival.  Primary endpoint was  met in both 
analyses and a significantly reduced hazard ratio in favour of trastuzumab treatment was demonstrated 
(log-rank  p<0.0001).  The  hazard  ratio  of  disease  free  survival  in  the  HERA  study  was  0.54  (95% 
confidence  interval  0.44-0.67).  The  2-year  disease-free  survival  rate  was  78.2%  in  the  observation 
group  and  85.8%  in  the  trastuzumab  group.  The  hazard  ratio  of  disease  free  survival  in  the  joint 
analysis of B-31 and N9831 study was 0.48 (95% confidence interval 0.39-0.59). The 3-year disease-
free survival rate was 75.4% (95% CI: 72.4%, 78.3%) in the observation group and 87.2% (95% CI: 
85.0%, 89.4%) in the trastuzumab group. 
There was no statistically significant effect on overall survival in the HERA trial yet, while the joint 
analysis of B-31 and N9831 showed a significantly reduced hazard ratio of 0.67 (95% CI 0.48-0.92) in 
favour of the trastuzumab treatment arm. Overall survival is significantly increased in the trastuzumab 
group  although  absolute  benefit  (difference  in  4  year  overall  survival  rate  4.8%,  95%  CI  1.4-8.2)  is 
considerably lower than for disease free survival. 
Efficacy  was  demonstrated  in  all  clinically  relevant  subgroups,  there  was  no  indication  that  certain 
subgroups do not have a benefit from treatment. External validity for efficacy is considered to be high, 
however, as discussed in the safety assessment in detail there is concern that inclusion and exclusion 
criteria  define  a  population  with  a  considerably  lower  cardiac  risk  compared  to  patients  that  will  be 
treated outside of strictly controlled trials. 
Current  data  allow evaluating efficacy of  one-year  treatment only; data from  the  two year treatment 
arm have not been submitted. 
20 
 
In  conclusion  trastuzumab  is  effective  in  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  HER2-positive  breast  cancer  if 
given after adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy if appropriate. Efficacy has not 
been demonstrated in node-negative disease with a tumour-size of less than or equal to 1 cm, which is 
generally regarded as a low risk group for recurrence and thus was not included in the trial. 
Clinical safety 
Analyses  presented  in  this  report  focus  on  the  comparison  of  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  1  year 
trastuzumab  arm  versus  observation  only  arm  based  on  a  protocol-specified  interim  analysis  of  the 
data  performed  after  half  of  the  required  (951)  events  of  disease  free  survival  were  recorded  on  the 
database (clinical cut-off March 29th 2005). 
Secondary objectives of the trial with regard to the safety were  
- To evaluate the safety and tolerability of trastuzumab. 
- To compare the incidence of cardiac dysfunction. 
Patients  entering  the  HERA  trial  were  required  to  have  an  LVEF  of  ≥  55%  at  baseline.  Cardiac 
monitoring  was  performed  at  weeks  13  and  25  and  every  3  months  thereafter  and  comprised  ECG, 
echocardiogram or MUGA scan, clinical signs and symptoms of cardiac failure and completion of a 
cardiac questionnaire by the investigator. Trastuzumab treatment was discontinued in any patient who 
developed  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of  congestive  heart  failure.  In  addition,  an  algorithm  was 
provided  for  the  discontinuation  of  trastuzumab  in  individual  patients  based  on  interval  LVEF 
assessments, as described earlier (Figure 2). 
Primary and secondary cardiac endpoints were defined and used in three pre-defined interim analyses 
of  cardiac  safety,  after  300,  600  and  900  patients  had  completed  6  months  from  randomization.  A 
significant  LVEF  drop  was  defined  as  an  absolute  decrease  of  at  least  10  points  below  the  baseline 
measurement and to below 50%. 
Primary Cardiac Endpoint 
The occurrence in any patient at any time after randomization, but prior to the start of any new therapy 
for recurrent disease of any of the following: 
− 
− 
Symptomatic congestive heart failure of NYHA class III or IV (confirmed by a cardiologist) 
and a drop in LVEF of at least 10 EF points from baseline and to below 50%. 
Cardiac death defined as either: 
– 
– 
Definite  cardiac  death:  due  to  CHF,  myocardial  infarction  or  documented  primary 
arrhythmia 
Probable  cardiac  death:  sudden  unexpected  death  within  24  hrs  of  a  definite  or 
probable cardiac event (syncope, cardiac arrest, chest pain, infarction, arrhythmia etc.) 
without documented aetiology. 
All primary cardiac endpoints, as defined above, were to be reported as serious adverse events (SAEs) 
irrespective of treatment allocation. 
Secondary Cardiac Endpoint 
A secondary cardiac endpoint could occur any time after randomization, but prior to the start of any 
new therapy for recurrent disease, and was defined as: 
− 
A significant asymptomatic (NYHA class I) or mildly symptomatic (NYHA class II) drop in 
LVEF identified by MUGA scan or echocardiogram, unless the following  LVEF assessment 
indicated  a  return  to  levels  which  did  not  meet  the  definition  of  a  significant  LVEF  drop. 
NYHA  class  II  CHF  had  to  be  confirmed  by  a  cardiologist.  A  repeat  assessment  had  to  be 
performed  approximately  3  weeks  after  the  first  documented  LVEF  drop.  If  such  a  repeat 
assessment  or  confirmation  of  NYHA  class  II  CHF  by  a  cardiologist  was  not  available,  the 
Cardiac  Advisory  Board  (CAB)  was  to  review  the  case  to  determine  acceptability  as  a 
secondary cardiac endpoint. A significant LVEF drop was defined as an absolute decrease of 
at least 10 EF points below baseline and to below 50%. 
21 
 
Events  such  as acute  coronary syndrome,  acute  myocardial  infarction  or severe rhythm disturbances 
requiring treatment were not considered as primary or secondary cardiac endpoints unless fatal. These 
events were, however, reported as AEs or SAEs, as applicable. 
The analyses were performed by an independent statistician and presented to the IDMC, who would 
have recommended stopping or  modifying the trial if an absolute difference of more than  4% in the 
incidence  of  primary  cardiac  endpoints  was  observed  between  the  trastuzumab  and  observation 
groups.  The  IDMC  recommended  that  the  study  continued  as  planned  after  each  interim  analysis, 
implying that the difference remained below 4%. 
Patient exposure 
Overview of the 4 large studies of trastuzumab in early breast cancer: 
Table 16: 
Adverse events 
A total of 46% (792/1708) of patients in the observation arm and 70% (1179/1678) of patients in the 
trastuzumab  arm  experienced  at  least  one  adverse  event  during  the  study.  A  higher  percentage  of 
patients  in  the  trastuzumab  treatment  arm  (8.6%;  145/1678)  compared  with  the  observation  arm 
(4.6%;  79/1708)  experienced  at  least  one  grade  III  adverse  event.  The  most  frequent  of  these  were 
hypertension, hot flush, vomiting, headache, diarrhoea and congestive cardiac failure. Ten observation 
arm  patients  and  13 trastuzumab arm  patients experienced  a Grade IV adverse event. Two  grade IV 
adverse  events  (cardiac  failure,  congestive  cardiac  failure)  were  considered  related  to  trastuzumab 
treatment. In both cases, treatment with trastuzumab was discontinued and the events resolved without 
sequelae. 
Arthralgia,  headache,  hot  flush,  nasopharyngitis  and  fatigue  were  each  reported  by  >  10%  of  all 
patients. Not unexpectedly, adverse events occurring with a higher frequency in the trastuzumab arm 
than the observation arm included headache, nasopharyngitis, fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea, pyrexia and 
chills, all of which are commonly associated with trastuzumab infusions.  
The vast majority of adverse events were classified as NCI-CTC grade 1 or 2 (2130/2251 events in the 
observation arm and 5046/5248 events in the trastuzumab arm). A total of 102 grade 3 adverse events 
22 
 
 
 
 
were reported by 79 patients (4.6%) in the observation arm, compared with 183 grade 3 adverse events 
in  145  patients  (8.6%)  recorded  during  treatment  with  trastuzumab.  Higher  frequencies  of  grade  3 
infections  (including  influenza  and  acute  bronchitis),  general  disorders  and  administration  site 
conditions  (most  commonly  fatigue  and  chills)  and  gastrointestinal  disorders  (mainly  diarrhoea  and 
vomiting) were reported by patients in the trastuzumab group than in the observation arm. 
Grade 4 (life-threatening) adverse events were reported by 10 patients (12 events) in the observation 
arm  and  13  patients  (14  events)  in  the  trastuzumab  arm,  with  no  event  occurring  in  more  than  one 
patient within each group.  
During the study, 10 observation arm patients and 13 trastuzumab arm patients reported at least one 
adverse event that was considered life-threatening (grade IV) in intensity. No single grade IV adverse 
event occurred in more than one patient in each treatment arm. The 12 grade IV events reported in 10 
patients  from  the  observation  arm  were  pain,  paresis,  hypotension,  pulmonary  embolism,  cardiac 
failure,  breast  cancer,  uterine  cancer,  breast  cancer  in  situ,  cervix  carcinoma,  pancreatic  carcinoma, 
papillary thyroid carcinoma and leukopenia. The 14 grade IV events reported in 13 patients from the 
trastuzumab arm were central line infection, appendicitis, catheter related complication, sudden death, 
cerebrovascular  accident,  cerebral  ischemia,  lymphoedema,  deep  vein  thrombosis,  pulmonary 
hypertension,  depression,  congestive  cardiac  failure,  cardiac  failure,  breast  cancer  and  malignant 
melanoma.  Two  grade  IV  adverse  events  were  considered  related  to  trastuzumab  treatment:  Patient 
31412/5416,  a  53-year-old  patient  reported  grade  IV  cardiac  failure  on  day  85  of  trastuzumab 
treatment which was reported as a serious adverse event. The cardiac failure was assessed as related to 
trastuzumab treatment. Patient 31289/1650, a 40-year-old patient reported grade IV congestive cardiac 
failure  on day 155 of trastuzumab treatment. The event was reported  as a serious adverse event  and 
assessed  as  related  to  trastuzumab  treatment.  In  both  cases,  treatment  with  trastuzumab  was 
discontinued and the events resolved without sequelae. 
A total of 1276 adverse events reported by 600 patients in the trastuzumab arm were considered to be 
related to treatment. The most common treatment-related adverse events included known trastuzumab 
infusion  reactions,  such  as  chills,  pyrexia  and  nausea,  and  known  cardiac-related  events, 
predominantly decreased ejection fraction and cardiac failure.  
Cardiac Safety 
Primary cardiac endpoints (symptomatic CHF of NYHA class III or IV and a drop in LVEF to below 
50% and at least 10 points below baseline, or cardiac death) were recorded by 1 patient (0.1%) in the 
observation arm (cardiac failure leading to death) and 10 patients (0.6%) in the trastuzumab arm (CHF 
of  NYHA  class  III  [8  patients]  or  class  IV  [2  patients],  no  deaths).  Secondary  cardiac  endpoints 
(asymptomatic-NYHA I or mildly symptomatic-NYHA II and decreases in LVEF of at least 10% of 
baseline  value  and  below  50%)  were  recorded  by  9  patients  (0.5%)  in  the  observation  arm  and  51 
patients (3.0%) in the trastuzumab arm.  
Summary of cardiac endpoints in the HERA study: 
23 
 
Table 17: 
Of  the  10  trastuzumab  patients  with  a  primary  cardiac  endpoint,  8  were  asymptomatic  at  the  last 
scheduled  assessment  on  the  database  (as  per  15th  December  2005).  Six  of  the  ten  patients  had  a 
recovery of the LVEF to at least 55% at a median of 121 days (36-409 days) from the initial LVEF 
drop. Nine of the 10 trastuzumab patients received treatment for congestive heart failure. 
Of the 51 trastuzumab patients with a secondary cardiac endpoint, 45 (88%) were asymptomatic at the 
last scheduled assessment on the database (as per 15th December 2005). Thirty-five of the 51 patients 
(69%) had a recovery of the LVEF to at least 55% at a median  of 189 days (13-831 days) from the 
initial  LVEF  drop.  Twelve  of  the  51  trastuzumab  patients  (24%)  have  been  reported  as  having 
received treatment for congestive heart failure. 
All observation patients were asymptomatic at the last scheduled assessment on the database (as per 
15th December 2005). Six of the 9 observation patients exhibited a recovery of the LVEF to at least 
55%  at a  median  of  204  days (139-274  days) from the initial LVEF drop.  One  of the 9  observation 
patients have been reported as having received treatment for congestive heart failure. 
As  expected,  patients  treated  with  trastuzumab  had  a  higher  incidence  of  asymptomatic  cardiac 
dysfunction, defined as at least one drop in LVEF of ≥ 10 EF points from baseline and to < 50% (7.4% 
of  patients  in  the  1  year  trastuzumab  arm  compared  with  2.3%  of  patients  in  the  observation  arm). 
Approximately  50%  of  trastuzumab  patients  who  had  an  initial  significant  LVEF  drop  were  later 
confirmed by a subsequent assessment to have a primary or secondary cardiac endpoint. The clinical 
significance of single, unconfirmed LVEF drops is unclear. 
The majority of patients in the study (94% in each treatment arm) had received a previous treatment 
regimen  containing  anthracyclines.  All  11  patients  experiencing  a  primary  cardiac  endpoint  had 
received  previous  anthracycline  therapy  and  all  but  2  of  the  60  patients  experiencing  a  secondary 
cardiac  endpoint  (both  of  whom  were  receiving  trastuzumab)  had  received  previous  anthracycline 
therapy. 
The Applicant stated that the results regarding cardiac event compare favourably with rates of cardiac 
events from a pooled analysis of studies in patients with MBC, in which 2.7% of patients treated with 
trastuzumab experienced serious cardiac events and 10.2% of trastuzumab patients experienced a 
decrease in LVEF of ≥ 10% to below 50% . 
In the majority of cases, LVEF values stabilized or returned towards baseline following cessation of 
trastuzumab treatment. 
It is well known from the MBC setting that the risk of cardiotoxicity is higher in patients who receive 
anthracycline chemotherapy. In the HERA trial, 94% of all patients had previously been treated with 
24 
 
 
chemotherapy  regimens  which  included  epirubicine  or  doxorubicine.  Each  of  the  10  trastuzumab 
patients experiencing primary cardiac endpoints (severe CHF, NYHA class III or IV), and all but two 
of  the  patients  who  recorded  secondary  cardiac  endpoints  (NYHA  class  I  or  II)  had  received 
anthracycline treatment before entering the study.  
Slightly  higher  rates  of  cardiac  disorders  and  LVEF  drops  were  seen  in  the  other  large  EBC  trials. 
Assessment  of  cardiac  dysfunction  in  trial  B-31  showed  that  the  cumulative  incidence  of  cardiac 
events (CHF of NYHA class III or IV, or cardiac death) was 4.1% (31/850) for patients treated with 
trastuzumab  compared  with  0.8%  (5/814)  for  patients  in  the  control  group.  14%  of  patients 
discontinued  Trastuzumab  therapy  as  a  result  of  asymptomatic  decreases  in  LVEF  and  4% 
discontinued  because  of  symptomatic  cardiotoxicity.  As  seen  in  MBC  patients,  the  trastuzumab-
related cardiac dysfunction in this trial was generally reversible on cessation of treatment. The higher 
incidence  in  this  study  may  be  related  to  the  concomitant  treatment  of  trastuzumab  with  paclitaxel. 
Recent data from  the N9831 trial suggests that lower rates of severe cardiac  disorder are seen when 
trastuzumab  treatment  is  administered  after  completion  of  taxane  therapy.  The  Applicant  stated  that 
the temporal proximity of trastuzumab treatment to AC chemotherapy may play a bigger role, based 
on  results  from  the  BCIRG-006  trial  where  symptomatic  cardiac  events  were  recorded  by  2.3%  of 
patients receiving trastuzumab concomitantly with docetaxel following AC therapy compared to 1.2% 
of patients in both the control group (AC→T) and the group of patients who received Trastuzumab in 
combination  with  docetaxel  and  carboplatin.  LVEF  decreases  (>  15%  and  below  lower  limit  of 
normal) occurred in 2.4%, 0.6% and 0.4% of patients, respectively, in the AC→TH, AC→T and TCH 
groups. 
The  Applicant  stated  that  the  rates  of  severe  CHF  seen  in  early  breast  cancer  are  lower  than  those 
observed in the metastatic setting. At the point of data cut-off in the HERA trial, rates of CHF, LVEF 
decreases  and  other  cardiac  disorders  were  lower  than  predicted  from  historical  data,  however,  the 
duration of follow-up is short (median 12 months) and the possibility that the rates may rise over time 
cannot be excluded. The current SmPC provides clear information on the risks of cardiac dysfunction 
associated  with  trastuzumab  therapy,  particularly  following  anthracycline-containing  chemotherapy. 
The  SmPC  also  outlines  recommended  cardiac  assessments  prior  to  prescribing  trastuzumab,  and 
provides  discontinuation  criteria.  The  same  precautions  should  be  followed  when  considering 
treatment in patients with early breast cancer.  
LVEF changes from baseline 
At baseline, the median LVEF value was 64% in both treatment arms. The percentage of patients with 
significant  LVEF  drops  at  each  time  point  was  greater  in  the  1  year  trastuzumab  arm  than  in  the 
observation arm. Decreases in LVEF of ≥ 10% were recorded at some point during the study by 25% 
(394/1600)  of  patients  in  the  trastuzumab  arm  compared  with  14%  (213/1545)  of  patients  in  the 
observation  arm.  Significant  LVEF  drops  (i.e.  LVEF  value  <  50%  and  a  decrease  of  > 10%)  were 
recorded  on  at  least  one  occasion  during  the  study  by  7.4%  (118/1600)  of  patients  treated  with 
trastuzumab compared with 2.3% (35/1545) of patients in the observation arm. Sixty-one of the 118 
trastuzumab patients who had an initial significant LVEF drop were later confirmed by a subsequent 
assessment to have either a primary (10 patients) or secondary (51 patients) cardiac endpoint.

Infusion Reactions 
Common  adverse  events  in  patients  treated  with  trastuzumab  included  those  usually  associated  with 
infusions, namely pyrexia, chills, headache and nausea. The majority of these events were of mild or 
moderate intensity (NCI-CTC grade 1 or 2), short-lasting (app.  2 days) and resolved without sequelae. 
There  was  no  evidence  of  an  increase  in  the  incidence  or  severity  of  infusion-associated  adverse 
events associated with the higher doses (6 mg/kg) used in the three-weekly regimen compared with the 
approved weekly dose of 2 mg/kg. Serious infusion-associated adverse events were reported by only 
eight patients in the study and resulted in the discontinuation of trastuzumab treatment in three of these 
patients. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
At the time of data cut-off, serious adverse events had been reported for 5% (92/1708) of patients in 
the observation arm compared with 8% (134/1678) of patients in the 1 year trastuzumab arm. Serious 
infections and infestations were reported by 36 (2%) patients in the trastuzumab arm compared with 
16 (< 1%) control patients, cardiac disorders were reported by 22 trastuzumab patients (1%) and 4 (< 
1%) observation arm patients and general disorders and administration  site conditions were reported 
by 13 (< 1%) trastuzumab arm patients compared with 2 (< 1%) observation arm patients. 
The  most  common,  treatment-related  serious  adverse  event  was  cardiac  failure,  reported  by  11 
trastuzumab  patients (preferred  terms ‘congestive  cardiac failure’ [7  patients]  and  ‘cardiac  failure’[4 
patients])  vs.  no  observation  patients.  In  total,  30  patients  in  the  Trastuzumab  group  recorded  38 
serious  adverse  events  that  were  considered  to  be  related  to  treatment,  most  commonly  congestive 
cardiac failure/cardiac failure (11 patients), chills (4 patients), pyrexia (3 patients) and hypotension (2 
patients). 
After  congestive  cardiac  failure,  the  next  most  frequently  reported  serious  adverse  events  were 
erysipelas  (reported  by  7  trastuzumab  patients  and  1  observation  patient),  central  line  infection  (6 
trastuzumab  patients  and  1  observation  patient),  breast  fibrosis  (5  trastuzumab  patients  and  1 
observation patient), cellulitis and deep vein thrombosis (each reported by 4 trastuzumab patients). 
Ninety-seven patients were withdrawn from the study as a result of an adverse event. In 88 of these 
patients,  the  adverse  event  which  led  to  withdrawal  was  considered  to  be  related  to  trastuzumab 
treatment. “Cardiac disorders” (SOC) accounted for discontinuation in 44 patients (3%), of whom 30 
experienced  congestive  cardiac  failure/cardiac  failure.  A  further  23  patients  had  trastuzumab 
discontinued  due  to  ejection  fraction  decrease  (recorded  within  the  SOC  “Investigations”).  Cardiac 
disorder and chills were each recorded as the reason for discontinuation by three patients.

At the time of the interim efficacy analysis, two patients in the observation arm and 4 patients in the 
trastuzumab arm had died as a result of an adverse event. In the observation arm, patient 31307/6503 
committed  suicide  on  study  day  146  and  patient  31508/2771  died  on  day  205  due  to  cardiac  failure 
which  the  investigator  considered  to  be  probably  a  result  of  pulmonary  embolism.  Deaths  in  the 
trastuzumab  arm  resulted  from  cerebral  haemorrhage  (study  day  115,  patient  31216/7913), 
cerebrovascular  accident  (study  day  289,  patient  31218/3621),  sudden  death  (study  day  290,  patient 
31351/7392)  and  appendicitis  (study  day  366,  patient  31562/4095).  A  further  patient  in  the 
trastuzumab arm died as a result of a road accident, which was not reported as an AE. 
In  addition,  disease  progression  of  the  underlying  breast  cancer  accounted  for  38  deaths  in  the 
observation arm and 26 deaths in the Trastuzumab arm. 
In the B-31 and N9831 trials, some rare cases of interstitial pneumonitis were reported that appeared 
to  be  related  to  trastuzumab  therapy.  Four  patients  treated  with  trastuzumab  in  trial  B-31  had 
interstitial pneumonitis, one of whom died. In N9831, five patients in the trastuzumab arm had grade 
3+ pneumonitis or pulmonary infiltrates, one of whom died. These occurred during or shortly after the 
paclitaxel  phase  of  treatment,  however,  the  relationship  to  paclitaxel  treatment  is  unclear.  In  the 
HERA trial, one patient in the trastuzumab group recorded pneumonitis during the study. The event 
was  considered  unrelated  to  treatment  by  the  investigator,  was  of  NCI-CTC  grade  2  and  resolved 
without sequelae following appropriate treatment. 
Laboratory findings 
During the study the majority of patients in either study arm did not exhibit a shift from their baseline 
laboratory  test  parameter  values  or  exhibited  a  shift  of  2  grades  or  less  between  baseline  and  their 
worst  test  value.  Fewer  patients  in  the  trastuzumab  1  year  arm  experienced  a  shift  of  3  or  4  grades 
from baseline than in the observation arm. 
A total of 31 observation arm patients and 21 patients in the 1 year trastuzumab arm experienced a 3-
grade  worsening)  from  baseline  in  one  or  more  laboratory  test  parameter  values  (40  events  and  24 
events,  respectively).  Twenty-four  observation  arm  patients  and  16  trastuzumab  arm  patients 
experienced a 4-grade worsening in one or more laboratory test parameters (30 events and 17 events, 
respectively). There was no difference between the treatment arms with respect to the type of 3grade 
or 4-grade shifts from baseline. 
Risk Management Plan 
The applicant has submitted a risk management plan in accordance with the EC directive EC/27/2004. 
The plan details the steps to be taken post marketing authorisation in order to minimise the risks 
associated with the use of this agent.  
The  submitted EU-RMP will be revised in accordance with CHMP comments and will be resubmitted 
by June 2006.  
In view of the likelihood that cardiac failure will occur at higher rates in ordinary practice than in the 
HERA study, proposals for an observational study should be included. The RMP should incorporate a 
set of guidelines to “ initiate and monitor cardiac function/dysfunction associated with Herceptin use” 
in early breast cancer. 
Risk Minimisation  
On  the  basis  of  the  safety  profile  detailed  above,  it  is  considered  that  the  major  identified  risk  for 
trastuzumab  is  of  cardiotoxicity.  In  keeping  with  current  regulatory  guidelines,  and  in  order  to 
maximise the benefit/ risk ratio in the adjuvant setting this section, Roche proposes a risk minimisation 
plan. 
The MAH amended the trastuzumab label, as per the HERA data, to emphasise the current warning 
regarding cardio toxicity. In addition to good pharmacovigilance practice, the following measures will 
be implemented

• 
• 
• 
• 
A  guided  questionnaire  will  be  sent  as  part  of  good  follow-up  practice  for  all  serious  adverse 
events of cardiotoxicity received by the MAH. 
A workshop is organised to design guidance for physicians. 
A manuscript of the workshop proceedings will be published and distributed via the sales force. 
In  addition,  the  MAH  is  sponsoring  a  scientific  project  and  clinical  trials  investigating 
mechanism  of  cardiac  toxicity  in  relation  to  trastuzumab  as  well  as  further  clinical  trials  in 
which cardiotoxicity is actively addressed.  
Discussion on clinical safety 
Cardiotoxicity  is  a  known  risk  of  treatment  with  trastuzumab  and  described  in  the  SmPC  in  the 
metastatic  setting.  The  current  SPC  states  that  all  MBC  candidates  for  treatment  should  undergo 
baseline cardiac assessment including history and physical examination, ECG, echocardiogram and/or 
MUGA  scan,  and  a  careful  risk-benefit  assessment  conducted  prior  to  starting  treatment  with 
trastuzumab.  It  is  also  recommended  that  cardiac  function  be  monitored  regularly  (e.g.  every  three 
months)  during  treatment,  and  patients  who  develop  asymptomatic  cardiac  dysfunction  may  benefit 
from  more  frequent  monitoring  (e.g.  every  6-8  weeks).  Discontinuation  of  treatment  should  be 
considered in patients who develop cardiac failure or who have a continued decrease in LVEF. 
The major adverse event that could be a limiting factor for the use of Herceptin in breast cancer is the 
cardiac safety. Herceptin use in the metastatic breast cancer setting is associated with heart failure that 
varied in incidence depending up on the concomitant chemotherapy used. In the metastatic setting the 
incidence  of  cardiac  dysfunction  was  ~7%  when  used  as  monotherapy,  28%  combined  with 
anthracyclines,  and  11%  when  combined  with  paclitaxel.  Use  of  broader  criteria  has  led  to  newer 
events and redefinition of percentages.    
In the “early breast cancer” setting, the HERA trial provides the first clues towards the incidence of 
cardiac  dysfunction.  The  findings  of  other  studies  (B-31,  N9831  and  BCIRG-006),  support  the 
findings  but  in  a  slightly  different  context.  In  the  B-31  and  N9831  studies,  Herceptin  was  used  in 
conjuction  with  a  taxane  and  are  therefore  not  identical  to  the  HERA  trial.  However,  overall,  the 
incidence of heart failure or cardiac dysfunction is lower in this setting than that seen earlier with the 
metastatic setting.  
The incidence  of cardiac  dysfunction in the HERA  trial should taken as a  composite  of the  primary 
and secondary end points. The long-term effects of drop in LV ejection fraction in this subset of other 
wise  healthy  patients  will  need  to  be  addressed  carefully.  The  ‘investigators’  cardiac  questionnaire’ 
showed a higher incidence of cardiac symptoms and clinical findings, suggesting that the 0.6% heart 
failure  incidence  projected  by  the  applicant  is  an  underestimate.  In  this  context,  it  is  considered 
appropriate to raise questions to the applicant. 
Safety  data  have  been  reported  from  patients  who  have  been  treated  with  trastuzumab  in  the  three 
other  large  studies  of  trastuzumab  in  early  breast  cancer  (B-31,  N9831  and  BCRIG-006).  The  joint 
efficacy  analysis  of  trials  B-31  and  N9831  included  1672  women  in  the  trastuzumab  arm  (weekly 
Trastuzumab  treatment  given  concurrently  with  paclitaxel  following  4  cycles  of  doxorubicin  and 
cyclophosphamide).  In  study  BCIRG  006,  a  total  of  2147  patients  were  randomized  to  receive 
trastuzumab,  either  in  combination  with  docetaxel  following  4  cycles  of  doxorubicin  and 
cyclophosphamide (N=1074), or with docetaxel and carboplatin (N=1075). In these trials trastuzumab 
had  been  administered  in  combination  with  taxane  in  the  adjuvant  setting  after  administration  of  an 
anthracycline containing chemotherapy regimen. The definition of cardiac events for confirmation by 
a committee for evaluation of cardiac events were very strict, so that only 16 of 40 adverse events in 
the chemotherapy alone  arm had been confirmed and only 43 of 133 events in the trastuzumab plus 
chemotherapy arm. The joint analyses demonstrated 2.0% of confirmed symptomatic cardiac events in 
the  trastuzumab  plus  chemotherapy  arm  and  0.5%  in  the  chemotherapy  alone  group.  The  rate  of 
cardiac events determined by the cardiac review committee pooling the data of both studies was lower 
than  that  determined  by  the  individual  study  committees  of  both  studies.  The  worst  case  rate  of 
symptomatic  cardiac events was 0.7% in  the  chemotherapy alone  arm and 3.2%  in  the  Trastuzumab 
plus chemotherapy arm and this rate was nearly similar in the study where trastuzumab had been co-
administered  with  taxanes  of  0.7%  in  the  arm  without  trastuzumab  and  3.5%  for  the  trastuzumab 
28 
 
 
 
containing  regimen.  In  the  trastuzumab  plus  chemotherapy  arm,  3  patients  died  because  of  cardiac 
events and in the chemotherapy alone arm 2 patients died because of cardiac event 
The primary and secondary cardiac endpoint defined by the MAH are very selected which may lead to 
an  underestimation  of  cardiac  toxicity  of  trastuzumab  in  EBC.  In  the  US  studies  the  definition  of 
cardiac dysfunction differed from those in the HERA study (less exclusive). The cardiac dysfunction 
was described in two ways:; cardiac events and asymptomatic LVEF events. 
It is stated that the majority of primary and secondary cardiac endpoints were recorded during the first 
6  months  post-randomization,  which  may  suggest  there  is  no  increase  in  the  risk  of  cardiac 
dysfunction with long term (1 year) treatment with trastuzumab. It remains to be seen whether a higher 
incidence  of  CHF  will  be  observed  with  longer  follow-up  and  following  2  years  treatment  with 
trastuzumab.  
In  the  EBC  setting  all  patients  with  risk  factors  for  cardiotoxicity  were  excluded  from  study 
participation.  In  addition,  the  cumulative  dose  of  AC  was  limited  to  certain  thresholds.  This 
precautionary measure might explain the difference between the results of cardiac toxicity in the MBC 
and EBC setting. The different definitions of cardiac toxicity should also be taken into account. 
Infusion reactions associated with trastuzumab treatment are well characterized, generally mild in 
intensity and are manageable by interruption of the dose and/or appropriate medical care. As 
demonstrated in the HERA trial, patients who experience mild infusion reactions in the early treatment 
cycles usually go on to receive subsequent infusions without problem. There are no additional 
concerns relating to infusion-associated adverse events in early breast cancer patients. 
Overall Conclusion and Benefit-risk assessment 
The HERA trial has demonstrated an impressive level of efficacy for both primary and secondary end 
points  that  include  disease  free  survival,  recurrence  free  survival,  and  distant  disease  free  survival 
within  the  limited  median follow  up  of 1 year. The reduction in  relative  risk  is  of the order of ~45-
50%, while the absolute risk reduction is ~5.4% for the primary end point. The hazard ratio of disease 
free survival in the HERA study was 0.54 (95% confidence interval 0.44-0.67, log-rank p<0.0001). No 
benefit in overall survival was seen yet but this may require further follow up as the number of events 
were  few  and  the  overall  survival  in  early  breast  cancer  with  the  current  modalities  of  treatment 
exceeds  85%.  The  results  are  based  on  interim  analysis  only  and  the  2  year  arm  results  are  still 
awaited. The 2-year disease-free survival rate was 78.2% in the observation group and 85.8% in the 
trastuzumab group. The hazard ratio of disease free survival in the joint analysis of B-31 and N9831 
study  was  0.48  (95%  confidence  interval  0.39-0.59,  log-rank  p<0.0001).  The  3-year  disease-free 
survival rate was 75.4% in the observation group and 87.2% in the trastuzumab group. Efficacy results 
were consistent in clinically relevant subgroups. 
There  was  no  statistically  significant  effect  on  overall  survival  in  the  HERA  trial,  while  the  joint 
analysis of B-31 and N9831 showed a significantly reduced hazard ratio of 0.67 (95% CI 0.48-0.92) in 
favour of the trastuzumab treatment arm. Since all patients in the observation arms were offered active 
treatment evaluation of overall treatment benefit in terms of overall survival may become difficult. 
Herceptin is a rather well-known medicinal product, currently licensed in the metastatic disease. The 
safety profile is characterised in this setting, and a major known safety issue is cardiotoxicity. 
Therefore, already at this stage the consequences as regards risk management and other measures are 
clear-cut and can be defined at this stage. 
Herceptin infusion was associated with a number of adverse events greater than the observation arm, 
especially cardiac dysfunction. The combined incidence of primary and secondary end points should 
be taken as the level of cardiac dysfunction induced by herceptin and at 3.6% this is considerable in 
this relatively healthy female population. The added degree of asymptomatic LV dysfunction that may 
or may not be truly reversible should be considered together with the cardiac safety end points. Only 
further  follow  up  will  address  this.  Other  adverse  events  with  Herceptin  are  well  known  and 
manageable.  
29 
 
 
 
 
 
As the used inclusion/exclusion criteria and the strict case definition of cardiac toxicity might lead to 
an underestimation of cardiac risk of the target population, the SPC wording reflects the real risk of 
cardiac toxicity in EBC. 
Finally, there is no information available on the long-term effects of treatment with trastuzumab. The 
patients treated in an adjuvant setting have a considerably longer live expectancy than patients treated 
in  the  metastatic  setting.  In  the  case  of  recurrence  they  will  be  faced  with  the  additional,  possibly 
cardiotoxic  treatment.  In  addition  other  factors,  e.g.  relating  to  age  and  life-style  may  increase  the 
cardiac risk unproportionally. Further, patients might in case of a recurrence again be candidates for 
Herceptin  treatment (which would resemble the setting  of  the  currently licensed indication). The re-
exposure of Herceptin both as regards safety and efficacy is unknown, but could bear potential risks 
(immunogenicity, infusion reactions, reduced efficacy etc.). The long-term outcome of patients treated 
with trastuzumab should therefore examined in a postmarketing study. 
The long-term impact of the new adjuvant treatment with Herceptin should be systematically studied. 
While  there  might  be  immediate  benefit  in  terms  of  PFS,  the  long-term  impact  of  treatment  both  in 
terms  of safety  and efficacy  should be understood.  While only hypothetically at the current stage  of 
knowledge, it could turn out that patients relapsing following adjuvant treatment with Herceptin might 
not anymore  be  candidates for  re-treatment  with Herceptin (e.g.  due to immunogenicity), negatively 
influencing  prognosis.  Further,  cardiotoxicity  could  negatively  impact  on  prognosis  and  long-term 
outcome. This needs to be studied adequately to better define the value of (neo-) adjuvant treatment 
with Herceptin. 
In  view  of  the  outstanding  efficacy  seen  in  the  interim  analysis  of  the  1-year  Herceptin  arm  of  the 
HERA  trial  and  the  supportive  studies  and  with  cardiac  safety  considerations  in  mind  the  overall 
benefit-risk of Herceptin in the adjurant treatment of Breast Cancer patients overexpressing HER-2 is 
considered positive. Data from the interim analysis of the 2-year trastuzumab arm will be submitted 
when available.

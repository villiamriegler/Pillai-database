2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each tablet contains 0.5 mg of repaglinide. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Tablet 
Repaglinide tablets are white, round and convex and engraved with Novo Nordisk logo (Apis bull). 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Repaglinide is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose hyperglycaemia can no longer 
be controlled satisfactorily by diet, weight reduction and exercise. Repaglinide is also indicated in 
combination with metformin in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not satisfactorily 
controlled on metformin alone. 
Treatment should be initiated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to lower the blood glucose in relation 
to meals. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Repaglinide is given preprandially and is titrated individually to optimise glycaemic control. In 
addition to the usual self-monitoring by the patient of blood and/or urinary glucose, the patient’s 
blood glucose must be monitored periodically by the physician to determine the minimum effective 
dose for the patient. Glycosylated haemoglobin levels are also of value in monitoring the patient’s 
response to therapy. Periodic monitoring is necessary to detect inadequate lowering of blood glucose 
at the recommended maximum dose level (i.e. primary failure) and to detect loss of adequate blood 
glucose-lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness (i.e. secondary failure). 
Short-term administration of repaglinide may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control 
in type 2 diabetic patients usually controlled well on diet. 
Initial dose 
The dosage should be determined by the physician, according to the patient’s requirements. 
The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg. One to two weeks should elapse between titration steps (as 
determined by blood glucose response). 
If patients are transferred from another oral hypoglycaemic medicinal product, the recommended 
starting dose is 1 mg. 
Maintenance 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The recommended maximum single dose is 4 mg taken with main meals. 
The total maximum daily dose should not exceed 16 mg. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No clinical studies have been conducted in patients >75 years of age. 
Renal impairment 
Repaglinide is not affected by renal disorders (see section 5.2). 
Eight percent of one dose of repaglinide is excreted through the kidneys and total plasma clearance of 
the product is decreased in patients with renal impairment. As insulin sensitivity is increased in 
diabetic patients with renal impairment, caution is advised when titrating these patients. 
Hepatic impairment 
No clinical studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic insufficiency. 
Debilitated or malnourished patients 
In debilitated or malnourished patients the initial and maintenance dosage should be conservative and 
careful dose titration is required to avoid hypoglycaemic reactions. 
Patients receiving other oral hypoglycaemic medicinal products 
Patients can be transferred directly from other oral hypoglycaemic medicinal products to repaglinide. 
However, no exact dosage relationship exists between repaglinide and the other oral hypoglycaemic 
medicinal products. The recommended maximum starting dose of patients transferred to repaglinide is 
1 mg given before main meals. 
Repaglinide can be given in combination with metformin, when the blood glucose is insufficiently 
controlled with metformin alone. In this case, the dosage of metformin should be maintained and 
repaglinide administered concomitantly. The starting dose of repaglinide is 0.5 mg, taken before main 
meals; titration is according to blood glucose response as for monotherapy. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of repaglinide in children below 18 years have not been established. No data 
are available. 
Method of administration 
Repaglinide should be taken before main meals (i.e. preprandially). 
Doses are usually taken within 15 minutes of the meal but time may vary from immediately preceding 
the meal to as long as 30 minutes before the meal (i.e. preprandially 2, 3, or 4 meals a day). Patients 
who skip a meal (or add an extra meal) should be instructed to skip (or add) a dose for that meal. 
In the case of concomitant use with other active substances refer to sections 4.4 and 4.5 to assess the 
dosage.

General 
Repaglinide should only be prescribed if poor blood glucose control and symptoms of diabetes persist 
despite adequate attempts at dieting, exercise and weight reduction. 
When a patient stabilised on any oral hypoglycaemic medicinal product is exposed to stress such as 
fever, trauma, infection or surgery, a loss of glycaemic control may occur. At such times, it may be 
necessary to discontinue repaglinide and treat with insulin on a temporary basis. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Repaglinide, like other insulin secretagogues, is capable of producing hypoglycaemia. 
Combination with insulin secretagogues 
The blood glucose-lowering effect of oral hypoglycaemic medicinal products decreases in many 
patients over time. This may be due to progression of the severity of the diabetes or to diminished 
responsiveness to the medicinal product. This phenomenon is known as secondary failure, to 
distinguish it from primary failure, where the medicinal product is ineffective in an individual patient 
when first given. Adjustment of dose and adherence to diet and exercise should be assessed before 
classifying a patient as a secondary failure. 
Repaglinide acts through a distinct binding site with a short action on the β-cells. Use of repaglinide 
in case of secondary failure to insulin secretagogues has not been investigated in clinical trials. 
Trials investigating the combination with other insulin secretagogues have not been performed. 
Combination with Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin or thiazolidinediones 
Trials of combination therapy with NPH insulin or thiazolidinediones have been performed. However, 
the benefit risk profile remains to be established when comparing to other combination therapies. 
Combination with metformin 
Combination treatment with metformin is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Acute coronary syndrome 
The use of repaglinide might be associated with an increased incidence of acute coronary syndrome 
(e.g. myocardial infarction), see sections 4.8 and 5.1. 
Concomitant use 
Repaglinide should be used with caution or be avoided in patients receiving medicinal products which 
influence repaglinide metabolism (see section 4.5). If concomitant use is necessary, careful 
monitoring of blood glucose and close clinical monitoring should be performed. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
A number of medicinal products are known to influence repaglinide metabolism. Possible interactions 
should therefore be taken into account by the physician: 
In vitro data indicate that repaglinide is metabolised predominantly by CYP2C8, but also by CYP3A4. 
Clinical data in healthy volunteers support CYP2C8 as being the most important enzyme involved in 
repaglinide metabolism with CYP3A4 playing a minor role, but the relative contribution of CYP3A4 
can be increased if CYP2C8 is inhibited. Consequently metabolism, and by that clearance of 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
repaglinide, may be altered by substances which influence these cytochrome P-450 enzymes via 
inhibition or induction. Special care should be taken when inhibitors of both CYP2C8 and 3A4 are 
co-administered simultaneously with repaglinide. 
Based on in vitro data, repaglinide appears to be a substrate for active hepatic uptake (organic anion 
transporting protein OATP1B1). Substances that inhibit OATP1B1 may likewise have the potential to 
increase plasma concentrations of repaglinide, as has been shown for ciclosporin (see below). 
The following substances may enhance and/or prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of repaglinide: 
Gemfibrozil, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketokonazole, trimethoprim, ciclosporin, deferasirox, 
clopidogrel, other antidiabetic substances, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), non selective beta 
blocking substances, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, salicylates, NSAIDs, 
octreotide, alcohol, and anabolic steroids. 
Co-administration of gemfibrozil (600 mg twice daily), an inhibitor of CYP2C8, and repaglinide (a 
single dose of 0.25 mg) increased the repaglinide AUC 8.1-fold and Cmax 2.4-fold in healthy 
volunteers. Half-life was prolonged from 1.3 hr to 3.7 hr, resulting in possibly enhanced and 
prolonged blood glucose-lowering effect of repaglinide, and plasma repaglinide concentration at 7 hr 
was increased 28.6-fold by gemfibrozil. The concomitant use of gemfibrozil and repaglinide is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Co-administration of trimethoprim (160 mg twice daily), a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor, and 
repaglinide (a single dose of 0.25 mg) increased the repaglinide AUC, Cmax and t½ (1.6-fold, 1.4-fold 
and 1.2-fold respectively) with no statistically significant effects on the blood glucose levels. This 
lack of pharmacodynamic effect was observed with a sub-therapeutic dose of repaglinide. Since the 
safety profile of this combination has not been established with dosages higher than 0.25 mg for 
repaglinide and 320 mg for trimethoprim, the concomitant use of trimethoprim with repaglinide 
should be avoided. If concomitant use is necessary, careful monitoring of blood glucose and close 
clinical monitoring should be performed (see section 4.4). 
Rifampicin, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, but also CYP2C8, acts both as an inducer and inhibitor of 
the metabolism of repaglinide. Seven days pre-treatment with rifampicin (600 mg), followed by co-
administration of repaglinide (a single dose of 4 mg) at day seven resulted in a 50% lower AUC 
(effect of a combined induction and inhibition). When repaglinide was given 24 hours after the last 
rifampicin dose, an 80% reduction of the repaglinide AUC was observed (effect of induction alone). 
Concomitant use of rifampicin and repaglinide might therefore induce a need for repaglinide dose 
adjustment which should be based on carefully monitored blood glucose concentrations at both 
initiation of rifampicin treatment (acute inhibition), following dosing (mixed inhibition and 
induction), withdrawal (induction alone) and up to approximately two weeks after withdrawal of 
rifampicin where the inductive effect of rifampicin is no longer present. It cannot be excluded that 
other inducers, e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St John’s wort, may have a similar 
effect. 
The effect of ketoconazole, a prototype of potent and competitive inhibitors of CYP3A4, on the 
pharmacokinetics of repaglinide has been studied in healthy subjects. Co-administration of 200 mg 
ketoconazole increased the repaglinide (AUC and Cmax) by 1.2-fold with profiles of blood glucose 
concentrations altered by less than 8% when administered concomitantly (a single dose of 4 mg 
repaglinide). Co-administration of 100 mg itraconazole, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, has also been 
studied in healthy volunteers, and increased the AUC by 1.4-fold. No significant effect on the glucose 
level in healthy volunteers was observed. In an interaction study in healthy volunteers, co-
administration of 250 mg clarithromycin, a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4, slightly 
increased the repaglinide (AUC) by 1.4-fold and Cmax by 1.7-fold and increased the mean incremental 
AUC of serum insulin by 1.5-fold and the maximum concentration by 1.6-fold. The exact mechanism 
of this interaction is not clear. 
In a study conducted in healthy volunteers, the concomitant administration of repaglinide (a single 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dose of 0.25 mg) and ciclosporin (repeated dose at 100 mg) increased repaglinide AUC and Cmax 
about 2.5-fold and 1.8-fold respectively. Since the interaction has not been established with dosages 
higher than 0.25 mg for repaglinide, the concomitant use of ciclosporin with repaglinide should be 
avoided. If the combination appears necessary, careful clinical and blood glucose monitoring should 
be performed (see section 4.4). 
In an interaction study with healthy volunteers, co-administration of deferasirox (30 mg/kg/day, 
4 days), a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, and repaglinide (single dose, 0.5 mg) resulted 
in an increase in repaglinide systemic exposure (AUC) to 2.3-fold (90% CI [2.03-2.63]) of control, a 
1.6-fold (90% CI [1.42-1.84]) increase in Cmax, and a small, significant decrease in blood glucose 
values. Since the interaction has not been established with dosages higher than 0.5 mg for repaglinide, 
the concomitant use of deferasirox with repaglinide should be avoided. If the combination appears 
necessary, careful clinical and blood glucose monitoring should be performed (see section 4.4). 
In an interaction study with healthy volunteers, co-administration of clopidogrel (300 mg loading 
dose), a CYP2C8 inhibitor, increased repaglinide exposure (AUC0–∞) 5.1-fold and continued 
administration (75 mg daily dose) increased repaglinide exposure (AUC0–∞) 3.9-fold. A small, 
significant decrease in blood glucose values was observed. Since the safety profile of the co-treatment 
has not been established in these patients, the concomitant use of clopidogrel and repaglinide should 
be avoided. If concomitant use is necessary, careful monitoring of blood glucose and close clinical 
monitoring should be performed (see section 4.4). 
β-blocking medicinal products may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. 
Co-administration of cimetidine, nifedipine, oestrogen, or simvastatin with repaglinide, all CYP3A4 
substrates, did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of repaglinide. 
Repaglinide had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of digoxin, 
theophylline or warfarin at steady state, when administered to healthy volunteers. Dosage adjustment 
of these compounds when co-administered with repaglinide is therefore not necessary. 
The following substances may reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of repaglinide: 
Oral contraceptives, rifampicin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, thiazides, corticosteroids, danazol, 
thyroid hormones and sympathomimetics. 
When these medications are administered to or withdrawn from a patient receiving repaglinide, the 
patient should be observed closely for changes in glycaemic control. 
When repaglinide is used together with other medicinal products that are mainly secreted by the bile, 
like repaglinide, any potential interaction should be considered. 
Paediatric population 
No interaction studies have been performed in children and adolescents. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no studies of repaglinide in pregnant women. Repaglinide should be avoided during 
pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
There are no studies in breast-feeding women. Repaglinide should not be used in breast-feeding 
women. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility 
Data from animal studies investigating effects on embryofetal and offspring development as well as 
excretion in milk is described in section 5.3. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
NovoNorm has no direct influence on the ability to drive and use machines but may cause 
hypoglycaemia.  
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be 
considered in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions are changes in blood glucose levels, i.e. 
hypoglycaemia. The occurrence of such reactions depends on individual factors, such as dietary 
habits, dosage, exercise and stress. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Based on the experience with repaglinide and with other hypoglycaemic medicinal products the 
following adverse reactions have been seen: Frequencies are defined as: common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data).

Generalised hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylactic reaction), or immunological reactions such

Refraction disorders 
Changes in blood glucose levels have been known to result in transient visual disturbances, especially 
at the commencement of treatment. Such disturbances have only been reported in very few cases after 
initiation of repaglinide treatment. No such cases have led to discontinuation of repaglinide treatment 
in clinical trials. 
Abnormal hepatic function, increased liver enzymes 
Isolated cases of increased liver enzymes have been reported during treatment with repaglinide. Most 
cases were mild and transient, and very few patients discontinued treatment due to increased liver 
enzymes. In very rare cases, severe hepatic dysfunction has been reported. 
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity reactions of the skin may occur as erythema, itching, rashes and urticaria. There is no 
reason to suspect cross-allergenicity with sulphonylurea due to the difference in chemical structure. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Repaglinide has been given with weekly escalating doses from 4 - 20 mg four times daily in a 6 week 
period. No safety concerns were raised. As hypoglycaemia in this study was avoided through 
increased calorie intake, a relative overdose may result in an exaggerated glucose-lowering effect with 
development of hypoglycaemic symptoms (dizziness, sweating, tremor, headache etc.). Should these 
symptoms occur, adequate action should be taken to correct the low blood glucose (oral 
carbohydrates). More severe hypoglycaemia with seizure, loss of consciousness or coma should be 
treated with intravenous glucose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmaco-therapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, other blood glucose lowering drugs, excl. 
insulins, ATC code: A10BX02 
Mechanism of action 
Repaglinide is a short-acting oral secretagogue. Repaglinide lowers the blood glucose levels acutely 
by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning β-cells 
in the pancreatic islets. 
Repaglinide closes ATP-dependent potassium channels in the β-cell membrane via a target protein 
different from other secretagogues. This depolarises the β-cell and leads to an opening of the calcium 
channels. The resulting increased calcium influx induces insulin secretion from the β-cell. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In type 2 diabetic patients, the insulinotropic response to a meal occurred within 30 minutes after an 
oral dose of repaglinide. This resulted in a blood glucose-lowering effect throughout the meal period. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The elevated insulin levels did not persist beyond the time of the meal challenge. Plasma repaglinide 
levels decreased rapidly, and low concentrations were seen in the plasma of type 2 diabetic patients 
4 hours post-administration. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
A dose-dependent decrease in blood glucose was demonstrated in type 2 diabetic patients when 
administered in doses from 0.5 to 4 mg repaglinide. 
Clinical study results have shown that repaglinide is optimally dosed in relation to main meals 
(preprandial dosing). 
Doses are usually taken within 15 minutes of the meal, but the time may vary from immediately 
preceding the meal to as long as 30 minutes before the meal. 
One epidemiological study suggested an increased risk of acute coronary syndrome in repaglinide 
treated patients as compared to sulfonylurea treated patients (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Repaglinide is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, which leads to a rapid increase in the 
plasma concentration of the active substance. The peak plasma level occurs within one hour post 
administration. After reaching a maximum, the plasma level decreases rapidly. 
Repaglinide pharmacokinetics are characterised by a mean absolute bioavailability of 63% (CV 11%). 
No clinically relevant differences were seen in the pharmacokinetics of repaglinide, when repaglinide 
was administered 0, 15 or 30 minutes before a meal or in fasting state. 
A high interindividual variability (60%) in repaglinide plasma concentrations has been detected in the 
clinical trials. Intraindividual variability is low to moderate (35%) and as repaglinide should be 
titrated against the clinical response, efficacy is not affected by interindividual variability. 
Distribution 
Repaglinide pharmacokinetics are characterised by low volume of distribution, 30 L (consistent with 
distribution into intracellular fluid) and is highly bound to plasma proteins in humans (greater than 
98%). 
Elimination 
Repaglinide is eliminated rapidly within 4 - 6 hours from the blood. The plasma elimination half-life 
is approximately one hour. 
Repaglinide is almost completely metabolised, and no metabolites with clinically relevant 
hypoglycaemic effect have been identified. 
Repaglinide metabolites are excreted primarily via the bile. A small fraction (less than 8%) of the 
administered dose appears in the urine, primarily as metabolites. Less than 1% of repaglinide is 
recovered in faeces. 
Special patient groups 
Repaglinide exposure is increased in patients with hepatic insufficiency and in the elderly type 2 
diabetic patients. The AUC (SD) after 2 mg single dose exposure (4 mg in patients with hepatic 
insufficiency) was 31.4 ng/ml x hr (28.3) in healthy volunteers, 304.9 ng/ml x hr (228.0) in patients 
with hepatic insufficiency, and 117.9 ng/ml x hr (83.8) in the elderly type 2 diabetic patients. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After a 5 day treatment of repaglinide (2 mg x 3/day) in patients with a severe impaired renal function 
(creatinine clearance: 20-39 ml/min.), the results showed a significant 2-fold increase of the exposure 
(AUC) and half-life (t1/2) as compared to patients with normal renal function. 
Paediatric population 
No data are available. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. 
Repaglinide was shown not to be teratogenic in animal studies. Embryotoxicity, abnormal limb 
development in rat foetuses and new born pups, was observed in female rats exposed to high doses in 
the last stage of pregnancy and during the lactation period. Repaglinide was detected in the milk of 
animals.

2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each tablet contains 1 mg of repaglinide. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Tablet 
Repaglinide tablets are yellow, round and convex and engraved with Novo Nordisk logo (Apis bull). 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Repaglinide is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose hyperglycaemia can no longer 
be controlled satisfactorily by diet, weight reduction and exercise. Repaglinide is also indicated in 
combination with metformin in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not satisfactorily 
controlled on metformin alone. 
Treatment should be initiated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to lower the blood glucose in relation 
to meals. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Repaglinide is given preprandially and is titrated individually to optimise glycaemic control. In 
addition to the usual self-monitoring by the patient of blood and/or urinary glucose, the patient’s 
blood glucose must be monitored periodically by the physician to determine the minimum effective 
dose for the patient. Glycosylated haemoglobin levels are also of value in monitoring the patient’s 
response to therapy. Periodic monitoring is necessary to detect inadequate lowering of blood glucose 
at the recommended maximum dose level (i.e. primary failure) and to detect loss of adequate blood 
glucose-lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness (i.e. secondary failure). 
Short-term administration of repaglinide may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control 
in type 2 diabetic patients usually controlled well on diet. 
Initial dose 
The dosage should be determined by the physician, according to the patient’s requirements. 
The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg. One to two weeks should elapse between titration steps (as 
determined by blood glucose response). 
If patients are transferred from another oral hypoglycaemic medicinal product, the recommended 
starting dose is 1 mg. 
Maintenance 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The recommended maximum single dose is 4 mg taken with main meals. 
The total maximum daily dose should not exceed 16 mg. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No clinical studies have been conducted in patients >75 years of age. 
Renal impairment 
Repaglinide is not affected by renal disorders (see section 5.2). 
Eight percent of one dose of repaglinide is excreted through the kidneys and total plasma clearance of 
the product is decreased in patients with renal impairment. As insulin sensitivity is increased in 
diabetic patients with renal impairment, caution is advised when titrating these patients. 
Hepatic impairment 
No clinical studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic insufficiency. 
Debilitated or malnourished patients 
In debilitated or malnourished patients the initial and maintenance dosage should be conservative and 
careful dose titration is required to avoid hypoglycaemic reactions. 
Patients receiving other oral hypoglycaemic medicinal products 
Patients can be transferred directly from other oral hypoglycaemic medicinal products to repaglinide. 
However, no exact dosage relationship exists between repaglinide and the other oral hypoglycaemic 
medicinal products. The recommended maximum starting dose of patients transferred to repaglinide is 
1 mg given before main meals. 
Repaglinide can be given in combination with metformin, when the blood glucose is insufficiently 
controlled with metformin alone. In this case, the dosage of metformin should be maintained and 
repaglinide administered concomitantly. The starting dose of repaglinide is 0.5 mg, taken before main 
meals; titration is according to blood glucose response as for monotherapy. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of repaglinide in children below 18 years have not been established. No data 
are available. 
Method of administration 
Repaglinide should be taken before main meals (i.e. preprandially). 
Doses are usually taken within 15 minutes of the meal but time may vary from immediately preceding 
the meal to as long as 30 minutes before the meal (i.e. preprandially 2, 3, or 4 meals a day). Patients 
who skip a meal (or add an extra meal) should be instructed to skip (or add) a dose for that meal. 
In the case of concomitant use with other active substances refer to sections 4.4 and 4.5 to assess the 
dosage.

General 
Repaglinide should only be prescribed if poor blood glucose control and symptoms of diabetes persist 
despite adequate attempts at dieting, exercise and weight reduction. 
When a patient stabilised on any oral hypoglycaemic medicinal product is exposed to stress such as 
fever, trauma, infection or surgery, a loss of glycaemic control may occur. At such times, it may be 
necessary to discontinue repaglinide and treat with insulin on a temporary basis. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Repaglinide, like other insulin secretagogues, is capable of producing hypoglycaemia. 
Combination with insulin secretagogues 
The blood glucose-lowering effect of oral hypoglycaemic medicinal products decreases in many 
patients over time. This may be due to progression of the severity of the diabetes or to diminished 
responsiveness to the medicinal product. This phenomenon is known as secondary failure, to 
distinguish it from primary failure, where the medicinal product is ineffective in an individual patient 
when first given. Adjustment of dose and adherence to diet and exercise should be assessed before 
classifying a patient as a secondary failure. 
Repaglinide acts through a distinct binding site with a short action on the β-cells. Use of repaglinide 
in case of secondary failure to insulin secretagogues has not been investigated in clinical trials. 
Trials investigating the combination with other insulin secretagogues have not been performed. 
Combination with Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin or thiazolidinediones 
Trials of combination therapy with NPH insulin or thiazolidinediones have been performed. However, 
the benefit risk profile remains to be established when comparing to other combination therapies. 
Combination with metformin 
Combination treatment with metformin is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Acute coronary syndrome 
The use of repaglinide might be associated with an increased incidence of acute coronary syndrome 
(e.g. myocardial infarction), see sections 4.8 and 5.1. 
Concomitant use 
Repaglinide should be used with caution or be avoided in patients receiving medicinal products which 
influence repaglinide metabolism (see section 4.5). If concomitant use is necessary, careful 
monitoring of blood glucose and close clinical monitoring should be performed. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
A number of medicinal products are known to influence repaglinide metabolism. Possible interactions 
should therefore be taken into account by the physician: 
In vitro data indicate that repaglinide is metabolised predominantly by CYP2C8, but also by CYP3A4. 
Clinical data in healthy volunteers support CYP2C8 as being the most important enzyme involved in 
repaglinide metabolism with CYP3A4 playing a minor role, but the relative contribution of CYP3A4 
can be increased if CYP2C8 is inhibited. Consequently metabolism, and by that clearance of 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
repaglinide, may be altered by substances which influence these cytochrome P-450 enzymes via 
inhibition or induction. Special care should be taken when inhibitors of both CYP2C8 and 3A4 are 
co-administered simultaneously with repaglinide. 
Based on in vitro data, repaglinide appears to be a substrate for active hepatic uptake (organic anion 
transporting protein OATP1B1). Substances that inhibit OATP1B1 may likewise have the potential to 
increase plasma concentrations of repaglinide, as has been shown for ciclosporin (see below). 
The following substances may enhance and/or prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of repaglinide: 
Gemfibrozil, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketokonazole, trimethoprim, ciclosporin, deferasirox, 
clopidogrel, other antidiabetic substances, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), non selective beta 
blocking substances, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, salicylates, NSAIDs, 
octreotide, alcohol, and anabolic steroids. 
Co-administration of gemfibrozil (600 mg twice daily), an inhibitor of CYP2C8, and repaglinide (a 
single dose of 0.25 mg) increased the repaglinide AUC 8.1-fold and Cmax 2.4-fold in healthy 
volunteers. Half-life was prolonged from 1.3 hr to 3.7 hr, resulting in possibly enhanced and 
prolonged blood glucose-lowering effect of repaglinide, and plasma repaglinide concentration at 7 hr 
was increased 28.6-fold by gemfibrozil. The concomitant use of gemfibrozil and repaglinide is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Co-administration of trimethoprim (160 mg twice daily), a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor, and 
repaglinide (a single dose of 0.25 mg) increased the repaglinide AUC, Cmax and t½ (1.6-fold, 1.4-fold 
and 1.2-fold respectively) with no statistically significant effects on the blood glucose levels. This 
lack of pharmacodynamic effect was observed with a sub-therapeutic dose of repaglinide. Since the 
safety profile of this combination has not been established with dosages higher than 0.25 mg for 
repaglinide and 320 mg for trimethoprim, the concomitant use of trimethoprim with repaglinide 
should be avoided. If concomitant use is necessary, careful monitoring of blood glucose and close 
clinical monitoring should be performed (see section 4.4). 
Rifampicin, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, but also CYP2C8, acts both as an inducer and inhibitor of 
the metabolism of repaglinide. Seven days pre-treatment with rifampicin (600 mg), followed by co-
administration of repaglinide (a single dose of 4 mg) at day seven resulted in a 50% lower AUC 
(effect of a combined induction and inhibition). When repaglinide was given 24 hours after the last 
rifampicin dose, an 80% reduction of the repaglinide AUC was observed (effect of induction alone). 
Concomitant use of rifampicin and repaglinide might therefore induce a need for repaglinide dose 
adjustment which should be based on carefully monitored blood glucose concentrations at both 
initiation of rifampicin treatment (acute inhibition), following dosing (mixed inhibition and 
induction), withdrawal (induction alone) and up to approximately two weeks after withdrawal of 
rifampicin where the inductive effect of rifampicin is no longer present. It cannot be excluded that 
other inducers, e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St John’s wort, may have a similar 
effect. 
The effect of ketoconazole, a prototype of potent and competitive inhibitors of CYP3A4, on the 
pharmacokinetics of repaglinide has been studied in healthy subjects. Co-administration of 200 mg 
ketoconazole increased the repaglinide (AUC and Cmax) by 1.2-fold with profiles of blood glucose 
concentrations altered by less than 8% when administered concomitantly (a single dose of 4 mg 
repaglinide). Co-administration of 100 mg itraconazole, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, has also been 
studied in healthy volunteers, and increased the AUC by 1.4-fold. No significant effect on the glucose 
level in healthy volunteers was observed. In an interaction study in healthy volunteers, co-
administration of 250 mg clarithromycin, a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4, slightly 
increased the repaglinide (AUC) by 1.4-fold and Cmax by 1.7-fold and increased the mean incremental 
AUC of serum insulin by 1.5-fold and the maximum concentration by 1.6-fold. The exact mechanism 
of this interaction is not clear. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a study conducted in healthy volunteers, the concomitant administration of repaglinide (a single 
dose of 0.25 mg) and ciclosporin (repeated dose at 100 mg) increased repaglinide AUC and Cmax about 
2.5-fold and 1.8-fold respectively. Since the interaction has not been established with dosages higher 
than 0.25 mg for repaglinide, the concomitant use of ciclosporin with repaglinide should be avoided. 
If the combination appears necessary, careful clinical and blood glucose monitoring should be 
performed (see section 4.4). 
In an interaction study with healthy volunteers, co-administration of deferasirox (30 mg/kg/day, 
4 days), a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, and repaglinide (single dose, 0.5 mg) resulted 
in an increase in repaglinide systemic exposure (AUC) to 2.3-fold (90% CI [2.03-2.63]) of control, a 
1.6-fold (90% CI [1.42-1.84]) increase in Cmax, and a small, significant decrease in blood glucose 
values. Since the interaction has not been established with dosages higher than 0.5 mg for repaglinide, 
the concomitant use of deferasirox with repaglinide should be avoided. If the combination appears 
necessary, careful clinical and blood glucose monitoring should be performed (see section 4.4). 
In an interaction study with healthy volunteers, co-administration of clopidogrel (300 mg loading 
dose), a CYP2C8 inhibitor, increased repaglinide exposure (AUC0–∞) 5.1-fold and continued 
administration (75 mg daily dose) increased repaglinide exposure (AUC0–∞) 3.9-fold. A small, 
significant decrease in blood glucose values was observed. Since the safety profile of the co-treatment 
has not been established in these patients, the concomitant use of clopidogrel and repaglinide should 
be avoided. If concomitant use is necessary, careful monitoring of blood glucose and close clinical 
monitoring should be performed (see section 4.4). 
β-blocking medicinal products may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. 
Co-administration of cimetidine, nifedipine, oestrogen, or simvastatin with repaglinide, all CYP3A4 
substrates, did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of repaglinide. 
Repaglinide had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of digoxin, 
theophylline or warfarin at steady state, when administered to healthy volunteers. Dosage adjustment 
of these compounds when co-administered with repaglinide is therefore not necessary. 
The following substances may reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of repaglinide: 
Oral contraceptives, rifampicin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, thiazides, corticosteroids, danazol, 
thyroid hormones and sympathomimetics. 
When these medications are administered to or withdrawn from a patient receiving repaglinide, the 
patient should be observed closely for changes in glycaemic control. 
When repaglinide is used together with other medicinal products that are mainly secreted by the bile, 
like repaglinide, any potential interaction should be considered. 
Paediatric population 
No interaction studies have been performed in children and adolescents. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no studies of repaglinide in pregnant women. Repaglinide should be avoided during 
pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are no studies in breast-feeding women. Repaglinide should not be used in breast-feeding 
women. 
Fertility 
Data from animal studies investigating effects on embryofetal and offspring development as well as 
excretion in milk is described in section 5.3. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
NovoNorm has no direct influence on the ability to drive and use machines but may cause 
hypoglycaemia. 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be 
considered in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions are changes in blood glucose levels, i.e. 
hypoglycaemia. The occurrence of such reactions depends on individual factors, such as dietary 
habits, dosage, exercise and stress. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Based on the experience with repaglinide and with other hypoglycaemic medicinal products the 
following adverse reactions have been seen: Frequencies are defined as: common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data).

Allergic reactions 
Generalised hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylactic reaction), or immunological reactions such 
as vasculitis. 
Refraction disorders 
Changes in blood glucose levels have been known to result in transient visual disturbances, especially 
at the commencement of treatment. Such disturbances have only been reported in very few cases after 
initiation of repaglinide treatment. No such cases have led to discontinuation of repaglinide treatment 
in clinical trials. 
Abnormal hepatic function, increased liver enzymes 
Isolated cases of increased liver enzymes have been reported during treatment with repaglinide. Most 
cases were mild and transient, and very few patients discontinued treatment due to increased liver 
enzymes. In very rare cases, severe hepatic dysfunction has been reported. 
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity reactions of the skin may occur as erythema, itching, rashes and urticaria. There is no 
reason to suspect cross-allergenicity with sulphonylurea due to the difference in chemical structure. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Repaglinide has been given with weekly escalating doses from 4 - 20 mg four times daily in a 6 week 
period. No safety concerns were raised. As hypoglycaemia in this study was avoided through 
increased calorie intake, a relative overdose may result in an exaggerated glucose-lowering effect with 
development of hypoglycaemic symptoms (dizziness, sweating, tremor, headache etc.). Should these 
symptoms occur, adequate action should be taken to correct the low blood glucose (oral 
carbohydrates). More severe hypoglycaemia with seizure, loss of consciousness or coma should be 
treated with intravenous glucose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmaco-therapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, other blood glucose lowering drugs, excl. 
insulins, ATC code: A10BX02 
Mechanism of action 
Repaglinide is a short-acting oral secretagogue. Repaglinide lowers the blood glucose levels acutely 
by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning β-cells 
in the pancreatic islets. 
Repaglinide closes ATP-dependent potassium channels in the β-cell membrane via a target protein 
different from other secretagogues. This depolarises the β-cell and leads to an opening of the calcium 
channels. The resulting increased calcium influx induces insulin secretion from the β-cell. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In type 2 diabetic patients, the insulinotropic response to a meal occurred within 30 minutes after an 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
oral dose of repaglinide. This resulted in a blood glucose-lowering effect throughout the meal period. 
The elevated insulin levels did not persist beyond the time of the meal challenge. Plasma repaglinide 
levels decreased rapidly, and low concentrations were seen in the plasma of type 2 diabetic patients 
4 hours post-administration. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
A dose-dependent decrease in blood glucose was demonstrated in type 2 diabetic patients when 
administered in doses from 0.5 to 4 mg repaglinide. 
Clinical study results have shown that repaglinide is optimally dosed in relation to main meals 
(preprandial dosing). 
Doses are usually taken within 15 minutes of the meal, but the time may vary from immediately 
preceding the meal to as long as 30 minutes before the meal. 
One epidemiological study suggested an increased risk of acute coronary syndrome in repaglinide 
treated patients as compared to sulfonylurea treated patients (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Repaglinide is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, which leads to a rapid increase in the 
plasma concentration of the active substance. The peak plasma level occurs within one hour post 
administration. After reaching a maximum, the plasma level decreases rapidly. 
Repaglinide pharmacokinetics are characterised by a mean absolute bioavailability of 63% (CV 11%). 
No clinically relevant differences were seen in the pharmacokinetics of repaglinide, when repaglinide 
was administered 0, 15 or 30 minutes before a meal or in fasting state. 
A high interindividual variability (60%) in repaglinide plasma concentrations has been detected in the 
clinical trials. Intraindividual variability is low to moderate (35%) and as repaglinide should be 
titrated against the clinical response, efficacy is not affected by interindividual variability. 
Distribution 
Repaglinide pharmacokinetics are characterised by low volume of distribution, 30 L (consistent with 
distribution into intracellular fluid) and is highly bound to plasma proteins in humans (greater than 
98%). 
Elimination 
Repaglinide is eliminated rapidly within 4 - 6 hours from the blood. The plasma elimination half-life 
is approximately one hour. 
Repaglinide is almost completely metabolised, and no metabolites with clinically relevant 
hypoglycaemic effect have been identified. 
Repaglinide metabolites are excreted primarily via the bile. A small fraction (less than 8%) of the 
administered dose appears in the urine, primarily as metabolites. Less than 1% of repaglinide is 
recovered in faeces. 
Special patient groups 
Repaglinide exposure is increased in patients with hepatic insufficiency and in the elderly type 2 
diabetic patients. The AUC (SD) after 2 mg single dose exposure (4 mg in patients with hepatic 
insufficiency) was 31.4 ng/ml x hr (28.3) in healthy volunteers, 304.9 ng/ml x hr (228.0) in patients 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with hepatic insufficiency, and 117.9 ng/ml x hr (83.8) in the elderly type 2 diabetic patients. 
After a 5 day treatment of repaglinide (2 mg x 3/day) in patients with a severe impaired renal function 
(creatinine clearance: 20-39 ml/min.), the results showed a significant 2-fold increase of the exposure 
(AUC) and half-life (t1/2) as compared to patients with normal renal function. 
Paediatric population 
No data are available. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. 
Repaglinide was shown not to be teratogenic in animal studies. Embryotoxicity, abnormal limb 
development in rat foetuses and new born pups, was observed in female rats exposed to high doses in 
the last stage of pregnancy and during the lactation period. Repaglinide was detected in the milk of 
animals.

2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each tablet contains 2 mg of repaglinide. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Tablet 
Repaglinide tablets are peach-coloured, round and convex and engraved with Novo Nordisk logo 
(Apis bull). 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Repaglinide is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose hyperglycaemia can no longer 
be controlled satisfactorily by diet, weight reduction and exercise. Repaglinide is also indicated in 
combination with metformin in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not satisfactorily 
controlled on metformin alone. 
Treatment should be initiated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to lower the blood glucose in relation 
to meals. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Repaglinide is given preprandially and is titrated individually to optimise glycaemic control. In 
addition to the usual self-monitoring by the patient of blood and/or urinary glucose, the patient’s 
blood glucose must be monitored periodically by the physician to determine the minimum effective 
dose for the patient. Glycosylated haemoglobin levels are also of value in monitoring the patient’s 
response to therapy. Periodic monitoring is necessary to detect inadequate lowering of blood glucose 
at the recommended maximum dose level (i.e. primary failure) and to detect loss of adequate blood 
glucose-lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness (i.e. secondary failure). 
Short-term administration of repaglinide may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control 
in type 2 diabetic patients usually controlled well on diet. 
Initial dose 
The dosage should be determined by the physician, according to the patient’s requirements. 
The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg. One to two weeks should elapse between titration steps (as 
determined by blood glucose response). 
If patients are transferred from another oral hypoglycaemic medicinal product, the recommended 
starting dose is 1 mg. 
Maintenance 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The recommended maximum single dose is 4 mg taken with main meals. 
The total maximum daily dose should not exceed 16 mg. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No clinical studies have been conducted in patients >75 years of age. 
Renal impairment 
Repaglinide is not affected by renal disorders (see section 5.2). 
Eight percent of one dose of repaglinide is excreted through the kidneys and total plasma clearance of 
the product is decreased in patients with renal impairment. As insulin sensitivity is increased in 
diabetic patients with renal impairment, caution is advised when titrating these patients. 
Hepatic impairment 
No clinical studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic insufficiency. 
Debilitated or malnourished patients 
In debilitated or malnourished patients the initial and maintenance dosage should be conservative and 
careful dose titration is required to avoid hypoglycaemic reactions. 
Patients receiving other oral hypoglycaemic medicinal products 
Patients can be transferred directly from other oral hypoglycaemic medicinal products to repaglinide. 
However, no exact dosage relationship exists between repaglinide and the other oral hypoglycaemic 
medicinal products. The recommended maximum starting dose of patients transferred to repaglinide is 
1 mg given before main meals. 
Repaglinide can be given in combination with metformin, when the blood glucose is insufficiently 
controlled with metformin alone. In this case, the dosage of metformin should be maintained and 
repaglinide administered concomitantly. The starting dose of repaglinide is 0.5 mg, taken before main 
meals; titration is according to blood glucose response as for monotherapy. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of repaglinide in children below 18 years have not been established. No data 
are available. 
Method of administration 
Repaglinide should be taken before main meals (i.e. preprandially). 
Doses are usually taken within 15 minutes of the meal but time may vary from immediately preceding 
the meal to as long as 30 minutes before the meal (i.e. preprandially 2, 3, or 4 meals a day). Patients 
who skip a meal (or add an extra meal) should be instructed to skip (or add) a dose for that meal. 
In the case of concomitant use with other active substances refer to sections 4.4 and 4.5 to assess the 
dosage.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
Repaglinide should only be prescribed if poor blood glucose control and symptoms of diabetes persist 
despite adequate attempts at dieting, exercise and weight reduction. 
When a patient stabilised on any oral hypoglycaemic medicinal product is exposed to stress such as 
fever, trauma, infection or surgery, a loss of glycaemic control may occur. At such times, it may be 
necessary to discontinue repaglinide and treat with insulin on a temporary basis. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Repaglinide, like other insulin secretagogues, is capable of producing hypoglycaemia. 
Combination with insulin secretagogues 
The blood glucose-lowering effect of oral hypoglycaemic medicinal products decreases in many 
patients over time. This may be due to progression of the severity of the diabetes or to diminished 
responsiveness to the medicinal product. This phenomenon is known as secondary failure, to 
distinguish it from primary failure, where the medicinal product is ineffective in an individual patient 
when first given. Adjustment of dose and adherence to diet and exercise should be assessed before 
classifying a patient as a secondary failure. 
Repaglinide acts through a distinct binding site with a short action on the β-cells. Use of repaglinide 
in case of secondary failure to insulin secretagogues has not been investigated in clinical trials. 
Trials investigating the combination with other insulin secretagogues have not been performed. 
Combination with Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin or thiazolidinediones 
Trials of combination therapy with NPH insulin or thiazolidinediones have been performed. However, 
the benefit risk profile remains to be established when comparing to other combination therapies. 
Combination with metformin 
Combination treatment with metformin is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Acute coronary syndrome 
The use of repaglinide might be associated with an increased incidence of acute coronary syndrome 
(e.g. myocardial infarction), see sections 4.8 and 5.1. 
Concomitant use 
Repaglinide should be used with caution or be avoided in patients receiving medicinal products which 
influence repaglinide metabolism (see section 4.5). If concomitant use is necessary, careful 
monitoring of blood glucose and close clinical monitoring should be performed. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
A number of medicinal products are known to influence repaglinide metabolism. Possible interactions 
should therefore be taken into account by the physician: 
In vitro data indicate that repaglinide is metabolised predominantly by CYP2C8, but also by CYP3A4. 
Clinical data in healthy volunteers support CYP2C8 as being the most important enzyme involved in 
repaglinide metabolism with CYP3A4 playing a minor role, but the relative contribution of CYP3A4

can be increased if CYP2C8 is inhibited. Consequently metabolism, and by that clearance of 
repaglinide, may be altered by substances which influence these cytochrome P-450 enzymes via 
inhibition or induction. Special care should be taken when inhibitors of both CYP2C8 and 3A4 are 
co-administered simultaneously with repaglinide. 
Based on in vitro data, repaglinide appears to be a substrate for active hepatic uptake (organic anion 
transporting protein OATP1B1). Substances that inhibit OATP1B1 may likewise have the potential to 
increase plasma concentrations of repaglinide, as has been shown for ciclosporin (see below). 
The following substances may enhance and/or prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of repaglinide: 
Gemfibrozil, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketokonazole, trimethoprim, ciclosporin, deferasirox, 
clopidogrel, other antidiabetic substances, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), non selective beta 
blocking substances, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, salicylates, NSAIDs, 
octreotide, alcohol, and anabolic steroids. 
Co-administration of gemfibrozil (600 mg twice daily), an inhibitor of CYP2C8, and repaglinide (a 
single dose of 0.25 mg) increased the repaglinide AUC 8.1-fold and Cmax 2.4-fold in healthy 
volunteers. Half-life was prolonged from 1.3 hr to 3.7 hr, resulting in possibly enhanced and 
prolonged blood glucose-lowering effect of repaglinide, and plasma repaglinide concentration at 7 hr 
was increased 28.6-fold by gemfibrozil. The concomitant use of gemfibrozil and repaglinide is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Co-administration of trimethoprim (160 mg twice daily), a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor, and 
repaglinide (a single dose of 0.25 mg) increased the repaglinide AUC, Cmax and t½ (1.6-fold, 1.4-fold 
and 1.2-fold respectively) with no statistically significant effects on the blood glucose levels. This 
lack of pharmacodynamic effect was observed with a sub-therapeutic dose of repaglinide. Since the 
safety profile of this combination has not been established with dosages higher than 0.25 mg for 
repaglinide and 320 mg for trimethoprim, the concomitant use of trimethoprim with repaglinide 
should be avoided. If concomitant use is necessary, careful monitoring of blood glucose and close 
clinical monitoring should be performed (see section 4.4). 
Rifampicin, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, but also CYP2C8, acts both as an inducer and inhibitor of 
the metabolism of repaglinide. Seven days pre-treatment with rifampicin (600 mg), followed by co-
administration of repaglinide (a single dose of 4 mg) at day seven resulted in a 50% lower AUC 
(effect of a combined induction and inhibition). When repaglinide was given 24 hours after the last 
rifampicin dose, an 80% reduction of the repaglinide AUC was observed (effect of induction alone). 
Concomitant use of rifampicin and repaglinide might therefore induce a need for repaglinide dose 
adjustment which should be based on carefully monitored blood glucose concentrations at both 
initiation of rifampicin treatment (acute inhibition), following dosing (mixed inhibition and 
induction), withdrawal (induction alone) and up to approximately two weeks after withdrawal of 
rifampicin where the inductive effect of rifampicin is no longer present. It cannot be excluded that 
other inducers, e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St John’s wort, may have a similar 
effect. 
The effect of ketoconazole, a prototype of potent and competitive inhibitors of CYP3A4, on the 
pharmacokinetics of repaglinide has been studied in healthy subjects. Co-administration of 200 mg 
ketoconazole increased the repaglinide (AUC and Cmax) by 1.2-fold with profiles of blood glucose 
concentrations altered by less than 8% when administered concomitantly (a single dose of 4 mg 
repaglinide). Co-administration of 100 mg itraconazole, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, has also been 
studied in healthy volunteers, and increased the AUC by 1.4-fold. No significant effect on the glucose 
level in healthy volunteers was observed. In an interaction study in healthy volunteers, co-
administration of 250 mg clarithromycin, a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4, slightly 
increased the repaglinide (AUC) by 1.4-fold and Cmax by 1.7-fold and increased the mean incremental 
AUC of serum insulin by 1.5-fold and the maximum concentration by 1.6-fold. The exact mechanism 
of this interaction is not clear. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a study conducted in healthy volunteers, the concomitant administration of repaglinide (a single 
dose of 0.25 mg) and ciclosporin (repeated dose at 100 mg) increased repaglinide AUC and Cmax about 
2.5-fold and 1.8-fold respectively. Since the interaction has not been established with dosages higher 
than 0.25 mg for repaglinide, the concomitant use of ciclosporin with repaglinide should be avoided. 
If the combination appears necessary, careful clinical and blood glucose monitoring should be 
performed (see section 4.4). 
In an interaction study with healthy volunteers, co-administration of deferasirox (30 mg/kg/day, 
4 days), a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, and repaglinide (single dose, 0.5 mg) resulted 
in an increase in repaglinide systemic exposure (AUC) to 2.3-fold (90% CI [2.03-2.63]) of control, a 
1.6-fold (90% CI [1.42-1.84]) increase in Cmax, and a small, significant decrease in blood glucose 
values. Since the interaction has not been established with dosages higher than 0.5 mg for repaglinide, 
the concomitant use of deferasirox with repaglinide should be avoided. If the combination appears 
necessary, careful clinical and blood glucose monitoring should be performed (see section 4.4). 
In an interaction study with healthy volunteers, co-administration of clopidogrel (300 mg loading 
dose), a CYP2C8 inhibitor, increased repaglinide exposure (AUC0–∞) 5.1-fold and continued 
administration (75 mg daily dose) increased repaglinide exposure (AUC0–∞) 3.9-fold. A small, 
significant decrease in blood glucose values was observed. Since the safety profile of the co-treatment 
has not been established in these patients, the concomitant use of clopidogrel and repaglinide should 
be avoided. If concomitant use is necessary, careful monitoring of blood glucose and close clinical 
monitoring should be performed (see section 4.4). 
β-blocking medicinal products may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. 
Co-administration of cimetidine, nifedipine, oestrogen, or simvastatin with repaglinide, all CYP3A4 
substrates, did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of repaglinide. 
Repaglinide had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of digoxin, 
theophylline or warfarin at steady state, when administered to healthy volunteers. Dosage adjustment 
of these compounds when co-administered with repaglinide is therefore not necessary. 
The following substances may reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of repaglinide: 
Oral contraceptives, rifampicin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, thiazides, corticosteroids, danazol, 
thyroid hormones and sympathomimetics. 
When these medications are administered to or withdrawn from a patient receiving repaglinide, the 
patient should be observed closely for changes in glycaemic control. 
When repaglinide is used together with other medicinal products that are mainly secreted by the bile, 
like repaglinide, any potential interaction should be considered. 
Paediatric population 
No interaction studies have been performed in children and adolescents.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no studies of repaglinide in pregnant women. Repaglinide should be avoided during 
pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are no studies in breast-feeding women. Repaglinide should not be used in breast-feeding 
women. 
Fertility 
Data from animal studies investigating effects on embryofetal and offspring development as well as 
excretion in milk is described in section 5.3. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
NovoNorm has no direct influence on the ability to drive and use machines but may cause 
hypoglycaemia.  
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be 
considered in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions are changes in blood glucose levels, i.e. 
hypoglycaemia. The occurrence of such reactions depends on individual factors, such as dietary 
habits, dosage, exercise and stress. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Based on the experience with repaglinide and with other hypoglycaemic medicinal products the 
following adverse reactions have been seen: Frequencies are defined as: common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data).

Allergic reactions 
Generalised hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylactic reaction), or immunological reactions such 
as vasculitis. 
Refraction disorders 
Changes in blood glucose levels have been known to result in transient visual disturbances, especially 
at the commencement of treatment. Such disturbances have only been reported in very few cases after 
initiation of repaglinide treatment. No such cases have led to discontinuation of repaglinide treatment 
in clinical trials. 
Abnormal hepatic function, increased liver enzymes 
Isolated cases of increased liver enzymes have been reported during treatment with repaglinide. Most 
cases were mild and transient, and very few patients discontinued treatment due to increased liver 
enzymes. In very rare cases, severe hepatic dysfunction has been reported. 
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity reactions of the skin may occur as erythema, itching, rashes and urticaria. There is no 
reason to suspect cross-allergenicity with sulphonylurea due to the difference in chemical structure. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Repaglinide has been given with weekly escalating doses from 4 - 20 mg four times daily in a 6 week 
period. No safety concerns were raised. As hypoglycaemia in this study was avoided through 
increased calorie intake, a relative overdose may result in an exaggerated glucose-lowering effect with 
development of hypoglycaemic symptoms (dizziness, sweating, tremor, headache etc.). Should these 
symptoms occur, adequate action should be taken to correct the low blood glucose (oral 
carbohydrates). More severe hypoglycaemia with seizure, loss of consciousness or coma should be 
treated with intravenous glucose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmaco-therapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, other blood glucose lowering drugs, excl. 
insulins, ATC code: A10BX02 
Mechanism of action 
Repaglinide is a short-acting oral secretagogue. Repaglinide lowers the blood glucose levels acutely 
by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning β-cells 
in the pancreatic islets. 
Repaglinide closes ATP-dependent potassium channels in the β-cell membrane via a target protein 
different from other secretagogues. This depolarises the β-cell and leads to an opening of the calcium 
channels. The resulting increased calcium influx induces insulin secretion from the β-cell. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In type 2 diabetic patients, the insulinotropic response to a meal occurred within 30 minutes after an 
oral dose of repaglinide. This resulted in a blood glucose-lowering effect throughout the meal period. 
The elevated insulin levels did not persist beyond the time of the meal challenge. Plasma repaglinide 
levels decreased rapidly, and low concentrations were seen in the plasma of type 2 diabetic patients 
4 hours post-administration. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
A dose-dependent decrease in blood glucose was demonstrated in type 2 diabetic patients when 
administered in doses from 0.5 to 4 mg repaglinide. 
Clinical study results have shown that repaglinide is optimally dosed in relation to main meals 
(preprandial dosing). 
Doses are usually taken within 15 minutes of the meal, but the time may vary from immediately 
preceding the meal to as long as 30 minutes before the meal. 
One epidemiological study suggested an increased risk of acute coronary syndrome in repaglinide 
treated patients as compared to sulfonylurea treated patients (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Repaglinide is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, which leads to a rapid increase in the 
plasma concentration of the active substance. The peak plasma level occurs within one hour post 
administration. After reaching a maximum, the plasma level decreases rapidly. 
Repaglinide pharmacokinetics are characterised by a mean absolute bioavailability of 63% (CV 11%). 
No clinically relevant differences were seen in the pharmacokinetics of repaglinide, when repaglinide 
was administered 0, 15 or 30 minutes before a meal or in fasting state. 
A high interindividual variability (60%) in repaglinide plasma concentrations has been detected in the 
clinical trials. Intraindividual variability is low to moderate (35%) and as repaglinide should be 
titrated against the clinical response, efficacy is not affected by interindividual variability. 
Distribution 
Repaglinide pharmacokinetics are characterised by low volume of distribution, 30 L (consistent with 
distribution into intracellular fluid) and is highly bound to plasma proteins in humans (greater than 
98%). 
Elimination 
Repaglinide is eliminated rapidly within 4 - 6 hours from the blood. The plasma elimination half-life 
is approximately one hour. 
Repaglinide is almost completely metabolised, and no metabolites with clinically relevant 
hypoglycaemic effect have been identified. 
Repaglinide metabolites are excreted primarily via the bile. A small fraction (less than 8%) of the 
administered dose appears in the urine, primarily as metabolites. Less than 1% of repaglinide is 
recovered in faeces. 
Special patient groups 
Repaglinide exposure is increased in patients with hepatic insufficiency and in the elderly type 2 
diabetic patients. The AUC (SD) after 2 mg single dose exposure (4 mg in patients with hepatic 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
insufficiency) was 31.4 ng/ml x hr (28.3) in healthy volunteers, 304.9 ng/ml x hr (228.0) in patients 
with hepatic insufficiency, and 117.9 ng/ml x hr (83.8) in the elderly type 2 diabetic patients. 
After a 5 day treatment of repaglinide (2 mg x 3/day) in patients with a severe impaired renal function 
(creatinine clearance: 20-39 ml/min.), the results showed a significant 2-fold increase of the exposure 
(AUC) and half-life (t1/2) as compared to patients with normal renal function. 
Paediatric population 
No data are available. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. 
Repaglinide was shown not to be teratogenic in animal studies. Embryotoxicity, abnormal limb 
development in rat foetuses and new born pups, was observed in female rats exposed to high doses in 
the last stage of pregnancy and during the lactation period. Repaglinide was detected in the milk of 
animals.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What NovoNorm is and what it is used for 
NovoNorm is an oral antidiabetic medicine containing repaglinide which helps your pancreas 
produce more insulin and thereby lower your blood sugar (glucose). 
Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the 
sugar in your blood or where your body does not respond normally to the insulin it produces. 
NovoNorm is used to control type 2 diabetes in adults as an add-on to diet and exercise: treatment is 
usually started if diet, exercise and weight reduction alone have not been able to control (or lower) 
your blood sugar. NovoNorm can also be given with metformin, another medicine for diabetes. 
NovoNorm has been shown to lower the blood sugar, which helps to prevent complications from your 
diabetes.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Cosentyx is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in children and 
adolescents from the age of 6 years who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) 
Enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) 
Cosentyx, alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the treatment of active 
enthesitis-related arthritis in patients 6 years and older whose disease has responded inadequately to, 
or who cannot tolerate, conventional therapy (see section 5.1). 
Juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) 
Cosentyx, alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the treatment of active 
juvenile psoriatic arthritis in patients 6 years and older whose disease has responded inadequately to, 
or who cannot tolerate, conventional therapy (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Cosentyx is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the 
diagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Cosentyx is indicated. 
Posology 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis (adolescents and children from the age of 6 years) 
The recommended dose is based on body weight (Table 1) and administered by subcutaneous injection 
with initial dosing at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing. Each 75 mg 
dose is given as one subcutaneous injection of 75 mg. Each 150 mg dose is given as one subcutaneous 
injection of 150 mg. Each 300 mg dose is given as one subcutaneous injection of 300 mg or as two

Cosentyx may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual 
treatment needs. 
For all of the above indications, available data suggest that a clinical response is usually achieved 
within 16 weeks of treatment. Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients 
who have shown no response by 16 weeks of treatment. Some patients with an initial partial response 
may subsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 16 weeks. 
The safety and efficacy of Cosentyx in children with plaque psoriasis and in the juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis (JIA) categories of ERA and JPsA below the age of 6 years have not been established. 
The safety and efficacy of Cosentyx in children below the age of 18 years in other indications have not 
yet been established. No data are available. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment / hepatic impairment 
Cosentyx has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. 
Method of administration 
Cosentyx is to be administered by subcutaneous injection. If possible, areas of the skin that show 
psoriasis should be avoided as injection sites. The syringe must not be shaken. 
After proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, patients may self-inject Cosentyx or be 
injected by a caregiver if a physician determines that this is appropriate. However, the physician 
should ensure appropriate follow-up of patients. Patients or caregivers should be instructed to inject 
the full amount of Cosentyx according to the instructions provided in the package leaflet. 
Comprehensive instructions for administration are given in the package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Clinically important, active infection, e.g. active tuberculosis (see section 4.4).

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Infections 
Secukinumab has the potential to increase the risk of infections. Serious infections have been observed 
in patients receiving secukinumab in the post-marketing setting. Caution should be exercised when 
considering the use of secukinumab in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent 
infection. 
Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection 
occur. If a patient develops a serious infection, the patient should be closely monitored and 
secukinumab should not be administered until the infection resolves. 
In clinical studies, infections have been observed in patients receiving secukinumab (see section 4.8). 
Most of these were mild or moderate upper respiratory tract infections such as nasopharyngitis and did 
not require treatment discontinuation. 
Related to the mechanism of action of secukinumab, non-serious mucocutaneous candida infections 
were more frequently reported for secukinumab than placebo in the psoriasis clinical studies (3.55 per 
100 patient years for secukinumab 300 mg versus 1.00 per 100 patient years for placebo) (see 
section 4.8). 
No increased susceptibility to tuberculosis was reported from clinical studies. However, secukinumab 
should not be given to patients with active tuberculosis. Anti-tuberculosis therapy should be 
considered prior to initiation of secukinumab in patients with latent tuberculosis. 
Inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) 
Cases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with secukinumab 
(see section 4.8). Secukinumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a 
patient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of 
pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease, secukinumab should be discontinued and appropriate 
medical management should be initiated. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
In clinical studies, rare cases of anaphylactic reactions have been observed in patients receiving 
secukinumab. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reactions occur, administration of 
secukinumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. 
Latex-sensitive individuals 
The removable needle cap of Cosentyx 75 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe contains a 
derivative of natural rubber latex. No natural rubber latex has to date been detected in the removable 
needle cap. Nevertheless, the use of Cosentyx 75 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe in 
latex-sensitive individuals has not been studied and there is therefore a potential risk of 
hypersensitivity reactions which cannot be completely ruled out.

Vaccinations 
Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with secukinumab. 
Patients receiving secukinumab may receive concurrent inactivated or non-live vaccinations. In a 
study, after meningococcal and inactivated influenza vaccinations, a similar proportion of healthy 
volunteers treated with 150 mg of secukinumab and those treated with placebo were able to mount an 
adequate immune response of at least a 4-fold increase in antibody titres to meningococcal and 
influenza vaccines. The data suggest that secukinumab does not suppress the humoral immune 
response to the meningococcal or influenza vaccines. 
Prior to initiating therapy with Cosentyx, it is recommended that paediatric patients receive all 
age-appropriate immunisations as per current immunisation guidelines. 
Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy 
In psoriasis studies, the safety and efficacy of secukinumab in combination with immunosuppressants, 
including biologics, or phototherapy have not been evaluated. Secukinumab was administered 
concomitantly with methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine and/or corticosteroids in arthritis studies 
(including in patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis). Caution should be exercised 
when considering concomitant use of other immunosuppressants and secukinumab (see also 
section 4.5). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with secukinumab (see also section 4.4). 
In a study in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, no interaction was observed between secukinumab 
and midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate). 
No interaction was seen when secukinumab was administered concomitantly with methotrexate 
(MTX) and/or corticosteroids in arthritis studies (including in patients with psoriatic arthritis and axial 
spondyloarthritis). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment 
and for at least 20 weeks after treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of secukinumab in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Cosentyx during 
pregnancy.

Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether secukinumab is excreted in human milk. Immunoglobulins are excreted in 
human milk and it is not known if secukinumab is absorbed systemically after ingestion. Because of 
the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from secukinumab, a decision on whether to 
discontinue breast-feeding during treatment and up to 20 weeks after treatment or to discontinue 
therapy with Cosentyx must be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and 
the benefit of therapy to the woman. 
Fertility 
The effect of secukinumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Cosentyx has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions are upper respiratory tract infections (17.1%) (most 
frequently nasopharyngitis, rhinitis). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions from clinical studies and post-marketing reports (Table 3) are listed by MedDRA 
system organ class. Within each system organ class, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, 
with the most frequent reactions first. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented 
in order of decreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse 
reaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 000); and not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data). 
Over 20 000 patients have been treated with secukinumab in blinded and open-label clinical studies in 
various indications (plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, hidradenitis 
suppurativa [HS] and other autoimmune conditions), representing 34 908 patient years of exposure. Of 
these, over 14 000 patients were exposed to secukinumab for at least one year. The safety profile of 
secukinumab is consistent across all indications.

1) Placebo-controlled clinical studies (phase III) in plaque psoriasis, PsA, AS, nr-axSpA and HS 
patients exposed to 300 mg, 150 mg, 75 mg or placebo up to 12 weeks (psoriasis) or 16 weeks 
(PsA, AS, nr-axSpA and HS) treatment duration 
2) Cases were reported in patients with psoriasis diagnosis 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infections 
In the placebo-controlled period of clinical studies in plaque psoriasis (a total of 1 382 patients treated 
with secukinumab and 694 patients treated with placebo for up to 12 weeks), infections were reported 
in 28.7% of patients treated with secukinumab compared with 18.9% of patients treated with placebo. 
The majority of infections consisted of non-serious and mild to moderate upper respiratory tract 
infections, such as nasopharyngitis, which did not necessitate treatment discontinuation. There was an 
increase in mucosal or cutaneous candidiasis, consistent with the mechanism of action, but the cases 
were mild or moderate in severity, non-serious, responsive to standard treatment and did not 
necessitate treatment discontinuation. Serious infections occurred in 0.14% of patients treated with 
secukinumab and in 0.3% of patients treated with placebo (see section 4.4). 
Over the entire treatment period (a total of 3 430 patients treated with secukinumab for up to 52 weeks 
for the majority of patients), infections were reported in 47.5% of patients treated with secukinumab 
(0.9 per patient-year of follow-up). Serious infections were reported in 1.2% of patients treated with 
secukinumab (0.015 per patient-year of follow-up). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
Infection rates observed in psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and 
non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) clinical studies were similar to those observed in the 
psoriasis studies. 
Patients with hidradenitis suppurativa are more susceptible to infections. In the placebo-controlled 
period of clinical studies in hidradenitis suppurativa (a total of 721 patients treated with secukinumab 
and 363 patients treated with placebo for up to 16 weeks), infections were numerically higher 
compared to those observed in the psoriasis studies (30.7% of patients treated with secukinumab 
compared with 31.7% in patients treated with placebo). Most of these were non-serious, mild or 
moderate in severity and did not require treatment discontinuation or interruption. 
Neutropenia 
In psoriasis phase III clinical studies, neutropenia was more frequently observed with secukinumab 
than with placebo, but most cases were mild, transient and reversible. Neutropenia <1.0-0.5x109/l 
(CTCAE grade 3) was reported in 18 out of 3 430 (0.5%) patients on secukinumab, with no dose 
dependence and no temporal relationship to infections in 15 out of 18 cases. There were no reported 
cases of more severe neutropenia. Non-serious infections with usual response to standard care and not 
requiring discontinuation of secukinumab were reported in the remaining 3 cases. 
The frequency of neutropenia in psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and 
non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) and hidradenitis suppurativa was similar to psoriasis. 
Rare cases of neutropenia <0.5x109/l (CTCAE grade 4) were reported. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
In clinical studies, urticaria and rare cases of anaphylactic reaction to secukinumab were observed (see 
also section 4.4). 
Immunogenicity 
In psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic 
axial spondyloarthritis) and hidradenitis suppurativa clinical studies, less than 1% of patients treated 
with secukinumab developed antibodies to secukinumab up to 52 weeks of treatment. About half of 
the treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies were neutralising, but this was not associated with loss of 
efficacy or pharmacokinetic abnormalities. 
Paediatric population 
Undesirable effects in paediatric patients from the age of 6 years with plaque psoriasis 
The safety of secukinumab was assessed in two phase III studies in paediatric patients with plaque 
psoriasis. The first study (paediatric study 1) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 
162 patients from 6 to less than 18 years of age with severe plaque psoriasis. The second study 
(paediatric study 2) is an open-label study of 84 patients from 6 to less than 18 years of age with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The safety profile reported in these two studies was consistent 
with the safety profile reported in adult plaque psoriasis patients. 
Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with JIA 
The safety of secukinumab was also assessed in a phase III study in 86 juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
patients with ERA and JPsA from 2 to less than 18 years of age. The safety profile reported in this 
study was consistent with the safety profile reported in adult patients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
Doses up to 30 mg/kg (approximately 2000 to 3000 mg) have been administered intravenously in 
clinical studies without dose-limiting toxicity. In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the 
patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic 
treatment be instituted immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC10 
Mechanism of action 
Secukinumab is a fully human IgG1/κ monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and neutralises 
the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A). Secukinumab works by targeting IL-17A and 
inhibiting its interaction with the IL-17 receptor, which is expressed on various cell types including 
keratinocytes. As a result, secukinumab inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines 
and mediators of tissue damage and reduces IL-17A-mediated contributions to autoimmune and 
inflammatory diseases. Clinically relevant levels of secukinumab reach the skin and reduce local 
inflammatory markers. As a direct consequence treatment with secukinumab reduces erythema, 
induration and desquamation present in plaque psoriasis lesions. 
IL-17A is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune 
responses. IL-17A plays a key role in the pathogenesis of plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and axial 
spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) and is 
up-regulated in lesional skin in contrast to non-lesional skin of plaque psoriasis patients and in 
synovial tissue of psoriatic arthritis patients. The frequency of IL-17-producing cells was also 
significantly higher in the subchondral bone marrow of facet joints from patients with ankylosing 
spondylitis. Increased numbers of IL-17A producing lymphocytes have also been found in patients 
with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. Inhibition of IL-17A was shown to be effective in the 
treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, thus establishing the key role of this cytokine in axial 
spondyloarthritis. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Serum levels of total IL-17A (free and secukinumab-bound IL-17A) are initially increased in patients 
receiving secukinumab. This is followed by a slow decrease due to reduced clearance of 
secukinumab-bound IL-17A, indicating that secukinumab selectively captures free IL-17A, which 
plays a key role in the pathogenesis of plaque psoriasis. 
In a study with secukinumab, infiltrating epidermal neutrophils and various neutrophil-associated 
markers that are increased in lesional skin of plaque psoriasis patients were significantly reduced after 
one to two weeks of treatment. 
Secukinumab has been shown to lower (within 1 to 2 weeks of treatment) levels of C-reactive protein, 
which is a marker of inflammation.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Adult plaque psoriasis 
The safety and efficacy of secukinumab were assessed in four randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled phase III studies in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were 
candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy [ERASURE, FIXTURE, FEATURE, JUNCTURE]. 
The efficacy and safety of secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg were evaluated versus either placebo or 
etanercept. In addition, one study assessed a chronic treatment regimen versus a “retreatment as 
needed” regimen [SCULPTURE]. 
Of the 2 403 patients who were included in the placebo-controlled studies, 79% were biologic-naive, 
45% were non-biologic failures and 8% were biologic failures (6% were anti-TNF failures, and 2% 
were anti-p40 failures). Approximately 15 to 25% of patients in phase III studies had psoriatic arthritis 
(PsA) at baseline. 
Psoriasis study 1 (ERASURE) evaluated 738 patients. Patients randomised to secukinumab received 
150 mg or 300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month. Psoriasis 
study 2 (FIXTURE) evaluated 1 306 patients. Patients randomised to secukinumab received 150 mg or 
300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month. Patients randomised 
to etanercept received 50 mg doses twice per week for 12 weeks followed by 50 mg every week. In 
both study 1 and study 2, patients randomised to receive placebo who were non-responders at week 12 
then crossed over to receive secukinumab (either 150 mg or 300 mg) at weeks 12, 13, 14, and 15, 
followed by the same dose every month starting at week 16. All patients were followed for up to 
52 weeks following first administration of study treatment. 
Psoriasis study 3 (FEATURE) evaluated 177 patients using a pre-filled syringe compared with placebo 
after 12 weeks of treatment to assess the safety, tolerability, and usability of secukinumab 
self-administration via the pre-filled syringe. Psoriasis study 4 (JUNCTURE) evaluated 182 patients 
using a pre-filled pen compared with placebo after 12 weeks of treatment to assess the safety, 
tolerability, and usability of secukinumab self-administration via the pre-filled pen. In both study 3 
and study 4, patients randomised to secukinumab received 150 mg or 300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 
and 4, followed by the same dose every month. Patients were also randomised to receive placebo at 
weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month. 
Psoriasis study 5 (SCULPTURE) evaluated 966 patients. All patients received secukinumab 150 mg or 
300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 12 and then were randomised to receive either a 
maintenance regimen of the same dose every month starting at week 12 or a “retreatment as needed” 
regimen of the same dose. Patients randomised to “retreatment as needed” did not achieve adequate 
maintenance of response and therefore a fixed monthly maintenance regimen is recommended. 
The co-primary endpoints in the placebo and active-controlled studies were the proportion of patients 
who achieved a PASI 75 response and IGA mod 2011 “clear” or “almost clear” response versus 
placebo at week 12 (see Tables 4 and 5). The 300 mg dose provided improved skin clearance 
particularly for “clear” or “almost clear” skin across the efficacy endpoints of PASI 90, PASI 100, and 
IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response across all studies with peak effects seen at week 16, therefore this dose 
is recommended.

n (%) 
* The IGA mod 2011 is a 5-category scale including “0 = clear”, “1 = almost clear”, “2 = mild”, “3 = 
moderate” or “4 = severe”, indicating the physician’s overall assessment of the psoriasis severity focusing 
on induration, erythema and scaling. Treatment success of “clear” or “almost clear” consisted of no signs of 
psoriasis or normal to pink colouration of lesions, no thickening of the plaque and none to minimal focal 
scaling.

In an additional psoriasis study (CLEAR) 676 patients were evaluated. Secukinumab 300 mg met the 
primary and secondary endpoints by showing superiority to ustekinumab based on PASI 90 response 
at week 16 (primary endpoint), speed of onset of PASI 75 response at week 4, and long-term PASI 90 
response at week 52. Greater efficacy of secukinumab compared to ustekinumab for the endpoints 
PASI 75/90/100 and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response (“clear” or “almost clear”) was observed early 
and continued through to week 52 (Table 6).

Secukinumab was efficacious in systemic treatment-naive, biologic-naive, biologic/anti-TNF-exposed 
and biologic/anti-TNF-failure patients. Improvements in PASI 75 in patients with concurrent psoriatic 
arthritis at baseline were similar to those in the overall plaque psoriasis population. 
Secukinumab was associated with a fast onset of efficacy with a 50% reduction in mean PASI by 
week 3 for the 300 mg dose.

Specific locations/forms of plaque psoriasis 
In two additional placebo-controlled studies, improvement was seen in both nail psoriasis 
(TRANSFIGURE, 198 patients) and palmoplantar plaque psoriasis (GESTURE, 205 patients). In the 
TRANSFIGURE study, secukinumab was superior to placebo at week 16 (46.1% for 300 mg, 38.4% 
for 150 mg and 11.7% for placebo) as assessed by significant improvement from baseline in the Nail 
Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI %) for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis with nail 
involvement. In the GESTURE study, secukinumab was superior to placebo at week 16 (33.3% for 
300 mg, 22.1% for 150 mg, and 1.5% for placebo) as assessed by significant improvement of ppIGA 0 
or 1 response (“clear” or “almost clear”) for patients with moderate to severe palmoplantar plaque 
psoriasis. 
A placebo-controlled study evaluated 102 patients with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis, defined as 
having a Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) score of ≥12, an IGA mod 2011 scalp only score of 3 
or greater and at least 30% of the scalp surface area affected. Secukinumab 300 mg was superior to 
placebo at week 12 as assessed by significant improvement from baseline in both the PSSI 90 response 
(52.9% versus 2.0%) and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 scalp only response (56.9% versus 5.9%). 
Improvement in both endpoints was sustained for secukinumab patients who continued treatment 
through to week 24. 
Quality of life/patient-reported outcomes 
Statistically significant improvements at week 12 (studies 1-4) from baseline compared to placebo 
were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). Mean decreases (improvements) in 
DLQI from baseline ranged from -10.4 to -11.6 with secukinumab 300 mg, from -7.7 to -10.1 with 
secukinumab 150 mg, versus -1.1 to -1.9 for placebo at week 12. These improvements were 
maintained for 52 weeks (studies 1 and 2). 
Forty percent of the participants in studies 1 and 2 completed the Psoriasis Symptom Diary©. For the 
participants completing the diary in each of these studies, statistically significant improvements at 
week 12 from baseline compared to placebo in patient-reported signs and symptoms of itching, pain 
and scaling were demonstrated. 
Statistically significant improvements at week 4 from baseline in patients treated with secukinumab 
compared to patients treated with ustekinumab (CLEAR) were demonstrated in the DLQI and these 
improvements were maintained for up to 52 weeks.

Statistically significant improvements in patient-reported signs and symptoms of itching, pain and 
scaling at week 16 and week 52 (CLEAR) were demonstrated in the Psoriasis Symptom Diary© in 
patients treated with secukinumab compared to patients treated with ustekinumab. 
Statistically significant improvements (decreases) at week 12 from baseline in the scalp psoriasis study 
were demonstrated in patient reported signs and symptoms of scalp itching, pain and scaling compared 
to placebo. 
Paediatric population 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Secukinumab has been shown to improve signs and symptoms, and health-related quality of life in 
paediatric patients 6 years and older with plaque psoriasis (see Tables 8 and 10). 
Severe plaque psoriasis 
The safety and efficacy of secukinumab were assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo and 
etanercept-controlled phase III study in paediatric patients from 6 to <18 years of age with severe 
plaque psoriasis, as defined by a PASI score ≥20, an IGA mod 2011 score of 4, and BSA involvement 
of ≥10%, who were candidates for systemic therapy. Approximately 43% of the patients had prior 
exposure to phototherapy, 53% to conventional systemic therapy, 3% to biologics, and 9% had 
concomitant psoriatic arthritis. 
The paediatric psoriasis study 1 evaluated 162 patients who were randomised to receive low dose 
secukinumab (75 mg for body weight <50 kg or 150 mg for body weight ≥50 kg), high dose 
secukinumab (75 mg for body weight <25 kg, 150 mg for body weight between ≥25 kg and <50 kg, or 
300 mg for body weight ≥50 kg), or placebo at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by the same dose 
every 4 weeks, or etanercept. Patients randomised to etanercept received 0.8 mg/kg weekly (up to a 
maximum of 50 mg). Patient distribution by weight and age at randomisation is described in Table 7.

Patients randomised to receive placebo who were non-responders at week 12 were switched to either 
the secukinumab low or high dose group (dose based on body weight group) and received study drug 
at weeks 12, 13, 14, and 15, followed by the same dose every 4 weeks starting at week 16. The co-
primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 response and IGA mod 
2011 ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (0 or 1) response at week 12. 
During the 12 week placebo-controlled period, the efficacy of both the low and the high dose of 
secukinumab was comparable for the co-primary endpoints. The odds ratio estimates in favour of both 
secukinumab doses were statistically significant for both the PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 
responses.

All patients were followed for efficacy and safety during the 52 weeks following the first dose. The 
proportion of patients achieving PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (0 or 1) 
responses showed separation between secukinumab treatment groups and placebo at the first post-
baseline visit at week 4, the difference becoming more prominent at week 12. The response was 
maintained throughout the 52 week time period (see Table 8). Improvement in PASI 50, 90, 100 
responder rates and Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) scores of 0 or 1 were also 
maintained throughout the 52 week time period. 
In addition, PASI 75, IGA 0 or 1, PASI 90 response rates at weeks 12 and 52 for both secukinumab 
low and high dose groups were higher than the rates for patients treated with etanercept (see Table 8). 
Beyond week 12, efficacy of both the low and the high dose of secukinumab was comparable although 
the efficacy of the high dose was higher for patients ≥50 kg. The safety profiles of the low dose and 
the high dose were comparable and consistent with the safety profile in adults.

A higher proportion of paediatric patients treated with secukinumab reported improvement in health-
related quality of life as measured by a CDLQI score of 0 or 1 compared to placebo at week 12 (low 
dose 44.7%, high dose 50%, placebo 15%). Over time up to and including week 52 both secukinumab 
dose groups were numerically higher than the etanercept group (low dose 60.6%, high dose 66.7%, 
etanercept 44.4%). 
Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis 
Secukinumab was predicted to be effective for the treatment of paediatric patients with moderate 
plaque psoriasis based on the demonstrated efficacy and exposure response relationship in adult 
patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, and the similarity of the disease course, 
pathophysiology, and drug effect in adult and paediatric patients at the same exposure levels.

Moreover, the safety and efficacy of secukinumab was assessed in an open-label, two-arm, 
parallel-group, multicentre phase III study in paediatric patients from 6 to <18 years of age with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, as defined by a PASI score ≥12, an IGA mod 2011 score of ≥3, 
and BSA involvement of ≥10%, who were candidates for systemic therapy. 
The paediatric psoriasis study 2 evaluated 84 patients who were randomised to receive low dose 
secukinumab (75 mg for body weight <50 kg or 150 mg for body weight ≥50 kg) or high dose 
secukinumab (75 mg for body weight <25 kg, 150 mg for body weight between ≥25 kg and <50 kg, or 
300 mg for body weight ≥50 kg) at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by the same dose every 4 weeks.

The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 response and IGA 
mod 2011 ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (0 or 1) response at week 12. 
The efficacy of both the low and the high dose of secukinumab was comparable and showed 
statistically significant improvement compared to historical placebo for the co-primary endpoints. The 
estimated posterior probability of a positive treatment effect was 100%. 
Patients were followed for efficacy over a 52 week period after first administration. Efficacy (defined 
as PASI 75 response and IGA mod 2011 ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ [0 or 1]) was observed as early as the 
first post-baseline visit at week 2, and the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 response and 
IGA mod 2011 ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (0 or 1) increased up to week 24 and were sustained until 
week 52. Improvement in PASI 90 and PASI 100 were also observed at week 12, increased up to 
week 24, and were sustained until week 52 (see Table 10). 
The safety profiles of the low dose and the high dose were comparable and consistent with the safety 
profile in adults.

In the low dose group, 50% and 70.7% of patients achieved a CDLQI 0 or 1 score at weeks 12 and 52, 
respectively. In the high dose group, 61.9% and 70.3% achieved a CDLQI 0 or 1 score at weeks 12 
and 52, respectively. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) 
Enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) and juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) 
The efficacy and safety of secukinumab were assessed in 86 patients in a 3-part, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, event-driven, randomised, phase III study in patients 2 to <18 years of age with 
active ERA or JPsA as diagnosed based on a modified International League of Associations for 
Rheumatology (ILAR) JIA classification criteria. The study consisted of an open-label portion (Part 1) 
where all patients received secukinumab until week 12. Patients demonstrating a JIA ACR 30 
response at week 12 entered into the Part 2 double-blind phase and were randomised 1:1 to continue 
treatment with secukinumab or to begin treatment with placebo (randomised withdrawal) until 
week 104 or until a flare occured. Patients who flared then entered open-label secukinumab treatment 
until week 104 (Part 3). 
The JIA patient subtypes at study entry were: 60.5% ERA and 39.5% JPsA, who either had inadequate 
response or were intolerant to ≥1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and ≥1 non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). At baseline, MTX use was reported for 65.1% of 
patients; (63.5% [33/52] of ERA patients and 67.6% [23/34] of JPsA patients). There were 12 out of 
52 ERA patients concomitantly treated with sulfasalazine (23.1%). Patients with a body weight at 
baseline <50 kg (n=30) were given a dose of 75 mg and patients with a body weight ≥50 kg (n=56) 
were given a dose of 150 mg. Age at baseline ranged from 2 to 17 years, with 3 patients between 2 to 
<6 years, 22 patients 6 to <12 years and 61 patients 12 to <18 years. At baseline the Juvenile Arthritis 
Disease Activity Score (JADAS)-27 was 15.1 (SD:7.1). 
The primary endpoint was time to flare in the randomised withdrawal period (Part 2). Disease flare 
was defined as a ≥30% worsening in at least three of the six JIA ACR response criteria and ≥30% 
improvement in not more than one of the six JIA ACR response criteria and a minimum of two active 
joints. 
At the end of Part 1, 75 out of 86 (87.2%) patients demonstrated a JIA ACR 30 response and entered 
into Part 2. 
The study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant prolongation in the time 
to disease flare in patients treated with secukinumab compared to placebo in Part 2. The risk of flare 
was reduced by 72% for patients on secukinumab compared with patients on placebo in Part 2 (Hazard 
ratio=0.28, 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.63, p<0.001) (Figure 2 and Table 11). During Part 2, a total of 
21 patients in the placebo group experienced a flare event (11 JPsA and 10 ERA) compared with 
10 patients in the secukinumab group (4 JPsA and 6 ERA).

The data in the 2 to <6 age group were inconclusive due to the low number of patients below 6 years 
of age enrolled in the study. 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Cosentyx in plaque psoriasis in paediatric patients aged from birth to less than 6 years and in chronic 
idiopathic arthritis for paediatric patients aged from birth to less than 2 years (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Most pharmacokinetics properties observed in patients with plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and 
ankylosing spondylitis were similar. 
Paediatric population 
Plaque psoriasis 
In a pool of the two paediatric studies, patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (6 to less than 
18 years of age) were administered secukinumab at the recommended paediatric dosing regimen. At 
week 24, patients weighing ≥25 and <50 kg had a mean ± SD steady-state trough concentration of 
19.8±6.96 µg/ml (n=24) after 75 mg of secukinumab and patients weighing ≥50 kg had mean ±SD 
trough concentration of 27.3±10.1 µg/ml (n=36) after 150 mg of secukinumab. The mean ± SD 
steady-state trough concentration in patients weighing <25 kg (n=8) was 32.6±10.8 µg/ml at week 24 
after 75 mg dose. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
In a paediatric study, ERA and JPsA patients (2 to less than 18 years of age) were administered 
secukinumab at the recommended paediatric dosing regimen. At week 24, patients weighing <50 kg, 
and weighing ≥50 kg had a mean ± SD steady-state trough concentration of 25.2±5.45 µg/ml (n=10) 
and 27.9±9.57 µg/ml (n=19), respectively.

Adult population 
Absorption 
Following a single subcutaneous dose of 300 mg as a liquid formulation in healthy volunteers, 
secukinumab reached peak serum concentrations of 43.2±10.4 μg/ml between 2 and 14 days post dose. 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following a single subcutaneous dose of either 150 mg 
or 300 mg in plaque psoriasis patients, secukinumab reached peak serum concentrations of 
13.7±4.8 µg/ml or 27.3±9.5 µg/ml, respectively, between 5 and 6 days post dose. 
After initial weekly dosing during the first month, time to reach the maximum concentration was 
between 31 and 34 days based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
On the basis of simulated data, peak concentrations at steady-state (Cmax,ss) following subcutaneous 
administration of 150 mg or 300 mg were 27.6 µg/ml and 55.2 µg/ml, respectively. Population 
pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that steady-state is reached after 20 weeks with monthly dosing 
regimens. 
Compared with exposure after a single dose, the population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that 
patients exhibited a 2-fold increase in peak serum concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) 
following repeated monthly dosing during maintenance. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that secukinumab was absorbed with an average absolute 
bioavailability of 73% in patients with plaque psoriasis. Across studies, absolute bioavailabilities in 
the range between 60 and 77% were calculated. 
The bioavailability of secukinumab in PsA patients was 85% on the basis of the population 
pharmacokinetic model. 
Following a single subcutaneous injection of 300 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe in 
plaque psoriasis patients, secukinumab systemic exposure was similar to what was observed 
previously with two injections of 150 mg. 
Distribution 
The mean volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz) following single intravenous 
administration ranged from 7.10 to 8.60 litres in plaque psoriasis patients, suggesting that 
secukinumab undergoes limited distribution to peripheral compartments. 
Biotransformation 
The majority of IgG elimination occurs via intracellular catabolism, following fluid-phase or receptor 
mediated endocytosis. 
Elimination 
Mean systemic clearance (CL) following a single intravenous administration to patients with plaque 
psoriasis ranged from 0.13 to 0.36 l/day. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the mean systemic 
clearance (CL) was 0.19 l/day in plaque psoriasis patients. The CL was not impacted by gender. 
Clearance was dose- and time-independent. 
The mean elimination half-life, as estimated from population pharmacokinetic analysis, was 27 days in 
plaque psoriasis patients, ranging from 18 to 46 days across psoriasis studies with intravenous 
administration. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of secukinumab in plaque psoriasis patients were 
determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 1x 0.3 mg/kg to 3x 10 mg/kg and 
with subcutaneous doses ranging from 1x 25 mg to multiple doses of 300 mg. Exposure was dose 
proportional across all dosing regimens.

Special populations 
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. The renal 
elimination of intact secukinumab, an IgG monoclonal antibody, is expected to be low and of minor 
importance. IgGs are mainly eliminated via catabolism and hepatic impairment is not expected to 
influence clearance of secukinumab. 
Effect of weight on pharmacokinetics 
Secukinumab clearance and volume of distribution increase as body weight increases. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans (adult or paediatric) based on conventional 
studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose and reproductive toxicity, or tissue cross-reactivity. 
Animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of secukinumab.

The 150 mg and 300 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe and in pre-filled pen are not 
indicated for administration to paediatric patients with a weight <50 kg. Cosentyx may be available in 
other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. 
For all of the above indications, available data suggest that a clinical response is usually achieved 
within 16 weeks of treatment. Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients 
who have shown no response by 16 weeks of treatment. Some patients with an initial partial response 
may subsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 16 weeks. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients (aged 65 years and over) 
No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment / hepatic impairment 
Cosentyx has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Cosentyx in children with plaque psoriasis and in the juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis (JIA) categories of ERA and JPsA below the age of 6 years have not been established. 
The safety and efficacy of Cosentyx in children below the age of 18 years in other indications have not 
yet been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Cosentyx is to be administered by subcutaneous injection. If possible, areas of the skin that show 
psoriasis should be avoided as injection sites. The syringe or the pen must not be shaken. 
After proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, patients may self-inject Cosentyx or be 
injected by a caregiver if a physician determines that this is appropriate. However, the physician 
should ensure appropriate follow-up of patients. Patients or caregivers should be instructed to inject 
the full amount of Cosentyx according to the instructions provided in the package leaflet. 
Comprehensive instructions for administration are given in the package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Clinically important, active infection, e.g. active tuberculosis (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Infections 
Secukinumab has the potential to increase the risk of infections. Serious infections have been observed 
in patients receiving secukinumab in the post-marketing setting. Caution should be exercised when 
considering the use of secukinumab in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent 
infection. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection 
occur. If a patient develops a serious infection, the patient should be closely monitored and 
secukinumab should not be administered until the infection resolves. 
In clinical studies, infections have been observed in patients receiving secukinumab (see section 4.8). 
Most of these were mild or moderate upper respiratory tract infections such as nasopharyngitis and did 
not require treatment discontinuation. 
Related to the mechanism of action of secukinumab, non-serious mucocutaneous candida infections 
were more frequently reported for secukinumab than placebo in the psoriasis clinical studies (3.55 per 
100 patient years for secukinumab 300 mg versus 1.00 per 100 patient years for placebo) (see 
section 4.8). 
No increased susceptibility to tuberculosis was reported from clinical studies. However, secukinumab 
should not be given to patients with active tuberculosis. Anti-tuberculosis therapy should be 
considered prior to initiation of secukinumab in patients with latent tuberculosis. 
Inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) 
Cases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with secukinumab 
(see section 4.8). Secukinumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a 
patient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of 
pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease, secukinumab should be discontinued and appropriate 
medical management should be initiated. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
In clinical studies, rare cases of anaphylactic reactions have been observed in patients receiving 
secukinumab. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reactions occur, administration of 
secukinumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. 
Latex-sensitive individuals – Cosentyx 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe and 150 mg 
solution for injection in pre-filled pen only 
The removable needle cap of Cosentyx 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe and 
Cosentyx 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen contains a derivative of natural rubber latex. 
No natural rubber latex has to date been detected in the removable needle cap. Nevertheless, the use of 
Cosentyx 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe and Cosentyx 150 mg solution for 
injection in pre-filled pen in latex-sensitive individuals has not been studied and there is therefore a 
potential risk of hypersensitivity reactions which cannot be completely ruled out. 
Vaccinations 
Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with secukinumab. 
Patients receiving secukinumab may receive concurrent inactivated or non-live vaccinations. In a 
study, after meningococcal and inactivated influenza vaccinations, a similar proportion of healthy 
volunteers treated with 150 mg of secukinumab and those treated with placebo were able to mount an 
adequate immune response of at least a 4-fold increase in antibody titres to meningococcal and 
influenza vaccines. The data suggest that secukinumab does not suppress the humoral immune 
response to the meningococcal or influenza vaccines. 
Prior to initiating therapy with Cosentyx, it is recommended that paediatric patients receive all 
age-appropriate immunisations as per current immunisation guidelines.

Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy 
In psoriasis studies, the safety and efficacy of secukinumab in combination with immunosuppressants, 
including biologics, or phototherapy have not been evaluated. Secukinumab was administered 
concomitantly with methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine and/or corticosteroids in arthritis studies 
(including in patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis). Caution should be exercised 
when considering concomitant use of other immunosuppressants and secukinumab (see also 
section 4.5). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with secukinumab (see also section 4.4). 
In a study in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, no interaction was observed between secukinumab 
and midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate). 
No interaction was seen when secukinumab was administered concomitantly with methotrexate 
(MTX) and/or corticosteroids in arthritis studies (including in patients with psoriatic arthritis and axial 
spondyloarthritis). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment 
and for at least 20 weeks after treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of secukinumab in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Cosentyx during 
pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether secukinumab is excreted in human milk. Immunoglobulins are excreted in 
human milk and it is not known if secukinumab is absorbed systemically after ingestion. Because of 
the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from secukinumab, a decision on whether to 
discontinue breast-feeding during treatment and up to 20 weeks after treatment or to discontinue 
therapy with Cosentyx must be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and 
the benefit of therapy to the woman. 
Fertility 
The effect of secukinumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Cosentyx has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions are upper respiratory tract infections (17.1%) (most 
frequently nasopharyngitis, rhinitis). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions from clinical studies and post-marketing reports (Table 3) are listed by MedDRA 
system organ class. Within each system organ class, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, 
with the most frequent reactions first. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented 
in order of decreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse 
reaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 000); and not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data). 
Over 20 000 patients have been treated with secukinumab in blinded and open-label clinical studies in 
various indications (plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, hidradenitis 
suppurativa and other autoimmune conditions), representing 34 908 patient years of exposure. Of 
these, over 14 000 patients were exposed to secukinumab for at least one year. The safety profile of 
secukinumab is consistent across all indications.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infections 
In the placebo-controlled period of clinical studies in plaque psoriasis (a total of 1 382 patients treated 
with secukinumab and 694 patients treated with placebo for up to 12 weeks), infections were reported 
in 28.7% of patients treated with secukinumab compared with 18.9% of patients treated with placebo. 
The majority of infections consisted of non-serious and mild to moderate upper respiratory tract 
infections, such as nasopharyngitis, which did not necessitate treatment discontinuation. There was an 
increase in mucosal or cutaneous candidiasis, consistent with the mechanism of action, but the cases 
were mild or moderate in severity, non-serious, responsive to standard treatment and did not 
necessitate treatment discontinuation. Serious infections occurred in 0.14% of patients treated with 
secukinumab and in 0.3% of patients treated with placebo (see section 4.4). 
Over the entire treatment period (a total of 3 430 patients treated with secukinumab for up to 52 weeks 
for the majority of patients), infections were reported in 47.5% of patients treated with secukinumab 
(0.9 per patient-year of follow-up). Serious infections were reported in 1.2% of patients treated with 
secukinumab (0.015 per patient-year of follow-up). 
Infection rates observed in psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and 
non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) clinical studies were similar to those observed in the 
psoriasis studies. 
Patients with hidradenitis suppurativa are more susceptible to infections. In the placebo-controlled 
period of clinical studies in hidradenitis suppurativa (a total of 721 patients treated with secukinumab 
and 363 patients treated with placebo for up to 16 weeks), infections were numerically higher 
compared to those observed in the psoriasis studies (30.7% of patients treated with secukinumab 
compared with 31.7% in patients treated with placebo). Most of these were non-serious, mild or 
moderate in severity and did not require treatment discontinuation or interruption. 
Neutropenia 
In psoriasis phase III clinical studies, neutropenia was more frequently observed with secukinumab 
than with placebo, but most cases were mild, transient and reversible. Neutropenia <1.0-0.5x109/l 
(CTCAE grade 3) was reported in 18 out of 3 430 (0.5%) patients on secukinumab, with no dose 
dependence and no temporal relationship to infections in 15 out of 18 cases. There were no reported 
cases of more severe neutropenia. Non-serious infections with usual response to standard care and not 
requiring discontinuation of secukinumab were reported in the remaining 3 cases. 
The frequency of neutropenia in psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and 
non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) and hidradenitis suppurativa was similar to psoriasis. 
Rare cases of neutropenia <0.5x109/l (CTCAE grade 4) were reported. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
In clinical studies, urticaria and rare cases of anaphylactic reaction to secukinumab were observed (see 
also section 4.4). 
Immunogenicity 
In psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic 
axial spondyloarthritis) and hidradenitis suppurativa clinical studies, less than 1% of patients treated 
with secukinumab developed antibodies to secukinumab up to 52 weeks of treatment. About half of 
the treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies were neutralising, but this was not associated with loss of 
efficacy or pharmacokinetic abnormalities.

Paediatric population 
Undesirable effects in paediatric patients from the age of 6 years with plaque psoriasis 
The safety of secukinumab was assessed in two phase III studies in paediatric patients with plaque 
psoriasis. The first study (paediatric study 1) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 
162 patients from 6 to less than 18 years of age with severe plaque psoriasis. The second study 
(paediatric study 2) is an open-label study of 84 patients from 6 to less than 18 years of age with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The safety profile reported in these two studies was consistent 
with the safety profile reported in adult plaque psoriasis patients. 
Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with JIA 
The safety of secukinumab was also assessed in a phase III study in 86 juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
patients with ERA and JPsA from 2 to less than 18 years of age. The safety profile reported in this 
study was consistent with the safety profile reported in adult patients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Doses up to 30 mg/kg (approximately 2000 to 3000 mg) have been administered intravenously in 
clinical studies without dose-limiting toxicity. In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the 
patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic 
treatment be instituted immediately. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC10 
Mechanism of action 
Secukinumab is a fully human IgG1/κ monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and neutralises 
the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A). Secukinumab works by targeting IL-17A and 
inhibiting its interaction with the IL-17 receptor, which is expressed on various cell types including 
keratinocytes. As a result, secukinumab inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines 
and mediators of tissue damage and reduces IL-17A-mediated contributions to autoimmune and 
inflammatory diseases. Clinically relevant levels of secukinumab reach the skin and reduce local 
inflammatory markers. As a direct consequence treatment with secukinumab reduces erythema, 
induration and desquamation present in plaque psoriasis lesions. 
IL-17A is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune 
responses. IL-17A plays a key role in the pathogenesis of plaque psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, 
psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis) and is up-regulated in lesional skin in contrast to non-lesional skin of plaque 
psoriasis patients and in synovial tissue of psoriatic arthritis patients. IL-17A is also upregulated in 
hidradenitis suppurativa lesions and increased IL-17A serum levels have been observed in affected 
patients. The frequency of IL-17-producing cells was also significantly higher in the subchondral bone 
marrow of facet joints from patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Increased numbers of IL-17A 
producing lymphocytes have also been found in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inhibition of IL-17A was shown to be effective in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, thus 
establishing the key role of this cytokine in axial spondyloarthritis. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Serum levels of total IL-17A (free and secukinumab-bound IL-17A) are initially increased in patients 
receiving secukinumab. This is followed by a slow decrease due to reduced clearance of secukinumab- 
bound IL-17A, indicating that secukinumab selectively captures free IL-17A, which plays a key role in 
the pathogenesis of plaque psoriasis. 
In a study with secukinumab, infiltrating epidermal neutrophils and various neutrophil-associated 
markers that are increased in lesional skin of plaque psoriasis patients were significantly reduced after 
one to two weeks of treatment. 
Secukinumab has been shown to lower (within 1 to 2 weeks of treatment) levels of C-reactive protein, 
which is a marker of inflammation. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Adult plaque psoriasis 
The safety and efficacy of secukinumab were assessed in four randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled phase III studies in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were 
candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy [ERASURE, FIXTURE, FEATURE, JUNCTURE]. 
The efficacy and safety of secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg were evaluated versus either placebo or 
etanercept. In addition, one study assessed a chronic treatment regimen versus a “retreatment as 
needed” regimen [SCULPTURE]. 
Of the 2 403 patients who were included in the placebo-controlled studies, 79% were biologic-naive, 
45% were non-biologic failures and 8% were biologic failures (6% were anti-TNF failures, and 2% 
were anti-p40 failures). Approximately 15 to 25% of patients in phase III studies had psoriatic arthritis 
(PsA) at baseline. 
Psoriasis study 1 (ERASURE) evaluated 738 patients. Patients randomised to secukinumab received 
150 mg or 300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month. Psoriasis 
study 2 (FIXTURE) evaluated 1 306 patients. Patients randomised to secukinumab received 150 mg or 
300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month. Patients randomised 
to etanercept received 50 mg doses twice per week for 12 weeks followed by 50 mg every week. In 
both study 1 and study 2, patients randomised to receive placebo who were non-responders at week 12 
then crossed over to receive secukinumab (either 150 mg or 300 mg) at weeks 12, 13, 14, and 15, 
followed by the same dose every month starting at week 16. All patients were followed for up to 
52 weeks following first administration of study treatment. 
Psoriasis study 3 (FEATURE) evaluated 177 patients using a pre-filled syringe compared with placebo 
after 12 weeks of treatment to assess the safety, tolerability, and usability of secukinumab 
self-administration via the pre-filled syringe. Psoriasis study 4 (JUNCTURE) evaluated 182 patients 
using a pre-filled pen compared with placebo after 12 weeks of treatment to assess the safety, 
tolerability, and usability of secukinumab self-administration via the pre-filled pen. In both study 3 
and study 4, patients randomised to secukinumab received 150 mg or 300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 
and 4, followed by the same dose every month. Patients were also randomised to receive placebo at 
weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month. 
Psoriasis study 5 (SCULPTURE) evaluated 966 patients. All patients received secukinumab 150 mg or 
300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 12 and then were randomised to receive either a 
maintenance regimen of the same dose every month starting at week 12 or a “retreatment as needed” 
regimen of the same dose. Patients randomised to “retreatment as needed” did not achieve adequate 
maintenance of response and therefore a fixed monthly maintenance regimen is recommended. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The co-primary endpoints in the placebo and active-controlled studies were the proportion of patients 
who achieved a PASI 75 response and IGA mod 2011 “clear” or “almost clear” response versus 
placebo at week 12 (see Tables 4 and 5). The 300 mg dose provided improved skin clearance 
particularly for “clear” or “almost clear” skin across the efficacy endpoints of PASI 90, PASI 100, and 
IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response across all studies with peak effects seen at week 16, therefore this dose 
is recommended.

In an additional psoriasis study (CLEAR) 676 patients were evaluated. Secukinumab 300 mg met the 
primary and secondary endpoints by showing superiority to ustekinumab based on PASI 90 response 
at week 16 (primary endpoint), speed of onset of PASI 75 response at week 4, and long-term PASI 90 
response at week 52. Greater efficacy of secukinumab compared to ustekinumab for the endpoints 
PASI 75/90/100 and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response (“clear” or “almost clear”) was observed early 
and continued through to week 52 (Table 6).

and biologic/anti-TNF-failure patients. Improvements in PASI 75 in patients with concurrent psoriatic 
arthritis at baseline were similar to those in the overall plaque psoriasis population. 
Secukinumab was associated with a fast onset of efficacy with a 50% reduction in mean PASI by 
week 3 for the 300 mg dose.

Specific locations/forms of plaque psoriasis 
In two additional placebo-controlled studies, improvement was seen in both nail psoriasis 
(TRANSFIGURE, 198 patients) and palmoplantar plaque psoriasis (GESTURE, 205 patients). In the 
TRANSFIGURE study, secukinumab was superior to placebo at week 16 (46.1% for 300 mg, 38.4% 
for 150 mg and 11.7% for placebo) as assessed by significant improvement from baseline in the Nail 
Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI %) for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis with nail 
involvement. In the GESTURE study, secukinumab was superior to placebo at week 16 (33.3% for 
300 mg, 22.1% for 150 mg, and 1.5% for placebo) as assessed by significant improvement of ppIGA 0 
or 1 response (“clear” or “almost clear”) for patients with moderate to severe palmoplantar plaque 
psoriasis. 
A placebo-controlled study evaluated 102 patients with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis, defined as 
having a Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) score of ≥12, an IGA mod 2011 scalp only score of 3 
or greater and at least 30% of the scalp surface area affected. Secukinumab 300 mg was superior to 
placebo at week 12 as assessed by significant improvement from baseline in both the PSSI 90 response 
(52.9% versus 2.0%) and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 scalp only response (56.9% versus 5.9%). 
Improvement in both endpoints was sustained for secukinumab patients who continued treatment 
through to week 24. 
Quality of life/patient-reported outcomes 
Statistically significant improvements at week 12 (studies 1-4) from baseline compared to placebo 
were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). Mean decreases (improvements) in 
DLQI from baseline ranged from -10.4 to -11.6 with secukinumab 300 mg, from -7.7 to -10.1 with 
secukinumab 150 mg, versus -1.1 to -1.9 for placebo at week 12. These improvements were 
maintained for 52 weeks (studies 1 and 2). 
Forty percent of the participants in studies 1 and 2 completed the Psoriasis Symptom Diary©. For the 
participants completing the diary in each of these studies, statistically significant improvements at 
week 12 from baseline compared to placebo in patient-reported signs and symptoms of itching, pain 
and scaling were demonstrated. 
Statistically significant improvements at week 4 from baseline in patients treated with secukinumab 
compared to patients treated with ustekinumab (CLEAR) were demonstrated in the DLQI and these 
improvements were maintained for up to 52 weeks.

Statistically significant improvements in patient-reported signs and symptoms of itching, pain and 
scaling at week 16 and week 52 (CLEAR) were demonstrated in the Psoriasis Symptom Diary© in 
patients treated with secukinumab compared to patients treated with ustekinumab. 
Statistically significant improvements (decreases) at week 12 from baseline in the scalp psoriasis study 
were demonstrated in patient reported signs and symptoms of scalp itching, pain and scaling compared 
to placebo. 
Plaque psoriasis dose flexibility 
A randomised, double-blind, multicentre study evaluated two maintenance dosing regimens (300 mg 
every 2 weeks [Q2W] and 300 mg every 4 weeks [Q4W]) administered by 150 mg pre-filled syringe 
in 331 patients weighing ≥90 kg with moderate to severe psoriasis. Patients were randomised 1:1 as 
follows: 
• 
secukinumab 300 mg at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by the same dose every 2 weeks 
(Q2W) up to week 52 (n=165). 
secukinumab 300 mg at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by the same dose every 4 weeks 
(Q4W) up to week 16 (n=166). 
o 
Patients randomised to receive secukinumab 300 mg Q4W who were PASI 90 responders 
at week 16 continued to receive the same dosing regimen up to week 52. Patients 
randomised to receive secukinumab 300 mg Q4W who were PASI 90 non-responders at 
week 16 either continued on the same dosing regimen, or were reassigned to receive 
secukinumab 300 mg Q2W up to week 52. 
• 
Overall, the efficacy response rates for the group treated with the every 2 weeks regimen were higher 
compared to the group treated with the every 4 weeks regimen (Table 7).

In the PASI 90 non-responders at week 16 who were up-titrated to secukinumab 300 mg Q2W, the 
PASI 90 response rates improved compared to those who remained on the secukinumab 300 mg Q4W 
dosing regimen, while the IGA mod 2011 0/1 response rates remained stable over time in both 
treatment groups. 
The safety profiles of the two dosing regimens, Cosentyx 300 mg administered every 4 weeks and 
Cosentyx 300 mg administered every 2 weeks, in patients weighing ≥90 kg were comparable and 
consistent with the safety profile reported in psoriasis patients.

Hidradenitis suppurativa 
The safety and efficacy of secukinumab were assessed in 1 084 patients in two randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III studies in adult patients with moderate to severe 
hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who were candidates for systemic biologic therapy. Patients were 
required to have at least five inflammatory lesions affecting at least two anatomical areas at baseline. 
In HS study 1 (SUNSHINE) and HS study 2 (SUNRISE), respectively, 4.6% and 2.8% of patients 
were Hurley stage I, 61.4% and 56.7% were Hurley stage II, and 34.0% and 40.5% were Hurley 
stage III.The proportion of patients weighing ≥90 kg was 54.7% in HS study 1 and 50.8% in HS 
study 2. Patients in these studies had a diagnosis of moderate to severe HS for a mean of 7.3 years and 
56.3% of the study participants were female. 
In HS study 1 and HS study 2, 23,8% and 23,2% of patients, respectively, were previously treated with 
a biologic. 82.3% and 83.6% of patients, respectively, were previously treated with systemic 
antibiotics. 
HS study 1 evaluated 541 patients and HS study 2 evaluated 543 patients, of whom 12.8% and 10.7%, 
respectively, received concomitant stable-dose antibiotics. In both studies, patients randomised to 
secukinumab received 300 mg subcutaneously at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by 300 mg every 
2 weeks (Q2W) or every 4 weeks (Q4W). At week 16, patients who were randomised to placebo were 
reassigned to receive secukinumab 300 mg at weeks 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 followed by either 
secukinumab 300 mg Q2W or secukinumab 300 mg Q4W. 
The primary endpoint in both studies (HS study 1 and HS study 2) was the proportion of patients 
achieving a Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response defined as at least a 50% decrease in 
abscesses and inflammatory nodules count with no increase in the number of abscesses and/or in the 
number of draining fistulae relative to baseline (HiSCR50) at week 16. Reduction in HS-related skin 
pain was assessed as a secondary endpoint on the pooled data of HS study 1 and HS study 2 using a 
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) in patients who entered the studies with an initial baseline score of 3 or 
greater. 
In HS study 1 and HS study 2, a higher proportion of patients treated with secukinumab 300 mg Q2W 
achieved a HiSCR50 response with a decrease in abscesses and inflammatory nodules (AN) count 
compared to placebo at week 16. In HS study 2, a difference in HiSCR50 response and AN count was 
also observed with the secukinumab 300 mg Q4W regimen. In the secukinumab 300 mg Q2W group 
in HS study 1 and in the secukinumab 300 mg Q4W group in HS study 2, a lower rate of patients 
experienced flares compared to placebo up to week 16. A higher proportion of patients treated with 
secukinumab 300 mg Q2W (pooled data) experienced a clinically relevant decrease in HS-related skin 
pain compared to placebo at week 16 (Table 8).

In both studies, the onset of action of secukinumab occurred as early as week 2, the efficacy 
progressively increased to week 16 and was maintained up to week 52. 
Improvements were seen for the primary and key secondary endpoints in HS patients regardless of 
previous or concomitant antibiotic treatment. 
HiSCR50 responses were improved at week 16 in both biologic-naïve and biologic-exposed patients. 
Greater improvements at week 16 from baseline compared to placebo were demonstrated in 
health-related quality of life as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
The safety and efficacy of secukinumab were assessed in 1 999 patients in three randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III studies in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (≥3 swollen 
and ≥3 tender joints) despite non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), corticosteroid or 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy. Patients with each subtype of PsA were 
enrolled in these studies, including polyarticular arthritis with no evidence of rheumatoid nodules, 
spondylitis with peripheral arthritis, asymmetric peripheral arthritis, distal interphalangeal 
involvement and arthritis mutilans. Patients in these studies had a diagnosis of PsA of at least five 
years. The majority of patients also had active psoriasis skin lesions or a documented history of 
psoriasis. Over 61% and 42% of the PsA patients had enthesitis and dactylitis at baseline, respectively. 
For all studies, the primary endpoint was American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response. For 
Psoriatic Arthritis study 1 (PsA study 1) and Psoriatic Arthritis study 2 (PsA study 2), the primary 
endpoint was at week 24. For Psoriatic Arthritis study 3 (PsA study 3), the primary endpoint was at 
week 16 with the key secondary endpoint, the change from baseline in modified Total Sharp Score 
(mTSS), at week 24. 
In PsA study 1, PsA study 2 and PsA study 3, 29%, 35% and 30% of patients, respectively, were 
previously treated with an anti-TNFα agent and discontinued the anti-TNFα agent for either lack of 
efficacy or intolerance (anti-TNFα-IR patients). 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PsA study 1 (FUTURE 1) evaluated 606 patients, of whom 60.7% had concomitant MTX. Patients 
randomised to secukinumab received 10 mg/kg intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 4, followed by either 
75 mg or 150 mg subcutaneously every month starting at week 8. Patients randomised to placebo who 
were non-responders at week 16 (early rescue) and other placebo patients at week 24 were crossed 
over to receive secukinumab (either 75 mg or 150 mg subcutaneously) followed by the same dose 
every month. 
PsA study 2 (FUTURE 2) evaluated 397 patients, of whom 46.6% had concomitant MTX. Patients 
randomised to secukinumab received 75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg subcutaneously at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 
4, followed by the same dose every month. Patients randomised to receive placebo who were 
non-responders at week 16 (early rescue) were crossed over to receive secukinumab (either 150 mg or 
300 mg subcutaneously) at week 16 followed by the same dose every month. Patients randomised to 
receive placebo who were responders at week 16 were crossed over to receive secukinumab (either 
150 mg or 300 mg subcutaneously) at week 24 followed by the same dose every month. 
PsA study 3 (FUTURE 5) evaluated 996 patients, of whom 50.1% had concomitant MTX. Patients 
were randomised to receive secukinumab 150 mg, 300 mg or placebo subcutaneously at weeks 0, 1, 2, 
3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month, or a once monthly injection of secukinumab 150 mg 
(without loading). Patients randomised to receive placebo who were non-responders at week 16 (early 
rescue) were then crossed over to receive secukinumab (either 150 mg or 300 mg subcutaneously) at 
week 16 followed by the same dose every month. Patients randomised to receive placebo who were 
responders at week 16 were crossed over to receive secukinumab (either 150 mg or 300 mg 
subcutaneously) at week 24 followed by the same dose every month. 
Signs and symptoms 
Treatment with secukinumab resulted in significant improvement in measures of disease activity 
compared to placebo at weeks 16 and 24 (see Table 9).

Similar responses for primary and key secondary endpoints were seen in PsA patients regardless of 
whether they were on concomitant MTX treatment or not. In PsA study 2, at week 24, secukinumab-
treated patients with concomitant MTX use had a higher ACR 20 response (47.7% and 54.4% for 
150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, compared to placebo 20.0%) and ACR 50 response (31.8% and 
38.6% for 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, compared to placebo 8.0%). Secukinumab-treated 
patients without concomitant MTX use had a higher ACR 20 response (53.6% and 53.6% for 150 mg 
and 300 mg, respectively, compared to placebo 10.4%) and ACR 50 response (37.5% and 32.1% for 
150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, compared to placebo 6.3%). 
In PsA study 2, both anti-TNFα-naive and anti-TNFα-IR secukinumab-treated patients had a 
significantly higher ACR 20 response compared to placebo at week 24, with a slightly higher response 
in the anti-TNFα-naive group (anti-TNFα-naive: 64% and 58% for 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, 
compared to placebo 15.9%; anti-TNFα-IR: 30% and 46% for 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, 
compared to placebo 14.3%). In the anti-TNFα-IR patients subgroup, only the 300 mg dose showed 
significantly higher response rate for ACR 20 compared to placebo (p<0.05) and demonstrated clinical 
meaningful benefit over 150 mg on multiple secondary endpoints. Improvements in the PASI 75 
response were seen in both subgroups and the 300 mg dose showed statistically significant benefit in 
the anti-TNFα-IR patients. 
Improvements were shown in all components of the ACR scores, including patient assessment of pain. 
In PsA study 2, the proportion of patients achieving a modified PsA Response Criteria (PsARC) 
response was greater in the secukinumab-treated patients (59.0% and 61.0% for 150 mg and 300 mg, 
respectively) compared to placebo (26.5%) at week 24. 
In PsA study 1 and PsA study 2, efficacy was maintained up to week 104. In PsA study 2, among 
200 patients initially randomised to secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg, 178 (89%) patients were still 
on treatment at week 52. Of the 100 patients randomised to secukinumab 150 mg, 64, 39 and 20 had 
an ACR 20/50/70 response, respectively. Of the 100 patients randomised to secukinumab 300 mg, 64, 
44 and 24 had an ACR 20/50/70 response, respectively.

Radiographic response 
In PsA study 3, inhibition of progression of structural damage was assessed radiographically and 
expressed by the modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) and its components, the Erosion Score (ES) and 
the Joint Space Narrowing Score (JSN). Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet were obtained at 
baseline, week 16 and/or week 24 and scored independently by at least two readers who were blinded 
to treatment group and visit number. Secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg treatment significantly 
inhibited the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage compared with placebo treatment as 
measured by change from baseline in mTSS at week 24 (Table 10). 
Inhibition of progression of structural damage was also assessed in PsA study 1 at weeks 24 and 52, 
compared to baseline. Week 24 data are presented in Table 10.

In PsA study 1, inhibition of structural damage was maintained with secukinumab treatment up to 
week 52. 
In PsA study 3, the percentage of patients with no disease progression (defined as a change from 
baseline in mTSS of ≤0.5) from randomisation to week 24 was 80.3%, 88.5% and 73.6% for 
secukinumab 150 mg, 300 mg and placebo, respectively. An effect of inhibition of structural damage 
was observed in anti-TNFα-naïve and anti-TNFα-IR patients and in patients treated with and without 
concomitant MTX. 
In PsA study 1, the percentage of patients with no disease progression (defined as a change from 
baseline in mTSS of ≤0.5) from randomisation to week 24 was 82.3% in secukinumab 10 mg/kg 
intravenous load – 150 mg subcutaneous maintenance and 75.7% in placebo. The percentage of 
patients with no disease progression from week 24 to week 52 for secukinumab 10 mg/kg intravenous 
load – followed by 150 mg subcutaneous maintenance and for placebo patients who switched to 75 mg 
or 150 mg subcutaneous every 4 weeks at week 16 or week 24 was 85.7% and 86.8%, respectively. 
Axial manifestations in PsA 
A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (MAXIMISE) assessed the efficacy of 
secukinumab in 485 PsA patients with axial manifestations who were naive to biologic treatment and 
responded inadequately to NSAIDs. The primary variable of at least a 20% improvement in 
Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS 20) criteria at week 12 was met. 
Treatment with secukinumab 300 mg and 150 mg compared to placebo also resulted in greater 
improvement in signs and symptoms (including decreases from baseline in spinal pain) and 
improvement in physical function (see Table 11).

Physical function and health-related quality of life 
In PsA study 2 and PsA study 3, patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg (p=0.0555 and p<0.0001) 
and 300 mg (p=0.0040 and p<0.0001) showed improvement in physical function compared to patients 
treated with placebo as assessed by Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at 
week 24 and week 16, respectively. Improvements in HAQ-DI scores were seen regardless of previous 
anti-TNFα exposure. Similar responses were seen in PsA study 1. 
Secukinumab-treated patients reported significant improvements in health-related quality of life as 
measured by the Short Form-36 Health Survey Physical Component Summary (SF-36 PCS) score 
(p<0.001). There were also statistically significant improvements demonstrated in exploratory 
endpoints assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue (FACIT-F) 
scores for 150 mg and 300 mg compared to placebo (7.97, 5.97 versus 1.63, respectively) and these 
improvements were maintained up to week 104 in PsA study 2. 
Similar responses were seen in PsA study 1 and efficacy was maintained up to week 52. 
Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) 
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) / Radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
The safety and efficacy of secukinumab were assessed in 816 patients in three randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III studies in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) 
with a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥4 despite non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), corticosteroid or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) 
therapy. Patients in Ankylosing Spondylitis study 1 (AS study 1) and Ankylosing Spondylitis study 2 
(AS study 2) had a diagnosis of AS for a median of 2.7 to 5.8 years. For both studies, the primary 
endpoint was at least a 20% improvement in Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society 
(ASAS 20) criteria at week 16. 
In Ankylosing Spondylitis study 1 (AS study 1), Ankylosing Spondylitis study 2 (AS study 2), and 
Ankylosing Spondylitis study 3 (AS study 3), 27.0%, 38.8%, and 23.5% of patients, respectively, were 
previously treated with an anti-TNFα agent and discontinued the anti-TNFα agent for either lack of 
efficacy or intolerance (anti-TNFα-IR patients). 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AS study 1 (MEASURE 1) evaluated 371 patients, of whom 14.8% and 33.4% used concomitant 
MTX or sulfasalazine, respectively. Patients randomised to secukinumab received 10 mg/kg 
intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 4, followed by either 75 mg or 150 mg subcutaneously every month 
starting at week 8. Patients randomised to placebo who were non-responders at week 16 (early rescue) 
and all other placebo patients at week 24 were crossed over to receive secukinumab (either 75 mg or 
150 mg subcutaneously), followed by the same dose every month. 
AS study 2 (MEASURE 2) evaluated 219 patients, of whom 11.9% and 14.2% used concomitant 
MTX or sulfasalazine, respectively. Patients randomised to secukinumab received 75 mg or 150 mg 
subcutaneously at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month. At week 16, 
patients who were randomised to placebo at baseline were re-randomised to receive secukinumab 
(either 75 mg or 150 mg subcutaneously) every month. 
AS study 3 (MEASURE 3) evaluated 226 patients, of whom 13.3% and 23.5% used concomitant 
MTX or sulfasalazine, respectively. Patients randomised to secukinumab received 10 mg/kg 
intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 4, followed by either 150 mg or 300 mg subcutaneously every month. 
At week 16, patients who were randomised to placebo at baseline were re-randomised to receive 
secukinumab (either 150 mg or 300 mg subcutaneously) every month. The primary endpoint was 
ASAS 20 at week 16. Patients were blinded to the treatment regimen up to week 52, and the study 
continued to week 156. 
Signs and symptoms: 
In AS study 2, treatment with secukinumab 150 mg resulted in greater improvement in measures of 
disease activity compared with placebo at week 16 (see Table 12).

The onset of action of secukinumab 150 mg occurred as early as week 1 for ASAS 20 and week 2 for 
ASAS 40 (superior to placebo) in AS study 2. 
ASAS 20 responses were improved at week 16 in both anti-TNFα-naïve patients (68.2% versus 
31.1%; p<0.05) and anti-TNFα-IR patients (50.0% versus 24.1%; p<0.05) for secukinumab 150 mg 
compared with placebo, respectively. 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In AS study 1 and AS study 2, secukinumab-treated patients (150 mg in AS study 2 and both regimens 
in AS study 1) demonstrated significantly improved signs and symptoms at week 16, with comparable 
magnitude of response and efficacy maintained up to week 52 in both anti-TNFα-naive and 
anti-TNFα-IR patients. In AS study 2, among 72 patients initially randomised to secukinumab 150 mg, 
61 (84.7%) patients were still on treatment at week 52. Of the 72 patients randomised to secukinumab 
150 mg, 45 and 35 had an ASAS 20/40 response, respectively. 
In AS study 3, patients treated with secukinumab (150 mg and 300 mg) demonstrated improved signs 
and symptoms, and had comparable efficacy responses regardless of dose that were superior to 
placebo at week 16 for the primary endpoint (ASAS 20). Overall, the efficacy response rates for the 
300 mg group were consistently greater compared to the 150 mg group for the secondary endpoints. 
During the blinded period, the ASAS 20 and ASAS 40 responses were 69.7% and 47.6% for 150 mg 
and 74.3% and 57.4% for 300 mg at week 52, respectively. The ASAS 20 and ASAS 40 responses 
were maintained up to week 156 (69.5% and 47.6% for 150 mg versus 74.8% and 55.6% for 300 mg). 
Greater response rates favouring 300 mg were also observed for ASAS partial remission (ASAS PR) 
response at week 16 and were maintained up to week 156. Larger differences in response rates, 
favouring 300 mg over 150 mg, were observed in anti-TNFα-IR patients (n=36) compared to 
anti-TNFα-naïve patients (n=114). 
Spinal mobility: 
Patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg showed improvements in spinal mobility as measured by 
change from baseline in BASMI at week 16 for both AS study 1 (-0.40 versus -0.12 for placebo; 
p=0.0114) and AS study 2 (-0.51 versus -0.22 for placebo; p=0.0533). These improvements were 
sustained up to week 52. 
Physical function and health-related quality of life: 
In AS study 1 and study 2, patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg showed improvements in health-
related quality of life as measured by AS Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL) (p=0.001) and SF-36 
Physical Component Summary (SF-36PCS) (p<0.001). Patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg also 
showed statistically significant improvements on exploratory endpoints in physical function as 
assessed by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) compared to placebo (-2.15 
versus -0.68), and in fatigue as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-
Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) scale compared to placebo (8.10 versus 3.30). These improvements were 
sustained up to week 52. 
Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) 
The safety and efficacy of secukinumab were assessed in 555 patients in one randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study (PREVENT), consisting of a 2-year core phase and a 
2-year extension phase, in patients with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) 
fulfilling the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) classification criteria for 
axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) with no radiographic evidence of changes in the sacroiliac joints that 
would meet the modified New York criteria for ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Patients enrolled had 
active disease, defined as a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥4, a 
Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for total back pain of ≥40 (on a scale of 0-100 mm), despite current or 
previous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy and increased C-reactive protein 
(CRP) and/or evidence of sacroiliitis on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Patients in this study 
had a diagnosis of axSpA for a mean of 2.1 to 3.0 years and 54% of the study participants were 
female. 
In the PREVENT study, 9.7% of patients were previously treated with an anti-TNFα agent and 
discontinued the anti-TNFα agent for either lack of efficacy or intolerance (anti-TNFα-IR patients). 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the PREVENT study, 9.9% and 14.8% of patients used concomitant MTX or sulfasalazine, 
respectively. In the double-blind period, patients received either placebo or secukinumab for 52 weeks. 
Patients randomised to secukinumab received 150 mg subcutaneously at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 
followed by the same dose every month, or a once monthly injection of secukinumab 150 mg. The 
primary endpoint was at least 40% improvement in Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International 
Society (ASAS 40) at Week 16 in anti-TNFα-naive patients. 
Signs and symptoms: 
In the PREVENT study, treatment with secukinumab 150 mg resulted in significant improvements in 
the measures of disease activity compared to placebo at week 16. These measures include ASAS 40, 
ASAS 5/6, BASDAI score, BASDAI 50, high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), ASAS 20 and ASAS partial 
remission response compared to placebo (Table 13). Responses were maintained up to week 52.

ASAS 40 responses were also improved at week 16 in anti-TNFα-IR patients for secukinumab 150 mg 
compared with placebo. 
Physical function and health-related quality of life: 
Patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg showed statistically significant improvements by week 16 
compared to placebo-treated patients in physical function as assessed by the BASFI (week 16: -1.75 
versus -1.01, p<0.05). Patients treated with secukinumab reported significant improvements compared 
to placebo-treated patients by week 16 in health-related quality of life as measured by ASQoL (LS 
mean change: week 16: -3.45 versus -1.84, p<0.05) and SF-36 Physical Component Summary (SF-36 
PCS) (LS mean change: week 16: 5.71 versus 2.93, p<0.05). These improvements were sustained up 
to week 52. 
Spinal mobility: 
Spinal mobility was assessed by BASMI up to week 16. Numerically greater improvements were 
demonstrated in patients treated with secukinumab compared with placebo-treated patients at weeks 4, 
8, 12 and 16. 
Inhibition of inflammation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): 
Signs of inflammation were assessed by MRI at baseline and week 16 and expressed as change from 
baseline in Berlin SI-joint oedema score for sacroiliac joints and ASspiMRI-a score and Berlin spine 
score for the spine. Inhibition of inflammatory signs in both sacroiliac joints and the spine was 
observed in patients treated with secukinumab. Mean change from baseline in Berlin SI-joint oedema 
score was -1.68 for patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg (n=180) versus -0.39 for the 
placebo-treated patients (n=174) (p<0.05).

Paediatric population 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Secukinumab has been shown to improve signs and symptoms, and health-related quality of life in 
paediatric patients 6 years and older with plaque psoriasis (see Tables 15 and 17). 
Severe plaque psoriasis 
The safety and efficacy of secukinumab were assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo and 
etanercept-controlled phase III study in paediatric patients from 6 to <18 years of age with severe 
plaque psoriasis, as defined by a PASI score ≥20, an IGA mod 2011 score of 4, and BSA involvement 
of ≥10%, who were candidates for systemic therapy. Approximately 43% of the patients had prior 
exposure to phototherapy, 53% to conventional systemic therapy, 3% to biologics, and 9% had 
concomitant psoriatic arthritis. 
The paediatric psoriasis study 1 evaluated 162 patients who were randomised to receive low dose 
secukinumab (75 mg for body weight <50 kg or 150 mg for body weight ≥50 kg), high dose 
secukinumab (75 mg for body weight <25 kg, 150 mg for body weight between ≥25 kg and <50 kg, or 
300 mg for body weight ≥50 kg), or placebo at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by the same dose 
every 4 weeks, or etanercept. Patients randomised to etanercept received 0.8 mg/kg weekly (up to a 
maximum of 50 mg). Patient distribution by weight and age at randomisation is described in Table 14.

Patients randomised to receive placebo who were non-responders at week 12 were switched to either 
the secukinumab low or high dose group (dose based on body weight group) and received study drug 
at weeks 12, 13, 14, and 15, followed by the same dose every 4 weeks starting at week 16. The co-
primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 response and IGA mod 
2011 ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (0 or 1) response at week 12. 
During the 12 week placebo-controlled period, the efficacy of both the low and the high dose of 
secukinumab was comparable for the co-primary endpoints. The odds ratio estimates in favour of both 
secukinumab doses were statistically significant for both the PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 
responses. 
All patients were followed for efficacy and safety during the 52 weeks following the first dose. The 
proportion of patients achieving PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (0 or 1) 
responses showed separation between secukinumab treatment groups and placebo at the first post-
baseline visit at week 4, the difference becoming more prominent at week 12. The response was 
maintained throughout the 52 week time period (see Table 15). Improvement in PASI 50, 90, 100 
responder rates and Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) scores of 0 or 1 were also 
maintained throughout the 52 week time period. 
In addition, PASI 75, IGA 0 or 1, PASI 90 response rates at weeks 12 and 52 for both secukinumab 
low and high dose groups were higher than the rates for patients treated with etanercept (see Table 15). 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Beyond week 12, efficacy of both the low and the high dose of secukinumab was comparable although 
the efficacy of the high dose was higher for patients ≥50 kg. The safety profiles of the low dose and 
the high dose were comparable and consistent with the safety profile in adults.

A higher proportion of paediatric patients treated with secukinumab reported improvement in health-
related quality of life as measured by a CDLQI score of 0 or 1 compared to placebo at week 12 (low 
dose 44.7%, high dose 50%, placebo 15%). Over time up to and including week 52 both secukinumab 
dose groups were numerically higher than the etanercept group (low dose 60.6%, high dose 66.7%, 
etanercept 44.4%). 
Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis 
Secukinumab was predicted to be effective for the treatment of paediatric patients with moderate 
plaque psoriasis based on the demonstrated efficacy and exposure response relationship in adult 
patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, and the similarity of the disease course, 
pathophysiology, and drug effect in adult and paediatric patients at the same exposure levels. 
Moreover, the safety and efficacy of secukinumab was assessed in an open-label, two-arm, 
parallel-group, multicentre phase III study in paediatric patients from 6 to <18 years of age with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, as defined by a PASI score ≥12, an IGA mod 2011 score of ≥3, 
and BSA involvement of ≥10%, who were candidates for systemic therapy. 
The paediatric psoriasis study 2 evaluated 84 patients who were randomised to receive low dose 
secukinumab (75 mg for body weight <50 kg or 150 mg for body weight ≥50 kg) or high dose 
secukinumab (75 mg for body weight <25 kg, 150 mg for body weight between ≥25 kg and <50 kg, or 
300 mg for body weight ≥50 kg) at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by the same dose every 4 weeks. 
Patient distribution by weight and age at randomisation is described in Table 16.

The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 response and IGA 
mod 2011 ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (0 or 1) response at week 12. 
The efficacy of both the low and the high dose of secukinumab was comparable and showed 
statistically significant improvement compared to historical placebo for the co-primary endpoints. The 
estimated posterior probability of a positive treatment effect was 100%. 
Patients were followed for efficacy over a 52 week period after first administration. Efficacy (defined 
as PASI 75 response and IGA mod 2011 ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ [0 or 1]) was observed as early as the 
first post-baseline visit at week 2, and the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 response and 
IGA mod 2011 ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (0 or 1) increased up to week 24 and were sustained until 
week 52. Improvement in PASI 90 and PASI 100 were also observed at week 12, increased up to 
week 24, and were sustained until week 52 (see Table 17). 
The safety profiles of the low dose and the high dose were comparable and consistent with the safety 
profile in adults.

These outcomes in the paediatric moderate to severe plaque psoriasis population confirmed the 
predictive assumptions based on the efficacy and exposure response relationship in adult patients, 
mentioned above. 
In the low dose group, 50% and 70.7% of patients achieved a CDLQI 0 or 1 score at weeks 12 and 52, 
respectively. In the high dose group, 61.9% and 70.3% achieved a CDLQI 0 or 1 score at weeks 12 
and 52, respectively.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) 
Enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) and juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) 
The efficacy and safety of secukinumab were assessed in 86 patients in a 3-part, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, event-driven, randomised, phase III study in patients 2 to <18 years of age with 
active ERA or JPsA as diagnosed based on a modified International League of Associations for 
Rheumatology (ILAR) JIA classification criteria. The study consisted of an open-label portion (Part 1) 
where all patients received secukinumab until week 12. Patients demonstrating a JIA ACR 30 
response at week 12 entered into the Part 2 double-blind phase and were randomised 1:1 to continue 
treatment with secukinumab or to begin treatment with placebo (randomised withdrawal) until 
week 104 or until a flare occured. Patients who flared then entered open-label secukinumab treatment 
until week 104 (Part 3). 
The JIA patient subtypes at study entry were: 60.5% ERA and 39.5% JPsA, who either had inadequate 
response or were intolerant to ≥1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and ≥1 non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). At baseline, MTX use was reported for 65.1% of 
patients; (63.5% [33/52] of ERA patients and 67.6% [23/34] of JPsA patients). There were 12 out of 
52 ERA patients concomitantly treated with sulfasalazine (23.1%). Patients with a body weight at 
baseline <50 kg (n=30) were given a dose of 75 mg and patients with a body weight ≥50 kg (n=56) 
were given a dose of 150 mg. Age at baseline ranged from 2 to 17 years, with 3 patients between 2 to 
<6 years, 22 patients 6 to <12 years and 61 patients 12 to <18 years. At baseline the Juvenile Arthritis 
Disease Activity Score (JADAS)-27 was 15.1 (SD:7.1). 
The primary endpoint was time to flare in the randomised withdrawal period (Part 2). Disease flare 
was defined as a ≥30% worsening in at least three of the six JIA ACR response criteria and ≥30% 
improvement in not more than one of the six JIA ACR response criteria and a minimum of two active 
joints. 
At the end of Part 1, 75 out of 86 (87.2%) patients demonstrated a JIA ACR 30 response and entered 
into Part 2. 
The study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant prolongation in the time 
to disease flare in patients treated with secukinumab compared to placebo in Part 2. The risk of flare 
was reduced by 72% for patients on secukinumab compared with patients on placebo in Part 2 (Hazard 
ratio=0.28, 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.63, p<0.001) (Figure 4 and Table 18). During Part 2, a total of 
21 patients in the placebo group experienced a flare event (11 JPsA and 10 ERA) compared with 
10 patients in the secukinumab group (4 JPsA and 6 ERA).

In open-label Part 1, all patients received secukinumab until week 12. At week 12, 83.7%, 67.4%, and 
38.4% of children were JIA ACR 50, 70 and 90 responders, respectively (Figure 5). The onset of 
action of secukinumab occurred as early as week 1. At week 12 the JADAS-27 score was 4.64 
(SD:4.73) and the mean decrease from baseline in JADAS-27 was -10.487 (SD:7.23).

The data in the 2 to <6 age group were inconclusive due to the low number of patients below 6 years 
of age enrolled in the study. 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Cosentyx in plaque psoriasis in paediatric patients aged from birth to less than 6 years and in chronic 
idiopathic arthritis for paediatric patients aged from birth to less than 2 years (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Most pharmacokinetics properties observed in patients with plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and 
ankylosing spondylitis were similar. 
Absorption 
Following a single subcutaneous dose of 300 mg as a liquid formulation in healthy volunteers, 
secukinumab reached peak serum concentrations of 43.2±10.4 μg/ml between 2 and 14 days post dose. 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following a single subcutaneous dose of either 150 mg 
or 300 mg in plaque psoriasis patients, secukinumab reached peak serum concentrations of 
13.7±4.8 µg/ml or 27.3±9.5 µg/ml, respectively, between 5 and 6 days post dose. 
After initial weekly dosing during the first month, time to reach the maximum concentration was 
between 31 and 34 days based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
On the basis of simulated data, peak concentrations at steady-state (Cmax,ss) following subcutaneous 
administration of 150 mg or 300 mg were 27.6 µg/ml and 55.2 µg/ml, respectively. Population 
pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that steady-state is reached after 20 weeks with monthly dosing 
regimens. 
Compared with exposure after a single dose, the population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that 
patients exhibited a 2-fold increase in peak serum concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) 
following repeated monthly dosing during maintenance. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that secukinumab was absorbed with an average absolute 
bioavailability of 73% in patients with plaque psoriasis. Across studies, absolute bioavailabilities in 
the range between 60 and 77% were calculated. 
The bioavailability of secukinumab in PsA patients was 85% on the basis of the population 
pharmacokinetic model. 
Following a single subcutaneous injection of 300 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe in 
plaque psoriasis patients, secukinumab systemic exposure was similar to what was observed 
previously with two injections of 150 mg. 
Following subcutaneous administration of 300 mg at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 followed by 300 mg every 
2 weeks, the mean ± SD steady-state secukinumab trough concentration at week 16 was approximately 
55.1±26.7 µg/ml and 58.1±30.1 µg/ml in HS study 1 and HS study 2, respectively. 
Distribution 
The mean volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz) following single intravenous 
administration ranged from 7.10 to 8.60 litres in plaque psoriasis patients, suggesting that 
secukinumab undergoes limited distribution to peripheral compartments. 
Biotransformation 
The majority of IgG elimination occurs via intracellular catabolism, following fluid-phase or receptor 
mediated endocytosis. 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Mean systemic clearance (CL) following a single intravenous administration to patients with plaque 
psoriasis ranged from 0.13 to 0.36 l/day. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the mean systemic 
clearance (CL) was 0.19 l/day in plaque psoriasis patients. The CL was not impacted by gender. 
Clearance was dose- and time-independent. 
The mean elimination half-life, as estimated from population pharmacokinetic analysis, was 27 days in 
plaque psoriasis patients, ranging from 18 to 46 days across psoriasis studies with intravenous 
administration. 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the mean systemic CL following subcutaneous 
administration of 300 mg at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by 300 mg every 2 weeks to patients with 
hidradenitis suppurativa was 0.26 l/day. 
The mean elimination half-life, as estimated from population pharmacokinetic analysis, was 23 days in 
hidradenitis suppurativa patients. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of secukinumab in plaque psoriasis patients were 
determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 1x 0.3 mg/kg to 3x 10 mg/kg and 
with subcutaneous doses ranging from 1x 25 mg to multiple doses of 300 mg. Exposure was dose 
proportional across all dosing regimens. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis with a limited number of elderly patients (n=71 for age 
≥65 years and n=7 for age ≥75 years), clearance in elderly patients and patients less than 65 years of 
age was similar. 
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. The renal 
elimination of intact secukinumab, an IgG monoclonal antibody, is expected to be low and of minor 
importance. IgGs are mainly eliminated via catabolism and hepatic impairment is not expected to 
influence clearance of secukinumab. 
Effect of weight on pharmacokinetics 
Secukinumab clearance and volume of distribution increase as body weight increases. 
Paediatric population 
Plaque psoriasis 
In a pool of the two paediatric studies, patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (6 to less than 
18 years of age) were administered secukinumab at the recommended paediatric dosing regimen. At 
week 24, patients weighing ≥25 and <50 kg had a mean ± SD steady-state trough concentration of 
19.8 ± 6.96 µg/ml (n=24) after 75 mg of secukinumab and patients weighing ≥50 kg had mean ±SD 
trough concentration of 27.3 ± 10.1 µg/ml (n=36) after 150 mg of secukinumab. The mean ± SD 
steady-state trough concentration in patients weighing <25 kg (n=8) was 32.6 ± 10.8 µg/ml at week 24 
after 75 mg dose. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
In a paediatric study, ERA and JPsA patients (2 to less than 18 years of age) were administered 
secukinumab at the recommended paediatric dosing regimen. At week 24, patients weighing <50 kg, 
and weighing ≥50 kg had a mean ± SD steady-state trough concentration of 25.2±5.45 µg/ml (n=10) 
and 27.9±9.57 µg/ml (n=19), respectively. 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans (adult or paediatric) based on conventional 
studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose and reproductive toxicity, or tissue cross-reactivity. 
Animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of secukinumab.

For all of the above indications, available data suggest that a clinical response is usually achieved 
within 16 weeks of treatment. Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients 
who have shown no response by 16 weeks of treatment. Some patients with an initial partial response 
may subsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 16 weeks. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients (aged 65 years and over) 
No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment / hepatic impairment 
Cosentyx has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Cosentyx in children with plaque psoriasis and in the juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis (JIA) categories of ERA and JPsA below the age of 6 years have not been established. 
The safety and efficacy of Cosentyx in children below the age of 18 years in other indications have not 
yet been established. No data are available. 
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Method of administration 
Cosentyx is to be administered by subcutaneous injection. If possible, areas of the skin that show 
psoriasis should be avoided as injection sites. The powder for solution for injection must be 
reconstituted before use. 
The reconstitution, dose preparation and administration of the powder for solution for injection is to be 
done by a healthcare professional. For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before 
administration, see section 6.6 and the Instructions for Use in the package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Clinically important, active infection, e.g. active tuberculosis (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Infections 
Secukinumab has the potential to increase the risk of infections. Serious infections have been observed 
in patients receiving secukinumab in the post-marketing setting. Caution should be exercised when 
considering the use of secukinumab in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent 
infection. 
Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection 
occur. If a patient develops a serious infection, the patient should be closely monitored and 
secukinumab should not be administered until the infection resolves. 
In clinical studies, infections have been observed in patients receiving secukinumab (see section 4.8). 
Most of these were mild or moderate upper respiratory tract infections such as nasopharyngitis and did 
not require treatment discontinuation. 
Related to the mechanism of action of secukinumab, non-serious mucocutaneous candida infections 
were more frequently reported for secukinumab than placebo in the psoriasis clinical studies (3.55 per 
100 patient years for secukinumab 300 mg versus 1.00 per 100 patient years for placebo) (see 
section 4.8). 
No increased susceptibility to tuberculosis was reported from clinical studies. However, secukinumab 
should not be given to patients with active tuberculosis. Anti-tuberculosis therapy should be 
considered prior to initiation of secukinumab in patients with latent tuberculosis. 
Inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) 
Cases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with secukinumab 
(see section 4.8). Secukinumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a 
patient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of 
pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease, secukinumab should be discontinued and appropriate 
medical management should be initiated. 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
In clinical studies, rare cases of anaphylactic reactions have been observed in patients receiving 
secukinumab. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reactions occur, administration of 
secukinumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. 
Vaccinations 
Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with secukinumab. 
Patients receiving secukinumab may receive concurrent inactivated or non-live vaccinations. In a 
study, after meningococcal and inactivated influenza vaccinations, a similar proportion of healthy 
volunteers treated with 150 mg of secukinumab and those treated with placebo were able to mount an 
adequate immune response of at least a 4-fold increase in antibody titres to meningococcal and 
influenza vaccines. The data suggest that secukinumab does not suppress the humoral immune 
response to the meningococcal or influenza vaccines. 
Prior to initiating therapy with Cosentyx, it is recommended that paediatric patients receive all 
age-appropriate immunisations as per current immunisation guidelines. 
Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy 
In psoriasis studies, the safety and efficacy of secukinumab in combination with immunosuppressants, 
including biologics, or phototherapy have not been evaluated. Secukinumab was administered 
concomitantly with methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine and/or corticosteroids in arthritis studies 
(including in patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis). Caution should be exercised 
when considering concomitant use of other immunosuppressants and secukinumab (see also 
section 4.5). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with secukinumab (see also section 4.4). 
In a study in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, no interaction was observed between secukinumab 
and midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate). 
No interaction was seen when secukinumab was administered concomitantly with methotrexate 
(MTX) and/or corticosteroids in arthritis studies (including in patients with psoriatic arthritis and axial 
spondyloarthritis). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment 
and for at least 20 weeks after treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of secukinumab in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Cosentyx during 
pregnancy. 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether secukinumab is excreted in human milk. Immunoglobulins are excreted in 
human milk and it is not known if secukinumab is absorbed systemically after ingestion. Because of 
the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from secukinumab, a decision on whether to 
discontinue breast-feeding during treatment and up to 20 weeks after treatment or to discontinue 
therapy with Cosentyx must be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and 
the benefit of therapy to the woman. 
Fertility 
The effect of secukinumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Cosentyx has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions are upper respiratory tract infections (17.1%) (most 
frequently nasopharyngitis, rhinitis). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions from clinical studies and post-marketing reports (Table 3) are listed by MedDRA 
system organ class. Within each system organ class, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, 
with the most frequent reactions first. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented 
in order of decreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse 
reaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 000); and not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data). 
Over 20 000 patients have been treated with secukinumab in blinded and open-label clinical studies in 
various indications (plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, hidradenitis 
suppurativa and other autoimmune conditions), representing 34 908 patient years of exposure. Of 
these, over 14 000 patients were exposed to secukinumab for at least one year. The safety profile of 
secukinumab is consistent across all indications.

1) Placebo-controlled clinical studies (phase III) in plaque psoriasis, PsA, AS, nr-axSpA and HS 
patients exposed to 300 mg, 150 mg, 75 mg or placebo up to 12 weeks (psoriasis) or 16 weeks 
(PsA, AS, nr-axSpA and HS) treatment duration 
2) Cases were reported in patients with psoriasis diagnosis 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infections 
In the placebo-controlled period of clinical studies in plaque psoriasis (a total of 1 382 patients treated 
with secukinumab and 694 patients treated with placebo for up to 12 weeks), infections were reported 
in 28.7% of patients treated with secukinumab compared with 18.9% of patients treated with placebo. 
The majority of infections consisted of non-serious and mild to moderate upper respiratory tract 
infections, such as nasopharyngitis, which did not necessitate treatment discontinuation. There was an 
increase in mucosal or cutaneous candidiasis, consistent with the mechanism of action, but the cases 
were mild or moderate in severity, non-serious, responsive to standard treatment and did not 
necessitate treatment discontinuation. Serious infections occurred in 0.14% of patients treated with 
secukinumab and in 0.3% of patients treated with placebo (see section 4.4). 
Over the entire treatment period (a total of 3 430 patients treated with secukinumab for up to 52 weeks 
for the majority of patients), infections were reported in 47.5% of patients treated with secukinumab 
(0.9 per patient-year of follow-up). Serious infections were reported in 1.2% of patients treated with 
secukinumab (0.015 per patient-year of follow-up). 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
Infection rates observed in psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and 
non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) clinical studies were similar to those observed in the 
psoriasis studies. 
Patients with hidradenitis suppurativa are more susceptible to infections. In the placebo-controlled 
period of clinical studies in hidradenitis suppurativa (a total of 721 patients treated with secukinumab 
and 363 patients treated with placebo for up to 16 weeks), infections were numerically higher 
compared to those observed in the psoriasis studies (30.7% of patients treated with secukinumab 
compared with 31.7% in patients treated with placebo). Most of these were non-serious, mild or 
moderate in severity and did not require treatment discontinuation or interruption. 
Neutropenia 
In psoriasis phase III clinical studies, neutropenia was more frequently observed with secukinumab 
than with placebo, but most cases were mild, transient and reversible. Neutropenia <1.0-0.5x109/l 
(CTCAE grade 3) was reported in 18 out of 3 430 (0.5%) patients on secukinumab, with no dose 
dependence and no temporal relationship to infections in 15 out of 18 cases. There were no reported 
cases of more severe neutropenia. Non-serious infections with usual response to standard care and not 
requiring discontinuation of secukinumab were reported in the remaining 3 cases. 
The frequency of neutropenia in psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and 
non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) and hidradenitis suppurativa was similar to psoriasis. 
Rare cases of neutropenia <0.5x109/l (CTCAE grade 4) were reported. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
In clinical studies, urticaria and rare cases of anaphylactic reaction to secukinumab were observed (see 
also section 4.4). 
Immunogenicity 
In psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic 
axial spondyloarthritis) and hidradenitis suppurativa clinical studies, less than 1% of patients treated 
with secukinumab developed antibodies to secukinumab up to 52 weeks of treatment. About half of 
the treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies were neutralising, but this was not associated with loss of 
efficacy or pharmacokinetic abnormalities. 
Paediatric population 
Undesirable effects in paediatric patients from the age of 6 years with plaque psoriasis 
The safety of secukinumab was assessed in two phase III studies in paediatric patients with plaque 
psoriasis. The first study (paediatric study 1) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 
162 patients from 6 to less than 18 years of age with severe plaque psoriasis. The second study 
(paediatric study 2) is an open-label study of 84 patients from 6 to less than 18 years of age with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The safety profile reported in these two studies was consistent 
with the safety profile reported in adult plaque psoriasis patients. 
Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with JIA 
The safety of secukinumab was also assessed in a phase III study in 86 juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
patients with ERA and JPsA from 2 to less than 18 years of age. The safety profile reported in this 
study was consistent with the safety profile reported in adult patients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.9  Overdose 
Doses up to 30 mg/kg (approximately 2000 to 3000 mg) have been administered intravenously in 
clinical studies without dose-limiting toxicity. In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the 
patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic 
treatment be instituted immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC10 
Mechanism of action 
Secukinumab is a fully human IgG1/κ monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and neutralises 
the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A). Secukinumab works by targeting IL-17A and 
inhibiting its interaction with the IL-17 receptor, which is expressed on various cell types including 
keratinocytes. As a result, secukinumab inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines 
and mediators of tissue damage and reduces IL-17A-mediated contributions to autoimmune and 
inflammatory diseases. Clinically relevant levels of secukinumab reach the skin and reduce local 
inflammatory markers. As a direct consequence treatment with secukinumab reduces erythema, 
induration and desquamation present in plaque psoriasis lesions. 
IL-17A is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune 
responses. IL-17A plays a key role in the pathogenesis of plaque psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, 
psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis) and is up-regulated in lesional skin in contrast to non-lesional skin of plaque 
psoriasis patients and in synovial tissue of psoriatic arthritis patients. IL-17A is also upregulated in 
hidradenitis suppurativa lesions and increased IL-17A serum levels have been observed in affected 
patients. The frequency of IL-17-producing cells was also significantly higher in the subchondral bone 
marrow of facet joints from patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Increased numbers of IL-17A 
producing lymphocytes have also been found in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. 
Inhibition of IL-17A was shown to be effective in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, thus 
establishing the key role of this cytokine in axial spondyloarthritis. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Serum levels of total IL-17A (free and secukinumab-bound IL-17A) are initially increased in patients 
receiving secukinumab. This is followed by a slow decrease due to reduced clearance of 
secukinumab-bound IL-17A, indicating that secukinumab selectively captures free IL-17A, which 
plays a key role in the pathogenesis of plaque psoriasis. 
In a study with secukinumab, infiltrating epidermal neutrophils and various neutrophil-associated 
markers that are increased in lesional skin of plaque psoriasis patients were significantly reduced after 
one to two weeks of treatment. 
Secukinumab has been shown to lower (within 1 to 2 weeks of treatment) levels of C-reactive protein, 
which is a marker of inflammation.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Adult plaque psoriasis 
The safety and efficacy of secukinumab were assessed in four randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled phase III studies in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were 
candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy [ERASURE, FIXTURE, FEATURE, JUNCTURE]. 
The efficacy and safety of secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg were evaluated versus either placebo or 
etanercept. In addition, one study assessed a chronic treatment regimen versus a “retreatment as 
needed” regimen [SCULPTURE]. 
Of the 2 403 patients who were included in the placebo-controlled studies, 79% were biologic-naive, 
45% were non-biologic failures and 8% were biologic failures (6% were anti-TNF failures, and 2% 
were anti-p40 failures). Approximately 15 to 25% of patients in phase III studies had psoriatic arthritis 
(PsA) at baseline. 
Psoriasis study 1 (ERASURE) evaluated 738 patients. Patients randomised to secukinumab received 
150 mg or 300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month. Psoriasis 
study 2 (FIXTURE) evaluated 1 306 patients. Patients randomised to secukinumab received 150 mg or 
300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month. Patients randomised 
to etanercept received 50 mg doses twice per week for 12 weeks followed by 50 mg every week. In 
both study 1 and study 2, patients randomised to receive placebo who were non-responders at week 12 
then crossed over to receive secukinumab (either 150 mg or 300 mg) at weeks 12, 13, 14, and 15, 
followed by the same dose every month starting at week 16. All patients were followed for up to 
52 weeks following first administration of study treatment. 
Psoriasis study 3 (FEATURE) evaluated 177 patients using a pre-filled syringe compared with placebo 
after 12 weeks of treatment to assess the safety, tolerability, and usability of secukinumab 
self-administration via the pre-filled syringe. Psoriasis study 4 (JUNCTURE) evaluated 182 patients 
using a pre-filled pen compared with placebo after 12 weeks of treatment to assess the safety, 
tolerability, and usability of secukinumab self-administration via the pre-filled pen. In both study 3 
and study 4, patients randomised to secukinumab received 150 mg or 300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 
and 4, followed by the same dose every month. Patients were also randomised to receive placebo at 
weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month. 
Psoriasis study 5 (SCULPTURE) evaluated 966 patients. All patients received secukinumab 150 mg or 
300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 12 and then were randomised to receive either a 
maintenance regimen of the same dose every month starting at week 12 or a “retreatment as needed” 
regimen of the same dose. Patients randomised to “retreatment as needed” did not achieve adequate 
maintenance of response and therefore a fixed monthly maintenance regimen is recommended. 
The co-primary endpoints in the placebo and active-controlled studies were the proportion of patients 
who achieved a PASI 75 response and IGA mod 2011 “clear” or “almost clear” response versus 
placebo at week 12 (see Tables 4 and 5). The 300 mg dose provided improved skin clearance 
particularly for “clear” or “almost clear” skin across the efficacy endpoints of PASI 90, PASI 100, and 
IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response across all studies with peak effects seen at week 16, therefore this dose 
is recommended.

n (%) 
* The IGA mod 2011 is a 5-category scale including “0 = clear”, “1 = almost clear”, “2 = mild”, “3 = 
moderate” or “4 = severe”, indicating the physician’s overall assessment of the psoriasis severity focusing 
on induration, erythema and scaling. Treatment success of “clear” or “almost clear” consisted of no signs of 
psoriasis or normal to pink colouration of lesions, no thickening of the plaque and none to minimal focal 
scaling.

In an additional psoriasis study (CLEAR) 676 patients were evaluated. Secukinumab 300 mg met the 
primary and secondary endpoints by showing superiority to ustekinumab based on PASI 90 response 
at week 16 (primary endpoint), speed of onset of PASI 75 response at week 4, and long-term PASI 90 
response at week 52. Greater efficacy of secukinumab compared to ustekinumab for the endpoints 
PASI 75/90/100 and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response (“clear” or “almost clear”) was observed early 
and continued through to week 52 (Table 6).

Secukinumab was efficacious in systemic treatment-naive, biologic-naive, biologic/anti-TNF-exposed 
and biologic/anti-TNF-failure patients. Improvements in PASI 75 in patients with concurrent psoriatic 
arthritis at baseline were similar to those in the overall plaque psoriasis population. 
Secukinumab was associated with a fast onset of efficacy with a 50% reduction in mean PASI by 
week 3 for the 300 mg dose.

Specific locations/forms of plaque psoriasis 
In two additional placebo-controlled studies, improvement was seen in both nail psoriasis 
(TRANSFIGURE, 198 patients) and palmoplantar plaque psoriasis (GESTURE, 205 patients). In the 
TRANSFIGURE study, secukinumab was superior to placebo at week 16 (46.1% for 300 mg, 38.4% 
for 150 mg and 11.7% for placebo) as assessed by significant improvement from baseline in the Nail 
Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI %) for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis with nail 
involvement. In the GESTURE study, secukinumab was superior to placebo at week 16 (33.3% for 
300 mg, 22.1% for 150 mg, and 1.5% for placebo) as assessed by significant improvement of ppIGA 0 
or 1 response (“clear” or “almost clear”) for patients with moderate to severe palmoplantar plaque 
psoriasis. 
A placebo-controlled study evaluated 102 patients with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis, defined as 
having a Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) score of ≥12, an IGA mod 2011 scalp only score of 3 
or greater and at least 30% of the scalp surface area affected. Secukinumab 300 mg was superior to 
placebo at week 12 as assessed by significant improvement from baseline in both the PSSI 90 response 
(52.9% versus 2.0%) and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 scalp only response (56.9% versus 5.9%). 
Improvement in both endpoints was sustained for secukinumab patients who continued treatment 
through to week 24. 
Quality of life/patient-reported outcomes 
Statistically significant improvements at week 12 (studies 1-4) from baseline compared to placebo 
were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). Mean decreases (improvements) in 
DLQI from baseline ranged from -10.4 to -11.6 with secukinumab 300 mg, from -7.7 to -10.1 with 
secukinumab 150 mg, versus -1.1 to -1.9 for placebo at week 12. These improvements were 
maintained for 52 weeks (studies 1 and 2). 
Forty percent of the participants in studies 1 and 2 completed the Psoriasis Symptom Diary©. For the 
participants completing the diary in each of these studies, statistically significant improvements at 
week 12 from baseline compared to placebo in patient-reported signs and symptoms of itching, pain 
and scaling were demonstrated. 
Statistically significant improvements at week 4 from baseline in patients treated with secukinumab 
compared to patients treated with ustekinumab (CLEAR) were demonstrated in the DLQI and these 
improvements were maintained for up to 52 weeks.

Statistically significant improvements in patient-reported signs and symptoms of itching, pain and 
scaling at week 16 and week 52 (CLEAR) were demonstrated in the Psoriasis Symptom Diary© in 
patients treated with secukinumab compared to patients treated with ustekinumab. 
Statistically significant improvements (decreases) at week 12 from baseline in the scalp psoriasis study 
were demonstrated in patient reported signs and symptoms of scalp itching, pain and scaling compared 
to placebo. 
Plaque psoriasis dose flexibility 
A randomised, double-blind, multicentre study evaluated two maintenance dosing regimens (300 mg 
every 2 weeks [Q2W] and 300 mg every 4 weeks [Q4W]) administered by 150 mg pre-filled syringe 
in 331 patients weighing ≥90 kg with moderate to severe psoriasis. Patients were randomised 1:1 as 
follows: 
• 
secukinumab 300 mg at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by the same dose every 2 weeks 
(Q2W) up to week 52 (n=165). 
secukinumab 300 mg at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by the same dose every 4 weeks 
(Q4W) up to week 16 (n=166). 
o 
Patients randomised to receive secukinumab 300 mg Q4W who were PASI 90 responders 
at week 16 continued to receive the same dosing regimen up to week 52. Patients 
randomised to receive secukinumab 300 mg Q4W who were PASI 90 non-responders at 
week 16 either continued on the same dosing regimen, or were reassigned to receive 
secukinumab 300 mg Q2W up to week 52. 
• 
Overall, the efficacy response rates for the group treated with the every 2 weeks regimen were higher 
compared to the group treated with the every 4 weeks regimen (Table 7).

In the PASI 90 non-responders at week 16 who were up-titrated to secukinumab 300 mg Q2W, the 
PASI 90 response rates improved compared to those who remained on the secukinumab 300 mg Q4W 
dosing regimen, while the IGA mod 2011 0/1 response rates remained stable over time in both 
treatment groups. 
The safety profiles of the two dosing regimens, Cosentyx 300 mg administered every 4 weeks and 
Cosentyx 300 mg administered every 2 weeks, in patients weighing ≥90 kg were comparable and 
consistent with the safety profile reported in psoriasis patients.

Hidradenitis suppurativa 
The safety and efficacy of secukinumab were assessed in 1 084 patients in two randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III studies in adult patients with moderate to severe 
hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who were candidates for systemic biologic therapy. Patients were 
required to have at least five inflammatory lesions affecting at least two anatomical areas at baseline. 
In HS study 1 (SUNSHINE) and HS study 2 (SUNRISE), respectively, 4.6% and 2.8% of patients 
were Hurley stage I, 61.4% and 56.7% were Hurley stage II, and 34.0% and 40.5% were Hurley 
stage III.The proportion of patients weighing ≥90 kg was 54.7% in HS study 1 and 50.8% in HS 
study 2. Patients in these studies had a diagnosis of moderate to severe HS for a mean of 7.3 years and 
56.3% of the study participants were female. 
In HS study 1 and HS study 2, 23,8% and 23,2% of patients, respectively, were previously treated with 
a biologic. 82.3% and 83.6% of patients, respectively, were previously treated with systemic 
antibiotics. 
HS study 1 evaluated 541 patients and HS study 2 evaluated 543 patients, of whom 12.8% and 10.7%, 
respectively, received concomitant stable-dose antibiotics. In both studies, patients randomised to 
secukinumab received 300 mg subcutaneously at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by 300 mg every 
2 weeks (Q2W) or every 4 weeks (Q4W). At week 16, patients who were randomised to placebo were 
reassigned to receive secukinumab 300 mg at weeks 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 followed by either 
secukinumab 300 mg Q2W or secukinumab 300 mg Q4W. 
The primary endpoint in both studies (HS study 1 and HS study 2) was the proportion of patients 
achieving a Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response defined as at least a 50% decrease in 
abscesses and inflammatory nodules count with no increase in the number of abscesses and/or in the 
number of draining fistulae relative to baseline (HiSCR50) at week 16. Reduction in HS-related skin 
pain was assessed as a secondary endpoint on the pooled data of HS study 1 and HS study 2 using a 
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) in patients who entered the studies with an initial baseline score of 3 or 
greater. 
In HS study 1 and HS study 2, a higher proportion of patients treated with secukinumab 300 mg Q2W 
achieved a HiSCR50 response with a decrease in abscesses and inflammatory nodules (AN) count 
compared to placebo at week 16. In HS study 2, a difference in HiSCR50 response and AN count was 
also observed with the secukinumab 300 mg Q4W regimen. In the secukinumab 300 mg Q2W group 
in HS study 1 and in the secukinumab 300 mg Q4W group in HS study 2, a lower rate of patients 
experienced flares compared to placebo up to week 16. A higher proportion of patients treated with 
secukinumab 300 mg Q2W (pooled data) experienced a clinically relevant decrease in HS-related skin 
pain compared to placebo at week 16 (Table 8).

In both studies, the onset of action of secukinumab occurred as early as week 2, the efficacy 
progressively increased to week 16 and was maintained up to week 52. 
Improvements were seen for the primary and key secondary endpoints in HS patients regardless of 
previous or concomitant antibiotic treatment. 
HiSCR50 responses were improved at week 16 in both biologic-naïve and biologic-exposed patients. 
Greater improvements at week 16 from baseline compared to placebo were demonstrated in 
health-related quality of life as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
The safety and efficacy of secukinumab were assessed in 1 999 patients in three randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III studies in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (≥3 swollen 
and ≥3 tender joints) despite non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), corticosteroid or 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy. Patients with each subtype of PsA were 
enrolled in these studies, including polyarticular arthritis with no evidence of rheumatoid nodules, 
spondylitis with peripheral arthritis, asymmetric peripheral arthritis, distal interphalangeal 
involvement and arthritis mutilans. Patients in these studies had a diagnosis of PsA of at least five 
years. The majority of patients also had active psoriasis skin lesions or a documented history of 
psoriasis. Over 61% and 42% of the PsA patients had enthesitis and dactylitis at baseline, respectively. 
For all studies, the primary endpoint was American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response. For 
Psoriatic Arthritis study 1 (PsA study 1) and Psoriatic Arthritis study 2 (PsA study 2), the primary 
endpoint was at week 24. For Psoriatic Arthritis study 3 (PsA study 3), the primary endpoint was at 
week 16 with the key secondary endpoint, the change from baseline in modified Total Sharp Score 
(mTSS), at week 24. 
In PsA study 1, PsA study 2 and PsA study 3, 29%, 35% and 30% of patients, respectively, were 
previously treated with an anti-TNFα agent and discontinued the anti-TNFα agent for either lack of 
efficacy or intolerance (anti-TNFα-IR patients). 
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PsA study 1 (FUTURE 1) evaluated 606 patients, of whom 60.7% had concomitant MTX. Patients 
randomised to secukinumab received 10 mg/kg intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 4, followed by either 
75 mg or 150 mg subcutaneously every month starting at week 8. Patients randomised to placebo who 
were non-responders at week 16 (early rescue) and other placebo patients at week 24 were crossed 
over to receive secukinumab (either 75 mg or 150 mg subcutaneously) followed by the same dose 
every month. 
PsA study 2 (FUTURE 2) evaluated 397 patients, of whom 46.6% had concomitant MTX. Patients 
randomised to secukinumab received 75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg subcutaneously at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 
4, followed by the same dose every month. Patients randomised to receive placebo who were 
non-responders at week 16 (early rescue) were crossed over to receive secukinumab (either 150 mg or 
300 mg subcutaneously) at week 16 followed by the same dose every month. Patients randomised to 
receive placebo who were responders at week 16 were crossed over to receive secukinumab (either 
150 mg or 300 mg subcutaneously) at week 24 followed by the same dose every month. 
PsA study 3 (FUTURE 5) evaluated 996 patients, of whom 50.1% had concomitant MTX. Patients 
were randomised to receive secukinumab 150 mg, 300 mg or placebo subcutaneously at weeks 0, 1, 2, 
3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month, or a once monthly injection of secukinumab 150 mg 
(without loading). Patients randomised to receive placebo who were non-responders at week 16 (early 
rescue) were then crossed over to receive secukinumab (either 150 mg or 300 mg subcutaneously) at 
week 16 followed by the same dose every month. Patients randomised to receive placebo who were 
responders at week 16 were crossed over to receive secukinumab (either 150 mg or 300 mg 
subcutaneously) at week 24 followed by the same dose every month. 
Signs and symptoms 
Treatment with secukinumab resulted in significant improvement in measures of disease activity 
compared to placebo at weeks 16 and 24 (see Table 9).

Time (Weeks) 
Similar responses for primary and key secondary endpoints were seen in PsA patients regardless of 
whether they were on concomitant MTX treatment or not. In PsA study 2, at week 24, secukinumab-
treated patients with concomitant MTX use had a higher ACR 20 response (47.7% and 54.4% for 
150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, compared to placebo 20.0%) and ACR 50 response (31.8% and 
38.6% for 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, compared to placebo 8.0%). Secukinumab-treated 
patients without concomitant MTX use had a higher ACR 20 response (53.6% and 53.6% for 150 mg 
and 300 mg, respectively, compared to placebo 10.4%) and ACR 50 response (37.5% and 32.1% for 
150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, compared to placebo 6.3%). 
In PsA study 2, both anti-TNFα-naive and anti-TNFα-IR secukinumab-treated patients had a 
significantly higher ACR 20 response compared to placebo at week 24, with a slightly higher response 
in the anti-TNFα-naive group (anti-TNFα-naive: 64% and 58% for 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, 
compared to placebo 15.9%; anti-TNFα-IR: 30% and 46% for 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, 
compared to placebo 14.3%). In the anti-TNFα-IR patients subgroup, only the 300 mg dose showed 
significantly higher response rate for ACR 20 compared to placebo (p<0.05) and demonstrated clinical 
meaningful benefit over 150 mg on multiple secondary endpoints. Improvements in the PASI 75 
response were seen in both subgroups and the 300 mg dose showed statistically significant benefit in 
the anti-TNFα-IR patients. 
Improvements were shown in all components of the ACR scores, including patient assessment of pain. 
In PsA study 2, the proportion of patients achieving a modified PsA Response Criteria (PsARC) 
response was greater in the secukinumab-treated patients (59.0% and 61.0% for 150 mg and 300 mg, 
respectively) compared to placebo (26.5%) at week 24. 
In PsA study 1 and PsA study 2, efficacy was maintained up to week 104. In PsA study 2, among 
200 patients initially randomised to secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg, 178 (89%) patients were still 
on treatment at week 52. Of the 100 patients randomised to secukinumab 150 mg, 64, 39 and 20 had 
an ACR 20/50/70 response, respectively. Of the 100 patients randomised to secukinumab 300 mg, 64, 
44 and 24 had an ACR 20/50/70 response, respectively.

Radiographic response 
In PsA study 3, inhibition of progression of structural damage was assessed radiographically and 
expressed by the modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) and its components, the Erosion Score (ES) and 
the Joint Space Narrowing Score (JSN). Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet were obtained at 
baseline, week 16 and/or week 24 and scored independently by at least two readers who were blinded 
to treatment group and visit number. Secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg treatment significantly 
inhibited the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage compared with placebo treatment as 
measured by change from baseline in mTSS at week 24 (Table 10). 
Inhibition of progression of structural damage was also assessed in PsA study 1 at weeks 24 and 52, 
compared to baseline. Week 24 data are presented in Table 10.

In PsA study 1, inhibition of structural damage was maintained with secukinumab treatment up to 
week 52. 
In PsA study 3, the percentage of patients with no disease progression (defined as a change from 
baseline in mTSS of ≤0.5) from randomisation to week 24 was 80.3%, 88.5% and 73.6% for 
secukinumab 150 mg, 300 mg and placebo, respectively. An effect of inhibition of structural damage 
was observed in anti-TNFα-naïve and anti-TNFα-IR patients and in patients treated with and without 
concomitant MTX. 
In PsA study 1, the percentage of patients with no disease progression (defined as a change from 
baseline in mTSS of ≤0.5) from randomisation to week 24 was 82.3% in secukinumab 10 mg/kg 
intravenous load – 150 mg subcutaneous maintenance and 75.7% in placebo. The percentage of 
patients with no disease progression from week 24 to week 52 for secukinumab 10 mg/kg intravenous 
load – followed by 150 mg subcutaneous maintenance and for placebo patients who switched to 75 mg 
or 150 mg subcutaneous every 4 weeks at week 16 or week 24 was 85.7% and 86.8%, respectively. 
Axial manifestations in PsA 
A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (MAXIMISE) assessed the efficacy of 
secukinumab in 485 PsA patients with axial manifestations who were naive to biologic treatment and 
responded inadequately to NSAIDs. The primary variable of at least a 20% improvement in 
Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS 20) criteria at week 12 was met. 
Treatment with secukinumab 300 mg and 150 mg compared to placebo also resulted in greater 
improvement in signs and symptoms (including decreases from baseline in spinal pain) and 
improvement in physical function (see Table 11).

Physical function and health-related quality of life 
In PsA study 2 and PsA study 3, patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg (p=0.0555 and p<0.0001) 
and 300 mg (p=0.0040 and p<0.0001) showed improvement in physical function compared to patients 
treated with placebo as assessed by Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at 
week 24 and week 16, respectively. Improvements in HAQ-DI scores were seen regardless of previous 
anti-TNFα exposure. Similar responses were seen in PsA study 1. 
Secukinumab-treated patients reported significant improvements in health-related quality of life as 
measured by the Short Form-36 Health Survey Physical Component Summary (SF-36 PCS) score 
(p<0.001). There were also statistically significant improvements demonstrated in exploratory 
endpoints assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue (FACIT-F) 
scores for 150 mg and 300 mg compared to placebo (7.97, 5.97 versus 1.63, respectively) and these 
improvements were maintained up to week 104 in PsA study 2. 
Similar responses were seen in PsA study 1 and efficacy was maintained up to week 52. 
Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) 
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) / Radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
The safety and efficacy of secukinumab were assessed in 816 patients in three randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III studies in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) 
with a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥4 despite non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), corticosteroid or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) 
therapy. Patients in Ankylosing Spondylitis study 1 (AS study 1) and Ankylosing Spondylitis study 2 
(AS study 2) had a diagnosis of AS for a median of 2.7 to 5.8 years. For both studies, the primary 
endpoint was at least a 20% improvement in Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society 
(ASAS 20) criteria at week 16. 
In Ankylosing Spondylitis study 1 (AS study 1), Ankylosing Spondylitis study 2 (AS study 2), and 
Ankylosing Spondylitis study 3 (AS study 3), 27.0%, 38.8%, and 23.5% of patients, respectively, were 
previously treated with an anti-TNFα agent and discontinued the anti-TNFα agent for either lack of 
efficacy or intolerance (anti-TNFα-IR patients). 
79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AS study 1 (MEASURE 1) evaluated 371 patients, of whom 14.8% and 33.4% used concomitant 
MTX or sulfasalazine, respectively. Patients randomised to secukinumab received 10 mg/kg 
intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 4, followed by either 75 mg or 150 mg subcutaneously every month 
starting at week 8. Patients randomised to placebo who were non-responders at week 16 (early rescue) 
and all other placebo patients at week 24 were crossed over to receive secukinumab (either 75 mg or 
150 mg subcutaneously), followed by the same dose every month. 
AS study 2 (MEASURE 2) evaluated 219 patients, of whom 11.9% and 14.2% used concomitant 
MTX or sulfasalazine, respectively. Patients randomised to secukinumab received 75 mg or 150 mg 
subcutaneously at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month. At week 16, 
patients who were randomised to placebo at baseline were re-randomised to receive secukinumab 
(either 75 mg or 150 mg subcutaneously) every month. 
AS study 3 (MEASURE 3) evaluated 226 patients, of whom 13.3% and 23.5% used concomitant 
MTX or sulfasalazine, respectively. Patients randomised to secukinumab received 10 mg/kg 
intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 4, followed by either 150 mg or 300 mg subcutaneously every month. 
At week 16, patients who were randomised to placebo at baseline were re-randomised to receive 
secukinumab (either 150 mg or 300 mg subcutaneously) every month. The primary endpoint was 
ASAS 20 at week 16. Patients were blinded to the treatment regimen up to week 52, and the study 
continued to week 156. 
Signs and symptoms: 
In AS study 2, treatment with secukinumab 150 mg resulted in greater improvement in measures of 
disease activity compared with placebo at week 16 (see Table 12).

The onset of action of secukinumab 150 mg occurred as early as week 1 for ASAS 20 and week 2 for 
ASAS 40 (superior to placebo) in AS study 2. 
ASAS 20 responses were improved at week 16 in both anti-TNFα-naïve patients (68.2% versus 
31.1%; p<0.05) and anti-TNFα-IR patients (50.0% versus 24.1%; p<0.05) for secukinumab 150 mg 
compared with placebo, respectively.

In AS study 1 and AS study 2, secukinumab-treated patients (150 mg in AS study 2 and both regimens 
in AS study 1) demonstrated significantly improved signs and symptoms at week 16, with comparable 
magnitude of response and efficacy maintained up to week 52 in both anti-TNFα-naive and 
anti-TNFα-IR patients. In AS study 2, among 72 patients initially randomised to secukinumab 150 mg, 
61 (84.7%) patients were still on treatment at week 52. Of the 72 patients randomised to secukinumab 
150 mg, 45 and 35 had an ASAS 20/40 response, respectively. 
In AS study 3, patients treated with secukinumab (150 mg and 300 mg) demonstrated improved signs 
and symptoms, and had comparable efficacy responses regardless of dose that were superior to 
placebo at week 16 for the primary endpoint (ASAS 20). Overall, the efficacy response rates for the 
300 mg group were consistently greater compared to the 150 mg group for the secondary endpoints. 
During the blinded period, the ASAS 20 and ASAS 40 responses were 69.7% and 47.6% for 150 mg 
and 74.3% and 57.4% for 300 mg at week 52, respectively. The ASAS 20 and ASAS 40 responses 
were maintained up to week 156 (69.5% and 47.6% for 150 mg versus 74.8% and 55.6% for 300 mg). 
Greater response rates favouring 300 mg were also observed for ASAS partial remission (ASAS PR) 
response at week 16 and were maintained up to week 156. Larger differences in response rates, 
favouring 300 mg over 150 mg, were observed in anti-TNFα-IR patients (n=36) compared to 
anti-TNFα-naïve patients (n=114). 
Spinal mobility: 
Patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg showed improvements in spinal mobility as measured by 
change from baseline in BASMI at week 16 for both AS study 1 (-0.40 versus -0.12 for placebo; 
p=0.0114) and AS study 2 (-0.51 versus -0.22 for placebo; p=0.0533). These improvements were 
sustained up to week 52. 
Physical function and health-related quality of life: 
In AS study 1 and study 2, patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg showed improvements in health-
related quality of life as measured by AS Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL) (p=0.001) and SF-36 
Physical Component Summary (SF-36PCS) (p<0.001). Patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg also 
showed statistically significant improvements on exploratory endpoints in physical function as 
assessed by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) compared to placebo (-2.15 
versus -0.68), and in fatigue as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-
Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) scale compared to placebo (8.10 versus 3.30). These improvements were 
sustained up to week 52. 
Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) 
The safety and efficacy of secukinumab were assessed in 555 patients in one randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study (PREVENT), consisting of a 2-year core phase and a 
2-year extension phase, in patients with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) 
fulfilling the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) classification criteria for 
axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) with no radiographic evidence of changes in the sacroiliac joints that 
would meet the modified New York criteria for ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Patients enrolled had 
active disease, defined as a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥4, a 
Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for total back pain of ≥40 (on a scale of 0-100 mm), despite current or 
previous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy and increased C-reactive protein 
(CRP) and/or evidence of sacroiliitis on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Patients in this study 
had a diagnosis of axSpA for a mean of 2.1 to 3.0 years and 54% of the study participants were 
female. 
In the PREVENT study, 9.7% of patients were previously treated with an anti-TNFα agent and 
discontinued the anti-TNFα agent for either lack of efficacy or intolerance (anti-TNFα-IR patients). 
81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the PREVENT study, 9.9% and 14.8% of patients used concomitant MTX or sulfasalazine, 
respectively. In the double-blind period, patients received either placebo or secukinumab for 52 weeks. 
Patients randomised to secukinumab received 150 mg subcutaneously at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 
followed by the same dose every month, or a once monthly injection of secukinumab 150 mg. The 
primary endpoint was at least 40% improvement in Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International 
Society (ASAS 40) at Week 16 in anti-TNFα-naive patients. 
Signs and symptoms: 
In the PREVENT study, treatment with secukinumab 150 mg resulted in significant improvements in 
the measures of disease activity compared to placebo at week 16. These measures include ASAS 40, 
ASAS 5/6, BASDAI score, BASDAI 50, high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), ASAS 20 and ASAS partial 
remission response compared to placebo (Table 13). Responses were maintained up to week 52.

ASAS 40 responses were also improved at week 16 in anti-TNFα-IR patients for secukinumab 150 mg 
compared with placebo. 
Physical function and health-related quality of life: 
Patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg showed statistically significant improvements by week 16 
compared to placebo-treated patients in physical function as assessed by the BASFI (week 16: -1.75 
versus -1.01, p<0.05). Patients treated with secukinumab reported significant improvements compared 
to placebo-treated patients by week 16 in health-related quality of life as measured by ASQoL (LS 
mean change: week 16: -3.45 versus -1.84, p<0.05) and SF-36 Physical Component Summary (SF-36 
PCS) (LS mean change: week 16: 5.71 versus 2.93, p<0.05). These improvements were sustained up 
to week 52. 
Spinal mobility: 
Spinal mobility was assessed by BASMI up to week 16. Numerically greater improvements were 
demonstrated in patients treated with secukinumab compared with placebo-treated patients at weeks 4, 
8, 12 and 16. 
Inhibition of inflammation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): 
Signs of inflammation were assessed by MRI at baseline and week 16 and expressed as change from 
baseline in Berlin SI-joint oedema score for sacroiliac joints and ASspiMRI-a score and Berlin spine 
score for the spine. Inhibition of inflammatory signs in both sacroiliac joints and the spine was 
observed in patients treated with secukinumab. Mean change from baseline in Berlin SI-joint oedema 
score was -1.68 for patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg (n=180) versus -0.39 for the 
placebo-treated patients (n=174) (p<0.05).

Paediatric population 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Secukinumab has been shown to improve signs and symptoms, and health-related quality of life in 
paediatric patients 6 years and older with plaque psoriasis (see Tables 15 and 17). 
Severe plaque psoriasis 
The safety and efficacy of secukinumab were assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo and 
etanercept-controlled phase III study in paediatric patients from 6 to <18 years of age with severe 
plaque psoriasis, as defined by a PASI score ≥20, an IGA mod 2011 score of 4, and BSA involvement 
of ≥10%, who were candidates for systemic therapy. Approximately 43% of the patients had prior 
exposure to phototherapy, 53% to conventional systemic therapy, 3% to biologics, and 9% had 
concomitant psoriatic arthritis. 
The paediatric psoriasis study 1 evaluated 162 patients who were randomised to receive low dose 
secukinumab (75 mg for body weight <50 kg or 150 mg for body weight ≥50 kg), high dose 
secukinumab (75 mg for body weight <25 kg, 150 mg for body weight between ≥25 kg and <50 kg, or 
300 mg for body weight ≥50 kg), or placebo at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by the same dose 
every 4 weeks, or etanercept. Patients randomised to etanercept received 0.8 mg/kg weekly (up to a 
maximum of 50 mg). Patient distribution by weight and age at randomisation is described in Table 14.

Patients randomised to receive placebo who were non-responders at week 12 were switched to either 
the secukinumab low or high dose group (dose based on body weight group) and received study drug 
at weeks 12, 13, 14, and 15, followed by the same dose every 4 weeks starting at week 16. The co-
primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 response and IGA mod 
2011 ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (0 or 1) response at week 12. 
During the 12 week placebo-controlled period, the efficacy of both the low and the high dose of 
secukinumab was comparable for the co-primary endpoints. The odds ratio estimates in favour of both 
secukinumab doses were statistically significant for both the PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 
responses. 
All patients were followed for efficacy and safety during the 52 weeks following the first dose. The 
proportion of patients achieving PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (0 or 1) 
responses showed separation between secukinumab treatment groups and placebo at the first post-
baseline visit at week 4, the difference becoming more prominent at week 12. The response was 
maintained throughout the 52 week time period (see Table 15). Improvement in PASI 50, 90, 100 
responder rates and Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) scores of 0 or 1 were also 
maintained throughout the 52 week time period. 
In addition, PASI 75, IGA 0 or 1, PASI 90 response rates at weeks 12 and 52 for both secukinumab 
low and high dose groups were higher than the rates for patients treated with etanercept (see Table 15). 
84 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Beyond week 12, efficacy of both the low and the high dose of secukinumab was comparable although 
the efficacy of the high dose was higher for patients ≥50 kg. The safety profiles of the low dose and 
the high dose were comparable and consistent with the safety profile in adults.

A higher proportion of paediatric patients treated with secukinumab reported improvement in health-
related quality of life as measured by a CDLQI score of 0 or 1 compared to placebo at week 12 (low 
dose 44.7%, high dose 50%, placebo 15%). Over time up to and including week 52 both secukinumab 
dose groups were numerically higher than the etanercept group (low dose 60.6%, high dose 66.7%, 
etanercept 44.4%). 
Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis 
Secukinumab was predicted to be effective for the treatment of paediatric patients with moderate 
plaque psoriasis based on the demonstrated efficacy and exposure response relationship in adult 
patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, and the similarity of the disease course, 
pathophysiology, and drug effect in adult and paediatric patients at the same exposure levels. 
Moreover, the safety and efficacy of secukinumab was assessed in an open-label, two-arm, 
parallel-group, multicentre phase III study in paediatric patients from 6 to <18 years of age with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, as defined by a PASI score ≥12, an IGA mod 2011 score of ≥3, 
and BSA involvement of ≥10%, who were candidates for systemic therapy. 
The paediatric psoriasis study 2 evaluated 84 patients who were randomised to receive low dose 
secukinumab (75 mg for body weight <50 kg or 150 mg for body weight ≥50 kg) or high dose 
secukinumab (75 mg for body weight <25 kg, 150 mg for body weight between ≥25 kg and <50 kg, or 
300 mg for body weight ≥50 kg) at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by the same dose every 4 weeks. 
Patient distribution by weight and age at randomisation is described in Table 16.

The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 response and IGA 
mod 2011 ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (0 or 1) response at week 12. 
The efficacy of both the low and the high dose of secukinumab was comparable and showed 
statistically significant improvement compared to historical placebo for the co-primary endpoints. The 
estimated posterior probability of a positive treatment effect was 100%. 
Patients were followed for efficacy over a 52 week period after first administration. Efficacy (defined 
as PASI 75 response and IGA mod 2011 ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ [0 or 1]) was observed as early as the 
first post-baseline visit at week 2, and the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 response and 
IGA mod 2011 ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (0 or 1) increased up to week 24 and were sustained until 
week 52. Improvement in PASI 90 and PASI 100 were also observed at week 12, increased up to 
week 24, and were sustained until week 52 (see Table 17). 
The safety profiles of the low dose and the high dose were comparable and consistent with the safety 
profile in adults.

These outcomes in the paediatric moderate to severe plaque psoriasis population confirmed the 
predictive assumptions based on the efficacy and exposure response relationship in adult patients, 
mentioned above. 
In the low dose group, 50% and 70.7% of patients achieved a CDLQI 0 or 1 score at weeks 12 and 52, 
respectively. In the high dose group, 61.9% and 70.3% achieved a CDLQI 0 or 1 score at weeks 12 
and 52, respectively.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) 
Enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) and juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) 
The efficacy and safety of secukinumab were assessed in 86 patients in a 3-part, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, event-driven, randomised, phase III study in patients 2 to <18 years of age with 
active ERA or JPsA as diagnosed based on a modified International League of Associations for 
Rheumatology (ILAR) JIA classification criteria. The study consisted of an open-label portion (Part 1) 
where all patients received secukinumab until week 12. Patients demonstrating a JIA ACR 30 
response at week 12 entered into the Part 2 double-blind phase and were randomised 1:1 to continue 
treatment with secukinumab or to begin treatment with placebo (randomised withdrawal) until 
week 104 or until a flare occured. Patients who flared then entered open-label secukinumab treatment 
until week 104 (Part 3). 
The JIA patient subtypes at study entry were: 60.5% ERA and 39.5% JPsA, who either had inadequate 
response or were intolerant to ≥1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and ≥1 non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). At baseline, MTX use was reported for 65.1% of 
patients; (63.5% [33/52] of ERA patients and 67.6% [23/34] of JPsA patients). There were 12 out of 
52 ERA patients concomitantly treated with sulfasalazine (23.1%). Patients with a body weight at 
baseline <50 kg (n=30) were given a dose of 75 mg and patients with a body weight ≥50 kg (n=56) 
were given a dose of 150 mg. Age at baseline ranged from 2 to 17 years, with 3 patients between 2 to 
<6 years, 22 patients 6 to <12 years and 61 patients 12 to <18 years. At baseline the Juvenile Arthritis 
Disease Activity Score (JADAS)-27 was 15.1 (SD:7.1). 
The primary endpoint was time to flare in the randomised withdrawal period (Part 2). Disease flare 
was defined as a ≥30% worsening in at least three of the six JIA ACR response criteria and ≥30% 
improvement in not more than one of the six JIA ACR response criteria and a minimum of two active 
joints. 
At the end of Part 1, 75 out of 86 (87.2%) patients demonstrated a JIA ACR 30 response and entered 
into Part 2. 
The study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant prolongation in the time 
to disease flare in patients treated with secukinumab compared to placebo in Part 2. The risk of flare 
was reduced by 72% for patients on secukinumab compared with patients on placebo in Part 2 (Hazard 
ratio=0.28, 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.63, p<0.001) (Figure 4 and Table 18). During Part 2, a total of 
21 patients in the placebo group experienced a flare event (11 JPsA and 10 ERA) compared with 
10 patients in the secukinumab group (4 JPsA and 6 ERA).

In open-label Part 1, all patients received secukinumab until week 12. At week 12, 83.7%, 67.4%, and 
38.4% of children were JIA ACR 50, 70 and 90 responders, respectively (Figure 5). The onset of 
action of secukinumab occurred as early as week 1. At week 12 the JADAS-27 score was 4.64 
(SD:4.73) and the mean decrease from baseline in JADAS-27 was -10.487 (SD:7.23).

The data in the 2 to <6 age group were inconclusive due to the low number of patients below 6 years 
of age enrolled in the study. 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Cosentyx in plaque psoriasis in paediatric patients aged from birth to less than 6 years and in chronic 
idiopathic arthritis for paediatric patients aged from birth to less than 2 years (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Most pharmacokinetics properties observed in patients with plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and 
ankylosing spondylitis were similar. 
Absorption 
Following a single subcutaneous dose of 300 mg as a liquid formulation in healthy volunteers, 
secukinumab reached peak serum concentrations of 43.2±10.4 μg/ml between 2 and 14 days post dose. 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following a single subcutaneous dose of either 150 mg 
or 300 mg in plaque psoriasis patients, secukinumab reached peak serum concentrations of 
13.7±4.8 µg/ml or 27.3±9.5 µg/ml, respectively, between 5 and 6 days post dose. 
After initial weekly dosing during the first month, time to reach the maximum concentration was 
between 31 and 34 days based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
On the basis of simulated data, peak concentrations at steady-state (Cmax,ss) following subcutaneous 
administration of 150 mg or 300 mg were 27.6 µg/ml and 55.2 µg/ml, respectively. Population 
pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that steady-state is reached after 20 weeks with monthly dosing 
regimens. 
Compared with exposure after a single dose, the population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that 
patients exhibited a 2-fold increase in peak serum concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) 
following repeated monthly dosing during maintenance. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that secukinumab was absorbed with an average absolute 
bioavailability of 73% in patients with plaque psoriasis. Across studies, absolute bioavailabilities in 
the range between 60 and 77% were calculated. 
The bioavailability of secukinumab in PsA patients was 85% on the basis of the population 
pharmacokinetic model. 
Following subcutaneous administration of 300 mg at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 followed by 300 mg every 
2 weeks, the mean ± SD steady-state secukinumab trough concentration at week 16 was approximately 
55.1±26.7 µg/ml and 58.1±30.1 µg/ml in HS study 1 and HS study 2, respectively. 
Distribution 
The mean volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz) following single intravenous 
administration ranged from 7.10 to 8.60 litres in plaque psoriasis patients, suggesting that 
secukinumab undergoes limited distribution to peripheral compartments. 
Biotransformation 
The majority of IgG elimination occurs via intracellular catabolism, following fluid-phase or receptor 
mediated endocytosis. 
Elimination 
Mean systemic clearance (CL) following a single intravenous administration to patients with plaque 
psoriasis ranged from 0.13 to 0.36 l/day. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the mean systemic 
clearance (CL) was 0.19 l/day in plaque psoriasis patients. The CL was not impacted by gender. 
Clearance was dose- and time-independent. 
89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The mean elimination half-life, as estimated from population pharmacokinetic analysis, was 27 days in 
plaque psoriasis patients, ranging from 18 to 46 days across psoriasis studies with intravenous 
administration. 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the mean systemic CL following subcutaneous 
administration of 300 mg at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by 300 mg every 2 weeks to patients with 
hidradenitis suppurativa was 0.26 l/day. 
The mean elimination half-life, as estimated from population pharmacokinetic analysis, was 23 days in 
hidradenitis suppurativa patients. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of secukinumab in plaque psoriasis patients were 
determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 1x 0.3 mg/kg to 3x 10 mg/kg and 
with subcutaneous doses ranging from 1x 25 mg to multiple doses of 300 mg. Exposure was dose 
proportional across all dosing regimens. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis with a limited number of elderly patients (n=71 for age 
≥65 years and n=7 for age ≥75 years), clearance in elderly patients and patients less than 65 years of 
age was similar. 
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. The renal 
elimination of intact secukinumab, an IgG monoclonal antibody, is expected to be low and of minor 
importance. IgGs are mainly eliminated via catabolism and hepatic impairment is not expected to 
influence clearance of secukinumab. 
Effect of weight on pharmacokinetics 
Secukinumab clearance and volume of distribution increase as body weight increases. 
Paediatric population 
Plaque psoriasis 
In a pool of the two paediatric studies, patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (6 to less than 
18 years of age) were administered secukinumab at the recommended paediatric dosing regimen. At 
week 24, patients weighing ≥25 and <50 kg had a mean ± SD steady-state trough concentration of 
19.8 ± 6.96 µg/ml (n=24) after 75 mg of secukinumab and patients weighing ≥50 kg had mean ±SD 
trough concentration of 27.3 ± 10.1 µg/ml (n=36) after 150 mg of secukinumab. The mean ± SD 
steady-state trough concentration in patients weighing <25 kg (n=8) was 32.6 ± 10.8 µg/ml at week 24 
after 75 mg dose. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
In a paediatric study, ERA and JPsA patients (2 to less than 18 years of age) were administered 
secukinumab at the recommended paediatric dosing regimen. At week 24, patients weighing <50 kg, 
and weighing ≥50 kg had a mean ± SD steady-state trough concentration of 25.2±5.45 µg/ml (n=10) 
and 27.9±9.57 µg/ml (n=19), respectively. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans (adult or paediatric) based on conventional 
studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose and reproductive toxicity, or tissue cross-reactivity. 
Animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of secukinumab.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
The single-use vial contains 150 mg secukinumab for reconstitution with sterile water for injections. 
The resulting solution should be clear and colourless to slightly yellow. Do not use if the lyophilised 
powder has not fully dissolved or if the liquid contains easily visible particles, is cloudy or is distinctly 
brown. 
Reconstitution 
Cosentyx 150 mg powder for solution for injection must be prepared by a healthcare professional. The 
preparation of the solution for subcutaneous injection must be done without interruption and ensuring 
that aseptic technique is used. The preparation time from piercing the stopper until end of 
reconstitution takes 20 minutes on average and should not exceed 90 minutes. 
1. 
Bring the vial of powder to room temperature and ensure that the sterile water for injections is at 
room temperature. 
2.  Withdraw slightly more than 1.0 ml sterile water for injections into a 1 ml graduated disposable 
syringe and adjust to 1.0 ml. 
Remove the plastic cap from the vial. 
Insert the syringe needle into the vial containing the powder through the centre of the rubber 
stopper and reconstitute the powder by slowly injecting 1.0 ml of sterile water for injections into 
the vial. The stream of sterile water for injections should be directed onto the powder. 
Tilt the vial to an angle of approx. 45° and gently rotate between the fingertips for approx. 
1 minute. Do not shake or invert the vial. 
Keep the vial standing at room temperature for a minimum of 10 minutes to allow for 
dissolution. Note that foaming of the solution may occur. 
Tilt the vial to an angle of approx. 45° and gently rotate between the fingertips for approx. 
1 minute. Do not shake or invert the vial. 
Allow the vial to stand undisturbed at room temperature for approximately 5 minutes. The 
resulting solution should be clear. Its colour may vary from colourless to slightly yellow. Do not 
use if the lyophilised powder has not fully dissolved or if the liquid contains easily visible 
particles, is cloudy or is distinctly brown. 
Prepare the required number of vials (2 vials for the 300 mg dose).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Cosentyx is and what it is used for 
Cosentyx contains the active substance secukinumab. Secukinumab is a monoclonal antibody which 
belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine works by neutralising 
the activity of a protein called IL-17A, which is present at increased levels in diseases such as 
psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis. 
Cosentyx is used for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: 
• 
• 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Cosentyx is used to treat a skin condition called “plaque psoriasis”, which causes inflammation 
affecting the skin. Cosentyx reduces the inflammation and other symptoms of the disease. Cosentyx is 
used in adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. 
Using Cosentyx in plaque psoriasis will benefit you (or your child) by leading to improvements of skin 
clearance and reducing symptoms such as scaling, itching and pain. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis 
Cosentyx is used in patients (6 years of age and older) to treat conditions of the juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis categories called “enthesitis-related arthritis” and “juvenile psoriatic arthritis”. These 
conditions are inflammatory diseases affecting the joints and the places where tendons join the bone. 
Using Cosentyx in enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis will benefit you (or your 
child) by reducing the symptoms and improving your (or your child’s) physical function. 
141 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you (or your child) use Cosentyx 
Do not use Cosentyx: 
• 
if you (or your child) are allergic to secukinumab or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you think you (or your child) may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice before using 
Cosentyx. 
if you (or your child) have an active infection which your doctor thinks is important. 
• 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before using Cosentyx: 
• 
if you (or your child) currently have an infection.

• 
if you (or your child) have ever had an allergic reaction to latex. 
• 
if you (or your child) have an inflammatory disease affecting the gut called Crohn’s disease. 
• 
if you (or your child) have an inflammation of the large intestine called ulcerative colitis. 
• 
if you (or your child) have recently had a vaccination or are due to have a vaccination during 
treatment with Cosentyx. 
if you (or your child) are receiving any other treatment for psoriasis, such as another 
immunosuppressant or phototherapy with ultraviolet (UV) light. 
• 
Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis) 
Stop using Cosentyx and tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you (or your child) 
notice abdominal cramps and pain, diarrhoea, weight loss, blood in the stool or any other signs of 
bowel problems.

must look out for signs of these conditions while you (or your child) are taking Cosentyx.

notice any signs indicating a possible serious infection or an allergic reaction. Such signs are listed

may also use the lower abdomen, but not the area 
5 centimetres around the navel (belly button).  
•  Choose a different site each time you give yourself an 
injection. 
•  Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, 
bruised, red, scaly or hard. Avoid areas with scars or 
stretch marks. 
If a caregiver is giving you the injection, the outer upper 
arms may also be used.

How to use the Cosentyx 75 mg pre-filled syringe 
Carefully remove the needle cap from the 
syringe by holding the syringe guard body. 
Discard the needle cap. You may see a drop of 
liquid at the end of the needle. This is normal. 
Gently pinch the skin at the injection site and 
insert the needle as shown. Push the needle all 
the way in at an angle of approximately 
45 degrees to ensure that the medicine can be 
fully administered. 
Hold the syringe as shown. Slowly depress the 
plunger as far as it will go so that the plunger 
head is completely between the syringe guard 
wings. 
Keep the plunger pressed fully down while you 
hold the syringe in place for 5 seconds. 
Keep the plunger fully depressed while you 
carefully lift the needle straight out from the 
injection site. 
Slowly release the plunger and allow the syringe 
guard to automatically cover the exposed needle. 
There may be a small amount of blood at the 
injection site. You can press a cotton ball or 
gauze over the injection site and hold it for 
10 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. You 
may cover the injection site with a small 
adhesive bandage, if needed.

Disposal instructions 
Dispose of the used syringe in a sharps container 
(closable, puncture resistant container). For the 
safety and health of you and others, needles and 
used syringes must never be re-used.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Cosentyx is and what it is used for 
Cosentyx contains the active substance secukinumab. Secukinumab is a monoclonal antibody which 
belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine works by neutralising 
the activity of a protein called IL-17A, which is present at increased levels in diseases such as 
psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis. 
Cosentyx is used for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Plaque psoriasis 
Hidradenitis suppurativa 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) 
and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis 
• 
Plaque psoriasis 
Cosentyx is used to treat a skin condition called “plaque psoriasis”, which causes inflammation 
affecting the skin. Cosentyx reduces the inflammation and other symptoms of the disease. Cosentyx is 
used in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis. 
Using Cosentyx in plaque psoriasis will benefit you by leading to improvements of skin clearance and 
reducing your symptoms such as scaling, itching and pain. 
Hidradenitis suppurativa 
Cosentyx is used to treat a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa, also sometimes called acne 
inversa or Verneuil’s disease. This condition is a chronic and painful inflammatory skin disease. 
Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. It commonly 
affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, groin and 
buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. 
153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cosentyx can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have and the pain that is often 
associated with the disease. If you have hidradenitis suppurativa you will first be given other 
medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Cosentyx. 
Cosentyx is used in adults with hidradenitis suppurativa and can be used alone or with antibiotics. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Cosentyx is used to treat a condition called “psoriatic arthritis”. The condition is an inflammatory 
disease of the joints, often accompanied by psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first 
be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given 
Cosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis, improve physical function and 
slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints involved in the disease. 
Cosentyx is used in adults with active psoriatic arthritis and can be used alone or with another 
medicine called methotrexate. 
Using Cosentyx in psoriatic arthritis will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the 
disease, slowing down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints and improving your ability to 
do normal daily activities. 
Axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) 
and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Cosentyx is used to treat conditions called “ankylosing spondylitis” and “non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis”. These conditions are inflammatory diseases primarily affecting the spine which 
cause inflammation of the spinal joints. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these 
medicines, you will be given Cosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease, reduce 
inflammation and improve your physical function. 
Cosentyx is used in adults with active ankylosing spondylitis and active non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis. 
Using Cosentyx in ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis will benefit 
you by reducing the signs and symptoms of your disease and improving your physical function. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis 
Cosentyx is used in patients (6 years of age and older) to treat conditions of the juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis categories called “enthesitis-related arthritis” and “juvenile psoriatic arthritis”. These 
conditions are inflammatory diseases affecting the joints and the places where tendons join the bone. 
Using Cosentyx in enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis will benefit you (or your 
child) by reducing the symptoms and improving your (or your child’s) physical function.

The injection site 
The injection site is the place on the body where you are 
going to use the syringe. 
•  The recommended site is the front of your thighs. You 
may also use the lower abdomen, but not the area 
5 centimetres around the navel (belly button).  
•  Choose a different site each time you give yourself an 
injection.

bruised, red, scaly or hard. Avoid areas with scars or 
stretch marks. 
If a caregiver is giving you the injection, the outer upper 
arms may also be used. 
Preparing the Cosentyx 150 mg pre-filled syringe ready for use

How to use the Cosentyx 150 mg pre-filled syringe 
Carefully remove the needle cap from the 
syringe by holding the syringe guard body. 
Discard the needle cap. You may see a drop of 
liquid at the end of the needle. This is normal. 
163 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gently pinch the skin at the injection site and 
insert the needle as shown. Push the needle all 
the way in to ensure that the medicine can be 
fully administered. 
Hold the syringe as shown. Slowly depress the 
plunger as far as it will go so that the plunger 
head is completely between the syringe guard 
wings. 
Keep the plunger pressed fully down while you 
hold the syringe in place for 5 seconds. 
Keep the plunger fully depressed while you 
carefully lift the needle straight out from the 
injection site. 
Slowly release the plunger and allow the syringe 
guard to automatically cover the exposed needle. 
There may be a small amount of blood at the 
injection site. You can press a cotton ball or 
gauze over the injection site and hold it for 
10 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. You 
may cover the injection site with a small 
adhesive bandage, if needed. 
Dispose of the used syringe in a sharps container 
(closable, puncture resistant container). For the 
safety and health of you and others, needles and 
used syringes must never be re-used.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Cosentyx is and what it is used for 
Cosentyx contains the active substance secukinumab. Secukinumab is a monoclonal antibody which 
belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine works by neutralising 
the activity of a protein called IL-17A, which is present at increased levels in diseases such as 
psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis. 
Cosentyx is used for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Plaque psoriasis 
Hidradenitis suppurativa 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) 
and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis 
• 
Plaque psoriasis 
Cosentyx is used to treat a skin condition called “plaque psoriasis”, which causes inflammation 
affecting the skin. Cosentyx reduces the inflammation and other symptoms of the disease. Cosentyx is 
used in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis. 
Using Cosentyx in plaque psoriasis will benefit you by leading to improvements of skin clearance and 
reducing your symptoms such as scaling, itching and pain. 
Hidradenitis suppurativa 
Cosentyx is used to treat a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa, also sometimes called acne 
inversa or Verneuil’s disease. This condition is a chronic and painful inflammatory skin disease. 
Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. It commonly 
affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, groin and 
buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. 
165 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cosentyx can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have and the pain that is often 
associated with the disease. If you have hidradenitis suppurativa you will first be given other 
medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Cosentyx. 
Cosentyx is used in adults with hidradenitis suppurativa and can be used alone or with antibiotics. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Cosentyx is used to treat a condition called “psoriatic arthritis”. The condition is an inflammatory 
disease of the joints, often accompanied by psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first 
be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given 
Cosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis, improve physical function and 
slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints involved in the disease. 
Cosentyx is used in adults with active psoriatic arthritis and can be used alone or with another 
medicine called methotrexate. 
Using Cosentyx in psoriatic arthritis will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the 
disease, slowing down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints and improving your ability to 
do normal daily activities. 
Axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) 
and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Cosentyx is used to treat conditions called “ankylosing spondylitis” and “non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis”. These conditions are inflammatory diseases primarily affecting the spine which 
cause inflammation of the spinal joints. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these 
medicines, you will be given Cosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease, reduce 
inflammation and improve your physical function. 
Cosentyx is used in adults with active ankylosing spondylitis and active non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis. 
Using Cosentyx in ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis will benefit 
you by reducing the signs and symptoms of your disease and improving your physical function. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis 
Cosentyx is used in patients (6 years of age and older) to treat conditions of the juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis categories called “enthesitis-related arthritis” and “juvenile psoriatic arthritis”. These 
conditions are inflammatory diseases affecting the joints and the places where tendons join the bone. 
Using Cosentyx in enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis will benefit you (or your 
child) by reducing the symptoms and improving your (or your child’s) physical function.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Cosentyx is and what it is used for 
Cosentyx contains the active substance secukinumab. Secukinumab is a monoclonal antibody which 
belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine works by neutralising 
the activity of a protein called IL-17A, which is present at increased levels in diseases such as 
psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis. 
Cosentyx is used for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Plaque psoriasis 
Hidradenitis suppurativa 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) 
and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Plaque psoriasis 
Cosentyx is used to treat a skin condition called “plaque psoriasis”, which causes inflammation 
affecting the skin. Cosentyx reduces the inflammation and other symptoms of the disease. Cosentyx is 
used in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis. 
Using Cosentyx in plaque psoriasis will benefit you by leading to improvements of skin clearance and 
reducing your symptoms such as scaling, itching and pain. 
Hidradenitis suppurativa 
Cosentyx is used to treat a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa, also sometimes called acne 
inversa or Verneuil’s disease. This condition is a chronic and painful inflammatory skin disease. 
Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. It commonly 
affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, groin and 
buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. 
Cosentyx can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have and the pain that is often 
associated with the disease. If you have hidradenitis suppurativa you will first be given other 
medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Cosentyx. 
178 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cosentyx isused in adults with hidradenitis suppurativa and can be used alone or with antibiotics. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Cosentyx is used to treat a condition called “psoriatic arthritis”. The condition is an inflammatory 
disease of the joints, often accompanied by psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first 
be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given 
Cosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis, improve physical function and 
slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints involved in the disease. 
Cosentyx is used in adults with active psoriatic arthritis and can be used alone or with another 
medicine called methotrexate. 
Using Cosentyx in psoriatic arthritis will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the 
disease, slowing down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints and improving your ability to 
do normal daily activities. 
Axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) 
and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Cosentyx is used to treat conditions called “ankylosing spondylitis” and “non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis”. These conditions are inflammatory diseases primarily affecting the spine which 
cause inflammation of the spinal joints. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these 
medicines, you will be given Cosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease, reduce 
inflammation and improve your physical function. 
Cosentyx is used in adults with active ankylosing spondylitis and active non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis. 
Using Cosentyx in ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis will benefit 
you by reducing the signs and symptoms of your disease and improving your physical function.

The injection site is the place on the body where you are 
going to use the syringe. 
•  The recommended site is the front of your thighs. You 
may also use the lower abdomen, but not the area 
5 centimetres around the navel (belly button). 
•  Choose a different site each time you give yourself an 
injection. 
•  Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, 
bruised, red, scaly or hard. Avoid areas with scars or 
stretch marks. 
If a caregiver is giving you the injection, the outer upper 
arms may also be used. 
Preparing the Cosentyx 300 mg pre-filled syringe ready for use 
1. 
Take the box containing the syringe out of the refrigerator and leave it unopened for about 
30-45 minutes so that it reaches room temperature. 
2.  When you are ready to use the syringe, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. 
3. 
4. 
Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab. 
Remove the syringe from the outer box and take it out of the blister by holding the syringe 
guard body. 
Inspect the syringe. The liquid should be clear. Its colour may vary from colourless to slightly 
yellow. You may see a small air bubble, which is normal. DO NOT USE if the liquid contains 
easily visible particles, is cloudy or is distinctly brown. DO NOT USE if the syringe is broken. 
In all these cases, return the entire product pack to the pharmacy. 
5. 
How to use the Cosentyx 300 mg pre-filled syringe 
Carefully remove the needle cap from the 
syringe by holding the syringe guard body. 
Discard the needle cap. You may see a drop of 
liquid at the end of the needle. This is normal. 
188 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gently pinch the skin at the injection site and 
insert the needle as shown. Push the needle all 
the way in to ensure that the medicine can be 
fully administered. 
Hold the syringe as shown. Slowly depress the 
plunger as far as it will go so that the plunger 
head is completely between the syringe guard 
wings. 
Keep the plunger pressed fully down while you 
hold the syringe in place for 5 seconds. 
Keep the plunger fully depressed while you 
carefully lift the needle straight out from the 
injection site. 
Slowly release the plunger and allow the syringe 
guard to automatically cover the exposed needle. 
There may be a small amount of blood at the 
injection site. You can press a cotton ball or 
gauze over the injection site and hold it for 
10 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. You 
may cover the injection site with a small 
adhesive bandage, if needed. 
189 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Disposal instructions 
Dispose of the used syringe in a sharps container 
(closable, puncture resistant container). For the 
safety and health of you and others, needles and 
used syringes must never be re-used.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Cosentyx is and what it is used for 
Cosentyx contains the active substance secukinumab. Secukinumab is a monoclonal antibody which 
belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine works by neutralising 
the activity of a protein called IL-17A, which is present at increased levels in diseases such as 
psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis. 
Cosentyx is used for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Plaque psoriasis 
Hidradenitis suppurativa 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) 
and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Plaque psoriasis 
Cosentyx is used to treat a skin condition called “plaque psoriasis”, which causes inflammation 
affecting the skin. Cosentyx reduces the inflammation and other symptoms of the disease. Cosentyx is 
used in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis. 
Using Cosentyx in plaque psoriasis will benefit you by leading to improvements of skin clearance and 
reducing your symptoms such as scaling, itching and pain. 
Hidradenitis suppurativa 
Cosentyx is used to treat a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa, also sometimes called acne 
inversa or Verneuil’s disease. This condition is a chronic and painful inflammatory skin disease. 
Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. It commonly 
affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, groin and 
buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. 
Cosentyx can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have and the pain that is often 
associated with the disease. If you have hidradenitis suppurativa you will first be given other 
medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Cosentyx. 
191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cosentyx isused in adults with hidradenitis suppurativa and can be used alone or with antibiotics. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Cosentyx is used to treat a condition called “psoriatic arthritis”. The condition is an inflammatory 
disease of the joints, often accompanied by psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first 
be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given 
Cosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis, improve physical function and 
slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints involved in the disease. 
Cosentyx is used in adults with active psoriatic arthritis and can be used alone or with another 
medicine called methotrexate. 
Using Cosentyx in psoriatic arthritis will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the 
disease, slowing down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints and improving your ability to 
do normal daily activities. 
Axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) 
and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Cosentyx is used to treat conditions called “ankylosing spondylitis” and “non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis”. These conditions are inflammatory diseases primarily affecting the spine which 
cause inflammation of the spinal joints. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these 
medicines, you will be given Cosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease, reduce 
inflammation and improve your physical function. 
Cosentyx is used in adults with active ankylosing spondylitis and active non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis. 
Using Cosentyx in ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis will benefit 
you by reducing the signs and symptoms of your disease and improving your physical function.

Do not use if the liquid contains easily visible particles, is 
cloudy or is distinctly brown. You may see a small air 
bubble, which is normal.

Contact your pharmacist if the pen fails any of these 
checks. 
2a. Choose your injection site:

5 centimetres around the navel (belly button). 
•  Choose a different site each time you give yourself an 
injection. 
•  Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, 
bruised, red, scaly or hard. Avoid areas with scars or 
stretch marks. 
2b. Caregivers and healthcare professionals only: 
• 
If a caregiver or healthcare professional is giving you 
your injection, they may also inject into your outer 
upper arm. 
3. Cleaning your injection site: 
•  Wash your hands with soap and hot water. 
•  Using a circular motion, clean the injection site with

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Cosentyx is and what it is used for 
Cosentyx contains the active substance secukinumab. Secukinumab is a monoclonal antibody which 
belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine works by neutralising 
the activity of a protein called IL-17A, which is present at increased levels in diseases such as 
psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis. 
Cosentyx is used for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Plaque psoriasis 
Hidradenitis suppurativa 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) 
and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis 
• 
Plaque psoriasis 
Cosentyx is used to treat a skin condition called “plaque psoriasis”, which causes inflammation 
affecting the skin. Cosentyx reduces the inflammation and other symptoms of the disease. Cosentyx is 
used in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis. 
Using Cosentyx in plaque psoriasis will benefit you by leading to improvements of skin clearance and 
reducing your symptoms such as scaling, itching and pain. 
Hidradenitis suppurativa 
Cosentyx is used to treat a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa, also sometimes called acne 
inversa or Verneuil’s disease. This condition is a chronic and painful inflammatory skin disease. 
Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. It commonly 
affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, groin and 
buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. 
204 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cosentyx can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have and the pain that is often 
associated with the disease. If you have hidradenitis suppurativa you will first be given other 
medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Cosentyx. 
Cosentyx isused in adults with hidradenitis suppurativa and can be used alone or with antibiotics. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Cosentyx is used to treat a condition called “psoriatic arthritis”. The condition is an inflammatory 
disease of the joints, often accompanied by psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first 
be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given 
Cosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis, improve physical function and 
slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints involved in the disease. 
Cosentyx is used in adults with active psoriatic arthritis and can be used alone or with another 
medicine called methotrexate. 
Using Cosentyx in psoriatic arthritis will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the 
disease, slowing down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints and improving your ability to 
do normal daily activities. 
Axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) 
and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Cosentyx is used to treat conditions called “ankylosing spondylitis” and “non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis”. These conditions are inflammatory diseases primarily affecting the spine which 
cause inflammation of the spinal joints. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these 
medicines, you will be given Cosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease, reduce 
inflammation and improve your physical function. 
Cosentyx is used in adults with active ankylosing spondylitis and active non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis. 
Using Cosentyx in ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis will benefit 
you by reducing the signs and symptoms of your disease and improving your physical function. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis 
Cosentyx is used in patients (6 years of age and older) to treat conditions of the juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis categories called “enthesitis-related arthritis” and “juvenile psoriatic arthritis”. These 
conditions are inflammatory diseases affecting the joints and the places where tendons join the bone. 
Using Cosentyx in enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis will benefit you (or your 
child) by reducing the symptoms and improving your (or your child’s) physical function.

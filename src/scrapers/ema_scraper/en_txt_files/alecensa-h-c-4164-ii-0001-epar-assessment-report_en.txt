2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
12 October 2017 
NSCLC is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and represents a major health 
problem.  There are approximately 214,000 cases of NSCLC and 168,000 deaths per year in the United 
States (US), and 449,000 cases and 388,000 deaths per year in the European Union (EU) [GLOBOCAN 
2012]. Survival rates for lung cancer tend to be much lower than for other common cancers, as a 
result of late diagnosis and limited effective therapies in advanced stages of the disease. The expected 
5 year survival rate for all lung cancer patients in the US is only 18%, compared with 66% for colon 
cancer, 91% for breast cancer, and 99% for prostate cancer [Siegel et al 2016]. 
Approximately 5% of NSCLC cases have been shown to harbour the EML4 ALK fusion gene [Barlesi et 
al 2016] as a result of a chromosomal inversion at 2p21 and 2p23 [Choi et al 2010, Ou et al 2012]. 
The resulting ALK fusion protein results in activation and dysregulation of the gene’s expression and 
signalling, which can contribute to increased cell proliferation and survival in tumours expressing these 
genes. Patients with ‘ALK positive’ tumours tend to have specific clinical features, including never or 
light smoking history, high frequencies in females, younger age, adenocarcinoma histology, and are 
sensitive to therapy with ALK inhibitors [Gridelli et al 2014].  ALK positive NSCLC patients can develop 
resistance and progression of disease particularly in the CNS resulting in poor prognosis. 
Current First Line Treatment Options for ALK Positive NSCLC  
Crizotinib is the current standard of care, and chemotherapy is also available as a first line treatment 
option for ALK positive NSCLC [ESMO guidelines 2016 and NCCN guidelines 2016]. Crizotinib  and 
ceritinib are the only EU approved ALK inhibitors for the first line treatment of ALK positive NSCLC. The 
PROFILE 1014 study, a Phase III study of crizotinib compared with standard pemetrexed platinum 
based chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with ALK positive non squamous NSCLC 
Assessment report

demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS (primary endpoint) with HR of 0.45 (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: [0.35, 0.60]; p < 0.001) and medians of 10.9 and 7.0 months for crizotinib and platinum 
based chemotherapy, respectively [Solomon BJ et al 2014]. The TT was significantly higher with 
crizotinib than with chemotherapy (74% [95% CI, 67 81] vs. 45% [95% CI, 37, 53], p < 0.001). 
Although substantial benefit has been observed with crizotinib therapy, relapse remains the norm as 
on average patients progress within a year (median PFS = 10.9 months); survival after relapse is poor 
[Solomon B et al 2014]. The three main reasons for crizotinib treatment failure are: development of 
resistant mutations [Doebele et al 2012, Katayama et al 2011], activation of alternative pathways, 
e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor [Doebele et al 2012, Katayama et al 2011, Kim et al 2013] and 
CNS relapse [Costa et al 2011, Chun et al 2012, Weickhardt et al 2012]. The CNS is the primary site of 
progression in up to 46% of patients with ALK positive NSCLC treated with crizotinib [Costa et al 2011, 
Chun et al 2012, Weickhardt et al 2012].  Significant morbidity is associated with brain metastases as 
a function of brain involvement, and because of treatments required for disease control 
(corticosteroids, surgery, and radiation) [Roughley et al 2014, Owen et al 2014, Zimmermann et al 
2014]. The presence of CNS metastases has also been shown to result in poor prognosis and shorter 
survival in patients with NSCLC [Sorensen et al 1988, Owen et al 2014, Zimmermann et al 2014]. 
In the first line setting, ceritinib also showed a statistically significant benefit over chemotherapy in 
delaying disease progression (PFS) with HR of 0.55 (95% CI: [0.42, 0.73]; p < 0.001) and medians of 
16 months and 8 months respectively. 
Alectinib (Alecensa) is a TKI that targets ALK and RET, thereby inhibiting intracellular signalling 
pathways involved in tumour cell proliferation and survival. Alectinib promotes cancer cell death by 
restoring apoptosis and inhibiting tumour cell growth and proliferation. Alectinib was first approved in 
Japan (2014) for treatment of ALK positive unresectable, recurrent or advanced NSCLC in patients who 
have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib (Xalkori). 
In the EU, alectinib is approved for the treatment of ALK-positive advanced NSCLC previously treated 
with crizotinib since 16 February 2017. 
The purpose of this application is to extend the indication of alectinib to include the first line treatment 
of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. The MAH applied for the following change of indication which was 
adopted by the CHMP:  
Alecensa as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In the ERA submitted with the initial MAA, the maximum theoretical use of alectinib was refined based 
on the epidemiologically substantiated prevalence of ALK+ NSCLC. This means that the prevalence 
figure used comprises all expected cases of ALK+ NSCLC, not only the ones previously treated with 
crizotinib. Hence, the ERA as it stands covers the potential environmental risks deriving from all 
applications for ALK+ NSCLC. Therefore, no new or updated environmental risk assessment is needed 
for the current indication extension.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Table 1: Tabular overview of clinical studies in First-Line Treatment of NSCLC 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
2.3.2.1.  Methods 
The clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) of alectinib was analysed by compartmental analysis using a popPK 
approach and in a limited subset of patients who underwent intensive PK assessment also by non-
compartmental analysis (NCA). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize observed PK and NCA 
results. 
Population pharmacokinetic PopPK analyses were conducted using pooled data from the two Phase III 
studies in ALK inhibitor-naïve patients, J ALEX and ALEX, along with data from the Phase I/II study, 
NP28673 to quantitatively describe the PK of alectinib and M4 in patients, and to evaluate the effects 
of relevant covariates (e.g., demographics, laboratory baseline values, disease status) that may 
contribute to the variability in alectinib and/or M4 exposure in individual patients. 
The objectives of thePopPK analyses of the Phase III Studies J-ALEX and ALEX were to: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/833519/2017  
Page 8/77 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Describe the PK of alectinib and its major active metabolite M4 in ALK-positive NSCLC patients 
who are ALK inhibitor-naïve, 
•  Confirm the effects of covariates which contribute significantly to the between-patient 
variability in PK parameters of alectinib and M4 in ALK inhibitor-naïve ALK-positive NSCLC 
patients, 
•  Determine individual estimates for derived secondary PK parameters for exposure-efficacy and 
-safety analyses and for summary statistics. 
Following completion of the ALEX study, additional PK data was made available and all PK data from 
the ALEX study was analysed and reported separately (Study Report 1080486: Population 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis and Exposure-Efficacy and -Safety Analyses of Alectinib and M4 of Phase III 
Study BO28984 in ALK Inhibitor-Naïve Patients with ALK-Positive NSCLC). 
The objectives of this analysis were the same as for the previous pooled PopPK analysis. 
2.3.2.2.  Data 
In J-ALEX, PK samples were collected on Day 1 (baseline before dosing) and at steady-state on Day 
57 and Day 113 at pre dose concentration at the end of a dosing interval (Ctrough). A total of 207 
patients were randomized, of these 103 received alectinib and were included in the PK analysis. 
In ALEX, a subset of patients (n = 10) randomized to receive alectinib underwent intensive PK 
sampling for determination of alectinib and M4 PK parameters by NCA methods.  A total of six patients 
had PK samples collected up to 12 hours and four patients had PK samples collected up to 8 hours 
after the single dose (Visit 0; Baseline).  Of these, nine patients had intense PK sampling available at 
steady-state (Visit 1; Week 4).  A total of four patients had PK samples collected up to 12 hours and 
five patients had PK samples collected up to 8 hour post dose. Further, all patients randomized to 
receive alectinib treatment had sparse PK sampling taken pre-dose (Ctrough; within 2 hours before 
intake of alectinib) at Visit 0 (Baseline before dosing), Visit 1 (Week 4), Visit 2 (Week 8) and at all 
subsequent visits (every 8 weeks) until progressive disease or death/withdrawal from the study. Based 
on QA’d plasma concentration data collected up to 28 June 2016, PK data were available from a total 
of 145 patients who were randomized to receive alectinib. At the clinical cut-off date of the 9th of 
February 2017, a total of 152 patients were randomized to the alectinib arm and were included in the 
second PopPK analysis. 
A total of 1220 alectinib and 1220 M4 plasma concentrations measured from 228 ALK-positive ALK 
inhibitor-naïve NSCLC patients in J-ALEX and ALEX were available for the first, pooled, population PK 
analyses for each of these two entities. The final PK dataset used for the Bayesian feedback analyses 
consists of 986 alectinib and 978 M4 plasma concentrations collected from 228 patients in J-ALEX and 
ALEX. About 2.1% (21) and 3.0% (29) of the plasma concentrations for alectinib and M4, respectively, 
collected after start of treatment were BLQ and were excluded from the analysis dataset. 
As for the second PopPK analysis using only ALEX data, A total of 1486 alectinib and 1486 M4 plasma 
concentrations measured from 143 ALK-positive ALK inhibitor-naïve NSCLC patients in ALEX were 
available for the population PK analyses for each of these two entities. Following data exclusions based 
o predefined criteria, the final PK dataset used for the Bayesian feedback analyses consists of 1302 
alectinib and 1302 M4 plasma concentrations collected from 143 patients in ALEX.

2.3.2.3.  Results 
2.3.2.3.1.  Demographics 
The body weight of patients in the J-ALEX study was lower compared to ALEX and the previous Phase 
II population (see figure below). The median [range] body weight in was 56.9 kg [37.2 to 99.3] and 
65 kg [40.4 to 131.5] in J-ALEX and ALEX, respectively. The patients’ Body mass index (BMI) and body 
surface area (BSA) were also lower in J-ALEX compared to ALEX. 
Figure 1 Body Weight Distribution for Patients in J-ALEX and ALEX and Phase II Studies 
All patients in J-ALEX were Asian while 45% of the patients in ALEX were Asian and 50% of the 
patients were White. Approximately 60% of the patients were female in both J-ALEX and ALEX, and 
the distribution of age and baseline smoking status for patients in both studies were comparable. For 
the baseline laboratory values, patients in J-ALEX and ALEX are generally comparable, with the 
exception that patients in J-ALEX had higher baseline ALP compared to those in ALEX and patients in 
ALEX had higher baseline GGT compared to those in J-ALEX. 
2.3.2.3.2.  Summary statistics of observed PK and non-compartmental analysis 
In the J-ALEX study, geo mean of individual median observed pre dose (Ctrough) concentrations 
across visits was 433 ng/mL for alectinib (geo mean CV%: 48.6) and 158 ng/mL (geo mean CV%: 
45.4) for M4. The M4 to alectinib parent (M/P) ratio based on available data was approximately 40%. 
Following administration of a single dose of 600 mg alectinib under fed conditions in the ALEX study, 
alectinib was absorbed with a median time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of 6.03 hours (range: 
1.98 to 12.00 hours); the alectinib geometric mean maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) 
and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 8 hours (AUC0-8) were 211 ng/mL 
(geo mean CV%: 55.5%) and 713 ng•h/mL (geo mean CV%: 104.9%), respectively.  The median 
Tmax for M4 was reached by 8.00 hours (range: 5.98 to 12.00 hours).  The M4 geometric mean Cmax 
and AUC0-8 were 56.2 ng/mL (geo mean CV%: 80.1%) and 142 ng•h/mL (geo mean CV%: 191.7%), 
respectively.

Following BID administration in patients under fed conditions, alectinib and M4 plasma concentration-
time profiles at Visit 1 (Week 4) were relatively flat with low Cmax/Ctrough ratio (geo mean 
Cmax/pre-dose Ctrough was 1.20 for alectinib and 1.18 for M4).  The geo mean alectinib Cmax was 
717 ng/mL (geo mean CV%: 46.8%) at a median Tmax of 4.02 hours post dose (range: 2.00 to 8.00) 
and AUC0-8 was 5030 ng•h/mL (geo mean CV%: 47.2%).  The geo mean M4 Cmax was 321 ng/mL 
(geo mean CV%: 32.0%) at a median Tmax of 6.00 hours post dose (range: 2.00 to 10.00) and AUC0-
8 was 2230 ng•h/mL (geo mean CV%: 37.0%). 
2.3.2.3.3.  Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
Pooled PopPK analysis of J-ALEX and (partial) ALEX data 
A Bayesian feedback analysis was conducted to analyze data from J-ALEX and ALEX utilizing the 
population PK models previously developed for alectinib and M4 in ALK positive NSCLC patients who 
have progressed on or intolerant to crizotinib (NONMEM version 7.2.0). For the Bayesian feedback 
analysis, the original models developed for alectinib and M4 were used by fixing the population 
parameters to their final values and by fixing to zero the number of maximal evaluation (i.e. MAXEVAL 
= 0) in the estimation subroutine (i.e ESTIMATION) in the NONMEM control streams. Bayesian 
feedback predictions (i.e. post-hoc) of individual PK parameters for alectinib and M4 were then derived 
from the individual observed concentration-time profiles. Goodness-of-fit plots as well as simulation 
based diagnostics (i.e. visual predictive checks [VPC]) were conducted to assess the performance of 
the previously developed popPK models in describing data for ALK positive NSCLC patients who were 
ALK inhibitor naïve. 
The VPC’s below show the median (solid red line), 95th and 5th percentiles (upper and lower dashed 
green lines) of observed concentrations and the corresponding prediction bands obtained from 
simulation of the model using the study design and individual covariates for study J-ALEX.

Figure 2: Visual Predictive Check for Alectinib and M4 Concentrations from J-ALEX 
Pooled PopPK analysis of (final) ALEX data 
The final PK dataset used for the PopPK analysis consisted of 1302 alectinib and 1302 M4 plasma 
concentrations collected from 143 patients in ALEX. Approximately 60% of the patients in ALEX were 
female, 48 % were white while 47% were Asian. Median (range) body weight was 65.2 kg (40.4 kg to 
131.5 kg) and the median range age was 57 years (25 years to 81 years). 
A Bayesian feedback analysis was conducted to analyze data from ALEX utilizing the population PK 
models previously developed for alectinib and M4 in ALK-positive NSCLC patients who have progressed 
on or intolerant to crizotinib. The adequacy of the model was assessed using VPC. 
A one-compartment model with sequential zero and first order absorption could describe the data. 
Body weight was the only significant covariate for the PK of alectinib and M4, influencing the clearance 
(CL) and volume of distribution (V) according to allometric function with fixed exponents (0.75 for CL 
and 1.0 for V). The table below shows the influence of body weight on the predicted steady state 
exposure of alectinib following 600 mg bid dosing.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Evaluations of PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) relationships for clinical efficacy from J-ALEX and selected 
clinical safety events from J-ALEX were conducted to quantitatively assess the ER relationship of 
alectinib in ALK inhibitor-naïve patients.

The objectives of the exposure-efficacy and -safety analyses of the Phase III Study J-ALEX were to: 
• 
Investigate the exposure-efficacy and -safety relationship for alectinib and M4 in ALK-positive 
NSCLC patients who are ALK inhibitor-naïve at 300 mg BID, 
•  Determine whether the variability in efficacy and the occurrence of safety events could be 
attributed to the variability in alectinib and M4 exposure at 300 mg BID, 
•  Characterize the relationship between alectinib and M4 exposure and progression free survival 
(PFS) at 300 mg BID using a Cox proportional-hazards regression model. 
Further, exposure-efficacy analyses were made using data from the ALEX study investigating whether 
the variability in PK exposure could explain part of the variability in efficacy at the dose of 600 mg BID 
in ALK-positive NSCLC patients who were ALK inhibitor-naive patients from ALEX who had PK data 
available were included in the exposure-response analyses. 
2.3.3.1.  Methods 
Exposure-Efficacy 
Individual Caverage, defined as the average concentration from first dose up to the time of efficacy 
(PFS) assessment derived from PopPK models, was used as the surrogate for exposure.  Since M4 has 
been shown to have similar in vitro potency and exhibit similar protein binding as alectinib, the 
Caverage was defined as the average molar concentration of alectinib plus M4.  Patients in the 
exposure-efficacy dataset were grouped into exposure categorizes based on their achieved Caverage. 
The relationship between Caverage and efficacy was graphically investigated for the main efficacy 
parameter, PFS, by exposure categories and the log rank statistic was used to evaluate the graphical 
relationship. 
A Cox proportional-hazards analysis was also conducted to characterize the relationship between 
Caverage and PFS.  The two exposure categories were used in assessing exposure as a categorical 
parameter in the Cox proportional-hazards analysis.  The analysis was conducted by accounting for the 
potential influence of additional factors such as baseline disease status covariates (e.g., tumor size, 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score [0/1, 2], CNS metastases status [yes, no], prior 
chemotherapy [yes, no], prior crizotinib treatment duration), and demographic covariates (e.g., body 
weight, age, gender, race, ethnicity, smoking status [never, past/present]). 
Using a forward inclusion followed by a backward deletion process, significant covariates for PFS were 
selected for the model.  The Cox proportional hazards model which includes the statistically significant 
covariates is referred to as the final Cox proportional hazards model. 
Exposure-Safety 
Graphical analyses were performed to investigate whether the occurrence of safety events could be 
attributed to the variability in alectinib and M4 exposure at the 300 mg BID dose in ALK-positive 
NSCLC patients who were ALK inhibitor-naïve. Patients from J-ALEX who were included in the 
population PK analyses were included in these analyses. 
2.3.3.2.  Numbers analysed 
The exposure-efficacy dataset for the analysis of J-ALEX comprised 96 patients while the analysis of 
ALEX included 143 patients.

2.3.3.3.  Results 
Exposure-Efficacy 
For patients from J-ALEX treated with the 300 mg BID dose, results from the graphical analysis for PFS 
(see Figure 4 below) showed a positive ER relationship between alectinib exposure and PFS.  Patients 
in both low and high alectinib exposure categories showed improved PFS over patients who were 
treated with crizotinib while patients in the high alectinib exposure category also appeared to have 
prolonged PFS compared to the low alectinib exposure category. 
Figure 4 Study J-ALEX: Progression Free Survival versus Alectinib Low/High Exposure 
Groups Following Alectinib 300 mg BID and Crizotinib Treatment 
For the primary efficacy endpoint of ALEX, PFS by investigator, patients in all exposure categories 
showed improved PFS compared to patients who were treated with crizotinib (Figure 5). However, the 
Kaplan-Meier plot showed that the relationship between Caverage and PFS by investigator was not 
significant (p=0.0911) across the 3 exposure categories.

Figure 5 Study ALEX: Progression Free Survival (Investigator) by Exposure Category Following Alectinib 
600 mg BID and Crizotinib Treatment 
Results from the Cox proportional hazards analysis of J-ALEX demonstrated that alectinib exposure 
(i.e., the combined exposure of alectinib and M4) was the only covariate which was identified as a 
statistically significant predictor of PFS. The analysis showed that relative to crizotinib treatment, both 
alectinib low and high exposure categories are associated with an improved PFS with a larger 
magnitude of benefit associated with high alectinib exposure.  Relative to crizotinib treatment, the HR 
for low and high alectinib exposures were 0.54 (95% CI: 0.28 to 1.02) and 0.17 (95% CI: 0.08 to 
0.35), respectively. 
Results of the Cox proportional-hazards analysis for PFS by investigator of the ALEX study showed that 
alectinib treatment effect, CNS metastasis at baseline, and baseline tumour size were the only 
statistically significant predictors of PFS.

For patients receiving 300 mg BID in J-ALEX, logistic regression analyses have shown that there was 
no significant relationship between combined molar concentration of alectinib and M4 (Caverage) and the 
occurrences of SAEs. There was also no significant relationship between Caverage and the occurrences of 
AEs Grade 3 or above. In addition, there was no apparent effect of Caverage on the severity of the first 
event for SAEs and AEs Grade 3 or above.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of alectinib and its major active metabolite (M4) have been characterised earlier 
in ALK-positive NSCLC patients and healthy subjects. In this application, additional information on the 
clinical pharmacology of alectinib was obtained by including results from two Phase III studies in ALK 
inhibitor naïve patients; JO28928 (J-ALEX) the BO28984 (ALEX) study. These data were analysed with 
population PK modelling along with data from the Phase I/II study, NP28673 to quantitatively describe 
the PK of alectinib and M4 in patients, and to evaluate the effects of relevant covariates (e.g., 
demographics, laboratory baseline values, disease status) that may contribute to the variability in 
alectinib and/or M4 exposure in individual patients. 
Japanese patients in the J-ALEX study had lower body weight compared to patients in the ALEX study. 
This reflects the fact that the Japanese population on average has a lower body weight compared to a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/833519/2017  
Page 17/77 
 
 
 
 
 
western, white population. Since the dose in J ALEX (300 mg bid) was lower compared to ALEX (600 
mg bid), the exposure is expected to be lower but not in proportion to dose since the lower body 
weight in J ALEX results in lower clearance and relatively higher exposure. Exposure to alectinib is 
related to body weight and with an identical dose the exposure is expected to be higher in a Japanese 
population compared to a western, white population. If Japanese patients were to be treated with 600 
mg bid alectinib, relatively higher exposure is expected compared to a western, white population due 
to the difference in body weight. 
Further, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling was applied to clinical efficacy as well as 
selected clinical safety events from J-ALEX and ALEX to quantitatively assess the exposure-response 
relationship of alectinib in ALK inhibitor-naïve patients. 
The PK of alectinib in the ALK inhibitor naïve population from J-ALEX and ALEX was similar to the PK in 
patients who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib. Essentially, the previously developed 
population PK model could reasonably well describe the PK data in the J-ALEX and ALEX study. 
The exposure-efficacy analysis of J-ALEX indicated that the response in terms of PFS is related to 
alectinib and M4 exposure since patients with higher exposure seemed to have a lower risk of tumour 
progression. In the ALEX study there was no significant difference in the risk of progression when 
comparing groups with higher or lower exposure. However, the clinical pharmacology data provide 
support for the selected regimen. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of alectinib and its major metabolite M4 has been adequately characterized in 
ALK-positive NSCLC patients who are ALK inhibitor-naïve. Altogether the clinical pharmacology data 
provide support for the selected regimen. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
As opposed to the approved Japanese dose of alectinib i.e. 300 mg BID, the recommended global dose 
was set at 600 mg BID and reviewed in the initial application for licensure of alectinib (after failure on 
crizotinib [Xalkori] based on data from the single arm studies NP28761 and NP28673; 
EMEA/H/C/4164). The dose was determined primarily in the NP28761 study (Phase I dose escalation 
part) where a total of 47 patients with ALK positive NSCLC after failure on crizotinib, were enrolled and 
treated in cohorts in a staggered manner at an initial dose level of 600 mg/day. Study NP28673 also 
had a dose escalation portion (Part 1) but as the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) was considered 
established in study NP28761 further dose finding within NP28673 was not pursued.

Treatments 
Alectinib 600 mg was administered orally BID with food in the morning and evening. If a patient 
missed a dose, it could be taken within 6 hours of the scheduled time. If the time was greater than 6 
hours, or if the patient vomited the dose, the patient was instructed to wait until the next scheduled 
time and take the next scheduled dose. 
Crizotinib 250 mg was administered orally BID (with or without food) in the morning and evening. If a 
dose was missed, then it could be taken as soon as the patient remembered unless it was less than 6 
hours until the next dose, in which case the patient was instructed to not take the missed dose. If 
vomiting occurred after taking a dose of crizotinib, the patient was instructed to take the next dose as 
scheduled.

The following endpoints were also considered: 
- Time to deterioration (TTD) in patient-reported lung cancer symptoms of cough, dyspnoea (single 
item and multi-item subscales), chest pain, arm and shoulder pain, and fatigue as measured by the 
EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Core (QLQ-C30) and the supplemental lung cancer module (QLQ-
LC13) as well as a composite of three symptoms (cough, dyspnoea, chest pain). 
- PROs of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), patient functioning, and side effects of treatment as 
measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-LC13. 
Sample size 
ALEX was designed to demonstrate superiority of alectinib versus crizotinib based on investigator-
assessed PFS. The primary endpoint of PFS was used to determine the sample size of the study. A HR 
of 0.65 for alectinib versus crizotinib was targeted i.e. an increase in median PFS from 10.9 (based on 
the Phase III PROFILE 1014 study of crizotinib vs. standard pemetrexed-platinum-based 
chemotherapy) to 16.8 months. Approximately 170 PFS events were required to achieve 80% power of 
the log-rank test at a two-sided alpha level of 5%. A total of 286 patients were planned to be enrolled 
over approximately 24 months, and the required number of PFS events for the final PFS analysis was 
estimated to occur approximately 33 months after the first patient was enrolled. 
Randomisation 
Central randomization was performed and managed via an interactive voice or web-based response 
system (IxRS). Patients were randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to the two treatment arms via a 
block stratified randomization procedure.  
Stratification factors 
● ECOG PS (0/1 vs. 2),  
● Race (Asian vs. non-Asian), and  
● CNS metastases at baseline (yes vs. no). 
Blinding (masking) 
The study is open label. 
Statistical methods 
All tabulations of patient baseline characteristics and efficacy analyses were performed on the ITT 
population, defined as all randomized patients. Patients were assigned to their randomized treatment 
group. 
The treatment comparison of PFS was based on a stratified log-rank test at the 5% level of significance 
(two-sided). For analysis purposes, stratification according to CNS metastases at baseline was 
performed on the basis of the IRC assessment rather than the investigator assessment. This was done 
because the independent assessment by neuroradiologists was deemed to be the most reliable and 
corresponded to the populations used to assess the CNS efficacy endpoints. The ECOG PS was not 
used for stratified analyses due to low patient numbers (7% in each arm with ECOG PS of 2), as pre-
specified. Results from an unstratified log-rank test were prepared as a supportive analysis. Additional 
supportive analyses included Kaplan-Meier and Cox modeling approaches. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/833519/2017  
Page 23/77 
 
 
 
 
If the primary endpoint of investigator-assessed PFS was statistically significant at a two-sided 5% 
significance level based on the stratified log-rank test, the following secondary endpoints were tested 
in the following sequential order, each at a two-sided 5% significance level: 
• 
• 
PFS by IRC assessment 
Time to CNS progression by IRC RECIST 
•  ORR by investigator assessment 
•  OS 
All tests in the sequence were based on a stratified log-rank test at the 5% level of significance (two-
sided), with the exception of ORR in which a Mantel-Haenszel test was used. The stratification factors 
and the analysis population were the same as for the primary hypothesis test. 
The primary endpoint, PFS, and other time-to-event endpoints was censored at last tumor assessment 
date for patients w/o PD or death (either during study treatment or during FU) at the time of analysis, 
or at date of randomization for patients with no post-baseline tumor assessment. 
A sensitivity analysis was performed on the primary endpoint of investigator-assessed PFS to evaluate 
the robustness of the results. The sensitivity analysis included the following variations from the 
primary analysis: 
•  Censor patients at the last adequate tumor assessment prior to the start of non-protocol 
specified anti-cancer therapy received prior to observing progression. 
•  Censor patients for whom documentation of disease progression or death occurs after ≥2 
missed tumor assessments. These patients were censored at the last tumor assessment prior 
to the missed assessments. 
•  Censor patients who discontinue study treatment (due to personal preference or toxicity) 
and/or withdraw or are lost to follow-up prior to observing disease progression.  
Two additional sensitivity analyses for investigator-assessed PFS were performed: 
• 
The effect of missing tumor assessments was evaluated if the number of missing assessments 
in either arm was > 5%. For patients with disease progression that was determined after one 
or more missing tumor assessments, the progression was backdated to the first missing tumor 
assessment.  
• 
The effect of loss to follow-up was assessed if 
 5 %   o f p a t ie n t s  w e r e  lo s t  
-up for PFS 
in either treatment arm, a “worst-case” analysis was performed in which patients who were 
lost to follow-up were considered to have progressed at the last date they were known to be 
progression-free. 
A sensitivity analysis for PFS and OS was also performed based on the stratification factors entered at 
randomization in the interactive web response system (IxRS) system. 
Subgroup analyses of investigator- and IRC-assessed PFS were conducted for the following: 
•  Age (<65 vs. ≥65) 
•  Sex (male vs. female) 
•  Race (Asian vs. non-Asian) 
•  Smoking status (active smoker vs. non-smoker vs. past smoker)

Recruitment 
Patients were recruited at 98 study sites in 29 countries. The first patient was enrolled on 19 August 
2014 and the last patient was enrolled on 20 January 2016. 
Conduct of the study 
The initial protocol, dated 10 February 2014, was amended four times, including one local country 
amendment (Canada only). 
Protocol Amendments 
Protocol Amendment 1 (Version 2): 8 October 2014 
Protocol Version 1 was amended to comply with questions addressed during the assessment of the 
Voluntary Harmonisation Procedure VHP444 (VHP201415), Western Institutional Review Board request 
(dated June 5, 2014) to further specify protocol inclusion criterion, FDA request (dated July 10, 2014) 
to revise crizotinib dose modification criteria for non-hematologic toxicities to conform to the most 
recent FDA approved label, as well as feedback from various other Health Authorities/Ethic 
Committees. Protocol BO28984 was amended to include the latest clinical and safety information. One 
main change was:  
● Study rationale supplemented with latest crizotinib data from the recently published PROFILE 1014 
study that lead to reassessment of assumptions for median PFS without impacting the target HR for 
the study. Protocol Amendment 2 (Version 3): 14 May 2015 
Protocol Version 2 was amended to incorporate the latest pre-clinical and safety information. Changes 
include those to the specific timing of dose administration, pharmacokinetic objectives, concomitant 
therapy, and exploratory objectives.  
Protocol Amendment 3 (Version 4): 15 April 2016 
Protocol Version 3 was amended to incorporate the latest safety and alectinib administration 
information. Changes included those to AEs relating to alectinib data and management of alectinib AEs 
guidelines, restrictions related to QT-prolonging concomitant medications for alectinib, and guideline 
for the management of missing doses of alectinib.  
A local amendment, Amendment 4 (Protocol Version 5 – Canada dated 10 February 2017) was also 
provided in Canada in order to include information related to gastrointestinal perforation reported for 
patients treated with alectinib, in order to be aligned with the approved Canadian product monograph.

Patient reported outcomes (PRO) 
Baseline compliance for both treatment arms was moderate in the ITT population with about 65 % 
(similar in both arms) completing their baseline assessment. According to the MAH the reason was due 
to suboptimal initial site training to introduce the electronic device used for reporting, to the patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/833519/2017  
Page 38/77 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Among patients who had PRO baseline data, moderate-to-high compliance rates (≥ 60%) throughout 
the study except for Weeks 112 and 116 were observed in the alectinib arm whereas compliance rates 
in the crizotinib arm dropped to ≤60% from Week 68 onwards except for Weeks 120 through128, 
when one patient remained on treatment. On average, patients in the alectinib arm reported clinically 
meaningful improvement in HRQoL earlier (Week 8 vs. Week 12), and for a longer duration of time 
(until Week 88 vs. Week 68), than patients in the crizotinib arm. Patient-reported outcome data 
suggest greater tolerability with alectinib for commonly reported treatment-related symptoms including 
diarrhoea, constipation, peripheral neuropathy, nausea/vomiting, appetite loss, and dysphagia as 
compared with crizotinib.  
Both treatment arms demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement (≥ 10-point decrease) in 
multiple lung cancer symptoms, including patient-reported cough, chest pain, pain in other parts, 
fatigue, and dyspnoea (single-item scale). It is however recognised that  patients in the alectinib arm 
reported symptomatic improvement for a longer duration of time than patients in the crizotinib arm.  
For the subgroup of patients with CNS metastases at baseline, a lower proportion (≥ 10% difference) 
of patients in the alectinib arm reported clinically meaningful worsening in HRQoL compared with 
crizotinib, starting at Week 12 (4% alectinib vs. 16% crizotinib) and persisting for most assessments 
through Week 84 (0% alectinib vs. 17% crizotinib). Although limited differences between treatment 
arms were seen in cognitive functioning in the PRO-evaluable population, a benefit with alectinib was 
shown within the pre-specified subgroup of patients with CNS metastases at baseline. Fewer patients 
receiving alectinib reported clinically meaningful worsening in cognitive functioning compared with 
crizotinib, starting at Week 4 (8% vs. 27%) and continuing through Week 84 (10% vs. 33%). 
Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity Analyses 
The results of the pre-specified sensitivity analysis which applied alternative censoring rules, were 
consistent with the primary efficacy analysis, demonstrating superiority of alectinib over crizotinib in 
reducing the risk of disease progression or death (investigator-assessed PFS) by 60% (HR 0.40; 95% 
CI: 0.28-0.58; p < 0.0001).

Supportive studies 
Study JO28928 (J-ALEX) 
An open-label, randomized Phase III study comparing alectinib head to head to crizotinib in patients 
who were ALK-inhibitor naïve but may have had received up to one prior chemotherapy regimen for 
ALK–positive NSCLC. 
J-ALEX was conducted in an all Japanese population.  
Treatments 
Experimental arm (N=103): alectinib 300 mg BID  
Control arm (N=104): crizotinib 250 mg BID (EU approved dose, Xalkori SmPC). 
Randomisation 
J-ALEX: A total of 207 patients were randomised in a 1:1 design to either crizotinib or alectinib by 
stratified permuted-block method using the following 3 factors, as stratification factors: 
1)  ECOG PS (0 or 1 vs. 2) 
2)  Treatment line (1st line vs. 2nd line) 
3)  Disease stage (IIIB/IV vs. post-operative recurrence). 
Baseline and disease characteristics 
The study population essentially reflects the ALK-positive NSCLC population i.e. diagnosed at a 
younger age than observed in the general NSCLC population, predominantly women and non-smokers 
with adenocarcinoma as expected, the dominating histology.  
Endpoints 
Primary endpoint:  PFS by Independent review  
Secondary endpoints: PFS by investigator, ORR (IRF), DoR (IRF), TTR (IRF), OS, Time to CNS 
progression in patients with CNS metastases at baseline, Time to onset of CNS metastases in patients 
without CNS metastases at baseline, Health-related QoL 
Results 
The initial submitted data was based on the results of the 2nd interim analysis with the cut-off date of 
December 3, 2015 when about 50% (83 events) of the required PFS events were reported whereby 
the iDMC recommended early study termination based on the efficacy. The median duration of follow-
up at the time of this analysis was 12 months (range: 1 to 23 months) for the alectinib arm and 12 
months (range: 0 to 20 months) for the crizotinib arm. 
The study met its primary endpoint of superiority of alectinib over crizotinib in the first-line setting of 
ALK-inhibitors, with an improvement and at least a doubling of the PFS from median 10.2 months to 
NE (95%CI: 20.3-NE) resulting in HR 0.34. IRF-assessed ORR was 68.9% vs 76.7%, which is in line 
with other ALK-inhibitors and lower than in the phase I/II study. Time to response was similar in both 
arms but DOR was markedly longer with alectinib (11.1 months vs NE, HR 0.32). 
The Applicant has as requested, provided an updated analysis with the cut-off date of 30 September 
2016 meaning an additional 10 months of follow-up.

AF-001JP 
This Phase I/II Japanese study supports the results from the J-ALEX study. Primary endpoint was ORR 
by IRF (~94 %). Secondary endpoints PFS by IRF and OS are still relatively immature at the data cut-
off date (39 % and 28 % event rate respectively) (data not shown). 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Alectinib received a conditional market authorisation in February 2017 based on data from two Phase 
I/II studies (studies NP28673 and NP28761) evaluating alectinib in ALK-positive NSCLC patients who 
had progressed on crizotinib (EMEA/H/C/4164). The specific obligation linked to the CMA is the 
submission of the ALEX CSR.  
This variation concerns the extension of indication to first-line treatment of patients with ALK-positive 
advanced NSCLC. Initially only data from the ongoing Japanese Phase III J-ALEX study and from the 
Phase I/II AF-001JP study were submitted. However, in response to the request for supplementary 
information, the MAH provided data from the primary analysis from the ALEX study and as a 
consequence, requested a conversion of conditional to full marketing authorization within the context 
of this procedure. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The ALEX study is considered the main study in this assessment as the dosing of alectinib is the EU 
approved dose i.e 600 mg BID. The CSR covers the study period of 19 August 2014 until data cut-off 
for the primary analysis on 9 February 2017. Data base lock occurred on the 31 March 2017. 
A total of 303 patients were enrolled in the ALEX study and randomised in a 1:1 design to either 
alectinib 600 mg BID (N=152) or crizotinib (N=151). Both doses are according to their respective label 
(Alecenca SmPC and Xalkori SmPC respectively). 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are non-controversial thus raising no concern.  
The dose of 600 mg BID was reviewed in the initial application for licensure and at that point 
considered reasonably well justified.  
The ALEX study provides further support of the higher dose as PK/PD data shows that higher exposure 
seemingly is related to improved outcome. Thus the selected dose is considered justified. 
In terms of baseline and disease characteristics, the study population essentially reflects the ALK-
positive NSCLC population i.e. diagnosed at a younger age than observed in the general NSCLC 
population, predominantly women and non-smokers with adenocarcinoma the dominating histology. 
The vast majority had Stage IV disease at baseline (97%) and > 90 % had ECOG PS 0 or 1. Baseline 
and disease characteristics are largely well balanced.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study met its primary endpoint with a risk reduction for disease progression or death with 53%  
compared with crizotinib (HR=0.47, 95%CI:0.34, 0.65, p value < 0.0001) and the estimated median 
PFS was 11 months in the crizotinib arm whilst not yet reached in the alectinib arm. The K-M curves 
separates at about 6 months of treatment and remain clearly separated. This is well in line with 
previous observations in the J-ALEX study. PFS by IRC (key secondary endpoint) is consistent with the 
findings from the primary endpoint (HR 0.50 [95% CI: 0.36-0.70; stratified log-rank p < 0.0001]). The 
median PFS was 10 months in the crizotinib arm and approximately 26 months in the alectinib arm.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/833519/2017  
Page 45/77 
 
 
 
 
The sensitivity analyses support the result in the primary analysis and the treatment effect was 
consistent across the majority of pre-specified subgroups albeit the limited number of patients in some 
of them must be taken into consideration. 
The secondary endpoint Time to CNS progression by IRC clearly demonstrates the superiority of 
alectinib over crizotinib in this patient population. The HR is 0.16 (0.10, 0.28), p value < 0.0001. The 
OS data are not yet mature, but there is a numerical difference in patients with events in favour of 
alectinib.  
In terms of ORR, the proportion of responders (by INV) was 83% in the alectinib arm and 76% in the 
crizotinib arm. The difference in ORR of 7.4% (95% CI b [-1.71%, 16.50%]) for this key secondary 
endpoint was not statistically significant (p < 0.0936). 
At the time of data cut-off, the median DOR was 11 months in the crizotinib arm and had not yet been 
reached in the alectinib arm. 
In regard to overall survival, 27% of patients in the crizotinib arm and 23% of patients in the alectinib 
arm had died at the time of data cutoff, and median OS was not estimable in either arm.  As the 
previous key secondary endpoint of investigator assessed ORR in the pre specified hierarchy was not 
statistically significant, OS was not formally tested for statistical significance (HR 0.76 [95% CI: 0.48, 
1.20]).  An OS follow up analysis is planned when approximately 50% of patients (i.e. 143 patients) 
have died.  
The cumulative incidence of CNS progression was consistently lower across time in the alectinib arm 
compared with the crizotinib arm. This is indeed of clinical relevance. In terms of CNS response rate, in 
patients with measurable and non-measurable CNS lesions at baseline, more patients in the alectinib 
arm achieved a CNS response (59%) compared with crizotinib (26%). There were also more patients 
in the alectinib arm (45%) that achieved a CNS complete response compared with crizotinib (9%). 
Likewise, in patients with measurable CNS lesions at baseline, more patients in the alectinib arm 
achieved a CNS response (81%) compared with crizotinib (50%) with 38 % of the patients achieving 
CR in the alectinib arm as compared to the crizotinib arm (~5%). 
A benefit favouring alectinib to crizotinib was also observed in regard to CNS response duration with a 
median of 17 months for alectinib treated patients compared with~ 6 months for patients in the 
crizotinib arm among CNS responders with measurable CNS lesions at baseline. In patients with 
measurable and non-measurable CNS lesions at baseline, the median CNS DOR had not yet been 
reached in the alectinib arm at the time of the data cut-off whilst the median CNS DOR in the crizotinib 
arm was about 4 months. These results are indeed clinical relevant however, the limited number of 
patients included in the analyses is recognised. 
In terms of HQoL/PRO results, baseline compliance for both treatment arms was moderate (~65 % 
completing their baseline assessment). PRO results are suggestive of increased tolerability for alectinib 
compared to crizotinib including commonly reported treatment-related symptoms (e.g. GI-related) 
although the open-label design should be taken into consideration. 
During the review, the MAH was requested to discuss if there are any predictive factors that could help 
to identify resistance to alectinib. As of today no factors that would predict resistance to alectinib or 
any other ALK inhibitor in the first-line setting have been identified. However there is preliminary 
evidence that knowledge of the ALK variant may provide valuable information if patients may develop 
ALK dependent resistance. Resistance to ALK TKI treatment, either acquired secondary ALK mutations 
or activation of ALK independent pathways (Isozaki et al 2016; Dong et al 2016) like EGFR pathway 
activation, is considered to be the result of the selective pressure on the tumour caused by ALK TKI 
treatment.

Eligible patients in the ALEX study were to have histological or cytological confirmed diagnosis of 
advanced or recurrent (Stage IIIB not amenable for multimodality treatment) or metastatic (Stage IV) 
ALK-positive NSCLC. Although the study enrolled mainly patients with Stage IV disease (80 %),  there 
is no reason to question similar anti-tumour activity in patients with Stage III disease reason why it 
was considered appropriate to follow the same wording of indication as previously adopted for the 
second line setting and for other ALK inhibitors. 
Supportive studies 
The results from the ALEX study are supported by data from the Japanese J-ALEX study and the Phase 
I/II AF-001JP study. These two studies were already included and reviewed in the initial application for 
licensure (EMEA/H/C/4164). J-ALEX is an open-label, randomized (1:1), Phase III study comparing the 
efficacy and safety of crizotinib 250 mg BID (EU approved dose) versus alectinib 300 mg BID 
(Japanese approved dose) in patients who were ALK inhibitor – naïve. Patients could have received up 
to one prior chemotherapy regimen. A total of 207 patients were included (103 in the alectinib arm 
and 104 in the crizotinib arm).  
The study met its primary endpoint of superiority of alectinib over crizotinib in the first-line setting of 
ALK-inhibitors, with an improvement and at least a doubling of the PFS from median 10.2 months to 
NE (95%CI: 20.3-NE) resulting in HR 0.34. IRF-assessed ORR was 68.9% vs 76.7%, which is in line 
with other ALK-inhibitors and lower than in the phase I/II study. Time to response was similar in both 
arms but DOR was markedly longer with alectinib (11.1 months vs NE, HR 0.32). The Applicant has 
provided an updated analysis with the cut-off date of 30 September 2016 meaning an additional 10 
months of follow-up. The updated PFS data continue to be in favour of alectinib and in line with the 
primary analysis. While PFS data in the crizotinib can be considered mature, the number of patients 
with events in the alectinib arm (41%) is still considered immature. The OS data are also considered 
immature, but with a trend in favour of alectinib. 
Although promising results on CNS efficacy the data were immature. An update has been provided and 
the updated efficacy data continues to support the primary analysis. Patient with brain metastases that 
are treated with alectinib continue to be at lower risk of progression of CNS metastases. In patients 
with no CNS metastases at baseline, alectinib continues to show a clear benefit. Having in mind that 
these lung cancer patients often relapse due to CNS metastases, alectinib seems to provide an 
advantage in terms of PFS. 
In the Phase I/II AF-001JP study primary endpoint was ORR by IRF (~94 %). Secondary endpoints PFS 
by IRF and OS are still relatively immature at the data cut-off date (39 % and 28 % event rate 
respectively). 
Considering the results from the ALEX study, the efficacy of alectinib in first-line is considered 
demonstrated.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the previous submitted data from the Japanese, crizotinib comparative J-ALEX study a convincing 
benefit of alectinib over that of crizotinib was demonstrated. With the data now available from the 
primary analysis of the global ALEX study which uses the EU-approved alectinib dose of 600 mg BID, 
the superiority of alectinib over crizotinib in treatment-naïve patients with advanced ALK-positive 
NSCLC has been further substantiated. The treatment effect of alectinib on CNS metastases is 
compelling and of high clinical relevance. 
The MAH is recommended to submit the final OS analysis for the ALEX study.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety data are available from a total of 303 patients in the ALEX study (N=152 alectinib; N=151 
crizotinib). All patients in the ITT population received at least one dose of assigned study drug and 
were included in the safety population. 
Supportive safety data were also provided from the Phase III J-ALEX study (103 patients in alectinib 
arm and 104 patients in crizotinib arm). 
Patient exposure 
The median duration of treatment was 18 months (range: 0-29 months) in the alectinib arm as 
compared with 11 month (range: 0-27 months) in the crizotinib arm. The proportion of patients that 
completed > 12 months of treatment was 66 % and 45 % for alectinib and crizotinib respectively and 
49 % and 27 % completed > 18 months respectively. The mean dose intensity was comparable 
between treatment arms (92% for crizotinib and 96% for alectinib).

● General disorders and administration site conditions (57% vs. 51%) 
● Investigations (46% each) 
● Nervous system disorders (45% vs. 26%) 
● Eye disorders (33% vs. 8%) 
● Infections and infestations (30% vs. 40%) 
● Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (30% vs. 32%) 
● Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (28% vs. 36%)

Table 25: Grade 3 or Higher Adverse Events with a Difference in Incidence of at Least 2% between 
Treatment Arms (Safety Population) 
Grade 3 elevation of CPK was reported for 2.6% of patients receiving alectinib and 1.3% of patients 
receiving crizotinib; and median time to Grade 3 CPK elevation was 27.5 days and 369 days, 
respectively, in the pivotal phase III clinical trial BO28984 (ALEX). 
Adverse drug reactions 
Adverse drug reactions were identified based on the collective assessment of AE data from clinical 
trials, non-clinical data, the causal relationship for AEs, and the drug’s mechanism of action. 
Pooled data from across the Phase II studies (NP28761, NP28673) and Phase III Study BO28984 
(ALEX) have been included.  The alectinib exposed patient population in the pooled Phase II studies 
and ALEX includes all patients who received at least one dose of alectinib, as follows: 
• 
NP28761 and NP28673: N = 253 patients treated with alectinib 600 mg twice daily (BID) (data 
cutoff dates of 22 January 2016 for Study NP28761 and 01 February 2016 for Study NP28673) 
• 
ALEX: N = 152 patients treated with alectinib 600 mg BID (data cut-off date of 09 February 
2017). 
Thus, the denominator for the calculation of incidences of ADRs accounts for 405 patients treated with 
alectinib 600 mg BID. 
Increased weight, acute kidney injury, dysgeusia and stomatitis were the newly identified ADRs.

Clinically relevant shifts were defined as a shift from NCI CTCAE Grade 0, 1 or 2 at baseline to Grade 3 
or 4 post-baseline. 
Elevations of CPK occurred in 43% of 362 patients with CPK laboratory data available across clinical 
trials (NP28761, NP28673, BO28984) with alectinib. The incidence of Grade 3 elevations of CPK was 
3.7%.

Urinalysis 
Two of 134 patients in the alectinib arm and two of 130 patients in the crizotinib arm experienced a 
clinically relevant shift in urine protein. No clinically relevant shifts were seen for urine albumin or 
urine creatinine. 
Hormone evaluation 
In both treatment arms, few male patients experienced abnormalities in FSH, LH, or testosterone 
concentrations throughout the study. More male patients in the alectinib arm tended to have high FSH 
and high LH (relative to baseline) as compared to patients in the crizotinib arm where low testosterone 
tended to be observed.  
Vital signs  
Electrocardiogram  
ECG findings showed post-baseline increases in median values for PR, QT, and QT corrected using 
Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) and a decrease in heart rate in both treatment arms. Few patients 7/144 
patients [5%]) had clinically relevant ECG abnormalities post-baseline in the alectinib arm. 
Most patients in both treatment arms had a maximum post-baseline QTcF interval of ≤ 450 msec 
(80% crizotinib vs. 93% alectinib). Moderate (> 480 to ≤ 500 msec) and severe (> 500 msec) QTcF

prolongation was experienced by more patients on crizotinib (3% and 6%, respectively) than alectinib 
(1% and 0%, respectively). Similarly, absolute changes from baseline in QTcF that were moderate (> 
30 to ≤ 60 msec) or severe (> 60 msec) occurred in more patients receiving crizotinib (26% and 10%, 
respectively) than alectinib (20% and 1%, respectively). 
Bradycardia  
Cases of bradycardia (8.9%) of Grade 1 or 2 have been reported in patients treated with Alecensa 
across clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673, BO28984). No patients had events of Grade ≥ 3 severity. 
There were 66 of 365 patients (18%) treated with Alecensa who had post-dose heart rate values below 
50 beats per minutes (bpm). In the phase III clinical trial BO28984 15% of patients treated with 
Alecensa had post-dose heart rate values below 50 bpm versus 20% of patients treated with crizotinib. 
Safety in special populations 
Gender 
Overall, a comparable proportion of male and female patients in each treatment arm experienced an 
AE, and the most frequently occurring AEs for male and female patients were consistent with the 
overall population for the respective treatment arm.

Supportive data 
The Phase III J-ALEX study (103 patients in alectinib arm and 104 patients in crizotinib arm) was 
conducted in Japan at the Japanese approved dose of alectinib 300 mg BID which equals half of the 
recommended global dose i.e. 600 mg BID. 
The median duration of follow-up was comparable in both arms (12 months [range: 2-23 months] 
crizotinib vs. 13 months [range: 4-24 months] alectinib).

Post marketing experience 
As of April 2017, alectinib 600 mg BID was approved in 38 countries globally for the treatment of 
patients who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib therapy. As of 29 April 2017, the 
estimated cumulative market exposure to alectinib is 6275 patients (300 mg BID: Japan, n = 3831; 
600 mg BID: US, n = 2238; European Economic Area, n = 47; Rest of World, n = 159) since its 
International Birth Date of 4 July 2014. The alectinib safety profile in the post-marketing period is 
consistent with safety data from clinical trials of alectinib. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data are available from a total of 303 patients in the ALEX study (N=152 alectinib; N=151 
crizotinib).   
In terms of exposure, the median duration of treatment was 18 months (range: 0-29 months) in the 
alectinib arm as compared with 11 month (range: 0-27 months) in the crizotinib arm. The proportion 
of patients that completed > 12 months of treatment was 66 % and 45 % for alectinib and crizotinib 
respectively and 49 % and 27 % completed > 18 months respectively. The mean dose intensity was 
comparable between treatment arms (92% for crizotinib and 96% for alectinib). 
The same proportion of patients reported ≥1 AE in the two arms (97 %). Likewise there is a similarity 
in terms of AEs with fatal outcomes, serious AEs (approximately 29 %) and AES leading to treatment 
discontinuations (approximately 12 %). However, Grade ≥3 events and AEs leading to drug 
interruption and dose reductions occurred to a lesser extent in the alectinib arm (41 %, 19 % and 16 
% respectively in the alectinib arm vs. 50 %, 25 % and 21 % respectively in the crizotinib arm). The 
longer duration of alectinib treatment compared to crizotinib should also be taken into account when 
considering these rates. 
With the exception for constipation that was similar between the two arms, rash, arthralgia, myalgia, 
anaemia and blood bilirubin increased constituted AEs more commonly reported for alectinib  whilst GI 
disorders were more commonly reported in the crizotinib arm. 
Grade 5 AEs occurred in seven patients (5%) receiving crizotinib and five patients (3%) receiving 
alectinib. Narratives have been provided. Two events in the crizotinib arm (pneumonitis and cardiac 
arrest) and none in the alectinib arm were reported by the investigator as treatment-related. 
In general, gender did not substantially influence the type of AEs reported. 
Nausea/vomiting, ALAT and ASAT increases were more commonly reported in the younger age-group 
whilst fatigue, decreased appetite and bilirubin increases were more often reported in the older age-
group. However, a firm conclusion is hampered by the small numbers of patients ≥ 65 years enrolled 
in the ALEX study (N=37 patients ≥65, N=115 <65 in the alectinib arm and similar in the crizotinib 
arm). 
In the ALEX study, about 50 % of the patients were Caucasian and 45 % were Asian. Some differences 
in the incidence of individual AEs were observed.  For alectinib peripheral oedema was reported in a 
higher proportion (≥ 10% absolute difference) of non-Asian patients whereas constipation, increased 
AST, and increased ALT were reported in higher proportions of Asian patients. In the crizotinib arm, 
higher proportions (≥ 10% absolute difference) of non-Asian patients reported nausea, diarrhoea, 
fatigue, and dysgeusia, whereas vomiting, constipation, and increased ALT were reported in higher 
proportions of Asian patients. Due to the limited number of patients other than Asians or non-Asians 
enrolled, no conclusions can be drawn.

Embryo-foetal toxicity is an important potential risk to the use of alectinib as reflected in sections 4.4 
and 4.6 of the SmPC. The MAH will implement a targeted questionnaire in the event of a pregnancy 
occurring during alectinib treatment as a routine pharmacovigilance activity (see RMP).  
As also demonstrated in the Japanese J-ALEX study, at the dose of 300 mg BID the safety profile of 
alectinib appears to compare favourably to that of crizotinib administered at the (EU approved) dose of 
250 mg BID. The safety database in this study encompasses 161 alectinib-treated patients. 
Consistent with the ALEX study, almost all patients reported at least one AE in both arms. Grade 3/4 
events and serious events were more often reported in the crizotinib arm compared to alectinib (52 % 
and 26 % versus 26 % and 15 % for alectinib). In this study there were no fatal events attributed to 
AEs in either arm.  
Data from the J-ALEX study show that haematological events in general occurred with low frequencies 
and grade of severity. No clinically relevant differences could be observed between patients with and 
without prior chemotherapy. There is no indication that the use of alectinib in patients with prior 
chemotherapy leads to higher incidence of haematological events. 
Also AEs leading to withdrawal in the J-ALEX study were more commonly reported in the crizotinib arm 
compared to alectinib (20 % and 9 % respectively) as were AEs leading to study drug suspension (74 
% and 29 % respectively). The most commonly reported AEs (occurring in ≥ 20% of patients) with 
alectinib were constipation (35%) and nasopharyngitis (20%) while in the crizotinib arm, these were 
nausea (74%), diarrhoea (73%), vomiting (58%), visual impairment (55%), dysgeusia (52%), 
constipation (44%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (32%), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) increased (31%), nasopharyngitis (23%), pyrexia (20%) and decreased appetite (20%). 
Commonly reported in the alectinib arm were also dysgeusia (18%) and stomatitis (12%). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall the safety profile of alectinib in 1st line ALK-positive NSCLC is consistent with the known safety 
profile in the second line setting. The newly identified ADRs from the safety dataset submitted as part 
of this application are increased weight, acute kidney injury, dysgeusia and stomatitis. 
As demonstrated in the ALEX study, the safety profile of alectinib dosed at 600 mg BID compares 
overall favourably to that of crizotinib. This is further supported by the same observations in the 
Japanese J-ALEX.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/833519/2017  
Page 70/77 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, Annex II has been updated to reflect that the specific obligation to submit the results of 
the Phase III study ALEX has been submitted. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
•  No significant changes impacting the readability of the package leaflet are made. The new 
additions follow the same structure and use similar descriptions and terminology as used in the 
approved package leaflet. 
• 
• 
The target group of users will be similar between the approved indication (ALKpositive 
advanced NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib) and the new indication (first-line treatment 
of advanced ALK-positive NSCLC), with no significant age difference. 
The posology proposed in this application is the same as the currently approved indication in 
ALK-positive NSCLC patients previously treated with crizotinib. 
2.8.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Alecensa (alectinib) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
NSCLC is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and represents a major health 
problem.  There are approximately 449,000 cases and 388,000 deaths per year in the European Union 
(EU) [GLOBOCAN 2012]. The expected 5 year survival rate for all lung cancer patients in the US is only 
18% [Siegel et al 2016]. 
Approximately 5% of NSCLC cases have been shown to harbour the EML4 ALK fusion gene [Barlesi et 
al 2016] as a result of a chromosomal inversion at 2p21 and 2p23 [Choi et al 2010, Ou et al 2012]. 
The resulting ALK fusion protein results in activation and dysregulation of the gene’s expression and 
signalling, which can contribute to increased cell proliferation and survival in tumours expressing these 
genes. Patients with ‘ALK positive’ tumours tend to have specific clinical features, including never or 
light smoking history, high frequencies in females, younger age, adenocarcinoma histology, and are 
sensitive to therapy with ALK inhibitors [Gridelli et al 2014].  ALK positive NSCLC patients can develop 
resistance and progression of disease particularly in the CNS resulting in poor prognosis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/833519/2017  
Page 71/77 
 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Crizotinib is the current standard of care, and chemotherapy is also available as a first line treatment 
option for ALK positive NSCLC [ESMO guidelines 2016 and NCCN guidelines 2016]. Crizotinib is the 
only EU approved ALK inhibitor for the first line treatment of ALK positive NSCLC. Although substantial 
benefit has been observed with crizotinib therapy, relapse remains the norm as on average patients 
progress within a year (median PFS = 10.9 months); survival after relapse is poor [Solomon B et al 
2014]. The three main reasons for crizotinib treatment failure are: development of resistant mutations 
[Doebele et al 2012, Katayama et al 2011], activation of alternative pathways, e.g., epidermal growth 
factor receptor [Doebele et al 2012, Katayama et al 2011, Kim et al 2013], and CNS relapse [Costa et 
al 2011, Chun et al 2012, Weickhardt et al 2012]. The CNS is the primary site of progression in up to 
46% of patients with ALK positive NSCLC treated with crizotinib [Costa et al 2011, Chun et al 2012, 
Weickhardt et al 2012]. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
In the initial variation application, data from the ongoing Japanese Phase III J-ALEX study and from 
the Phase I/II AF-001JP study were submitted. However, in response to the request for supplementary 
information, the MAH has provided data from the primary analysis from the ALEX study (specific 
obligation), an ongoing, global, randomized (1:1), multicentre Phase III open-label study investigating 
the efficacy and safety of alectinib 600 mg BID compared with crizotinib 250 mg BID in patients who 
are treatment-naïve with advanced or recurrent or metastatic (Stage IV) ALK-positive NSCLC. A total 
of 303 patients were enrolled and randomised to either alectinib 600 mg BID (N=152) or crizotinib 
(N=151). The posologies are according to their respective label (Alecensa SmPC and Xalkori SmPC). 
As a consequence, the MAH requested a conversion of conditional to full marketing authorization within 
this procedure. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The ALEX study met its primary endpoint of PFS as assessed by investigator, with a risk reduction for 
disease progression or death of 53% compared with crizotinib [HR 0.47 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.34-0.65), stratified log-rank p < 0.0001]. The estimated median PFS was 11 months in the crizotinib 
arm whilst not yet reached in the alectinib arm. The sensitivity analyses performed on PFS support the 
result in the primary analysis and the treatment effect was consistent across the majority of pre-
specified subgroups albeit the limited number of patients in some of them is noted.  
Results from the secondary endpoint IRC-assessed PFS were consistent with those of the investigator-
assessed PFS with HR 0.50 (95% CI: 0.36-0.70; stratified log-rank p < 0.0001). The median PFS was 
10 months in the crizotinib arm and approximately 26 months in the alectinib arm. 
Furthermore, alectinib decreased the risk of CNS progression without prior non-CNS progression 
compared with crizotinib (HR 0.16; 95% CI 0.10-0.28, p < 0.0001). In patients with measurable and 
non-measurable CNS lesions at baseline (assessed by IRC), more patients in the alectinib arm 
achieved a CNS response (59%) compared with crizotinib (26%) with 45 % and 9 % complete 
responses respectively. In the subgroup of patients with baseline measurable CNS lesions, ORR was 
observed in 81% and 50% respectively with 38 % complete responses in the alectinib arm as 
compared to 5 % in the crizotinib arm. 
Among responders with both measurable and non-measurable CNS lesions at baseline, the median 
CNS DOR had not yet been reached in the alectinib arm and was about 4 months in the crizotinib arm.

In the subgroup of responders with measurable CNS lesions, the median CNS DOR in responders was 
17 months in the alectinib arm and about 6 months in the crizotinib arm. 
In terms of overall survival data is as expected, immature with 27% of patients in the crizotinib arm 
and 23% of patients in the alectinib arm had died at the time of data cut-off. The MAH is 
recommended to submit the final OS analysis for the ALEX study. 
OS was not formally tested for statistical significance (HR 0.76 [95% CI: 0.48, 1.20]) as the previous 
key secondary endpoint of investigator-assessed ORR in the pre-specified hierarchy was not 
statistically significant. 
In terms of HRQoL/PRO results, baseline compliance for both treatment arms was poor (~65 % 
completing their baseline assessment). Data are suggestive of increased tolerability for alectinib 
compared to crizotinib including commonly reported treatment-related symptoms (e.g. GI-related) 
although the open-label design should be taken into consideration. 
Data from the crizotinib-comparative J-ALEX and the Phase I/II AF-001JP studies (Japanese patients 
dosed at 300 mg BID) supports the findings in the ALEX study. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
N/A  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Safety data are available from a total of 303 patients in the ALEX study (N=152 alectinib; N=151 
crizotinib).  
The same proportion of patients reported ≥ 1 AE in the alectinib and crizotinib arms (97 %). Likewise 
there is a similarity in terms of AEs with fatal outcomes, serious AEs (approximately 29 %) and AES 
leading to treatment discontinuations (approximately 12 %).  
However, Grade ≥3 AEs and AEs leading to drug interruption and dose reductions occurred to a lesser 
extent in the alectinib arm (41 %, 19 % and 16 % respectively in the alectinib arm vs. 50 %, 25 % 
and 21 % respectively in the crizotinib arm). The longer duration of alectinib treatment compared to 
crizotinib should also be taken into account when considering these rates. 
With the exception for constipation that was similar between the two arms, rash, arthralgia, myalgia, 
anaemia and blood bilirubin increased constituted AEs more commonly reported for alectinib whilst GI 
disorders were more commonly reported in the crizotinib arm. 
Grade 5 AEs occurred in seven patients (5%) receiving crizotinib and five patients (3%) receiving 
alectinib.  
The most common ADRs reported with alectinib in the ALEX trial are: constipation (34%), myalgia 
(23%), oedema (22%), increased bilirubin (21%) and anaemia (20%). 
The most common grade 3/4 ADRs reported with alectinib in the ALEX trial are: Increased AST (5.3%), 
increased ALT (4.6%), anaemia (4.6%) and increased bilirubin (3.3%). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Data on long-term safety is missing as also reflected in the RMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The data available from the primary analysis of the global ALEX study using the EU-approved alectinib 
dose of 600 mg BID, showed superiority of alectinib over crizotinib in the 1st line treatment-naïve 
patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC. The treatment effect of alectinib on CNS metastases is 
compelling and of high clinical relevance.  
It is recognised that the safety results from the primary analysis of the ALEX study are essentially 
consistent with the known safety profile of alectinib. Four new ADRs have been identified based on the 
new data submitted (stomatitis, dysgeusia, acute kidney injury and increased weight).  
Lower proportions of AEs that were treatment-related, Grade ≥3 in severity and that led to dose 
reduction or interruption were reported for alectinib as compared to crizotinib. The longer treatment 
duration for alectinib should also be taken into account. From a safety perspective and as 
demonstrated in the ALEX study, the safety profile of alectinib dosed at 600 mg BID compares overall 
favourably to that of crizotinib.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The data from the primary analysis of the ALEX study showed superiority of alectinib over crizotinib in 
treatment-naïve patients with advanced or recurrent (Stage IIIB not amenable for multimodality 
treatment) or metastatic (Stage IV)  NSCLC in terms of progression-free survival and lower toxicity 
despite the longer exposure.  
The indication wording states that alectinib is indicated in patients with advanced disease which in 
clinical practice is equivalent to patients with either locally advanced disease not amenable for surgery 
or patients with metastatic (Stage IV) disease. The wording is from a clinical perspective considered 
appropriate.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
A conditional marketing authorisation was granted for alectinib on 16 February 2017 (EMEA/H/C/4164) 
based on data from two Phase I/II studies (studies NP28673 and NP28761) evaluating alectinib in ALK-
positive NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. The specific obligation linked to the CMA 
was the submission of the ALEX CSR. As data from the primary analysis of the ALEX study have now 
been submitted in the context of this variation application, the MAH is requesting the granting of a 
marketing authorisation no longer subject to specific obligations as the specific obligation is considered 
fulfilled. The data from this analysis confirms a positive B/R balance for alectinib in the sought 
indication and constitute a comprehensive data package supporting granting of a marketing 
authorisation no longer subject to specific obligations for alectinib. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Alecensa is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
Assessment report

and 5.1 of the SmPC and Annex II are updated. The Package Leaflet and the RMP are updated in 
accordance.  
In addition, the CHMP, having considered the application as set out in the appended assessment report 
and on the basis of the evidence of compliance with the specific obligations submitted by the 
marketing authorisation holder, is of the opinion that the risk-benefit balance of the above mentioned 
medicinal product remains favourable. As all specific obligations laid down in Annex II have been 
fulfilled, pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the CHMP recommends by consensus 
the granting of a Marketing Authorisation in accordance with Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 for the above mentioned medicinal product. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the following obligation has been fulfilled, and therefore recommends 
its deletion from the Annex II: 
Description 
Due date 
In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of alectinib in the treatment of 
30 April 2018 
patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, the MAH should submit the clinical study report of 
the phase III study ALEX comparing alectinib versus crizotinib in treatment naïve 
patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

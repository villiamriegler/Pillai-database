Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSURs for umeclidinium bromide / vilanterol, the 
scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Following  a  post-approval regulatory  requests  in  the  last  PSUR  (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010264/201712), 
the MAH provided a review of the adverse drug reaction (ADR) ‘dizziness’. The MAH identified 203 cases of 
dizziness, 191 were reported as non-serious, and 12 reported as serious. Fifty-eight cases report positive 
de-challenge. Seven of these 58 cases contained relevant medical history that can cause dizziness. Of the 
remaining 51 cases, 22 cases reported time to onset (TTO) of 0-2 days, and six of these cases reported no 
concomitant medications. Of the 203 cases, five cases reported positive re-challenge and two further cases 
described events that reoccurred the same day after each dose. The MAH reported the details of these 7 
cases with positive re-challenge. Though the TTO is not clear in all the cases, 4 cases occurred within 1 day. 
The PRAC considered that the short TTO reported in the 48% of the cases (0 – 1 day) is suggestive of a 
possible  causal  relation  between  the  administration  of  UMEC/VI  and  the  event.  The  undesirable  effect 
‘dizziness’  is  known  and  included  with  an  uncommon  frequency  in  the  PI  of  aclidinium,  suggesting  a 
possible  class  effect  for  anticholinergics.  Based  on  the  above  and  also  taking into  account  that  serious 
cases have been reported, a product information (PI) update with regard to the adverse reaction ‘dizziness’ 
is  warranted.  Update  of  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  to  add  ‘dizziness’  with  a  frequency  not  known  is 
recommended. The package leaflet should be updated accordingly.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for umeclidinium bromide / vilanterol the CHMP is of the opinion 
that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal products containing umeclidinium bromide / vilanterol is 
unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisations should be varied.

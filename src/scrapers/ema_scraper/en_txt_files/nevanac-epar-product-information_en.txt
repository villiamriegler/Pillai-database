CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
NEVANAC 1 mg/ml is indicated in adults for: 
- 
- 
Prevention and treatment of postoperative pain and inflammation associated with cataract 
surgery 
Reduction in the risk of postoperative macular oedema associated with cataract surgery in 
diabetic patients (see section 5.1) 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adults, including the elderly 
For the prevention and treatment of pain and inflammation, the dose is 1 drop of NEVANAC in the 
conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) 3 times daily beginning 1 day prior to cataract surgery, 
continued on the day of surgery and for the first 2 weeks of the postoperative period. Treatment can be 
extended to the first 3 weeks of the postoperative period as directed by the clinician. An additional 
drop should be administered 30 to 120 minutes prior to surgery. 
For the reduction in the risk of postoperative macular oedema associated with cataract surgery in 
diabetic patients, the dose is 1 drop of NEVANAC in the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) 
3 times daily beginning 1 day prior to cataract surgery, continued on the day of surgery and up to 
60 days of the postoperative period as directed by the clinician. An additional drop should be 
administered 30 to 120 minutes prior to surgery. 
Special populations 
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
NEVANAC has not been studied in patients with hepatic disease or renal impairment. Nepafenac is 
eliminated primarily through biotransformation and the systemic exposure is very low following 
topical ocular administration. No dose adjustment is warranted in these patients.

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of NEVANAC in children and adolescents have not been established. No data 
are available. Its use is not recommended in these patients until further data become available. 
Geriatric population 
No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger 
patients. 
Method of administration 
For ocular use. 
Patients should be instructed to shake the bottle well before use. After cap is removed, if tamper 
evident snap collar is loose, remove before using product. 
If more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, the medicinal product must be 
administered at least 5 minutes apart. Eye ointments should be administered last. 
To prevent contamination of the dropper tip and solution, care must be taken not to touch the eyelids, 
surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper tip of the bottle. Patients should be instructed to 
keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use. 
If a dose is missed, a single drop should be applied as soon as possible before reverting to regular 
routine. Do not use a double dose to make up for the 1 missed. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypersensitivity to other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 
Patients in whom attacks of asthma, urticaria, or acute rhinitis are precipitated by acetylsalicylic acid 
or other NSAIDs. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The product should not be injected. Patients should be instructed not to swallow NEVANAC. 
Patients should be instructed to avoid sunlight during treatment with NEVANAC. 
Ocular effects 
Use of topical NSAIDs may result in keratitis. In some susceptible patients, continued use of topical 
NSAIDs may result in epithelial breakdown, corneal thinning, corneal erosion, corneal ulceration or 
corneal perforation (see section 4.8). These events may be sight threatening. Patients with evidence of 
corneal epithelial breakdown should immediately discontinue use of NEVANAC and should be 
monitored closely for corneal health. 
Topical NSAIDs may slow or delay healing. Topical corticosteroids are also known to slow or delay 
healing. Concomitant use of topical NSAIDs and topical steroids may increase the potential for 
healing problems. Therefore, it is recommended that caution should be exercised if NEVANAC is 
administered concomitantly with corticosteroids, particularly in patients at high risk for corneal 
adverse reactions described below. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Post-marketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients with complicated ocular 
surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, diabetes mellitus, ocular surface diseases 
(e.g. dry eye syndrome), rheumatoid arthritis or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time 
may be at increased risk for corneal adverse reactions which may become sight threatening. Topical 
NSAIDs should be used with caution in these patients. Prolonged use of topical NSAIDs may increase 
patient risk for occurrence and severity of corneal adverse reactions. 
There have been reports that ophthalmic NSAIDs may cause increased bleeding of ocular tissues 
(including hyphaemas) in conjunction with ocular surgery. NEVANAC should be used with caution in 
patients with known bleeding tendencies or who are receiving other medicinal products which may 
prolong bleeding time. 
An acute ocular infection may be masked by the topical use of anti-inflammatory medicinal products. 
NSAIDs do not have any antimicrobial properties. In case of ocular infection, their use with anti-
infectives should be undertaken with care. 
Contact lenses 
Contact lens wear is not recommended during the postoperative period following cataract surgery. 
Therefore, patients should be advised not to wear contact lenses unless clearly indicated by their 
doctor. 
Benzalkonium chloride 
NEVANAC contains benzalkonium chloride which may cause eye irritation and is known to discolour 
soft contact lenses. If contact lenses need to be used during treatment, patients should be advised to 
remove contact lenses prior to application and wait at least 15 minutes before reinsertion. 
Benzalkonium chloride has been reported to cause punctate keratopathy and/or toxic ulcerative 
keratopathy. Since NEVANAC contains benzalkonium chloride, close monitoring is required with 
frequent or prolonged use. 
Cross-sensitivity 
There is a potential for cross-sensitivity of nepafenac to acetylsalicylic acid, phenylacetic acid 
derivatives, and other NSAIDs. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
In vitro studies have demonstrated a very low potential for interaction with other medicinal products 
and protein binding interactions (see section 5.2). 
Prostaglandin analogues 
There are very limited data on the concomitant use of prostaglandin analogues and NEVANAC. 
Considering their mechanism of action, the concomitant use of these medicinal products is not 
recommended. 
Concomitant use of topical NSAIDs and topical steroids may increase the potential for healing problems. 
Concomitant use of NEVANAC with medications that prolong bleeding time may increase the risk of 
haemorrhage (see section 4.4).

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
NEVANAC should not be used by women of child bearing potential not using contraception. 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data regarding the use of nepafenac in pregnant women. Studies in animals 
have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Since 
the systemic exposure in non-pregnant women is negligible after treatment with NEVANAC, the risk 
during pregnancy could be considered low. Nevertheless, as inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may 
negatively affect pregnancy and/or embryonal/foetal development and/or parturition and/or postnatal 
development. NEVANAC is not recommended during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether nepafenac is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown excretion of 
nepafenac in the milk of rats. However, no effects on the suckling child are anticipated since the 
systemic exposure of the breast-feeding woman to nepafenac is negligible. NEVANAC can be used 
during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effect of NEVANAC on human fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
NEVANAC has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Temporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances may affect the ability to drive or use machines. 
If blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient must wait until the vision clears before driving or 
using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In clinical studies involving 2 314 patients receiving NEVANAC 1 mg/ml the most common adverse 
reactions were punctate keratitis, foreign body sensation and eyelid margin crusting which occurred in 
between 0.4% and 0.2% of patients.

Diabetic patients 
In the two clinical studies involving 209 patients, diabetic patients were exposed to NEVANAC 
treatment for 60 days or greater for the prevention of macular oedema post cataract surgery. The most 
frequently reported adverse reaction was punctate keratitis which occurred in 3% of patients, resulting 
in a frequency category of common. The other reported adverse reactions were corneal epithelium 
defect and allergic dermatitis which occurred in 1% and 0.5% of patients, respectively both adverse 
reactions with a frequency category of uncommon. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Clinical trial experience for the long-term use of NEVANAC for the prevention of macular oedema 
post cataract surgery in diabetic patients is limited. Ocular adverse reactions in diabetic patients may 
occur at a higher frequency than observed in the general population (see section 4.4). 
Patients with evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown including corneal perforation should 
immediately discontinue use of NEVANAC and should be monitored closely for corneal health (see 
section 4.4). 
From post-marketing experience with NEVANAC, cases reporting corneal epithelium defect/disorder 
have been identified. Severity of these cases vary from non serious effects on the epithelial integrity of 
the corneal epithelium to more serious events where surgical interventions and/or medical therapy are 
required to regain clear vision. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Post-marketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients with complicated ocular 
surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, diabetes mellitus, ocular surface diseases (eg, 
dry eye syndrome), rheumatoid arthritis or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time may be 
at increased risk for corneal adverse reactions which may become sight threatening. When nepafenac 
is prescribed to a diabetic patient post cataract surgery to prevent macular oedema, the existence of 
any additional risk factor should lead to reassessment of the foreseen benefit/risk and to intensified 
patient monitoring. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of NEVANAC in children and adolescents have not been established. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No toxic effects are likely to occur in case of overdose with ocular use, nor in the event of accidental 
oral ingestion. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Opthalmologicals, Anti-inflammatory agents, non-steroids, ATC code: 
S01BC10 
Mechanism of action 
Nepafenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and analgesic prodrug. After topical ocular dosing, 
nepafenac penetrates the cornea and is converted by ocular tissue hydrolases to amfenac, a 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Amfenac inhibits the action of prostaglandin H synthase 
(cyclooxygenase), an enzyme required for prostaglandin production. 
Secondary pharmacology 
In rabbits, nepafenac has been shown to inhibit blood-retinal-barrier breakdown, concomitant with 
suppression of PGE2 synthesis. Ex vivo, a single topical ocular dose of nepafenac was shown to inhibit 
prostaglandin synthesis in the iris/ciliary body (85%-95%) and the retina/choroid (55%) for up to 
6 hours and 4 hours, respectively. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The majority of hydrolytic conversion is in the retina/choroid followed by the iris/ciliary body and 
cornea, consistent with the degree of vascularised tissue. 
Results from clinical studies indicate that NEVANAC eye drops have no significant effect on 
intraocular pressure.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Prevention and treatment of postoperative pain and inflammation associated with cataract surgery 
Three pivotal studies were conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of NEVANAC dosed 3 times 
daily as compared to vehicle and/or ketorolac trometamol in the prevention and treatment of 
postoperative pain and inflammation in patients undergoing cataract surgery. In these studies, study 
medication was initiated the day prior to surgery, continued on the day of surgery and for up to 
2-4 weeks of the postoperative period. Additionally, nearly all patients received prophylactic treatment 
with antibiotics, according to clinical practice at each of the clinical trial sites. 
In two double-masked, randomised vehicle-controlled studies, patients treated with NEVANAC had 
significantly less inflammation (aqueous cells and flare) in the early postoperative period through the 
end of treatment than those treated with its vehicle. 
In one double-masked, randomised, vehicle and active-controlled study, patients treated with 
NEVANAC had significantly less inflammation than those treated with vehicle. Additionally, 
NEVANAC was non-inferior to ketorolac 5 mg/ml in reducing inflammation and ocular pain, and was 
slightly more comfortable upon instillation. 
A significantly higher percentage of patients in the NEVANAC group reported no ocular pain 
following cataract surgery compared to those in the vehicle group. 
Reduction in the risk of postoperative macular oedema associated with cataract surgery in diabetic 
patients 
Four studies (two in diabetic patients and two in non-diabetic patients) were conducted to assess the 
efficacy and safety of NEVANAC for the prevention of postoperative macular oedema associated with 
cataract surgery. In these studies, study medication was initiated the day prior to surgery, continued on 
the day of surgery and for up to 90 days of the postoperative period. 
In 1 double-masked, randomised vehicle-controlled study, conducted in diabetic retinopathy patients, a 
significantly greater percentage of patients in the vehicle group developed macular oedema (16.7%) 
compared to patients treated with NEVANAC (3.2%). A greater percentage of patients treated with 
vehicle experienced a decrease in BCVA of more than 5 letters from day 7 to day 90 (or early exit) 
(11.5%) compared with patients treated with nepafenac (5.6%). More patients treated with 
NEVANAC achieved a 15 letter improvement in BCVA compared to vehicle patients, 56.8% 
compared to 41.9%. respectively, p=0.019. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
NEVANAC in all subsets of the paediatric population in prevention and treatment of post operative 
pain and inflammation associated with cataract surgery and prevention of post surgical macular 
oedema (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following 3 times daily dosing of NEVANAC eye drops in both eyes, low but quantifiable plasma 
concentrations of nepafenac and amfenac were observed in the majority of subjects 2 and 3 hours 
post-dose, respectively. The mean steady-state plasma Cmax for nepafenac and for amfenac were 
0.310 ± 0.104 ng/ml and 0.422 ± 0.121 ng/ml, respectively, following ocular administration. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Amfenac has a high affinity toward serum albumin proteins. In vitro, the percent bound to rat albumin, 
human albumin and human serum was 98.4%, 95.4% and 99.1%, respectively. 
Studies in rats have shown that radioactive labelled active substance-related materials distribute 
widely in the body following single and multiple oral doses of 14C-nepafenac. 
Studies in rabbits demonstrated that the topically administered nepafenac is distributed locally from 
the front of the eye to the posterior segments of the eye (retina and choroid). 
Biotransformation 
Nepafenac undergoes relatively rapid bioactivation to amfenac via intraocular hydrolases. 
Subsequently, amfenac undergoes extensive metabolism to more polar metabolites involving 
hydroxylation of the aromatic ring leading to glucuronide conjugate formation. Radiochromatographic 
analyses before and after β-glucuronidase hydrolysis indicated that all metabolites were in the form of 
glucuronide conjugates, with the exception of amfenac. Amfenac was the major metabolite in plasma, 
representing approximately 13% of total plasma radioactivity. The second most abundant plasma 
metabolite was identified as 5-hydroxy nepafenac, representing approximately 9% of total 
radioactivity at Cmax. 
Interactions with other medicinal products: Neither nepafenac nor amfenac inhibit any of the major 
human cytochrome P450 (CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4) metabolic activities in vitro at 
concentrations up to 3 000 ng/ml. Therefore, interactions involving CYP-mediated metabolism of 
concomitantly administered medicinal products are unlikely. Interactions mediated by protein binding 
are also unlikely. 
Elimination 
After oral administration of 14C-nepafenac to healthy volunteers, urinary excretion was found to be the 
major route of radioactive excretions, accounting for approximately 85% while faecal excretion 
represented approximately 6% of the dose. Nepafenac and amfenac were not quantifiable in the urine. 
Following a single dose of NEVANAC in 25 cataract surgery patients, aqueous humour concentrations 
were measured at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes post-dose. The maximum mean aqueous humour 
concentrations were observed at the 1 hour time-point (nepafenac 177 ng/ml, amfenac 44.8 ng/ml). 
These findings indicate rapid corneal penetration. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. 
Nepafenac has not been evaluated in long-term carcinogenicity studies. 
In reproduction studies performed with nepafenac in rats, maternally toxic doses ≥10 mg/kg were 
associated with dystocia, increased postimplantation loss, reduced foetal weights and growth, and 
reduced foetal survival. In pregnant rabbits, a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg that produced slight toxicity 
in the mothers showed a statistically significant increase in the incidence of litter malformations.

Topical NSAIDs may slow or delay healing. Topical corticosteroids are also known to slow or delay 
healing. Concomitant use of topical NSAIDs and topical steroids may increase the potential for 
healing problems. Therefore, it is recommended that caution should be exercised if NEVANAC is 
administered concomitantly with corticosteroids, particularly in patients at high risk for corneal 
adverse reactions described below. 
Post-marketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients with complicated ocular 
surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, diabetes mellitus, ocular surface diseases 
(e.g., dry eye syndrome), rheumatoid arthritis or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time 
may be at increased risk for corneal adverse reactions which may become sight threatening. Topical 
NSAIDs should be used with caution in these patients. Prolonged use of topical NSAIDs may increase 
patient risk for occurrence and severity of corneal adverse reactions. 
There have been reports that ophthalmic NSAIDs may cause increased bleeding of ocular tissues 
(including hyphaemas) in conjunction with ocular surgery. NEVANAC should be used with caution in

Women of childbearing potential 
NEVANAC should not be used by women of child bearing potential not using contraception. 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data regarding the use of nepafenac in pregnant women. Studies in animals 
have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Since 
the systemic exposure in non-pregnant women is negligible after treatment with NEVANAC, the risk 
during pregnancy could be considered low. Nevertheless, as inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may 
negatively affect pregnancy and/or embryonal/foetal development and/or parturition and/or postnatal 
development, NEVANAC is not recommended during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether nepafenac is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown excretion of 
nepafenac in the milk of rats. However, no effects on the suckling child are anticipated since the 
systemic exposure of the breast-feeding woman to nepafenac is negligible. NEVANAC can be used 
during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effect of NEVANAC on human fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
NEVANAC has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Temporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances may affect the ability to drive or use machines. 
If blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient must wait until the vision clears before driving or 
using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In clinical studies involving over 1 900 patients receiving NEVANAC 3 mg/ml eye drops, suspension, 
the most frequently reported adverse reactions were punctate keratitis, keratitis, foreign body sensation 
in eyes and eye pain which occurred in between 0.4% and 0.1% of patients. 
Diabetic patients 
In the two clinical studies involving 594 patients, diabetic patients were exposed to NEVANAC eye 
drops, suspension treatment for 90 days for the prevention of macular oedema post cataract surgery. 
The most frequently reported adverse reaction was punctate keratitis which occurred in 1% of patients, 
resulting in a frequency category of common. The other most frequently reported adverse reactions 
were keratitis and foreign body sensation in eyes which occurred in 0.5% and 0.3% of patients, 
respectively both adverse reactions with a frequency category of uncommon.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions 
Rare: hypersensitivity 
Rare: dizziness, headache 
Uncommon: keratitis, punctate keratitis, corneal 
epithelium defect, foreign body sensation in eyes, 
eyelid margin crusting 
Rare: iritis, choroidal effusion, corneal deposits, eye 
pain, ocular discomfort, dry eye, blepharitis, eye 
irritation, eye pruritus, eye discharge, allergic 
conjunctivitis, increased lacrimation, conjunctival 
hyperaemia 
Not known: corneal perforation, impaired healing 
(cornea), corneal opacity, corneal scar, reduced visual 
acuity, eye swelling, ulcerative keratitis, corneal 
thinning, blurred vision 
Not known: blood pressure increased 
Rare: nausea 
Not known: vomiting 
Rare: cutis laxa (dermatochalasis), allergic dermatitis 
Patients with evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown including corneal perforation should 
immediately discontinue use of NEVANAC and should be monitored closely for corneal health (see 
section 4.4). 
From post-marketing experience with NEVANAC 1 mg/ml eye drops, suspension, cases reporting 
corneal epithelium defect/disorder have been identified. Severity of these cases vary from non serious 
effects on the epithelial integrity of the corneal epithelium to more serious events where surgical 
interventions and/or medical therapy are required to regain clear vision. 
Post-marketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients with complicated ocular 
surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, diabetes mellitus, ocular surface diseases (eg, 
dry eye syndrome), rheumatoid arthritis or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time may be 
at increased risk for corneal adverse reactions which may become sight threatening. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of NEVANAC in children and adolescents have not been established. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, anti-inflammatory agents, non-steroids, ATC code: 
S01BC10 
Mechanism of action 
Nepafenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and analgesic prodrug. After topical ocular dosing, 
nepafenac penetrates the cornea and is converted by ocular tissue hydrolases to amfenac, a 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Amfenac inhibits the action of prostaglandin H synthase 
(cyclooxygenase), an enzyme required for prostaglandin production. 
Secondary pharmacology 
In rabbits, nepafenac has been shown to inhibit blood-retinal-barrier breakdown, concomitant with 
suppression of PGE2 synthesis. Ex vivo, a single topical ocular dose of nepafenac was shown to inhibit 
prostaglandin synthesis in the iris/ciliary body (85%-95%) and the retina/choroid (55%) for up to 
6 hours and 4 hours, respectively. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The majority of hydrolytic conversion is in the retina/choroid followed by the iris/ciliary body and 
cornea, consistent with the degree of vascularised tissue. 
Results from clinical studies indicate that NEVANAC 3 mg/ml eye drops, suspension have no 
significant effect on intraocular pressure. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Prevention and treatment of postoperative pain and inflammation associated with cataract surgery 
The efficacy and safety of NEVANAC 3 mg/ml in the prevention and treatment of postoperative pain 
and inflammation associated with cataract surgery has been demonstrated in two masked, double 
blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in a total of 1 339 patients. In these studies in which patients 
were dosed daily beginning one day prior to cataract surgery, continued on the day of surgery and for 
the first 14 days of the postoperative period, NEVANAC 3 mg/ml eye drops, suspension demonstrated 
superior clinical efficacy compared to its vehicle in treating postoperative pain and inflammation. 
Patients treated with NEVANAC were less likely to have ocular pain and measurable signs of 
inflammation (aqueous cells and flare) in the early postoperative period through to the end of 
treatment than those treated with its vehicle. In the two studies, NEVANAC cleared inflammation at 
day 14 post operation in 65% and 68% of patients compared to 25% and 35% of patients on vehicle. 
Pain free rates in the NEVANAC group were 89% and 91% compared to 40% and 50% of patients on 
vehicle. 
Some patients received NEVANAC 3 mg/ml eye drops, suspension for up to 21 days post operation. 
However, efficacy beyond day 14 post operation was not measured. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, in one of the two clinical trials, NEVANAC 3 mg/ml eye drops, suspension dosed once a 
day was non-inferior to NEVANAC 1 mg/ml eye drops, suspension dosed three times a day for the 
prevention and treatment of postoperative pain and inflammation following cataract surgery. 
Inflammation clearing and pain free rates were similar for both products at all postoperative 
evaluations. 
Reduction in the risk of postoperative macular oedema associated with cataract surgery in diabetic 
patients 
Two studies in diabetic patients were conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of NEVANAC 
3 mg/ml eye drops, suspension dosed once a day for the prevention of postoperative macular oedema 
associated with cataract surgery. In these studies, study medication was initiated the day prior to 
surgery, continued on the day of surgery and for up to 90 days of the postoperative period. 
In both double-masked, randomised vehicle-controlled studies, conducted in diabetic retinopathy 
patients, a significantly greater percentage of patients in the vehicle group developed macular oedema 
(17.3% and 14.3%) compared to patients treated with NEVANAC 3 mg/ml (2.3% and 5.9%). The 
corresponding percentages in integrated analysis of the 2 studies were 15.9% in vehicle group and 
4.1% in NEVANAC group, p<0.001). A significantly greater percentage of patients achieved 
improvement of 15 or more letters at Day 14 and maintained the improvement through Day 90 in 
NEVANAC 3 mg/ml group (61.7%) compared to vehicle group (43%) in one study; the percentage of 
subjects was similar in the 2 treatment groups for this endpoint in the second study (48.8% in 
NEVANAC group and 50.5% in vehicle group). In integrated analysis of the 2 studies, the percentage 
of subjects with 15 letter improvement at Day 14 and maintained to Day 90 was higher in NEVANAC 
3 mg/ml group (55.4%) compared to vehicle group (46.7%, p=0.003). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
NEVANAC in all subsets of the paediatric population in prevention and treatment of post operative 
pain and inflammation associated with cataract surgery (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric 
use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following one drop of NEVANAC 3 mg/ml eye drops, suspension in both eyes once daily for four 
days, low but quantifiable plasma concentrations of nepafenac and amfenac were observed in the 
majority of subjects 2 and 3 hours post-dose, respectively. The mean steady-state plasma Cmax for 
nepafenac and for amfenac were 0.847 ± 0.269 ng/ml and 1.13 ± 0.491 ng/ml, respectively, following 
ocular administration. 
Distribution 
Amfenac has a high affinity toward serum albumin proteins. In vitro, the percent bound to rat albumin, 
human albumin and human serum was 98.4%, 95.4% and 99.1%, respectively. 
Studies in rats have shown that radioactive labelled active substance-related materials distribute 
widely in the body following single and multiple oral doses of 14C-nepafenac. 
Studies in rabbits demonstrated that the topically administered nepafenac is distributed locally from 
the front of the eye to the posterior segments of the eye (retina and choroid). 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
Nepafenac undergoes relatively rapid bioactivation to amfenac via intraocular hydrolases. 
Subsequently, amfenac undergoes extensive metabolism to more polar metabolites involving 
hydroxylation of the aromatic ring leading to glucuronide conjugate formation. 
Radiochromatographic analyses before and after β-glucuronidase hydrolysis indicated that all 
metabolites were in the form of glucuronide conjugates, with the exception of amfenac. Amfenac was 
the major metabolite in plasma, representing approximately 13% of total plasma radioactivity. The 
second most abundant plasma metabolite was identified as 5-hydroxy nepafenac, representing 
approximately 9% of total radioactivity at Cmax. 
Interactions with other medicinal products: Neither nepafenac nor amfenac inhibit any of the major 
human cytochrome P450 (CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4) metabolic activities in vitro at 
concentrations up to 3 000 ng/ml. Therefore, interactions involving CYP-mediated metabolism of 
concomitantly administered medicinal products are unlikely. Interactions mediated by protein binding 
are also unlikely. 
Elimination 
After oral administration of 14C-nepafenac to healthy volunteers, urinary excretion was found to be the 
major route of radioactive excretions, accounting for approximately 85% while faecal excretion 
represented approximately 6% of the dose. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. 
Nepafenac has not been evaluated in long-term carcinogenicity studies. 
In reproduction studies performed with nepafenac in rats, maternally toxic doses ≥10 mg/kg were 
associated with dystocia, increased postimplantation loss, reduced foetal weights and growth, and 
reduced foetal survival. In pregnant rabbits, a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg that produced slight toxicity 
in the mothers showed a statistically significant increase in the incidence of litter malformations.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What NEVANAC is and what it is used for 
NEVANAC contains the active substance nepafenac, and belongs to a group of medicines called 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 
NEVANAC is to be used by adults: 
- 
- 
to prevent and relieve eye pain and inflammation following cataract surgery on the eye 
to reduce the risk of macular oedema (swelling in the back of the eye) following cataract 
surgery on the eye in diabetic patients. 
2.  What you need to know before you use NEVANAC 
Do not use NEVANAC 
- 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to nepafenac or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6), 
if you are allergic to other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) 
if you have experienced asthma, skin allergy, or intense inflammation in your nose when using 
other NSAIDs. Examples of NSAIDs are: acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, piroxicam, 
diclofenac. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using NEVANAC: 
- 
- 
if you bruise easily or have bleeding problems or have had them in the past. 
if you have any other eye disorder (e.g. an eye infection) or if you are using other medicines in 
the eye (especially topical steroids). 
if you have diabetes. 
if you have rheumatoid arthritis. 
if you have had repeated eye surgery within a short period of time. 
- 
- 
- 
Avoid sunlight during treatment with NEVANAC 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Wearing contact lenses is not recommended after cataract surgery. Your doctor will advise you when 
you can use contact lenses again (see also “NEVANAC contains benzalkonium chloride”) 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years old because the safety and 
efficacy in this population has not been established. 
Other medicines and NEVANAC 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
NEVANAC can affect or be affected by other medicines you are using, including other eye drops for 
the treatment of glaucoma. 
Also tell your doctor if you are taking medicines that reduce blood clotting (warfarin) or other 
NSAIDs. They may increase the risk of bleeding. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, or might get pregnant, talk to your doctor before you use NEVANAC. Women 
who may become pregnant are advised to use effective contraception during NEVANAC treatment. 
The use of NEVANAC is not recommended during pregnancy. Do not use NEVANAC unless clearly 
indicated by your doctor. 
If you are breast-feeding, NEVANAC may pass into your milk. However, no effects on breast-fed 
children are anticipated. NEVANAC can be used during breast-feeding. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines until your vision is clear. You may find that your vision is blurred for a 
time just after using NEVANAC. 
NEVANAC contains benzalkonium chloride 
This medicine contains 0.25 mg benzalkonium chloride in each 5 ml which is equivalent to 
0.05 mg/ml. 
The preservative in NEVANAC, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and 
may change the colour of the contact lenses. You should remove contact lenses before using this

Shake well before use. 
Twist off the bottle cap. 
After cap is removed, if tamper evident snap collar is loose, remove before using product. 
Hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and fingers. 
Tilt your head back. 
Pull down your lower eyelid with a clean finger, until there is a ‘pocket’ between the eyelid and 
your eye. The drop will go in here (picture 1). 
Bring the bottle tip close to the eye. Do this in front of a mirror if it helps. 
Do not touch your eye or eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. It could 
infect the drops. 
Gently press on the base of the bottle to release one drop of NEVANAC at a time. 
Do not squeeze the bottle: it is designed so that a gentle press on the bottom is all that it needs 
(picture 2). 
If you use drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for your other eye. Close the bottle cap firmly 
immediately after use. 
If a drop misses your eye, try again. 
If you are using other eye drops, wait at least five minutes between using NEVANAC and the other 
drops. 
If you use more NEVANAC than you should 
Contact your doctor for detailed instructions. Do not put in any more drops until it is time for your 
next regular dose. 
If you forget to use NEVANAC 
Use a single dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, leave out the missed 
dose and continue with the next dose of your regular routine. Do not use a double dose to make up for 
a forgotten dose. Do not use more than one drop in the affected eye(s) 3 times daily. 
If you stop using NEVANAC 
Do not stop using NEVANAC without speaking to your doctor first. You can usually carry on using 
the drops, unless you experience serious side effects. If you are worried talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What NEVANAC is and what it is used for 
NEVANAC contains the active substance nepafenac, and belongs to a group of medicines called non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 
NEVANAC is to be used by adults: 
- 
- 
To prevent and relieve eye pain and inflammation following cataract surgery on the eye. 
To reduce the risk of macular oedema (swelling in the back of the eye) following cataract 
surgery on the eye in diabetic patients. 
2.  What you need to know before you use NEVANAC 
Do not use NEVANAC 
- 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to nepafenac or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
if you are allergic to other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) 
if you have experienced asthma, skin allergy, or intense inflammation in your nose when using 
other NSAIDs. Examples of NSAIDs are: acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, piroxicam, 
diclofenac. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using NEVANAC: 
- 
- 
if you bruise easily or have bleeding problems or have had them in the past 
if you have any other eye disorder (e.g. an eye infection) or if you are using other medicines in 
the eye (especially topical steroids) 
if you have diabetes 
if you have rheumatoid arthritis 
if you have had repeated eye surgery within a short period of time. 
- 
- 
- 
Avoid sunlight during treatment with NEVANAC. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Wearing contact lenses is not recommended after cataract surgery. Your doctor will advise you when 
you can use contact lenses again (see also “NEVANAC contains benzalkonium chloride”). 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years old because the safety and 
efficacy in this population has not been established. 
Other medicines and NEVANAC 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
NEVANAC can affect or be affected by other medicines you are using, including other eye drops for 
the treatment of glaucoma. 
Also tell your doctor if you are taking medicines that reduce blood clotting (warfarin) or other 
NSAIDs. They may increase the risk of bleeding. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, or might get pregnant, talk to your doctor before you use NEVANAC. Women 
who may become pregnant are advised to use effective contraception during NEVANAC treatment. 
The use of NEVANAC is not recommended during pregnancy. Do not use NEVANAC unless clearly 
indicated by your doctor. 
If you are breast-feeding, NEVANAC may pass into your milk. However, no effects on breast-fed 
children are anticipated. NEVANAC can be used during breast-feeding. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines until your vision is clear. You may find that your vision is blurred 
temporarily just after using NEVANAC. 
NEVANAC contains benzalkonium chloride 
This medicine contains 0.15 mg benzalkonium chloride in each 3 ml which is equivalent to 
0.05 mg/ml. 
The preservative in NEVANAC, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and 
may change the colour of the contact lenses. You should remove contact lenses before using this 
medicine and put them back 15 minutes afterwards. Benzalkonium chloride may also cause eye 
irritation, especially if you have dry eyes or disorders of the cornea (the clear layer at the front of the 
eye). If you feel abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain in the eye after using this medicine, talk to 
your doctor.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for avanafil, the scientific conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows:  
Based on the PRAC review of data on safety and efficacy, the PRAC considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of medicinal products containing avanafil remains favourable but recommends that 
the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied as follows: 
Update of section 4.3 and 4.5 of the SmPC to add the contraindication of concomitant administration of 
avanafil with riociguat because of an increased risk of hypotension. The Package leaflet is updated 
accordingly.   
The following changes to the product information of medicinal products containing avanafil are 
recommended (additions are marked in bold and underlined): 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
• 
Section 4.3 
A contraindication should be added as follows: 
The co-administration of PDE5 inhibitors, including avanafil, with guanylate cyclase 
stimulators, such as riociguat is contraindicated as it may potentially lead to symptomatic 
hypotension (see section 4.5). 
• 
Section 4.5 
Effect of avanafil on other medicinal products 
[…] 
Riociguat 
Preclinical studies showed additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5 
inhibitors were combined with riociguat. In clinical studies, riociguat has shown to augment 
the hypotensive effects of PDE5 inhibitors. There was no evidence of favourable clinical 
effect of the combination in the population studied. Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE5, 
including avanafil is contraindicated (see section 4.3).   
Package Leaflet 
Section 2: Do not take SPEDRA if you: 
The following statement should be added: 
- are taking riociguat. This drug is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (i.e., high 
blood pressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e., high 
blood pressure in the lungs secondary to blood clots). PDE5 inhibitors have been shown to 
increase the hypotensive effects of this medicine. If you are taking riociguat or are unsure 
tell your doctor. 
Section 2: Other medicines and SPEDRA: Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are already taking: 
- riociguat.

Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for avanafil the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing avanafil is favourable subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

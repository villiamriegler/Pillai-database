CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Oslif Breezhaler is indicated for maintenance bronchodilator treatment of airflow obstruction in adult 
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose is the inhalation of the content of one 150 microgram capsule once a day, 
using the Oslif Breezhaler inhaler. The dose should only be increased on medical advice. 
The inhalation of the content of one 300 microgram capsule once a day, using the Oslif Breezhaler 
inhaler has been shown to provide additional clinical benefit with regard to breathlessness, particularly 
for patients with severe COPD. The maximum dose is 300 microgram once daily. 
Oslif Breezhaler should be administered at the same time of the day each day. 
If a dose is missed the next dose should be taken at the usual time the next day. 
Special populations 
Elderly population 
Maximum plasma concentration and overall systemic exposure increase with age but no dose 
adjustment is required in elderly patients. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. There are no 
data available for use of Oslif Breezhaler in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Oslif Breezhaler in the paediatric population (under 18 years). 
Method of administration 
For inhalation use only. Oslif Breezhaler capsules must not be swallowed. 
The capsules must only be removed from the blister immediately before use. 
The capsules must be administered only using the Oslif Breezhaler inhaler (see section 6.6). The Oslif 
Breezhaler inhaler provided with each new prescription should be used. 
Patients should be instructed on how to administer the product correctly. Patients who do not 
experience improvement in breathing should be asked if they are swallowing the medicine rather than 
inhaling it. 
For instructions on use of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Asthma 
Oslif Breezhaler is a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist, which is only indicated for COPD and 
should not be used in asthma due to the absence of long-term outcome data in asthma. 
Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists may increase the risk of asthma-related serious adverse events, 
including asthma-related deaths, when used for the treatment of asthma. 
Hypersensitivity 
Immediate hypersensitivity reactions have been reported after administration of Oslif Breezhaler. If 
signs suggesting allergic reactions (in particular, difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of 
tongue, lips and face, urticaria, skin rash) occur, Oslif Breezhaler should be discontinued immediately 
and alternative therapy instituted. 
Paradoxical bronchospasm 
As with other inhalation therapy, administration of Oslif Breezhaler may result in paradoxical 
bronchospasm that may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs Oslif Breezhaler 
should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy substituted. 
Deterioration of disease 
Oslif Breezhaler is not indicated for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm, i.e. as rescue 
therapy. In the event of deterioration of COPD during treatment with Oslif Breezhaler, a re-evaluation 
of the patient and of the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken. An increase in the daily dose 
of Oslif Breezhaler beyond the maximum dose of 300 microgram is not appropriate.

Systemic effects 
Although no clinically relevant effect on the cardiovascular system is usually seen after the 
administration of Oslif Breezhaler at the recommended doses, as with other beta2-adrenergic agonists, 
indacaterol should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders (coronary artery 
disease, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension), in patients with convulsive 
disorders or thyrotoxicosis, and in patients who are unusually responsive to beta2-adrenergic agonists. 
Cardiovascular effects 
Like other beta2-adrenergic agonists, indacaterol may produce a clinically significant cardiovascular 
effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. In 
case such effects occur, treatment may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-adrenergic agonists 
have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, 
prolongation of QT interval and ST segment depression, although the clinical significance of these 
observations is unknown. Therefore, long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA) or LABA 
containing products such as Oslif Breezhaler should be used with caution in patients with known or 
suspected prolongation of the QT interval or treated with medicinal products affecting the QT interval. 
Hypokalaemia 
Beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalaemia in some patients, which has the 
potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually 
transient, not requiring supplementation. In patients with severe COPD, hypokalaemia may be 
potentiated by hypoxia and concomitant treatment (see section 4.5), which may increase the 
susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias. 
Hyperglycaemia 
Inhalation of high doses of beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce increases in plasma glucose. Upon 
initiation of treatment with Oslif Breezhaler plasma glucose should be monitored more closely in 
diabetic patients. 
During clinical studies, clinically notable changes in blood glucose were generally more frequent by 
1-2% on Oslif Breezhaler at the recommended doses than on placebo. Oslif Breezhaler has not been 
investigated in patients with not well controlled diabetes mellitus. 
Excipients 
The capsules contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Sympathomimetic medicinal products 
Concomitant administration of other sympathomimetic medicinal products (alone or as part of 
combination therapy) may potentiate adverse reactions to Oslif Breezhaler. 
Oslif Breezhaler should not be used in conjunction with other long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists or 
medicinal products containing long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists. 
Hypokalaemic treatment 
Concomitant hypokalaemic treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids, or non-potassium-
sparing diuretics may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of beta2-adrenergic agonists, 
therefore caution is required (see section 4.4). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Beta-adrenergic blockers 
Beta-adrenergic blockers and beta2-adrenergic agonists may weaken or antagonise the effect of each 
other when administered concurrently. Therefore indacaterol should not be given together with beta-
adrenergic blockers (including eye drops) unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Where 
required, cardioselective beta-adrenergic blockers should be preferred, although they should be 
administered with caution. 
Metabolic and transporter based interactions 
Inhibition of the key contributors of indacaterol clearance, CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) raises 
the systemic exposure of indacaterol by up to two-fold. The magnitude of exposure increases due to 
interactions does not raise any safety concerns given the safety experience of treatment with Oslif 
Breezhaler in clinical studies of up to one year at doses up to twice the maximum recommended 
therapeutic dose. 
Indacaterol has not been shown to cause interactions with medicinal products administered 
concomitantly. In vitro investigations have indicated that indacaterol has negligible potential to cause 
metabolic interactions with medicinal products at the systemic exposure levels achieved in clinical 
practice. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of indacaterol in pregnant women available. Animal studies do not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity at clinically relevant 
exposures (see section 5.3). Like other beta2-adrenergic agonists, indacaterol may inhibit labour due to 
a relaxant effect on uterine smooth muscle. Oslif Breezhaler should only be used during pregnancy if 
the expected benefits outweigh the potential risks. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether indacaterol/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available 
pharmacokinetic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of indacaterol/metabolites in milk 
(see section 5.3). A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether 
to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Oslif Breezhaler therapy, taking into 
account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
A decreased pregnancy rate has been observed in rats. Nevertheless, it is considered unlikely that 
indacaterol will affect reproductive or fertility performance in humans following inhalation of the 
maximum recommended dose (see section 5.3).

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Oslif Breezhaler has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions at the recommended doses were nasopharyngitis (14.3%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (14.2%), cough (8.2%), headache (3.7%) and muscle spasms (3.5%). These 
were in the vast majority mild or moderate and became less frequent if treatment was continued. 
At the recommended doses, the adverse reaction profile of Oslif Breezhaler in patients with COPD 
shows clinically insignificant systemic effects of beta2-adrenergic stimulation. Mean heart rate 
changes were less than one beat per minute, and tachycardia was infrequent and reported at a similar 
rate as under placebo treatment. Relevant prolongations of QTcF were not detectable in comparison to 
placebo. The frequency of notable QTcF intervals [i.e. >450 ms (males) and >470 ms (females)] and 
reports of hypokalaemia were similar to placebo. The mean of the maximum changes in blood glucose 
were similar between Oslif Breezhaler and placebo. 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
The Oslif Breezhaler Phase III clinical development programme involved patients with a clinical 
diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD. 4,764 patients were exposed to indacaterol up to one year at 
doses up to twice the maximum recommended dose. Of these patients, 2,611 were on treatment with 
150 microgram once daily and 1,157 on treatment with 300 microgram once daily. Approximately 
41% of patients had severe COPD. The mean age of patients was 64 years, with 48% of patients aged 
65 years or older, and the majority (80%) was Caucasian. 
Adverse reactions in Table 1 are listed according to MedDRA system organ class in the COPD safety 
database. Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are ranked by frequency in descending 
order according to the following convention: Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data).

1 Reports of hypersensitivity have been received from post-approval marketing experience in 
association with the use of Oslif Breezhaler. These were reported voluntarily from a population of 
uncertain size, and it is therefore not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a 
causal relationship to exposure to the medicinal product. Therefore the frequency was calculated from 
clinical trial experience. 
At 600 microgram once-daily, the safety profile of Oslif Breezhaler was overall similar to that of 
recommended doses. An additional adverse reaction was tremor (common). 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
In Phase III clinical studies, healthcare providers observed during clinic visits that on average 17-20% 
of patients experienced a sporadic cough that occurred usually within 15 seconds following inhalation 
and typically lasted for 5 seconds (about 10 seconds in current smokers). It was observed with a higher 
frequency in female than in male patients and in current smokers than in ex-smokers. This cough 
experienced post inhalation did not lead to any patient discontinuing from the studies at the 
recommended doses (cough is a symptom in COPD and only 8.2% of patients reported cough as an 
adverse event). There is no evidence that cough experienced post inhalation is associated with 
bronchospasm, exacerbations, deteriorations of disease or loss of efficacy. 
7 
 
 
 
 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In COPD patients, single doses of 10 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose were 
associated with a moderate increase in pulse rate, systolic blood pressure and QTc interval. 
An overdose of indacaterol is likely to lead to exaggerated effects typical of beta2-adrenergic 
stimulants, i.e. tachycardia, tremor, palpitations, headache, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, ventricular 
arrhythmias, metabolic acidosis, hypokalaemia and hyperglycaemia. 
Supportive and symptomatic treatment is indicated. In serious cases, patients should be hospitalised. 
Use of cardioselective beta blockers may be considered, but only under the supervision of a physician 
and with extreme caution since the use of beta-adrenergic blockers may provoke bronchospasm.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airways diseases, selective beta-2-adrenoreceptor 
agonists, ATC code: R03AC18 
Mechanism of action 
The pharmacological effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonists are at least in part attributable to 
stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3’, 5’-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic monophosphate). Increased 
cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. In vitro studies have shown that 
indacaterol, a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist, has more than 24-fold greater agonist activity at 
beta2-receptors compared to beta1-receptors and 20-fold greater agonist activity compared to beta3-
receptors. 
When inhaled, indacaterol acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. Indacaterol is a partial agonist 
at the human beta2-adrenergic receptor with nanomolar potency. In isolated human bronchus, 
indacaterol has a rapid onset of action and a long duration of action. 
Although beta2-receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and 
beta1-receptors are the predominant receptors in the human heart, there are also beta2-adrenergic 
receptors in the human heart comprising 10-50% of the total adrenergic receptors. The precise 
function of beta2-adrenergic receptors in the heart is not known, but their presence raises the 
possibility that even highly selective beta2-adrenergic agonists may have cardiac effects.

Pharmacodynamic effects 
Oslif Breezhaler, administered once a day at doses of 150 and 300 microgram consistently provided 
clinically significant improvements in lung function (as measured by the forced expiratory volume in 
one second, FEV1) over 24 hours across a number of clinical pharmacodynamic and efficacy studies. 
There was a rapid onset of action within 5 minutes after inhalation, with an increase in FEV1 relative 
to baseline of 110-160 ml, comparable to the effect of the fast-acting beta2-agonist salbutamol 
200 microgram and statistically significantly faster compared to salmeterol/fluticasone 
50/500 microgram. Mean peak improvements in FEV1 relative to baseline were 250-330 ml at steady 
state. 
The bronchodilator effect did not depend on the time of dosing, morning or evening. 
Oslif Breezhaler was shown to reduce lung hyperinflation, resulting in increased inspiratory capacity 
during exercise and at rest, compared to placebo. 
Effects on cardiac electrophysiology 
A double-blind, placebo- and active (moxifloxacin)-controlled study for 2 weeks in 404 healthy 
volunteers demonstrated maximum mean (90% confidence intervals) prolongations of the QTcF 
interval (in milliseconds) of 2.66 (0.55, 4.77) 2.98 (1.02, 4.93) and 3.34 (0.86, 5.82) following 
multiple doses of 150 microgram, 300 microgram and 600 microgram, respectively. There was no 
evidence of a concentration-delta QTc relationship in the range of doses evaluated. 
As demonstrated in 605 patients with COPD in a 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III 
study, there was no clinically relevant difference in the development of arrhythmic events monitored 
over 24 hours, at baseline and up to 3 times during the 26-week treatment period, between patients 
receiving recommended doses of Oslif Breezhaler treatment and those patients who received placebo 
or treatment with tiotropium. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The clinical development programme included one 12-week, two six-month (one of which was 
extended to one year to evaluate safety and tolerability) and one one-year randomised controlled 
studies in patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD. These studies included measures of lung 
function and of health outcomes such as dyspnoea, exacerbations and health-related quality of life. 
Lung function 
Oslif Breezhaler, administered once a day at doses of 150 microgram and 300 microgram, showed 
clinically meaningful improvements in lung function. At the 12-week primary endpoint (24-hour 
trough FEV1), the 150 microgram dose resulted in a 130-180 ml increase compared to placebo 
(p<0.001) and a 60 ml increase compared to salmeterol 50 microgram twice a day (p<0.001). The 
300 microgram dose resulted in a 170-180 ml increase compared to placebo (p<0.001) and a 100 ml 
increase compared to formoterol 12 microgram twice a day (p<0.001). Both doses resulted in an 
increase of 40-50 ml over open-label tiotropium 18 microgram once a day (150 microgram, p=0.004; 
300 microgram, p=0.01). The 24-hour bronchodilator effect of Oslif Breezhaler was maintained from 
the first dose throughout a one-year treatment period with no evidence of loss in efficacy 
(tachyphylaxis). 
Symptomatic benefits 
Both doses demonstrated statistically significant improvements in symptom relief over placebo for 
dyspnoea and health status (as evaluated by Transitional Dyspnoea Index [TDI] and St. George’s 
Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ], respectively). The magnitude of response was generally greater 
than seen with active comparators (Table 2). In addition, patients treated with Oslif Breezhaler 
required significantly less rescue medication, had more days when no rescue medication was needed 
compared to placebo and had a significantly improved percentage of days with no daytime symptoms. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pooled efficacy analysis over 6 months’ treatment demonstrated that the rate of COPD exacerbations 
was statistically significantly lower than the placebo rate. Treatment comparison compared to placebo 
showed a ratio of rates of 0.68 (95% CI [ 0.47, 0.98]; p-value 0.036) and 0.74 (95% CI [0.56, 0.96]; p-
value 0.026) for 150 microgram and 300 microgram, respectively. 
Limited treatment experience is available in individuals of African descent.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Oslif 
Breezhaler in all subsets of the paediatric population in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Indacaterol is a chiral molecule with R-configuration. 
Pharmacokinetic data were obtained from a number of clinical studies, from healthy volunteers and 
COPD patients. 
Absorption 
The median time to reach peak serum concentrations of indacaterol was approximately 15 min after 
single or repeated inhaled doses. Systemic exposure to indacaterol increased with increasing dose 
(150 microgram to 600 microgram) in a dose proportional manner. Absolute bioavailability of 
indacaterol after an inhaled dose was on average 43% to 45%. Systemic exposure results from a 
composite of pulmonary and gastrointestinal absorption; about 75% of systemic exposure was from 
pulmonary absorption and about 25% from gastrointestinal absorption. 
Indacaterol serum concentrations increased with repeated once-daily administration. Steady state was 
achieved within 12 to 14 days. The mean accumulation ratio of indacaterol, i.e. AUC over the 24-h 
dosing interval on Day 14 compared to Day 1, was in the range of 2.9 to 3.5 for once-daily inhaled 
doses between 150 microgram and 600 microgram.

Distribution 
After intravenous infusion the volume of distribution of indacaterol during the terminal elimination 
phase was 2557 litres indicating an extensive distribution. The in vitro human serum and plasma 
protein binding was 94.1-95.3% and 95.1-96.2%, respectively. 
Biotransformation 
After oral administration of radiolabelled indacaterol in a human ADME (absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, excretion) study, unchanged indacaterol was the main component in serum, accounting 
for about one third of total drug-related AUC over 24 hours. A hydroxylated derivative was the most 
prominent metabolite in serum. Phenolic O-glucuronides of indacaterol and hydroxylated indacaterol 
were further prominent metabolites. A diastereomer of the hydroxylated derivative, a N-glucuronide of 
indacaterol, and C- and N-dealkylated products were further metabolites identified. 
In vitro investigations indicated that UGT1A1 is the only UGT isoform that metabolised indacaterol to 
the phenolic O-glucuronide. The oxidative metabolites were found in incubations with recombinant 
CYP1A1, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. CYP3A4 is concluded to be the predominant isoenzyme 
responsible for hydroxylation of indacaterol. In vitro investigations further indicated that indacaterol is 
a low affinity substrate for the efflux pump P-gp. 
Elimination 
In clinical studies which included urine collection, the amount of indacaterol excreted unchanged via 
urine was generally lower than 2% of the dose. Renal clearance of indacaterol was, on average, 
between 0.46 and 1.20 litres/hour. When compared with the serum clearance of indacaterol of 
23.3 litres/hour, it is evident that renal clearance plays a minor role (about 2 to 5% of systemic 
clearance) in the elimination of systemically available indacaterol. 
In a human ADME study where indacaterol was given orally, the faecal route of excretion was 
dominant over the urinary route. Indacaterol was excreted into human faeces primarily as unchanged 
parent substance (54% of the dose) and, to a lesser extent, hydroxylated indacaterol metabolites (23% 
of the dose). Mass balance was complete with ≥90% of the dose recovered in the excreta. 
Indacaterol serum concentrations declined in a multi-phasic manner with an average terminal half-life 
ranging from 45.5 to 126 hours. The effective half-life, calculated from the accumulation of 
indacaterol after repeated dosing ranged from 40 to 52 hours which is consistent with the observed 
time-to-steady state of approximately 12-14 days. 
Special populations 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there is no clinically relevant effect of age (adults 
up to 88 years), sex, weight (32-168 kg) or race on the pharmacokinetics of indacaterol. It did not 
suggest any difference between ethnic subgroups in this population. 
Patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment showed no relevant changes in C max or AUC of 
indacaterol, nor did protein binding differ between mild and moderate hepatic impaired subjects and 
their healthy controls. Studies in subjects with severe hepatic impairment were not performed. 
Due to the very low contribution of the urinary pathway to total body elimination, a study in renally 
impaired subjects was not performed.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Effects on the cardiovascular system attributable to the beta2-agonistic properties of indacaterol 
included tachycardia, arrhythmias and myocardial lesions in dogs. Mild irritancy of the nasal cavity 
and larynx were seen in rodents. All these findings occurred at exposures sufficiently in excess of 
those anticipated in humans. 
Although indacaterol did not affect general reproductive performance in a rat fertility study, a decrease 
in the number of pregnant F1 offspring was observed in the peri- and post-developmental rat study at 
an exposure 14-fold higher than in humans treated with Oslif Breezhaler. Indacaterol was not 
embryotoxic or teratogenic in rats or rabbits. 
Genotoxicity studies did not reveal any mutagenic or clastogenic potential. Carcinogenicity was 
assessed in a two-year rat study and a six-month transgenic mouse study. Increased incidences of 
benign ovarian leiomyoma and focal hyperplasia of ovarian smooth muscle in rats were consistent 
with similar findings reported for other beta2-adrenergic agonists. No evidence of carcinogenicity was 
seen in mice. Systemic exposures (AUC) in rats and mice at the no-observed adverse effect levels in 
these studies were at least 7- and 49-fold higher, respectively, than in humans treated with Oslif 
Breezhaler once a day at a dose of 300 microgram.

Frequently Asked 
Questions 
Why didn’t the inhaler 
make a noise when I 
inhaled? 
The capsule may be stuck 
in the capsule chamber. If 
this happens, carefully 
loosen the capsule by 
tapping the base of the 
inhaler. Inhale the 
medicine again by 
repeating steps 3a to 3c. 
What should I do if there 
is powder left inside the 
capsule? 
You have not received 
enough of your medicine. 
Close the inhaler and 
repeat steps 3a to 3c. 
I coughed after inhaling 
– does this matter? 
This may happen. As long 
as the capsule is empty 
you have received enough 
of your medicine. 
I felt small pieces of the 
capsule on my tongue – 
does this matter? 
This can happen. It is not 
harmful. The chances of 
the capsule breaking into 
small pieces will be 
increased if the capsule is 
pierced more than once.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Oslif Breezhaler is indicated for maintenance bronchodilator treatment of airflow obstruction in adult 
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose is the inhalation of the content of one 150 microgram capsule once a day, 
using the Oslif Breezhaler inhaler. The dose should only be increased on medical advice. 
The inhalation of the content of one 300 microgram capsule once a day, using the Oslif Breezhaler 
inhaler has been shown to provide additional clinical benefit with regard to breathlessness, particularly 
for patients with severe COPD. The maximum dose is 300 microgram once daily. 
Oslif Breezhaler should be administered at the same time of the day each day. 
If a dose is missed the next dose should be taken at the usual time the next day. 
Special populations 
Elderly population 
Maximum plasma concentration and overall systemic exposure increase with age but no dose 
adjustment is required in elderly patients. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. There are no 
data available for use of Oslif Breezhaler in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Oslif Breezhaler in the paediatric population (under 18 years). 
Method of administration 
For inhalation use only. Oslif Breezhaler capsules must not be swallowed. 
The capsules must only be removed from the blister immediately before use. 
The capsules must be administered only using the Oslif Breezhaler inhaler (see section 6.6). The Oslif 
Breezhaler inhaler provided with each new prescription should be used. 
Patients should be instructed on how to administer the product correctly. Patients who do not 
experience improvement in breathing should be asked if they are swallowing the medicine rather than 
inhaling it. 
For instructions on use of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Asthma 
Oslif Breezhaler is a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist, which is only indicated for COPD and 
should not be used in asthma due to the absence of long-term outcome data in asthma. 
Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists may increase the risk of asthma-related serious adverse events, 
including asthma-related deaths, when used for the treatment of asthma. 
Hypersensitivity 
Immediate hypersensitivity reactions have been reported after administration of Oslif Breezhaler. If 
signs suggesting allergic reactions (in particular, difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of 
tongue, lips and face, urticaria, skin rash) occur, Oslif Breezhaler should be discontinued immediately 
and alternative therapy instituted. 
Paradoxical bronchospasm 
As with other inhalation therapy, administration of Oslif Breezhaler may result in paradoxical 
bronchospasm that may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs Oslif Breezhaler 
should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy substituted. 
Deterioration of disease 
Oslif Breezhaler is not indicated for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm, i.e. as rescue 
therapy. In the event of deterioration of COPD during treatment with Oslif Breezhaler, a re-evaluation 
of the patient and of the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken. An increase in the daily dose 
of Oslif Breezhaler beyond the maximum dose of 300 microgram is not appropriate.

Systemic effects 
Although no clinically relevant effect on the cardiovascular system is usually seen after the 
administration of Oslif Breezhaler at the recommended doses, as with other beta2-adrenergic agonists, 
indacaterol should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders (coronary artery 
disease, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension), in patients with convulsive 
disorders or thyrotoxicosis, and in patients who are unusually responsive to beta2-adrenergic agonists. 
Cardiovascular effects 
Like other beta2-adrenergic agonists, indacaterol may produce a clinically significant cardiovascular 
effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. In 
case such effects occur, treatment may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-adrenergic agonists 
have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, 
prolongation of QT interval and ST segment depression, although the clinical significance of these 
observations is unknown. Therefore, long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA) or LABA 
containing products such as Oslif Breezhaler should be used with caution in patients with known or 
suspected prolongation of the QT interval or treated with medicinal products affecting the QT interval. 
Hypokalaemia 
Beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalaemia in some patients, which has the 
potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually 
transient, not requiring supplementation. In patients with severe COPD, hypokalaemia may be 
potentiated by hypoxia and concomitant treatment (see section 4.5), which may increase the 
susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias. 
Hyperglycaemia 
Inhalation of high doses of beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce increases in plasma glucose. Upon 
initiation of treatment with Oslif Breezhaler plasma glucose should be monitored more closely in 
diabetic patients. 
During clinical studies, clinically notable changes in blood glucose were generally more frequent by 
1-2% on Oslif Breezhaler at the recommended doses than on placebo. Oslif Breezhaler has not been 
investigated in patients with not well controlled diabetes mellitus. 
Excipients 
The capsules contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Sympathomimetic medicinal products 
Concomitant administration of other sympathomimetic medicinal products (alone or as part of 
combination therapy) may potentiate adverse reactions to Oslif Breezhaler. 
Oslif Breezhaler should not be used in conjunction with other long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists or 
medicinal products containing long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists. 
Hypokalaemic treatment 
Concomitant hypokalaemic treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids, or non-potassium-
sparing diuretics may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of beta2-adrenergic agonists, 
therefore caution is required (see section 4.4). 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Beta-adrenergic blockers 
Beta-adrenergic blockers and beta2-adrenergic agonists may weaken or antagonise the effect of each 
other when administered concurrently. Therefore indacaterol should not be given together with beta-
adrenergic blockers (including eye drops) unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Where 
required, cardioselective beta-adrenergic blockers should be preferred, although they should be 
administered with caution. 
Metabolic and transporter based interactions 
Inhibition of the key contributors of indacaterol clearance, CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) raises 
the systemic exposure of indacaterol by up to two-fold. The magnitude of exposure increases due to 
interactions does not raise any safety concerns given the safety experience of treatment with Oslif 
Breezhaler in clinical studies of up to one year at doses up to twice the maximum recommended 
therapeutic dose. 
Indacaterol has not been shown to cause interactions with medicinal products administered 
concomitantly. In vitro investigations have indicated that indacaterol has negligible potential to cause 
metabolic interactions with medicinal products at the systemic exposure levels achieved in clinical 
practice. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of indacaterol in pregnant women available. Animal studies do not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity at clinically relevant 
exposures (see section 5.3). Like other beta2-adrenergic agonists, indacaterol may inhibit labour due to 
a relaxant effect on uterine smooth muscle. Oslif Breezhaler should only be used during pregnancy if 
the expected benefits outweigh the potential risks. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether indacaterol/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available 
pharmacokinetic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of indacaterol/metabolites in milk 
(see section 5.3). A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether 
to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Oslif Breezhaler therapy, taking into 
account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
A decreased pregnancy rate has been observed in rats. Nevertheless, it is considered unlikely that 
indacaterol will affect reproductive or fertility performance in humans following inhalation of the 
maximum recommended dose (see section 5.3).

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Oslif Breezhaler has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions at the recommended doses were nasopharyngitis (14.3%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (14.2%), cough (8.2%), headache (3.7%) and muscle spasms (3.5%). These 
were in the vast majority mild or moderate and became less frequent if treatment was continued. 
At the recommended doses, the adverse reaction profile of Oslif Breezhaler in patients with COPD 
shows clinically insignificant systemic effects of beta2-adrenergic stimulation. Mean heart rate 
changes were less than one beat per minute, and tachycardia was infrequent and reported at a similar 
rate as under placebo treatment. Relevant prolongations of QTcF were not detectable in comparison to 
placebo. The frequency of notable QTcF intervals [i.e. >450 ms (males) and >470 ms (females)] and 
reports of hypokalaemia were similar to placebo. The mean of the maximum changes in blood glucose 
were similar between Oslif Breezhaler and placebo. 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
The Oslif Breezhaler Phase III clinical development programme involved patients with a clinical 
diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD. 4,764 patients were exposed to indacaterol up to one year at 
doses up to twice the maximum recommended dose. Of these patients, 2,611 were on treatment with 
150 microgram once daily and 1,157 on treatment with 300 microgram once daily. Approximately 
41% of patients had severe COPD. The mean age of patients was 64 years, with 48% of patients aged 
65 years or older, and the majority (80%) was Caucasian. 
Adverse reactions in Table 1 are listed according to MedDRA system organ class in the COPD safety 
database. Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are ranked by frequency in descending 
order according to the following convention: Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data).

1 Reports of hypersensitivity have been received from post-approval marketing experience in 
association with the use of Oslif Breezhaler. These were reported voluntarily from a population of 
uncertain size, and it is therefore not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a 
causal relationship to exposure to the medicinal product. Therefore the frequency was calculated from 
clinical trial experience. 
At 600 microgram once-daily, the safety profile of Oslif Breezhaler was overall similar to that of 
recommended doses. An additional adverse reaction was tremor (common). 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
In Phase III clinical studies, healthcare providers observed during clinic visits that on average 17-20% 
of patients experienced a sporadic cough that occurred usually within 15 seconds following inhalation 
and typically lasted for 5 seconds (about 10 seconds in current smokers). It was observed with a higher 
frequency in female than in male patients and in current smokers than in ex-smokers. This cough 
experienced post inhalation did not lead to any patient discontinuing from the studies at the 
recommended doses (cough is a symptom in COPD and only 8.2% of patients reported cough as an 
adverse event). There is no evidence that cough experienced post inhalation is associated with 
bronchospasm, exacerbations, deteriorations of disease or loss of efficacy. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In COPD patients, single doses of 10 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose were 
associated with a moderate increase in pulse rate, systolic blood pressure and QTc interval. 
An overdose of indacaterol is likely to lead to exaggerated effects typical of beta2-adrenergic 
stimulants, i.e. tachycardia, tremor, palpitations, headache, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, ventricular 
arrhythmias, metabolic acidosis, hypokalaemia and hyperglycaemia. 
Supportive and symptomatic treatment is indicated. In serious cases, patients should be hospitalised. 
Use of cardioselective beta blockers may be considered, but only under the supervision of a physician 
and with extreme caution since the use of beta-adrenergic blockers may provoke bronchospasm.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airways diseases, selective beta-2-adrenoreceptor 
agonists, ATC code: R03AC18 
Mechanism of action 
The pharmacological effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonists are at least in part attributable to 
stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3’, 5’-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic monophosphate). Increased 
cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. In vitro studies have shown that 
indacaterol, a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist, has more than 24-fold greater agonist activity at 
beta2-receptors compared to beta1-receptors and 20-fold greater agonist activity compared to beta3-
receptors. 
When inhaled, indacaterol acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. Indacaterol is a partial agonist 
at the human beta2-adrenergic receptor with nanomolar potency. In isolated human bronchus, 
indacaterol has a rapid onset of action and a long duration of action. 
Although beta2-receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and 
beta1-receptors are the predominant receptors in the human heart, there are also beta2-adrenergic 
receptors in the human heart comprising 10-50% of the total adrenergic receptors. The precise 
function of beta2-adrenergic receptors in the heart is not known, but their presence raises the 
possibility that even highly selective beta2-adrenergic agonists may have cardiac effects. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Oslif Breezhaler, administered once a day at doses of 150 and 300 microgram consistently provided 
clinically significant improvements in lung function (as measured by the forced expiratory volume in 
one second, FEV1) over 24 hours across a number of clinical pharmacodynamic and efficacy studies. 
There was a rapid onset of action within 5 minutes after inhalation, with an increase in FEV1 relative 
to baseline of 110-160 ml, comparable to the effect of the fast-acting beta2-agonist salbutamol 
200 microgram and statistically significantly faster compared to salmeterol/fluticasone 
50/500 microgram. Mean peak improvements in FEV1 relative to baseline were 250-330 ml at steady 
state. 
The bronchodilator effect did not depend on the time of dosing, morning or evening. 
Oslif Breezhaler was shown to reduce lung hyperinflation, resulting in increased inspiratory capacity 
during exercise and at rest, compared to placebo. 
Effects on cardiac electrophysiology 
A double-blind, placebo- and active (moxifloxacin)-controlled study for 2 weeks in 404 healthy 
volunteers demonstrated maximum mean (90% confidence intervals) prolongations of the QTcF 
interval (in milliseconds) of 2.66 (0.55, 4.77) 2.98 (1.02, 4.93) and 3.34 (0.86, 5.82) following 
multiple doses of 150 microgram, 300 microgram and 600 microgram, respectively. There was no 
evidence of a concentration-delta QTc relationship in the range of doses evaluated. 
As demonstrated in 605 patients with COPD in a 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III 
study, there was no clinically relevant difference in the development of arrhythmic events monitored 
over 24 hours, at baseline and up to 3 times during the 26-week treatment period, between patients 
receiving recommended doses of Oslif Breezhaler treatment and those patients who received placebo 
or treatment with tiotropium. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The clinical development programme included one 12-week, two six-month (one of which was 
extended to one year to evaluate safety and tolerability) and one one-year randomised controlled 
studies in patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD. These studies included measures of lung 
function and of health outcomes such as dyspnoea, exacerbations and health-related quality of life. 
Lung function 
Oslif Breezhaler, administered once a day at doses of 150 microgram and 300 microgram, showed 
clinically meaningful improvements in lung function. At the 12-week primary endpoint (24-hour 
trough FEV1), the 150 microgram dose resulted in a 130-180 ml increase compared to placebo 
(p<0.001) and a 60 ml increase compared to salmeterol 50 microgram twice a day (p<0.001). The 
300 microgram dose resulted in a 170-180 ml increase compared to placebo (p<0.001) and a 100 ml 
increase compared to formoterol 12 microgram twice a day (p<0.001). Both doses resulted in an 
increase of 40-50 ml over open-label tiotropium 18 microgram once a day (150 microgram, p=0.004; 
300 microgram, p=0.01). The 24-hour bronchodilator effect of Oslif Breezhaler was maintained from 
the first dose throughout a one-year treatment period with no evidence of loss in efficacy 
(tachyphylaxis). 
Symptomatic benefits 
Both doses demonstrated statistically significant improvements in symptom relief over placebo for 
dyspnoea and health status (as evaluated by Transitional Dyspnoea Index [TDI] and St. George’s 
Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ], respectively). The magnitude of response was generally greater 
than seen with active comparators (Table 2). In addition, patients treated with Oslif Breezhaler 
required significantly less rescue medication, had more days when no rescue medication was needed 
compared to placebo and had a significantly improved percentage of days with no daytime symptoms. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pooled efficacy analysis over 6 months’ treatment demonstrated that the rate of COPD exacerbations 
was statistically significantly lower than the placebo rate. Treatment comparison compared to placebo 
showed a ratio of rates of 0.68 (95% CI [ 0.47, 0.98]; p-value 0.036) and 0.74 (95% CI [0.56, 0.96]; p-
value 0.026) for 150 microgram and 300 microgram, respectively. 
Limited treatment experience is available in individuals of African descent.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Oslif 
Breezhaler in all subsets of the paediatric population in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Indacaterol is a chiral molecule with R-configuration. 
Pharmacokinetic data were obtained from a number of clinical studies, from healthy volunteers and 
COPD patients. 
Absorption 
The median time to reach peak serum concentrations of indacaterol was approximately 15 min after 
single or repeated inhaled doses. Systemic exposure to indacaterol increased with increasing dose 
(150 microgram to 600 microgram) in a dose proportional manner. Absolute bioavailability of 
indacaterol after an inhaled dose was on average 43% to 45%. Systemic exposure results from a 
composite of pulmonary and gastrointestinal absorption; about 75% of systemic exposure was from 
pulmonary absorption and about 25% from gastrointestinal absorption. 
Indacaterol serum concentrations increased with repeated once-daily administration. Steady state was 
achieved within 12 to 14 days. The mean accumulation ratio of indacaterol, i.e. AUC over the 24-h 
dosing interval on Day 14 compared to Day 1, was in the range of 2.9 to 3.5 for once-daily inhaled 
doses between 150 microgram and 600 microgram.

Distribution 
After intravenous infusion the volume of distribution of indacaterol during the terminal elimination 
phase was 2557 litres indicating an extensive distribution. The in vitro human serum and plasma 
protein binding was 94.1-95.3% and 95.1-96.2%, respectively. 
Biotransformation 
After oral administration of radiolabelled indacaterol in a human ADME (absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, excretion) study, unchanged indacaterol was the main component in serum, accounting 
for about one third of total drug-related AUC over 24 hours. A hydroxylated derivative was the most 
prominent metabolite in serum. Phenolic O-glucuronides of indacaterol and hydroxylated indacaterol 
were further prominent metabolites. A diastereomer of the hydroxylated derivative, a N-glucuronide of 
indacaterol, and C- and N-dealkylated products were further metabolites identified. 
In vitro investigations indicated that UGT1A1 is the only UGT isoform that metabolised indacaterol to 
the phenolic O-glucuronide. The oxidative metabolites were found in incubations with recombinant 
CYP1A1, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. CYP3A4 is concluded to be the predominant isoenzyme 
responsible for hydroxylation of indacaterol. In vitro investigations further indicated that indacaterol is 
a low affinity substrate for the efflux pump P-gp. 
Elimination 
In clinical studies which included urine collection, the amount of indacaterol excreted unchanged via 
urine was generally lower than 2% of the dose. Renal clearance of indacaterol was, on average, 
between 0.46 and 1.20 litres/hour. When compared with the serum clearance of indacaterol of 
23.3 litres/hour, it is evident that renal clearance plays a minor role (about 2 to 5% of systemic 
clearance) in the elimination of systemically available indacaterol. 
In a human ADME study where indacaterol was given orally, the faecal route of excretion was 
dominant over the urinary route. Indacaterol was excreted into human faeces primarily as unchanged 
parent substance (54% of the dose) and, to a lesser extent, hydroxylated indacaterol metabolites (23% 
of the dose). Mass balance was complete with ≥90% of the dose recovered in the excreta. 
Indacaterol serum concentrations declined in a multi-phasic manner with an average terminal half-life 
ranging from 45.5 to 126 hours. The effective half-life, calculated from the accumulation of 
indacaterol after repeated dosing ranged from 40 to 52 hours which is consistent with the observed 
time-to-steady state of approximately 12-14 days. 
Special populations 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there is no clinically relevant effect of age (adults 
up to 88 years), sex, weight (32-168 kg) or race on the pharmacokinetics of indacaterol. It did not 
suggest any difference between ethnic subgroups in this population. 
Patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment showed no relevant changes in C max or AUC of 
indacaterol, nor did protein binding differ between mild and moderate hepatic impaired subjects and 
their healthy controls. Studies in subjects with severe hepatic impairment were not performed. 
Due to the very low contribution of the urinary pathway to total body elimination, a study in renally 
impaired subjects was not performed. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Effects on the cardiovascular system attributable to the beta2-agonistic properties of indacaterol 
included tachycardia, arrhythmias and myocardial lesions in dogs. Mild irritancy of the nasal cavity 
and larynx were seen in rodents. All these findings occurred at exposures sufficiently in excess of 
those anticipated in humans. 
Although indacaterol did not affect general reproductive performance in a rat fertility study, a decrease 
in the number of pregnant F1 offspring was observed in the peri- and post-developmental rat study at 
an exposure 14-fold higher than in humans treated with Oslif Breezhaler. Indacaterol was not 
embryotoxic or teratogenic in rats or rabbits. 
Genotoxicity studies did not reveal any mutagenic or clastogenic potential. Carcinogenicity was 
assessed in a two-year rat study and a six-month transgenic mouse study. Increased incidences of 
benign ovarian leiomyoma and focal hyperplasia of ovarian smooth muscle in rats were consistent 
with similar findings reported for other beta2-adrenergic agonists. No evidence of carcinogenicity was 
seen in mice. Systemic exposures (AUC) in rats and mice at the no-observed adverse effect levels in 
these studies were at least 7- and 49-fold higher, respectively, than in humans treated with Oslif 
Breezhaler once a day at a dose of 300 microgram.

Frequently Asked 
Questions 
Why didn’t the inhaler 
make a noise when I 
inhaled? 
The capsule may be stuck 
in the capsule chamber. If 
this happens, carefully 
loosen the capsule by 
tapping the base of the 
inhaler. Inhale the 
medicine again by 
repeating steps 3a to 3c. 
What should I do if there 
is powder left inside the 
capsule? 
You have not received 
enough of your medicine. 
Close the inhaler and 
repeat steps 3a to 3c. 
I coughed after inhaling 
– does this matter? 
This may happen. As long 
as the capsule is empty 
you have received enough 
of your medicine. 
I felt small pieces of the 
capsule on my tongue – 
does this matter? 
This can happen. It is not 
harmful. The chances of 
the capsule breaking into 
small pieces will be 
increased if the capsule is 
pierced more than once.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Oslif Breezhaler is and what it is used for 
What Oslif Breezhaler is 
Oslif Breezhaler contains the active substance indacaterol which belongs to a group of medicines 
called bronchodilators. When you inhale it, it relaxes the muscles in the walls of the small air passages 
in the lungs. This helps open up the airways, making it easier to get air in and out. 
What Oslif Breezhaler is used for 
Oslif Breezhaler is used to make breathing easier for adult patients who have breathing difficulties due 
to a lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In COPD the muscles around 
the airways tighten. This makes breathing difficult. This medicine relaxes these muscles in the lungs, 
making it easier for air to get in and out of the lungs. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Oslif Breezhaler 
Do not use Oslif Breezhaler 
- 
if you are allergic to indacaterol or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).

Frequently Asked 
Questions 
Why didn’t the inhaler 
make a noise when I 
inhaled? 
The capsule may be stuck 
in the capsule chamber. If 
this happens, carefully 
loosen the capsule by 
tapping the base of the 
inhaler. Inhale the 
medicine again by 
repeating steps 3a to 3c. 
What should I do if there 
is powder left inside the 
capsule? 
You have not received 
enough of your medicine. 
Close the inhaler and 
repeat steps 3a to 3c. 
I coughed after inhaling 
– does this matter? 
This may happen. As long 
as the capsule is empty 
you have received enough 
of your medicine. 
I felt small pieces of the 
capsule on my tongue – 
does this matter? 
This can happen. It is not 
harmful. The chances of 
the capsule breaking into 
small pieces will be 
increased if the capsule is 
pierced more than once.

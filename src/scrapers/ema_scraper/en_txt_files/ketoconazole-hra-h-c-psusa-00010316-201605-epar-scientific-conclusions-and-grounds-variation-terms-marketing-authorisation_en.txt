Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ketoconazole (centrally 
authorised product only), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Ketoconazole  is  a  potent  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  enzyme.  Pharmacokinetics  of  medicines  that  are 
substrates  of  CYP3A4  can  be  affected  when  administered  concomitantly  with  ketoconazole, 
potentially leading to clinically significant serious ADRs and/or the need for dose adjustment of these 
medicinal  products.  The  PRAC  considers  that,  in  view  of  the  available  data  the  interaction  of 
ketoconazole with naloxegol should be added to the product information. The update on ketoconazole 
inhibition  of  breast  cancer  resistant  protein  and  new  information  regarding  ketoconazole  potent 
inhibition of several transporters should also be included in the product information.  
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information of medicinal products containing ketoconazole were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ketoconazole (centrally authorised product only) the 
CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing 
ketoconazole (centrally authorised product only) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to 
the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

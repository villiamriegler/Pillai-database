Dimethyl fumarate Mylan (dimethyl fumarate) 
Revocation of the marketing authorisation in the European Union 
On 13 December 2023, the European Commission revoked the marketing authorisation of Dimethyl 
fumarate Mylan (dimethyl fumarate) in the European Union (EU). Dimethyl fumarate Mylan was a 
generic medicine of Tecfidera. The marketing authorisation holder for the medicine was Mylan Ireland 
Limited. 
The revocation of the marketing authorisation was necessary in order to implement the judgment of 
the Court of Justice of 16 March 2023 in Commission and Others v Pharmaceutical Works Polpharma, 
Cases C-438/21 P to C-440/21 P. It follows from that judgment that the marketing authorisation for 
Dimethyl fumarate Mylan was submitted at a point in time when the regulatory data protection period 
of the reference product (Tecfidera) had not expired. Further information in relation to the revocation 
of Dimethyl fumarate Mylan may be found in the Commission Implementing Decision revoking the 
marketing authorisation, which is available on the Union Register of medicinal products for human use. 
Dimethyl fumarate Mylan was granted marketing authorisation in the EU on 13 May 2022 for treatment 
of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).  
The European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) for Dimethyl fumarate Mylan will be updated to 
indicate that the marketing authorisation is no longer valid.

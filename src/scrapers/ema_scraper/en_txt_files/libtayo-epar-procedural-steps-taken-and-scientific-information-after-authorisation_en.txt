SmPC, Annex II 
The CHMP, having reviewed the available information on the 
and PL 
status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations and having 
confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, is of the opinion 
that the quality, safety and efficacy of this medicinal product 
continue to be adequately and sufficiently demonstrated. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considered that, as all Specific 
Obligations have been fulfilled, there are no remaining 
grounds for the marketing authorisations to remain 
conditional and therefore recommends the granting of the 
MA no longer subject to Specific Obligations for LIBTAYO.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a chronic eye disease characterized by progressive degenerative 
abnormalities in the central retina (macula). 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a chronic eye disease characterized by progressive degenerative 
abnormalities in the central retina (macula). 
Two stages are known for this disease:  
• 
• 
early AMD, which is characterized by drusen and pigmentary changes, 
late AMD, which can be distinguished in 2 subtypes — geographic atrophy (GA) and choroidal 
neovascularization (CNV). The neovascular subtype of AMD (neovascular AMD or wet AMD) is known to cause 
particularly rapid and devastating vision loss for these individuals. Vision loss results from the abnormal 
growth and leakage of blood vessels in the macula, leading to legally blindness. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Neovascular AMD (nAMD) is the leading cause of severe vision loss worldwide, affecting 10% to 13% of 
individuals over the age of 65 in North America, Europe, and Australia. It is suggested that almost 16% of 
patients with nAMD would become legally blind in 2 years without treatment and that the prevalence rates of 
late AMD are in European is around 2.5%. 
Although the neovascular form of the disease is only present in about 10% of all AMD cases, it accounted for 
approximately 90% of the severe vision loss from AMD prior to the introduction of anti-vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) treatments. 
Neovascular AMD generally onsets in individuals older than 50 years of age. It is suggested that 10% of 
individuals aged 65 to 74 years, and 30% of those aged 75 to 85 years, show signs of AMD. 
Major observed risk factors include cigarette smoking, nutritional factors, cardiovascular diseases, and 
genetic predisposition. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Although aetiology and pathogenesis remain not fully elucidated, main factor of progression of AMD remains 
age genetic predisposition and cigarette smoking. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
AMD is a disease of the photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In the aging eye, Bruch’s 
membrane composition changes, and RPE function diminishes. Because of reduced RPE function, drusen 
deposits at the level of the RPE and photoreceptors accumulate. Drusen contain lipofuscin and other toxic 
waste products of metabolism. 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 9/117 
 
  
  
In AMD, Bruch’s membrane ruptures associated with a localized inflammatory response and vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is released, which induces choroidal neovascularization (CNV). The CNV is a 
membrane of abnormal and leaky blood vessels, growing from the choroid through the defects in Bruch's 
membrane underneath the RPE and the retina. These new, immature blood vessels leak lipids, fluid and 
blood. This causes oedema and elevation of the retina, resulting in blurring and distortion of vision. Onset of 
visual dysfunction in nAMD is acute and progresses within a few weeks or even more accelerated particularly 
if bleeding occurs. With bleeding under the retina or persistent oedema, the loss of central vision becomes 
permanent leading to patients who are not able to read, watch TV, drive a car or recognize faces. 
The damage to the retina due to neovascularisation results in progressive, severe, and irreversible vision 
loss, metamorphopsia, scotoma, photopsia, and difficulties in dark adaptation. Without treatment, most 
affected eyes will have poor central vision (20/200) within 12 months. 
Neovascular AMD is classified into three subtypes: classic, occult, and minimally classic lesions. However, it 
seems that progression of neovascular lesion sizes appears to be independent of lesion subtypes.  
The main determinant of choroidal neovascularization lesion size enlargement is the duration of exudative 
disease. The gold standard to diagnostic nAMD is the fluorescein angiography. Additionally, optical coherence 
tomography (OCT) is a useful complementary imagery which allow to identify the presence of subretinal fluid 
and the central retinal thickness. 
2.1.5.  Management 
To date, intravitreal anti-VEGF therapies are the standard of care. Two anti-VEGF therapies authorized in the 
treatment of neovascular AMD are available on the market: ranibizumab (Lucentis®) and aflibercept 
(Eylea®). 
Previous therapy approaches such as surgical therapies, radiotherapy or laser photocoagulation, or even 
photodynamic therapy (PDT) using verteporfin are not frequently used anymore. 
VEGF are angiogenic factors which are found elevated in patients with nAMD. They play a key role in the 
neovascularization process. Anti-VEGF inhibit VEGF signalling pathways and have been shown to halt the 
growth of neovascular lesions and resolve retinal oedema in patients with nAMD. 
Ranibizumab 
Lucentis® is a humanised recombinant monoclonal antibody fragment targeted against human vascular 
endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). 
The treatment is initiated with one injection per month until maximum visual acuity is achieved and/or there 
are no signs of disease activity. Initially, three or more consecutive, monthly injections may be needed. 
Thereafter, monitoring and treatment intervals should be determined by the physician.  
Aflibercept 
Eylea® is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF receptor 1 and 2 extracellular 
domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1, bidding VEGFA, VEGFB and PlGF. 
Aflibercept is initiated with a launching phase of 3 monthly injections. The treatment interval is then 
extended to two months. Based on the physician’s judgement of visual acuity and/or anatomic parameters, 
the treatment interval may be maintained at two months or further extended.

About the product 
Brolucizumab (RTH258, ESBA1008, AL-86810) is a humanized single-chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragment with 
a molecular weight of ~26 kDa which inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) binding to VEGF 
receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. Inhibition of the VEGF pathway has been shown to inhibit the growth of 
neovascular lesions and resolve retinal oedema in patients with nAMD resulting in improved and/or 
maintained visual function. 
Brolucizumab is developed for ophthalmic use and is administered by intravitreal injection. The smaller 
molecular size of the scFvs as compared to whole antibodies or larger antibody fragments enables delivery of 
a high molar dose to the limited volume of the vitreous body, which may enable better tissue penetration at 
the retina and prolong the therapeutic effect. It is intended to maintain long-term efficacy while reducing the 
frequency of treatment and monitoring visits, thereby reducing the treatment and monitoring burden. 
Aspects on development 
CHMP Guidance 
There is no CHMP guidance for the development of drugs in this pathology and target population. 
Clinical development 
The brolucizumab clinical development program provides extensive clinical data of up to 2 years treatment 
duration in 2202 subjects with neovascular age-related macular degeneration in 7 clinical trials, including 1355 
subjects who received brolucizumab. The results of the two studies in the Phase I/II program (C-10-083 [SEE 
study]) and Study C- 12-006 [OSPREY study]) were used to support the dose and regimen selection for the 
Phase III trials. The Phase III program is based on 2 randomized, double-masked, multicentre, active-control 
(versus aflibercept 2 mg) pivotal studies (RTH258-C001 [HAWK study] and RTH258-C002 [HARRIER study]) 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of brolucizumab administrated intravitreally. Two doses were investigated, 
3 mg and 6 mg. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product (FP) Beovu is presented as a solution for injection containing 6 mg (120 mg/mL) of 
brolucizumab as active substance.

2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
Brolucizumab is a recombinant humanised single-chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragment which inhibits vascular 
endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) binding to its receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. It is expressed in an  E. 
coli BL21(DE3) and consists of a light chain fragment and a heavy chain fragment, which belong to the human 
kappa and VH3 subtypes respectively. Both  chains are  connected  via a flexible  glycine /  serine linker. The 
molecular sum formula of brolucizumab is C1164H1768N310O372S8.  
Figure 1: Brolucizumab single-chain Fv (scFv) 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Brolucizumab active substance is manufactured by Lonza AG, Visp in Switzerland. All relevant active 
substance sites have valid manufacturing authorisations or valid GMP certificates. 
Brolucizumab solution for injection in a prefilled syringe is manufactured by Alcon-Couvreur N.V., Belgium. 
The solution for injection in a glass vial is manufactured in Novartis Pharma Stein AG, Switzerland. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Brolucizumab active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. Main steps are 
fermentation, harvest and inclusion body (IB) solubilisation and isolation, several chromatographic 
purifications, filtration and filling. The ranges of critical process parameters and the routine in-process 
controls along with acceptance criteria, including controls for microbial purity and endotoxin, are described 
for each step. The active substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable. 
Description of the manufacturing process and controls are appropriately detailed with a satisfactory list of 
process parameters and in-process controls (IPCs). Definition of batch and its scale are provided. 
Brolucizumab active substance is manufactured according to a fed batch mode culture. The upstream process 
(USP) starts with the thawing of one vial of working cell bank (WCB) followed by expansion steps and then 
culture in the production bioreactor (15000 L). At a defined cell density, the induction of protein expression is 
triggered. After incubation, the cells are separated from the fermentation media by disc stack centrifugation. 
The inclusion bodies are then isolated by various washes followed by a centrifugation step each time. The 
isolated IBs can be stored at 4 – 12°C for up to 168 hours prior to solubilisation. The protein is then 
solubilised and reduced followed by renaturation of the unfolded protein by dilution into a refolding buffer. 
The refolded protein may be stored at 15-25°C for up to 48 hours. After the refolding step the protein 
solution is filtered through a depth and bioburden reduction filter before starting the first purification step. 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 12/117 
 
  
  
 
 
The downstream manufacturing process (DSP) includes 3 chromatography steps, 2 ultrafiltration/diafiltration 
steps and one last ultrafiltration to further concentrate the protein solution. 
At the end of the manufacturing process, the active substance is pre-formulated with sodium citrate, sucrose 
and 0.01g/L polysorbate 80. It is then filtered through a 0.2 μm filter into PETG bottles, stored at ≤-65°C 
and shipped to the finished product manufacturing sites. No reprocessing is foreseen.  
The active substance is stored in 1L PETG bottle fitted with a HDPE screw cap. The bottles and caps are 
sterilised via validated gamma radiation within the range 20-45 kGy. They are compliant with the 
corresponding Ph. Eur. Monographs. 
Critical steps of the brolucizumab active substance manufacturing process are controlled by in-processs controls 
(IPC)  with  action  limits  or  acceptance  criteria.  A  justification  based  on  the  results  obtained  from  process 
development, process characterisation at small scale, control strategy and manufacturing process capabilities, 
was submitted for the action limits and the acceptance criteria. 
In the upstream process there are no IPCs with action limit and two IPCs with acceptance criteria, i.e. culture 
purity and culture identity at the seed fermentation and at the main fermentation. In the downstream process 
no IPCs are monitored with acceptance criteria. The endotoxin and bioburden are controlled with action limits 
at each step. This classification is acceptable. 
For both the upstream and downstream processes the process parameters (PP) are classified as critical (CPP) 
and  non-critical  (non-CPP).  The  non-CPP  are  further  classified  into  key-PP  (KPP)  and  non-KPP,  KPP  being  a 
non-CPP which has an impact on process performance indicator but not on critical quality attributes and which 
should be monitored or controlled to ensure process performance or consistency. A non-KPP is a non-CPP whose 
considered variability has no impact on either a CQA or a performance indicator. Both CPPs and non-CPPs are 
defined  by  acceptable  ranges  (AR)  that  correspond  to  an  interval  over  which  a  parameter  may  vary  in  the 
process  without  leading  to  unexpected  product  quality  and  process  performance  regardless  of  their 
classification. 
In the process characterisation studies it can be seen that the AR applied to the process parameters correspond 
to proven acceptable ranges (PAR), which is acceptable.  
Control of materials 
Cells of the BL21 (DE3) E. coli strain were used as parental cell line, from which the brolucizumab production 
cell line and cell banks for the expression of the protein of interest were derived. The competent cells were 
purchased  from  Invitrogen  (Carlsbad,  USA).  The  gene  sequence  coding  for  brolucizumab  was  genetically 
engineered by grafting the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and specific framework residues from 
heavy and light chain variable region sequences of a monoclonal rabbit anti-human VEGF antibody to human 
heavy and light chain variable region frameworks, covalently linked by a flexible amino acid sequence consisting 
of glycine and serine. For cloning of the brolucizumab expression vector pGMP ESBA1008, the vector backbone 
of  pET-24d(+),  a  commercially  available  E.  coli  expression  vector  from  Novagen,  was  used.  The  insert was 
synthetically created. The cloning of the expression vector, pGMP ESBA1008, was done in several sequential 
steps described in the dossier.  
Plasmid  pGMP  ESBA1008  with  the  coding  sequence  of  brolucizumab  was  transformed  into  commercially 
available  competent  E.  coli  BL21  (DE3)  cells  by  heat  shock  transformation  to  generate  the  brolucizumab 
production cell line.

is presented. Raw materials are tested according to European Pharmacopeia,  USP or in-house monographs. 
Regarding  the  non  compendial  raw  materials,  the  specifications  are  given.  The  composition  of  the  different 
culture media used for the inoculum, the expansion and the main fermentation is also presented. No human or 
animal derived materials are used in the active substance manufacturing process and acceptable documents 
have been provided for raw materials of biological origin used in the establishment of cell substrate. 
Cell banks 
Information on the origin of the host cell line, on the development genetics (including origin of the gene, 
description of the gene construct) and on the establishment of the cell banks is provided. A two-tiered 
system cell banking was established for commercial production. The banking procedure was adequately 
presented and characterisation was performed in accordance with ICH Q5D guideline. The protocol of 
establishment for new WCBs was also provided. The genetic cell bank stability of the production cell line was 
appropriately demonstrated.    
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A comprehensive overview of critical in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed throughout 
the brolucizumab active substance manufacturing process is given. Acceptable information has been provided 
on the control system in place to monitor and control the active substance manufacturing process with regard 
to critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters and in-process tests. Actions taken if limits are 
exceeded are specified. There are no active substance intermediates isolated in the manufacturing process of 
brolucizumab. 
The control strategy presented was based on quality attributes, criticality, process control capability and the 
testing strategy. The integrated control strategy incorporated also control elements including process 
parameters, in-process controls, release specifications, and periodic testing controls (e.g., validation, 
comparability, stability) of the active substance and finished product. This reflects knowledge of CQAs and 
their potential to impact patient safety and product efficacy, as well as an understanding of the means by 
which these attributes are controlled during manufacturing and through shelf-life. A list of brolucizumab CQAs 
provided with the control elements in place to control each CQA was provided. The information provided 
regarding assigned CQAs and the control strategy is sufficient. 
Prior to execution of the process characterisation studies, a FMEA (Failure mode and effects analysis) risk 
assessment was performed for each unit operation of the brolucizumab active substance manufacturing 
process to identify potential critical process parameters and / or potential key process parameters. The 
assessment was performed based on experiences gained during early phase process development, clinical 
manufacturing, experience on platform knowledge, or described in general literature. Then the potential 
KPP/CPPs were further analysed in the process characterisation studies based on univariate and multivariate 
small-scale studies. Statistical significance and extent of impact (sensitivity) on the output parameters 
(process performance and / or critical quality attributes) of each process parameter within its PAR were 
evaluated. 
Based on the statistical analysis the process parameters were classified as KPP or CPP. The proposed 
classification was not entirely endorsed. Indeed for a process parameter that can have an impact between 
10%-30% on an output parameter, the score is 3 if p>0.1 (meaning no impact) and 3 if p is between 0.05 
and 0.1 (meaning moderate impact); in both cases the parameter is classified as a non-KPP. From a general 
point of view, if a process parameter impacts a CQA, it should be considered as a CPP even if the impact is

low (ICH Q8(R2)). However, taking into account that these parameters are mentioned and controlled in 
section S.2.2, no concern was raised. 
Process validation 
Process validation consisted of analysing three consecutive full-scale batches of brolucizumab, for the different 
steps  of  the  upstream  and  downstream  processes.  An  additional  commercial  batch  corresponding  to  cells 
cultured  at  the  extended  cell  age,  was  also  analysed  to  validate  the  LIVCA  (Limit  of  In  Vitro  Cell  Age) 
corresponding to the number of generations from the MCB. 
Critical and key process parameters, as well as in-process controls and additional tests were investigated in 
this validation. Validation batch data were generally well aligned within narrow ranges, well above/below/within 
the  acceptable  ranges,  acceptance  criteria  or  action  limits.  These  results  showed  that  the  active  substance 
manufacturing process will ensure consistency in production at commercial scale.  
Detailed  reports  were  also  adequately  provided  for  the  scale  down  model  (SDM)  used  for  the  impurities 
depletion studies and in the proces characterisation studies.  
To assess the depletion capacity of the manufacturing process for process-related impurities (HCP, host cell 
DNA, culture media and buffer components removal), validation studies for removal of those impurities were 
performed  and  samples  taken  from  different  process  steps  were  monitored.  Spiking  studies  were  also 
performed for the HCP and host cell DNA. The current manufacturing process was found capable of effectively 
and consistently reducing these impurities to low levels. Most of the process-related impurities were below the 
LOQ and below the safety concern threshold (SCT) of 1.5µg/day. 
As  regards  the  extractables  and  leachables,  a  risk  assessment  including  a  toxicological  assessment  was 
performed for the materials that are  in contact with  the product, process pools, buffers, media or solutions 
used for the manufacturing of brolucizumab active substance. Based on the comprehensive risk assessment, 
and the simulated in-use leachable study, it can be concluded that materials used in the manufacturing and 
storage of brolucizumab active substance have no risk of leachables in the active substance.  
Manufacturing process development 
The process development history is described in sufficient detail. Five versions of the active substance 
manufacturing process have been used during the clinical development: Process A (toxicological, clinical 
phase 1), Process B (toxicological), Process C (clinical phase 2), Process F (toxicological, clinical phase 3) and 
Process G (clinical phase 3 extension study, commercial). Processes D and E were used for research 
purposes. No batches from these two processes were used in non-clinical or clinical studies.  
Major changes to the USP mainly focused on the need of increasing the production scale.  
Major changes to the DSP were mainly triggered by active substance formulation change and adaptions 
needed due to manufacturing site change. During early phase clinical development, a maximum dose of 6 mg 
per eye was targeted using a 100 μL injection volume. In order to reduce the injection volume to 50 μL per 
eye, the active substance protein concentration was increased from 60 mg/mL (process A) to 127 mg/mL. 
The active substance formulation buffer composition was also changed to accommodate the higher protein 
concentration. As a risk mitigation strategy during process development, the active substance formulation 
was changed first without drastically increasing the protein concentration (process B). The active substance 
protein concentration was subsequently increased to 127 mg/mL (process C). After the process was 
transferred from Biomeva GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany site to Lonza AG, Visp, Switzerland site, the DSP was 
further adapted to accommodate equipment differences (process F). Subsequently, active substance

composition was modified to support the finished product manufacturing. DSP was adapted to support the 
composition change, as well as to accommodate the increase of production scale (process G). Process G is 
the intended commercial manufacturing process. 
Comparability between processes F and G was assessed according to ICH Q5E, by analytical testing with a 
focus on process performance analysis, release testing, characterisation and comparative stability studies. 
Five process F active substance batches and three process G active substance batches were used. Although 
minor differences were detected reasonably explained, the comparability exercise is considered approvable 
based on the totality of data. 
Characterisation 
Brolucizumab has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological state-of-the-art methods 
revealing that the active substance has the expected structure of a humanised single-chain Fv (scFv) 
antibody fragment. The analytical results are consistent with the proposed structure. Furthermore, 
heterogeneity of the active substance was adequately characterised by analysing size and charge variants, 
and other product-related substances and impurities. Biological characterisation of Brolucizumab indicates 
that this antibody has the ability to bind human VEGF with high affinity as expected. Potency of brolucizumab 
was determined by its capacity to inhibit VEGF-induced proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
(HUVECs). In summary, the characterisation is considered appropriate for this type of molecule. 
Biochemical,  biophysical,  and  biological  characterisation  of  Brolucizumab  was  conducted  to  provide  a 
comprehensive  understanding  of  the  structural  (primary  and  higher  order  structure,  heterogeneity  pattern, 
purity and impurities) and functional properties and to enable an assessment of the product quality attributes. 
The characterisation studies were completed in the responses to LoQ with the amino acid composition analysis, 
the N-terminal and C-terminal amino-acid sequencing and the extinction coefficient. Forced degradation studies 
were performed to reveal potential degradation pathways.  
Brolucizumab  binding  to  antigen  VEGF  was  demonstrated  by  the  ELISA  assay.  High  affinity  binding  of 
brolucizumab active substance batches was characterized using the cell based potency assay, ELISA potency 
assay and surface plasmon resonance binding assays. The ability of brolucizumab to bind to VEGF-A isoforms 
was  determined  by  the  SPR  while  no  binding  was  observed  for  VEGF-C,  VEGF-D  and  PlGF (Placenta  growth 
factor). The potency assay corresponds to a cell-based assay which determined the capacity of brolucizumab 
to inhibit VEGF-induced proliferation of HUVEC cells. 
Forced degradation studies were performed on brolucizumab active substance and finished product for 
elucidation of degradation pathways of brolucizumab after exposure to acidic pH, basic pH, temperature, 
oxidative agents, light, freeze/thaw and shaking stress. These studies identified the product-related 
substances and product related impurities. The potency assay has been demonstrated to be sensitive to 
molecular changes induced by thermal stress and UV light stress. Instead, samples subjected to acidic and 
basic pH stressed thermal, oxidative stress retained potency. 
Specification 
The specifications for brolucizumab active substance are: appearance (turbidimetry, colour, pH, osmolality), 
Identity (AEX, peptide mapping), purity and impurities (SEC, AEX, CE-SDS), potency (proliferation assay) 
and Quantity (UV, polysorbate 80). 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 16/117 
 
  
  
 
The active substance specifications are based on clinical and toxicological manufacturing experience, process 
validation data, analytical method capabilities, characterisation of brolucizumab, release and stability testing 
results, release and end of shelf life specifications, statistical analysis and ICH and USP/Ph.Eur./JP 
monographs guidelines.  
In order to establish the acceptance criteria of brolucizumab active substance, the applicant proposed a 
statistical analysis of the data based on the calculated tolerance intervals (95/99.9), obtained using historical 
data. The TI applied is considered acceptable based on the historical data used.  Most of the active substance 
acceptance criteria were found satisfactory.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. Regarding the non-compendial analytical methods, additional 
data and justifications were provided in the responses to the LoQ and are considered satisfactory. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analyses are presented for batches manufactured according to all processes used in clinical trials, 
toxicological studies, primary stability studies, process validation and/or intended for commercial use, with 
using historical bathes. The information provided on the batches is sufficient. All data comply with the active 
substance commercial specification and results were close between batches, which demonstrates consistency 
in the active substance manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
A two-tier reference standard was established for  the control of brolucizumab active substance and finished 
product.  The  current  primary  reference  standard  (PRS)  was  produced  from  active  substance  manufactured 
according to commercial process and tested against the previous PRS. The specification of the PRS complies 
with  the  commercial  active  substance  specification  except  for:  the  HCP,  the  polysorbate  80,  the  microbial 
enumeration test and bacterial endotoxin test which are not tested and the potency acceptance criteria which 
is tightener. The testing strategy of the company is endorsed. Appropriate extensive characterisation studies 
were also performed and submitted showing comparability to the previous PRS. The current working (WRS) 
was manufactured according to commercial process and tested and released against the current PRS. To qualify 
future primary and working reference standards, including the potency assignment, the Applicant’s proposal  
was completed in response to the LoQ and is now considered appropriate.  
Stability 
The company claims a 2-year shelf-life for the active substance, when stored below -60°C.  
This claim is based on the data obtained from three clinical active substance batches manufactured according 
to the proposed commercial process for which 24 months data are available. Stability data were also provided 
for the process  validation active substance  batches for which 6 months were available under the long term 
storage conditions. In addition, accelerated (5±3°C) studies were also conducted for all batches and stressed 
studies (25°C ± 2°C/60% ± 5%RH) only for the clinical batches. 
Under the accelerated conditions, 6-month data are available for all batches. Under the stress conditions, 6-
month data are also available. The trends were similar for the three batches.  
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020

In conclusion, a 2-year shelf-life below -60ºC for active substance can be granted. The stability results indicate 
that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf life in the proposed container. 
Any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur 
and EMA.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Vials 
Brolucizumab finished product is supplied as a sterile, single-use, preservative-free, colourless to slightly 
brownish yellow solution for injection in a vial. The Type I glass vial is closed with a rubber stopper and 
sealed with an aluminium cap with a flip-off disk. The vial is co-packaged with a filter needle. Another 
presentation, a prefilled syringe, is also available and is described in a separate 3.2.P section. The materials 
comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
The composition of the intended commercial formulation is 120 mg/mL brolucizumab, polysorbate 80 
(0.02%), sodium citrate (10 mM), sucrose (5.8%), and Water for Injection. All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. 
The quality target product profile (QTPP) of the finished product was presented, as well as the quality attributes 
based on it. For each quality attribute, a criticality score was calculated based on a criticality assessment. For 
the API-related (i.e. product-related variants) quality attribute scoring, please refer to the comments related 
to the active substance. The non API-related and FP-related attributes are bioburden, endotoxin, HCP, DNA, 
colour,  safety  relevant  soluble  raw  materials  (process-related impurities  and  leachables),  turbidity  /  clarity, 
container  closure  integrity,  sterility,  subvisible  particles,  visible  particles,  API  concentration,  polysorbate  80 
concentration, extractable volume, osmolality, pH, sucrose and citrate concentrations.  
There is no overage in the finished product. An overfill is present to allow for the minimal delivered volume. 
The chosen volume (0.230 mL ± 4%) was justified based on a handling study showing that for the worst-case 
users, 220 µL is needed to allow the withdrawal of minimum 50.1 µL. This justification is deemed acceptable. 
During development, three formulations were successively used. The initial formulation used in the phase 1 
clinical trial was changed for a new formulation (formulation A) at 120 mg/mL, to avoid aggregation, which 
was used for phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials. Then formulation B was developed to prevent the formation of 
visible particles during storage, by increasing the pH and by decreasing the polysorbate concentration. This 
last formulation, with  active substance  from  process G  (commercial  process),  was  used  during  the  phase  3 
extension clinical trial. Between the phase 3 extension and the intended commercial process and formulation, 
the  only  change  is  the  manufacturing  scale.  A  comparability  study  between  batches  of  formulation  A  and 
formulation B (pilot scale and commercial scale) was performed and confirmed that, apart from the improved 
stability profile, no other quality difference is noted. 
Pharmaceutical development was based on laboratory scale studies and robustness studies conducted on the 
pre-validation  batches  manufactured  in  worst-case  conditions.  The  provided  data  were  completed  in  the 
responses to the LoQ with data regarding stirring parameters, flushing volumes, crystallised and aggregated 
protein. 
Leachables from Pt-cured silicone and PTFE tubing materials as well as the microbial and sterile filters were 
measured using 0.1% polysorbate 20 solution and were all lower than the safety concern threshold of 1.5 µg/ 
100 µL.  
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 19/117 
 
  
  
 
To  justify  the  appropriateness  of  the  container  closure  system,  the  absence  of  adsorption  of  the  active 
substance on the container materials was confirmed during stability studies in inverted vials, by protein content 
measurement.  An  extractable  study  was  performed  with  a  0.1%  polysorbate  20  surrogate  solution.  All  the 
extracted compound concentrations were below the safety concern threshold (1.5 µg / 100 µL finished product). 
Moreover, the vials containing the surrogate solution were stored inverted for 36 months at 2-8°C. Analysis of 
leachables,  elements  and  silicone  showed  no  compound  with  concentrations  exceeding  the  safety  concern 
threshold. A summary of the risk assessment for elemental impurities, as requested in ICH Q3D, was provided 
in the responses to the LoQ. These data are considered sufficient.  
In-use  stability  and  compatibility  were  verified  with  several  delivery  devices  (polypropylene/polystyrene, 
polypropylene, or polycarbonate syringes, blunt filter needle, 32G or 30G injection needle). All the results were 
comparable before and after incubation in the container plus incubation in the syringes, showing compatibility 
with all the tested configurations. 
Prefilled syringe 
Finished product in prefilled syringe has the same qualitative and quantitative composition as in vials. The 
primary packaging consists in Type I glass barrel closed with a plunger stopper and a tamper evident closure 
system.  
The QTPP of the finished product in prefilled syringe is identical to the QTPP for the vial with additional 
attributes (outer sterility of the prefilled syringe, ethylene oxide, break out and sliding force, residual 
silicone), which were all classified as critical. 
The proposed overfill (target fill volume of 165 µL) covers the dead volume of the assembly of injection 
needle and syringe, plus the volume for priming and the volume remaining in the tip cap. The dosing 
accuracy was satisfactory at temperatures ranging from 15 to 30°C. 
The manufacturing process development of the prefilled syringe was based on the work performed for the 
finished product in vial. The manufacturing process differences are principally related to site adaptations 
(batch size, compounding parameters, filtration through sterile filters) or related to additional steps (prefilled 
syringe assembly, blistering, sterilization of the outer surface of the syringes). A comparability study between 
finished product in vials and in prefilled syringe was provided: no quality differences were noted. 
Unlike finished product in vials, the slight filter adsorption has no final impact on the product as the filtered 
BDP is collected in a vessel and stirred before filling. Filtration studies confirming the pressure range were 
also performed. 
Manufacturing process development studies were also performed on siliconization of the syringe barrel and of 
the plunger stopper, the correct placement of the tip cap on the glass barrel, the confirmation of the filling 
process, and the appropriate position of the plunger stopper. The process parameters for blister sealing were 
qualified. 
As regards development of the outer surface sterilisation of the prefilled syringe, the sensitivity of the 
finished product to heat had to be taken into account into the sterilisation process settings. Decrease of ETO 
sterilisation temperature with increased contact time were used and qualified based on ISO 11135:2014. It 
was confirmed that the quality of the product (including stability) was maintained when using the worst case 
conditions of the setting. The provided data and information are satisfactory. Moreover, the Applicant 
justified in the responses to LoQ that only ETO sterilisation was found capable to sterilise while preserving the 
quality of the product.  
Assessment report

Leachables from tubing materials and from filters were measured and were all lower than the safety concern 
threshold of 1.5 µg/ treatment. This is acceptable. Physico-chemical hold times were confirmed on a pre-
validation batch. As for the vials, robustness studies showed that turbid vials can be detected and contain 
some proteinaceous particles, leading to the definition of controls for the 100% visual inspection, which were 
detailed upon request.  
The container closure system was confirmed to be suitable as regards absence of protein adsorption, absence 
of extractable compounds above the safety concern threshold, and elemental impurities in accordance to ICH 
Q3D.  
Compatibility of finished product in prefilled syringe with tungsten (from tungsten pin used to form the 
syringe bore), silicone oil, and ethylene oxide was confirmed by spiking studies. The spiked levels are 
considered sufficiently justified. The long term stability of the spiked finished product was also confirmed. 
Compatibility of the finished product with the injection needles was confirmed with  finished product in vials, 
which is sufficient. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product in vials is manufactured at Novartis Pharma AG (Stein, Switzerland) while the prefilled 
syringes  are  manufactured  in  Alcon-Couvreur  N.V.  (Belgium).  Manufacturing  authorizations  and  GMP 
certificates can be found on EudraGMP. 
The batch formula was provided for the target batch size of bulk finished product (BFP), which is in line with 
the batch size of the validation batches. 
The manufacturing process consists of thawing of active substance, dilution with an excipient dilution solution 
and  pH  adjustment,  adding  of  WFI  to  reach  the  final  batch  size  and  pH  adjustment,  pre-filtration,  sterile 
filtration, filling, capping and sealing of the vials, which are 100% inspected. The process parameters and in-
process controls were provided with associated targets and ranges. Chemical and microbiological hold times 
were also defined. Overall the manufacturing process description was adequately completed.  
The  critical  steps  were  defined  with  process  parameters  /  in-process  controls  involved  in  the  control  of  the 
quality  of  the  product.  They  included  speed  and  time  after  each  addition  in  the  BFP,  control  of  pH  and 
endotoxins, filter integrity test after sterile filtration and fill weight.  
Classification and justification for PARs, if wider than NORs, were listed for each process step. 
Validation batches at commercial scale were manufactured most of which met the acceptance criteria. Process 
validation  was  completed  with  the  following  studies:  filter  retention  capacity;  validation  of  vial  crimping 
machine; media fill tests; sterilisation and depyrogenation of the vials and sterilisation of the stoppers.  It has 
been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing finished product of the intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate. 
Maximal hold times were validated on a pre-validation batch at commercial scale, except for filter contact time. 
The filter contact time was studied during the filter retention capacity test in the bulk product, confirming that 
the microbiological hold time is acceptable. The maximal  active substance hold time and compounding hold 
time were used during the first validation batch, confirming the proposed limits for these hold times.

Transportation  of  the  packaged  finished  product  was  validated  by  temperature  excursion  studies  and 
qualification  of  the  shipping  containers  showing  adequate  quality  after  worst  case  configuration  of 
transportation conditions. 
Product specification  
All excipients are compendial. Specifications for excipients have additional endotoxin and microbial tests 
performed on sucrose, sodium citrate and polysorbate 80. Peroxide limit for polysorbate 80 is tighter than the 
compendial limit.  
Release and shelf-life specifications for the finished product, as well as description of the analytical 
procedures were provided.  
The proposed acceptance criteria are appropriately justified. The primary and secondary packaging components 
were described. For each component, the material of construction, supplier, compliance status, specifications, 
batch analysis data and drawings were provided. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis 
Batch  analyses  were  presented  for  historical  batches.  It  was  confirmed  upon  request  that  pooling  of  active 
substance batches will be performed in routine. 
Justification of acceptance criteria was based on formulation A and B batches or on formulation B batches 
only, depending on the impact of the formulation on each parameter. Statistical analysis was used to 
determine whether a significant slope was present during long-term storage. Acceptance criteria based on 
tolerance intervals (95/99.9) were proposed for some parameters. The acceptance criteria were tightened 
according to batch results.  
The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
The reference standard used for release and stability testing of the finished products is the same adopted for 
the release and stability testing of brolucizumab active substance. 
Stability of the product 
The company claims a 24 month shelf-life for both presentations, when stored 2 – 8 °C protected from light. 
Long-term  (5±3°C)  and  accelerated  (25±2°C  /  60±5%  RH  and  30±2°C  /  75±5%  RH)  stability  studies  are 
ongoing for 3 pilot batches, differing from commercial batches only by the batch size, and for the 3 validation 
batches.  Comparability  between  the  pilot  and  the  commercial  batches  was  demonstrated.  Trends  were 
observed,  but  all  the  results  remained  well  within  the  finished  product  shelf-life  specifications.  Changes  to 
purity levels seen at accelerated (25°C ± 2°C /  60%  ± 5% RH and 30°C ±  2°C / 75% ± 5% RH) storage 
conditions are in the range expected for these conditions. Furthermore, the stability behaviour and degradation 
profiles are comparable for all three registration batches. So, the claimed 24-month shelf-life can be granted.

Stability of the product upon shaking and temperature excursions before long term storage was 
demonstrated. Photostability was studied, showing that the product should be stored protected from light in 
the secondary packaging. The in-use stability study confirmed that the finished product can be stored for 24 
hours at ambient temperature with normal office light. Consequently, the SmpC contains the following 
instruction: Prior to use, the unopened blister which contains the pre-filled syringe, or the unopened vial may 
be kept at room temperature (below 25°C) for up to 24 hours. 
The parameters tested for all stability studies were appearance and description, purity by CE-SDS, AEX and 
SEC, Assay by UV, and potency by activity/inhibition. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of 24 month at 2 – 8 °C as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Medical device issues 
The filter needle provided with the finished product in vials is a class I sterile medical device. The CE number 
was provided as well as the declaration of conformity. 
Adventitious agents 
The active substance, brolucizumab protein is a fusion protein manufactured via microbial fermentation 
utilizing recombinant E. coli BL 21 (DE3) host cells. No materials of human, animal or recombinant origin 
were used during the generation of brolucizumab master cell bank and working cell banks. Some compounds 
(yeast extract and Tryptone) used in the manufacturing process and consumables are tallow-derived and 
comply with EMA’s Guidance (EMA/410/01 vers 3). The data provided are satisfactory concerning the viral 
adventitious aspect and the TSE risk.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product is 
expected to have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished product and 
their manufacturing process. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In support of the MAA, the applicant submitted a full non-clinical dossier, in accordance with ICH M3 (R2) and 
ICHS6 (R1), investigating the pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological profiles of Brolucizumab. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The pharmacology program included in vitro studies designed to characterize the binding affinity and 
specificity of brolucizumab to VEGF-A. 
Table 1: List of in vitro pharmacology studies 
Brolucizumab binds to the predominant isoform of human VEGF-A, VEGF165, as well as to two shorter VEGF-
A isoforms (VEGF121, and VEGF110).  
Characterization of the binding affinity of brolucizumab to three of the VEGF-A isoforms (VEGF165, VEGF121, 
and VEGF110) was performed by SPR analysis in an isoform selectivity study (ESBATech Study 
RDR_AssMo_0016.01). These isoforms correspond to the 3 major soluble forms of biologically active VEGF 
found in vivo. 
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) was used to determine the binding kinetics of brolucizumab for non-
glycosylated and glycosylated rhVEGF-165 (ESBATech study RDR_AssMo_0017.01 version 2.0), which is the 
most abundant isoform of VEGF-A. For comparison, the binding kinetics of ranibizumab (Lucentis) to 
glycosylated rhVEGF-165 was also determined by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)using the same analytical 
methods is (ESBATech study RDR_AssMo_0017.01 version 2.0). Blocking of the interaction of human 
VEGF165 with VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-1 by brolucizumab, therefore testing the neutralising potential was also 
studied by the applicant (ESBATech study RDR_AssMo_0017.01 version 2.0). In this study, Binding of

hVEGF-165 to plate immobilized VEGFR-2/Fc and VEGFR-1/Fc was measured in presence of a constant 
amount of rhVEGF-165 (1.3 nM and 5.2 nM, respectively) and varying concentrations of brolucizumab or 
ranibizumab (Lucentis). 
Potency and affinity of brolucizumab in comparison with marketed anti VEGF inhibitors ranibizumab, 
bevacizumab and aflibercept was studied (Study RD-2018-00365). To evaluate potency, the anti-VEGFs were 
analysed for their ability to inhibit binding of VEGF-A to the VEGFR2 receptor and inhibit VEGF-A induced 
proliferation of human retinal endothelial cells (HREC). The binding kinetics and affinity were measured by 
SPR. 
Complex formation of brolucizumab with human VEGF was analyzed by fluorescence emission spectroscopy 
(Study RD-2018-00360). Brolucizumab and human VEGF were diluted with dilution buffer to 1.02 and 0.96 
μM respectively. In second step, brolucizumab was further diluted 1:20 to yield a final solution of 50 nM. 
Species specificity (ESBATech study RDR_AssMo_0007.01) regarding VEGF sequence was also studied in 
order to determine the most relevant species for toxicology studies. Cross-reactivity of brolucizumab towards 
human, mouse, porcine, feline, and rabbit VEGF, in a direct ELISA test was performed. This study highlighted 
that brolucizumab did not bind to rabbit VEGF. These results showing a cross-reactivity towards mouse and 
rat VEGF allow assessment of ESBA 1008 efficacy in rat and mouse animal models such as the laser-induced 
CNV (choroidal neovascularization) during in vivo pharmacology studies. Moreover, since similarity of 
sequence has been demonstrated between human and primate, monkey was selected as the relevant species 
for toxicity studies. The affinity and kinetics of the interaction between brolucizumab and mouse, rat, rabbit, 
porcine, canine and feline VEGF were characterized using SPR technology. 
The ability of brolucizumab to neutralize the biological activity of VEGF in cell cultures was demonstrated 
using endothelial cells from different sources, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human or 
bovine retinal endothelial cells (HRECs or BRECs) using standard assay methods. Similarly to ranibizumab, 
brolucizumab blocked VEGF induced proliferation of HUVECs and BRECs in a dose-dependent manner. IC50 
values found in the HUVEC proliferation assay were 0.49 nM (12.7 ng/mL) for brolucizumab and 0.62 nM 
(29.8 ng/mL) for ranibizumab with glycosylated VEGF165. Compared to HUVECs, IC50 values determined in 
BRECs were slightly higher, 0.77 nM (20.0 ng/mL) for brolucizumab and 0.64 nM (30.7 ng/mL) for 
ranibizumab. In line with the proliferation assays, the potency of brolucizumab to inhibit VEGF-induced 
migration in HRECs is similar to that of ranibizumab IC50 of 0.09 nM (2.3 ng/mL) for brolucizumab and IC50 
of 0.11 nM (5.3 ng/mL) for ranibizumab. 
In addition to binding to human VEGF-A, brolucizumab also binds to rodent VEGF-A allowing for evaluation in 
rodent efficacy models.  
The in vivo pharmacology of brolucizumab was assessed in three different surrogate rodent models (mice and 
neonatal and adult rats). All the in vivo models are aimed to reproduce the features of VEGF-induced vascular 
permeability and neovascularisation in the different tissues of the eye. All models were deemed appropriate. 
Efficacy  of  brolucizumab  against  VEGF-induced  retinal  vascular  permeability  in  adult  rats  (Alcon 
study TDOC-0013037) 
Brolucizumab concentrations of 0.1, 0.3 and 1 µg/µl, administered IVT and pre-dosed 1 day before the VEGF 
challenge, probed to significantly reduce the VEGF-induced retinal vascular permeability in adult rats. In this 
same model, a time-dependent decrease in the efficacy of brolucizumab was detected when the product was 
single administered at different days pre-insult (1, 3, 7 and 14 days) with VEGF.

The second aspect of this in vivo study was to investigate time-dependency/ duration of effect, of brolucizumab 
or the comparator Lucentis via a single IVT dose of 10 mole equivalents of VEGF. Challenge with VEGF was 
performed 1, 3, 7 or 14 days later. Positive controls received vehicle and VEGF; negative controls, two doses 
of vehicle. Results of inhibition are summarized in Table 2.

Brolucizumab and Lucentis have demonstrated near complete (99.5% and 88.2%, respectively) and statistically 
significant inhibition when dosed 24 hours prior to VEGF challenge. When injected into the vitreous from 3 to 
14 days prior to VEGF challenge, both  products exhibited a time-dependent decrease in efficacy. Indeed 14 
days after administration, no significant inhibition was observed for both products.  
Efficacy  of  brolucizumab  in  neonatal  rat  model  of  oxygen-induced  retinopathy  (Alcon  study  TDOC-
0013037) 
Similar  results  were  found  in  the  oxygen-induced  retinopathy  (OIR)  and  neovascularization  (NV)  model  in 
neonatal  rats  (Alcon  study  TDOC-0013037).  Data  showed  that  brolucizumab  prevented  preretinal 
neovascularisation in the rat OIR model in a dose-dependent manner when administered on days 14 and 17 
postpartum while a single IVT injection on day 14 (15 μg and 46 μg) or day 17 (100 μg and 300 μg) postpartum 
did not show any effect. 
However, in this assay double IVT administration of the product was required (with the second injection 3 days 
after inducing the lesion) to observe  a protective  effect, as single injection  failed  to  prevent the  pre-retinal 
neovascularisation.  
Assessment report

Page 27/117 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In regression experiments conducted in the same model, brolucizumab failed to reverse the pathologic 
neovascularisation, even at doses of 60 µg/µl, in single IVT administration, conducted 3-4 days after the 
animals were exposed to the toxic insult and when the damage has already developed. These results indicate 
that administration of brolucizumab immediately or concomitant to the damage, followed by additional 
administrations at later time points might be necessary to observe a preventive, measurable effect in 
neovascularisation, as reversion of the pre-existing NV was not achieved using single, high doses of 
brolucizumab, administered days after exposure to the injury.  
Efficacy  of  brolucizumab  against  laser-induced  choroidal  neovascularisation  in  adult  mice  (Alcon 
study TDOC-0013037) 
The applicant has also conducted in vivo studies in mice, using a model of laser-induced choroidal 
neovascularisation (Alcon study TDOC-0013037). In this case, IP administration of the product prior to the 
laser-induced damage and sustained after the insult, resulted in prevention of the choroidal NV, but always to 
a lesser extent than the effects seen in the controls (anti-VEFG tyrosine kinase inhibitors). The dosage of the 
VEGF inhibitor in one of the assays (CNV-10-003) required daily IP administration of the drug, compared to 
brolucizumab which was employed in this assay at a concentration of 6 mg/kg, Q3D. When brolucizumab was 
administered IVT immediately after laser-induced damage and re-dosed after 3 or 7 days, protection up to 
some extent against choroidal NV was detected in a dose-dependent fashion, indicating again the need of 
concomitant to the injury and repeated administration of the product.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No  dedicated  studies,  including  tissue  cross-reactivity,  have  been  conducted  with  brolucizumab.  The 
justification for the absence of the aforementioned studies relies on the nature of the product (a humanized 
antibody fragment) and the route of administration (IVT), resulting in specific target engagement and lower 
systemic concentrations after treatment, respectively.  
Safety pharmacology program 
Lack  of  dedicated  safety  pharmacology  studies  was  justified  by  the  incorporation  of  safety  pharmacology 
endpoints  in  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies,  and  the  human  systemic  exposure  being  below  levels  where  any 
meaningful effect of a VEGF-related activity is expected. No effect  on  respiratory  function  or cardiovascular 
function, and no effects on the central nervous system were detected in toxicological studies. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Drug-drug interactions between antibody-based biologics and low molecular weight drugs were not investigated 
because hepatic metabolizing enzymes are generally not involved in metabolism and elimination of monoclonal 
antibodies. Antibody fragments such as brolucizumab are not expected to change either the cytokine profile or 
the expression of hepatic metabolizing enzymes. Therefore, section 4.2.2.6 Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions 
(nonclinical) of the e-CTD structure is not included.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic parameters (PK) of brolucizumab following intravenous and intravitreal (IVT) 
administration were evaluated in rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys. While brolucizumab does not bind to 
rabbit VEGF, the rabbit was chosen because it is commonly used for preliminary PK assessment of drugs 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 28/117 
 
  
  
administered locally to the eye. The cynomolgus monkey was chosen because brolucizumab binds to monkey 
VEGF, itis pharmacologically active in this species and it was used in the toxicology evaluations. The 
formulations used in the PK studies were consistent with the formulations used in the Toxicology studies. 
Following IVT administration, it appeared that free brolucizumab was cleared in parallel from all the evaluated 
ocular tissues and serum with a terminal half-life ranging from 59 to 82 hours in rabbits and 50 to 78 hours 
in cynomolgus monkeys. The serum half-life of brolucizumab in monkeys was prolonged after IVT 
administration compared to intravenous injection where the serum half-life was approximately 6 hours. The 
parallel elimination from all analysed ocular tissues and serum indicated that brolucizumab distributed from 
the vitreous humor to the adjacent compartments and serum. Free brolucizumab penetrated rapidly into the 
retina with concentrations similar to vitreous humor levels in cynomolgus monkeys, while in rabbits, the 
vitreous humor concentrations were approximately three times higher than those found in the retina. 
Following IVT administration, systemic (serum) exposure of free brolucizumab in rabbits and cynomolgus 
monkeys was found to be >20000-fold and >7000-fold lower than in vitreous humor. 
IVT injections of increasing doses of brolucizumab (0.5 mg to 6 mg/eye) in monkeys resulted in systemic 
exposures to free brolucizumab in serum that increased dose proportionally to slightly greater than dose 
proportionally.  
Absence of metabolism, excretion, and PK drug interaction studies are considered acceptable due to the 
nature of the product. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The non-clinical safety of up to 6 mg brolucizumab was established for intravitreal IVT in cynomolgus 
monkeys and rabbits in three non-GLP single dose toxicity studies (study E-12-015 and study E-13-001 in NZ 
rabbits, and study E-10-029 in cynomolgus), two non-pivotal non-GLP-regulated repeated-dose studies 
(Study E-10-003 and Study E-10-043 in cynomolgus) and three pivotal GLP-regulated repeated-dose studies 
(Alcon Study N-14-007, Alcon Study N-10-104 and Alcon Study N-12-042 in cynomolgus). 
Single dose toxicity studies via IVT did not reveal any major findings regarding excipients and/or 
brolucizumab. The non-pivotal/non-GLP study in cynomolgus monkeys, has shown ocular inflammation in 
animals. However, this effect was not considered to be related to brolucizumab, but to the level of endotoxin 
in the employed large-scale batch of ESBA1008. Overall brolucizumab appeared to be well tolerated in rabbits 
and monkeys under the tested conditions. 
3 GLP repeat-dose studies (Study N-10-104, Study N-12-042 and Study N-14-007) were conducted with the 
GMP material to determine the potential ocular toxicity, tolerability, and systemic exposure of brolucizumab 
in Cynomolgus monkeys after repeated IVT injections. Cynomolgus monkeys were chosen as they are the 
only species in which brolucizumab is both pharmacologically active and possessing a similar ocular anatomy 
to humans. Animals were dosed unilaterally (to provide an untreated contralateral control) with up to 6 
mg/50 µL injection volume using a dosing interval designed to mimic or exaggerate clinical use.  
Overall, results of the different studies revealed that brolucizumab was well tolerated with a NOAEL value of 6 
mg/eye corresponding to the highest tested dose and no systemic toxicity was observed. 
IVT administration of 6 mg brolucizumab to cynomolgus monkeys resulted in systemic exposure, with a Cmax 
of 0.577 µg/mL and AUC of 30.3 µg·h/mL. Serum free brolucizumab AUC increased dose-proportionally to 
slightly greater than dose-proportionally. Some potential accumulation was observed in serum after repeated 
brolucizumab administration at the highest tested dose of 6 mg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 29/117 
 
  
  
The proposed human dosing is up to every 12 weeks following three monthly loading doses of 50 µL IVT 
injections of 6 mg/eye brolucizumab. Non-clinical toxicity data provides a 2-fold ocular margin of safety 
based on comparative ocular volume for the recommended dose in patients, and 12- and 6-fold systemic 
margins of safety based on Cmax and AUC, respectively. 
No genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive-developmental studies were conducted by the applicant. 
Local tolerance was assessed as a part of the repeated dose-toxicity studies and immunogenicity was 
evaluated either during the course of repeated-dose toxicity studies and in dedicated T-cell proliferation 
assay. It was concluded that brolucizumab was weakly immunogenic. 
ADA response was assessed in the in vivo studies. Although antibodies were detected in all the studied 
groups, no effects were detected in brolucizumab exposure. This approach is acceptable from the non-clinical 
perspective as the predictive value of the data is limited and relevant antigenicity data is obtained in the 
clinical trials. 
Other toxicity studies 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Brolucizumab is a humanized single-chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragment with a molecular weight of ~26 kDa 
which inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) binding to its receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. It 
has been developed for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Inhibition of 
the VEGF pathway has been shown to inhibit the growth of neovascular lesions and resolve retinal oedema in 
patients with nAMD. Any active pharmaceutical ingredient that reaches water streams after use in patients, 
via eventual spills during brolucizumab application or after disposal of unused drug is expected to be very 
rapidly degraded by microbial activity. 
Therefore, there is no appreciable risk for the environment emerging from the introduction of brolucizumab 
for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration in the EU market. It is therefore deemed 
unnecessary to perform a detailed environmental risk assessment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacological program conducted by the applicant relies on in vitro and in vivo studies for primary 
pharmacodynamics. Brolucizumab has shown to be as efficient as ranibizumab in neutralization the binding of 
VEGF165 to its two receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. Affinity of brolucizumab to VEGF165 is similar to 
ranibizumab, but differences in the binding kinetics were observed. Brolucizumab binds to hVEGF165, 
hVEGF121 and hVEGF110 isoforms with high and similar affinities. The ability of brolucizumab to block the 
interaction of VEGF to its receptors and to inhibit VEGF-induced cells proliferation and migration (HUVECs, 
BRECs and HRECs) was demonstrated. In HUVECs, brolucizumab has demonstrated similar EC50 to 
ranibizumab (20 nM) for non-glycosylated VEGF. However, for both molecules, an increase in EC50 value 
was observed for glycosylated VEGF. Brolucizumab and ranibizumab provided dose-dependent inhibition of 
VEGF-induced BREC proliferation with EC50 values of 0.77 and 0.64 nM respectively. In HRECs complete 
inhibition were observed for brolucizumab (0.3-0.6 nM) and ranibizumab (1 nM). 
Difference in binding kinetic has been observed between brolucizumab and ranibizumab. The key step is 
based on the dissociation step with VEGF165. The applicant has highlighted that temperature has an effect on 
KD values and especially it was observed that KD increases with an increase in temperature for brolucizumab, 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 30/117 
 
  
  
bevacizumab and aflibercept. At 25°C, brolucizumab and aflibercept have roughly similar KD values whereas 
KD value for bevacizumab was at least 40 foldr higher. This is related to a faster binding kinetic of 
bevacizumab upon VEGF165. At 37°C, the difference observed is more pronounced between brolucizumab 
and aflibercept, this is in relation with the decomplexation step. Regarding bevacizumab, the difference 
observed with brolucizumab regarding the KD value is more distinct at 37°C. 
In addition, the applicant has demonstrated for brolucizumab and aflibercept, that IC50 values were not 
correlated with incubation time whereas incubation time has an impact on IC50 for bevacizumab and 
ranibizumab wherein IC50 values decreased with time of incubation. Thus, if incubation period was limited to 
1 hr. then brolucizumab and aflibercept are better inhibitors. Decreases observed in IC50 values with 
incubation time are correlated to KD with VEGF165. 
Species cross-reactivity study of brolucizumab towards human, mouse, porcine, feline, and rabbit VEGF has 
shown that brolucizumab binds to human, mouse, porcine, feline VEGF with similar affinity. However, this 
study did highlight that Brolucizumab did not bind to rabbit VEGF. These results showing cross-reactivity 
towards mouse and rat VEGF allows assessment of ESBA 1008 efficacy in rat and mouse animal models such 
as the laser-induced CNV (choroidal neovascularization) during in vivo pharmacology studies. Moreover, since 
similarity of sequence has been demonstrated between human and primate, monkey was selected as the 
relevant species for toxicity studies. 
In vivo studies were performed to characterize the efficacy of brolucizumab in preventing pathological 
neovascularization and vascular permeability in relevant animal models of ocular vascular disease. 
In vivo studies showed a preventive action of brolucizumab on retinal vascular permeability, choroidal 
neovascularisation (both by IVT administration) and preretinal neovascularisation (IVT and IP 
administration). It is noted that in the VEGF-induced retinal vascular permeability assays in adult rats the 
concentrations employed are expressed as mole equivalents to VEGF rather than in standard weight/volume 
of the product. Mole equivalent were provided to allow for direct comparison of the same number of 
molecules of brolucizumab and ranibizumab. Accordingly, 10-times molar equivalent to dimeric VEGF of 
brolucizumab corresponded to 0.345 µg/µl and for ranibizumab, represented 0.628 µg/µl. After adjustement 
with the molar weight (26.3 KDa and 48 KDa for brolucizumab and ranibizumab, respectively) concentrations 
are 13 µM for each. Therefore, it has been concluded that brolucizumab shows similar efficacy and effect 
duration for the inhibition of VEGF-induced retinal vascular permeability when applied at the same molar 
dose.  
In the rat oxygen-induced retinopathy and neovascularisation model, the results indicate that administration 
of brolucizumab immediately or concomitant to the damage, followed by additional administrations at later 
time points might be necessary to observe a preventive, measurable effect in neovascularisation, as 
reversion of the pre-existing NV was not achieved using single, high doses of brolucizumab, administered 
days after exposure to the injury. The lack of effect of brolucizumab in the regression assays presented as 
part of this study may be expected upon treatment with the product, as according to the Applicant, no 
regression of the already formed blood vessels may be expected after treatment with anti- VEGF therapy, 
applied several days after the insult. For the current evaluation of brolucizumab in the treatment of 
neovascular AMD (nAMD) this is considered of no relevance, but it could be significant for other indications, 
i.e. the new indication of Lucentis (retinopathy of prematurity), recently granted positive opinion at the 
CHMP. For this new indication, the rat OIR model is considered a relevant non-clinical model and it should be 
noted as well that Lucentis has been used extensively in the developmental plan of brolucizumab as a 
comparator.

No dedicated study has been performed by the applicant in order to investigate the off-target effects. 
However, the applicant has presented the potential risks associated with the use of anti-VEGF compounds. 
Indeed, VEGF inhibitors are known to increase blood pressure, thromboembolic events (stroke and 
myocardial infarction) after systemic administration. Systemic exposure was estimated to be low after IVT 
administration, based on PK and TK data and no effects on the cardiac system or blood pressure were 
observed during repeated dose toxicity studies with brolucizumab. 
The absence of systemic toxicity at exposure levels above maximum clinical exposure is reassuring. 
Therefore, the lack of dedicated safety pharmacology and pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies is 
accepted.  
PK program developed by the applicant relies mainly in studies performed in cynomolgus species except one 
distribution study in NZ rabbits. Although in vitro pharmacological studies have shown that brolucizumab did 
not cross-react with rabbit VEGF, ocular distribution of brolucizumab in NZ rabbits following single IVT was 
studied. Brolucizumab did penetrate in RPE-choroid after IVT administration and was cleared via the aqueous 
humor to the systemic circulation. Exposures in vitreous humor > retina> RPE-choroid > aqueous humor > 
serum (AUC vitreous humor >30000 x AUC serum).  
A rabbit ocular PK study was performed as an initial preliminary investigation of the ocular and serum PK of 
brolucizumab. This study was not GLP-compliant, and the bioanalytical method was not formally validated. 
However, the concentration of brolucizumab in serum and ocular fluids/tissues was analysed using an 
adequate protocol. 
In cynomolgus, it was observed after single IVT administration that brolucizumab distributed rapidly into 
ocular tissues with exposure levels central retina> peripheral retina> vitreous humor> aqueous humor> 
peripheral choroid> central choroid. As shown in rabbits, the systemic exposure of brolucizumab was low in 
serum and AUC vitreous humor >9200 x AUC serum. Overall, it has been shown in the two species that 
brolucizumab distributed rapidly into ocular tissues and systemic exposure was negligible, as compared to 
ocular tissues. 
Intravitreal administration of brolucizumab in cynomolgus resulted in prolonged half-life compared with IV 
injection. 
Since, brolucizumab is expected to be metabolised and degraded to small peptides and individual amino 
acids, no biotransformation studies have been performed by the applicant. This is acceptable regarding 
ICHS6 (R1). 
Dedicated studies on excretion were not performed by the applicant since expected elimination after systemic 
administration is very rapid compared to full IgG and after IVT administration it was demonstrated that 
systemic exposure was low. 
Regarding brolucizumab, the IVT route has been selected for administration. It is believed that PK 
interactions of brolucizumab and small drugs will be limited and the lack of studies on PK drug interactions is 
accepted. 
No pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted with brolucizumab in pregnant or lactating animals. Lack of 
dedicated studies is accepted based on the points raised by the applicant regarding the fact that 
brolucizumab (~26 kDa) is much larger than the <600 Da which is the molecular weight limit generally 
accepted for passive transport across the placenta or into breast milk. Moreover, the following sentence: 
“breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose when 
stopping treatment” is stated in the 4.6 section of the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020

Overall, the PK program proposed by the applicant is satisfactory. 
Single dose toxicity studies via IVT did not reveal any major findings regarding excipients and/or 
brolucizumab. The non-pivotal/non-GLP study in cynomolgus monkeys, has shown ocular inflammation in 
animals. However, this effect was not considered to be related to brolucizumab, but to the level of endotoxin 
in the employed large-scale batch of ESBA1008. Overall, brolucizumab appeared to be well tolerated in 
rabbits and monkeys under the tested conditions. 
No systemic toxicity has been observed in the two non-pivotal repeated dose toxicity studies. Only findings at 
the target organ (eye) were observed in both studies, such as ocular inflammation, retinal degeneration 
(dose-dependency). Severe ocular inflammations seemed to be the results of higher levels of endotoxin on 
the animals tested with pilot mock ESBA1008 and lab-batch ESBA1008.Since it has not been observed any 
related ocular findings with the clinical GMP batch therefore it may be considered that the observed effects 
were related to the manufacturing process.  Thus, pivotal repeated dose toxicity studies were then conducted 
with the GMP manufactured product. 
All the 3 conducted studies have demonstrated systemic exposure in all treated groups. Whereas retinal 
degeneration was observed in non-pivotal repeated toxicity studies, it was not observed in the pivotal ones. 
Only right eye inflammation corresponding to cell infiltrates was observed but was not test article-related but 
correlated with the IVT technique. No test-article changes in body weight, haematology parameters, clinical 
chemistry parameters, ERGs and ECGs were observed during pivotal studies. Histopathology was not 
performed in Alcon Study N-14-007, therefore it was reported if spleen lymphoid depletion occurred, as 
reported in Alcon Study N-10-104 and Alcon Study N-12-042. Since VEGF inhibitors may have adverse effect 
on overall lymphoid depletion, extra investigation by external pathologist was conducted in order to reanalyse 
the observed effect on spleen. It was concluded that there was no test-article related effect on spleen 
because increase in spleen weights were not statistically significant and no effect were observed on thymus 
or lymph node and no test article-related effects on haematology parameters were underlined.  
Alcon Study N-12-047 was performed in order to demonstrate similarity between the drug substances from 
Biomeva and Lonza. Only one dose was selected corresponding to the highest dose of Alcon Study N-12-042 
i.e. 6mg/eye. Similar conclusion could be made between tolerances of the two drug substances. 
Nevertheless, it has to be underlined that no histopathology was conducted in Alcon Study N-14-007, 
therefore “comparability” was assed via indirect ophthalmic evaluation (IOP, eye observation for swelling, 
inflammation…). Overall the Lonza drug substance was well tolerated at the dose of 6 mg/eye. In addition, 
during scientific advices, the applicant was told that toxicity study on its own would not be sufficient to 
compare the two drug substances and comparability would require sufficient quality data.  
As previously stated, systemic exposure based on free brolucizumab was observed in all treated groups. In 
Alcon Study N-10-104, no statistically significant differences in the serum Cmax and AUC0_168h values 
between Day 1, Day 22 and Day 43 and therefore no accumulation of free brolucizumab was observed. In 
Alcon Study N-12-042, no statistically significant gender differences in the Cmax or AUC0-168 h values and 
therefore values were combined, and no accumulation was observed following repeated administrations. Dose 
proportional increases were observed in Cmax whereas it was less than dose proportional increase regarding 
AUC values. Whereas no gender difference in term of Cmax or AUC values were observed in the other pivotal 
studies, slightly higher values in mean Cmax and AUC were observed for female in Alcon Study N-14-007 
(Lonza drug substance). There was no systemic accumulation of test article. 
Pre-existing ADA were detected in all the studies before administration of brolucizumab. Indeed, in Alcon 
Study N-10-104 pre-existing anti-drug ADA were detected in 27% of animals, 16.7% in Alcon Study N-12-

042 and finally 8.3% of the total animals (1/12) in Alcon Study N-14-007. Since pre-existing brolucizumab 
ADA have been measured, the specificity of the method to identify brolucizumab-ADA is questionable 
although correlation from animal to Human is difficult. In addition, pre-existing brolucizumab ADA have been 
measured in Human during the clinical trials up to 43.7% (884/2023 of the subjects). Regarding levels of 
ADA during pivotal repeated dose toxicity studies, increase was observed after the final injection (6 IVT) in 
Alcon Study N-12-042, wherein ADA levels were up to 47% (17/36 animals). However, no dose-response 
relationship and no correlation between ADA titers and systemic exposure were observed. In Alcon Study N-
14-007, 1/6 animals in each group (untreated and treated) was ADA positive, showing the non-specificity of 
the method. Although, the ELISA method designed to detect anti-brolucizumab seems to lack of specificity, 
no systemic toxicity has been observed in the 3-pivotal repeated dose toxicity studies. 
No genotoxicity studies have been conducted. Since brolucizumab is an antibody fragment, the lack of 
genotoxicity studies is in accordance with the available guideline ICH S6 (R1) and this point is accepted. 
Similarly, no carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with brolucizumab, as noted in ICH S6 (R1), 
standard carcinogenicity bioassays are generally not performed for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals. 
Based on its mechanism of action (VEGF inhibitor), brolucizumab has the potential to impair fertility and 
embryo-foetal development in relation to the degree of systemic VEGF-inhibition. Nevertheless, the absence 
of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies is considered as acceptable in view of the low systemic 
exposure levels after IVT dosing, and the age of the patient population undergoing treatment for neovascular 
(wet) age-related macular degeneration. Potential pharmacologically related effects on fertility and embryo-
fetal development are clearly mentioned in SPC section 4.6, as well as the recommendation for women of 
childbearing potential (WOCBP) which may be treated by brolucizumab to use effective contraception. 
The lack of dedicated local tolerance studies is accepted since this endpoint has been investigated during 
repeated-dose toxicity studies after IVT administration. 
T-cell proliferation assay was selected by the applicant to estimate immunogenicity of brolucizumab. 
Nevertheless, the test article of this assay was not brolucizumab (ESBA1008) but with a variant ESBA1008-
DHP. Modification of the surface by increasing/decreasing hydrophobicity would modify immunogenicity. 
Modification was introduced by mutation on various amino acid positions. Similar approach was used with 
structure-related monoclonal antibody ESBA903 (see Table 31) wherein surface residue was modified in order 
to generate compound ESBA903-DHP. No immunogenic response higher than background response rate was 
observed. It was therefore concluded that the tested monoclonal antibody was weakly immunogenic. 
Concerning studies on impurities, no dedicated studies apart from one of the non-pivotal repeated dose 
toxicity which included groups treated with impurities from pilot batches, have been conducted by the 
applicant. 
Concentrations of free brolucizumab in the vitreous humour were assessed in two different toxicology studies. 
In the first one (TDOC-0011462), vitreous humour was collected 43 days after the second injection (Day 79 
of the study). In all the analysed samples, the concentration of brolucizumab was below the lower limit of 
quantification. In the second study (TDOC-0012707), vitreous humour was collected 21 days after the third 
injection (Day 64 or 65 of the study). Concentrations of brolucizumab were determined using a validated 
method of detection showing that free brolucizumab concentrations in the vitreous humour increased with the 
dose. Similarly, the detection of free brolucizumab three weeks after the last dose indicated that the eye of 
the cynomolgus monkey was exposed to brolucizumab throughout the dose interval. 
The proposed clinical dosing regimen is repeated IVT injections of 6 mg brolucizumab. Nonclinical safety data 
provides a 2-fold ocular margin of safety for the recommended human dose and a 12- and 6-fold systemic 
Assessment report

margin of safety, based on Cmax and AUC respectively (NOAEL corresponds to the highest tested dose in 
Alcon study N-12-042 i.e. 6 mg/eye). The nonclinical studies cover the use of brolucizumab at IVT doses of 
up to 6 mg/eye administered every 3 to 4 weeks. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical data were considered by the CHMP sufficient to support the application for a 
marketing authorisation of Beovu in the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration 
(AMD). 
The CHMP furthermore concluded that Beovu was not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Considering the local administration of the drug and the local acting within the eye, traditional ADME is not 
appropriate. The below sections describe the systemic exposure of brolucizumab after IVT injection. 
As it is not feasible to collect retina, RPE-choroid and other relevant ocular samples from patients, neither the 
bioavailability nor the distribution in ocular tissues was determined. The bioavailability was considered 100% 
in  the  vitreous.  Also,  no  specific  studies  on  distribution  or  to  assess  the  plasma  protein  binding  have  been 
performed, nor were they required. 
Rich PK sampling was performed in phase I and II studies in order to assess the systemic exposure and calculate 
PK parameters of brolucizumab in Caucasian and Japanese patients with nAMD (Study RTH258-E003). Sparse 
PK data to confirm systemic exposure (without calculation of PK parameters) were also available in subjects 
with nAMD in the pivotal Phase III studies RTH258-C001 RTH258-C002.

Systemic exposure  
In initial phase I and II studies (RTH258-C-10-083 and RTH258-E003, respectively) that enrolled patients 
with nAMD, rich PK sampling was performed to document the systemic exposure and calculate PK parameters 
of brolucizumab after IVT injection. Additionally, sparse PK data (trough concentrations at various time-points 
up to two-year treatment) were available to confirm the systemic exposure of brolucizumab in patients with 
nAMD during the pivotal phase III studies (RTH258-C001, RTH258-C002 and A2301E1). 
Two distinct analytical methods were used, throughout the clinical development, to quantify free 
brolucizumab in human serum. An ELISA assay was first used in patients which participated to phase I study 
RTH258-C-10-083, then the IA-LC-MS/MS method was used to measure free brolucizumab for all other 
studies. The two applied analytical methods (ELISA and IA-LC-MS/MS) appear to be adequate and comply 
with acceptance criteria of the bioanalytical method validation EMA Guideline. Description and validation 
reports were provided with satisfactory results regarding precision, accuracy, selectivity and sensitivity, short 
and long-term stability and ISR data.No cross-validation study was performed between the two methods 
since interference testing (free serum VEGF and ADA) was not investigated with the ELISA method. The 
applicant’s proposal to avoid a direct comparison of PK data from phase I study C-10-083 and others PK 
studies is agreed. 
Although the applied methods to detect and quantify ADA and NAb of brolucizumab are satisfactory in terms 
of sensitivity, accuracy and precision, a high proportion of subjects regardless of which treatment they 
subsequently received (43.7% 884/2023 across all studies) were positive for pre-existing anti-brolucizumab 
antibodies. High proportion of positive ADA titers prior to the first injection is not unexpected and has been 
detected in drug-naïve subjects for a variety of antibody fragments of similar structure, such as nanobodies 
and single domain antibodies. Both types of antibody fragments show high prevalence (50% or higher) 
because of epitopes in these constructs being similar to cryptic epitopes that are revealed through the 
catabolism/degradation of immunoglobulins. The lack of selectivity of the ADA method precludes the inclusion 
of positive pre-existing ADA patients in the assessment of the immunogenicity potential of brolucizumab. 
Therefore, the immunogenicity potential of brolucizumab could only be reliably estimated in negative pre-
existing ADA patients 
PK data were analysed using non-compartmental approach (NCA). Analyses were performed using the 
software WinNonlin® Enterprise (version 6.2, Pharsight Corporation). Pharmacokinetic variables, e.g. AUClast, 
AUCinf, Cmax, Cmin, tmax, and t1/2, with standard summary statistics (means, median, SD, CV etc…) were 
calculated. 
The commercial formulation B (solution 120 mg/mL) appears to be different from formulation A used in 
pivotal phase III for efficacy and safety demonstration and for assessment of the systemic exposure in phase 
II study RTH258-E003 (60 and 120 mg/mL). Indeed, in comparison the phase III formulation, the 
concentration of polysorbate 80 is reduced by more than a half (0.02 versus 0.05%) and the pH is not the 
same (7.2 instead of 6.8). The PK/clinical impact of such differences could not be estimated. However, based 
on the quality analytical similarity between the two products (please refer to the quality assessment report), 
these differences are not deemed to significantly impact the PK/clinical drug profile. Thus, conclusions with 
regards to the systemic exposure observed with drug product used in phase II and III studies could be 
extrapolated to the commercial product. 
To note, no formal PK comparability with regards to local bioavailability/distribution of brolucizumab could be 
made between the to-be marketed product and the phase III/II formulation, as no ocular samples could be 
collected.

Study RTH258-C-10-083 
This was a SAD study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of brolucizumab administered by a single IVT 
injection compared with ranibizumab in patients with nAMD. Overall, 191 subjects completed the study: 10, 
35, 48 and 40 subjects were in the brolucizumab 0.5, 3, 4.5 and 6 mg group, respectively; and 61 in the 
ranibizumab group. 
Overall, the systemic brolucizumab levels were low but quantifiable for up to two weeks post-dose in most 
patients. The peak serum brolucizumab concentration was observed in the first time point after dosing (day 
1). Then brolucizumab levels demonstrated a mono-exponential decay with mean (±SD) T1/2 of 5.01(±2.97) 
days.  
For the 6mg dose (relevant dose in clinical practice), the mean (±SD) Cmax and AUClast were 8.53 (±7.27) 
ng/mL and 64.18 (51.41) ng*d/mL, respectively. The highest Cmax value was 42.10 ng/mL. All samples 
collected at day 30 post-dose were below the LLoQ (0.5 ng/mL) except for 5 patients with the highest value 
at D30 being 1.94 ng/mL.  
Study RTH258-E003 (SHRIKE) 
This is a pivotal PK study to assess the systemic exposure, ocular and systemic safety, and immunogenicity 
of brolucizumab after IVT injection in patients (Japanese and non-Japanese ancestry) with nAMD. 
The study evaluated 2 doses (3 and 6 mg) of brolucizumab in 50 patients (25 in each group), including 26 
subjects of Japanese ancestry (13 in each treatment group). In each arm, 3 repeated brolucizumab dose was 
injected monthly on Days 0, 28, and 56.  
PK after the first dose 
Following IVT injection of brolucizumab, the systemic levels were low but quantifiable for up to four weeks 
post-dose in most subjects. The peak serum brolucizumab concentration was low and generally observed 
within the first day following dosing (ie, at either 6- or 24-hours after injection). After that, the drug 
concentration declined in a mono-exponential fashion with a harmonic mean T1/2 of approximately 4.5 days. 
Pre-existing ADA status had no impact on the half-life of free brolucizumab. 
The overall mean serum brolucizumab concentration versus time profiles are plotted in Figure 2. Descriptive 
statistics for the overall PK parameters are presented in Table 5.

Table 5: Descriptive statistics for brolucizumab PK parameters after single IVT injection. 
For the 6mg dose (relevant dose in clinical practice), the mean (±SD) Cmax and AUClast were 77.6 (±106) 
ng/mL and 9160 (±12300) ng*d/mL, respectively. These reflects a high inter-individual variability of the 
systemic exposure and a non-Gaussian distribution (medians for Cmax and AUClast of 59.2 ng/mL and 4450 
ng*d/mL, respectively different from means). The inter-subject variability (%CV) for brolucizumab could be 
estimated to range between 128 to 210% for Cmax and AUCs. The highest Cmax value was 548 ng/mL and 
highest AUClast was 59400 ng*d/mL. The geometric mean (±SE) concentrations of bromucizumab at D28 
(C28d) was 0.6 ng/mL (±0.116) with the highest measured value at D28 being 5.32 ng/mL.  
Based on the findings of study RTH258-E003 in patients with nAMD, the systemic exposure (Cmax, AUCs) of 
free brolucizumab appears to increase in a greater than dose proportional manner following IVT injection of 
brolucizumab doses (3 and 6 mg). Indeed, the geometric means of Cmax increased by 5- fold (9.76 to 49 
ng/mL) while those of AUCinf increased by more than 3-fold (1710 to from 6000 ng*h/mL) with a 2-fold 
increase in dose (3 to 6 mg).  
Accumulation 
To provide some information about the potential systemic accumulation of brolucizumab after repeated IVT 
dosing, the free brolucizumab concentration 24 hours (C24h, taken as reflect of Cmax) after the third dose 
(Day 57) was compared with the concentration of brolucizumab 24 hours after the first dose (Day 1). For 
both the 3 and 6 mg dose levels, the geometric means of C24h ratios (dose 3/dose1) were slightly below 1: 
0.69 and 0.78, respectively. Similarly, scatter plot of the values of C24h Day 57 versus those of Day 1 shows 
the time points to be well distributed about the identity line with no clustering by either dose (3 mg vs 6 mg)

or ancestry (Japanese or non-Japanese). This suggests that no meaningful systemic accumulation of 
brolucizumab was observed between the first and third injection for patients with nAMD regardless of dose (3 
mg vs 6 mg). This finding appears to be confirmed by the very low geometric mean (±SE) concentrations of 
brolucizumab at D84 (D28 after third dose) found to be 0.556 (± 0.112) ng/mL (close to LLoQ =0.5 ng/mL) 
and comparable to levels at D28 after the first injection (0.601 ng/mL ±0.116). 
Studies RTH258-C001 and C002 
In these pivotal phase III, two-year studies designed to compare efficacy and safety of brolucizumab 6 mg 
(and 3 mg for study RTH258-C001) with aflibercept 2 mg in subjects with nAMD, ssubjects received 3 
monthly loading doses followed by q12w/q8w maintenance regimen for brolucizumab 6 or 3 mg up to two 
years. To note, this is the recommended dosing regimen in the SmPC. 
Sparse trough brolucizumab serum concentrations for subjects receiving brolucizumab were collected prior to 
dosing and at Week 12, Week 24, Week 36, Week 48, Week 68 and Week 88 (plus Week 4, Week 12 for 
RTH258-C001).  
Descriptive statistics for free brolucizumab serum concentration (ng/mL) are displayed in Table 6 and Table 
7, respectively for study RTH258-C001 and C002.

Table 7: Descriptive statistics for free brolucizumab serum concentration (ng/mL) in study Study 
RTH258-C002 
Overall, the free brolucizumab serum concentrations appear to be low. In both studies, the geometric mean 
and the median concentration were below the LLoQ across the various time-points, except for the time-point 
Week 12 in study RTH258-C002. The maximum concentration observed at each time-point ranged between 
2.70 ng/mL to 117 ng/mL (RTH258-C001) and between 3.18 ng/mL to 44.3 ng/mL (RTH258-C002) with no 
consistent change in trough brolucizumab concentration across the time-points.  
Conclusively, PK data from study RTH258-E003 and pivotal phase III studies in patients with nAMD supported 
a low systemic exposure following IVT injection of Brolucizumab. In clinical practice, brolucizumab is to be 
administered monthly for the first three doses and thereafter every 8 or 12 weeks. No systemic accumulation 
of free brolucizumab is expected after repeated administration (up to two-year treatment).  
Special populations 
No formal study investigating the effect of renal impairment on the systemic exposure of brolucizumab after 
IVT injection has been performed. 
In study RTH258-E003, the systemic exposure of brolucizumab was evaluated by renal impairment status 
using creatinine clearance (calculated using the MDRD equation) as a measure of renal function. The mean 
systemic clearance of brolucizumab (CL= 1690 mL/h) in subjects with mild (50-79 mL/min [n=13]) renal 
impairment was found within 15% of the mean clearance rate (CL =1910 mL/h) for subjects with normal 
renal function (≥80 mL/min [n=25]). Subjects with moderate (30-49 mL/min (n=3) renal impairment had a 
mean systemic clearance (CL= 1320 mL/h) approximately 30 % lower than subjects with normal renal 
function. Based on these results, the applicant proposes to not adjust the dosing regimen for mild and 
moderate renal impairment. Based on the results of an additional analysis following re-grading patients 
according to the recommended renal impairment classification as per EU guideline EMA/CHMP/83874/2014 
(normal ≥ 90 mL/min, mild 60- <90 mL/min and moderate renal impairment 30- <60 mL/min), it could be 
agreed that no significant impact of mild and moderate renal impairment on the overall systemic exposure of 
brolucizumab is to be expected. For severe renal impairment, no PK/ clinical data were available. The lack of 
such data in this subgroup is clearly implemented in the SmPC.

No formal study investigating the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of Brolucizumab has been 
performed, and no study is requested. Mild and moderate hepatic impairment is not expected to impact the 
systemic exposure of brolucizumab and no dose adjustment is required in this subgroup of patients.  
Gender is unlikely to influence the systemic exposure of this product applied in the eye or eyes. RTH258-
E003: no consistent difference in the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC inf) of brolucizumab were shown 
between males and females. 
Similarly, weight is unlikely to influence the systemic exposure of this product applied in the eye or eyes. 
The impact of race on the systemic exposure brolucizumab was investigated study RTH258-E003. Of the 50 
patients enrolled, n= 26 Japanese (13 subjects in each dose group 3 and 6 mg) and n =24 non-Japanese (12 
subjects in each dose group) ancestry were included. 
Following IVT injection of brolucizumab, serum drug concentrations versus time curves show no marked or 
consistent difference between subjects of Japanese and non-Japanese ancestry. Similarly, comparison of PK 
parameters based on ancestry showed no consistent or meaningful differences. Indeed, the distribution of 
these parameters (Cmax, AUCs) by ancestry confirms that any differences in the mean PK parameters are 
driven by individual differences between subjects, rather than reflecting any systematic effect of ancestry on 
the PK of brolucizumab. Overall, these results support that the systemic exposure of brolucizumab was 
comparable between Japanese and Caucasian patients.  
In study RTH258-E003 (n=50), most of subjects were in the age categories of 65 to 74 years (n= 22, 
44.0%) or 75 to 84 years (n= 18, 36.0%). Only 3 patients were aged 85 years or above. To explore the 
potential impact of age on the systemic exposure of brolucizumab after IVT injection descriptive statistics and 
box plots of free serum brolucizumab Cmax and AUCs by age groups were provided. Based on these data, 
and despite the scarcity of the sample size in each group, the systemic exposure of brolucizumab appears to 
be comparable to marginally lower in the oldest patient groups. Importantly, no systemic overexposure in the 
oldest groups (65 to 74 years, 75 to 84 years and age > 85 years) was observed compared to patients <65 
years old. Overall, taking into account the comparable systemic exposure levels of brolucizumab across age 
groups and the fact that no significant overexposure in the oldest patient groups (on the contrary a trend to a 
lower exposure was observed), it could be agreed that age is not expected to have a significant impact on the 
systemic brolucizumab exposure. 
Pharmacokinetics was not assessed in the paediatric population, since nAMD does not occur in this 
population.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Brolucizumab and VEGF do not bind to cytokines that modulate the expression of CYP450 isozymes or drug 
transporters and therefore should not have the potential to indirectly alter the clearance rate of small 
molecule drugs that are metabolized or transported by these pathways. Therefore, no specific drug-drug 
interaction studies were performed.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The key functional property of brolucizumab is its ability to bind to human VEGF-A and prevent VEGF-A 
binding to the VEGF receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, thereby neutralizing its activity by halting the growth of 
neovascular lesion and to reducing retinal thickness. Brolucizumab was designed by grafting the binding 
regions of a novel anti-VEGF antibody onto a proprietary human scFv scaffold, combining optimized 
biophysical properties with potent, high-affinity anti-VEGF attributes.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No  dedicated  studies  have  been  performed  by  the  Applicant  to  investigate  pharmacodynamic  as  the 
concentration of VEGF in the serum is not known to be directly associated with the VEGF concentration in the 
eye. 
However, an anatomical evaluation has been performed along the Phase III studies showing an improvement 
in anatomical parameters (i.e., CSFT, SRF, IRF, sub-RPE fluid). 
Additionally, nonclinical studies have demonstrated the PD effect of brolucizumab on retinal vascular 
permeability and choroidal neovascularisation. 
Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Brolucizumab is a humanized single-chain Fv antibody fragment inhibitor of VEGF with a molecular weight of 
~26 kDa developed for the treatment of nAMD.  
Subjects with nAMD have elevated ocular concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which 
is thought to play a key role in the neovascularization process. The key functional property of brolucizumab is 
its ability to bind to human VEGF-A and prevent VEGF-A binding to the VEGF receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, 
thereby neutralizing its activity. 
Some concerns were raised with regards to bioanalysis methods (including long term stability data). In the 
responses to Day 120 list of questions, the applicant confirms that all samples for the pivotal PK study were 
performed within the demonstrated stability of 538 days, although in study RTH258-C002, 99.9% of the 
samples and 95.8% of the samples in RTH258-C001 are covered by the established 538 days of long term 
stability (LTS). According to the applicant, additional LTS experiment is ongoing.  The issue can be considered 
as resolved. 
The lack investigations on metabolism and excretory pathways is acceptable, as metabolism and elimination 
of brolucizumab is assumed to be similar to other proteins, which are mainly eliminated by renal route, and 
catabolized by lysosomal proteolysis (to small peptides or amino acids) and then eliminated (no specific 
route), with limited effect of single organs on the overall elimination. 
Based on these results of study RTH258-E003, no significant impact of mild and moderate renal impairment 
on the overall systemic exposure of brolucizumab is expected. For severe renal impairment, no PK/ clinical 
data were available. The lack of such data in this subgroup is clearly implemented in the SmPC.   
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 49/117 
 
  
  
Overall, considering the comparable systemic exposure levels of brolucizumab across age groups and the fact 
that no significant overexposure in the oldest patient groups was observed, it could be agreed that age is not 
expected to have a significant impact on the systemic brolucizumab exposure. 
No dedicated pharmacodynamics (PD) studies have been conducted, as the concentration of VEGF in the 
serum is not known to be directly associated with the VEGF concentration in the eye. However, an anatomical 
evaluation had been performed along the Phase III studies showing an improvement in anatomical 
parameters (i.e., CSFT, SRF, IRF, sub-RPE fluid). Additionally, nonclinical studies have demonstrated the PD 
effect of brolucizumab on retinal vascular permeability and choroidal neovascularisation. 
Serum concentrations of brolucizumab in this study were measured using an ELISA method which was 
subsequently found to no longer be reliable. This was due to lack of standard curve ruggedness and 
selectivity as the original lot of biotinylated detection antibody was no longer available. Moreover, this study 
used an initial drug product which is different from formulation A used in phase III for efficacy and safety 
demonstration and from the commercial product. Therefore, PK data from this study are to be interpreted 
with caution and to not be combined with other PK data as no cross-validation data were provided between 
the analytical methods. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall the pharmacokinetics of brolucizumab have been thoroughly investigated and well described.  
No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with brolucizumab. It is intended that intravitreal 
injection would allow adequate vitreous concentration to bind ocular VEGF. Nonclinical studies together with 
anatomical evaluation in Phase III studies suggest that brolucizumab, by binding VEGF, has a PD effect on 
neovascular lesions and retinal thickness. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical study program consists of 2 randomized, double-masked, multicentre, active-controlled (versus 
aflibercept 2 mg) studies (RTH258-C001 [HAWK study] and RTH258-C002 [HARRIER study]) trials to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of brolucizumab administrated intravitreally. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The selection of the dose of brolucizumab is based on a Phase I study (C-10-083 – SEE study) and a Phase II 
study (C-12-006 – OSPREY study), with the additional consideration that from the quality point of view 
brolucizumab cannot be formulated to deliver a concentration of more than 6 mg in a 50 μl dose. 
C-10-083 (SEE study) 
SEE Study is a multicenter, double-masked, randomized, single ascending dose (0.5, 3.0, 4.5, and 6 mg), 
active-controlled, parallel-group Phase I study, intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single 
intravitreal administration of brolucizumab solution at different doses, compared with ranibizumab 0.5 mg in 
subjects with primary subfoveal choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD. Patients received a single 
dose at D0 followed by visits scheduled at Day 1, then every two weeks until Month 3, and monthly until 
Month 6.  
The study population included males and females who were 50 years of age and older and were diagnosed 
with primary CNV secondary to AMD in the study eye. Subjects (n=194) were randomized within dosing 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 50/117 
 
  
  
cohorts to receive either brolucizumab 0.5mg (n=10), 3.0mg (n=35), 4.5mg (n=48) and 6.0mg (n=40), or 
ranibizumab 0.5mg (n=61). The same number of patients were evaluable for intent-to-treat analysis.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from Baseline to Month 1 in central subfield thickness (CSFT) 
as measured by SD-OCT analysed in a non-inferiority setting. The secondary efficacy endpoint was the 
duration of effect measured by time from randomization to receipt of standard of care (SOC) as determined 
by the Investigator using protocol-specified criteria. Change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity 
(BCVA) had been also measured for supportive outcomes. 
As the maximum benefit, for instance in visual function (BCVA) was not expected to be reached with a single 
dose, this study cannot be considered as true dose-response study. Together with the limited number of 
patients (especially for 0.5 mg brolucizumab group, n=10) and the early primary endpoint, provided 
outcomes are preliminary dose response tendencies.  
IVT injections of single doses of brolucizumab were associated with improvements in CSFT and in BCVA at 
Month 1. The non-inferiority versus ranibizumab 0.5 mg was met for the 4.5 mg and the 6 mg dose. 
However, differences in CSFT between 3 mg, 4.5 mg and 6 mg versus ranibizumab were numerically small 
(with 90% CI, respectively 23.82 µm [-6.58, 54.23], 22.86 μm [-9.28, 54.99] and 19.40 μm [-9.00, 47.80]). 
Similarly, small differences were measured for the 3 tested drug concentrations (3 mg, 4.5 mg and 6 mg), in 
BCVA at Month 1.5 respectively 6.7, 7.2 and 10.4 letters, respectively. Although CSFT outcomes were 
numerically in favour of the 4.5 mg dose, BCVA was numerically in favour of the 6 mg dose. Usually, it is 
preferred to select the lowest dose to minimise adverse effects that is commensurate with adequate efficacy.  
A trend towards a longer duration of effect (secondary efficacy endpoint) was observed in each brolucizumab 
group relative to the ranibizumab group. The median times to receiving SOC for subjects in the brolucizumab 
3.0, 4.5, and 6.0 mg groups were 75.0, 67.5, and 75.0 days, respectively; the median time to receiving SOC 
for subjects in the ranibizumab group was 45.0 days. 
The mean changes from Baseline in BCVA (a supportive efficacy parameter in this study) observed were 
consistently larger in the brolucizumab 6.0 mg group than that observed in the ranibizumab group and all 
brolucizumab lower doses (e.g., mean change in BCVA at Month 1.5 was 6.0, 6.7, 7.2 and 10.4 letters in the 
0.5, 3, 4.5 and 6 mg brolucizumab doses, respectively). 
C-12-006 (OSPREY study) 
C-12-006 was a prospective, randomized (1:1), double-masked, multicentre, two-arm study to further assess 
efficacy and safety of treatment with brolucizumab at a dose of 6 mg compared to aflibercept 2 mg. The total 
duration of the study was 56 weeks. 
The study population was comprised of 90 subjects who were ≥ 50 years of age with untreated active 
choroidal neovascularization due to AMD in the study eye. 
After a loading phase of 3 monthly injections (q4w), subjects were treated every 8 weeks (q8w) up to Week 
32. After Week 32, subjects randomized to aflibercept 2 mg continued a q8w interval, (i.e., received 2 
injections at Weeks 40 and 48), while subjects randomized to brolucizumab were switched to a quarterly 
regimen (q12w) receiving only one additional injection at Week 44.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in BCVA from baseline at Week 12. The statistical hypothesis 
for the primary efficacy endpoint was to demonstrate non-inferiority of brolucizumab to aflibercept using a 
non-inferiority margin of 5 letters and a 1-sided alpha of 0.1, in subjects with primary subfoveal choroidal 
neovascularization secondary to AMD. Superiority was evaluated at a 1-sided alpha of 0.1 once non-
inferiority was concluded. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the change in BCVA from baseline at Week 16. The statistical 
hypothesis for the key secondary efficacy endpoint was to demonstrate non-inferiority of brolucizumab to 
aflibercept. 
Incidence and size of hemorrhages secondary to AMD had been also assessed for supportive outcomes. 
Regarding the primary objective, the least squares (LS) estimate of the mean BCVA change from Baseline to 
Week 12 was 5.75 letters in the brolucizumab 6 mg arm and 6.89 letters in the aflibercept 2 mg arm. The LS 
estimate of the mean difference between treatment arms in BCVA changes from Baseline to Week 12 was 
−1.13 letters, with the lower limit of the 80% CI being −4.19 letters. Thus, non-inferiority was met.

Regarding the secondary study objectives, the LS estimate of the mean BCVA change from Baseline to Week 
16  was  6.04  letters  in  the  brolucizumab  6  mg  group  and  6.62  letters  in  the  aflibercept  2  mg  arm.  The  LS 
estimate of the mean difference between treatment arms in the BCVA changes from Baseline at Week 16 was 
−0.58 letters, with the lower limit of the 80% CI being −3.72 letters. Thus, non-inferiority of brolucizumab 6 
mg to aflibercept 2 mg was demonstrated. 
Below are presented the LS estimates of the mean BCVA change from Baseline over the all duration of the 
study.

A further secondary efficacy endpoint was change in central subfield thickness (CSFT) from baseline by visit 
up to Week 40 (= study period allowing for head to head comparison based on the same treatment 
schedule).The LS mean changes from Baseline in CSFT in the brolucizumab 6 mg group during the q8w 
period ranged from −209.90 to −182.25 μm and in the aflibercept 2 mg group from −201.95 to −155.34 μm. 
These Phase II results provide support for the regimens selected for Phase III (launching phase, q8w and 
q12W). 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
RTH258-C001 (HAWK study) and RTH258-C002 (HARRIER study) 
Methods 
The design of these both Phase III studies is globally similar: randomized, double-masked, multicentre, 
active-controlled clinical trials to compare the efficacy and safety of brolucizumab 6 mg versus aflibercept 2 
mg (Eylea®) in subjects with CNV due to AMD who had not received prior anti-VEGF treatments. 
The total studies duration was 96 weeks. 
The main differences in study design were that the HAWK study included a brolucizumab 3 mg treatment arm 
in addition to the 6 mg arm, and HARRIER study included additional disease activity assessments for 
potential adjusting from q12w to q8w. 
It is to emphasize that the selected comparator for the both studies is aflibercept 2 mg IVT (Eylea®). 
Contrary to the initial development plan, as presented in the Scientific Advice 
EMA/CHMPA/SAWP/550707/2013, ranibizumab 0.5 mg IVT (Lucentis®) had been fully discarded. The efficacy 
of aflibercept had been demonstrated through 2 Phase III studies (VIEW 1 and VIEW 2) in a non-inferiority 
setting versus ranibizumab. There is thus a potential risk of biocreep. Indeed, in the hypothesis that 
aflibercept would be slightly inferior to ranibizumab, although in the non-inferiority margin, and that 
brolucizumab would be slightly inferior to aflibercept, although in the non-inferiority margin, this could lead at 
the end of the day to a lower efficacy. However, it is acknowledged that aflibercept 2 mg is considered to 
date as a standard of care as ranibizumab 0.5 mg. Thus, it is unlikely that demonstrating that brolucizumab 
is non-inferior to aflibercept lead to a loss of efficacy. Additionally, the applicant justified the choice of 
aflibercept as comparator for the both Phase III studies by the fact that:  
- 
The use of the same comparator in both Phase III studies allowed for confirmation and external 
validation of the study results; 
- 
Ranibizumab had a different posology in the US (monthly injections) than in other countries including 
Europe (3-times monthly loading doses followed by a pro-re-nata regimen). 
The regimen for aflibercept was fixed after the loading phase to every 2 months. No personalised treatment 
was allowed, even after Month 12, despite that it was authorized at the time of the studies in the Summary 
of Product Characteristic of Eylea® from the second year. The total number of injections was thus maintained 
in the control groups regardless of the disease activity of the patients, contrary to the brolucizumab groups 
for which every 3 months administration was permitted. Consequently, the clinical development does not 
allow to demonstrate strong conclusion on the reduction of the treatment burden of brolucizumab 3 mg or 6 
mg compared to a standard of care.

Study Participants  
The study population consisted of subjects ≥ 50 years of age with active CNV due to AMD who were not 
previously treated with anti-VEGF therapy. The inclusion and the exclusion criteria were consistent with the 
target population. 
Main ocular inclusion criteria were: 
• 
Active CNV lesions secondary to AMD that affected the central subfield (including retinal angiomatous 
proliferation lesions with a CNV component) in the study eye at Screening and confirmed by the Central 
Reading Center (CRC), 
• 
Total area of CNV (including both classic and occult components) must have comprised > 50% of the 
total lesion area in the study eye at Screening and confirmed by the CRC, 
• 
Intraretinal and/or subretinal fluid (SRF) affecting the central subfield of the study eye at Screening 
and confirmed by the CRC, 
• 
BCVA between 78 and 23 letters, inclusive, in the study eye at Screening and Baseline using Early 
Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) testing. 
Subjects who received any approved or investigational treatment for nAMD (other than vitamin supplements) 
in the study eye at any time were excluded of the studies. 
HAWK study was conducted in centres in North America, Latin America, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and 
Israel, whereas HARRIER study was conducted in centres in the EU, Middle East, Asia and Russia. 
Overall, in HAWK study approximately 990 subjects (330 per treatment arm) were planned for randomization 
across approximately 320 study centres. In HARRIER study approximately 660 subjects (330 per treatment 
arm) were planned for randomization across approximately 200 study centres. In both studies subjects who 
discontinued the study were not replaced. 
The upper baseline BCVA limit for inclusion was 78 letters. It is supported that source population should 
reflect current usual practice where patients can be treated early in the course of the disease despite a mild 
impairment only. Nonetheless, given that 84 letters is equivalent to a 20/20 visual acuity, these patients 
have less amplitude for improvement, inferior to the effect size observed in the more impaired patients. 
Therefore, the limited room for improvement may not allow to observe a difference between aflibercept and 
brolucizumab if exists. To that extent, subset analysis by BCVA at Baseline will be of importance, showing 
that non inferiority is met while removing less impaired patients. It is also noted that the upper limit of 73 
letters had been used in VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 studies to demonstrate the non-inferiority of Eylea® compared 
to Lucentis®. 
Additionally only naïve patients were enrolled in the phase III studies. Subjects having not received any 
approved treatment for wAMD were excluded.  
Treatments 
The doses for Phases III were chosen based on the results of the Phase I SEE study (assessing the 0.5, 3.0, 
4.5,  and  6  mg  doses)  and  the  Phase  II  OSPREY  study  (assessing  the  6  mg  dose).  It  was  observed  that 
brolucizumab doses below 3 mg had an inferior efficacy at Month 1 compared to ranibizumab 0.5 mg. 
The 6 mg dose was tested in both studies, whereas the 3 mg dose was tested in the HAWK study only 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 55/117 
 
  
  
Patients in all treatment arms received 3 monthly loading doses (Day 0, Week 4 and Week 8) based on the 
fact  that  the  efficacy  of  this  regimen  had  been  demonstrated  for  other  anti  VEGF  products  used  in  AMD. 
Additionally, supportive data had been also provided along the Phase II OSPREY study results. 
The loading phase was followed by maintenance regimens: 
• brolucizumab 3 mg, every 12 weeks (q12w)/every 8 weeks (q8w) (HAWK study only), 
• brolucizumab 6 mg, q12w/q8w, 
• aflibercept 2 mg, q8w. 
“Q12w/q8w”  maintenance  regimen  represents  a  treatment  regimen  where  the  interval  could  be  adjusted 
according  to  the  subject's  individual  treatment  need  as  identified  by  disease  activity  assessments  (DAAs) 
performed by the masked investigator at pre-specified visits (week 16, week 20, week 32, week 44, week 56, 
week 68, week 80 and week 92 in HAWK study and week 16, week 20, week 28, week 32, week 40, week 44, 
week 52, week 56, week 64, week 68, week 76, week 80, week 88, and week 92 in HARRIER study). 
Within the q12w/q8w regimen, the initial treatment after the loading phase was q12w. If disease activity was 
identified by the masked investigator in brolucizumab-treated patients at any of the DAAs, dosing was adjusted 
to q8w (“q12w/q8w regimen”). Once subjects were adjusted to a q8w interval, they stayed on that interval 
until the end of the study (Week 96/Exit).

b) HARRIER study 
The regimen every 8 weeks (q8w) and every 12 weeks (q12w) is supported. However, it is to note that patients 
switched to q8w were not able to switch back on q12w. If this design is appropriate to assess the probability 
to stay on q12w over the time (see section regarding objectives), this might be not representative of the real-
life conditions where intervals between treatments can be re-extended. 
Additionally, individualized regimen, Pro Re Nata (PRN) or Treat-and-Extend (T-&-E), had not been investigated 
in neither of the two-Phase III studies. 
Disease activity guidance criteria at Week 16 were: 
• Decrease in BCVA of ≥ 5 letters compared with Baseline, 
• Decrease in BCVA of ≥ 3 letters and CSFT increase ≥ 75 μm compared with Week 12, 
• Decrease in BCVA of ≥ 5 letters due to nAMD disease activity compared with Week 12, 
• New or worse intraretinal fluid (IRF)/intraretinal cysts compared with Week 12. 
Disease activity guidance criterion at Weeks 20, 28, 32, 40, and 44 was: 
• Decrease in BCVA of ≥ 5 letters due to nAMD disease activity compared with Week 12. 
Disease activity guidance criterion at Weeks 52, 56, 64, 68, 76, 80, 88, and 92 was: 
• Decrease in BCVA of ≥ 5 letters due to nAMD disease activity compared with Week 48. 
Guidance  criteria for disease  activity at Week  16 are  acceptable. Nonetheless, those  were less stringent for 
visits from Week 20. It is not clear why the criteria were not same over the entire duration of the study, and 
whether this change might influence the estimation of the probability for a patient to remain on q12w regimen.  
Objectives 
• 
Primary objective  
The primary objective was to demonstrate that the efficacy brolucizumab 6 mg (additional 3 mg arm in 
HAWK study) is not inferior to aflibercept 2 mg, which is a standard of care medication, which is supported 
despite the concerns raised above regarding the choice of the comparator. 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 57/117 
 
  
  
 
 
 
•  Secondary objectives 
Key secondary objectives assessed the maintenance of patients treated with brolucizumab on q12w regimen, 
globally (“maintaining on q12w”) and in subjects with no need of q8w at Week 16 or Week 20 (“remaining on 
q12w”). 
Additional secondary objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability of brolucizumab relative to 
aflibercept and to assess anatomical parameters of disease activity. 
Besides, following Week 48 results in the HARRIER study, additional hypotheses testing for superiority of 
brolucizumab versus aflibercept were added in HAWK study. For each dose (3mg and 6 mg) change in CSFT 
from baseline and retinal fluid status were assessed at Week 16, Week 48 and the period Week 36 through 
Week 48. Disease activity was assessed at Week 16 and at Week 48. However, the selection of these 
outcomes and timepoints over others for superiority testing were not justified and visual acuity had not been 
chosen. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was mean BCVA change from Baseline to Week 48. 
The second and third key secondary endpoints were as follows: 
• 
The proportion of subjects receiving q12w (1 injection every 12 weeks) up to Week 48 in the 
brolucizumab 6 mg treatment arm (“maintaining on q12w”), 
• 
The predictive value of the first (“initial”) q12w cycle for maintenance of q12w treatment up to Week 
48 in the brolucizumab 6 mg treatment arm (“remaining on q12w”). 
Further secondary or exploratory endpoints were changes up to Week 96 of BCVA, responder analysis in 
visual acuity, and anatomical parameters of disease activity including central subfield thickness (CSFT), CNV 
area, and retinal fluids. Exploratory endpoints included also assessment of the Quality of life assessed 
through the VFQ-25 questionnaire. 
Sample size 
A sample size of 297 subjects per treatment arm was considered sufficient to demonstrate non-inferiority 
(margin = 4 letters) of brolucizumab 3 mg/6 mg versus aflibercept 2 mg with respect to the change in BCVA 
from Baseline to Week 48 at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05 with a power of approximately 90%, assuming 
equal efficacy and a common SD of 15 letters. 
A power of at least 90% can be expected for the first key secondary efficacy endpoint, assuming that 
averaging over the 4 time points would not lead to an increase in the SD. 
To account for a dropout rate of 10%, a total of 330 subjects were planned for randomization into each 
treatment arm. A total of 990 subjects was planned for randomisation in HAWK study (3mg group, 6 mg 
group and aflibercept group), and a total of 660 subject was planned for randomisation in HAWK study (6 mg 
group and aflibercept group).

Randomisation  
After confirmation of eligibility at Baseline, subjects were randomized centrally, using an Interactive 
Response Technology, to brolucizumab 3mg (HAWK study only), brolucizumab 6 mg and aflibercept 2 mg in a 
respectively 1:1:1 ratio and 1:1 ratio. 
At Baseline, all eligible subjects were randomized  centrally using an Interactive Response  Technology (IRT) 
system in a (1:)1:1 ratio to receive one of the study treatments. The unmasked injecting Investigator or his/her 
unmasked delegate contacted the IRT after confirming that the subject met all the inclusion and none of the 
exclusion criteria. The IRT assigned a randomization number to the subject, which was used to link the subject 
to a treatment arm and specified a unique medication number for the first package of study treatment to be 
administered to the subject. The randomization number was not communicated to unmasked staff. 
A member of the Statistical Programming group who was not part of the study team generated the randomized 
allocation  for  the  study  treatment  assignment  based  on  a  randomization  plan  that  provided  study  specific 
criteria for randomization, including block size and randomization ratio. 
Central randomization, without stratification by investigational site, was employed. 
Subjects who discontinued the study were not replaced. 
Blinding (masking) 
This  was  a  double-masked  study.  The  subjects,  investigators,  study  centre  staff  (except  for  the  unmasked 
study centre personnel and unmasked injecting physician), Sponsor personnel (except for those who have been 
delegated  responsibility  for  working  with  the  study  treatment),  and  data  analysts  remained  masked  to  the 
identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until Week 48 and final database locks. 
Sham injections were administered to establish an identical monthly injection schedule across treatment 
arms given the differences of regimen. To maintain the masking and data integrity, at least 2 investigators 
(and corresponding study centre staff) were involved in the study at each study centre: 1 masked 
(evaluating) investigator performed all assessments and captured data in the electronic data capture system, 
and 1 unmasked (treating) investigator administered the randomized study treatment according to the 
protocol. The investigators were to maintain the same role throughout the study. 
Statistical methods 
Related to the primary objective, the statistical analysis plan for both studies specified 4 and 2 non-inferiority 
hypotheses (for HAWK and HARRIER respectively) to be tested hierarchically, in a pre-specified order. Each 
of these 4 non-inferiority hypotheses exceeded the threshold for statistical significance (one-sided p<0.025). 
Non-inferiority testing related to the primary efficacy parameter BCVA was based on a margin of 4 letters. 
This is acceptable since it is generally admitted that a change in BCVA is clinically significant from 5 letters. 
FAS and PPS were properly used to assess primary endpoint, according to guidelines on non-inferiority 
testing. Moreover, the definition of the analysis population is appropriate: 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 59/117 
 
  
  
 
 
• 
The full analysis set (FAS)  
FAS included all randomized subjects who received at least 1 IVT injection of study 
treatment. The FAS served as the primary analysis set for all efficacy analyses and represented the analysis 
set that was as close as possible to the intent-to-treat principle of including all randomized subjects. The 
subjects in the FAS were analysed according to the treatment arm they were assigned at randomization. 
• 
The per protocol analysis set (PPS)  
PPS was a subset of the FAS that excluded subjects with protocol deviations and violations of 
analysis requirements that were expected to majorly affect the validity of the assessment of efficacy at Week 
48. These violations included, but were not limited to, lack of compliance (including study treatment 
misallocation), missing data, use of prohibited concomitant medications, and deviations from the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Discontinuation from study treatment due to a lack of efficacy did not constitute a 
reason for exclusion from the PPS. Supportive analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were 
performed using the PPS. The subjects in the PPS were analysed according to the treatment arm they were 
assigned at randomization. 
• 
The safety analysis set (SAF) 
SAF included all subjects who received at least 1 IVT injection. Subjects in the SAF were 
analysed according to the study treatment from which they received a majority of treatments up to and 
including Week 44. 
No alpha adjustment was applied for testing the hypotheses for the primary and first key secondary efficacy 
analyses. However, a hierarchically procedure, in a pre-specified order, has been set to handle multiple 
comparison in primary and first key secondary endpoint. 
Sensitivity analysis used a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) approach (without LOCF imputation). 
Co-factor were the age, BCVA at Baseline, visits and interaction treatment x visits. 
Taking anti-VEGF rescue therapy in the treated eye was a cause of censoring the response to treatment 
(BCVA score). A complementary analysis not considering this intercurrent event would have been welcome in 
order to evaluate this treatment intake in terms of care strategy. Unfortunately, it is unclear whether the 
BCVA score was assessed beyond the event during the 96-weeks follow-up. Furthermore, and according to 
tables 14.3-4.6a of the HAWK study and HARRIER CSRs, it seems that few subjects used this type of 
alternative during the study (2 to 3%). However, in order to detail a bit further this possible strategy of care, 
the following descriptive statistics per arm in the concerned patients should be provided: average time of 
onset of anti-VEGF rescue in the treated eye through the 96-weeks follow-up as well as the variation of BCVA 
score at 48 and 96 weeks. Nonetheless, due to the lack of information on taking anti-VEGF rescue therapy 
after the 48-week efficacy study window, the requested analyses could not be provided by the Applicant. 
Rescue therapy was a strong reason for patient discontinuation because it was a censoring event in 
Applicant's phase 3 trials. This missing information would be of important matter because the 96 weeks 
treatment could have allowed a more complete exploration of the treatment efficacy as a treatment policy.

The SAP for this study was amended based on the outcome from study RTH258–C002. This amendment was 
finalized  prior  to  the  DBL.  The  amendment  introduced  additional  hypotheses  testing  for  superiority  of 
brolucizumab  versus  aflibercept  related  to  CSFT,  retinal  fluid,  and  disease  activity.  Correspondingly,  the 
analysis  plan  also  pre-specified  a  proper  management  of  the  global  alpha-level  in  relation  to  the  resulting 
multiple testing. As these hypotheses were derived from an independent source (HARRIER study) and were 
pre-specified  prior  to  unmasking  of  this  study  all  related  statistical  significances  for  superiority  provide 
confirmatory evidence. 
HARRIER study 
The study protocol was amended 3 times. The Applicants stated that these amendments were not considered 
to have affected the interpretation of study results as they were minor and occurred prior to study 
unmasking. 
Baseline data 
Disease characteristics were well balanced among groups. The mean BCVA at baseline was 60.6 letters and 
61.2 letters respectively in HAWK study and HARRIER study. Mean CSFT was 462.5 µm and 469.5 µm. Lesion 
subtypes were also balanced across study groups as reported above with a predominance of occult lesions in 
all groups. 
Likewise, there were no concerns about demographics. 
It is to note that the area of lesion associated with CNV was higher in the HAWK study, 4.5 mm2, rather than 
in the HARRIER study, 2.8 mm2. However, the size was well balanced across the arms within each study. 
The time since diagnosis of nAMD was well balanced among groups, large majority of the patients having a 
diagnosis inferior to 3 months. This is reassuring since duration of exudative disease is one of the main factors 
associated with choroidal neovascularization lesion size enlargement. 
Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV) is a subtype of nAMD known to be more prevalent in the East Asian 
population than in the European population.  These patients had been enrolled only in the HAWK study and in 
a very limited proportion. Therefore, there are no concerns about the impact of this subgroup on the overall 
results.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
Change in BCVA from Baseline to Week 48 
According to the primary analysis, in FAS as well as in PPS, the non-inferiority of all brolucizumab groups (3 
mg and 6mg) over the aflibercept group was demonstrated in HAWK and HARRIER studies. Analysis in FAS and 
PPS were consistent. Indeed, all the lower limits of the 95% CI of the difference of the LS mean change in 
mean BCVA from baseline between brolucizumab and aflibercept were superior to -4 letters.

In HAWK study, regarding FAS population, the mean change in BCVA from Baseline at Week 48, with 95% CI, 
for brolucizumab 3 mg, brolucizumab 6 mg and Aflibercept were respectively 6.3 [4.5,7.3], 6.6 [4.9,7.9] and 
7.4  [5.6,8.3]  letters.  In  pairwise  ANOVA,  the  non-inferiority  of  brolucizumab  3  mg  and  brolucizumab 6  mg 
compared to Aflibercept were demonstrated with a LS mean difference of 0.6 (95% C.I.: -2.5,1.3; P=0.0003) 
and -0.2 (95% C.I.: -2.1,1.8; P<0.0001) respectively. 
In HARRIER study, regarding FAS population, the mean change in BCVA from Baseline at Week 48, with 95% 
CI, for brolucizumab 6 mg and aflibercept were respectively 7.0 [5.8,8.1] and 7.8 [6.3,8.9] letters. In pairwise 
ANOVA, the non-inferiority of brolucizumab 6 mg compared to aflibercept were demonstrated with a LS mean 
difference of -0.7 (95% C.I.: -2.4,1.0; P<0.0001). 
Overall, differences between 3 mg and 6 mg doses across primary and secondary endpoints were numerically 
very limited and not clinically significant.

First secondary endpoint 
Average  change  in  BCVA  from  Baseline  over  the  period  Week  36  through  Week  48  (first  key  secondary 
endpoint) 
Primary endpoint was supported by the first key secondary endpoint, average change in BCVA from Baseline 
over  the  period  Week  36  through  Week  48,  for  which  non-inferiority  was  met  for  all  brolucizumab  groups. 
Likewise, effect size was similar to the ones observed in primary endpoint. Indeed, regarding FAS population, 
in HAWK study, the LS mean difference between the brolucizumab and Aflibercept arms was -0.5 letters for

letters for brolucizumab 6 mg (with a lower limit of the 95% CI =  -1.9 letters, p<0.0001 for non-inferiority 
testing) and. In Study RTH258-C002, the LS mean difference between the brolucizumab 6 mg and Aflibercept 
2 mg arm was -1.2 letters (with a lower limit of the 95% CI = -2.8 letters, p=0.0003 for non-inferiority testing). 
Second and third secondary endpoint 
Proportion of q12w treatment status at Week 48  for subjects randomized to brolucizumab (“maintaining on 
q12w”) 
Second  key  secondary  endpoint  estimated  that  the  probability  for  a  subject  to  be  maintained  on  the  q12w 
regimen  up  to  the  disease  activity  assessment  at  Week  44,  with  95%  CI,  was  49.4%  (43.9,  54.6)  in  the 
brolucizumab 3 mg arm versus 55.6% (50.1, 60.7) and 51.0% (45.6, 56.1) in the brolucizumab 6 mg arm in 
respectively HAWK study and HARRIER study. So, almost half of the patients only could remain on the q12w 
regimen through the first year with limited numerically differences between 3 mg group and 6 mg group.

Predictive value of the initial q12w cycle: q12 status at Week 48 (44) for brolucizumab subjects with no q8w 
need during the initial q12w cycle (“remaining on q12w”) 
The third key secondary endpoint allowed specification of patients susceptible to remain on q12w are mainly 
identified after the first cycle following launching phase. Inversely, patient with a need for a q8w regimen were 
mainly identified at Week 16 or Week 20. 
Among subjects with no q8w need during the initial q12w cycle, the estimate for the probability of remaining 
on q12w regimen up to DAA at Week 44 was 80.8% for the 3 mg dose and, 85.3% and 81.7% for the 6 mg 
dose in respectively HAWK study and HARRIER study. The Applicant stated that the absence of disease activity 
during the initial q12w cycle was a strong predictor for remaining on q12w dosing interval up to Week 44.

Ancillary analyses 
BCVA-related secondary endpoints 
An  overview  of  the  selected  BCVA-related  endpoints  at,  and  up  to,  Week  48  is  presented  below.  Results  in 
these other secondary endpoints about BCVA, as responder analysis (i.e.: proportion of patients having a gain 
of at least 15 letters from Baseline or a BCVA >= 84 letters at Week 48), are consistent with primary outcomes.

Maintenance of the benefit 
Maintenance  of  the  benefit  of  brolucizumab  3  mg  and  6  mg  treatments  over  the  time  had  been  addressed 
through  functional  endpoint  (BCVA)  as  well  as  anatomical  endpoints  (changes  in  CSFT,  CNV  lesion,  retinal 
fluids) providing positive outcomes at Week 96. Indeed, in HAWK study, regarding FAS population, the mean 
change  in  BCVA  from  Baseline  at  Week  96,  with  95%  CI,  for  brolucizumab  3  mg,  brolucizumab  6  mg  and

aflibercept were respectively 5.4 [3.7,7.0], 5.6 [4.0,7.3] and 5.6 [4.0,7.1] letters. In HARRIER study, regarding 
FAS population, the mean change in BCVA from Baseline at Week 96, with 95% CI, for brolucizumab 6 mg and 
aflibercept were respectively 6.1 [4.7,7.6] and 6.6 [5.1,8.1] letters.

Anatomical parameters 
Outcomes in anatomical parameters, for instance mean change in CSFTtot from Baseline, mean change in CNV 
lesion size from Baseline and proportion of subjects with presence of sub-RPE fluid at Week 48, also supported 
non-inferiority of both brolucizumab 3 mg and 6 mg compared to aflibercept. The reduction in CSFT observed 
at the end of the first year of treatment was overall maintained through Week 96.

mean change in CNV lesion size from Baseline to Week 48 was -2.3 mm2 in the brolucizumab 6 mg arm and -
2.5 mm2 in the aflibercept 2 mg arm.

Quality of Life 
In HAWK study, the mean change from Baseline (improvement) in the VFQ-25 composite score at respectively 
Week 24 and Week 72 was 3.9 then 5.0 (n=354) in the brolucizumab 6 mg arm, and 3.5 then 3.2 (n=355) in 
the aflibercept 2 mg arm. 
In  HARRIER  study,  the  mean  change  from  Baseline  (improvement)  in  the  VFQ-25  composite  score  at

Subset analysis 
Overall,  subset  analysis  showed  some  heterogeneity  of  the  treatment  effect  across  some  subgroups.  For 
instance,  seeing  mean  change  in  BCVA  from  Baseline  at  Week  48,  a  greater  difference  in  disfavour  of 
brolucizumab is observed for patient with a BCVA at Baseline <= 55 letters in both studies. This alters a bit 
the demonstration of the non-inferiority but does not compromise the studies’ conclusions on efficacy. 
Subset analysis of the primary endpoint is presented in the following figure.

Treatment burden 
Assessment of disease activity in HAWK at Week 16 indicated that 28.1% and 24.0% for the brolucizumab 3 
mg  and  6  mg  subjects,  respectively,  compared  34.5%  for  the  aflibercept  2  mg.  In  HARRIER  study,  the 
proportion was 22.7% for brolucizumab 6 mg compared to 32.2% for aflibercept. Thus, the posology claimed 
should reflect that a substantial part of patients was not at any time of the study on the q12w regimen.

Table 17: Disease activity assessment: proportion of subjects with q8 treatment need as assessed 
by the Investigator at Week 16 (FAS – “efficacy/safety” approach) 
The total number of injections is similar between the 3 mg group and the 6 mg group. This number was slightly 
higher for aflibercept (6.5 for aflibercept versus 6.1 both brolucizumab group in HAWK study, and 6.8 versus 
6.2  in  HARRIER  study).  However,  patients  of  aflibercept  groups  were  not  permitted  to  extend  the  interval 
between injections until 3 months. Additionally, the estimated probability to remain on q12w regimen at Week 
92 slightly decrease compared to Week 44, with 39.7% (34.2,45.1) for brolucizumab 3 mg and, 45.4% (39.8, 
50.7) (HAWK study) and 38.6.0% (33.4, 43.7) (HARRIER study) for brolucizumab 6 mg arm. 
Neutralizing antibodies 
Regarding ADA, mean change in BCVA from baseline up to Week 96 did not show a reduction of the efficacy in 
patient having neutralizing antibodies.

Notes 
Robustness of the results from the primary analysis was assessed based on the per protocol set 
(PPS; subset of the FAS that excluded subjects with protocol deviations and violations of analysis 
requirements that were expected to majorly affect the validity of the assessment of efficacy at 
Week 48). 
The  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  based on  the  PPS  (BRO6mg:  N=351,  AFL2mg:  N=341) was 
consistent with the corresponding primary efficacy analysis using FAS. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No  special  population  were  formally  studied.  Nevertheless,  in  the  two  pivotal  studies  (HAWK  and  HARRIER 
studies) patients aged over 85 had been enrolled. Subset analysis showed similar outcomes in BCVA across 
ages  groups  (old  than  75  years).  Additionally,  based  on  the  non-clinical  outcomes,  the  absence  of  specific 
studies is acceptable. 
Supportive studies 
CRTH258A2301E1 
The CRTH258A2301E1 study consists of a double-masked, multicentre, two-arm 24-week extension study of 
the  HAWK  study.  The  objective  was  to  collect  safety  and  efficacy  data  on  brolucizumab 6  mg  drug  product 
intended for commercialization. 
A subgroup of 150 subjects have enrolled in the US, who completed Week 96. Subjects who were treated with 
brolucizumab  3  mg  (n=62)  or  6  mg  (n=45)  in  the  core  study  received  brolucizumab  6  mg 
(2xq8w+1xq12w/q8w)  in  the  extension  study  and  subjects  with  aflibercept  2  mg  (n=43)  remained  on 
aflibercept. For the brolucizumab core 6 mg, while a trend towards slight decrease in BCVA was observed in 
the second year of the core study, the time course during the extension study suggests stabilization.  For the 
brolucizumab core 3 mg, the trend observed during the second year of the core study continued in the extension 
study. Overall, the reduction in CSFTtot observed at the end of the core study was maintained throughout this 
extension study. 
Results  in  the  maintenance  of  the  benefit  in  the  second  year  were  consistent  with  outcomes  of  the  pivotal 
studies. Together with the conclusion of the Quality, these results provide sufficient evidence about efficacy of 
the formulation intended for commercialization.

to demonstrate a treatment effect of brolucizumab 120 mg/mL applied as a single microvolume injection or 
single  infusion  on  retinal  function  and  morphology  in  subjects  with  nAMD.  The  stage  2  investigated 
brolucizumab 60 mg/ml as a single microvolume injection or single infusion. 
Overall, 52 subjects, randomized in 4 cohorts (120 mg/mL injection, 120 mg/mL infusion, 60 mg/mL injection, 
60 mg/mL infusion), received study treatment. 
The  primary  efficacy  hypothesis  was  that  the  responder  rate  for  subjects  treated  with  brolucizumab  was  > 
15%.  A  patient  was  responder  if  at  least  3  out  of  the  following  4  criteria  were  fulfilled  in  comparison  with 
baseline: ≥ 4-letter gain in BCVA at Day 14; ≥ 4-letter gain in BCVA at Day 28; ≥ 80-μ m decrease in CSFT at 
Day 14; ≥ 80-μ m decrease in CSFT at Day 28. The primary endpoint was met (the proportion of responders 
range from 60 to 80 % across the 4 cohorts. 
C-13-001 provided additional supportive data in favour of the efficacy of brolucizumab. 
RTH258-E003 
RTH258-E003  was  a  randomized,  double  masked,  multicentre,  PK  (systemic  pharmacokinetics)  and  safety 
study evaluating 2 doses (3 mg and 6 mg) of brolucizumab administrated by intravitreal injection in subjects 
(Japanese and non-Japanese ancestry) with nAMD. The regimen was 3 IVT injections administered 4-weeks 
apart. 
The Applicant concluded that serum PK data from this study supported a low systemic exposure following IVT 
injection of brolucizumab and were comparable between subjects of Japanese ancestry and subjects of non-
Japanese  ancestry.  No  systemic  accumulation  of  free  brolucizumab  was  observed.  It  stated  also  the 
brolucizumab 3mg and brolucizumab 6mg were generally safe and well tolerated in this study. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development of brolucizumab is based on two randomized, double-masked, multicentre, active-
controlled, pivotal studies (HAWK study and HARRIER study). Overall, the design of both these Phase III 
studies was adequate.  
The selection criteria were globally consistent with the target population, and morphological criteria related to 
nAMD were reasonable. The upper baseline BCVA limit for inclusion was 78 letters. There is a possibility that 
the inclusion of patients with mild impairment leaves less room for improvement which may not allow 
detection of a difference between aflibercept and brolucizumab in this subpopulation if exists and 
consequently to drive non-inferiority. Additionally, only naïve patients had been included in pivotal studies. It 
is knowledge that patients already treated may not have a room for further improvement. Excluding this 
population is thus in disfavour of the non-inferiority hypothesis and appears to be a more conservative 
approach. However, switching from an anti-VEGF to another one is a common practice for patients with loss 
of benefit over the time, and it is unknown if the reported response will be reached in patients with more 
advanced/pre-treated condition. Finally, HAWK study did not include any patient from the European Union. 
However, European subjects were well enrolled in the HARRIER study. Considering the substantial sample 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 86/117 
 
  
  
 
size of the HARRIER study, together with the fact that the main proportion of the HAWK patients were from 
US with a high proportion of Caucasian subjects, this is acceptable. 
The blinding using monthly sham injection for the visit without treatment administration was acceptable. 
Two doses were tested in the HAWK study, 3 mg and 6 mg, whereas only the 6 mg dose was investigated in 
HARRIER study. The 6 mg dose (the higher dose tested in Phase I) was selected expecting a longer effect, 
despite that no formal dose selection study was performed. The 3 mg dose was added following 
recommendations of the CHMP in the Scientific Advice EMA/CHMPA/SAWP/550707/2013. Indeed, the 
assumption that a higher dose lead to a longer effect or a larger effect size should have been demonstrated.  
Contrary to the initial development plan presented during the Scientific Advice discussion at the EMA 
(EMA/CHMPA/SAWP/550707/2013), instead of ranibizumab 0.5 mg IVT (Lucentis®), aflibercept (Eylea®) 
was chosen as comparator for the both pivotal studies, however, it was justified by the fact that ranibizumab 
had a different posology in the US than in other countries including Europe. 
As the efficacy of aflibercept had been demonstrated in a non-inferiority setting versus ranibizumab, there is 
a potential risk of biocreep. Indeed, in the hypothesis that aflibercept would be slightly inferior to 
ranibizumab, although within the non-inferiority margin, and that brolucizumab would be slightly inferior to 
aflibercept, although within the non-inferiority margin, this could lead to a lower efficacy. However, this is 
mitigated by the fact that to date aflibercept is considered as a standard of care. 
Additionally, pivotal studies haven’t investigated personalized regimen (pro re nata or Treat-and-Extend), as 
recommended in the Scientific Advice, even though such treatment strategies are largely used in common 
practice to manage anti-VEGF IVT medication. Indeed, personalized treatments allow reduction in the number 
of injections, and, consequently, the risk linked to intravitreal injection and the patient burden. However, a 
Phase IIIb study investing treat-&-extend regimen is planned by the Applicant. 
After the launching phase (3 monthly injections), patients were assessed at Week 16 to undergo a q8w 
regimen, in case of disease activity, or a q12w regimen, in absence of disease activity, with the possibility to 
switch on q8w regimen in necessary at the following visits. Disease activity guidance criteria at Week 16 
where more stringent than real life, compared to the following visits in order to select patients to have a 
higher chance to remain on q12w regimen over the time. Therefore, in real life, more patient could be put on 
q12w treatment after lauding phase, but the probability for a patient to remain on q12w regimen could thus 
be lower than in Phase III studies. 
It is also to note that patients from brolucizumab groups were not permitted to switch on q12w once being on 
q8w regimen. Therefore extension/re-extension of the interval between injections was not assessed. The 
regimen in aflibercept groups was fixed in both studies, q8w, despite that personalized treatment from the 
second year was authorized at the time of the studies. Finally, it was not possible to draw conclusion on the 
treatment burden of brolucizumab 3 mg and 6 mg compared to the current standard of care. 
Demonstrating the efficacy of a new anti-VEGF IVT in the treatment of the nAMD using non-inferiority setting 
versus one of the current standard of care (aflibercept) was appropriate. The mean change in BCVA from 
baseline at Week 48 was an acceptable primary endpoint. Nonetheless, Week 48 assessment was favourable 
to patients on q12w regimen. Indeed, BCVA assessment was performed 1 month after the last injection, with 
potentially a higher benefit, contrary to patients on q8w regimen for which assessment was performed 2 
months after the last injection. Therefore, the timepoint was favourable to brolucizumab given that patients 
treated with aflibercept were not permitted to be on q12w regimen. However, the first key secondary 
Assessment report

Page 87/117 
 
  
  
endpoint, being the mean change in BCVA from Baseline averaged over the period Week 36 to Week 48, 
could overcome the problem of a single timepoint in the context of multiple regimens.  
The non-inferiority margin of 4 letters was acceptable. 
Second and third key secondary endpoints were appropriate to assess the relevance of the q12w regimen. 
Additionally, to visual acuity, anatomical parameters (changes in CSFT, CNV lesion, retinal fluids) and Quality 
of Life were explored in other secondary endpoints. Additional secondary timepoint at Week 96 allowed 
investigation of the maintenance of the benefit over the time.  
ETDRS procedure was appropriate to assess BCVA, whereas fluorescein angiography and OCT were suitable 
for anatomical parameters. 
Regarding superiority testing, it is not understandable why visual acuity had not been selected despite it 
represents the primary endpoint’s variable and the first key secondary. Moreover, as additional secondary 
endpoints, no hierarchy testing strategy had been set, and neither has a control been set for the risk alpha. 
Therefore, these superiority testing are considered only as exploratory, and cannot be the basis for claims in 
the product information. 
The primary and first key secondary endpoints were analysed based on the FAS with LOCF imputation of 
missing / censored (after start of alternative anti-VEGF treatment) BCVA values. 
Definition of the FAS and the PPS was appropriate. The analysis based on the PPS was considered supportive. 
In this respect, the analysis based on ITT principles may not always be conservative and, therefore the per-
protocol analysis would have been preferable as the primary analysis. At least, PP results should be 
consistent with the primary analysis. A hierarchical procedure, in a pre-specified order, has been set to 
handle multiple comparison in primary and first key secondary endpoint. Sensitivity analyses using a MMRM 
model and observed data were also conducted.  
It is known that imputation by the LOCF is not a satisfying method to replacing missing data. The use of this 
method in the main analysis can be questionable when the treatment is supposed to slow down a progressive 
disease and, in this case, the inevitable degradation of the visual acuity over time. However, the Applicant 
provided within the answers a sensitivity analysis using multivariate imputation method assuming data 
missing at random. Outcomes of this sensitivity analysis in primary endpoint were positive and consistent 
with the analysis performed using LOCF. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
According  to  the  primary  analysis,  brolucizumab  3  mg  and  brolucizumab  6  mg  were  both  non-inferior  to 
aflibercept 2 mg. Results in FAS and in PPS were consistent in both studies. These outcomes were supported 
by the first key secondary endpoint, average change in BCVA from Baseline over the period Week 36 through 
Week 48, for which non-inferiority was also met. 
Likewise,  outcomes  in  anatomical  parameters,  for  instance  mean  change  in  CSFTtot  from  Baseline,  mean 
change in CNV lesion size from Baseline and proportion of subjects with presence of sub-RPE fluid at Week 48, 
were also in favor of the non-inferiority of brolucizumab 3 m and 6 mg compared to aflibercept. 
Positives outcomes at Week 96 in both functional endpoints (BCVA) and anatomical endpoints provide evidences 
having regards of the maintenance of the benefit over the time. 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 88/117 
 
  
  
Some heterogeneities were observed in some subgroups in subset analysis, but not to an extent to impact the 
overall conclusion on efficacy. 
Regarding the q12w regimen, it was estimated that patients who did not meet disease activity criteria at Week 
16 or 20 had a high probability to remain on this regimen. However, more than 20 % of the patients were 
never eligible to the q12w regimen, and globally half of the subjects only could remain on the q12w regimen 
for  the  entire  first  year.  This  raise  concerns  on  the  generalibility  of  the  q12w  regiment,  and  thus 
recommendation for posology in the Product Information. At this end, the PI has been updated to reflect the 
fact that patients with disease activity at Week 16 should be treated directly with a q8w regimen. 
Overall, differences between 3 mg and 6 mg doses across primary and secondary endpoints were numerically 
very limited and not clinically significant.  However, considering that nAMD is a chronic disease together with 
the fact that intravitreal injection constitutes a substantial burden, the difference, although limited, between 
the 2 doses in proportion of patients remaining in q12w regimen may be ultimately considered as an advantage 
in favour of the 6 mg dose. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the clinical development was acceptable and the design of the both pivotal Phase III studies was 
appropriate. Outcomes bring evidences of the demonstration of the non-inferiority of brolucizumab 3 mg and 
6 mg compared to aflibercept at Week 48 and was maintained up to 2 years  
Differences  between  3  mg  and  6  mg  doses  across  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  were  numerically  very 
limited  and  not  clinically  significant.  However,  the  slightly  higher  proportion  of  patients  remaining  in  q12w 
regimen may be ultimately considered as an advantage in favour of the higher dose.  Additionally, there is a 
lack of data regarding personalised regimen (i.e.: PRN, Treat-&-Extend), despite the fact that these treatment 
strategies  primordial  in  clinical  practice,  especially  to  reduce  the  treatment  burden.  Moreover,  there  was 
concerns on the generability of the q12w regimen  and recommendation for posology to be done in Product 
Information. 
The fact that the small molecule size of brolucizumab could facilitate the penetration in tissues resulting in an 
improved response and longer duration of the effect was suggested but the results provided do not sustained 
it. While slightly better results in anatomical outcomes were reported with brolucizumab compared to 
aflibercept, visual acuity gain favoured aflibercept over brolucizumab. 
Based on the totality of presented evidence, the CHMP considered that efficacy of brolucizumab was 
demonstrated for treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in adults. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Safety  has  been  assessed  of  2  pivotal  Phase  III  studies  of  96  weeks  duration  (HAWK:  RTH258-  C001  and 
HARRIER: RTH258-C002), while supportive safety data are provided from 3 Phase II studies (C-12-006, C-13-
001, and RTH258-E003) and 1 Phase I study (C-10-083). 
The study design of the two pivotal studies was largely similar: a 3-month loading phase (q4w), followed by a 
q12w/q8w regimen.  
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 89/117 
 
  
  
Two different pooled safety databases (S-db) were used to analyse the safety data.  In each database, data 
from brolucizumab 6mg arm are compared to data from aflibercept 2mg group. In 2 studies (one phase II and 
one phase III: HAWK), a brolucizumab 3mg arm has been studied. 
- Monthly loading S-db: 
This pool was used to assess the safety of brolucizumab in the loading phase, i.e. during a period of monthly 
intravitreal injections (3 doses administered at Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8). It consisted of all nAMD studies 
with a duration of at least 12 weeks and a treatment group with brolucizumab 6 mg/50 μL, 3xq4w injections 
during the first 12 weeks, corresponding to 3, monthly loading doses. 
This  S-db  consisted  of  4  studies  (RTH258-E003,  C-12-006,  RTH258-C001  and  RTH258-C002)  and  collected 
data from 1956 patients (383 in brolucizumab 3mg; 799 in brolucizumab 6mg; 774 in aflibercept 2mg).  
-Target posology long-term S-db: 
This pool was used to assess the long-term safety of brolucizumab and consisted of all nAMD studies with a 
study duration of at least 96 weeks and a treatment group with brolucizumab 6 mg/50 μL, 3xq4w intravitreal 
injections  (monthly  loading)  during  the  first  12  weeks  followed  by  q12w/q8w.  This  S-db  consisted  of  the  2 
pivotal  Phase  III  studies  (RTH258-C001  and  RTH258-C002)  and  collected  data  from  1817  patients  (358  in 
brolucizumab 3mg; 730 in brolucizumab 6mg; 729 in aflibercept 2mg). 
In  the  monthly  loading  S-db,  the  majority  of  subjects  (>  96%)  across  treatment  groups  received  3  active 
injections from Baseline to Week 12, which were to be administered at Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8.  
In the targeted posology long-term S-db, from Baseline to Week 96, the mean number of administered active 
injections was quite similar between treatment groups: 10.5 injections in both brolucizumab groups vs  11.7 
injections in the aflibercept 2 mg group. However, the highest frequency in subjects receiving brolucizumab 
was 10 injections (36.7% in the pooled brolucizumab 6 mg group) and the highest frequency was 13 injections 
in aflibercept group (73.1%). 
Patient’s  demographics  appear  to  reflect  the  general  European  nAMD  population  and  are  consistent  across 
treatment groups.  There were slightly more female than male, mean age was 76 years old and more white 
patients were represented. 
A  quarter  of  patients  had  bilateral  disease  which  seems  representative  according  to  published  data  (A. 
Rasmussen  et  al,  2017)  with  an  estimated  rate  between  20%  to  42%.  In  addition,  according  to  another 
published  article,  between  19%  to  68% of  patients with  unilateral  disease  will  progress  to  bilateral  disease 
within five years (Joachim N et al, 2017). 
Extension study data 
The Applicant conducted a 24-week, double-masked, multicentre, two-arm extension study to collect safety 
and  efficacy  data  on  brolucizumab  6  mg  drug  product  intended  for  commercialization  in  patients  with 
neovascular age-related macular degeneration who have completed the RTH258-C001 study. 
Overall, 150 subjects were enrolled into this extension study. Out of 150 subjects enrolled, 107 were treated 
with  brolucizumab  6  mg  (62  subjects  from  the  brolucizumab  core  3  mg  group  and  45  subjects  from  the 
brolucizumab core 6 mg group) and 43 were treated with aflibercept 2 mg. 
In this extension study, no relevant difference was observed compared to the last 6 months of the core study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 90/117 
 
  
  
Overall,  the  safety  profile  was  in  line  with  the  one  identified  in  phase  III  clinical  trial.  No  new  information 
emerged except that cases of intraocular inflammation could also occur 2 years after treatment initiation. 
Safety beyond 2 years is a safety concern that has been included in the RMP by the Applicant and will be further 
monitored in post-marketing. 
Adverse events 
•  Overview of AE 
Monthly loading S-db 
The overall incidence of AE  was similar in  the  brolucizumab 6 mg  and  aflibercept 2 mg groups (48.8% and 
47.3%); the AE incidence in the brolucizumab 3 mg group was 54.3%.  
SAE in the study eye leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug or to permanent discontinuation of 
the study occurred in ≤ 1% of subjects in all treatment groups. 
Target posology long-term S-db 
The incidence of deaths, SAE, and AE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug or of the study was 
similar across treatment groups. 
•  Most reported AE 
OCULAR AE 
Monthly loading S-db 
The most frequently reported SOC was Eye disorders which is numerically slightly higher in brolucizumab groups 
(27.9% in the brolucizumab 3 mg group, 23.4% in the brolucizumab 6 mg group, and 20.0% in the aflibercept 
2 mg group). 
Conjunctival  hemorrhage  was  the  most  commonly  reported  AE  which  occurred  in  5.7%  of  subjects  in  the 
brolucizumab  3  mg  group,  4.0%  of  subjects  in  the  brolucizumab  6  mg  group,  and  3.1%  of  subjects  in  the 
aflibercept 2 mg group. This AE is a known AE of anti-VEGF drugs by IVT route. 
In the monthly loading S-db, 15.9% of  subjects in the brolucizumab  3  mg group, 11.6% of subjects  in the 
brolucizumab 6 mg group, and 8.5% of subjects in the aflibercept 2 mg group had at least 1 AE suspected by 
the Investigator to be related to study drug and/or study drug administration procedure, whereby the majority 
of those AE were assessed as being suspected to be related to the study drug administration procedure (in 
13.6%, 9.1%, and 6.7% of subjects in the brolucizumab 3 mg, brolucizumab 6 mg and aflibercept 2 mg groups, 
respectively). 
The  most  frequently  reported  ocular  AE  suspected  by  the  Investigator  to  be  related  to  the  study  drug 
administration  procedure  was  conjunctival haemorrhage,  which  was  reported  for  5.2%  (brolucizumab 3  mg 
group), 3.1% (brolucizumab 6 mg group) and 2.1% (aflibercept 2 mg group) of the subjects. 
Target posology long-term S-db 
The most frequently reported SOC across all treatment groups was Eye disorders, which is numerically slightly 
higher in brolucizumab groups (57.0% in brolucizumab 3mg group, 50.5% in the pooled brolucizumab 6 mg 
group, and 48.0% in the pooled aflibercept 2 mg group). This AE is a known AE of  anti-VEGF drugs by IVT 
route.

The most frequently reported ocular AE in the study eye by preferred term in the pooled brolucizumab 6 mg 
group was visual acuity reduced. Incidence of this AE was similar in both pooled treatment groups. Conjunctival 
hemorrhage was the second most frequently reported ocular AE in the pooled brolucizumab 6 mg group and 
had a similar incidence rate in both pooled treatment groups.  
Ocular AE incidence in brolucizumab 3mg group is numerically slightly higher than in brolucizumab 6mg in both 
safety databases  which  could be explained by a higher rate  of ocular comorbidities at baseline in  phase III 
study HAWK compared to HARRIER since main data from brolucizumab 3mg arm were collected from HAWK 
study. 
The proportion of subjects with ocular AE in the study eye suspected by the Investigator to be related to study 
drug and/or study drug administration procedure was similar in both pooled treatment groups of the target 
posology long-term S-db (23.2% for pooled brolucizumab 6 mg, 22.1% for pooled aflibercept 2 mg) and in the 
brolucizumab 3 mg group (27.1%). The majority of AE in the study eye were suspected by the Investigator to 
be related to the study drug administration procedure (18.9% for pooled brolucizumab 6 mg and 18.7% for 
pooled  aflibercept  2  mg; 22.6%  for  brolucizumab  3  mg)  rather than  suspected  to  be  related to  study drug 
(7.4% for pooled brolucizumab 6 mg, 4.8% for pooled aflibercept 2 mg; 6.4% for brolucizumab 3 mg). 
Overall, the most frequently reported ocular AE of the study eye suspected by the Investigator to be related to 
study drug was retinal pigment epithelial tear, which was reported for a similar proportion of subjects across 
treatment  groups  (0.8%  in  the  brolucizumab  3  mg  group  of  Study  RTH258-C001,  1.1%  in  the  pooled 
brolucizumab 6 mg group, 1.0% in the pooled aflibercept 2 mg group). 
NON-OCULAR AE 
Monthly loading S-db 
The proportion of subjects across treatment groups experiencing at least 1 non-ocular AE was 35.0% in the 
brolucizumab 3 mg group, 28.7% in the brolucizumab 6 mg group, and 30.9% in the aflibercept 2 mg group. 
The incidence of non-ocular AE by preferred term was similar across treatment groups. 
The most frequently reported SOC was Infections and infestations (11.7% in the brolucizumab 3 mg group, 
9.0% in the brolucizumab 6 mg group, and 11.0% in the aflibercept 2 mg group).  
Nasopharyngitis was the most frequently reported AE with similar rates between treatments groups. This AE is 
considered as a common AE in elderly population and unrelated to brolucizumab. 
In  the  monthly  loading  S-db,  1  subject  (0.3%)  in  the  brolucizumab  3  mg  group,  4  subjects  (0.5%)  in  the 
brolucizumab 6 mg group, and 0 subject in the aflibercept 2 mg group had non-ocular AE that were suspected 
by the Investigator to be related to study drug and/or to the study drug administration procedure and included 
myocardial ischemia, headache, rash, hypertension. 
Target posology long-term S-db 
A  similar  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  pooled  brolucizumab  6  mg  and  the  pooled  aflibercept  2  mg  groups 
experienced at least 1 non-ocular AE (77.4% and 78.1%, respectively).  
All  non-ocular  AE  by  primary  SOC  were  reported  by  a  similar  or  lower  proportion  of  subjects  in the  pooled 
brolucizumab 6 mg group compared to the pooled aflibercept 2 mg group.

The most frequently reported non-ocular AE by preferred term in any treatment group  was nasopharyngitis 
which occurred in a similar proportion of subjects across treatment groups. 
The proportion of subjects with non-ocular AE suspected by the Investigator to be related to study drug and/or 
study drug administration procedure was similar in both pooled treatment pooled aflibercept 2 mg and in the 
brolucizumab 3 mg group of Study RTH258-C001 (1.7%).  
In the pooled treatment groups, non-ocular AE suspected by the Investigator to be related to study drug were 
reported for 6 subjects (0.8%) in the pooled brolucizumab 6 mg group and 4 subjects (0.5%) in the pooled 
aflibercept 2 mg group and included the following events for brolucizumab 6mg: gamma-glutamyltransferase 
increased, headache, dizziness, transient ischaemic attack and hypertension. In the brolucizumab 3 mg group, 
non-ocular AE suspected by the Investigator to be related to study drug were reported for 6 subjects (1.7%) 
and included the following events: coronary artery disease, ventricular extrasystoles, colitis ischaemic, blood 
urea increased, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio increased, cerebral infarction and cerebrovascular accident. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
•  SERIOUS OCULAR AE 
Monthly loading S-db 
A total of 14 subjects experienced at least 1 SAE in the study eye, with a similar proportion across treatment 
groups  (all  ≤  1%).  The  most  frequently  reported  SOC  across  treatment  groups  was  Eye  disorders,  which 
occurred in 0 subject in the brolucizumab 3 mg group, 6 subjects (0.8%) in the brolucizumab 6 mg group, and 
3 subjects (0.4%) in the aflibercept 2 mg group. 
Overall, the most frequently reported SAE in the study eye by preferred term was endophthalmitis (reported 
for 3 subjects (0.8%) in the brolucizumab 3 mg group), followed by retinal artery thrombosis (reported for 2 
subjects (0.3%) in the brolucizumab 6 mg group). 
Target posology long-term S-db 
A numerically slightly higher proportion of subjects in the pooled brolucizumab 6 mg group than in the pooled 
aflibercept 2 mg group and the brolucizumab 3 mg group experienced at least 1 SAE in the study eye (3.4% 
vs 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively).  
The  most  frequently  reported  SOC  across  treatment  groups  was  Eye  disorders  (1.1%  of  subjects  in  the 
brolucizumab 3 mg group, 2.7% of subjects in the pooled brolucizumab 6 mg group, and 1.4% of subjects in 
the pooled aflibercept 2 mg group). 
The most frequently reported SAE in the study eye was endophthalmitis (8 subjects overall) with a frequency 
of <1% in each treatment group; followed by uveitis (6 subjects overall), retinal artery occlusion/thrombosis

The most frequently reported non-ocular SAE by preferred term was pneumonia, which was experienced by 5 
subjects overall (2 subjects (0.5%) in the brolucizumab 3 mg group, 1 subject (0.1%) in the brolucizumab 6 
mg group, and 2 subjects (0.3%) in the aflibercept 2 mg group). In the brolucizumab 3 mg and aflibercept 2 
mg groups, no other serious non-ocular AE occurred in > 1 subject; in the brolucizumab 6 mg group, cardiac 
failure congestive, arrhythmia, and syncope were reported for 2 subjects each. 
Target posology long-term S-db 
A similar proportion of subjects across treatment groups experienced at least 1 non-ocular SAE (24.3% in the 
brolucizumab 3 mg group, 21.0% in the pooled brolucizumab 6 mg group, and 26.6% in the pooled aflibercept 
2 mg group).  
The most frequently reported non-ocular SAE by primary SOC was Cardiac disorders (5.6% of subjects in the 
brolucizumab 3 mg group, 4.0% of subjects in the pooled brolucizumab 6 mg group, and 4.0% of subjects in 
the  pooled  aflibercept  2  mg  group,  respectively)  followed  by  Infections  and  infestations  (4.7%,  4.5%,  and 
5.2%, respectively). 
The most frequently reported non-ocular SAE  by  preferred term  was pneumonia (36  subjects overall), with 
similar incidences in the pooled treatment groups (1.6% in the pooled brolucizumab 6 mg group, and 2.3% in 
the pooled aflibercept 2 mg group). 
Other  preferred  terms  reported  for  ≥  5  subjects  in  the  pooled  brolucizumab  6  mg  group  included  chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (1.1% in brolucizumab 6 mg group, and 0.7% in aflibercept 2 mg group), cardiac 
failure congestive (0.8% in brolucizumab 6 mg group, and 0.7% in aflibercept 2 mg group), syncope (0.7% in 
brolucizumab 6 mg group, and 0.7% in aflibercept 2 mg group), sepsis ((0.7% in brolucizumab 6 mg group, 
and 0.3% in aflibercept 2 mg group), and atrial fibrillation (0.7% in brolucizumab 6 mg group, and 0.3%)in 
aflibercept 2 mg group). 
•  DEATH 
Monthly loading S-db 
No subject in the brolucizumab 3 mg group, 3 subjects (0.4%) in the brolucizumab 6 mg group, and 2 subjects 
(0.3%) in the aflibercept 2 mg group died up to Week 12.  
The only preferred term reported for > 1 subject overall was myocardial infarction, which was reported for 2 
subjects overall (1 subject each in the brolucizumab 6 mg group and in the aflibercept 2 mg group). 
Death was suspected to be related to study drug by the Investigator for 1 subject in the brolucizumab 6 mg 
group in Study C-12-006, who died of myocardial ischemia 18 days following the third dose of study drug. The 
death was considered by the Investigator to be study drug related, as causality could not be ruled out. 
Target posology long-term S-db 
12 subjects (1.6%) in the pooled brolucizumab 6 mg group, 19 subjects (2.6%) in the pooled aflibercept 2 mg 
group, and 9 subjects (2.5%) in the brolucizumab 3 mg group died up to Week 96.

The most frequently reported SOC was Cardiac disorders, particularly the preferred term cardiac arrest, which 
was reported for 1 subject in the brolucizumab 3 mg group, 1 subject in the pooled brolucizumab 6 mg group, 
and 3 subjects in the pooled aflibercept 2 mg group. 
One death was suspected by the Investigator to be related to study drug (event of cerebrovascular accident in 
the brolucizumab 3 mg group). 
Overall, in brolucizumab arms, 4 cases of fatal arterial-thromboembolic events (3 cerebrovascular accident and 
1 myocardial infarction) were reported with a compatible chronology (time to onset from last dose <30 days). 
Indeed, considering systemic half-life of brolucizumab of 4.4 days and pharmacological plausibility of anti-VEGF 
in ATE occurrence, a contributory role of brolucizumab in ATE cannot be excluded despite cardiovascular risk 
factors  reported  in  these  patients.  However,  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamics  data  reported  rapid 
clearance of brolucizumab, absence of accumulation and free VEGF of short duration. This is not expected to 
result in any clinical consequence. 
•  AE OF POTENTIAL RELEVANCE TO INTRAVITREAL ANTI-VEGF 
For each of these topics, only the data for the target posology long-term S-db are being presented since no 
specific safety signal was identified from the data of the monthly loading S-db. 
OCULAR AE 
In the target posology long-term S-db, there was no relevant difference in the overall incidence of ocular AE of 
potential relevance to intravitreal anti-VEGF for the study eye between the pooled brolucizumab 6 mg and the 
pooled aflibercept 2 mg groups (14.4% and 11.8%) and the brolucizumab 3 mg group (16.5%) at Week 96. 
Endophtalmitis 
The number of subjects with at least one event categorized under endophthalmitis in the target posology long-
term S-db was low. Among the 10 subjects with at least one event categorized under endophthalmitis in the 
study eye up to Week 96, 5 subjects (0.7%; 95%CI 0.00-1.67) were in the pooled brolucizumab 6 mg group 
and  1  subject  (0.1%;  95%  CI  0.00-0.54)  in  the  pooled  aflibercept  2  mg  group  (risk  difference  for  pooled 
brolucizumab  6  mg  –  aflibercept  2  mg:  0.5%  (95%  CI  -0.27,  1.67)  and  4  subjects  (1.1%)  were  in  the 
brolucizumab 3 mg group. The marketing of the pre-filled syringe alone will allow to reduce this risk. 
Intraocular inflammation 
AE categorized under intraocular inflammation were reported with a higher incidence in the brolucizumab 
treatment groups compared to the aflibercept 2 mg group at Week 96. The percentage of subjects with at 
least one intraocular inflammation event was 4.4% (95% CI 2.30-7.08) for pooled brolucizumab 6 mg vs. 
0.8% (95% CI 0.14-1.63) for pooled aflibercept 2 mg, with a risk difference for pooled brolucizumab 6 mg – 
pooled aflibercept 2 mg of 3.6% (95% CI 1.08-6.53).  
The percentage of subjects with at least one intraocular inflammation event was 4.5% in the brolucizumab 3 
mg group which is similar to brolucizumab 6mg group. In order to limit the bias observed at baseline 
regarding ocular morbidities and discussed above (more ocular morbidities observed at baseline in HAWK 
compared to HARRIER study), intraocular inflammation rate for brolucizumab 3mg and 6mg has been 
compared in individual safety report of HAWK study. Similar rates were reported between brolucizumab 6mg 
and 3mg (5.8% vs 4.7%).

Most frequently PT terms retrieved were uveitis, iritis and vitritis. Most of these events were mild and 
moderate (~94%) and were observed in the 6 first months of treatment. Majority of cases resolved (81.3% 
in brolucizumab 6mg and 83.3% in brolucizumab 3mg) and some resolved with sequelae (9.4% in 
brolucizumab 6mg and 12.5% in brolucizumab 3mg). 
An extensive review of the intraocular inflammation AE was performed by the Applicant to identify possible 
underlying causes and a higher incidence for intraocular inflammation AE was found in female subjects 
compared to male subjects and for subjects of Japanese ancestry vs subjects of non-Japanese ancestry. 
Considering this higher rate in brolucizumab group compared to aflibercept and that 31.3% of cases led to 
drug withdrawn in brolucizumab 6mg group, a warning in the EU product information has been included by 
the Applicant as an AE related to intravitreal injections. This AE need to be closely monitored in post-
marketing setting. 
ATE and retinal artery occlusion 
Ocular ATE were reported in both treatment groups of brolucizumab 3mg, 6mg and aflibercept 2 mg (1.1% 
and 1.2% vs 0.4% respectively) as well as retinal artery occlusive events (1.1% and 0.8% vs 0.1% 
respectively) with numerically slightly higher rate for brolucizumab groups.  
Despite cardiovascular risk factors reported in all patients, time to onset from last dose (2 cases occurred the 
day of the injection) is in favor of a causal role of anti-VEGF in retinal artery occlusion occurrence in the study 
eye. The Applicant reported cases in clinical trials mostly reported with concomitant intraocular inflammation 
and proposed that the inflammation might have led to a direct compression of the artery or to a periphlebitis 
that subsequently caused the interruption of the blood flow leading to a retinal artery occlusion. Considering 
the common frequency of intraocular inflammation with brolucizumab, its higher rate compared to aflibercept 
and the necessity of prompt medical care for retinal artery occlusion, a warning has been added in section 
4.4 of the SmPC to bring to the attention of the healthcare professionals and of the patients in addition to the 
listedness of this AE in section 4.8.  
Further discussions were introduced concerning retinal artery occlusion in the fellow eye. No relevant 
differences were observed between brolucizumab and aflibercept and considering absence of direct vascular 
link between the two eyes, brolucizumab would need to come via the systemic circulation. At this stage, due 
to uncertainties related to systemic profile in case of bilateral treatment (see discussion below), causal role of 
retinal artery occlusion in fellow eyes is unknown and this topic should be closely monitored in post-
marketing setting through PSUR. 
Other ocular AE related to IVT procedure 
Other AE related to injection procedure were reported with similar rates between brolucizumab 3mg and 6 
mg and aflibercept such as IOP increased (5.0% , 3.8% and 4.5% respectively), retinal pigment epithelial 
tears (1.4%, 0.5% and 1.2% respectively), retinal detachment (0.6%, 1.6% and 1.0% respectively) and 
traumatic cataract (0%, 0.1% and 0% respectively). 
NON-OCULAR AE 
Arterial thromboembolic events (ATE)

The proportion of subjects with ATE up to Week 96 in the target posology long-term S-db was similar between 
the  brolucizumab  3  mg  group  and  the  pooled  brolucizumab  6  mg  group  (5.9%  vs  4.5%).  There  was  no 
meaningful difference in the overall incidence of non-ocular ATE between the pooled brolucizumab 6 mg and 
the pooled aflibercept 2 mg groups of the target posology long-term S-db (3.0% and 4.1%; risk difference for 
pooled brolucizumab 6 mg – aflibercept 2 mg of −1.1% (95% CI −3.19, 0.82). 
Narratives were provided by the Applicant and in 16 cases, despite cardiovascular risk factors reported in all 
cases, a compatible chronology (time to onset from last dose <30 days taking into account systemic half-life 
of brolucizumab of 4.4 days) do not allow to exclude a contributory role of brolucizumab in ATE occurrence.  
VEGF  inhibition  may  predispose  to  thromboembolic  events  by  reduction  of  PGI2  and  nitric  oxide  and  to 
thrombosis by increasing haematocrit and blood viscosity via overproduction of erythropoietin (Kamba et al, 
2007; Spivak et al, 2002). 
Systemic safety profile of anti-VEGF drugs by intravitreal route is of concern in Europe and systemic AE are not 
excluded since one ongoing signal procedure related to aortic dissection and aneurysm with anti-VEGF drugs 
has included drugs administered by IVT route (EPITT N°19330). 
Pharmacokinetic data in patients with nAMD support generally a low systemic exposure after IVT injection of 
brolucizumab.  In fact, the short systemic half-life (around  4,5  days) suggests an almost complete systemic 
clearance of brolucizumab before the next injection (monthly), and even more so if the time interval is increased 
to 2 or 3 months. Importantly, the mean free brolucizumab concentration over time appears to fall below both 
IC50 for VEGFR2 and VEGFR1 by approximately three days post dose. Overall, after intravitreal brolucizumab 
administration, a free VEGF suppression would be partial and of very short duration which is not expected to 
result in any clinical consequence. However, the systemic exposure in case of bilateral treatment could not be 
confidently predicted due to absence of PK data at 12mg and has not been investigated in clinical trials with 
brolucizumab. More data needed in post-marketing setting to confirm absence of clinical consequences in case 
of  bilateral  treatment.  The  Applicant  has  accepted  to  add  a  warning  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  related  to 
bilateral treatment stating that this practice has not been studied in clinical trial. In addition, a warning in the 
product information as well as a mention related to this theoretical risk has been added as requested in sections 
4.4  and  4.8  of  the  SmPC  as  it  is  already  mentioned  for  other  anti-VEGF  drugs  administered  by  IVT  route 
(ranibizumab and aflibercept). 
Other known risks of anti-VEGF by IV route 
Similar rates between brolucizumab 3mg and 6mg groups and aflibercept 2mg group were reported for venous 
thromboembolic  events  (1.1%,  0.7%  and  1.2%  respectively),  hypertension  (11.7%,  9.2%  and  9.9% 
respectively) and non-ocular haemorrhage (9.2%, 7.1% and 7.8%).  
Similarly to ATE, VEGF inhibition may predispose to these events but more data are needed to confirm them 
due to low systemic exposure. 
Due  to  low  number  of  cases  reported,  it  is  difficult  to  compare  ATE,  VTE,  hypertension  and  non-ocular 
haemorrhage rates between brolucizumab 3mg and 6mg groups. 
Laboratory findings 
Overall, no safety concerns were identified based on clinical laboratory assessments such as vital signs, BCVA, 
geographic atrophy, fibrosis and IOP in any study. 
No pooled analyses were performed for clinical laboratory evaluations.

Intrinsic factors 
Monthly loading S-db 
There were no relevant differences in exposure to study drug from Baseline to Week 12 across subgroups by 
age, gender, race, and ethnicity. 
There were no clinically relevant differences in the incidence of ocular AE in the study eye and non-ocular AE 
from Baseline to Week 12 across subgroups by age, race, and ethnicity. 
However, ocular AE occurred in a numerically higher proportion of females (34.7% in the brolucizumab 3 mg 
group, 26.0% in brolucizumab 6 mg group and 23.2%, in aflibercept 2 mg group) than males (23.8% in the 
brolucizumab 3 mg, 24.3% in the brolucizumab 6 mg group and 17.8% in the aflibercept 2 mg group). 
Target posology long-term S-db 
In this S-db, any comparison has to be interpreted with caution since the brolucizumab 3 mg group was only 
included in Study RTH258-C001, while the pooled brolucizumab 6 mg and pooled aflibercept 2 mg results are 
obtained from the pooled pivotal studies (RTH258-C001 and RTH258-C002). 
Generally, the mean exposure to study drug from Baseline to Week 96 was slightly lower for both the pooled 
brolucizumab  6  mg  and  the  brolucizumab  3  mg  group  than  for  the  pooled  aflibercept  2  mg  group  in  all 
subgroups by age, gender, race, and ethnicity, where the number of subjects in the subgroup was large enough 
to allow for a meaningful comparison. 
There were no clinically relevant differences from Baseline to Week 96 in the incidence of ocular AE in the study 
eye for age and ethnicity and of non-ocular AE across subgroups by race, gender and ethnicity. 
However, differences of ocular AE were reported for gender (numerically higher proportion of female vs male 
in brolucizumab 3mg group: 65.2% in females vs 54.1% in males) and ethnicity (numerically higher proportion 
of Asian subjects especially for cataract and dry eye in brolucizumab 6mg vs aflibercept). 
In addition, differences of reported for age groups in the <65 group, 12.9%, 10.1% and 16.9 % of subjects 
experienced SAE, respectively, in the brolucizumab 3 mg group, in the pooled brolucizumab 6 mg group and 
in the pooled aflibercept 2 mg group.  
For the 65-74 group, these proportions increased to 18.4%, 19.8 % and 19.3 %, respectively.  
For the 75-84 group, these proportions further increased to 29.0%, 21.3% and 28.6 %.  
In the >85 group, 27.4%, 29.4% and 42.3% of subjects experienced SAE, respectively in the brolucizumab 3 
mg group, in the pooled brolucizumab 6 mg group and in the pooled aflibercept 2 mg groups. An increase of 
the incidence of non-ocular SAE with age may be explained in the AMD population which gather most elderly 
subjects.

Immunological events 
Pre-existing  anti-brolucizumab  antibodies  were  assessed  including  all  subjects  for  whom  ADA  data  was 
available. Across all studies and dose groups just under half (884/2023, 43.7%) of the subjects regardless of 
which treatment they subsequently received, were positive for pre-existing anti-brolucizumab antibodies. 
Indeed, the detection method of an immune response appears to be non-specific not only to brolucizumab but 
also to other antibody fragments of similar structure such as nanobodies and single domain antibodies. This 
can  be  because  they  share  the  cryptic  epitopes  that  are  revealed  through  the  catabolism/degradation  of 
immunoglobulins. 
Separated data on patients without pre-existing ADA status at baseline (treatment induced ADA status) and 
patients  with  pre-existing  ADA  status  at  baseline  (treatment  boosted  ADA  status)  were  presented  in 
Pharmacology section. Subjects who were negative for pre-existing ADA were two to three times more likely 
to develop brolucizumab antibodies as compared to subjects who were positive for pre-existing ADA. Positive 
pre-existing ADA status did not increase the likelihood of subsequently developing a treatment-emergent ADA 
response. 
The rate of positive ADA in phase III clinical studies in patients without pre-existing ADA status at baseline was 
33.2% (205/617 patients) at Week 88 for brolucizumab with no major difference between the two experimental 
doses. Half of them were transient (15.9% 98/617 patients). 
No impact of antibodies, whether they were neutralizing or not, was observed on the incidence of non-ocular 
AE  including  systemic  hypersensitivity  but  a  correlation  between  ADA  status  and  occurrence  of  intraocular 
inflammation was made since:  
- most subjects with a treatment-emergent ADA status and with an intraocular inflammation AE were associated 
with ADA titers ≥270. 
-  a  higher  incidence  of  intraocular  inflammation  AE  was  observed  in  subjects  with  a  persistent  integrated 
induced or boosted ADA status versus a transient status. 
Thus, it could be assumed that brolucizumab has a potential for immunogenicity and a mention has been added 
in  the  SmPC  in  section  4.4  in  addition  to  the  mention  already  proposed  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  by  the 
Applicant. Impact on safety will be further monitored as part of routine pharmacovigilance setting. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific drug interaction studies were performed with brolucizumab.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical safety analysis is based on data pooled from two Phase III studies (HAWK and HARRIER) and 
two-Phase II studies which have been analysed into two databases: one for the loading phase (3 monthly 
injections) and one for the long-term treatment (96 weeks). In these databases, brolucizumab 6 mg 
treatment is compared to aflibercept 2mg treatment. In 2 studies (one phase II and one phase III HAWK), a 
brolucizumab 3mg arm has been studied. In general, the Applicant’s approach for safety assessment is 
considered acceptable. Of note, given the lack of a placebo arm in the studies conducted, the safety profile of 
brolucizumab cannot be considered fully characterised. 
Patient  exposure:  The  monthly  loading  safety-database  (S-db)  collected  data  from  1956  patients  (383  in 
brolucizumab 3mg; 799 in brolucizumab 6mg; 774 in aflibercept 2mg) and the targeted posology long-term 
safety-database collected data from 1817 patients (358 in brolucizumab 3mg; 730 in brolucizumab 6mg; 729 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020

in  aflibercept  2mg).  Mean  number  of  injections  was  quite  similar  between  all groups  in the  long-term  S-db 
(10.5 vs 10.5 vs 11.7 respectively). 
Patient’s demographics reflect the general European nAMD population and it is consistent across treatment 
groups.  There were slightly more female than male subjects, mean age was 76 years old, and white patients 
were better represented. 
Long-term data: Limited long-term data are available. An extension study of HAWK allows to collect 
additional data over 24-weeks. This extension study enrolled 150 subjects including 107 treated with 
brolucizumab (62 with brolucizumab 3mg and 45 with brolucizumab 6mg). In this study, the intended drug 
product for commercialisation was used.  Analytical studies support the conclusion that the drug products in 
both formulation solutions are comparable. No additional clinical studies are needed. 
In this extension study, no relevant difference was observed compared to the last 6 months of the core 
study. Safety beyond 2 years is a safety concern that has been included in the RMP as missing information. 
Adverse events (AE): Overall, AE incidence was similar between brolucizumab 6mg and aflibercept 2mg 
groups in both safety databases (48.8% vs 47.3% and 89.7% vs 89.6% respectively). 
Ocular AE: Incidence of ocular AE in brolucizumab 6mg group is numerically slightly higher than in 
aflibercept group in both safety databases (25.3% vs 20.8% and 53.4% vs 51.0% respectively). The most 
commonly reported AE were conjunctival haemorrhage in the monthly loading S-db and reduced visual acuity 
in the targeted posology long-term S-db with similar rates between aflibercept and brolucizumab arms. These 
AE are known effects of anti-VEGF drugs by IVT route. 
The AE for which a higher difference was observed between brolucizumab (3mg and 6mg) and aflibercept 
was intraocular inflammation (4.5% and 4.4% vs 0.8% respectively) in the targeted posology long-term S-db 
with a risk difference for pooled brolucizumab 6 mg – pooled aflibercept 2 mg of 3.6% (95% CI 1.08-6.53). 
Most of these events were mild and moderate (~94%) and were observed in the 6 first months of treatment. 
Most frequently preferred terms retrieved were uveitis, iritis and vitritis. Majority of cases resolved (81.3% in 
brolucizumab 6mg and 75% in brolucizumab 3mg) and some resolved with sequelae (9.4% in brolucizumab 
6mg and 12.5% in brolucizumab 3mg). Some cases necessitated a temporary interruption of the treatment 
(12.5% in brolucizumab 6mg and 43.8% in brolucizumab 3mg) or drug withdrawal (31.3% in brolucizumab 
6mg and 12.5% in brolucizumab 3mg). The Applicant identified gender (female subjects reported higher 
incidence than males) and ethnicity (Japanese ancestry subjects reported events more frequently than non-
Japanese ancestry) as possible risk factors. Hypothesis of immunogenicity was put forward by the Applicant 
for intraocular inflammation occurrence since a higher number of cases were observed among patients with 
treatment-emergent AE antibodies (ADA). Hypothesis of difference in formulation between brolucizumab and 
aflibercept has been ruled out due to standard excipients with a well-known safety profile.   Intraocular 
inflammation will be further investigated in post-marketing setting through PSUR.  
Regarding brolucizumab dosing, a numerically slightly higher rate of ocular AE was reported in 3mg group 
compared to 6mg group in both safety databases (30% vs 25.3% and 60.6% vs 53.4% respectively) which 
could be explained by a higher rate of ocular comorbidities at baseline in study HAWK compared to HARRIER 
(main data from brolucizumab 3mg arm were collected from HAWK study). In study HAWK which compared 
the two dosages in patients with similar ocular morbidities, ocular AE were reported with similar rate between 
both groups (48.9% vs 49.7%) as well as for intraocular inflammation for both dosages of brolucizumab 
(5.8% vs 4.7%).

Ocular arterial-thromboembolic events and retinal artery occlusions (RAO) were recorded in brolucizumab 3mg 
and  6mg  arms  with  a  slightly  higher  rate  compared  to  aflibercept  (ATE:  1.1%  and  1.2%  vs  0.4%  with 
aflibercept; retinal artery occlusive events: 1.1% and 0.8% vs 0.1% with aflibercept). These AE are not listed 
in the product information of other anti-VEGF drugs by IVT route. Among retinal artery occlusion cases reported 
in the study eye, most events were reported following intraocular inflammation events such as iritis, vitritis 
and iridocyclitis. The mechanism of action proposed by the Applicant is a direct compression by inflammation 
of the artery that causes interruption to the blood flow. Other hypothesis has been proposed in literature with 
anti-VEGF agents such as vasoconstriction of retinal arterioles and retinal whitening by complete inhibition in 
eyes, post-injection rise of intraocular pressure and patient stress as a result of this procedure (Mansour et al, 
2012; Kida et al, 2016). Considering the common frequency of intraocular inflammation with brolucizumab, its 
higher rate compared to aflibercept, pharmacological mechanisms and the necessity of prompt medical care 
for RAO, this information need to be brought to the attention of the healthcare professionals and to the patients. 
A mention in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC and in section 2 of the PIL has thus been added by the Applicant 
as requested. 
Concerning retinal artery occlusion cases in the fellow eyes, no relevant difference was observed between 
brolucizumab and aflibercept treated patients. Considering absence of direct vascular link between the two 
eyes, brolucizumab would need to come via the systemic circulation to reach the fellow eye. Therefore, at 
this stage, due to uncertainties related to systemic profile in case of bilateral treatment, causal role of RAO in 
fellow eyes is unknown and this topic should be closely monitored in post-marketing setting through PSUR.  
Other AE known to be induced by anti-VEGF agents by IVT route and related to injection procedure were also 
reported with similar rates between both groups such as endophtalmitis, IOP increase, traumatic cataract, 
retinal pigment epithelial tears and retinal tear/detachment. Marketing of the pre-filled syringe alone will 
allow to reduce the risk of endophtalmitis. 
Non-ocular AE: Incidence of non-ocular AE was similar between brolucizumab 6mg and aflibercept groups in 
both safety databases (28.7% vs 30.9% and 77.4% vs 78.1%).  
Nasopharyngitis was the most frequently reported AE but commonly reported in elderly population and thus 
unrelated to brolucizumab and aflibercept. 
Regarding arterial thromboembolic events (ATE), similar rates were reported in the targeted posology 
long-term S-db between brolucizumab 6mg and aflibercept (4.5% vs 4.7%). These events are difficult to 
assess because of the treated population who are elderly patients with many cardiovascular risk factors 
considered as confounding factors. However, in 16 cases from clinical trials, a compatible chronology (time to 
onset from last dose <30 days taking into account systemic half-life of brolucizumab of 4.4 days) do not 
allow to exclude a contributory role of brolucizumab in ATE occurrence due to pharmacological plausibility 
despite cardiovascular risk factors reported. In addition, considering that causal role of these systemic AE has 
not been excluded at this stage with aflibercept, similar rates reported in clinical trials do not allow to exclude 
these risks with brolucizumab. Indeed, ATE risks are still included in the RMP of EYLEA as important potential 
risks and are closely monitored through PSUR. 
Regarding venous thromboembolic events (VTE), hypertension and non-ocular haemorrhage, known risks 
of anti-VEGF agents, similar rates were also reported between both groups. Similarly, to ATE these risks 
cannot be excluded for brolucizumab. 
Pharmacokinetic data in patients with nAMD support generally a low systemic exposure after IVT injection of 
brolucizumab. The short systemic half-life suggests an almost complete systemic clearance of brolucizumab 
before the next injection (monthly). In addition, the mean free brolucizumab concentrations over time 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 102/117 
 
  
  
appears to fall below both IC50 for VEGFR2 and VEGFR1 by approximately three days post dose and thus, a 
free VEGF suppression would be partial and of very short duration after intravitreal brolucizumab 
administration which is not expected to result in any clinical consequence. However, the systemic exposure in 
case of bilateral treatment could not be confidently predicted due to absence of pharmacokinetic data at 
12mg and need to be closely monitored in post-marketing setting. 
Discontinuation due to AE: In the monthly loading S-db, subject’s decision was the first cause of treatment 
discontinuation in brolucizumab 6 mg (1.5%) and aflibercept 2 mg (1.2%) treated patients. In the long-term 
S-db, withdrawal by subject (6.3% and 5.8%, respectively) followed by adverse events (4.4% and 3.0%, 
respectively) were reported in the pivotal phase III studies C001 and C002. 
No concerns are raised by discontinuations occurred in either the initial loading or long-term phases. 
Immunogenicity: The impact of ADA on safety was investigated. A positive pre-existing ADA status did not 
increase the likelihood of subsequently developing a treatment-emergent ADA response.  No increased 
incidence of systemic hypersensitivity was observed in patients with treatment-induced or boosted ADA. 
However, a higher incidence of intraocular inflammation events was reported among the patients with 
induced/boosted ADA with respect to those who were negative or positive or boosted ADA. No clear impact 
on efficacy in terms of visual acuity and maintenance of the trimonthly dosing regimen was also observed.   
Overall, there is a potential for immunogenicity (in presence or absence of pre-existing non-specific 
antibodies) which will be further monitored in post-marketing surveillance and a mention has been added in 
sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of brolucizumab seems similar to aflibercept, except for intraocular inflammations 
and ocular occlusive events which are more frequently reported with brolucizumab.  
As with other anti-VEGF drugs by IVT route, concerns were raised regarding the potential role of brolucizumab 
on  systemic  AE  occurrence  such  as  arterial  thromboembolic  events,  venous  thromboembolic  events, 
hypertension and non-ocular haemorrhage. Despite reassuring pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, 
the claimed systemic profile in case of bilateral treatment with brolucizumab 6mg, a common practice, cannot 
be supported by pharmacokinetic data at 12 mg and should be closely monitored in post-marketing setting.

Pharmacovigilance plan 
The PRAC and CHMP agreed that routine pharmacovigilance activities, including collection and reporting of 
adverse reactions, and signal detection are considered sufficient to monitor the safety of the medicinal 
product in the licensed indication. No additional pharmacovigilance activities are deemed necessary. 
However, the PRAC recommended that the Applicant propose and discuss the conduction of a feasibility study 
of a PASS to address the important identified and potential risks as well as missing information (e.g. ATE, VTE, 
hypertension and non-ocular haemorrhage, bilateral treatment), but following discussion at the CHMP, it has 
been decided that based on  large experience from similar class products, including with bilateral treatment, 
the PASS study was deemed not necessary. Therefore, the need for a feasibility study has been dismissed.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 07.10.2019. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that brolucizumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. The CHMP, based on the available data, considers brolucizumab to be a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Beovu (brolucizumab) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU. 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020

Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a chronic eye disease characterized by progressive degenerative 
abnormalities in the central retina (macula). In the aging eye, Bruch’s membrane composition changes, and 
retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) function diminishes. As a consequence of reduced RPE function, drusen 
deposits at the level of the RPE photoreceptors accumulate. Drusen contain lipofuscin and other toxic waste 
products of metabolism. Two stages are known for this disease:  
• 
• 
early AMD, which is characterized by drusen and pigmentary changes, 
late AMD, which can be distinguished in 2 subtypes — geographic atrophy (GA) and choroidal 
neovascularization (CNV). The neovascular subtype of AMD is known to cause particularly rapid and 
devastating vision loss for these individuals. Vision loss results from the abnormal growth and leakage of 
blood vessels in the macula, leading to legally blindness. 
Neovascular AMD is the leading cause of severe vision loss worldwide, affecting 10% to 13% of individuals 
over the age of 65 in North America, Europe, and Australia. It is suggested that almost 16% of patients with 
nAMD would become legally blind in 2 years without treatment and that the prevalence rates of late AMD are 
in European is around 2.5%. 
The recommended dose is 6 mg (0.05 ml) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (monthly) for 
the first three doses. Thereafter, Beovu is administered every 12 weeks (3 months). The physician may 
individualise treatment intervals based on disease activity as assessed by visual acuity and/or anatomical 
parameters. The treatment interval could be as frequent as every 8 weeks (2 months). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
To date, intravitreal anti-VEGF therapies are the standard of care. Two anti-VEGF therapies authorized in the 
treatment of neovascular AMD are available on the market: ranibizumab (Lucentis®) and aflibercept 
(Eylea®). 
However, intravitreal anti-VEGF treatments can be a significant burden to patients. Thus, there is a need to 
develop therapies with a longer effect. Additionally, in the context where the efficacy of an anti-VEGF can 
reduce over the time and requires a switch to another anti-VEGF together with the fact some patients have a 
poor treatment effect to available therapies lead a need of additional alternatives therapies. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical study program for the sought indication consists of 2 randomized, double-masked, multicentre, 
active-control (versus aflibercept 2 mg) studies (RTH258-C001 [HAWK study] and RTH258-C002 [HARRIER 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020

study]) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of brolucizumab administrated intravitreally. Two doses were 
investigated, 3 mg and 6 mg. The volume of injection used in pivotal studies is 50 μl (0.05 mL) regardless 
the dose. In both studies, following 3 loading doses at 4-week intervals, each subject treated with 
brolucizumab was injected every 12-weeks (q12w) up to Week 92 unless there was disease activity identified 
by the masked Investigator, in which case the subject was assigned to receive injections every 8 weeks 
(q8w) for the remainder of the study. Aflibercept subjects were treated every 8 weeks (q8w) after the 
loading phase (3 monthly injections). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Demonstration on the non-inferiority in efficacy 
In both pivotal Phase III studies, brolucizumab 3 mg and brolucizumab 6 mg demonstrated non-inferiority to 
aflibercept 2 mg in the treatment of the neovascular AMD. The primary endpoint was met in FAS as well in 
PPS analysis with consistent outcomes.  
In HAWK study, regarding FAS population, the mean change in BCVA from Baseline at Week 48, with 95% 
CI, for brolucizumab 3 mg, brolucizumab 6 mg and aflibercept were respectively 6.3 [4.5,7.3], 6.6 [4.9,7.9] 
and 7.4 [5.6,8.3] letters. In pairwise ANOVA, the non-inferiority of brolucizumab 3 mg and brolucizumab 6 
mg compared to Aflibercept were demonstrated with a LS mean difference of -0.6 (95% C.I.: -2.5,1.3 
respectively; P=0.0003) and -0.2 (95% C.I.: -2.1,1.8; P<0.0001). In HARRIER study, regarding FAS 
population, the mean change in BCVA from Baseline at Week 48, with 95% CI, for brolucizumab 6 mg and 
aflibercept were respectively 7.0 [5.8,8.1] and 7.8 [6.3,8.9] letters. In pairwise ANOVA, the non-inferiority of 
Brolucizumab 6 mg compared to Aflibercept were demonstrated with a LS mean difference of -0.7 (95% C.I.: 
-2.4,1.0; P<0.0001). 
Primary outcomes were supported by the first key secondary endpoint, average change in BCVA from 
Baseline over the period Week 36 through Week 48. Regarding FAS population, in HAWK study, the LS mean 
difference between brolucizumab and aflibercept arms was -0.5 letters for the dose of 3 mg (with a lower 
limit of the 95% CI = -2.4, p=0.0001 for non-inferiority testing) and 0.0 letters for the dose of 6 mg (with a 
lower limit of the 95% CI = -1.9 letters, p<0.0001 for non-inferiority testing).  
In HARRIER study, the LS mean difference between the brolucizumab 6 mg and aflibercept 2 mg arm was -
1.2 letters (with a lower limit of the 95% CI = -2.8 letters, p=0.0003 for non-inferiority testing). 
Analysis of the other secondary endpoints related to anatomical parameters and Quality of Life provided 
supportive and consistent outcomes, giving reassurance on the efficacy of brolucizumab (3mg and 6 mg). 
Support of the regimen 
Secondary outcomes showed maintenance of the benefit over the time with positive outcomes at Week 96. 
Indeed, in HAWK study, regarding FAS population, the mean change in BCVA from Baseline at Week 96, with 
95% CI, for brolucizumab 3 mg, brolucizumab 6 mg and Aflibercept were respectively 5.4 [3.7,7.0], 5.6 
[4.0,7.3] and 5.6 [4.0,7.1] letters. In HARRIER study, regarding FAS population, the mean change in BCVA 
from Baseline at Week 96, with 95% CI, for brolucizumab 6 mg and aflibercept were respectively 6.1 
[4.7,7.6] and 6.6 [5.1,8.1] letters. 
Second and third key secondary endpoints were designed to assess the q12w regimen recommended after 
launching phase of 3 monthly injections. Regarding FAS population, in HAWK study, the estimate of the 
probability for a subject to be maintained on the q12w regimen up to the Disease Activity Assessment (DAA), 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 108/117 
 
  
  
with CI 95%, at Week 44 was 49.4% (43.9, 54.6) for brolucizumab 3 mg and 55.6% (50.1, 60.7) for 
brolucizumab 6 mg. In HARRIER study, the probability was 51.0% (45.6, 56.1) for brolucizumab 6 mg.  
Additionally, in subjects with no q8w need during the initial q12w cycle, the estimate for the probability of 
remaining on q12w regimen up to DAA at Week 44 was 80.8% (74.5, 85.7) for brolucizumab 3 mg dose and 
85.3% (79.9,89.5) for brolucizumab 6 mg in HAWK study. In HARRIER study, the probability was 81.7% 
(75.8,86.3) for brolucizumab 6 mg. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Demonstration of the non-inferiority in efficacy 
Aflibercept has been chosen as comparator for the both pivotal Phase III studies. Given that the efficacy of 
aflibercept had been demonstrated in a non-inferiority setting versus ranibizumab together with the fact that 
the efficacy of brolucizumab has been assessed in a non-inferiority setting, there is a potential risk of 
biocreep. Indeed, in the hypothesis that aflibercept would be slightly inferior to ranibizumab, although in the 
non-inferiority margin, and that brolucizumab would be slightly inferior to aflibercept, although in the non-
inferiority margin, this could lead at the end of the day to a lower efficacy. However, this is mitigated by the 
fact that to date aflibercept is considered as a standard of care. 
Whereas the non-inferiority between brolucizumab and aflibercept was proven in both pivotal trials visual 
improvement was numerically larger in aflibercept treated patients.  
The primary timepoint was set at Week 48. BCVA assessment for primary endpoint was thus performed 1 
month after the last injection for patients on the q12w regimen, and 2 months after the last injection for 
patients on the q8w regimen. Given that only patients of brolucizumab groups were permitted to receive 
q12w, patients of Aflibercept groups remaining necessarily on the q8w regimen, together with the fact that 
Week 48 assessment was favorable to patients on the q12w regimen, primary timepoint was advantageous to 
brolucizumab. However, this is mitigated by the first key secondary endpoint, mean change in BCVA from 
Baseline averaged over the period Week 36 to Week 48, which could overcome the problem of a single 
timepoint in the context of multiple regimens. 
Imputation of the missing data has been addressed with LOCF method in the main analysis. This can be 
questionable when the treatment is supposed to slow down a progressive disease and, in this case, the 
inevitable degradation of the visual acuity over time. However, sensibility analysis using multiple imputation, 
provided within the responses, give positive outcomes which are consistent with analysis using LOCF.  
Overall, differences between 3 mg and 6 mg doses across primary and secondary endpoints were numerically 
very limited and not clinically significant. In that perspective, there are no strong evidences leading to 
support the choice of the 6 mg dose over the 3 mg dose for Marketing Authorisation. 
Only naïve patient was included in the brolucizumab clinical development.  Good outcomes are expected in 
the selected population, recently diagnosed (< 3 months) with a relevant percentage of patients with 
preserved visual acuity.  It is unknown if the reported response will be reached in patients with more 
advanced/pretreated condition. However, given that brolucizumab was compared (non-inferiority) with 
aflibercept in the pivotal trial a similar efficacy in the intended population can reasonably be assumed. 
Support of the regimen 
Disease activity guidance criteria, used to assess the need of q8w regimen instead of q12w, were more 
stringent at Week 16 compared to the following visit, in order to select patients to have more chance to 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 109/117 
 
  
  
remain on q12w regiment. The Applicant explained that criteria at Week 16 were also more stringent than 
real life practice. Therefore, in real life, the probability for a patient to remain on q12w regimen could be 
lower than in Phase III studies. 
A substantial part of patients (more than 20 %) treated by brolucizumab were not eligible to q12w injections 
and never underwent this regimen. Together with the fact that more than 40 % of the patients were not on 
q12w anymore by the first year of treatment, concerns are raised on the generability of the q12w regimen as 
the reference posology. However, Product Information has been updated to reflect that patients with disease 
activity at week 16 should be treated directly with a q8w regimen. 
Additionally, neither studies investigated personalized regimen (pro re nata or Treat-and-Extend). This raises 
concerns on the management of the patient since such treatment strategies are largely used in common 
practice to manage anti-VEGF IVT medication. Indeed, personalized treatments allow reduction of the 
number of injections, and, consequently, the risk linked to intravitreal injection and the patient burden. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Ocular safety profile of brolucizumab seems similar to aflibercept except for intraocular inflammation and 
ocular occlusive events. 
Most common AE reported with brolucizumab 6mg pertained to SOC Eye disorders and the most reported AE 
was conjunctival haemorrhage (4% in the loading phase and 6.3% at 96 weeks) and reduced visual acuity 
(2% in the loading phase and 7.3% at 96 weeks). Similar rates were reported in aflibercept group. 
Other AE related to injection procedure were reported such as endophthalmitis (0.7%), IOP increased 
(3.8%), retinal pigment epithelial tears (2.7%), retinal detachment (1.6%) and traumatic cataract (0.1%) 
with no difference compared to aflibercept group. 
The main difference observed between aflibercept and brolucizumab 6mg group is for intraocular 
inflammations which was reported with a higher incidence in brolucizumab group (4.4%vs 0.8%) with a risk 
difference for 3.6% (95% CI 1.08-6.53). 
Most of these events were mild and moderate (~94%) and were observed in the 6 first months of treatment. 
Most frequently preferred terms retrieved were uveitis, iritis and vitritis. Majority of cases resolved (81.3%) 
and some resolved with sequelae (9.4%). No action was necessary in 65.6% of cases but drug was 
temporary interrupted in 12.5% of cases and withdrawn in 31.3% of cases.  
Cases of retinal artery occlusion (RAO) which is an ophthalmological emergency were also reported with 
brolucizumab in the study eyes with a higher incidence compared to aflibercept (0.8% vs 0.1%). These AE 
are not listed in the product information of other anti-VEGF drugs by IVT route. The mechanism of action 
proposed is a direct compression by inflammation of the artery and considering the common frequency of 
intraocular inflammation with brolucizumab and the need of prompt medical care in case of RAO occurrence, 
a warning has been introduced in the product information to alert healthcare professionals and patients. For 
cases in the fellow eyes, brolucizumab would need to come via the systemic circulation in order to reach the 
fellow eye in absence of direct vascular link between the two eyes. At this stage, due to uncertainties related 
to systemic profile in case of bilateral treatment, causal role of RAO in fellow eyes is unknown and this topic 
need to be closely monitored in post-marketing setting through PSUR. 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 110/117 
 
  
  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Long-term data 
Limited long-term data is available despite an extension study of HAWK to collect additional data over 24-
weeks.  In this Study no relevant difference was observed compared to the last 6 months of the core study. 
Safety data beyond 2 years has thus been included in the RMP as missing information. 
Systemic safety profile 
As with other anti-VEGF drugs by IVT route, concerns are raised by the PRAC and CHMP Rapporteurs about 
potential risk of systemic AE especially arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) due to pharmacological 
plausibility. 
ATE cases were reported with no major difference between brolucizumab and aflibercept groups (1.2% vs 
0.4% respectively) despite low rate reported which do make the comparison difficult to assess. The fact that 
the population treated is elderly with an elevated risk for cardiovascular events, and the absence of placebo-
controlled group make the evaluation difficult. The fact that systemic AE are still closely monitored for 
aflibercept and that their causal role has not be ruled out at this stage, do not allow consideration of lower 
risk for brolucizumab. 
In 16 cases reported from clinical trials, a compatible chronology (time to onset from last dose <30 days 
considering systemic half-life of brolucizumab of 4.4 days) do not allow to exclude a contributory role of 
brolucizumab in ATE occurrence despite cardiovascular risk factors identified in all cases.  
Similar observations were reported for brolucizumab 6 mg compared to aflibercept for other AE known to be 
induced by anti-VEGF drugs by IV route such as venous thromboembolic events (0.7% vs 1.2% respectively), 
hypertension (9.2% vs 9.9% respectively) and non-ocular haemorrhage (7.1% vs 7.8%).  
Pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  data  revealing  rapid  clearance  of  brolucizumab,  absence  of 
accumulation and free VEGF suppression of short duration after brolucizumab injection are quite reassuring. 
However, the CHMP considers that the claimed systemic profile is unknown in case of bilateral treatment which 
is a common practice in real life conditions and has not been studied with brolucizumab. Published data reported 
bilateral disease in 20 to 42% of AMD population (A. Rasmussen et al, 2017) and between 19% to 68% of AMD 
patients  with  unilateral  disease  will  progress  to  bilateral  disease  within  five  years  (Joachim  N  et  al,  2017). 
Bilateral treatment would necessitate total dose of 12 mg for which no non-clinical and pharmacokinetic data 
are available.  This point is of concern and need to be closely monitored in post-marketing setting. 
Dose of 6mg 
Uncertainties have been initially raised on the choice of the dose of 6 mg. Among the two phase III clinical 
studies, brolucizumab 3mg was tested in only one study (HAWK study, not tested in HARRIER). 
Indeed, efficacy data revealed a comparable profile for brolucizumab 3 mg and 6 mg. 
According to the safety data, ocular safety profile seemed to be comparable for doses 3 mg and 6 mg. 
Regarding, systemic safety profile, as mentioned above, there is a theoretical risk of systemic event due to 
pharmacological plausibility but considering confounding factors in the treated population and the low 
systemic exposure in case of intravitreal administration, this risk is not confirmed.

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data are reassuring at 6mg but this safety profile is also to be 
considered in the context of bilateral treatment which would necessitate total dose of 12 mg for which no 
pharmacokinetic data are available.  The choice of the lower dose would be a precautionary measure but 
considering that the Applicant want to maintain the dose of 6mg, a close monitoring is needed in post-
marketing to confirm absence of systemic AE in case of bilateral treatment.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The fact that the small molecule size of brolucizumab would facilitate the tissue penetration and would result 
in an improved and prolonged effect has not been sustained with the results provided. While slightly better 
results in anatomical outcomes were reported with brolucizumab compared to aflibercept, visual acuity gain 
favoured aflibercept over brolucizumab. 
Brolucizumab (3 mg and 6 mg) demonstrated a similar benefit profile with the comparator, aflibercept. The 
non-inferiority was largely met in the primary and the first key secondary endpoint. As required in such 
context, analysis in FAS population and PPS population were consistent. The size of the effect in visual 
function (BCVA) was very close across the treatment groups. Moreover, long term data (2 years) provided a 
sufficient level of evidence on the maintenance of the benefit over the time. Additionally, endpoints related to 
Assessment report  
EMA/23630/2020 
Page 114/117 
 
  
  
 
anatomical parameters and Quality of Life brought reassurance on the efficacy of brolucizumab in the 
treatment of the patient having neovascular AMD. 
The proposed dose regimen may represent a benefit with respect to other more frequently administered anti-
VEGF  therapies  (e.g.  bevacizumab)  in  reducing  the  burden  of  treatment.  Otherwise,  it  is  unknown  how 
brolucizumab compares with existing flexible dose regimens (e.g. ranibizumab or aflibercept treat-and-extend 
dosing regimen). In principle, no clear advantage can be anticipated without further investigations on flexible 
dose regimens.   
Ocular safety profile of brolucizumab appears to be similar to other anti-VEGF drugs by IVT route. The most 
commonly reported AE were conjunctival haemorrhage and visual acuity reduced with similar rates between 
aflibercept and brolucizumab arms. 
Other AE known to be induced by anti-VEGF agents by IVT route and related to injection procedure were also 
reported with similar rates between both groups such as endophthalmitis, IOP increase, traumatic cataract, 
retinal pigment epithelial tears and retinal tear/detachment. 
Compared to aflibercept, two AE were reported with a higher incidence for brolucizumab: intraocular 
inflammations and retinal artery occlusive events. For intraocular inflammations, no action was necessary in 
most cases but one third necessitated a withdrawal of treatment. Warnings have been introduced in the 
SmPC for both events and a close monitoring is requested in post-marketing setting to further investigate 
these events. 
As with other anti-VEGF drug products administered by intravitreal injections, concerns are shared by the 
CHMP and the PRAC Rapporteurs on potential role of brolucizumab in systemic AE occurrence despite low 
systemic exposure, especially arterial thromboembolic events, venous thromboembolic events, hypertension 
and non-ocular haemorrhage which are known risks of anti-VEGF drugs by IV route due to pharmacological 
plausibility. Similar rates were reported compared to aflibercept for which this topic is still of concern and is 
closely monitored through PSUR. For ATE, a relationship to brolucizumab is difficult to assess because of the 
treated population who are elderly patients with many cardiovascular risk factors considered as confounding 
factors. In 16 cases from phase III clinical trials, a compatible chronology does not allow to exclude a 
contributory role of brolucizumab in ATE occurrence despite cardiovascular risk factors reported in all cases.   
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data revealing rapid clearance of brolucizumab, absence of 
accumulation and free VEGF suppression of short duration after brolucizumab injection are quite reassuring. 
However, the CHMP considers that the claimed systemic profile in case of bilateral treatment need to be 
better investigated and closely monitored in post-marketing due to absence of PK data at 12mg. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The favourable effects demonstrated in the pivotal clinical studies provided evidence on the efficacy of 
brolucizumab, in visual function as well as in anatomical parameters, in the treatment of patient with 
neovascular AMD. Additionally, the ocular safety profile of brolucizumab seems to be similar to other anti-
VEGF drugs by IVT route. 
It is to emphasize that the benefit-risk balance is positive for both 3 mg and 6 mg doses. No strong evidence 
has been provided by the Applicant to clearly support the choice of the higher dose. However, the 6 mg dose 
could be untimely accepted based on limited numerical differences in efficacy and the similarity of the safety

profile  in  unilateral  administration  between  the  2  doses.  Nonetheless,  considering  absence  of  supportive 
pharmacokinetic  data  at  12  mg,  systemic  profile  for  this  dose  need  to  be  better  investigated  and  closely 
monitored in post-marketing setting.

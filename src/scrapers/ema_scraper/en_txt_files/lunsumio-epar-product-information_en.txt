Rate of infusion 
Infusions of Lunsumio in Cycle 1 should be 
administered over a minimum of 4 hours.  
If the infusions were well-tolerated in 
Cycle 1, subsequent infusions of Lunsumio 
may be administered over 2 hours. 
Duration of treatment  
Lunsumio should be administered for 8 cycles, unless a patient experiences unacceptable toxicity or 
disease progression. 
For patients who achieve a complete response, no further treatment beyond 8 cycles is required. For 
patients who achieve a partial response or have stable disease in response to treatment with Lunsumio 
after 8 cycles, an additional 9 cycles of treatment (17 cycles total) should be administered, unless a 
patient experiences unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. 
Delayed or missed dose 
If any dose in cycle 1 is delayed for > 7 days, the previous tolerated dose should be repeated prior to 
resuming the planned treatment schedule.  
If a dose interruption occurs between Cycles 1 and 2 that results in a treatment-free interval 
of ≥ 6 weeks, Lunsumio should be administered at 1 mg on Day 1, 2 mg on Day 8, then resume the 
planned Cycle 2 treatment of 60 mg on Day 15. 
If a dose interruption occurs that results in a treatment-free interval of ≥ 6 weeks between any Cycles 
in Cycle 3 onwards, Lunsumio should be administered at 1 mg on Day 1, 2 mg on Day 8, then resume 
the planned treatment schedule of 30 mg on Day 15.  
Dose modification  
Patients who experience grade 3 or 4 reactions (e.g. serious infection, tumour flare, tumour lysis 
syndrome) should have treatment temporarily withheld until symptoms are resolved (see section 4.4).  
CRS should be identified based on clinical presentation (see section 4.4). Patients should be evaluated 
and treated for, other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension, such as infections/sepsis. Infusion 
related reactions (IRR) may be clinically indistinguishable from manifestations of CRS. If CRS or IRR

Special populations 
Elderly  
No dose adjustment of Lunsumio is required in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
Lunsumio has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment. Dose adjustments are not 
considered necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment based on pharmacokinetics 
(see section 5.2). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
Lunsumio has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Dose adjustments are not 
considered necessary based on pharmacokinetics (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Lunsumio in children below 18 years of age have not yet been established. 
Method of administration 
Lunsumio is for intravenous use only. 
Lunsumio must be diluted using aseptic technique under the supervision of a healthcare professional. It 
should be administered as an intravenous infusion through a dedicated infusion line. Do not use an in-
line filter to administer Lunsumio. Drip chamber filters can be used to administer Lunsumio. 
The first cycle of Lunsumio should be administered over a minimum of 4 hours as intravenous 
infusion. If the infusions are well-tolerated in cycle 1, the subsequent cycles may be administered over 
a 2-hours infusion. 
Lunsumio must not be administered as intravenous push or bolus. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) 
CRS, including life-threatening reactions, have occurred in patients receiving Lunsumio (see 
section 4.8). Signs and symptoms included pyrexia, chills, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, and 
headache. Infusion related reactions may be clinically indistinguishable from manifestations of CRS. 
CRS events occurred predominantly in cycle 1 and were mainly associated with Day 1 and Day 15 
dose administrations.  
Patients should be premedicated with corticosteroids, antipyretics and antihistamines at least through 
cycle 2. Patients must receive adequate hydration prior to the administration of Lunsumio. Patients 
should be monitored for signs or symptoms of CRS. Patients should be counselled to seek immediate 
medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time. Physicians should institute 
treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids as indicated. (see section 4.2).  
Serious infections 
Serious infections such as pneumonia, bacteraemia, and sepsis or septic shock have occurred in 
patients receiving Lunsumio, some of which were life-threatening or fatal events (see section 4.8). 
Febrile neutropenia was observed in patients after receiving Lunsumio infusion. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lunsumio should not be administered in the presence of active infections. Caution should be exercised 
when considering the use of Lunsumio in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections 
(e.g., chronic, active Epstein-Barr Virus), with underlying conditions that may predispose to infections 
or who have had significant prior immunosuppressive treatment. Patients should be administered 
prophylactic antibacterial, antiviral and/or antifungal medicinal products, as appropriate. Patients 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection, before and after Lunsumio administration, 
and treated appropriately. In the event of febrile neutropenia, patients should be evaluated for infection 
and managed with antibiotics, fluids and other supportive care, according to local guidelines. 
Tumour flare 
Tumour flare has been reported in patients treated with Lunsumio (see section 4.8). Manifestations 
included new or worsening pleural effusions, localised pain and swelling at the sites of lymphoma 
lesions and tumour inflammation. Consistent with the mechanism of action of Lunsumio, tumour flare 
is likely due to the influx of T-cells into tumour sites following Lunsumio administration. 
There are no specific risk factors for tumour flare that have been identified, however, there is a 
heightened risk of compromise and morbidity due to mass effect secondary to tumour flare in patients 
with bulky tumours located in close proximity to airways and/or a vital organ. Patients treated with 
Lunsumio should be monitored and evaluated for tumour flare at critical anatomical sites. 
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) 
TLS has been reported in patients receiving Lunsumio (see section 4.8). Patients must have adequate 
hydration prior to the administration of Lunsumio. Patients should be administered prophylactic anti-
hyperuricemic therapy (e.g allopurinol, rasburicase), as appropriate. Patients should be monitored for 
signs or symptoms of TLS, especially patients with high tumour burden or rapidly proliferative 
tumours, and patients with reduced renal function. Patients should be monitored for blood chemistries 
and abnormalities should be managed promptly.  
Immunisation  
Live and/or live-attenuated vaccines should not be given concurrently with Lunsumio. Studies have 
not been conducted in patients who recently received live vaccines. 
Patient card  
The prescriber must discuss the risks of Lunsumio therapy with the patient. The patient should be 
provided with the patient card and instructed to carry it at all times. The patient card describes the 
common signs and symptoms of CRS, and provides instructions on when a patient should seek 
medical attention. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed.  
A transient clinically relevant effect on CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. 
warfarin, voriconazole, cyclosporine, etc) cannot be excluded, since initiation of Lunsumio treatment 
causes a transient increase in cytokine levels which may cause inhibition of CYP450 enzymes. On 
initiation of Lunsumio therapy in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow 
therapeutic index, therapeutic monitoring should be considered. The dose of the concomitant 
medicinal product should be adjusted as needed.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception while receiving Lunsumio and for 
at least 3 months after the last infusion of Lunsumio. 
Pregnancy  
There are no data from the use of Lunsumio in pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient with 
respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Lunsumio is not recommended during pregnancy and 
in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
Breast-feeding  
It is unknown whether mosunetuzumab/metabolites are  excreted in human milk. A risk to 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with 
Lunsumio therapy.  
Fertility 
No human data on fertility are available. No impairments were observed in male or female 
reproductive organs in the 26-week toxicity studies with cynomolgus monkeys at exposures (AUC) 
similar to exposure (AUC) in patients receiving the recommended dose. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Lunsumio has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients who experience 
events that impair consciousness should be evaluated and advised not to drive and to refrain from 
operating heavy or potentially dangerous machines until events are resolved. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The adverse reactions (ARs) described in this section were identified from the pivotal clinical trial 
GO29781 in patients treated at the recommended dose (n=218). Patients had follicular lymphoma 
(41.3%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma/transformed follicular lymphoma (40.4%) mantle cell 
lymphoma (11.5%), Richter’s transformation (6.4%), and other histologies (0.5%).  The median 
number of cycles of Lunsumio received was 8 (range 1 -17), 37% of patients received 8 cycles, and 
15% received more than 8 cycles up to 17 cycles. 
The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) observed were cytokine release syndrome, neutropenia, 
pyrexia, hypophosphatemia and headache. The most common serious adverse reactions (≥ 2%) 
observed included cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (21% by ASTCT grading system), pyrexia (5%), 
and pneumonia (3%). Nine of 218 patients (4.1%) discontinued Lunsumio due to an adverse event. 
CRS was the only adverse reaction that led to discontinuation in more than one patient (2 patients 
[0.9%]). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and categories of 
frequency. Frequency categories are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), 
uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse 
reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 
CRS (ASTCT grading system) of any grade occurred in 39% (86/218) of patients, with grade 2 
occurring in 14%, grade 3 occurring in 2.3%, and grade 4 occurring in 0.5% of patients treated with 
Lunsumio. The one patient with the grade 4 event was a patient with FL in the leukemic phase who 
also experienced concurrent TLS.  
CRS of any grade occurred in 15% of patients after the Cycle 1, Day 1 dose; 5% after the Cycle 1, 
Day 8 dose; 33% after the Cycle 1, Day 15 dose, 5% occurred in patients after the Cycle 2 and 1% in 
Cycles 3 and beyond. The median time to CRS onset from the start of administration in Cycle 1 Day 1 
was 5 hours (range: 1-73 hours), Cycle 1 Day 8 was 28 hours (range: 5-81 hours), Cycle 1 Day 15 was 
25 hours (range: 0.1-391 hours), and Cycle 2 Day 1 was 46 hours (range: 12-82 hours). CRS resolved 
in all patients, and the median duration of CRS events was 3 days (range 1-29 days). 
Of the 86 patients that experienced CRS, the most common signs and symptoms of CRS included 
pyrexia (98%), chills (36%), hypotension (35%), tachycardia (24%), hypoxia (22%) and headache 
(16%). 
Tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids were used to manage a CRS event in 16% of patients: 6% received 
tocilizumab alone, 6% received corticosteroids alone, and 4% received both tocilizumab and 
corticosteroids. Among the 10% of patients who received tocilizumab (with or without a 
corticosteroid), 86% received only one dose of tocilizumab, with no more than two doses of 
tocilizumab administered for a single CRS event. In patients experiencing Grade 2 CRS, 48% of 
patients were treated with symptomatic management without corticosteroids or tocilizumab, 18% 
received tocilizumab alone, 21% received corticosteroids alone, and 12% received both corticosteroids 
and tocilizumab. Patients with grade 3 or grade 4 CRS received tocilizumab, corticosteroids, 
vasopressors and/or oxygen supplementation. Three percent of patients experienced hypotension 
and/or hypoxia without fever following Lunsumio administration; 2% of patients received tocilizumab 
and/or corticosteroids in the absence of fever. 
Hospitalizations due to CRS occurred in 21% of patients and the median duration of hospitalization 
was 5 days (range 0-30 days). 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 28% of patients, including 24% Grade 3-4 events. The median 
time to onset of first neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased events was 48 days (range: 1-280 days), 
with median duration of 8 days (range: 1-314 days). Of the 60 patients who had neutropenia/neutrophil 
count decreased events 68% received treatment G-CSF to treat the events. 
Serious infections 
Serious infections of any grade occurred in 17% of patients. 1.8% of patients experienced serious 
infections concurrently with grade 3-4 neutropenia. The median time to onset of first serious infection 
was 50 days (range: 1-561 days), with median duration of 12 days (range: 2-174 days). Grade 5 events 
occurred in 0.9% of patients, which included pneumonia and sepsis. 
Tumour flare 
Tumour flare (including pleural effusion and tumour inflammation) occurred in 4% of patients, which 
included 1.8% grade 2 and 2.3% grade 3 events. The median time to onset was 13 days (range 
5-84 days), and median duration was 10 days (range 1-77 days).  
Tumour Lysis Syndrome (TLS) 
TLS occurred in 0.9% of patients, concurrent with CRS. One patient with follicular lymphoma was in 
the leukemic phase who experienced Grade 4 TLS. TLS onset was on days 2 and 24, and resolved 
within 4 and 6 days, respectively.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, 
and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents; other antineoplastic agents; monoclonal antibodies, 
ATC code: L01FX25  
Mechanism of action 
Mosunetuzumab is an anti-CD20/CD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody targeting CD20-expressing 
B-cells. It is a conditional agonist; targeted B-cell killing is observed only upon simultaneous binding 
to CD20 on B-cells and CD3 on T-cells. Engagement of both arms of mosunetuzumab results in the 
formation of an immunologic synapse between a target B cell and a cytotoxic T cell leading to T-cell 
activation. Subsequent directed release of perforin and granzymes from T-cell activation through the 
immunologic synapsis induce B-cell lysis leading to cell death.  
Lunsumio caused B-cell depletion (defined as CD19 B-cell counts < 0.07 x 109/L) and 
hypogammaglobulinemia (defined as IgG levels < 500 mg/dL).

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Relapsed or refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 
An open-label, multicentre, multi-cohort study (GO29781) was conducted to evaluate Lunsumio in 
patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for whom there was no available 
therapy expected to improve survival. In the follicular lymphoma (FL) cohort (n=90), patients with 
relapsed or refractory FL (Grade 1-3A) were required to have received at least two prior systemic 
therapies, including an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and an alkylating agent. Patients with FL 
Grade 3b and patients with transformed FL at study entry were not eligible; those with a history of 
transformed FL but FL Grade 1-3A at study entry were included in the FL cohort. 
The study excluded patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 
≥ 2, significant cardiovascular disease (such as New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac 
disease, myocardial infarction within the last 6 months, unstable arrhythmias, or unstable angina), 
significant active pulmonary disease, impaired renal functions (Creatinine clearance 
[CrCl] < 60 mL/min with elevated serum creatinine level), active autoimmune disease requiring 
immunosuppressive therapy, active infections (i.e., chronic active EBV, acute or chronic hepatitis C, 
hepatitis B, HIV), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, current or a history of CNS lymphoma 
or CNS disease, a history of macrophage activation syndrome / hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, 
prior allogeneic stem cell transplant, or prior organ transplantation. 
Patients received Lunsumio intravenously in a 21-day Cycle as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Cycle 1 Day 1: 1 mg 
Cycle 1 Day 8: 2 mg 
Cycle 1 Day 15: 60 mg 
Cycle 2 Day 1: 60 mg 
Cycle 3 and beyond Day 1: 30 mg 
The median number of cycles was 8, 59% received 8 cycles, and 18% received more than 8 cycles up 
to 17 cycles. 
The median age was 60 years (range 29 to 90 years) with 31% being > age 65, and 7.8% being ≥ age 
75. Sixty-one percent were male, 82% were white, 9% were Asian, 4% were Black, 100% had an 
ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and 34% of patients had bulky disease (at least one lesion > 6 cm). 
The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range: 2-10), with 38% receiving 2 prior therapies, 31% 
receiving 3 prior therapies and 31% receiving more than 3 prior therapies.  
All patients received prior anti-CD20 and alkylator therapies, 21% received autologous stem cell 
transplant, 19% received PI3K inhibitors, 9% received prior rituximab plus lenalidomide therapy, and 
3% received CAR-T therapies. Seventy-nine percent of patients were refractory to prior anti-CD20 
monoclonal antibody therapy and 53% were refractory to both anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and 
alkylator therapy. Sixty-nine percent of patients were refractory to the last prior therapy and 52% had 
progression of disease within 24 months of first systemic therapy.   
The primary efficacy endpoint was complete response (CR) as assessed by an independent review 
facility (IRF) according to standard criteria for NHL (Cheson 2007). The efficacy results are 
summarised in Table 5.

Clinical Cut-off: 27 August 2021 
Hypothesis testing was conducted on the primary endpoint of IRF assessed CR rate. 
1 DOR is defined as the time from the initial occurrence of a documented PR or CR until the patient 
experiences an event (documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs 
first). 
2 DOCR is defined as the time from the initial occurrence of a documented CR until the patient 
experiences an event (documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs 
first). 
The median follow-up for DOR was 14.9 months. Additional exploratory efficacy outcomes included 
the median time to first response (1.4 months, range: 1.1 - 8.9) and the median time to first complete 
response (3.0 months, range: 1.1- 18.9).  
Immunogenicity  
The immunogenicity of mosunetuzumab was evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA). No patients tested positive for anti-mosunetuzumab antibodies in 418 ADA-evaluable 
patients who received Lunsumio single-agent intravenous treatments in Study GO27981. Based on the 
available information, the clinical relevance of anti-mosunetuzumab antibodies could not be assessed. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit results of studies with Lunsumio 
in all subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of mature B-cell neoplasms (see section 4.2 
for information on paediatric use).  
Conditional approval  
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This 
means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency 
will review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be 
updated as necessary. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Mosunetuzumab pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure increased in an approximately dose-proportional 
manner over the dose range studied, from 0.05 to 60 mg. The population pharmacokinetic following 
intravenous administrations of Lunsumio was described by a 2-compartment PK model with time-
dependent clearance, which was parameterized as descending to a steady-state plateau (CLss) from a 
baseline value (CLbase) at the start of treatment according to transitional half-life of 16.3 days. 
Moderate to high pharmacokinetic variability for mosunetuzumab was observed and characterized by 
inter-individual variability (IIV) ranging from 18% to 86% coefficient of variation (CV) for 
mosunetuzumab PK parameters: IIV was estimated for CLbase (63% CV), central volume of 
distribution (31% CV), peripheral volume of distribution (25% CV), CLss (18% CV), and transitional 
half-life (86% CV). 
After the first two Cycles (i.e., 42 days) of the dosing with Lunsumio, the serum concentration reaches 
the Cmax at the end of dose of Cycle 2 Day 1 of the Lunsumio intravenous infusion with an average 
maximal concentration of 17.9 µg/mL and %CV of 49.6%. The average total two cycles (42 days) 
mosunetuzumab exposure AUC was 126 day•µg/mL with %CV of 44.4%. 
Absorption  
Lunsumio is administered intravenously.  
Distribution 
The population estimate of central volume of distribution for mosunetuzumab was 5.49 L with 
intravenous infusion of Lunsumio. Because mosunetuzumab is an antibody, protein binding studies 
were not conducted. 
Biotransformation  
The metabolic pathway of mosunetuzumab has not been directly studied. Like other protein 
therapeutics, mosunetuzumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via 
catabolic pathways.  
Elimination  
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the estimated mean CLss and baseline clearance 
(CLbase) were 1.08 L/day and 0.584 L/day, respectively. The terminal half-life estimate was 16.1 days 
at steady state based on population pharmacokinetic model estimates. The results obtained in study 
GO29781 indicate that mosunetuzumab serum concentration reaches the Cmax at the end of the 
intravenous infusion and declines in a bi-exponential fashion.  
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Age did not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab based on a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis with patients aged 19-96 years (n=439). No clinically important difference 
was observed in the pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab for patients in this age group. 
Bodyweight 
Like other therapeutic proteins, bodyweight was positively associated with mosunetuzumab estimated 
clearance and volume of distribution. However, based on exposure-response analysis and clinical 
exposure margins, considering the exposures in patients at either “low” (<50 kg) or “high” (≥112 kg) 
weight, no dose adjustment is required due to patient bodyweight.   
Gender 
Based upon population pharmacokinetic analysis, steady-state clearance of mosunetuzumab is 
marginally lower in females (~13%) compared to males. No dose adjustment is required due to gender, 
based on exposure-response analysis. 
Race 
Race (Asian vs. non-Asian) was not identified as a covariate influencing mosunetuzumab 
pharmacokinetics. 
Renal impairment 
No dedicated studies have been conducted to determine the effect of renal impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab. The renal elimination of intact mosunetuzumab, an IgG 
monoclonal antibody, is expected to be low and of minor importance. 
The population PK analysis of mosunetuzumab showed that creatinine clearance (CrCl) does not affect 
pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab. Pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab in patients with mild 
(CrCl 60 to 89 mL/min, n=178) or moderate (CrCl 30 to 59 mL/min, n=53) renal impairment were 
similar to those in patients with normal renal function (CrCl ≥ 90 mL/min, n=200). Pharmacokinetic 
data in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 to 29 mL/min) is limited (n=1), therefore no 
dose recommendations can be made. Lunsumio was not studied in patients with end-stage renal 
disease and/or who are on dialysis. 
Hepatic impairment  
No specific studies have been conducted to determine the effect of hepatic impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab. IgGs are mainly eliminated via intracellular catabolism and 
hepatic impairment is not expected to influence clearance of mosunetuzumab. 
The population PK analysis of mosunetuzumab showed that hepatic impairment does not affect 
pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab. Pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab in patients with mild 
hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > ULN to 1.5 x ULN or AST > ULN, n=53) were similar to those 
in patients with normal hepatic function (n=384). The number of patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment is limited (total bilirubin > 1.5–3 x ULN, any AST, n=2) and no patients with severe 
hepatic impairment have been studied. 
Paediatric population 
No studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab in the 
paediatric population (< 18 years old).

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Systemic toxicity 
Key nonclinical findings with mosunetuzumab identified in single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies up 
to 26-weeks in duration included transient post-dose CRS primarily limited to the first dose, 
vascular/perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrates that were primarily in the CNS and infrequently in 
other organs that were likely secondary to cytokine release and immune cell activation, and increased 
susceptibility to infection following chronic dosing due to sustained B-cell depletion.  
All of the findings were considered pharmacologically-mediated effects and reversible. Across studies 
there was a single incidence of convulsion in one animal at Cmax and AUC exposures (time-averaged 
over 7 days) of 3.3- and 1.8- fold higher, respectively, than those in patients receiving Lunsumio at the 
recommended dose and schedule in Study GO29781. 
Impairment of fertility 
An assessment of the male and female reproductive organs was included in a 26-week chronic toxicity 
study in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys administered by intravenous infusion. Mosunetuzumab 
had no effect on either male or female reproductive organs at exposures (AUC) similar to exposure 
(AUC) in patients receiving the recommended dose. 
Reproductive toxicity  
No developmental toxicity studies in animals have been conducted with mosunetuzumab. Based on 
low placental transfer of antibodies during the first trimester, the mechanism of action and available 
data of mosunetuzumab, and the data on the anti-CD20 antibody class, the risk for teratogenicity is 
low. Studies with mosunetuzumab in non-pregnant animals have demonstrated that prolonged B-cell 
depletion can lead to increased risk of opportunistic infection, which may cause foetal loss. Transient 
CRS associated with Lunsumio administration may also be harmful to pregnancy.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Lunsumio is and what it is used for 
Lunsumio contains the active substance mosunetuzumab, which is a type of antibody. This is a cancer 
medicine. It is used to treat adults who have a blood cancer called follicular lymphoma (FL).  
In FL, a type of white blood cells called ‘B cells’ become cancerous. The abnormal B cells do not 
work properly and grow too quickly, crowding out the normal B cells in the bone marrow and lymph 
nodes that help protect you from infection. 
Lunsumio is given to patients who have tried at least two previous treatments for FL, when either the 
cancer has not responded to them, or it has come back again. 
How Lunsumio works 
The active substance in Lunsumio, mosunetuzumab, is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein that 
attaches to specific targets in the body. In this case, mosunetuzumab attaches to a target substance 
found on B cells, including the cancerous B cells, and another target found on ‘T cells’, a different 
type of white blood cell. T cells are another part of the body’s defences that can destroy invading cells. 
By attaching the two cells together like a bridge, Lunsumio encourages the T cells to destroy the 
cancerous B cells. This helps control the FL and prevent its spread. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Lunsumio 
You must not be given Lunsumio 
• 
if you are allergic to mosunetuzumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Lunsumio. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Lunsumio if any of the following apply to you (or 
you are not sure):  
• 
• 
you have ever had heart, lung or kidney problems  
you have an infection, or have had an infection in the past which lasted a long time or keeps 
coming back 
you are due to have a vaccine or you know you may need to have one in the near future. 
• 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before having this 
medicine. 
Tell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of any of the side effects listed below during or 
after treatment with Lunsumio. You may need additional medical treatment. The symptoms of each 
side effect are listed in section 4.  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Cytokine release syndrome – a condition associated with medicines that stimulate T cells.  
− 
 Before each infusion, you may be given medicines, which help reduce possible side 
effects of cytokine release syndrome.  
Tumour lysis syndrome – some people may get unusual levels of some salts in the 
blood – caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells during treatment.  
− 
Your doctor or nurse will do blood tests to check for this condition. Before each infusion, 
you should be well-hydrated and may be given medicines that can help reduce high levels 
of uric acid. These may help reduce possible side effects of tumour lysis syndrome.  
Tumour flare – as your cancer is destroyed, it may react and appear to get worse – this is called 
‘tumour flare reaction’.  
Infections – you may get signs of infection, which can vary depending on where in the 
body the infection is. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be used in children or adolescents under the age of 18. This is because there 
is no information about use in this age group.  
Other medicines and Lunsumio  
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This 
includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
It is important to tell your doctor before and during treatment if you are pregnant, think you may be 
pregnant, or are planning to get pregnant. This is because Lunsumio may affect your unborn baby.  
• 
Do not use Lunsumio during pregnancy, unless after discussion with your doctor, it is agreed 
that the benefits of treatment outweigh any risk to the unborn baby. 
Contraception 
Women who could become pregnant must use effective contraception during treatment – and for 
3 months after the last dose of Lunsumio.   
• 
Talk to your doctor or nurse about suitable methods of contraception. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding  
You must not breast-feed during and for at least 3 months after your last treatment. This is because it is 
not known whether any Lunsumio passes into breast milk and could therefore affect the baby. 
Driving and using machines  
Lunsumio has minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use any tools or machines. If you feel 
any symptoms that may affect your ability to drive, do not drive, cycle or use tools or machines until 
the reaction stops. See section 4 for more information about side effects. 
3. 
How Lunsumio is given  
Lunsumio is given under the supervision of a doctor experienced in giving such treatments. Follow the 
treatment schedule explained to you by your doctor. Check with your doctor if you are not sure. 
How Lunsumio is given 
It is given into a vein, as a drip (infusion). 
• 
It is given over 4 hours during the first cycle. Each cycle is 21 days and in the first cycle, you 
will be given the 4 hour infusion on day 1, day 8 and day 15.  
If side effects are not too severe, the dose may be given over 2 hours during the 
following cycles. 
• 
Medicines given before Lunsumio treatment  
You may be given other medicines 30 to 60 minutes before you are given Lunsumio. This is to help 
prevent infusion reactions and fever. These other medicines may include: 
• 
• 
• 
Corticosteroids – such as dexamethasone or methylprednisolone 
Paracetamol  
An antihistamine - such as diphenhydramine 
How much Lunsumio is given  
Lunsumio is normally given in cycles of 21 days. The recommended treatment duration is at least 
8 treatment cycles. However, depending on side effects and how the disease responds to treatment, you 
may be given up to 17 cycles.  
In cycle 1, you will be given 3 doses of Lunsumio in the 21 days: 
• 
• 
• 
Day 1: 1 mg 
Day 8: 2 mg 
Day 15: 60 mg 
In cycle 2, you will be given just one dose:  
• 
Day 1: 60 mg 
In cycles 3 to 17, you will be given just one dose:  
• 
Day 1: 30 mg 
If you miss a dose of Lunsumio 
If you miss an appointment, make another one straight away. For the treatment to be fully effective, it 
is very important not to miss a dose. 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you stop receiving Lunsumio 
Do not stop treatment with Lunsumio unless you have discussed this with your doctor. This is because 
stopping treatment may make your condition worse.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.

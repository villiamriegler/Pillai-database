1.  Introduction 
On 5th June 2015, the MAH submitted the results of a completed study (SP904) for Lacosamide 
(Vimpat), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, as it 
included 3 subjects who were <18 years old at the time of study entry. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that the study “A Multicenter, Open-label Extension Trial to Assess the Long-term 
Use of Lacosamide Monotherapy and Safety of Lacosamide Monotherapy and Adjunctive Therapy in 
Subjects with Partial-onset Seizures number(s)” (Study no SP904) is part of a clinical development 
program. The extension application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e containing 
several studies) is expected to be submitted by January/16. A line listing of all the concerned 
studies is annexed. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Lacosamide was supplied as white, oval, immediate-release, film-coated tablets in strengths of 50 
and 100mg. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Lacosamide was first approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2008 and is indicated as 
adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary 
generalization in adult and adolescent (16 to 18 years) patients with epilepsy. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
This document summarizes disposition and treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) for the 3 
subjects from SP904 who were <18 years old at the time of study entry in order to fulfill the 
requirement of reporting pediatric data as outlined in Article 46. Data from the overall subject 
population in SP904 are provided for comparison in the accompanying CSR (Module 5.3.5.1). As 
SP904 was primarily a safety study, no efficacy variables were assessed.

Methods 
Objective(s) 
•  Obtain information about the percentage of subjects who remained on lacosamide (LCM) 
monotherapy and the duration of LCM monotherapy treatment 
•  Obtain information about the long-term safety of LCM when used as monotherapy or 
adjunctive therapy in subjects with partial-onset seizures 
Study design/Study population 
SP904 was a multicenter, open label extension study to assess the long term use of LCM 
monotherapy and safety of LCM monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in subjects with partial onset 
seizures (with and without secondary generalization) who were previously enrolled in SP902. 
SP902 was a historical controlled, multicenter, double blind, randomized, conversion to 
monotherapy study to assess the efficacy and safety of LCM 400mg/day monotherapy in subjects 
16 to 70 years of age with partial onset seizures. Subjects who entered the Maintenance Phase of 
SP902 and either completed SP902 or met an exit criterion in SP902 (with the exception of 
subjects enrolled at sites in Germany) were eligible to enroll in this open label extension study. 
Subjects enrolled in SP902 at sites in Germany who entered the Maintenance Phase but were 
withdrawn due to meeting an exit criterion were not eligible to participate in SP904. 
Visits 1 through 3 occurred at 4 week intervals; Visits 4 through 6 occurred at 8 week intervals. 
Beginning at Visit 7, visits were performed at 12 week intervals (Visit 7 through the Termination 
Visit), with telephone contacts required at 4 week intervals to obtain information regarding 
concomitant medication use, adverse events, diary completion, and compliance with the study 
medication schedule. 
The maximum duration of a subject’s study participation was 2 years after Visit 1 in SP904. 
Treatments 
At the termination of the previous study, SP902, subjects received a dose of LCM 300 or 
400mg/day. At the beginning of this extension study, the investigator may have adjusted or 
maintained the LCM dose so that a subject began the study at a dose of LCM 200, 300, or 
400mg/day for subjects who were receiving LCM 300mg/day at the end of SP902, or LCM 300, 
400, or 500mg/day for subjects who were receiving LCM 400mg/day at the end of SP902.  
The investigator was to increase the dose no faster than LCM 100mg/day per week up to maximum 
LCM 800mg/day. 
During the study, investigators were allowed to increase or decrease the dose of LCM to optimize 
tolerability and seizure reduction for each subject. A clinic visit (scheduled or unscheduled) was 
required for all LCM dose increases. For subjects receiving LCM monotherapy at the time of study 
entry, the addition of up to 2 concomitant AEDs was allowed to optimize tolerability and seizure 
reduction. Concomitant AEDs should have been added only when the subject had not optimally or 
adequately responded to a maximum tolerated dose of LCM monotherapy. 
For subjects who entered the study on both LCM and other concomitant AED therapy, concomitant 
AED(s) may have been carefully tapered and discontinued to achieve LCM monotherapy. 
At the end of treatment, or if subjects discontinued the study prematurely, a Termination Visit was 
performed. Subjects receiving LCM ≥300mg/day should have been tapered off gradually at a 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

recommended decrease rate of LCM 200mg/day per week. Clinic visits were not required for LCM 
dose adjustments during the Taper Phase. Subjects receiving LCM 100 or 200mg/day did not 
require a taper. A Final Visit was performed 2 weeks after the final dose of study medication. 
Taper of LCM was not required for subjects who completed or withdrew from the study and who, in 
consultation with the investigator, chose to initiate treatment with commercial LCM. The last 
scheduled study visit for subjects continuing on commercial LCM should have been the Termination 
Visit. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
As this was primarily a safety study, seizure frequency and seizure freedom were not analyzed. 
Long-term use of LCM monotherapy was assessed using the following primary variables:  
• 
Percentage of subjects on LCM monotherapy 
•  Duration of LCM monotherapy treatment 
Long-term safety of LCM monotherapy or adjunctive therapy was assessed using the following 
secondary variables: 
•  Adverse events reported spontaneously by the subject and/or caregiver or observed by the 
investigator 
•  Subject withdrawal due to AEs 
Other safety variables included the following: 
•  Changes in hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis parameters 
•  Changes in 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) 
•  Changes in vital sign measurements (eg, blood pressure, pulse) 
•  Changes in physical or neurological examination findings 
•  Changes in body weight 
Results 
Number analysed 
A total of 3 subjects were <18 years old at SP904 study entry. Details regarding these subjects are 
provided below. 
Efficacy results 
As this was primarily a safety study, seizure frequency and seizure freedom were not analyzed. 
Safety results 
Subject 1 was a 17 year old white female (SP904 CSR Listing 3.1.1). Treatment emergent AEs 
reported during the study were pyrexia, anxiety, panic attack, fall, arthropod bite, headache, and 
dizziness postural. All TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity and none were serious. None of 
the TEAEs led to discontinuation from the study or a dose reduction, and none of the TEAEs were 
considered related to study drug by the investigator (SP904 CSR Listing 9.1.1). The subject used 
the concomitant AED carbamazepine during the study (SP904 CSR Listing 5.1.1). The subject

discontinued from the study prematurely (due to lack of efficacy) after 250 days of treatment with 
LCM in SP904 (SP904 CSR Listing 2.1.1). 
Subject 2 was a 17 year old black male (SP904 CSR Listing 3.1.1). Treatment emergent AEs 
reported during the study were upper respiratory tract infection and pyrexia. All TEAEs were mild 
or moderate in intensity and none were serious. None of the TEAEs led to discontinuation from the 
study or a dose reduction, and none of the TEAEs were considered related to study drug by the 
investigator (SP904 CSR Listing 9.1.1). No concomitant AED use was reported during the study 
(SP904 CSR Listing 5.1.1). The subject completed the study after 726 days of treatment with LCM 
in SP904 (SP904 CSR Listing 2.1.1). 
Subject 3 was a 16 year old white male (SP904 CSR Listing 3.1.1). No TEAEs (SP904 CSR Listing 
9.1.1) or concomitant AED use (SP904 CSR Listing 5.1.1) were reported for this subject during the 
study. The subject completed the study after 763 days of treatment with LCM in SP904 (SP904 
CSR Listing 2.1.1). 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) reported during the study SP904 for the included 3 subjects <18 
years old were mild or moderate in intensity and none were serious. None of the TEAEs led to 
discontinuation from the study or a dose reduction, and none of the TEAEs were considered related 
to study drug by the investigator. Overall, the limited number and the character of the reported 
TEAEs in the 3 subjects do not raise any new safety concerns. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The limited number and the character of the reported TEAEs in the 3 subjects <18 years old 
included in study SP904 do not raise any new safety concerns.

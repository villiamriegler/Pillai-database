2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
About the product 
Vegzelma  has  been  developed  as  a  biosimilar  to  the  reference  product  Avastin  (bevacizumab).  The 
applicant is claiming all of the approved indications for Avastin. 
The  active  substance  (bevacizumab)  is  a  recombinant  humanised  monoclonal  IgG1  antibody.  The 
mechanisms of action (MoA) of bevacizumab is known as Fab-mediated neutralizing activity. The Fab 
region  of  CT-P16  has  the  ability  to  bind  and  neutralise  VEGF  to  block  its  binding  to  VEGF  receptors 
(VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) thereby inhibiting the process of angiogenesis in tumours. 
The applicant is seeking marketing authorisation for CT-P16 in accordance with Article 10(4) of Directive 
2001/83/EC, as amended. The reference biological medicinal product Avastin was originally approved in 
the US in February 2004 and in the EU in January 2005 (EMEA/H/C/000582). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Vegzelma  has  been  developed  as  biosimilar  to  the  reference  medicinal  product  Avastin.  The  finished 
product  is  presented  as  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  containing  25 mg/mL  of  bevacizumab  as 
active  substance.  The  finished  product  is  supplied  in  two  presentations,  i.e.  100 mg /4 mL  and  400 
mg/16 mL in single-use vials and are the same as approved for the reference product. 
Other ingredients are: trehalose dihydrate, sodium phosphate, polysorbate 20 and water for injections.  
The finished product is available in Type I glass a vial with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper and aluminum 
flip-off seal. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
2.2.2.1.  General information 
The  active  substance  (AS)  is  bevacizumab,  a  recombinant  humanised  monoclonal  IgG1  antibody 
(referred by the applicant as CT-P16). Like other IgG of IgG1 subclass, CT-P16 is a glycoprotein with 
one N-linked glycosylation site in the CH2 domain of each heavy chain. The detected oligosaccharides 
consist mostly of G0F and G1F structures. The molecular weight is 146,306 g/mol and formulae for the 
light and heavy chains are C1034H1595N273O338S6 and C2229H3409N583O677S16, respectively. Each heavy chain 
consists of 453 amino acids with 11 cysteine residues, and each light chain consists of 214 amino acids 
with 5 cysteine residues. Each heavy chain contains an N-linked oligosaccharide at glycosylation site at 
N303. All cysteines in the heavy and light chain are involved in either intra- chain or inter-chain disulfide 
bonding.

The mechanisms of action (MoA) of bevacizumab is known as Fab-mediated neutralizing activity. The 
Fab region of CT-P16 has the ability to bind and neutralise VEGF to block its binding to VEGF receptors 
(VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) thereby inhibiting the process of angiogenesis in tumours. 
2.2.2.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
CT-P16  is  produced  and  release  tested  at  Celltrion  Plant  II  Korea.  The  process  setup  is  a  standard 
monoclonal technology. Upstream process consists of several cell expansion steps, harvest, clarification 
and  finally  filtration.  In  the  downstream  process  the  clarified  harvest  is  purified  using  a  series  of 
purification  steps.  Purification  includes  virus  inactivation  and  removal  steps  (low-pH  hold  and 
nanofiltration) and final filtration. 
Information on the source of the cell substrate and analysis of the expression construct used to develop 
the Master Cell Bank is described in satisfactory detail. Chinese hamster cells were used to generate the 
transfected cell line. Selection process of production cell line is described adequately. A common two-
tiered cell banking system consisting of a Master Cell Bank (MCB) and Working Cell Bank (WCB), is used. 
Overall, the cell banking system, including characterisation and testing is adequately described.  
Critical  parameters 
include  AS-related  attributes,  process/material-related 
impurities,  general 
requirements  and  formulation-related  attributes.  Relevant  process  parameters  are  set  to  control  the 
manufacturing process. Process characterisation and validation studies support the established process 
parameters.  
Process  validation  studies  were  performed  at  commercial  scale.  Overall,  there  were  no  batch  failure 
during validation, and all AS results met acceptance criteria. Some deviations were observed during the 
process  validation  studies.  In  general,  observed  deviations  are  adequately  discussed  and  relevant 
adjustments were applied.  
Characterisation  studies  were  performed  using  several  batches  of  AS  manufactured using  the  current 
process and several lots of finished product (FP) manufactured using AS from the current process. The 
characterisation studies include determination of primary and higher order structure, charge variants, 
N-linked  glycans,  purity,  and  biological  activity.  Overall,  the  performed  characterisation  studies  are 
considered relevant and cover a wide variety of physicochemical and biological characterisation studies. 
Justification of the identification and classification of the product-related impurities can be agreed. 
The development of the manufacturing process and the comparability studies conducted were adequately 
described. Generally, comparability assessment covers all necessary tests to conclude the similarity of 
the  AS  before  and  after  the  manufacturing  changes  between  earlier  processes  and  current  one. 
Description of changes and reasons for changes (justification) with respect to the impact on quality was 
provided and is acceptable. 
2.2.2.3.  Specification 
The release specification includes tests for general attributes, microbial, identity, glycosylation, purity 
and impurities, content, and potency. 
Overall, the proposed test parameters are considered relevant and cover variety of physicochemical test 
methods and one parameter for biological activity. The proposed acceptance criteria are agreeable. 
The  stability  specification  test  items  are  identical  to  that  employed  at  release  with  the  exception  of 
parameters, for which no change is expected; this is acceptable.

Analytical methods were sufficiently described including system suitability testing and assay acceptance 
criteria of the methods and listing of key materials and equipment. Qualification of used standards and 
antigen for HCP and residual host cell DNA was described in section S.5. Representative chromatograms 
were provided for relevant methods. The Validation for the used analytical methods has been adequately 
performed.  
The reference standards used during the product development and for routine batch release use, have 
been  adequately  described.  A  two-tiered  reference  standard  system  is  used  for  commercial 
manufacturing including primary reference standard (PRS) and working reference standards (WRS). The 
WRS  is  used  for  routine  lot  release  and  stability  testing,  as  well  as  other  quality  activities  such  as 
investigations and method transfers/validation. 
The  active  substance  is  filled  into  pre-sterilised,  pyrogen  free  polycarbonate  bottles.  Representative 
certificates of analysis provided by the vendor are provided. The CHMP made a recommendation (REC) 
to the applicant to submit the final report for the leachables studies for the active substance container 
closure in H1/2026. In summary, the container closure system is considered suitable. 
2.2.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data at long-term (-40 ± 5°C), intermediate (5 ± 3ºC) and at accelerated (25 ± 2ºC / 60 ± 5% 
RH)  stability  conditions  was  provided.  All  stability  batches  were  manufactured  at  CELLTRION  Plant  II 
(CLT2)  at  commercial  batch  scale.  Batches  manufactured  by  the  previous  process  were  used  to 
manufacture  product  for  clinical  studies.  For  these  batches,  real-time  stability  data  is  completed  and 
available  for  60  months  at  long-term  conditions,  12  months  at  intermediate  conditions  and  for 
accelerated  conditions  for  6  months.  Stability  data  for  batches  manufactured  with  the  commercial 
process  is  available  for  12  months  at  long-term  conditions.  For  studies  under  intermediate  and 
accelerated conditions (study completed), 12 months and 6 months data is available, respectively. In 
addition, photostability study results for one batch (commercial process) were provided. Shelf-life of 60 
months at −40±5°C is being proposed. 
Long-term  stability  results  demonstrate  that  all  quality  attributes  studied  were  within  the  acceptance 
criteria through 60 months for all clinical lots with minor exception; all long-term results available for 
the current process batches (i.e. up to 12 months) comply as well. Intermediate stability study results 
comply  with  specifications  and  are  completed  for  batches  manufactured  with  the  current  process. 
Accelerated stability study results revealed a downward trend and OOS results in some parameters and 
an upward trend others. 
The applicant has conducted photostability studies and concluded, that the AS should be protected from 
light as changes in some quality attributes were observed in the AS when stored without light protection. 
Overall, the provided stability data support the proposed shelf-life for the AS packaged in the proposed 
container closure (polycarbonate bottles) and stored at the recommended storage condition. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.2.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The  finished  product  is  a  sterile  liquid  solution  containing  400  mg  or  100  mg  of  bevacizumab  active 
substance. Each vial is designed to deliver a single dose of 400 mg or 100 mg active ingredient in 16 mL 
or 4 mL of solution at a nominal concentration of 25.0 mg/mL. The finished product contains the active

substance  (bevacizumab),  di-sodium  hydrogen  phosphate,  anhydrous,  sodium  dihydrogen  phosphate 
monohydrate, α, α - trehalose, dihydrate, polysorbate 20, and water for injection. 
The  development  strategy  of  Vegzelma  focused  on  developing  a  similar  biological  medicinal  product 
comparable to EU-approved reference product Avastin. To this end, the CT-P16 formulation used in non-
clinical,  clinical  development  and  commercial  supply  are  identical  to  that  of  Avastin  with  respect  to 
pharmaceutical form, concentration and composition.  
Since the CT-P16 formulation is identical to the reference product, the applicant performed only limited 
qualitative  and  quantitative  formulation  studies,  the  purpose  of  which  was  to  demonstrate  that  the 
formulation is robust in terms of product stability and quality, and comparable with the reference product. 
Five formulation parameters were varied as part of this study. The two presentations are comparable 
and representative of one another in that the AS and formulated bulk product used to make the finished 
product is identical for the two presentations. 
An extensive characterisation of CT-P16 was conducted including physicochemical and biological analysis. 
The  results  show  that  CT-P16  AS  and  FP  have  the  expected  primary,  secondary  and  higher  order 
structure of bevacizumab, acceptable levels of protein content and purity, and the biological activities 
expected  of  bevacizumab.  The  physicochemical  and  biological  comparability  program  undertaken 
indicate that CT-P16 AS and FP are comparable with respect to primary structure and post-translational 
modifications;  charge  variants;  glycation  /  glycosylation;  purity;  higher-order  structure;  content  and 
biological activities as confirmed using a number of orthogonal techniques.  
Based on the results of EU approved (and US-licensed) reference product Avastin 100 mg, an overfill is 
applied during filling of the 100 mg presentation into vials to ensure similarity in protein content and 
extractable volume. Similarly, based on the results of the 400 mg Avastin, an overfill is applied during 
filling of the 400 mg presentation into vials to ensure similarity of protein content and extractable volume.  
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process development has been described in sufficient detail. The production scale, 
manufacturing  site  and  details  of  the  material  usage  from  each  facility  were  adequately  presented. 
Changes  were  introduced  to  the  manufacturing  process  for  process  validation  of  the  commercial 
manufacture  of  both  400  mg  and  100  mg  presentations  with  modification  of  in-process  controls.  To 
demonstrate  that  the  change  in  scale  of  manufacture  of  CT-P16  finished  product  has  not  adversely 
impacted product quality, an extensive comparability study has been performed between processes. In 
addition, during CT-P16 development, changes to the FP manufacturing process for CT-P16 100 mg and 
CT-P16 400 mg presentations were introduced. A summary of the comparability studies undertaken was 
provided  and  sufficiently  demonstrated  the  comparability  of  each  product  presentation  manufactured 
with the previous and current process.  
Container closure system  
The primary container closure system for CT-P16 finished product is composed of a type I borosilicate 
glass  vial,  a  rubber  stopper  and  a  cap.  Each  CT-P16  finished product  vial  is packed  individually  in  an 
outer  carton  box  to  prevent  exposure  to  UV  light  and  to  protect  the  vial  from  any  potential  physical 
damage during handling, shipping, and storage.  
The  glass  vials  and  rubber  stoppers  comply  with  the  appropriate  Ph.  Eur.  monographs  for  primary 
containers and closures.  
Results of the leachable studies for vial and stopper indicate that no leachables of toxicological concern 
are present, which is compatible with vial and stopper. The leachable study will be continued. The vials 
used for CT-P16 400 mg and 100 mg presentations are manufactured with same type glass vial and the 
stoppers used are identical. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636045/2022  
Page 17/109 
 
 
 
The CHMP recommended that the leachables study should be continued up to the end of shelf-life. The 
final study report of the leachables study should be submitted by July of 2026. Furthermore, the Agency 
should be informed in the event that any compound of toxicological concern is identified in the study at 
5 ± 3°C prior to 48 months (REC). 
2.2.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Finished product manufacture is performed at CELLTRION, Inc., Plant II (CLT2), 20 Academy-ro 51 beon-
gil, Yeonsu-gu, Incheon, 22014, Republic of Korea.  
Three sites are responsible for the physical importation and batch release of the FP to Europe: Millmount 
Healthcare Ltd., Block 7, City North Business Campus, Stamullen, Co. Meath K32 YD60, Ireland; Nuvisan 
GmbH, Wegenerstraße 13, 89231 Neu Ulm, Germany and Nuvisan France SARL, 2400, Route des Colles 
06410, Sophia Antipolis, France. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  brief  description  and  a  flow  chart  of  the  manufacturing  process.  The 
400 mg/16 mL  and  100 mg/4 mL  (both  25  mg/mL)  presentations  are  manufactured  using  the  same 
process steps and controls. The only differences between the presentations are the fill volume. All other 
manufacturing steps and process parameters are the same. The manufacturing process is described with 
sufficient details.  
Appropriate critical process steps and IPCs are described in the dossier. The commercial manufacturing 
process  has  been  validated.  Validation  of  the  finished  product  manufacturing  process  included 
consecutive  performance  qualifications  lots;  covering  both  presentations.  The  validation  lots  met  the 
proposed  release  specifications.  Sufficient  information  is  provided  on  media  fills,  filter  validation  and 
shipping validation 
The  data  gathered  during  the  FP  process  validation  show  that  the  manufacturing  process  of  CT-P16 
meets the predetermined quality characteristics and the process validation is acceptable. Moreover, the 
defined  set  of  process  parameters  have  been  shown  to  be  suitable  for  monitoring  the  manufacturing 
process. In addition, ranges and values chosen for the processing parameters are acceptable to support 
the commercial manufacture of the product. 
2.2.3.3.  Product specification 
The specification for the finished product, include tests for general attributes, microbial safety, identity, 
purity and impurities, SEC, content, potency. 
The methodology for preparation of the specification was in compliance with ICH Q6B. the specification 
includes the critical quality attributes (CQA) of the product that can affect the safety and efficacy of the 
finished product and defines the acceptable range of the physicochemical and biological characteristics 
of the FP. The specification was established based on development data, a reasonable range of expected 
analytical  and  manufacturing  variability,  and  reference  information  including  literature,  regulatory 
guidelines,  and  pharmacopoeial  limits.  The  initially  proposed  acceptance  criteria  groups  of  charge 
variants  and  total  aggregates  have  been  revised  in  line  with  those  proposed  for  the  AS.  Shelf-life 
specifications  have  been  adapted  accordingly.  In  addition,  as  a  proposed  biosimilar  product  to  EU-
approved  Avastin,  the  acceptance  criteria  also  consider  the  quality  range  of  reference  product  where 
appropriate. Overall the specifications limits have been appropriately justified and are acceptable. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk assessment and 
elemental analysis results of three batches, it is confirmed that elemental impurities are within the limits 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636045/2022  
Page 18/109 
 
 
 
set out in ICH Q3D and that testing for elemental impurities does not need to be included in the finished 
product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A  risk  evaluation  concerning  the  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  finished  product  has  been 
performed  (as  requested)  in  line  with  the  “Questions  and  answers  for  marketing  authorisation 
holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on 
nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- 
Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal 
products”  (EMA/369136/2020).  Based  on  the  information  provided  it  is  accepted  that  no  risk  was 
identified  on  the  possible  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  active  substance  or  the  related 
finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods chosen to monitor the CT-P16 FP’s identity, purity, potency and quantity have 
been  demonstrated  to  be  suitable  for  their  intended  purpose.  Both  compendial  and  non-compendial 
methods have been adequately validated. Detailed information on the current and previous reference 
standard lots has been provided and discussed previously in the respective AS section in this report. 
The batch analysis data presented derived from several lots of CT-P16 400 mg and several lots of CT-
P16 100 mg manufactured throughout development. Data was obtained from testing according to the 
development specifications in place at the time of batch release. The changes made to analytical methods 
and acceptance criteria during development of CT-P16 FP were described in the dossier.  
Batch analysis data also included commercial scale batches used for process validation, characterisation 
studies,  comparability  studies,  stability  studies,  similarity  studies,  justification  of  specification.  All 
batches met the acceptance criteria in place at the time of release. The results demonstrate consistency 
of the manufacturing process capabilities.  
2.2.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability  studies  have  been  conducted  on  both  presentations  400  mg  and  100  mg.  The  studies  were 
conducted in accordance with the guidance provided in ICH Q5C Quality of Biotechnological Products: 
Stability Testing of Biotechnological/Biological Products and ICH Q1A (R2) Stability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. The proposed storage condition for Vegzelma is 5 ± 3°C. 
Long-term stability data at 5 ± 3°C has been presented for batches for each presentation manufactured 
with either the previous or the current process for up to 48 months for the 400 mg and up to 24 months 
for the 100 mg presentation.  
The panel of stability indicating methods applied provides assurance that potential changes in the purity, 
content and potency will be detected. No trends were observed and all the batches met the acceptance 
criteria at all timepoints at the long-term storage condition. Assignment of the shelf life is based on real 
time stability data (400 mg/16 mL 48 months, 100 mg/4 mL 24 months). 
In addition, the same 400 mg batches were subjected to accelerated stability study (25 ± 2°C / 60 ± 
5% RH), and stress stability study (40 ± 2°C / 75 ± 5% RH). Dilution for infusion stability study (5 ± 
3°C and 30 ± 2°C / 75 ± 5% RH),  and confirmatory photostability study (1,200,000 Lux hr Vis. and 
200 Whr/m2 UV) were performed for each presentations; positioning study was conducted on 400 mg 
batch.  
The proposed shelf-life for diluted product in 100 mL polyolefin (PP and PE) bag containing 0.9% sodium 
chloride  is  60  days  at  5 ± 3ºC  and  subsequently  for  7  days  at  30  ±  2°C  /  75  ±  5%  RH,  which  is 
acceptable. The finished product is light sensitive, but sufficiently protected by the outer packaging.

Finally,  a  forced  degradation  study  was  performed  to  characterise  and  understand  the  processes  and 
pathways associated with degradation. This study was also conducted to evaluate the similarity of the 
degradation  pathways  of  Vegzelma  and  EU-approved  Avastin.  Comparative  stability  testing  was  also 
performed  with  several  US-licensed  Avastin  and  several  EU-approved  Avastin  under  accelerated  and 
stress conditions. 
The post-approval stability protocol and the stability commitment has been provided and are considered 
acceptable. 
Taken  together,  the  presented  stability  data  sufficiently  support  the  proposed  shelf-life  of  2 years 
(100 mg / 4 mL) and 4 years (400 mg / 16 mL) for the unopened vial at the intended storage conditions 
(i.e. 2-8°C, protected from light) as per SmPC sections 6.3 and 6.4.  
2.2.3.5.  Biosimilarity 
A comprehensive similarity exercise following the general principles outlined in the guideline on similar 
biological  medicinal  products  containing  biotechnology-derived  proteins  as  active  substance;  Quality 
issues  (EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012)  has  been  performed.  Several  independent  CT-P16  FP  batches 
representative of the commercial scale and several EU-approved Avastin batches were included in the 
similarity study. The batches reflected a range of expiration dates and product ages. The FP material 
used in the analytical biosimilarity studies is considered representative of the material used in clinical 
trials.  
The  similarity  ranges  were  established  for  quantitative  key  quality  parameters  using  data  from 
EU-approved Avastin batches. For key biological quality attributes, a ±3*SD quality range was set by 
analysis of EU-approved Avastin batches. Results of physicochemical analyses were presented without 
statistical analysis; instead the mean and SD as well as the spread of the underlying distribution from 
quantitative analyses have been compared and differences have been highlighted and discussed. Since 
tabular and graphical presentation allows for a clear comparison of CT-P16 to the RMP, this is considered 
acceptable.  In  addition,  generally  sufficient  raw  data  has  been  provided  to  allow  assessment  of 
biosimilarity independently of statistical approach chosen. The overall approaches used for establishment 
of the biosimilarity assessment criteria are considered acceptable. 
The  comparative  testing  included  analysis  of  primary  structure  and  post-translational  modifications, 
biological  activity,  glycation  and  glycosylation,  charge  heterogeneity,  purity/impurity,  disulfide  bonds, 
higher  order  structures,  content,  and  comparative  forced  degradation  studies  of  CT-P16  and 
EU-approved Avastin. Appropriate analytical methods have been utilised to ensure an understanding of 
the EU-approved Avastin product profile and the CT-P16 product developed. 
A summary of the results including a critical evaluation of biosimilarity is presented in Table 1.

The  same  disulphide bond  linkages  in CT-P16  and 
EU-approved Avastin has been demonstrated. 
Minor  differences  were  noted  in  the  level  of  free 
thiol groups as compared to EU-approved Avastin. 
CT-P16 and EU-approved Avastin are similar in their 
protein concentration.  
The icIEF electropherograms show a similar pattern 
in  all  samples.  Any  detected  difference  are 
considered unlikely to be clinically significant. 
Minor  differences  between  CT-P16  and  EU-
approved  Avastin  were  noted  in  the  relative 
proportion of the charge variants. However, based 
on the characterisation results presented, it can be 
concluded  that  the  slight  differences  observed  in 
charge variant profiles are clinically insignificant. All 
variants  are  biologically  active.  The  applicant  has 
appropriately discussed and justified the differences 
detected  in  CT-P16  and  EU-approved  Avastin  to 
support the similarity. 
Glycation and

CT-P16  was  shown  to  have  minor  differences  in

highly unlikely to be of clinical relevance.

SEC-MALLS  analysis  indicated  that  the  molecular 
weights of the monomer and HMW forms in CT-P16 
and EU-approved Avastin were similar and that the 
HMW forms of both products consist predominantly 
of dimers.  
Non-glycosylated  HC  in  CT-P16  and  EU-approved 
Avastin had a similar impact on biological activity. 
Any  observed  differences  are  not  considered 
clinically relevant.This conclusion is also supported 
by similar biological activities of the two products. 
CT-P16 and EU-approved Avastin are highly similar 
in their inhibition of cell proliferation and binding to 
VEGF-A. The descriptions and qualification data that 
have been provided for the analytical methods used 
for  the  analytical  comparability  exercise  are 
considered sufficient. 
Any observed differences are unlikely to be clinically 
meaningful.  
The lack of effector functions was demonstrated in 
CT-P16  and  EU-approved  Avastin  batches.  In 
addition,  CT-P16  and  EU-approved  Avastin  were

In conclusion, analytical similarity between Vegzelma and EU-approved Avastin has been demonstrated 
satisfactorily.

2.2.3.7.  Adventitious agents 
The approach for adventitious agents testing was described. The MCB and WCB testing is reviewed as 
part of the AS control, as well as the control of raw materials. The results of viral testing performed as 
part  of  cell  line  qualification  demonstrate  that  CT-P16.  MCB  and  WCB  are  free  of  adventitious  and 
endogenous viral agents. These results also indicate that no viral contamination occurred during cell line 
development and cell banking MCB and WCB testing is reviewed as part of the AS control, as well as the 
control of raw materials.  
Viral clearance studies were performed with a suitable panel of model viruses on qualified small-scale 
models.  Overall,  the  virus  clearance  studies  are  adequate.  The  original  study  reports  of  the  virus 
clearance studies have been provided. The virus assays are sufficiently described in the original reports. 
A brief description of the qPCR assay for quantitation of MVM has been provided by the applicant. The 
safety margin over the estimated retroviral burden per Retrovirus-like particles in unprocessed bulk is 
considered satisfactory. 
The TSE risk associated with the raw materials used during the development of the production cell line 
has been presented in the dossier. No materials of animal origin are used during manufacture of the FP. 
On the basis of presented information, it can be concluded that there is minimal risk of contamination 
by TSE in the final product. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The data provided support biosimilarity versus the EU reference 
medicinal product (Avastin) at the quality level. No major objections have been raised concerning the 
AS  and  FP.  The  available  quality  data  support  biosimilarity  versus  EU-approved  Avastin.  The  risk  for 
adventitious agents is adequately controlled. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were two minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on 
the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to the below aspect and are put forward and agreed 
as recommendations for future quality development: 
-updated  leachable  studies  data  should  be  provided  and  the  final  study  results  submitted  upon 
completion of the studies for the both the AS and the FP. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The submitted nonclinical program is adequate for a biosimilar, and includes a battery of comparative in 
vitro  primary  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  studies  (same  as  included  under  the  biosimilarity  studies)  of 
CT-P16 and the Reference Medicinal Product EU-Avastin, and a repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus 
monkeys including toxicokinetic (TK) and immunogenicity assessment.  
The data from a 2-way similarity assessments from a battery of state of the art receptor-binding studies 
and cell-based assays, and the analytical methods employed were included. Therefore, in order to avoid 
redundancy, thorough discussions of functional biosimilarity and adequacy of the methods employed are 
included under Quality/biosimilarity section, and are only shortly summarised under nonclinical aspects.

In vitro studies were conducted using the drug product (DP) manufactured with the proposed commercial 
manufacturing process. The toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys was conducted with CT-P16 DP lot 
16P12B01 manufactured from Process A drug substance (DS). The comparability studies for both the DS 
(Process  A)  and  the  PD  from  commercial  manufacturing  process  demonstrated  that  process  changes 
have not had an adverse impact on the product quality. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
2.3.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The  in  vitro  functional  assays  covered  all  the  relevant  modes  of  action  claimed  in  the  indications  for 
bevacizumab. Comparisons included lots used in the clinical studies. Ten lots of CT-P16 and EU-Avastin 
including  lots  used  in  the  comparative  clinical  studies  were  analysed  in  main  biological  similarity 
assessments. Statistical analysis using a quality range approach set based on the variation of the RMP 
values,  expressed  as  ±  3*SD,  was  conducted.  The  data  was  considered  similar  where  ≥90%  of  data 
points were within the quality range of EU-Avastin. 
CT-P16 and EU-Avastin had similar binding activity to the main target VEGF-A165, and to VEGF-A121, 
VEGF-A145,  VEGF-A189  and  VEGF-A206  isoforms  and  had  similar  biological  activity  in  inhibition  of 
proliferation  of  human  umbilical  vein  endothelial  cells  and  VEGFR2  receptor  tyrosine  kinase 
autophosphorylation.  CT-P16  was  similar  to  EU-Avastin  in  binding  to  FcRn  C1q,  FcγRIIIa  (V  and  F 
variants), FcγRIIIb, FcγRIIa and FcγRIIb. Binding to FcγRI differed (50% of CT-P16 samples were within 
the  quality  range  of  EU-Avastin).  Lack  of  triggering  ADCC  in  PBMNCs  and  CDC  in  SKOV-3  cells  was 
demonstrated for CT-P16 and EU-Avastin. No binding was observed to VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-
E, PlGF-1 and PlGF-2. 
2.3.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacology studies were performed and are not required. 
2.3.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
No separate safety pharmacology studies were performed and are not required. 
2.3.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacology drug interaction studies were performed and are not required. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The comparative toxicokinetic analysis were performed as part of repeat-dose toxicity study for CT-P16 
and EU-Avastin in cynomolgus monkeys using two doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg. Analytical methods were 
adequately  validated  for  quantification  of  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  and  anti-CT-P16  and  anti-Avastin 
antibodies in cynomolgus monkey serum, and for formulation analysis of CT-P16 and EU-Avastin.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
2.3.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies were conducted and are not required. 
2.3.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
A  GLP-compliant  4-week  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  (no  8342524)  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  with 
toxicokinetic assessment was conducted with CT-P16 (lot 16P12B01) and EU-Avastin. Doses of 10 mg/kg 
and 50 mg/kg were administered via intravenous (IV) bolus twice a week (in total of eight doses) to 
provide sufficient systemic exposure as determined based on exposure information in previous studies 
with the EU-Avastin.  
The experimental setup of this study is summarised in the table below: 
Table 2. Study design for 4-week Repeat-Dose Toxicity Study in Cynomolgus Monkeys 
No  test-article-related  mortality  or  effects  on  vital  signs,  ophthalmic  parameters,  blood  pressure, 
immunophenotyping, organ weight, growth plate evaluation and anatomic pathology were noted.  CT-
P16 and Avastin were well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys up to 50 mg/kg/d when administered for 4 
weeks.  
Only minor test-article related effects were noted, e.g. an increased incidence of fecal abnormalities and 
differences in ECG values. Statistically significant, but not dose-related, higher mean PR intervals were 
noted in males administered CT-P16 or EU-Avastin compared with control males. These changes were 
considered incidental, and did not differ significantly between CT-P16 administered cynomolgus monkeys 
compared  to  EU-Avastin.  Overall,  no  significant  changes  attributed  to  CT-P16  or  EU-Avastin  was 
observed in PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, QTc interval, RR interval or heart rate. 
Also  some  differences  between  monkeys  that  were  administered  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  were 
recognised: the significance of conduction delay abnormalities (incomplete right bundle branch block) 
exclusively noted in two monkeys of the highest CT-P16 group is unknown, but considered a background 
finding, and is thus not thought to raise a toxicological concern. At 50 mg/kg/bw, neutrophils and white 
blood cell counts were frequently increased in monkeys that were administered CT-P16,  whereas this 
was  not  the  case  with  monkeys  from  EU-Avastin  groups.  The  observed  increases  were  frequently

statistically significant. However, this was only observed after the 2nd day of dosing, later on this was 
not observed any more. Therefore, this observation is considered a chance finding. 
2.3.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity or mutagenicity studies were performed, and are not required. 
2.3.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were performed, and are not required. 
2.3.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No reproductive and developmental studies were performed, and are not required. 
2.3.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Blood samples were taken pre-dose, and at approximately 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 (Day 26 only), 72, 
and 96 (Day 1 only) hours post-dose. For immunogenicity analysis of anti-CT-P16 and anti-EU-Avastin 
antibodies, blood samples were taken once during the pre-dose phase, approximately 96 hours post the 
Day  1  dose  (prior  to  dosing  on  day  5),  and  approximately  72  hour  post  the  Day  26  dose  (prior  to 
necropsy). The amount of CT-P16 or EU-Avastin and anti-drug antibodies in serum were quantified with 
validated analytical methods. The LLoQ for the serum concentration of CT-P16 and EU-Avastin was 10 
ng/mL.  
Exposure to bevacizumab increased with the increase in CT-P16 and EU-Avastin dose levels from 10 to 
50 mg/kg/day. The increases in mean bevacizumab Cmax and AUC0-72h values for both CT-P16 and EU-
Avastin were generally dose proportional. Sex differences in concentrations were less than 2-fold.  
The relative values (CT-P16/EU-Avastin) for Cmax and AUC0-72h for 10 mg/kg/day dose were 104% and 
106% on Day 1, respectively, and 110% and 105% on Day 26, respectively. For dose 50 mg/kg/day, 
the  relative  values  were  101%  and  102%  on  Day  1,  respectively,  and  98%  and  110%  on  Day  26, 
respectively. Bevacizumab exposures were similar for CT-P16 and EU-Avastin. 
The mean time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) value of CT-P16 was 0.83 hours on Day 1 and 
2.67 hours on Day 26 for both 10 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day, and of EU-Avastin was 0.92 hours and 
3.58 hours for 10 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively, on Day 1 and 3.42 hours and 1.17 hours 
for 10 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively, on Day 26. 
No anti-drug antibodies were detected in blood samples collected. 
2.3.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
Macroscopic observation and histopathological assessments of local (injection site) tolerance were 
performed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. There were no toxicologically significant differences in 
injection site findings between control animals and the animals administered CT-P16 or EU-Avastin. 
2.3.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
No other toxicity studies were conducted, and are not required. 
Assessment report

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An ERA was submitted that included justification omitting the specific ERA studies (CT-P16 belongs to 
proteins  (is  a  monoclonal  antibody),  which  do  not  require  specific  ERA  studies).  The  use  of  CT-P16 
(bevacizumab) is not considered to produce risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The submitted nonclinical program is adequate for the development of a CT-P16 biosimilar, and includes 
a battery of comparative in vitro functional studies of CT-P16 and EU-Avastin, and a repeat-dose toxicity 
study in cynomolgus monkeys including toxicokinetic and immunogenicity assessment.  
The in vitro functional studies demonstrated that CT-P16 and EU-Avastin were similar in their biological 
activity, i.e. in binding activity to the main target VEGF-A165, and to other soluble or membrane-bound 
VEGF-A isoforms, in inhibition of proliferation of endothelial cells and VEGFR2 autophosphorylation, and 
binding to Fcγ-receptors, FcRn and C1q. Of all the biological activity analyses conducted, the binding to 
FcγRI differed (50% of CT-P16 samples being within the quality range of EU-Avastin). Nevertheless, it 
was  justified  that  although  FcγRI  is  known  to  trigger  weak  ADCC  or  ADCP,  the  therapeutic  effect  of 
bevacizumab  is  not  mediated  by  Fc-functions.  Therefore,  this  finding  is  unlikely  to  be  clinically 
meaningful. This justification is accepted. Moreover, the lack of triggering ADCC in PBMNCs and CDC in 
SKOV-3 cells was demonstrated for both, for CT-P16 and EU-Avastin. CT-P16 had similar specificity with 
EU-Avastin in lack of binding to other VEGF isoforms than VEGF-A or PlGF. 
In  conclusion,  the  2-way  similarity  assessment  data  from  the  receptor-binding  and  cell-based  assays 
demonstrate the similar functional activity of CT-P16 and EU-Avastin. 
CT-P16 and EU-Avastin were well tolerated at dose levels up to maximum dose used, 50 mg/kg/day in 
cynomolgus  monkeys.  No  treatment-related  findings  were  noted  with  exception  of  minor  changes  (in 
increased  incidence,  fecal  abnormalities  and  in  ECG  measurements,  and  increases  of  neutrophil  and 
white  blood  cell  counts).  There  were  no  toxicologically  significant  differences  between  CT-P16  or 
EU-Avastin group animals, including the injection site findings. The results of the study in cynomolgus 
monkeys  did  not  reveal  notable  differences  in  effects  between  the  CT-P16  and  Avastin  in  their 
toxicological profiles. 
Exposures (Cmax and AUC0-72h) to CT-P16 and EU-Avastin increased dose-proportionally, and were similar 
for CT-P16 and EU-Avastin. Sex differences in concentrations were less than 2-fold. The relative values 
(CT-P16/EU-Avastin)  for  Cmax  and  AUC0-72h  for  10  mg/kg/day  dose  were  104%  and  106%  on  Day  1, 
respectively, and 110% and 105% on Day 26, respectively. For the dose of 50 mg/kg/day, the relative 
values were 101% and 102% on Day 1, respectively, and 98% and 110% on Day 26, respectively.  
CT-P16 or EU-Avastin did not trigger formation of anti-drug antibodies. 
The  active  substance  is  a  natural  substance,  the  use  of  which  will  not  alter  the  concentration  or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, CT-P16 (bevacizumab) is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The 2-way similarity assessment data from the receptor-binding and cell-based assays support the 
similar functional activity of CT-P16 and EU-Avastin. Based on the functional activity analysis, CT-P16 
and EU-Avastin can be expected to have the same efficacy in vitro, PK profile, and similar lack of Fc 
receptor mediated effector functions (ADCC, CDC).

2.4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
CT-P16 (international non-proprietary name bevacizumab; the proposed name Vegzelma) is developed 
as a proposed biosimilar medicinal product to Avastin®. 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity of CT-P16 has been investigated in the following three studies: 
  Study CT-P16 1.1 (pivotal PK study): A phase 1, randomized, double-blind, 3-arm, parallel 
group, single-dose study to compare the PK and safety of three formulations of bevacizumab 
(CT-P16, EU-Avastin and US-Avastin) in healthy male subjects. This study provides pivotal PK 
outcomes to demonstrate bioequivalence between CT-P16, EU-Avastin, and US-Avastin. 
  Study  CT-P16  1.2  (supportive  Japanese  PK  study):  A  phase  1,  randomized,  double-blind, 
parallel group, single-dose study to compare the PK and safety of CT-P16 and EU-Avastin in 
healthy Japanese male subjects. This study was conducted to support approval of CT-P16 in 
Japan. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636045/2022  
Page 30/109 
 
 
 
 
  Study  CT-P16  3.1  (comparative  efficacy  and  safety  study):  A  phase  3,  double-blind, 
randomized, active-controlled, parallel group study to compare efficacy and safety of CT-P16 
and EU-Avastin as first-line treatment for metastatic or recurrent nsNSCLC. This study provides 
comparative PK data (trough serum concentrations [Ctrough] following repeated IV infusion) and 
long-term immunogenicity. 
Analytical methods 
Quantification of CT-P16 and bevacizumab in human serum  
A MSD-ECL based method was used in the pharmacokinetics studies to quantify CT-P16 and bevacizumab 
(EU-Avastin and US-Avastin) concentrations in healthy human serum (clinical study CT-P16 1.2) and in 
human  serum  samples  from  the  patients  with  nsNSCLC  (clinical  study  CT-P16  3.1).  An  ELISA  based 
method  was  used  for  the  quantification  of  CT-P16  and  bevacizumab  (EU-Avastin  and  US-Avastin) 
concentrations in healthy human serum samples collected in the clinical study CT-P16 1.1. Both methods 
were, in principle, validated according to ICH M10 Bioanalytical method validation guideline. 
Detection of ADA and NAb in human serum 
A three-tiered approach comprising of screening, confirmation and titer was used for detection of anti-
drug antibodies. Two ECL based methods (validated either by PPD laboratory or BDS) were utilised for 
the detection of ADAs against CT-P16 and bevacizumab (EU-Avastin and US-Avastin) and two ECL based 
methods  (validated  either  by  PPD  laboratory  or  BDS)  were  utilised  for  the  detection  of  NAbs  against 
CT-P16  and  bevacizumab  (EU-Avastin  and  US-Avastin)  in  healthy  and  diseased  human  serum.  In 
general, the method validation followed current guidance. 
Clinical pivotal PK study in healthy Asian male subjects (study Ct-P16 1.1) 
The study was conducted at three centres in Republic of Korea between 01st Aug 2017 and 17th Jan 2018. 
The bioanalytical analyses were performed at Biologics Development Services, LLC US between 9th Oct 
2017 and 28th Mar 2018. 
The study was a phase I, randomised (the number of subjects with body weight < 70 kg and ≥ 70 kg 
was balanced among the 3 treatment groups), double-blind, 3-arm, parallel group, single-dose study in 
adult  healthy  Asian  male  subjects.  Subjects  received  single  dose  (i.e.  5  mg  /kg)  of  either  CT-P16, 
EU-Avastin or US-Avastin by IV infusion for 90 minutes (± 5 minutes) on Day 1. Blood samples were 
collected for measurement of serum concentrations of bevacizumab from all subjects at the following 
time points: pre-dose, immediately end-of-infusion (EOI), 1 h after EOI, 4 h after start of infusion (SOI), 
8 h after SOI and 12 h after SOI, days 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85 and 99. 
PK results: 
The PK population consisted of 141 subjects (n = 46 in CT-P16 group, n =47 in the EU-Avastin group 
and n = 48 in the US-Avastin group).  
Mean serum concentrations were similar between CT-P16, EU-Avastin and US-Avastin treatment groups 
(see Figure 1 below).

Overall,  the  secondary  PK  endpoints  (Tmax,  Vz,  λz,  t½,  CL  and  %AUCext)  were  similar  among  the 
3 treatment groups. 
Supportive PK study in Japanese subjects (study CT-P16 1.2) 
This study was conducted at one centre Anaheim Clinical Trials, LLC USA between 31st Jul and 22nd Dec 
2020. Bioanalytical analyses were performed at PPD® Bioanalytical Lab USA between 29th Oct 2020 and 
28th Jan 2021.  
This study was a phase I, a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, parallel group, prospective single-
dose  study.  Subjects  received  a  single  IV  infusion  (5  mg/kg;  90  minutes  ±5  minutes)  of  CT-P16  or 
EU-Avastin according to the randomly assigned treatment groups on Day 1. Blood samples were collected 
for measurement of serum concentrations of bevacizumab from all subjects at the following time points: 
pre-dose, immediately end-of-infusion (EOI), 1 h after EOI, 4 h after start of infusion (SOI), 8 h after 
SOI and 12 h after SOI, days 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85 and 99. 
PK results 
The PK population consisted of 45 subjects (n = 22 subjects in the CT-P16 group and n = 23 subjects in 
the EU-Avastin group). 
The  90%  CIs  of  ratios  of  geometric  LS  means  of  Cmax,  AUC0-last,  and  AUC0-inf were  entirely  contained 
within the predefined equivalence margin of 80% to 125% which indicated that bevacizumab exposures 
from CT-P16 were similar to those from EU-Avastin (see Table 6).

Table 6. Statistical analysis of primary PK parameters (ANCOVA) in study CT-P16 1.2 
(PK population) 
A statistical outlier was identified using the IQR method and robust regression method, which resulted 
in the detection of an unusual Cmax value in one subject in the EU-Avastin group. Therefore, a sensitivity 
analysis was performed on the primary PK endpoints with data excluding the observed outlier. It should 
also  be  noted  that  the  subject    had  an  unusual  profile  shape  that  resembled more  like  subcutaneous 
administration and not an IV administration which aligns with the outlier analysis results. 
Statistical analysis excluding the Cmax outlier value of the subject was performed and the 90% CIs of the 
%ratio of geometric LS mean were within the equivalence interval (80% to 125%) supporting the same 
outcome as in previous Table 11; i.e., no notable differences in Cmax between CT-P16 and EU-Avastin. 
Comparative efficacy and safety study in nsNSCLC patients (study CT-P16 3.1) 
The secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the PK of CT-P16 compared with EU-Avastin in 
terms of Ctrough. Patients received 15 mg/kg study drug dose every 3 weeks. 
PK samples were collected on Day 1 of each cycle (prior to the beginning of the study drug administration 
[-3 days as window were allowed]) in the induction study period, on Day 1 (-3 days as window were 
allowed) of cycle 1, and every 3 cycles (end of Cycle 3, Cycle 6, and Cycle 9, etc.) in the maintenance 
study  period  and  EOT  visit.  In  patients  whose  dose  was  delayed  from  the  planned  schedule,  serum 
samples were obtained on Day 22 of the last cycle (-3 days as window were allowed). 
PK and immunogenicity testing site: PPD Bioanalytical Laboratory, US 
PK results 
A total of 650 patients (327 patients and 323 patients in the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, 
respectively) were included in the PK population. Thirty-seven patients who did not have post-treatment 
PK results were excluded from PK population and 2 patients who received the incorrect treatment during 
the induction study period were excluded from the PK population. 
The mean (standard deviation) Ctrough at each cycle in the induction period was generally similar for the 
CT-P16 and EU-Avastin treatment groups in the PK population (see Table 7).

2.4.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Bevacizumab  binds  and  neutralises  the  biologic  activity  of  human  Vascular  Endothelial  Growth  Factor 
(VEGF). The mechanism of action (MoA) for Avastin and CT-P16 across indications is binding to soluble 
VEGF and preventing the interaction of VEGF to its receptors, Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR (VEGFR-2), on 
the surface of endothelial cells. Neutralising the biological activity of VEGF results in the regression of 
tumour vascularisation, normalisation of remaining tumour vasculature, and inhibition of the formation 
of new tumour vasculature, thereby inhibiting tumour growth. In each approved indication, the MoA of 
bevacizumab  is  to  inhibit  VEGF-induced  angiogenesis  and  vascular  permeability.  According  to  the 
applicant,  based on  an extensive  analysis  of  the  role  of  VEGF  and  VEGF  inhibition  in  each  one  of  the 
indications  for  which  licensure  is  sought,  there  is  no  evidence  to  support  claims  of  a  unique  MoA  in 
specific indications. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary  pharmacology  was  not  separately  addressed  in  the  clinical  studies.  In  terms  of  secondary 
pharmacology, the clinical studies conducted as part of the CT-P16 development programme included 
standard safety assessments such as safety laboratories and ECG recordings. These are discussed within 
section 2.4.8 on clinical safety. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Three clinical studies were performed in which the PK of CT-P16 was compared to that of EU-Avastin 
and in one study (pivotal clinical PK study CT-P16 1.1) also US-Avastin was used as a comparator 
product. In the clinical phase I studies (i.e. CT-P16 1.1 in healthy Asian male subjects and CT-P16 1.2 
in healthy Japanese male subjects), bevacizumab was administered as a single-dose of 5 mg/kg by an 
IV infusion. In the clinical phase III study (i.e. CT-P16 3.1) in nsNSCLC patients, bevacizumab was 
administered as 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks. 
Analytical methods 
In  general,  the  bioanalytical  methods  used  in  the  clinical  studies  for  CT-P16  have  been  appropriately 
described and validated according to the relevant guidelines.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636045/2022

Quantification of CT-P16 and bevacizumab concentration in human serum  
Two analytical methods including ELISA (used in clinical study CT-P16 1.1) and MSD-ECL (used in clinical 
studies CT-P16 1.2 and CT-P16 3.1) were validated according to ICH M10 Bioanalytical method validation 
guideline. In both methods CT-P16, EU-Avastin and US-Avastin seemed to perform analytical similarity 
in terms of selectivity, precision and accuracy.  
MSD-ECL based method was used in the analysis of healthy and nsNSCLC patient human serum samples. 
The usage of same analytical method for healthy and nsNSCLC samples was acceptable since the method 
demonstrated  selectivity  for  both  healthy  and  nsNSCLC  serum.  The  analysis  of  clinical  samples  was 
reliable within the given accuracy and precision ranges.  
Determination of ADA by MSD-ECL 
Two ECL based methods were used for the detection of ADAs in the healthy and nsNSCLC serum samples 
by utilizing three-tiered approach. The first ADA-assay validated by PPD Laboratory was utilised in the 
analysis of serum samples from clinical studies CT-P16 1.2 and 3.1. Screening, confirmatory and tier cut 
points were determined both in healthy and NSCLC serum in acceptable manner. The intra- and inter-
assay precisions for screening and confirmation met the acceptance criteria. No matrix interference in 
healthy  nor  nsNSCLC  serum  was  observed  and  drug  tolerance  was  acceptable.  According  to  drug 
equivalence studies the originator drug (EU-Avastin) was comparable to CT-P16. 
The second ADA-assay was used in the analysis of serum samples from clinical study CT-P16 1.1 and 
was validated by BDS. The method validation was acceptable and no further concerns are pursued for 
this method. 
Determination of NAb by using MSD-ECL  
Two ECL based methods were used for the detection of NAbs in the healthy and nsNSCLC serum samples. 
The  first  NAb-assay  validated  by  PPD  Laboratory  was  utilised  in  the  analysis  of  serum  samples  from 
clinical studies CT-P16 3.1. In general, an appropriate method validation following the current guidance 
was provided. Screening cut points and sensitivity were evaluated both in healthy and nsNSCLC serum.  
The second NAb-assay was used in the analysis of serum samples from clinical study CT-P16 1.1 and 
was  validated  by  BDS.  The  method  validation  followed  the  current  guidance  and  was  considered 
acceptable. 
Pivotal clinical PK study in healthy Asian male subjects (CT-P16 1.1.) 
The  primary  endpoints  AUC0-inf  and  AUC0-last  were  based  on  PK  samples  collected  up  to  day  99.  The 
PK sampling period was long enough to characterise the whole PK profile of bevacizumab. All subjects’ 
AUC0-last covered over 80% of AUC0-inf.  
All 90% CIs for test-to-reference/comparator of the primary PK parameters (i.e. AUC0-inf, AUC0-last and 
Cmax)  were  within  the  pre-specified  acceptance  range  of  80.00  to  125.00  (including  100.00) 
demonstrating  that  the  PK  of  the  CT-P16  is  comparable  with  the  EU-Avastin  and  US-Avastin.  In  the 
comparison  of  the  AUCs  between  EU-Avastin  and  US-Avastin,  the  90%  CIs  were  between  the  range 
80.00-125.00  but  the  range  did  not  include  100.00.  This  is,  however,  not  a  concern.  The  secondary 
PK parameters (i.e. Tmax, Vz, λz, t½, CL, %AUCext) were also comparable between studied treatments.  
4 subjects (1 subject in the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin group and 2 subjects in the US-Avastin group) were 
excluded from the PK analysis of AUC0-inf. The reason was that the interval used to determine λz was 
less than 1.5 -fold the estimated half-life. 5 subjects (1 subject in the CT-P16 group and 4 subjects in 
the US-Avastin group were excluded from the PK analysis of AUC0-last.  The reason was that the subjects 
withdrew before the last planned PK sampling time (i.e. day 99), after received full IMP. These exclusion 
criteria from the PK statistical analyses were already presented in the SAP. The applicant has conducted

sensitivity  analysis  of  the  affected  AUCs  including  the  excluded  subjects.  The  90%  CIs  of  geometric 
LS mean  ratios  were  entirely  contained  within  the  predefined  equivalence  margin  of  80.00  to  125.00 
(also  for  AUCs  between  EU-Avastin  and  US-Avastin).  The  bevacizumab  has  a  linear  PK,  so  the 
PK biosimilarity demonstrated in Asians can be extrapolated to the non-Asians. 
There were three subjects in the CT-P16 group, one subject in the EU-Avastin group and five subjects in 
the US-Avastin group, who had pre-dose bevacizumab concentrations above BLQ. Although the pre-dose 
concentrations  of  bevacizumab  were  low,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  discuss  reasons  for  the 
bevacizumab  in  pre-dose  samples.  In  the  response  to  D120  questions,  the  applicant  provided  a  very 
detailed discussion on the topic. The applicant has an opinion that the probable reason for the 9 pre-
dose bevacizumab concentrations could be low levels of non-specific binding in the wells of the assay 
plate or due to an unknown active interferent present in the serum of the subjects. The applicant also 
conducted a sensitivity analysis of primary PK parameters (i.e. Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf), excluding 
the  subjects  with  pre-treatment  measurable  concentrations  of  bevacizumab,  and  the  PK  biosimilarity 
conclusions remained unchanged.   
The applicant was asked to provide the certificates of analysis for the EU-Avastin batch B7234H13 and 
for  the  US-Avastin  batch  3115919.  In  the  response  to  D180  questions,  the  applicant  provided  the 
certificates of analysis for both reference products used in the study CT-P16 1.1. The protein contents 
were within specification limits, and highly similar between test and reference products (test CT-P16: 
25.3 mg/mL, reference EU-Avastin: 25.3 mg/mL, reference US-Avastin: 25.4 mg/mL). 
Supportive clinical PK study in healthy Japanese male subjects (CT-P16 1.2) 
All 90% CIs for the test-to-reference ratios of the AUCs were within the pre-specified acceptance range 
of 80.00 to 125.00 (including 100.00) demonstrating the PK similarity between CT-P16 and EU-Avastin. 
In the original ANCOVA analysis, the 90% CI for the test-to reference ratio of Cmax was within the range 
of 80.00 to 125.00; however, not including 100.00. A sensitivity analysis for the Cmax parameter which 
excludes one subject who had Cmax much lower and Tmax much later than other subjects, resulted in a 
90% CI included 100.00. Based on the serum bevacizumab concentration (µg/ml) vs time (h) profile of 
this  excluded  subject,  it  can  be  agreed  with  the  applicant  that  the  subject  had  received  most  likely 
subcutaneous infusion instead of IV infusion.  
The mean secondary PK parameters (t1/2, λz, CL, Vz, and %AUCext) were comparable between the two 
treatment groups. The inter-subject variability was low in all PK parameters also in this study. 
It  was  reported  that  the  studied  population  was  healthy  first-  or  second  -generation  Japanese  male 
subjects.  However,  in  the  inclusion  criteria,  there  is  no  item  that  subjects  must  be  Japanese. 
Furthermore, in the demographic data, it was reported that all subjects were Asian male and not Hispanic 
or  Latino.  There  are  51  different  Asian  countries  (in  addition  to  Japan  e.g.  China,  Indonesia,  India, 
Thailand). Consequently, it is not clear if all subjects were Japanese. This study is a supportive PK study, 
and for EU registration purposes it is not a concern, if there have been also subjects with ethnicity other 
than Japanese. 
The applicant was asked to provide the certificate of analysis for the EU-Avastin batch N7397H12 used 
in the study CT-P16 1.2. The applicant provided the requested data in the response to D180 questions. 
The protein content of EU-Avastin was within specification limits, and highly similar between test and 
reference products (test CT-P16: 25.0 mg/mL, reference EU-Avastin: 24.7 mg/mL). 
Comparative efficacy and safety study in nsNSCLC patients (CT-P16 3.1) 
In  the  phase  III  clinical  study,  the  observed  Ctrough  concentrations  were  comparable  between  CT-P16 
group and EU-Avastin group from baseline through induction cycle 6.  
Other issues 
Assessment report

All clinical studies support the biosimilarity in clinical PK between CT-P16 and EU-Avastin. 
No clinical studies in special populations and no in vitro  or in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were 
conducted with the CT-P16 and this is acceptable. 
In the proposed CT-P16 SmPC the Section “5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties” is similar as in the Avastin 
SmPC, which is acceptable.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  primary  PK  endpoints  were  within  predefined  limits,  and  CT-P16  can  be  considered  biosimilar  to 
EU-Avastin based on the presented PK data.  
CT-P16  has  been  developed  as  a  biosimilar  to  Avastin  (bevacizumab),  and  their  similarity  has  been 
demonstrated  through  a  series  of  physicochemical  and  biological  assays.  No  separate  clinical 
pharmacodynamic  or  PK/PD  studies  have  been  undertaken,  which  is  considered  acceptable  for  a 
biosimilar development programme.

Study  CT-P16  3.1:  A  Double-Blind,  Randomized,  Active-Controlled,  Parallel-Group,  Phase  3 
Study  to  Compare  Efficacy  and  Safety  of  CT-P16  and  EU-Approved  Avastin  as  First-Line 
Treatment for Metastatic or Recurrent Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
Methods 
Study  CT-P16  3.1  is  an  ongoing  double-blind,  randomised,  active-controlled,  parallel-group,  Phase  3 
study to compare the efficacy, PK, and overall safety of CT-P16 (15 mg/kg) and EU-Avastin (15 mg/kg) 
when co-administered with paclitaxel and carboplatin as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic 
or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (nsNSCLC). Patients were randomly assigned in 
a 1:1 ratio to CT-P16 or EU-Avastin, and the patients were stratified by country, sex (female vs. male), 
disease  status  (recurrence  vs.  metastatic),  and  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG) 
performance score (0 vs. 1). 
The  study  comprises  four  periods.  On  completion  of  the  Screening  Period,  eligible  patients  were 
randomised  to  receive  intravenous  CT-P16  or  EU-Avastin  every  3  weeks  up  to  6  cycles.  All  patients 
concomitantly  received  intravenous  paclitaxel  and  carboplatin  every  3  weeks  up  to  6  cycles  (at  least 
4 cycles).  If  a  patient  had  progressive  disease  (PD)  during  or  after  the  completion  of  the  Induction 
Study Period (assessed at the end of Cycle 6) or did not enter the Maintenance Study Period due to any 
reason, the patient was to complete the end-of-treatment (EOT) visit, then directly enter the Follow-Up 
Period. 
After  the  completion  of  6  cycles  during  the  Induction  Study  Period,  patients  with  controlled  disease 
(complete response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable disease [SD], assessed at the end of Cycle 6) 
entered  the  Maintenance  Study  Period,  during  which  patients  receive  CT-P16  or  EU-Avastin  as 
monotherapy  every  3  weeks  until  PD  or  intolerable  toxicity,  whichever  occurs  first,  after  which  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636045/2022

patients perform the EOT visit and then enter the Follow-Up Period. An EOT visit occurs 3 weeks after 
the  last  dose  of  the  Induction  Study  Period  or  Maintenance  Study  Period  regardless  of  the  reason  of 
discontinuation. 
All patients who enter the Follow-Up Period due to any reason are followed every 9 weeks until death or 
the end of study, whichever occurs first. If PD was not confirmed during the Induction Study Period or 
Maintenance Study Period, tumour response evaluation is performed every 9 weeks during the Follow-
Up Period. The Follow-Up Period is expected to last for up to approximately 3 years from the enrolment 
of the last patient. 
The general design of the study is outlined in Figure 2 below. 
Figure 2. Study design for Study CT-P16 3.1 
As indicated above, the study is currently ongoing. In the Response to the D120 List of Questions, the 
applicant provided data from a data lock corresponding to the time when the last enrolled patient had 
been followed up for 1 year.

Study CT-P16 3.1 is a global multi-centre trial conducted in a total of 164 study centres in 21 countries 
(Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia, Georgia, Hungary, India, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Poland, 
Portugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Thailand, Ukraine, Vietnam). 
•  Treatments 
During the Induction Study Period, patients received 15 mg/kg IV of either CT-P16 or EU-Avastin every 
3  weeks  up  to  6  cycles.  Patients  received  paclitaxel  200  mg/m2 IV  and  carboplatin  AUC  6.0  IV  every 
3 weeks up to 6 cycles (at least 4 cycles). After the Induction Study Period, either CT-P16 or EU-Avastin 
as a monotherapy (15 mg/kg IV) was maintained every 3 weeks until either PD or intolerable toxicity 
occurrence, whichever occurred first. 
Study treatments (CT-P16 or EU-Avastin, carboplatin, and paclitaxel) were administered on the same 
day. If one of them had to be delayed, study treatment had to be delayed. If one of them had to be 
permanently discontinued, study treatment had to be discontinued. Uncoupling of study treatment was 
not allowed until at least 4 cycles of the Induction Study Period had been completed; thus, paclitaxel 
and/or carboplatin could be discontinued at Cycle 5 or 6 of the Induction Study Period. 
Treatment during the Induction Study Period and Maintenance Study Period could be delayed for up to 
3 weeks from the planned schedule if warranted by adverse events or laboratory findings (haematological 
or non-haematological toxicity); specific instructions were provided in the study protocol. If treatment 
was  delayed  more  than  3  weeks,  the  patient  had  to  be  discontinued.  Dose  modifications  were  not 
permitted for bevacizumab but were allowed for paclitaxel and carboplatin. 
During the Induction Study Period, study treatment was administered in the following order: 
•  Hydration (according to local practice) 
•  Dexamethasone 20 mg 
Oral, approximately 12 and 6 hours prior to administration of paclitaxel or 
IV infusion, 30 to 60 minutes prior to administration of paclitaxel 
•  Diphenhydramine (or its equivalent) 50 mg 
IV infusion 30 to 60 minutes prior to administration of paclitaxel 
•  Cimetidine 300 mg or ranitidine 50 mg 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636045/2022  
Page 42/109 
 
 
 
 
IV infusion 30 to 60 minutes prior to administration of paclitaxel 
• 
Paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 
IV infusion over approximately 3 hours 
•  Carboplatin AUC 6.0 
IV infusion over approximately 30 minutes after administration of paclitaxel 
•  CT-P16 or EU-Avastin 15 mg/kg 
IV infusion over 30 to 90 minutes after administration of carboplatin 
An antiemetic could be used based on local practice, and the dose of dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, 
and cimetidine could be adjusted at the investigator’s discretion. 
CT-P16 or EU-Avastin was diluted in a total volume of 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride and administered 
by IV infusion with an infusion pump. The dose was delivered over 90 minutes (±15 minutes) at the 
Cycle 1 of the Induction Study Period. If the infusion was well tolerated, the infusion of Cycle 2 of the 
Induction Study Period could be administered over 60 minutes (±10 minutes). If the 60-minute infusion 
was well tolerated, all subsequent infusions could be administered over 30 minutes (±10 minutes). The 
study drug was required to be handled by delegated unblinded staff. 
•  Objectives 
The primary objective of study CT-P16 3.1 was to demonstrate that CT-P16 was similar to EU-Avastin in 
terms of efficacy as determined by objective response rate (ORR) during the Induction Study Period. 
The secondary objectives of the study are: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate additional efficacy profiles including ORR during the Whole Study Period, response 
duration, time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) 
To evaluate the PK of trough serum concentration (Ctrough) 
To evaluate safety profile including immunogenicity 
To evaluate quality of life (QoL) 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  ORR  based  on  the  best  overall  response  (BOR)  during  the 
Induction  Study  Period  by  Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in  Solid  Tumors  (RECIST)  version  1.1. 
Categorisation of overall response at each visit was based on the following response categories: complete 
response  (CR),  partial  response  (PR),  stable  disease  (SD),  progressive  disease  (PD),  and  inevaluable 
(NE). ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed BOR of CR or PR (the ‘responder’). 
All  other  patients  in  the  ITT  or  PP  population  except  responders  were  considered  non-responders, 
including patients without post-baseline tumour assessment. For CR or PR, BOR was confirmed by the 
subsequent assessment based on RECIST v.1.1. For a BOR of SD, measurements had to meet its criteria 
at least once after start of study treatment for a minimum interval of 6  weeks (42 days) considering 
+/- 6 days, which is equivalent to a minimum time of 36 days. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  ORR based on BOR during the Whole Study Period by RECIST version 1.1 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636045/2022  
Page 43/109 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Response  duration:  the  time  between  initial  response  (complete  response  [CR]  or  partial 
response [PR]) and PD/recurrence or death from any cause, whichever occurred first 
• 
• 
TTP: the time from randomisation to determined PD/recurrence 
PFS:  the  time  from  randomisation  to  determined  PD/recurrence  or  death  from  any  cause, 
whichever occurred first 
•  OS: the time from randomisation to death from any cause 
An independent tumour review committee (ITRC) was used to review the images for tumour responses. 
In addition to the ITRC, images were separately reviewed by local investigators. Local results were used 
for eligibility and treatment practice purposes. Central and local image review results were analysed and 
listed separately.  
Quality of life was assessed with the Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and Quality of Life Questionnaire 
Lung Cancer-specific module (QLQ-LC13), using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment 
of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ). 
•  Sample size 
A sample size of 305 patients per group was planned to provide 80% power to show similarity in efficacy 
between  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  based  on  the  expected  ORR  of  38%  with  an  equivalence  margin 
of -12.5 to 12.5 using a 95% CI (two one-sided alpha 0.025) of the difference in ORR. Approximately 
678 patients (339 in each group) were planned to be enrolled for the anticipated drop-out rate of 10%. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
An interactive web response system (IWRS) was used for the randomisation. An unblinded statistician 
generated  a  computer-generated  randomisation  schedule  for  IWRS,  which  linked  sequential  patient 
randomisation numbers to treatment codes. 
Patients who qualified for randomisation were randomly assigned on Day 1 of Cycle 1 of the Induction 
Study Period in a 1:1 ratio to receive CT-P16 or EU-Avastin. The randomisation was balanced by using 
permuted blocks and was  stratified by country, sex (female vs. male), disease status (recurrence vs. 
metastatic), and ECOG performance score (0 vs. 1). 
The study was double-blinded during the study period. 
The  blind  should  be  broken  for  the  individual  patients  only  if  specific  emergency  treatment  would  be 
dictated  by  knowing  the  study  drug  status  of  the  patient.  The  investigator  could,  in  an  emergency, 
determine the identity of the study drug by using the applicable procedure in the IWRS.  
The  randomisation  codes  of  10  patients  were  unblinded  to  patients,  investigators,  and  study  site 
personnel before data cut-off date as per the investigator’s request for the administration of second line 
treatment at the investigator’s discretion; there was no specific emergency related to patient safety. The 
identification of the study drugs for the patients was revealed by the investigator’s decision using the 
applicable procedure in the IWRS and the date, time, and reason for the unblinding were documented in 
the appropriate field of the eCRF and source documents. 
As  planned in the  protocol,  the overall  randomisation  code  was  broken  on  16 July  2021  for  reporting 
purpose after database lock (15 July 2021) to generate the first CSR, dated 13 September 2021. The 
unblinded analyses were performed as per statistical analysis plan (SAP) version 1.0 (finalised on 14 July 
2021).  The  unblinded  personnel  was  pre-defined  before  breaking  the  study  blind.  The  database  was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636045/2022  
Page 44/109 
 
 
 
 
 
locked on 03 December 2021 to generate the second CSR and the unblinded analyses were performed 
as per SAP version 2.0 (finalised on 02 December 2021). The study has been blinded and will be blinded 
to  the  investigators,  patients,  and  pre-defined  CELLTRION,  Inc.  and  PPD  blinded  personnel  until  the 
completion of the study and the database sets finalised for study termination. 
The  randomisation  codes  for  all  the  other  patients,  investigators,  or  study  site  personnel  will  not  be 
revealed until all final clinical data are entered into the database and the database is locked and released 
for analysis. 
•  Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
The MAA submission contained the CSR that was the first of three planned reports for this study, and 
included  efficacy  data  obtained  up  to  end  of  Maintenance  Cycle  3  date  prior  to  cut-off  date  (22  April 
2021)  for  the  confirmation  of  BOR  during  the  Induction  Period.  Also,  PK  and  QoL  data  up  to  end  of 
Induction Cycle 6 were included. In the Response to the D120 List of Questions, the applicant provided 
the second CSR; the cut-off date of 21 September 2021 for this CSR corresponds to the time when the 
last  enrolled  patient  had  completed  1  year  of  follow-up.  The  second  CSR  also  contained  analyses  for 
time-dependent secondary endpoints. 
All analyses were conducted using SAS® software Version 9.4 or higher. 
The  primary  population  for  the  efficacy  analysis  was  ITT  population  consisting  of  patients  who  were 
successfully screened and randomly assigned to study drug (regardless of whether any study treatment 
dosing was completed).  
A supportive efficacy analysis was performed using the PP population consisting of randomly assigned 
patients who had at least 1 response evaluation after receiving at least 1 full dose of study drug (CT-P16 
or EU-Avastin) in the Induction Study Period and who did not have any major protocol deviations that 
could  have  affected  the  interpretation  of  the  primary  endpoint  including  being  treated  with  opposite 
treatment  to  which  the  patients  was  assigned,  non-compliance  of  inclusion  or  exclusion  criteria, 
significant GCP non-compliance, prohibited therapies or missing primary efficacy assessment.  
Additionally, the primary analysis was performed excluding patients with major protocol deviation related 
to COVID-19 in ITT population as supportive analysis and the patients were flagged in listings. 
Final determinations of the PP population were made at the data review meeting before unblinding. In 
both analysis populations patients were analysed as per the randomised treatment.  
The  primary  endpoint  was  objective  response  rate  (ORR)  based  on  the  best  overall  response  (BOR) 
during the Induction Study Period. For CR or PR, BOR had to be confirmed by the subsequent assessment. 
BOR was categorised as CR, PR, SD, PD, or NE. The ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with 
a  confirmed  BOR  of  CR  or  PR  (the  ‘responder’).  All  other  patients  in  the  ITT  or  PP  population  except 
responders  were  considered  as  non-responders,  including  patients  without  post-baseline  tumour 
assessment.  Central  assessment of  tumour  response  was  considered  primary,  while  local  assessment 
was used as a sensitivity analysis. 
The similarity criterion had been set such that the confidence limits of the 95% confidence interval (CI) 
of the difference of ORR from each treatment group was entirely within the interval (-12.5, 12.5).  
The  primary  analysis  (ORR  based  on  central  review)  was  performed  with  a  logistic  regression  model 
considering region (Europe, Middle East, and Africa [EMEA] vs. America vs. Asia), sex (female vs. male), 
disease status at baseline (recurrence vs. metastatic), and ECOG performance status at baseline (0 vs.

1) as covariates with treatment groups (CT-P16 and EU-Avastin) as a fixed effect. In calculation for the 
ORR in each treatment group, the applicant assigned weights for the fixed model effects (corresponding 
to the levels of stratification factors) proportionally based on the distribution of stratification factor levels 
in the population studied. 
Tipping point analysis was conducted using central review data based on exact binomial approach in the 
ITT population to evaluate the sensitivity of conclusion to the missing data (no response evaluation or 
evaluated as ‘NE’) assumptions. Tipping point analyses were conducted under Missing Not at Random 
(MNAR) scenarios. Imputation was done by gradually shifting the number of responders by treatment 
group to make MNAR scenarios. In response D120 LoQ, also an analysis of ORR corresponding to MAR 
assumption  was  provided  to  give  a  base  case  to  the  aforementioned  tipping  point  analysis.  In  this 
analysis,  missing  responses  that  were  considered  uninformative  were  multiple  imputed  based  on 
patients’ stratification factors. 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
A total of 1.530 patients were screened for the study. Of these, 841 patients were screen failed; the 
most frequently reported primary reason for screening failure was inclusion/exclusion criteria not met 
(773 patients). 
A total of 689 patients were randomly assigned to study drug and initiated the Induction Study Period 
(342 patients in the CT-P16 treatment group and 347 patients in the EU-Avastin treatment group). Of 
these,  499  (72.4%)  patients  completed  the  Induction  Study  Period  (258  [75.4%]  in  the  CT-P16 
treatment group and 241 [69.5%] in the EU-Avastin treatment group). The most frequently reported 
reason for study treatment discontinuation in the Induction Study Period was PD (21 [6.1%] patients 
and  32  [9.2%]  patients  in  the  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  treatment  groups,  respectively).  Among  the 
patients who had completed the Induction Study Period, a total of 33 (4.8%) patients did not enter to 
Maintenance Study Period (19 [5.6%] patients in the CT-P16 treatment group and 14 [4.0%] patients 
in the EU-Avastin treatment group, respectively) and the most frequently reported reason for the study 
treatment  discontinuation  was  PD  (14  [4.1%]  patients  and  14  [4.0%]  patients  in  the  CT-P16  and 
EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively). 
A  total  of  466  (67.6%)  patients  initiated  the  Maintenance  Study  Period  (239  [69.9%]  patients  in  the 
CT-P16  treatment  group  and  227  [65.4%]  patients  in  the  EU-Avastin  treatment  group).  Based  on 
updated  data  received  with  the  D120  responses,  392  (56.9%)  patients  discontinued  the  Maintenance 
Study Period (206 [60.2%] patients in CT-P16 treatment group and 186 [53.6%] patients in EU-Avastin 
treatment  group).  The  most  frequently  reported  reason  for  study  treatment  discontinuation  in  the 
Maintenance Study Period was PD (154 [45.0%] patients and 127 [36.6%] patients in the CT-P16 and 
EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively). 
Overall patient disposition is summarised in Figure 3 below and Table 8.

As seen in Table 8, the reason for ending participation in the study was death in a total of 332 patients. 
Among  these  patients,  the  reported  reason  for  death  was  disease  progression  in  220 patients  (110 
patients in the CT-P16 group and 110 patients in the EU-Avastin group), adverse event in 37 patients 
(17  patients  in  the  CT-P16  group  and  20  patients  in  the  EU-Avastin  group),  concurrent  illness  in  7 
patients (3 patients in the CT-P16 group and 4 patients in the EU-Avastin group), unknown in 28 patients 
(13 patients in the CT-P16 group and 15 patients in the EU-Avastin group), and other in 40 patients (21 
patients in the CT-P16 group and 19 patients in the EU-Avastin group). 
A  total  of  68  (9.9%)  patients  had  at  least  1  major  protocol  deviation.  Patients  with  major  protocol 
deviation were excluded from the PP population. The most frequently reported major protocol deviation 
was missing primary efficacy assessment (21 [6.1%] patients and 39 [11.2%] patients in the CT-P16 
and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively). These patients did not have any tumour assessment 
result at post-baseline in central and/or local review. Only one patient had a major protocol deviation 
due to COVID-19. Major protocol deviations are summarised in 9. 
Table 9. Major Protocol Deviations in Study CT-P16 3.1 (ITT Population) 
The applicant was requested to clarify the notable imbalance between treatment groups with respect to 
the proportion of subjects excluded from the PP population, in particular due to missing primary efficacy 
assessment, and the reasons for the missing primary efficacy assessment. In the D120 responses, the

applicant clarified that an imbalance between the treatment groups was particularly observed in missing 
primary efficacy assessment being due to ‘patient withdrawal’ (1 [0.3%] patient and 14 [4.0%] patients 
in the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively). 
•  Recruitment 
The first patient was randomised into the study on 01 February 2019, and the study remains ongoing. 
•  Conduct of the study 
The original protocol (Version 1.0) was dated 12 June 2018. The protocol was amended 12 times during 
the  course  of  the  study.  One  of  the  amendments  was  global,  resulting  in  Protocol  Version  2.0;  other 
amendments were country-specific. The amendments primarily concerned additional specifications and 
minor adjustments in eligibility criteria. 
According  to  the  applicant,  the  study  was  conducted  according  to  the  ICH  E6  (R2)  risk  and  quality 
processes  described  in  the  applicable  procedural  documents.  The  quality  management  approach 
implemented in this study was documented and complied with the current ICH GCP guidelines on quality 
and  risk  management.  Monitoring  activities  comprised  a  combination  of  centralised  and  risk-based 
monitoring activities as well as periodic on-site monitoring visits. According to audit certificates provided 
by  the  applicant,  8  study  sites  were  subject  to  routine  clinical  site  audits.  Based  on  major  protocol 
deviations  reported  by  the  applicant,  no  instances  of  significant  GCP  non-compliance  were  identified 
(Table 14). 
The study was not subject to GCP inspections by regulatory authorities. 
•  Baseline data 
The study enrolled a predominantly Caucasian population. Median age was 62 years, 35% were female 
and  65%  male,  and  69%  were  either  former  or  current  smokers.  Disease  status  at  baseline  was 
metastatic in 92% of patients. The demographic characteristics and stratification factors are summarised 
in 10, and baseline disease characteristics are summarised in Table 11.

•  Numbers analysed 
The number of patients in the statistical analysis sets is displayed in Table 12 . Out of 689 patients in 
the ITT Population, 621 (90.1%) patients were included in the PP Population. The primary reason for 
excluding a patient from the PP Population was a major protocol deviation of a missing primary efficacy 
assessment (21 patients in the CT-P16 group and 39 patients in the EU-Avastin group).

Table 13. Objective Response Rates and Best Overall Response during the Induction Study 
Period in Study CT-P16 3.1 (Central) (ITT and PP Populations) 
In the ITT population, the 95% CI for difference (CT-P16 and EU-Avastin) in ORR during the Induction 
Study Period was within the equivalence margin of -12.5 to 12.5 (-7.02 to 7.83). The ORRs were similar 
in  the  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  treatment  groups  (42.40%  [95%  CI:  37.16  –  47.64]  and  42.07% 
[95% CI: 36.88  –  47.27],  respectively)  and  the  risk  difference  (CT-P16  -  EU-Avastin)  estimate  was 
0.4%. For BORs, a similar proportion of patients in the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin treatment groups had CR 
(2 [0.6%] patients and 3 [0.9%] patients in the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively) 
and PR (143 [41.8%] patients and 143 [41.2%] patients in the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, 
respectively) in the ITT population. 
In the PP population, the ORRs and the BORs were similar to those in the ITT population. The 95% CI 
for difference was also within the equivalence margin of -12.5 to 12.5 (-9.80 to 6.00), which supports 
the result of the primary analysis. The ORRs were similar in the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin treatment groups 
(45.28%  [95%  CI:  39.81  –  50.75]  and  47.19%  [95%  CI:  41.57  –  52.82],  respectively)  and  the  risk 
difference (CT-P16 - EU-Avastin) estimate was -1.9%. A similar proportion of patients in the CT-P16 and 
EU-Avastin  treatment  groups  had  CR  (2  [0.6%]  patients  and  3  [1.0%]  patients  in  the  CT-P16  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636045/2022

EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively) and PR (142 [44.7%] patients and 140 [46.2%] patients in 
the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively). 
In order to evaluate the impact of missing data on the efficacy primary endpoint results, tipping point 
analyses  were  conducted  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  (central  review  data)  for  ITT  Population. 
Overall 66 patients were considered as missing cases in the tipping point analysis: 60 patients (21 [6.1%] 
patients  and  39  [11.2%] patients in  the  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  treatment  groups,  respectively)  with 
missing  primary  efficacy  assessment  and  6  patients  (3  patients  each  in  the  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin, 
respectively) with best overall response of NE. 
In the tipping point analysis, the two-sided 95% CIs for the difference in proportion between CT-P16 and 
EU-Avastin  treatment  groups  were  contained  within  the  equivalence  margin  of  (-12.5,  12.5)  when 
differences in the imputed number of responders between the two treatment groups were 15 or below. 
The  differences  in  the  imputed  number  of  responders  of  up  to  15  did  not  alter  the  conclusion  of 
therapeutic equivalence between the two treatment groups. The tipping point analyses are summarised 
in Table 14. 
In response to D120 LoQ, to address the possible impact of missing data and their reasons on the ORR 
results, an additional analysis was provided based on the applicant’s interpretation of missing at random 
assumption.  Among  those  with  missing  efficacy  evaluation,  the  reported  reasons  were:  15  patient 
withdrawal  (1  and  14  in  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin,  respectively),  5  lost  to  follow-up,  1  investigator’s 
decision  and  1  protocol  violation.  These  were  considered  uninformative  cases  as  were  the  additional 
6 patients with BOR of unevaluable. The patients who discontinued treatment due to AE (6 in CT-P16 
and  5  in  EU-Avastin)  or  death  (10  in  CT-P16  and  15  in  EU-Avastin)  before  tumour  assessment  were 
analysed  in  two  ways:  In  scenario  1,  the  subset  of  10  cases  of  death  due  to  clinical  progression  by 
investigator’s opinion (5 in CT-P16, 5 in EU-Avastin) were considered as non-responders while the rest 
were  considered  uninformative.  In  scenario  2,  all  of  the  discontinuations  due  to  AE  or  death  before 
scheduled tumour assessment were considered as uninformative cases. 
The two scenarios analysed resulted in very similar estimates of risk difference of ORR for CT-P16 vs. 
and  EU-Avastin:  -2.34%  [95%  CI:  -10.21  –  5.54]  according  to  scenario  1  (all  patients  with  missing 
tumour assessment considered uninformative except for deaths potentially due to PD that were analysed 
as  non-response)  and  -2.36  [95%  CI:  -10.27  –  5.55]  according  to  scenario  2  (with  all  patients  with 
missing tumour assessment considered uninformative).

ORR’s  based  on  local  investigator  reviews  were  presented  as  a  sensitivity  analysis;  the  results  are 
displayed in Table 15 for the ITT population, and Table 16 for the PP population. For both analyses, the 
95% CI for difference between CT-P16 and EU-Avastin in ORR during the Induction Study Period was 
within the equivalence margin of -12.5 to 12.5 (ITT: 4.87% [95 %CI: -2.53 to 12.26]; PP: 2.90% [95 
% CI: -4.99 to 10.79]). Whereas the 95% CI’s for both the ITT and PP populations were contained within 
the pre-specified equivalence margin, it is noted that the point estimates for the treatment difference 
were larger than in results based on central review.

Evaluation of efficacy is primarily based on longitudinal assessment of changes in target tumour sizes

The changes in individual patients’ target tumour sizes are visualised in CT-P16 and EU-Avastin groups 
in Figure 5 and 6, respectively. In addition, summary of statistics of target tumour % changes of diameter 
were provided by the applicant at start of induction cycle 2, 4 and 6. By induction cycle 2, those that 
achieved RECIST v1.1 response (BOR of CR or PR) in CT-P16 and EU-Avastin had, on average, mean 
reduction of 37.1% and 31.5% in tumour size, respectively. Among the RECIST v1.1 non-responders, 
the respective mean reductions were 12.8% and 14.0%. 
Analyses of secondary endpoints: PFS and OS 
PFS was defined as time from randomisation to determined progression disease (PD)/recurrence or death 
from  any  cause,  whichever  occurs  first.  PD/recurrence  or  death  that  occurred  on  or  before  beginning 
another new anticancer therapy was regarded as an event. Censoring was defined as following:

Table 20. Reasons for censoring and censoring dates 
In  the  ITT  population,  72.5%  (248/342)  patients  and  70.9%  (246/347)  patients  had  died  or  had 
PD/recurrence  in  the  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  treatment  groups,  respectively.  The  median  PFS  were 
7.9 [95% CI: 6.9 – 8.3] months and 7.2 [95% CI: 6.5 – 8.3] months for the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin 
treatment groups, respectively. The hazard ratio of PFS was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.77 – 1.10). 
In  the  PP  population,  72.3%  (230/318)  patients  and  73.3%  (222/303)  patients  had  died  or  had 
PD/recurrence  in  the  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  treatment  groups,  respectively.  The  median  PFS  was 
8.3 [95% CI: 7.2 – 8.5] months and 8.1 [95% CI: 6.8 – 8.6] months for the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin 
treatment groups, respectively. The hazard ratio of PFS was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.76 – 1.12). 
The summary of PFS (Central) for the Study CT-P16 3.1 is presented below in Table 21. A Kaplan-Meier

In  response  to  the  D180 LoQ,  the  applicant  performed  PFS  analysis  where  death  cases that  occurred 
during  the  Follow-Up  Period  were  regarded  as  an  event  and  patients  who  withdrew  from  the  study 
without any event or anticancer therapy were censored at the last date of tumour assessment as they 
were  in  the  original  analysis.  The  applicant  also  performed  PFS  analysis  in  which  study  treatment 
withdrawal and anticancer therapy with no PD/recurrence or death were newly considered as an event 
in  addition  to  censoring  logic  implemented  in  the  previous  sensitivity  analysis.  With  respect  to  the 
comparison between CT-P16 and EU-Avastin, the results of these additional analyses were similar to the 
original PFS analysis.

OS was defined as time from randomisation to death from any cause. Death was regarded as an event 
and non-death was censored at the last known alive date. 
In the ITT population, 48.0% (164/342) patients and 48.4% (168/347) patients had died in the CT-P16 
and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively. The median OS was 17.1 [95% CI: 14.6 – 18.7] months 
and 15.6 [95% CI: 13.4 – 18.0] months for the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively. 
The hazard ratio of OS was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.77 – 1.19). 
In  the  PP  population,  147  (46.2%)  patients  and  145  (47.9%)  patients  had  died  in  the  CT-P16  and 
EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively. The median OS was 17.5 [95% CI: 15.5 – 19.2] months and 
17.0 [95% CI: 14.6 – 20.5] months for the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively. The 
hazard ratio of OS was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.76 – 1.22). 
The summary of OS for Study CT-P16 3.1 is presented below in Table 22. Kaplan-Meier plots of OS are

Efficacy population 
-  Intent-to-treat  (ITT)  Population:  The  ITT  population  is  defined  as  all  patients 
randomly assigned to study drug, regardless of whether or not any study treatment 
dosing  is  completed  and  successfully  screened.  Patients  were  assigned  to 
treatment groups based on randomisation. The primary population for the primary 
efficacy analysis was the ITT population.   
- Per-Protocol Population: The PP population is defined as all randomly assigned 
patients who have at least one response evaluation after receiving at least one full 
dose of study drug (CT P16 or EU Approved Avastin) in the Induction Study Period 
and who do not have any major protocol deviation. A major protocol deviation was 
one that may affect the interpretation of primary endpoint and it was defined in 
the SAP. Final determinations of the PP population were made at the blinded data 
review  meeting  before  unblinding.  Patients  were  assigned  to  treatment  groups 
based on randomisation. A supportive efficacy analysis was repeated using the PP 
population. 
Tumour  evaluation  was  assessed  at  Screening  and  every  2  cycles  during  the 
Induction Study Period and every 3 cycles during the Maintenance Study Period, 
and  at  the  EOT  visit.  During  the  Follow-Up  Period,  it  will  be  performed  every  9 
weeks until PD, death, withdrawal or start of new anti-cancer therapy if PD is not 
confirmed during the Induction or Maintenance Study Periods.

2.4.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
As outlined above, data used to support biosimilarity of CT-P16 with EU-Avastin from a clinical efficacy 
perspective stems from one clinical study (Study CT-P16 3.1), conducted in patients with metastatic or 
recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study  CT-P16  3.1  is  an  ongoing  double-blind,  randomised,  active-controlled,  parallel-group  study 
comparing  CT-P16  (15  mg/kg)  and  EU-Avastin  (15  mg/kg)  when  co-administered  with  paclitaxel  and 
carboplatin  as  first-line  treatment  in  patients  with  metastatic  or  recurrent  nsNSCLC.  Eligible  patients 
were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous CT-P16 or EU-Avastin every 3 weeks. All patients 
concomitantly received intravenous paclitaxel and carboplatin every 3 weeks up to 6 cycles (at least 4 
cycles).  After  the  completion  of  6  cycles  during  the  Induction  Study  Period,  patients  with  controlled 
disease (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable disease [SD], assessed at the end of 
Cycle 6) entered the Maintenance Study Period, during which patients receive CT-P16 or EU-Avastin as 
monotherapy every 3 weeks until PD or intolerable toxicity. 
The basic design of the study is acceptable and consistent with expectations for a clinical biosimilarity 
study.  The  eligibility  criteria  adequately  define  an  appropriate target  population  for the  clinical  study, 
and  similar  eligibility  criteria  have  been  applied  in  multiple  prior  studies  for  bevacizumab  biosimilars. 
Dose selection for study drugs was in accordance with the authorised posology for Avastin. 
The primary objective of study CT-P16 3.1 was to demonstrate that CT-P16 was similar to EU-Avastin in 
terms  of  efficacy  as  determined  by  objective  response  rate  (ORR)  during  the Induction  Study  Period. 
Secondary objectives include ORR during the Whole Study Period, response duration, time to progression 
(TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The primary and secondary objectives 
are  consistent  with  expectations  for  a  clinical  biosimilarity  trial;  demonstration  of  similarity  based  on 
ORR  is  consistent  with  regulatory  precedent  and  is  endorsed  as  an  appropriate  primary  objective.  In 
addition  to  a  BOR  approach,  ORR  has  been  reported  by  treatment  cycle;  this  additional  analysis  is 
endorsed  as  providing  relevant  additional  information  for  assessment  of  biosimilarity.  Data  for  the 
secondary endpoints were not included in the initial submission but were received within the applicant’s 
responses to the D120 List of Questions. 
A key requirement for an equivalence study is assay sensitivity, i.e. ability to detect a true difference 
between the outcomes between the comparative treatments. Despite the ‘standard’ response definitions 
as per RECIST 1.1 the actual performance of the measure may differ between studies and may depend 
on design and quality considerations. An Independent Tumour Review Committee (ITRC) was used for 
the primary analysis. Images for tumour assessment were reviewed separately centrally and locally, and 
both  image  review  results  were  analysed  and  listed  separately.  Based  on  the  imaging  charter,  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636045/2022  
Page 72/109 
 
 
 
operations were deemed to be consistent with conventional expectations for an ITRC. The reported rates 
of  inter-rater  concordance  are  considered  acceptable  and  indicate  adequate  sensitivity  to  detect 
differences in radiographic outcomes between patients and thus between treatment groups. 
The equivalence margin of -12.5% to 12.5% is similar to the margin previously applied in MAAs for other 
bevacizumab biosimilars for demonstrating similar efficacy in  first-line NSCLC  indication. According to 
the  meta-analysis  across  4  trials,  randomised  bevacizumab,  added  to  chemotherapy,  increases  the 
probability  of  objective  response  by  at  least  12.89  percentage  points  (based  on  lower  limit  of  95% 
confidence  intervals).  Thereby,  the  proposed  margin  is  believed  to  preserve  at  least  some  positive 
fraction of the originator’s efficacy. No clinical justification for the equivalence margin is given by the 
applicant. According to the Clinical Overview, the equivalence margin was agreed with EMA via CHMP 
Scientific Advice (EMEA/H/SA/3334/1/2016/III), however, there is no discussion about the equivalence 
margin for a nsNSCLC population and thereby the accuracy of the applicant’s statement could not be 
ascertained. Given the several recent precedents for the acceptability of an equivalence margin similar 
to that proposed by the applicant, the issue was not pursued. 
The sample size rationale, parameters and results appear consistent. The sample size is adequate for 
the purpose. 
The measures for the blinding of the study seem adequate and for the safety precaution the IWRS system 
seems  relevant  as  well  as  the  policy  for  the  unblinding.  The  number  of  cases  when  treatment  was 
unblinded at individual patient level is low and, as such, unlikely to risk to credibility of the results.  
The number of stratification factors exceeds the recommended number of ICH guideline E9 Statistical 
Principles  for  Clinical  Trials.  The  number  of  randomisation  strata  is  168  and  the  number  of  patients 
randomised must have been very small in a considerable proportion of strata. As such it is questionable 
whether the randomisation procedure was optimal in ensuring balanced treatment groups with respect 
to the key factors. However, as the randomisation actually resulted in reasonable balance with respect 
each of the stratification factors, this potential methodological caveat can be ignored. 
Randomisation was stratified by country and, as per ICH E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials, factors 
on which randomisation has been stratified should be accounted for later in the analysis. In this study, 
the  countries  were  pooled  into  three  geographic  regions  for  the  statistical  analysis.  In  the  D120 
responses, the applicant provided an adequate rationale for pooling the countries into the regions for 
the purpose of the statistical analysis and summarised the numbers of study subjects from each region.  
Due to the excessive number of strata and low assumed number of patients in many of them, a fully 
stratified statistical analysis of outcome would not be feasible. Instead a parsimonious model, e.g. logistic 
regression,  must  be  used  to  account  for  stratification  factors  in  the  statistical  comparison  between 
treatment groups. The logistic regression model assumes that the odds (hence probability) of response 
may differ depending - in addition to treatment assignment - on the covariates: geographic region where 
the patient participates in the study, sex, baseline disease status and baseline ECOG performance status. 
When a single response rate for a treatment group or difference between treatment groups is estimated 
from a logistic regression model the result is specific to the chosen levels of the covariates or the weights 
used for averaging. In calculation for the ORR in each treatment group, the applicant assigned weights 
for the fixed model effects (corresponding to the levels of stratification factors) proportionally based on 
the distribution of stratification factor levels in the population studied. This is considered appropriate. 
Evaluation of efficacy is primarily based on longitudinal assessment of changes in target tumour sizes 
but neither statistical summaries nor visualisation of these raw data were included in original submission. 
In  D120  LoQ,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  provide  a  descriptive  analysis  for  evolution  of  sum  of 
diameter of target lesion by treatment group and further by whether or not response was achieved.

A total of 1.530 patients were screened for the study. Of these, 841 patients were screen failed, most 
commonly for not meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria. A total of 689 patients were randomly assigned 
to study drug and initiated the Induction Study Period (342 patients in the CT-P16 treatment group and 
347  patients  in  the  EU-Avastin  treatment  group).  Of  these,  499  (72.4%)  patients  completed  the 
Induction Study Period (258 [75.4%] in the CT-P16 treatment group and 241 [69.5%] in the EU-Avastin 
treatment group). A total of 466 (67.6%) patients initiated the Maintenance Study Period (239 [69.9%] 
patients in the CT-P16 treatment group and 227 [65.4%] patients in the EU-Avastin treatment group). 
Of  these,  392  (56.9%)  patients  discontinued  the  Maintenance  Study  Period  (206  [60.2%]  patients  in 
CT-P16 treatment group and 186 [53.6%] patients in EU-Avastin treatment group). Overall, the most 
common  reason  for  discontinuation  during  both  the  induction  and  maintenance  periods  was  PD.  The 
number  of  patients  discontinuing  due  to  PD  during  the  Induction  Period  was  slightly  higher  in  the 
EU-Avastin  group  than  the  CT-P16  group;  however,  during  the  Maintenance  Period,  the  number  of 
patients discontinuing due to PD was conversely higher in the CT-P16 group. Overall, the reasons for 
discontinuation were balanced between treatment groups. 
The  reason  for  ending  participation  in  the  study  was  death  in  a  total  of  332 patients.  Among  these 
patients,  the  reported  reason  for  death  was  disease  progression  in  220 patients  (110  patients  in  the 
CT-P16 group and 110 patients in the EU-Avastin group), adverse event in 37 patients (17 patients in 
the CT-P16 group and 20 patients in the EU-Avastin group), concurrent illness in 7 patients (3 patients 
in the CT-P16 group and 4 patients in the EU-Avastin group), unknown in 28 patients (13 patients in the 
CT-P16  group  and  15  patients  in  the  EU-Avastin  group),  and other  in  40  patients  (21  patients  in  the 
CT-P16 group and 19 patients in the EU-Avastin group). 
A total of 68 (9.9%) patients had at least 1 major protocol deviation and are consequently not included 
in the PP population. The most frequently reported major protocol deviation was missing primary efficacy 
assessment  (21  [6.1%]  patients  and  39  [11.2%]  patients  in  the  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  treatment 
groups, respectively). This imbalance has been taken into consideration through tipping point analyses. 
The  applicant  was  also  requested  to  clarify  reasons  behind  the notable  imbalance  between treatment 
groups. In the D120 responses, the applicant clarified that an imbalance between the treatment groups 
was particularly observed in missing primary efficacy assessment due to ‘patient withdrawal’ (1 [0.3%] 
patient and 14 [4.0%] patients in the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively). Although 
the  difference  between  groups  was  in  itself  not  completely  insubstantial,  it  was  agreed  that  the 
distribution  of  these  withdrawals  across  sites,  with  mostly  single  withdrawals for  any  given  centre,  is 
consistent with the imbalance occurring by chance. 
There were 12 amendments to the original study protocol. In addition to one global protocol amendment, 
a number of country-specific amendments were introduced into the study protocol. Of the 11 country-
specific amendments, 6 are dated prior to enrolment of first patient into the study. Overall, these are 
not considered to have any significant effect on the reliability or integrity of the study. 
Based  on  major  protocol  deviations  reported  by  the  applicant,  no  instances  of  significant  GCP  non-
compliance were identified. The study was not subject to GCP inspections by regulatory authorities. 
The study enrolled a predominantly Caucasian population. Median age was 62 years, 35% were female 
and  65%  male,  and  69%  were  either  former  or  current  smokers.  Disease  status  at  baseline  was 
metastatic in 92% of patients. Two thirds of the participants were enrolled in EMEA regions. Despite the 
criticism of possible over-stratification, the treatment groups were in good balance with respect to the 
stratification factors, and overall, no significant imbalances were noted between the treatment groups 
with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics. 
The numbers of subjects in the ITT population correspond to the pre-defined sample size (339 in each 
group).  The  overall  proportion  (90.1  %)  of  subjects  considered  to  comprise  the  PP  population  is 
reasonable given the importance of protocol-compliance in an equivalence setting. There is, however, a 
Assessment report

notable imbalance between treatment groups with respect to the proportion of subjects excluded from 
the  PP  population,  in  particular  due  to  missing  primary  efficacy  assessment.  As  indicated  above,  the 
applicant provided adequate clarification regarding the imbalance. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study CT-P16 3.1 met its primary endpoint. In the ITT population, the risk difference in ORR during the 
Induction Period was 0.40%, and the 95% confidence interval [-7.02 – 7.83] was contained within the 
pre-specified equivalence margin of -12.5 – 12.5. The reported ORR’s (42.40% [95% CI: 37.16 – 47.64] 
for CT-P16 and 42.07% [95% CI: 36.88 – 47.27] for EU-Avastin) are in line with those reported in other 
recent trials for bevacizumab biosimilars. 
The number of patients with missing primary efficacy assessment and hence excluded from Per Protocol 
population  was  considerably  lower  for  CT-P16  than  EU-Avastin  (21  [6.1%]  vs.  39  [11.2%]).  In  the 
ITT analyses  these  missing  assessments  are  defaulted  to  non-response  which  contributes  to  the 
comparison between the treatment groups.  
In addition to central review (central independent reviewer) of ORR during the Induction Study Period, 
as  a  sensitivity  analysis  the  ORR  during  Induction  Study  Period  was  also  reviewed  on  local  level  by 
investigators. In these analyses, the point estimates for the treatment difference were larger than in the 
central review, although the 95% CI’s were still contained within the pre-specified equivalence margin. 
The applicant was requested to explain the difference, and in its response to the D120 LoQ, the applicant 
elaborated  on  local  and  central  tumour  assessment  and  explained  differences  thereof  as  requested. 
Additionally, according to a post-hoc analysis conducted by the applicant, local and central assessment 
showed  similar  extent  of  concordance  between  the  two  treatment  groups  (79.82%  and  78.67%  for 
CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin,  respectively).  Therefore,  it  is  considered  implausible  that  the  observed 
differences impair conclusion on biosimilarity, and no further concern is raised in this regard. 
Tipping point analysis was conducted (using central review data) in the ITT population to evaluate the 
sensitivity of conclusion to the missing data (no response evaluation or evaluated as ‘NE’) assumptions. 
According to the applicant, the differences in the imputed number of responders of up to 15 did not alter 
the conclusion from the primary analysis that appears hence to be robust and not significantly impacted 
by missing data. The applicant states that these analyses were conducted under Missing Not at Random 
(MNAR) scenarios: imputation was done by gradually shifting the number of responders by treatment 
group to make MNAR scenarios. 
In response to D120 LoQ, the applicant provided a summary of reported reasons for missing efficacy 
assessment and analyses that correspond to missing at random assumption and discussed whether or 
not the reasons for the assessment being missing is predictive of the outcome. Lack of post-baseline 
tumour assessment due to death as the reported reason was somewhat more common in EU-Avastin 
group  as  compared  with  CT-P16.  Even  larger  was  the  difference  between number  of  patients  without 
post-baseline tumour assessment due to patient withdrawal. Although speculative, these differences may 
be due to a chance imbalance between the treatment groups in the underlying life expectancy. While it 
is questionable whether early deaths, treatment withdrawals and losses to follow-up can be considered 
as uninformative about the likelihood of response as per RECIST v1.1, the applicant’s missing-at-random 
analysis provides a helpful benchmark: Whereas the primary analysis may have underestimated the ORR 
of  EU-Avastin  as  compared  with  CT-P16  by  considering  all  of  the  early  deaths  and  withdrawals  as 
evidence of non-response, the missing at random analysis corresponds to a somewhat opposite scenario 
that likely is overly optimistic about EU-Avastin’s ORR relative to CT-P16. Both analyses lead to the same 
conclusion concerning similar efficacy.

Based on the analysis provided in response to D120 LoQ, the distribution and patterns of individual target 
tumour size % changes during the induction period, based on centralised assessment of radiographs, 
were visually similar between CT-P16 and EU-Avastin. Not only were the proportions of responders as 
RECIST v1.1 similar in the two treatment groups but also the degree of shrinkage (or growth) among 
responders and non-responders appeared similar in both treatment groups. 
The concordance of local and central assessment of tumour response can be considered acceptable and 
in line with the level concordance typically reported in NSCLC clinical trials applying RECIST 1.1. 
The post-hoc analysis of ORR by treatment cycle showed similar response rates between the treatment 
groups  in  the  ITT  population.  A  difference  of  about  4%  was  noted  in  the  PP  population  for  Induction 
Cycle 6, but the 95% CI’s for the Induction Cycle 6 risk differences were contained with the pre-specified 
equivalence margin for both populations. 
Analyses for time-dependent endpoints (PFS, OS) were provided within the applicant’s response to the 
D120  LoQ  and  additional  PFS  analyses  were  provided  in  response  to  the  D180  LoQ.  In  general,  the 
analyses,  following  a  data  lock  when  the  last  enrolled  patient  had  completed  1  year  of  follow-up, 
demonstrate very similar results in both treatment groups and can in principle be considered to provide 
additional support for the claim of biosimilarity between CT-P16 and EU-Avastin.  
Changes on quality of life -related endpoints were generally small, with high interindividual variability. 
No  robust  conclusion  can  be  made,  but  no  concerning  differences  between  treatment  groups  can  be 
identified.  The  worsening  alopecia  and  peripheral  neuropathy  can  reasonably  be  ascribed  to  the 
concomitant chemotherapy. 
Based on a forest plot for risk difference based on ITRC ORR by stratification factors as well as other 
relevant subgroups, the results with respect to absolute response rates or treatment differences appear 
consistent across the subgroups explored. 
2.4.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Clinical efficacy data to support biosimilarity of CT-P16 with EU-Avastin stems from the ongoing study 
CT-P16 3.1, conducted in patients with metastatic or recurrent nsNSCLC. The design and other general 
characteristics of the study are considered fit for the purpose of demonstrating biosimilarity. The primary 
endpoint was ORR (based on BOR) during the Induction Study Period. For the ITT and the PP populations, 
the reported CT-P16 – EU-Avastin risk differences of 0.40 (95% CI -7.02, 7.83) and -1.90 (95% CI -
9.80, 6.00), respectively, were entirely contained within the pre-specified equivalence margin of -12.5 
to 12.5. As such, the primary analysis can be considered to support biosimilarity, and available sensitivity 
analyses support this view. The analyses for time-dependent endpoints (PFS, OS) can also be considered 
supportive of biosimilarity. 
In conclusion, CT-P16 can be considered biosimilar to EU-Avastin from a clinical efficacy perspective. 
2.4.8.  Clinical safety 
The  safety  information  is  based  primarily  on  data  from  Study  CT-P16  3.1  in  nsNSCLC  patients,  from 
Study CT-P16 1.1 in healthy subjects (pivotal PK study) and supportive information from CT-P16 1.2 in 
healthy Japanese subjects. Study CT-P16 3.1 in nsNSCLC patients is ongoing and has been completed 
up to 1 year from the last enrolled patient. Clinical data up to the cut-off date (21 September 2021) has 
been  provided  by  the  applicant  that  includes  complete  data  for  all  patients  through  Induction  Study 
Period  and  data  for  a  total  of  148  (21.5%)  patients  who  have  completed  1  year  of  treatment  (≥ 
Maintenance Cycle 12).

Most of the TEAEs were of grade 1 or grade 2 in severity while total of 6 TEAEs observed in 4 subjects 
(2.8%; 2 subjects [4.3%] in each of the CT-P16 and the EU-Avastin treatment groups) were of grade 3 
or 4 severity. Among the TEAEs of grade 3 or 4 in severity, 2 TEAEs of grade 4 (blood CPK increased and 
hyperuricaemia)  observed  in  the  EU-Avastin  treatment  group  were  considered possibly  related  to  the 
study drug. All other TEAEs of grade 3 or 4 severity were considered unrelated to the study drug. 
Study CT-P16 1.2 
Overall, 2 (9.1%) subjects in the CT-P16 and 3 (12.5%) subjects in the EU-Avastin treatment group 
experienced at least 1 TEAE. Treatment emergent adverse events considered related to the study drug 
were reported for 1 (4.5%) subject in the CT-P16 treatment group [drug eruption] and 1 (4.2%) subject 
in the EU-Avastin treatment group [nausea and dizziness]). All TEAEs were recovered before or at the 
end-of-study (EOS) visit. 
All TEAEs, regardless of relationship to study drugs, were reported once each. Food allergy and drug 
eruption were each reported by 1 (4.5%) subject in the CT-P16 treatment group. Nausea and dizziness, 
AST  increased  and  CPK  increased,  and  periodontitis  were  reported  by  1  (4.2%)  subject  each  in  the 
EU-Avastin treatment group. 
One  TEAE  was  grade  4  in  severity  (blood  CPK  increased),  1  TEAE  was  grade  3  in  severity  (AST 
increased), and 1 TEAE was grade 2 in severity (periodontitis). The TEAEs with grades 2, 3, and 4 were 
reported in the EU-Avastin treatment group and were considered unrelated to the study drug. All other 
reported TEAEs were grade 1 in severity. The TEAEs with grade 1 were considered related to the study 
drug  regardless  of  the  treatment  group  except  for  1  TEAE  of  food  allergy  reported  in  the  CT-P16 
treatment group, which was considered unrelated to the study drug.

•  No cases of TEAESI due to ovarian failure/fertility were reported. 
Study CT-P16 1.1 and 1.2 
In Studies CT-P16 1.1 and CT-P16 1.2 conducted in healthy subjects, an AESI was pre-defined as an 
event of hypersensitivity/IRR.  
Study CT-P16 1.1: In the CT-P16 and the EU-Avastin treatment groups, 2 (4.3%) subjects reported an 
IRR in each group and there were 4 (8.3%) subjects reported in the US-Avastin treatment group. All 
observed IRRs were related to the study drug and were grade 1 in severity. All subjects recovered from 
IRR without any medication and no subject discontinued due to the event. 
Study CT-P16 1.2: No cases of hypersensitivity/IRR were reported. 
2.4.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
An abnormality of the test result for clinical laboratory parameters, e.g. clinical chemistry, haematology, 
urinalysis and coagulation, was reported as a TEAE if it was determined to be clinically significant by the 
investigator or if the investigator reported the result as a TEAE.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636045/2022

The majority of laboratory parameters in the clinical studies had no CTCAE grade, i.e. the post-baseline 
laboratory  result  did  not  satisfy  any  CTCAE  grade  criteria,  or  were  CTCAE  grade  1  (mild)  or  grade  2 
(moderate). 
Study CT-P16 3.1 
The most frequently reported grade 3 or higher clinical chemistry parameter was hypertriglyceridemia; 
grade  3  was  reported  for  17  (4.9%)  patients  and  20  (5.8%)  patients,  and  grade  4  for  6  (1.7%)  and 
8 (2.3%) patients in the CT-P16 and the EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively. 
The most frequently reported grade 3 or higher haematology parameter was neutrophil count decreased; 
grade 3 was reported for 27 (7.8%) and 26 (7.6%) patients, and grade 4 for 12 (3.5%) and 9 (2.6%) 
patients  in  the  CT-P16  and  the  EU-Avastin  treatment  groups,  respectively.  Most  of  grade  3  or  higher 
haematology parameters in both treatment groups were reported during the Induction Study Period. 
Study CT-P16 1.1 and 1.2 
The laboratory parameters with CTCAE grade 3 or 4 are shown in Table 34 and Table 35.

Vital signs, Physical Examination, ECG and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Study CT-P16 3.1 
Mean changes from baseline in vital sign (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory 
rate,  body  temperature)  and  body  weight  measurements  were  small,  and  there  were  no  notable 
differences between the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin treatment groups.  
The  majority  of  patients  had  normal  baseline  physical  examination  results  that  remained  normal 
throughout  the  study  periods.  The  most  commonly  reported  abnormalities  at  baseline  were  in  the 
respiratory system (148 [42.9%] patients in the CT-P16 and 162 [47.1%] patients in the EU-Avastin 
treatment  group),  which were  mostly  related  to  lung  cancer.  There  were notable  shifts  from baseline 
from  normal  to  abnormal  in  the  head,  ears,  eyes,  nose,  throat  system  and  the  neurological  system, 
mostly  related  to  alopecia  and  numbness  or  neuropathy,  respectively,  with  no  notable  differences 
between the 2 treatment groups. 
The majority of patients had normal ECG findings. Minor changes from baseline, regarded as clinically 
non-significant, were observed in both groups. Altogether, 2 (0.6%) patients in the CT-P16 group and 
1 (0.3%) patient in the EU-Avastin group was reported for clinically significant abnormal ECG results at 
any time point after study drug administration with normal ECG recording at baseline. 
From  hypersensitivity  monitoring,  the  most  commonly  reported  clinically notable  vital  sign  result  was 
high respiratory rate (≥ 20 breaths per minute). It was reported for a marked proportion at several time 
points throughout the hypersensitivity monitoring, with no notable differences between the CT-P16 and 
the EU-Avastin treatment groups. 
Studies CT-P16 1.1 and 1.2 
No notable differences across the treatment groups were seen in vital sign results, physical examinations 
and ECGs.

The  applicant  followed  the  EMA  guideline  “Guideline  on  immunogenicity  assessment  of  therapeutic 
proteins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev 1)” and the immunogenicity of CT-P16 was assessed in 
1 primary PK similarity study conducted in healthy male subjects (Study CT-P16 1.1), in 1 supportive 
Japanese PK similarity study (Study CT-P16 1.2) and in 1 Phase 3 therapeutic similarity study conducted 
in patients with metastatic or recurrent nsNSCLC (Study CT-P16 3.1).  
The drug tolerance of both ADA assays was sufficient to detect 50.0 ng/mL of ADA in most patients in 
study CT-P16 3.1 and in all patients after D15 in study CT-P16 1.1.   
In Study CT-P16 3.1 most ADA positive subjects had drug concentrations > 25.0 μg/mL and NAb levels 
lower  than  2000  ng/mL  could  not  have  been  detected  without  interference  of  drug  in  any  patient  in 
Study CT-P16 3.1. 
Frequencies and titres of ADA and NAb 
Healthy subjects 
In Study CT-P16 1.1 overall 7 subjects (5.0%) reported at least 1 positive ADA at any time point post 
dose;  2  subjects  (4.3%),  2  subjects  (4.3%)  and  3  subjects  (6.3%)  in  the  CT-P16,  EU-Avastin,  and 
US-Avastin treatment groups, respectively. NAb results were negative for all these subjects.  
No subject in study CT-P16 1.2 had a positive ADA test result on any day in either treatment group. 
Study CT-P16 3.1 
ADA and NAb frequencies in patients with nsNSCLC are summarised in Table 36. Post-treatment incidence 
of  ADA  formation  was  74  (21.4%)  and  80  (23.3%)  in  the  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  treatment  groups, 
respectively.

Table 36. Summary of Immunogenicity Results in Study CT-P16 3.1 (Safety Population) 
The  ADA  titre  results  up  to  Induction  Cycle  6  were  presented  in  the  Integrated  Summary  of 
Immunogenicity (Module 2.7). The mean and the median values of ADA titre were similar between the 
two treatment groups at each timepoint. The titres of ADA were generally low and the ADA titre kinetics 
were similar between the two treatment groups. Neither ADA progression over time nor transiency of 
ADA was seen in any of the treatment arms. A majority of subjects who were ADA positive on more than 
one occasion (n=63) were also ADA positive at the EOT visit if ADA was assessed (4/7 and 10/14 for 
CT-P16 and EU-Avastin, respectively). 
 Impact of ADA on clinical outcome 
Impact of ADA on PK 
In  the  subjects  with  negative  ADA  status,  the  mean  serum  concentrations  are  slightly  higher  in  the 
EU-Avastin group at induction cycles 2 and 4 than in the CT-P16 group and at induction cycles 1 and 6 
the mean serum concentration is slightly higher in the CT-P16 group than in the EU-Avastin group. In 
the subjects with positive ADA status, the trend in mean serum concentrations is similar as in the subjects 
with  negative  ADA  status.  The  number  of  subjects  with  positive  ADA  status  can  be  considered  small 
(n = 3-10 per group depending on the cycle) and to draw conclusions of impact of ADAs on PK is not 
possible.  
The applicant was asked to provide a figure, in which the mean serum concentrations (µg/L) at different 
cycles are shown by the visit-based ADA status of patients. The applicant provided in the response to 
the  D120  questions,  acceptable  figures  in  relation  to  the  mean  serum  concentrations  by  ADA  status. 
Additionally, descriptive statistics of serum concentration in the maintenance study period by visit-based 
ADA status were presented. The number of ADA-positive patients was small in the study and it can be

bevacizumab.

Objective  response  rate  was  defined  as  the  proportion  of  patients  whose  best  overall  response  was  CR  or  PR 
(considered as the ‘Responder’). All other patients except responders were considered as non-responder including 
patients without postbaseline disease assessment. 
Abbreviation:  ADA,  anti-drug  antibody;  CI,  confidence  interval;  CR,  complete  response;  ORR,  objective  response

In the CT-P16 treatment group, the difference in ORR was observed for ADA-positive subgroup (31.25%) 
and ADA-negative subgroup (46.18%) with ORR appearing to decrease for the ADA-positive subgroup. 
In the EU-Avastin treatment group, ORR was similar regardless of ADA status as ORR was 50.00% for 
the  ADA-positive  subgroup  and  47.06%  for  the  ADA-negative  subgroup.  Although  a  difference  was 
observed between the 2 treatment groups the results should be considered in context of the small and 
fragmented dataset. The trends in DOR and PFS by ADA status was the opposite of the observed trend 
in  ORR  during  the  Induction  Study  Period;  thus,  the  comparison  of  Duration  of  Response  (DOR)  and 
Progression-Free  Survival  (PFS)  showed  no  relevant  effect  of  ADA  on  the  efficacy  endpoints  in  any 
treatment group. 
Impact of ADA on safety 
Within each treatment arm the incidence of serious treatment emergent adverse events is slightly lower 
among patients with positive ADA results than in those with negative results. The incidence of AEs seems 
comparable between treatment arms among both ADA positive and ADA negative subjects. ADA positivity 
does not seem to correlate with development of IRR.

2.4.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The applicant has provided safety data from three clinical studies; a pivotal Phase 3 study CT-P16 3.1 in 
patients with metastatic or recurrent nsNSCLC, Phase 1 PK study CT-P16 1.1 in healthy male subjects 
and a supportive PK study CT-P16 1.2 in healthy Japanese subjects.   
The  development  of  CT-P16  was  discussed  with  DKMA  and  MPA  in  February  2016  and  EMA  Scientific 
Advice was received in July 2016 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/476333/2016). Further, the global development of 
CT-P16 has been discussed with the FDA.  
From the safety perspective, the design of the conducted Phase 3 study as well as the safety assessments 
included in the clinical studies are considered to be sufficiently aligned with the EMA Scientific Advice 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/476333/2016)  and  adequate.  The  Phase  3  study  (CT-P16  3.1)  is  ongoing  and  has 
been  completed  up  to  1  year  from  the  last  enrolled  patient.  Clinical  data  up  to  the  cut-off  date 
(21 September 2021) has been provided by the applicant that includes complete data for all patients 
through Induction Study Period and data for a total of 148 (21.5%) patients who have completed 1 year 
of treatment (≥ Maintenance Cycle 12).  
The safety evaluations were planned according to the known safety profile of Avastin, considering the 
adverse reactions presented in the SmPC and AESIs identified for Avastin e.g. in the RMP for Avastin. 
The  safety  analyses  were conducted  on  safety  population,  consisting of  all  subjects  receiving  at  least 
1 dose of either CT-P16 or Avastin. The safety data for the Phase 3 study CT-P16 is presented separately 
for the induction study period (combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin), maintenance study period 
(monotherapy),  follow-up  period  and  whole  study  period.  In  general,  the  safety  data  has  not  been 
pooled, but presented separately for the 3 clinical studies, which is acceptable. 
In the Phase 3 study CT-P16 3.1, a total of 689 patients with nsNSCLC received at least one dose of the 
study drug, 345 patients in the CT-P16 treatment group and 344 patients in the EU-Avastin treatment 
group. In addition, 141 healthy subjects received a single dose of CT-P16 (n=46), EU-Avastin (n=47) or 
US-Avastin (n=48) in the pivotal PK study CT-P16 1.1 and 46 healthy subjects received a single dose of 
CT-P16 (n=22) or EU-Avastin (n=24) in the supportive PK study CT-P16 1.2.  
In terms of drug exposure, some imbalances between the treatment groups were observed in number 
of patients that received the study drug after the first induction cycle. At cycle 1: 100% and 100%; at 
cycle 2: 95.7% and 92.2%; at cycle 3: 89.6% and 80.5%, and at the last induction cycle 6: 76.2% and 
69.8% of the patients in CT-P16 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively, received the study drug. 
This was also reflected in higher number of patients receiving concomitant paclitaxel and carboplatin in 
the CT-P16 group. Consequently, more patients in the CT-P16 than in the EU-Avastin group continued 
to receive the study drug during the maintenance period. The administered dose intensities were similar 
in both study groups, including chemotherapy during the induction period. In the PK studies CT-P16 1.1 
and CT-P16 1.2, all subjects received full dose of the study drug. 
Overall, the size of the safety population included in the clinical studies can be considered sufficient to 
allow  a  meaningful  comparison  of  safety  and  immunogenicity  between  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  in  the 
context of a biosimilar MAA. 
In the Phase 3 study CT-P16 3.1, the patient demographics were comparable between the study groups 
(CT-P16 and EU-Avastin) in terms of mean age (61.3 and 61.5 years, respectively), gender (65.2% and 
64.0% males), race (77.2% and 76.1% white) and other characteristics. The majority of patients had a 
metastatic disease (92.7% and 90.5%) and ECOG Grade 1 performance status (69.3% and 68.3%). The 
pathological  diagnosis  was  adenocarcinoma  in  almost  all  cases  (98.2%  and  98.0%,  respectively)  and 
clinical stage in most cases either stage IVA (43.0% and 47.3%, respectively) or Stage IVB (49.7% and 
42.9%,  respectively).  In  general,  the  study  groups  were  comparable  in  terms  of  medical  history  and 
Assessment report

previous  treatments,  but  some  minor  differences  were  observed  between  study  groups  (CT-P16  and 
EU-Avastin)  e.g.  in  number  of  patients  with  previous  lung  lobectomy  (5.8%  and  9.2%)  and  previous 
cytotoxic chemotherapy (1.8% and 2.9%). Overall, the demographics and baseline characteristics were 
sufficiently balanced between the treatment groups in all three clinical studies.  
Adverse events in the Phase 3 study CT-P16 3.1: 
At least 1 TEAE was reported for 96.2% and 93.0% and treatment related TEAEs for 51.6% and 50.6% 
of patients in the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin groups, respectively.  
In terms of common TEAEs by SOC, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were reported for 67.0% 
and 65.4%, nervous system disorders for 52.5% and 47.4%, blood and lymphatic system disorders for 
50.4%  and  42.2%,  gastrointestinal  disorders  for  44.9%  and  40.7%,  and  general  disorders  and 
administration site conditions for 41.2% and 34.9% of patients in the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin groups, 
respectively.  
In terms of common TEAEs by PT, alopecia was reported for 63.8% and 63.4%, anaemia for 31.6% and 
27.0%,  neutropenia  for  21.7%  and  16.0%,  nausea  for  21.4%  and  18.9%,  asthenia  for  18.3%  and 
15.7%,  thrombocytopenia  for  18.3%  and  13.7%  of  patients  in  the  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  groups, 
respectively. A vast majority of these TEAEs were reported during the induction period. 
Of the common related TEAEs by PT, proteinuria was reported for 10.4% and 9.3%, anaemia for 7.2% 
and 8.4%, hypertension for 7.2% and 7.3%, alopecia for 6.7% and 6.1%, thrombocytopenia for 6.4% 
and  2.6%,  and  neutropenia  for  3.8%  and  5.2%  of  patients  in  the  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  groups, 
respectively. The frequency of related TEAEs were comparable between the study groups, i.e. at least 1 
related TEAE was reported for 51.6% and 50.6% of patients in the CT-P16 and the EU-Avastin treatment 
groups, respectively. 
Overall,  the  frequency  of  common  TEAEs  was  somewhat  higher  in  the  CT-P16  group  compared  to 
EU-Avastin  group  both  during  the  induction  (95.1%  vs  91.6%)  and  maintenance  periods  (50.7%  vs 
45.1%). At least 5% difference was reported for CT-P16 vs. EU-Avastin in SOCs blood and lymphatic 
system disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions and nervous system disorders. 
TEAEs from these SOCs were analysed further by the applicant and it can be concluded that the higher 
frequency  of  TEAEs  in  the  CT-P16  vs.  EU-Avastin  group  was  mainly  driven  by  chemotherapy-related 
TEAEs during the induction period. As discussed above, more patients in the CT-P16 group than in the 
EU-Avastin groups received the study drug and chemotherapy after the first cycle during the induction 
period. Consequently, more patients in the CT-P16 group continued to receive the study drug during the 
maintenance period. Given that the frequencies (%) for the TEAEs were calculated from the total safety 
population (i.e. all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug), it is likely that the imbalance in 
drug exposure contributed to the observed numerical difference in the TEAEs between the study groups. 
Importantly, no major differences in the frequency of study drug-related TEAEs were observed during 
the induction or maintenance periods in the three SOCs analysed.  
At least 1 ≥ Grade 3 TEAE was reported for 43.8% and 41.9% of patients in the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin 
groups, respectively. The most common ≥ Grade 3 TEAE was neutropenia, reported for 10.4% and 7.3% 
of patients in the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin groups, respectively. Dyspnoea was reported for 7 vs 0 patients 
(6  vs  0  during  maintenance  period)  and  pulmonary  embolism  for  6  vs  3  of  patients  (2  vs  0  during 
maintenance period) in the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin groups, respectively. When examining the risk factors 
for the patients that experienced dyspnoea during the maintenance period, most notably, 12 (75%) vs. 
4 (40%) of the patients in CT-P16 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively, reported dyspnoea 
already  at  screening.  Some  further  imbalances  in  the  risk  factors  were  also  observed,  e.g.  more 
unfavourable  smoking  history  in  CT-P16  group,  and altogether these  imbalances  can  be  considered a 
plausible  reason  for  the  observed  difference  in  the  grade  ≥  3  cases  between  the  study  groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636045/2022  
Page 98/109 
 
 
 
Importantly,  all  grade  ≥  3  events  of  dyspnoea  were  considered  unrelated  to  the  study  drug  by  the 
investigator.  
TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation was reported for 15.9% and 16.0% of the patients in the 
CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  groups,  respectively.  The  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  was 
pulmonary  embolism,  in  8  (2.3%)  and  2  (0.6%),  proteinuria  in  3  (0.9%)  and  5  (1.5%),  and 
thrombocytopenia in 2 (0.6%) and 4 (1.2%) patients in the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin groups, respectively. 
All other TEAEs that led to discontinuation, were reported for less than 1% of subjects in each group. 
Except for the numerical difference in the pulmonary embolism cases, the safety profile based on TEAEs 
that led to discontinuation was similar between the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin group.  
In the Phase 3 study CT-P16 3.1, the number of patients that died was 23 (6.7%) and 24 (7.0%) in 
CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  treatment  groups,  respectively.  Number  of  patients  with  drug-related  TESAE 
leading  to  death  was  higher  in  the  EU-Avastin  group,  i.e.  3  (0.9%)  and  7  (2.0%)  of  the  cases  were 
regarded as study drug-related in the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin groups, respectively. All, except one study-
drug related death occurred during the induction study period.  
TESAEs were reported in 20.0% and 21.2% and related TESAEs in 5.2% and 6.7% of patients in the 
CT-P16 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively. The most common TESAEs were pneumonia in 
2.3%  and  2.9%,  febrile  neutropenia  in  1.7%  and  0.6%,  COVID-19  pneumonia  in  1.4%  and  1.2%, 
neutropenia in 1.4% and 0.3% and pulmonary embolism in 1.4% and 0.3% of patients in the CT-P16 
and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively. 
Overall, the number of deaths, other TESAEs and related TESAEs were comparable between CT-P16 and 
EU-Avastin treatment groups in the Phase 3 study CT-P16 3.1. No deaths or other TESAEs were reported 
in the PK studies CT-P16 1.1 and 1.2. The applicant has provided full narratives of TESAEs and deaths, 
where the cases are adequately described. 
The  AESIs  were  adequately  pre-defined  based  on  known  safety  profile  of  Avastin  as  described  in  the 
SmPC of Avastin, as well as important identified and potential risks in the RMP of Avastin. In the Phase 3 
study CT-P16 3.1, the following AESIs were included: hypersensitivity/infusion-related reactions (IRR), 
gastrointestinal  perforations  and  fistulae,  wound  healing  complications,  hypertension,  posterior 
reversible  encephalopathy  syndrome  (PRES),  proteinuria,  arterial  thromboembolism  (ATE),  venous 
thromboembolism  (VTE),  hemorrhages,  congestive  heart  failure  (CHF),  and  ovarian  failure/fertility. 
Overall, apart from the numerical differences in pulmonary embolism discussed above, the frequency of 
most AESIs was similar between the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin treatment groups. 
In general, no major differences were observed in the clinical laboratory evaluations between the study 
groups. The mean values over time in haematology laboratory parameters followed a similar pattern in 
both  groups,  with  no  major  differences  between  the  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin.  By  CTCAE  grading, 
numerically  slightly  more  (mainly  grades  1-2)  anaemia,  neutrophil  count  decreased,  platelet  count 
decreased and white blood cell decreased was reported in CT-P16 vs. EU-Avastin group, which is in line 
with the observations related to the TEAEs under SOC Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders.  
Data on vital signs, physical examination and ECG did not reveal any notable differences between the 
study groups. 
In summary, the safety of CT-P16 was consistent with the known safety profile of Avastin with or without 
chemotherapy that was used during the induction phase in the Phase 3 study CT-P16 3.1. As discussed 
above,  some  numerical  differences  were  observed  in  the  TEAEs  between  the  study  groups,  but 
considering  the  safety  data  as  a  whole,  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  can  be  concluded  to  be  biosimilar  in 
terms of safety.

Adverse events in the PK Phase 1 studies CT-P16 1.1 and 1.2: 
Of the 141 healthy subjects included in the safety population in Study CT-P16 1.1, at least 1 TEAE was 
reported  for  50.0%,  72.3%  and  54.2%  of  subjects,  treatment  related  TEAEs  for  19.6%,  42.6%  and 
33.3%  and  ≥  Grade  3  TEAEs  for  4.3%,  4.3%  and  0%  of  subjects  in  the  CT-P16,  EU-Avastin  and 
US-Avastin groups, respectively.  
In terms of common TEAEs by PT in Study CT-P16 1.1, diarrhoea was reported for 6.5%, 12.8% and 
8.3%,  blood  CPK  increased  for  6.5%,  10.6%  and  8.3%,  CRP  increased  for  4.3%,  10.6%  and  8.3%, 
nasopharyngitis for 8.7%, 2.1% and 12.5%, and IRR for 4.3%, 4.3% and 8.3% of subjects in the CT-P16, 
EU-Avastin and US-Avastin groups, respectively. All other TEAEs were reported for ≤3 subjects in each 
group.  Of the common related TEAEs by PT, diarrhoea was reported for 6.5%, 12.8% and 4.2%, and 
CRP increased for 2.2%, 8.5% and 8.3% of subjects in the CT-P16, EU-Avastin and US-Avastin groups, 
respectively. TEAEs of ≥ Grade 3 was observed in 2 subjects (4.3%) in CT-P16 and EU-Avastin groups.  
Of the 46 healthy subjects included in the safety population in study CT-P16 1.2, TEAEs were reported 
for 2 subjects (9.1%) in the CT-P16 groups and 3 subjects (12.5%) in the EU-Avastin group. Related 
TEAEs were reported for 1 subject in the CT-P16 group (drug eruption) and 1 subject in the EU-Avastin 
group (nausea and dizziness). Two TEAEs of ≥ Grade 3 were reported for 1 subject in the EU-Avastin 
group (AST increased and blood CPK increased).   
In the PK studies CT-P16 1.1 and 1.2, no TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation, deaths or other 
TESAEs  were  reported.  Only  individual  grade  ≥  3  laboratory  findings  were  seen,  with  no  relevant 
differences between the study groups. 
Overall,  although  some  numerical  differences  in  the  TEAEs  were  seen  in  the  single  dose  PK  studies 
between study groups, there were no findings that were considered relevant in the context of similarity 
assessment of safety. 
Immunological events: 
The proportion of healthy subjects who had post-dose ADA positive results was 4.3% in both CT-P16 
and EU-Avastin treated subjects in study 1.1. The low proportion of ADA positive subjects in this study 
is in line with historical studies with bevacizumab. NAb results were negative for all healthy subjects. Of 
note, due to weak drug tolerance of the NAb assay, no meaningful NAb detection was possible at Day 15 
and Day 43 in these two studies.   
In study CT-P16 1.2 no subject had a positive ADA test result on any day in either treatment group. The 
applicant pointed out that the lack of ADA detection in Study CT-P16 1.2 was probably due to the low 
sample  size  and  the  generally  low  incidence  of  anti-bevacizumab  antibodies.  The  applicant  further 
provided literature data from other phase 1 studies with similar results. 
In the phase III study 3.1 no meaningful difference in post-treatment ADA or NAb incidence was observed 
between the two treatment groups. The prevalence of ADA positive patients at each time point was low 
(< 5%) and in line with historical studies. The overall ADA incidence was 78 (22.6%) and 83 (24.1%) 
for the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively. The titres of ADA were generally low and 
the  ADA  titre  kinetics  were  similar  between  the  two  treatment  groups.  Neither  ADA  progression  over 
time  nor  transiency  of  ADA  was  seen  in  any  of  the  treatment  arms.  As  the  number  of  ADA  positive 
subjects in each treatment arm can be considered small (n = 1-17 depending on the cycle), it is not 
possible to draw conclusions on the impact of ADAs on PK.  No relevant effect of ADA on the efficacy or 
safety endpoints could be determined in any treatment group.

2.4.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In summary, the safety and immunogenicity of CT-P16 was consistent with the known safety profile of 
Avastin with or without chemotherapy that was used during the induction phase in the Phase 3 study 
CT-P16  3.1.  Considering  the  safety  data  as  a  whole,  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  can  be  concluded  to  be 
biosimilar in terms of safety and immunogenicity.

Summary of quality comparability data 
A comprehensive similarity exercise following the general principles outlined in the guideline on similar 
biological  medicinal  products  containing  biotechnology-derived  proteins  as  active  substance;  Quality 
issues  (EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012)  has  been  performed.  Ten  independent  CT-P16  DP  batches 
representative  of  the  commercial  scale  and  10  EU-approved  Avastin  batches  were  included  in  the 
similarity study. The batches reflected a range of expiration dates and product ages. The DP material 
used in the analytical biosimilarity studies is considered representative of the material used in clinical 
trials. The similarity analyses were performed side-by-side using qualified in-house reference standard 
(P2-RF-JPP01). A ±3*SD quality range was set by analysis of 10 batches of EU-approved Avastin for key 
biological  quality  attributes.  Results  of  physicochemical  analyses  were  presented  without  statistical 
analysis; instead the mean and SD as well as the spread of the underlying distribution from quantitative 
analyses  have  been  compared  and  differences  have  been  highlighted  and  discussed.  In  addition,  raw 
data has been provided to allow assessment of biosimilarity independently of statistical approach chosen. 
Analytical  comparability  studies  included  primary  and  higher  order  structures,  post-translational 
modifications,  glycation  and  glycosylation,  charge  heterogeneity,  purity/impurity,  content,  biological 
activity of Fab and Fc related functions, and comparative forced degradation studies.  
Summary of nonclinical comparability data 
A comprehensive in vitro similarity exercise included biological activity of Fab and Fc -related functions 
of bevacizumab presented and described under quality comparability data. A supportive four weeks of 
duration repeated toxicology study with toxicokinetic analysis in cynomolgus monkeys comparing CT-P16 
to EU-Avastin of was conducted. 
Summary of clinical comparability data 
One pivotal PK study (i.e. CT-P16 1.1) was conducted: a single-dose (i.e. 5 mg /kg IV infusion for 90 min) 
randomised, double-blind, 3-arm, parallel study in healthy subjects comparing CT-P16, EU-Avastin and 
US-Avastin (N  ~ 46-48 subjects administered/group). Supportive PK data was obtained from a  study 
with healthy Japanese subjects (i.e. study CT-P16 1.2) and with nsNSCLC patients in the clinical efficacy 
and safety study CT-P16 3.1.   
The main efficacy and safety study CT-P16 3.1 is an ongoing double-blind, randomised, active-controlled, 
parallel group Phase 3 study to compare the efficacy, PK, and overall safety of CT-P16 (15 mg/kg) and 
Assessment report

EU-Avastin (15 mg/kg) when co-administered with paclitaxel and carboplatin as first-line treatment in 
patients with metastatic or recurrent nsNSCLC. 
In general, the clinical programme for Vegzelma is consistent with relevant CHMP Guidance concerning 
development of biosimilars. 
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality data 
Similarity between CT-P16 and EU-approved Avastin has been demonstrated for the following physico-
chemical and biological properties: 
- 
Primary structure 
-  Content  
-  Charge heterogeneity 
-  Glycan profile 
-  Size heterogeneity and purity/impurity profile 
-  Antiproliferation activity, and binding to VEGF-A165 and VEGF-A121 
-  Binding to FcγRIIIa (F-type, V-type), FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRI, FcRn, C1q 
-  ADCC and CDC activity  
- 
Inhibition of VEGFR2 RTK autophosphorylation 
-  Binding to VEGF-A isoforms (VEGF-A145, VEGF-A189, VEGF-A206) and VEGF family (VEGF-B, -C, -D, 
and -E; PlGF-1 and -2) 
-  Stability under forced degradation 
Minor  differences  in  the  levels  of  post-translational  modifications  (deamidation,  oxidation,  N-terminal 
pyroglutamic  acid,  C-terminal  lysine,  proline  amidation),  free  thiol  groups,  relative  proportion  of  the 
charge variants, individual fucosylated glycan species, levels of glycation, and levels of monomer, HMW, 
LMW, HC+LC and NGHC were sufficiently justified to have no clinical impact. 
Nonclinical data 
Similarity between CT-P16 and EU-approved Avastin was demonstrated for the functional properties as 
described  above under  Quality  data  (antiproliferation  activity,  binding to  VEGF-A165  and  VEGF-A121, 
binding  to  FcγR  subtypes,  FcRn,  C1q,  ADCC  and  CDC  activity,  Inhibition  of  VEGFR2  RTK 
autophosphorylation  and  binding  to  other  VEGF-A  isoforms  and  VEGF  family  members).  CT-P16  and 
EU-Avastin did not differ in cynomolgus monkeys on their toxicological and toxicokinetic characteristics.  
Clinical data 
Pharmacokinetics 
In the comparison of PK data (pivotal PK study CT-P16 1.1) for the CT-P16 group with the EU-Avastin 
and US-Avastin treatment groups, the 90% CIs of the geometric LS mean ratios for the three primary 
PK parameters (i.e. Cmax, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf) were all within 80% and 125% (including 100.00). In 
the  comparison  of  the  AUCs  between  EU-Avastin  and  US-Avastin,  the  90%  CIs  were  between  the 
range 80%  -  125%  but  the  range  did  not  include  100.00%.  This  is,  however,  not  any  concern.  The 
sensitivity analysis supported the PK similarity between CT-P16 and EU-Avastin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636045/2022  
Page 104/109 
 
 
 
In the supportive PK study in Japanese subjects the 90% CIs of ratios of geometric LS means of Cmax, 
AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf were entirely contained within the predefined equivalence margin of 80% to 125% 
which indicated that bevacizumab exposures from CT-P16 were similar to those from EU-Avastin. 
The mean trough concentrations were comparable between CT-P16 group and EU-Avastin group (PK data 
up to induction  cycle 6) in nsNSCLC patients in the study CT-P16 3.1. 
Efficacy 
In the clinical efficacy study CT-P16 3.1, CT-P16 and EU-Avastin were compared in a Phase III study in 
nsNSCLC patients. The design and other general characteristics of the study are considered fit for the 
purpose of demonstrating biosimilarity. The primary endpoint was ORR (based on BOR as per central 
review) during the Induction Study Period. For the ITT and the PP populations, the reported CT-P16 – 
EU-Avastin risk differences of 0.40 (95% CI -7.02, 7.83) and -1.90 (95% CI -9.80, 6.00), respectively, 
were entirely contained within the pre-specified equivalence margin of -12.5 to 12.5. Also based on the 
local investigators’ response evaluation, the 95% CI for difference between CT-P16 and EU-Avastin in 
ORR during the Induction Study Period was within the equivalence margin of -12.5 to 12.5 (ITT: 4.87% 
[95 %CI: -2.53 to 12.26]; PP: 2.90% [95 % CI: -4.99 to 10.79]). 
The post-hoc analysis of ORR by treatment cycle showed similar response rates between the treatment 
groups;  at  Induction  Cycle  6,  the  reported  ORR  was  42.69%  (95%  CI  37.45,  47.93)  for  CT-P16  and 
43.52% (95% CI 38.30, 48.73) for EU-Avastin in the ITT population, and 44.97% (95% CI 39.50, 50.44) 
for CT-P16 and 48.84% (95% CI 43.22, 54.47) for EU-Avastin in the PP population. Also in this analysis, 
the  reported  CT-P16  –  EU-Avastin  risk  differences  of  -0.77  (95%  CI  -8.21,  6.68)  and  -3.79 
(95% CI -11.69, 4.11), for the ITT and the PP populations respectively. 
Data on time-dependent endpoints is also supportive of biosimilarity. 
In the ITT population, median PFS was 7.9 [95% CI: 6.9 – 8.3] months and 7.2 [95% CI: 6.5 – 8.3] 
months  for  the  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  treatment  groups,  respectively,  with  a  hazard  ratio  of 
0.92 (95% CI: 0.77 – 1.10). In the PP population, median PFS was 8.3 [95% CI: 7.2 – 8.5] months and 
8.1 [95% CI: 6.8 – 8.6] months for the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively, with a 
hazard  ratio  of  0.93  (95%  CI:  0.76  –  1.12).  With  respect  to  the  comparison  between  CT-P16  and 
EU-Avastin,  similar  results  were  observed  in  additional  PFS  analyses  performed  by  the  applicant  in 
response to D180 LoQ. 
In  the  ITT  population,  median  OS  was  17.1  [95%  CI:  14.6  –  18.7]  months  and  15.6 
[95% CI: 13.4 -  18.0]  months  for  the  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  treatment  groups,  respectively,  with  a 
hazard  ratio  of  0.95  (95%  CI:  0.77  –  1.19).  In  the  PP  population,  median  OS  was 
17.5 [95% CI: 15.5  -  19.2]  months  and  17.0  [95%  CI:  14.6  –  20.5]  months  for  the  CT-P16  and 
EU-Avastin treatment groups, respectively, with a hazard ratio of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.76 – 1.22). 
Safety 
The clinical Safety Population includes data from 689 nsNSCLC patients in Study CT-P16 3.1 that received 
CT-P16  (n=345)  or  EU-Avastin  (n=344).  In  addition,  187  healthy  subjects  received  a  single  dose 
(5 mg/kg) of CT-P16, EU-Avastin or US-Avastin in studies CT-P16 1.1 and 1.2. 
The design of the clinical studies and the safety assessments were adequate, including AESIs, that were 
identified based on the known safety profile of Avastin. The safety data for the Phase 3 study CT-P16 
3.1  was  presented  separately  for  the  induction  study  period  (combination  with  paclitaxel  and 
carboplatin), maintenance study period (monotherapy), follow-up period and whole study period. The 
safety data was not pooled, but presented separately for the three clinical studies. Overall, the size of 
the  safety  population  included  in  the  clinical  studies  can  be  considered  sufficient  and  the  groups 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636045/2022  
Page 105/109 
 
 
 
comparable in terms of demographics and baseline characteristics to allow a meaningful comparison of 
safety between CT-P16 and EU-Avastin in the context of a biosimilar MAA. 
In the Phase 3 study CT-P16 3.1, at least 1 TEAE was reported for 96.2% and 93.0%, treatment related 
TEAEs for 51.6% and 50.6% and ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs for 43.8% and 41.9% of patients in the CT-P16 and 
EU-Avastin groups, respectively. In terms of common TEAEs by SOC, similar frequencies were reported 
in several SOCs, e.g. skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were reported for 67.0% and 65.4% and 
gastrointestinal  disorders  for  44.9%  and  40.7%  of  patients  in  the  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  groups, 
respectively. In terms of most common TEAEs by PT, alopecia was reported for 63.8% and 63.4% of 
patients in the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin groups, respectively. TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation 
was reported for 15.9% and 16.0% of the patients in the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin groups, respectively. 
The number of deaths (6.7% vs 7.0%), other TESAEs (20.0% vs 21.2%) and related TESAEs (5.2% vs 
6.7%), as well as AESIs were generally comparable between CT-P16 and EU-Avastin treatment groups. 
Overall,  although  some  numerical  differences  in  the  TEAEs  were  seen  in  the  single  dose  PK  studies 
(CT-P16 1.1 and 1.2) between study groups, there were no findings that were considered relevant in the 
context of similarity assessment of safety. 
Immunogenicity 
The proportion of healthy subjects who had post-dose ADA positive results was 4.3% in both CT-P16 
and EU-Avastin treated subjects in study 1.1. In study CT-P16 1.2 no subject were ADA positive. 
In the phase III study 3.1 the prevalence of ADA positive patients at each time point was low (< 5%) 
and in line with historical studies. The overall ADA incidence was 78 [22.6%] and 83 [24.1%] for the 
CT-P16 and EU- Avastin treatment groups, respectively. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
Safety 
-  Overall, the frequency of common TEAEs was somewhat higher in the CT-P16 group compared to 
EU-Avastin group in the Phase 3 study CT-P16 3.1. At least 5% difference in the number of patients 
with TEAEs was reported in the CT-P16 vs. EU-Avastin group in SOCs blood and lymphatic system 
disorders (including neutropenia), general disorders and administration site conditions  and nervous 
system disorders. However, more patients were exposed to the CT-16 + chemotherapy vs EU-Avastin 
+  chemotherapy  after  the  first  treatment  cycle  during  the  induction  phase  and  the  numerical 
differences  were  largely  driven  by  the  chemotherapy-related  TEAEs  during  the  induction  period. 
Importantly, no major differences in the frequency of study drug-related TEAEs were observed in 
the three SOCs analysed. 
- 
The most notable difference between study groups were observed in the number of patients with 
≥ Grade 3 dyspnoea which was reported for 7 vs 0 patients in the CT-P16 and EU-Avastin groups, 
respectively. Six (6) out of the 7 cases in the CT-P16 group occurred during the maintenance period. 
In a more thorough analysis of these cases, some imbalances in the baseline factors (e.g. presence 
of dyspnoea already at screening and smoking history) were identified that potentially could explain 
the differences. Further, pulmonary embolism was reported for 8 (2.3%) vs 3 (0.9%), and ≥ Grade 
3  pulmonary  embolism  for  6  (1.7%)  vs  3  (0.9%)  patients  in  the  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  groups, 
respectively,  which  could  not  be  explained  by  imbalance  of  risk  factors  at  baseline.  On  the  other 
hand, e.g. drug related TESAEs leading to death was reported in 7 (2.0%) patients in EU-Avastin 
group  and  in  3  (0.9%)  patients  in  CT-P16  group.  Therefore,  the  numerical  imbalances  in  these 
individual TEAEs were likely a chance finding.

-  None of the findings described above are considered to be uncertainties that would have an impact 
on the conclusion of biosimilarity. 
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
Quality 
A comprehensive similarity exercise following the general principles outlined in the guideline on similar 
biological  medicinal  products  containing  biotechnology-derived  proteins  as  active  substance;  Quality 
issues  (EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012)  has  been  performed.  The  comparability  studies  have  been 
conducted  by  analysing  CT-P16  DP  and  EU-approved  Avastin  side-by-side  (as  possible)  with  qualified 
state of-the-art physicochemical and biological methods.  
For most physicochemical and biological quality attributes high similarity has been demonstrated. Minor 
difference  were  observed  mainly  in  post-translational  modifications,  charge  variants,  glycation  levels, 
and levels of monomer and aggregates, and were without implications to Fab and Fc -related functions. 
The differences were sufficiently justified to have no clinical impact.  
Nonclinical 
Comprehensive similarity exercise following the principles laid down in the guideline on similar biological 
medicinal 
products 
containing  monoclonal 
antibodies 
-nonclinical 
and 
clinical 
issues 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010)  and  containing  biotechnology  derived  medicinal  products  as  active 
substances:  non-clinical  and  clinical  issues  (EMEA/CHMP/42832/2005  Rev  1)  was  performed.  The 
functional comparability data was identical to in vitro comparative data presented under Quality section 
and  was,  in  order  to  avoid  repeating  the  data,  assessed  under  Quality.  This  data  demonstrated  high 
similarity  of  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  in  their  functional  characteristics.  Toxicology  and  toxicokinetic 
analysis in cynomolgus monkeys did not reveal differences between CT-P16 and EU-Avastin, and can be 
considered as supportive data for the similarity. 
Clinical  
Biosimilarity in the pivotal PK study CT-P16 1.1 using healthy subjects has been formally demonstrated 
between  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  and  US-Avastin  as  in  the  primary  PK  parameters  Cmax,  AUC0-last and 
AUC0-inf,  the  90%  CI  for  the  ratio  of  test-to-reference/comparator  fell  within  the  acceptance  range  of 
80.00-125.00%.  Also,  in  the  supportive  PK  study  in  Japanese  subjects  in  the  primary  PK  parameters 
(i.e. Cmax, AUC0- last and AUC0-inf), the 90% CI for the ratio of test-to-reference fell within the acceptance 
range  of  80.00-125.00%.  The  sensitivity  analyses  support  the  biosimilarity.  Additional  support  for 
similarity between CT-P16 and EU-Avastin was obtained in the study in nsNSCLC patients (clinical study 
CT-P16 3.1). The mean Ctrough concentrations were comparable between CT-P16 and EU-Avastin.  
As  indicated  above,  efficacy  data  from  the  nsNSCLC  study  CT-P16  3.1  can  be  considered  to  support 
biosimilarity. The primary endpoint was met, with the risk difference contained within the pre-specified 
equivalence margin, and available sensitivity analyses support this view. This position is supported by 
the analyses for relevant time-dependent endpoints (PFS, OS). 
The  safety  of  CT-P16  was  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  Avastin  with  or  without 
chemotherapy  that  was  used  during  the  induction  phase  in  the  Phase  3  study  CT-P16  3.1.  Some 
numerical differences were observed in the TEAEs between the study groups, but considering the safety 
data  as  a  whole,  CT-P16  and  EU-Avastin  can  be  concluded  to  be  biosimilar  in  terms  of  safety  and 
immunogenicity.

3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
The  applicant  is  claiming  all  indications  approved  for  the  reference  product  Avastin.  In  principle,  it  is 
agreed  that  the  MoA  of  bevacizumab  across  its  approved  indications  is  to  inhibit  VEGF-induced 
angiogenesis and vascular permeability, and there is no evidence to support claims of a unique MoA in 
any  specific  indication.  It  is  thus  agreed  that  extrapolation  to  other  indications  is  appropriate  and 
authorisation can be granted for all indications approved for Avastin. This approach is also consistent 
with regulatory precedence for other previously authorised bevacizumab biosimilars. 
3.6.  Additional considerations  
Not applicable. 
3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Vegzelma is considered biosimilar to the reference product 
Avastin. Therefore, a benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Vegzelma is not similar to Zejula within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Vegzelma is favourable in the following indications: 
Vegzelma in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is indicated for treatment of adult 
patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum. 
Vegzelma in combination with paclitaxel is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with 
metastatic breast cancer. For further information as to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2) status, please refer to section 5.1. 
Vegzelma in combination with capecitabine is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with 
metastatic breast cancer in whom treatment with other chemotherapy options including taxanes or 
anthracyclines is not considered appropriate. Patients who have received taxane and 
anthracycline-containing regimens in the adjuvant setting within the last 12 months should be 
excluded from treatment with Vegzelma in combination with capecitabine. For further information as to 
HER2 status, please refer to section 5.1. 
Vegzelma, in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy, is indicated for first-line treatment of adult 
patients with unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) other 
than predominantly squamous cell histology. 
Vegzelma, in combination with erlotinib, is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent NSCLC with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) 
activating mutations (see section 5.1). 
Vegzelma, in combination with interferon alfa-2a is indicated for first line treatment of adult patients

with advanced and/or metastatic renal cell cancer. 
Vegzelma, in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel is indicated for the front-line treatment of 
adult patients with advanced (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages III 
B, III C and IV) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (see section 5.1). 
Vegzelma, in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or in combination with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel, is indicated for treatment of adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive 
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have not received prior therapy with 
bevacizumab or other vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors or VEGF receptor–targeted 
agents. 
Vegzelma in combination with paclitaxel, topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is indicated for 
the treatment of adult patients with platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or 
primary peritoneal cancer who received no more than two prior chemotherapy regimens and who have 
not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor–targeted 
agents (see section 5.1). 
Vegzelma, in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, paclitaxel and topotecan in 
patients who cannot receive platinum therapy, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
persistent, recurrent, or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix (see section 5.1).

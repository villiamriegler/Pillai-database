1.  Introduction 
On 10 December 2020, the MAH submitted a paediatric dossier for study EP0077, completed on 15 
July 2020, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
UCB is submitting the results of EP0077 in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
(The Paediatric Regulation), which requires UCB to submit information on studies conducted in the 
pediatric population (<18 years of age) treated with brivaracetam (BRV; BRIVIACT®). This report 
summarizes the results for the 1 pediatric patient who enrolled in and completed EP0077.  
The clinical study report (CSR) is based on the full results of this completed postmarketing, prospective 
noninterventional study (NIS) of BRV, designed to collect information on the effectiveness in patients 
with partial-onset seizures (POS) who were treated with BRV in clinical practice after the product was 
marketed in the EU.   
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Three formulations have been developed for commercial use: film-coated tablets for oral 
administration (10, 25, 50, 75, and 100mg), an oral solution (10mg/mL), and a solution for 
intravenous (IV) injection (10mg/mL). Brivaracetam film-coated tablets, oral solution, and solution for 
IV injection show the same area under the concentration-time curve, while the maximum plasma 
concentration is slightly higher after IV administration.  
CHMP comment: 
This report concerns a single paediatric patient. No data of relevance regarding suitability of the 
different pharmaceutical formulations for paediatric use can therefore be derived from this submission. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
EP0077, a postmarketing, prospective noninterventional study (NIS) of BRV, designed to 
collect information on the effectiveness in patients with partial-onset seizures (POS) who were 
treated with BRV in clinical practice after the product was marketed in the EU.

Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary study objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of BRV in patients with epilepsy with 
POS with or without secondary generalization in daily clinical practice. The secondary objective was to 
evaluate seizure control with BRV treatment. 
Study design 
EP0077 was a postmarketing, multinational, multicentre, prospective NIS initiated at 48 sites (43 of 
which enrolled patients) in 9 European countries (Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, 
Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and United Kingdom), with a 12-month Observation Period.  
The patients were followed as per normal clinical practice. No additional clinical diagnostic or 
monitoring procedures were applied. The use of an epilepsy/seizure diary, as standard clinical practice, 
was a requirement to enter the study. The selected questionnaires were to be used if they were part of 
the standard clinical practice at the sites for the management of patients with epilepsy. The choice of 
medical treatment was made independently by the treating physician in the regular course of practice 
and was not influenced by the NIS protocol.  
All visits and assessments were scheduled and conducted per routine clinical practice. It was 
anticipated that each patient would have approximately 4 visits during their participation in this study. 
These visits consisted of:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Visit 1, Baseline, Day 1: represented the first day of BRV treatment  
Visit 2, approximately 3 months after Baseline  
Visit 3, approximately 6 months after Baseline  
Visit 4, approximately 12 months after Baseline, or end of Observation Period 
Study population /Sample size 
It was planned to include 530 patients in the study.  
One pediatric patient was enrolled in study EP0077 thereby fulfilling the requirement of reporting 
pediatric data as outlined in Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 (The Paediatric Regulation). 
Treatments 
Brivaracetam was prescribed according to normal clinical practice and in accordance with the approved 
European Summary of Product Characteristics (ie, indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of 
POS with or without secondary generalization in patients ≥16 years of age with epilepsy). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary variable was BRV retention at 12 months (end of Observation Period). This variable was 
used as a measure of effectiveness.  
The following secondary variables were measured:  
•  BRV retention at 3 and 6 months  
•  Absolute reduction in POS frequency (seizures per 28 days) from Baseline to 3, 6, and 12 
months and end of Observation Period

• 
Percent reduction in POS frequency (seizures per 28 days) from Baseline to 3, 6, and 12 
months and end of Observation Period  
•  Response based on percent reduction in POS (seizures per 28 days) at 3, 6, and 12 months 
and end of Observation Period (response is a reduction of ≥50%)  
•  Seizure freedom at 3, 6, and 12 months and end of Observation Period  
• 
Time to first seizure after first dose of BRV  
The following other variables were measured:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Patient Weighted Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-Form 31 (QOLIE-31-P) total and subscale 
(dimension) scores at 3, 6, and 12 months and end of Observation Period, and change in 
QOLIE-31-P scores from Baseline to 3, 6, and 12 months and end of Observation Period  
Presence of clinically meaningful change from Baseline to 3, 6, and 12 months and end of 
Observation Period in QOLIE-31-P  
EpiTrack® performance at 6 and 12 months  
EpiTrack change category from Baseline to 6 and 12 months and from 6 months to 12 months  
EpiTrack total score at 6 and 12 months and change from Baseline to 6 and 12 months  
EpiTrack total and individual subtest scores at 12 months and change in EpiTrack scores from 
Baseline to 12 months  
•  Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) rating at 3, 6, and 12 months and end of 
Observation Period  
• 
Patient’s Global Impression of Change (PGIC) rating at 3, 6, and 12 months and end of 
Observation Period  
•  Change in drug load (ie, number of products, daily dose per given product, ratio of dose and 
defined daily dose [http://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/], frequency, drug class) of 
antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) from Baseline to 12 months and end of Observation Period 
Statistical Methods 
This was an observational study with descriptive statistics. 
Results  
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
One pediatric patient was included in the study.  
Baseline data 
The pediatric patient was 12.4 years old at the time of first diagnosis of epilepsy (International League 
Against Epilepsy seizure classification IA2 and IA3); the epilepsy etiology was autoimmune. The 
reported reasons for starting the patient on BRV were “behavioural side effects to current AED” and 
“lack of efficacy of current treatment”.  
The pediatric patient’s 28-day adjusted Baseline all seizure and POS seizure frequencies were both 6.3 
seizures; no seizures with secondary generalization were reported during the 3 months prior to the 
first administration of BRV. At BRV initiation, the patient was taking 3 concomitant AEDs

(eslicarbazepine, topiramate, and phenytoin) and had a total of 7 lifetime AEDs. The patient also had 
historical levetiracetam (LEV) use; LEV was discontinued due to insufficient efficacy. The patient did 
not have vagus nerve stimulation. 
Efficacy results 
BRV retention 
The pediatric patient in EP0077 achieved BRV retention at 12 months and their last day of BRV 
administration was on Day 446. 
Seizure frequency-related variables 
Table 1 presents the seizure-related efficacy results for the pediatric patient. 
Table 1 Seizure-related efficacy results for the pediatric patient 
POS=partial-onset seizure  
a Reductions in POS frequency at 3, 6, and 12 months were assessed from Baseline.  
b Response was defined as a ≥50% reduction from Baseline in POS frequency.  
c Seizure freedom at 3, 6, and 12 months was assessed from Baseline. 
The pediatric patient had a 28-day adjusted POS frequency of 6.3 seizures at Baseline, with absolute 
reductions in POS frequency of 2.8, 1.9, and 5.5 seizures per 28 days at Visit 2 (Month 3), Visit 3 
(Month 6), and Visit 4 (Month 12), respectively. The patient did not achieve seizure freedom during the 
study; however, the patient was a responder at Visit 4 (Month 12). 
Time to first seizure 
The pediatric patient had the first seizure after initiation of BRV on Day 21. 
QOLIE-31-P 
The pediatric patient had a lower QOLIE-31-P total score at Visit 4 (Month 12) compared with Visit 3 
(Month 6) (52.2 and 84.3, respectively), indicating worsening of quality of life between these 2 visits. 
Since no Baseline QOLIE-31-P data were available for this patient, changes from Baseline in QOLIE-31-
P scores could not be assessed; Visit 2 (Month 3) QOLIE-31-P data were also not available for this 
patient. 
EpiTrack 
No EpiTrack data were reported for the pediatric patient, as this assessment was not part of standard 
clinical practice at the study site attended by the patient. 
Clinical Global Impression of Change

Based on the CGIC, the clinician considered the pediatric patient’s condition to have very much 
improved at Visit 3 (Month 6) compared with Baseline, and to have been minimally worse at Visit 4 
(Month 12) compared with Baseline. No Visit 2 (Month 3) CGIC data were available for this patient. 
Patient’s Global Impression of Change  
Based on the PGIC, the pediatric patient considered their condition to have very much improved at 
Visit 3 (Month 6) compared with Baseline, and to have been minimally worse at Visit 4 (Month 12) 
compared with Baseline. No Visit 2 (Month 3) PGIC data were available for this patient.  
Change in AED load  
Table 2 presents the total AED load, total number of AEDs, and changes from Baseline for the 
paediatric patient. 
Table 2 Total AED load, total number of AEDs, and changes from Baseline for the pediatric patient 
AED=antiepileptic drug; BRV=brivaracetam; LEV=levetiracetam; VNS=vagus nerve stimulation  
Note: Drug load per AED at the visit was calculated as: daily dose (mg)/defined daily dose.  
Note: Number of AEDs included AEDs, LEV, BRV, and VNS use.  
Note: AED preferred terms were collapsed into AED categories prior to counting the number of AEDs. 
From Baseline to Visit 4 (Month 12), the total AED load for the pediatric patient increased from 3.3 to 
3.8, while the total number of AEDs decreased from 4 to 3. 
Safety results 
The single pediatric patient began the study in Q3 2018 and completed the study in Q4 2019. The 
patient had no protocol deviations and was included in all analysis sets. 
Extent of exposure 
The pediatric patient’s starting BRV dose was 50mg/day, with a maintenance dose of 200mg/day 
reached by Day 144 and a total exposure of 446 days.  
Adverse events  
No adverse events (AEs) or other safety relevant information were reported for the pediatric patient 
during her participation in the study. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Due to the data consisting of a single pediatric patient, results should be interpreted with caution. No 
change in the benefit-risk conclusion can be drawn from this single patient. Nonetheless, this patient 
stayed on BRV for more than 12 months and had no AEs.  
This study is being submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 (The 
Paediatric Regulation). Changes to the approved EU Product Information of BRIVIACT are not deemed 
necessary; thus, none are being proposed.

2.4.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The single paediatric patient had a treatment retention of greater than one year and a clear reduction 
in seizure frequency by twelve months. However, concordant reports from the treating physician and 
the patient show a decrease in quality of life and the global impression of change at twelve months. No 
adverse reactions were reported. Available data do not allow any further understanding of the 
discrepancy between the achieved seizure frequency reduction and the reduction in quality of life and 
global impression. Data from this single patient is from a regulatory perspective not informative for the 
overall paediatric population. It is agreed with the Applicant that no change to the approved Product 
Information of BRIVIACT is warranted based on the submitted paediatric data. The benefit risk balance 
remains unchanged and positive.

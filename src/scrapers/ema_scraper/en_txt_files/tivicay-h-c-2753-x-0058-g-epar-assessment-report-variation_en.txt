2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Combination antiviral therapy with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) protease and reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors has significantly reduced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related 
morbidity and mortality. However, emerging multi-class drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
strains as well as potential long-term toxicities warrant development of new antiretroviral therapies without 
or with limited cross-resistance to available drugs. INSTIs are a newer class of ARV drugs designed to block 
the action of the IN viral enzyme, which catalyzes 2 key steps in the HIV life cycle and is responsible for 
insertion of the viral genome into the DNA of the host cell. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Treatment of patients (adults, adolescents and children from 4 weeks of age) infected with HIV-1 in 
combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Worldwide, at the end of 2017, an estimated 36.9 million (range: 31.1 million–43.9 million) people were 
living with HIV infection, comprising an estimated 0.8% of adults aged 15-49 years [UNAIDS, 2018a]. 
However, the global burden of HIV varies by country and region. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, a 
reported 1.4 million people (1.3 million-1.6 million) were living with HIV at the end of 2017, compared to 2.2 
million people (1.9 million-2.4 million) living in Western and Central Europe and North America.  
The incidence of HIV infection in the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe and Central Asia has 
doubled in less than 20 years following years of stability [UNAIDS, 2018b].  
In 2017, an estimated 130,000 (120,000-150,000) new infections occurred in Eastern Europe and Central 
Asia.  
In 2018, 160,000 (110,000–260,000) children aged 0-14 acquired HIV infection globally. The estimated 
number of children aged 0-14 living with HIV was 1.7 million (1.3–2.2 million) globally in 2018, more than 
90% of whom were living in sub-Saharan Africa [UNAIDS20UNAIDS19]. By contrast, in the Western and 
Central Europe and North America region, the estimated number of children living with HIV in 2013 was 
2,800 (2,300–3,600), and it is estimated that over 95% of these children were receiving antiretroviral 
therapy [UNAIDS, 2014].  
Globally, deaths among children younger than 15 years of age are reported to be declining. At the end of 
2018, an estimated 100,000 (64,000–160,000) children aged 0-14 years had died from AIDS- related 
causes, representing 52% fewer deaths in this age group than in 2012 [UNAIDS, 2019]. In North America, 
Western and Central Europe, fewer than 200 children died from AIDS-related illnesses in 2012 [UNAIDS, 
2013].

2.1.3.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
The clinical presentation and diagnosis of HIV is well-known and not further discussed in this assessment 
report. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Treatment of HIV requires use of combination antiretroviral therapy. The choice of the combination regimen 
depends on the status of the patient, particularly in terms of plasma HIV viral load, CD4 cell counts, any 
previous treatment(s), prior treatment failure, and intolerance to treatment. The most commonly used 
guidelines are those developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) [World Health Organization, 2019], 
the European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) [EACS, 2019], the Department of Health and Human Services 
(DHHS) in the USA [Department of Health and Human Services, 2019]  and the PENTA (for use in children 
and adolescents) [PENTA2019].  
Treatment options in children are more limited compared to adults. 
About the product 
Tivicay (Dolutegravir, DTG) was first authorised in the US on 12 August 2013 and in the EU on 16 Jan 2014. 
DTG is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INI), currently indicated for the treatment of human 
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in patients above 6 years of age. 
INIs are a newer class of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs designed to block the action of the integrase (IN) viral 
enzyme, which catalyses two key steps in the HIV life cycle and is responsible for insertion of the viral 
genome into the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of the host cell. Since genome integration is a vital step in 
retroviral replication, it is an attractive target for HIV therapy.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Tivicay 5 mg dispersible tablets are round (6 mm diameter), biconvex, white, fil- coated tablets, debossed 
“SV H7S” on one face and “5” on the other face. The composition of Tivicay Dispersible Tablets includes 
dolutegravir (as sodium salt), mannitol (E421), microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, sodium starch glycolate, 
crospovidone, sodium stearyl fumarate, calcium sulfate dihydrate, sucralose and strawberry cream flavour. 
The film coating includes titanium dioxide (E171), hypromellose, and macrogol.  
The aim of the development was to identify an immediate release oral dosage form for use in paediatric 
patients (children ≥4 weeks old, weighing at least 3 kilograms (kg)), which can be swallowed easily, that 
meets compendial and other relevant quality standards, and is packaged protected from moisture. 
Development was based on knowledge of the physicochemical and functional properties of the active 
substance and excipients used in the formulation design. Prior knowledge of the existing products Tivicay 
film-coated tablets, was also used throughout the design and development.  
As indicated above, the active substance is the same as the one used in the approved film-coated tablets. 
Dolutegravir is very slightly soluble in Simulated Intestinal Fluids and practically insoluble in Simulated 
Gastric Fluid. Solubility increases to a maximum between the pH values of 8 to 10. Based on the solubility 
data along with its high permeability, dolutegravir sodium is considered to be a Class II compound in the 
Biopharmaceutical Classification System. 
A clinical study was conducted investigating the PK when dispersed in water with low and high ionic content. 
Comparable PK performance was demonstrated. 
Excipients with appropriate compatibility and functionality were assessed for the finished product based on 
scientific and prior knowledge to meet the requirement of the QTPP for dolutegravir dispersible tablets, 5 mg. 
As indicated above, the same granulation process is used to manufacture the existing film-coated tablets and 
the dispersible tablets. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
To assess whether the proposed commercial formulation, as described in the description and composition of 
the Finished Product, gives equivalent exposure when dosed as a dispersion or direct to mouth, a Relative 
Bioavailability was conducted in adults which compared 5 Dolutegravir dispersible tablets, 5 mg, given as a 
dispersion compared with 5 dolutegravir dispersible tablets, 5 mg given direct to mouth. Comparable 
exposure results were seen. 
The manufacturing process for the 5 mg dispersible tablets was developed and optimized at the proposed 
manufacturing site. A systematic, science and risk-based approach has been applied in defining the 
manufacturing process and the associated control strategy. This began with an overview of the proposed 
manufacturing process, which, together with prior knowledge, were used to identify risks (failure modes) and 
process variables that could impact quality using a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) risk assessment 
tool. The results were then prioritised and used to inform development activities which included univariate 
and multi-factorial studies in order to understand and control the risks to acceptable levels. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/540603/2020 
Page 11/118 
 
  
  
Risk assessments were continually updated throughout development as additional knowledge was gained, 
and then used to further develop the control strategy proposed for the commercial finished product to 
minimise residual risk.  
This approach is aligned with ICH Q8, Q9 and Q10 for the development and manufacture of finished products 
applying QbD elements. Also Established Conditions (ECs) have been identified in line with draft ICH Q12. A 
Design Space has been developed for the unit operations of dolutegravir granulation based on prior 
knowledge of the marketed tablets regarding the active substance, granules, particle size and excipient 
compatibility. This design space was also explored for dolutegravir 5 mg dispersible tablets to confirm these 
CPPs are applicable for the proposed manufacturing process. The manufacturing process is described as 
target values and ranges for a Design Space, PARs and set points. 
The manufacturing process consists of mixing intra-granular excipients with the active substance, wet 
granulation, milling drying. As indicated above, this granule manufacture is identical to the granule 
manufacture used for commercial Tivicay film-coated tablets.  
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing. The primary 
packaging is HDPE bottle closed with child resistant polypropylene screw closures, with a polyethylene faced 
induction heat seal liner. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  several  main  steps:  mixing  and  wet  Granulation,  milling,  drying, 
blending, compression, film-coating and packaging. 
In the original submission, the applicant identified Established Conditions (EC) for the finished product, and 
proposed regulatory reporting categories for post-approval changes to those ECs, in line with the ICH Q12 
guideline on Lifecycle Management. As the definition of Established Conditions and their reporting categories 
must follow the requirements laid down in the current EU Variations Regulation and associated EU Variations 
Guidelines, the applicant was asked to confirm that all future changes to the content of module 3.2.P.3.3 will 
be handled in line with the EU Variation Classification Guideline and the respective variations will be filed. 
Once the legal framework is updated to allow implementation of ICH Q12, all future changes to the identified 
ECs will be handled according to that EU legislation.  
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for the manufacturing process of the dispersible 
tablets. 
The design space has been developed at commercial scale. 
The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial 
scale batches fully support the proposed design space. 
Proven acceptable ranges (PARs) have been identified in the process description. The available development 
data, the proposed control strategy and batch data from commercial scale batches fuly support the proposed 
PARs.

Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description, 
identification (HPLC, UV), dolutegravir content (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), finesses of 
dispersion (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (UV or HPLC), disintegration, and microbiological quality of the finished 
product (Ph. Eur.). 
The potential presence of class 1, 2A and selected class 3 elemental impurities in the finished product has 
been assessed on a risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based 
on the information presented it is concluded that the material specifications, in combination with adherence 
to the overall control strategy is appropriate to control elemental impurities in the product to within safe 
levels below 30% of the respective PDE limits defined in ICH Q3D therefore, elemental impurities are not 
included in the finished product specification.  
The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
The finished product is released onto the market based on release specifications, through traditional final 
product release testing. 
A risk assessment concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities was performed for the finished product 
based on the combined recommendations from health authorities, including EMA communication 
EMA/189634/2019. The nitrosamine impurities risk assessment of the finished product included evaluating 
contributions from dolutegravir, excipients, finished product manufacturing facilities, and packaging 
components. It was concluded that there is no risk related to the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the 
product. Therefore, no changes to the control strategy for Tivicay are necessary to mitigate potential 
contamination by nitrosamines.  
Batch analysis results are provided for four production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under long 
term conditions (25 ºC/ 60% RH), three production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months 
under long term conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 
75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of Tivicay 5 mg dispersible tablets are 
identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
In addition, data have been generated at stress and simulated patient in-use conditions.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months under the following conditions: Store 
in the original package in order to protect from moisture. Keep the bottle tightly closed. Do not remove the 
desiccant. Do not swallow the desiccant. This medicinal product does not require any special storage

Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
An overview of the non-clinical properties of dolutegravir (DTG) is derived from the EPAR of the Tivicay 
procedure EMEA/H/C/002753/X/0018/G with a more extensive discussion on those developmental toxicity 
aspects of dolutegravir (DTG) that are relevant for the extension of indication to children aged between ≥4w 
and <6 years. No new non-clinical studies have been submitted for this procedure. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
Dolutegravir (DTG) is referred to as a second-generation integrase inhibitor, with activity against raltegravir 
resistant viruses. DTG binds to the HIV integrase active site blocking the strand transfer step of retroviral 
DNA integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. The IC50 of DTG against the purified enzyme 
HIV-1 integrase ranged from 2.7nM to 12.6nM. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
In vitro, DTG inhibited the binding of radiolabelled α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) to the human 
recombinant melanocortin 4 (MC4R) receptor by 64% at a concentration equal to the clinical Cmax. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/540603/2020 
Page 14/118 
 
  
  
MC4R is involved notably in the regulation of energy homeostasis and food intake, and deficiency in the 
MC4R is associated with monogenic obesity. There were no findings associated with MC4R in toxicity studies, 
and no clinically significant patterns of changes in vital signs across the clinical studies. 
Safety pharmacology 
Results from safety pharmacology studies indicated that single oral doses of DTG up to 500 (rat) and 1000 
(monkey) mg/kg have a low likelihood to induce acute effects on major organ function in the central nervous, 
respiratory and cardiovascular systems. 
Conclusions 
In summary, the non-clinical pharmacology of DTG was thoroughly evaluated during the original marketing 
authorisation application for Tivicay. No new studies have been submitted in support of the present 
application. This is considered acceptable. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Bioavailability of DTG in rat and monkey ranged from 25 to 34% and increased to levels of 76 to 87% after 
fasting. With increasing doses systemic exposure levels increased although less than dose-proportionally. 
Systemic exposure levels were overall similar at similar doses in animals given intramuscular or 
subcutaneous doses. After repeated doses there was a trend for increased exposure in female animals 
compared with males although this gender difference was not consistently observed. 
Distribution 
Distribution studies in rats indicated highest levels of radiolabel at 6 hours post dose and tissues with highest 
radioactivity included liver, adrenal medulla, myocardium, pigmented skin, renal cortex and renal medulla, 
lung and lymph nodes. Levels in the brain were low, but quantifiable. Studies in pregnant rats showed that 
DTG crossed the placenta and that foetal radioactivity was highest in blood, myocardium and muscle. In 
addition, lacteal transfer of DTG was evident. At postnatal day 10 (PND10), total DTG related concentrations 
in milk were up to 2x greater than those in maternal blood. 
Metabolism 
In vitro studies in rat and human liver microsomes showed that a metabolite of DTG, consistent with addition 
of glutathione through oxidative defluorination, was formed. Data indicated that DTG induced a formation of 
an electrophilic metabolite in rat and human microsomes. The significance of the formation of this metabolite 
is likely limited at doses relevant for the clinical setting. Metabolic profiling in mouse and rat showed that 
DTG was the major radiolabelled compound in plasma, liver and faeces. In monkey, DTG was the major 
radiolabelled compound in plasma. In bile major components were glucuronide and hexose conjugates. 
Excretion 
In mouse, rat and monkey the major part of the radioactivity was eliminated in faeces.

Conclusions 
In summary, the non-clinical pharmacokinetics of DTG was thoroughly evaluated during the original 
marketing authorisation application for Tivicay. No new studies have been submitted in support of the 
present application. This is considered acceptable. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The toxicity of DTG was investigated in repeat-dose studies in adult animals: in rat up to 26 weeks (w), in 
monkey up to 38w, and in mouse up to 13w. Adverse effects of DTG were evident in the stomach, cecum, 
colon and rectum in both rat and monkey, but based on systemic exposure as well as dose, monkeys were 
considerably more sensitive to these effects than rats. Concerning the gastrointestinal targets, comparisons 
based on mg/m2 may be more relevant than systemic exposure levels and at the NOAEL multiples were in 
the range of 2-3x the expected human values. 
There were indications of a potential of DTG to disturb liver functional activity in the mouse 3-month study, 
and in the monkey liver effects were reported at doses from 300 mg/kg in the 2w study with more 
pronounced reactions, including single cell necrosis and hypertrophy at a dose of 1000 mg/kg. The 
mechanism of liver injury in the monkey is not known. An electrophilic metabolite of DTG appears to be 
formed but it is unclear whether this is involved in mechanisms of toxicity identified in non-clinical studies. 
Some clinical data have indicated a potential for liver reactions to DTG. 
Genotoxicity 
Negative results were reported except for a weakly positive result in the mouse lymphoma assay at high 
cytotoxicity. A previous non-GLP mouse lymphoma test was positive at high dose, but cytotoxicity may have 
confounded results. The in vivo rat micronucleus test was negative. Taken together the data did not indicate 
any relevant genotoxic potential of DTG. 
Carcinogenicity 
Long term carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mouse and rat. Overall DTG did not exhibit any 
significant neoplastic activity in either study. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development: There were no noteworthy findings with respect to sperm 
functional parameters and morphology in male rats (Sprague-Dawley) treated with doses of DTG up to 
1000mg/kg. Male and female fertility did not appear to be affected at doses up to 1000mg/kg providing 
exposure multiples of approximately 27x the expected clinical value at a dose of 50mg BID. 
Embryo-foetal development: Teratological assessment for DTG was conducted using rat and rabbit animal 
models. In rat (Sprague-Dawley), an oral exposure between gestational day (GD) 6 and GD17 with doses 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/540603/2020 
Page 16/118 
 
  
  
between 100 and 1000mg/kg per day led to a slight increase in preimplantation loss at 1000mg/kg but 
without clearly affecting litter parameters. The NOAEL of the study was set to 1000mg/kg.  
In rabbit (Japanese White), an oral exposure between GD6 and GD18 with doses between 40 and 1000mg/kg 
per day resulted in a reduction of maternal body weight gain and food intake plus scant or no faeces/urine at 
the middle dose (≥200mg/kg). No adverse effects on the embryos/foetuses were observed. 
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function: The perinatal toxicity profile of DTG was 
characterized in rats (Sprague-Dawley). The exposure duration was between GD6 (maternal-in utero 
exposure of offspring) and postnatal day 20 (PND20; maternal-lactation exposure of offspring) at doses of 5, 
50 and 1000mg/kg per day. The study included an assessment of the F1-offspring generation (e.g. endpoints 
for gross pathology, sexual development and behaviour) and pre-implantation and viability of F2-generation 
embryos.  
The dams (F0) demonstrated some reduction in body weight gain at the maximum dose (1000mg/kg; 
maternal NOAEL 50mg/kg). In the F1-generation, one new-born had external malformations (meningocele 
and eye bulge aplasia) at 1000mg/kg. Due to overall low incidence of developmental anomalies in the study, 
this defect was not considered DTG related. Statistically significant female F1-offspring body weight 
decreases were noted at 1000mg/kg between PND11 and PND42 as compared to the control animals. 
Juvenile toxicity: Three juvenile toxicity studies in rat (Sprague-Dawley) were performed: two dose-range 
finding (DRF) studies and one pivotal study which were submitted in the original procedure that lead to 
market authorization (EMEA/H/C/002753, market authorization from 2014). The most recent assessment of 
the juvenile toxicity studies was conducted in procedure EMEA/H/C/002753/X/0018/G which extended the 
indication to children aged six years and older. Overall, the juvenile toxicity studies in general and the pivotal 
study in particular (oral gavage exposure between PND4 and PND66 with no recovery period; doses 0.5, 2 
and 75mg/kg per day) identified mainly two outcomes of interest/concern: 
•  Mortality: DTG-linked mortality in the pre-weaning period (PND4 to PND21) was observed at the max 
doses in all juvenile toxicity studies (shifting the max dose from 1000mg/kg and 300mg/kg in the 
DRF-studies to 75mg/kg in the pivotal study). In the pivotal study, two pre-weaning male pup deaths 
occurred on PND12 and PND17 in the 75 mg/kg/day dose group.  
•  Body weight gain: For the 75 mg/kg/day dose, an body weight reduction induced during pre-weaning 
occurred in both sexes but was transient in male offspring (having recovered compared to controls 
between PND28 and PND42) while females did not recover before the termination of the experiment 
(mean female body weight on PND66 was 257g compared to a control mean value of 282g). During 
the pre-weaning period, the body weight gain of the exposed animals was 0.74x to 0.86x compared 
to controls. 
•  Other effects: Nasal degeneration was observed at all dose levels, being ascribed to a local irritant 
effect but considered clinically relevant. Among other endpoints it can be noted that there were no 
observed effects on spermatogenesis (reproductive toxicity) or immunological competence or on 
lymphocyte subsets counts (immunotoxicity). 
The overall NOAEL and LOAEL for the pivotal study was set to 2mg/kg/day (PND13 Cmax 15.8 ug/mL and 
AUC0-24h 309.5ug x h/mL; PND32 Cmax 7.59ug/mL and AUC0-24h 89.5ug x h/mL) and 75mg/kg/day (PND13 
Cmax 86.7 ug/mL and AUC0-24h 1544.5ug x h/mL; PND32 Cmax 73.7ug/mL and AUC0-24h 980.5ug x h/mL) 
respectively. Based on that the stated human target exposure (AUC for ≥4w and <18 years) of the applicant 
is 46 (37-134) ug x h/mL (in the Clinical Overview of the dossier, and from ongoing clinical trials 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/540603/2020 
Page 17/118 
 
  
  
P1093/ING112578 and ODYSSEY/201296), this gives the following systemic exposure margins 
(animal/human AUC): 
•  Rat PND13 
o  NOAEL : 6.7x margin ( range 2.3x – 8.4x ) 
o 
LOAEL : 33.6x margin ( range 11.3x – 41.7x ) 
•  Rat PND32 
o  NOAEL : 2.0x margin ( range 0.7x – 2.4x ) 
o 
LOAEL : 21.3x margin ( range 7.2x – 24.1x ) 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Dolutegravir (DTG or experimental name GSK1349572A) is a monosodium salt which, in aqueous solution, 
dissociates into its active moiety, the free base (experimental name GSK1349572B) and the counter sodium 
ion. DTG has the formula of C20H18F2N3NaO5 and a molecular weight of Mw = 441.36 g/mol as a salt and 
Mw = 419.38g/ml as a free base. The solubility in water is 3.176mg/mL (at 21°C) and the pKa for DTG is 
8.2. Regarding the clinical pharmacokinetics properties of DTG, 53% of the total oral dose is excreted 
unchanged in the faeces. Furthermore, 31% of the total oral dose is excreted in the urine, represented by 
ether glucuronide of dolutegravir (18.9% of total dose), N-dealkylation metabolite (3.6% of total dose), and 
a metabolite formed by oxidation at the benzylic carbon (3.0% of total dose).  
DTG is a non-lipophilic slightly water-soluble compound that binds sludge solids and that will distribute to 
both the aquatic and terrestrial environments and has the potential to accumulate both in STP sludge (sludge 
adsorption Kdoc =10609-15367) and sediment (not degradable, sediment-water system DT50 > 1000d). 
DTG is able to generate toxicity in organisms from both aquatic ecosystems (algae toxicity with a NOEC 
0.0954mg/L followed by fish larval survival at a NOEC of 0.22mg/L) and terrestrial ecosystems (phytotoxicity 
in pea; NOEC 12mg/kg) but, based on the predicated environmental concentrations, not to a degree that is 
expected to pose an environmental concern. While not remarked upon in the original submission ERA for 
Tivicay, a potent and clear deviation in soil micro-organism nitrate formation was also detected subsequent 
to DTG exposure. The biological significance of this effect is unclear but as this effect was stimulatory rather 
than inhibitory, this finding will not influence the present ERA.  
Overall, while very persistent in sediment, all environmental compartment risk quotients were < 0.1 and DTG 
is therefore not considered to pose a risk to the environment. DTG is also not classified as a PBT or vPvB 
compound. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
During the EMEA/H/C/002753/X/0018/G assessment, the possible reasons for the pre-weaning effects were 
discussed more in depth by the MAH. Based on toxicokinetic measurements on PND13 and PND32, the 
systemic exposure of DTG was higher on PND13 in the younger pre-weanling pups compared to the more 
mature juvenile pups on PND32 (at NOAEL 48% less at Cmax and 29% at AUC; at LOAEL 85% less at Cmax 
and 64% less at AUC). The toxicokinetic-time profiles on PND13 indicate a longer half-life in pre-weaning rats 
compared to post-weaning PND32 rats, possibly due to immaturity of clearance pathways. The biliary 
excretion in animals accounts for the major portion of the absorbed dose and represented the predominant 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/540603/2020 
Page 18/118 
 
  
  
excretion route for DTG glucuronide. The predominant biotransformation pathway for DTG in humans is 
glucuronidation by orthologous UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) with a notable oxidative 
contribution from CYP3A4. In rats, UGT1A1 gene expression has a surge immediately after birth, but then is 
low until ~PND14 when it begins to rise to near adult levels by PND28 1 while CYP3A expression seems to 
slowly increase towards adult level at PND42 2, roughly correlating with the developing capability in rat to 
eliminate via bile route after the first ~14 days. It seems therefore likely that at least some aspect of the 
increased pre-weaning rat sensitivity (expressed as mortality and reduced growth) to DTG is due to higher 
early systemic exposure due to ADME differences.  
For the previous indication extension down to 6 years of age, this was considered an argument against DTG 
toxicity in children considering that the end of the rat-weaning period (~PND21) is generally stipulated to 
correspond to a human age around 20-24 months. In the present procedure, which aims at a lower human 
age limit of 4w, the extrapolation and risk assessment is more uncertain. As noted by the MAH in the 
previous procedure, in humans, UGT1A1 expression is triggered at birth and its activity reaches adult levels 
by 3 to 6-months of age3, while hepatic CYP3A4 expression begins to dramatically increase at about 1w of 
age, reaching 30% of adult levels by 1 month of age4. Based on the ADME-argument, at a minimum, this 
would indicate an increased likelihood of higher systemic exposure of DTG in the younger infants (e.g. 1-6 
months of age).  
No data or persuasive arguments (the MAH mainly argues that ~3x to ~6x margin provides sufficient safety 
multiples for infants 4-weeks of age or older and focuses on LOAEL based exposure margins as a basis for 
safety) have been provided that shed light on the clinical relevance of the likely higher DTG exposure in 
paediatric populations aged at least 4 weeks and weighing at least 3kg. The MAH has provided additional AUC 
and NOAEL-based mean exposure margin estimates (based on non-clinical PND13 AUC values) which are 
similar to those previously calculated:  
•  Human weight 3 to <6kg (5mg DTG): 6.3x 
•  Human weight 6 to <10kg (10mg DTG), age <6 months: 3.6x 
•  Human weight 6 to <10kg (15mg DTG), age >6 months: 5.4x 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considered that there is no objection for the approval of Tivicay from a non-clinical point of view.

Bioanalytical method 
Study 200401 and 205893 was analysed according to the method validation report 2012N147635_00 
including supplemental 1-9, study ING114556 was analysed according to method validation report 
2011N112453 including supplemental 1-3, study P1093 was analysed according to the method validation 
report 2019N420285_00 and study Odyssey was analysed according to the method validation report 
2019N420284_00. Overall, these appears acceptable.  
Relative bioavailability study 200401 
This study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and relative bioavailability of a dispersible tablet 
formulation compared to a paediatric granule formulation in healthy subjects, as well as the effect of mineral 
content in dispersible water and holding time of the dispersion before consumption of the dispersible tablet 
formulation. Note that the dispersible 5 mg tablet, evaluated in this study, was an earlier formulation of the 
dispersible tablet and is not the intended formulation for marketing. 
The study was an open label, randomised, five-treatment, five-period, five-sequence single-dose crossover 
study. 15 healthy volunteers were enrolled and received a sequence of five treatments. Study drug 
administration was performed after an overnight fast period of 8 hours. Blood-samples were collected pre-
dose and up to 48 hours after drug administration. The study periods were separated by a wash-out period of 
7 days. The results from this study are presented in the table below.

This study was conducted to evaluate the single-dose relative bioavailability of an oral dolutegravir granule 
formulation given as single 50 mg dose in the fasted state administered with and without various liquids 
(purified water, Contrex mineral water, and a milk-based infant formula) compared to the tablet formulation 
administered with tap water in the fasted state. The direct to mouth treatment was included to simulate real-
world conditions where potable water is not available. The applicant states that the two water arms 
represented the best case and worst-case scenarios for the potential effect of metal cations in drinking water 
on dolutegravir absorption.

suspension administrated with and without various liquids (purified water, Contrex mineral water and a milk- 
based infant formula) compared to dolutegravir 50 tablets administrated with tap water. Study drug 
administration was performed after an overnight fast period of at least 6 hours. Blood-samples were collected 
pre-dose and up to 48-hours post- dose. The study periods were separated by a wash-out period of 5 days. 
The results from this study is presented in the table below. 
Table 3: Results from the relative bioavailability study ING114556
Relative bioavailability study 205893 
This was a Phase I, single-dose, crossover, relative bioavailability study comparing TIVICAY dispersible 
tablets and direct-to-mouth paediatric tablets to conventional TIVICAY tablets. This study was conducted in 2 
separate parts with separate groups of fasted healthy adult subjects to investigate both 10-mg conventional 
tablets (Part 1) and 5-mg dispersible tablets (Part 2). Subjects participated in only one part of the study. 
Parts 1 and 2 of the study were conducted concurrently.  
Part 1 was an open label, randomised two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence single-dose crossover study 
conducted in 14 healthy volunteers to evaluate the bioavailability of dolutegravir 10 mg tablets (5 tablets) 
compared with DTG 50 mg tablet. Both treatments were administrated direct to mouth with 240 ml water.   
Part 2 was an open label, randomized, three period, six-sequence cross-over study conducted in 24 healthy 
volunteers to evaluate the relative bioavailability of five, 5mg dispersible tablets administrated as “disperse 
and immediately taken” and of five dispersible 5-mg tablets to be administered as “direct to mouth” with 240 
ml of water, compared to a 25-mg conventional tablet (reference) administered direct to mouth with 240 ml 
of water.  
Both parts: Study drug administration was performed after an overnight fast period of at least 10 hours. 
Blood-samples were collected pre-dose and up to 72 hours after drug administration. The study periods were 
separated by a wash-out period of 7 days (i.e. 7 days minus 4 hours). The study results are presented in the 
two tables below:

Influence of food 
No food effect study has been submitted with this application. In the SmPC it is stated that dolutegravir may 
be taken with or without food, which is found acceptable.  
Population pharmacokinetic model 
A population PK model for DTG was previously developed in paediatric subjects using the available partial 
data (388 concentration records from 41 subjects with 90% data from FCT and only 10% from granules) 
from P1093. The predictive performance of this interim model was evaluated by using the additional data 
from P1093 and the available data from ODYSSEY studies as an external validation dataset and performing 
simulation using a prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pcVPC) method.  The existing population PK 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/540603/2020 
Page 28/118 
 
  
  
 
 
model was then updated with all the available data from P1093 (1751 concentration records from 152 
subjects) and ODYSSEY (963 concentration records from 88 subjects). The additional data included both 
intensively and sparsely sampled data from various weight bands following FCT, granules and DT 
formulations, both in fasted and without regards to food conditions. The full model with backward deletion 
approach was utilized for covariate modelling. The model was then refined by estimating the allometric 
scaling coefficients, estimating separate bioavailability in fasted versus without regard to food conditions and 
estimating maturation function to CL/F. Once the final population PK model was developed, the ability of the 
model to describe the observed data was investigated using pcVPCs. 
Software 
NONMEM® program version 7.3.0 was used for the population PK analysis (ICON, Ellicott City, 
Maryland, USA). 
Dataset 
Previous dataset: A total of 2714 plasma concentrations (1751 from P1093 and 963 from ODYSSEY) were 
available from 240 subjects (152 from P1093 and 88 from ODYSSEY). Out of 2714, 21 plasma concentrations 
were BLQ and were excluded from the PK analysis. Further a total of 43 quantifiable plasma concentrations 
(24 from P1093 and 19 from ODYSSEY) were excluded from population PK analysis (reasons for exclusion 
were: outlier ( very low concentration), sample thought to be flipped , subject had multiples comorbidities, 
sample haemolysis, non adherence to trial medication).  A total of 239 subjects (2650 plasma 
concentrations), 151 from Study P1093 (1711 concentrations) and 88 from Study ODYSSEY (939 
concentrations) were included in the current population PK analysis. 
Updated dataset: New data are only available from study P1093 and the PopPK model has been updated with 
inclusion of these new data. The Applicant has updated the model included with the submission. After a cut-
off date of 30 April 2019, an additional 183 concentrations (~6%) were available from 26 paediatric 
participants.  
Model development 
The previous population PK model was updated with the additional data from P1093 and ODYSSEY studies. 
The structural PK model remained the same as the interim model and the PK of DTG following oral 
administration were adequately described by a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and 
elimination; absorption rate constant (KA) was formulation specific and relative bioavailability (F) was both 
formulation and diet-specific. Allometric coefficients of the weight effect on CL/F and V/F were previously 
fixed but are now estimated to be lower than the theoretical values of 0.75 and 1, respectively. A maturation 
function from literature (Andersson et al.) was also applied to CL/F to account for the CL/F in infants. 
Random effects included inter-individual variability (IIV) on all parameters as well as inter-occasion variability 
(IOV) on both the apparent clearance (CL/F) and KA. Separate residual errors were estimated for the two 
studies. See tables below for parameter estimates for the current final model and comparison to the previous 
(interim model) and the adult model.

popPK analysis with updated dataset: Model estimated PK parameters were compared for final model 
2019z and model 2020y with the updated dataset. The Applicant also evaluated a model with fixed allometric 
exponents (0.75 and 1 for CL and V) and estimated only maturation half time (TM50) with both the current 
(2019z3) and updated (2020z2) data. A comparison of the model. The fixed and random effect parameters 
estimated in model 2019z and 2019z3 were comparable, showing no significant difference between the 2 
models. However, when estimating TM50 (model 2019z3 or 2020z2), both fixed and random effect 
parameters were less precise. The applicant concludes that based on the model parameters, pcVPC and 
similar estimated TM50, the current model with the previous dataset is considered adequate. The popPK 
model submitted previously (2019z) was updated with new data (~6%). The parameter estimates and the 
OFV are included in Table 8 and Table 9 below.

The final model was evaluated by performing pcVPCs. The median, 5th and 95th percentiles for the predicted 
DTG concentrations are overlaid with the observed data. Note that this is the model using the previous 
dataset, not the updated dataset. The plots stratified by weight band indicated an overall good prediction of 
the observed concentrations (see figures below).

Target PK parameters  
The goal of the DTG paediatric clinical program is to determine optimal paediatric dosing that achieves 
plasma DTG AUC0-24h and C24h values associated with efficacy in adults. The target PK parameters and 
range are shown in the table below. The upper range target is the 95th percentile observed in adults in Study 
ING112961 in which DTG was dosed twice daily in adults with documented INSTI resistance.

The applicant has now provided PK target exposure for Cmax. The GM target of 3.67 μg/mL represents a post 
hoc GM estimate in treatment naïve participants following 50 mg FCT QD DTG dosing. The lower limit (2.94 
μg/mL) is selected as 80% of the GM Cmax (3.67 μg/mL). The upper limit (6.7 ug/mL) represents the 95th 
percentile of post hoc estimates in treatment experienced participants following 50 mg FCT BID dosing. The 
upper limit for individual participants was selected based on a supratherapeutic dose of 250mg once daily as 
an oral suspension in 41 adult participants in thorough QT/QTc (TQT) Study (ING111856) where GM Cmax 
[min-max] was 12.4 [5.3 – 20.5] μg/mL. 
Table 11: Target for Steady State Cmax 
DTG exposure in paediatric patients 
The proposed weight band-based DTG dosing is designed to align dosing recommendations with WHO-defined 
weight bands [WHO, 2016] and supported by regulatory guidance. The proposed weight band based DTG 
doses simplify dosing by minimizing the number of different doses, dosage forms, and dosage form strengths 
required across paediatric and adult patients. For example, DTG 50mg FCT is currently approved for use in 
adult and paediatric patients >40 kg. The proposal to extend the 50mg FCT dose to children weighing at least 
20 kg is supported by the similar plasma DTG C24h observed among the three weight bands in ODYSSEY 
(20to <25 kg, 25to <30 kg, and 30to <40 kg) compared with data for >40 kg in P1093 and historical data in 
adults following 50 mg once daily. See first table below for summary of simulated DTG exposure in paediatric 
patients. The 2nd table below shows observed exposure for the 50 mg FCT dose in paediatric patients and 
adults. Simulated Cmax for the BID dosing (same daily dose as QD) is also shown in figure below. Note that 
Cmax in paediatric cohorts is higher than Cmax for twice daily 50 mg dose in adults.

There are no new PD data within this application. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Three relative bioavailability studies (study 200401, ING114556 and 205893) were submitted by the 
applicant in order to bridge the different types of formulation (dispersible tablet, tablet and granules of oral 
suspension) to each other in fasting state. A bridge to either the 25 mg tablet, as reference in study 205893, 
or to the 50 mg tablet, as reference, in study ING114556 is found acceptable, since the composition of the 
commercial 25 mg tablet is proportional to the commercial 50 mg tablet and the in vitro dissolution profiles 
are generally considered similar to the 50 mg tablet.  
An earlier 5 mg dispersible tablet formulation was used in study 200401 which is not the same as the one 
intended for marketing. The applicant has not discussed the differences in composition between the earlier 5

mg dispersible tablet used in study 200401 and the intended 5 mg dispersible tablet for marketing. However, 
the two relative bioavailability studies (205893 and ING114556), are assessed as sufficient to bridge the 
different types of formulation (dispersible tablet, tablet and granules of oral suspension) to each other in this 
case. 
In study 200401, bioequivalence was shown between four, 5 mg dispersible tablet (earlier formulation and 
not the formulation intended for marketing) dispersed in low mineral content water compared with the 20 mg 
paediatric granule, since the 90% confidence interval fell within the conventional acceptance range of 80.00-
125.00% for AUC0-t and Cmax. In this study it could also be concluded that the dispersible tablet seems not 
be affected by different types of water (low mineral content water or Contrex water). If the dispersible tablet 
is first dispersed and then stands for 30 minutes in low mineral water or Contrex water before consumption 
seems not to have any affect either. 
In study ING114556 bioequivalence was not established for the granule for oral suspension compared with 
the 50 mg tablet, since the 90 % confidence interval fell outside the conventional acceptance range of 80.00-
125.00%. In this study the granules for oral suspension, administrated direct to mouth without liquid or 
reconstituted with various liquids (purified water, Contrex mineral water or milk-based infant formula), 
showed higher bioavailability compared with the 50 mg tablet; geometric dolutegravir mean plasma AUC0-∞ 
values were 1.55- to 1.83-fold higher, AUC0-t was 1.56- to 1.84 fold higher and Cmax was 1,62- to 2.02-fold 
higher.   
The oral bioavailability for the granule for oral suspension was not affected if given direct to mouth or with 
different types of water (purified water or HMC water). The oral bioavailability was affected to a small extent 
when given with milk-based infant formula compared with purified water; geometric mean AUC0-∞, AUC0-t 
were both 1.17-fold higher and Cmax was 1.22-fold higher.  
Study 205893 was divided in two parts. In part 1, bioequivalence was shown between the conventional 10 
mg tablet (administrated as 5 tablets) and the commercial 50 mg tablets since the 90% confidence interval 
for AUC0-t and Cmax fell within the conventional acceptance range of 80.00-125.00%.  
In the previously approved SmPC of Tivicay it is stated in section 4.2 that the 50 mg once daily dose should 
not be given as five, 10 mg tablets. In section 5.2 it is further stated that bioequivalence has not been 
unequivocally shown for 1x50 mg tablet compared to 5x10 mg tablets and therefore, the 50 mg once daily 
dose should not be given as five, 10 mg tablets. In this application this text has been removed from the 
SmPC. This is assessed acceptable based on that bioequivalence is shown between five commercial 10 mg 
tablets and the commercial 50 mg tablet.   
In part 2 of the same study, bioequivalence was not established for dispersible tablet compared to the 
conventional 25 mg tablet. AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ were both increased about 1.5- to 1.6- fold and Cmax was 
increased about 1.8-fold following administration of five dispersible, 5mg tablets, administrated as a 
dispersion or administrated direct to mouth with 240 ml of water compared with one conventional 25 mg 
tablet. 
From the relative bioavailability data, it can be concluded that the dolutegravir dispersible tablet deliver 
higher plasma exposure than dolutegravir tablets. Thus, the two dosage forms are not substitutable on a mg-
per-mg basis and a dose adjustment is necessary when switching between the two dosage forms. It can also 
be concluded that the dolutegravir dispersible tablet seems not to be affected by different types of water (low 
mineral content water or Contrex water).

No food effect study has been submitted with the new dispersible tablet. However, based on the formulation 
of the new dispersible tablet it is not considered likely that the new dispersible tablet has higher food effect 
than the conventional tablet. This is supported by the fact that the dispersible tablet and the granule for oral 
suspension is based on the same granules, and for the granules for oral suspension the oral bioavailability 
was affected to a small extent when given with milk based infant formula compared with purified water; 
geometric mean AUC0-∞, AUC0-t were both 1.17-fold higher and Cmax was 1.22-fold higher. Thus, the food 
effect for the tablet can be considered as a worst-case scenario for the dispersible tablet.  
The Cmax geometric mean observed in the 20 to <25 kg weight band (the weight cohort with the highest 
Cmax) and assuming a worst-case scenario with a high fat meal would be ~11.95 ug/mL (67% higher [7.16 
x 1.67 = 11.95 ug/mL]). While high, this GM Cmax is in line with 250 mg single dose observed in adults.  
It is however agreed that the worst-case scenario food effect is unlikely. Overall, the applicant has mitigated 
some of the concern regarding food effect on Cmax but a quantitative information on the food effect is still 
lacking.  
Thus, information regarding food effect of the dispersible tablet cannot be included in the SmPC, but 
information in the SmPC that the dispersible tablet can be taken both under fasting and fed condition is 
agreed.  
The SmPC has been updated accordingly to reflect that no formal food effect studies were conducted for 
dispersible tablets. However, based on the available data a higher a food effect is not expected for the 
dispersible tablet compared to the film coated tablets. 
The applicant has clarified that long- term stability data cover the time from first sample collection to analysis 
in the two studies (study P1093 and Odyssey). 
Regarding popPK 
There were very few BQL data, thus not using M3 method or other appropriate method for handling BQL data 
is acceptable. Removing 43 plasma concentrations and providing reason for exclusion is considered adequate.  
The date for the data cut-off was 30 Apr 2019 for P1093 and 28 Feb 2019 for ODYSSEY, this is considered to 
be too long ago. The applicant has now updated the dataset with more recent data.  
The approach to start with the previous popPK model is supported. From the run record, when estimating the 
maturation function parameters, the OFV increased. This means that the model ended up in a local minimum. 
Further, estimating both allometric exponents and maturation function is likely not possible as the model will 
be over parameterized. The estimated allometric exponents are now likely accounting for some of the 
maturation. The applicant should estimate a model with fixed allometric exponents (0.75 and 1 for CL and 
Vd) and estimate parameters for the maturation function (using the updated dataset). The hill factor may be 
difficult to estimate, and the applicant can also try estimating only TM50. The updated model should be 
compared to the current final model (both using the updated dataset). The applicant should provide weight 
stratified pcVPC for the updated models. The applicant has developed updated models using an updated 
dataset with more data but still concludes that the previous model with the previous data set is adequate and 
thus the final model. This is not agreed with. A model with the updated dataset is considered more correct 
since it uses all the available data. In addition, no OFVs were presented. It is unclear if the model with fixed 
allometric scaling and estimated maturation may be in a local minimum. The applicant should present OFV 
compared to base model (using updated dataset only). The applicant should try different initial estimates if 
there are indication of local minimum.

The applicant has now provided run record including OFV for models with the updated dataset. The run 
record support a model with estimated allometric exponent and fixed maturation function. The parameter 
estimates and the provided VPCs for the updated model are similar to the previous model.  Since the updated 
model and the previous model are similar the simulations from the previous model are accepted. The 
simulations support the proposed posology.  
The applicant has not adequately motivated the proposed PK target parameters and ranges. Cmax is missing 
and needs to be included. The applicant has now provided a table with target range for Cmax. Cmax and 
safety are discussed in clinical safety section. 
The applicant has changed the proposed dosing in already approved paediatric weight/age groups to simplify 
dosing by minimizing the number of different doses, dosage forms, and dosage form strengths required 
across paediatric population. In the new proposed dosing, children weighing ≥20 kg will receive same dose as 
adults. Cmax in several paediatric cohorts including children 20-25 kg are higher than Cmax for twice daily 
(100 mg/day) dosing in adults. Cmax and safety are discussed in clinical safety section.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Extrapolating efficacy and safety from adults to children based on exposure similarity is supported. The 
issues regarding the popPK analysis have now been solved. The popPK model with the updated dataset has 
same model structure and similar parameter estimates as the previous model with the previous dataset and 
thus the simulations and conclusions from the previous model are accepted. The simulations support the 
proposed posology. 
The applicant has mitigated some of the concern regarding the food effect. The food effect for the tablet can 
be considered as a worst-case scenario for the dispersible tablet but the food effect is likely less. Thus, 
information regarding food effect of the dispersible tablet cannot be included in the SmPC, but information in 
the SmPC that the dispersible tablet can be taken both under fasting and fed condition is agreed. .  
The applicant agreed with the remaining SmPC comments and updates as requested by CHMP. 
The SmPC has been updated with the remaining comments on food effect. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The current application is based on data from the ongoing paediatric study P1093 and PK sub-studies in the 
ODYSSEY study (PENTA 20, 201296); 
• 
to support the 5 mg DTG DT for approval with dosing recommendations in children ≥3 kg and 4 
weeks of age and to 
•  update current dosing recommendation for paediatric patients to align with the WHO-defined weight 
bands 
• 
to support new paediatric dosing recommendations in children 14 kg in film-coated tablets (10 mg, 
25 mg and 50 mg) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/540603/2020 
Page 42/118 
 
  
  
The assessment of efficacy in this variation is based on P1093 data only, while safety is based also on the 
ODYSSEY study. There are no dose-response studies in this application. 
The previous paediatric line extension (TIVICAY X/0018G), included an assessment of PK, safety and efficacy 
data from two sub-cohorts in the study P1093: Cohort IIA containing children 6-12 years (scope of 
application), and Cohort I containing adolescents 12-18 years (supportive data) for a line extension to 
register two new tablet strengths; 10 mg and 25 mg tablets and a type II variation to extend the therapeutic 
indication for TIVICAY to children from 6 to 12 years of age.  
In the current application, the MAH includes interim data on PK, safety and efficacy of TIVICAY in Cohorts I-V 
(≥4 weeks old to >18 years) from the P1093 study and interim data on PK and safety from the ODYSSEY 
study (patients aged ≥28 days and <18 years).

Antiviral Activity of Dolutegravir (GSK1349572), a Novel Integrase Inhibitor, in Combination Regimens in 
HIV-1 Infected Infants, Children and Adolescents: Cohorts I-V, Interim Report 
P1093 is an ongoing Phase I/II multi-center, open-label non-comparative, dose-finding study of at least 120 
HIV-1 infected infants, children, and adolescents ages ≥4 weeks to <18 years to evaluate the PK parameters, 
safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of DTG when administered both prior to starting and in combination 
with optimized background therapy (OBT). This study enrolled children in age-defined cohorts sequentially 
from oldest to youngest. 
Study ODYSSEY (201296), ODYSSEY (PENTA 20): A Randomized Trial of Dolutegravir-based Antiretroviral 
Therapy vs. Standard of Care in Children with HIV Infection Starting First-line or Switching to Second-line 
ART: Interim Results from 2 Pharmacokinetic Sub-studies 
ODYSSEY is an ongoing, open-label, multi-center, randomized (1:1), non-inferiority, Phase II/III, 96-week, 
2-arm clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of DTG plus 2 NRTI vs. SoC in ~700 HIV-infected 
children aged less than 18 years who are starting first-line ART or switching to second-line ART. 
•  ODYSSEY A: paediatric participants starting first-line ART 
•  ODYSSEY B: paediatric participants starting second-line ART. 
The trial incorporates several sub-studies, including 2 weight band-based DTG dosing PK sub-studies, WB-
PK1 and WB-PK2 (described below); intensive PK and safety data from these PK sub-studies are assessed in 
this report.  
The objectives of the ODYSSEY PK sub-studies are to generate complementary DTG PK data, using dosing 
according to WHO weight bands in younger children receiving the 5 mg DT, to provide DTG PK data in older 
children receiving simplified dosing with the 50 mg FCT, and to provide safety data to support new proposed 
dosing. 
Details of the PK sub-studies (WB-PK1 and crossover WB-PK2) were as follows: 
WB-PK1: This sub-study evaluated DTG PK in participants <25 kg and was divided into 3 components. WB-
PK1 part I evaluated the steady-state PK of DTG dosed as one 25 mg FCT once daily in participants weighing 
14 to <20 kg and 20 to <25 kg. Participants were recruited to the sub-study until at least 16 participants (8

EMA/CHMP/540603/2020 
Page 43/118 
 
  
  
participants per weight band) had a single evaluable steady-state 24-hour intense PK profile. Subsequently in 
WB-PK1 part II, participants were enrolled at doses of 25 mg DT and 30 mg DT or 50 mg FCT in the 14 to 
<20 kg and 20 to <25 kg weight bands, respectively. 
WB-PK2: In this crossover sub-study, the PK of 2 different DTG doses were assessed in participants weighing 
≥25 kg in a sequential design within the same child. Participants weighing from 25 to <40 kg and taking DTG 
as described in the protocol (25 mg FCT for 25 to <30 kg weight band and 35 mg FCT for 30 to <40 kg 
weight band) were enrolled in the sub-study until at least 16 participants (at least 8 per weight band) had 
evaluable 24-hour PK profiles on their current dose. Thereafter, the DTG dose was changed to 50 mg FCT and 
a second 24-hour PK profile was obtained at least 1 week after crossing over to the 50 mg FCT dose. 
Methods 
Both P1093 and ODYSSEY include patients between 4 weeks and 18 years of age. The original enrolment in 
P1093 was based on age but data has post hoc been regrouped based on weight. In the ODYSSEY study 
patients are grouped according to weight bands. 
Study Participants  
P1093  
Key inclusion criteria include ART-experienced or naïve infants, children, and adolescents age 4 weeks to 
<18 years at study entry, with confirmed HIV-1 infection, and an OBT that contains at least 1 fully active 
drug for ART-experienced participants. 
Key exclusion criteria include; known resistance to an integrase inhibitor, presence of any active AIDS-
defining opportunistic infections, evidence of pancreatitis, liver toxicity, known exposure to an integrase 
inhibitor, use of chronic systemic immunosuppressive agents or systemic interferon, any known Grade 4 
laboratory toxicities or specified Grade 3 laboratory toxicities 30 days prior to study entry (Note: Grade 3 
bilirubin was allowed if the participant was on ATV). 
Participants initially began sequential enrolment in age-specific cohorts to assess different formulations as 
shown below:  
Cohort I: Adolescents ≥12 to <18 years of age (FCT); 
Cohort IIA: Children ≥6 to <12 years of age (FCT); 
Cohort IIB: Children ≥6 to <12 years of age (granules for suspension); 
Cohorts III: Children ≥2 to <6 years of age (granules for suspension);

Due to increasing international recommendations for paediatric dosing according to weight, independent of 
age, enrolment of sufficient participants to analyse by weight band was also incorporated into the protocol 
(v5.0) as shown below: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
3 to <6 kg; 
6 to <10 kg; 
10 to <14 kg; 
14 to <20 kg. 
Participants are enrolled into the study first into Stage 1, during which intensive PK samples are collected at 
steady state. Target enrolment for Stage 1 is 10 evaluable participants for each age cohort, after which 
exposure and 4-week safety data are reviewed by the protocol team. Within each age cohort participants 
were dosed by weight. With the latest protocol amendment, enrolment into Stage 1 continued until at least 8 
evaluable participants were enrolled into each of the WHO-defined weight bands. Stage 2 opens to enrolment 
if data from Stage 1 are considered acceptable. Target enrolment for Stage 2, during which only sparse PK 
samples are collected, is 12. Participants are followed through Week 48 and then for another 3 years as part 
of long-term safety follow-up.  
AT Population (n=159) includes all participants exposed to DTG at any dose. 
AT Safety Population (n=159) includes all participants who took at least one dose of DTG and deemed 
safety evaluable per the protocol. 
PD Safety Population (n=75) is a subset of participants from the AT Population that started DTG at the 
proposed doses.  
PD Efficacy Population (n=58) is a subset of participants from the AT Population that started DTG at the 
proposed doses shown and who were enrolled at least 24 weeks prior to an agreed upon efficacy cut-off date. 
Data presented in this submission include Stage 1 (intensive PK) and longer term follow up data (including 
Stage 2) as available. Safety and efficacy data from Cohorts I and II (using the FCT) have been previously 
submitted and are included. Enrolment into Cohorts III and IV continues as outlined in the protocol. 
Enrolment into Cohort V is complete. 
ODYSSEY 
Key inclusion criteria for the ODYSSEY study included paediatric participants aged between ≥28 days and 
<18 years of age and weighing ≥3 kg with confirmed HIV-1 infection. Participants in ODYSSEY A must have 
been planning to start first-line ART. Participants in ODYSSEY B must have been planning to start second-line 
ART defined as either: (i) switch of at least 2 ART drugs due to treatment failure; or (ii) switch of only the 
third agent due to treatment failure where drug sensitivity tests showed no mutations conferring NRTI 
resistance. In addition, participants in ODYSSEY B: 
•  Must have been treated with only 1 previous ART regimen. Single-drug substitutions in their previous 
ART regimen for toxicity, simplification, changes in national guidelines, or drug availability were 
allowed. ODYSSEY B participants must have had at least 1 NRTI with predicted preserved activity 
available for a background regimen. 
• 
In countries where resistance tests are routinely performed, at least 1 active NRTI from TDF/TAF, 
ABC or ZDV should be chosen based on all resistance test results in the child (historic and recent). 
The interpretation of the mutations should be based on the up-to-date version of the Stanford HIV 
Drug Resistance Database. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/540603/2020 
Page 45/118 
 
  
  
• 
In countries where resistance tests are not routinely performed, clinicians should follow national/WHO 
Guidelines. At least 1 new NRTI with presumed preserved activity (from ABC, TDF or ZDV) should be 
chosen (Section 5.1 of the protocol). 
•  Viral load ≥500 c/mL at Screening Visit or within 4 weeks prior to Screening. (Note: Prior to Version 
3.0, the viral load requirement was ≥1000 c/mL.) 
Key exclusion criteria included history or presence of known allergy or contraindications to DTG, proposed 
available NRTI backbone, or proposed available standard of care third agent, hepatic impairment, anticipated 
need for hepatitis C virus therapy, pregnancy or breastfeeding, and evidence of lack of susceptibility to 
INSTIs or more than a 2-week exposure to ARVs of this class. 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: PK Sub-studies 
Participants should have met the inclusion criteria for the main study (ODYSSEY A or ODYSSEY B), should 
have been randomized to DTG, and should have met the following additional inclusion criteria for the PK sub-
studies: 
•  Weight 3 to <25 kg for the WB-PK1 sub-study 
•  Weight 25 to <40 kg for the WB-PK2 sub-study 
• 
Parents/caregivers and paediatric participants, where applicable, gave informed written consent. 
In addition to the exclusion criteria for the ODYSSEY study, the following participants were excluded from the 
PK sub-studies: 
•  Children who suffered from illnesses that could have influenced drug PK; i.e., severe diarrhoea, 
vomiting, renal disease, or liver disease 
•  Children treated with concomitant medications known to have interactions with DTG 
•  Children with current severe acute malnutrition. 
Interim Analyses 
The planned interim analyses for ODYSSEY only include evaluation of the populations participating in the 2 PK 
sub-studies (WB-PK1 and WB-PK2) nested within the ODYSSEY study to support Tivicay paediatric global 
regulatory submissions. 
Final Analyses 
The MRC CTU have produced an analysis plan for the ODYSSEY study and PK sub-studies that they will 
conduct after completion of the ODYSSEY study, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once daily DTG-based 
ART compared with standard of care in children and adolescents starting first- or second-line ART in 
resource-limited and well-resourced settings.

Treatments 
P1093 
Dolutegravir Film-Coated Tablet Dosing 
For Cohort I and Cohort IIA, the initial starting dose of DTG FCT was approximately 1 mg/kg once daily, with 
a maximum daily dose of 50 mg. 
Table 15: P1093 Cohort I and IIA DTG FCT Dosing 
Dolutegravir Granule Dosing 
For Cohort IIB, Cohort III, and Cohort IV, the initial starting dose of DTG granules for suspension was ~0.64 
mg/kg once daily for mini-cohort IIB and ~0.8 mg/kg once daily for Cohorts III and IV. Doses were revised 
to ~0.8mg/kg in Cohort IIB and ~1.25mg/kg in Cohort IV. The maximum daily dose was 32 mg.  
The development of granules for suspension is no longer being pursued by the MAH; dispersible tablets will 
be the commercially available paediatric formulation. 
Dolutegravir Dispersible Tablet Dosing 
According to the revised proposed SmPC, dispersible tablets are recommended for: 
• 
• 
adults 
adolescents, children and infants aged at least 4 weeks and weighing at least 3 kg 
For Cohort III-DT, the initial starting DTG DT dose was designed to target approximately 0.8 mg/kg with a 
maximum dose of 30 mg but was subsequently increased. For Cohort IV-DT the initial starting DTG DT dose 
was designed to target 1.25 mg/kg with a maximum dose of 30 mg but was subsequently increased. For 
Cohort V, the initial DTG DT dose was designed to target 1.25 mg/kg and was accepted. When participants in 
Cohort V-DT grew to reach ages above 6 months, they were instructed to follow the dosing for the cohort 
that matched their age.

Objectives 
According to the 2013 EMA draft guidelines on the clinical development of medicinal products for the 
treatment of HIV infection, a specific demonstration of antiviral efficacy in paediatric patients is not required. 
As it is assumed that the PK/PD relation for a direct acting antiviral is roughly similar regardless of the age of 
the patient, the efficacy of a dose that yields sufficiently similar exposure in children, compared to adults, 
would be inferred. 
The objectives are in line with the overall approach to bridge both efficacy and safety from the adult to the 
paediatric population, as such, the studies are not powered to allow a precise estimation of neither efficacy 
nor safety. The endpoints are well-established in the field of HIV clinical trials. 
For the ODYSSEY study, the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of TIVICAY compared with standard of care 
will be presented at study completion. 
P1093 
Primary Objectives 
- 
To select a dose for each formulation of DTG for chronic dosing in infants, children and adolescents 
that achieves similar exposure to the DTG 50 mg once daily adult dose. 
- 
To determine the safety and tolerability of DTG in HIV-1 infected infants, children and adolescents at 
24 and 48 weeks. 
- 
To evaluate the steady-state PK of DTG in combination with optimized background therapy? (OBT) in 
treatment experienced and treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected infants, children and adolescents and to 
determine the dose of DTG that achieves the targeted C24h and AUC0-24h PK parameters in this 
population. (Note: Under Version 5.0 of the protocol, C24h became the primary PK endpoint and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/540603/2020

AUC0-24h became secondary.) 
Secondary Objectives 
- 
To evaluate the antiviral activity of DTG in combination with an OBT by measuring virologic response 
in infants, children and adolescents at 24 and 48 weeks. 
- 
- 
To evaluate the effect on immunologic response from baseline to 24 and 48 weeks. 
To assess changes in HIV-1 genotype and phenotype to DTG and other components of the OBT in 
participants experiencing virologic failure. 
- 
To determine DTG exposure, its variability and clinical covariates that impact DTG disposition (e.g.

- 
To determine the extended long term (≥48 weeks) safety, tolerability and efficacy of DTG in HIV-1 
infected infants, children and adolescents. 
- 
- 
To explore the relationship between DTG exposure and the antiviral activity. 
To evaluate PK, safety and tolerability profile of DTG when dosed by weight bands. 
ODYSSEY 
The primary objective of the ODYSSEY study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once daily DTG-based 
ART compared with standard of care in children and adolescents starting first- or second-line ART in 
resource-limited and well-resourced settings. 
The objectives for the PK sub-studies are to provide PK and safety data in support of dosing 
recommendations for DTG in paediatric patients. This report details PK and safety data from the sub-
population of the ODYSSEY study who participated in the WB-PK1 and WB-PK2 sub-studies through the cut-
off on 28 February 2019. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
P1093 
Safety assessments 
Safety assessments included monitoring and recording all AEs and SAEs, laboratory parameters including 
haematology, fasting lipid profile, and blood chemistry. Toxicity through Week 24 was a primary endpoint 
and through Week 48 and beyond was a secondary endpoint and included all AEs or laboratory toxicities of 
Grade 3 severity, AEs or laboratory toxicities of Grade 3 judged to be at least possibly attributable to the 
study medication, termination from treatment due to a drug-related AE or death. Laboratory samples were 
analysed using certified local laboratories, and sites were notified of participants with abnormal results. 
Efficacy assessments 
Key secondary efficacy analyses include virologic outcomes based on HIV-1 RNA (c/mL) through Week 24 
and Week 48. At both of these time points, the primary definition of virologic outcome was calculated 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/540603/2020 
Page 51/118 
 
  
  
 
 
according the Snapshot algorithm. Participants were classified as virologic failures if they had missing HIV-1 
RNA data throughout the window surrounding the time point of interest.  
Participants included in the efficacy and the safety analysis are comprised of those who completed, or had the 
opportunity to complete, the Week 48 visit by 12 December 2019.  
ODYSSEY 
Safety Assessments 
All participants in the PK sub-studies were reviewed at 4 and 12 weeks after their initial dose of DTG in the 
ODYSSEY study and every 12 weeks thereafter. In addition, participants <14 kg or those changing to a 
higher dose of DTG were reviewed at Week 2. Where scheduled visits for the ODYSSEY study did not coincide 
with PK visits, participants attended additional visits. The safety assessments at these visits included: clinical 
assessment, collection of blood to assess haematology and biochemistry safety parameters, and 
acceptability, sleep and mood questionnaires. Additional safety blood tests or investigations may have been 
performed if clinically indicated to investigate symptoms or monitor emergent laboratory test abnormalities. 
Sample size 
P1093 
For Cohorts I, IIA, and IIB, the selection of a sample size of 10 participants in Stage I for each age cohort 
was based on feasibility and historical paediatric recruitment experience of GSK and IMPAACT, as well as 
justification to target a 95% CI within 60% and 140% of the point estimate for the GM estimates of CL/F and 
V/F for DTG with an at least 80% power. 
Under Protocol Version 5.0, for Cohorts III-V-DT, Stage 1 included enrolment of the full age cohorts (N=10 
per Cohort) followed by additional enrolments to ensure at least 8 participants per weight band were 
included. 
ODYSSEY 
At least 8 participants per weight band with evaluable PK curves on the investigated doses were planned to 
be enrolled. If any large difference in PK parameters within a weight band was observed in either sub-study, 
then recruitment of additional participants in the relevant weight band was considered. Recruitment into the 
lower weight band PK sub-study was ongoing; therefore, there were less than 8 participants per weight band 
(3 to <14 kg weight bands) at the point of the data cut. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
P1093 and ODYSSEY are open-label studies. 
P1093 
P1093 was a single-arm study. 
ODYSSEY 
In ODYSSEY participants were enrolled in 2 different strata depending on their previous ART experience: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/540603/2020 
Page 52/118 
 
  
  
 
• ODYSSEY A: paediatric participants starting first-line ART 
• ODYSSEY B: paediatric participants starting second-line ART. 
Within each stratum, participants were randomized 1:1 to either DTG-based ART (DTG Arm) or standard of 
care (bPI-, or NNRTI-, or INSTI-based ART; Standard of Care Arm). ARVs were dosed according to WHO 
weight band-based dosing recommendations and/or national dosing recommendations. DTG in the PK sub-
studies was dosed using WHO weight bands. The safety assessment is based on data from the two PK sub-
studies. 
Treatment was open-label and dispensed at randomization for 4 weeks and then at maximum 12-week 
intervals. 
Statistical methods 
P1093 
Safety Analyses 
The AT Safety Population includes all participants who took at least one dose of DTG and deemed safety 
evaluable per the protocol. 
PD Safety Population is a subset of participants from the AT Population that started DTG at the proposed 
doses.  
The following AEs were summarized overall and by cohort, enrolment weight band and formulation: all AEs, 
AEs by grade, Grade 3 or greater drug-related AEs, fatal and non-fatal Grade 3 or greater SAEs, and AEs 
leading to withdrawal. SAEs were summarized on-therapy. Mean values and changes from Baseline for 
laboratory values and vital signs (including height and weight) were also summarized. 
AEs were also summarized by the weight band at the time of AE onset. These analyses were only performed 
for participants taking the DT formulation, and include multiple events if participants reported a new AE when 
within a higher weight band. Exposure adjusted incidence rates and 95% CIs were only calculated for these 
analyses of weight band at time of AE onset for participants taking DT formulation.  
Efficacy Analyses 
AT Population includes all participants exposed to DTG at any dose. 
PD Efficacy Population is a subset of participants from the AT Population that started DTG at the proposed 
doses shown and who were enrolled at least 24 weeks prior to an agreed upon efficacy cut-off date. 
Key secondary analyses included virologic outcomes, based on HIV-1 RNA (c/mL), assessed through Weeks 
24 and 48. At both of these time points, the primary definition of virologic outcome will be calculated 
according to the Snapshot algorithm. Participants will be classified as virologic failures if they have missing 
HIV-1 RNA data throughout the window surrounding the time point of interest.   
Assessment report

Page 53/118 
 
  
  
 
ODYSSEY 
Safety Analyses 
In the ODYSSEY study and the sub-population included in the PK sub-studies, all ≥Grade 3 AEs, all SAEs, and 
all Grade 1/2 AEs leading to dose modification or DTG discontinuation were collected. AE analyses including 
the analysis of SAEs, ≥Grade 3 AEs, deaths, and other significant AEs were performed based on GSK Core 
Data Standards where applicable. Grade 1 or 2 AEs of TB which were treated with rifampin (and hence 
resulted in a doubling of the DTG dose to overcome the induction effect of rifampin on DTG and maintain PK) 
were not considered as Grade 1 or 2 AEs leading to dose modification. Exposure-adjusted incidence rate 
summaries and corresponding 95% CIs were produced for all AEs by SOC and PT. The 95% CIs were Poisson 
CIs. 
Results 
The initial submission included in the efficacy analysis are comprised of those who completed, or had the 
opportunity to complete, the Week 24 visit by the efficacy data cut-off date of 14 February 2019. For PK and 
safety, the data cut-off date is 30 April 2019. 
The P1093 study analyses have been updated with a data cut-off date of 12 December 2019. Revised efficacy 
analyses include a total of 66 participants with 48 weeks of follow up. The remaining 9 participants completed 
Week 48 after the revised data cut and key outcome data for these 9 participants are summarized 
separately.

Recruitment 
Judging by the distribution of site locations in relation to cohort, it appears that the younger cohorts overall 
have been studied in more challenging resource settings compared to the older.

ODYSSEY  
This study is being conducted in the following countries: 
Uganda, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Thailand, UK, Portugal, Spain, and Germany. Overall, the majority of 
participants were enrolled in Uganda (59 [60%] participants), followed by Zimbabwe (37 [37%] participants) 
and South Africa (3 [3%] participants). The first participant was recruited in Zimbabwe on 20 September 
2016. 
Conduct of the study 
P1093 
The original protocol has been amended 4 times and the original enrolment was based on age but under 
protocol Version 5.0 stratification by weight bands was introduced. In addition, C24h has been elevated to 
the primary PK target with AUC0-24h secondary. 
Participants receiving the FCT formulation were initially enrolled sequentially into Cohorts I and IIA. Version 
3.0 (16 January 2013) introduced granules for suspension. When it subsequently became clear that DT would 
be the commercially available paediatric formulation, new cohorts for DT were opened in Protocol Version 4.0 
(13 April 2016). Under protocol Version 5.0 (12 July 2018), the target enrolment in Stage I was increased to 
allow for additional examination of PK, safety, and tolerability by weight bands, including participants from all 
of Cohorts III-DT, IVDT, and V-DT. Additional cohorts and weight-band groups may be opened or reopened 
to investigate data gaps or new modifications to dosing, for example, regarding fasting requirements or 
background regimens. The fundamental procedure for evaluation of DTG doses remained unchanged through 
all protocol versions. 
With regard to PK parameters, in protocol versions 1-4, AUC0-24h was considered the primary target 
parameter and C24h was the secondary target parameter. Under protocol Version 5.0, based upon the 
request of the US FDA, C24h has been elevated to the primary PK target with AUC0-24h secondary. 
ODYSSEY 
The ODYSSEY protocol has been amended 3 times. 
Version 3.0 (18 January 2017) clarified non-DTG INSTIs could be included as a standard of care third agent 
option, clarified secondary outcomes (from ≥50 and ≥400 copies/mL to <50 and <400 copies/mL), added the 
WBPK1 and WB-PK2 sub-studies.  
Version 4.0 (22 December 2017) added that up to 60 additional participants from 3 to <14 kg would be 
enrolled. The formulation and dosing information was added to Version 4.0 for the WB-PK1 sub-study. 
Clarification was added to explain that all participants, the original 700 planned for recruitment and the 
additional participants in the 3 lower weight bands would be followed up for a minimum of 96 weeks. 
Version 5.0 (01 March 2019) included recommendation to switch female participants on DTG-based regimen 
identified to be pregnant within the first 8 weeks after the last menstrual period to a non-DTG ART regimen if 
there are other good options available, update to the virological response component of primary outcome 
measure, addition of folate sub-study, updated safety information, collection of information on babies born to 
female participants, and an additional interview within the Qualitative sub-study.

Note: As of the data cut-off date of 28 February 2019, no data were collected under Version 5.0 of the 
protocol (the cut-off for enrolment was 07 December 2018). 
Baseline data 
Over 90% of participants in both the AT and PD Populations had prior ARV treatment experience. NRTI use 
was most common at 91% and 88% for the AT and PD population, respectively, followed by PI use (74 and 
76%) and NNRTI use (50 and 44%).

Table 26: P1093 Summary of Prior ARV for Treatment or Prophylaxis
Table 27: P1093 ARV Treatment History of the AT and PD Efficacy Populations 
More than 90% of participants recruited into P1093 were ARV experienced. A subsequent review of prior ART 
by drug class for the N=159 showed >90% exposed to prior NRTI use, >70% exposed to prior PI use, and 
50% to prior NNRTI use. As for specific agents used in prior ART, >50% of participants were exposed to the 
following; 3TC, LPV/r, and AZT while >40% were exposed to ABC and NVP. Collectively, this data 
characterizes the P1093 population as mostly ARV experienced, and nearly half of the patients experienced in 
2 or more regimens. 
ODYSSEY 
The demographic characteristics of the Safety Population are shown below. All participants were Black-African 
and approximately half (52%) the participants were female. Median age was 7.6 years and ranged from 0 to 
18 years of age; over half the participants (61%) were between 6 and 12 years of age. 48% of participants 
were treatment-naïve (starting first-line ART) and 52% of participants were treatment experienced (switching 
to second-line ART).

ODYSSEY 
Note that, since participants could have moved from 1 weight band to another and from 1 dose/formulation 
to another, participants can appear in more than 1 dose/formulation and weight band. All participants were 
included in the Safety Population (all ODYSSEY participants who also consented to enter either of the PK sub-
studies and received at least 1 dose of DTG). 
Table 32: ODYSSEY Study Populations by Weight Band (Safety Population) 
Outcomes and estimation 
In the original dataset the rate of virologic success at 24 weeks is relatively low in relation to the <50 c/mL 
cut-off, but many patients are in between 50-400 c/mL. Most likely, this reflects both the greater virological 
challenge in younger patients that often have high viral load at baseline, as well as compliance issues. In the 
youngest Cohort (V-DT) the virologic response is slower and rate of virologic success at 24 weeks is 41.2% 
when defined as <50 c/mL and 88.2% when defined as <400 c/mL. The number of patients that had reached 
week 48 were limited. 
In the updated dataset, the proportion of patients reaching below 50 and 400 c/mL is more or less 
unchanged compared to the earlier data cut off at week 48. One additional case of virologic failure has been 
identified, but this patient has regained virologic control without any change in ART.

Protocol defined virologic failure (PDVF) 
PDVF was defined as a confirmed decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA of <1.0 log10 c/mL at or after Week 12 
unless the HIV RNA is <400 c/mL or a confirmed HIV-1 RNA >400 c/mL starting at Week 24 or beyond on 2 
consecutive measurements at least 1 week but no more than 4 weeks apart. Virologic rebound in this study 
was defined as confirmed HIV-1 RNA >400 c/mL (on 2 consecutive measurements at least 1 week apart) 
after an initial confirmed response (on 2 consecutive measurements at least 1 week apart) of HIV-1 RNA 
<400 c/mL or a confirmed >1.0 log10 c/mL increase in HIV-1 RNA above nadir level (on 2 consecutive 
measurements at least 1 week apart). For the purposes of this study, nadir is defined as the lowest HIV-1 
RNA while on study drug that is >400 c/mL. 
PDVF was observed across all age cohorts, weight bands and formulations. For the 36 cases of virologic 
failure observed in the April dataset, 18/36 (50%) occurred in children and adolescents 6 years, 6/36 (17%) 
in children 2 to <6 years and 12/36 (33%) cases in children <2 years in age. 
Table 40: P1093 Protocol-defined Virologic Failure Over Time (through 30 April 2019) 
Through 12 December 2019, only 1 additional case of virologic failure has been identified: One participant in 
Cohort V experienced virologic failure at Week 24 (HIV-1 RNA >400 c/mL). The participant is still in the 
study, and has remained on ABC/3TC with DTG since randomization, and has subsequently suppressed 
through Week 60 with viral load declines from Week 24 at 402 c/mL at Week 32, 258 c/mL at Week 48 and 
183 c/mL at Week 60. 
Treatment-emergent Resistance 
Evidence of treatment-emergent resistance to a PI, NRTI, or NNRTI was seen in 8 participants at virologic 
failure. Of these 8 participants, 4 had virus with emergence of only secondary ARV resistance-associated 
substitutions that alone have little to no impact on drug susceptibility as compared to that of wildtype virus. 
The remaining 4 participants had virus with emergence of primary ARV resistance-associated substitutions at 
RT positions 184, 190, 215, and 230. In 7 of 8 cases, the OBT consisted of at least 1 agent seen in the prior 
ARV history. Emergent resistance detected for all 7 participants was associated with agents used in the prior 
ARV history. 1 participant had an OBT that introduced 2 new agents. Virus from this participant developed 
NNRTI substitution K238R and PI substitution L10I. This participant had previously been exposed to a PI 
agent but had no reported NNRTI history. Given the participants age of 2 years, a prior use of an NNRTI for 
PMTCT cannot be ruled out. Two participants had additional resistance testing conducted post the PDVF visit 
and results from both showed evidence of secondary ARV resistance only. Evidence of treatment-emergent 
resistance-associated IN substitutions was observed in 8/36 (22%) participants at PDVF. 
Of the 8 subjects with de novo INSTI resistance, only 3 had previous regimens without a core agent with a 
high barrier of resistance (i.e. PIs). Hence, it cannot be concluded that the cases with INSTI de novo 
Assessment report

resistance are related to HIV quasispecies with occult NRTI resistance caused by previous regimens with a 
low barrier of resistance.

Update of De Novo Resistance as of 12 December 2019 
There have been no additional occurrences of de novo integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) resistance 
other than the already described 8 cases. Through December 2019, 1 additional case of virologic failure in a 
participant in Cohort V has been identified as described above. Paired resistance testing for this participant 
could not be performed due to a low HIV-1 RNA at the virologic failure testing visit (HIV-1 RNA 402 c/mL).  
Discontinued Participants with Missing Paired Resistance Analysis 
The Applicant has investigated the number of participants who have discontinued from the study due to/with 
ongoing treatment failure, for whom paired resistance analysis is missing (due to viral load issues etc.). The 
table below provides a listing of the 5 participants identified. All 5 participants were missing integrase (IN) 
resistance testing at Baseline. Reasons for missed testing include insufficient sample volume and samples not 
identified for testing. Three participants had no or partial resistance test results at virologic failure. Reasons 
for missed testing include insufficient HIV-1 RNA for testing, insufficient sample volume for testing or no 
sample identified for testing.

Table 44: Participants with Missing Paired Resistance Assessments in P1093 
Of the treatment emergent RAVs, only a few are expected to affect DTG susceptibility single-handedly. E92Q 
and R263K confers FCs of approximately 1.5 and 2, respectively. 
G118R, also known to be selected by DTG in vitro (subtypes C and CRF AE_02, not subtype B, and not 
studied for all HIV subtypes), is the most common and relevant RAV with a fold-change of 5. This was not 
seen in the previous paediatric submission and has been a rare finding in large scale studies in adult patients. 
To see this key DTG mutation, which confers cross-resistance to the other agents in the INI class, in 5/36 
patients with PDVF is a sad finding. It may be that the mutation is present in a higher proportion of the 
children with unsuppressed viral loads, than detected so far in the PDVF-population of P1093.  
These 5 case narratives were further reviewed. Patients were of subtype B (N=2, Cohort I FCT and Cohort III 
granules for suspension), CRF28_BF (N=1, Cohort IIB granules for suspension), CRF01_AE (N=1, Cohort IV 
granules for suspension) and C (N=1, Cohort III dispersible tablets). Having prior treatment histories and 
resistance in mind, the de novo development of G118R seems related to sub-optimal selection of OBR in 
addition to DTG, emphasizing the importance that patients with previous drug resistance are managed in a 
specialist setting. It also shows that, although the resistance barrier of DTG is high, the risk of key resistance 
is higher than it is for boosted PIs, where this is hardly seen (even as part of a suboptimal regimen). The 
DTG-containing regimens given to these patients in practice concern functional monotherapy, or dual therapy 
(DTG + 1 potentially active NRTI) in combination with poor compliance. Concomitant NRTI resistance with 
both M184V and TAM RAVs were seen at failure, resistance that could have been present but not captured at 
baseline, given the prior treatment failures in many of the patients. 
As requested, the MAH has provided an update of de novo INSTI resistance in relation to prior regimens, 
baseline resistance, optimized background (OBT), HIV subtype and type of DTG formulation. INSTI resistance 
development appears related to several factors including baseline resistance, sub-optimal choice of OBT and 
adherence issues. It is acknowledged that INST resistance has been observed both in the SAILING and 
DAWNING trials, as well as in bibliographic data. However, none of these describe a rate of de novo INSTI 
development compared to the P1093 study, illustrating the particular challenges in treating HIV-infected 
children.

Palatability and Acceptability of the DT Formulation in P1093 
The palatability and acceptability of the DT formulation was assessed in age-based Cohort III-DT, Cohort IV-
DT and Cohort V-DT at Day 10, Week 4, and Week 24. The overall assessment is shown below. The DT 
formulation taste was acceptable to the majority of respondents (>98%) and there were very few problems 
with preparation or administration. 
Table 45: Summary of Palatability and Acceptability Responses for DTG DT – AT Population 
Summary of main efficacy results 
The Applicant has provided an updated dataset from the P1093 study as requested, allowing evaluation of 66 
(previously 24) patients at 48 weeks. The proportion of patients reaching below 50 and 400 c/mL is more or 
less unchanged. One additional case of virologic failure has been identified, but this patient has regained 
virologic control without any change in ART.  
The Applicant has committed to provide the ODYSSEY manuscript which will contain efficacy and long term 
safety results to 96 weeks as a Post Approval Measure, currently planned to be available by the end of 2021.  
From the available data, it can be concluded that the proportion of subjects with HIV RNA below 50 c/mL at 
week 24 decreases with younger age, but many patients are in the interval between 50-400 c/mL. This is 
likely related to adherence but could also be partly related to that infants and young children may be slower 
to reach virologic control due to higher baseline viral load. In the updated dataset the proportion of patients 
reaching below 50 and 400 c/mL at week 48 is more or less unchanged compared to the earlier data cut off. 
Among the patients with protocol-defined virologic failure there are 5 patients with treatment-emergent 
integrase RAVs (G118R) that are clinically relevant (FC 5). The MAH has proposed a wording for SmPC 
section 5.1 that is acceptable. Given that there were no additional cases of de novo ART resistance in the 
updated dataset, it is agreed with the MAH that a specific warning in SmPC section 4.4 is not warranted.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The P1093 study is not powered for a precise estimate of efficacy and no control arm is available for 
comparison. Rather, given that exposure is comparable, efficacy will be estimated through a PK/PD-bridge 
which is in line with EMA guidance. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The known challenges in treating HIV positive children are clear in the study estimates of efficacy, with 
relatively low proportions of patients reaching below 50 c/mL but about 83% reaching below 400 c/mL. When 
looking at patients fulfilling criteria for protocol-defined virological failure, there are 5 patients with 
treatment-emergent integrase RAVs (G118R) that are clinically relevant. Although this is likely related both 
to poor optimization of the NRTI background and sub-optimal treatment compliance, this de novo DTG 
resistance development is now adequately described in SmPC section 5.1. 
It is clear that treatment emergent DTG resistance is a much larger problem when treating paediatric 
patients compared to adults, a difference that has not been seen to the same extent for protease inhibitors. 
The implications for patients failing second-line regimens containing DTG are potentially severe, as only one 
widely available ART class (PIs) remain and that even in cases where the future ART management is state-of-
the-art, there would be limited room to adjust for tolerability issues and contraindications. 
The SmPC section 5.1 updates regarding resistance development proposed by the MAH are acceptable. 
The Applicant has committed to provide the ODYSSEY manuscript which will contain efficacy and long term 
safety results to 96 weeks as a Post Approval Measure (REC), currently planned to be available by the end of 
2021. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Given that exposure is comparable, dolutegravir is effective in the treatment of HIV in paediatric patients.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
This application includes safety data from the P1093 study with data cut-off on 12 December 2019, the safety 
assessment includes data from all participants exposed to DTG at any dose (AT Safety Population). Safety 
data from the ODYSSEY PK sub-studies are also included with data cut-off on 28 February 2019, the safety 
assessment includes all participants who received at least one dose of DTG (the Safety Population). 
Patient exposure 
For study P1093 through the cut-off date of 12 December 2019, 156/159 (98.1%) participants in the AT 
Population had >24 weeks of exposure. Most participants, 150/159 (94%), in the AT Population had either 
reached the Week 48 visit or were off-study by this date. In the Safety Population of the ODYSSEY PK sub-
studies 86 (87%) participants were exposed to DTG for at least 24 weeks while 74 (75%) were exposed for 
at least 48 weeks. 
P1093  
As of 30 April 2019, a total of 159 participants were enrolled to the P1093 study, had taken at least 1 dose of 
DTG and are included in the AT Safety Population. The safety data of these 159 participants are captured 
through a data cut-off date of 12 December 2019. The median extent of exposure to DTG in the AT 
Population was 918 days (range 60 to 1993 days).

Adverse events 
The most common clinical AEs observed through Week 48 in the AT Safety Population in the December data 
cut were cough, rhinorrhoea, pyrexia, diarrhoea, nasal congestion, and vomiting. Frequencies of common AEs 
varied across weight categories without clear patterns. The majority of reported AEs are expected for this 
population since childhood infections are common, and frequently include URTIs, respiratory infections and 
diarrheal illnesses for children <5 years. Further, diarrhoea is a known adverse drug reaction for DTG. 
In the ODYSSEY PK sub-studies, the most commonly reported ≥Grade 3 AEs reported by the Week 24 
timepoint in 2 or more participants included neutropenia (4 cases) and anaemia (2 cases). In the ODYSSEY 
study only ≥Grade 3 AEs, all SAEs, and all Grade 1/2 AEs leading to dose modification or DTG discontinuation 
were collected, hence, the profile of common AEs differ from that in P1093.

Note: In the ODYSSY PK sub-studies, 86 (87%) were exposed to DTG for at least 24 weeks while 74 (75%)  
were exposed for at least 48 weeks. There were no Grade 1 or 2 SAEs leading to dose modification or withdrawal.  
Further, there were no AEs considered drug-related following ERC adjudication and no fatal reports. ≥Grade 3

To account for the potential differences in the duration of exposure of participants across weight band, 
formulations and dose, the rate of AEs per period of exposure was calculated in each study. 
P1093 
In P1093 EAIRs were evaluated by weight band at the time of AE occurrence. This ‘safety weight’ 
presentation of data was confined to participants receiving the DT formulation (i.e. weight bands <25 kg).

Growth Measures 
Changes in weight, height, BMI were followed in both P1093 and the ODYSSEY PK sub-studies. Median Z-
scores for weight, height, and BMI were reviewed at Baseline and over time by enrolment weight band up to 
Week 48 in Study P1093 and up to Week 96 in the ODYSSEY PK sub-studies. Brief summaries of the 
observations are presented below for the AT Safety Population (P1093 through 30 April 2019) and the Safety 
Population (ODYSSEY PK sub-studies through 28 February 2019). 
Weight 
In P1093, the median Z scores for participants weighing ≥35 kg at enrolment remained above the 50th 
percentile while the medians of participants in the lower enrolment weight band categories remained below 
the 50th percentile. In the ODYSSEY PK sub-studies some improvement over time in weight Z scores was 
apparent.  
Height 
In P1093, the Z scores remained consistent and no difference was observed between enrolment weight bands 
while in the ODYSSEY PK sub-studies some improvement over time in height Z scores was apparent. 
BMI 
In both studies, where data were available, no clear changes in Z scores were apparent over time. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) 
AESIs that have been determined for DTG are discussed in this section. These AESIs have been identified 
based on non-clinical and/or clinical safety data for DTG (e.g., GI disorders, renal disorders, hepatobiliary 
disorders), labelling and/or regulatory authority interest for INSTIs and/or the INSTI class (e.g., psychiatric 
disorders, rhabdomyolysis and myositis, serious rash and/or hypersensitivity), increased incidence of IRIS; 
and/or regulatory requirements. 
New AESIs in the December dataset were identified based on a review of AE onset dates (i.e., AEs with onset 
later than 30 April 2019) identified in the December listings. 
Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome Events: 
This is discussed in the section on immunological events. 
Hypersensitivity and Rash:

Seven participants (4.4%) experienced a clinical event from the Hepatobiliary disorders SOC. All events were 
Grade 1 (6 of Hepatomegaly and 1 of Ocular icterus) and none were considered related to study treatment. 
There were no serious clinical AEs reported from the Hepatobiliary disorders SOC.  
ODYSSEY 
There were no AEs reported in the Hepatobiliary disorders SOC, however, there were 2 participants who 
experienced Grade 4 Hepatitis A (1 serious). Both participants met liver stopping criteria and stopped 
treatment with DTG, although neither were considered related to treatment. 
There was also 1 participant who experienced non-serious, Grade 3 hepatic enzyme increased including ALT 
and AST increased. The participant had slightly raised AST/ALT at Screening and Grade 1 AST at Day 1. 
Grade 3 AST and ALT elevations occurred at Week 24 and were isolated elevations which resolved 15 days 
later with no interruption to study treatment. In addition, at Week 24, the participant reported a nonserious 
AE of thrombocytopenia (Grade 3), which also resolved in parallel with the liver enzyme elevations. 
Psychiatric Disorders Including Suicidality 
Psychiatric AEs reports are dominated by patients with pre-existing conditions, similar to what is seen in 
adults. None of the other AESIs reported raise any issues of a different safety profile compared to adults. 
P1093 
Through 30 April 2019 fifteen participants reported 1 or more AEs (mainly Grade 1 or 2) from the Psychiatric 
disorders SOC. Of the 15 participants reporting a psychiatric event, 9 were from the oldest age cohorts 
(Cohort I [6 participants] and Cohort IIA [3 participants]). The remaining 6 participants were from younger 
enrolment cohorts (Cohort III [4 participants] and Cohort IV-DT [2 participants]).  
Between 30 April 2019 and 12 December 2019, there were no additional SAEs or ≥Grade 3 AEs from the 
Psychiatric disorder SOC. Further, there were no new treatment related AEs observed in the Psychiatric 
disorder SOC. As previously reported, only the AE of Initial insomnia was considered possibly related to study 
treatment. The Initial insomnia was experienced by one participant at Week 40 (Grade 1) and Week 168 
(Grade 2). An additional 3 participants reported 1 AE each from the Psychiatric disorders SOC for the first 
time. These AEs were irritability (Grade 1, unrelated) in the 6 to <10 kg enrolment weight band at Week 48, 
anxiety (Grade 2, unrelated) in the 10 to <14 kg enrolment weight band at Week 108, and ADHD (Grade 2, 
unrelated) in the 14 to <20 kg weight band at Week 144. The nature of the new psychiatric events AEs in the 
December dataset are similar to those reported in the April dataset. 
Overall, of the 18 participants with 1 or more AEs from the Psychiatric disorders SOC, 9 participants were 
part of the PD population and all but 2 of these 9 participants were ≥35 kg at enrolment weight band.

The following terms were reported: Depressed mood (1), Depression (3), Depressive symptoms (1), Major 
depression (2). Across weight categories, there was only 1 depression event reported in the first 48 weeks 
(Grade 2 Depression). The remaining events of depression were reported post Week 48. 
ODYSSEY 
There were no AEs reported in the SOC of Psychiatric disorders. 
Gastrointestinal Disorders: 
P1093 
Over half of participants (83/159, 52%) reported one or more event from the GI disorders SOC through the 
cut-off date of 30 April 2019. GI AEs were commonly reported, with Abdominal pain, Diarrhoea, Nausea, 
Decreased appetite, Gastroenteritis and Vomiting being the most common. GI events were reported across all 
enrolment weight bands and were mainly Grade 1 or 2 events.

Through Week 24, there was 1 SAE of Grade 3 diarrhoea (with concurrent Grade 2 IRIS) in a participant 
enrolled in the 6 to <10 kg weight band. In addition, while formally captured under the Infections SOC, there 
were 4 SAE reports of Gastroenteritis through Week 24. After Week 24, only 1 further GI SAE was reported, 
and this occurred between Week 48 and the data cut-off. None of these SAEs were considered related to the 
study treatment. 
Grade 3 Events: 
In the P1093 AT Safety population, 6 participants experienced 1 or more Grade 3 GI AEs and none of these 
were considered related to study treatment.  
Between 30 April 2019 and 12 December 2019, there were no additional SAEs or ≥Grade 3 AEs from the GI 
disorders SOC. There was 1 new treatment related AEs of vomiting (Grade 1) observed in a participant from 
the 10 to <14 kg enrolment weight band. 
By 48 weeks of treatment gastrointestinal events including diarrhoea (26.4%), vomiting (21.4%), and 
gastroenteritis (12.6%) were among the most common to be reported in this study. There were no clear 
patterns in the updated December dataset in terms of proportions of clinical AEs reported across weight band 
categories through 48 weeks of treatment. 
Overall, no differences in the GI safety profile were apparent between the April and December datasets for 
both the AT and PD Safety populations. 
ODYSSEY 
There was 1 participant in the 6 to <10 kg weight band receiving 15 mg DT who reported Grade 3 diarrhoea 
(non-serious) 14 days after start of treatment. Dehydration (Grade 3) was also reported by the investigator 
at the same time. The diarrhoea was reported to resolve after 3 days and was not considered related to 
treatment. 
Musculoskeletal Disorders: 
P1093 
A total of 26 participants reported 1 or more AE from the Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
SOC many (15/26) of which were 35 kg at enrolment. In the AT safety population, the most common 
musculoskeletal AEs were Arthralgia, Back pain, Musculoskeletal chest pain, Musculoskeletal pain, Neck pain 
and Pain in extremity. All (with the exception of the Grade 3 AE of Pain in extremity described below) were 
Grade 1 or 2. There was a pattern of more musculoskeletal AEs in participants enrolled in the higher weight 
band categories (>14 kg). There were no serious musculoskeletal AEs through the final data cut-off. 
Grade 3 or Severe Adverse Events  
There was a single Grade 3 AE from the Musculoskeletal SOC of ‘Pain in extremity’ (≥35 kg enrolment weight 
band [Cohort IIA, FCT]), which was not considered related to study treatment.

Renal Disorders: 
P1093 
There were no participants with clinical renal AEs which were serious or of ≥Grade 3 severity. 1 participant 
with persistent proteinuria and raised urinary ACR required follow up with a nephrologist.  
There was one additional clinical renal AE reported through 12 December 2019 (Grade 1 dysuria reported at 
Week 96). 
ODYSSEY 
There were no study treatment related renal AEs. 1 participant experienced nephropathy (PT: nephropathy 
toxic) (SAE, Grade 4) 406 days after starting treatment with DTG. Nephrotoxicity was considered unrelated 
to study drug.

The assessments of the protocol team concurred with those of the site investigator. 
It was initially reported that the participant developed generalized convulsions at home having previously been

occurred. Formal investigation including post-mortem examination into possible causes of death ruled out expected causes 
including non-accidental injury. The cause of death was considered as unknown.

From Week 24 through Week 48, there were only 2 additional participants in the AT Safety Population who 
experienced SAEs by 12 December 2019. 
•  Cellulitis (Grade 3, not related) which occurred at Week 40 in a participant from the 10 to <14 kg 
enrolment weight band who was not included in the PD population. This SAE was previously reported 
in the April dataset. 
• 
Plasmodium falciparum infection (Grade 3, not related) at Week 48 in a participant from the 6 to <10 
kg enrolment weight band from the PD population. This SAE is new to the December dataset.

Beyond Week 48, an additional 14 participants (total 30/159 [18.9%]), in the AT Safety Population reported 
an SAE. Seven of these participants were from the ≥35 kg enrolment weight band (i.e. the older age cohort) 
and the late onset SAEs in these participants were more often from the Infections and infestations SOC. 
There were 2 female participants who reported deep vein thrombosis, not related to study drug, at Weeks 
108 and 144, respectively. One had been casted and immobilised post orthopaedic surgery and the other 
presented with large-B-cell lymphoma in the groin on the same side. In the updated December dataset one 
participant with numerous previous SAEs reported 2 new SAEs; pneumonia (Grade 3, not related) and 
pneumonia adenoviral (Grade 3, not related). 
Most of the participants with SAEs started study treatment in the 2 lowest enrolment weight bands and SAEs 
were most frequently from the Infections and infestations SOC. The most commonly reported SAEs through 
Week 24 included IRIS (n=3) and Gastroenteritis (n=4). 
In-stream safety data was reviewed for 9 participants who had not reached Week 48 for the efficacy analyses 
by the 12 December 2019 cut-off date. This did not identify any significant new information, and notably no 
new SAEs or ≥Grade 3 AEs were reported for these 9 participants between 12 December 2019 through their 
respective Week 48 visits. 
ODYSSEY 
Eight (8%) participants in the Safety Population reported SAEs through the data cut-off. The majority of SAEs 
were from the Infections and infestations SOCs and typically resolved with continued DTG treatment. None of 
the SAEs, reported in 8 participants in total, were considered related to treatment.

(listing 5).This SAE is not included in the summary tables unless stated otherwise.  
Global safety database search 
In order to provide up to date safety data from both P1093 and the ODYSSEY PK sub-studies, the Applicant 
has searched their global safety database to identify new SAEs/pregnancy cases and existing SAEs/pregnancy 
cases with significant follow up information received through 30 June 2020. 
For P1093, 11 new SAEs in 7 participants were identified through 30 June 2020, and this includes newly 
enrolled participants. In 9 of these SAEs, the event was from the infections and infestations SOC. Of these 
infectious events, 5 were respiratory, 1 was hepatic, 1 was gastrointestinal, and 2 were other infectious 
events (1 event of plasmodium falciparum infection and 1 event of cellulitis mentioned above). The remaining 
included 1 event of ALT increased (follow up is ongoing) and an event of a respiratory disorder. For the 
ODYSSEY PK sub-study participants (limited to the N=99 participants included in the ODYSSEY CSR), 4 new 
SAEs in 4 participants were identified through 30 June 2020. For 3 of these participants, the event was an 
infection, and the remaining event was status epilepticus/epilepsy in the context of a previous seizure and 
acute bacterial meningitis. Four participants from P1093 and 3 participants from the ODYSSEY PK sub-studies 
had new medically significant follow up information during the period through 30 June 2020. In summary, a 
review of this in-stream SAE and pregnancy data from the Applicant's global safety database does not reveal 
any significant new findings and is in line with previous observations.  
Laboratory findings 
In both P1093 and ODYSSEY most ≥Grade 3 laboratory events were ANC decrease and the younger / lower 
body weight participants had common baseline factors including black African race (where natural levels of 
ANC are overall lower). For study P1093 a consideration is the use of DAIDS toxicity reference tables rather 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/540603/2020 
Page 90/118 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
than WHO references for ANC. In the ODYSSEY study neutrophil grading is based on WHO 2010 guidelines 
recognizing the lower normal levels in African populations. 
Overall, the laboratory findings do not indicate a different safety profile compare to adults.  
P1093 
Clinical chemistry analyses were carried out on the AT and PD Safety Populations. Fasting was not required 
for these analyses. However, if triglycerides were Grade 2 or higher (using DAIDS toxicity table for fasting 
triglycerides), a complete fasting lipid profile (triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL, and LDL) was to be drawn.  
For the December dataset through Week 48, laboratory events were typically Grade 1 or Grade 2 (113/155). 
The most common laboratory events through Week 48 were Blood bicarbonate decreased (114), Blood 
sodium decreased (82), ANC decreased (70), Haemoglobin decreased (58), Blood glucose decreased (50). 
This pattern in most common laboratory events was similar to that reported through Week 48 in the April 
2019 datasets. 
Through Week 48 in the December analysis, there was a higher frequency of ≥Grade 3 laboratory AEs in the 
lower weight categories, although most participants in each weight category had at least 1 laboratory event 
including all participants enrolled to weight bands <14 kg. There was 1 serious laboratory AE (ALT increased) 
which occurred in the 6 to <10 kg enrolment weight band.  
Consistent with the analysis of the April dataset, the December dataset showed that most abnormal 
laboratory findings occurred during the first 24 weeks of treatment. Beyond Week 48 (in the December 
analysis), there were no new serious laboratory AE and 2 additional ≥Grade 3 laboratory AEs reported.  This 
pattern was also observed in the PD Safety Population.

Serious Laboratory Events 
Only 2 participants reported serious laboratory AEs meeting ICH seriousness criteria through the data cut-off 
of 30 April 2019. There were no new serious laboratory AEs reported through 12 December 2019. 
• 
In one participant (6 to <10 kg at enrolment), Grade 3 serious ALT increases were reported at Weeks 
2 and 4. These were considered unrelated to study drug on both occasions.  
• 
In one participant (≥35 kg at enrolment), two Grade 4 serious events of ANC decreased were 
reported at Weeks 96 and Week 144, the initial occurrence was considered probably not related and 
the second considered not related.

≥Grade 3 Laboratory Events 
Most Grade 3 or 4 laboratory events were reported in the first 24 weeks of study treatment. Compared to 
heavier participants at enrolment, there was a pattern of higher frequency of ≥Grade 3 laboratory AEs in the 
lowest enrolment weight bands (ranging from 3 to <20 kg). The most common ≥Grade 3 laboratory event 
was ANC decrease.  
Table 60: P1093 ≥Grade 3 Laboratory Adverse Events through Week 48 by Enrolment Weight 
Band through 12 December 2019 (AT Safety Population) 
ODYSSEY 
Only ≥Grade 3 events were reported in the study, along with Grade 1 or 2 events leading to either withdrawal 
from study treatment or a dose modification. However, there were no Grade 1 or 2 events meeting these 
criteria. The profile of median ALT, Bilirubin, Creatinine, Haemoglobin, and ANC median levels over time 
followed the patterns seen in adult studies. No differences were apparent across weight categories. The 
majority of post-baseline emergent laboratory abnormalities were maximum Grade 1 or 2 and there were few 
≥Grade 3 laboratory events. The commonest AE reported was neutropenia, and this was reported in 5 
participants, see details below. Most ≥Grade 3 laboratory events occurred during the first 24 weeks of study 
treatment. 
Liver Chemistries/Hepatobiliary Findings 
P1093 
Through Week 24 in the AT Safety Population, there were 6 participants with Grade 3 hepatobiliary laboratory 
AEs. Through Week 48, there were 7 participants that experienced Grade 3 hepatobiliary laboratory AEs. No 
additional participants experienced hepatobiliary Grade 3 laboratory AE through the end of the data cut-off. 
There were no Grade 4 increases in liver enzymes observed through the end of the 12 December 2019 data 
cut-off.

Serious Laboratory Events (Increased ALT) 
One 10-month old participant in the 6 to <10 kg enrolment weight band experienced 2 serious laboratory AEs 
and 1 non-serious laboratory AE of Grade 3 increased ALT at Week 2, Week 4, and Week 16. This participant 
had raised liver enzymes at Baseline (Day 0) but which on re-testing showed sufficient improvement to allow 
participation in the study. This participant had required treatment with multiple courses of antimicrobials 
because of 3 episodes of pneumonia over the 2-month period prior to enrolment in the study. None of these 
raised ALT levels were considered related to study treatment.  
≥Grade 3 Severe Laboratory Events  
There were 3 participants that experienced Grade 3 increases in ALT through the data cut-off; all events 
occurred during the initial 24 weeks of treatment. None of these were considered related to study treatment. 
There were no Hy’s Law cases (ALT>3xULN and bilirubin>2xULN). 
There was 1 participant from the 10 to <14 kg enrolment weight band from the PD population that 
experienced Grade 3 blood ALP increase, which occurred at Week 32, not considered related to study 
treatment. This event was resolved to Grade 2 Blood ALP increase 1 week later and then to Grade 1 after an 
additional 3 weeks. 
ODYSSEY 
There were 3 participants with ALT ≥5xULN, and 2 of these participants had ALT ≥10xULN (but <20xULN). 
Two of these participants met the protocol-defined liver stopping criteria and withdrew from DTG treatment.  
In addition, one participant (in the 20 to <25 kg weight band, 25 mg FCT DTG once daily) experienced ALT 
≥5xULN (but <10xULN). This participant had non-serious AEs of ALT increased (Grade 3), AST increased 
(Grade 3) and hepatic enzyme increased (Grade 3) that were considered not related to study drug. These 
were isolated elevations, which occurred at Week 24 and resulted in no interruption in study treatment. 
There were no contemporaneous clinical AEs reported. The AEs were reported resolved 15 days later. Overall, 
the mean time from first dose to first ALT elevation ≥3xULN was 194 days (ranging from 161 to 253 days). 
1 participant had a combination of ALT ≥3xULN and bilirubin ≥2xULN at any postbaseline visit. This 
participant also experienced an SAE of Hepatitis A infection and an SAE of bacteremia both considered not 
related to study treatment. 
Bilirubin 
P1093 
Median blood bilirubin varied over time, with no clear increases or decreases observed across weight 
categories. In total, 15 participants reported increased blood bilirubin all of which were reported in 
participants ≥14 kg at and many in the heaviest participants (≥35 kg) at enrolment (8/15).  
≥Grade 3 Severe Laboratory Events (Increased Bilirubin) 
Most increased bilirubin findings (12/15) were Grade 1 or 2 events. There were 3 participants that 
experienced Grade 3 increases in total bilirubin through the data cut-off, in all 3 participants ATV was

reported as part their concomitant ARV. In 2 participants this occurred during the initial 24 weeks of 
treatment and in the third through 48 weeks. None of these Grade 3 increases were considered related to 
study treatment. 
ODYSSEY 
Median bilirubin values for the Safety Population appeared to increase at post-baseline timepoints. The 
change from baseline showed that there was little change in median bilirubin at Week 24 and 48 for the 
Safety Population. 
There were no ≥Grade 3 increases in bilirubin through the data cut-off. 
Renal Findings 
P1093 
Small increases in creatinine were noted across weight groups by Week 4 and remained between Week 4 and 
Week 48. There were very few Grade 1 increases in creatinine reported. Through Week 24, there were 3 
participants who reported Grade 1 increases in creatinine (2 participants of 14 to <20 kg at enrolment and 1 
participant of ≥35 kg at enrolment). No additional Grade 1 or 2 increases were seen after Week 24. There 
were 2 participants, both from the 3 to <6 kg enrolment weight band, with ≥Grade 3 Creatinine increase by 
Week 24. Neither of these were considered related to study treatment. One additional clinical renal AE was 
reported through 12 December 2019 (Grade 1 dysuria reported at Week 96). 
Table 61: P1093 Summary of ‘Blood Creatinine Increased’ by Enrolment Weight Band through 30 
April 2019 (AT Safety Population) 
ODYSSEY 
Participants with raised Creatinine: 2 participants had abnormal creatinine levels (maximum Grade 1 or 2). 
The first individual appeared to recover. The second had a matching abnormal eGFR at the same time as the 
abnormal Creatinine. There were no clinical AEs reported and no evidence of renal toxicity. 
GFR was estimated in participants using the creatinine based "Bedside Schwartz" equation (eGFR in 
mL/min/1.73m2 = (0.413 × Height in cm) / Creatinine in mg/dL).

At Week 48, there appeared to be a small decrease in median eGFR in the Safety Population. 
Bicarbonate Findings 
P1093 
The most common laboratory event reported in the P1093 study through the most updated December data 
cut-off, of any severity, was decrease in bicarbonate.  
Decreased blood bicarbonate was reported in 114 participants after the start of treatment by the Week 48 
time point. Overall, there were a total of 118 participants with this lab abnormality at the most recent data 
cut at any time (including before the start of treatment). These 118 participants include 4 who had low 
bicarbonate reported pre-dose but not at any later time point, and therefore a total of 114 participants were 
reported in the lab abnormality summary tables. There were 10 participants who had a maximum Grade 3 
(n=7) or Grade 4 decrease reported (n=3) at any point on study (pre and post Baseline). 
Considering baseline or screening samples, >50% (73/118) participants had an abnormal bicarbonate level 
before study treatment started i.e. at screening, or baseline, or both. These abnormal levels were either 
Grade 1 or 2. 
There were no clear patterns for individual participants with observed Grade 1 or 2 bicarbonate 
abnormalities: these were either isolated events, or a fluctuating sequence of low bicarbonate events, without 
apparent clinical impact. Individual participants with Grade 3 or 4 low bicarbonate appeared to have low 
bicarbonate results in every, or almost every sample taken, including baseline.  
Demographic Factors 
Reports of decreased blood bicarbonate at any time were received from all 9 countries with the highest 
number of reports from Zimbabwe (n=25), South Africa (n=21), US (n=22), Thailand (n=16) and Brazil 
(n=12). As noted in the Table below, decreased bicarbonate was observed at least once in 100% of 
participants from Zimbabwe, Kenya, Botswana and Uganda, and in 75% or more of participants from the 
remaining countries. In the US, however, only 44% of participants had decreased bicarbonate reported. 
Table 62: Participants with Decreased Bicarbonate by Country 
Most reports involved Black or African American participants (n=83), followed by Asian (n=17) and White 
(n=9). Ethnicity was reported as other (n=6), unknown (n=2) or multiple (n=1) in the remaining 
participants. There were slightly more reports in females (n=63) compared to males (n=55).

Page 96/118 
 
  
  
 
 
Grade 3 or 4 Cases of Decreased Bicarbonate 
Of the 10 individual cases of (maximum severity) Grade 3 or 4 low bicarbonate all were in participants <14 
kg and from 3 sites in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and Kenya. Three of ten participants with a Grade 3 or 4 low 
bicarbonate had ZDV use reported during study treatment. 
Review of all 10 participants with Grade 3 or 4 low bicarbonate showed that in 8 participants, a low baseline 
or screening level was observed pre-study drug (either Grade 1 or Grade 2), and levels fluctuated over time 
in all participants without clear pattern. For 7/10 participants, bicarbonate was observed to be below the 
lower limit of normal at all, or nearly all time points, including before first dose of study drug. Time to the 
observation of the most severe grade of bicarbonate varied in these 8 participants but was observed by Week 
24 in 7/8 of these participants.  
There was no apparent temporal association with study drug, nor any obvious alternative aetiology. 
Generally, levels fluctuated before and after the Grade 3 or 4 event was reported. These Grade 3 / 4 low 
bicarbonate levels all improved upon re-testing.  
Grade 2 or 1 Cases of Decreased Bicarbonate 
Review of the 50 participants with maximum severity Grade 2 low bicarbonate cases shows that 41/50 (82%) 
had abnormal bicarbonate (Grade 1 or 2 severity) at baseline or screening. Of the remaining 9 participants, 
times to onset varied. Review of the lab results for these participants varied between Grades 0, 1 and 2, and 
showed no particular pattern, with some fluctuating, some just occasionally abnormal, and others reported 
almost continuously or continuously. There were no participants with Grade 2 low bicarbonate who were ≥25 
kg at enrolment. 
Fifty-eight participants had maximum Grade 1 low bicarbonate and of those 24/58 (41%) already had a 
Grade 1 bicarbonate abnormality at baseline / screening. In those with normal baselines, times to onset 
varied across the first 24 weeks in 26 participants but was reported only after 24 weeks in 8 participants. 
Grade 1 low bicarbonates were observed across weight bands/age cohorts and spread across weight bands: 
<20 kg (35/58 [60%]), and 23/58 (40%) ≥20 kg. There were no clear patterns with Grade 1 low bicarbonate 
reports, although the slight majority were in younger/lower weight participants. 
Analysis of Zidovudine Use in Relation to Low Bicarbonates  
The applicant has provided an analysis of zidovudine (ZDV) use and 44/159 (28%) participants had ZDV use 
at baseline and 74/159 (47%) participants had ZDV use at any time during the study in the AT population. 
The analysis shows that regardless of use either at baseline or at any time, ZDV use is not associated with 
observations of low bicarbonate in the P1093 study.

through 30 April 2019) 
MAH discussion of findings of decreased bicarbonate 
The findings of Bicarbonate decrease were assessed by the protocol team and an external consultant (NIH 
nephrologist). It was concluded that the pattern of low bicarbonate in the smaller participants, the clustering 
at 2 sites, and the disparity between bicarbonate levels in the single paired blood gas and metabolic panel 
sample suggested that artefact was the most likely aetiology. This phenomenon has been explored by other 
groups who report that vacutainer tubes are not practical when taking blood samples from babies and small 
children. Thus, screw top blood tubes tend to be used instead of vacuum tubes. With screw top blood tubes 
there is a risk that blood samples get exposed to air for longer, potentially leading to the artificial decreases 
in bicarbonate. 
Conclusion on findings of decreased bicarbonate 
The clustering of Grade 3 or 4 low bicarbonate events in younger/lower weight participants at certain sites 
could indicate an issue with blood sampling in these smaller paediatric patients as suggested by the 
Applicant. The majority of these participants had low bicarbonates pre-study drug. Overall, the reports of low 
bicarbonates events pre-study drug were reported in 73/118 (62%) participants and do not indicate an 
association with DTG-treatment and no association with ZDV use was observed.

ODYSSEY 
No reports of bicarbonate decrease (only ≥Grade 3 AEs, all SAEs, and all Grade 1/2 AEs leading to dose 
modification or DTG discontinuation were collected). 
Lipase Findings 
P1093 
Most increases in lipases in the AT Safety Population were Grade 1 or Grade 2, and most occurred by Week 
24. In general, there was a higher number of events in the lower weight bands (3 to <6 kg and 6 to <10 kg). 
Most participants who reported increases in lipase through 30 April 2019, were enrolled into cohorts receiving 
DT (12/21) and oral granules (6/21) with fewer participants in FCT cohorts (3/21). There were 2 participants 
with ≥Grade 3 lipase increases through the Week 24 data cut-off, and 1 additional participant by Week 48. 
These cases were not considered related to study treatment. None of these 3 participants, nor any 
participant, had increased amylase at any point through the data cut-off. There was no clinical suspicion of 
pancreatitis in these participants. No participant discontinued study treatment due to lipase elevations. 
In the December dataset one grade 2 lipase increased was reported as drug-related. Two reports of grade 3 
lipase increase (on consecutive days, not related) was reported at Week 48 in a participant (participant had a 
previous report of a grade 4 ANC decrease at Week 8).  
ODYSSEY 
No reports of lipase increase (only ≥Grade 3 AEs, all SAEs, and all Grade 1/2 AEs leading to dose 
modification or DTG discontinuation were collected). 
Haematology findings 
P1093 
Most occurrences of Haemoglobin decreased occurred in the first 24 weeks of treatment. There were 3 
participants (2 from the 3 to <6 kg and 1 from the 10 to <14 kg enrolment weight bands) with Grade 3 
Haemoglobin decreased through Week 24. All 3 were receiving cotrimoxazole from the start of treatment with 
DTG, and all 3 had low haemoglobin values (Grade 1 or 2) at Baseline. All 3 participants continued in the 
study. These Grade 3 events were not considered related to study treatment.

The majority of decreased in haemoglobin were maximum Grade 1 or 2 and mostly occurred in the first 24 
weeks of treatment. Three (3%) participants had emergent Grade 3 decreases in haemoglobin through the 
data cut-off. Concurrent clinical events of anaemia (all Grade 3, nonserious, which resolved with continued 
DTG treatment), were reported in all 3 cases. All 3 participants had decreased haemoglobin at enrolment; 2 
of the participants had Grade 1 decrease in haemoglobin at Baseline and 1 participant had Grade 2 
haemoglobin decreased at Baseline. 3TC (in addition to ABC) was reported as concomitant ARV for all 3 
participants. No participants had emergent Grade 4 haemoglobin decrease through the data cut-off.

In the April dataset through Week 24, there were 16 participants, all from the <20 kg enrolment weight 
bands, with ≥Grade 3 ANC decreases. Through Week 48, an additional 2 participants from the 10 to <14 kg 
enrolment weight band experienced Grade 3 ANC decreases. At the end of the data cut-off, an additional 3 
participants experienced ≥Grade 3 ANC decreased. Four of the 5 participants with Grade 4 ANC decreased 
were from the <20 kg enrolment weight bands.

84. Concurrent clinical events of neutropenia were reported in all 5 participants. All clinical events of 
neutropenia were non-serious, not drug related and resolved with continued DTG treatment. 3TC/ABC was 
reported as concomitant ARV in 4 participants and 3TC/ZDV in 1 participant. 
All 5 participants reported concomitant use of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim at the time of PK sampling, for

Immunological events 
Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome Events: 
In the P1093 AT Safety Population, there were 4 cases of IRIS (3 serious and 1 non-serious) reported 
through the cut-off of 12 December 2019. 
One participant from the 3 to <6 kg enrolment weight band, (Cohort IV), suffered from IRIS (serious, Grade 
3) which was considered related to the study treatment. This event occurred on Day 14 (Week 2 Visit). 
Another participant from the 3 to <6 kg enrolment weight band (Cohort IV-DT) reported IRIS (non-serious, 
Grade 2) on Day 34 (Week 4 Visit). This IRIS event was not considered related to the study treatment. Two 
participants from the 6 to <10 kg enrolment weight (Cohort III-DT, Cohort IV-DT) suffered from IRIS (both 
serious, Grade 2). Both events were considered related to the study treatment. These events occurred on 
Day 34 (Week 4 Visit) and Day 36 (Week 4 Visit), respectively. 
In ODYSSEY there were no reports of IRIS. 
Hypersensitivity and Rash: 
In the P1093 AT Safety Population and ODYSSEY studies, there were no cases of hypersensitivity, no ≥Grade 
3 rashes, and no serious skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, or 
Erythema multiforme reported.

Serious events from the Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder SOC were reported in 2 participants 
(Angioedema and Urticaria); both were Grade 3 events (considered unrelated to study treatment).  
Grade 3 Events: 
Through 30 April 2019, most participants (72/75) reported Grade 1 or 2 Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorder events except 3 participants with Grade 3 events (Angioedema, Urticaria and Alopecia [all 
considered unrelated to study treatment].) One Grade 2 event of Rash in one participant was considered 
possibly related to study drug.  
Between 30 April 2019 and 12 December 2019, there were no additional SAEs or ≥Grade 3 AEs or treatment 
related AEs from the Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder SOC.  
ODYSSEY 
One participant experienced a Grade 2 rash (initially reported by the investigator as hypersensitivity reaction) 
25 days after the first dose of DTG and ABC, and unknown time after the first dose of 3TC. The rash resolved 
following a short course of prednisolone. There was no interruption to study treatment. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
From a clinical perspective, this application raises no new safety issues regarding interactions. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal 
P1093 
No adverse events resulted in permanent discontinuation of DTG. 
ODYSSEY 
Two participants withdrew from DTG due to AEs in the ODYSSEY PK sub-studies. These participants met liver 
stopping criteria and were subsequently diagnosed with Hepatitis A. The cases of Hepatitis A were not 
considered related to DTG by the MAH.

Post marketing experience 
The GSK Global Clinical Safety database was searched for spontaneous or post-marketing cases reporting use 
of DTG single entity through 30 April 2019. A total of 7442 spontaneous and post-marketing cases were 
retrieved. Of these, 51 unique cases were identified in patients <18 years of age (excluding paediatrics cases 
where exposure to DTG was in utero or via breastmilk). Paediatric cases were identified through review of 
patient age (in years), ICH age groups, sub-population flags (children and adolescents) and free text 
narratives searches for relevant terms such as baby, juvenile, toddler and teenager. The majority of 
paediatrics cases identified (37/51) involved adolescents ≥12 years of age with few cases reported in 
younger children <12 years (14/51).  
The post-marketing data from children below 12 years of age are very limited. The non-solicited post 
marketing reports are compatible with the known safety profile of DTG. The two fatal cases both appear 
related to underlying disease (pulmonary hypertension and chronic lung disease). 
Children <12 years of age (N=14) 
A total of 14 spontaneous cases were identified in children <12 years of age. Cases were received between 
2014-2019 and were derived from Sweden (n=4), Germany (n=3), France (n=2), Israel (n=2), Argentina 
(n=1), Mexico (n=1) and the United States (n=1). Age (years) was reported in 7 cases and ranged between 
2 and 10 years old.  
Case outcome was not reported/unknown in all 14 cases. 
Nine of the 14 cases reported off-label use, 7 of which involved children aged between 2 and 10 years old. 
Age (in years) was not specified in the remaining 2 cases, however both referred to use in children <12 years 
old. A further case described treatment of children with higher than recommended doses of DTG (PTs: 
Overdose, Product use issue). All cases were non-serious and no clinical AEs were reported, with the 
exception of 1 case which reported abnormal blood count. This poorly documented case involved a 9-year-old 
female who experienced abnormal leucocyte count (not further specified) on an unknown date which 
improved from 4300 cells/µl to 6400 cells/ µl after DTG was discontinued (positive de-challenge). Other 
concomitant medication included TDF and 3TC. This was considered off-label use as the child received 30 mg 
per day rather than 35 mg per day for children weighing between 30-40 kg per the German SmPC.  
Of the remaining 4 cases, 3 were a cluster of poorly documented cases from Sweden involving children of 
unspecified age who experienced tiredness, headache and decreased appetite an unknown time after starting 
DTG. The remaining case was a serious report involving a child of unspecified age and reports increased HIV 
RNA following a stem cell transplant and cessation of ART. 
Limited data available suggest that post-marketing use of 25 mg and 10 mg, which support pediatric dosing 
in children weighing <40 kg, is low. It is therefore not unexpected that there were few reports in younger 
children (<12 years). 
Adolescents ≥12 years to <18 years of age (N=37) 
A total of 37 cases were identified in adolescents ≥12 years and <18 years of age. Cases were received 
between 2014-2019 and were derived from Brazil (n=7), France (n=6), United Kingdom (n=5), United States 
(n=4), Colombia (n=2), Israel (n=2), Mexico (n=2) and 1 case each from Canada, Sweden, Romania, 
Ecuador, Switzerland, Estonia, Portugal, Netherlands and Kazakhstan.

There were 2 fatal cases, 1 of which reported pulmonary hypertensive crisis in a 14-year-old patient one 
month after RAL was switched to DTG. The patient had medical history of pulmonary hypertension and heart 
disease. Other ARVs included ABC, 3TC, and DRV/r. The case was poorly documented with no information on 
HIV status or viral load provided. The second case involved a 17-year-old female who was hospitalized due to 
pneumonia and later died due to multi-organ failure, cardiac failure and general physical health deterioration 
an unknown time after starting DTG and FTC + TDF. The patient previously suffered from chronic lung 
disease, from HIV and had not been compliant with ARV medication at the start of treatment with viral load 
reported in the hundreds of thousands (unit not specified). Viral load decreased as the subject received 
treatment to 400-440 (unit not specified) and was later undetectable. Decreasing lymphocytes was reported 
in the weeks leading up to death (to below 200; units not specified) with CD4+comprising around 10% of 
total lymphocytes. 
Psychiatric disorders: 15 events reported in 9 patients, the majority of which were nonserious. There were 3 
serious events in 2 subjects including suicidal ideation in a 16-year-old male subject 12 days after initiating 
DTG containing therapy. The subject was placed under observation and a positive dechallenge was reported 
when treatment with DTG ceased. The patient had a prior history of depression and trauma. The second case 
involved a 16-year-old female who experienced persecutory delusion and olfactory hallucination 77 days after 
starting DTG and ATV. Both ARVs were discontinued and a positive de-challenge was reported. The subject 
had a history of persecutory delusion. 
Gastrointestinal disorders: 14 events reported in 9 patients, mainly consisting of nonserious listed events 
(vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea) or non-specific terms (gastrointestinal disorder). There were 2 
serious pancreatitis events one of which was poorly documented although normalization of lipase was 
reported following discontinuation of DTG-containing regimen. The second case reports acute pancreatitis and 
abdominal pain in an adolescent male 11 days after starting DTG, ABC and 3TC. ARV treatment was 
discontinued, and clinical pancreatitis resolved over 3 days, with improving laboratory biomarkers and 
symptom resolution. The reporter considered the acute pancreatitis to be related to DTG, ABC and 3TC. 
Pancreatitis is included in the product information for 3TC. 
Renal disorders: no serious renal events were reported. There was 1 poorly documented case reporting non-
serious events of glycosuria, proteinuria and renal disorder in a 16-year-old male. 
Hepatobiliary disorders: 1 poorly documented case of serious hepatitis in an adolescent an unknown time 
after starting DTG and RAL. Hepatitis is a listed event for DTG.  
Hypersensitivity and rash: 1 poorly documented serious case reported anaphylactic reaction in 17-year-old 
female 1 day after starting DTG and an unknown time after starting co-suspect FTC + TDF. DTG was 
withdrawn and the outcome was unknown. Two further poorly documented cases reported hypersensitivity, 
both of which were nonserious events. 1 case described an allergic reaction in a 17-year-old female due to an 
unspecified work accident. The second case described allergic reaction in an adolescent, which was 
considered related to co-suspect RAL. Hypersensitivity is a listed event for DTG.  
Pregnancy: exposure during pregnancy was reported in 4 patients aged between 15-17 years of age, 3 of 
which resulted in live births without apparent congenital anomalies. The final case resulted in a spontaneous 
abortion at 22 weeks gestation with no apparent congenital anomaly. Concurrent didelphic uterus was 
reported as a factor in this case.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The dolutegravir paediatric study programme is not powered to generate a comprehensive safety database in 
children and in the data currently presented, no control arm is available for comparison. Rather, given that 
exposure is comparable, safety will be extrapolated through a PK/PD-bridge which is in line with EMA 
guidance. 
It is agreed that the established safety profile of dolutegravir does not raise any serious concerns regarding 
increased Cmax levels in children. However, it cannot be excluded that currently listed ADRs such as 
headache, insomnia and gastrointestinal discomfort have an exposure response related to Cmax. 
PK data from P1093 and ODYSSEY trials were analysed against clinical AE and laboratory events and found 
no relationship between DTG Cmax or AUC0-24h and selected AEs. However, due to the limited number of 
participants the model does not lend itself to any firm conclusions. Further review of participants in the 20 to 
< 25 kg weight band, with the highest Cmax, didn’t reveal any safety signal but given the limited data in 
each weight band this provides only limited reassurance. 
The limited safety data from dosing 50 mg BID in adults are of limited relevance when assessing Cmax, and 
rather speaks to the benefits of BID dosing to meet the PK variable most important for efficacy (Cmin) 
without having to increase the total daily dose, and subsequently AUC and Cmax, beyond acceptable limits. 
However, as the current safety concerns are non-serious, the above must be weighed against the clear 
benefits of once daily dosing, including long-term adherence. Also, there is regulatory precedence from the 
darunavir paediatric development programme. For darunavir the Cmin, Cmax, and AUC24h values for DRV in 
treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects from 3 to <6 years of age were 1.33-, 1.81-, and 
1.62-fold higher, respectively, than in adults receiving DRV/rtv 800/100 mg QD (sub-study of TMC114-
C211). 
Hence, in view of the CHMP, the QD posology is acceptable but an alternative BID dosing scheme is needed 
to guide subscribers who wish to split the daily dose to better match the adult PK profile .  The Applicant has 
provided a separate table with an alternative BID dosing scheme in the SmPC Section 4.2 and the CHMP 
agrees with this approach with minor linguistic adjustments. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In the limited paediatric safety dataset, there are no signs of a different safety profile of dolutegravir in 
paediatric HIV patients from 4 weeks of age compared to adults.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The global burden of HIV and the specific paediatric challenges are well-known. In 2018, 160,000 (110,000–
260,000) children aged 0-14 acquired HIV infection globally. In the Western and Central Europe and North 
America region, the estimated number of children living with HIV in 2013 was 2,800 (2,300–3,600), and it is 
estimated that over 95% of these children were receiving antiretroviral therapy [UNAIDS, 2014].  
Globally, deaths among children younger than 15 years of age are reported to be declining. At the end of 
2018, an estimated 100,000 (64,000–160,000) children aged 0-14 years had died from AIDS- related 
causes, representing 52% fewer deaths in this age group than in 2012 [UNAIDS, 2019]. In North America, 
Western and Central Europe, fewer than 200 children died from AIDS-related illnesses in 2012 [UNAIDS, 
2013].

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Combination antiviral therapy with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) protease and reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors has significantly reduced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related 
morbidity and mortality. However, emerging multi-class drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
strains as well as potential long-term toxicities warrant development of new antiretroviral therapies without 
or with limited cross-resistance to available drugs. 
Given the more limited pharmacological armamentarium in the treatment of paediatric patients below 6 years 
of age, there is an unmet medical need for additional antiretroviral agents from the integrase inhibitor class. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study P1093 (ING112578) is an ongoing Phase I/II multi-center, open-label non-comparative, dose-finding 
study of at least 120 HIV-1 infected infants, children, and adolescents ages ≥4 weeks to <18 years to 
evaluate the PK parameters, safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of DTG when administered both prior to 
starting and in combination with optimized background therapy (OBT). This study enrolled children in age-
defined cohorts sequentially from oldest to youngest. 
Study ODYSSEY (201296) is an ongoing, open-label, multi-center, randomized (1:1), non-inferiority, Phase 
II/III, 96-week, 2-arm clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of DTG plus 2 NRTI vs. SoC in ~700 
HIV-infected children aged less than 18 years who are starting first-line ART or switching to second-line ART. 
Both P1093 and ODYSSEY include patients between 4 weeks and 18 years of age. The original enrolment in 
P1093 was based on age but data has post hoc been regrouped based on weight. In the ODYSSEY study 
patients are grouped according to weight bands. 
In this application only safety and PK data have been presented from the ODYSSEY study while the efficacy 
data are from the P1093 study only. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The favourable effects of dolutegravir are well-known from the adult pivotal trials and extensive post 
marketing experience since approval. In this paediatric application, the efficacy is established through a 
PK/PD-bridge. The key PK target for efficacy is expected to be Cmin, while AUC and Cmax are more 
important for bridging to the adult safety database. Hence, if exposure is comparable to what is seen in 
adults (or higher), dolutegravir is expected to be effective in the treatment of HIV in children from 4 weeks of 
age. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
It is well-known that the treatment of HIV in younger children is more challenging than in adolescents and 
adults. The proportion of patients reaching HIV-RNA below 50 copies/mL is substantially lower than what was 
seen in the dolutegravir adult pivotal trials. This may partly be explained by the greater virological challenge 
in younger children due to higher baseline viral loads, but also due to apparent issues with treatment 
adherence. In the P1093 study, there were at least 5 patients with treatment-emergent key integrase 
inhibitor RAVs (G118R) which has not been seen in a similar extent in adults, outside of the failed 
monotherapy dolutegravir trials. This is in contrast to protease inhibitors such as lopinavir, where virologic 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/540603/2020 
Page 114/118 
 
  
  
failure in children has not been associated with resistance development to the same extent. Development of 
integrase inhibitor resistance, and further NRTI resistance that is expected in these cases, can severely limit 
future treatment options. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of dolutegravir is well-established in adults and given that exposure is comparable, it is not 
expected to be substantially different in a paediatric setting. The limited paediatric safety dataset does not 
raise any age-specific issues other than an apparently treatment-emergent decrease in bicarbonate in the 
younger age groups, most likely related to technical blood sampling issues. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The main safety issue in this application is that with the proposed QD dosing and the formulations used, 
Cmax need to be higher (up to two-fold) to achieve AUC and Cmin comparable to the PK profile seen in 
adults. Hence, it cannot be excluded that dolutegravir ADRs such as insomnia, headache, nausea and other 
GI ADRs are more common in children than adults and that such events could possibly be underreported in 
younger patients. 
However, as the safety concerns related to dolutegravir are non-serious, the above must be weighed against 
the clear benefits of once daily dosing, including long-term adherence. Also, there is regulatory precedence 
from the darunavir paediatric development programme. For darunavir the Cmin, Cmax, and AUC24h values 
for DRV in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects from 3 to <6 years of age were 1.33-, 
1.81-, and 1.62-fold higher, respectively, than in adults receiving DRV/rtv 800/100 mg QD (sub-study of 
TMC114-C211). 
Hence, in view of the CHMP , the QD posology was acceptable and  an alternative BID dosing was presented 
by the Applicant in order  to guide subscribers who wish to split the daily dose to better match the adult PK 
profile, which was accepted by the CHMP. The Applicant has provided a separate table with an alternative BID 
dosing scheme in the SmPC Section 4.2 and the CHMP agrees with this approach.

* The GM target of 3.67 μg/mL represents a post hoc GM estimate in treatment naïve participants following 50 mg FCT QD DTG dosing. 
The lower limit (2.94 μg/mL) is selected as 80% of the GM Cmax (3.67 μg/mL). The upper limit (6.7 ug/mL) represents the 95th 
percentile of post hoc estimates in treatment experienced participants following 50 mg FCT BID dosing. 
** The upper range target is the 95th percentile observed in adults in Study ING112961 in which DTG was dosed twice daily 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Given the natural course of HIV, ultimately leading to AIDS and death within years for the vast majority of 
patients, there is no doubt that the overall benefits of ART vastly exceed the associated risks. 
The addition of dolutegravir to the pharmacological armamentarium for children between 4 weeks and 6 
years of age must be seen in relation to the currently limited paediatric ART armamentarium. Second-
generation integrase strand transfer inhibitors are overall well-tolerated, without extensive interaction issues 
and with a relatively high barrier to resistance.  
Hence, dolutegravir is anticipated to be an important drug for children aged 4 weeks and above.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Given that the approval is based on a PK-bridge to the adult efficacy and safety data, the key issue for 
approval is whether exposure is comparable with the QD dosing proposed by the Applicant.  
Regarding efficacy, the frequency of patients with HIV-RNA above the target level of 50 cop/mL is higher 
than in adults and risk of de novo INSTI resistance appear substantially higher. However, these issues appear 
to be mainly related to adherence. Regarding resistance, the Applicant has proposed additional wording in 
SmPC section 5.1 which is considered acceptable. 
The Cmax levels are up to approximately two-fold of those seen in adults, but as the safety concerns related 
to dolutegravir are non-serious this must be weighed against the clear benefits of once daily dosing, including 
long-term adherence. Also, there is regulatory precedence from the darunavir paediatric development 
programme to accept somewhat higher Cmax levels in favour of once daily dosing. Hence, in view of the 
CHMP, the QD posology is acceptable but an alternative BID dosing scheme is needed to guide subscribers 
who wish to split the daily dose to better match the adult PK profile. In the SmPC Section 4.2 the Applicant 
has provided a separate table with an alternative BID dosing scheme and the CHMP agrees with this 
approach with minor linguistic adjustments. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
Given that the Applicant accepts the proposed SmPC, the overall B/R balance for Tivicay is positive also for 
children from 4 weeks to 6 years of age. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of, Tivicay 5 mg dispersible tablets is favourable in the following indication: 
Tivicay is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected adults, adolescents and children of at least 4 weeks of age or older 
and weighing at least 3 kg. The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation 
for Tivicay subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2).

Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required  pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the

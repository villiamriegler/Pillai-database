SUMMARY OF POSITIVE OPINION* 
for  
ZEBINIX 
International Nonproprietary Name (INN): eslicarbazepine acetate 
On  19  February  2009  the  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  adopted  a 
positive  opinion,**  recommending  to  grant  a  marketing  authorisation  for  the  medicinal  product 
Zebinix, 400 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg, tablets intended for adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset 
seizures with or without secondary generalisation. The applicant for this medicinal product is BIAL - 
Portela & Ca,S.A. 
The  active  substance  of  Zebinix  is  Eslicarbazepine  acetate,  an  Antiepileptic  medicinal  product 
(N03AF04)  which  is  a  prodrug  of  eslicarbazepine,  third  generation  drug  belonging  to  the  family  of 
carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine. 
The benefits with Zebinix are the fact that, added to concomitant antiepileptic drugs it decreases the 
standardised frequency of seizures per month (median) from 7.7 to 5.0 on ESL 800 mg and from 8.0 to 
4.6 on ESL 1200mg, versus a decrease from 7.0 to 6.4 seizures observed in the placebo group. 
The percentage of responders (patients with a relative change in standardised seizure frequency ≥50% 
in comparison to baseline period) is also improved by ESL: 36.3% on ESL 800mg and 43.5% on ESL 
1200mg, versus only 21.5% observed in the placebo group. 
The most common side effects are dizziness, somnolence, headache, abnormal coordination, disturbed 
vision, nausea, rash, fatigue. 
A pharmacovigilance plan for Zebinix, as for all medicinal products, will be implemented as part of 
the marketing authorisation. 
The  approved  indication  is:  adjunctive  therapy  in  adults  with  partial-onset  seizures  with  or  without 
secondary generalisation 
Detailed  recommendations  for  the  use  of  this  product  will  be  described  in  the  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics (SPC) which will be published in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) and 
will be available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission. 
The  CHMP,  on  the  basis  of  quality,  safety  and  efficacy  data  submitted,  considers  that  there  is  a 
favourable benefit to risk balance for Zebinix and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing 
authorisation.

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update 
the description of the pharmacodynamic effects and 
clinical efficacy and safety based on final results from 
interventional studies: Trial 4378 (STEP 5) which 
compared the two-year effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg 
resulted in a significantly higher reduction in body weight 
compared to placebo. In STEP 8 trial, treatment with 
semaglutide once weekly for 68 weeks resulted in 
significantly higher reduction in body weight compared to 
daily liraglutide. In STEP 1ext trial, in the 52-week off-
treatment period from week 68 to week 120, mean body

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant has sought marketing authorisation for tezepelumab for the following indication:  
Tradename is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults and adolescents 12 years and 
older with severe asthma (see section 5.1). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Asthma is a chronic airway disease affecting approximately 334 million people worldwide and is 
responsible for approximately 250,000 premature deaths each year. 
Asthma prevalence varies by geographical region. Accurate assessment of the prevalence of asthma 
has been hindered by varying definitions of asthma and methods of data collection, each combining to 
make data comparison across studies difficult. 
Risk factors include sex (gender influence varies with age), airway hyper reactivity, atopy, allergens, 
infections, tobacco smoke, obesity, and perinatal factors. 
Asthma is common in adolescents but is frequently undiagnosed because of under-reporting of 
symptoms. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The disease is characterized by airway inflammation with oedema, cellular infiltration and mucus 
plugging, bronchial smooth muscle hypertrophy which results in variable airway obstruction and 
bronchial hyper-responsiveness. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, and diagnosis  
There is no single diagnostic test for asthma, the diagnosis is a clinical one. The absence of consistent 
gold-standard diagnostic criteria means that it is not possible to make unequivocal evidence-based 
recommendations on how to make a diagnosis of asthma. The diagnosis of asthma in children and 
adults is based on the recognition of a characteristic pattern of respiratory symptoms, signs and test 
results and the absence of any alternative explanation for these. 
Typical symptoms of asthma include periodic wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and 
cough, all of which worsen at night. Patients with asthma experience exacerbations of these symptoms 
which acutely worsen in response to various triggers such as allergens, microbes, and pollutants, 
resulting in significant reductions in expiratory flow as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 
second (FEV1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 10/215 
 
 
 
Symptoms and signs of asthma in adolescents are no different from those of other age groups. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The goals of chronic asthma management may be divided into two domains: reduction in impairment 
and reduction of risk. 
In clinical practice patients may have different goals and may wish to balance the aims of asthma 
management against the potential side effects or inconvenience of taking medication necessary to 
achieve perfect control. 
Effective asthma management requires a proactive, preventative approach, similar to the treatment of 
hypertension or diabetes. Routine follow-up visits for patients with active asthma are recommended, at 
a frequency of every one to six months, depending upon the severity of asthma. These visits should be 
used to assess multiple aspects of the patient's asthma and to discuss steps that patients can take to 
intervene early in asthma exacerbations (an asthma "action plan"). The aspects of the patient's 
asthma that should be assessed at each visit include the following: signs and symptoms, pulmonary 
function, quality of life, exacerbations, adherence with treatment, medication side effects, and patient 
satisfaction with care.  
Pharmacologic treatment is the mainstay of management in most patients with asthma. The stepwise 
approach to pharmacotherapy is based on increasing medications until asthma is controlled, and 
decreasing medications, when possible, to minimise side effects. Adjustment of the patient's 
management should be considered at every visit. 
The  first  step  in  determining  appropriate  therapy  for  patients  who  are  not  already  on  a  controller 
medication is classifying the severity of the patient's asthma.  
Many asthmatic patients remain symptomatic despite treatment with Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and 
Long-acting Beta antagonists (LABA) combinations (Rabe et al 2004). Treatment options then include 
the addition of other controller therapies including Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA), long-
acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), theophylline, and oral corticosteroids (OCS). Severe asthma can 
lead to a dependence on OCS with systemic corticosteroid exposure potentially leading to serious 
short- and long-term adverse effects. 
Biologic therapies can provide additional asthma control for patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma, 
and those targeting IgE, IL-4/IL-13, and IL-5 are now included in international treatment guidelines 
(GINA 2020) as an add-on treatment to patients uncontrolled with ICS/LABA treatment. Omalizumab 
may be suitable for a subgroup of patients with proven reactivity to an aeroallergen and elevated 
serum IgE levels who remain inadequately controlled with ICS plus LABA. Four additional biologics, 
mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, and dupilumab, have been approved for severe asthma with 
an eosinophilic phenotype and/or elevated levels of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), an 
inflammatory biomarker typically associated with eosinophilic asthma.  However, some patients will 
continue to experience exacerbations. Therefore, there is a need for new ways of addressing severe 
asthma across phenotypes and irrespective of specific biomarker levels, to help patients achieve 
asthma control. 
Specific evidence about the pharmacological management of adolescents with asthma is limited and is 
usually extrapolated from paediatric and adult studies. 
Decreasing therapy once asthma is controlled is recommended, but often not implemented leaving 
some patients over-treated.

2.2.  About the product 
Tezepelumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG2λ that specifically binds to Thymic stromal 
lymphopoietin (TSLP) and prevents its interaction with the TSLP receptor (TSLPR). In vitro, 
tezepelumab causes a dose-dependent inhibition of TSLP induced signal transducers and activators of 
transcription (STAT) activation and cell proliferation, confirming its potency in blocking the functional 
pathways of TSLP mediated inflammation. 
The applicant seeks marketing authorisation for the use of tezepelumab as an add on therapy for the 
treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years and older with severe asthma. The proposed posology for 
tezepelumab is 210 mg administered as a subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks (Q4W).  
The drug product will be supplied in an accessorized prefilled syringe (APFS) as a sterile, single-dose, 
preservative free solution, intended for subcutaneous injection, containing 210 mg deliverable drug 
product in concentration of 110 mg/ml.  
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the fact that the request for 
accelerated assessment has not been adequately substantiated. The applicant claimed that 
tezepelumab could provide a major therapeutic innovation by addressing an unmet medical need in 
subgroups of patients who may not be eligible for or fully benefit from treatment with available 
therapies due to baseline eosinophil counts. This was not fully agreed by the CHMP as for patients with 
normal blood eosinophil count but with raised FeNO, another biological medicinal product (dupilumab) 
was found to be efficacious. Therefore, the UMN was considered to be established in patients with 
severe uncontrolled asthma with normal blood eosinophil count and normal FeNO, although in this 
group of patients, oral corticosteroids could be used. In addition, the efficacy results for patients with 
both normal blood eosinophil count and normal FeNO were not presented by the applicant and indirect 
comparison of the efficacy results with other available therapies for this subgroup was not provided at 
the time of the request. Therefore, it was not clear whether this therapy will provide additional benefit. 
Further, information on the prevalence of this sub-population of patients (with normal blood eosinophil 
count and without raised FeNO) was not provided by the applicant. 
Based on the assessment of the request provided by the applicant, the draft CHMP guideline on the 
procedure for accelerated assessment pursuant to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) no 726/2004, the 
CHMP did not recommend to grant the accelerated assessment procedure pursuant to Article 14 (9) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for Tezepelumab.

2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General Information 
Tezepelumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G2λ monoclonal antibody directed against 
thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA 
technology. Tezepelumab has a molecular weight of approximately 147 kDa. Tezepelumab binds to 
human TSLP with high affinity and prevents its interaction with the heterodimeric TSLP receptor. 
The physical and chemical properties of tezepelumab are summarized in Table 1. 
Table 1. The physical and chemical properties of tezepelumab are summarized in Table 1. 
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation

Thousand Oaks or ATO), CA, US, in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). 
Additional site is indicated for quality control testing of active substance (Amgen Manufacturing Limited 
(AML), Puerto Rico, US). 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The active substance (AS) process begins with thawing a working cell bank (WCB) vial. The process 
includes culture expansion (N-9 through N-1) to generate a sufficient number of viable cells to 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 13/215 
 
 
 
 
inoculate the N production bioreactor, to produce tezepelumab. A single production lot is initiated from 
a single vial thaw. The scale of the AS is defined by the size of the production bioreactor (2 kL). Media 
and solutions used in cell culture are filtered through a 0.1 µm sterilizing-grade filter or irradiated or 
autoclaved prior to use. The purification of tezepelumab is achieved through a series of 
chromatography, filtration, and viral inactivation steps. Product pools may be held prior to processing 
at the subsequent step in accordance with the defined hold times. The manufacturing process flow 
diagram including in-process controls (IPCs) and process parameters is provided as well as sufficiently 
detailed narrative of each step. In general process is well described and expected data are provided 
according to CTD structure and ICH guidelines.  
Cell banks and raw materials  
A comprehensive overview of the used raw materials and reagents has been given. All raw materials 
used in upstream and downstream steps are either Ph. Eur. grade or testing performed on the 
materials is extensive and ensures control. Materials of human or animal origin are not used in the 
manufacture of AS.  
Tezepelumab is expressed in engineered CHO cells. The information provided on the development 
genetics is acceptable. A 2-tiered cell banking system is used. MCB and WCB testing is extensive and 
includes confirmation of sterility, absence of mycoplasma, in vitro and in vivo adventitious agents 
testing. Testing is in-line with testing outlined in ICH Q5A. Testing also confirms cell identity and 
genetic stability / confirmation of desired genetic manipulation. Cell substrate stability is supported by 
data for cells grown to the limit of cell age.   
Process validation 
Validation of manufacturing process is appropriately designed, in line with relevant guidelines and 
includes sufficient number of commercial scale batches. Almost all PP, CPP and IPC data were inside 
acceptable range detailed in S.2.2 or met defined validation criteria. Minor out of range excursions 
occurred during validation and appropriate summaries of investigation or adequate justifications are 
provided to support the conclusion that there is no impact on validation results. Batch release data for 
the validation lots met acceptance criteria / shows consistency. Provided results obtained during 
process validation indicate that manufacturing process is validated and consistently meet criteria for 
process performance and product quality.  
Fill uniformity has been demonstrated by comparison of protein and PS80 concentration at the 
beginning, middle and end of the fill. 
A manufacturing hold time for each in-process pool was validated at the commercial scale through 
demonstration of microbial control. 
Resin and membrane re-use and cleaning has been evaluated at small scale while confirmation on 
commercial scale is ongoing. Available and satisfactory cleaning and performance results are provided 
for resins and membranes, as well as protocols for concurrent validation of resins and membranes 
lifetimes, with additional details, such as conditions and methods used.  
Adequate data in support to transport qualification is presented in the dossier.  
A continued process verification approach is in place through applicant`s QMS which is shortly 
described. 
Summary and conclusions of risk assessment of all contact material regarding extractables and 
leachables is provided. applicant states that based on model prediction data, worst-case maximum 
quantity of potential extractables in a daily dose of tezepelumab would be 3.3 µg/dose, whereas 
manufacturers action threshold is 10 µg/dose. It is acknowledged that 3.3 µg of all potential 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 14/215 
 
 
 
extractables in a daily dose is probably negligible since it is expected that amount is even smaller for 
each individual compound. However, this was not clearly presented and further justification of action 
threshold was required in a D180 List of Issues (LoI). The applicant confirmed in more details that 
their strategy for risk of extractables and leachables is based on risk assessment and knowledge from 
the literature (provided within dossier) and in compliance with regulatory guidelines. Taking into 
account allowable daily intake, presented data from SUS evaluation (no compound specific toxicological 
assessment was determined to be required) and tezepelumab dosing regimen, it was concluded that 
no risk to patients is expected.  
Manufacturing process development 
In section S.2.6. applicant presents process development history, lot history, comparability, process 
design methodology, process characterisation studies for each step, process challenge studies, pool 
hold characterisation, chromatography resin and UF/DF membrane reuse and storage and integrated 
control strategy. 
The applicant has detailed the development of the manufacturing process. In doing so, changes have 
been described and supported by the reasons / justification for changes. Formulation changes 
(different formulation buffer and change from polysorbate 20 to polysorbate 80) occurred earlier in the 
development, before phase 3 clinical studies. Changes between clinical and commercial process are 
minor adjustments and mainly related to improvement in process output and robustness as well as 
improvements in impurity profile. Clear presentation is given in the dossier regarding lot history, as 
well as regarding comparison of material manufactured in earlier phases of development with 
subsequent processes.  
Comparability of the AS material manufactured through development is demonstrated using lot 
release, additional characterization and stressed stability testing. Comparability acceptance criteria are 
clearly defined.  Methods used for comparability exercises are sufficiently detailed and adequate proof 
of their qualification is provided. Appropriate discussion on the choice of the batches and justification 
for omission of specific batches from the comparability exercises is provided.  
Process design methodology is well described. The applicant has provided a detailed overview of how 
the process and its control strategy have been developed. PPs ranges are set based either on 
development (prior knowledge, risk assessment scoring, equipment ranges) and validated in 
commercial scale, either are based on results of process characterization studies. 
For each step, following is provided: (1) qualification of the small scale model used for process 
characterisation study, if applicable, (2) parameters which were selected to be studied in process 
characterisation based on risk assessment, (3) process performance indicators measured, (4) 
description of the design of the process characterisation studies, (5) results of the process 
characterisation studies, (6) summary of PPs effects (statistically significant / non-significant) on 
process performance indicators, (7) comparison of characterisation and acceptable ranges registered. 
Process development and characterization studies were performed using a small-scale models qualified 
by using a statistical test of equivalence to compare the means of the performance indicator data 
between the small-scale and large-scale data. Qualifications of small scale models and process 
characterisation studies are adequately and sufficiently described, as well as respective results and 
conclusions.  
Approaches for calculation of parameter ranges as well as IPCs limits are well described, reasonably 
sound and endorsed.  
Criticality assignment for PPs is based on impact ratio (calculation methodology is provided). 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 15/215 
 
 
 
Process parameters ranges registered in S.2.2. are same as ranges studied in process characterisation 
studies or narrowed, if PP was shown to have statistically significant impact on process performance. 
Process challenge studies were performed to assess process capability with respect to reduction of 
HCP, DNA, leached protein A, and HMWS. 
Small-scale characterization studies were conducted to evaluate the chemical stability of in-process 
product pools during extended hold times. Proposed hold times are acceptable.  
Small-scale characterization studies were performed to evaluate chromatography resin reuse and 
storage time for the protein A chromatography, CEX chromatography and HIC steps, as well as 
membrane reuse for the UF/DF step. Equal number of cycles evaluated at small scale is registered in 
S.2.2.  
In presenting control strategy, applicant first identifies QAs, including CQAs having an impact on AS or 
FP quality. Manufacturing process impact for each QA is shortly described. Approach is based on prior 
knowledge, experimentation (process characterisation), risk assessment and determination of 
functional relationship between material attributes and process parameters to AS CQAs. Based on QAs 
scoring, appropriate set of controls, derived from current product and process understanding is derived 
and thoroughly presented as integrated control strategy. Approach and methodology for development 
of control strategy is sufficiently detailed in the dossier and endorsed. 
Characterisation and impurities 
Broad and adequate panel of analytical techniques and methodologies was applied to evaluate primary 
structure, posttranslational modifications, charge and size heterogeneity, higher order structure, and 
biological activity. Theoretically calculated extinction coefficient is confirmed experimentally by AAA. 
Characterisation methods are qualified to be fit for purpose.   
Identified product-related impurities include HMWS, tryptophan oxidation and fragmentation and these 
have been characterised. Based on information submitted, it can be concluded that product-related 
impurities are well controlled to low levels, and are not expected to impact patient safety or product 
efficacy at the level controlled by the manufacturing process. The AS manufacturing process has been 
assessed for its potential impact on process-related impurities (HCP, DNA and leached protein A). In 
addition to process challenge and process validation results, impurities derived from the host cell and 
potential safety concern reagents were analysed for their clearance through the purification process. 
Except for HCP controlled as IPC at UF/DF step, DNA and leached protein A are not routinely 
monitored. This decision is based on development data, validation data and removal studies. 
Evaluation of the removal of small impurities (process reagents) is based on risk assessment, available 
literature data, calculation of safety margins and maximum daily doses of the tezepelumab product. 
applicant presented this approach in details and very clearly. Altogether, data demonstrate that 
process-related impurities are adequately controlled and cleared to acceptable levels by the 
tezepelumab manufacturing process. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification  
The specification for the active substance includes tests for appearance, identity, purity (isoforms, HCP 
and aggregates), potency and microbiological attributes. The limits are appropriately justified. 
As per Ph. Eur. monograph “Monoclonal antibodies for human use” the active substance is tested for 
appearance, identity, bioburden and bacterial endotoxins, product-related substances and impurities, 
as well as potency - biological activity by suitable analytical methods, comparing to a reference 
preparation where necessary. General tests as pH, osmolality and protein quantity are not included but 
are in-process control tests at the polysorbate addition step. Clarity is not included since active 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 16/215 
 
 
 
substance is further diluted but it is included in finished product specification. This is considered 
acceptable and judged as a risk taken by the applicant if the tests are not performed at the active 
substance release. The same conclusion is and for the in-process controls of acidic peaks, main peak 
and basic peak by CEX-UHPLC at the CEX column pool. All these control parameters are included in the 
finished product release specification. However, the revised active substance specification includes 
charge variants and HCP, as requested by Rapporteurs, with footnote stating that these tests are 
tested as IPCs. Shelf-life column is now included in revised active substance specification. The active 
substance should comply with the release acceptance criteria if tested at the end of shelf life for all 
parameters except those which are justified. For relevant parameters the shelf-life acceptance criteria 
also includes a footnote stating “Not tested during stability studies”. Polysorbate 80 is also not included 
but is a critical process parameter for the finished product. The risk taken by the applicant if the test is 
not performed at the active substance release is also valid for polysorbate 80. Process related 
impurities on active substance are not tested. HCP is controlled as IPC at UF/DF step and DNA and 
leached protein A are not routinely monitored. This decision is based on development data (S.2.6.), 
validation data (S.2.5.) and removal of impurities studies (S.3.2.). Approach is endorsed, however as 
stated above HCP is, as requested by Rapporteurs, included in active substance specification with the 
footnote stating that it is tested as IPC. A cross reference to the Ph. Eur. chapters and methods is 
included in the active substance specifications, where relevant. Proposed acceptance criteria are 
considered justified. For potency and SE-UHPLC (HMWS) acceptance criteria are tightened for active 
substance and finished product for release and for shelf life. For rCE-SDS (HC+LC) acceptance criteria 
are tightened for finished product shelf life only. For charged variants acceptance criteria at the level of 
finished product are maintained. The summary of the data from clinical trials Phase 1 and 2 are used 
to justify acceptance criteria for the finished product and active substance for SE-UHPLC, CEX-UHPLC 
and rCE – SDS. For those parameters, as well as for potency, tolerance intervals to target an overall 
process capability index (Ppk) of 1.33 are calculated (providing 4 sigma coverage at a 95% 
confidence). As already stated proposed acceptance criteria are considered justified. However, 
commitments are provided that re-evaluation of the current acceptance criteria for potency, SE-UHPLC 
(HMWS and Main peak), rCE – SDS (HC+LC) and charged variants by CEX-UHPLC in the tezepelumab 
AS and FP specification will be performed. For potency re-evaluation will be performed once data for 30 
FP commercial process batches are available, and for SE-UHPLC (HMWS and Main peak), rCE – SDS 
(HC+LC) and charged variants by CEX-UHPLC re-evaluation will be performed after results from 30 AS 
commercial batches are available.  
Analytical procedures and reference standards 
The analytical procedures used to test in- process and release samples are described. The method 
descriptions are found acceptable. Compendial methods are performed in accordance with current 
pharmacopoeia and referenced. In addition to receptor ligand binding method description, choice of the 
potency assay is presented, since two different assays (cell-based reporter gene bioassay and a 
receptor-ligand binding assay) are currently utilized for tezepelumab active substance and final product 
lot release and stability. The data collected from these two potency methods were used for the method 
comparability assessment and to justify the use of the receptor-ligand binding assay as the sole 
potency method for lot release and stability testing after approval. applicant`s proposal to use receptor 
ligand binding assay for the purpose of routine release and stability is supported. 
In general, all non-compendial methods are validated in accordance with ICHQ2 (R1). Since 
predetermined validation acceptance criteria were met, methods are considered validated for their 
intended use. However, even though that from the provided validation reports it is visible that 
validations were performed on tezepelumab active substance and/or finished product the discrepancy 
between the method numbers stated in the validation reports and documents provided in section S.4.2 
is noticed. Justification clarifying noticed difference, which is due to change in the manufacturer’s 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 17/215 
 
 
 
document management system, is provided. For potency testing by ELISA and HCP testing additional 
information on calculations is presented within response document to day 80 and/or day 150 list of 
questions together with the summary of the robustness study for HCP method.  
To date, two reference standards of tezepelumab have been produced: one interim and one primary 
reference standard. An interim reference standard was prepared early (Process 1) and it has been used 
so far for lot release testing of all active substance and finished product lots. The primary reference 
standard was produced from active substance clinical lot using Process 2 (clinical) at the ATO 
commercial production facility. It will be used for release and stability testing of active substance and 
finished product commercial lots. For primary reference material data on characterisation as well as 
summary report for qualification of potency of primary standard against interim standard is provided. 
Both reference standards have been placed on stability testing at the recommended storage condition 
at -70 °C ±10°C and at 2 to 8°C and stability data have been presented. Under storage conditions (-
70°C), 156 months stability data is available for the interim standard and the study is finished. Interim 
standard is stable under proposed storage conditions For the primary reference standard results at 3, 
12 and 24 months are available. All presented results are within acceptance criteria. Stability 
acceptance criteria for primary standard are aligned with the finished product batch release acceptance 
criteria.  
Quality attributes and analytical procedures for the qualification of future tezepelumab reference 
standard is given as well as the characterisation tests and analytical procedures for establishing a new 
standard. These are considered appropriate. Provided qualification protocol is applicable for 
qualification of all future reference standards which includes the working reference standard, as 
clarified by applicant.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data for tezepelumab AS is presented for all lots used during development and for AS 
manufactured at commercial scale (2kL) at the commercial manufacturing facility (ATO), except for the 
lot 3OU170928 which is used for LIVCA. All data complies with the AS specifications in place at the 
time of manufacture. The information seems sufficient and acceptable demonstrating consistency in 
manufacturing. 
Container closure 
The tezepelumab active substance container closure is a 12 L, disposable, triple-layer film Sartorius 
bag (EVA/EVOH/EVA) with tubings and fittings. Maximum and minimum fill volumes for tezepelumab 
CCS are 4 L and 12 L. 
An appropriate documentation on container closure system is provided, including a specification 
according to which the container is tested. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
The proposed shelf life for tezepelumab active substance is 48 months at -30°C ± 10°C.  
The stability data are available at long-term conditions (-30°C ± 10°C) up to 60 months for one 
supporting lot, up to 60 months for two primary lots, up to 48 months for another primary lot and up 
to 24 months for three validation lots. In addition, data are presented on accelerated conditions (+5 °C 
± 3°C) up to 9 months for one supporting lot, up to 6 months for three primary lots and three 
validation lots, and on stressed storage conditions (25°C ± 2°C) up to three months for one 
supporting, three primary and three validation lots. All parameters remain within the stability 
specification through 48 months, and demonstrate that, apart from an increase in HMW, no meaningful 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 18/215 
 
 
 
changes are observed up to the latest point tested. The proposed shelf life is therefore justified by 
real-time data obtained by testing a sufficient set of batches. Sections S.7.1 and S.7.3 should be 
updated with the amended stability acceptance criteria, when confirmed. 
The primary batches produced at ATO are considered representative of lots produced at the 
commercial manufacturing scale and site as demonstrated through comparability analysis presented in 
section S.2.6. The container closure system used for the primary and validation lot stability 
programme is representative to be used in the commercial process. 
The parameters tested for on-going stability cover the test parameters from the AS specification, 
except bacterial endotoxins and bioburden, which is considered acceptable taking into account that 
bacterial endotoxin is not stability indicating parameter and the fact that AS is stored frozen. The 
applicant has provided an additional justification for omitting parameters clarity, pH and protein 
content from all of the presented stability studies as well as future stability studies. The applicant has 
agreed to add CEX-UHPLC to the post-approval stability protocol which included only SE-UHPLC before 
that. An acceptable justification for not including rCE-SDS, colour and potency test in the post-approval 
stability testing protocol has been provided. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development  
Description of the product

quality, and comply with the corresponding Ph. Eur. monographs. No formula overages are included. 
Pharmaceutical development 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022

Components of the finished product are described. Formulation development studies included evaluation 
of the quality attributes of tezepelumab as a function of pH, buffer type, buffer concentration, excipient 
type,  excipient  concentration,  and  protein  concentration.  An  acceptable  overview  is  provided  on  the 
development of the formulation, including satisfactory data supporting the proposed composition of the 
commercial finished product. 
The  overall  process  history  and  the  changes  made  throughout  development  have  been  described  in 
sufficient details. The two processes have been used, designated as Process 1 and Process 2. Process 1 
finished  product  was  manufactured  from  Process  1  active  substance  and  it  was  used  in  phase  1  and 
phase 2 clinical studies. Process 2 finished product was manufactured from Process 2 active substance 
and  it  was  used  in  phase  3  clinical  studies,  including  the  pivotal  efficacy  study.  Changes  during 
development were introduced in formulation, storage conditions, container closure (vial, PFS-SA, APFS) 
and site transfer (ATO to AML). Comparability exercise was performed between Process 1 and Process 2 
clinical material, finished product in glass vials and PFS-SA, PFS-SA and APFS presentation, clinical ATO 
and  commercial  AML  sites  and  between  PFS-SA  and  commercial  APFS  presentations.  Comparability 
exercises  performed  are  in  compliance  with  ICH  Q5E.  Provided  data  demonstrate  that  the  quality  of 
tezepelumab finished product is not adversely impacted by the manufacturing process changes. 
The provided data for process characterization demonstrate that the finished product manufacturing 
process is robust and can deliver the required product quality and process consistency when operated 
within acceptable ranges.  
The primary container closure system (APFS) consists of a 2.25 mL type I glass syringe with a staked 
stainless steel needle, covered with an elastomeric needle shield, and a fluoropolymer laminated plunger-
stopper. Accessories include needle guard, plunger rod and extended finger flange. The compliance with 
relevant Ph. Eur., USP, JP and ISO requirements is stated. The sufficient data is provided on performance, 
safety  and  suitability  of  the  CCS.  Also,  the  relevant  data  on  performance  of  the  APFS  as  an  Integral 
Drug-Device Combination are provided in section 3.2.R, in accordance with the Medical Device Regulation 
(EU) 2017/745 (MDR).  
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
The  tezepelumab  FP  is  manufactured,  secondary  packed  and  tested  and  released  at  Amgen 
Manufacturing  Limited  (AML),  Puerto  Rico,  US.  Two  additional  sites  are  indicated  for  quality  control 
testing  (Amgen  Thousand  Oaks  (ATO),  CA,  US,  and  BioReliance,  Rockville,  US)  and  AstraZeneca  AB, 
Södertalje, Sweden is stated as a release site.  
Manufacturing  process  and  process  controls  are  clearly  described  and  consist  of  preparation  of 
formulation  buffer,  thawing  the  active  substance  statically,  followed  by  transfer  to  a  vessel  for 
formulation. The formulated FP is then filtered through a bioburden reduction filter and a sterilizing 0.22 
µm filter, and aseptically filled into syringes. After placing the plunger stopper, the syringes are 100% 
inspected  and  assembled.  Manufacturing  process  and  process  controls  are  adequately  presented.  FP 
batch size may vary between 30 kg and 115 kg, which corresponds to 15000-58100 filled FP syringes.   
Reprocessing is limited to re-filtration in the bioburden reduction filtration step, in case of failure in the 
post-filtration FIT, failure of integrity of the holding vessel and a breach in system integrity. Reprocessing 
criteria are considered acceptable. 
Process controls 
The FP manufacturing process critical IPCs and the  product  quality RTRT controls are presented. Pre-
filtration bioburden, post-filtration FIT and polysorbate 80 concentration are designated as critical IPCs, 
while deliverable volume is tested in-process in the manufacturing area as a real time release test (RTRT) 
and results are reported to the specification. The proposed critical IPCs/RTRT and its respective limits 
are  deemed  acceptable  and  sufficient  in  the  light  of  overall  control  strategy.  Provided  justification  for 
introducing the RTRT for deliverable volume is acceptable and in line with the relevant ICH guidelines. 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 20/215 
 
 
 
Process validation / verification 
Three  consecutive  commercial-scale  tezepelumab  FP  lots  were  produced  at  commercial  site  (AML) for 
formulation to filling process validation. Process validation has been performed on three batches of 31.0 
kg, 35.4 kg and 113.1 kg. The bracketing approach is appropriately justified and substantiated with data.   
The  assembly  process  qualification  included  six  runs  of  APFS  units/placebo.  All  release  results  met 
acceptance  criteria  in  place  at  the  time  of  process  validation  and  additionally  meet  the  commercial 
specification. Furthermore, all required process controls (i.e. process parameters and in-process tests) 
were met by all process validation lots and the FP manufacturing process can be considered successfully 
validated.  
Provided data support an aseptic hold time of 184 hours for filtrated formulated finished product (before 
sterile filtration) and the maximum filtration time of 72 hours. Results of the four initial media fills confirm 
that the tezepelumab finished product manufacturing process on the AML Syringe Line 1420 is performed 
aseptically. The maximum aseptic processing time of 192 hours supports single batch and also campaign 
production modes, designed to allow execution of series of production batches. The provided data for 
filter  validation  are  in  line  with  the  Guideline  on  the  sterilisation  of  the  medicinal  product,  active 
substance, excipient and primary container and are considered acceptable. The FP manufacturing process 
can be considered successfully validated to produce a sterile finished product. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
Specifications 
The specifications for the finished product includes tests for appearance, identity, purity (isoforms, HCP 
and aggregates), potency, physical and microbiological attributes. The limits are appropriately justified. 
As  per  Ph.  Eur.  monograph  “Monoclonal  antibodies  for  human  use”  the  finished  product  is  tested  for 
appearance (appearance, clarity, colour), pH, osmolality, volume, protein concentration, molecular size 
distribution, identity, purity (product-related substances and impurities), sterility, bacterial endotoxins, 
as  well  as  potency  -  biological  activity  by  suitable  analytical  methods,  comparing  to  a  reference 
preparation where necessary. Additionally, tests for sub-visible particles and container closure integrity 
are also part of the specification. Tests for the forces required for break loose of the plunger-stopper and 
extrusion of the liquid in the syringe are not included but these parameters were characterized during 
development. Omission of mechanical functionality of the syringe in the finished product specification is 
justified in section P.5.6. Polysorbate 80 is included in specification, as requested by Rapporteurs, with 
a  footnote  stating  that  the  test  is  performed  as  an  IPC.  The  approach  is  considered  acceptable.  The 
justification for omission of testing Polysorbate 80 from the finished product shelf life specification is also 
provided and considered acceptable. The parameter deliverable volume is part of the specification and 
test  is  performed  as  an  in-process  test  at  the  level  of  finished  product  by  Real  Time  Release  Testing 
(RTRT).  Acceptance  criteria  for  shelf  life/stability  testing,  where  different  from  release,  have  been 
detailed. The shelf life/stability acceptance limits for purity/impurities (SE-UHPLC, CEX-UHPLC and rCE-
SDS)  are  different  from  the  release  specification  limits.  The  shelf  life  column  is  now  included  in  the 
revised finished product specification, and finished product should comply with the release acceptance 
criteria if tested during or at the end of shelf life for all parameters except those which are justified. For 
parameters for which is relevant the shelf life acceptance criteria also have footnote stating “Not tested 
during  stability  studies”.  For  subvisible  particles  the  finished  product  will  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  2.9.19 
when  tested,  but  since  the  method  applied  is  not  in  accordance  with  Ph.  Eur.  2.9.19,  as explained  in 
P.5.2 section, that is reflected in finished product specification and reference to USP <787> and JP is 
given. For deliverable volume two method codes are given and in that way the link between 3.2.P.5.1, 
P.5.2  and  P.5.3  sections  for  deliverable  volume  (MET-401998  and  SOP-430443)  is  established.  The 
insertion of Polysorbate 80 in the FP specification, as requested by the rapporteurs, is reflected in P.5.6 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 21/215 
 
 
 
section  appropriately  and  acceptance  criteria  are  as  for  IPC.  The  acceptance  criteria  are  considered 
justified as stated in active substance section. 
Analytical procedures and reference standards 
The analytical procedures used to test in- process and finished product release and stability samples are 
described. For the method used for the concentration of polysorbate 80, description is provided in section 
P.3.4. Most of the methods are compendial and are performed in accordance with current pharmacopoeia 
and referenced. Non-compendial methods used to analyse finished product samples are described. For 
analytical procedures common to active substance and finished product link to active substance is given. 
Validation/qualification reports for the methods used to analyse finished product are provided.  
An  elemental  impurities  risk  assessment  was  performed  on  tezepelumab  FP,  in  line  with  ICH  Q3D 
guideline. A risk assessment demonstrated that the total amount of elemental impurities in tezepelumab 
finished  product  is  below  30%  of  the  Permitted  Daily  Exposure  (PDE)  according  to  ICH  Q3D  limits. 
Provided  data  is  acceptable  and  no  further  assessment  or  control  is  required.  The  results  from  the 
Nitrosamine Risk assessment report concluded that there is no significant risk identified for presence or 
formation of nitrosamines in tezepelumab and no significant risk to patient safety. applicant’s conclusion 
is endorsed.  
Batch analysis 
The  batch  analyses  data  for  44  tezepelumab  FP  lots  used  for  non-clinical,  clinical  trials,  stability  and 
process validation are provided. Summary tables of the finished product batches and their intended use 
and use in clinical studies are provided in section 3.2.P.2.3. All batches met the acceptance criteria used 
at the time of testing. The results demonstrate consistency of the manufacturing process capabilities. 
Container closure 
The container closure system (APFS) consists of the following components: 
• 
• 
• 
type I glass syringe barrel, with a needle 
elastomeric needle shield 
bromobutyl elastomeric plunger stopper, laminated with a fluoropolymer film 
•  non- contact product materials (extended finger flange, needle guard and plunger rod). 
The  components  are  sufficiently  described  and  compliance  with  relevant  Ph.  Eur/USP/JP  monographs 
and ISO standards is stated. 
Manufacturing/sterilization sites of primary container closure components are stated. The syringes are 
manufactured  by  Becton  Dickinson  (BD)  Pharmaceutical  Systems,  USA  and  the  plungers  are 
manufactured by BD Pharmaceutical Systems and West Pharmaceutical Services, USA. The syringes and 
plunger  stoppers  are  supplied  pre-washed,  siliconized,  and  sterilized.  Justification  for  the  selection  of 
methods for sterilisation for primary container components is found acceptable.   
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life for the finished product is 36 months for the FP stored at 5°C. Additionally, 
storage for one month up to 25°C is proposed in order to facilitate dosing. The stability studies have 
been performed per ICH stability guidelines, at recommended storage conditions (5°C), accelerated 
(25°C and 30°C) and stressed conditions (40°C). 
The proposed shelf life is supported by real-time stability data (36 months) at recommended storage 
conditions for three primary PFS-SA batches, in line with ICH Q5C. Results of stability of the three 
primary batches during 36 months are within the specification limits and do not show significant 
changes during time. For 3 validation lots data are available for up to 18 months at 5⁰C. 36-month 
stability data at recommended conditions are also available for two supportive APFS batches. Primary

lots have been manufactured at ATO manufacturing site (proposed for quality control of the applied 
product and not proposed for manufacturing of the pharmaceutical form). 
Data at accelerated storage conditions are provided for finished product vials, which is acceptable since 
comparability to finished product in PFS-SA has been demonstrated. The 6-month data are available 
for two primary batches of FP in vials and two supportive batches. APFS and PFS-SA batches are tested 
at accelerated conditions for a shorter period (1-3 months). A change in LC+HC and HMWS has 
occurred within the 6 months at accelerated conditions. The proposed shelf life is anyway supported by 
the real-time data at recommended conditions, and entirety of the stability data at recommended, 
accelerated and stressed conditions demonstrate that the tezepelumab stability profile and modes of 
degradation are well characterized and understood. For that reason, performing additional stability 
studies on a third primary batch or PFS-SA and AFPS configurations at accelerated conditions during 6 
months is not deemed necessary.  
Additionally, a one-month shelf life at up to 25°C within the recommended shelf life is supported by 
the stability dataset obtained by testing three primary batches stored at 25°C and 30°C for two 
months. Apart from batches tested at the beginning of the shelf life, the age (time of previous storage 
at recommended conditions) of the FP batches in this study was 18 months (one batch), 22 months 
(two batches) and 34 months (three batches). The results are within the specification limits and results 
up to one month do not show any significant change. Humidity level for elevated temperature 
conditions is not indicated, which is acceptable since the finished product is supplied as an aqueous 
solution in a primary container of negligible moisture permeability and stored at 2-8°C. 
Results of the temperature cycling stability study are provided for one batch up to the 30-month 
endpoint. At the initial testing point, the PFS-SA was already 6 months old after completion of thermal 
cycling. Therefore the temperature cycling stability study is completed and covers the shelf life of 36 
months. The results are within the acceptance criteria. 
The container closure system used in the stability studies is confirmed to be identical to those 
proposed for routine storage. The approach to use the PFS-SA lots only in primary stability studies, as 
well as for the post-approval stability protocol is considered as acceptable, given that there is no 
difference in product contact with the primary container between PFS-SA and the APFS configurations, 
and comparability has been demonstrated between commercial PFS-SA and APFS presentations.  
The methods used for testing are stability indicating and are chosen in accordance with the predicted 
degradation pathways. The parameters tested during stability studies were: general (appearance, 
colour, clarity, pH, subvisible particles), purity/impurity (HMWS, HC+LC and charged variants), 
potency, break loose and extrusion, deliverable volume (supporting APFS lots only), sterility and/or 
CCI (for PFS-SA lots only). Sterility is tested at lot release and then it is replaced with annual CCI 
testing. The approach is considered acceptable. Protein concentration is tested for information only. 
Osmolality and BET are not tested, which is considered acceptable since BET is not stability indicating 
parameter while changes in osmolality should be detected by testing other parameters. The applicant 
has confirmed that all the methods used in the stability studies as well as that all methods that will be 
used for the future studies are the methods stated in the section P.5.2 and S.4.2.  
Apart from minor changes in accordance with the predicted degradation pathways, no trends have 
been observed with the provided stability data at recommended conditions. All the results remained 
within the stability acceptance criteria. The proposed shelf life is deemed acceptable since it is justified 
in accordance with ICH Q1A (R2) and ICH Q5C, as well as the additional shelf life of one month at up 
to 25°C within the proposed shelf life.

2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
Control of all materials regarding TSE/BSE have been adequately addressed.  
Materials of biological origin used in the process are: 
-  Cell  banks  (CHO  origin),  tested  routinely  in  production  according  to  adequate  specification, 
confirmatory viral in vivo testing later in production (unprocessed bulk). 
-  Recombinant  Long  R3  IGF  1  Growth  Factor  (component  of  growth  media  used  from  thaw  to  cell 
expansion / production bioreactor, synthesized from recombinant DNA in E coli and is not animal-
derived, tested for confirmation of identity, appearance and BET). 
-  Dialyzed  foetal  bovine  serum  (dFBS),  used  for  cloning  during  cell  line  development,  EDQM  CEP 
provided. EDQM CPE for dFBS certifies compliance with Ph. Eur monograph 1483 “Products with risk 
of transmitting agents of animal spongiform encephalopathies”.  
applicant`s  overall  approach  to  achieve  viral  safety  of  tezepelumab  is  adequate  and  consists  of 
complementary approaches to control potential viral contamination: (1) selecting and testing cell lines 
and raw materials, for the absence of undesirable viruses, (2) testing the product at unprocessed bulk 
step process for absence of contaminating viruses, (3) assessing the capability of manufacturing process 
to clear viruses.  
In conclusion, applicants approach is in general in line with: 
- 
ICH Q5A (R1) Note for guidance on quality of biotechnological products: Viral safety evaluation of 
biotechnology products derived from cell lines of human or animal origin and  
-  EMA  Note  for  guidance  on  virus  validation  studies:  the  design,  contribution  and  interpretation  of 
studies validating the inactivation and removal of viruses, (CPMP/BWP/268/95). 
It can be concluded that manufacturing process is validated to be capable of effective and reproducible 
inactivation and/or removal of viruses. 
2.4.4.  Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects 
Overall, the tezepelumab quality dossier is of high quality and the documentation provided for the 
manufacture, control and stability is sufficiently detailed. All other concerns have been addressed 
satisfactorily by the applicant. 
Active substance 
The active substance manufacturing process is performed under GMP and is sufficiently controlled to 
ensure routine production of material that meets the intended quality and that is representative of 
material used in the clinical development program. The active substance and impurities have been 
adequately characterized. 
The release testing and methods will ensure adequate quality of material. For some AS acceptance 
criteria commitment to re-evaluate them after more batches are manufactured is provided. The 
proposed shelf life for tezepelumab of 48 months when stored at -30°±10°C is considered properly 
justified. 
The material is acceptably safe from an adventitious agents and viral safety perspective. 
Finished product 
Assessment report

The finished product is presented as a sterile, single dose, preservative-free solution for subcutaneous 
injection in a 2.25 mL Type I glass pre-filled syringe. The product is formulated using commonly used 
excipients.  
Sufficient details are provided detailing the pharmaceutical development of the product from early 
formulations in a vial through to the commercial 110 mg/mL tezepelumab product.  
The manufacturing process; limited to AS substance thawing, formulation, sterile filtration and aseptic 
filling, followed by PFS assembly, has at large been acceptably described and validated.  
The information provided for the delivery device, the APFS, is comprehensive, and in general confirms 
the suitability of the chosen device. Design verification was performed and compliance with MDR 
essential requirements has been demonstrated.  
The release testing and methods will ensure adequate quality of finished product. As for active 
substance, finished product specification includes acceptance criteria for release and for shelf life. The 
acceptance criteria are considered justified. However, the commitment is provided for acceptance 
criteria for some parameters to be re-evaluated after more experience is gained (after 30 batches of 
AS or FP are manufactured).  
The proposed shelf life for the finished product is 36 months when stored at 2 – 8 °C and with an 
optional short-term storage for one month up to 25°C in order to facilitate dosing. The proposed FP 
shelf life is considered acceptable. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Since no major objection has been identified and all other concerns, raised during assessment of the 
provided documentation, are satisfactorily addressed by the applicant it can be concluded that 
chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects of marketing authorisation application for Tezspire are 
sufficiently covered and acceptable.  
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
TSLP signals through a heterodimeric receptor consisting of the IL-7Rα chain and a common γ chain-
like receptor (TSLPR). STAT5 activation is associated with activation of the TSLPR complex and the 
phosphorylation of STAT5 is a robust measure of TSLPR signalling. Tezepelumab binds TSLP and blocks 
TSLP-induced phosphorylation of STAT5 in dendritic cells isolated from whole blood. Tezepelumab 
disrupts the signalling of TSLP via its heterodimeric receptor. 
A total of 20 non-clinical studies were conducted to characterise the pharmacology and toxicity profile 
of tezepelumab. Of this total, ten studies were non-clinical pharmacology studies (including in vivo 
models using a murine surrogate anti-TSLP mAb, M702) and one study was a safety pharmacology 
study, which is described together with the non-clinical pharmacology reports. Two studies were 
single-dose non-clinical PK studies and 7 studies were non-clinical toxicology studies, of which 5 also 
included pharmacokinetic (PK) characterisation. All non-clinical safety studies were conducted in 
compliance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), as well as with the International Council for 
Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Guidelines, in 
particular ICH S6 guidance 2011. All pivotal non-clinical safety studies were conducted in an 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member country in accordance with 
OECD GLP guidance.

The tezepelumab non-clinical safety package included 4 GLP cynomolgus monkey repeat-dose 
toxicology studies of up to 6 months in duration, a maternal, embryo-fetal, and neonatal toxicity 
(ePPND) study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, a local tolerance study in rabbits, and a GLP tissue 
cross-reactivity study using normal human and cynomolgus monkey tissue panels. Parameters for 
immunotoxicology, and indirect assessments of male and female fertility were components of the 
repeat-dose toxicology studies and the embryo-fetal, and neonatal toxicity study. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Tezepelumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) immunoglobulin G2λ (IgG2λ) directed against 
the cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). TSLP is an epithelial cell-derived cytokine that is 
produced in response to a variety of proinflammatory stimuli (e.g., allergens, viruses, pathogens, 
airborne particles and trauma). TSLP is believed to be an important driver of asthma pathophysiology, 
primarily through its activity on dendritic cells (DC), T cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) and mast 
cells. 
In vitro studies demonstrated that tezepelumab neutralised recombinant and native human and 
cynomolgus monkey TSLP mediated bioactivities on both primary cells and transfected cell lines stably 
expressing the functional heterodimeric TSLPR.  
Recombinant hTSLP and mouse anti-hTSLPR mAb M505 bound to the cell-surface expressed hTSLPR 
complex on BAF/HTR cells with high (Ki ~ 157 pM and ~360 pM, respectively) affinities. Tezepelumab 
inhibited the same binding with very high (Ki ~ 28.7 pM) affinity. 
Both the high affinity binding KD for tezepelumab and potent inhibition (KI) values support the use of 
tezepelumab to inhibit TSLP binding to TSLPR. Tezepelumab showed high affinity binding to human and 
cynomolgus TSLP with binding affinity (KD) values of 15.8 pM and 32.2 pM, respectively. However, no 
binding of tezepelumab was detected to mouse TSLP. In the BAF:human TSLP receptor proliferation 
assay, tezepelumab inhibited recombinant and native human TSLP induced activity with IC50 values of 
37 pM and 33 pM respectively In the CCL22/MDC assay, the IC50 value for tezepelumab was 95 pM for 
recombinant cynomolgus TSLP in primary cynomolgus PBMC cultures. These experiments 
demonstrated the sub-nanomolar potency of tezepelumab against both recombinant and native human 
and cynomolgus TSLP using both primary cells and cell lines. The comparable binding affinities (less 
than a 10-fold difference in potency) of tezepelumab to human and cynomolgus monkey TSLP support 
the use of the cynomolgus monkey as a pharmacologically relevant toxicology model for non-clinical 
safety assessment. 
Human TSLP shares 90% identity to cynomolgus monkey TSLP, 43% identity to mouse TSLP, 45% 
identity to rat TSLP and 55% identity to rabbit TSLP. Tezepelumab does not bind mouse, rat or rabbit 
TSLP, but does bind human and cynomolgus monkey TSLP. 
Because of the lack of binding of tezepelumab to mouse TSLP, M702, a mouse surrogate antibody was 
developed for in vivo studies. M702 bound to recombinant mouse TSLP with an equilibrium dissociation 
constant (KD) of 41 pM. This high affinity binding along with the potent blocking of TSLP-induced 
cellular activity by M702 provide evidence that M702 is a suitable surrogate antibody for non-clinical in 
vivo studies. 
The effects of anti-TSLP M702 treatment in an OVA model of allergic asthma were tested in BALB/c 
mice using both prophylactic and challenge treatment protocols. The data indicate that blockade of 
TSLP using M702 ameliorates signs of allergic inflammation in the OVA model of asthma. IV 
administration of M702 during sensitization and before OVA challenge phases at 20 mg/kg significantly 
decreased BALF cellularity and airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine challenge compared with

control rat IgG treated mice. Total serum IgE concentrations in M702 treated mice were not 
significantly different from control rat IgG treated mice. 
Using the TSLP-challenge model in BALB/c mice, treatment with either anti-TSLP mAb or anti-IL-4Rα 
mAb prevented the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the BALF and lung tissue and either 
completely (M702), or partially (Mu317RaXMu) inhibited goblet cell hyperplasia. These results point to 
the phenotype induced by TSLP as being mediated through the IL-4Rα pathway which can be partially, 
but not completely, attenuated by blocking IL-4Rα. 
An in vivo study (R20070146) described the use of both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mouse strains, however, 
only results from BALB/c mice were described by the applicant. Only one experiment (out of 5) using 
IV dosed anti-mouse TSLP monoclonal antibody M702 inhibited BALF cellularity in BALB/c mice. As 
there are known phenotypic differences in these two strains with respect to asthma models, the 
applicant was requested to clarify this issue. In their response they suggested that their choice to 
describe more fully the BALB/c mice results from this study, and not the C57Bl/6 mice, was based on 
relevance of the AHR response in nonclinical models to the observed AHR responses observed in the 
inhaled allergen challenge clinical study. There was also an observed lack of effect when M702 was 
administered intravenously during the challenge phase in this study. The applicant further clarified that 
the OVA challenge took place via aerosolization in a nebulizer chamber, and subsequent IN 
administration of M702 resulted in disease related pharmacodynamics effects in BALB/c mice including 
reduced total IgE, OVA-specific IgE, IL-5 and IL-13. In contrast, these PD effects were not observed 
with IV administration of M702. In addition, IV administration of M702 in BALB/c mice resulted in 
reduced airway hyperresponsiveness when dosing took place during the priming and challenge phases, 
but no significant improvement was detected when mice were dosed with M702 during only the 
challenge phase. Therefore, the choice by the applicant to describe more fully the BALB/c mice results 
from study R20070146, and not the C57Bl/6 mice, was based on relevance of the AHR response in 
nonclinical models to the observed AHR responses observed in the inhaled allergen challenge clinical 
study.  
Two models of skin inflammation were also utilised as pathology of the models bears some similarities 
to human type 2 inflammation which may have relevance to airway inflammation in asthma given the 
commonality of the type 2 immune response. In the model of contact hypersensitivity fluorescein 
isothiocyanate (FITC) was used to establish skin inflammation bearing some similarities to human 
atopic dermatitis. The effect of blocking TSLP with M702 was most pronounced for the sensitization 
phase suggesting that TSLP blockade impacts the initiation of the FITC immune response. To further 
understand the biologic pathways of TSLP, a second skin inflammation study explored the induction of 
type 2 inflammation in two knockout (KO) models: IL-4Rα KO mice and STAT6 KO mice. The results of 
this study indicate that responses to TSLP are partially dependent upon IL-4 and IL-13 and that TSLP-
induced IL-5 production is sufficient to reproduce some skin inflammation. In the case of STAT6 KO 
mice, TSLP resulted in fibrosis which was not evident in IL-4Rα KO mice which suggests signalling 
through pathways other than STAT6. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies were carried out with tezepelumab. This is acceptable as 
monoclonal antibodies are expected to have a selective target and mechanism of action. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Effects of tezepelumab on cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurobehavioral endpoints were evaluated 
in a single dose GLP safety pharmacology study in 4 male telemetered cynomolgus monkeys. There 
were no treatment-related effects on cardiovascular function, respiratory rate, neurological behaviour 
and body temperature after tezepelumab administration as a single IV dose of 300 mg/kg.

Page 27/215 
 
 
 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non-clinical in vivo pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies of tezepelumab were conducted.  
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The methods of analysis for measurement of tezepelumab in cynomolgous monkey serum and milk in 
the GLP compliant repeat-dose and ePPND studies are validated ELISAs (MET-001651 and Method 
ICD351.1 v1.02). The validations of these methods included: determination of assay range, inter-assay 
and intra-assay precision and accuracy, selectivity, specificity, bench top stability, long-term stability, 
freeze-thaw stability, hook (prozone) effect, and incurred sample re-analysis (ISR).  
Single dose PK are reported from non-GLP PK studies in male cynomolgous monkeys following iv and 
sc administration of tezepelumab (Studies 108662, 109742). Tezepelumab exhibited linear kinetics 
over the 0.1 to 50 mg/kg dose range. The mean terminal half-life (t1/2) ranged approximately from 10 
to 14 days. Following SC administration, the median time to achieve maximum observed serum 
concentration (tmax) was 3 to 4 days. The bioavailability for SC administration at the dose of 5 mg/kg 
was approximately 73%.  
Repeat-dose toxicokinetics are reported from the GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicology studies 
conducted in cynomolgus monkeys following 1-month and 3-month repeated sc administration of 
tezepelumab (Studies 108823, 108448), 1-month repeat iv dosing (Study 111874), a 6-month repeat-
dose iv and sc study (Study 108824). In these repeat-dose studies, serum exposure (Cmax and AUC) 
increased approximately dose proportionally over the dose range of 50 to 300 mg/kg administered 
once weekly sc and was comparable (<2 fold different) between males and females with limited 
accumulation after 6 months (a mean accumulation after 6 months of 2.44- and 1.74- fold at 50 and 
300 mg/kg sc, respectively). With the exception of one animal with anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and 
circulating immune complex (CIC) formation that was euthanized in the 6-month study, all 
tezepelumab-treated animals had measurable biologically active tezepelumab serum concentrations 
throughout the dosing phases. The formation of ADA did not affect exposure to tezepelumab during the 
dosing phase. The NOAEL for sc administration was 300 mg/kg/dose, which corresponded to a Cmax 
and AUC0-168 of 5,260 μg and 30,200 μg•day/mL, respectively, at the end of the study. 
Maternal toxicokinetics, foetal transfer and excretion in milk were reported following repeat-dose iv 
administration to pregnant cynomolgous monkeys (ePPND Study 108825). A high level of distribution 
to the foetus was reported, with infant serum concentrations generally greater than maternal serum 
concentrations of tezepelumab. With a molecular weight of 147 kDa, the volume of distribution of 
tezepelumab should mainly be confined to the vascular space, which is typical of immunoglobulin (IgG) 
based therapeutics. The volume of distribution (Vss) estimated in the PK study (108662) in 
cynomolgus monkey was approximately 50 mL/kg which is similar to the plasma volume and 
demonstrated limited extravascular distribution. 
In the embryo-fetal toxicity study, tezepelumab administered to cynomolgus monkeys during the 
period of organogenesis was shown to distribute from the circulation in the dam to fetus. Section 4.6 of 
the SmPC includes wording to indicate that “Human IgG antibodies, such as tezepelumab, are 
transported across the placenta barrier; therefore, Tradename may be transmitted from the mother to 
the developing foetus”. Tezepelumab concentration in milk was <1% of the serum concentration after 
once weekly IV administration to pregnant adult females during gestation period at 50 and 300 mg/kg. 
Similar clearance patterns were observed both in the maternal animal and in the infant during the 
treatment free phase. In conjunction with the findings of very low milk concentrations postpartum, 
these data suggest that the majority of the test article transfer to the infant occurred in utero, but the 
possibility of test article transfer from the maternal animal to the infant via milk cannot be excluded. 
Non-clinical distribution, metabolism, excretion and PK drug interaction studies have not been 
conducted in support of tezepelumab. This is acceptable in line with ICH S6 (R1) guidance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022

2.5.4.  Toxicology 
Toxicology studies were conducted to characterise the non-clinical safety profile of tezepelumab. All 
pivotal non-clinical safety studies were conducted in Organisation of Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) member countries, in accordance with OECD Test Guidelines and Principles of 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), and according to relevant International Conference on Harmonisation 
guidelines (ICH S6 (R1), ICH M3 (R2), and ICH S5 (R2)). 
Cynomolgus monkey was selected as the pharmacologically relevant animal model for non-clinical 
safety assessment based on tezepelumab binding to human and cynomolgus monkey TSLP with 
picomolar affinity (KD vales of 15.8 pM and 32.2 pM, respectively), and neutralizing human and 
cynomolgus monkey TSLP with sub-nanomolar potency. 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
One single-dose study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys to assess safety pharmacology 
endpoints. There were no signs of tezepelumab acute toxicity after a single IV dose of 300 mg/kg. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Tezepelumab was administered to cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 300 mg/kg SC Q7D for 1, 3, 
and 6 months; up to 300 mg/kg IV Q7D for 1 month; and at 50 mg/kg IV Q7D for 6 months. The 
NOAEL was the highest dose tested for each route of administration in each repeat-dose study. Serum 
cholesterol was minimally to mildly decreased at the 300 mg/kg dose level in most repeat-dose 
studies. The reversibility of the effect on serum cholesterol was confirmed during the recovery phases. 
In the 3-month study, the T-cell dependent antibody response (TDAR) was evaluated by measuring the 
antibody response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Mean anti-KLH IgG titers were mildly to 
moderately decreased at 300 mg/kg. At 50 and 100 mg/kg IgG titers were sporadically reduced but 
were not statistically significant. Reduced anti-KLH IgG antibody titers may be related to the 
pharmacology of tezepelumab, even though not considered adverse since no changes related to 
infection were observed in the study. Similar changes in KLH titers were not evident in offspring in a 
subsequent cynomolgus ePPND study. 
A cell-based bioassay was used to measure biologically active tezepelumab. With the exception of the 
one animal with ADA and CIC that was euthanized in the 6-month study, all tezepelumab-treated 
animals had measurable biologically active tezepelumab serum concentrations throughout the dosing 
phases. ADA development is to be expected as tezepelumab is a human protein. The formation of ADA 
did not affect exposure to tezepelumab during the dosing phase, and because all surviving animals 
maintained levels of bioactive drug, there was no effect on the toxicologic evaluation of tezepelumab. 
Repeat-dose toxicokinetics were reported from the GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicology studies 
conducted in cynomolgus monkeys following 1-month and 3-month repeated sc administration of 
tezepelumab (Studies 108823, 108448), 1-month repeat iv dosing (Study 111874), a 6-month repeat-
dose iv and sc study (Study 108824) and maternal toxicokinetics, foetal transfer and excretion in milk 
were reported following repeat-dose iv administration to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys (ePPND Study 
108825). 
In the 6-month toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys, exposure increased approximately dose 
proportionally over the dose range of 50 to 300 mg/kg administered once weekly by SC and was 
comparable (<2 fold different) between males and females with a mean accumulation after 6 months 
of 2.44- and 1.74- fold at 50 and 300 mg/kg, respectively. Tezepelumab gradually cleared during the 
5-month treatment-free phase, however measurable concentrations were detected on the last day in 
all animals given SC at 300 mg/kg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 29/215 
 
 
 
In the ePPND study exposure to tezepelumab increased approximately dose proportionally from 50 to 
300 mg/kg. Mean accumulation ratios from the first dose and the last (18th) dose to pregnant animals 
were 2.23 at 50 mg/kg and 1.51 at 300 mg/kg, respectively. 
These nonclinical safety data provide adequate margins of exposure between the observed 6-month 
repeat-dose study SC NOAEL (300 mg/kg) and the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 
210 mg SC every 4 weeks (approximately 134 times the MRHD on an AUC at steady state basis, and 
128 times the MRHD on a Cmax at steady state basis). 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
In line with the guideline on the pre-clinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals 
(ICH S6 R1), no genotoxicity studies were carried out. This is acceptable. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
In the repeat IV or SC dose nonclinical studies of up to 6-months dose duration, tezepelumab showed 
no evidence of proliferative or pre-neoplastic effects in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Therefore, given the limitations of the available rodent models and the weight of evidence indicating a 
lack of product-specific concern for the carcinogenicity potential for tezepelumab, it was determined 
that additional nonclinical studies would not offer new significant clinically relevant data to inform the 
risk 
As part of a weight of evidence approach, available type TSLP carcinogenicity literature was reviewed. 
Over the past several years, it has been demonstrated that the major role of TSLP in mice and humans 
is to induce a type 2 (T2) cellular adaptive response. 
A genetic link between TSLP overexpression and cancer has recently been found, as evidenced by 
increased prevalence of gain of function mutations in patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(B-ALL), thereby suggesting that in both animal models and humans, inhibition of TSLP such as with 
tezepelumab may provide anti-tumour activity rather than increased cancer risk. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No development toxicity studies with tezepelumab were conducted to evaluate early embryonic 
development to implantation as it is not practical to do mating studies in cynomolgus monkeys. Male 
and female fertility was indirectly assessed as components of the 6- month repeat-dose study and 
there were no tezepelumab-related adverse effects.  
In the maternal, embryo-fetal, and neonatal toxicity (ePPND) study, pregnant female cynomolgus 
monkeys were dosed Q7D at 50 or 300 mg/kg IV from early gestation through delivery. There were no 
tezepelumab-related effects (maternal, fetal, or infant). For all infants evaluated during the 6.5-month 
postnatal period, there were no tezepelumab-related changes in clinical signs, body weight, infant 
measurements, neurobehavioral assessment, hematologic parameters, peripheral blood lymphocyte 
immunophenotypes, anti-KLH humoral immune responses, external, visceral, or skeletal evaluations.  
The maternal, embryo-fetal, and neonatal toxicity study NOAEL was 300 mg/kg Q7D. The margins of 
exposure [calculated using GD 139-142 exposure prior to parturition] are approximately 168 times the 
MRHD on an AUC at steady state basis, and 259 times the MRHD on a Cmax at steady state basis. 
Although no effects on reproductive organs were observed in the repeated dose toxicity studies, 
fertility studies could not be conducted in monkeys. Although no developmental defects were observed 
in mice deficient for TSLP receptor (TSLPR-/-) in published literature, nonetheless, published in vitro 
data suggested that TSLP may play an important role in human early pregnancy including human 
extravillous trophoblast invasion and placentation. The applicant clarified that studies were not carried 
out using the homologous mouse antibody M702 due to strain-dependence of the results described in 
Assessment report

the published literature, which add uncertainty for their translation to humans and would suggest the 
outcome of a potential fertility and embryonic development study conducted in mice using the M702 
surrogate antibody instead of tezepelumab could be attributable to the strain of mouse selected in 
equal measure to the action of the test item and as such would not add clarity for risk assessment and 
associated labelling for human use. The lack of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies is 
acceptable. 
No studies have been conducted with tezepelumab in juvenile animals, however no age-related 
differences in the tezepelumab toxicology profile have been observed in nonclinical safety studies 
completed to date. 
2.5.4.6.  Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance assessed by macroscopic and microscopic evaluations of tezepelumab infusion/injection 
sites in the single and repeated-dose cynomolgus toxicity studies and in a rabbit local tolerance study 
found no tezepelumab-related adverse changes. In the 3-month and 6-month repeat-dose studies, test 
article-related, non-adverse, and reversible, increased incidence of perivascular infiltrates occurred in 
subcutaneous injection sites. 
The rabbit local tolerance study utilised a tezepelumab concentration lower than that used clinically 
and a different route of administration. The applicant clarified that the rabbit local tolerance study was 
conducted as a preliminary in vivo intravenous safety assessment prior to the initial cynomolgus 
monkey IV repeat dose study using the same formulation and concentration in the 300 mg/kg dose 
group.  
2.5.4.7.  Other toxicity studies 
Tissue cross-reactivity 
The cross-reactivity of biotinylated tezepelumab (AMG 157-Bio) was evaluated in a GLP tissue cross-
reactivity study at concentrations of 1 μg/mL and 50 μg/mL using cryosections of normal human and 
cynomolgus monkey tissues. AMG 157-Bio-specific staining was not detected in the human or 
cynomolgus monkey tissue panels examined. This finding may be explained because TSLP is not 
expressed in these tissues as it is during inflammation or other physiological processes. The positive 
and negative control results verify that the assay system was functioning properly. 
Immunotoxicity 
In the nonclinical studies, immune assessments in animals administered tezepelumab up to 6-months 
dosing duration showed no test article related adverse effects on the immune system. Some 
statistically significant changes in T-cell dependent antigen response [anti-KLH antibodies] were 
observed in the 3-month study, but similar findings were not evident in offspring in the subsequent 
ePPND study. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Tezepelumab is a human monoclonal antibody, and as such is a protein, and is considered a natural 
substance. It is expected to be extensively metabolized to amino acid residues which will be recycled 
or further degraded, and therefore the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of 
the substance in the environment. Therefore, tezepelumab is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Tezepelumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) immunoglobulin G2λ (IgG2λ) directed against 
the cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Tezepelumab binds with high affinity to TSLP. The 
comparable binding affinities of tezepelumab to human TSLP and cynomolgus monkey TSLP support 
the use of the cynomolgus monkey as a pharmacologically relevant toxicology model for 
pharmacokinetic and safety toxicology studies. Tezepelumab did not bind mouse, rat or rabbit TSLP. 
Tezepelumab was shown to functionally inhibit TSLP-induced activity in several bioassays in both 
human peripheral blood myeloid [CD11c+] dendritic cells, primary cynomolgus monkey peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells [PMBCs], and mouse BAF/BO3 stable cell lines transfected with heterodimeric 
TSLP receptor. In vivo mouse models of lung and skin inflammation were explored using the anti-
mouse TSLP surrogate antibody M702 which was demonstrated to have high affinity binding and 
acceptable pharmacologic properties. In an OVA challenge study, the data indicate that blockade of 
TSLP using M702 ameliorates signs of allergic inflammation in the OVA model of asthma.  
There were no treatment-related effects on cardiovascular function, respiratory rate, neurological 
behaviour and body temperature after tezepelumab administration as a single IV dose of 300 mg/kg to 
cynomolgus monkeys (SmPC 5.3). 
In conclusion, the pharmacology studies characterized the binding affinity, specificity, potency and 
pharmacodynamic effects of tezepelumab on cells expressing the heterodimeric TSLP receptor (IL-7Rα 
and TSLPR chains). In vivo studies have shown that blocking TSLP inhibits multiple pathways 
associated with inflammation, most notably pathways associated with type 2 inflammation. 
Overall, the pharmacology supports the observation that TSLP induces a cytokine milieu that may 
mediate a broad array of responses including cell activation, proliferation, trafficking and 
immunoglobulin class switching. The mode of action of tezepelumab is that of binding with human 
TSLP, preventing its interaction with the heterodimeric TSLP receptor, and inhibiting TSLP-induced 
activity in human cells. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Singe-dose pharmacokinetics are reported from non-GLP studies, while repeat-dose toxicokinetics are 
reported from the GLP-compliant toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, which is acceptable.  
Single-dose PK data indicate tezepelumab exhibited linear kinetics over the dose range tested (0.1- 
50mg/kg iv), with a mean terminal half-life of between 10 and 14 days. Following sc administration, 
Tmax was achieved at 3-4 days and sc bioavailability was 73% at 5mg/kg.  
Repeat-dose toxicokinetics indicate serum exposure (Cmax and AUC) increased dose-proportionally 
following repeated sc dosing of 50 – 300 mg/kg weekly for up to 6 months, with limited accumulation 
(a mean accumulation after 6 months of 2.44- and 1.74- fold at 50 and 300 mg/kg sc, respectively). 
The NOAEL for sc administration was 300 mg/kg/dose, which corresponded to a Cmax and AUC0-168 
of 5,260 μg and 30,200 μg•day/mL, respectively, at the end of the study.  
Maternal toxicokinetics, foetal transfer and excretion in milk were reported following repeat-dose iv 
administration to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, with a high level of distribution to the foetus 
reported. While tezepelumab concentration in milk was less than 1% of the maternal serum 
concentration (SmPC 5.3), infant serum concentrations were generally greater than maternal serum 
concentrations of tezepelumab, suggesting that the majority of the test article transfer to the infant 
occurred in utero, although the possibility of test article transfer from the maternal animal to the infant 
via milk cannot be excluded. 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 32/215 
 
 
 
SmPC section 4.6 includes wording to indicate that “Human IgG antibodies, such as tezepelumab, are 
transported across the placenta barrier; therefore, Tradename may be transmitted from the mother to 
the developing foetus”. 
Dedicated distribution, metabolism, excretion and PK drug interaction studies have not been conducted 
in support of tezepelumab. This is acceptable in line with ICH S6 (R1) guidance. 
Toxicology 
As tezepelumab only binds human and cynomolgus monkey TSLP, cynomolgus monkey represents the 
only suitable species to investigate the toxicology of tezepelumab. Tezepelumab was evaluated in 
repeat-dose studies in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 300 mg/kg administered SC Q7D for 1, 3, 
and 6 months; at up to 300 mg/kg IV Q7D for 1 month; and at 50 mg/kg IV Q7D for 6 months and 
there were no adverse findings noted. The NOAEL was the highest dose tested for each route of 
administration in each study.  
In line with ICH S6(R1), no genotoxicity studies were carried out. This is acceptable. 
In the repeat IV or SC dose non-clinical studies of up to 6-months dose duration, tezepelumab showed 
no evidence of proliferative or pre-neoplastic effects in cynomolgus monkeys. Therefore, given the 
limitations of the available rodent models and the weight of evidence indicating a lack of product-
specific concern for the carcinogenicity potential for tezepelumab, it was determined that additional 
non-clinical studies would not offer new significant clinically relevant data to inform the risk. As part of 
a weight of evidence approach, available type TSLP carcinogenicity literature was reviewed. Over the 
past several years, it has been demonstrated that the major role of TSLP in mice and humans is to 
induce a type 2 (T2) cellular adaptive response.  
Local tolerance was evaluated in the repeat dose toxicity studies. No tezepelumab-related adverse 
changes were found. In addition, the applicant presented an IV study in rabbits. Administration of 
tezepelumab was well tolerated.  
Male and female fertility was indirectly assessed as components of the 6- month repeat-dose study and 
there were no tezepelumab-related adverse effects. In the maternal, embryo-fetal, and neonatal 
toxicity (ePPND) study, pregnant female cynomolgus monkeys were dosed Q7D at 50 or 300 mg/kg IV 
from early gestation through delivery. There were no adverse effects of tezepelumab on maternal 
health, pregnancy outcome, embryo-foetal development, or neonatal development up to 6.5 months of 
age.  
Published in vitro data suggested that TSLP may play an important role in human early pregnancy 
including human extravillous trophoblast invasion and placentation and a homologous mouse antibody 
is available (M702). However, the applicant clarified that studies were not carried out using M702 due 
to strain-dependence of the results described in the published literature. The lack of studies is 
acceptable. 
These non-clinical safety data provide adequate margins of exposure between the observed 6-month 
repeat-dose study SC NOAEL (300 mg/kg) and the proposed human dose of 210 mg SC every 4 weeks 
(approximately 134 times the MRHD on an AUC at steady state basis, and 128 times the MRHD on a 
Cmax at steady state basis). For the IV maternal, embryo-fetal, and neonatal toxicity study, the 
margins [calculated using GD 139-142 exposure prior to parturition] are approximately 168 times the 
MRHD on an AUC at steady state basis, and 259 times the MRHD on a Cmax at steady state basis. 
As a precautionary measure, the SmPC section 5.3 recommends avoiding the use of tezepelumab 
during pregnancy unless the expected benefit to the pregnant mother is greater than any possible risk 
to the foetus.  
In the non-clinical studies, immune assessments in animals administered tezepelumab up to 6-months 
dosing duration showed no test article related adverse effects on the immune system. As previously 
Assessment report

noted, some statistically significant changes in T-cell dependent antigen response [anti-KLH 
antibodies] were observed in the 3-month study, but similar findings were not evident in offspring in 
the subsequent ePPND study. 
ERA 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, tezepelumab is not expected to pose a risk 
to the environment. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The application for tezepelumab in the treatment of severe asthma is considered approvable from the 
non-clinical point of view. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Tezepelumab is a human immunoglobulin G2λ (IgG2λ) monoclonal antibody (mAb), which is proposed 
as  an  add-on  maintenance  treatment  in  patients  with  severe  asthma  aged  12  years  and  older.  The 
proposed dose for adults and adolescents is 210 mg by SC injection every 4 weeks (Q4W). 
The clinical pharmacology tezepelumab programme assessed the PK and PD parameters of tezepelumab 
in  11  completed  studies  (6  Phase  1  studies,  one  Phase  2  study,  one  Phase  2b  study,  and  3  Phase  3 
studies). 
Bioanalytical methods 
Serum Tezepelumab concentration 
Serum samples for the assessment of tezepelumab concentrations were analysed using a validated ELISA 
assay.  Samples  were  analysed  by  the  applicant  and  the  method  was  subsequently  transferred  and 
validated at PPD. 
The  method  utilised  an  ELISA  assay  format  to  measure  the  concentration  of  tezepelumab  in  human 
serum.Bioanalytical methods are considered to have been validated in accordance with the EMA Guideline 
on  bioanalytical  method  validation  (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009  Rev.  1)  taking  also  into  account 
applicant`s justifications which are based on the time when methods were developed and validated.  
The applicant’s method has been used for tezepelumab determination in samples from Study 0620 and 
Study 0390. 
Method was used for tezepelumab determinations in following studies: Study 1183, Study 0002, Japan 
study 0003, PATH-BRIDGE study D5180C00012, PATHWAY study CD-RI-MEDI9929-1146, NAVIGATOR 
study  D5180C00007,  SOURCE  study  D5180C00009,  CASCADE  study  D5180C00013  and  PATH-HOME 
study D5180C00011. 
Immunogenicity 
•  ADA assay and nAb assay 
The  initial  anti-drug  antibody  (ADA)  method  validation  was  conducted  by  the  applicant  as  well  as 
bioanalyses for the clinical studies from Phase I and Phase II  (Study 0620, Study 0390, Study 1183, 
Study 0002, Japan Study 0003, and PATHWAY). The method was then transferred and fully validated at 
PPD  laboratories.  With  method  bioanalyses  are  performed  for  the  Phase  I,  II  and  III  clinical  studies 
(PATH-BRIDGE, CASCADE, NAVIGATOR, SOURCE and PATH-HOME).  
For  detection  of  anti-tezepelumab  antibodies  in  human  serum  screening  and  confirmatory  method 
utilised electro-chemiluminescent (ECL) immunoassay using the Meso-Scale Discovery (MSD).  
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 35/215 
 
 
 
 
For the PPD analyses, standard tiered approach was used employing screening, confirmatory and titer 
assay. 
For the applicant’s method also a tiered approach was applied to screen, confirm and then test in a non-
cell  based  assay  (receptor  binding  assay)  for  neutralising  activity  of  antibodies  against  tezepelumab. 
Samples from Phase I and Phase II clinical studies (0620, 0390, 1183, 0002, 0003, 1146 - PATHWAY) 
that  were  confirmed  positive  for  ADA,  were  analysed  by  Amgen  using  that  validated  method.  Due  to 
insufficient sensitivity and drug tolerance of the applicant’s assay, PPD developed and validated method 
which was used for samples from Phase 3 clinical studies (00007 - NAVIGATOR and 00009 - SOURCE) 
that were confirmed positive for ADA. The method utilised electro-chemiluminescent (ECL) immunoassay 
using the Meso-Scale Discovery (MSD). 
Tezepelumab population PK analysis 
The  popPK  analysis  dataset  included  data  from  8  clinical  studies:  Phase  3  NAVIGATOR,  Phase  2b 
PATHWAY, and 6 supportive Phase 1 studies (Studies 0620 [Part A], 0390, 1183, 0002, 0003, and PATH-
BRIDGE) in subjects with asthma or healthy volunteers. Two formulations of tezepelumab were used in 
the above studies, referred to as the Clinical Process 1 and Clinical Process 2 formulation (to-be-marketed 
Commercial formulation). 
The  original  dataset  included  12608  measurable  serum  samples,  of  which  33  below  limits  of 
quantification  (BLQ)  samples  (0.261%)  and  67  outliers  (0.531%)  were  excluded.  The  final  analysis 
dataset included 12541 tezepelumab serum concentration measurements from 1368 subjects. 
In exploratory data analysis, tezepelumab exhibited linear PK over the tested dose range of 2.1 to 420 
mg SC and 210 to 700 mg IV. No substantial differences were observed between different studies for 
the same regimen and route of administration. 
Base model 
A 2-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination best characterised tezepelumab PK 
following IV or SC administration. Body weight effects on CL, Vc, Q, and Vp were included in the base 
model. 
Covariates 
Based  on  a  stepwise  forward  selection  then  backward  elimination  method,  the  following  significant 
covariates were included in the final model: body weight on CL, Vc, Q, and Vp, ICS dose level on CL and 
Vc, Asian race on CL, formulation on CL, as well as age on Vc. 
Final model 
Parameter estimates for the final popPK model for tezepelumab are presented in Table 5. The standard 
goodness-of-fit plots of the final popPK model are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

Table 3. Summary of final population PK parameters  
A  good  agreement  between  the  individual  or  population  predicted  concentrations  and  the  observed

A number of pcVPC plots of tezepelumab serum concentration-time profiles for different regimens, route 
of administration and studies were presented. These showed that the observed median and spread (2.5th

of  the  corresponding  model  predictions  in  all  scenarios.  The  pcVPC  plots  for  SC  tezepelumab 
concentration-time profiles following single dose, Q2W and Q4W administrations are presented in Figure

Absorption  
Following a single SC administration of doses between 2.1 and 420 mg of tezepelumab to healthy 
subjects (Study 20070620), peak serum concentration was reached in ~3 to 10 days. Based on the 
population PK analysis, the absorption rate constant (ka) after SC administration was 0.316 day-1. 
•  Bioavailability 
The absolute bioavailability of a single subcutaneously administered tezepelumab at a dose of 210 mg 
was  assessed  in  healthy  subjects  in  phase  1  Study  20070620  and  reported  as  81  %relative  to  IV 
administration  of  the  same  dose.  Based  on  the  population  PK  analysis,  bioavailability  (F)  after  SC 
administration was estimated at 76.8%. There was no clinically relevant difference in bioavailability when 
administered to different injection sites (abdomen, thigh, or upper arm). 
•  Bioequivalence 
Study  D5180C00012  (PATH-BRIDGE)  was  a  phase  1  open-label,  randomised,  parallel-group  study  in 
healthy adult subjects to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of tezepelumab administered via an accessorised 
pre-filled  syringe  (APFS)  or  autoinjector  (AI)  compared  with  vial-and-syringe  used  in  the  clinical 
development program. 
The %geometric LS mean ratios of serum tezepelumab (AI/V-S) and associated 90% CI of Cmax, AUC0-
t and AUC0-∞ were 1.04 [0.97, 1.11]; 1.03 [0.96, 1.11] and 1.03 [0.96, 1.10]. Bioequivalence in terms 
of AUCt and AUC∞ between the two formulations was demonstrated. The %geometric LS mean ratios 
of  serum  tezepelumab  (APFS/V-S)  and  associated  90%  CI  of  Cmax,  AUC0-t  and  AUC0-∞  were  1.06 
[0.99,  1.13];  1.07  [0.99,  1.14]  and  1.07  [0.99,  1.15].  Bioequivalence  in  terms  of  AUCt  and  AUC∞ 
between the two formulations was demonstrated. The %geometric LS mean ratios of serum tezepelumab 
(AI/APFS) and associated 90% CI of Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were 1.02 [0.95, 1.09]; 1.04 [0.97, 
1.11] and 1.04 [0.96, 1.11]. Bioequivalence in terms of AUCt and AUC∞ between the two formulations 
was demonstrated. 
Distribution 
In the population PK analysis, the central and peripheral volumes of distribution (Vc and Vp) were 3.91 
L and 2.17 L, respectively, for a 70 kg individual.  
Elimination 
As  a  typical  mAb,  tezepelumab  is  eliminated  by  intracellular  catabolism  and  there  is  no  evidence  of 
target-mediated CL at the dose range tested clinically. Based on the population PK analysis, tezepelumab 
clearance was 0.172 L/day for a 70 kg individual. The estimated t1/2 was 25.5 days.  
Tezepelumab is not expected to undergo significant renal elimination or to be metabolised by hepatic 
enzymes. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In  healthy  male  volunteer  studies  (SAD  study  20070620  and  MAD  study  20080390),  tezepelumab 
exhibited almost dose proportional increases in exposure over the range of 2.1 mg to 420 mg SC. 
Exploratory data analysis for the popPK analysis revealed that tezepelumab exhibited linear PK over the 
tested dose range of 2.1 to 420 mg SC and 210 to 700 mg IV. 
Using  the  final  popPK  model,  the  tezepelumab  concentration-time  profiles  were  simulated  using  the 
empirical  Bayes  estimates  (EBEs)  of  individual  PK  parameters  of  the  NAVIGATOR  study  population 
following 210 mg SC Q4W dosing for 52 weeks. The mean accumulation ratio based on the ratio between 
Cmin,ss and Cmin,dose1 was 1.86. 
In PATHWAY and NAVIGATOR studies, the serum trough concentrations initially increased over time, and 
approached  steady  state  by  Week  12  (after  3  doses).  There  were  no  substantial  changes  in  trough 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 42/215 
 
 
 
 
concentrations after Week 12 until Week 52 (end of treatment), suggesting that the PK of tezepelumab 
was not time dependent. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Based  on  the  final  population  PK  model,  proportional  residual  error  was  13.9%  (range  13.3-14.5%). 
Inter-individual variability (CV%) for CL and Vc was 29.9% (range 28.2-31.7%) and 35.8% (range 32.2-
40.0%), respectively. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Phase 2b Study CD-RI-MEDI9929 1146 (PATHWAY) 
In  the  PATHWAY  study,  subjects  were  randomised  1:1:1:1  to  receive  one  of  3  dose  levels  of  SC 
tezepelumab  (70  mg  Q4W,  210  mg  Q4W,  or  280  mg  Q2W)  or  placebo  Q2W,  for  52-weeks. 
Pharmacokinetic sampling was conducted on Day 1 and Weeks 4, 12, 20, 28, 40, 52, and 64 (all pre-
dose  samples,  except  for  Weeks  52  and  64).  Pharmacokinetic  data  were  evaluable  in  a  total  of  393 
subjects who received tezepelumab (133, 128, and 132 subjects in the 70 mg Q4W, 210 mg Q4W, and 
280 mg Q2W groups, respectively). 
After repeated SC administration of tezepelumab 70 mg Q4W, 210 mg Q4W, and 280 mg Q2W, the mean 
serum trough concentration increased over time and achieved steady state by Week 12. Tezepelumab 
exhibited linear PK across the 3 doses. The mean accumulation ratios were 1.65 to 1.82, based on ratio 
between the trough concentrations at Week 52 and Week 4. 
Pivotal phase 3 study D5180C00007 (NAVIGATOR) 
In the NAVIGATOR study, subjects were randomised to tezepelumab 210 mg SC Q4W or placebo for up 
to 52 weeks. Pharmacokinetic sampling was conducted on Day 1 and Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, 52, and 64 
(all pre-dose samples, except for Weeks 52 and 64). The PK analysis set contained a total of 526 subjects 
who  were  treated  with  tezepelumab  and  had  at  least  one  PK  sample  post  first  dose  with  quantifiable 
serum concentrations of tezepelumab.  
After administration of tezepelumab 210 mg SC Q4W, the mean serum trough concentration increased 
over time, approaching steady state by Week 12. At Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 52 (end of treatment), 
mean serum trough concentrations were 11.5, 20.7, 22.5, 21.9, and 22.6 μg/mL, respectively.  
The mean serum trough concentrations were higher in adolescent subjects (age 12 to < 18 years) than 
in adults and similar between adults of age 18 to < 65 years and those ≥ 65 years of age. At Week 52, 
the mean serum trough concentrations were 27.9, 21.8, and 23.8 μg/mL in adolescents, adults 18 to < 
65 years and ≥ 65 years of age, respectively. 
Simulated tezepelumab exposures for NAVIGATOR and PATHWAY studies 
Using  the  final  popPK  model,  the  tezepelumab  concentration-time  profiles  were  simulated  using  the 
empirical Bayes estimates of individual PK parameters of the NAVIGATOR study population following 210 
mg SC Q4W dosing for 52 weeks. The simulated mean steady state exposure values of the NAVIGATOR 
population following 210 mg SC Q4W dosing were 901 µg*day/mL, 32.2 µg/mL, 40.9 µg/mL, and 22.5 
µg/mL for AUCss, Cavg,ss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss, respectively. 
The simulated mean steady state exposures in PATHWAY at 210 mg SC Q4W were 8.16 to 10.8% lower 
than those in NAVIGATOR. The simulated mean steady state exposures at 280 mg SC Q2W and 70 mg 
SC  Q4W  in  PATHWAY  were  149%,  149%,  115%,  and  205%  higher  and  70.1%,  70.1%,  69.7%,  and 
70.7% lower for AUCss, Cavg,ss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss respectively, compared to those in NAVIGATOR 
at 210 mg Q4W.

Study D5180C00011 (PATH-HOME) 
Study D5180C00011 a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, open-label, parallel-group study designed to 
assess the successful administration, performance, and functionality of a single-use accessorised pre-
filled  syringe  (APFS)  and  an  (autoinjector)  AI  device  with  a  fixed  210  mg  dose  Q4W  of  tezepelumab 
administered SC in clinic and in at home setting. Serum samples for PK analysis were taken at baseline, 
prior to dosing at week 4, at week 20, and at end of study (EOT). The PK analysis set contained a total 
of  216  subjects  (111  from  the  APFS  group  and  105  from  the  AI  group)  who  were  treated  with 
tezepelumab  and  had  at  least  one  post-treatment  sample  with  quantifiable  serum  concentrations  of 
tezepelumab.  At  Week  4,  Week  20,  Week  24  (EOT),  and  Week  36  (follow-up)  the  mean  serum 
concentrations of tezepelumab were 12.0 μg/mL, 21.9 μg/mL, 22.2 μg/mL, and 2.65 μg/mL respectively, 
in the APFS group, and 11.8 μg/mL, 23.0 μg/mL, 22.3 μg/mL, and 2.92 μg/mL respectively, in the AI 
group. 
Study D5180C00013 (CASCADE) 
Study D5180C00013 was a Phase 2, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel 
group study to evaluate the effect of tezepelumab on airway inflammation in subjects with inadequately 
controlled  moderate-to-severe  asthma.  One  dose  level  of  210  mg  tezepelumab  was  compared  with 
placebo  administered  SC  Q4W  over  the  treatment  period.  116  subjects  were  randomised,  in  the 
tezepelumab group, 56 subjects (94.9%), and in the placebo group, 56 subjects (98.2%), completed 
treatment. Blood samples for PK and ADA assessment were taken at baseline and prior to tezepelumab 
administration on week 12 and at EOT. Arithmetic mean trough serum concentrations were 22.48 and 
24.53 µg/ml, while geometric mean trough serum concentrations were 21.32 and 23.08 µg/ml at week 
12 and EOT respectively.

ADA effect on PK 
The mean serum tezepelumab concentrations of the subjects with treatment emergent (TE) (n = 10) or 
non-TE (n = 16) ADA detected against tezepelumab were similar to those in ADA negative subjects. The 
individual  serum  concentrations  time  profile  of  tezepelumab  in  subjects  with  TE-ADA  or  non-TE-ADA, 
including  the  subject  who  developed  nAb  following  tezepelumab  treatment,  were  within  the  range  of 
those in subjects negative for ADA (Figure 7).

ADA effect on PD 
In subjects with TE-ADA or non-TE-ADA who were treated with tezepelumab, the mean changes from 
baseline  in  FeNO,  peripheral  blood  eosinophils,  and  serum  total  IgE  levels  were  generally  similar 
compared  with  those  in  ADA  negative  subjects  treated  with  tezepelumab,  although  the  numbers  of 
subjects  in  the  ADA  positive  categories  were  very  small  compared  with  the  number  of  ADA  negative 
subjects. The individual time profiles of change from baseline in FeNO, peripheral blood eosinophils, and 
total  serum  IgE  in  these  subjects,  including  the  subject  with  nAb,  were  within  the  range  of  those  in 
subjects negative for ADA who were treated with tezepelumab (Figure 8).

Study D5180C00009 (SOURCE) 
In the SOURCE study, the incidence of ADAs was low; 1/73 (1.4%) subjects on tezepelumab and 0/76 
(0%) subjects on placebo tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. No subjects in either treatment 
group  tested  positive  for  nAbs.  Anti-drug  antibodies  had  no  apparent  effect  on  tezepelumab  PK.  The 
number of ADA-positive subjects was too small to assess the impact of ADA on pharmacodynamics due 
to the large variability in PD responses. 
Study D5180C00013 (CASCADE) 
This study included 59 tezepelumab-treated and 57 placebo-treated subjects in the safety analysis set. 
A  total  of  4  subjects  tested  positive  for  ADA  responses  at  any  time  point  (including  at  baseline),  this 
included  2  subjects  in  the  tezepelumab  group,  and  2  subjects  in  the  placebo  group.  ADA  prevalence 
(defined  as  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  tested  positive  for  ADA  at  any  point  in  time)  in  the 
tezepelumab and placebo groups were low and similar at 3.4% (2 of 59) and 3.5% (2 of 57), respectively. 
ADA incidence (defined as the proportion of treatment emergent-ADA positive subjects in a population) 
were 0% in the tezepelumab group and 3.6% (2 subjects) in the placebo group. The 2 subjects in the 
tezepelumab group who tested positive for ADA were positive only at baseline and no subjects in the 
tezepelumab  group  had  treatment-emergent  ADAs.  Two  subjects  (3.6%)  in  the  placebo  group  were 
classified as treatment-emergent and transiently ADA positive. 
Study D5180C00011 (PATH-HOME) 
There were a total of 216 subjects (111 in the APFS group and 105 in the AI group) with an evaluable 
ADA sample at any time point. The ADA prevalence was 1.8% (2/111) in the APFS group and 10.5% 
(11/105)  in  the  AI  group.  The  ADA  incidence  (i.e.,  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  were  treatment-
emergent ADA positive) was 1.8% (2/111) in the APFS group and 7.6% (8/105) in the AI group. The 
treatment-emergent  ADA-positive  group  consisted  only  of  subjects  categorised  as  treatment-induced 
ADA  positive,  as  there  were  no  subjects  in  either  the  APFS  or  the  AI  group  who  were  categorised  as 
treatment-boosted  ADA-positive.  Overall,  ADA  titres  to  tezepelumab  were  low  in  both  APFS  and  AI 
groups. The median of the maximum ADA titre of the post-dose ADA-positive samples achieved in any 
subject through study completion was 67.20 for both subjects using the APFS device and subjects using 
the AI device. A titre of 67.20 is the limit of detection of the ADA assay. The subject with the highest 
maximum titre (537.60) in the study was ADA positive at baseline only.

The subject-level ADA status (IM) and maximum ADA titre within a subject (MAXTIT) were tested during 
popPK covariate model development and were not identified as significant covariates for tezepelumab 
CL. The impact of IM and MAXTIT on the covariate-adjusted tezepelumab CL based on the final model 
are illustrated in Figure 9. No significant difference in CL was observed between subjects with positive 
and negative ADA status or those with different maximum ADA titre values, after adjusting for significant 
covariates in the final model. No significant correlation between IWRES and the time-varying ADA status 
or titre value was observed.

Special populations 
Figure  10  shows  the  effect  of  significant  covariates  in  the  final  popPK  model  on  the  predicted  steady 
state exposure of tezepelumab following 210 mg SC Q4W dosing for 52 weeks. Overall, the differences 
in  exposure  due  to  all  covariates  were  within  the  overall  variability  of  exposure  in  the  NAVIGATOR 
population, which was -55.1% to +59.3%, -51.4% to +55.5% and -60.9% to +65.4% for the 5th to 
95th  percentiles  of  the  population  relative  to  the  typical  values  of  AUCss,  Cmax,ss,  and  Cmin,ss, 
respectively.  Based  on  these  results,  no  dose  adjustment  of  tezepelumab  is  needed  for  any  special 
populations in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and above.

Impaired renal and hepatic function 
Renal function (CRCL and GFR) and hepatic function (AST, ALT and TBL) measures were tested during 
popPK covariate model development and were not identified as significant covariates for tezepelumab 
CL. 
•  Gender 
Sex  was  tested  during  popPK  covariate  model  development  and  was  not  identified  as  a  significant 
covariate for tezepelumab PK. 
•  Race 
Population PK analysis 
Race was identified as a significant covariate on the CL of tezepelumab in the final popPK model, where 
Asian race was associated with a slightly increased CL compared with non-Asian races. The predicted 
steady state exposures following 210 mg SC Q4W dosing for subjects in the NAVIGATOR study stratified 
by  race  are  presented  in  Figure  11.  The  mean  simulated  exposures  (AUCss,  Cavg,ss,  Cmax,ss,  and 
Cmin,ss)  in  Asian,  Black,  or  Other  races  were  up  to  11.6%  higher,  8.65%  lower,  and  8.18%  lower, 
respectively, compared with those in White subjects. The slightly higher exposure in Asian subjects was 
caused  by  the  lower  body  weight  (median  of  64.5  kg),  as  the  covariate  effect  of  Asian  race  alone 
(independent of body weight and other covariates) resulted in a small decrease in tezepelumab exposure 
(see Figure 10 above). The differences in exposures between race groups were very small relative to the 
overall variability of exposures, and the interquartile ranges of predicted exposures across all race groups 
were well within the range of mean exposures in PATHWAY between 70 mg SC Q4W and 280 mg SC 
Q2W dose regimens (Figure 11).

•  Weight 
Body weight was identified as a significant covariate on the CL, Vc, Q, and Vp of tezepelumab in the final 
popPK model. Subjects with higher body weight were predicted to have lower exposure (see Figure 11, 
above). Compared with a typical subject with body weight of 70 kg, subjects with body weight at the 
5th percentile of the NAVIGATOR population (49 kg) were expected to have 43.2 %, 41.8%, and 46.1% 
higher AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss, respectively, while subjects with the 95th percentile of body weight 
(114  kg)  were  expected  to  have  38.8%,  38.0%,  and  40.5%  lower  AUCss,  Cmax,ss,  and  Cmin,ss, 
respectively. 
The predicted steady state exposures following 210 mg SC Q4W dosing for subjects in the NAVIGATOR 
study  stratified  by  body  weight  quartiles  are  presented  in  Figure  11.  The  mean  simulated  exposures 
(AUCss,  Cavg,ss,  Cmax,ss,  and  Cmin,ss)  in  the  lowest  or  highest  quartile  of  body  weight  were  up  to 
33.8% higher and 27.9% lower, respectively, compared with those of the overall NAVIGATOR population. 
These differences were small relative to the overall variability of exposures, which was more than ± 50% 
(from the 5th to 95th percentile) in the NAVIGATOR population (see Figure 11 above).

Figure 12. Simulated steady state exposures of tezepelumab by body weight quartiles following 210 
mg SC Q4W dosing 
Additional simulations were performed for subjects with extreme body weight values of 30 kg (lowest 
possible body weight in both adults and adolescents) and 170 kg (higher than the highest body weight 
in the popPK dataset, 161 kg) using the final popPK model. The predicted exposures following 210 mg 
SC Q4W dosing in both adults and 12-year-olds with body weight of 30 kg were lower than the mean 
simulated exposures at 280 mg SC Q2W in PATHWAY for AUCss, Cavg,ss, and Cmin,ss. Additionally, the 
predicted  AUCss,  Cavg,ss,  Cmax,ss,  and  Cmin,ss  values  with  body  weight  of  30  kg  were  much  lower 
compared with the observed mean values in the Phase 1 Study 1183 at 700 mg IV Q4W dose regime. 
On  the  other  hand,  the  predicted  AUCss,  Cavg,ss,  Cmax,ss,  and  Cmin,ss  following  210  mg  SC  Q4W 
dosing in adults with body weight of 170 kg were well above the simulated mean steady state exposures 
in PATHWAY at 70 mg SC Q4W dose regimen (Table 7).

•  Age 
Age was identified as a significant covariate on the Vc of tezepelumab in the final popPK model, where 
increased  age  was  associated  with  a  slightly  increased  Vc.  The  mean  simulated  exposures  (AUCss, 
Cavg,ss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss) in adolescent subjects (≥ 12 to < 18 years of age) were up to 40.7% 
higher compared with those in adults 18 to < 65 years of age. This was mainly due to the lower body 
weight in adolescent subjects (median of 60.5 kg), as the covariate effect of age alone (independent of 
body  weight  and  other  covariates)  only  had  a  small  effect  on  tezepelumab  exposure  (see  Figure  13 
above). The mean simulated exposures in adults ≥ 65 years of age were up to 12.2% higher compared 
with those in adults 18 to < 65 years of age. These differences in exposures between age groups were 
small relative to the overall variability of exposures. Additionally, the interquartile ranges of predicted 
exposures across all age groups were well within the range of mean exposures in PATHWAY between 70 
mg SC Q4W and 280 mg SC Q2W dose regimens (Figure 13).

• 
Inhaled corticosteroid dose 
ICS  dose  level  was  identified  as  a  significant  covariate  on  the  CL  and  Vc  of  tezepelumab  in  the  final 
popPK  model,  where  no  or  low  ICS  dose  was  associated  with  slightly  decreased  CL  and  Vc  compared 
with medium or high ICS dose. Subjects with no or low dose ICS were expected to have a 18.3% higher 
AUCss, 16.2% higher Cmax,ss, and 22.5% higher Cmin,ss compared with subjects on medium or high 
dose ICS. 
The  predicted  steady  state  exposures  (AUCss,  Cavg,ss,  Cmax,ss,  and  Cmin,ss)  following  210  mg  SC 
Q4W dosing for subjects in the NAVIGATOR study stratified by ICS dose level were similar between the 
medium and high ICS dose groups, with the mean exposures in the high ICS dose group up to 6.19% 
lower compared with those in the medium ICS dose group. 
Baseline C-reactive protein 
Baseline CRP level was not tested as a covariate during the popPK covariate model development because 
CRP data were not available in most studies (except NAVIGATOR and PATH-BRIDGE). The correlations 
between CRP and the covariate-adjusted CL and Vc were significant.  
Based on the NAVIGATOR study, the mean predicted simulated exposures (AUCss, Cavg,ss, Cmax,ss, 
and  Cmin,ss),  following  210  mg  SC  Q4W,  dosing  in  the  lowest  or  highest  quartile  of  CRP  were  up  to 
21.0% higher and 23.9% lower, respectively, compared with those of the overall NAVIGATOR population. 
These  differences,  which  were  partly  attributed  to  the  differences  in  body  weight  between  the  CRP 
quartiles, were small relative to the overall variability of exposures. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No  formal  DDI  studies  have  been  conducted  with  tezepelumab.  The  potential  for  tezepelumab  to  be 
involved  in  DDI  either  as  a  victim  or  perpetrator  was  evaluated.  Based  on  these  evaluations,  it  was 
concluded  that  the  potential  for  clinically  relevant  DDI  involving  tezepelumab,  either  as  a  victim  or 
perpetrator, were low for patients with severe asthma. 
Evaluation of Drug-drug Interaction with Tezepelumab as a Victim 
As a typical mAb, tezepelumab is not primarily cleared via hepatic pathways. Therefore, small molecule 
drugs  that  induce  or  inhibit  the  cytochrome  P450  pathways  are  not  expected  to  affect  the  PK  of 
Assessment report

tezepelumab.  Population  PK  analysis  indicated  that  commonly  co-administered  asthma  medications 
(including theophylline/aminophylline, LTRA, and OCS) had no effect on tezepelumab PK. 
Evaluation of Drug-drug Interaction with Tezepelumab as a Perpetrator 
Due to its large molecular size, tezepelumab is not expected to directly induce or inhibit the cytochrome 
P450  enzymes  causing  altered  PK  of  small  molecules  metabolised  by  these  enzymes.  Given  that 
tezepelumab selectively blocks TSLP, an epithelial cell-derived cytokine and upstream regulator of the 
inflammatory  cascade,  the  potential  risk  of  cytokine-mediated  TP-drug  interactions  as  result  of  TSLP 
inhibition were evaluated based on available data in literature and clinical studies. There are no data in 
the  literature  regarding  the  effect  of  TSLP  on  hepatic  cytochrome  P450  enzyme  activities.  Data  from 
tezepelumab clinical studies suggest that the physiological level of TSLP in human serum is very low. In 
PATHWAY, the median baseline serum TSLP level was 287.25 to 355.00 fg/mL in subjects with severe 
asthma. Given the low circulating levels of TSLP, an effect of TSLP on hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme 
expression is not expected. Therefore, TSLP inhibition by tezepelumab is not expected to cause TP-drug 
interaction in vivo by altering cytochrome P450 enzyme activities.  
Indirect Effect of TSLP Inhibition on Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Activities by Modulating Downstream Pro-
inflammatory Cytokines 
Treatment  by  tezepelumab  has  been  shown  to  lead  to  reduced  IL-5  and  IL-13  levels  in  the  serum. 
Blocking IL-4/IL-13 did not have a clinically relevant effect on cytochrome P450 activities in vivo. In vitro 
data indicate that IL-5 is unlikely to affect major P450 (CYP1A2, 2B6, or 3A4) enzyme activity.  Therefore, 
inhibition of IL-13 or IL-5 by tezepelumab is unlikely to affect the cytochrome P450 pathways and cause 
clinically relevant TP-drug interaction in vivo. 
Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β and tumour-necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) are known to 
downregulate  P450  enzyme  expression  (Abdel-Razzak  et  al  1993;  Morgan  1997),  and  lead  to  reduced 
drug metabolism during inflammation and infection (Aitken et al 2006). Elevated circulating levels of IL-
6 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been shown to lead to reduced CYP3A4 activities and 
drug  metabolism  by  CYP3A4  compared  with  healthy  subjects,  while  blocking  IL-6  by  treatment  with  a 
mAb against IL-6 reversed this effect (Schmitt et al 2011).  
In NAVIGATOR, treatment with tezepelumab led to a mean change of -0.201 pg/mL in IL-6, from a mean 
baseline level of 3.694 pg/mL to Week 52, which indicates that tezepelumab had no meaningful effect on 
IL-6 levels in subjects with severe asthma. Consistent with the findings for IL-6, tezepelumab also had 
no meaningful effect on C-reactive protein (CRP) (an acute phase pro-inflammatory marker induced by 
IL-6). In NAVIGATOR, subjects treated with tezepelumab had a mean change of -0.506 mg/L in the CRP 
level from baseline to Week 52, which was small compared with the mean baseline level of 4.945 mg/L. 
Similar results were also observed in PATHWAY. 
It is of note that the mean baseline values of ~3.5 to 3.7 pg/mL for IL-6 and ~4.4 to 4.9 mg/L for CRP 
measured  in  NAVIGATOR  were  considerably  lower  than  baseline  values  reported  for  patients  with  RA 
(~50 pg/mL for IL-6 and ~30 mg/L for CRP) (Schmitt et al 2011), indicating lower levels of systemic 
inflammation  in  patients  with  asthma  compared  with  RA.  The  relatively  low  systemic  inflammatory 
burden  in  patients  with  asthma  was  further  illustrated  by  the  low  serum  levels  of  IL-1β  and  TNFα 
measured in PATHWAY. More than 95% of the IL-1β samples were below the lower limit of quantification 
(LLOQ) (5.6 pg/mL) and 99% of the TNFα samples were below the LLOQ (62 pg/mL) at baseline and 
post-treatment, confirming low systemic levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines in asthma patients. 
In summary, given the low levels of systemic inflammatory burden in asthma patients and the limited 
effect  of  tezepelumab  on  IL-6  and  CRP  levels,  the  applicant  was  of  the  view  that  treatment  with 
tezepelumab  is  unlikely  to  cause  clinically  relevant  TP-drug  interaction  in  patients  with  asthma  by 
modulating downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines that are known to affect P450 enzymes. 
Exposure relevant for safety 
Based on the population PK model, the simulated mean steady state exposure values of the NAVIGATOR 
population following 210 mg SC Q4W dosing were 901 µg*day/mL, 32.2 µg/mL, 40.9 µg/mL, and 22.5 
µg/mL for AUCss, Cavg,ss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss, respectively.

2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamic data from clinical studies of tezepelumab included change from baseline data for blood 
eosinophil counts, FeNO, total serum IgE, serum IL-5, and serum IL-13 from the NAVIGATOR, PATHWAY, 
SOURCE,  and  CASCADE  studies,  and  for  plasma  eosinophil-derived  neurotoxin  (EDN)  and  bronchial 
submucosal inflammatory cells collected by biopsy from subjects in the CASCADE study. 
Mechanism of action 
Tezepelumab is a monoclonal antibody (IgG2λ) directed against thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), 
preventing its interaction with the heterodimeric TSLP receptor. In asthma, both allergic and non-allergic 
triggers  induce  TSLP  production.  Blocking  TSLP  with  tezepelumab  reduces  a  broad  spectrum  of 
biomarkers  and  cytokines  associated  with  airway  inflammation  (e.g.  blood  eosinophils,  airway 
submucosal eosinophils, IgE, FeNO, IL-5, and IL-13); however, the mechanism of action of tezepelumab 
in asthma has not been definitively established.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Results  from  clinical  studies  of  tezepelumab  in  subjects  with  severe  asthma  (NAVIGATOR,  PATHWAY, 
SOURCE,  and  CASCADE)  demonstrated  that  the  levels  of  inflammatory  biomarkers  (blood  eosinophil 
counts, FeNO, and total serum IgE) and cytokines (serum IL-5 and serum IL-13), as well as plasma EDN, 
decreased  following  treatment  with  tezepelumab  compared  with  placebo.  In  addition,  in  CASCADE, 
tezepelumab  reduced  airway  inflammation,  as  measured  by  decreases  in  bronchial  submucosal 
eosinophils compared with placebo.  
Blood Eosinophil Counts 
Across studies, tezepelumab reduced blood eosinophil counts from baseline compared with placebo, with 
effect seen by 2 to 4 weeks (2 weeks was the earliest time point assessed in tezepelumab studies) and 
maintained for up to 52 weeks (study durations varied; 52 weeks was the longest study period assessed). 
Representative  results  from  NAVIGATOR  are  shown  below  for  subjects  with  asthma  who  received 
tezepelumab  210  mg  Q4W  (Figure  14).  Similar  figures  are  available  for  PATHWAY,  SOURCE  and 
CASCADE studies.

time (full analysis set) - NAVIGATOR 
In NAVIGATOR, at end of treatment, the mean blood eosinophil counts decreased by 164.5 cells/μL from 
a baseline of 326.7 cells/μL in subjects who received tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W, compared with a smaller 
decrease  of  43.8  cells/μL  from  a  baseline  of  353.4  cells/μL  in  subjects  who  received  placebo.  Results 
were generally comparable across studies (Table 9). Reductions in blood eosinophil counts were observed 
at  all  doses  of  tezepelumab  (70  mg  Q4W,  210  mg  Q4W,  and  280  mg  Q2W)  tested  in  the  Phase  2b 
PATHWAY study.

FeNO 
Across studies, tezepelumab reduced FeNO levels from baseline compared with placebo, with effect seen 
by 2 to 4 weeks (2 weeks was the earliest time point assessed in tezepelumab studies) and maintained 
for up to 52 weeks (study durations varied; 52 weeks was the longest study period assessed).

Bronchial submucosal inflammatory cells (CASCADE) 
The primary objective of the CASCADE study was to assess the effect of tezepelumab 210 mg SC Q4w 
in  the  number  of  airway  submucosal  inflammatory  cells/mm2  of  bronchial  biopsies.  Treatment  with 
tezepelumab compared to placebo resulted in a 6.7-fold reduction in the ratio change from baseline to 
EOT  in  the  primary  endpoint  of  airway  submucosal  eosinophils  (ratio  of  geometric  least  squares  (LS) 
Means 0.15, 90% CI [0.06 to 0.35]). The results, in terms of change from baseline to EOT (following 52 
weeks treatment) are presented in Figure 19 below.

Pharmacodynamics in adolescents 
Consistent  with  the  findings  in  the  overall  (including  subjects  of  all  ages)  NAVIGATOR  population, 
adolescent subjects (≥ 12 to < 18 years of age) who received tezepelumab had reduced levels of blood 
eosinophils, FeNO, and total serum IgE from baseline compared with placebo. The effect of tezepelumab 
on  blood  eosinophil  and  FeNO  levels  (ie,  reductions  from  baseline)  was  seen  by  2  to  4  weeks  and 
maintained throughout the course of the study to end of treatment at 52 weeks. In addition, tezepelumab 
reduced  total  serum  IgE  levels  gradually  over  time  from  baseline  to  end  of  treatment  compared  with 
placebo in adolescents. The relative magnitude of reduction in blood eosinophil counts, FeNO, and total 
serum  IgE  from  baseline,  were  generally  comparable  between  adolescent  subjects  and  the  overall 
population  (although  higher  baseline  levels  were  observed  in  adolescents  in  some  cases),  suggesting 
that tezepelumab had similar PD effects in adolescents and adults with severe asthma at the dose of 210 
mg SC Q4W (Table 14).

Secondary pharmacology 
No formal secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with tezepelumab.  
Concentration-QTc relationship 
A  formal,  thorough  QT  clinical  study  was  not  conducted  for  tezepelumab  as  there  were  no  relevant 
nonclinical findings, no mechanistic rationale, and no relevant findings from available electrocardiogram 
(ECG)/AE clinical data. 
An analysis of concentration-QTc relationship for tezepelumab was undertaken in Study 0620 (Phase 1 
SAD study) following single-dose SC and IV administration over a range of doses (2.1 to 420 mg SC and 
210  to  700  mg  IV).  No  subject  had  a  post-baseline  maximum  QTcF  interval  >  450  msec  with  the 
exception of one subject (2.1 mg SC) in Part A who had a post-baseline maximum QTcF interval > 450 
to 480 msec. The relationship between tezepelumab concentration and QTcF was evaluated graphically. 
The  results  of  the  analysis  suggested  that  there  was  no  relationship  between  QTcF  interval  and 
tezepelumab concentration in healthy subjects. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products 
No PD interaction studies have been conducted. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Exposure-Response Analysis (NAVIGATOR Study) 
The objectives of the analysis were to evaluate the relationship between tezepelumab exposure or body 
weight and response measures at the target dose of 210 mg SC Q4W using data from the pivotal Phase 
3 NAVIGATOR study. Observed median Ctrough,ss was used as the exposure measure. The response 
measures included annualised asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) and the change from baseline in pre-
bronchodilator (BD) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). The analysis included a total of 494 
subjects from the tezepelumab group and 531 subjects from the placebo group.

Exposure-Response Relationship 
The  AAER  ratio  over  52  weeks  by  exposure  (observed  median  Ctrough,ss)  quartiles  versus  placebo, 
based on negative binomial regression modelling, are shown in Figure 20. The rate ratios (95% CI) of 
AAER  over  52  weeks  between  the  tezepelumab  group  and  the  placebo  group  by  observed  Ctrough,ss 
quartiles were 0.41 (0.30, 0.57), 0.49 (0.36, 0.67), 0.38 (0.27, 0.52), and 0.53 (0.38, 0.72). The rate 
ratios in all the exposure quartiles were less than 1, with the 95% CIs not including 1, indicating that 
subjects receiving tezepelumab had lower AAER than subjects in the placebo group. The rate ratios were 
similar across the Ctrough,ss quartiles, suggesting that there was no relationship between drug exposure 
and AAER reduction in tezepelumab-treated subjects.

Ctrough,ss  quartile  and  placebo  group  based  on  the  mixed  model  with  repeated  measures  (MMRM)

52 were 0.052 L (-0.028 L, 0.133 L), 0.212 L (0.132 L, 0.292 L), 0.174 L (0.094 L, 0.254 L), and 0.099 
L (0.018 L, 0.180 L). The LS mean pre-BD FEV1 change from baseline was larger in each of the observed 
median Ctrough,ss quartiles than in the placebo group. The pre-BD FEV1 improvement was smallest in 
the first Ctrough,ss quartile and largest in the second Ctrough,ss quartile and there was no clear trend 
between drug exposure and change from baseline in pre-BD FEV1 across all the quartiles.

Effect of body weight on response 
The AAER ratios over 52 weeks between tezepelumab and placebo by body weight quartiles were derived 
from negative binomial regression modelling. The rate ratios (95% CI) of AAER over 52 weeks between 
the tezepelumab group and the placebo group were 0.42 (0.29, 0.61), 0.45 (0.31, 0.66), 0.49 (0.34, 
0.72), and 0.41 (0.28, 0.60), respectively, for the first to the fourth body weight quartiles (Figure 22). 
The AAER rate ratios were less than 1 and the 95% CIs did not include 1 in all body weight quartiles, 
indicating that subjects receiving tezepelumab had lower AAER than subjects in the placebo group. The 
rate ratios were similar across body weight quartiles, indicating that there was no effect of body weight 
on AAER reduction in tezepelumab-treated subjects.

The differences in LS means (95% CI) of pre-BD FEV1 between the tezepelumab group and the placebo

0.167 L (0.068 L, 0.266 L), and 0.098 L (-0.002 L, 0.198 L) (Figure 23). In all body weight quartiles, 
the LS means pre-BD FEV1 change from baseline was larger in the tezepelumab group than in the placebo 
group. The results suggest that there was no effect of body weight on change from baseline of pre-BD 
FEV1 in subjects treated with tezepelumab.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
PHARMACOKINETICS 
Bioanalytical methods 
Serum Tezepelumab concentration 
Serum  samples  for  the  assessment  of  tezepelumab  concentrations  were  analysed  using  a  validated 
ELISAassay. Samples were analysed by the applicant and the method was subsequently transferred and 
validated at PPD. Bioanalytical methods are considered to have been validated in accordance with the 
EMA Guideline on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1) taking also 
into account time when the methods were developed and validated. Additionally, provided justification 
for  not  performing  assessment  of  parallelism  for  the  PPD,  but  dilutional  linearity  and  Hook  effect 
analyses, was also taken into account by the CHMP. 
Immunogenicity (ADA assay and nAb assay) 
The initial anti-drug antibody (ADA) method validation were conducted by the applicant as well as 
bioanalyses for the clinical studies from Phase I and Phase II. The method was then transferred and 
validated at PPD laboratories. With that method, bioanalyses were performed for the Phase I, II and III 
clinical studies. For detection of anti-tezepelumab antibodies in human serum screening and 
confirmatory method utilised electro-chemiluminescent (ECL) immunoassay using the Meso-Scale 
Discovery (MSD. The neutralising antibody (nAb) assay developed by the applicant also utilised MSD 
based ECL immunoassay after which protein G/L depletion confirmatory assay confirms nAbs. Due to 
insufficient sensitivity and drug tolerance of the applicant’s assay, PPD developed and validated 
method which was used for samples from Phase III clinical studies. The method utilised ECL

immunoassay using MSD. Regarding ADA and nAb assays, data for the critical reagents were also 
presented by the applicant. 
Tezepelumab population pharmacokinetic analysis 
The  methods  used  for  model  development  and  evaluation  are  acceptable.  Data  exclusions  were  well 
documented and are acceptable. This popPK analysis encompassed PK data from the Phase 3 NAVIGATOR 
study,  Phase  2b  PATHWAY  study,  and  6  Phase  1  studies.  Exploratory  data  analysis  indicated  no 
substantial  differences  between  different  studies  for  the  same  regimen  and  route  of  administration. 
Therefore, the pooling of data from these studies is considered acceptable. 
In  the  dosage  range  tested,  a  two-compartment  linear  model  best  described  tezepelumab  PK.  Model 
parameters were estimated with adequate precision. The shrinkage of CL and Vc in both the base and 
final model were low, indicating that EBEs for these parameters can be considered reliable. As shown in 
the diagnostic plots, individual fits, pcVPCs and numerical predictive checks, the final model described 
the PK data well and is considered adequate for performing simulations.  
In the final popPK model, body weight, ICS dose level (no/low versus medium/high dose), race (Asian 
versus non-Asian), formulation (Clinical Process 1 versus Clinical Process 2), and age were identified as 
statistically significant covariates on the PK of tezepelumab. Consistent with other monoclonal antibodies, 
body  weight  was  the  most  influential  covariate.  The  second  most  influential  covariate  was  ICS  dose. 
Race, formulation, and age were shown to have small effects on CL or Vc. Body weight explained 34.4% 
and 33.1% of the overall variability of CL and Vc, respectively (in the base model), while the rest of the 
covariates (ICS dose level, race, formulation, and age) explained only 7.94% and 11.7% of the remaining 
variability of CL and Vc, respectively (in the final model). Other  covariates evaluated in the covariate 
model development and/or post-hoc covariate analysis did not have a statistically significant impact the 
PK  of  tezepelumab.  Please  see  Section  2.1.9  (Special  populations)  for  further  details  of  relevant 
covariates. 
Overall, the population PK analysis was well executed with no notable issues. 
Absorption 
•  Bioavailability 
The absolute bioavailability of a single subcutaneously administered tezepelumab at a dose of 210 mg 
was  assessed  in  healthy  subjects  in  phase  1  Study  20070620  and  reported  as  81  %relative  to  IV 
administration  of  the  same  dose.  Based  on  the  population  PK  analysis,  bioavailability  (F)  after  SC 
administration was estimated at 76.8% (SmPC 5.2). Upon request from the CHMP, the applicant clarified 
the  method  of  the  blinding  in  study  20070620.  The  clarifications  provided  by  the  applicant  were 
considered adequate.  
Bioequivalence 
Study  D5180C00012  (PATH-BRIDGE)  was  a  phase  1  open-label,  randomised,  parallel-group  study  in 
healthy adult subjects to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of tezepelumab administered via an accessorized 
pre-filled syringe (APFS) or autoinjector (AI) compared with vial-and-syringe used through most of the 
clinical development program (the functionality of both the APFS and AI were assessed in the phase III 
PATH-HOME study). In general, the study has been appropriately designed in line with the relevant EMA 
guidance (‘Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence’ Doc. Ref.: CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ 
Corr). Sample size was based on SD in PK measures from previous phase I studies and no widening of 
the acceptance interval was proposed. 
The %geometric LS mean ratios of serum tezepelumab (AI/V-S) and associated 90% CI of Cmax, AUC0-
t and AUC0-∞ were 1.04 [0.97, 1.11]; 1.03 [0.96, 1.11] and 1.03 [0.96, 1.10]. Bioequivalence in terms 
of AUCt and AUC∞ between the two formulations was demonstrated. The %geometric LS mean ratios 
of  serum  tezepelumab  (APFS/V-S)  and  associated  90%  CI  of  Cmax,  AUC0-t  and  AUC0-∞  were  1.06 
[0.99,  1.13];  1.07  [0.99,  1.14]  and  1.07  [0.99,  1.15].  Bioequivalence  in  terms  of  AUCt  and  AUC∞ 
between the two formulations was demonstrated. The %geometric LS mean ratios of serum tezepelumab 
(AI/APFS) and associated 90% CI of Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were 1.02 [0.95, 1.09]; 1.04 [0.97,

1.11] and 1.04 [0.96, 1.11]. Bioequivalence in terms of AUCt and AUC∞ between the two formulations 
was  demonstrated.  The  applicant  has  included  a  qualitative  comparison  of  differences  in  PK  following 
administration to injection sites in the abdomen, thigh and upper arm. Post-hoc statistical analyses of 
calculated  geometric  mean  ratios  of  pharmacokinetic  parameters  examining  respective  differences 
following  administration  of  the  autoinjector,  accessorised  prefilled  syringe  and  vial  and  syringe 
presentations to injection sites in the abdomen, thigh, and upper arm were conducted. The 90% CI for 
these ratios are all within 0.7-1.4. While the data were variable, the CHMP agreed that these observed 
differences were unlikely to be of clinical relevance. 
Relatively high inter-individual variability in the tmax values was observed in the PATH-BRIDGE study. 
Following  tezepelumab  administration  using  AI  as  a  device,  minimum  tmax  was  1  day,  and  maximal 
tmax using VS as a device tmax was set for 56 days. The applicant presented an analysis of the Tmax 
across the studies regarding the different methods of drug administration. The results (PATH-BRIDGE 
study) suggested that the Tmax of the tezepelumab following single subcutaneous administration of 210 
mg was generally similar irrespective of the injection site and treatment group. The time profiles of the 
three outliers were similar. The late observed Tmax in two subjects can be explained by a single outlier 
data point, and that phenomenon is unrelated to the device or injection site. The presented explanations 
are sufficient. 
Distribution 
The relatively small volume of distribution of tezepelumab (Vc 3.91L and Vp 2.17L for a 70 kg individual, 
SmPC 5.2) is typical of monoclonal antibodies, which are largely confined to the vascular and interstitial 
spaces due to their large molecular size and poor lipophilicity. 
Elimination 
The lack of specific excretion or metabolism studies is acceptable because tezepelumab is a protein which 
is primarily cleared by proteolytic catabolism and broken down into small peptides and individual amino 
acids. From population pharmacokinetic analysis, the estimated clearance for tezepelumab was 0.17 L/d 
for a 70 kg individual. The elimination half-life was approximately 26 days (SmPC 5.2). 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
In  healthy  male  volunteer  studies  (SAD  study  20070620  and  MAD  study  20080390),  tezepelumab 
exhibited almost dose proportional increases in exposure over the range of 2.1 mg to 420 mg SC. 
Exploratory data analysis for the popPK analysis revealed that tezepelumab exhibited linear PK over the 
tested dose range of 2.1 to 420 mg SC and 210 to 700 mg IV. 
Simulations  based  on  the  population  PK  model  suggested  that  the  PK  of  tezepelumab  was  not  time 
dependent. Following repeated dosing  of tezepelumab 210 mg SC Q4W, the mean accumulation ratio 
was estimated at 1.86. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Based on the final population PK model, residual (intra-individual) variability was relatively low (13.9%). 
Inter-individual  variability  of  CL  and  Vc  was  moderate  at  approximately  30%  and  36%,  respectively. 
However,  overall  inter-individual  variability  of  exposure  in  the  NAVIGATOR  study  was  relatively  high, 
ranging between -55.1% to +59.3% for AUCss. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
In the phase 2b PATHWAY study, tezepelumab exhibited linear PK across doses of 70 mg Q4W, 210 mg 
Q4W, and 280 mg Q2W. Serum trough concentrations increased over time and achieved steady state by 
Week  12,  with  a  mean  accumulation  ratio  of  1.65-1.82.  It  is  noted  that  27  subjects  administered 
tezepelumab in this study had unexpected PK results. The applicant highlighted that the cause of the PK 
anomalies  was  not  identified,  despite  thorough  analysis.  However,  the  exclusion  of  subjects  with  the 
anomalous PK profiles had a minimal impact on the overall mean PK concentration and variability. The 
unexpected PK results cannot be explained by ADA response as in all 14 cases the ADA was not identified.

EMA/682391/2022  
Page 71/215 
 
 
 
In  the  pivotal  phase  3  NAVIGATOR  study,  after  administration  of  tezepelumab  210  mg  SC  Q4W,  the 
mean serum trough concentration increased over time, approaching steady state by Week 12 in all age 
groups. The mean serum trough concentrations in adolescents (age 12 to < 18 years) were higher than 
those in adults, likely due to lower body weight in adolescents compared with adults. The mean serum 
trough concentration was similar between adults of age 18 to < 65 years and those ≥ 65 years of age. 
In  the  phase  3  SOURCE  study,  tezepelumab  trough  concentrations  also  increased  over  time  and 
approached steady state by Week 12. 
In study D5180C00013 (CASCADE), the measured trough serum concentrations demonstrated adequate 
exposure to the IMP. Sampling was not designed to compute PK parameters. 
In  Study  D5180C00011  (PATH-HOME),  trough  tezepelumab  serum  concentrations  were  comparable 
between the single-use accessorised pre-filled syringe (APFS) and an (autoinjector) AI device at all time 
points assessed. 
Immunogenicity 
Tezepelumab exhibited low immunogenicity in phase 1 studies. Although there were a number of subjects 
who  tested  positive  for  ADA  at  baseline,  no  subject  was  reported  as  developing  tezepelumab  ADA 
following exposure. 
In  the  phase  2b  PATHWAY  study,  a  low  incidence  of  ADA  was  observed  across  all  treatment  groups. 
There was no apparent impact of ADA on tezepelumab PK. 
In  the  pivotal  phase  3  NAVIGATOR  study,  the  incidence  of  ADAs  and  nAbs  in  patients  treated  at  the 
proposed  tezepelumab  dose  of  210  mg  Q4W  was  low.  No  adolescent  subjects  developed  treatment-
emergent ADAs or nAbs. There were no apparent effects of ADA on tezepelumab PK or PD. 
In the phase 3 SOURCE study, the incidence of ADAs was also low and there was no apparent effect on 
tezepelumab PK. 
Consistent  with  other  the  studies,  the  incidence  of  ADAs  in  phase  II  study  D5180C00013  (CASCADE) 
was low (3.4 % and 3.5 % in the tezepelumab and placebo groups respectively). 
In  Study  D5180C00011  (PATH-HOME)  ADA  incidence  was  again  relatively  low.  However,  there  was  a 
noted  increase  in  incidence  in  the  AI  group  relative  to  the  APFS  group  (1.8  %  and  7.6%  in  terms  of 
treatment induced ADAs). The cause of this discrepancy is unknown. The applicant discussed this finding, 
highlighting that the majority of ADA positive subjects in the PATH-HOME study had post baseline ADA 
titres  at  or  below  the  minimum  required  dilution,  with  several  of  these  being  considered  borderline 
positive  results  and  furthermore  stated  they  may  in  fact  be  false  positives.  While  the  applicant’s 
argumentation  is  considered  reasonably  plausible,  based  on  the  applicant’s  own  pre-defined  criteria, 
these must be considered positive results. However, it is accepted that ADA positivity did not exhibit a 
demonstrable  effect  on  tezepelumab  PK  parameters,  therefore  this  issue  while  not  fully  resolved  is 
considered unlikely to be of clinical relevance. 
The  results  of  the  population  PK  analysis  indicated  that  there  was  no  significant  effect  of  ADA 
(positive/negative status or titre) on the PK of tezepelumab. 
The  applicant  commented  that  there were  no  plans  to  monitor immunogenicity  in  the  post-marketing 
setting and this is endorsed by the CHMP based on the data from the presented studies. 
Special populations 
•  Renal and hepatic impairment 
It is agreed that no dose adjustment of tezepelumab is needed in terms of renal or hepatic impairment 
(SmPC 4.2). 
•  Gender and race 
It is agreed that no dose adjustment of tezepelumab is needed in terms of gender.  
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 72/215 
 
 
 
In the population PK analysis, slightly higher tezepelumab exposure was predicted in Asian vs non-Asian 
subjects, likely due to differences in body weight. Based on these results, it is agreed that no dosage 
adjustment of tezepelumab is needed in terms of race (SmPC 5.2). 
•  Weight 
Body weight was the most influential covariate on tezepelumab exposure in the population PK analysis. 
Moderate  exposure  variations  were  predicted  across  body  weight  quartiles.  However,  the  predicted 
exposures over the entire body weight range of 30 to 170 kg at the dose of 210 mg SC Q4W were within 
the range of exposures observed in PATHWAY (between the 70 mg SC Q4W and 280 mg SC Q2W dose 
regimens),  at  which  clinically  meaningful  efficacy  and  acceptable  safety  of  tezepelumab  were 
demonstrated. As such, it is agreed that no dose adjustment of tezepelumab is needed in terms of body 
weight, which is further supported by the exposure-response analysis of tezepelumab (SmPC 5.2).  
•  Age 
Moderate exposure variations were predicted between adolescents and adults aged 18 to < 65 years, 
which was largely due to differences in body weight. The simulated exposures in these age groups at the 
dose of 210 mg SC Q4W were within the range of exposures in PATHWAY (between the 70 mg SC Q4W 
and 280 mg SC Q2W dose regimens), at which clinically meaningful efficacy and acceptable safety of 
tezepelumab were demonstrated. Small or negligible exposure variations were predicted between adults 
≥ 65 years and 18 to < 65 years of age. Only a limited number of elderly patients (n=6) were included 
in  the  clinical  PK  studies,  with  no  data  in  patients  ≥75  years  of  age.  Nevertheless,  safety  has  been 
assessed  in  a  large  number  of  elderly  patients  and,  it  is  thus  agreed  that  no  dose  adjustment  of 
tezepelumab is needed in terms of age (SmPC 4.2 and 5.2).  
• 
Inhaled corticosteroid dose 
ICS dose level (no/low versus medium/high dose) had modest effects on tezepelumab exposure, which 
are not considered to be clinically meaningful considering the overall variability of tezepelumab exposure. 
As such, it is agreed that no dose adjustment of tezepelumab is needed in terms of ICS dose. 
•  Baseline C-reaction protein 
Moderate exposure variations were predicted across CRP quartiles. However, the simulated exposures 
across quartiles at 210 mg SC Q4W were within the range of exposures in PATHWAY (between the 70 
mg SC Q4W and 280 mg SC Q2W dose regimens), at which clinically meaningful efficacy and acceptable 
safety of tezepelumab were demonstrated. As such, it is agreed that no dose adjustment of tezepelumab 
is needed in terms of ICS dose. 
Overall, no dose adjustments of tezepelumab are considered necessary for tezepelumab for any special 
populations. The wording in SmPC section 4.2 in relation to special populations is considered acceptable. 
Interactions 
No formal DDI studies have been conducted with tezepelumab. Instead, the applicant has presented a 
weight of evidence-based approach to suggest the risk of DDI with tezepelumab is low. To justify this, 
the applicant commented that as a MAb tezepelumab is unlikely to interact with CYP isoenzymes directly, 
nor is it metabolised via this system. Hence, it is not a direct victim/perpetrator of CYP isoenzyme based 
DDIs (SmPC 4.5). Baseline levels of TSLP are very low (with baseline serum levels reported in the fg 
range) and therefore an indirect effect via TSLP inhibition is also unlikely.  
They have also provided discussion on the effect of tezepelumab administration on baseline levels of IL-
6, CRP, TNFα and IL-1β in the NAVIGATOR and PATHWAY studies noting that although tezepelumab was 
associated with changes in these inflammatory cytokines from baseline, these changes were relatively 
small and unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Significant reductions in serum IL-5 and IL-13 levels are 
unlikely to lead to altered CYP enzyme activity based on data from previous authorisations. Population 
(including 
PK  analysis 
theophylline/aminophylline, LTRA, and OCS) had no effect on tezepelumab PK. In general, the applicant’s 
argumentation is endorsed and it is accepted that there is a low risk of tezepelumab being either the 
perpetrator or victim of clinically relevant DDIs.

PHARMACODYNAMICS 
Primary pharmacology 
In phase 1 study D5180C00002, tezepelumab administered as a single 140 mg SC dose to adolescent 
subjects  with  mild  to  moderate  asthma,  was  associated  with  a  reduction  in  eosinophil  numbers  from 
baseline which was still evident up to day 85. The reduction was more pronounced in the 12-14 relative 
to the 15-17 age cohort, with similar results reported in terms of serum IgE levels. Only minor differences 
in  exposers  were  noted  between  these  age  groups.  The  low  number  of  subjects  in  this  trial  renders 
statistical consideration of these results non-informative, therefore further discussion on this point is not 
being pursued. 
In phase 1 Study 20101183, tezepelumab administered 700 mg IV Q4W for 3 doses to adult subjects 
with atopic asthma resulted in a reduction in FeNO and blood eosinophil numbers relative to placebo. 
This  difference  from  placebo  was  maintained  during  periods  of  Methacholine  challenge.  No  effect  on 
serum IgE levels was observed in this study. 
In the phase 2b PATHWAY study, reductions in the levels of blood eosinophil counts, FeNO, and total 
serum IgE were observed at all 3 doses (70 mg Q4W, 210 mg Q4W, and 280 mg Q2W) of tezepelumab 
tested.  No  clear  and  consistent  trend  of  dose-response  was  observed  in  these  PD  biomarkers  across 
these  3  doses.  The  observed  reduction  in  these  inflammatory  biomarkers  and  cytokines  following 
treatment with tezepelumab provide support for the proposed anti-inflammatory action of tezepelumab. 
In the pivotal phase 3 NAVIGATOR study, tezepelumab at the proposed dose of 210 mg SC Q4W reduced 
levels of biomarker and cytokines associated with inflammation. The onset of effect was observed at 2 
weeks post first dose and was sustained for up to 52 weeks for blood eosinophils, FeNO, serum IL-5, 
and serum IL-13. For total serum IgE, there was a progressive reduction from baseline to EOT. Similar 
PD effects were observed in adolescents with severe asthma at the dose of 210 mg SC Q4W. 
Consistent with the results of PATHWAY and NAVIGATOR studies, tezepelumab 210 mg SC Q4W resulted 
in  a  sustained  reduction  in  biomarkers  and  cytokines  associated  with  inflammation  in  the  phase  3 
SOURCE study. 
The CASCADE study demonstrated that 210 mg SC Q4W treatment with tezepeulumab to adults with 
inadequately  controlled  asthma  for  52  weeks  resulted  in  a  decrease  from  baseline  in  the  ratio  of  the 
LSMeans of lung submucosal eosinophils (per mm2) relative to placebo. Of note, this study also reported 
a  mild  increase  in  the  absolute  number  of  lung  mucosal  neutrophils  (per  mm2)  from  baseline  in  the 
tezepelumab group relative to controls. The direct clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. In line 
with  previous  studies,  tezepelumab  treatment  was  associated  with  a  decrease  in  biomarkers  and 
cytokines associated with inflammation. 
Secondary pharmacology 
The lack of formal secondary PD studies is acceptable. It is agreed that mAbs such as tezepelumab have 
a very low likelihood for ion channel interactions and therefore thorough QT/QTc studies are not generally 
needed.  
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Pharmacodynamic  interactions  were  not  discussed  by  the  applicant.  This  is  not  unusual  in  clinical 
developments  of  monoclonal  antibodies  and  is  based  on  the  argument  that  they  are  specific  for  their 
ligand(s)  and  unbound  molecules  are  rapidly  degraded  into  pharmacologically  inactive  peptides  and 
amino acids. 
Exposure-response analysis (NAVIGATOR STUDY) 
In the exposure-response analysis, based on data from the pivotal phase 3 NAVIGATOR study, there was 
no apparent relationship between drug exposure and the efficacy of tezepelumab on AAER reduction and 
pre-BD  FEV1  improvement  at  the  dose  of  tezepelumab  210  mg  SC  Q4W.  There  was  also  no  effect  of 
body weight on the efficacy of tezepelumab on AAER reduction and pre-BD FEV1 improvement at the 
dose of tezepelumab 210 mg SC Q4W.  
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 74/215 
 
 
 
It is agreed  that these results support  fixed dosing  of tezepelumab at 210 mg SC Q4W in adults and 
adolescents, with no dose adjustment needed for body weight or any other factors. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considered that the applicant has sufficiently addressed the issues on clinical pharmacology. 
The proposed dosing regimen of 210 mg, administered as a subcutaneous injection, every 4 weeks was 
considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Three  main  studies  support  the  efficacy  of  tezepelumab;  2  were  asthma  exacerbation  studies 
(NAVIGATOR and PATHWAY) and one was an oral corticosteroid (OCS)-reduction study (SOURCE). 
Confirmatory asthma exacerbation studies 
•  NAVIGATOR  (D5180C00007)  (pivotal  study):  Phase  3,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled  study  of  tezepelumab  210  mg  every  4  weeks  (Q4W)  administered  subcutaneously 
(SC) in adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 to 80 years with inadequately controlled asthma, 
with a 52-week treatment period (N = 1061 randomised, 1059 treated) 
•  PATHWAY  (CD-RI-MEDI9929-1146;  D5180C00001):  Phase  2b,  randomised,  double-blind, 
placebo-controlled dose-ranging study of tezepelumab administered SC in adults aged 18 to 75 
years  with  inadequately  controlled  asthma,  with  a  52-week  treatment  period  (N  =  550

2.6.5.1.  Dose response study   
A  Phase  2  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
tezepelumab in adult subjects with inadequately controlled, severe asthma 
Methods 
This was a Phase 2, multicenter, multinational, dose-ranging, double-blind, randomised, parallel-arm, 
placebo-controlled  study  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  3  dose  levels  of  tezepelumab  on  the  annual 
exacerbation rate AER in adult subjects with inadequately controlled, severe asthma. 
A treatment period of 52 weeks was considered an appropriate duration to ensure that adequate numbers 
of exacerbation events were observed during the study to determine the treatment effect on the primary 
endpoint. 
Approximately 110 study centers were planned to participate in the study.  
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive one of 3 dose levels of SC tezepelumab (70 mg 
Q4W, 210 mg Q4W, 280 mg Q2W, or placebo Q2W for 52 weeks). Subjects were planned to be in this 
study  for  approximately  1.3  years  (69  weeks),  which  included  a  screening/run-in  period  of  up  to 
approximately  5  weeks,  a  52-week  treatment  period,  and  a  12-week  post-treatment  safety  follow-up 
period. The last dose of investigational product was administered at Week 50.

Doses chosen 
Three dose levels of tezepelumab were evaluated in this dose-ranging study to explore the optimal dose 
and regimen of tezepelumab for use in this patient population. The low (70 mg Q4W), medium (210 mg 
Q4W), and high (280 mg Q2W) dose levels of tezepelumab were selected to provide minimum exposure 
overlap between treatment arms. There were none established pharmacodynamic (PD) markers available 
to directly determine the level of TSLP inhibition provided by the selected dose levels. Therefore, it was 
not feasible to significantly narrow the selected dose range. 
The high-dose (280 mg Q2W) of tezepelumab approximated the trough PK levels achieved in the inhaled 
allergen  challenge  study  (Study  20101183)  with  700  mg  intravenous  (IV)  Q4W,  which  demonstrated 
improvement in physiologic measurements in subjects with mild atopic asthma. 
These  dose  regimens  were  also  appropriate  from  a  safety  perspective  as  the  predicted  steady-state 
exposures were within the range of the exposures achieved in previous studies. 
Treatments 
Approximately 552 subjects were planned to be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive one of 3 SC 
dose levels of tezepelumab or SC placebo for 52 weeks. All subjects received 3 injections (2 × 1.5 mL 
and 1 × 1.0 mL) Q2W in order to maintain the blinding of the different doses.

An asthma exacerbation was defined as a worsening of asthma that led to any of the following criteria:  
- 
use of systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days (a single depo-injectable dose of corticosteroids 
is considered equivalent to a 3-day course of systemic corticosteroids and for subjects receiving 
maintenance OCS, a temporary doubling of the maintenance dose for at least 3 days qualifies);  
- 
- 
An ED visit due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days;  
An inpatient hospitalisation due to asthma.  
An  asthma  exacerbation  that  occurs  within  ≤  7  days  after  the  last  dose  of  systemic  steroids  (oral, 
intramuscular,  IV)  prescribed  for  a  prior  asthma  exacerbation,  will  be  counted  as  the  same  asthma 
exacerbation event. 
Events  that  the  investigator  believed  were  exacerbations,  but  are  not  supported  by  any  specified 
objective assessment in the eCRF were reviewed by an independent external adjudication committee to 
determine if they were a medically valid asthma exacerbation.

Analysis Populations 
Analysis of primary endpoint – Annualised asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) over 52 weeks 
The AAER was presented as a weighted mean (total number of exacerbations for the treatment group 
divided by the total duration of person follow-up). 
The primary analysis conducted was based on the ITT population using a negative binomial regression 
model with treatment group, baseline  blood eosinophil count (≥ or < 250 cells/μL), and baseline ICS 
dose level (medium or high) as covariates. 
Exacerbation rates, 90% and 95% CIs of exacerbation rates, estimated treatment effects (i.e. the rate 
ratios of each tezepelumab group versus placebo), corresponding 90% and 95% CIs of the rate ratios, 
and 2-sided p-values for the rate ratios were provided based on a negative binomial regression model. 
As a sensitivity analysis, the AAER were assessed by a Poisson regression model to assess the robustness 
with regard to the distributional assumptions. In a Poisson regression model, the correction for potential 
over-dispersion was made by Pearson chi-square method. The same covariates used for the negative 
binomial regression model were considered. 
The primary analysis was repeated based on the PP population at following time points: Week 14, Week 
28, Week 40, Week 52, and Week 60. No missing data were imputed for the primary endpoint. 
Analysis of ranked secondary endpoints  
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 81/215 
 
 
 
 
 
No secondary endpoints were included in the confirmatory testing strategy for the PATHWAY study. 
Nominal  p-values  were  provided  for  the  selected  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  without  multiplicity 
adjustment and corresponding 95% CIs. For the continuous variables in the secondary efficacy analyses, 
the null hypothesis was that there was no difference in change from baseline between each tezepelumab 
and placebo group at Week 52. 
Subgroup Analyses 
Two types of subgroup analyses were conducted; 1) to explore the internal consistency of the detected 
overall  treatment  effect  on  the  primary  efficacy  variable;  2)  to  explore  a  treatment  effect  in  the  pre-
specified subpopulation of asthma on the primary efficacy variable and two other secondary endpoints. 
For the first subgroup analysis, the primary analysis of primary endpoint was repeated for the following 
subgroup populations of interest: 
•  Gender: male versus female. 
•  Race: white versus non-white. 
•  Maintenance OCS use at screening: presence versus absence. 
• 
FeNO: ≥ 24 ppb versus < 24 ppb (Dweik et al, 2011; Hanania et al, 2013). 
•  Number of prior asthma exacerbations in the past year: 2 versus ≥ 3. 
•  Geographical region: North America/Western EU versus rest of the world. 
The  primary  analysis  of  primary  endpoint  was  also  repeated  for  the  following  pre-specified 
subpopulations of asthma: 
•  Eosinophilic/non-eosinophilic: ≥ 250 cells/μL versus < 250 cells/μL. 
• 
• 
• 
Th2 high/low (Corren et al, 2011): high – IgE > 100 IU/mL AND blood eosinophil count ≥ 140 
cells/μL, versus low – IgE ≤ 100 IU/mL OR blood eosinophil count < 140 cells/μL). 
FeNO high/low: ≥ median versus < median. 
Periostin high/low: ≥ median versus < median. 
•  Current post-BD FEV1 reversibility: yes – post-BD change in FEV1 of ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL at 
one of the screening visits (Visit 1 [Week -5], Visit 2 [Week -4], or Visit 3 [Week -1]). 
•  Allergic and non-allergic asthma: allergic – any of specific IgE panel items is positive in FEIA IgE 
data. 
•  Study sites: non-Japanese versus Japanese. 
• 
ICS dose level: medium versus high. 
•  No  chronic  OCS  use  and  current  post-BD  FEV1  reversibility:  yes  –  maintenance  OCS  use  at 
screening = absence AND current post-BD FEV1 reversibility = yes. 
In addition, a non-prespecified blood eosinophil cut-off of ≥ 300 cells/μL versus < 300 cells/μL was used 
for subgroup analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Type I error rate control 
Only the primary endpoint was under type I error control in this study. The primary endpoint was tested 
using a stepdown method for 3 hypotheses (from the high dose (280 mg Q2W) to the medium dose (210 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 82/215 
 
 
 
mg Q4W) to the low dose (70 mg Q4W) when compared with placebo) to maintain the overall type I 
error rate at the 10% level (two sided).  
No multiplicity adjustment was applied for secondary endpoints or subgroup analyses of the primary and 
secondary endpoints. 
Interim analyses 
An unblinded interim analysis was conducted after all subjects had completed the Week 28 visit. All data 
available at that time was analysed as part of the interim analysis. The objective of this interim analysis 
was to accelerate decisions on future development options for tezepelumab. 
Regardless  of  the  interim  analysis  results,  the  study  was  continued  and  completed.  As  a  result,  the 
applicant stated that no alpha was spent at the interim analysis. The details of the interim analysis were 
specified in the interim unblinding analysis plan, which included details of the analysis, scope of data to 
be  included,  independent  and  limited  personnel  who  will  be  unblinded,  and  specific  details  around 
decision rules.  
At the interim analysis, there was only one possible decision that could be made, which was whether or 
not  to  accelerate  the  initiation  of  the End-of-Phase  2  meetings  and  phase  3  preparations  carried  out. 
AER and FEV1 were the key endpoints in the Go/no-go decision framework, while AQLQ and ACQ were 
utilised as important supportive endpoints. 
Results  
• 
Participant flow  
A  total  of  918  subjects  participated  in  the  study  from  19  December  2013  (date  first  subject  signed 
informed consent) to 01 March 2017 (last subject last visit); 334 subjects were considered screen failures 
and 584 subjects were randomised at 98 sites from 12 countries (US, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Israel, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Serbia, South Africa, and Ukraine). Of the total 584 subjects, 
565  subjects  (96.7%)  were  enrolled  at  sites  outside  of  Japan  (non-Japanese  subjects)  due  to  slow 
enrollment at the Japanese sites. 
The 550 randomised subjects comprised 138 subjects each in 70 mg Q4W and placebo groups, and 137 
subjects each in 210 mg Q4W and 280 mg Q2W tezepelumab groups. 
While at least 85% of subjects in each treatment group completed treatment as planned, at least 80% 
of subjects in each treatment group completed the study (completed Week 64 visit) as planned.

Conduct of the study 
 The original protocol was dated 25 July 2013.  
Three amendments were made, the most substantial was the first amendment. The changes included 
updates to the protocol from completed study 20101183. To allow more than 50% of currently reversible 
subjects to be enrolled into the study, which would represent more than half of the study population as 
defined by Inclusion Criterion #4. To allow subjects with severe exacerbations resulting in hospitalisation 
to participate in the study and ensure enrolling the most severe subjects, and to clarify what qualified 
as an asthma event. Enrolment for previous smokers, changes to the Inclusion/exclusion criteria removal 
of redundant text or for consistency. To provide additional clarification regarding the need and reason to 
rapidly report AESIs of anaphylaxis, immune complex disease, and malignancy as SAEs.  
Amendments 2 and 3 were changes to the medical monitor for the study. 
The majority of deviations listed on the protocol deviations log were related to criteria for visit schedules, 
study  procedures,  inclusion/exclusion,  laboratory  assessments,  TESAE  criteria,  randomization,  and 
investigational product compliance.  
1 site  was excluded from all analyses due to GCP non-compliance making the total number of subjects 
analysed to 550 at 97 sites. Interim data revealed that 51 subjects at 14 sites had inconsistent PK data 
(the interim data analysis included data from site). 
A PK profile was considered anomalous, relative to expectation, if the tezepelumab concentration at any 
time point was substantially above LLOQ for subjects randomized to the placebo group (13 subjects), or 
subject had the tezepelumab concentration below the limit of quantitation at all time points post-first-
dose or subject had an inconsistent PK profile for subjects randomized to one of the 3 active treatment 
groups (38 subjects). The root cause of these PK anomalies has not been identified. 
The findings of a thorough investigation have led the sponsor to believe that the site did not comply with 
the principles of GCP. As a result, all data from the site have been excluded, (including safety data as 
162  of  166  post-baseline  PK  samples  from  site  subjects,  randomized  to  the  tezepelumab  treatment 
groups, did not have quantifiable levels of tezepelumab). However specific protocol deviations at the site 
underlying the findings could not be identified; therefore non-compliance. The exclusion of data did not 
change any conclusion, other than minor changes to quantitative values. 
A post-hoc sensitivity analysis excluding these subjects (38 subjects in the active treatment arms and 
13 subjects in placebo arm) was performed for the primary and selected secondary endpoints.

The mean age of the subject population was 51.55 years (range 20.0 to 75.0 years). Approximately two 
thirds of the population was female. The majority of subjects were White and Not Hispanic or Latino. The 
body mass index ranged from 18 to 44.4 kg/m2. 
Baseline  demographic  characteristics  were  generally  similar  between  the  placebo  and  tezepelumab 
groups.

Baseline Disease Characteristics 
Of the 550 subjects, 56.4% of the total subjects were randomised in the high blood eosinophil stratum 
(≥ 250 cells/μL), and 48.9% of the subjects were in high-dose ICS stratum. 
More than 50% of subjects overall had allergic asthma and approximately 50% of subjects had a status 
of Th2-high. The majority of subjects were not using maintenance OCS (90.7%). 
Baseline disease characteristics for spirometry measures (pre-BD FEV1, pre-BD FEV1 % predicted), % 
FEV1 reversibility, OCS use, and ACQ-6 and AQLQ(S)+12 were generally similar between the placebo 
and the tezepelumab groups. 
Asthma History 
Asthma history in the ITT population was generally similar between the placebo and tezepelumab groups. 
Nearly one fifth of subjects (18.7%) reported having had childhood asthma, with a median age of onset 
of 6.0 years.  
The median age of adult asthma onset was 40.0 years.  
A similar distribution of asthma exacerbations was seen in the placebo and the tezepelumab groups, with 
>70% of subjects having 2 exacerbations in the prior year. More than three quarters of subjects had not 
visited the emergency department, due to an asthma exacerbation, in the 12 months before screening. 
More than 50% of subjects experienced >2 night time awakenings per week. Over one-third of subjects 
used SABA every day.  
Overall,  38.7%  of  subjects  had  a  history  of  seasonal  allergies,  39.5%  of  subjects  had  a  history  of 
perennial allergies, 50.7% of subjects had a history of rhinitis, 14.9% of subjects had a history of nasal 
polyps,  and  8.9%  of  subjects  had  a  history  of  eczema  or  atopic  dermatitis.  Most  subjects  had  never 
smoked cigarettes (81.3%). 
ICS and OCS Use at Baseline 
All 550 subjects (100%) in the ITT population were using at least one ICS medication at baseline as per 
the study inclusion criteria. ICS use was generally similar between the placebo and tezepelumab groups. 
The most common ICS (≥ 20% of subjects in any treatment group) used at baseline were budesonide 
and fluticasone. 
The median ICS dose (fluticasone equivalent) was 500 μg/day in all treatment groups.

Outcomes and estimation 
The  primary  endpoint  of  the  annualized  AER  measured  at  Week  52  was  met.  Statistically  significant 
annualized asthma exacerbation rate reduction (AERR) of 62%, 71%, and 66% for the 70 mg Q4W, 210 
mg Q4W, and 280 mg Q2W tezepelumab groups, respectively, compared with placebo were observed in 
the ITT population (p < 0.001) at week 52. Numerically higher reductions in AER were observed at the 
2 higher doses of tezepelumab compared with the 70 mg Q4W dose. As previously described, time at 
risk for this analysis was defined as the total follow-up time.

280 mg Q2W tezepelumab groups, respectively, compared with placebo (31.2%); no subjects in either 
of the 3 tezepelumab dose groups experienced > 3 exacerbations through Week 52. There was an overall 
reduction  in  the  cumulative  number  of  asthma  exacerbations  over  time  in  the  3  tezepelumab  groups 
compared with placebo.

Effect of tezepelumab on the annualised severe asthma exacerbation rate 
A severe asthma exacerbation was defined as an event that resulted in hospitalization (admission to the 
hospital for at least 24 hours). Reductions of 74%, 86%, and 74% in the severe AER were observed with 
70 mg Q4W, 210 mg Q4W, and 280 mg Q2W tezepelumab groups, respectively, compared with placebo 
at Week 52 with the greatest reduction observed with the 210 mg Q4W dose through Week 52.

Effect of tezepelumab on patient reported outcomes 
ACQ-6 
The ACQ-6 was completed Q2W using an ePRO device during the treatment period. The changes from 
baseline in the mean ACQ-6 score were evaluated over time. For the Week 52 visit, the ePRO device had 
to be manually triggered; however, many study sites did not perform this function, which resulted in 
considerably  fewer  subjects  completing  the  questionnaire  at  the  Week  52  visit.  Improvements  from 
baseline  in  the  mean  ACQ-6  score  were  observed  at  all  3  tezepelumab  doses  compared  with  placebo 
with numerically greater improvements observed at the 2 higher doses at both Week 50 and Week 52 
(p < 0.05). 
A  greater  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  tezepelumab  groups  overall  (76.9%  total)  achieved  clinically 
meaningful improvements of ≥ 0.5 from baseline in ACQ-6 compared with placebo (63.4%; p = 0.002) 
at  Week  52  (LOCF),  and  these  improvements  appeared  to  be  dose-dependent.  Furthermore,  a 
numerically greater proportion of subjects in the tezepelumab groups overall were either well-controlled 
(mean ACQ-6 score ≤ 0.75) or achieved partial control of asthma symptoms (mean ACQ-6 score > 0.75 
and  <  1.5)  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (p  =  0.006)  at  Week  52  (LOCF).  Similar  results  were 
observed when the data were analysed without LOCF at Week 52. 
AQLQ(S)+12  
A  greater  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  tezepelumab  groups  overall  (74.7%  total)  achieved  clinically 
meaningful  improvements  of  ≥  0.5  from  baseline  in  the  AQLQ(S)+12  score  compared  with  placebo 
(61.7%; p = 0.007) at Week 52 (LOCF). 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022

Tezepelumab treatment at all 3 doses also resulted in large improvements of ≥ 1.5 from baseline in the 
AQLQ(S)+12  score  compared  with  placebo  (36.3%  in  the  total  tezepelumab  group  vs  25.8%  in  the 
placebo  group;  p  =  0.041)  at  Week  52  (LOCF).  Similar  results  were  observed  when  the  data  were 
analysed without LOCF at Week 52. 
Asthma Symptoms Daily Diary 
Improvements from baseline in the overall asthma symptom score were noted in all 3 tezepelumab dose 
groups compared with placebo with numerically greater improvements observed with the 210 mg Q4W 
and 280 mg Q2W doses.

NAVIGATOR (D5180C00007) (pivotal study) 
A phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of tezepelumab 210 mg every 4 weeks 
(Q4W)  administered  subcutaneously  (SC)  in  adult  and  adolescent  subjects  aged  12  to  80  years  with 
inadequately controlled asthma, with a 52-week treatment period (N = 1061 randomised, 1059 treated). 
Methods 
This  was  a  Phase  3  multicentre,  global,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel  group 
study  designed  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  210  mg  of  tezepelumab  administered  Q4W  SC  in  adult  and 
adolescent subjects with severe, uncontrolled asthma. 
The study planned to randomise 1060 subjects globally in a 1:1 ratio to either tezepelumab or placebo.  
A total of 1061 subjects  were randomised, including a total of 82 adolescent subjects, aged 12 to 17 
years.  
The randomisation was stratified by region and age (adult/adolescents). 
All subjects had to be on medium- to high-dose ICS for at least 12 months prior to screening and have 
documented treatment with ≥ 500 μg fluticasone propionate or equivalent for at least 3 months prior to 
screening. Subjects had to be on at least one asthma controller medication with or without OCS in the 3 
months prior to date of informed consent, as per inclusion criteria 6 and 7. 
The study also aimed to randomise a similar percentage of subjects with < 300 eosinophils/μL and ≥ 
300 eosinophils/μL. In addition, a reasonable number of subjects were expected to be randomised with 
< 150 eosinophils/μL and > 450 eosinophils/μL.  
The  study  consisted  of  a  screening/run-in  period  between  5  and  6  weeks,  a  treatment  period  of  52 
weeks,  and  a  post-treatment  follow-up  period  of  12  weeks.  During  the  treatment  period,  IP  was 
administered starting at Day 0 until Week 48. Investigational product was not administered on Week 52. 
Subjects  who  discontinued  IP  during  the  study  were  encouraged  to  undergo  appropriate  study 
visits/procedures for the full 52-week period.

fluticasone propionate dry powder formulation equivalent total daily dose) for at least 3 months 
prior to Visit 1. The ICS could be contained within an ICS/LABA combination product. 
•  At  least  one  additional  maintenance  asthma  controller  medication  was  required  according  to 
standard  practice  of  care;  eg,  LABA,  LTRA,  theophylline,  long-acting  muscarinic  antagonists 
(LAMA),  cromones,  etc.  Use  of  additional  asthma  controller  medications  must  have  been 
documented for at least 3 months prior to Visit 1. 
•  Morning pre-BD FEV1 < 80% predicted normal (< 90% for subjects 12 to 17 years of age) at 
either Visit 2 or Visit 2a. 
•  Documented history of at least 2 asthma exacerbation events within 12 months prior to Visit 1. 
These could be as follows: 
a.  An asthma exacerbation, defined as a worsening of asthma that required treatment with 
systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 consecutive days (a single depo-injectable dose of 
corticosteroids was considered equivalent to a 3-day course of systemic corticosteroids). 
OR 
b.  An ER visit (defined as evaluation and treatment for < 24 hours in an ER or urgent care 
centre) that required systemic corticosteroids (as per above). 
OR 
c.  An inpatient hospitalisation due to asthma (defined as admission to an inpatient facility 
and/or evaluation and treatment in a healthcare facility for ≥ 24 hours). 
NOTE: For subjects who were receiving a stable maintenance dose of OCS, a temporary increase

for at least 3 consecutive days over and above the stable, existing maintenance dose qualified 
as an exacerbation. 
The  following  defined  what  was  acceptable  to  document  with  regard  to  exacerbations  in  this 
programme: 
d.  Discharge  summaries  from  a  hospital,  ER,  or  an  urgent  care  facility,  indicating  that  a 
subject was hospitalised/treated with systemic steroids for an asthma exacerbation. 
NOTE: Terminology to describe ER/department and urgent care visits may differ between 
countries. All such visits have been captured as ER visits. 
e.  Signed  and  dated  notes  from  a  referring  physician,  including  information  regarding 
diagnosis and treatment of an exacerbation with systemic steroids. 
f.  Subjects  could  provide  evidence  of  prescriptions  for  systemic  steroids  used  during  an 
exacerbation. 
g.  A  documented  conversation  that  is  recorded  in  a  timely  manner  between  the 
Investigator/nurse or nurse practitioner and a subject who is already on an OCS action 
plan, detailing the diagnosis and treatment of an asthma exacerbation. 
h.  A  documented  conversation  between  the  treating/referral  physician  or  nurse/nurse 
practitioner  certifying  that  a  subject  was  treated  for  an  exacerbation  with  steroids  at 
their clinic or under their supervision. The dates (month/year) of the exacerbations and 
verbal  confirmation  that  appropriate  prescriptions  were  provided  was  necessary.  This 
option was to be used only if reasonable attempts to procure subject records had been 
unsuccessful.

•  Treatments 
Investigational medicinal products 
Each patient randomised into the study received either Tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W or Placebo Q4W. 
Table 32: Identity of Investigational Products 
Background medications 
In line with the inclusion criteria all patients had to be on medium- to high-dose ICS + one additional 
controller medication with or without OCS. No changes in either dose or regimen to background asthma 
medications were allowed during the study (V1 and throughout the IP treatment and preferably 4 weeks 
after the last dose of IP) except to treat an exacerbation. Restrictions of maintenance controllers included 
limits on use of LABA, LAMA, LTRA, and theophylline maintenance therapies. 
As theophylline has a narrow therapeutic window, subjects on maintenance treatment with theophylline 
had to have blood concentration levels within the therapeutic range documented before Visit 1. 
Recue medications  
Albuterol (US)/salbutamol (ex US) rescue medication was provided by the sponsor and obtained locally. 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 99/215 
 
 
 
 
Regularly scheduled SABA use in the absence of symptoms was not allowed beginning at enrolment (Visit 
1) and throughout the study. Prophylactic or any other use of SABA (eg, prior to planned exercise) was 
documented in medical notes and entered in the eCRF, but not recorded in the eDiary. 
Rescue  use  of  SABA  via  nebulisation  was  discouraged,  except  as  urgent  treatment  during  an 
exacerbation. Nebuliser administration was recorded separately from metered dose inhaler inhalations 
in the eDiary.

During the study, an asthma exacerbation was defined as a worsening of asthma that led to any of the 
following: 
•  A  temporary  bolus/burst  of  systemic  corticosteroids  (or  a  temporary  increase  in  stable  OCS 
background  dose)  for  at  least  3  consecutive  days  to  treat  symptoms  of  asthma  worsening;  a 
single depo-injectable dose of corticosteroids was considered equivalent to a 3-day bolus/burst 
of systemic corticosteroids. 
•  An ER or urgent care visit (defined as evaluation and treatment for < 24 hours in an emergency 
department or urgent care centre) due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids (as per 
the above). 
NOTE: Terminology to describe ER/emergency department and urgent care visits may differ between 
countries. All such visits have been captured as ER visits. 
•  An inpatient hospitalisation (defined as admission to an inpatient facility and/or evaluation and 
treatment in a healthcare facility for ≥ 24 hours) due to asthma. 
The electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO) device was programmed to alert both the subject 
and  study  centre  when  certain  pre-specified  worsening  thresholds  were  crossed,  as  below.  The 
purpose of the alerts was to trigger a contact between the site and subject for further evaluation, if 
deemed necessary by the Investigator. 
•  Decrease in morning peak flow ≥ 20% on at least 2 consecutive days compared with baseline, 
and/or 
•  An increase in rescue medication use of 4 or more puffs on at least 2 consecutive days compared 
with the average use during baseline or use of 12 puffs/day on any one day, and/or 
•  An additional nebulised β2 agonist use on at least 2 consecutive days compared with the average 
use during baseline, and/or 
If  an  exacerbation  event  was  not  associated  with  deterioration  in  at  least  one  of  the  pre-specified 
objective  measurements,  the  Investigator  had  to  justify  the  decision  for  defining  the  event  as  an 
exacerbation and record it in the eCRF. Events that were not supported by any objective assessment 
were deemed not to be a protocol-defined exacerbation. 
The start of an exacerbation was defined as the start date of systemic corticosteroids or of a temporary 
increase  in  a  stable  OCS  background  dose,  date  of  ER  or  urgent  care  visits  requiring  systemic 
corticosteroids, or date of hospital admission due to asthma, whichever occurred earlier. 
The end date of an exacerbation was defined as the last date of systemic corticosteroids or of a temporary 
increase in a stable OCS background dose, date of ER or urgent care visit, or date of hospital discharge, 
whichever occurred later. 
If fewer than 7 days elapsed since the end date of an asthma exacerbation and the start date of a new 
asthma exacerbation, the second event was considered a relapse of the prior asthma exacerbation. 
•  Sample size 
Approximately  1060  subjects  were  to  be  randomly  assigned  to  study  treatment  using  1:1  allocation 
between tezepelumab and placebo. 
With  530  subjects  per  treatment  group,  it  was  estimated  that,  using  the  multiple  testing  procedure 
described in the protocol, with an overall Type 1 error control at α=0.05 and a Type 1 error control for 
the primary endpoint at α=0.01, the power for the primary and the key secondary endpoints would be 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 103/215 
 
 
 
at least 90%. The Type 1 error control at α=0.01 for the primary endpoint was chosen to further ensure 
statistically persuasive evidence. 
For  the  primary  endpoint,  assuming  a  placebo  rate  of  0.9  per  year,  a  shape  parameter  of  2.4 
(overdispersion), and a dropout rate of 10% (assumed uniform over the study), there was estimated to 
be  at  least  99%  power  to  detect  a  rate  reduction  of  50%  at  a  2-sided  significance  level  of  1%.  The 
methodology  used  was  as  described  in  Keene  et  al.,2007,  and  developed  further  by  Zhu  and  Lakkis, 
2014. The minimum rate reduction that would yield statistical significance with the above assumptions 
is 27%. 
For AAER in subjects with baseline eosinophils < 300/μL, assuming a placebo rate of 0.6 and assuming 
that half of subjects will be in this subgroup (i.e. 265 subjects per treatment group), there was estimated 
to be 94% power to detect a rate reduction of 50% at a 2-sided significance level of 5%, with the same 
shape parameter and dropout assumptions as above. 
For each of the following four key secondary endpoints, change from baseline in pre-BD FEV1, change 
from baseline in AQLQ(S)+12 total score, change from baseline in ACQ-6, and change from baseline in 
weekly  mean  Asthma  Symptom  Diary  score,  the  nominal  power  was  estimated  to  be  95%  or  higher 
(using a nominal 2-sided significance level of 5%), assuming standard deviations of 400 mL and 1.3, 
1.3, and 1.3 units respectively, and true differences of 100 mL and 0.3, 0.3, and 0.3 units respectively. 
The  minimum  detectable  differences,  under  the  above  assumptions,  are  50  mL  for  FEV1,  0.16  for 
AQLQ(S)+12 total score, and -0.16 for each of Asthma Symptom Diary score and ACQ-6 score. 
The above effect size and variability assumptions were taken from the Phase 2b tezepelumab trial as 
reported in Corren et al., 2017.

Statistical Analysis Plan 
The original SAP, dated 28 June 2018, was amended three times. Version 2.0 of the SAP is dated 20 
May 2019; version 3.0 of the SAP is dated 14 September 2020; and version 4.0 of the SAP is dated 22 
October 2020. All amendments were summarised in version 4.0 of the SAP.  
Changes to the statistical analyses resulting from changes in the conduct of the study because of the 
COVID-19 pandemic were described in version 3.0 of the SAP. The start date of the COVID-19 pandemic 
was defined as 11th March 2020; the date the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared it a pandemic. 
Where applicable, data were to be presented prior to the start of the pandemic, and during the pandemic. 
No  post-pandemic  period  was  defined  as  it  was  expected  that  the  majority  of  subjects  would  have 
completed the study before the end date of the pandemic could be defined. 
The date of database lock was 29 October 2020. 
Changes to the planned analyses 
Changes to the planned analyses were summarised by the applicant. The table below indicates when 
any changes were made in relation to the unblinding of the study data.

Analysis Populations 
Enrolled: All subjects who signed the informed consent form. 
Randomised  Subjects  Analysis  Set:  All  subjects  randomised  to  study  treatment  (irrespective  of 
whether treatment is subsequently taken. This analysis set was used for the reporting of disposition. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): All subjects randomised to study treatment who received at least one dose of 
IP, irrespective of their protocol adherence and continued participation in the study. 
Safety  Analysis  Set:  All  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  IP.  Summaries  of  anti-drug 
antibodies  (ADA)  were  also  based  on  the  safety  analysis  set,  using  the  same  approach  to  handle 
treatment dispensing errors. 
PK Analysis Set: All subjects in the full analysis set who received tezepelumab and had at least one 
detectable serum concentration from a PK blood sample collected post first dose, which is assumed not 
to be affected by factors such as protocol deviations. 
Efficacy  analyses  were  performed  using  all  subjects  in  the  FAS,  according  to  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT) 
principle. Subjects were analysed according to their randomised treatment (including in the case of any 
discrepancies between randomised and actual treatment). 
For consistency with efficacy analyses, the demographics and baseline characteristics of subjects were 
summarised using the FAS.

Analysis of primary endpoint – Annualised asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) over 52 weeks 
Definition of time at risk 
For planned treatment analyses, the time at risk was defined as follows: 
If the subject attended Visit 17/EOT Week 52 (expected to be the majority of subjects), then: 
Time at risk (days) = [earliest (Date of Visit 17; date of last exacerbation assessment status from the 
eCRF) – date of randomisation] + 1 
Otherwise, if no Visit 17/EOT Week 52 was available for a subject: 
Time  at  risk  (days)  =  [earliest  (randomisation  date  +  364  days  +  5  days;  date  of  last  exacerbation 
assessment during planned treatment) – date of randomisation] + 1, where: 
Date of last exacerbation assessment during planned treatment = Latest of: 
1. the date of last assessment of exacerbation status from the eCRF. 
2. the date of death 
The number of days the subject experienced a protocol defined exacerbation, including the subsequent 
7 days (when a further exacerbation would not be considered as a second exacerbation), were subtracted 
from  the  time  at  risk  defined  above  for  the  primary  analysis.  For  example,  if  a  subject  has  a  single 
exacerbation which lasted 4 days then 7 + 4 =11 days was subtracted from the time at risk. 
It should be noted that the date of last assessment of exacerbation status from the eCRF might be later 
than the last available visit during the planned treatment period, in the case that the subject remained 
in the study with incomplete follow-up options after early discontinuation of IP. 
For  the  primary  analysis  (planned  treatment),  exacerbations  that  occurred  after  a  subject  has 
discontinued IP but before the end of the time at risk were still accounted when deriving the total number 
of exacerbations. Likewise, the time at risk reflected the time at risk regardless of whether the subject 
was still on IP or not. 
Any exacerbations that started within the time at risk but ended after this time point were included in 
analyses with the end date adjusted to be no later than the time at risk. Any exacerbation that started 
after this time were not included in analyses. 
Main analysis 
The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (AAER over 52 weeks) quantified the effect of the 
initially randomised treatment, regardless of the treatments that subjects actually received, or whether 
the subjects received other controller therapy/rescue medications post IP discontinuation. 
This  analysis  thus  used  a  treatment  policy  strategy  and  included  all  available  data  after  treatment 
discontinuation until the end of the planned treatment period. 
Subjects were encouraged to continue to undergo applicable study related visits/procedures for the full 
52-week  period  even  after  premature  discontinuation  of  IP.  Consequently,  subjects  lost  to  follow-up, 
subjects  who  died  and  subjects  who  withdrew  their  consent  should  be  the  only  source  of  missing 
information for the primary analysis. 
Missing data from early study withdrawal was modelled based on what was observed during the study 
using direct likelihood approaches, which is a valid approach under the assumption that data are missing 
at random (MAR). 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 106/215 
 
 
 
AAER  in  the  tezepelumab  group  was  compared  to  that  seen  in  the  placebo  group  using  a  negative 
binomial  model.  This  model  was  used  to  perform  statistical  hypothesis  testing  and  to  estimate  the 
treatment effect and both its 99% and 95% confidence intervals. 
The response variable in the model was the number of asthma exacerbations experienced by a subject 
over the 52-week planned treatment period (or shorter duration if not followed up for the full 52 weeks). 
Treatment, region, age (adolescents or adults) and history of exacerbations (<=2 or >2 in previous 12 
months) will be included as factors in this model. Any subject who was incorrectly randomised with a 
history of fewer than 2 exacerbations was included in the primary analysis. The logarithm of the time at 
risk (in years) for exacerbation was used as an offset variable in the model, to adjust for subjects having 
different follow-up times during which the events occur. As above, time during an exacerbation and the 
7 days following an exacerbation in which a new exacerbation cannot occur, were not included in the 
calculation of time at risk for exacerbation. 
Descriptive summaries of the asthma exacerbations were also presented. Unadjusted exacerbation rates 
were  summarised  using  an  approach  weighted  by  subject’s  time  at  risk  (i.e.  the  total  number  of 
exacerbations for each treatment divided by the total time at risk for that treatment). 
Adjusted (model-based) exacerbation rates were presented using the marginal rates approach described 
in Bartlett (2018). 
Sensitivity analyses 
A number of sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint under various alternative assumptions about 
the missing data mechanism were also presented by the applicant. These included reference-based and 
tipping point multiple imputation analyses.  
Supplementary analyses 
The primary analysis was repeated using on-treatment data only, defined as any efficacy assessment 
date which occurs between the date of randomisation and minimum (date of last dose of IP + 33 days, 
date of death, date of study withdrawal). 
Supporting analyses 
Annualised  rates  for  those  exacerbations  due  to  ER  visits  or  hospitalisations  were  summarised 
descriptively and analysed using a similar model as for the primary analysis. 
Annualised exacerbation rates which consider adjudicated outcomes were also analysed similarly to the 
primary  analysis.  The  analysis  which  considers  adjudicated  outcomes  was  also  performed  for  the 
exacerbations due to ER visits or hospitalisations and exacerbations due to hospitalisations. 
Annualised rate for those exacerbations due to hospitalisations only was summarised descriptively and 
analysed using a similar model as for the primary analysis. 
These supporting analyses were performed using the treatment policy strategy only. 
Analysis  of  the  time  to  first  exacerbation  was  defined  as  a  secondary  endpoint  not  included  in  the 
confirmatory testing strategy. 
Additional analyses relating to the COVID-19 pandemic 
An additional analysis of the primary endpoint (AAER) was performed based on the hypothetical scenario 
that the COVID-19 pandemic did not occur. This approach assumed that the response for subjects whose 
participation during the planned treatment period was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic is different 
from those subjects who were not impacted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 107/215 
 
 
 
A hypothetical strategy was used which included all available data during the planned treatment period 
prior to 11th March 2020 (date the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic). 
The time at risk for this analysis was defined as follows: 
If the subject attended Visit 17/EOT Week 52 (expected to be the majority of subjects), then: 
Time at risk (days) = [earliest (Date of Visit 17; date of last exacerbation assessment status from the 
eCRF; 10th March 2020) – date of randomisation] + 1 
Otherwise, if no Visit 17/EOT Week 52 is available for a subject: 
Time  at  risk  (days)  =  [earliest  (randomisation  date  +  364  days  +  5  days;  date  of  last  exacerbation 
assessment during planned treatment; 10th March 2020) – date of randomisation] + 1, where: 
Date of last exacerbation assessment during planned treatment = Latest of: 
1. the date of last assessment of exacerbation status from the eCRF. 
2. the date of death 
The number of days the subject experienced a protocol defined exacerbation, including the subsequent 
7 days (when a further exacerbation would not be considered as a second exacerbation), was subtracted 
from the time at risk defined above for the analysis. 
AAER  in  the  tezepelumab  group  was  compared  to  that  seen  in  the  placebo  group  using  a  negative 
binomial model as described for the primary analysis. Results were also included in the forest plot for 
the primary. Descriptive statistics were also presented. 
The  above  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  was  repeated  for  the  eosinophil  subgroup  (<300/μL, 
≥300/μL). 
Analysis of ranked secondary endpoints 
The main analysis of the key secondary endpoints (changes from baseline to Week 52 for each of pre-
bronchodilator FEV1, AQLQ(S)+12 total score, ACQ-6 score and weekly mean ASD score) quantified the 
effect  of  the  initially  randomised  treatment  at  Week  52,  regardless  of  the  treatments  that  subjects 
actually  received,  or  whether  the  subjects  received  other  controller  therapy/rescue  medications, 
including for subjects who discontinued study treatment prior to Week 52. 
This  analysis  thus  used  a  treatment  policy  strategy  and  included  all  available  data  after  treatment 
discontinuation until the end of the planned treatment period. Subjects were encouraged to continue to 
undergo  applicable  study  related  visits/procedures  for  the  full  52-week  period  even  after  premature 
discontinuation of IP. Consequently, subjects lost to follow-up, subjects who died, subjects who withdrew 
their consent and subjects who chose Option 3 for their follow-up should be the only source of missing 
information for the key secondary analyses apart from subjects who chose Option 2 for their follow-up, 
who have missing pre-BD FEV1 following discontinuing of IP until their Week 52 visit. 
Change from baseline for the key secondary endpoints in the tezepelumab group were compared to that 
seen in the placebo group using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) model, a direct likelihood 
approach valid under the assumption that the data are missing at random (MAR). This model was used 
to perform the statistical hypothesis testing, and to estimate the treatment effect at Week 52 and its 
95% confidence interval, for each endpoint. 
The response variable in the model was change from baseline at each scheduled post-randomisation visit 
up to and including Week 52, and irrespective of whether the subject remained on treatment and/or took 
other treatments. Treatment, visit, region, age (adolescents or adults) and treatment by visit interaction 
will be included as factors in this model. The baseline measure of the corresponding endpoint was also 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 108/215 
 
 
 
included in the model as a continuous linear covariate. A Baseline-by-visit interaction was not included 
as a covariate in the MMRM model. 
Unstructured  covariance  was  assumed  to  model  the  relationship  between  pairs  of  response  variables 
taken  at  different  visits  on  the  same  subject.  The  Kenward-Roger  approximation  to  estimating  the 
degrees of freedom was used for tests of fixed effects derived from the MMRM model. 
To allow for the possibility that the MMRM model failed to converge with unstructured covariance, the 
following hierarchical approach was proposed to select a simpler covariance structure if the preceding 
covariance structure fails to converge: Unstructured → Heterogeneous Toeplitz → Heterogeneous First 
Order  Autoregressive  →  Toeplitz  →  First  Order  Autoregressive  →  Compound  Symmetry.  Before 
concluding non-convergence at any step of this hierarchy, an attempt was first to be made to resolve 
convergence  problems  by using  different  starting  values  of  the underlying  algorithm  and/or  adjusting 
singularity options. The First Order Autoregressive covariance structure was used for the weekly mean 
ASD  endpoint;  unstructured  covariance  was  used  for  the  pre-bronchodilator  FEV1,  AQLQ(S)+12  total 
score and ACQ-6 score endpoints. 
For the ASD endpoint, each of the 52 weeks used for weekly mean calculation replaced visit in the above 
model specification. 
Descriptive summaries of the key secondary endpoints were also presented. Adjusted means from the 
MMRM model above were displayed graphically over time and used to evaluate time of onset of effect. 
Adjusted  means  were  calculated  from  the  MMRM  using  the  observed  margins  approach,  in  which  the 
contribution of model factors to the estimate was weighted proportionally to the presence of these factors 
in the data. 
Sensitivity analyses 
A  number  of  sensitivity  analyses  for  the  secondary  endpoints  under  various  alternative  assumptions 
about  the  missing  data  mechanism  were  also  presented  by  the  applicant.  These  included  reference-
based and tipping point multiple imputation analyses. 
Supplementary analyses 
The above main analyses of the key secondary endpoints were repeated using on-treatment data only, 
defined as any efficacy assessment date which occurs between the date of randomisation and minimum 
(date of last dose of IP + 33 days, date of death, date of study withdrawal). 
Additional analyses relating to the COVID-19 pandemic 
Additional analyses of the key secondary endpoints were performed based on the hypothetical scenario 
that the COVID-19 pandemic did not occur. A hypothetical strategy was used which included all available 
data during the planned treatment period prior to 11th March 2020. Any data available on or after 11th 
March 2020 was set to missing in these analyses. 
Change from baseline for the key secondary endpoints in the tezepelumab group will be compared to 
that seen in the placebo group using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) model as described 
for the main analyses of these endpoints. 
The  response  variable  in  the  model  was  change  from  baseline  at  each  scheduled  post-randomisation 
visit. The same covariance structure was used for the additional analyses as for the main analyses of 
these endpoints. 
Adjusted means from the MMRM model above were displayed graphically over time and included in the 
same figure as the main analyses results. 
The above analysis of each key secondary endpoint was repeated for the eosinophil subgroup (<300/μL, 
Assessment report

≥300/μL). 
Subgroup analyses 
Descriptive summaries of the primary and key secondary endpoints by treatment group were produced 
for each of the following categorical variables: 
•  Baseline eosinophils group: <300/μL, ≥300/μL 
•  Baseline eosinophils group: <150/μL, ≥150/μL 
•  Baseline eosinophils group: <150/μL, ≥ 150/μL to < 300/μL, ≥ 300/μL to <450/μL, ≥ 450/μL 
•  Baseline clinic visit FENO group: < 25ppb, ≥ 25ppb 
•  Baseline clinic visit FENO group: <25ppb, 25 to <50ppb, ≥50ppb 
•  Baseline  perennial  specific  IgE  status  (FEIA):  Any  perennial  FEIA  positive,  All  perennial  FEIA 
negative, Unknown perennial FEIA 
• 
ICS dose at study entry: medium, high 
•  Age category: adults (≥65), adults (≥18 to <65) and adolescents (≥12 to <18) 
•  Gender: Male, Female 
•  Race: White, Black or African American, Asian, Other 
•  Exacerbations in the year before study: ≤2 exacerbations, >2 exacerbations 
•  OCS at baseline: present, absent 
•  Baseline body mass index (BMI): <18.5 kg/m2, 18.5-<25.0 kg/m2, 25.0-<30.0 kg/m2, ≥30.0 
kg/m2 
•  Geographical region: Asia Pacific, North America, South America, Central/Eastern 
•  Europe, Western Europe plus Australia, Rest of World 
•  Nasal polyps in the 2 years before randomisation: Yes, No 
For the primary endpoint, a similar negative binomial model was fitted as for the primary analysis for 
each of the above variables in turn, with additional factors for the subgroup variable and the treatment 
by subgroup interaction.  
For the key secondary endpoints, a similar MMRM model was fitted as for the key secondary endpoints 
for  each  of  the  above  variables  in  turn,  with  additional  factors  for  the  subgroup  variable  (where  not 
already included) and the treatment by visit by subgroup interaction (as well as lower order interaction 
terms including these factors). 
For each endpoint, the relevant model was used to estimate the treatment effect and its 95% CI within 
each of the subgroup categories, which was tabulated and also summarised graphically using a forest 
plot. The overall treatment effect was displayed on the forest plots. 
For age, the above categorisation replaced the one used in the primary analysis model. 
The categorical subgroup analysis above was also repeated using the four (mutually exclusive) categories 
defined by the quartiles of each baseline biomarker. 
A p-value for the treatment by subgroup interaction was not presented for any of these models due to 
the various difficulties in interpretation, which arise from both low power and an inflated chance of false 
positive findings. 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 110/215 
 
 
 
The probability of a chance finding for the primary endpoint was assessed using a standardised effect 
plot.  This  plot  presents  the  estimated  effects  for  each  subgroup  category  (estimated  from  the  above 
models and ordered from largest to smallest), for all subgroup variables together as listed above, along 
with reference lines for what would be expected for the most extreme observations by chance (when 
there was no treatment by subgroup interaction), as taken from a permutation distribution. Observed 
values falling outside of these reference lines were to be investigated further in terms of the plausibility 
and  causes  of  such  an  effect.  Further  graphical  analysis  may  be  performed  to  aid  interpretation  if 
necessary. 
The standardised effect plot was produced separately for: 
•  Subgroups defined using pre-specified categories (biomarkers of interest and other exploratory 
variables on the same plot) 
•  Subgroups defined using quartiles of the baseline data (biomarkers of interest only). 
Type I error control 
The overall type 1 error rate was to be strongly controlled at the 0.05 level across the primary and key 
secondary endpoints. The primary endpoint (in all subjects) was tested at the 0.01 level to further ensure 
statistically persuasive evidence. If the primary analysis of AAER in all subjects observes p ≤ 0.01, the 
trial was to be declared successful. In order to assess the primary objective of effect across the all-comer 
population,  the  subgroup  of  subjects  with  baseline  eosinophils  <  300/μL  was  added  into  the  multiple 
testing procedure following direction from the FDA. 
The following hierarchical testing strategy was applied, ordered by clinical relevance: 
Level 1 
The  null  hypothesis  H01  was  to  be  tested  at  a  2-sided  1%  significance  level  regarding  the  primary 
endpoint (AAER) in all subjects. 
Level 2 
If H01 was rejected at the 2-sided 1% significance level, then the null hypothesis H02 was to be tested 
at a 2-sided 5% significance level regarding the AAER in subjects with baseline eosinophils < 300/μL. 
Level 3 
If H02 was rejected at the 2-sided 5% significance level, then the null hypothesis H03 was to be tested 
at a 2-sided 5% significance level regarding change from baseline in pre-BD FEV1. 
Level 4 
If H03 was rejected at the 2-sided 5% significance level, then the null hypotheses H04a and H04b were 
to be simultaneously tested at an overall 2-sided 5% significance level regarding: 
• 
• 
change from baseline in AQLQ(S)+12 total score 
change from baseline in ACQ-6 score 
using a truncated Hochberg approach. In general, under this approach, the higher of the two ordered p-
values within Level 4 would be evaluated at a γα + (1-γ)α/2 significance level (2-sided), and the lower 
of the 2 ordered p-values within Level 4 would be evaluated at a γα/2 + (1-γ)α/2 significance level (2-
sided), where α = 0.05, and where γ is the truncation parameter (0 ≤ γ ≤ 1). 
It is noted an intermediate choice 0 < γ < 1 of the truncation parameter represents a choice between 
these  extremes  of  regular  Hochberg  (corresponding  to  γ  =  1)  and  Bonferroni  approaches  (γ  =  0), 
balancing  considerations  of  how  stringent  hypothesis  testing  should  be  in  Level  4  in  order  to  claim 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 111/215 
 
 
 
significance, versus the ability to subsequently claim significance from formal hypothesis testing in Level 
5. In this trial γ will be set to 0.5. 
Using this choice of truncation parameter, the higher of the two Level 4 p-values was to be evaluated at 
a 3.75% significance level (2-sided). If it was significant at the 3.75% level, then both hypotheses H04a 
and H04b would be rejected, and testing would proceed to Level 5. If it was not significant at the 3.75% 
level, then the lower of the 2 Level 4 p-values would be evaluated at a 2.5% significance level (2-sided). 
If  it  was  significant,  then  the  relevant  null  hypothesis  (either  H04a  or  H04b)  would  be  rejected,  and 
testing would proceed to Level 5. If it was (also) not significant, then formal testing would stop at Level 
4.  The  significance  levels  for  subsequent  evaluation  in  Level  5  for  each  of  these  scenarios  are  given 
below. 
Level 5 
The null hypothesis H05 was to be tested at the significance level retained from Level 4, which depends 
on the outcomes in Level 4 as follows: 
•  Case  1:  If  both  comparisons  in  Level  4  exhibited  statistical  significance,  then  H05  was  to  be 
tested at a 2-sided 5% significance level with regard to change from baseline in weekly mean 
ASD score. 
1.  Case 2: If only one of the comparisons in Level 4 exhibits statistical significance, then H05 
was to be tested at the 2-sided significance level α – [γα + (1-γ)α/2] retained from Level 4, 
where α = 0.05. 
Using the proposed choice of γ = 0.5, if both H04a and H04b were rejected in Level 4, then H05 in Level 
5 was to be tested at a 2-sided 5% significance level (Case 1). If only one of H04a and H04b was rejected 
in Level 4, then H05 in Level 5 was be tested at a 2-sided 1.25% significance level (Case 2). 
The multiple testing procedure is summarised graphically in the following figure:

Changes in the Conduct of the Study  
The  original  protocol  was  dated  22  September  2017.  There  were  4  protocol  amendments.  The  most 
significant changes are presented in the table below:

Protocol Deviations 
Overall, 195 subjects (18.4% of subjects) had at least one important protocol deviation in the study, 
with 14.8% in the tezepelumab group and 22.0% in the placebo group. 
None of the important protocol deviations were considered to impact the quality of the study and the 
pattern  of  observed  important  protocol  deviations  were  considered  not  to  impact  the  overall 
interpretation  of  results.  All  subjects  with  a  protocol  deviation  were  allowed  to  continue  in  the  study 
unless they were withdrawn for safety reasons. 
The  most  common  important  protocol  deviation  observed  in  both  groups  was  restrictions  during  the 
study (50 [9.5%] subjects in the tezepelumab group and 72 [13.6%] subjects in the placebo group). No 
subjects  developed  discontinuation  criteria  but  continued  to  receive  IP.  No  safety  deviations  were 
reported. 
Cases  in  which  the  Investigator  changed  or  discontinued  background  medications  were  considered 
important  protocol  deviations.  A  total  of  88  (8.3%)  subjects  reported  a  change  in  background 
medications.

randomised in South America. 
In the adolescent subgroup, there was an imbalance in the proportion of subjects with blood eosinophil 
levels  <  300  cells/μL  (56.1%  in  the  tezepelumab  group  and  34.1%  in  the  placebo  group),  blood 
eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/μL (43.9% in the tezepelumab group and 65.9% in the placebo group), and < 
150 cells/μL (19.5% in the tezepelumab group and 14.6% in the placebo group). 
There  was  also  an  imbalance  between  treatment  groups  in  FeNO  levels,  ICS  dose,  and  perennial 
aeroallergen-specific IgE results, with 26.8% of subjects with FeNO < 25 ppb in the tezepelumab group 
and 39.0% in the placebo group, 63.4% and 51.2% receiving medium-dose ICS in the tezepelumab and 
placebo groups, respectively, and with 87.8% and 92.7% adolescents being positive for any perennial 
aeroallergen-specific IgE in the tezepelumab and placebo groups, respectively. 
Only one subject in the tezepelumab group and 2 subjects in the placebo group had nasal polyps, and 
one subject in the tezepelumab group was treated with maintenance OCS.

•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint - Annual Asthma Exacerbation Rate Ratio Over 52 Weeks 
Tezepelumab 210 mg SC Q4W treatment resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
reduction  in  the  rate  of  severe  asthma  exacerbations  over  52  weeks  by  56%  compared  with  placebo 
(rate ratio 0.44 [95% CI 0.37, 0.53]; p < 0.001) in the overall population. As previously described, time 
at risk for this analysis was defined as the total duration of time in which a new exacerbation could occur, 
i.e. total follow-up time minus time during exacerbation and 7 days after.

Binomial Model, Planned Treatment (Full Analysis Set) 
A post-hoc re-analysis of the primary endpoint in which time at risk was defined as the total follow-up 
time  was  provided  during  the  assessment.  Results  were  consistent  with  the  pre-specified  primary 
analysis: Tezepelumab 210 mg SC Q4W treatment reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations over 52 
weeks by 51% compared with placebo (rate ratio 0.49 [95% CI 0.41, 0.58]) in the overall population.   
Sensitivity Analyses 
Multiple imputation methods exploring the effect of missing data on the reliability of the results did not 
impact any conclusions from the primary analyses.

Proportion of Subjects Experiencing No Asthma Exacerbations Over 52 Weeks 
The proportion of subjects who were followed for 52 weeks and experienced no asthma exacerbations 
was higher in the tezepelumab group (54.2%) compared with the placebo group in the overall population 
(38.6%) (odds ratio [OR]: 1.93 [95% CI 1.51, 2.47]).

Key secondary endpoints 
Pulmonary Function: Pre-Bronchodilator FEV1 
Subjects  receiving  tezepelumab  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful 
improvement  from  baseline  in  pre-BD  FEV1  compared  with  placebo  at  52  weeks  (0.23  L  vs  0.10  L, 
difference 0.13 L [95% CI 0.08, 0.18]; p < 0.001). 
Onset of effect in FEV1 was seen at the first post-baseline assessment at 2 weeks and was maintained 
over 52 weeks. 
Sensitivity Analyses 
Multiple imputation methods exploring the effect of missing data on the reliability of the results did not 
impact any conclusions from the main analyses of FEV1.  
Standardised Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for 12 Years and Older 
Tezepelumab  treatment  resulted  in  clinically  meaningful  improvements  from  baseline  in  AQLQ(S)+12 
and  a  statistically  significant  improvement  compared  with  placebo  (1.48  vs  1.14  in  tezepelumab  vs 
placebo  groups,  respectively,  LSMean  difference  of  0.33  [95%  CI  0.20,  0.47];  p  <  0.001).  An 
improvement from baseline was also observed in the placebo group. 
In the responder analysis, a greater proportion of subjects in the tezepelumab group achieved clinically 
meaningful improvements in the AQLQ(S)+12 score (at least 0.5 units increase from baseline) compared 
with placebo at Week 52 (tezepelumab 77.5% vs placebo 71.7%, OR: 1.36 [95% CI 1.02, 1.82]). 
Improvements in AQLQ(S)+12 were seen as early as 4 weeks after administration, the first time point 
at which AQLQ(S)+12 was assessed and maintained to 52 weeks.

Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 
Tezepelumab  treatment  resulted  in  clinically  meaningful  improvement  from  baseline  and  statistically 
significant  improvement  compared  with  placebo  at  52  weeks  (-1.53  vs  -1.20  in  the  tezepelumab  vs 
placebo groups, difference -0.33 [95% CI -0.46, -0.20]; p < 0.001). 
In the responder analysis, a greater proportion of subjects in the tezepelumab group achieved clinically 
meaningful improvements in the ACQ-6 score (at least 0.5 units reduction from baseline in the ACQ-6 
score) compared with placebo at Week 52 (tezepelumab 86.2% vs placebo 76.5%, OR: 1.99 [95% CI 
1.43, 2.76]).

Asthma Symptom Diary Score: Weekly Mean Daily Score 
Treatment  with  tezepelumab  resulted  in  clinically  meaningful  improvements  from  baseline  and  a 
statistically significant improvement compared with placebo in weekly mean total ASD scores at Week 
52 (LSMean tezepelumab -0.70 vs placebo -0.59, difference of -0.11 [95% CI -0.19, -0.04]; p = 0.004). 
Onset of improvement in ASD was seen as early as one week after first tezepelumab administration and 
was maintained to 52 weeks. 
In the responder analysis, a greater proportion of subjects in the tezepelumab group achieved clinically 
meaningful improvements in the ASD score (at least 0.5 units reduction from baseline in the ASD score) 
compared with placebo at Week 52 (58.0% and 50.1%, respectively). 
A drop off in numbers of subjects completing Asthma Daily Diaries was observed at Week 52 due to the 
requirement that not more than 3 days be missing in each week of the diary. Week 52 visits were allowed 
to be scheduled within a 5-day window, which meant that some subjects did not have a completed diary 
for the final week.

AAER Reduction by Categorical Baseline Biomarkers 
Tezepelumab  treatment  resulted  in  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  reduction  in  the 
AAER in subjects with baseline blood eosinophils < 300 cells/μL by 41% (rate ratio 0.59 [95% CI 0.46,

0.75]; p < 0.001). In subjects with baseline blood eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/μL, AAER was reduced by 70% 
(0.30 [95% CI 0.22, 0.40]). Tezepelumab reduced the AAER in subjects with baseline blood eosinophils 
< 150 cells/μL by 39% (rate ratio 0.61 [95% CI 0.42, 0.88]). Magnitude of benefit with tezepelumab 
increased  with  increasing  levels  of  eosinophils  and  FeNO.  Benefit  from  tezepelumab  treatment  was 
similar in subjects with or without any positive baseline perennial aeroallergen-specific IgE FEIA result.

Across  the  continuum  of  eosinophil  and  FeNO  levels,  a  greater  magnitude  of  treatment  effect  was 
observed with increasing levels of eosinophils and FeNO. Magnitude of the treatment effect was similar 
across the continuum of IgE levels.

AAER Reduction by Baseline Characteristics 
Tezepelumab treatment also resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in AAER across most subgroups 
defined by baseline ICS dose, age, sex, race, exacerbation history, OCS use, BMI (in groups ≥ 18.5), 
geographic  region  (excluding  Central/Eastern  Europe),  and  nasal  polyps  in  the  2  years  before 
randomisation.  
However, due to small numbers of subjects in certain subgroups (adolescents, Black or African American 
race, “Other” race, OCS present at baseline, and Central/Eastern Europe geography), the CIs for these

subgroups do not exclude 1. The number of subjects with a BMI < 18.5 was very small and, although no 
difference from placebo was observed, 11 subjects is too few to draw definitive conclusions.

At CHMP’s request, the applicant presented the efficacy results in the requested subgroup analyses for 
the primary endpoint separately for the PATHWAY and NAVIGATOR studies. The applicant has also 
presented subgroup analyses based on the pooled PATHWAY and NAVIGATOR studies and clarified that 
the time-at-risk for these pooled analyses is defined as the as the total duration of time in which a new 
exacerbation can occur (i.e. total-follow up time minus time during exacerbation and 7 days after. 
Each of the presented analyses suggests a positive treatment effect for tezepelumab in the subgroup 
of patients with both baseline blood eosinophil count <150 cells/µL and baseline FeNO <25 ppb, albeit 
of generally smaller magnitude and lesser precision than for the other three quadrants defined by 
baseline blood eosinophil count and baseline FeNO values.  
The below subgroup analyses based on the pooled PATHWAY and NAVIGATOR studies are presented in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC.

Notes 
Treatment with tezepelumab resulted in statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful reductions in AAER of 71%, 62%, and 66%, respectively, for the 
210 mg Q4W, 70 mg Q4W, and 280 mg Q2W doses, compared with placebo. 
For tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W, AAER reductions were observed, irrespective 
of  baseline  blood  eosinophil  count,  fractional  exhaled  nitric  oxide  (FeNO) 
levels, or allergic status, and total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE).

Adolescents Efficacy Results  
A  total  of  82  adolescents  aged  12  to  17  years  of  age  were  randomised  into  the  NAVIGATOR  study. 
Adolescent  subjects  showed  a  numerical  and  clinically  meaningful  reduction  in  asthma  exacerbations 
(AAER ratio 0.70 [95% CI 0.34, 1.46]). 
Adolescent subjects also showed a clinically meaningful improvement in FEV1 (LSMean change versus 
placebo was 0.17 L [95% CI -0.01, 0.35]). There were no differences in improvement observed for the 
PROs AQLQ(S)+12, ACQ-6, or ASD compared with placebo.

Study SOURCE: a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, phase 3 study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of tezepelumab in reducing oral corticosteroid use in adults 
with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma  
This  was  a  phase  3,  multicentre,  global,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group 
study designed to evaluate the effect of a 210 mg dose of tezepelumab administered subcutaneously 
every 4 weeks on oral corticosteroids (OCS) dose reduction in adult subjects with severe, OCS dependent 
asthma. The study randomised 150 subjects who were receiving a stable daily dose of between ≥ 7.5 
mg and ≤ 30 mg prednisone or prednisolone daily, or daily equivalent. Eligible subjects were randomly 
assigned (1:1) to receive either tezepelumab or placebo for 48 weeks.

Figure 30: Trial design  
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of tezepelumab compared with placebo in 
reducing the prescribed OCS maintenance dose in subjects with asthma requiring chronic treatment with 
maintenance OCS in addition to high-dose ICS plus LABA. Categorised percent reduction from baseline 
in the daily OCS dose at Week 48 while not losing asthma control was the primary endpoint of this study. 
This primary endpoint was not met. For the primary endpoint, the odds of reaching a category of greater 
percent  OCS  reduction  were  numerically  higher  with  tezepelumab  versus  placebo,  with  a  cumulative 
odds ratio (OR) of 1.28 (95% CI, 0.69, 2.35, p = 0.434), but was not statistically significant.  
There was one key secondary endpoint investigating the effect on exacerbations: annual rate of asthma 
exacerbation. For this key secondary endpoint, statistically significant difference between the treatment 
groups was not shown. For the annual rate of asthma exacerbation rate, the observed exacerbation ratio 
was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.44, 1.09; p = 0.111); similar to the NAVIGATOR study, the time at risk for this 
analysis  was  defined  as  the  total  duration  of  time  in  which  a  new  exacerbation  could  occur,  i.e.  total 
follow-up time minus time during exacerbation and 7 days after.

Figure 31: Flow chart of study design  
This  was  a  multicentre,  randomised,  open-label,  parallel-group  trial  designed  to  confirm  that 
tezepelumab could be successfully administered by both the APFS and the AI in clinic and at home. This 
trial was also designed to provide information on the functionality and the performance of the APFS and 
AI. 
This study used tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W, the same dose that is used in the Phase 3 programme. 
Subjects were allocated to receive tezepelumab 210 mg SC via a single-use APFS or AI in a 1:1 ratio 
and stratified by age (adults/adolescents) and country.  
Efficacy Evaluation  
Efficacy conclusions were made from subjects with severe asthma. During the 24-week treatment period, 
subjects were treated with 210 mg tezepelumab SC Q4W via APFS or AI. 
The following was concluded from this study: 
Tezepelumab was administered successfully in the clinic and at home by HCPs, subjects, or caregivers 
using an APFS or an AI device (91.7% and 92.4% respectively, for all administrations combined). 
Tezepelumab was successfully administered by HCPs, subjects, or caregivers to adolescents and adults 
with both devices (APFS: 100.0% and 90.6% for adolescents and adults, respectively; AI: 90.9% and 
92.6% for adolescents and adults, respectively). 
Tezepelumab was successfully administered by subjects or caregivers with both devices. The percentage 
of successful administrations in clinic or at home was 96.3% and 95.4%, respectively, in the APFS group 
and 95.2% and 97.1%, respectively, in the AI group. 
Tezepelumab  was  successfully  self-administered  by  subjects  in  clinic  and  at  home  using  both  devices 
(93.7% using an APFS device and 94.7% using an AI device). 
Tezepelumab  was  successfully  administered  by  caregivers  in  clinic  and  at  home  using  both  devices 
(92.9% using an APFS device and 100.0% using an AI device). 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 153/215 
 
 
 
 
The APFS and AI devices had a low failure rate: the percentage of devices that passed functional tests, 
physical  inspection,  and  showed  no  evidence  of  malfunction  was  99.1%  for  APFS  and  99.2%  for  AI 
devices. 
There were few product complaints (< 1% of devices for both APFS and AI). 
The percentage of subjects with well-controlled asthma as assessed by ACQ-6 was higher at EOT than 
at  baseline  in  both  the  APFS  group  and  the  AI  group  (APFS:  1.8%  and  34.2%  of  subjects  with  well-
controlled asthma at baseline and EOT, respectively; AI: 1.0% and 36.2% of subjects with well-controlled 
asthma at baseline and EOT, respectively). 
After  administration  of  tezepelumab  210  mg  SC  Q4W  via  APFS  or  AI,  the  mean  serum  trough 
concentration increased from Week 4 to Week 20 and was similar between Week 20 and Week 24 (EOT). 
The mean serum concentrations of tezepelumab were similar in the APFS group and the AI group (22.2 
μg/mL and 22.3 μg/mL at Week 24 in the APFS group and the AI group, respectively). 
ADA incidence and prevalence were low in both the APFS group and the AI group. In all ADA-positive 
subjects, the post-baseline ADA titres were low (around the level of detection) and the majority of them 
tested positive at a single time point. 
The COVID-19 pandemic was judged to not meaningfully impact the efficacy conclusions from this study. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The applicant submitted three studies (referred in the text as NAVIGATOR, PATHWAY and SOURCE) to 
support the use of tezepelumab in patients with severe asthma. 
Dose finding study  
The dose was selected based on the results of the PATHWAY study. In this phase 2b, randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging study with a 52-week treatment period (N = 550 randomised and 
treated) three doses were investigated. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive one of 3 
dose levels of SC tezepelumab (70 mg Q4W, 210 mg Q4W, 280 mg Q2W), or placebo Q2W for 52 weeks. 
In  addition,  the  results  of  the  210  mg  Q4W  arm  were  used  by  the  applicant  as  supportive  evidence. 
These results are discussed below.  
The  applicant  claimed  that  based  on  the  totality  of  evidence  across  the  primary  and  supportive 
exacerbation endpoints, as well as secondary endpoints for lung function and patient-reported outcomes, 
the 210 mg tezepelumab Q4W dose led to improved clinical efficacy compared with 70 mg Q4W, whereas 
the  280  mg  Q2W  dose  did  not  consistently  increase  efficacy  further  compared  with  210  mg  Q4W.  In 
relation to primary endpoint (AAER), the efficacy results were not significantly better for 210 mg Q4W 
as  compared  to  70  mg  Q4W  but  secondary  endpoints  provided  additional    supportive    evidence  i.e. 
tezepelumab treatment delayed the times to first exacerbation and reduced the risk of exacerbations by 
38%, 55%, and 46% for the 70 mg Q4W, 210 mg Q4W, and 280 mg Q2W doses, respectively, compared 
with placebo; and the proportion of subjects having at least one asthma exacerbation through Week 52 
was 21.7%, 15.3%, and 18.2% in the 70 mg Q4W, 210 mg Q4W, and 280 mg Q2W tezepelumab groups, 
respectively, compared with placebo (31.2%). Further, safety data from PATHWAY also supported the 
selection of the 210 mg Q4W dose of tezepelumab (see clinical safety section). Therefore, it was agreed 
that 210mg Q4W was appropriately selected for the phase 3 pivotal studies.   
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 154/215 
 
 
 
The NAVIGATOR study was considered as a pivotal study for this application. The study consisted of a 
screening/run-in period of 5 to 6 weeks, a treatment period of 52 weeks, and a post-treatment follow-
up period of 12 weeks.  
The NAVIGATOR study enrolled patients with severe asthma as all patients had to be in at least GINA 
2021 step 4 (on medium- to high-dose ICS + one additional controller medication with or without OCS) 
with poor symptoms control (ACQ-6 score ≥ 1.5).   
In  addition,  all  enrolled  patients  must  have  had  a  history  of  ≥  2  asthma  exacerbations  requiring 
treatment with systemic  corticosteroids or emergency department visit or in-patient hospitalisation in 
previous 12 months.  
It is noted that NAVIGATOR study enrolled patients irrespective of baseline blood eosinophils and FeNO 
levels  and  patients  with  low  values  such  as  <  150  eosinophils/μL  and  <25ppb  respectively  were  also 
included.  
In  NAVIGATOR  study  each  patient  randomised  received  either  tezepelumab  210  mg  Q4W  or  placebo 
Q4W for 52 weeks as add-on maintenance treatment.  
In relation to the background therapy in line with the inclusion criteria all patients had to be on medium- 
to  high-dose  ICS +  one additional  controller  medication  with  or  without  OCS. LABA,  LAMA,  LTRA  and 
theophylline  were  permitted  to  be  used  in  the  study.  No  changes  to  background  asthma  medications 
were allowed during the study except to treat an exacerbation. In addition, patients were allowed to use 
recue medications (i.e Albuterol/salbutamol. Regularly scheduled SABA use in the absence of symptoms 
as  well  as  the  use  of  biological  treatment  of  asthma  and  long-acting  beta  agonists  as  a  reliever  was 
prohibited in the study.  
It is noted that the NAVIGATOR study only enrolled patients at the end of medium ICS dose range (500 
μg fluticasone propionate or equivalent) and therefore it was unclear if these results can be extrapolated 
to a full medium ICS dose range. The applicant originally proposed indication as an add-on maintenance 
treatment in adults and adolescents 12 years and older with severe asthma which was not considered 
acceptable  to  the  CHMP  as  it  was  not  reflecting  baseline  ICS  dose  used  by  the  majority  of  patients 
investigated.  The  applicant  amended  the  indication  to  as  an  add-on  maintenance  treatment  in  adults 
and adolescents 12 years and older with severe asthma who are inadequately controlled with medium 
to  high  dose  inhaled  corticosteroids  plus  another  medicinal  product  for  maintenance  treatment.  This 
indication was still not considered acceptable by the CHMP as the data supporting the use of the product 
in patients receiving medium ICS dose were limited and further justification was required. The applicant 
agreed to remove MD-ICS from the indication statement and therefore the following proposed indication 
was considered acceptable to the CHMP: 
Tezspire is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults and adolescents 12 years and older 
with  severe  asthma  who  are  inadequately  controlled  despite  high  dose  inhaled  corticosteroids  plus 
another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. 
The  NAVIGATOR  study  had  one  primary  endpoint,  the  annualised  rate  of  severe  exacerbation  events 
during the 52-week placebo-controlled treatment period. This is in line with the CHMP `Guideline on the 
clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of asthma´ (CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1) as 
“for a new controller treatment the preferred endpoint is exacerbations.”   
It is noted that each subject’s time at risk was defined as the total duration of time in which they are 
not experiencing a protocol-defined exacerbation. This differs from the definition used in the PATHWAY 
study  and  in  the  trials  of  other  products  in  severe  asthma.  The  applicant  was  therefore  requested  to 
present a re-analysis of the primary endpoint where each subject’s time at-risk was their total length of 
follow
up in the trial, i.e. ignoring time spent in the exacerbation state. The applicant was also requested 
‐
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 155/215 
 
 
 
to  repeat  sensitivity  analyses  using  this  definition  of  the  time  at-risk.  The  results  presented  by  the 
applicant  as  requested  by  the  CHMP  were  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis  i.e.  as  expected  the 
magnitude  of  the  treatment  effect  is  slightly  attenuated  when  the  AAR  method,  rather  than  the  ERT 
method, is used to calculate each subject’s time-at-risk. The applicant’s arguments supporting use of 
the ERT method for calculating time-at-risk are accepted.   
In  the  NAVIGATOR  study,  there  were  four  key  secondary  endpoints:  change  from  baseline  in  pre-
bronchodilator FEV1, change from baseline in AQLQ(S)+12 total score, change from baseline in ACQ-6 
score and change from baseline in weekly mean daily Asthma Symptom Diary score. These endpoints 
are acceptable as they are considered as standard for the evaluation of chronic treatment of asthma. 
The primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints were included in the multiplicity control strategy. It 
needs to be noted that on the FDA request the annualised rate of severe exacerbation events during the 
52-week period in a subgroup of patients with baseline eosinophils < 300/μL was included in the second 
position in the multiplicity control strategy. This is acceptable.   
In addition, a broad range of other secondary endpoint were investigated including those investigating 
further  effects  of  tezepelumab  on  exacerbations  (i.e  time  to  first  asthma  exacerbation,  proportion  of 
subjects who did not experience an asthma exacerbation and annualised rate of exacerbations associated 
with  emergency  room  visit,  urgent  care  visit,  or  hospitalisation),  biomarkers  (FeNO,  peripheral  blood 
eosinophils  and  total  serum  IgE)  ,  other  asthma  control  metrics    and  a  number  of  patient-reported 
outcomes (including EQ-5D-5L, PGI-C and PGI-S score). 
In line with the CHMP asthma guideline, severe exacerbations of asthma were defined as a requirement 
for systemic corticosteroids or an increase of the maintenance dose of oral corticosteroids for at least 
three days and/or a need for an emergency visit, hospitalisation or death due to asthma. Nevertheless, 
the applicant did not use the term “severe” when describing exacerbations investigated in the study. In 
order to allow for comparison with other products, the applicant agreed to amend the product information 
and  the  text  ‘clinically  significant  asthma  exacerbations’  has  been  revised  to  ‘severe  asthma 
exacerbations’.  
In addition, deaths due to asthma were not included in the definition of exacerbations used in the pivotal 
study. The applicant was therefore requested to discuss and clarify how many death(s) due to asthma 
were recorded in the study. The applicant clarified that there were no deaths reported in the tezepelumab 
treatment group in the NAVIGATOR study. In the placebo group, there were 2 deaths reported, both of 
which occurred during the on-study period of the study, however neither death was recorded as due to 
asthma. The clarification provided by the applicant were considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
The design of the PATHWAY study (i.e tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W arm) was similar to the NAVIGATOR 
study in that they were GINA steps 4 and 5 and similar in terms of exacerbation at baseline, Patients 
were stratified based on study site (non-Japanese and Japanese), and then blood eosinophil count (≥ or 
< 250 cells/μL) and by ICS dose level (medium or high). The duration was over 50 weeks. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Baseline characteristics  
In the NAVIGATOR study the mean age of randomised patients was 49.5 (range: 12 to 80). Only 16.1% 
of the randomised patients were aged 65 years or older. The majority of enrolled patients were white 
(62.2%) or Asian (27.9%) and there were more females (63.5%). A total of 82 adolescents were included 
in this study with 41 adolescents in each treatment group. In the adolescent subgroup, there was an 
imbalance in the proportion of subjects with blood eosinophil levels < 300 cells/μL, blood eosinophils ≥ 
300 cells/μL and < 150 cells/μL. There was also an imbalance between treatment groups in FeNO levels, 
ICS dose, and perennial aeroallergen-specific IgE results.

This  pivotal  study  enrolled  patients  with  uncontrolled  asthma  with  the  baseline  mean  ACQ-6  score  of 
2.82. As required by the trial protocol, all patients must have at least two exacerbations in the previous 
year. Most patients (59.9%) had two exacerbations, 40% had more than 2 exacerbations in the previous 
year.  
In line with the inclusion criteria, all patients had to be on medium- to high-dose ICS + one additional 
controller  medication  with  or  without  OCS.  LABA,  LAMA,  LTRA  and  theophylline  were  permitted  to  be 
used in the study. The majority of enrolled patients (75.1%) received high dose ICS at baseline whereas 
24.8%  received  medium  dose  ICS.  In  accordance  with  the  protocol,  all  subjects  reported  use  of  an 
additional controller, including LABAs (98.8%), LAMAs (24.6%), and LTRAs (37.7%). The most common 
therapy combinations in this study were ICS + LABA (49.7%). Maintenance OCS was used by 9.4% of 
subjects. 
The  pivotal  study  enrolled  subjects  regardless  of  the  blood  eosinophils  level.  A  total  of  618  (58.4%) 
subjects  had  baseline  eosinophils  <  300  cells/μL  and  a  total  of  441  (41.6%)  subjects  had  baseline 
eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/μL. In relation to FeNO, 433 (41.3 %) subjects had FeNO <25ppb. 
In the PATHWAY study baseline demographics and disease characteristics were generally similar between 
the cohorts, the mean age was 51.55 years, 65.6% were female and 91.6% were white. Approximately 
50% of the population were on high dose ICS, 50% on medium level and the mean ACQ6 was 2.69.  
47.8% of subjects had baseline eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/μL and 52.2% < 300 cells/μL. In terms of TH2 
status 53.7% were low, 46.3% were high. In relation to FeNO, 45.9 % of subjects has FeNO <25ppb. 
Primary endpoint results  
The  NAVIGATOR  study  had  one  primary  endpoint,  the  annualised  rate  of  severe  exacerbation  events 
during the 52-week placebo-controlled treatment period.  
Tezepelumab 210 mg SC Q4W treatment reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations over 52 weeks by 
56%  compared  with  placebo  (rate  ratio  0.44  [95%  CI  0.37,  0.53];  p  <  0.001).  These  results  are 
considered as statistically significant and clinically relevant. In absolute terms also there was a significant 
reduction  in  the  number  of  exacerbations  as  there  was  0.93  exacerbation  per  year  observed  in  the 
tezepelumab group and 2.1 exacerbation per year in the placebo group. It is noted that the treatment 
effect in the subgroup of patients with baseline blood eosinophils 300 cells/μL was greater than observed 
in the overall population and in those with baseline blood eosinophils < 300 cells/μL. In subjects with 
baseline blood eosinophils > 300 cells/μL, the rate of asthma exacerbations was reduced by 70 % (rate 
ratio 0.30 [95% CI 0.22, 0.40]) whereas in subjects with baseline blood eosinophils < 300 cells/μL by 
41% (rate ratio 0.59 [95% CI 0.46, 0.75]). 
These results were further supported by other endpoints which investigated the effect on exacerbations 
such  as  time  to  first  asthma  exacerbation  and  proportion  of  subjects  experiencing  no  asthma 
exacerbations over 52 weeks.  
In  the  PATHWAY  study  the  primary  endpoint  of  the  annualised  AER  measured  at  week  52  was  met. 
Statistically significant annualised asthma exacerbation rate reduction (AERR) of 62%, 71%, and 66% 
for the 70 mg Q4W, 210 mg Q4W, and 280 mg Q2W tezepelumab groups, respectively, compared with 
placebo were observed in the ITT population (p < 0.001) at week 52. This was somewhat lower compared 
to the NAVIGATOR study and required further clarification. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis showed 
higher effect in patients on higher ICS level at baseline and in patients with baseline eosinophils < 300 
cells /μL and lower TH2 status, which is not in line with the NAVIGATOR study, this may have been due 
to lower patient numbers. 
It  is  noted  that  the  annualised  asthma  exacerbation  rate  reduction  was  significantly  higher  in  the 
PATHWAY study (71% for the 210 mg Q4W dose) than in the NAVIGATOR study (56% reduction).

The applicant was requested to discuss why such significant differences in the treatment effects were 
seen between these two studies. The applicant highlighted and explained differences between these two 
studies which likely contributed to differences in the study results (i.e. PATHWAY had a smaller sample 
size for the 210 mg Q4W dose group [N=137] than in NAVIGATOR [N=528]; patients enrolled to the 
NAVIGATOR study had more severe disease as compared to patients in the PATHWAY study; and higher 
AAER  was  observe  in  the  placebo  group  in  NAVIGATOR  [2.10]  compared  with  PATHWAY  [0.72].  The 
explanation provided by the applicant was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
Secondary endpoint results  
In the NAVIGATOR study, there were four key secondary endpoints such as change from baseline in pre-
bronchodilator FEV1, change from baseline in AQLQ(S)+12 total score, change from baseline in ACQ-6 
score and change from baseline in weekly mean daily Asthma Symptom Diary score. 
For all these endpoints statistically significant differences between the treatment groups were observed.  
Subjects receiving tezepelumab demonstrated an improvement from baseline in pre-BD FEV1 compared 
with placebo at 52 weeks (0.23 L vs 0.10 L, difference 0.13 L [95% CI 0.08, 0.18]; p < 0.001). The 
difference of 0.13 L between the treatment groups is considered as clinically relevant. 
Also, in relation to patient-reported outcomes investigated in the study, improvements were seen in the 
tezepelumab group as compared to placebo. At week 52 for AQLQ(S)+12 LS Mean difference between 
the groups was 0.33 [95% CI 0.20, 0.47]; p < 0.001; for ACQ-6 LS Mean difference was -0.33 [95% CI 
-0.46, -0.20]; p < 0.001 and for weekly mean Asthma Symptom Diary (ASD) score LS Mean difference 
was -0.11 [95% CI -0.19, -0.04]; p = 0.004.  
These results were further supported by the responder analyses in which a greater proportion of subjects 
in  the  tezepelumab  group  achieved  clinically  meaningful  improvements  in  AQLQ,  ACQ-6  and  ASD  as 
compared to placebo. It needs to be noted however that the responder analyses were not included in 
the  multiplicity  control  strategy  and  therefore  these  results  are  considered  as  supportive  only.  In  the 
responder  analysis,  for  AQLQ  at  least  0.5  units  increase  from  baseline  was  selected  as  clinically 
meaningful whereas for ACQ-6 0.5 and ASD score 0.5 units reduction from baseline in the ACQ-6 was 
considered as clinically meaningful. This is acceptable.  
In the PATHWAY study, the secondary endpoints were not controlled for multiplicity in the study. 
Tezepelumab  treatment  delayed  the  time  to  first  exacerbations  and  reduced  the  risk  of  having  any 
exacerbation  by  38%,  55%,  and  46%  for  the  70  mg  Q4W,  210  mg  Q4W,  and  280  mg  Q2W  doses, 
respectively, compared with placebo. 
The proportion of subjects having at least one asthma exacerbation through week 52 was reduced to 
21.7% (p = 0.076), 15.3% (p = 0.002), and 18.2% (p = 0.013) in the 70 mg Q4W, 210 mg Q4W, and 
280 mg Q2W tezepelumab groups, respectively, compared with placebo (31.2%); no subjects in either 
of the 3 tezepelumab dose groups experienced > 3 exacerbations through week 52.  
Reductions of 74%, 86%, and 74% in the severe AER were observed with 70 mg Q4W, 210 mg Q4W, 
and 280 mg Q2W tezepelumab groups, respectively, compared with placebo at week 52.   
Clinically  meaningful  increases  from  baseline  were  observed  for  pre-BD  FEV1  at  week  52  for  all  3 
tezepelumab dose groups compared with placebo (p < 0.05). The % improvement from baseline was 
highest for 280mg Q2W 10.44%, followed by 9.5% for 210mg Q4W and 8.3% for 70mg Q4W.  
There were also fewer exacerbations requiring emergency room visits and/or hospitalisation in patients 
treated  with  tezepelumab  compared  with  placebo.  In  PATHWAY  and  NAVIGATOR,  severe  asthma 
exacerbations requiring emergency room visits and/or hospitalisation were reduced by 85% and 79% 
with tezepelumab 210 mg subcutaneous Q4W, respectively.

Subgroup analyses 
The applicant performed a number of subgroup analyses. 
The  primary  interest  was  the  assessment  of  efficacy  of  tezepelumab  in  subgroups  depending  on  the 
baseline biomarker levels, i.e. blood eosinophils, FeNO and perennial specific IgE status. 
In  relation  to  blood  eosinophils,  the  treatment  effect  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  baseline  blood 
eosinophils >300 cells/μL, was greater than observed in the overall population and in those with baseline 
blood eosinophils < 300 cells/μL. In subjects with baseline blood eosinophils > 300 cells/μL the rate of 
asthma exacerbations was reduced by 70 % (rate ratio 0.30 [95% CI 0.22, 0.40]) whereas in subjects 
with baseline blood eosinophils < 300 cells/μL by 41% (rate ratio 0.59 [95% CI 0.46, 0.75]).  
The same trend (i.e. lower treatment effect in subjects with baseline blood eosinophils < 300 cells/μL 
and in particular those with blood eosinophils < 150 cells/μL) was observed in relation to results of key 
secondary  endpoints,  i.e.  change  from  baseline  in  pre-bronchodilator  FEV1,  change  from  baseline  in 
AQLQ(S)+12 total score, change from baseline in ACQ-6 score and change from baseline in weekly mean 
daily Asthma Symptom Diary score. 
In relation to FeNO, a lower treatment effect was observed in subjects with  baseline clinic visit FeNO 
group <25ppb in relation to the primary as well as the key secondary endpoint results.  
The applicant was requested to present the data and discuss the efficacy results in subjects with both 
low baseline blood eosinophils (< 300 cells/μL) and FeNO values <25ppb. As requested, the applicant 
presented  the  efficacy  results  in  this  subgroup.  There  was  a  clinically  meaningful  AAER  reductions  in 
subjects with both low baseline blood eosinophil counts (< 300 cells/μL) and FeNO values < 25 ppb (rate 
ratio 0.71 [95% CI 0.50, 1.00]), although it needs to be noted that the magnitude of benefit for AAER 
reduction with tezepelumab increased with increasing levels of eosinophils and FeNO. As requested, this 
was highlighted in the SmPC section 5.1.  
At the CHMP’s request, the applicant also presented the efficacy results in study subjects without type 2 
inflammation, i.e. in the subgroup of patients with both baseline blood eosinophil count <150 cells/µL 
and  baseline  FeNO  <25  ppb.  The  presented  analyses  suggested  a  positive  treatment  effect  for 
tezepelumab in the subgroup of patients with both baseline blood eosinophil count <150 cells/µL and 
baseline FeNO <25 ppb, albeit of generally smaller magnitude and lesser precision than for the other 
three quadrants defined by baseline blood eosinophil count and baseline FeNO values. On this basis, a 
restriction of indication to exclude patients with both baseline eosinophil count <150 cells/µL and baseline 
FeNO <25 ppb was not considered warranted by the CHMP. Presentation of subgroup analyses based on 
the pooled PATHWAY and NAVIGATOR studies in section 5.1 of the SmPC is also accepted. 
In relation to other baseline characteristics in general the direction of point estimate for most subgroups 
was in line with the general population.  
It is noted that the treatment effect was lower in patients receiving medium dose of ICS as compared to 
those receiving high ICS dose at baseline. The applicant was requested to further discuss the efficacy 
depending on the background therapy received including in patients treated with one additional controller 
medication versus two additional controller medications. The applicant clarified that a greater magnitude 
of benefit was observed with increasing number of controller medications, consistent with greater benefit 
in subjects with higher disease severity. For AAER, rate ratios were 0.59, 0.33, and 0.39 for subjects on 
1,  2,  or  ≥  3  additional  controllers.  All  subsets  showed  clinically  meaningful  benefit,  with  numerically 
greater  reductions  observed  in  those  on  2  or  ≥  3  controllers.  Placebo  rates  increased  across  the  3 
subgroups, with the greatest rates observed in subjects on ≥ 3 controllers. This is consistent with subjects 
with more severe disease receiving more controller medications.

The lack of treatment response was reported in patients with BMI less than 18.5 however a small number 
of patients in this subgroup is noted (i.e. 11 per treatment group).As such, it is not possible to draw any 
definitive conclusions. Furthermore, it is not expected that Tezepelumab would have lower efficacy in 
patients with lower BMI. 
A total of 82 adolescents  aged  12 to  17 years of age were randomised in the NAVIGATOR study. For 
adolescents, statistically significant results were not achieved, and the treatment effect was smaller as 
compared to the overall population. For exacerbations and FEV1 numerical improvements compared to 
placebo  were  reported  whereas  no  improvement  was  observed  for  the  PROs  AQLQ(S)+12,  ACQ-6,  or 
ASD compared with placebo. AAER ratio was 0.70 [95% CI 0.34, 1.46]) and for FEV1 LSMean change 
versus placebo was 0.17 L [95% CI -0.01, 0.35]. The applicant was requested discuss the seemingly 
smaller  treatment  effect  reported  in  the  adolescent  patients  as  compared  to  adults.  The  requested 
discussion was provided but further justification was required as the number of adolescents receiving 
high dose ICS at baseline was small (i.e 15 patients) and the product will be limited for the use in these 
patients (receiving high ICS at baseline). The applicant provided the requested discussion. Based on the 
justification provided by the applicant it can be agreed that the results from the adult population can be 
extrapolated  to  adolescents.  Further,  the  benefits  with  tezepelumab  treatment  can  be  observed  in 
adolescents taking HD-ICS at baseline enrolled to study. Adolescents taking HD-ICS at baseline showed 
improvement from baseline to week 52 in FEV1. The LSMean change versus  placebo at week 52 was 
0.22 L (95% CI -0.06, 0.50), generally consistent with the improvement seen in adults taking HD-ICS 
(LSMean change from placebo 0.17L (95% CI 0.11, 0.22), as well as that observed in the overall adult 
population. In the adolescent subgroup taking HD-ICS, a total of 6 (40.0%) subjects in the tezepelumab 
group  versus  11  (55.0%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  had  at  least  one  exacerbation,  with  a  crude 
exacerbation  rate  of  0.58  in  the  tezepelumab  group  and  1.21  in  the  placebo  group.  The  relative 
improvement  versus  placebo  appears  similar  to  that  seen  in  the  adults  taking  HD-ICS,  based  on  the 
descriptive measures of the rates (0.88 in the tezepelumab group and 2.09 in the placebo group), as 
well as that seen in adults overall in NAVIGATOR. Overall, the inclusion of the adolescents group in the 
therapeutic indication in SmPC section 4.1 was supported by the CHMP. In the SmPC in section 5.1 it is 
highlighted that only 15 adolescent patients taking HD-ICS were included in the pivotal studies. 
SOURCE study 
The  applicant  also  submitted  a  supportive  study  (SOURCE)  investigating  the  effect  of  tezepelumab 
compared  with  placebo  in  reducing  the  prescribed  oral  corticosteroids  (OCS)  maintenance  dose  in 
subjects with asthma requiring chronic treatment with maintenance OCS in addition to high-dose ICS 
plus LABA. 
The  SOURCE  study  was  enrolling  adult  patients  with  asthma  who  in  addition  to  high  ICS  dose/LABA 
combination were receiving treatment with ≥ 7.5 to ≤ 30mg dose of OCS (prednisone or prednisolone) 
at  least  one  month  prior  to  Visit  1.  Additional  maintenance  asthma  controller  medications  were  also 
allowed.  These patients also required to have a history of least one severe asthma exacerbation (as per 
the  CHMP  definition)  event  within  12 months  prior  to Visit  1.  150  subjects  were  randomised  into  this 
study and received either tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W (74 subjects) or placebo Q4W (76 subjects). The 
discontinuation rate was low although slightly fewer subjects completed treatment in the tezepelumab 
group compared with placebo. The mean age of randomised patients was 53.4 years. Low baseline blood 
eosinophils level was reported in 34 % of subjects and low FeNO level (<25ppb) was reported in 39% of 
subjects. 42% of subjects had one exacerbation in the last 12 months prior to enrolment. The remaining 
subjects had two exacerbations or more. Categorised percent reduction from baseline in the daily OCS 
dose at Week 48 while not losing asthma control was the primary endpoint of this study. This primary 
endpoint was not met. For the primary endpoint, the odds of reaching a category of greater percent OCS 
reduction were numerically higher with tezepelumab versus placebo, with a cumulative odds ratio (OR) 
of 1.28 (95% CI, 0.69, 2.35, p = 0.434), but was not statistically significant. It is noted that the observed 
Assessment report

proportion of placebo subjects in each OCS reduction category differed substantially from the assumed 
proportions in the sample size calculation but the reason for this discrepancy is unclear. However this 
was not further pursued as the applicant was not seeking a specific claim in relation to reduction of oral 
steroids.  
There was one key secondary endpoint investigating the effect on exacerbations:  annual rate of asthma 
exacerbation. For this key secondary endpoint, statistically significant difference between the treatment 
groups was not shown. For the annual rate of asthma exacerbation rate ratio was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.44, 
1.09; p = 0.111). The applicant proposed to include the results of the SOURCE study in section 5.1 of 
the  SmPC.  This  was  not  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP  as  this  study  was  only  supportive  and 
primary and key secondary endpoints of this study were not met. In light of the fact that the study did 
not meet its primary and key secondary endpoints, the applicant agreed to remove the SOURCE data 
from section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
It is noted that the results for the primary endpoint were not consistent across the prespecified baseline 
characteristic subgroup analyses in particular in respect to baseline blood eosinophils and FeNO levels 
(there was no response in subjects with low baseline values). The applicant was therefore requested to 
comment  on  these  results.  The  applicant  highlighted  that  there  was  a  possibility  that  the  subgroups 
defined  by  baseline  eosinophil  counts  as  well  as  other  baseline  characteristics  may  be  heterogeneous 
with respect to true OCS dependence. Further, it is known that patients in SOURCE were on chronic OCS 
which have   known to decrease blood eosinophil counts. Thus, the CHMP agreed that results could not 
be inferred from PATHWAY and NAVIGATOR to this subgroup. 
With respect to lack of response observed in subjects with high BMI, more than 65 years of age and on 
high OCS at baseline; each of these subgroups comprise small subject numbers and the CIs around the 
estimates were wide and overlapping. It is thus difficult to draw any conclusions based on these results.    
Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic on Navigator study  
The COVID-19 pandemic was ongoing during the conduct of this study. At the time of the declaration, 
recruitment into this study and randomisation of subjects had concluded. 
Changes  to  the  conduct  of  the  study  were  necessary  because  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  It  is 
nevertheless considered that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the study was not significant as: 
•  No subjects discontinued or withdrew from the study due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
•  A  small  percentage  of  subjects  (6.5%)  experienced  at  least  one  study  disruption  due  to  the 
COVID-19 pandemic, which included missed or altered study visits and measurements. 
•  Overall,  COVID-19  was  reported  to  have  had  an  effect  on  IP  administration  in  27  subjects 
(2.5%).  Of  these  subjects,  3  (0.6%)  in  the  tezepelumab  group  and  8  (1.5%)  in  the  placebo 
group  missed  one  dose  of  IP  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  The  corresponding  numbers  of 
subjects who missed 2 doses of IP were 1 (0.2%) and 5 (0.9%), respectively, and the numbers 
of  subjects  who  missed  2  or  more  consecutive  doses  of  IP  were  1  (0.2%)  and  4  (0.8%), 
respectively. 
•  Additional analyses conducted to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the primary 
objective (AAER) showed results similar to the primary analysis. 
•  Additional  analyses  conducted  to  assess  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  a  key 
secondary objective (FEV1) showed results similar to the primary analysis.

2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  applicant  submitted  three  studies  (NAVIGATOR,  PATHWAY  and  SOURCE)  to  support  the  use  of 
tezepelumab in patients with severe asthma. The NAVIGATOR study was considered as a pivotal study 
for this application. Tezepelumab 210 mg SC Q4W treatment reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations 
over 52 weeks by 56% compared with placebo (rate ratio 0.44 [95% CI 0.37, 0.53]; p < 0.001). Further, 
for  all  four  key  secondary  endpoints  (change  from  baseline  in  pre-bronchodilator  FEV1,  change  from 
baseline in AQLQ(S)+12 total score, change from baseline in ACQ-6 score and change from baseline in 
weekly  mean  daily  Asthma  Symptom  Diary  score),  statistically  significant  differences  between  the 
treatment groups were observed. These results are considered as statistically significant and clinically 
relevant in the following indication: Tezspire is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults 
and adolescents 12 years and older with severe asthma who are inadequately controlled despite high 
dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The evaluation of safety data to support the evaluation of the safety profile of tezepelumab in subjects 
with severe, uncontrolled asthma was focused on the Primary Safety Pool which consisted of pooled AEs 
data from the confirmatory asthma exacerbation studies NAVIGATOR and PATHWAY for the 210 mg Q4W 
SC dose group and placebo group only.  
Primary Safety Pool (NAVIGATOR and PATHWAY) 
The NAVIGATOR and PATHWAY studies evaluated a 210 mg dose of tezepelumab administered SC Q4W 
in  subjects  with  severe,  uncontrolled  asthma.  Asthma-related  inclusion  criteria  for  both  studies  were 
similar,  requiring  subjects  to  be  treated  with  MD  or  HD  ICS  plus  at  least  one  additional  maintenance 
asthma controller medication (eg, LABA, LTRA, theophylline, LAMA, cromones, etc) in NAVIGATOR for at 
least 12 months prior to Visit 1, or plus LABA in PATHWAY for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1, and 
throughout the screening/run-in period, where MD and HD ICS were defined according to GINA guidelines 
at the time (GINA 2017 for NAVIGATOR and GINA 2012 for PATHWAY). It is important to note that no 
changes to background asthma medications were allowed during the studies except to treat a protocol-
defined  exacerbation;  background  asthma  treatments  were  continued  throughout  the  treatment  and 
post-study periods. Inclusion criteria for both studies also required a documented history of at least 2 
severe asthma exacerbations (or 1 severe asthma exacerbation resulting in hospitalisation in PATHWAY) 
in the 12 months prior to study entry and an Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 (ACQ-6) score ≥ 1.5 at 
screening. These inclusion criteria ensured the recruitment of subjects with severe, uncontrolled asthma.  
The design of the NAVIGATOR and PATHWAY studies satisfied all of the following criteria, supporting the 
Primary Safety Pool as the most relevant pool for evaluation of integrated AE data supporting the safety 
profile of tezepelumab for the proposed use as an add-on maintenance treatment in patients with severe 
asthma aged 12 years and older: 
•  Conducted in subjects with severe, uncontrolled asthma based on similar inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. 
•  Allowed  for  direct  comparisons  with  a  robust  control  group  by  using  a  double-blind  placebo-
controlled study design. 
• 
Included the asthma dose and dosing schedule (fixed 210 mg dose of tezepelumab administered 
subcutaneously on a Q4 weekly schedule) proposed to be commercialised.  
•  Had the same treatment duration of 52 weeks. 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 162/215 
 
 
 
•  Used similar safety endpoints which were assessed at study visits with compatible frequencies 
for assessment of AEs (i.e., after Week 2, assessments were Q4W for NAVIGATOR vs Q2W for 
PATHWAY). 
•  Ensured commonality of background asthma medications, ICS plus LABA and other controllers. 
This pool allowed comparison of the safety profile of combined tezepelumab 210 mg groups versus that 
of the placebo groups from the NAVIGATOR and PATHWAY studies in subjects with severe, uncontrolled 
asthma. 
Despite the important similarities between the confirmatory asthma exacerbation studies NAVIGATOR 
and PATHWAY, there were differences between the 2 studies. Notably, in the PATHWAY study, 3 doses 
of tezepelumab (70 mg Q4W, 210 mg Q4W and 280 mg Q2W) were compared with placebo in order to 
assess the optimal dosage for treatment. The low (70 mg Q4W), medium (210 mg Q4W), and high (280 
mg  Q2W)  dose  levels  of  tezepelumab  were  selected  to  provide  minimum  exposure  overlap  between 
treatment  groups.  Although  the  focus  was  on  analysis  of  safety  of  the  proposed  tezepelumab  dosing 
regimen, 210 mg Q4W, key safety results by dose from PATHWAY, were also presented, as these data 
in part formed the basis for dose selection for the Phase 3 studies NAVIGATOR and SOURCE. For this 
safety  evaluation,  differences  between  NAVIGATOR  and  PATHWAY  which  do  not  preclude  pooling  for 
safety, were as follows: 
•  Different geographical distribution among recruiting sites. 
•  Different stratification factors (ie, Japanese/non-Japanese, above/below eosinophil 250 cells/μL, 
MD/HD ICS dose in PATHWAY versus region and age in NAVIGATOR) and a different approach 
to  operational  control  of  certain  subgroups  (ie,  in  NAVIGATOR  the  proportions  of  randomised 
subjects with eosinophil count above and below 300 cells/μL, receiving MD or HD ICS dose at 
baseline, and with 2 versus > 2 prior exacerbations were controlled). 
• 
• 
• 
• 
PATHWAY allowed subjects with 2 exacerbations or 1 hospitalisation due to exacerbation in the 
year  prior  to  screening,  whereas  NAVIGATOR  required  all  subjects  to  have  had  at  least  2 
exacerbations in the previous year (even if one was a hospitalisation event). 
Tezepelumab  or  placebo  was  administered  Q4W  in  NAVIGATOR,  and  Q2W  in  PATHWAY  to 
maintain the blind in the 280 mg Q2W group. 
IP was administered as 1 SC injection in NAVIGATOR, and as 3 SC injections in PATHWAY (to 
achieve the proper dose [70 mg, 210 mg, or 280 mg] and to maintain the blind). 
The Process 2 formulation intended to be used for commercialisation was used in NAVIGATOR 
and  the  Process  1  formulation  was  used  in  PATHWAY.  Analytical  comparability  testing  has 
demonstrated  that  the  commercial  product  is  comparable  to  the  drug  product  tested  during 
clinical studies. In addition, population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis showed that formulation 
(Clinical Process 1 versus Clinical Process 2) did not have a clinically meaningful effect on PK. 
Adverse event data from SOURCE, PATH-HOME, and CASCADE were not integrated in the Primary Safety 
Pool due to the following differences: 
• 
• 
The SOURCE design incorporated a planned reduction of OCS which could potentially confound 
the interpretation of the safety results. The CASCADE study design required bronchoscopy (an 
invasive  procedure)  which  may  be  associated  with  a  different  AE  profile  and  the  treatment 
duration was considerably shorter (28 weeks vs 52 weeks). 
The  PATH-HOME  study  was  not  a  placebo-controlled  study,  used  different  study  methods  and 
the length of study was considerably shorter (24 weeks vs 52 weeks), with potential reporting 
bias as an open-label study.

As  per  CHMP’s  request,  the  applicant  provided  safety  data  from  the  LTE  DESTINATION  study  due  to 
unanticipated  safety  concerns  regarding  cardiac  SAEs  and  deaths  identified  by  the  applicant  after 
unblinding of data. This study was not part of either the initial  application or the Primary Safety Pool 
assessment (NAVIGATOR & PATHWAY studies) but rather consisted of patients from the NAVIGATOR & 
SOURCE studies. The safety data from the LTE DESTINATION study are presented below and discussed 
in section 2.6.9. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Exposure Pool 
The Exposure Pool provided an integrated pool of summary demographics, baseline characteristics and 
Investigational  Product  (IP)  exposure  data  from  all  Phase  2  and  Phase  3  studies  of  tezepelumab  in 
subjects  with  asthma,  i.e.,  NAVIGATOR,  PATHWAY,  SOURCE,  PATH-HOME,  and  CASCADE.  For  the 
reasons stated above relating to differences in design and duration of treatment for SOURCE, CASCADE 
and PATH-HOME, AE data across all 5 studies was not pooled. 
In the Exposure Pool, 5 treatment groups were represented: tezepelumab 280 mg Q2W SC; tezepelumab 
210 mg Q4W SC; tezepelumab 70 mg Q4W SC; tezepelumab all doses combined; and Placebo. 
Note that as there were 2 different devices in PATH-HOME, data from subjects treated with tezepelumab 
via either device were pooled and presented together as a single tezepelumab 210 mg dose group. 
Overall Subject Exposure 
The overall clinical development programme included safety assessments of 2143 subjects with asthma 
treated  with  at  least  one  dose  of  tezepelumab  or  placebo,  including  1326  subjects  treated  with 
tezepelumab representing over 1100 subject-years of exposure to tezepelumab at any dose. A total of 
1104 subjects were exposed to tezepelumab doses of 210 mg Q4W or higher for 6 months (≥ 20 weeks 
of dosing) and 787 subjects were exposed to tezepelumab doses of 210 mg Q4W or higher for one year 
(≥ 48 weeks of dosing). 
In the Exposure Pool, 2091 subjects received treatment, including 1289 who received tezepelumab at 
doses of 70 mg Q4W, 210 mg Q4W or 280 mg Q2W, and 802 who received placebo. The mean duration 
of exposure for subjects in the tezepelumab all doses group was approximately 314 days and the total 
exposure to tezepelumab at any dose was approximately 1107 subject-years. In this pool, of the 1014 
subjects who received treatment with tezepelumab 210 mg SC Q4W, a total of 976 (96.3%) were treated 
for ≥ 20 weeks and 668 (65.9%) were treated for ≥ 48 weeks. 
Primary safety pool 
The Primary Safety Pool included 1336 randomised subjects, of whom 1334 received treatment, 665 in 
the  tezepelumab  210  mg  Q4W  treatment  group  and  669  in  the  placebo  group;  these  1334  subjects 
comprise the safety analysis set. Out of those subjects randomised and treated, 1216 (91.0%) completed 
treatment as planned and 1212 (90.7%) completed treatment and completed the study. 
The Primary Safety Pool included 665 subjects who received tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W for up to one 
year,  representing  approximately  640  subject-years  of  exposure.  In  this  pool, a  total  of  635  subjects 
(95.5%) were treated with tezepelumab for ≥ 20 weeks and 615 subjects (92.5%) were treated with 
tezepelumab for ≥ 48 weeks. The mean duration of exposure for subjects in the tezepelumab group was 
approximately 350 days. 
In general, the Primary Safety Pool disposition data were balanced across both treatment groups with 
similar numbers of subjects completing treatment and completing the study in both treatment groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022

Overall, the most frequent reason for not completing treatment was ’withdrawal by subject’ (52 subjects 
[3.9%]). A total of 1274 (95.4%) subjects completed the studies and the most frequently cited reason 
for not completing the studies was ‘withdrawal by subject’ (34 subjects [2.5%]). 
In the NAVIGATOR study, no subject discontinued treatment or withdrew from the study due to COVID-
19  pandemic  related  reasons.  Eligible  subjects  in  NAVIGATOR  could  enrol  in  the  extension  study 
(DESTINATION)  instead  of  entering  study  follow-up.  A  total  of  826  subjects  who  received  IP  in 
NAVIGATOR  entered  DESTINATION,  with  similar  numbers  from  both  the  tezepelumab  and  placebo 
treatment groups (415 [78%] and 411 [77%] subjects, respectively. Thus, comparatively few subjects 
remained in the NAVIGATOR study to enter the 12-week safety follow-up period comprising 72 (14.8%) 
subjects and 56 (12.0%) subjects in the tezepelumab and placebo groups, respectively.  
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
Primary Safety Pool 
The majority (1008 out of 1334 [75.6%]) of subjects experienced 1 or more AEs during the on-treatment 
period. The overall incidence of on-treatment AEs was similar between the tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W 
and placebo groups (74.6% vs 76.5% of subjects, respectively).  
AEs were most commonly reported in the SOCs of Infections and Infestations (incidence of 55.5% in the 
tezepelumab group and 57.7% in the placebo group). Other SOCs in which AEs occurred with an overall 
incidence  of  at  least  10%  in  either  the  tezepelumab  or  placebo  groups  included:  Musculoskeletal  and 
Connective  Tissue  disorders  (16.7%  and  14.1%,  respectively),  Respiratory,  Thoracic  and  Mediastinal 
Disorders (14.1% and 23.2%), Nervous System Disorders (13.5% in both groups), General Disorders 
(12.9% and  12.0%), Gastrointestinal  disorders (12.8% and 13.0%), and Injury, Poisoning and Other 
Complications (10.7% and 9.6%). 
For the Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders SOC, the higher overall incidence of AEs in the 
placebo treatment group (23.2%), compared with the tezepelumab treatment group (14.1%) appeared 
to be driven by the higher incidence of AEs with PT ‘asthma’ in the placebo group (described below). The 
overall  incidence  of  AEs  among  all  other  individual  SOCs  was  balanced  across  treatment  groups.  In 
general, a similar pattern of results was observed for AEs by SOC for the on-study period when compared 
with those in the on-treatment period. 
The  4  most  common  AEs  reported  in  the  tezepelumab  group  were  nasopharyngitis,  upper  respiratory 
tract  infection,  headache  and  asthma,  reported  by  19.5%,  9.3%,  7.8%,  and  7.4%  of  subjects 
respectively, compared with 19.1%, 13.3%, 7.5%, and 15.7% subjects in the placebo group. 
Incidences of most AEs were generally similar across both treatment groups, except for upper respiratory 
tract  infection,  asthma,  and  sinusitis,  respectively,  which  were  reported  with  lower  incidence  in  the 
tezepelumab group compared with the placebo group (9.3% vs 13.3%; 7.4% vs 15.7%; and 3.5% vs 
6.3%, respectively). 
A similar pattern of results was observed for common AEs evaluated by PT for the on-study period when 
compared with those in the on-treatment period. 
For the studies of the Primary Safety Pool, summaries of pooled AE data by intensity were not available. 
Based on data from NAVIGATOR and  PATHWAY, respectively, the majority of AEs reported in the on-
treatment period of both studies were mild or moderate in intensity. 
In  NAVIGATOR,  the  incidence  of  AEs  determined  to  be  severe  was  low  in  both  the  tezepelumab  and 
placebo  groups  (6.6%  and  11.1%,  respectively).  Overall,  the  most  frequently  reported  PTs  of  severe 
Assessment report

Page 165/215 
 
 
 
intensity in NAVIGATOR were asthma, and pneumonia bacterial, and similar incidences occurred in the 
on-treatment and on-study periods.  
The number of subjects and incidence of AEs assessed as related to IP, as judged by the investigator, 
during the on-treatment period was 60 (9.0%) subjects in the tezepelumab group and 54 (8.1%) in the 
placebo group. 
AEs considered causally related to IP by the investigator occurring in > 2 subjects in either treatment 
group were headache (9/665 [1.4%] subject in the tezepelumab group versus 5/669 [0.7%] subjects in 
the  placebo  group),  Injection  site  erythema  (8/665  [1.2%]  vs  12/669  [1.8%],  respectively),  fatigue 
(5/665 [0.8%] vs 4/669 [0.6%], respectively), arthralgia (4/665 [0.6%] vs 1/669 [0.1%],  respectively), 
migraine  (3/665  [0.5%]  vs  1/669  [0.1%],  respectively)  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (3/665 
[0.5%] vs 0/669 [0.0%], respectively). All other AEs considered causally related to IP by the investigator 
occurred in ≤ 2 subjects per preferred term. 
The incidence of AEs causally related to IP, as judged by the investigator, during the on-study period 
was similar between tezepelumab and placebo groups. 
PATHWAY 
Approximately 65% of subjects in each of the 3 tezepelumab groups and placebo group had at least 1 
treatment-emergent AE (TEAE), with no notable differences in the proportion of subjects with at least 1 
TEAE in the tezepelumab and placebo groups. Treatment-emergent AEs in the SOCs of Infections and 
Infestations,  Respiratory,  Thoracic  and  Mediastinal  Disorders,  Musculoskeletal  and  Connective  Tissue 
Disorders, and Gastrointestinal Disorders were the most frequent (incidence ≥ 10% in the tezepelumab 
total group) and occurred at similar frequencies across the tezepelumab and placebo treatment groups. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs by preferred term (incidence ≥ 5% in the tezepelumab total group) 
were  asthma,  nasopharyngitis,  bronchitis,  and  headache.  Nasopharyngitis,  bronchitis  and  headache 
occurred at similar frequencies across the tezepelumab and placebo groups whereas as expected, asthma 
occurred at a greater frequency (> 10% difference) in the placebo group compared with the tezepelumab 
groups. 
In PATHWAY, the majority of TEAEs in the as-treated population across the tezepelumab and placebo 
groups were mild or moderate in intensity. There were no life threatening or fatal TEAEs reported in the 
placebo group. There were 2 life-threatening TEAEs of pneumonia and neutropenia, and one fatal TEAE 
of cerebrovascular accident in 1 subject in the 70 mg Q4W tezepelumab group, one life-threatening TEAE 
of pancreatic carcinoma metastatic in 1 subject in the 210 mg Q4W tezepelumab group, and one life-
threatening TEAE of anaphylactic shock, due to peanut, in 1 subject in the 280 mg Q2W tezepelumab 
group. 
The  incidence  of  TEAEs  related  to  investigational  product  was  low  and  generally  similar  between 
tezepelumab (70 mg Q4W, 14 subjects [10.1%]; 210 mg Q4W 14 subjects [10.2%]; 280 mg Q2W 12 
subjects  [8.8%])  and  placebo  (11  subjects  [8.0%])  groups.  There  were  no  investigational  product-
related TEAEs with a ≥ 5% incidence (by SOC and Preferred Term) in the total tezepelumab group. The 
most  frequently  reported  IP-related  TEAEs  (in  ≥  2  subjects)  by  preferred  term  in  the  70  mg  Q4W 
tezepelumab group were erythema (2 [1.4%]) and asthma (2 [1.4%]). The most frequently reported 
IP-related TEAE (in ≥ 2 subjects) in the 210 mg Q4W tezepelumab group was parosmia (2 [1.5%]), and 
in  the  280  mg  Q2W  tezepelumab  group  was  respiratory  tract  infection  viral  (2  [1.5%]).  The  most 
frequently  reported  IP-related  TEAEs  (≥  2  subjects)  in  the  placebo  group  were  asthma  (2  [1.4%]), 
injection site erythema, (2 [1.4%]) and pruritus (2 [1.4%]).

The overall  incidence  of subjects with  AEs in the on-treatment  period was 71.6% in the  tezepelumab 
group and 85.5% in the placebo group. In SOURCE, the AEs most commonly reported during the on-
treatment  period  were  in  the  Infections  and  Infestations  SOC  (47.3%  vs  56.6%  of  subjects  in  the 
tezepelumab  and  placebo  groups,  respectively).  Other  SOCs  in  which  AEs  occurred  with  an  overall 
incidence  of  at  least  10%  included  Musculoskeletal  and  Connective  Tissue  Disorders  SOC  (14.9%  vs 
17.1%), Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders (10.8% vs 26.3%), Gastrointestinal Disorders 
(10.8% vs 7.9%), General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (8.1% vs 10.5%), and Nervous 
System Disorders SOC (5.4% vs 15.8%). Overall AEs by SOC were generally similar for the on-study 
period. 
The 4 most common AEs in the tezepelumab group during the on-treatment period in this study were 
nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, asthma, and bronchitis bacterial, reported by 14.9%, 
12.2%,  9.5%,  and  8.1%  of  subjects  in  the  tezepelumab  group,  respectively,  compared  with  25.0%, 
9.2%, 17.1%, and 9.2% subjects in the placebo group. 
The majority of reported AEs in the on-treatment period of the SOURCE study were mild or moderate in 
intensity. The incidence of AEs determined to be severe during the on-treatment period was 16.2% in 
the  tezepelumab  group  and  19.7%  in  the  placebo  group.  The  most  frequently  reported  AE  of  severe 
intensity during the on-treatment period was the PT of asthma, reported in 3 (4.1%) and 8 (10.5%) of 
subjects in the tezepelumab and placebo groups, respectively. All other AE PTs of severe intensity were 
reported at an incidence of 1 subject in either treatment group with no discernible pattern. 
The incidence of AEs related to IP in SOURCE, as judged by the investigator, during the on-treatment 
period  was  low  overall  and  similar  between  tezepelumab  and  placebo  groups.  There  were  3  events 
reported by  3 (4.1%) subjects in the tezepelumab group:  1 each of myalgia, erythema, and pyrexia. 
There  were  10  events  reported  by  4  (5.3%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group:  1  each  of  headache, 
arthralgia, aphthous ulcer, dizziness, dysgeusia, fatigue, injection site erythema, injection site nodule, 
injections site pruritis, and visual impairment. All the AEs that were considered by the investigator to be 
causally related to IP were reported by single subjects in either treatment group. 
There were no new AEs considered by the investigator to be related to IP reported in the on-study period 
in either treatment group. Similar results were observed in the on-study period. 
Adverse Drug Reactions 
Based  on  a  detailed  assessment  by  an  internal  peer  review  panel  of  data  from  the  tezepelumab 
confirmatory asthma exacerbation studies, data from other supportive Phase 2 and 3 studies, pertinent 
information  from  other  elements  of  the  tezepelumab  development  programme  (e.g.,  nonclinical 
information), and information from outside the development programme (e.g., data from the literature), 
few adverse events were considered to have a reasonable possibility of having a causal association with 
tezepelumab. The events which the applicant considered as adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are listed in 
the below Table, by decreasing frequency of occurrence in the tezepelumab group of the Primary Safety 
Pool.

Safety Pool, Safety Analysis Set) 
Adverse Events of Special Interest: Primary Safety Pool 
Serious Infections 
In both NAVIGATOR and PATHWAY, SAEs reported in the Infections and Infestations SOC were evaluated 
and pooled data are presented in this subsection. In addition, in NAVIGATOR, all severe infections were 
evaluated, including SAEs reported in the Infections and Infestations SOC which constitute a subgroup 
of all severe infections.  
In the Primary Safety Pool, the incidence of SAEs reported in the Infections and Infestations SOC was 
low overall and similar between the tezepelumab and placebo groups. A total of 28 subjects reported an 
SAE in the Infections and Infestations SOC during the on-treatment period: 13 (2.0%) subjects in the 
tezepelumab group and 15 (2.2%) subjects in the placebo group. 
Apart  from  the  SAEs  of  cellulitis  (occurring  in  3  [0.4%]  placebo-treated  subjects  and  none  of  the 
tezepelumab-treated subjects), no other single SAE in the Infections and infestations SOC occurred with 
a PT incidence of > 2 subjects in either treatment group, and most other SAEs occurred with an incidence 
of 1 subject per PT. Of the SAEs in the Infections and Infestations SOC, 2 events were considered causally 
related  to  IP  by  the  investigator  (1  subject  [0.2%]  for  each  event):  upper  respiratory  tract  infection 
(tezepelumab  group)  and  lung  abscess  (placebo  group).  For  non-serious  infections,  there  were  no 
patterns or trends observed in respect of reported events of viral infections or pneumonia. 
Opportunistic Infections 
No events of opportunistic infection were reported in the Primary Safety Pool. 
Helminth Infections 
No events of helminth infection were reported in the Primary Safety Pool. 
Anaphylactic or Serious Allergic Reactions 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 168/215 
 
 
 
 
No  anaphylactic  or  serious  allergic  reactions  that  were  considered  causally  related  to  tezepelumab  by 
the investigator occurred in the Primary Safety Pool. 
In  NAVIGATOR,  one  PT  of  anaphylactic  reaction  related  to  a  food  allergy  (beef)  was  reported  in  the 
placebo  group,  which  occurred  outside  the  72-hour  window  of  defining  anaphylactic  reactions;  this 
subject had a known allergy to beef and had acute onset of symptoms 10 to 15 minutes after having 
beef, 21 days after dose 3. 
Hypersensitivity Reactions 
In the Primary Safety Pool, within the narrow SMQ of hypersensitivity, the incidence of hypersensitivity 
reactions  reported  during  the  on-treatment  period  was  similar  in  both  treatment  groups:  56  (8.4%) 
subjects in the tezepelumab group and 58 (8.7%) subjects in the placebo group. Across both treatment 
groups the most common hypersensitivity reaction was rhinitis allergic, reported by 18 subjects (2.7%) 
in the tezepelumab group and 22 subjects (3.3%) in the placebo group. Most of the other hypersensitivity 
reactions  were  in  the  Skin  and  Subcutaneous  Disorders  SOC,  reported  by  32  subjects  (4.8%)  in  the 
tezepelumab group and 30 subjects (4.5%) in the placebo group. The majority of the hypersensitivity 
reactions reported were not considered related to IP by the investigator. Hypersensitivity reactions that 
were considered related to IP by the investigator were reported by 4 (0.6%) subjects in the tezepelumab 
group  (events  of  conjunctivitis  allergic,  rash,  eczema  nummular,  and  rash  maculo-papular)  and  by  6 
(0.9%) subjects in the placebo group (events of rhinitis allergic, allergic gastroenteritis, rash, dermatitis 
allergic, pruritis allergic, rash macular, and toxic skin eruption). 
A  total  of  3 subjects  reported  SAEs  of  hypersensitivity  reaction  in  the  on-treatment  period:  1  subject 
(0.2%) in the tezepelumab group and 2 subjects (0.3%) in the placebo group; none were considered by 
the  investigator  to  be  related  to  IP.  Two  of  the  serious  hypersensitivity  events  were  reported  in 
NAVIGATOR, one in the tezepelumab group (PT: dermatitis contact) and the other in the placebo group 
(PT:  anaphylactic  reaction;  also  described  above  in  ‘Anaphylactic  or  Serious  Allergic  Reactions’).  The 
serious  hypersensitivity  reaction  that  occurred  in  PATHWAY  was  in  the  placebo  group  (PT:  dermatitis 
atopic).  No  events  of  confirmed  immune  complex  disease  were  reported  for  subjects  in  the  Primary 
Safety Pool. 
Malignancy 
In the Primary Safety Pool, a total of 11 subjects reported a malignancy in the on-treatment period: 6 
subjects (0.9%) in the tezepelumab group and 5 subjects (0.7%) in the placebo group. 
Malignancies in the tezepelumab group included 2 (0.3%) subjects with basal cell carcinoma, 2 (0.3%) 
subjects with malignant melanoma in situ, 2 (0.3%) subjects with prostate cancer, and 1 (0.2%) subject 
with squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 2 subjects who developed malignant melanomas in situ, one of 
these malignancies was considered by the investigator to be causally related to tezepelumab and the 
other was not considered to be causally related to tezepelumab. However, in both instances the subjects 
had pre-existing lesions. 
Malignancies in the placebo group included 2 (0.3%) subjects with basal cell carcinoma, and 1 subject 
each (0.1%) with endometrial cancer, prostate cancer stage I, and squamous cell carcinoma of the oral 
cavity, respectively. Apart from one case of malignant melanoma in situ in the tezepelumab group (see 
above), all other malignancies were not considered to be causally related to IP by the investigator. 
In the on-study period, one additional event of malignancy was reported in the tezepelumab group: the 
event was PT pancreatic  carcinoma metastatic, reported for 1 subject (0.2%) in PATHWAY and which 
was considered not causally related to IP by the investigator. No differences in incidence were observed 
for any other malignancies between the on-treatment and on-study periods. 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 169/215 
 
 
 
Note  that  during  the  NAVIGATOR  study,  all  investigator-reported  events  of  malignancy  were  also 
assessed by an independent adjudication committee. 
Injection Site Reactions 
In the Primary Safety Pool, a total of 46 subjects experienced injection site reactions. The incidence of 
injection site reactions in both treatment groups was low (25 subjects [3.8%] and 21 subjects [3.1%], 
in the tezepelumab and placebo groups, respectively) and was balanced across injection sites. 
The most frequently reported injection site PT across all sites of injection was injection site erythema 
reported by 1.2% and 1.8% of subjects in the tezepelumab and placebo groups, respectively. 
Injection site reactions were non-serious, transient in nature, and the majority were mild in intensity. 
The majority of injection site reactions were considered to be related to IP by the investigator, 23 (3.5%) 
subjects in the tezepelumab group and 20 (3.0%) subjects in the placebo group.  
Guillain-Barré Syndrome 
A single instance of Guillain-Barré syndrome occurred in the studies of the Primary Safety Pool, occurring 
in  1  subject  (0.2%)  in  the  tezepelumab  210  mg  Q4W  treatment  group  of  PATHWAY.  The  event  was 
considered causally related to IP by the investigator, although the Sponsor considered that an alternative 
aetiology for this instance of Guillain-Barré Syndrome was a preceding viral infection.  
No other cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome were reported in any other studies of the tezepelumab clinical 
programme. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest: SOURCE 
Serious Infections 
The overall incidence of SAEs in the Infections and Infestations SOC was low in the tezepelumab (2.7%) 
and placebo groups (3.9%), respectively. None of these events were considered causally related to IP 
by the investigator, none resulted in discontinuation or withdrawal from the study, and all recovered or 
resolved. 
There  were  no  additional  SAEs  reported  in  the  Infections  and  Infestations  SOC  during  the  on-study 
period. 
Opportunistic Infections 
No events of opportunistic infections were reported in this study. 
Helminth Infections 
No events of helminth infections were reported in this study. 
Anaphylactic or Serious Allergic Reactions 
No anaphylactic reactions were reported in this study. 
Hypersensitivity Reactions 
Within the narrow SMQ for hypersensitivity, no SAEs were reported. No subjects had confirmed immune 
complex disease reported in this study. 
Malignancy 
There was one event of malignancy (PT: invasive breast carcinoma), reported in the tezepelumab group 
during the on-treatment period. The event was not considered by the investigator to be causally related

to IP. The event was adjudicated as a malignancy event by the safety evaluation committee. There were 
no additional events of malignancy reported during the on-study period. 
Injection Site Reactions 
There were no injection site reactions reported in the tezepelumab group in the study. One subject in 
the placebo group reported 3 injection site reactions during the on-treatment period (PTs injection site 
erythema, injection site nodule, injection site pruritus). The 3 AESIs were reported after administration 
of the 11th dose of placebo. 
Guillain-Barré Syndrome 
There were no events of Guillain-Barré syndrome reported in this study. 
Adrenal Crisis 
There were no reports of adrenal crisis (PT: adrenocortical insufficiency acute) in this study. A total of 3 
subjects  reported  adrenal  insufficiency  (PT:  adrenal  insufficiency)  during  the  on-treatment  period,  2 
(2.7%) in the tezepelumab group and 1 (1.3%) in the placebo group. There were no additional events 
reported during the on-study period. 
One of the 2 cases occurring in the tezepelumab arm was reported during the OCS-reduction phase when 
OCS dose was reduced to 1.25 mg daily; the subject in this case was treated by doubling the OCS dose 
to 2.5 mg daily. The second case in the tezepelumab arm was reported during the maintenance phase 
with ongoing OCS dose of zero mg daily; the subject in this case was treated with OCS dose of 2.5 mg 
daily. The single case in the placebo arm was reported at the end of the OCS-reduction phase when OCS 
daily dose was reduced to 0 mg; the subject in this case was treated with hydrocortisone at a starting 
dose of 15 mg daily. None of the events were considered by the investigator to be causally related to IP 
and all were considered to be non-serious.  
Adjudicated Events 
In the NAVIGATOR and SOURCE Phase 3 studies, potential AEs of MACE and malignancy were submitted 
for adjudication. 
In NAVIGATOR, during the on-treatment period, a total of 5 subjects in the tezepelumab group and 9 
subjects in the placebo group had any MACE or malignancy AE submitted to the SEAC. One additional 
subject in the placebo group had an event requiring adjudication during the on-study period. One subject 
in the tezepelumab group and 5 subjects in the placebo group submitted 2 AEs and 6 AEs, respectively, 
to the MACE subcommittee for adjudication. One event in each group was adjudicated as MACE. The 4 
malignancies reported in each treatment group from NAVIGATOR are included in the Primary Safety Pool 
data.  
In SOURCE, a total of 2 subjects in the tezepelumab group and 2 in the placebo group had at least one 
AE  submitted  to  the  SEAC.  Of  these,  just  one  subject  (tezepelumab  group)  had  an  AE  (PT:  invasive 
breast carcinoma) submitted to the malignancy subcommittee for adjudication and it was confirmed as 
a new malignancy. 
Other trials – not part of the primary safety pool 
PATH-HOME 
A total of 52 subjects in the APFS group (46.8%) and 55 subjects in the AI group (52.4%) reported any 
AE during the study. The most common AEs (by PT; reported for > 3% of subjects) were nasopharyngitis 
(20/216 subjects [9.3%], upper respiratory tract infections 12/216 subjects [5.6%], and asthma 10/216 
subjects [4.6%]) and were reported by a similar percentage of subjects in the APFS group and the AI 
group. The incidences of SAEs during treatment with tezepelumab were low with both devices, with a 
Assessment report

total of 3 (2.7%) SAEs observed on-treatment for subjects using the APFS and 3 (2.9%) SAEs observed 
on-treatment  using  the  AI.  Asthma  exacerbation  was  the  most  common  SAE  and  was  reported  by  3 
subjects in the AI group and no subjects in the APFS group. There were no events with outcome death.  
No SAE reported in the study with either device was considered related to IP; one SAE (described below) 
resulted in discontinuation from treatment. A total of 2 subjects in the APFS group and no subjects in 
the AI group experienced an AE that led to discontinuation of IP; neither was considered related to IP by 
the  investigator.  One  subject  experienced  an  AE  of  pain  in  extremity  (verbatim  term  reported  by  the 
investigator:  pain  in  right  upper  arm) 29  days  after  the  first  dose.  The  subject  recovered  and  the  AE 
resolved. One subject experienced an SAE of pancreatitis, 106 days after the first dose; the subject was 
discharged from hospital after 4 days, recovered and the SAE resolved. 
There were no notable findings based on assessments of pre-specified AESIs in the study. 
During the on-treatment period, the incidence of severe infections was low overall: 1 subject (0.9%) in 
the APFS group reported 3 AEs of severe infection and three subjects (2.9%) in the AI group reported 3 
AEs  of  severe  infection  during  the  on-treatment  period.  These  subjects  met  the  criteria  of  severe 
infections because their treatment included oral antiviral medications, intravenous antibiotics, or the AE 
was classified as an SAE. A total of 7 subjects (3.2%; 3 in the APFS group, 4 in the AI group) reported 
severe infections during the study; there was no trend observed among the severe infection reports. No 
subject  using  the  APFS  or  the  AI  devices  reported  an  anaphylactic  reaction.  The  number  of  subjects 
reporting AEs related to injection site reactions was low (none in the APFS group and 6 in the AI group 
[5.7%]). Most of the injection site reactions were non-serious, mild, or moderate in intensity, considered 
related  to  IP  by  the  investigator,  transient  (resolved  within  one  to  two  days),  and  did  not  result  in  a 
change to tezepelumab administration. No AESIs other than injection site reactions and severe infections 
were reported. 
In line with the known pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of tezepelumab, mean eosinophil counts decreased 
from baseline to end of treatment in the APFS and AI groups. There were no other clinically meaningful 
trends  in  haematology,  clinical  chemistry,  urinalysis,  vital  sign,  or  physical  examination  values  and 
variables over time during the study. No subject met Hy’s Law criteria. 
No AEs associated with device malfunction were reported during this study. In summary, according to 
the applicant, tezepelumab 210 mg administered Q4W SC via APFS or AI device in clinic or an at-home 
setting  was  well  tolerated  in  adults  and  adolescents  with  severe  inadequately  controlled  asthma.  The 
safety profile of 210 mg Q4W SC was consistent with that seen in other tezepelumab studies that used 
the single-dose vial presentation. 
CASCADE 
CASCADE  was  a  28-week,  Phase  2  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel  arm,  placebo  controlled 
mechanistic study designed to evaluate the effect of tezepelumab on airway inflammation in adults with 
inadequately controlled asthma on inhaled corticosteroids and at least one asthma controller. Subjects 
were  randomised  1:1  to  receive  tezepelumab  210  mg  Q4W  or  placebo  and  entered  a  4-week 
screening/run-in period, followed by a 28-week treatment period, and a 12-week follow-up period. Blood 
and  bronchoalveolar  lavage  (BAL)  samples  for  PK  and  blood  samples  for  ADA  and  nAb,  biomarker 
analyses were collected pre-dose at randomisation, and Weeks 12 (PK only) and 28 (end of treatment) 
and at the end of follow-up. 
The  CASCADE  study  population  represented  adult  subjects  with  inadequately  controlled  moderate  to 
severe asthma. Inclusion criteria required that subjects be treated with MD or HD ICS and have an ACQ-
6 score ≥ 1.5. A total of 116 subjects were randomised and included in the analyses; 59 subjects were 
randomised to receive 210 mg tezepelumab and 57 to receive placebo. A total of 112 subjects completed 
Assessment report

treatment: 56 subjects (94.9%) in the tezepelumab group and 56 subjects (98.2%) in the placebo group, 
respectively), and 114 subjects completed the study.  
The  incidence  of  on-treatment  adverse  events  was  similar  in  the  tezepelumab  (84.7%)  and  placebo 
(89.5%) groups. No subjects (0%) in the tezepelumab group and 10.5% of subjects in the placebo group 
had  SAEs.  There  were  no  fatal  outcomes.  No  subjects  (0%)  in  the  tezepelumab  group  and  1  subject 
(1.8%)  in  the  placebo  group  had  an  on-treatment  AE  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  investigational 
product.  The  most  commonly  reported  AEs  by  PT  (≥  10%  in  either  treatment  group)  were 
nasopharyngitis (32.2% in the tezepelumab group versus 31.6% in the placebo group), post-procedural 
complication (16.9% versus 19.3%), headache 10.2% versus 14.0%), and oropharyngeal pain (10.2% 
versus 3.5%). The incidence of AESIs in both the tezepelumab and the placebo groups was low. There 
was one SAE of severe infection (no events in the tezepelumab group and one in the placebo group), 
one event of opportunistic infection (no events in the tezepelumab group and one in the placebo group), 
one  SAE  of  malignancy  (no  events  in  the  tezepelumab  group  and  one  in  the  placebo  group),  and  9 
subjects  reported  injection  site  reactions  (7  subjects  in  the  tezepelumab  group  and  2  subjects  in  the 
placebo group). There were no reports of other AESIs (helminth infections, hypersensitivity reactions, 
anaphylactic reaction, or Guillain-Barré Syndrome). 
Other  than  the  expected  effects  of  lowering  blood  eosinophil  counts  and  total  serum  IgE  level  from 
baseline based on the known PD effects of tezepelumab, there were no clinically meaningful observations 
for haematology or clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and no clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or 
ECG findings in the study. 
Overall, there were no meaningful differences in the safety results between the tezepelumab and placebo 
groups  and  the  safety  profile  of  tezepelumab  210  mg  Q4W  observed  in  this  mechanistic  study  was 
consistent with that observed in other tezepelumab studies.  
Phase 1 Studies 
Overall, tezepelumab was found to be well tolerated in subjects tested in the Phase 1 studies in which 
tezepelumab was administered as single or multiple doses IV up to 700 mg, as single SC doses up to 
420 mg, and as multiple SC doses up to 210 mg Q7D. No deaths were reported in these studies. There 
were few TESAEs and few withdrawals due to TEAEs, and the majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate 
in severity. In addition, it is noted that in the PATH-BRIDGE study, the safety and tolerability profile of 
single  SC  doses  of  tezepelumab  administered  using  APFS  or  AI  in  healthy  subjects  was  found  to  be 
similar to that of tezepelumab when administered using the vial-and-syringe method with no additional 
safety concerns raised. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Primary safety pool  
Overall, 144 out of 1334 subjects experienced SAEs, including those with an outcome of death, during 
the  on-treatment  period  of  the  studies  in  the  Primary  Safety  Pool.  The  overall  incidence  of  subjects 
experiencing SAEs during the on-treatment period was 8.6% in the tezepelumab group and 13.0% in 
the placebo group. 
The  most  common  SAEs by  SOC  in  the  tezepelumab  group  occurred  in  the  Respiratory,  Thoracic  and 
Mediastinal  Disorders  SOC  (15  subjects  [2.3%])  and  Infections  and  Infestations  SOC  (13  subjects 
[2.0%]).  The  incidence  of  SAEs  by  SOC  was  generally  balanced  between  treatment  groups,  with  the 
exception  SAEs  in  the  Respiratory,  Thoracic  and  Mediastinal  Disorders  SOC  that  were  reported  by  15 
(2.3%) subjects in the tezepelumab group and 49 (7.3%) subjects in the placebo group, a difference 
driven mainly by the incidence of SAEs of PT asthma. 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 173/215 
 
 
 
The most common SAE by PT in both treatment groups was asthma, reported by 15 subjects (2.3%) in 
the tezepelumab group and 46 subjects (6.9%) in the placebo group. Apart from the SAE of asthma, no 
SAE PT was reported in > 2 subjects in the tezepelumab group. For the placebo group, the only SAE PT 
reported in > 2 subjects was cellulitis, reported in 3 (0.4%) of subjects. The incidences of SAEs during 
the on-study period were similar to those in the on-treatment period. 
The  majority  (133  out  of  144)  of  subjects  experiencing  SAEs  in  the  Primary  Safety  Pool  experienced 
SAEs that were not considered related to IP as assessed by the investigator. The proportion of subjects 
with SAEs considered causally related to IP by the investigator was low across the tezepelumab (0.9% 
[6 subjects]) and placebo (0.7% [5 subjects]) groups.  
Of the SAEs considered causally related to IP by the investigator, none occurred in more than 1 subject 
in either treatment group except for the SAE of asthma which occurred in 2 (0.3%) tezepelumab-treated 
subjects  and  none  (0.0%)  of  the  placebo-treated  subjects.  Other  SAEs  in  the  tezepelumab  group 
considered causally related to IP  by the investigator were malignant melanoma in situ,  Guillain-Barré 
syndrome, migraine, myositis, and upper respiratory tract infection (1 subject [0.2%] for each event). 
SAEs assigned as causally related to IP by the investigator in the placebo group were blood creatinine 
phosphokinase increased, lung abscess, muscle necrosis, polyarthritis, and seizure (1 subject [0.1%] for 
each). 
There were no additional SAEs occurring during the on-study period that were considered related to IP 
by the investigator. 
In the Primary Safety Pool, a total of 18 subjects had SAEs leading to discontinuation of IP; 6 subjects 
(0.9%) in the tezepelumab group and 12 (1.8%) in the placebo group. The most common SAE leading 
to discontinuation of IP was asthma, reported by 3 subjects (0.4%) in the placebo group, and none in 
the tezepelumab group. 
SOURCE 
The reported incidence of subjects with SAEs was 14.9% in the tezepelumab group and 21.1% in the 
placebo  group  in  the  on-treatment  period.  None  of  the  SAEs  reported  in  the  tezepelumab  arm  were 
considered related to IP by the investigator; 1 subject in the placebo arm reported an SAE of headache 
which was considered related to IP by the investigator. 
The  most  common  SAE  in  both  treatment  groups  was  asthma,  reported  by  2  (2.7%)  subjects  in  the 
tezepelumab group and 8 (10.5%) subjects in the placebo group. Apart from asthma, no SAE PT was 
reported in > 1 subject in the tezepelumab group. 
The incidence of SAEs was similar for the on-study period. A total of 4 subjects discontinued treatment 
with IP due to an SAE, 2 (2.7%) in the tezepelumab group (PTs: invasive breast carcinoma and acute 
kidney injury) and 2 (2.6%) in the placebo group (PTs: headache and arthritis). 
Deaths 
In  the  11  studies  comprising  the  tezepelumab  severe  asthma  clinical  development  programme  there 
were few deaths. 
A total of 4 deaths occurred, 2 in tezepelumab-treated subjects and 2 in placebo-treated subjects. All 4 
deaths are summarised below with relevant data on their treatment history in the study, including the 
investigator’s assessment on the likelihood of a causal relationship between death and IP. Of these 4 
deaths, 3 were considered not related to IP by the investigator and by the Sponsor, and the remaining 
death was considered related to IP by the investigator but not considered related by the Sponsor. 
• 
In the Primary Safety Pool, no AEs with an outcome of death occurred in the tezepelumab 210 
mg Q4W group in the on-study period. Two (0.3%) subjects in the placebo group experienced 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 174/215 
 
 
 
AEs with an outcome of death in the on-study period; both subjects were from the NAVIGATOR 
study. The AEs with an outcome of death (PT: Death; PT: Cardiac failure) were not considered 
to be causally related to IP by the investigator. 
• 
In the PATHWAY study, one (0.3%) subject in the tezepelumab 70 mg Q4W group had an AE 
with outcome of death (PT: Cerebrovascular accident). This event occurred in the on-study period 
during  follow-up,  67  days  after  the  subject  received  their  last  active  dose  of  IP.  This  event 
involved a 74-year-old female who had a serious life-threatening AE of pneumonia 6 days prior 
to the event of Cerebrovascular accident but refused hospitalisation and no additional information 
was  provided.  This  event  was  considered  causally  related  to  IP  by  the  investigator.  However, 
based on the available data, the Sponsor assessed the event as not related to IP. 
• 
In SOURCE, there was one AE with outcome death (1.4% of subjects) in the tezepelumab 210 
mg  Q4W  group  during  the  on-treatment  period  (PT:  Cardiac  arrest).  The  subject’s  relevant 
medical history included angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, pulmonary 
hypertension  and  obesity.  Previously,  the  subject  suffered  a  non-fatal  SAE  of  cardiac  failure 
(NYHA  III),  16  days  after  dose  4  of  tezepelumab,  for  which  the  subject  was  hospitalised  and 
subsequently discharged. Eighteen days after dose 7 of tezepelumab, the subject experienced 
an SAE of cardiac arrest that was fatal and led to death one day later, 19 days after the last dose 
of tezepelumab. The primary cause of death was multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The SAE 
was not considered by the investigator to be causally related to IP. According to the applicant, 
the evaluation of data regarding these fatal AEs did not raise cause for concern for the use of 
tezepelumab in the treatment of asthma. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory data were not pooled across studies. Thus, for the purposes of this safety evaluation, 
an  overview  of  relevant  data  are  provided  below  for  the  confirmatory  Phase  3  and  Phase  2b  studies, 
NAVIGATOR and PATHWAY, supported by data from the Phase 3, OCS-reducing study SOURCE.  
In  NAVIGATOR  and  PATHWAY,  respectively,  tezepelumab  reduced  blood  eosinophil  counts  and  total 
serum IgE from baseline compared with placebo, consistent with the known pharmacodynamic effects 
of tezepelumab. Other than these changes, there were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline in 
haematology and clinical  chemistry parameters with tezepelumab treatment. There were no apparent 
changes from baseline in IgA, IgG, or IgM. The incidence of AE PTs related to haematology and clinical 
chemistry was low and similar across treatment groups in each study. 
Consistent  with  the  findings  from  the  evaluation  of  the  NAVIGATOR  and  PATHWAY  studies  data,  the 
incidence  of  AE  PTs  related  to  abnormalities  in  haematology  and  clinical  chemistry  parameters  in  the 
Primary  Safety  Pool  was  low  and  similar  across  the  tezepelumab  210  mg  and  placebo  groups, 
respectively. 
Evaluation of clinical laboratory data for SOURCE provided findings consistent with that of NAVIGATOR 
and PATHWAY described above. In SOURCE, other than the expected changes in blood eosinophil counts 
and total serum IgE level, there were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline in haematology and 
clinical chemistry parameters with tezepelumab treatment in this study. There were no apparent changes 
from baseline in IgA, or IgM; there was a slight, non-clinically meaningful increase in IgG. The incidence 
of  AE  PTs  related  to  abnormalities  in  haematology  and  clinical  chemistry  was  low  and  similar  across 
tezepelumab and placebo treatment groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 175/215 
 
 
 
There  were  no  instances  of  potential  Hy’s  Law  cases  identified  in  any  of  the  completed  tezepelumab 
clinical studies. There were no clinically meaningful shifts over time in urinalysis parameters in any of 
the Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies. 
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
Vital signs, ECG and physical findings/other observations data were not pooled across studies. Thus, for 
the  purposes  of  this  safety  evaluation  an  overview  of  relevant  data  are  provided  below  for  the 
confirmatory  Phase  3  and  Phase  2b  studies,  NAVIGATOR  and  PATHWAY,  supported  by  data  from  the 
Phase 3, OCS-reducing study SOURCE. 
In NAVIGATOR and PATHWAY, respectively, there were no clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or 
ECG shifts over time and no meaningful differences between the tezepelumab and placebo groups. The 
incidence of AE PTs related to abnormalities in vital signs was low and similar across treatment groups 
in  each  of  the  respective  studies.  The  incidence  of  AE  PTs  related  to  ECG  abnormalities  was  low  and 
similar across treatment groups in each of the respective studies. 
Consistent  with  the  evaluation  of  AE  data  from  NAVIGATOR  and  PATHWAY,  the  incidence  of  AE  PTs 
related to abnormalities in vital signs or ECG in the Primary Safety Pool was low and similar across the 
tezepelumab 210 mg and placebo groups, respectively. 
Evaluation of ECG and vital signs data from SOURCE provided findings consistent with that of NAVIGATOR 
and PATHWAY described above. In SOURCE, there were no clinically meaningful changes in vital signs 
or ECG shifts over time and no meaningful differences between the tezepelumab and placebo groups. 
The incidence of AE PTs related to abnormalities in vital signs was low and similar across tezepelumab 
and placebo treatment groups. The incidence of AE PTs related to ECG abnormalities was low and similar 
across tezepelumab and placebo treatment groups. 
In general, due to their large size and high target specificity, mAbs such as tezepelumab have a very 
low likelihood for ion channel interactions and therefore thorough QT/QTc studies were not performed 
by the applicant. In accordance with guidance provided in the ICH E14 Questions and Answers (CHMP 
2016), a formal tQT clinical study was not conducted for tezepelumab as there were no relevant non-
clinical findings, no mechanistic rationale, and no relevant findings from limited ECG/AE data evaluated 
in clinical studies (described above). 
In  NAVIGATOR,  PATHWAY,  and  SOURCE,  there  were  no  abnormal  findings  in  physical  examination 
observations from baseline to the last observation post-baseline and no notable differences in physical 
examination shifts across tezepelumab and placebo arms in the respective studies. 
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
The following subsections present Primary Safety Pool AE data evaluated by clinically relevant intrinsic 
factor subgroups. Subgroup analyses were based on AEs reported during the on-treatment period. 
Note that due to low numbers of subjects in some subgroups, and low numbers of subjects with an AE 
in some subgroups, these data presentations should be interpreted with caution. In general, the safety 
profile of tezepelumab was similar in all subgroups of subjects defined by the intrinsic factors evaluated. 
No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the frequency or pattern of AEs in subgroups based 
on intrinsic factors evaluated for up to 1 year of tezepelumab treatment. 
Effect of Baseline Blood Eosinophil Count 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 176/215 
 
 
 
The safety profile of tezepelumab in the Primary Safety Pool was summarised in terms of AE categories 
by baseline blood eosinophil count (≥ 300 cells/μL, < 300 cells/μL) for AEs in the on-treatment period. 
The number of subjects in each baseline blood eosinophil count category was as follows: 
≥ 300 cells/μL, N = 286 in the tezepelumab group and N = 287 in the placebo group; 
< 300 cells/μL, N = 379 in the tezepelumab group and N = 382 in the placebo group. 
The safety profile of tezepelumab was generally similar in subjects regardless of baseline blood eosinophil 
count for up to 1 year of treatment. No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the frequency 
or pattern of AEs. 
Effect of Allergic Status 
The safety profile of tezepelumab in the Primary Safety Pool is summarised in terms of AE categories by 
allergic  status  (as  determined  by  a  perennial  aeroallergen-specific  IgE)  for  AEs  in  the  on-treatment 
period. The safety profile of tezepelumab is generally similar in subjects regardless of allergic status for 
up to 1 year of treatment. No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the frequency or pattern 
of AEs. 
Effect of Age 
The safety profile of tezepelumab in the Primary Safety Pool was summarised in terms of AE categories 
by age (≥ 12 to < 18 [adolescents], ≥ 18 to < 65, and ≥ 65 years) for AEs in the on-treatment period. 
The number of subjects in each age category were as follows:  
82 adolescents (N = 41 in both the tezepelumab and placebo groups, respectively);  
1039 subjects ≥ 18 to < 65 years of age (N = 505 and N = 534 in the tezepelumab and placebo groups, 
respectively);  
and 213 subjects ≥ 65 years (N = 119 and N = 94 in the tezepelumab and placebo groups, respectively).  
The safety profile of tezepelumab was generally similar in subjects regardless of age for up to 1 year of 
treatment.  No  clinically  meaningful  differences  were  observed  in  the  frequency  or  pattern  of  AEs  for 
adolescents or subjects ≥ 65 years when compared with subjects ≥ 18 to < 65. 
At CHMP’s request, the applicant provided further information regarding the elderly population.  
In the Primary Safety Pool (NAVIGATOR and PATHWAY studies), only subjects aged 12 through 80 
years at the time of screening met the inclusion criteria for the studies (NAVIGATOR enrolled subjects 
12 to 80 years of age, PATHWAY enrolled subjects 18 to 75 years of age). Accordingly, there were no 
subjects in the Primary Safety Pool corresponding to the age category ≥ 85, and the age category ≥ 
75 to 84 contains no subjects > 80 years of age. 
In the Primary Safety Pool, a total of 213 out of 1334 (16.0%) subjects were ≥ 65 years of age, 
including 119 out of 665 (17.9%) subjects who received tezepelumab 210 mg SC Q4W and 94 
out of 669 (14.1%) subjects who received placebo. 
The subgroup analysis of age indicated that the safety profile of tezepelumab was generally similar in 
subjects regardless of age for up to 1 year of treatment based on evaluation of AEs, SAEs and 
discontinuations due to AE by age subgroup. No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the 
frequency or pattern of AEs for subjects ≥ 65 years when compared with subjects ≥ 18 to < 65.  
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 177/215 
 
 
 
The additional summary of AEs requested by the CHMP is presented in Table 65 based on the Primary 
Safety Pool for the age groups with available data. It is the applicant’s view that these data support 
that the safety profile of tezepelumab is generally similar in subjects regardless of age. 
The analysis of AEs did not suggest elderly patients in the tezepelumab group were more at risk of any 
particular type of AE than elderly patients in the placebo group. However, any conclusions concerning 
specific type of events should be interpreted with caution given the limited number of events observed 
for subjects in these relatively small subgroups.

Effect of Gender 
The safety profile of tezepelumab in the Primary Safety Pool was summarised in terms of AE categories 
by  gender  (male,  female)  for  AEs  in  the  on-treatment  period.  The  safety  profile  of  tezepelumab  was 
generally similar in subjects regardless of gender for up to 1 year of treatment. No clinically meaningful 
differences were observed in the frequency or pattern of AEs. 
Effect of Race 
The safety profile of tezepelumab in the Primary Safety Pool was summarised in terms of AE categories 
by race (White, Black or African American, Asian, Other) for AEs in the on-treatment period. The safety 
profile of tezepelumab was generally similar in subjects regardless of race for up to 1 year of treatment. 
No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the frequency or pattern of AEs. 
Effect of BMI 
The safety profile of tezepelumab in the Primary Safety Pool was summarised in terms of AE categories 
by BMI for AEs in the on-treatment period by category. 
The number of subjects in each BMI category was as follows:  
< 18.5 kg/m2, N = 11 in the tezepelumab group and N = 12 in the placebo group;  
18.5 to > 25.0 kg/m2, N = 196 in the tezepelumab group and N = 222 in the placebo group;  
25.0 to ≤ 30 kg/m2, N = 224 in the tezepelumab group and N = 210 in the placebo group;  
> 30 kg/m2, N = 234 in the tezepelumab group and N = 225 in the placebo group. 
The safety profile of tezepelumab was generally similar in subjects regardless of BMI for up to 1 year of 
treatment. No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the frequency or pattern of AEs. 
Effect of Hepatic Impairment on Pharmacokinetics of Tezepelumab 
No  formal  clinical  studies  have  been  conducted  to  investigate  the  effect  of  hepatic  impairment  on 
tezepelumab.  IgG  monoclonal  antibodies  are  not  primarily  cleared  via  the  hepatic  pathway,  thus  the 
applicant  considered  that  change  in  hepatic  function  was  not  expected  to  influence  tezepelumab 
clearance.  The  results  of  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis,  including  measures  of  baseline  hepatic 
function  (alanine  aminotransferase,  aspartate  aminotransferase,  and  total  bilirubin),  suggested  that 
hepatic impairment did not impact the clearance of tezepelumab. 
Effect of Renal Impairment on Pharmacokinetics of Tezepelumab 
No  formal  clinical  studies  have  been  conducted  to  investigate  the  effect  of  renal  impairment  on 
tezepelumab. As a typical IgG2 mAb, tezepelumab is not cleared renally due to its large molecular weight. 
Assessment report

Population  PK  analysis  included  1008  subjects  with  normal  creatinine  clearance  (CRCL)  values  (≥  90 
mL/min),  320  subjects  with  mild  renal  impairment  (CRCL  =  60  to  89  mL/min),  and  38  subjects  with 
moderate  renal  impairment  (CRCL  =  30  to  59  mL/min);  there  was  no  subject  with  severe  renal 
impairment  (CRCL  =  15  to  29  mL/min).  The  results  of  the  population  PK  analysis  suggest  that  renal 
impairment did not impact the clearance of tezepelumab. 
Extrinsic Factors 
The following subsections present Primary Safety Pool AE data evaluated by clinically relevant extrinsic 
factor subgroups. Subgroup analyses were based on AEs reported during the on-treatment period. 
In  general,  the  safety  profile  of  tezepelumab  was  similar  in  all  subgroups  of  subjects  defined  by  the 
extrinsic factors evaluated. No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the frequency or pattern 
of AEs in subgroups based on extrinsic factors evaluated for up to 1 year of tezepelumab treatment. 
Effect of OCS use at Baseline 
The safety profile of tezepelumab in the Primary Safety Pool was summarised in terms of AE categories 
by baseline OCS use (present, absent) for AEs in the on-treatment period. Summaries of AEs, SAEs, and 
DAEs in the on-treatment period by baseline OCS use were presented by SOC and PT. The number of 
subjects  in  each  OCS  use  at  baseline  category  was  as  follows:  OCS  use  present,  N  =  58  in  the 
tezepelumab  group  and  N  =  65  in  the  placebo  group;  OCS  use  absent,  N  =  607  in  the  tezepelumab 
group and N = 604 in the placebo group. 
For subjects with baseline OCS use ‘present’, the incidence of subjects with at least one AE was 94.8% 
and 90.8%, respectively, in the tezepelumab and placebo treatment groups. For subjects with baseline 
OCS use ‘absent’, the incidence of subjects with at least one AE was 72.7% and 75.0%, respectively, in 
the  tezepelumab  and  placebo  treatment  groups.  For  subjects  with  baseline  OCS  use  ‘present’,  the 
incidence of subjects with at least one SAE was 22.4% and 35.4%, respectively, in the tezepelumab and 
placebo treatment groups. For subjects with baseline OCS use ‘absent’, the incidence of subjects with at 
least one SAE was 7.2% and 10.6%, respectively, in the tezepelumab and placebo treatment groups. 
The safety profile of tezepelumab was generally similar in subjects regardless of baseline OCS use for 
up to 1 year of treatment. No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the frequency or pattern 
of AEs 
Effect of Baseline ICS Dose 
The safety profile of tezepelumab in the Primary Safety Pool was summarised in terms of AE categories 
by baseline ICS dose for AEs in the on-treatment period.  
The number of subjects in each baseline ICS dose category was as follows: High ICS, N = 464 in the 
tezepelumab group and N = 463 in the placebo group; Medium ICS, N = 201 in the tezepelumab group 
and N = 205 in the placebo group. For subjects with baseline status ‘High ICS’, the incidence of subjects 
with  at  least  one  AE  was  76.7%  and  79.3%,  respectively,  in  the  tezepelumab  and  placebo  treatment 
groups. For subjects with baseline status ‘Medium ICS’, the incidence of subjects with at least one AE 
was 69.7% and 70.2%, respectively, in the tezepelumab and placebo treatment groups. 
For subjects with baseline status ‘High ICS’, the incidence of subjects with at least one SAE was 9.7% 
and 14.7%, respectively, in the tezepelumab and placebo treatment groups. For subjects with baseline 
status ‘Medium ICS’, the incidence of subjects with at least one SAE was 6.0% and 8.8%, respectively, 
in the tezepelumab and placebo treatment groups. 
The safety profile of tezepelumab was generally similar in subjects regardless of baseline ICS dose for 
up to 1 year of treatment. No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the frequency or pattern 
of AEs.

Effect of Region 
The safety profile of tezepelumab in the Primary Safety Pool was summarised in terms of AE categories 
by geographic region (Asia Pacific, Eastern Europe, Europe, North America, and the Rest of the World) 
for AEs in the on-treatment period. No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the frequency 
or pattern of AEs. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
No tezepelumab clinical study has been conducted in pregnant or lactating women. 
Monoclonal  antibodies,  such  as  tezepelumab,  are  transported  across  the  placenta  as  pregnancy 
progresses (Palmeira et al 2012, Pentsuk and van der Laan 2009); therefore, potential effects on a foetus 
are likely to be greater during the second and third trimester of pregnancy. 
In the maternal, embryo-foetal, and neonatal toxicity study, pregnant female cynomolgus monkeys were 
dosed  IV  at  50  or  300  mg/kg/week  from  early  gestation  through  delivery.  There  were  no  effects  of 
tezepelumab  on  maternal  health,  pregnancy  outcome,  embryo-foetal  development,  or  neonatal 
development  up  to  6.5  months  of  age.  The  data  on  pregnancy  exposure  from  the  clinical  studies  are 
insufficient to inform on drug associated risk. 
Eleven patients in the confirmatory asthma exacerbation studies reported pregnancies, 4 in PATHWAY 
(2 in the tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W group and 2 in the tezepelumab 280 mg Q2W group, all occurred 
during  the  on-treatment  period)  and  7  in  NAVIGATOR  (3  in  the  tezepelumab  210  mg  Q4W  group  [2 
during the on-treatment period] and 4 in the placebo group [2 during the on-treatment period]). Seven 
patients delivered healthy, full-term infants. One patient in the PATHWAY tezepelumab 280 mg group 
delivered  pre-term  twins  after  experiencing  an  SAE  of  pre-eclampsia.  One  patient  in  the  PATHWAY 
tezepelumab  280  mg  group  was  reported  to  have  a  spontaneous  abortion  at  11  weeks  into  the 
pregnancy. Two patients in NAVIGATOR were reported to have had spontaneous abortions at 6 and 9 
weeks into the pregnancies, respectively, both patients were in the tezepelumab 210 mg group, of which 
one  became  pregnant  during  the  on-treatment  period.  No  further  information  was  provided  for  the  3 
patients who had spontaneous abortions. No pregnancies were reported in any of the other completed 
tezepelumab asthma clinical studies. 
In SmPC section 4.6, it is recommended not to use tezepelumab during pregnancy unless the expected 
benefit to the pregnant mother is greater than any possible risk to the foetus. 
Non-clinical studies of tezepelumab indicate that the possibility of test article transfer from the maternal 
animal  to  the  infant  via  milk  cannot  be  excluded.  It  is  unknown  whether  tezepelumab  is  excreted  in 
human milk. 
No  fertility  studies  have  been  conducted  with  tezepelumab  in  humans  or  animals.  In  repeat-dose 
toxicology  studies  with  tezepelumab  in  sexually  mature  cynomolgus  monkeys  of  up  to  a  6-month 
duration, based on indirect assessments of potential effects on fertility there were no notable effects of 
tezepelumab on the female or male reproductive organs. This information has been adequately reflected 
in SmPC section 4.6. 
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events 
Immune  responses  to  biotherapeutics  are  commonly  monitored  by  the  assessment  of  ADA.  ADAs  to 
tezepelumab were assessed using a 3-tier approach: screen (detection), confirm (specificity), and where 
appropriate,  titer  (semi-quantitation).  Confirmed  ADA-positive  samples  were  further  tested,  where 
appropriate, in a ligand-binding sandwich immunoassay, in which ADA was tested for ability to interfere 
(neutralise) with the interaction of the drug with TSLP in vitro. 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 181/215 
 
 
 
In  a  total  of  4  out  of  the  6  Phase  1  studies,  no  subjects  developed  ADA  after  receiving  tezepelumab 
(Studies  0620,  0390,  0003,  and  1183).  In  the  Phase  1  study  conducted  in  adolescents  with  asthma 
(D5180C00002), 1 subject (5%) tested positive for ADA pre-dose and at all time points; however, this 
subject tested negative for neutralising antibodies and the presence of antibodies did not have an impact 
on  the  PK.  In  PATH-BRIDGE,  ADAs  were  detected  in  10/314  (3.2%)  subjects;  there  was no  apparent 
effect of ADA on PK and no injection site reactions were reported in ADA-positive subjects in this study. 
Evaluation of the potential impact of treatment-emergent ADA on safety of tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W is 
presented below based on review of AEs and SAEs for NAVIGATOR. Additional summary information from 
PATHWAY,  SOURCE,  PATH-HOME,  and  CASCADE  on  the  prevalence  of  ADA  in  each  study  is  also 
presented. The definition of treatment-emergent ADA employed in NAVIGATOR, SOURCE, PATH-HOME, 
and  CASCADE  was  as  follows:  detectable  ADA  post-treatment  with  no  detectable  ADA  at  baseline,  or 
baseline ADA titre that was boosted to a 4-fold or higher-level following IP administration. In PATHWAY, 
ADA titre was not measured, therefore the incidence of treatment-emergent ADA was not calculated; for 
this study, summary data for subjects with any positive post-baseline ADA result are presented below. 
In NAVIGATOR, a total of 10 out of 522 (1.9%) tezepelumab-treated subjects and 20 out of 523 (3.8%) 
placebo-treated  subjects  had  treatment-emergent  ADA;  2  subjects  (1  in  each  treatment  group) 
developed  neutralising  ADA  in  the  study.  There  was  no  apparent  effect  of  ADA-positive  status  on  the 
safety  of  tezepelumab  (type  and  number  of  AEs/SAEs)  observed  in  this  study,  however,  further 
analysis/assessment was difficult due to limited numbers of ADA-positive subjects. Based on NAVIGATOR 
data, there was no observed trend suggesting a correlation between the presence of ADA to tezepelumab 
and the occurrence of hypersensitivity or injection site reactions events. 
In PATHWAY, a total of 9 out of 402 (2.2%) tezepelumab-treated subjects (across all dose groups) and 
13 out of 138 (9.4%) placebo-treated subjects had any positive post-baseline ADA result. The incidence 
of subjects with any positive post-baseline ADA result in each of the tezepelumab dose groups were as 
follows: 5 out of 137 (3.6%) subjects in the 70 mg Q4W group, one out of 132 (0.8%) subjects in the 
210 mg Q4W group, and 3 out of 133 (2.3%) subjects in the 280 mg Q2W group compared with 13 out 
of 138 (9.4%) in the placebo group. No subjects developed neutralising ADA in the study. 
In SOURCE, 1 out of 73 (1.4%) tezepelumab-treated subjects and none out of 76 (0.0%) placebo-treated 
subjects had treatment-emergent ADA; no subjects developed neutralising ADA in the study.  
In PATH-HOME, a total of 2 out of 111 (1.8%) of subjects in the APFS group and 8 out of 105 (7.6%) of 
subjects  in  the  AI  group  had  treatment-emergent  ADA.  The  presence  of  neutralising  ADA  was  not 
evaluated in this study. 
In  CASCADE,  a  total  of  zero  out  of  59  (0.0%)  tezepelumab-treated  subjects  and  2  out  of  55  (3.6%) 
placebo-treated  subjects  had  treatment-emergent  ADA.  The  presence  of  neutralising  ADA  was  not 
evaluated in this study. 
In  summary,  in  the  5  phase  2  and  3  studies,  the  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  ADA  in  subjects 
treated with tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W was low (ranging from 0% to 1.9%). In addition, there was no 
apparent  effect  of  ADA-positive  status  on  the  safety  of  tezepelumab  (type  and  number  of  AEs/SAEs) 
observed in NAVIGATOR, however, further analysis/assessment was difficult due to the limited number 
of ADA-positive subjects. 
2.6.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  formal  drug-drug  interaction  studies  have  been  conducted  with  tezepelumab.  As  a  typical  IgG 
monoclonal  antibody,  tezepelumab  is  not  primarily  cleared  via  hepatic  pathways.  Therefore,  small 
molecule  drugs  that  induce  or  inhibit  the  cytochrome  P450  pathways  are  not  expected  to  affect  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 182/215 
 
 
 
pharmacokinetics  of  tezepelumab.  Population  PK  analysis  indicated  that  commonly  co-administered 
asthma  medications  (including  theophylline/aminophylline,  montelukast,  and  OCS)  had  no  effect  on 
tezepelumab PK. Due to its large molecular size, tezepelumab is not expected to directly induce or inhibit 
the cytochrome P450 enzymes and is therefore not expected to lead to altered PK of small molecules 
metabolised by these enzymes. 
Given  that  tezepelumab  selectively  blocks  TSLP,  an  epithelial  cytokine  and  upstream  regulator  of  the 
inflammatory cascade, the potential risk of cytokine mediated therapeutic protein-drug interactions as 
result  of  TSLP  inhibition  was  evaluated  based  on  available  data  in  literature  and  clinical  studies.  In 
summary, TSLP inhibition by tezepelumab is not expected to cause therapeutic protein-drug interaction 
in  vivo  by  altering  cytochrome  P450  enzyme  activities  through  either  direct  or  indirect  effects  by 
modulating downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines. 
Based on these evaluations, the applicant concluded that the potential for clinically relevant therapeutic 
protein-drug interactions involving tezepelumab either as a victim or perpetrator are assessed to be low 
for the intended population of subjects with severe asthma. 
2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, 33 of 1334 subjects had AEs leading to discontinuation of IP in the Primary Safety Pool. A total 
of 13 (2.0%) subjects in the tezepelumab group and 20 (3.0%) subjects in the placebo group had AEs 
leading to discontinuation of IP.  
In  the  tezepelumab  treatment  group,  no  PT  for  an  AE  leading  to  discontinuation  was  reported  in  >  2 
subjects. In the placebo group, the only PT for an AE leading to discontinuation reported in > 2 subjects 
was asthma, reported by 4 subjects (0.6%).  
In the Primary Safety Pool, a total of 18 subjects had SAEs leading to discontinuation of IP; 6 subjects 
(0.9%) in the tezepelumab group and 12 (1.8%) in the placebo group. The most common SAE leading 
to discontinuation of IP was asthma, reported by 3 subjects (0.4%) in the placebo group, and none in 
the tezepelumab group. 
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of IP - Investigator’s Causality Assessment 
The overall proportion of AEs leading to discontinuation of IP that were considered causally related to IP 
by the investigator was low in both treatment groups 6 subjects [0.9%] in the tezepelumab group and 
8 subjects [1.2%] in the placebo group. 
All  of  the  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  IP  that  were  considered  causally  related  to  IP  by  the 
investigator were reported at an incidence of 1 subject per preferred term. 
Discontinuations of Investigational Product Due to Adverse Events: SOURCE 
In SOURCE, the overall incidence of IP discontinuation due to AEs was similar in the tezepelumab and 
placebo groups. 
A total of 4 subjects discontinued treatment with IP, 2 (2.7%) in the tezepelumab group (PTs: invasive 
breast  carcinoma  and  acute  kidney  injury,  respectively)  and  2  (2.6%)  in  the  placebo  group  (PTs: 
headache and arthritis, respectively). All of these AEs were reported as SAEs. One event, headache in 
the  placebo  group,  was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  causally  related  to  treatment,  but  the 
Sponsor did not assess this event as causally related to IP. 
2.6.8.9.  Additional safety data 
As per CHMP’s request, the applicant submitted further safety data from the ongoing LTE DESTINATION 
study. Those are presented below.  
Study Design 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 183/215 
 
 
 
This was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, long-term 
extension study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of tezepelumab 210 mg administered 
every 4 weeks (Q4W) subcutaneously (SC) in adults and adolescents with severe uncontrolled asthma 
for up to 2 continuous years of treatment, including 1 year of treatment in predecessor studies. Subjects 
who had continued to receive investigational product (IP) and attended the end of treatment (EOT) visit 
in  one  of  the  predecessor  studies,  D5180C00007  (NAVIGATOR)  or  D5180C00009  (SOURCE),  were 
eligible to enrol into this study if they fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
The randomisation was stratified by predecessor study. All subjects were re-randomised in this study to 
maintain  the  blinding  and  were  assigned  new  enrolment  codes  in  DESTINATION,  different  from  those 
assigned in the predecessor studies. Subjects previously randomised to the 210 mg tezepelumab Q4W 
SC arm in either of the predecessor studies, were assigned to and remained on 210 mg tezepelumab 
Q4W SC dosing in this study. Subjects randomised to the placebo arm in the predecessor studies were 
re-randomised  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  either  210  mg  tezepelumab  or  placebo,  both  administered  Q4W  SC. 
Given the randomisation scheme of subjects in the predecessor studies, this was designed to give an 
overall subject distribution of 3:1 (tezepelumab:placebo). 
Target Subject Population and Sample Size 
The target  population for this study was adult and adolescent subjects with severe asthma who were 
receiving medium or high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus at least one additional asthma controller 
medication,  with  or  without  chronic  oral  corticosteroids  (OCS)  and/or  other  asthma  controllers.  The 
sample size was not based on statistical considerations but was determined by the number of subjects 
who completed the double-blind treatment period on IP in either of the predecessor studies (NAVIGATOR 
or SOURCE) and met all eligibility criteria for this study. 
Duration of Treatment 
This study consisted of a screening/randomisation visit which was the same day as the EOT visit from 
the predecessor studies NAVIGATOR (Week 52) or SOURCE (Week 48). The first dose of IP was to be 
administered the same day and the treatment period duration was 52 weeks for subjects who previously 
completed  study  NAVIGATOR,  and  56  weeks  for  subjects  who  previously  completed  study  SOURCE. 
During the treatment period, tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W or placebo was administered SC. The last dose 
of  IP  was  administered  at  Week  100  and  the  EOT  visit  was  conducted  at  Week  104.  No  IP  was 
administered at Week 104 or during the subsequent 12-week safety follow-up period which included 2 
follow up visits. Subjects who were not able to attend an on-site EOT visit in the predecessor study/Visit 
1  in  DESTINATION  due  to  the  coronavirus  2019  (COVID-19)  pandemic  were  allowed  to  roll-over  into 
DESTINATION by the end of the safety follow-up period of the predecessor study after confirmation of 
subject eligibility. For subjects who rolled over from the NAVIGATOR study, there was an option to enter 
a  36-week  extended  follow-up  period  (EFU  period)  instead  of  the  12-week  follow-up  period,  provided 
they completed IP dosing without meeting IP discontinuation (IPD) criteria during the 52-week treatment 
period in DESTINATION. This optional 36-week period included 6 EFU visits after the EOT visit. No IP 
was administered in the EFU period. Subjects who did not want to enter the EFU period completed the 
standard 12-week follow-up period as described above.  
Statistical Methods 
No formal hypothesis testing was conducted. Safety analyses were performed using the safety analysis 
set (SAF), which consisted of all subjects who were randomised and received at least one dose of IP in 
either of the predecessor studies, irrespective of their protocol adherence and continued participation in 
either of the studies, and regardless of their enrolment into the long-term extension (LTE) study. 
Study Population 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 184/215 
 
 
 
A  total  of  951  adults  and  adolescent  subjects  from  the  predecessor  studies  were  randomised  into 
DESTINATION: 827 subjects from NAVIGATOR and 124 subjects from SOURCE. At the primary database 
lock (09 December 2021), a total of 950 subjects had received treatment in DESTINATION LTE period: 
826  subjects  from  NAVIGATOR  (including  72  adolescents),  and  124  subjects  from  SOURCE  (FAS-
LTE/SAF-LTE).  One  subject  who  received  placebo  in  the  predecessor  study  NAVIGATOR  and  was 
randomised into the tezepelumab group for DESTINATION, died during the DESTINATION run-in period 
prior to receiving treatment. The DESTINATION study population represented the intended population of 
subjects  with  severe,  uncontrolled  asthma  and  subjects  with  severe,  OCS-dependent  asthma  derived 
from  its  predecessor  studies  NAVIGATOR  and  SOURCE,  respectively.  The  roll-over  of  subjects  into 
DESTINATION from the predecessor studies was high (> 90%). Of the subjects who completed treatment 
in the predecessor studies and were enrolled at sites that participated in DESTINATION (ie, excluding 
sites in Japan), 827 out of 874 (94.6%) subjects from NAVIGATOR and 124 out of 137 (90.5%) subjects 
from SOURCE rolled over into DESTINATION. 
Summary of Safety Results 
Based on pooled exposure data for subjects from both predecessor studies, a total of 839 subjects in the 
All Teze group were exposed to tezepelumab with an overall mean duration of exposure of 558.7 days 
(range:  24  to  796  days).  For  subjects  from  NAVIGATOR,  the  overall  mean  duration  of  exposure  was 
634.4 (range: 34 to 796 days) in the Rand Teze group and 481.0 (range: 29 to 800 days) in the Rand 
Pbo group. For subjects from SOURCE, the overall mean duration of exposure was 638.7 (range: 24 to 
762 days) in the Rand Teze group and 481.1 (range: 61 to 745 days) in the Rand Pbo group. 
Based  on  the  data  from  the  primary  database  lock  (09  December  2021),  the  overall  safety  profile  of 
tezepelumab for up to 104 weeks of treatment appeared unchanged relative to that in the predecessor 
studies of shorter duration. Tezepelumab was generally well tolerated for up to 104 weeks of treatment 
in subjects from both predecessor studies. Summaries of AEs by category are presented in Table 66.

Page 185/215 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 64: Adverse events in any category reported during on-treatment period for subjects from 
NAVIGATOR and SOURCE as predecessor studies (DESTINATION SAF Analysis Set) 
The exposure-adjusted incidence of AEs was generally balanced between the treatment groups based 
on either predecessor study ( 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 186/215 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 66). The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in intensity. The most frequently reported AEs 
by preferred term (PT) were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache and back pain 
(subjects from NAVIGATOR), and nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache and 
asthma (subjects from SOURCE). 
There was a numerical imbalance in deaths, with more events occurring in the tezepelumab treatment 
groups compared with placebo in the on-treatment and on-study periods. Across the predecessor 
studies and DESTINATION, exposure-adjusted incidence rates for the on-study period were 0.80 (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 0.40, 1.43) and 0.58 (95% CI 0.19, 1.34) per 100 subject years in the All Teze 
and Rand Pbo treatment groups, respectively. There were 11 deaths on tezepelumab and 5 deaths on 
placebo during the treatment period or the 12-week safety follow-up (on study). There were no 
apparent patterns in the cause of death. For subjects from NAVIGATOR, 2 deaths occurred in the 
placebo group in the predecessor study period and one subject (placebo group) died during the run-in 
period of DESTINATION prior to receiving IP (tezepelumab). In the long-term extension period, there 
were 8 deaths in the Teze+Teze group, 1 death in the Pbo+Teze group, and 2 deaths in the Pbo+Pbo 
group. 
Two deaths were also reported in the tezepelumab group from NAVIGATOR during the ongoing EFU 
period (167 days and 286 days after date of last dose of tezepelumab). Of these deaths, one death in 
the Teze+Teze group (PT colorectal cancer) was considered causally related to IP as assessed by the 
investigator but was not considered causally related by the applicant due to the patient’s medical 
history; no other deaths for subjects from NAVIGATOR were considered causally related to 
tezepelumab by the investigator. For subjects from SOURCE, one death in the Teze+Teze group 
occurred in the LTE period and 1 death occurred in the tezepelumab group in the predecessor study. 
Neither of the 2 deaths were considered causally related to IP as assessed by the investigator. Also see 
below.  
The exposure-adjusted incidence rates for SAEs were generally balanced between the tezepelumab and 
placebo treatment groups (see Table 66). In subjects from NAVIGATOR, incidences of SAEs by System 
Organ  Class  (SOC)  were  also  generally  balanced,  with  the  exception  of  the  numeric  imbalance  in  the 
Cardiac  disorders  SOC  with  more  SAEs  in  the  tezepelumab  group  versus  placebo  (exposure-adjusted 
incidence rates 0.87 and 0.00 per 100 subject-years, respectively [SAF]), and SAEs in the Respiratory, 
mediastinal,  and  thoracic  disorders  SOC,  with  a  lower  event  rate  in  the  tezepelumab  group  versus 
placebo (exposure adjusted incidence rates of 1.74 and 6.29 per 100 subject-years, respectively). For 
subjects  from  SOURCE  there  was  also  a  numerical  imbalance  in  Cardiac  disorders  SOC  SAEs  for 
tezepelumab  versus  placebo  (exposure-adjusted  incidence  rate  3.09  and  0.00  per  100  subject  years, 
respectively  [SAF]),  and  SAEs  in  the  Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  SOC  (exposure-
adjusted incidence rate 2.32 and 10.00 per 100 subject-years, respectively). The imbalance in Cardiac 
disorder  SAEs  was  not  observed  in  either  predecessor  study.  There  was  no  apparent  pattern  in  the 
Cardiac disorder SOC SAEs and these SAEs were not considered by the investigator to be causally related 
to the use of tezepelumab. The observed imbalance in Respiratory, mediastinal, and thoracic disorders 
SOC,  which  is  driven  by  more  SAEs  of  asthma  in  the  placebo  group,  was  also  observed  in  both 
predecessor studies. Also see below. 
The overall exposure-adjusted incidence rates of AEs of special interest (AESIs) in the Rand Teze group 
in the on-treatment period were generally low and similar to exposure-adjusted incidence rates in the 
Rand Pbo group for subjects from both predecessor studies, with overall findings consistent with data 
from the predecessor studies. For subjects from NAVIGATOR, the overall exposure-adjusted incidence 
Assessment report

rate for severe infections was similar between the Rand Teze and Rand Pbo groups (6.87 and 7.58 per 
100 subject years, respectively) (11.9% and 10.0% of subjects, respectively), with 3.8% and 3.0% of 
subjects, respectively, reporting SAEs within the Infections and infestations SOC. Within the narrow 
standardised MedDRA query (SMQ) for hypersensitivity, the exposure-adjusted incidence of serious 
hypersensitivity reactions was similar in the Rand Teze and Rand Pbo groups (0.33 and 0.29 per 100 
subject-years; 0.6% and 0.4% of subjects, respectively). Two malignancies reported in the Rand Teze 
group (2 [0.4%] subject) were considered by the investigator to be possibly related to treatment, 
including colorectal cancer (1 [0.2%] subject) and malignant melanoma in situ (1 [0.2%] subject), 
although the subject with colorectal cancer had a confounded medical history, and the subject with 
malignant melanoma had pre-existing lesions. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate for injection site 
reactions was low overall (2.40 and 2.15 per 100 subject-years in the Rand Teze and Rand Pbo groups, 
respectively), and most were mild in intensity. One AE of PT: adrenal insufficiency, reported in the 
Rand Teze group during the LTE period, was not considered causally related to treatment by the 
investigator. 
For subjects from SOURCE, the exposure-adjusted incidence rates for severe infections were similar in 
the Rand Teze group and Rand Pbo groups (6.96 and 6.00 per 100 subject-years, respectively) (12.2% 
and 7.9% of subjects, respectively), as were the rates for SAEs within the Infections and infestations 
SOC (3.86 and 3.00 per 100 subject-years, respectively) (6.8% and 3.9% of subjects, respectively). 
Within the narrow SMQ for hypersensitivity, no SAEs of serious hypersensitivity reactions were 
reported in the on-treatment period. One malignancy was reported in the Rand Teze group; the 
malignancy was not considered to be causally related to IP by the investigator. There were no AEs of 
injection site reaction in the Rand Teze group. Two events of adrenal crisis (PT: adrenal insufficiency), 
reported in the Rand Teze group during the predecessor period, were not considered causally related 
to treatment.  
For subjects from both predecessor studies, there were no reported events of anaphylaxis causally 
related to tezepelumab, and no reports of other AESIs (opportunistic infections; helminth infections; 
Guillain-Barré syndrome). 
Other than the expected pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of tezepelumab in reducing blood eosinophils 
and serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), there were no clinically meaningful changes in clinical laboratory 
findings, including clinical chemistry parameters, haematology, or urinalysis. There were no clinically 
meaningful changes in vital signs or electrocardiogram (ECG) findings. 
Further information regarding the two main safety concerns (i.e. cardiac SAEs and death) were 
provided by the applicant upon request from the CHMP. Those are presented below and discussed in 
section 2.6.9. 
Cardiac SAEs  
In  the  Primary  Safety  Pool,  more  SAEs  were  reported  in  tezepelumab  treated  patients  compared  to 
placebo treated patients in cardiac disorders SOC, 5 (0.8%) and 2 (0.3%) respectively. Nevertheless, 
due to the low number of cardiac SAEs, taking into account the preclinical & PK data and the type of 
drug and mechanism of action, tezepelumab was not expected to cause any cardiac adverse effects. 
Across the predecessor studies and DESTINATION, there were 17 subjects with cardiac related SAEs on 
tezepelumab (n=840) and 0 subjects with events on placebo (n=607) during the on-treatment period. 
A  total  of  20  subjects  reported  23  Cardiac  disorder  SOC  SAEs  in  the  on-study  period  (including  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 188/215 
 
 
 
treatment period and the 12-week safety follow-up); 18 subjects were in the tezepelumab group and 2 
subjects  were  in  the  placebo  group.  In  total  from the  on-study  pooled  dataset,  there  were  13  events 
determined  by  the  IAC  to  be  MACE,  9  on  tezepelumab  treatment  and  4  on  placebo  treatment.  The 
applicant re-presented the fatal cardiac events in Table 67 below as 2 categories; as a fatal event within 
the cardiac disorder SOC and as a fatal event determined by the IAC. It should be noted that cardiac 
SOC fatal events are a subset of IAC-determined CV deaths, but not all CV deaths were within the Cardiac 
disorders SOC. 
Table 65: Fatal events of cardiac disorder SOC and MACE on-study in DESTINATION (subjects from 
NAVIGATOR and SOURCE, Safety Analysis Set)
With respect to AEs with fatal outcome reported during on-study period in DESTINATION study, in total 
3 cases of Fatal Cardiac disorder AEs (Cardiac arrest, Myocardial infarction, Acute left ventricular failure) 
were reported in tezepelumab treated patients (n=840) and 1 case of Fatal Cardiac disorder AEs (Cardiac 
failure)  were  reported  in  placebo  treated  patients  (n=607).  No  other  Cardiac  Disorder  SOC  Fatal  AEs 
have been observed (beyond those observed in DESTINATION) within a broader pool of studies in asthma 
assessing  210  mg  Q4W  multiple  dose,  based  on  a  total  time  at  risk  1606.2  years  across  all  treated 
subjects. There were 9 pooled MACE CV deaths recorded; 6 in All Teze and 3 in Placebo group. A 10th 
death  was  adjudicated  to  be  a  CV  death  by  the  IAC,  this  subject  (in  the  Pbo+Teze  group)  had  PT  of 
Sudden Death, which occurred 167 days after last dose of IP. The 10th CV death occurred within the 
EFU. It is the applicant’s view that there is no evidence to suggest an increased risk of fatal CV events 
with  tezepelumab  treatment.  None  of  the  cardiac  fatal  events  were  considered  causally  related  to 
tezepelumab by the investigator. 
Analyses by PTs showed no apparent pattern in types or categories of cardiac events. No particular at-
risk group has been identified by the applicant including chronic OCS therapy. OCS at baseline did not 
result in increased risk of fatal cardiac events with tezepelumab. The events occurred across different 
High Level Group Term (HLGT) categories (i.e., cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, and heart 
failures). The applicant stated again that the rate of cardiac SAEs in the placebo group is lower than the 
rate observed in severe asthma population real world setting and the company’s pooled placebo dataset 
of severe asthma subjects. The applicant also reiterated that the incidence rates of Cardiac disorder SOC 
SAEs  with  tezepelumab  were  consistent  with  what  has  been  estimated  based  on  published  data  with 
other biologics evaluated in severe asthma populations.  
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022

As there is no explanation for the observation of a numerical imbalance in cardiac disorder SOC SAEs 
and  as  there  is  no  evidence  of  an  imbalance  in  non-serious  cardiac  AEs  or  deaths,  the  applicant 
considered that this could be a chance finding.  
Further, the subject incidence rates for overall AEs (serious and non-serious AEs) were similar between 
the tezepelumab and placebo groups (Cardiac disorders SOC exposure-adjusted incidence rates 2.87, 
2.75, and 3.12 for Rand Teze, Rand Pbo, and All Teze groups respectively). There were no obvious trends 
in  the  categories  of  PTs;  none  of  the  cardiac  SAEs  were  considered  related  to  tezepelumab  based  on 
investigator  and  blinded  IAC/sponsor  causality  (one  event  was  considered  possibly  related  to  the 
placebo); all patients had risk factors for cardiac disease (high blood pressure, former smoker, diabetes, 
obesity,  age,  being  male,  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia),  and  a  number  of  patients  also  had 
confounding medical cardiac history. 
The applicant highlighted that there was no known plausible mechanism of action for tezepelumab or 
inhibition  of  TSLP  affecting  cardiac  cells;  there  were  no  significant  cardiac  findings  in  the  pre-clinical 
programme; there were no clinically significant ECG findings from the initial study programme. There 
was a small imbalance between the treatment groups in age, with a higher proportion of subjects who 
were ≥ 65 years of age in the Rand Teze group compared to the Rand Pbo group for the NAVIGATOR 
predecessor  study  (18.2%  versus  13.9%)  which  may  have  led  to  this  cohort  of  patients  having  an 
increased risk of a cardiac events. 
In addition, based on visual inspection of the Kaplan-Meier curves, there was no pattern with respect to 
time to onset for the cardiac SAEs, however an increased separation over time was observed. 
Deaths

Table 66: Adverse events with outcome of death – key subject information (subjects from NAVIGATOR 
and SOURCE, Safety analysis set) 
There were 18 death events recorded for DESTINATION (see Table 68 above) of which 14 occurred in 
participants  taking  the  IMP  tezepelumab  either  during  the  pivotal  NAVIGATOR  study,  or  SOURCE 
specifically  (n=1  subject)  which  was  already  described  during  the  initial  assessment  and  captured  as 
Teze  +  No  LTE  in  Table  68 above,  on  treatment/study  in  the  LTE  DESTINATION  study  (n=11)  or  the 
extended follow up (EFU) period (n=2). Further the applicant stated that 5 deaths occurred on placebo 
however on review of Table 68 and the death narratives, there were 4 deaths on placebo only and 1 
death in a patient who initially received placebo in the pivotal study and was randomised in the IMP arm 
in the LTE study but died in the run part and never received a dose of tezepelumab.  
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022

Exposure adjusted incidence rates for the on-study period were 0.80 and 0.58 in the All Teze and Rand 
Pbo treatment groups, respectively. In terms of exposure, the overall total exposure to tezepelumab was 
1283.27  subject  years,  comprising  575.62  subject-years  from  treatment  of  602  subjects  in  the 
predecessor  period  and  708.94  subject-years  from  treatment  of  712  subjects  in  the  LTE  period, 
respectively.  
No participant is currently receiving tezepelumab in the study.  
None of the deaths were considered related to the IMP by the sponsor, with the exception of one death 
(colorectal cancer) which was considered related to the IMP by the investigator. In an ad-hoc review of 
all deaths, the blinded IAC assessed all events as unlikely to be causally related to the IMP. The DSMB 
performed an ad hoc Fischers exact test to check whether there is a significant difference on the death 
rate between the groups. It was concluded that this imbalance was within a range that could be explained 
by random chance based on the number of events.  
10 of the 18 deaths were classified as cardiac related of which 7 events occurred in participants receiving 
tezepelumab (n=8 is captured in Table 68 however for one subject the fatal event occurred during the 
run in prior to receiving tezepelumab).  
At  CHMP’s  request,  the  applicant  provided  an  updated  position  on  both  infections  and  cardiac  risks 
(including  fatal  events  for  both).  No  new  additional  clinical  study  or  new  patient  exposure  data  was 
presented however the applicant highlighted that data from the Primary Safety Pool (NAVIGATOR and 
PATHWAY)  and  an  expanded  analysis  from  a  5-study  pool  of  tezepelumab  210  mg  Q4W  placebo-
controlled  studies  showed  no  increased  risk  of  serious  infections  with  tezepelumab  treatment.  The 
applicant presented results for both the pooled DESTINATION dataset (Subjects from NAVIGATOR and 
SOURCE,  Safety  Analysis  Set)  and  the  Primary  Safety  Pool  (pooled  data  from  NAVIGATOR  and 
PATHWAY). Despite  the  theoretical  concerns,  the  applicant  stated  that  there  was  no  increased  risk  of 
infections with tezepelumab treatment based on a review of the data from the DESTINATION study. In 
relation  to  the  5  deaths  (4  on  tezepelumab  &  1  on  placebo)  due  to  infections  that  occurred  in  the 
DESTINATION  study;  the  applicant  has  explained  that  there  was  ~2.67-fold  greater  exposure  to 
tezepelumab  relative  to  placebo  during  the  pandemic,  due  to  the  re-randomisation  of  the  placebo 
patients from the predecessor studies in the DESTINATION design. The applicant is of the opinion that 
tezepelumab did not increase the risk of fatal COVID-19 events or overall COVID-19 infections taking 
into  account  exposure  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  during  the  pandemic.  In  relation  to 
identifying subgroups at risk of infection i.e.: patients who were taking both chronic OCS therapy and 
tezepelumab, there was no increased risk of infections reported based on analysis of patients from the 
NAVIGATOR  study  specifically  who  were  enrolled  into  DESTINATION.  There  were  no  imbalance  in 
infections based on the pivotal data and reflected in the pooled long-term dataset which includes subjects 
previously treated in NAVIGATOR and SOURCE. There were higher SAE rates (but no imbalances) in the 
SOURCE study compared to NAVIGATOR. No safety signals related to serious, opportunistic or parasitic 
infections have been observed in the tezepelumab clinical programme by the applicant, including in the 
data from DESTINATION. The applicant was requested to present time to event and time to recovery 
analysis for infection specifically. The applicant presented data as Kaplan Meier curves from the pooled 
DESTINATION dataset for the time to first SAE & non serious AEs for infections. There did not seem to 
be a suggestion that the events occurred early or after prolonged exposure with tezepelumab as based 
on  the  time-to-event  Kaplan-Meier  analyses,  the  constant  risk  assumption  of  the  exposure  adjusted 
incidence rates seemed reasonable.

Not applicable.  
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The evaluation of safety data to support the evaluation of the safety profile of tezepelumab in subjects 
with severe, uncontrolled  asthma is focused on the Primary Safety Pool which consisted of pooled AE 
data from the confirmatory asthma exacerbation studies NAVIGATOR and PATHWAY for the 210 mg Q4W 
SC dose group and placebo group only. The applicant has adequately justified the pooling of the safety 
data from the PATHWAY and NAVIGATOR studies due to the similar design of both studies, and the use 
of the proposed posology, 210 mg Q4W SC. Notable differences between these studies and the to be 
marketed product include that both of these pivotal studies used vial and syringe administrations and 
not the PFS. In addition, the PATHWAY study did not use the to be marketed formulation and instead 
used process 1 formulation. Although not ideal, this can be accepted as quality data demonstrated these 
products were similar and no impact on safety results is expected (see Quality section for further details). 
PATHWAY study utilised 3 injections for each drug administration, which may impact injection related 
AEs compared to the NAVIGATOR study and the to be marketed posology (see further discussion on this 
point below in relation to AESIs).  
The Primary Safety Pool included 635 subjects (95.5%) that were treated with tezepelumab for ≥ 20 
weeks and 615 subjects (92.5%) that were treated with tezepelumab for ≥ 48 weeks. The Patient 
exposure is considered adequate by the CHMP. 
In the Primary Safety Pool, the overall percentage of patients that experienced any AE was similar across 
both  treatment  arms,  74.6%  and  76.5%  in  tezepelumab  210  mg  Q4W  and  placebo  treatment  arms 
respectively. The SOC with the highest incidence of AEs was ‘Infections and Infestations’ (55.5% and 
57.7% in the tezepelumab and placebo groups). The most common AEs were ‘nasopharyngitis’, ‘upper 
respiratory  tract  infection’,  ‘headache’  and  ‘asthma’  which  occurred  at  a  similar  frequency  in  both 
treatment groups in the primary safety pool, with the exception of asthma. For asthma, 7.4% and 15.7% 
of subjects experienced the AE in tezepelumab and placebo treatment arms, reflective of the efficacy 
and target of the drug. Different safety profiles for some AEs were observed between the studies (210mg 
Q4W dosing only) and may be partly explained by different methods of data collection in these trials.  At 
the CHMP’s request, the applicant described the differences in how the severity of AEs were recorded in 
the studies. In the PATHWAY study, AEs were scored based on CTC grades 1 to 5 while in the NAVIGATOR 
study, AEs were scored based on being mild, moderate or severe. It is accepted that this may have led 
to  differences  in  the  way  severity  of  AEs  were  determined  across  both  studies.  In  both  studies,  the 
majority of AEs were mild to moderate in severity.  
In  NAVIGATOR,  the  incidence  of  AEs  determined  to  be  severe  was  lower  in  the  tezepelumab  group 
compared to the placebo group (6.6% and 11.1%, respectively). For the PATHWAY trial, the incidence 
of AEs ≥ grade 3 was 21.2% and 20.3% in the tezepelumab group compared to the placebo group.  
The number of subjects that experienced ARs was similar across both treatment groups, 9.0% and 8.1% 
in tezepelumab and placebo groups respectively. The most common ARs were headache, injection site 
erythema, fatigue, arthralgia, migraine and upper respiratory tract infection. All other tezepelumab ARs 
occurred in ≤ 2 subjects per PT.   
At the CHMP’s request, the applicant clarified and further justified how they determined which AEs were 
ADRs. The applicant considered that few AEs were considered to have a reasonable possibility of having 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 193/215 
 
 
 
a causal association with tezepelumab. The AEs considered to be ADRs for tezepelumab were: arthralgia, 
pharyngitis  (Grouped  Medical  Concept  Term  based  on  PTs  of  pharyngitis,  pharyngitis  streptococcal, 
pharyngitis bacterial, and viral pharyngitis), injection site reaction, and rash (Grouped Medical Concept 
Term based on PTs of rash, rash pruritic, rash erythematous, rash maculo-papular, and rash macular). 
These ADRs all occurred with a frequency of ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10 and are therefore defined as ‘common’. 
In general, similar results were also obtained in the SOURCE study. 
For  the  Primary  Safety  Pool,  AESIs  included  serious  infections;  opportunistic  infections;  helminth 
infections;  anaphylactic  or  serious  allergic  reactions;  hypersensitivity  reactions;  malignancy;  injection 
site reactions and Guillain-Barré syndrome. For SOURCE, AESIs also included adrenal crisis. 
Tezepelumab may demonstrate inhibitory effects on immune responses mediated by Th2 cells. However, 
for the AESI of serious infections, the numbers of SAEs in this SOC was low and comparable across both 
treatment groups, 2% vs 2.2% for tezepelumab and placebo treated patients in the Primary Safety Pool. 
Of these SAEs, 2 events were considered causally related to IP by the investigator (1 subject for each 
event): upper respiratory tract infection (tezepelumab group [0.2%]) and lung abscess (placebo group 
[0.1%]). The majority of SAEs in the Infections and infestations SOC (11/13 in the tezepelumab group, 
and 15/15 in the placebo group) resolved on treatment. Pneumonia bacterial was the only SAE in this 
SOC that occurred in more than 1 tezepelumab treated patient (occurring twice). Similar trends were 
observed in the SOURCE study. As per previous assessment and in light of the death narratives assessed 
for  serious  infections  in  the  LTE  DESTINATION  study,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  add  serious 
infections to the safety specification as an important potential risk given the theoretical risk to be further 
characterised  with  both  routine  and  additional  PV  activities  (see  RMP  section  2.7.).  The  applicant  has 
also updated section 4.4 of the SmPC to add the potential for serious infections to occur on treatment.  
Opportunistic infections (as defined by the applicant) and helminth infections did not occur in the Primary 
Safety Pool or the SOURCE study. However, a warning is contained in the SmPC section 4.4 for Parasitic 
(helminth) infection which is supported as TSLP may be involved in the immunological response to some 
helminth infections. 
No anaphylactic or serious allergic reactions considered related to tezepelumab occurred in either the 
Primary Safety Pool or the SOURCE study. One case of grade 4 anaphylaxis did occur in the 280 mg Q2W 
tezepelumab arm of the PATHWAY study, however this was due to a peanut allergy. The incidence of 
hypersensitivity  reactions  was  comparable  across  both  treatment  groups.  Hypersensitivity  reactions 
including anaphylaxis are mentioned as a warning in the SmPC section 4.4 and hypersensitivity to the 
active substance and excipients is listed as a contraindication in SmPC section 4.3. This can be accepted 
as  a  potential  risk  for  any  medicinal  product,  and  as  such  routine  pharmacovigilance  activities  are 
considered sufficient.  
For malignancies, in the Primary Safety Pool, a similar albeit slightly higher number of subjects reported 
a malignancy in the on-study period in the tezepelumab group compared to the placebo treated group, 
7 subjects (1.1%) versus 5 subjects (0.7%). One of these cases was considered related to tezepelumab, 
malignant melanoma in situ in a patient with underlying nevus pigmented as a risk factor for the event. 
The event occurred 103 days after the first dose. A causal relationship with the IMP cannot be ruled out. 
Literature data suggest the major role of TSLP is to induce a Th2-cellular adaptive response, with little 
evidence  that  tezepelumab  would  interfere  with  Th1-mediated  tumor  immunosurveillance.  At  CHMP’s 
request, the applicant confirmed there were no AESIs of malignancy in the additional studies that have 
been  completed  for  tezepelumab,  NOZOMI  and  DIRECTION  CK  studies.  Of  the  additional  studies  that 
remain ongoing, data from ongoing TRAILHEAD and DIRECTION studies are not yet available. For the 
ongoing study DESTINATION, the long-term extension study of the NAVIGATOR and SOURCE studies, 
the applicant has provided a 3-month safety update, although no detailed comparison of the AEs for this 
study is possible due to the blinded nature of the data, the overall AE profile of the combined tezepelumab 
Assessment report

and  placebo  treatment  groups  appears  generally  consistent  with  that  reported  for  the  Primary  Safety 
Pool presented in the initial tezepelumab submission. A total of 4 (0.4%) subjects reported malignancies 
in  the  LTE  on-study  period  of  DESTINATION.  While  the  updated  data  for  the  LTE  study  regarding 
malignancy during long-term treatment (up to 104 weeks of treatment) is reassuring, two years of follow 
up is considered too limited to out rule this risk. In light of the lack of long-term data available for this 
product  to  date,  the  long-term  treatment  for  this  chronic  disease  and  given  the  theoretical  risk;  the 
applicant agreed to re-classify ‘malignancy’ from a missing information to an important potential risk in 
the safety specification of the RMP.  This risk will be further characterised in the post-marketing setting 
via targeted follow-up questionnaire and as part of ongoing studies listed as category 3 in the RMP. See 
RMP section 2.7.  
The incidence of injection site reactions (ISRs) was low and comparable across both treatment arms in 
the  Primary  Safety  Pool  (3.8%  and  3.1%  in  the  tezepelumab  group  compared  to  the  placebo  treated 
group).  ISRs  are  listed  as  an  ADR  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  with  the  most  frequent  injection  site 
reactions listed in the text under the table (injection site erythema, injection site swelling, injection site 
pain). As noted previously, the PATHWAY study involved 3 injections for each administration of the drug 
(NAVIGATOR had 1 injection per administration) therefore the PATHWAY study potentially overestimates 
the amount of ISRs, nonetheless no specific concerns were raised with these ADRs. 
A  single  case  of  Guillain-Barré  syndrome  occurred  in  the  tezepelumab  development  programme  in  a 
tezepelumab treated patient which was considered related to treatment. This case was confounded with 
a prior viral infection. At CHMP’s request, the applicant confirmed that no other cases of Guillain-Barré 
syndrome  have  occurred  in  the  ongoing  clinical  trials  for  tezepelumab.  Guillain-Barré  syndrome  will 
continue to be monitored as an AESI in all ongoing tezepelumab clinical studies, including the ongoing 
LTE study DESTINATION. This will also be monitored as part in future PSURs. This is accepted.   
In general, similar trends were also observed in the SOURCE study. For SOURCE, AESIs also included 
adrenal crisis to address the well-known concern of such an event in clinical studies where the design 
includes OCS-reduction. A small number of patients in this study experienced adrenal insufficiency, none 
experienced adrenal crisis.  
In relation to other trials that were not part of the Primary Safety Pool, the applicant has applied for an 
MA  with  the  PFS.  Nevertheless,  the  submitted  studies  were  performed  using  vial  and  syringe 
administrations and not the PFS. The applicant demonstrated bioequivalence in the study PATHBRIDGE 
for each pairwise comparison of the vial and syringe, PFS and AI administrations and no differences in 
safety  between  the  devices  are  therefore  expected  based  on  PK  data.  In  addition,  no  significant 
differences in the safety profile of each device was observed, however each safety grouping per device 
was  a  combination  of  3  arms  with  injections  at  different  anatomical  sites.  The  PATH-HOME  study 
compared  the  PFS  and  AI  administrations,  but  did  not  include  a  direct  comparison  with  the  vial  and 
syringe administrations used in the pivotal studies.  At CHMP’s request, the applicant briefly discussed 
the design of the PATH-HOME study and justified that the study did not include a vial and syringe arm 
as  the  objective  of  the  study  was  to  examine  home  administration,  the  APFS  presentation  was  not 
available at the time of study start for NAVIGATOR and the trial design was generally endorsed during a 
scientific advice procedure. While it still would have been preferable to conduct the pivotal trials with to 
the 
to-be  marketed 
formulation, 
this 
issue 
is  not  pursued 
further  as 
the  number  of 
malfunction/inappropriate use is low and no AEs were reported from the device malfunctions. In addition, 
the PATHBRIDGE study demonstrated bioequivalence between all 3 devices.  
In general, the clinical trials that were not included in the Primary Safety Pool included different subjects 
(healthy volunteers, atopic dermatitis and asthma patients), a smaller number of subjects and different 
dosing regimen (varying dose, frequency, duration of treatment, route of administration), thus limiting 
the benefit of any safety evaluations.

The  phase  1  studies  0620,  0390  and  1183  tested  a  tezepelumab  dose  of  700mg.  Although  these 
treatments  were  for  much  shorter  durations  of  use  and  numbers  treated  were  very  limited,  no  SAEs 
occurred in subjects treated with this higher dose of tezepelumab. The high dose of 700mg tezepelumab 
did not raise any safety concerns.  
More frequent dosing was performed in study 0390 210mg Q14D and Q7D (and also the PATHWAY study 
of  the  pivotal  safety  pool,  280mg  Q2W).  A  grade  4  life  threatening  case  of  creatine  phosphokinase 
increased occurred in study 0390 210mg Q7D but this was not considered related to tezepelumab and 
≥ grade 3 CPK increases occurred in both tezepelumab and placebo treated arms. 
However  overall,  no  new  safety  concerns  were  identified  from  the  studies  that  were  not  part  of  the 
primary safety pool. 
The overall incidence of SAEs in the Primary Safety Pool was low. A lower percentage of patients treated 
with  tezepelumab  experienced  SAEs  compared  with  those  treated  with  the  placebo,  8.6%  and  13% 
respectively.  This  was  mainly  driven  by  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  asthma  SAEs  experienced  by 
tezepelumab treated patients compared to placebo treated patients, 2.3% and 6.9% respectively. Apart 
from the SAE of asthma, no PT was reported in more than 2 tezepelumab-treated subjects. The most 
common SAEs in tezepelumab-treated subjects were asthma, Pneumonia bacterial, Basal cell carcinoma, 
Malignant  melanoma  in  situ,  Prostate  cancer,  Cardiac  failure  congestive,  Osteoarthritis,  Non-cardiac 
chest pain, Ligament rupture and Ligament sprain. In the initial MA application and study reports, more 
SAEs  were  reported  in  tezepelumab  treated  patients  compared  to  placebo  treated  patients  in  cardiac 
disorders SOC, 5 (0.8%) and 2 (0.3%) respectively. Due to the low numbers of cardiac SAEs, type of 
drug and mechanism of action it was not expected that tezepelumab would cause any cardiac effects. 
For  the  ongoing  study  DESTINATION,  the  long-term  extension study  of  the NAVIGATOR and  SOURCE 
studies, the applicant has initially provided a 3-month safety update, although no detailed comparison 
of the cardiac AEs for this study was possible due to the blinded nature of the data, the overall AE profile 
of  the  combined  tezepelumab  and  placebo  treatment  groups  appeared  generally  consistent  with  that 
reported for the Primary Safety Pool presented in the initial tezepelumab submission. Nevertheless, the 
applicant submitted during the evaluation of the application a very recent updated safety report from 
the  ongoing  LTE  DESTINATION  study  where  numerical  imbalances  were  observed  in  the  deaths  and 
cardiac disorder System Organ Class (SOC) Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) with more events occurring 
in the Tezepelumab groups compared with placebo. This is further discussed below.  
The % of patients that experienced SAE’s s determined by the investigator was low and similar across 
both treatment arms, 0.9% and 0.7% in tezepelumab and placebo treated arms respectively. The SAE’s 
s that occurred in the tezepelumab treated arm were asthma (n=2 subjects), malignant melanoma in 
situ, Guillain-Barré syndrome, migraine, myositis, and upper respiratory tract infection (1 subject each). 
Similar results, albeit with slightly higher levels of SAEs were obtained in the SOURCE study. None of 
the SAEs reported in the tezepelumab arm were considered related to IP by the investigator. 
In  the  initial  MA  application  and  study  reports,  4  deaths  occurred  in  the  tezepelumab  development 
programme, 2 of these occurred in placebo treated patients and were of no concern. The remaining 2 
deaths occurred in tezepelumab treated patients. One of the death was recorded as a cardiac arrest; 
this patient had confounding medical history and the event was not considered related to treatment. The 
other  death  in  a  tezepelumab  treated  patient  was  a  cerebrovascular  accident,  also  confounded  with 
hypertension,  hypertensive  encephalitis,  elderly  age  and  pneumonia  treated  at  home.  A  lack  of  post-
mortem limits assessment although this event is also not thought to be linked to the mechanism of action 
of tezepelumab and also occurred with the lowest dose of tezepelumab.  
There were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline in haematology parameters, clinical chemistry 
parameters, vital signs or ECG shifts over time with tezepelumab compared to placebo treatment, with 
Assessment report

the exception of reduced blood eosinophil counts and total serum IgE from baseline, which is consistent 
with the known pharmacodynamic effects of tezepelumab. This has been adequately reflected in SmPC 
section 5.1.  
In general, the safety profile of tezepelumab was similar in all subgroups analysed based on baseline 
blood eosinophil count, baseline allergic status, age, gender, BMI and OCS use at baseline. 
In  black  or  African  Americans,  the  incidence  of  AEs  was  lower  in  the  tezepelumab  group  (63.6%) 
compared with the placebo group (81.1%), although the smaller sample size of this race subgroup limits 
the conclusions that can be drawn, in addition no imbalance in this subgroup was noted for SAEs. 
The lack of difference in safety profile for the elderly is reflected in the SmPC section 4.2 with a sentence 
stating ‘No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (see section 5.2)’. Further, SmPC section 4.8 
has been updated to reflect, a total of 119 patients were 65 years of age or older, of which 32 patients 
were 75 years of age or older. Safety in these age groups were similar to the overall study population’.  
A total of 82 adolescents aged 12 to 17 with severe, uncontrolled asthma were enrolled in the 52-week 
Phase 3 NAVIGATOR study (see section 5.1). The safety profile in adolescents was generally similar to 
the overall study population. Patients under the age of 12 were not enrolled in the clinical development 
programme  which  is  reflected  in  the  indication  and  SmPC  section  4.2  ‘The  safety  and  efficacy  of 
Tradename in children under 12 years of age have not been established. No data are available. 
No formal clinical studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of hepatic or renal impairment 
on tezepelumab. This is acceptable, as a monoclonal antibody tezepelumab is not expected to have any 
impact on hepatic or renal function. This is reflected in the SmPC section 4.2 with a sentence stating No 
dose adjustment is required for patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).’ 
In  relation  to  inactivated  vaccines,  the  applicant  has  confirmed  initiation  of  a  study  (VECTOR; 
D5180C00031;  NCT05062759)  assessing  the  effects  of  tezepelumab  on  functional  response  of  the 
immune system by measuring antibody responses to the influenza vaccine (inactivated) in adolescents 
and young adults aged 12 to 21 years with moderate to severe asthma. This study is currently ongoing 
and  will  further  characterise  this  issue.  The  final  CSR  should  be  submitted  when  complete  and  any 
changes if needed to the SmPC should be presented by the applicant. 
Although  a  small  number  of  pregnancies  occurred  during  the  clinical  development  programme,  the 
studies  excluded  pregnant  and  lactating  women,  this  is  adequately  reflected  in  the  SmPC  section  4.6 
where it is recommended not to use tezepelumab during pregnancy unless the expected benefit to the 
pregnant mother is greater than any possible risk to the foetus, and a risk to a breast-fed child cannot 
be excluded. In addition, use in pregnant and lactating women is listed in the RMP as missing information 
and a category 3 PASS study will be conducted to further characterise the use in pregnancy (see RMP 
section 2.7). 
In  phase  2  and  3  studies,  the  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  ADAs  in  subjects  treated  with 
tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W was low (ranging from 0% to 7.6%) and was comparable to the incidence 
rate of ADAs in placebo treated patients. In some studies, neutralising antibodies were not evaluated. 
In the studies where neutralising antibodies were evaluated, numbers testing positive were too low to 
determine any potential clinical consequences for safety.  
The numbers of subjects that had AEs and ARs leading to discontinuation of IP was low and comparable 
across both treatment arms, 2.0% and 0.9% of subjects treated with tezepelumab group and 3.0% and 
1.2%  with  placebo  respectively.  In  the  tezepelumab  treatment  group,  no  PT  for  an  AE  leading  to 
discontinuation was reported in > 2 subjects. Similar trends were observed in the SOURCE study.  
As  per  CHMP’s  request,  the  applicant  provided  the  full  CSR  and  supporting  documents  for  the  LTE 
DESTINATION study. This study was not part of either the initial application or the Primary Safety Pool 
Assessment report

assessment (NAVIGATOR & PATHWAY studies) but rather consisted of patients from the NAVIGATOR & 
SOURCE studies. The CSR was requested due to unanticipated safety concerns regarding cardiac SAEs 
and deaths identified by the applicant after unblinding of data. The applicant will submit an updated CSR 
after database lock for the extended follow up (EFU) period by November 2022. The DESTINATION study 
is  already  captured  in  the  RMP  as  a  pharmacovigilance  study  to  evaluate  the  long-term  safety  and 
tolerability of tezepelumab in severe asthma subjects to evaluate the long-term use safety concern. The 
two main safety concerns identified by the applicant are discussed below.  
Cardiac SAEs  
In  the  initial  MA  application,  more  SAEs  were  reported  (primary  safety  pool)  in  tezepelumab  treated 
patients  compared  to  placebo  treated  patients  in  cardiac  disorders  SOC,  5  (0.8%)  and  2  (0.3%) 
respectively. Nevertheless, due to the low number of cardiac SAEs, taking into account the preclinical & 
PK data and the type of drug and mechanism of action it was initially not expected that tezepelumab 
would cause any cardiac effects. 
Following submission of the DESTINATION study it is now known that there is animbalance in cardiac 
SAEs with a total of 20 subjects that reported 23 Cardiac disorder SOC SAEs in the on-study period, 18 
subjects in the tezepelumab group and 2 subjects in the placebo group. 7 of these 23 events were also 
determined  to  be  MACE  (CV  death,  non-fatal  MI,  or  non-fatal  stroke)  by  the  blinded  independent 
adjudication  committee  (IAC).  In  addition,  there  were  a  number  of  MACE  events  from  other  SOC 
categories.  
In support of the safety of tezepelumab, the subject incidence rates for overall AEs (serious and non-
serious  AEs)  were  similar  between  the  tezepelumab  and  placebo  groups  (Cardiac  disorders  SOC 
exposure-adjusted incidence rates 2.87, 2.75, and 3.12 for Rand Teze, Rand Pbo, and All Teze groups 
respectively).  There  were  no  obvious  trends  in  the  categories  of  PTs;  none  of  the  cardiac  SAEs  were 
considered related to tezepelumab based on investigator and blinded IAC/sponsor causality (one event 
was considered possibly related to the placebo); all patients had risk factors for cardiac disease (high 
blood pressure, former smoker, diabetes, obesity, age, being male, hypertension hypercholesterolemia), 
and a number of patients also had confounding medical cardiac history. 
There is no known plausible mechanism of action for tezepelumab or inhibition of TSLP affecting cardiac 
cells; there were no significant cardiac findings in the pre-clinical programme; there were no clinically 
significant  ECG  findings  from  the  initial  study  programme.  There  was  a  small  imbalance  between  the 
treatment groups in age, with a higher proportion of subjects who were ≥ 65 years of age in the Rand 
Teze  group  compared  to  the  Rand  Pbo  group  for  the  NAVIGATOR  predecessor  study  (18.2%  versus 
13.9%) which may have led to this cohort of patients having an increased risk of a cardiac events. 
Based on the Kaplan-Meier curves, there was no pattern with respect to time to onset for the cardiac 
SAEs, however an increased separation over time was observed. 
The  applicant  also  referenced  previous  studies  in  severe  asthma  and  stated  that  the  incidences  were 
within those rates. According to the applicant, the incidence rates of Cardiac disorder SOC SAEs observed 
with tezepelumab treatment were broadly similar to those seen with the other approved biologics and 
the 95% CIs across all of the active treatment groups overlap. 
Against the safety of tezepelumab, a number of deaths were cardiac related (n=7) and are linked to the 
imbalance  in  fatalities  observed  in  the  DESTINATION  LTE;  the  applicant  referenced  and  discussed  a 
number of RWE sources including insurance claims and Electronic medical records (EMR) suggesting the 
rate of cardiac SAEs in the placebo group was lower than the rate observed in severe asthma population, 
however this RWE cannot be substantiated and thus the reliability of this data is questionable.  
Deaths 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022

There were 18 death events recorded for DESTINATION of which 14 occurred in participants taking the 
IMP tezepelumab either during the pivotal NAVIGATOR study, or SOURCE specifically (n=1 subject) which 
was already described during the initial assessment, on treatment/study in the LTE DESTINATION study 
(n=11) or the extended follow up (EFU) period (n=2) which is still ongoing and pending full reporting 
after  final  database  lock  (i.e.  by  Nov  2022).  Further  the  applicant  stated  that  5  deaths  occurred  on 
placebo however on review of data submitted and the death narratives, there were 4 deaths on placebo 
only and 1 death in a patient who initially received placebo in the pivotal study and was randomised in 
the IMP arm in the LTE study but died in the run part and never received a dose of tezepelumab.  
Exposure adjusted incidence rates for the on-study period were 0.80 and 0.58 in the All Teze and Rand 
Pbo treatment groups, respectively. In terms of exposure, the overall total exposure to tezepelumab was 
1283.27  subject  years,  comprising  575.62  subject-years  from  treatment  of  602  subjects  in  the 
predecessor  period  and  708.94  subject-years  from  treatment  of  712  subjects  in  the  LTE  period, 
respectively.  
No participant is currently receiving tezepelumab in the study and only extended follow-up phase of the 
study  is  currently  ongoing.  At  the  time  of  the  primary  database  lock  a  total  of  8  subjects  (all  from 
SOURCE as predecessor) were ongoing in the 12-week safety follow-up period and a total of 139 subjects 
(all  from  NAVIGATOR  as  predecessor)  were  ongoing  in  the  36-week  EFU  period.  All  subjects  had 
completed the 12-week follow up and the last subject, last visit for the EFU period was anticipated to be 
end  of  May  2022.  The  applicant  has  subsequently  confirmed  that  the  database  lock  for  the  extended 
follow-up  period  will  be  in  July  2022  and  an  addendum  to  the  DESTINATION  CSR  containing  the  EFU 
data is expected in November 2022. The applicant will submit this for assessment when completed.  
None of the deaths were considered related to the IMP by the sponsor, with the exception of one death 
(colorectal cancer) which was considered related to the IMP by the investigator. In an ad-hoc review of 
all deaths, the blinded IAC assessed all events as unlikely to be causally related to the IMP. It is noted 
that the DSMB performed an ad hoc Fischers exact test to check whether there is a significant difference 
on  the  death  rate  between  the  groups.  It  was  concluded  that  this  imbalance  was  within  a  range  that 
could be explained by random chance based on the number of events. This is supported by the CHMP.  
10 of the 18 deaths were classified as cardiac related of which 7 events occurred in participants receiving 
tezepelumab (n=8, however for one subject the fatal event occurred during the run in prior to receiving 
tezepelumab). While it is appreciated there are no obvious patterns or particular subgroups identified to 
be  more  at  risk  of  deaths  by  the  applicant,  further  clarification  were  sought  from  the  applicant.  The 
applicant  stated  that  there  is  no  causal/temporal  relationship  between  the  deaths  observed  and 
treatment  with  tezepelumab.  Of  the  8  CV  related  deaths  recorded  that  occurred  in  the  Tezepelumab 
treatment  arm,  all  participants  had  a  medical  history  that  predisposed  them  to  cardiovascular  events 
(hypertension,  previous  MI,  Diabetes  Mellitus)  except  for  one  subject  who  had  no  medical  history 
recorded and died due to a ruptured cerebral aneurysm.  
Post-operative  related  sepsis  occurred  in  2  participants.  For  patients  who  received  the  tezepelumab 
specifically, pneumonia (some COVID-19 related) and sepsis were the recorded infections in contrast to 
1 infection (COVID-19 related) in the  placebo group. Given the  mechanism of action of tezepelumab, 
these infection-related death narratives were considered to be of concern by the CHMP and thus required 
further discussion by the applicant.  
The patient  who developed invasive colorectal cancer pT4b pN1c had previously received 13 doses of 
tezepelumab in NAVIGATOR study and 8 doses in the LTE study prior to diagnosis and developed the 
following serious infections post operatively prior to death: acute pancreatitis, gastroenteritis, bilateral 
aspiration  pneumonia  and  sepsis.  Another  participant  who  received  tezepelumab  developed  serious 
bacterial meningitis, staphylococcal pneumonia, COVID-19 and sepsis post elective surgery for a pituitary 
Assessment report

Page 199/215 
 
 
 
macroadenoma. The patient had received 13 doses of tezepelumab in the predecessor NAVIGATOR study 
and 5 doses in the LTE study prior to the initial event. 
While there is no known biological plausibility to explain why serious cardiac events would occur, it is the 
CHMP’s opinion that it cannot be dismissed that treatment with tezepelumab can lead to an increased 
risk of serious cardiac events.  
As requested, the applicant provided an updated position on both infections and cardiac risks (including 
fatal  events  for  both).  No  new  additional  clinical  study  or  new  patient  exposure  data  was  presented 
however the applicant highlighted that data from the Primary Safety Pool (NAVIGATOR and PATHWAY) 
and an expanded analysis from a 5-study pool of tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W placebo-controlled studies 
showed  no  increased  risk  of  serious  infections  with  tezepelumab  treatment.  The  applicant  presented 
results  for  both  the  pooled  DESTINATION  dataset  (Subjects  from  NAVIGATOR  and  SOURCE,  Safety 
Analysis Set) and the Primary Safety Pool (pooled data from NAVIGATOR and PATHWAY). Despite the 
theoretical concerns, the applicant stated that there was no increased risk of infections with tezepelumab 
treatment based on a review of the data from the DESTINATION study. In relation to the 5 deaths (4 on 
tezepelumab & 1 on placebo) due to infections that occurred in the DESTINATION study; the applicant 
has explained that there was ~2.67-fold greater exposure to tezepelumab relative to placebo during the 
pandemic,  due  to  the  re-randomisation  of  the  placebo  patients  from  the  predecessor  studies  in  the 
DESTINATION design. The applicant is of the opinion that tezepelumab did not increase the risk of fatal 
COVID-19 events or overall COVID-19 infections taking into account exposure differences between the 
treatment  groups  during  the  pandemic.  In  relation  to  identifying  subgroups  at  risk  of  infection  i.e.: 
patients who were taking both chronic OCS therapy and tezepelumab, there was no increased risk of 
infections  reported  based  on  analysis  of  patients  from  the  NAVIGATOR  study  specifically  who  were 
enrolled  into  DESTINATION.  No  safety  signals  related  to  serious,  opportunistic  or  parasitic  infections 
have been observed in the tezepelumab clinical programme by the applicant, including in the data from 
DESTINATION.  The  applicant  presented  data  as  Kaplan  Meier  curves  from  the  pooled  DESTINATION 
dataset for the time to first SAE & non serious AEs for infections. There did not seem to be a suggestion 
that the events occurred early or after prolonged exposure with tezepelumab as based on the time-to-
event  Kaplan-Meier  analyses,  the  constant  risk  assumption  of  the  exposure  adjusted  incidence  rates 
seemed  reasonable.  The  applicant  stated  that  there  is  no  evidence  that  tezepelumab  prolongs  the 
duration of an infection event. However, there could be a potential for prolongation of duration of serious 
infection based on the results the applicant presented focussing for serious pneumonia specifically – 4 
days  longer  duration  in  the  DESTINATION  study  for  tezepelumab  which  will  require  further 
characterisation in the post-marketing setting. Serious infections was added to the safety specifications 
of the RMP as an important potential risk that will be further characterised as part of ongoing studies 
and targeted safety follow-up questionnaire (see RMP section 2.7.). It is however noted that the duration 
of serious pneumonia was actually longer in the placebo group in the Primary Safety Pool. 
The  applicant’s  position  in  relation  to  cardiac  risks  was  less  straight  forward  as  there  is  no  plausible 
reason or mechanism presented to account for the imbalance of cardiac SAEs that were reported in the 
DESTINATION  study.  Across  the  predecessor  studies  and  DESTINATION,  there  were  17  subjects  with 
cardiac related SAEs on tezepelumab (n=840) and 0 subjects with events on placebo (n=607) during 
the on-treatment period. A total of 20 subjects reported 23 Cardiac disorder SOC SAEs in the on-study 
period  (including  the  treatment  period  and  the  12-week  safety  follow-up);  18  subjects  were  in  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 200/215 
 
 
 
tezepelumab group and 2 subjects were in the placebo group. In total from the on-study pooled dataset, 
there were 13 events determined by the IAC to be MACE, 9 on tezepelumab treatment and 4 on placebo 
treatment. The applicant re-presented the fatal cardiac events as 2 categories; as a fatal event within 
the cardiac disorder SOC and as a fatal event determined by the IAC.  
With respect to adverse events with fatal outcome reported during on-study period in DESTINATION 
study, in total 3 cases of Fatal Cardiac disorder AEs (Cardiac arrest, Myocardial infarction, Acute left 
ventricular failure) were reported in tezepelumab treated patients (n=840) and 1 case of Fatal Cardiac 
disorder AEs (Cardiac failure) were reported in placebo treated patients (n=607). No other Cardiac 
Disorder SOC Fatal AEs have been observed (beyond those observed in DESTINATION) within a 
broader pool of studies in asthma assessing 210 mg Q4W multiple dose, based on a total time at risk 
1606.2 years across all treated subjects. There are 9 pooled adjudicated MACE CV deaths recorded; 6 
in All Teze and 3 in Placebo group. Note a 10th death was adjudicated to be a CV death by the IAC, 
this subject (in the Pbo+Teze group) had PT of Sudden Death, which occurred 167 days after last dose 
of IP. The 10th CV death occurred within the EFU. It is the applicant’s view that there is no evidence to 
suggest an increased risk of fatal CV events with tezepelumab treatment. None of the cardiac fatal 
events were considered causally related to tezepelumab by the investigator which is supportive. 
As  previously  mentioned,  in  support  of  the  safety  of  tezepelumab,  the  pooled  exposure-adjusted 
incidence rates for overall AEs in cardiac disorders (serious and non-serious AEs) were similar between 
the tezepelumab and placebo groups. There were no obvious trends in the categories of PTs; none of 
the  cardiac  SAEs  or  MACE  events  were  considered  related  to  tezepelumab  based  on  investigator  and 
blinded IAC/sponsor causality (one event was considered possibly related to the placebo); all patients 
had risk factors for cardiac disease (high blood pressure, former smoker, diabetes, obesity, age, being 
male,  hypertension  hypercholesterolemia),  and  a  number  of  patients  also  had  confounding  medical 
cardiac history. 
There  was  a  numerical  imbalance  in  the  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rate  of  SAEs  within  the  Cardiac 
disorder SOC across treatment arms as mentioned above. However, analyses by PTs showed no apparent 
pattern in types or categories of cardiac events. No particular at-risk group has been identified by the 
applicant including chronic OCS therapy. OCS at baseline did not result in increased risk of fatal cardiac 
events with tezepelumab. The events occurred across different High Level Group Term (HLGT) categories 
(ie,  cardiac  arrhythmias,  coronary  artery  disease,  and  heart  failures).  The  applicant  has  stated  again 
that  the  rate  of  cardiac  SAEs  in  the  placebo  group  is  lower  than  the  rate  observed  in  severe  asthma 
population real world setting and the company’s pooled placebo dataset of severe asthma subjects. The 
applicant also reiterated that the incidence rates of Cardiac disorder SOC SAEs with tezepelumab were 
consistent with what has been estimated based on published data with other biologics evaluated in severe 
asthma populations. 
The  applicant  initially  proposed  to  continue  to  collect  serious  infections  &  cardiac  events  from  the 
following ongoing studies: SUNRISE [OCS reduction study in severe asthma; 28-week treatment period 
with 12-week safety follow up; planned N = 207 randomised 2:1]) and DIRECTION [China/Asia regional 
efficacy and safety study in severe asthma; 52-week treatment period with 12-week safety follow-up; 
planned N = 396 randomised 1:1]). Data are anticipated to be available from SUNRISE 2H 2025 and for 
DIRECTION 1H 2025. As requested, these studies are captured in the PV plan as an additional activity 
Assessment report

(category 3 studies). The applicant also confirmed that post-marketing information for serious cardiac 
events will continue to become available in the US and based on a cut-off date of 16 March 2022, no 
cardiac  SAEs  have  been  reported  in  the  post  marketing  data.  No  nonserious  cases  matching  PTs  for 
MACE or the Cardiac SOC were reported in post-marketing reports. 
The applicant has concluded that there is no explanation for the observation of a numerical imbalance in 
cardiac disorder SOC SAEs and highlighted that because there is no evidence of an imbalance in non-
serious  cardiac  AEs  or  deaths,  this  could  be  a  chance  finding.  The  applicant  thus  proposed  to  collect 
additional safety information to further characterise any cardiac effects. 
Two  warnings  have  been  added  to  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  in relation  to  serious  infections  &  serious 
cardiac events and both have been added as important potential risks to the safety specification of the 
RMP with additional targeted post marketing questionnaires. The 2 planned/ongoing studies SUNRISE & 
DIRECTION will review these risks further and there will be a blinded IAC to evaluate MACE for these 
studies. From CHMPs perspective, the 2 planned/ongoing studies are considered too small and short to 
completely characterise the serious cardiac safety concern and while the post marketing questionnaire 
is  supportive,  this  method  will  not  adequately  characterise  this  particular  risk.  Therefore,  the  CHMP 
requested the applicant to conduct a PASS to further characterise the specific safety concern ‘serious 
cardiac  events’  as  the  initial  RMMs  and  PV  activities  being  proposed  were  not  considered  sufficient  to 
fully characterise this specific important potential risk, serious cardiac events. See RMP section 2.7.  
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The evaluation of safety data to support the evaluation of the safety profile of tezepelumab in subjects 
with severe, uncontrolled asthma is focused on the Primary Safety Pool which consisted of pooled AE 
data from the confirmatory asthma exacerbation studies NAVIGATOR and PATHWAY for the 210 mg 
Q4W SC dose group and placebo group only.  
The Primary Safety Pool included 635 subjects (95.5%) that were treated with tezepelumab for ≥ 20 
weeks and 615 subjects (92.5%) that were treated with tezepelumab for ≥ 48 weeks. The Patient 
exposure is considered adequate by the CHMP. 
From the primary safety pool, tezepelumab 210mg Q4W has an acceptable safety profile. Most AEs 
were mild to moderate in severity, and reversible. The overall rates for AEs were comparable between 
tezepelumab and placebo treatment arms. SAEs were low and comparable across both treatment 
arms. 
Nevertheless, due to unanticipated safety concerns regarding cardiac SAEs identified by the applicant 
after unblinding of data of the LTE DESTINATION study, the CHMP requested the applicant to conduct a 
PASS (cat. 3 study) to further characterise the safety profile of tezepelumab in the post-marketing 
(see RMP section 2.7.). The product information was amended to highlight to healthcare professionals 
that any patients experiencing serious infection or serious cardiac events should discontinue treatment 
until it has been resolved. In addition, malignancy and serious infections will continue to be carefully 
monitored in the post-approval setting (see RMP section 2.7.).

2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Tezspire (tezepelumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Asthma is a chronic heterogeneous inflammatory airway disease that affects approximately 358 million 
individuals worldwide. Asthma is characterised by bronchial hyperresponsiveness, variable symptoms of 
wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and cough, and by variable expiratory airflow limitation. 
Asthma may also be characterised by  exacerbations, which are episodes of worsening symptoms and 
lung function. 
Severe  asthma  is  defined  as  asthma  that  requires  Global  Initiative  for  Asthma  (GINA)  Step  4  or  5 
treatment  to  prevent  it  from  becoming  uncontrolled  or  asthma  that  remains  uncontrolled  despite 
adherence to maximal optimised treatment. The European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines use the 
same  criteria  to  define  severe  asthma  but  alternatively  consider  severe  asthma  as  asthma  requiring 
systemic  corticosteroids  for  ≥  50%  of  the  previous  year  to  prevent  it  from  becoming  ‘uncontrolled’  or 
asthma which remains ‘uncontrolled’ despite this therapy. 
The applicant has initially sought marketing authorisation for tezepelumab for the following indication:  
Tezepelumab is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults and adolescents 12 years and 
older with severe asthma (see section 5.1). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current treatment strategies for controlling asthma are primarily aimed at reducing airway inflammation, 
with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) being the mainstay of treatment for patients with persistent asthma 
due  to  their  powerful  anti-inflammatory  effects.  GINA  guidelines  for  patients  with  severe  asthma 
recommend the following: 
•  Medium dose (MD) ICS-long-acting beta agonist (LABA) maintenance therapy (or high-dose [HD] 
ICS plus add-on tiotropium or leukotriene receptor antagonist [LTRA]) plus as-needed low-dose 
ICS-formoterol for adults and adolescents (Step 4 treatment). 
•  HD  ICS-LABA  maintenance  therapy  plus  as-needed  low-dose  ICS-formoterol  and  refer  for 
phenotypic  assessment  and  possible  treatment  with  tiotropium,  anti-immunoglobulin  E  (IgE), 
anti-interleukin  (IL)-5/IL-5  receptor  alpha  (IL-5Rα),  anti-IL-4  receptor  alpha  (IL-4Rα)  and/or 
low-dose OCS as add-on therapy (Step 5 treatment). 
Many  asthmatic  patients  remain  symptomatic  despite  treatment  with  ICS  and  LABA  combinations. 
Treatment  options  then  include  the  addition  of  other  controller  therapies  including  LTRA,  long-acting 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 207/215 
 
 
 
muscarinic antagonist, theophylline, and OCS. Severe asthma can lead to a dependence on OCS with 
systemic corticosteroid exposure potentially leading to serious short- and long-term adverse effects. 
Biologic therapies can provide additional asthma control for patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma, 
and those targeting IgE, IL-4/IL-13, and IL-5 are now included in international treatment guidelines as 
an add-on treatment to patients uncontrolled with ICS/LABA treatment. Omalizumab may be suitable 
for a subgroup of patients with proven reactivity to an aeroallergen and elevated serum IgE levels who 
remain inadequately controlled with ICS plus LABA. Four additional biologics (mepolizumab, reslizumab, 
benralizumab, and dupilumab) have been approved for severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype 
and/or  elevated  levels  of  fractional  exhaled  nitric  oxide  (FeNO),  an  inflammatory  biomarker  typically 
associated with eosinophilic asthma. However, based on the real-world observational study CHRONICLE 
(Ambrose  et  al  2020),  it  is  estimated  that  37%  of  patients  with  severe  asthma  have  an  inadequate 
response to, or are ineligible for currently approved biologics, and continue to experience exacerbations 
(Soong et al 2020). 
The is an UMN in patients with severe asthma that is not controlled with conventional treatment and do 
not qualify based on biomarkers such as IgE, raised eosinophils or FeNO. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
There  are  three  core  studies  that  support  the  efficacy  of  tezepelumab;  2  of  these  were  asthma 
exacerbation studies (NAVIGATOR and PATHWAY) and one was an oral corticosteroid (OCS)-reduction 
study (SOURCE). 
Confirmatory asthma exacerbation studies 
•  NAVIGATOR  (D5180C00007)  (pivotal  study):  Phase  3,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled  study  of  tezepelumab  210  mg  every  4  weeks  (Q4W)  administered  subcutaneously 
(SC) in adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 to 80 years with inadequately controlled asthma, 
with a 52-week treatment period (N = 1061 randomised, 1059 treated) 
• 
PATHWAY  (CD-RI-MEDI9929-1146;  D5180C00001):  Phase  2b,  randomised,  double-blind, 
placebo-controlled dose-ranging study of tezepelumab administered SC in adults aged 18 to 75 
years  with  inadequately  controlled  asthma,  with  a  52-week  treatment  period  (N  =  550 
randomised and treated) 
Supportive efficacy and safety OCS-reduction study 
•  SOURCE  (D5180C00009):  Phase  3,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  of 
tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W administered SC in adults aged 18 to 80 years with OCS dependent 
asthma with a 48-week treatment period (N = 150 randomised and treated) 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The  NAVIGATOR  study  had  one  primary  endpoint,  the  annualised  rate  of  severe  exacerbation  events 
during the 52-week placebo-controlled treatment period   
Tezepelumab 210 mg SC Q4W treatment reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations over 52 weeks by 
56% compared with placebo (rate ratio 0.44 [95% CI 0.37, 0.53]; p < 0.001). In absolute terms also 
there  was  a  significant  reduction  in  the  number  of  exacerbations  as  there  was  0.93  exacerbation  per 
year  observed  in  the  tezepelumab  group  and  2.1  exacerbation  per  year  in  the  placebo  group.  The 
treatment  effect  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  baseline  blood  eosinophils  300  cells/μL  was  greater 
than observed in the overall pupation  and in those with baseline blood eosinophils < 300 cells/μL. In 
subjects with baseline blood eosinophils > 300 cells/μL, the rate of asthma exacerbations was reduced 
by 70 % (rate ratio 0.30 [95% CI 0.22, 0.40]) whereas in subjects with baseline blood eosinophils < 
300 cells/μL by 41% (rate ratio 0.59 [95% CI 0.46, 0.75])-  
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 208/215 
 
 
 
These results were further supported by other endpoints which investigated the effect on exacerbations 
such as time to first Asthma and proportion of Subjects Experiencing No Asthma Exacerbations Over 52 
Weeks.  
In the PATHWAY study the primary endpoint of the annualised AER measured at week 52 was also met. 
Statistically significant annualised asthma exacerbation rate reduction (AERR) of 62%, 71%, and 66% 
for the 70 mg Q4W, 210 mg Q4W, and 280 mg Q2W tezepelumab groups, respectively, compared with 
placebo were observed in the ITT population (p < 0.001) at week 52.  
In the NAVIGATOR study, there were four key secondary endpoints such as change from baseline in pre-
bronchodilator FEV1, change from baseline in AQLQ(S)+12 total score, change from baseline in ACQ-6 
score and change from baseline in weekly mean daily Asthma Symptom Diary (ASD) score. For all these 
endpoints statistically significant differences between the treatment groups were observed.  
Subjects receiving tezepelumab demonstrated an improvement from baseline in pre-BD FEV1 compared 
with placebo at 52 weeks (0.23 L vs 0.10 L, difference 0.13 L [95% CI 0.08, 0.18]; p < 0.001).   
Also, in relation to patient-reported outcomes investigated in the study improvements were seen in the 
tezepelumab group as compared to placebo. At week 52 for AQLQ(S)+12 LS Mean difference between 
the groups was 0.33 [95% CI 0.20, 0.47]; p < 0.001); for ACQ-6 LS Mean difference was -0.33 [95% 
CI -0.46, -0.20]; p < 0.001 and for weekly mean Asthma Symptom Diary (ASD) score LS Mean difference 
was -0.11 [95% CI -0.19, -0.04]; p = 0.004. These results were further supported  by the responder 
analyses  in  which  a  greater  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  tezepelumab  group  achieved  clinically 
meaningful improvements in AQLQ, ACQ-6 and ASD as compared to placebo, although these endpoints 
were not included the multiplicity control strategy. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
NAVIGATOR  study  only  enrolled  patients  at  the  end  of  medium  ICS  dose  range  (500  μg  fluticasone 
propionate  or  equivalent)  and  therefore  it  was  unclear  if  these  results  can  be  extrapolated  to  a  full 
medium  ICS  dose  range.  In  view  of  the  limited  data  supporting  the  use  of  tezepelumab  in  patients 
receiving medium ICS dose, the applicant agreed to restrict the indication in patients receiving high ICS 
dose only.  
In the adolescents subgroup, statistically significant results were not achieved and the treatment effect 
was smaller as compared to the overall population. In addition, the number of adolescents receiving high 
ICS  at  baseline  was  small  (i.e.  15  patients  out  of  82  randomised  adolescent  patients).  Nevertheless, 
based on the justification provided by the applicant, it was agreed by the CHMP that the results from the 
adult population can be extrapolated to the adolescents population.  
In the pivotal NAVIGATOR study, the efficacy was shown for patients irrespective of baseline blood 
eosinophils and FeNO values. Nevertheless, a smaller treatment effect was observed in these patients 
with low values. Therefore, there were some uncertainties in relation to the treatment effect in 
subjects with both low baseline blood eosinophils (< 300 cells/μL) and FENO values <25ppb. At the 
CHMP’s request, the applicant presented the efficacy results in this subgroup. A clinically meaningful 
AAER reductions in subjects with both low baseline blood eosinophil counts (< 300 cells/μL) and FeNO 
values < 25 ppb (rate ratio 0.71 [95% CI 0.50, 1.00]) was seen, although it needs to be noted that 
the magnitude of benefit for AAER reduction with tezepelumab increased with increasing levels of 
eosinophils and FeNO. As requested, this was highlighted in the SmPC section 5.1.  
Further clarity was requested on efficacy results in NAVIGATOR study subjects without type 2 
inflammation, i.e. in the subgroup of patients with both baseline blood eosinophil count <150 cells/µL 
and baseline FeNO <25 ppb. The applicant presented the requested subgroup analyses for the primary 
endpoint separately for the PATHWAY and NAVIGATOR studies. The applicant also presented subgroup 
analyses based on the pooled PATHWAY and NAVIGATOR studies. Each of the presented analyses 
suggested a positive treatment effect for tezepelumab in the subgroup of patients with both baseline 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 209/215 
 
 
 
blood eosinophil count <150 cells/µL and baseline FeNO <25 ppb, albeit of generally smaller 
magnitude and lesser precision than for the other three quadrants defined by baseline blood eosinophil 
count and baseline FeNO values. However, the effect is still considered clinically meaningful by the 
CHMP. As such, a restriction of indication to exclude patients with both baseline eosinophil count <150 
cells/µL and baseline FeNO <25 ppb was not considered warranted. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The Primary Safety Pool included 635 subjects (95.5%) that were treated with tezepelumab for ≥ 20 
weeks and 615 subjects (92.5%) that were treated with tezepelumab for ≥ 48 weeks. From the primary 
safety pool, tezepelumab 210mg Q4W had an acceptable safety profile. Most AEs were mild to moderate 
in severity, and reversible. The overall rates for AEs were comparable between tezepelumab and placebo 
treatment arms. SAEs were low and comparable across both treatment arms. The number of subjects 
that experienced ADRs was similar across both treatment groups, 9.0% and 8.1% in tezepelumab and 
placebo groups respectively. The most common ADRs were pharyngitis, rash, arthralgia, injection site 
reaction. 
For  the  Primary  Safety  Pool,  AESIs  included  serious  infections;  opportunistic  infections;  helminth 
infections;  anaphylactic  or  serious  allergic  reactions;  hypersensitivity  reactions;  malignancy;  injection 
site reactions and Guillain-Barré syndrome.  
Tezepelumab may demonstrate inhibitory effects on immune responses mediated by Th2 cells. However, 
for the AESI of serious infections, the numbers of SAEs in this SOC was low and comparable across both 
treatment groups, 2% vs 2.2% for tezepelumab and placebo treated patients.  
Opportunistic infections (as defined by the applicant) and helminth infections did not occur in the Primary 
Safety Pool. 
No anaphylactic or serious allergic reactions considered related to tezepelumab occurred in the Primary 
Safety  Pool.  One  case  of  grade  4  anaphylaxis  did  occur  in  the  280  mg  Q2W  tezepelumab  arm  of  the 
PATHWAY study, however this was due to a peanut allergy. The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions 
was comparable across both treatment groups.  
For malignancies, a similar albeit slightly higher number of subjects reported a malignancy in the on-
study period in the tezepelumab group compared to the placebo treated group, 7 subjects (1.1%) versus 
5 subjects (0.7%). One of these cases was considered related to tezepelumab, malignant melanoma in 
situ in a patient with underlying nevus pigmented as a risk factor for the event. The event occurred 103 
days after the first dose.  
The incidence of injection site reactions (ISRs) was low and comparable across both treatment arms in 
the  Primary  Safety  Pool  (3.8%  and  3.1%  in  the  tezepelumab  group  compared  to  the  placebo  treated 
group).  
A  single  case  of  Guillain-Barré  syndrome  occurred  in  the  tezepelumab  development  programme  in  a 
tezepelumab treated patient which was considered related to treatment. This case was confounded with 
a prior viral infection.  
In  the  initial  MA  application  and  study  reports,  4  deaths  occurred  in  the  tezepelumab  development 
programme, 2 of these occurred in placebo treated patients and were of no concern. The remaining 2 
deaths occurred in tezepelumab treated patients. One of the deaths was recorded as a cardiac arrest; 
this patient had confounding medical history and the event was not considered related to treatment. The 
other  death  in  a  tezepelumab  treated  patient  was  a  cerebrovascular  accident,  also  confounded  with 
hypertension, hypertensive encephalitis, elderly age and pneumonia treated at home.  
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022

The numbers of subjects that had AEs and ARs leading to discontinuation of IP was low and comparable 
across both treatment arms, 2.0% and 0.9% of subjects treated with tezepelumab group and 3.0% and 
1.2%  with  placebo  respectively.  In  the  tezepelumab  treatment  group,  no  PT  for  an  AE  leading  to 
discontinuation was reported in > 2 subjects.  
No safety concerns were raised with higher doses (up to 700mg) and a higher frequency of administration 
(Q7W) compared with the to-be marketed posology.  
Unanticipated  safety  issues  arose  when  the  safety  data  from  the  long-term  extension  study, 
DESTINATION was unblinded and an imbalance in serious cardiac events and fatal events emerged.  A 
total of 20 subjects reported 23 Cardiac disorder SOC SAEs in the on-study period, 18 subjects in the 
tezepelumab group and 2 subjects in the placebo  group. There  were 17 subjects with cardiac related 
SAEs on tezepelumab (n=840) and 0 subjects with events on placebo (n=607) during the on-treatment 
period. In total from the on-study pooled dataset, there were 13 events determined by the IAC to be 
MACE, 9 on tezepelumab treatment and 4 on placebo treatment. 
With  respect  to  cardiac  adverse  events  with  fatal  outcome  reported  during  on-study  period  in 
DESTINATION study, in total 3 cases of Fatal Cardiac disorder AEs (Cardiac arrest, Myocardial infarction, 
Acute left ventricular failure) were reported in tezepelumab treated patients (n=840) and 1 case of Fatal 
Cardiac  disorder  AEs  (Cardiac  failure)  were  reported  in  placebo  treated  patients  (n=607).  No  other 
Cardiac Disorder SOC Fatal AEs have been observed (beyond those observed in DESTINATION) within a 
broader pool of studies in asthma assessing 210 mg Q4W multiple dose, based on a total time at risk 
1606.2 years across all treated subjects. 9 pooled MACE CV deaths were recorded; 6 in All Teze and 3 
in Placebo group. A 10th death was adjudicated to be a CV death by the IAC. The 10th CV death occurred 
within the extended follow up (EFU) of the LTE study. 
The  pooled  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rates  for  overall  AEs  in  cardiac  disorders  (serious  and  non-
serious AEs) were similar between the tezepelumab and placebo groups. There were no obvious trends 
in  the  categories  of  PTs;  none  of  the  cardiac  SAEs  or  MACE  events  were  considered  related  to 
tezepelumab  based  on  investigator  and  blinded  IAC/sponsor  causality  (one  event  was  considered 
possibly related to the placebo); all patients had risk factors for cardiac disease (high blood pressure, 
former smoker, diabetes, obesity, age, being male, hypertension hypercholesterolemia), and a number 
of patients also had confounding medical cardiac history. No at-risk subgroup has been identified by the 
applicant. OCS at baseline did not result in increased risk of fatal cardiac events with tezepelumab. See 
section 3.5.  
Although  a  small  number  of  pregnancies  occurred  during  the  clinical  development  programme,  the 
studies excluded pregnant and lactating women, thus it is recommended not to use tezepelumab during 
pregnancy unless the expected benefit to the pregnant mother is greater than any possible risk to the 
foetus, and a risk to a breast-fed child cannot be excluded. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Clinical studies were limited to one year of treatment with a long-term extension study (DESTINATION) 
providing a further year of safety data. Results from this LTE study demonstrated numerical imbalances 
in cardiac SOC SAEs with more events occurring in the tezepelumab groups compared with placebo. While 
there is no known biological plausibility to explain why serious cardiac events would occur, it cannot be 
dismissed  that  treatment  with  tezepelumab  can  lead  to  an  increased  risk  of  serious  cardiac  events. 
Therefore, the applicant agreed to conduct a category 3 post-authorisation safety study (PASS) to further 
characterise the safety profile of Tezepelumab in the post-marketing setting (see RMP section 2.7). The 
applicant  will  also  continue  to  closely  monitor  this  important  potential  risk  as  part  of  future  PSURs.  In 
addition,  a  warning  has  been  added  to  SmPC  section  4.4.  to  inform  HCPs  that  ‘(…)  Patients  should  be 
Assessment report  
EMA/682391/2022  
Page 211/215 
 
 
 
advised of signs or symptoms suggestive of a cardiac event (for example, chest pain, dyspnoea, malaise, 
feeling lightheaded or faint) and to seek immediate medical attention if such symptoms occur. If patients 
develop a serious cardiac event while receiving tezepelumab treatment, therapy with tezepelumab should 
be discontinued until the acute event stabilises. (…)’. 
Serious infections will be monitored through pharmacovigilance activities and cautionary wording on this 
potential risk has been added to the SmPC section 4.4. This important potential risk will also be assessed 
as part of ongoing studies (See RMP section 2.7). 
While the updated data for the LTE DESTINATION study regarding malignancy during long-term (up to 
104 weeks of treatment) is reassuring, two years of follow up is considered too limited to out rule this 
risk. In light of the lack of long-term data available for this product to date, the long-term treatment for 
this chronic disease and given the theoretical risk; this safety concern will be further characterised in the 
post-marketing setting via follow-up questionnaire and ongoing studies listed as category 3 in the RMP 
(See RMP section 2.7).  
The use of tezepelumab in women with severe asthma during pregnancy will be addressed as part of 
category 3 PASS (see RMP section 2.7).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
There are 3 core studies that support the efficacy of tezepelumab; 2 of these were asthma exacerbation 
studies (NAVIGATOR and PATHWAY) and one was an oral corticosteroid (OCS)-reduction study. In the 
two exacerbation studies, in patients receiving tezepelumab, the annualised rate of severe exacerbation 
events statistically significantly decreased.   
In  the  NAVIGATOR  study,  tezepelumab  210  mg  SC  Q4W  treatment  reduced  the  rate  of  asthma 
exacerbations over 52 weeks by 56% compared with placebo (rate ratio 0.44 [95% CI 0.37, 0.53]; p < 
0.001). These results are considered as statistically significant and clinically relevant. In absolute terms 
also there was a significant reduction in the number of exacerbations as there was 0.93 exacerbation 
per year observed in the tezepelumab group and 2.1 exacerbation per year in the placebo group.  
In the PATHWAY study, the primary endpoint of the annualised AER measured at week 52 was also met. 
Statistically  significant  annualised  asthma  exacerbation  rate  reduction  (AERR)  of  71%  for  the  dose  of 
210 mg Q4W as compared with placebo was observed in the ITT population (p < 0.001). 
In the NAVIGATOR these results were further supported by other endpoints which investigated the effect 
on  exacerbations  (such  as  time  to  first  Asthma  and  proportion  of  Subjects  Experiencing  No  Asthma 
Exacerbations Over 52 Weeks) and the results of four key secondary endpoints (such as change from 
baseline  in  pre-bronchodilator  FEV1,  change  from  baseline  in  AQLQ(S)  +12  total  score,  change  from 
baseline in ACQ-6 score and change from baseline in weekly mean daily Asthma Symptom Diary score). 
The NAVIGATOR study enrolled patients with severe asthma as all patients had to be in at least GINA 
2021 step 4 (on medium- to high-dose ICS + one additional controller medication with or without OCS) 
with  poor  symptoms  control  (ACQ-6  score  ≥  1.5).  In  addition,  all  enrolled  patients  must  have  had  a 
Assessment report

history  of  ≥  2  asthma  exacerbations  requiring  treatment  with  systemic  corticosteroids  or  emergency 
department visit or in-patient hospitalisation in previous 12 months.  
While the initial safety data from the pivotal studies submitted did not raise any issues of concern, the 
safety data from the LTE DESTINATION study demonstrate a higher numerical incidence of cardiac SOC 
SAEs with more events occurring in the tezepelumab groups compared with placebo. All patients had risk 
factors  for  cardiac  disease  while  a  number  of  patients  also  had  a  confounding  medical  history. 
Nonetheless, the imbalance remained unexplained. While none of these cardiac SAEs were considered 
related  to  tezepelumab  by  investigators  and  there  is  no  known  plausible  mechanism  of  action  for 
tezepelumab or inhibition of TSLP affecting cardiac cells, an uncertainty remained concerning the long-
term safety profile of tezepelumab. Further characterisation of this important potential risk was therefore 
considered warranted. A category 3 PASS will be conducted by the applicant to further address this risk 
in the post-marketing setting. Further analysis did not identify any specific cohort at risk and cautionary 
wording has been added to the SmPC section 4.4.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
There  is  an  unmet  need  for  additional  biological  therapies  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  severe 
asthma especially in patients who do not have alternative treatment options to other currently approved 
products. 
Overall,  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  reductions  in  severe  asthma  exacerbations  in 
patients receiving tezepelumab 210 mg SC Q4W was recorded in the clinical studies provided in support 
of this application. The clinical efficacy results are robust. In view of the limited data supporting the use 
of tezepelumab in patients receiving medium ICS dose and in line with approved indications for biologic 
medicinal products in the same therapeutic area/class, the applicant agreed to restrict the indication in 
patients  receiving  high  ICS  dose  only.  There  is  a  trend  toward  higher  efficacy  in  patients  with  higher 
levels of eosinophils and/or FeNo, this is reflected in the SPC. However, the response to treatment for 
patients  with  both  baseline  eosinophil  count  <150  cells/µL  and  baseline  FeNO  <25  ppb  is  considered 
clinically relevant. 
While  there  is  no  known  biological  plausibility  to  explain  why  serious  cardiac  events  would  occur,  it 
cannot be dismissed that treatment with tezepelumab could lead to an increased risk of serious cardiac 
events with prolonged treatment. Therefore, the potential risk for serious cardiac adverse events will be 
further addressed in a PASS (category III). The product information has been updated to add cautionary 
wording in section 4.4 regarding the potential risks of cardiac events. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Tezspire is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Tezspire is favourable in the following indication: 
Tezspire is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults and adolescents 12 years and older 
with severe asthma who are inadequately controlled despite high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus 
Assessment report

another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that tezepelumab is to be 
qualified as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union. 
Refer to Appendix on new active substance (NAS).  
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0012/2020 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

2. Grounds for the COMP opinion 
Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2021 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
“The sponsor FGK Representative Service GmbH submitted on 22 March 2021 an application for 
designation as an orphan medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product 
containing loncastuximab tesirine for treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (hereinafter referred 
to as “the condition”). The application was submitted on the basis of Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of 
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing loncastuximab tesirine 
was considered justified based on clinical data showing complete responses achieved in patients 
with disease relapsed and refractory to the second line treatment; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to involvement of single or multiple nodal or extranodal 
sites, including the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow and life-threatening in patients not 
responding to first-line treatment; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 4.3 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made.  
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European Union, 
the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product 
containing loncastuximab tesirine will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The 
sponsor has provided clinical data that demonstrate that patients who relapsed and were refractory to 
at least two previous lines of therapies responded to treatment with the current product. The 
Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are cumulatively fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends 
the designation of this medicinal product, containing loncastuximab tesirine as an orphan medicinal 
product for the orphan condition: treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma”.

Condition 
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma histologically characterised 
by dense proliferation of neoplastic B-cells. It represents the most common histological subtype of 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL), the 10th most common cancer in the European Union (EU), and one 
of the major causes of cancer-related deaths, despite advances in therapy (ECIS, 2020). DLBCL 
accounts for 25% to 45% of all NHL cases worldwide (Wild et al, 2020), and although it can occur at 
any age, it typically affects older individuals (median age at presentation is >65 years), and it is 
slightly more frequent in males (Mounier et al, 2015). 
DLBCL usually arises de novo (primary DLBCL) but can also represent malignant transformation of 
indolent lymphomas such as follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) or chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), referred to as secondary DLBCL. 
Hereditary and acquired immunodeficiencies, occupational exposures, and pharmacological 
immunosuppression in the setting of transplantation or treatment of autoimmune diseases have been 
identified as factors thought to potentially confer increased risk of developing DLBCL. 
The clinical manifestations of DLBCL depend on the site of disease involvement. Patients usually 
present with a rapidly enlarging tumour mass at single or multiple nodal or extra-nodal sites. The 
majority of cases occur in the lymph nodes; approximately 40% of patients have extra-nodal 
involvement. The most common site of extra-nodal involvement is the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, 
ileocecal region), but DLBCL may occur in any organ/tissue including the bone, testes, spleen, skin, 
central nervous system (CNS), Waldeyer’s ring, salivary gland, thyroid, liver, kidneys, and adrenal 
glands. Many patients are asymptomatic, but symptoms may occur when tissues or organs are 
infiltrated. Pain in an enlarged lymph node or organ may be noted if the lymphomatous mass enlarges 
rapidly and can be associated with B-symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss). Other symptoms 
include pruritus, anorexia, fatigue, pedal oedema (caused by pelvic lymphadenopathy), chest 
discomfort (caused by mediastinal lymphadenopathy). Additional complications include end-organ 
damage from disease involvement and myelosuppression leading to infections, anaemia, and 
thrombocytopenia (Swerdlow et al, 2017; Said, 2013). 
In recognition of the unique clinical and pathological features of DLBCL subtypes and associated 
therapeutic implications, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated the previous 2008 
classification of lymphoid neoplasms in 2016 to include 2 subtypes of DLBCL based on cells of origin 
(GCB and ABC) as well as recognising co-expression of MYC and BCL2 as double-expressor lymphoma 
(DEL) (Swerdlow, Blood 2016; 127: 2375-2390). A new category of large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) 
called high grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) was introduced, which is now recognised as distinct from 
DLBCL (Sehn et al., 2021; Swerdlow et al., 2016). HGBL comprises two separate subcategories as 
follows: (1) HGBL with MYC, BCL2, and/or BCL6 translocations, which includes LBCL with MYC, BCL2, 
and/or BCL6 rearrangements, also known as “double- or triple-hit” lymphomas, and excludes follicular 
lymphoma or lymphoblastic lymphoma; and 2) HGBL NOS, which includes LBCL that are cytologically 
“high-grade” and would previously be characterized as B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable, and lack genetic 
features of double- or triple-hit lymphomas. According to the updated WHO classification of lymphoid 
neoplasms in 2016, the aggressive B-cell NHL subset LBCL now includes both DLBCL (including DLBCL 
NOS and other DLBCL subgroups) and HGBL subtypes, in addition to primary mediastinal large B-cell 
lymphoma (PMBCL). DLBCL accounts for >80% of all cases of LBCL and HGBL accounts for up to 13% 
of the LBCL cases. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Zynlonta as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and high-grade B-cell 
lymphoma (HGBL), after two or more lines of systemic therapy” falls within the scope of the 
designated orphan condition “Treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma”.

Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The sponsor discussed the severity of the disease and noted that the clinical course of DLBCL can be 
chronically debilitating due to constitutional symptoms, accompanying lymphadenopathy, end-organ 
damage from disease involvement, and myelosuppression leading to infections, anaemia and 
thrombocytopenia. 
The sponsor also discussed the life-threatening nature of the disease with approximately 75% of 
DLBCL patients with advanced stage disease (defined as Ann Arbor Stage III and IV or Stage I and II 
with associated B-symptoms or bulky disease ≥10 cm). Although the majority of patients 
(approximately 60%) are cured with immunochemotherapy, 10-15% of patients will be refractory to 
frontline therapy (no response or relapse within 3 months of therapy), and an additional 20-25% will 
relapse following initial response to therapy (Sehn and Gascoyne, 2015; Maurer et al, 2014; Patmore 
et al, 2019). The prognosis of patients whose disease is refractory to initial chemotherapy and who 
are, therefore, not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), or who relapse early after ASCT 
is extremely poor, particularly for those who have high risk factors. These patients have a poor 
response to salvage therapy, with an ORR of 26% (complete response rate [CRR] 7%), and a median 
survival of approximately 6 months (Crump et al, 2017). Thus, few patients are cured in the salvage 
setting, and most patients with DLBCL, who are ineligible for ASCT or who relapse after ASCT, have 
limited treatment options. 
The COMP agreed that the clinical course of the condition remains chronically debilitating due to 
constitutional symptoms, local symptoms of lymphadenopathy, end-organ damage from disease 
involvement, and bone marrow failure that may lead to infections, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia, 
and life-threatening in patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) disease who do not respond to 
treatment. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
No sources have been identified by the sponsor where the prevalence is given for DLBCL specifically 
therefore the sponsor estimated the prevalence using an indirect method based on incidence and 
disease duration data. For the incidence the sponsor used the incidence of NHL and the percentage of 
DLBCL from NHL based on literature sources. 
The DLBCL prevalence for the 27 European Union member states (EU-27) and the European Economic 
Area (EEA) was estimated using the formula: 
Prevalence (P) = Incidence (I) x Disease Duration (D), where 
• 
Incidence (I) was calculated using a 2-step approach where the known incidence of NHL in the 
EU/EEA was multiplied by the estimated proportion of NHL which corresponds to DLBCL. Based on 
the discussions above, the incidence of DLBCL was estimated at 0.6368/ 10,000 using a 
DLBCL/NHL proportion of 33% (Table 1).

Based on the above, the sponsor concluded on an average prevalence for DLBCL of 4.3 per 10,000 
persons in the EU. 
The COMP agreed with the sponsor’s proposal and concluded that the prevalence is 4.3 in 10,000 
persons in the European community based on most recent publications and updated registries. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The sponsor referred to the latest European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines for DLBCL, 
which describe some of the treatment strategies available to these patients in Europe and outlined the 
current standard of care in the first- and second-line setting based on the treatment guidelines (Tilly et 
al., 2015). The sponsor listed all centrally authorised treatment options for DLBCL in table 3, of which 
the majority of the medicinal products have been authorised in the EU after 2015 and are therefore not 
included in the current ESMO guidelines.

The sponsor’s product loncastuximab tesirine (Zynlonta) is intended to treat adult patients with r/r 
DLBCL and HGBL after two or more lines of systemic therapy. An overview of medicinal products 
authorised in the EU for r/r DLBCL and NHL in third- or later lines, and whether they are considered 
relevant for a discussion on the significant benefit of loncastuximab tesirine in r/r DLBCL and HGBL is 
given below. 
R-CHOP is standard of care in first line treatment, but not used after progression. For younger, high-risk 
patients, R-CHOEP is a valid option. Patients eligible for Zynlonta are r/r after two or more multi-agent 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

systemic treatment regimens and therefore for later lines of treatment. There is no need to discuss R-
CHOP on significant benefit since Zynlonta only covers patients with r/r disease.  
Pixuvri (pixantrone) is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with multiply r/r 
aggressive NHL. The benefit of pixantrone treatment has not been established in patients when used 
as fifth line or greater chemotherapy in patients who are refractory to last therapy. Although Zynlonta 
is to be used in r/r DLBCL, the therapeutic indications are not considered to be completely overlapping 
since Zynlonta is intended to be used in the third and later lines while Pixuvri is limited to the third and 
fourth lines. Therefore, Pixuvri is not considered a satisfactory method for the entire patient population 
covered by the therapeutic indication for Zynlonta and it should not be discussed under the significant 
benefit section. 
Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel; hereinafter referred to as axi-cel) is approved for the treatment of 
adult patients with r/r DLBCL and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), after two or 
more lines of systemic therapy (note: as of 14 October 2022, Yescarta is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) that relapses within 
12 months from completion of, or is refractory to, first-line chemoimmunotherapy). Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel; 
hereinafter referred to as tisa-cel) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with r/r DLBCL after 
two or more lines of systemic therapy.  
At the time of the simultaneous marketing authorisation of Kymriah and Yescarta, the WHO 
classification had recently been updated, recognising HGBL as distinct from DLBCL (Swerdlow, Blood 
2016; 127: 2375-2390). This separation, however, had not been recognised neither for the enrolment 
of patients into the pivotal trials for the authorised CAR-T cell products, nor for the purpose of the 
wording of the approved indications. Patients classified nowadays as HGBL had indeed been included 
into the pivotal trials for both Yescarta and Kymriah and were also referenced to in their European 
public assessment reports (EPARs) and in section 5.1 of the SmPC for Yescarta. It was therefore the 
understanding of the COMP that the reference to DLBCL in the therapeutic indications as stated in 
section 4.1 of the approved SmPC still covered HGBL for both of these two chimeric antigen receptor 
(CAR)-T cell products. 
Polivy (polatuzumab vedotinin) in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 
prednisone (R-CHP) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated DLBCL, 
and in combination with bendamustine and rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with r/r DLBCL 
who are not candidates for haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). As Polivy should be used only 
in r/r DLBCL patients who are not candidates for HSCT, the therapeutic indications of Polivy and 
Zynlonta are not considered to be completely overlapping. Polivy is therefore not considered a 
satisfactory method for the whole target population for Zynlonta and should not be discussed under 
the significant benefit section. 
Breyanzi (lisocabtagene maraleucel; hereinafter referred to as liso-cel) is indicated for the treatment of 
adult patients with r/r DLBCL, PMBCL and follicular lymphoma grade 3B (FL3B), after two or more lines 
of systemic therapy. The target patient population for Breyanzi overlaps with the intended target 
population for Zynlonta since Breyanzi also covers the HGBL subset (section 5.1 of Breyanzi SmPC) 
and is therefore considered as a satisfactory method. 
Finally, Minjuvi (tafasitamab) is indicated in combination with lenalidomide followed by Minjuvi 
monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with r/r DLBCL who are not eligible for ASCT. As 
Minjuvi should be used only in r/r DLBCL patients who are not candidates for HSCT, the therapeutic 
indications of Minjuvi and Zynlonta are not considered to be completely overlapping. Minjuvi is

therefore not considered a satisfactory method for the entire target population for Zynlonta and should 
not be discussed under the significant benefit section. 
In conclusion, the approved CAR-T cell products in the third- and later lines setting, specifically 
Yescarta, Kymriah, and Breyanzi, are considered satisfactory methods relevant for a discussion on the 
significant benefit of loncastuximab tesirine in r/r DLBCL and HGBL and will be discussed below. 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor did not ask for protocol assistance for the justification of significant benefit. 
The claim of significant benefit is based on the results from the pivotal study for loncastuximab tesirine 
called LOTIS-2 (also known as ADCT-402-201), which is an open-label, single-arm phase 2 study 
conducted in 145 adult patients with r/r DLBCL and HGBL after at least 2 prior systemic regimens. The 
trial excluded patients with bulky disease and active central nervous system lymphoma. Patients 
received Zynlonta 0.15 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 2 cycles, then 0.075 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 
subsequent cycles.  
Of the 145 patients enrolled, the diagnosis was DLBCL not otherwise specified (NOS) in 88% (including 
20% with DLBCL arising from low grade lymphoma) and HGBL in 7%. The median number of prior 
therapies was 3 (range: 2 to 7). Overall, 43% of the patients received 2 prior therapies, whereas 24% 
received 3 prior therapies and 32% received more than 3 prior therapies. A total of 63% of the 
patients had refractory disease, 17% had a pre-treatment history with prior stem cell transplant (SCT), 
and 9.7% with prior CAR-T cell therapy.  
Efficacy was established on the basis of overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by an Independent 
Review Committee (IRC) using the Lugano 2014 criteria. The primary endpoint of the pivotal study, 
IRC-assessed ORR, was 48.3% (70/145; 95% CI: 39.9, 56.7), and complete response (CR) was 24.1% 
(35/145; 95% CI:17.4, 31.9). The median duration of response (DOR) for the responding subjects was 
13.37 months (95% CI: 6.87, NE). 
The sponsor claimed a SB of Zynlonta in r/r DLBCL and HGBL based on the following arguments: 
•  Zynlonta (loncastuximab tesirine) versus Yescarta (axi-cel) 
The sponsor claimed the significant benefit of loncastuximab tesirine versus axi-cel based on improved 
safety according to matching adjusted indirect comparisons (MAIC).  
Study ADCT-402-201 in loncastuximab tesirine and the ZUMA-1 study in axi-cel differed in their 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. The ZUMA-1 study (N=101 infused population) limited enrolment to 
patients who were either (a) refractory to chemotherapy or (b) relapsed within 12 months after ASCT. 
After application of the necessary inclusion/exclusion criteria from ZUMA-1 to LOTIS-2, only 88 of 145 
patients of the patients in LOTIS-2 complied with the ZUMA-1 inclusion/exclusion criteria. After 
matching, the ESS of the loncastuximab tesirine cohort was further reduced to 54.  
All efficacy outcomes considered favoured axi-cel over loncastuximab tesirine, including response rates 
(ORR difference=-33.4%, 95% CI: -49.1% to -16.6%, p<0.001; CRR difference=-37.3%, 95% CI: 
50.8% to -21.8%, p<0.001) (Table 5 and Lonca MAIC Analysis Report, 2022 [MAIC analysis of 
loncastuximab tesirine vs. CAR-T cell therapies and pixantrone]) and progression-free survival (PFS) 
and overall survival (OS) (PFS HR=1.92, 95% CI: 1.27 to 2.91, p=0.002; OS HR=2.02, 95% CI: 1.32 
to 3.01, p=0.001).

Taking into account the 9% of patients who were not infused with axi-cel, in the MAIC analysis using 
data for the leukapheresed population of the ZUMA-1 study (N=111), the differences in ORR and CRR 
became slightly smaller, although the direction and statistical significance of treatment effects were the 
same as those obtained in the analyses using data for the axi-cel infused population (ORR 
difference= -24.8%, 95% CI: -40.7% to -9.7%, p=0.002; CRR difference=-33.6%, 95% CI: -45.8% 
to -18.9%, p<0.001).  
The sponsor claimed that the MAIC analysis demonstrated a more favourable safety profile of 
loncastuximab tesirine in comparison to axi-cel, with significantly lower incidence for 18 of the 27 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs. The largest differences were for Grade ≥3 anaemia (5.6% vs. 45.4%, p<0.001), 
decreased neutrophil count (0.0% vs. 32.4%, p<0.001), decreased platelet counts (0.0% vs. 29.6%, 
p<0.001), and febrile neutropenia (1.4% vs. 32.4%, p<0.001). Grade ≥3 increased gamma-
glutamyltransferase (GGT) was the only statistically significant Grade ≥3 TEAE for which the incidence 
was greater for loncastuximab tesirine vs. axi-cel (22.4% vs. 0.0%, p<0.001) (Table 6).

In conclusion, the sponsor claimed that the results of the MAIC analysis suggest that, in patients with 
r/r DLBCL and HGBL, loncastuximab tesirine is likely to have a generally more favourable safety profile 
than axi-cel. There is no observed risk for cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and the largest 
statistically significant differences in favour of loncastuximab tesirine included any Grade ≥3 TEAE and

(all Grade ≥3) anaemia, decreased platelet count and decreased neutrophil count, neutropenia, and 
febrile neutropenia.  
The COMP considered that given the limited experience with Zynlonta thus far, the claim of better 
safety in comparison to Yescarta cannot be concluded on at present stage and cannot be quantified in 
the setting of an indirect comparison where confounding by indication and selection bias cannot be 
assessed.  
In addition, the efficacy of loncastuximab tesirine was shown to be inferior compared to axi-cel in the 
MAIC. While the difference in efficacy outcomes is less when the analysis is based on the enrolled or 
leukapheresed population, the CAR-T cell product still appears to provide more benefit to the target 
patient population. The reduced benefit reflects the logistical challenge of providing CAR-T cell 
therapies to all patients who may qualify for this treatment option. In addition to the possible safety 
benefit with loncastuximab tesirine, a potential major contribution to patient care was highlighted by 
the sponsor since that treatment requires no bridging- or pre-treatment therapy and can be used in all 
centres specialised in treating oncology patients. Additionally, it can be provided without delay to 
patients suffering from a highly aggressive disease.  
Regarding efficacy, the sponsor should present the efficacy results from the 9.7% of patients who 
received prior CAR-T cell therapy in the pivotal study LOTIS-2 for Zynlonta and provide more details of 
the type of CAR-T cell therapies that they received. 
•  Zynlonta (loncastuximab tesirine) versus Kymriah (tisa-cel) 
The sponsor claimed the significant benefit of loncastuximab tesirine versus tisa-cel based on improved 
safety according to MAIC.  
Based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the JULIET study (also known as study C2201; N=115 
infused population), data from 37 patients in LOTIS-2 were excluded, since only 108 of 145 of the 
patients in LOTIS-2 complied with the JULIET inclusion/exclusion criteria. After matching, the effective 
sample size (ESS) of the loncastuximab tesirine cohort was further reduced to 56.  
There were no statistically significant differences between loncastuximab tesirine and tisa-cel in any of 
the efficacy outcomes compared (ORR: 51.7% vs 53.0%, difference=-1.4%, 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: -17.0% to 15.0%; CRR: 25.2% vs 39.1%, difference= -13.9%, 95% CI: -27.9% to 0.1%) (Table 
7 and Lonca MAIC Analysis Report, 2022 [MAIC analysis of loncastuximab tesirine vs. CAR-T cell 
therapies and pixantrone]). Similar observations were made for PFS and OS (PFS hazard ratio 
[HR]=0.87, 95% CI: 0.55 to 1.38; OS HR=1.11, 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.71).

The sponsor claimed that the results of the MAIC analysis suggest that, in patients with r/r DLBCL and 
HGBL, loncastuximab tesirine is likely to have a generally more favourable safety profile than tisa-cel. 
There is no observed risk for CRS, and the largest statistically significant differences in favour of 
loncastuximab tesirine included any Grade ≥3 TEAE and (all Grade ≥3) anaemia, decreased platelet 
count, decreased neutrophil count, febrile neutropenia and decreased white blood cell count (Table 8).

In addition, the sponsor claimed that the efficacy of loncastuximab tesirine may be similar to that of 
tisa-cel. The same arguments as above regarding the availability of the CAR-T cell products have been 
used by the sponsor.  
The COMP considered that given the limited experience with Zynlonta thus far, the claim of better 
safety in comparison to Kymriah cannot be concluded on at present stage and no adequate 
quantification is possible in the proposed indirect comparison. Regarding efficacy, the sponsor should 
present the efficacy results from the 9.7% of patients who received prior CAR-T cell therapy in the 
pivotal study LOTIS-2 for Zynlonta and provide more details of the type of CAR-T cell therapies that 
they received. 
•  Zynlonta (loncastuximab tesirine) versus Breyanzi (liso-cel) 
The sponsor claimed the significant benefit of loncastuximab tesirine versus liso-cel based on improved 
safety according to MAIC.  
Although the results of a phase 2 study of liso-cel in 46 patients with r/r aggressive B-cell NHL 
(NCT03484702; TRANSCENDWORLD) were included in the EMA assessment of the marketing 
authorisation application for Breyanzi, this study was not included in the analysis because these data 
were published in January 2022, which was after the literature search was conducted for the MAIC 
analysis (October 2021). 
The MAIC analysis included the data from TRANSCEND study (NCT02631044) (N=269 infused 
population receiving conforming liso-cel, N=256 efficacy population). Data from 19 patients in LOTIS-2 
were excluded, reducing the sample size for loncastuximab tesirine from 145 to 126 patients. After 
matching, the ESS for loncastuximab tesirine cohort was further reduced to 50.  
The ORR and CRR statistically favoured liso-cel over loncastuximab tesirine (ORR difference= -28.3%, 
95% CI: -42.0% to -13.3%, p<0.001; CRR difference=-28.3%, 95% CI:  -40.9% to -13.3%, 
p<0.001) (Table 9). Although PFS and OS also were numerically greater for liso-cel, treatment effects 
on these outcomes were statistically significant only for OS (PFS HR=1.28, 95% CI: 0.82 to 2.01, 
p=0.284; OS HR=1.55, 95% CI: 1.07 to 2.25, p=0.021).

In the MAIC analysis using data for the leukapheresed population of the TRANSCEND study (N=345), 
differences in response rates and OS were smaller, though the results still statistically favoured liso-cel 
(ORR difference=-21.6%, 95% CI: -33.0% to -8.1%, p=0.001; CRR difference= -21.6%, 95% 
CI: -31.6% to -10.4%, p<0.001; OS HR=1.40, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.93, p=0.039).  
Loncastuximab tesirine had statistically significantly lower incidences of Grade ≥3 anaemia (15.6% vs. 
37.5%, p=0.001), febrile neutropenia (2.6% vs. 8.9%, p=0.001), and neutropenia (25.6% vs. 59.9%, 
p<0.001) (Table 10). Grade ≥3 increased GGT was greater with loncastuximab tesirine vs. liso-cel 
(19.3% vs. 0.0%, p<0.001).

In conclusion, the sponsor claimed that the results of the MAIC analysis suggest that, in patients with 
r/r DLBCL and HGBL, loncastuximab tesirine is likely to have a generally more favourable safety profile 
than liso-cel. There is no observed risk for CRS, and the largest statistically significant differences in 
favour of loncastuximab tesirine included (all Grade ≥3) anaemia, neutropenia, and febrile 
neutropenia.  
In addition, the efficacy of loncastuximab tesirine is likely to be less than that of liso-cel in patients 
with r/r DLBCL and HGBL. The same arguments as above regarding the availability of the CAR-T cell 
products have been used by the sponsor.  
The COMP considered that given the limited experience with Zynlonta thus far, the claim of better 
safety in comparison to Breyanzi cannot be concluded on at present stage and no adequate 
quantification is possible in the proposed indirect comparison. 
Regarding the claim of significant benefit, the sponsor was requested to present the efficacy results 
from the 9.7% of patients who received prior CAR-T cell therapy in the pivotal study LOTIS-2 for 
Zynlonta and provide more details of the type of CAR-T cell therapies that they received. 
4. COMP list of issues 
Significant benefit of loncastuximab tesirine over the approved CAR-T cell products for the target 
patient population, tisa-cel (Kymriah), axi-cel (Yescarta) and liso-cel (Breyanzi) is not considered 
established based on the data presented. The sponsor should specifically provide more information on 
the subset of patients who had been pre-treated with the approved CAR-T cell therapies with regards 
to: 
• 
• 
disease status at the time of the CAR-T cell treatment (relapse or refractory disease), 
the best response and duration of response as achieved with treatment with Zynlonta reported for 
each subgroup of patients who were pre-treated with the individual CAR-T cell therapies 
separately.

Comments on sponsor’s response to the COMP list of issues 
The sponsor has presented more data from the 14 patients (9.7%; 14/145) in the pivotal study LOTIS-
2 who had previously received CAR-T cell therapy before study entry as requested to further justify the 
claim for significant benefit of loncastuximab tesirine over tisa-cel, axi-cel, and liso-cel in the third- and 
later lines setting for the target patient population. In addition, data from those patients who had not 
been treated with any CAR-T cell product prior to study entry was provided for comparison with the 
subset of patients who were pre-treated with this class of therapy. 
The sponsor has provided - based on a data cut-off (DCO) date of 01/Mar/2022 - the best responses 
for each of the 14 patients: (i) to prior anticancer therapies immediately before infusion with the CAR-
T cell therapies; (ii) to the CAR-T cell therapies administered and to (iii) Zynlonta. Nine of these 
patients had progressed after CAR-T cell therapy, four patients were refractory to this treatment, and 
for one patient this information was not available. 
The ORR and CRR achieved in patients who had or had not received CAR-T cell therapies prior to 
Zynlonta treatment are presented in Table 11. The study protocol did not require information of the 
type of prior CAR-T cell therapy to be captured in the clinical database, and hence the type of CAR-T 
cell therapy was not available for 6 patients (42.9%; 6/14). For the remaining 8 patients, 7 patients 
received axi-cel, and one patient received liso-cel as prior therapy. Of the three patients who achieved 
CR after Zynlonta treatment, one patient received axi-cel, and two received CAR-T cell products 
without further specification. Of the three patients who had PR after Zynlonta treatment, one received 
axi-cel, one received liso-cel, and the other received CAR-T cell therapy without any further 
specification by the site in the clinical database. The median DOR was 13.37 months (95% CI: 5.98, 
NR) in patients without prior CAR-T cell therapy and not estimable in patients with prior CAR-T cell 
therapy due to the small sample size and the very limited follow-up in the majority of the patients (see 
swimmer plot, Figure 1).

The sponsor concluded that although the number of patients who had received prior CAR-T cell 
therapies in the pivotal study LOTIS-2 is small, the anti-tumour activity is comparable between 
patients who had failed (relapsed after/refractory to) prior CAR-T cell therapies and patients who had 
not received prior CAR-T cell therapies before study entry. Therefore, in the opinion of the sponsor, 
patients who had failed prior CAR-T cell therapies could still be successfully treated with Zynlonta, as 
shown by the clinical response rates observed, even though both therapeutics target the B-cell specific 
surface marker CD19. Zynlonta could therefore, in the opinion of the sponsor, offer an important 
treatment option for patients with r/r DLBCL and HGBL who have failed prior CAR-T cell therapy. 
The COMP agreed that the data provided from the 14 patients in the pivotal study LOTIS-2 (DCO: 1 
March 2022) who had previously received CAR-T cell therapy before study entry indicated that 
loncastuximab tesirine may offer benefit for these patients since they achieved an ORR of 42.9% 
(6/14; 95% CI: 17.7, 71.1), whereas those who had not been treated with any CAR-T cell product 
prior to study entry had an ORR of 48.9% (64/131; 95% CI: 40.0, 57.5). However, the median DOR 
was not estimable in patients with prior CAR-T cell therapy due to the small sample size, and the 
confidence interval for the observed ORR in these patients was also rather wide.  
In general, the response rate alone is not considered sufficient to conclude on any beneficial effect and 
the information on the durability of the observed responses was regarded as too limited for at least 9 
of the 14 patients. In addition, the prior treatment was not known to comprise all the three approved 
CAR-T cell products constituting the satisfactory methods. In particular, only two of the 7 patients who 
previously received axi-cel were reported to have achieved a response to loncastuximab tesirine (one 
had a CR and the other a PR). Both patients had relapsed after prior treatment with axi-cel. The 
patient who was recorded to have relapsed after prior treatment with liso-cel obtained a PR to 
loncastuximab tesirine. In addition, none of the patients for whom the type of prior CAR-T cell therapy 
received were reported had received tisa-cel. 
In view of the uncertainties associated with the clinical relevance of the treatment of patients with 
relapsed disease after CAR-T cell therapy, the statistically significant lower efficacy in the setting of the 
MAICs still remain. Therefore, the COMP considers that the data provided does not allow a positive 
conclusion on the equivalence of loncastuximab tesirine versus the authorised CAR-T cell therapies 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

Page 23/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Yescarta and Breyanzi in terms of efficacy. With regard to Yescarta (axi-cel), loncastuximab tesirine is 
inferior, at least in terms of survival. With regard to liso-cel (Breyanzi), loncastuximab tesirine is 
inferior in terms of ORR and CRR. Furthermore, the results for PFS and OS do not look favourable. 
With regards to tisa-cel (Kymriah), the COMP noted the absence of statistically significant differences 
with respect to efficacy. 
The COMP considered that given the limited experience with Zynlonta thus far, the claim of better 
safety in comparison to Yescarta, Kymriah, and Breyanzi cannot be concluded on at present stage and 
cannot be quantified in the setting of an indirect comparison where confounding by indication and 
selection bias cannot be assessed. Therefore, the clinical relevance of the observed different toxicity 
profile cannot be judged, especially in the absence of objective criteria for selecting salvage therapy. 
On balance, the COMP considered that there is no conclusive evidence on which to establish the claim 
of better safety of Zynlonta over the satisfactory methods of treatment. 
Regarding the sponsors’ argument that treatment with loncastuximab tesirine requires no bridging- or 
pre-treatment therapy and can be used in all centres specialised in treating oncology patients without 
delays to patients suffering from a highly aggressive disease, the COMP acknowledged it. However, it 
should be recalled that a product's claim of major contribution to patient care may not be established 
in the absence of the demonstration of the product’s equivalence in terms of efficacy, safety, and 
benefit/risk balance with the relevant authorised medicinal products, i.e., in this case tisa-cel, axi-cel, 
and liso-cel. Reference is made, in this respect, to the 2016 “Commission notice on the application of 
Articles 3, 5 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products” (available at: 
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:JOC_2016_424_R_0003&from=EN). 
Based on the data provided by the sponsor, a positive conclusion on the product’s (loncastuximab 
tesirine) equivalence in terms of efficacy, safety, and benefit/risk balance vis a vis the authorised 
products versus axi-cel (Yescarta), tisa-cel (Kymriah), and liso-cel (Breyanzi) cannot be drawn. In 
turn, a claim of major contribution to patient care cannot be established. 
In conclusion, the COMP is of the opinion that the data presented by the sponsor does not allow a 
positive conclusion on the significant benefit of loncastuximab tesirine versus axi-cel (Yescarta), tisa-
cel (Kymriah), and liso-cel (Breyanzi).

5. COMP position adopted on 6 October 2022 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 4.3 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to constitutional symptoms, local symptoms of 
lymphadenopathy, end-organ damage from disease involvement, and bone marrow failure that 
may lead to infections, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia, and life-threatening in patients not 
responding to treatment; 
the sponsor’s claim that Zynlonta is of significant benefit to those affected by the orphan  
condition does not hold since the sponsor could not establish the existence of a clinically relevant 
advantage over Yescarta, Kymriah and Breyanzi which are authorised satisfactory methods of 
treatment.  
−  A different safety profile of Zynlonta compared to the approved CAR-T cell products cannot be 
concluded as being better based on the limited experience with Zynlonta and in the setting of 
an indirect comparison where confounding by indication and selection bias cannot be excluded. 
− 
In addition, matching-adjusted indirect comparisons between the patient populations from the 
pivotal trials for Zynlonta and the approved CAR-T cell products, which were considered as 
satisfactory methods of treatment for the target patient population, showed a statistically 
significant inferior efficacy of Zynlonta in comparison to Yescarta and Breyanzi.  
−  The data on individual patients failing prior treatment with CAR-T cell therapy before study 
entry were considered inconclusive in view of the overall low number of patients in this subset, 
limited information on the type of treatment received and with limited follow-up, so that the 
clinical relevance of responses could not be reliably determined.  
− 
Furthermore, the claim for major contribution to patient care cannot be accepted when the 
efficacy is not established as being comparative. 
The data submitted did not allow the COMP to conclude that the claim for significant benefit  
of loncastuximab tesirine over the satisfactory methods of treatment for adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory DLBCL and HGBL in the third- and later lines setting has been appropriately demonstrated. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are not satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Zynlonta, loncastuximab tesirine 
for treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (EU/3/21/2481) is removed from the Community 
Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

6. Appeal to the negative opinion adopted on 6 October 2022 
Grounds for appeal 
The sponsor presented detailed grounds for appeal (EMA/OD/0000115078) on 24 October 2022. 
The detailed grounds for appeal were further addressed by the sponsor at an oral explanation before 
the COMP on 8 November 2022. 
Comments on the grounds of appeal 
The data submitted by the sponsor previously did not allow the COMP to conclude that the claim for 
significant benefit of loncastuximab tesirine (Zynlonta) over the satisfactory methods of treatment for 
adult patients with r/r DLBCL and HGBL in the third- and later-line setting (i.e. the CAR-T cell products 
Yescarta, Kymriah, Breyanzi) has been appropriately demonstrated.  For ease of reference, these three 
products (namely, the satisfactory methods of treatment), will be referred to collectively in this Report 
as CAR-T cell products or CAR-T cell therapy/therapies.  
In particular, the sponsor had submitted in the context of the initial review a claim of clinically relevant 
advantage (specifically, better safety) and a claim of major contribution to patient care (the latter 
based on the arguments that treatment with Zynlonta requires no bridging- or pre-treatment therapy; 
that Zynlonta can be used in all centres specialised in treating oncology patients; and that Zynlonta 
can be provided without delay to patients suffering from a highly aggressive disease).  
It bears recalling that the claim of major contribution to patient care may only be granted if the 
sponsor first establishes the equivalence in terms of efficacy and safety between the candidate orphan 
products and the satisfactory methods of treatment. As the sponsor failed to establish the equivalence 
of the compared products in terms of efficacy, the claim of major contribution to patient care could not 
be accepted. 
In the context of the initial review, a negative opinion was adopted by the COMP. The sponsor’s appeal 
comprises two grounds. Under the first ground of appeal, and in support of a claim of clinically relevant 
advantage, the sponsor focuses on alleged limitations in the availability of CAR-T cell therapies 
resulting in alleged harm for r/r DLBCL patients (Ground 1). Under the second ground of appeal, the 
sponsor claims that Zynlonta provides supposedly a clinically relevant advantage for specific subsets of 
r/r DLBCL patients (Ground 2). The specific arguments in support of Grounds 1 and 2 are partly 
overlapping and are discussed below. 
These grounds for maintaining the orphan designation are different from the arguments submitted in 
the initial maintenance report and discussed during the oral explanation in October 2022 in that the 
sponsor is not claiming significant benefit due to a more favourable safety profile, better efficacy in 
leukapheresed population, or major contribution to patient care over the authorised satisfactory 
methods of treatment. 
However, before discussing the detailed arguments from the sponsor, it bears recalling that the COMP 
requires conclusive evidence in support of any significant benefit claims made. It is also important to 
bear in mind that the efficacy of Zynlonta has shown to be inferior compared to the authorised CAR-T 
cell products Yescarta and Breyanzi; and that Zynlonta had numerically lower Complete Remission 
Rates (CRR) as compared to Kymriah. 
Ground 1: Significant benefit because of the serious limitations on availability of CAR-T cell therapy 
resulting in harm for r/r DLBCL patients 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000094879 
Page 26/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
First, the sponsor presents data in support of the claim that there are serious limitations on the 
availability of CAR-T cell therapies throughout the EU (4.2). Second, the sponsor presents data in 
support of their claim of patient harm as a result of the CAR-T cell therapy availability limitations (4.3). 
Third, the sponsor presents data in support of the claim that Zynlonta can address the limitations on 
availability of CAR-T cell therapy for r/r DLBCL patients (4.4).  
As noted in the appeal, the sponsor "fully realises that lack of availability of existing therapies only 
exceptionally supports a finding of significant benefit" (emphasis added). 
Indeed, the 2016 "Commission notice on the application of Articles 3, 5 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 
141/2000 on orphan medicinal products" (2016/C 424/03; “2016 Commission Notice”, hereinafter) 
clarifies that “significant benefit should not be based on possible increased supply/availability due to 
shortages of existing authorised products or to existing products being authorised in only one or a 
limited number of Member States (exceptions may be made if the sponsor has evidence of patient 
harm” (emphasis added). 
In this respect, it also bears recalling briefly the framework for the authorisation of a medicinal product 
as orphan on the basis of a finding of significant benefit vis-à-vis (already authorised) satisfactory 
methods of treatment. In accordance with the established case-law of the Court of Justice of the 
European Union, "it is apparent from the wording of Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation No 141/2000 and the 
spirit underlying the system established by that regulation that the criteria for a finding of significant 
benefit are strict" (emphasis added; in this respect, see: judgment of the General Court of 5 December 
2018 in BMS v Commission and EMA, T-329/16, EU:T:2018:878, paragraph 101).  
Further, it should be noted that, in the absence of conclusive evidence proving significant benefit at the 
time of the marketing authorisation, the COMP is required to conclude that the designation criteria laid 
down in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 are no longer met and, therefore, recommend that 
the Commission should remove the medicinal product concerned from the Community Register of 
orphan medicinal products (in this respect, see: judgment of the General Court of 5 December 2018 in 
BMS v Commission and EMA, T-329/16, EU:T:2018:878, paragraph 86). This requirement is aligned 
with the fact that, for the purpose of maintenance of orphan designation, the comparative analysis 
between the new medicinal product and the reference product must establish not only that the new 
product provides a benefit to patients but also that benefit is significant (in this respect, see: judgment 
of the General Court of 16 May 2019 in GMPO v Commission, T-733/17, EU: T:2019:334, paragraph 
39).  
According to the SmPC (section 4.2) of the currently authorised CAR-T cell products, all have to be 
given in qualified treatment centres, whereas Zynlonta must only be administered under the 
supervision of a healthcare professional experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients. 
Under this section of the appeal, the sponsor points out that several member states have limited (one 
centre Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Ireland, Norway, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia) or none (Cyprus, 
Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Estonia) CAR-T cell treatment centres. In addition, the sponsor 
notes that patients have to be in the vicinity of the specialised centre until at least 4 weeks after 
treatment for safety monitoring.  
While the COMP acknowledged these arguments, no data was presented which would suggest that 
patients in these countries with few/no qualified CAR-T cell treatment centres are not adequately 
managed resulting in patient harm.  
In particular, as acknowledged by the sponsor, the Union legal framework (in particular, Regulation 
(EC) No 883/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the coordination 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000094879 
Page 27/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of social security systems and Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 
March 2011 on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare) facilitates the treatment 
of patients in other Member States. As noted in the 12 May 2022 “Report from the Commission to the 
European Parliament and the Council on the operation of Directive 2011/24/EU on the application of 
patients' rights in cross-border healthcare” (COM(2022) 210 final), “[t]he Directive has had a 
substantial impact in the area of rare diseases with the creation of the ERNs to support the diagnosis 
and treatment of rare disease patients” (emphasis added). 
The fact that, generally speaking, “cumbersome and disproportionate administrative procedures [that] 
undermine citizens’ rights to cross-border healthcare [exist] in some Member States” does not entail 
that patients in the EU do not have, in particular, access to CAR-T cell treatment.  
On balance, the fact that there are limited qualified treatment centres in some Member States does not 
demonstrate the lack of availability of CAR-T cell treatment in the EU; let alone any patient harm as a 
result of such alleged lack of availability. 
Last, and without prejudice to the above, the COMP noted that it is currently not known what the 
future availability of Zynlonta will be across the EU. The sponsor did not provide any evidence to that 
effect.  
(4.2.2) The sponsor also discusses possible availability constraints of CAR-T cell products at individual 
patient level, owing to specific manufacturing challenges of these products combined with rapid disease 
progression. Across the 3 autologous CAR-T cell therapies investigated in large clinical studies, patients 
had to wait a median time between 2 weeks and more than 50 days, but organizational and process-
related problems can further prolong the time from leukapheresis to CAR-T cell product delivery (vein 
to vein time) or, in some cases, the manufacturing may even fail. In these situations, an “off-the-shelf” 
medicinal product for immediate administration, such as Zynlonta, may be an alternative treatment 
option, especially when the disease progresses rapidly.  
While the manufacturing challenges at individual patient level are acknowledged by the COMP, it is 
pointed out that failed initial manufacturing attempts may be successful in a subsequent manufacturing 
attempt for an individual patient. The fact that the initial manufacturing of CAR-T cell products may not 
end up being successful for some patients (whose identity, incidentally, is not possible to ascertain a 
priori, before the manufacturing attempt) does not entail that CAR-T cell therapy will not be eventually 
available for those patients; or that those patients are exposed to patient harm. It is noted that CAR-T-
cell products were more effective than Zynlonta in indirect comparisons, also when patients for whom 
the production of CAR-T cells was not successful and thus could not be administered during the pivotal 
studies were taken into account.  
Furthermore, the link between CAR-T cell manufacturing challenges at individual patient level and a 
recognized “shortage” in overall CAR-T cell availability was not considered established by the data 
presented.  
Last, and without prejudice to the above, the COMP also notes that none of the authorised CAR-T cell 
products is mentioned in the EMA’s published catalogue of shortages: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/post-authorisation/availability-
medicines/shortages-catalogue  
With regard to the duration of the CAR-T cell product manufacturing in relation to the dynamics of 
disease progression, the COMP considers that this is overlapping with the arguments on Ground 2 
below, more specifically (5.2) of the sponsors arguments, and will be discussed below. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000094879 
Page 28/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(4.2.3) The sponsor also summarizes reports on actual use of CAR-T cell therapies in several EU 
member states. Based on a survey conducted in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the United 
Kingdom in 2022, among patients treated with systemic therapy alone in a third-line setting of r/r 
DLBCL, only 26% received CAR-T cell therapies (13% each, for Yescarta and Kymriah) (CancerMPact® 
2022). An analysis conducted to examine patient access to CAR-T cell therapies in Italy using publicly 
available data and to uncover potential systemic barriers indicated that in 2020 around 190 Italian 
DLBCL patients were not treated with a licensed CAR T-cell therapy despite being CAR-T eligible under 
the criteria defined by AIFA (Jommi et al. 2022). The reasons for this were mainly linked to the 
complexity of these resource-intense therapies including structural and organizational challenges 
(specialized treatment centers, product manufacturing, etc). 
These arguments were duly noted by the COMP, but similar to the above, no data was presented which 
would link the sponsor’s observations to patient harm in the respective EU member states. The fact 
that that 26% of patients in the third-line setting of r/r DLBCL received CAR-T cell therapies does not 
entail that the remaining patients did not have access to CAR-T cell treatment or that they were 
exposed to patient harm. In principle, the recommendation of the treatment of patients in any setting 
(and, in particular, at an advanced stage of DLBCL) rests with the treating physicians, who may at 
their discretion recommend an alternative course of disease management. Further, the treatment 
strategy is discussed, as applicable, between the treating physicians and the respective patient. The 
fact that CAR-T cell treatment was not followed for the remaining patient population in this setting 
does not necessarily mean that such treatment was not available; or that patients were otherwise 
exposed to harm. 
As regards the access data for DLBCL CAR T-cell therapy by Jommi et al. (2022), the COMP pointed out 
that this analysis is based on data from 2020 and is not representative of the current situation in Italy, 
where 30 CAR-T cell treatment centers exist. Moreover, new treatment options have obtained 
marketing authorisation recently, such as the CAR-T cell therapy Breyanzi. 
(4.3) The sponsor further summarized available data to support the argument of patient harm 
resulting from (timely) CAR-T cell therapy availability limitations. The sponsor mentions that in the 
pivotal licensing studies for Yescarta, Kymriah and Breyanzi between 9% to 30% of enrolled patients 
could not receive the final CAR-T cell product mainly due to disease progression and death of patients 
or because of manufacturing failure.  
The COMP pointed out that for Yescarta and Breyanzi the efficacy results from the MAIC analysis 
versus Zynlonta, in the ITT (FAS for Yescarta) populations (including all leukapheresed patients, 
independent of receiving the final CAR-T cell product or not), still statistically favoured the CAR-T cell 
products over Zynlonta. This was already discussed during the initial review procedure, leading to the 
negative outcome and is reflected above in this report. 
Similar analyses of r/r DLBCL patients intended to receive CAR-T cell therapy and who underwent the 
initial step of leukapheresis but could not receive the final product due to disease progression are 
presented by the sponsor (Kwon et al. 2022; Bachy et al. 2022; Chiappella et al. 2021). In more 
detail, an analysis by Mian et al (2019) is described. The authors compared in an ITT analysis OS of r/r 
DLBCL patients who received Yescarta and patients for whom Yescarta therapy was intended but not 
administered (Figure 2). A total of 27 patients (71%) received Yescarta and 11 patients (29%) were 
considered candidates but could not receive Yescarta (7 patients died prior to leukapheresis, 3 patients 
died after leukapheresis but prior to CAR-T cell infusion). The results from this analysis showed that 
patients who could not receive Yescarta had a higher comorbidity index at the time of decision to 
proceed with CAR-T cell therapy; the majority of them died before leukapheresis from disease

EMA/OD/0000094879 
Page 29/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
progression or complications of prior treatment. Outcomes were analysed and showed that the median 
OS in the non-infused patients was much shorter than in the Yescarta-infused groups (1 month 
[95% CI: 0.4 to 3.7] and 13 months [95% CI: 7.7 to N.R]), (Figure 2). 
While the COMP acknowledged these data, it emphasized that the impact of Zynlonta on the efficacy 
outcome of these patients who could not receive/benefit from the authorised CAR-T cell products (e.g. 
due to rapid disease progression) is not clear and no conclusive efficacy data in this specific population 
is available. In the analysis described by Mian et al (2019), the authors state that patients who could 
not receive Yescarta had a higher comorbidity index at the time of decision to proceed with CAR-T cell 
therapy. Furthermore, the median number of prior therapies was 4 in these patients, as compared to 3 
in those patients who did receive CAR-T cell therapy. 
The COMP also noted that, in the article by Mian et al (2019), the authors call for improved strategies 
to bridge patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma intended to receive Yescarta until they can be 
administered the final CAR-T cell product. The sponsor themselves did not suggest Zynlonta as a 
bridging therapy and the CHMP noted in their assessment report that this requires further exploration.

(4.4) The last line of argumentation in the context of Ground 1 relates to evidence on how Zynlonta 
can address the supposed limitations on availability of CAR-T therapy for r/r DLBCL patients. In this 
regard the sponsor mentions 1) the expected “easy access” to Zynlonta for all patients with r/r DLBCL 
since the administration does not require qualified treatment centres and 2) “immediate availability” 
associated with a rapid time to response (median time to first response of 41 days).  
The COMP noted that this line of argumentation is premised on the claim that CAR-T cell therapies 
have "serious limitations on availability”. As explained above, the COMP does not accept that CAR-T 
cell therapies are unavailable in the EU, let alone to such extent that their unavailability results in 
patient harm. The fact that CAR-T cell treatments are administered at qualified treatment centers does 
not entail that they are unavailable. Similarly, the fact that a new medicinal product may be more 
readily available does not mean that the previously authorised products are not available. 
Furthermore, the COMP emphasized again that the fact that CAR-T cell treatment may not be followed 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000094879 
Page 30/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
at individual patient level (e.g. on the basis of the treatment strategy discussed between the treating 
physicians and the patient) does also not entail that these products are unavailable. At present, there 
is no consensus among learned societies and physicians regarding exclusion criteria for CAR-T cell 
therapy, further to the authorised therapeutic indication (SmPC). Therefore, the final treatment choice 
remains at the discretion of the individual treating physician. 
Without prejudice to the above, the COMP took note of the sponsor's claims as to the availability of 
Zynlonta, but also pointed out that at present no information on the expected availability/access of/to 
Zynlonta throughout the EU is available. The sponsor has not submitted any information to the COMP 
showing that Zynlonta will be readily available in the EU (let alone in all Member States). 
Ground 2: Zynlonta provides a clinically relevant advantage for specific subsets of r/r DLBCL patients 
The sponsor proposes that compared to CAR-T cell treatment, their product provides a significant 
benefit for at least three specific subsets of r/r DLBCL patients, namely those who: (5.1) were 
unsuccessfully treated with CAR-T cell therapy; (5.2) cannot be treated in time with CAR-T cell therapy 
because of rapid disease progression and the time needed to prepare a CAR-T cell product; (5.3) are 
deemed ineligible for CAR-T cell therapy.  
(5.1) R/R DLBCL patients unsuccessfully treated with CAR-T cell therapy: the arguments and data 
presented by the sponsor on this point were already discussed during the initial review of the orphan 
designation criteria. No new arguments/data are presented by the sponsor.  The COMP previously 
concluded that “The data on individual patients failing prior treatment with CAR-T cell therapy before 
study entry were considered inconclusive in view of the overall low number of patients in this subset, 
limited information on the type of treatment received and with limited follow-up, so that the clinical 
relevance of responses could not be reliably determined”, please see above.  
(5.2) Patients who, because of rapid disease progression, cannot receive CAR-T cell treatment in time: 
the sponsor has referred to this aspect also under the first ground for appeal (4.2.2). In particular, the 
sponsor considers that Zynlonta will address an unmet medical need in patients with rapid disease 
progression as it is an “off-the-shelf” medicinal product for immediate administration. The COMP 
acknowledged these arguments but noted that 1) there are no specific criteria at present which would 
allow to pre-define a specific patient population not benefiting from CAR-T cell therapy but benefitting 
from Zynlonta instead and 2) that choice of treatment is at the individual discretion of the treating 
physician and 3) the efficacy of Zynlonta in patients with rapid disease progression and who cannot 
receive CAR-T cell therapy in time has not been demonstrated. These patients may have a more 
aggressive disease course and/or possible other adverse prognostic characteristics, as described for 
example by the OS analysis conducted by Mian et al. (2019) and which is described above under (4.3), 
Figure 2. In this retrospective ITT analysis, approximately one third of patients with r/r aggressive B-
cell lymphoma for whom CAR-T cell therapy was intended were unable to receive it and had extremely 
short median OS. Patients who could not receive Yescarta had a higher comorbidity index at the time 
of decision to proceed with CAR-T cell therapy. It would therefore be important to have efficacy data 
with Zynlonta in this specific patient cohort in order to support the claim of a clinically relevant 
advantage for this specific subset of r/r DLBCL patients. However, no such data has been presented by 
the sponsor. With regard to the possibility of using Zynlonta as a bridging therapy to help control 
disease in patients who are rapidly progressing (while awaiting CAR-T cell therapy), the CHMP 
concluded in their report that “Although Zynlonta may facilitate bridging to CAR-T treatment, the 
efficacy of this treatment after Zynlonta needs further exploration” (please see for more details above, 
under (4.3)). A claim for clinically relevant advantage of Zynlonta as bridging therapeutic in patients 
with rapid disease progression can therefore also not be supported by the COMP, due to lack of 
conclusive data. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

The sponsor makes reference to the Zynlonta CHMP Assessment Report (AR) on several occasions in 
their orphan maintenance appeal report. These passages are derived from the part of the CHMP AR 
that discusses the granting of a conditional marketing authorisation, in the absence of comprehensive 
data on the product: 
1) Zynlonta “… with its new mechanism of action (in the treatment of DLBCL) as well as its immediate 
availability, is considered to fulfil this unmet medical need". 
2) "CAR-T therapies are only available at specialized centres and up to 30% of eligible patients may 
not be able to receive the planned therapy, either due to manufacturing problems or rapid disease 
progression". 
With regard to points 1) and 2), the COMP pointed out that “[…] applicants should bear in mind that 
provisions on conditional marketing authorisations differ in their nature from provisions on data to 
support orphan medicinal products. Orphan medicinal products benefit from market exclusivity, the 
protection of which requires a strict interpretation. Recommending a conditional marketing 
authorisation by the CHMP does not imply a confirmation of significant benefit (to be assessed by the 
COMP)”. In that respect, reference is made to the “Guideline on the scientific application and the 
practical arrangements necessary to implement Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 on the 
conditional marketing authorisation for medicinal products for human use falling within the scope of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004” (EMA/CHMP/509951/2006, Rev.1). 
The COMP has explained above the reasons for which possible manufacturing problems or rapid 
disease progress do not establish the existence of serious availability limitations and of patient harm 
(as claimed by the sponsor). Without prejudice to the above, the CHMP Assessment Report (on the 
distinct matter of the requirement of fulfilling an unmet medical need, which must be met specifically 
for the granting of a conditional marketing authorisation; namely, an authorisation based on less 
comprehensive clinical data) does not take a position on any supposed patient harm (within the 
meaning of the 2016 Commission Notice) as a result of the availability/unavailability of CAR-T cell 
therapies in the EU. 
In addition, with regard to point 1), the COMP pointed out that according to the 2016 Commission 
Notice (2016/C 424/03), “‘Significant benefit’ should not be based on […] an alternative mechanism of 
action per se. However, in exceptional cases consideration may be given to those developments at the 
time the designation is granted. At the time the criteria are reviewed for the purposes of granting the 
marketing authorisation, this must translate into a clinically relevant advantage or a major contribution 
to patient care”. In other words, the simple availability of a medicinal product with a new mechanism 
of action does not result in a finding of significant benefit, unless accompanied by (conclusive) data 
demonstrating the existence of a clinically relevant advantage or a major contribution to patient care. 
The COMP emphasized again that conclusive evidence is expected in support of claims made in relation 
to significant benefit. The COMP considers that based on the data presented (both in isolation and in 
their totality), a positive conclusion cannot be made on a clinically relevant advantage of Zynlonta vis-
à-vis the authorised satisfactory methods (Yescarta, Kymriah, and Breyanzi).* MAIC between the 
patient populations from the pivotal clinical trials showed a statistically significant inferior efficacy of 
Zynlonta in comparison to Yescarta and Breyanzi. Even when including all leukapheresed patients in 
these indirect efficacy analysis (also those not receiving the final CAR-T cell products due to disease 
progression, death or manufacturing failure), i.e. the so called “intention-to-treat” (ITT) population (or 
full analysis set for Yescarta), the efficacy results still statistically favoured Yescarta and Breyanzi over 
Zynlonta.

* For completeness, the sponsor abandoned at the stage of the appeal the claim of major contribution 
to patient care (which had been separately refused by the COMP in the context of the initial Opinion; 
see above). 
(5.3) Patients deemed ineligible for CAR-T cell treatment based on the benefit-risk- assessment: the 
sponsor notes that it is critical to identify patients who are likely to benefit from CAR-T cell therapy, 
taking into account the possible toxicities (Kittai et al. 2020; Di Rocco et al. 2020) in order to 
determine the patients that would derive maximum benefit from CAR-T cell therapy and the patients 
for whom the possible toxicities would outweigh the potential benefits. In the absence of appropriate 
published guidelines and of a clear consensus among physicians regarding appropriate selection criteria 
for CAR-T cell products, each country/institution has its own definition of eligibility for CAR-T cell 
products mainly based on patient’s age, performance status and concomitant comorbidities. Section 
4.4 of the SmPCs of the CAR-T cell therapies provide general guidance for patient selection that may 
be considered eligible for this treatment, although these are not strict contra-indications. In brief, the 
approved SmPCs indicate that patients considered for CAR-T cell therapy should have r/r disease that 
is not rapidly progressing to allow time for leukapheresis, manufacturing, and infusion of the CAR-T 
cells. Patients should not have an active, uncontrolled infection, or a diagnosis of primary CNS 
lymphoma. Finally, it is recommended that patients have adequate renal, hepatic, pulmonary, and 
cardiac function (although the exact parameters vary slightly between products). Furthermore, 
observational studies indicated that severe Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) was significantly 
associated with a poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS 2-4) and high age 
(>65y). 
While the COMP acknowledged the sponsor’s arguments, it emphasized that the study population of 
the pivotal licensing study of Zynlonta is not considered to constitute a patient population who would 
be ineligible for CAR-T cell therapy per se. There are no strict contra-indications for the use of CAR-T 
cell products in the respective SmPCs; but based on clinical judgement and guidance in the SmPC, 
very frail patients, patients with rapid progressive disease, primary CNS lymphoma, active graft versus 
host disease, uncontrolled infection and patients not recovered from serious adverse reactions from 
preceding chemotherapies may not be considered eligible or should be treated with care. However, the 
COMP did not consider that the overall study populations from the main clinical trials with Zynlonta 
represent a frail patient population per se, who may not be considered a candidate for CAR-T cell 
treatment as described in the SmPC of those products. E.g. by protocol, patients with significant 
cardiovacular or comorbidities, poorly controlled diabetes, severe chronic pulmonary disease, were 
excluded from the Zynlonta studies. Also patients with lymphoma with active CNS involvement and 
graft vs host disease were excluded. Neither were patients not recovered from acute adverse events of 
previous therapy eligible (with the exception of alopecia and mild lower neuropathy).  Also, in the 
SmPC of Zynlonta, warnings are included not to treat patients with severe infections (grade 3-4), given 
that neutropenia is a common adverse event of this product. 
In the main study of Zynlonta (Study 201, an uncontrolled study in 145 DLBCL patients, the selected 
patients had in general a good or reasonable performance state (93.8% ECOG 0-1). The main reason 
for exclusion during screening (thus before the start of the study) was lack of adequate organ function 
(16/37) followed by ECOG score above 2 (5/37), and bulky disease ≥10 cm (3/37). This further 
illustrates that the Zynlonta studied population is a patient population that is not considered to be 
ineligible for CAR-T cell therapy per se. 
(5.3.1) Pivotal Study ADCT-402-201 (LOTIS-2) Subgroup Analysis of r/r DLBCL Patients in whom the 
risks of CAR-T cell toxicities would outweigh the potential treatment benefit: the sponsor performed a 
post-hoc analyses in a subgroup of patients from the pivotal phase 2 study LOTIS-2 that met one of

the following criteria: ≥75 years of age OR with ECOG PS=2. Furthermore, none of these patients 
received prior or subsequent CAR-T cell therapy. The sponsor considers that because of the reasons of 
advanced age and/or poor performance status, the risks of CAR-T cell toxicities would outweigh the 
potential treatment benefits in these patients. A total of 24 patients were included. There were 
19 patients (79.2% of the subgroup) ≥75 years of age, with 2 patients ≥85 years of age. A total of 
9 patients (37.5%) had an ECOG score of 2. All 24 patients had received prior systemic anticancer 
therapy with a median number of prior lines of 3 (ranging from 2 to 5). The sponsor reports that 
Zynlonta showed a “substantial and remarkable” response in this subgroup of patients with an ORR of 
50.0% and CRR of 33.3%. The efficacy was sustained with a median DOR not reached after 
28 months. The median PFS was 5.09 months, and the median OS was 7.36 months (Figure 3).  
Figure 3.  Swimmer Plot in the Post-hoc Subgroup (All-Treated Population)a (as per Annex 1 of 
sponsor’s documents) 
While the results from this sub-analysis are acknowledged by the COMP, it is noted that the general 
study population where this selected subgroup stems from, is not representative of a frail population 
with rapidly progressive disease, given the inclusion and exclusion criteria (please refer to the above 
point (5.3)). 
The COMP also noted that this sub-group was small and not pre-specified in the study protocol which 
hampers drawing final conclusions on the efficacy of Zynlonta in this patient group. 
To be noted, the studies with the CAR-T cell product Breyanzi also included a number of very elderly 
patients ≥ 75 years (27) and nine patients with ECOG PS 2, with r/r DLBCL. No pooled analysis of 
these subsets is available, but the ORR in the very elderly was 20/27 (74%), median DOR was not 
reached). Out of the 9 patients with ECOG PS 2, five achieved a CR (DOR range 0.7-5.3 months, OS 
127-653 days, corresponding with approximately 4-27 months) (source EPAR Breyanzi). Like in the 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

pivotal study with Zynlonta, the numbers of these specific patients were limited, and it is difficult to 
draw final conclusions on efficacy for either product. However, the response does not appear less 
favourable for Breyanzi, as compared to Zynlonta. 
In conclusion (relating to Ground 2), the COMP considers that there is a lack of conclusive evidence to 
support the efficacy of Zynlonta in specific patient subsets which, according to the sponsor, are 1) 
unlikely/cannot benefit from the authorised CAR-T cell products Yescarta, Kymriah and Breyanzi or 2) 
have progressed following previous treatment with authorised CAR-T cell products. 
In conclusion (relating to Ground 1 and 2), the COMP does not consider the arguments and data 
presented by the sponsor as conclusive evidence in support of the sponsor’s appeal grounds, to 
establish a significant benefit of Zynlonta vis-a vis the authorised CAR-T cell products Yescarta, 
Kymriah and Breyanzi. 
In relation to the first ground of appeal, the COMP considers that the presented data is not sufficient to 
establish the lack of availability of the authorised CAR-T cell products Yescarta, Kymriah and Breyanzi 
in r/r DLBCL patients, or the existence of patient harm for these patients as a result of this claimed 
lack of availability. 
In relation to the first and second grounds of appeal, the COMP considers that the presented data is 
not sufficiently robust to conclude that Zynlonta provides a clinically relevant advantage for specific 
subsets of r/r DLBCL patients vis-à-vis the authorised CAR-T cell products Yescarta, Kymriah and 
Breyanzi.

7. COMP final position on review of criteria for orphan 
designation adopted on 10 November 2022 
Based on the assessment of the detailed grounds for appeal and the argumentations presented by the 
sponsor during the oral explanation, the COMP concluded that: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 4.3 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to constitutional symptoms, local symptoms of 
lymphadenopathy, end-organ damage from disease involvement, and bone marrow failure that 
may lead to infections, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia, and life-threatening in patients not 
responding to treatment; 
in the context of the first opinion, the COMP concluded that the data submitted by the sponsor did 
not allow a positive conclusion on the claim for significant benefit of loncastuximab tesirine over 
the satisfactory methods of treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL and 
HGBL in the third- and later lines setting. The COMP considered that the sponsor’s claim that 
Zynlonta is of significant benefit to those affected by the orphan condition does not hold since the 
sponsor could not establish the existence of a clinically relevant advantage over Yescarta, Kymriah 
and Breyanzi which are authorised satisfactory methods of treatment. 
−  A different safety profile of Zynlonta compared to the approved CAR-T cell products cannot be 
concluded as being better based on the limited experience with Zynlonta and in the setting of 
an indirect comparison where confounding by indication and selection bias cannot be excluded. 
− 
In addition, matching-adjusted indirect comparisons between the patient populations from the 
pivotal trials for Zynlonta and the approved CAR-T cell products, which were considered as 
satisfactory methods of treatment for the target patient population, showed a statistically 
significant inferior efficacy of Zynlonta in comparison to Yescarta and Breyanzi. 
−  The data on individual patients failing prior treatment with CAR-T cell therapy before study 
entry were considered inconclusive in view of the overall low number of patients in this subset, 
limited information on the type of treatment received and with limited follow-up, so that the 
clinical relevance of responses could not be reliably determined. 
− 
Furthermore, the claim for major contribution to patient care cannot be accepted when the 
efficacy is not established as being comparative. 
• 
In the context of the appeal, the sponsor presented evidence and arguments to the COMP to 
substantiate the claim of a clinically relevant advantage of Zynlonta in comparison to authorised 
CAR-T cell products. The appeal comprises two grounds. Under the first ground of appeal, the 
sponsor claims that there are limitations on the availability of the authorised CAR-T cell products 
resulting in patient harm; and those alleged serious limitations will be overcome through the better 
availability of Zynlonta. Under the second ground of appeal, the sponsor claims that Zynlonta, 
when compared to CAR-T cell treatment, provides a clinically relevant advantage in specific subsets 
of relapsed or refractory DLBCL patients;

In relation to the first ground of appeal, the COMP considers that the presented data is not 
sufficient to establish the lack of availability of the authorised CAR-T cell products Yescarta, 
Kymriah and Breyanzi in relapsed or refractory DLBCL patients, or the existence of patient 
harm for these patients as a result of this claimed lack of availability. 
In relation to the first and second ground of appeal, the COMP considers that the presented 
data is not sufficiently robust to conclude that Zynlonta provides a clinically relevant advantage 
for specific subsets of relapsed or refractory DLBCL patients vis-à-vis the authorised CAR-T cell 
products Yescarta, Kymriah and Breyanzi. 
• 
therefore, the sponsor has not established that Zynlonta is of significant benefit to those affected 
by the condition. 
The COMP, having considered the detailed grounds for appeal submitted by the sponsor and all the 
supporting data on the basis of Article 5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are not satisfied. 
The COMP recommends that Zynlonta, loncastuximab tesirine for treatment of diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (EU/3/21/2481) is removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Mvabea, as part of the Zabdeno, Mvabea vaccine regimen, is indicated for active immunisation for 
prevention of disease caused by Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus species) in individuals ≥1 year of age
(see sections 4.4 and 5.1).
The use of the vaccine regimen should be in accordance with official recommendations.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Mvabea should be administered by a trained healthcare worker.
Mvabea is the second vaccination in the prophylactic 2-dose heterologous Ebola vaccine regimen 
which consists of vaccination with Zabdeno followed by a second vaccination with Mvabea given 
approximately 8 weeks later (see sections 4.4 and 5.1) (refer to the SmPC for Zabdeno).
2
Posology
Primary vaccination
A dose (0.5 mL) of Zabdeno (red cap vial) vaccine should be administered as the first vaccination
(refer to the SmPC for Zabdeno).
A dose (0.5 mL) of Mvabea (yellow cap vial) vaccine should be administered as the second 
vaccination approximately 8 weeks after the first vaccination with Zabdeno.
Booster vaccination with Zabdeno (individuals who previously received the Zabdeno, Mvabea 
2-dose primary vaccination regimen)
Individuals who have previously completed the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen can receive a 
booster dose of Zabdeno. As a precautionary measure, a Zabdeno booster vaccination is recommended 
in individuals who are at imminent risk of exposure to Ebola virus and have completed the 2-dose 
primary vaccination regimen more than 4 months ago (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).
Corrective measures in case of inadvertent administration
If Mvabea is inadvertently administered as the first vaccination, administration of Zabdeno is 
recommended as the second vaccination approximately 8 weeks later.
If Zabdeno is inadvertently administered as the first and the second vaccination, additional 
immunisation with Mvabea is recommended approximately 8 weeks after the second vaccination with
Zabdeno.
If Mvabea is inadvertently administered as the first and the second vaccination, additional 
immunisation with Zabdeno is recommended approximately 8 weeks after the second vaccination with 
Mvabea.
If the second vaccination (Mvabea) of the regimen has been delayed beyond the recommended 
8 weeks after the first vaccination (Zabdeno) of the regimen, the Mvabea vaccine should be 
administered regardless of the elapsed time from the first vaccination with Zabdeno (see section 5.1).
Paediatric population
Children aged 1 to 17 years
The posology in children aged 1 to 17 years is the same as in adults (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).
Infants aged less than 1 year
The efficacy of the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen has not been established in infants aged 
<1 year. Clinical data are described in sections 4.8 and 5.1, but no recommendation on a posology can 
be made.
3
Elderly population
No dosage adjustment is required in elderly individuals ≥65 years of age.
HIV-infected individuals
No dosage adjustment is required in HIV-infected individuals with infection controlled through 
antiretroviral therapy (see section 5.1).
Method of administration
Mvabea should be administered by the intramuscular (IM) route. The preferred site is the deltoid 
muscle of the upper arm. In younger children, either the deltoid region of the arm or anterolateral 
aspect of the thigh are acceptable sites for intramuscular injection.
Do not administer this vaccine intravenously or subcutaneously.
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.
For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4.
For precautions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of its excipients listed in section 6.1, or trace 
residues (chicken or egg protein and gentamicin).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hypersensitivity
Close observation is recommended following vaccination for the early signs of anaphylaxis or 
anaphylactoid reactions. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and 
supervision should always be readily available in case of rare anaphylactic reactions following the 
administration of the vaccine. Individuals should be observed by a healthcare professional for at least 
15 minutes after vaccination.
Anxiety-related reactions
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. 
It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders
The vaccine should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation 
disorder because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these 
individuals.
4
Concurrent illness
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection, unless the benefit of immediate vaccination outweighs the potential risks. The presence of a 
minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.
Immunocompromised individuals
Safety and immunogenicity of the Zabdeno, Mvabea vaccine regimen has not been assessed in 
immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressive therapy. 
Immunocompromised individuals may not respond as well as immunocompetent individuals to the 
Zabdeno, Mvabea vaccine regimen.
Level of protection
The exact level of protection afforded by the vaccine regimen is unknown.
In the absence of field efficacy data, the protective effect of the vaccine regimen in humans was 
inferred by the bridging of immunogenicity in humans to immunogenicity and efficacy data obtained 
in non-human primates (immunobridging) (see section 5.1).
If only one of the vaccines, Zabdeno or Mvabea, is received, the efficacy is expected to be reduced as 
compared to the 2-dose vaccine regimen.
The vaccine regimen might not protect all individuals against Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus species) 
disease, and does not replace precautions to avoid exposure to Ebola virus. Vaccinated individuals 
should adhere to local guidelines and recommendations to prevent or treat exposure to Ebola virus.
The Zabdeno, Mvabea vaccine regimen should not be initiated for post-exposure prophylaxis against 
Ebola virus.
Duration of protection
The duration of protection is unknown. A booster dose of Zabdeno administered at various intervals 
after completion of a primary series with Zabdeno and Mvabea has been shown to elicit an anamnestic 
response (see section 5.1). As a precautionary measure, a Zabdeno booster vaccination should be 
considered for individuals at imminent risk of exposure to Ebola virus, for example healthcare 
professionals and those living in or visiting areas with an ongoing Ebola virus disease outbreak, who 
completed the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen more than 4 months ago (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).
Protection against Filovirus disease
The vaccine regimen is not intended to prevent diseases caused by Filoviruses other than Zaire 
ebolavirus species.
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, and is considered to be 
essentially sodium-free.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
The safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of co-administration of Mvabea with other vaccines have not 
been evaluated, and therefore, co-administration is not recommended.
5
If Mvabea must be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine(s), then the vaccine(s) should 
always be administered at different injection sites. Do not mix Mvabea with any other vaccine in the 
same syringe or vial.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no data from the use of Mvabea in pregnant women.
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity.
Zabdeno and Mvabea vaccine regimens elicited detectable Ebola virus (EBOV) GP-specific maternal 
antibody titres that were transferred to the foetuses (see section 5.3).
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid vaccination with Mvabea during pregnancy.
Nevertheless, considering the severity of Ebola virus disease, vaccination should not be withheld when 
there is a clear risk of exposure to Ebola infection.
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether Mvabea is excreted in human milk.
A risk to the newborns/infants from breast-feeding by vaccinated mothers cannot be excluded.
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid vaccination with Mvabea during breast-feeding.
Nevertheless, considering the severity of Ebola virus disease, vaccination should not be withheld when 
there is a clear risk of exposure to Ebola infection.
Fertility
No data are available on fertility in humans. A reproductive toxicity study in animals with Zabdeno
and Mvabea vaccine regimens did not reveal any evidence of impaired female fertility. General 
toxicity studies have not revealed any effects on male sex organs that would impair male fertility (see 
section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Mvabea has no known effect on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most common local adverse reactions reported in adults who received Mvabea were pain (45%), 
warmth (20%) and swelling (10%) at the injection site. The most common systemic adverse reactions 
were fatigue (30%), myalgia (26%) and arthralgia (16%). Most adverse reactions occurred within 
7 days following vaccination and were mild to moderate in severity and of short duration (2-3 days).
The most common local adverse reaction reported in children 1 to 17 years of age who received 
Mvabea was pain (21%) at the injection site. The most common systemic adverse reaction was fatigue 
(11%). Most adverse reactions occurred within 7 days following vaccination. Most adverse reactions 
were mild to moderate in severity and of short duration (1-3 days).
Pyrexia was reported more frequently for younger children 1 to 3 years of age (8%) and 4 to 11 years 
of age (4%) compared to adolescents 12 to 17 years of age (2%) and adults (4%). The frequency of 
pyrexia in younger children was less than that observed in the placebo control group.
6
The safety profile of Mvabea in children 1 to 17 years of age was generally similar to that observed in 
adults.
The safety profile of Mvabea in infants 4 to 11 months of age was generally similar to that observed in 
children 1 to 17 years of age. The randomised, active-controlled phase of clinical trial EBL2005 
enrolled 75 participants in the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccine, other viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX02
Mechanism of action
Mvabea is a recombinant, non-replicating in human cells, Modified Vaccinia Ankara - Bavarian 
Nordic (MVA-BN) vectored multivalent Filovirus vaccine that encodes the Zaire ebolavirus Mayinga 
variant GP, Sudan ebolavirus Gulu variant GP, Taï Forest ebolavirus nucleoprotein, Marburg 
marburgvirus Musoke variant GP. The EBOV GP encoded by Zabdeno has 100% homology to the 
one encoded by Mvabea. Following administration, the EBOV GP is expressed locally and stimulates 
an immune response.
Efficacy
In the absence of efficacy data from clinical studies, the efficacy of the 2-dose primary vaccination
regimen has been assessed through challenge studies in non-human primates (NHP, Cynomolgus 
macaques, Macaca fascicularis), the most relevant animal model for EBOV disease. The 2-dose 
primary vaccination regimen administered at an interval of 8 weeks was protective down to a first dose 
of 2 x 109 virus particle (VP) of Zabdeno, in combination with 1 x 108 Inf.U of Mvabea, in a lethal 
intramuscular EBOV Kikwit NHP challenge model. Humoral immune responses, as measured by the 
level of EBOV GP-binding antibodies, were strongly correlated to survival in NHP. Protective effect 
in humans has been inferred through comparison of EBOV GP-binding antibody concentrations
(immunobridging).
Clinical immunogenicity
In the absence of efficacy data from clinical studies, the protective effect of the vaccine has been 
inferred from immunogenicity data. Data from 5 clinical studies conducted in Europe, the United 
States, and Africa in 764 adults 18 to 50 years of age who had received the 2-dose primary vaccination
regimen at the 8-week interval were used in this analysis. Anti-EBOV GP binding antibodies were 
correlated with a protective effect against a rapidly progressing fully lethal Ebola virus infection in 
non-human primates. The human immune responses measured 21 days post-dose 2 were associated 
with an increase of the predicted survival probability from 0% (i.e., fully lethal) to 53.4% (98.68% CI: 
33.8%; 70.9%) using the animal model. Based on this analysis, the Zabdeno, Mvabea vaccine regimen 
can be anticipated to have a protective effect against EBOV disease in humans. Although the 
relationship between antibody titre and survival has been studied only in adult NHP, immunobridging 
performed on paediatric subjects, the elderly and HIV-infected subjects suggests that the potential 
protective effects for these populations are consistent with the one estimated in adults.
Immunogenicity
Immunogenicity data are presented for a total of 842 adults and 509 children (1 to 17 years of age)
who had received the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen in Phase II and III clinical studies: study 
8
EBL2001 in the UK and France, studies EBL3002 and EBL3003 in the United States, study EBL2002 
in Uganda, Kenya, Burkina Faso and Cote d’Ivoire, and study EBL3001 in Sierra Leone. The 
concentrations of EBOV GP-specific binding antibodies were measured approximately 3 weeks after 
completion of the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen. These are presented as geometric mean 
concentrations (GMC).
Immunogenicity data are also assessed in an externally sponsored clinical study (EBL2004) conducted 
in Guinea, Liberia, Mali, and Sierra Leone. Data are presented for a total of 338 children (1 to 17 years 
of age), who had received the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen and who had data available at 
28 days post-dose 2 (see Table 4).
Immunogenicity data are also assessed in a Phase II clinical study in Sierra Leone and Guinea 
(EBL2005) in 74 infants aged 4 to 11 months who had received the 2-dose primary vaccination 
regimen and who had data available at 21 days post-dose 2 (see Table 5).
Immunogenicity data in adults after the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen
The immune response to the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen given in an 8-week interval was 
assessed in 5 Phase II and III studies conducted in Europe, Africa and the USA (see Table 3). In all 
studies, 98% to 100% of study participants mounted a binding antibody response to EBOV GP, 
defined as more than 2.5-fold increase in binding antibody concentration over baseline value.

The interval between doses in these studies was 8 weeks +/- 3 days. While the immunogenicity of 
vaccine regimens with a longer interval between doses up to 69 weeks (483 days) was similar, vaccine 
regimens with an interval of 4 weeks were less immunogenic.
Following the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen with an 8-week interval, GMCs EU/mL (95% CI) 
of 5283 (4094; 6817) were observed in HIV-infected adults on antiretroviral therapy, with CD4+ cells 
>350 cells/microlitre and no signs of immunosuppression (N=59).
Immunogenicity data in children (1 to 17 years of age) after the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen
The immune response to the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen given in an 8-week interval was 
assessed in children (1 to 17 years of age) in three studies conducted in Africa (see Table 4). In the 
three studies, 98% to 100% of study participants mounted a binding antibody response to EBOV GP. 
Immune responses in children were higher than those observed in adults in the same studies.

Immunogenicity data in adults after Zabdeno booster vaccination
The immune response to a booster vaccination of Zabdeno administered 1 or 2 years after the primary 
vaccination regimen was evaluated in 2 clinical studies (see Table 6). Booster vaccination resulted in 
the rapid activation of an anamnestic response, with a 40- to 56-fold increase in antibody 
concentrations within 7 days. The magnitude of the response in terms of fold-increase and 
post-booster GMC was similar irrespective of the time since primary vaccination (1 or 2 years).

Immunogenicity data in children 1 to 11 years of age (at time of 2-dose primary vaccination) after 
Zabdeno booster vaccination
The immune response to a booster vaccination of Zabdeno administered more than 3 years after initial 
vaccination was evaluated in a clinical study (EBL2011) (see Table 7). Booster vaccination resulted in 
the rapid activation of an anamnestic response with fold increases from pre-booster antibody 
concentrations of 32-fold in children aged 1 to 3 years and 63-fold in children aged 4 to 11 years. At 
21 days post-booster, fold increases in antibody concentrations from pre-booster concentrations were 
76-fold in children aged 1 to 3 years and 137-fold in children aged 4 to 11 years.

Long term persistence of antibodies in adults
Three weeks after completion of the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen, the immune response 
(GMC) reaches its peak (“A” in figure 1 below). After the peak the response declines by 6 months and
remains stable at least 1 year post-dose 1 (Table 3). As illustrated by the data on 43 adults in study 
EBL3001, the response remains stable also at two years post-dose 1 (latest time point available) (“B” 
in figure 1 below). After administration of a booster dose of Zabdeno, a rapid anamnestic response is 
observed within 7 days. The highest binding antibody concentrations are observed 21 days 
post-booster dose (“C” in figure 1 below), followed by a decline in antibody concentrations. At 1 year 
post-booster dose, GMCs were higher than before administration of the booster dose (“D” in figure 1 
below).

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Mvabea for the prevention of Ebola virus disease in one or more subsets of the paediatric population 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
This vaccine has been authorised under ‘exceptional circumstances’. This means that for scientific 
reasons it has been impossible to get complete information on this vaccine. The European Medicines 
Agency will review any new information which may become available every year and this SmPC will 
be updated as necessary.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Not applicable.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on repeated dose toxicity and local 
tolerance studies, and a reproductive toxicity study in rabbits.
General (repeated dose) toxicity studies, including local tolerance
Vaccination of rabbits with various Zabdeno and Mvabea vaccine regimens was well tolerated when 
administered intramuscularly at full human dose levels. The vaccine-related findings (reflected by 
inflammatory changes at the injection site, increases in fibrinogen, C-reactive protein and globulin,
and microscopic findings of increased lymphoid cellularity and/or germinal centres in the draining 
lymph nodes and spleen) were noted to be recovering 2 weeks after the last vaccination, and reflect a 
normal, physiological response associated with vaccination. There were no effects noted that were 
considered to be adverse.
12
Fertility/Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity
Biodistribution studies conducted in the rabbit did not show distribution of the MVA-BN vector to the 
gonads (testes, ovaries) following IM injection.
The general (repeated dose) toxicity studies with Zabdeno and Mvabea vaccine regimens have not 
revealed any effects on male sex organs that would impair male fertility. In addition, the general 
and/or reproductive toxicity studies did not reveal any evidence of impaired female fertility. In a 
reproductive toxicity study, Zabdeno and Mvabea vaccine regimens did not induce maternal or 
developmental toxicity following maternal exposure during the premating and gestation period. In this 
study, the vaccine regimens elicited detectable EBOV GP-specific maternal antibody titres that were 
transferred to the foetuses.

Possible side effects
1. What Mvabea is and what it is used for
What is Mvabea
Mvabea is a vaccine used to protect against Ebola virus disease in the future.
It is given to people aged 1 year and older who may possibly come into contact with Ebola virus.
Mvabea is given as the second dose of a 2-dose course of vaccinations to protect you from getting 
Ebola virus disease caused by the Zaire ebolavirus, which is a type of Filovirus. This vaccine will not 
protect you against the other types of Filovirus. 
Because Mvabea does not contain the whole Ebola virus, it cannot give you Ebola virus disease.
The 2-dose course of vaccinations consists of:
a first dose of Zabdeno vaccine,

followed around 8 weeks later by a dose with Mvabea vaccine.

Even after you have had the course of Zabdeno and Mvabea vaccination you should be very careful
not to come into contact with Ebola virus. As with all vaccinations, the vaccination course may not 
fully protect everyone from Ebola virus disease.
The Zabdeno and Mvabea 2-dose course of vaccinations should be used according to official 
recommendations.
What is Ebola

Ebola is a serious disease caused by a virus. People catch Ebola from people or animals who are 
infected with Ebola virus or who died from Ebola.
You can catch Ebola from blood and body fluids like urine, stools, saliva, vomit, sweat, breast 
milk, semen and vaginal fluids of people who are infected with Ebola virus.
You can also catch Ebola from things that have touched the blood or body fluids of a person or 
animal with Ebola (like clothes or objects in direct contact).


25

Ebola is not spread through the air, water or food.
Ebola virus disease usually causes a high fever – and it can stop the blood from clotting, causing 
severe bleeding (‘severe haemorrhagic fever’). This can lead to serious illness, and in some cases 
death.


First signs and symptoms may be fever, feeling tired, weak or dizzy, and muscle aches.
Later signs and symptoms may include bleeding under the skin, into organs in the body such as 
the liver or kidneys and from the mouth, eyes or ears. Some people get severe diarrhea, sudden 
drop in blood pressure or blood flow to the organs in the body (shock) which may cause serious 
and permanent damage to these organs, severe confusion (delirium), fits (seizures), kidney 
failure and coma.
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first to decide if you should be given this vaccine.
How the vaccine works
The Zabdeno and Mvabea 2-dose vaccine course stimulates the body’s natural defences (immune 
system). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the 
virus that causes the Ebola infection. This will help to protect against Ebola virus disease in the future.
2. What you need to know before you or your child are given Mvabea
To make sure that the vaccination course is suitable for you or your child, it is important to tell your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse if any of the points below apply to you or your child. If there is anything 
you do not understand, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse to explain.
Do not have the vaccine if

you or your child have ever had a severe allergic reaction to any of the active substances or any 
of the other ingredients listed in section 6.
you or your child have ever had a severe allergic reaction to chicken or eggs or an antibiotic 
known as ‘gentamicin’.

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Mvabea if you or your child:





have ever had a severe allergic reaction after any other vaccine injection,
have ever fainted, after having an injection,
have a problem with bleeding or you bruise easily,
currently have a fever or an infection,
are taking medicines that weaken the immune system, such as high-dose corticosteroids (such as 
prednisone) or chemotherapy (cancer medicines),
have a weak immune system – for example, due to HIV infection or an illness that runs in the 
family (‘genetic disorder’).

If any of the above apply to you or your child (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse before you are given Mvabea.
If you are at high risk of being in contact with the Ebola virus, a booster vaccination with Zabdeno
may be recommended for you or your child. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if this applies to 
you or your child.
If you or your child only have one of the vaccines, Zabdeno or Mvabea, it may give less protection
from Ebola virus disease than having a course of both vaccines.
As with all vaccines, the Zabdeno and Mvabea 2-dose course of vaccination may not fully protect 
everyone from Ebola virus disease and it is not known how long you will be protected.
26

People who have been given the 2-dose course of vaccination should still take precautions 
to avoid coming into contact with Ebola virus.
Washing your hands correctly is the most effective way to prevent the spread of dangerous germs, like
Ebola virus. It reduces the number of germs on the hands and so reduces their spread from person to
person.
Proper hand washing methods are described below.

Use soap and water when hands are soiled with dirt, blood, or other body fluids. There is no 
need to use antimicrobial soaps for washing hands.
Use alcohol-based hand sanitiser when hands are not dirty. Do not use alcohol-based hand 
sanitiser when hands are soiled with dirt, blood, or other body fluids.
While in an area affected by Ebola, it is important to avoid the following:

Contact with blood and body fluids (such as urine, faeces, saliva, sweat, vomit, breast milk, 
semen, and vaginal fluids).
Items that may have come in contact with an infected person’s blood or body fluids (such as 
clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment).
Funeral or burial rituals that require handling the body of someone who died from Ebola.
Contact with bats, apes and monkeys or with blood, fluids and raw meat prepared from these 
animals (bushmeat) or meat from an unknown source.
Contact with semen from a man who had Ebola. You should follow safe sex practices until the 
virus is gone from the semen. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice about how 
long to maintain safe sex practices.





Children younger than 1 year of age
There is no recommendation for use of Mvabea in children younger than 1 year of age.
Other medicines and Mvabea
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take, any 
other medicines or vaccines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before having this vaccine if you or your child is pregnant or 
breast-feeding. Also do this if you think you or your child may be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby.
Driving and using machines
Mvabea has no known effect on the ability to drive and use machines.
Mvabea contains Sodium
Mvabea contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose of 0.5 mL, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
3.
How Mvabea is given
Your doctor or nurse will inject the vaccine into a muscle (intramuscular injection) in the upper arm or 
thigh.
Mvabea must not be injected into a blood vessel.
The 2-dose course of vaccination consists of:


Your doctor will tell you the date for the second vaccine.
a dose of Zabdeno vaccine,
followed around 8 weeks later by a dose of Mvabea vaccine.
27
How much vaccine will you or your child get
Primary vaccination


First vaccination with Zabdeno – red cap vial (0.5 mL).
Second vaccination with Mvabea – yellow cap vial (0.5 mL), given around 8 weeks after 
the first vaccination with Zabdeno.
Booster vaccination with Zabdeno (an extra dose of Zabdeno to increase or renew the 
effect of an earlier Zabdeno and Mvabea 2-dose course of vaccination)

The booster vaccination is recommended for you or your child if you are at high risk of 
being in contact with the Ebola virus and you completed the 2-dose course of vaccination 
more than 4 months ago.
Ask your doctor if you or your child should consider getting the booster vaccination.

During and after the injection of the vaccine, the doctor will watch over you or your child for around 
15 minutes or longer as necessary in case of a severe allergic reaction.
Instructions for preparing the vaccine – for medical and healthcare professionals – are included at 
the end of the leaflet.
If you have an unintended or accidental injection of Zabdeno or Mvabea

If you or your child are accidently given Mvabea as the first vaccination – you will get Zabdeno
as the second vaccination around 8 weeks later.
If you or your child are accidently given Zabdeno as the first and the second vaccination – you 
will get Mvabea around 8 weeks after the second vaccination with Zabdeno.
If you or your child are accidently given Mvabea as the first and the second vaccination – you 
will get Zabdeno around 8 weeks after the second vaccination with Mvabea.
If you or your child have not been given Mvabea around 8 weeks after vaccination with 
Zabdeno – talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse about getting the second vaccination with 
Mvabea.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision must always be 
readily available in the event of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of
Mvabea. Individuals should be observed by a healthcare professional for at least 15 minutes 
after vaccination.
Mvabea must not be mixed with other medicinal products in the same syringe.
Mvabea must not be administered by intravascular injection under any circumstances.
Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular (IM) injection preferably in the upper arm 
in the region of the deltoid or in the thigh.
Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic 
response to injection with a needle. Procedures should be in place to prevent injury from falling 
and to manage syncopal reactions.

Instructions for administration and handling
Mvabea is a light yellow, clear to milky suspension. The vaccine should be inspected visually for 
particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. The vial should be inspected visually for 
cracks or any abnormalities, such as evidence of tampering prior to administration. If there are signs of 
any of these, do not administer the vaccine.
Once the vaccine has been removed from the freezer and thawed, use immediately or store in a 
refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (see section 6.4). Once removed from the refrigerator for administration, it 
should be used immediately.
Gently mix the contents of the vial by swirling for 10 seconds. Do not shake. Use a sterile needle and 
sterile syringe to extract the entire contents from the vial for administration.
32
Use a separate sterile needle and syringe for each individual. It is not necessary to change needles 
between drawing up the vaccine from a vial and injecting it into a recipient, unless the needle has been 
damaged or contaminated. Any remaining content in the vial should be discarded.
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance to local 
requirements. Potential spills should be disinfected with agents with viricidal activity against vaccinia 
virus.
Information about storage
Do not use this vaccine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton after EXP. The expiry date 
refers to the last day of that month.
Transport frozen at -25°C to -15°C. Upon receipt, the product can be stored as indicated below:
Store in a freezer at -85°C to -55°C at the distributor in case of stockpiling. The expiry date for storage 
at -85°C to -55°C is printed on the vial and outer carton after EXP.
The vaccine can also be stored by the distributor or end user in a freezer at -25°C to -15°C for a single 
period of up to 7 months. Upon removal from the -85°C to -55°C freezer, the new expiry date must be 
written by the distributor or end user on the outer carton and the vaccine should be used or discarded 
at the end of the 7 months. This new expiry date should not exceed the original expiry date (EXP). The 
original expiry date should be made unreadable.
The vaccine can also be stored by the distributor or end user in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C for a single 
period of up to 1 month. Upon moving the product to 2°C to 8°C storage, the discard date must be 
written by the distributor or end user on the outer carton and the vaccine should be used or discarded 
at the end of the 1 month period. This discard date should not exceed the original expiry date (EXP), 
or the new expiry date assigned for the -25°C to -15°C storage condition. The original expiry date 
and/or the new expiry date assigned for the -25°C to -15°C storage condition should be made 
unreadable.
Once thawed, the vaccine cannot be refrozen.
The vial must be kept in the original package in order to protect from light and to track the expiry or 
discard date for the different storage conditions.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited submitted on 3 July 2015 an application for Marketing 
Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Zepatier, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 20 November 2014.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in adults (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.1). For hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype-specific activity (see section 5.1). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that elbasvir and grazoprevir were considered to be new active substances. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0024/2015 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0024/2015 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects up to 170 million people worldwide. In the United 
States (US) and Europe, it is estimated that there are as many as 5 million and 10 million persons with 
chronic HCV infection, respectively. 
Transmission of HCV is primarily by percutaneous exposure to infected blood through unsafe injections, 
inadequate sterilisation of medical equipment, transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products, 
and transplantation from an infectious donor. HCV is less efficiently transmitted through sex with an 
infected partner or birth to an infected mother. In developed countries, the peak contamination of the 
blood supply occurred between the 1960s and 1992, when screening was instituted. Since then, new 
infections have significantly declined and have been primarily associated with injection drug use and 
high transmission risk sexual behaviours. 
Incident HCV infections occur in up to 4 million people worldwide, annually. The majority of new 
infections occur in the setting of persons who inject drugs (PWID) and the risk of HCV infection is 
highest among the young as well as new injecting drug users. Globally, an estimated 10 million (range 
6 to 15) PWIDs have HCV infection. The regions with the largest HCV-infected PWID populations are 
Eastern Europe (2.3 million, range 1.2-3.9), East and Southeast Asia (2.6 million, range 1.8-3.6). 
Approximately (~) 0.7 million (range 0.5 to 1.0) and 1.7 million (range 1.1 to 2.5) PWIDs are infected 
with HCV in Western Europe and North America, respectively. Due to shared transmission routes of 
HCV and HIV, PWID are also likely to be co-infected with HIV. One-fourth to one-third of patients 
infected with HIV in the United States and Europe are co-infected with HCV and documented co-
infection rates rise to up to 70% in parts of Eastern Europe. 
There are 6 major HCV genotypes (GT) and also distinct sub-genotypes of each GT. GT1 is the most 
prevalent genotype, accounting for ~46% of all infections worldwide and 60-70% of infections in North 
America, Latin America, and Europe. GT1 is divided into two major subtypes, GT1a and GT1b. GT1b is 
the most common subtype worldwide and is predominant in Asia. GT1a predominates in the Americas. 
In the US, GT1a is more frequent (~46%) than GT1b (~26%). In Europe, the relative distributions of 
these subtypes vary by country. The global frequencies of GT2 to GT6 are the following: GT3 (22-
30%), GT2 (9-13%), G4 (8-13%), G6 (2-5%) and G5 (1%). GT2 accounts for 10 to 15%, 5%, 10%, 
and 27% of infections in the US, England, France, and Italy, respectively. GT3 predominates in South 
Asia, but it also has global presence in part due to waves of migration from South Asia. For example, 
GT3 accounts for 47% of HCV cases in England. GT4, GT5 and GT6 infections are found primarily in 
North Africa/Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia, respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 10/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Approximately 5-25% of people who acquire HCV recover spontaneously within 2-12 weeks, while 55-
85% will progress to chronic HCV infection. The most significant impact of chronic HCV infection is 
chronic liver inflammation that leads to cirrhosis, end stage liver disease (decompensation), 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related mortality. Without therapy, 16% and 41% of people 
with chronic HCV will develop liver cirrhosis within 20 and 30 years after infection, respectively. 
Approximately, 0.5 million deaths worldwide are attributable to liver cirrhosis and HCC due to HCV 
annually. 
Therapy for chronic HCV infection aims at a sustained virologic response (SVR). Recent all-oral, 
interferon (IFN)-free regimens include agents that directly and specifically inhibit viral structural 
proteins. Four DAA classes have been developed: NS3/4A Protease Inhibitors (PIs), NS5A Inhibitors 
(NS5AIs), Nucleoside-Mimetic NS5B Polymerase Inhibitors (NIs), and Non-Nucleoside NS5B 
Polymerase Inhibitors (NNIs). Recently approved regimens continue to have deficits, notably: 
1. Some require use of ribavirin (RBV) 
2. Some have suboptimal efficacy (SVR12 < 90%) or require prolonged therapy in subpopulations 
3. Regimens that include RBV or NIs are not optimal for use in patients with advanced CKD 
4. There are limited all-oral DAA regimens approved for some genotypes

corresponding to the molecular formula C 38H50N6O9S and has a relative molecular mass 766.90 g/mol 
and has the following structure: 
Figure 1.  Chemical structure of grazoprevir 
The chemical structure of grazoprevir has been adequately demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy, 
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H, 13C), mass spectrometry, ultraviolet absorption 
spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. 
Grazoprevir is a white to off-white powder; it is practically insoluble in water and is slightly 
hygroscopic.   
Grazoprevir exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of seven chiral centres. Enantiomeric purity 
is controlled routinely by specific optical rotation. 
Polymorphism has been observed for the active substance. Experiments conducted confirmed that this 
free acid monohydrate (III) polymorphic form is the most stable form. Grazoprevir is photosensitive in 
the solid state under ICH photostability stress conditions. The active substance was found to be 
sensitive to moisture. Particle size distribution and polymorphic form shall not affect the finished 
product performance Manufacture, characterisation and process controls. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Grazoprevir is synthesized in eight main steps using commercially available well defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications. Grazoprevir is prepared by a convergent synthesis with eight 
total crystallizations. 
 During the assessment, one of the proposed starting materials was not considered to be suitable as it 
carries two of the chiral centres of the final active substance and the steps involved in its synthesis are 
critical to ensuring its stereochemistry and the one of grazoprevir are correct.  Therefore, the CHMP 
requested the starting material to be redefined to an earlier step of the synthesis to ensure that the 
important synthetic steps necessary to ensure the quality of the grazoprevir are subject to regulatory 
oversight. The applicant redefined the starting material to an earlier step of the synthesis which was 
considered satisfactory. 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 12/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential  and  actual  impurities,  including  enantiomer  impurities,  degradants,  potential  genotoxic 
impurities,  inorganic  impurities  and  residual  solvents  were  well  discussed  with  regards  to  their  origin 
and characterised.  
The  commercial  manufacturing  process  for  the  active  substance  was  developed  in  parallel  with  the 
clinical  development  program.  Changes  introduced  have  been  presented  in  sufficient  detail  and  have 
been justified.  
The development of the grazoprevir manufacturing process has been adequately described. For each 
manufacturing step, combinations of univariate and multifactor DOE studies were conducted for the 
major unit operations to determine acceptable ranges for the process parameters and input material 
attributes. No design space was claimed. No critical process parameters were identified 
Grazoprevir  is  packaged  in  a  package  which  complies  with  the  EC  directive  2002/72/EC  and  EC 
10/2011 as amended as well as Ph. Eur. monograph 3.1.3 and 3.2.2., 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description, assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), 
residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), specific rotation (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), and 
identity (IR). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for impurities testing has been presented. 
The batch data presented to support the active substance specification includes 18 commercial scale 
batches using the commercial process, from the commercial site. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of grazoprevir from the proposed manufacturer stored 
in the intended commercial package for 12 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. 
Results under stress conditions (150ºC, 0.1N HCl 40ºC, 0.1N NaOH 40ºC, 3% H2O2, and 
azobisisobutyronitrile at 5mM in methanol) were also provided on one batch. 
The following parameters were tested: description, assay, impurities (HPLC), water content (Karl 
Fischer titration), specific rotation, identity (IR, X-ray powder diffraction) and regioisomer purity 
(HPLC) and were stability indicating. 
The photostability stability studies showed that grazoprevir is slightly sensitive to degradation by light. 
In relation to the other studies, no trends or significant changes were observed under any of the 
Assessment report

conditions tested (150ºC, 0.1N HCl  40ºC, 0.1N NaOH 40ºC, 3% H2O2,  and azobisisobutyronitrile at

The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the re-test period of 24 months with no specific storage

Elbasvir 
General information 
The chemical name of elbasvir is Dimethyl N,N′-([(6S)-6-phenylindolo[1,2-c][1,3]benzoxazine-3,10-
diyl]bis{1H-imidazole-5,2-diyl-(2S)-pyrrolidine-2,1-diyl[(2S)-3-methyl-1-oxobutane-1,2 
diyl]})dicarbamate corresponding to the molecular formula C 49H55N9O7 and has a relative molecular 
mass 882.02 g/mol and has the following structure: 
Figure 2.  Chemical structure of elbasvir 
The chemical structure of elbasvir has been adequately demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy, 
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H, 13C), mass spectrometry, ultraviolet absorption 
spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. 
The active substance is a white to off-white powder. It is practically insoluble in water and heptane and 
very  soluble  in  ethyl  acetate  and  acetone.  Elbasvir  exists  as  a  weakly  dibasic  amorphous  compound 
with  no  stable  crystalline  phase  identified  to  date.  Elbasvir  is  hygroscopic,  but  remains  amorphous 
after  absorption  and  desorption  of  moisture.  Extensive  polymorph  screening  has  not  identified  any 
non-solvated crystalline forms of elbasvir 
Elbasvir exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of five chiral centres. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by specific optical rotation.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Elbasvir is synthesized in six main steps using well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.

The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. The development of the commercial manufacturing process for elbasvir 
active substance followed a systematic risk based approach following the principles outlined in ICH Q9 
and ICH Q11.  
Operations perceived as higher risk and or at risk of significant parameter interactions for the elbasvir 
active substance Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) were studied in a systematic way by utilizing 
multifactor Design of Experiments (DOE) studies, first principles, prior knowledge or a combination of 
these elements. 
Operations presenting lower risk or not expected to have multifactor interactions were studied with a 
traditional One Factor at A Time (OFAT) approach.  
The development studies have led to the definition of the proven acceptable ranges for the elbasvir 
manufacturing process 
No design space has been claimed. The detailed evaluation undertaken has concluded that there are no 
Critical Process Parameters (CPP) in the elbasvir synthetic route. 
Elbasvir is packaged in a container that complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as 
amended and Ph. Eur. monographs 3.1.3 and 3.2.2. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description, assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), 
specific rotation (Ph Eur), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), palladium, identity (IR), heavy 
metals (Ph  Eur). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used has been presented. No impurity reference standards are used. 
Batch analysis data of 12 commercial scale of the active substance are provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored  in  the  intended  commercial  package  under  long  term  conditions  at  5  ºC  for  up  to  18  months, 
under accelerated conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH for up to 12 months, and at  40°C/75 %RH for up 6 
months,  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines,  were  provided.  Photostability  testing  following  the  ICH 
guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Results on stress conditions (150ºC, 0.1N HCl 25ºC, 0.1N 
NaOH 25ºC, 3% H2O2 25ºC, azobisisobutyronitrile  at 5mM in methanol 40ºC) were also provide on one 
batch. 
The  following  parameters  were  tested:  description,  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  water  content 
(KF), specific rotation, identity (IR) and X-ray powder diffraction. 
The stability study confirmed that there was neither a change in impurities nor any significant change 
in  the  description,  assay  and  water  content  during  this  period.  The  data  from  the  solid  state

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Zepatier is supplied as a fixed-dose combination, film-coated tablet. Each tablet contains 50 mg of 
elbasvir and 100 mg of grazoprevir as active substances. 
Zepatier was designed as a robust, physically and chemically stable immediate-release solid dosage 
form using the considerations provided in the Target Product Profile. The pharmaceutical development 
of grazoprevir/elbasvir tablet was aimed at developing a solid oral dosage form that meets the quality 
requirements of the quality target product profile 
During development, appropriate QTPP categories were further translated into product CQAs The goal 
of the finished product development was to identify a formulation and manufacturing control strategy 
that robustly met these potential CQAs. The formulation strategy entailed the development of single 
entity formulations containing either grazoprevir or elbasvir active substances. The knowledge from the 
single entity development efforts was subsequently used for the development of the combination. 
Excipients were selected to provide a physically and chemically stable formulation with the intended 
biopharmaceutical properties. The active substances and the excipients were found to be compatible 
by evaluating the physical and chemical stability of the finished product. All excipients are compendial 
grade, with the exception of the film-coat (Opadry II); however, the components of the film-coating 
agent are compendial. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The control strategy was developed to achieve a manufacturing process that consistently provides a 
final product meeting the CQAs, and includes process parameter controls per the established proven 
acceptable ranges and the in-process controls. Some elements of ICH Q8-Q11, such as the application 
of risk management, the use of QTPP to guide development, and the use of multifactor experiments 
and one-factor-at-a time studies (OFAT) were used during development. 
During the manufacturing development, the steps from the risk based process development plan were 
reviewed sequentially. The proven acceptable ranges and in-process controls developed at the 
commercial scale and defined for commercial production were described.  
The finished product is packaged in an aluminum/aluminum blister. This package was chosen because 
development work indicated finished product sensitivity to moisture and active substance sensitivity to 
light. The material complies with Ph Eur and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
During  the  evaluation  of  the  medicinal  product,  the  applicant  has  replaced  the  manufacturing  site 
which will manufacture and test grazoprevir and elbasvir spray dried intermediates (SDIs) with another 
manufacturing site as it was considered non-GMP compliant. The applicant has provided a detailed Risk 
Assessment together with appropriate updated documents to support the new manufacturing site. The 
risk assessment to support the validity of the data on the spray dried intermediates (SDIs) and related 
drug  products  with  regard  to  quality,  safety  and  efficacy  is  comprehensive  and  is  sufficient  to  allay 
concerns  regarding  the  validity  of  the  data  on  the  spray  dried  intermediates  (SDIs)  and  related  drug 
products  with  regard  to quality,  safety  and  efficacy.  However  the  CHMP  recommends  a  report  should 
be presented detailing the transfer of the manufacture of the SDIs and the analytical test methods to 
the  new  site  with  results  of  validation/optimisation  studies,  in  view  of  the  possible  need  for 
‘optimisation’ of the process following transfer, the bulk hold time for the SDIs (currently 12 m) will be 
revalidated on batches manufactured at the new site or a justification will be provided, the first three, 
consecutive commercial batches of tablets manufactured with the new manufacturing site SDIs will be 
placed  on  stability  trial.  Stability  protocols  will  be  in  line  with  current  guidelines  and  will  address,  in 
addition,  address potential  changes  in  water  activity  and  drug  substance  crystallinity  on  storage,  and 
provide release data from 3 batches (1 production batch and 2 pilot batches or 2 production batches) 
from  tablets  manufactured  with  the  new  manufacturing  site  spray  dried  intermediates  and  a 
comparison  to  tablets  manufactured  with  the  previous  manufacturing  site  spray  dried  intermediates, 
prior to launch. 
The manufacturing process consists of nine main steps: grazoprevir spray drying, grazoprevir blending 
and lubrication, grazoprevir roller compaction and milling, elbasvir spray drying, elbasvir blending and 
lubrication, elbasvir roller compaction and milling, final blending and lubrication of the grazoprevir and 
elbasvir  granulations,  tablet  compression  of  grazoprevir/elbasvir  granulations  into  monolithic  fixed-
dose  combination  (FDC)  tablets,  film  coating,  and  packaging.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a 
standard manufacturing process. 
The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from 
commercial scale batches fully support the proposed proven acceptable ranges (PARs). The process 
validation scheme of the manufacturing process used to manufacture the product has been provided. 
The process validation will be completed on commercial-scale batches prior to product being placed on 
the market and will be available for verification as part of routine site GMP inspections. Since the 
manufacturing process is a standard process, this is considered satisfactory.  
The defined testing attributes to be assessed, along with the expanded testing, test methods, sampling 
plan, and acceptance criteria are satisfactory. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form 
appearance,  assay  for  both  active  substances  (HPLC),  degradation  products  of  the  active  substances 
(HPLC),  identification  for  both  active  substances  (HPLC),  content  uniformity  (Ph  Eur),  dissolution 
(HPLC), microbial quality (Ph Eur).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for has been presented.

Batch analysis results are provided for three batches larger than the proposed commercial batch size 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three batches of the finished product stored for up 18 months under long term 
conditions at 30 °C/75% RH and for up  6 months under accelerated conditions at 40°C±2°C / 
75%RH±5% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches tested were manufactured 
at the commercial manufacturing site and were representative of the proposed commercial process, 
packaging and formulation. Samples were tested for assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), 
dissolution, water activity, active substance crystallinity (X-Ray power diffraction), and microbial purity 
(Ph Eur). The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life 24 months with no specific temperature 
storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. The product should be stored in 
the original package until use to protect from moisture. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The finished product has been developed using single entity spray dried formulations to enhance the 
properties of the active substances and to mitigate decreased absorption at high gastric pH due to the 
steep pH dependent solubility profile. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and the finished 
product and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the 
manufacturing process of the active substance, or for the finished product. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
•  A report should be presented detailing the transfer of the manufacture of the SDIs and the 
analytical test methods to the new manufacturing site with results of validation/optimisation 
studies.  
• 
• 
• 
In view of the possible need for ‘optimisation’ of the process following transfer, the bulk hold 
time for the SDIs (currently 12 m) will be revalidated on batches manufactured at the new 
manufacturing site or a justification will be provided. 
The first three, consecutive commercial batches of tablets manufactured with the new 
manufacturing site will be placed on stability trial. Stability protocols will be in line with current 
guidelines and will address, in addition, address potential changes in water activity and drug 
substance crystallinity on storage. 
To provide release data from 3 batches (1 production batch and 2 pilot batches or 2 production 
batches) from tablets manufactured with the new manufacturing site spray dried intermediates 
and a comparison to tablets manufactured with the previous manufacturing site spray dried 
intermediates, prior to launch. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Grazoprevir is a reversibly binding macrocyclic inhibitor of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) non-structural 
protein (NS) 3/4A and elbasvir is a small molecule inhibitor of HCV NS5A. These two new chemical 
entities are to be used in combination for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. 
In vitro pharmacodynamics studies showed the Grazoprevir inhibited the replication of HCV Ribonucleic 
acid (RNA) with sub-nanomolar EC50 values in genotypes (GT) 1, 4, and 6. It has nanomolar potency 
in GT3. Elbasvir inhibited HCV replication in GT1, GT4, and GT6 with low picomolar (EC50 ≤ 4 pM) 
activity. It is less potent in GT3 (EC50 = 20 pM). In combination, grazoprevir and elbasvir 
demonstrated additive effects in blocking HCV RNA replication and suppressed the emergence of 
resistance by creating a higher genetic barrier. 
Grazoprevir and elbasvir have been developed as a fixed-dose combination tablet to provide once daily 
dosing, pegylated-interferon free regimen of short duration for patients chronically infected with HCV. 
For most HCV GT1-, 4-, or 6-infected patients, a 12-week, ribavirin-free regimen of elbasvir / 
grazoprevir was proposed. For some hard-to-cure patient populations (e.g., prior treatment-
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 19/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
experienced null responders), a 16-week, ribavirin-containing regimen is proposed. HCV-infected 
patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (including patients on hemodialysis) will receive elbasvir 
/ grazoprevir without ribavirin. The recommended elbasvir / grazoprevir human dose is 100 mg/50 mg. 
Grazoprevir and elbasvir systemic plasma exposures in HCV-infected patients determined in clinical 
protocols PN060, PN061, and PN068 (pooled geometric mean steady state AUC0-24 hr) are 1.97 µM.hr 
and 2.38 µM.hr, respectively; corresponding Cmax values are 0.23 µM and 0.15 µM. 
Grazoprevir and elbasvir were investigated as monotherapies in non-clinical toxicity studies that 
consisted of a battery of in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity studies; repeat-dose oral toxicity studies of 
up to 1-month (elbasvir) or 3-months (grazoprevir) in mice, 6 months in rats, and 9 months in dogs; 
and a series of developmental and reproductive toxicity studies. In addition a 1-month oral elbasvir / 
grazoprevir combination dog toxicity study was conducted.  
The non-clinical absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of grazoprevir and elbasvir as well 
as drug-drug interactions (DDI) were studied separately. In accordance with ICH S1A guidance, 
carcinogenicity studies were not conducted as clinical is expected to be less than 6 months in duration 
and that there is an absence of a genotoxic signal in the battery of genotoxicity studies and no 
evidence of a proliferative signal in the chronic toxicity studies.  
Grazoprevir is also known as MK-5172 or L-002214070. Elbasvir is also known as MK-8742 or L-
002469825.

Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Grazoprevir 
In vitro 
The in vitro pharmacology of grazoprevir was assessed in enzymatic and cellular replication assays. 
The enzymatic activity of NS3/4A was measured by monitoring the hydrolysis of a peptide substrate in 
a time-resolved fluorescence assay. The potency of grazoprevir was assessed in in vitro enzymatic 
assays for GTs 1-6. Cell-based replication was evaluated with a HCV replicon model using either a 
primer protection or a TaqmanTM based quantitation method. In vitro testing of the combination of 
grazoprevir and elbasvir in suppression of resistance was assessed by monitoring the emergence of 
resistant colonies in GT1a replicon cells. RAVs emerging from the combined activity in the replicon cells 
were identified and characterised.  
Activity (IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration)) in a peptide hydrolysis-based enzymatic assay was sub-
nanomolar across all genotypes. Activities were low pM for GT1 enzymes, and range from 0.034 to 
0.135 nM for non-GT1 enzymes except for GT3a which shows an IC50 of 0.690 nM. 
Table 1.  In Vitro Activity of Grazoprevir against an Enzyme Genotype Panel  
SD: Standard deviation   
In a replicon assay, grazoprevir inhibited GT1a, GT1b, GT4a, and GT6a viral replication (EC50 = 0.4, 
0.5, 0.3, and 0.9 nM respectively) and demonstrated a modest shift in the presence of 40% normal 
human serum (NHS) (EC50 = 1.1 nM). It also showed potent against the full-length GT2a replicon 
(EC50 = 2.3 nM) and chimeric replicons of GT2b (EC50 = 3.7 nM), GT3a (EC50 = 7.6 nM), GT5a (EC50 
= 1.5 nM), and GT6a (EC50 = 0.9 nM). It is less potent against a full-length GT3a (S52) replicon 
(EC50 = 35 nM) but not a chimeric replicon bearing the NS3 catalytic domain (EC50 = 2.1 nM).  
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 21/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Grazoprevir was also shown to be potent against replicons bearing the protease gene from several 
patient isolates from GTs 1-6.  
Resistance 
In order to evaluate the potential for cross-resistance against RAVs from other classes of HCV DAAs, 
grazoprevir was tested against replicons bearing signature RAVs of these inhibitor classes. Grazoprevir 
potency was retained against a panel of RAVs commonly elicited by NS5A inhibitors and against critical 
resistance mutations to NS5B nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors (study number pd005). 
De novo resistance selection studies were conducted with grazoprevir in GTs 1-6 with concentrations 
up to 30-fold multiple of EC50, depending on the genotype (study number PD002). In GT1b, selection 
pressure by grazoprevir led to the isolation of encoded mutations at both amino acid residues 156 and 
168; another group of resistant genomes encoded mutations at both amino acid residues 41 and 156. 
Additional selections were conducted against GT1a, GT2a, GT3a, GT4a, GT5a, and GT6a replicons. 
Variants at position 168 were observed in all treatments. Notably, D168 A/E/G/N/V changes were seen 
in GT1a, GT4a, GT5a, and GT6a. For the GT2a selections, Y56H and A156T/V were the most frequently 
observed substitutions. For the GT3a selections, Q168R (~4-fold potency loss) was observed at all 
concentrations.  
The antiviral activity of grazoprevir was evaluated in combination with interferon-alpha, ribavirin and 
elbasvir, in GT1a replicon cells and quantified using MacSynergyTM and by directly analyzing the 
threshold cycle number (Ct) values without conversion to RNA amounts. Grazoprevir interacted 
additively with interferon-alpha, ribavirin and elbasvir (study number PD008). No cytotoxic effects 
were observed at any of the combination concentrations tested. 
Cellular cytotoxicity 
Cellular cytotoxicity was low when grazoprevir was assessed in replicon-containing Huh-7 cells and 
HeLa cells. In both cases, the measured CC50 was >60 µM (study number: pd003). 
In vivo 
The in vitro potency of grazoprevir in cell culture models was further examined in a chimpanzee model 
(New Iberia Research Centre, Lafayette, Louisiana, Study number PD004). Animals were infected with 
GT1b and given Grazoprevir at 1 mg/kg b.i.d. for 7 days. Blood was processed into plasma within 1 
hour after collection. Viral load was determined by Cenetron 1210 HCV quantitative Polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) assay (LOQ 15 IU/mL). Dosing of grazoprevir at 1 mg/kg b.i.d. for 7 days resulted in a 
4-5 log reduction in HCV RNA in plasma in a chimpanzee infected with GT1b. In GT1a, grazoprevir 
administration resulted in a ~3.5 log reduction of viral load. There was a rapid rebound of circulating 
viruses upon cessation of dosing. Sequencing of resistant viruses showed that the primary resistant 
variant harboured an R155K amino acid substitution.  
Grazoprevir was also quite efficacious in a chimpanzee homogenously infected with the R155K mutant 
virus yielding ~2 log reduction in viral load. Post dosing liver levels of grazoprevir were measured and 
found to be ~1 µM or higher after oral administration of 1 mg/kg b.i.d. for 7 days. No novel mutations 
within the protease gene were identified. There were no changes in haematological or clinical 
chemistry parameters. 
Elbasvir 
The potency of elbasvir was assessed using a panel of sub-genomic replicon cell lines that contained 
NS5A sequences from all genotypes. It showed potency against HCV GT1a (EC50 = 4 pM), GT1b (EC50 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 22/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
= 3 pM), GT2a (31L) (EC50 = 3 pM), GT3a (EC50 = 14 pM), GT4a (EC50 = 3 pM), GT5a (EC50 = 1 
pM), and GT6d (EC50 = 3 pM) with EC50 values in the picomolar range (3-14 pM) (Study number 
pd016). It was shown to be less active against the GT2b replicon with an EC50 of 3.4 nM.  
Table 2.  Potency of Elbasvir in HCV Genotypes 1-6 Replicons 
a Standard deviation (SD) was calculated from N ≥3 independent experiments. 
b This replicon has the GT2b, GT5a, GT6, and GT6d NS5A sequences in JFH1 background. 
c These replicons have the GT3a and GT4a NS5A sequences in con1 background 
In addition to genotype-specific reference NS5A sequences, elbasvir was also tested against replicons 
generated with several patient isolates from GTs1-6. Elbasvir was potent against GT1a and GT1b 
patient isolates with little variation in potency with EC50 values ranging from 3-10 pM). Among GT2 
patient isolates, the potency of elbasvir was more varied with EC50s ranging from 0.003 to 20 nM 
largely due to the presence of 31M in GT2b patient isolates, although, according to the Applicant,  
contextual sequences may also play a role (Study number pd009). 
Table 3.  Potency of Elbasvir in Genotype 2 Replicon Cells 
a SD was calculated from N ≥3 independent experiments. 
b Replicon has GT2b NS5A sequence in the background of JFH1 
Elbasvir was potent in GT3a patient isolates (study number pd002) with EC50 values ranging from 3 
pM to 0.4 nM but less potent in 3i and 3g subtypes that harboured RAVs at positions 28, 30, and 31 
respectively. Elbasvir maintained potency in a diverse set of GT4 subtypes with subpicomolar EC50 
values for most isolates. Elbasvir is also potent in GT5a patient isolates with EC50 values ranging from 
0.4 – 1 pM. Against a diverse set of GT6 patient subtypes, elabsvir maintained sub-picomolar to low 
nanomolar activity (study number pd003). In a GT6n patient isolate, the least susceptible subtype 
identified with an EC50 value of 2.7 nM, amino acid substitutions at positions 28, 30, and 93 were 
observed. 
The activity of elbasvir was also assessed in replicons from HCV genotypes encoding defined mutations 
reported in pre-clinical or clinical studies particularly in the more studied GT1a. Elbasvir was potent 
against a number of the RAVs particularly those from GT1a, GT1b, and GT4a. Elbasvir was more potent 
than ledipasvir and ombitasvir and displayed a higher activity against RAVs from GT1b compared to

GT1a. All signature RAVs elicited by previous NS5A compounds in GT1b caused only modest potency 
reductions (>20-fold) against elbasvir; EC50 values were ≤50 pM. In contrast, the most shifted 
variants in GT1a caused a 2-3 log reduction in elbasvir potency. The data suggest baseline RAVs would 
be less impactful in GT1b than in GT1a. Elbasvir showed reduced activity particularly against Y93H 
substitutions in GT1a, GT1b, GT2a, and GT3a although improved over approved NS5A compounds, 
ledipasvir and ombitasvir.  
Additional RAVs in GT1a that reduced the potency of elbasvir were L31M/V and Q30D/E/H/K/R. In 
GT2a, GT5a, and GT6a reduced activity was observed for substitutions at F/L28S/F and L31F (study 
number PD002). The presence of the natural resistance polymorph 31M in GT2b caused resistance to 
elbasvir. In addition to stable replicons, a more rapid transient infectious virus assay was also used to 
investigate defined resistance in GT1a (Study number PD010). Similar results were obtained for both 
cell model systems used to study RAVs. 
Cell cytotoxicity 
Cell cytotoxicity was low, with a measured CC50 of >25 µM in Huh7 replicon cells, HeLa, HepG2, 
HEK293T, Hep3B, and MT4 cells (study number PD011). 
Resistance 
Cross-resistance 
In order to evaluate the potential for cross-resistance versus RAVs from other classes of HCV DAA 
inhibitors, elbasvir was tested against replicons bearing signature RAVs from these inhibitor classes. 
Elbasvir maintained activity and its potency was not shifted against any of the signature RAVs selected 
by NS3 protease inhibitors or NS5B polymerase nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors indicating no 
potential for cross-resistance (study number pd002) 
De novo resistance selection studies were conducted with elbasvir in GTs 1-6 with concentrations up to 
10,000X EC90 depending on the genotype. Generally, the number of resistant colonies decreased with 
increasing concentrations of elbasvir. Sequencing of RNA isolated from resistant colonies showed that 
variants occurred primarily at positions 28, 30, 31, and 93. Substitutions at Q30 and Y93 were mainly 
responsible for potency losses in GT1a. Amino acid substitutions F28S, Y93H, and Y93H in GT2a, GT2b, 
and GT3a respectively resulted in substantial (>1000-fold) potency losses in those genotypes. Elbasvir 
presented a higher genetic barrier to resistance in GT1b and GT4a where 2 nucleotide changes were 
generally required to elicit resistance. Amino acid substitutions, L28F and L31F, in GT5a and F28S and 
L31F in GT6 were the main variants responsible for resistance. Potency analysis showed the variants at 
these key positions caused the most elbasvir potency losses (>1000-fold) in the genotypes (study 
number PD002 and PD003). 
Combination 
The activity of the combination of elbasvir and grazoprevir was also studied on emergence of 
resistance in GT1a replicon cells. As independent agents, 100X and 1000X EC90 of grazoprevir and 
elbasvir respectively were required to suppress emergence of resistant colonies. In combination, 10X 
EC90 of each compound blocked the emergence of resistant colonies suggesting the combination acts, 
at least, additively (study number pd008). Clonal sequencing analysis of resistant colonies selected 
with >1X EC90 combinations of both compounds revealed mostly linked mutations with 2 or more 
nucleotide changes underscoring a higher genetic barrier to resistance when the inhibitors are used in 
combination.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Grazoprevir 
HCV NS3/4A is a serine protease; therefore, the inhibitory potency of grazoprevir was determined in 
reactions catalysed by human serine proteases. Grazoprevir showed selectivity over elastase and 
trypsin (IC50 =100 µM), but showed modest inhibitory potency with chymotrypsin (IC50 = 1495 nM) 
however it was 373,750-fold selective (study number pd006). 
In a panel of enzyme and receptor binding displacement assays 11 targets were found in which 
inhibitory activity resulted in an EC50 =100 µM (study number pd007). All potencies were greater than 
1 µM, yielding in all cases a specificity index relative to the GT1b enzyme greater than 1,000,000-fold.  
Table 4.  Summary of Activities >100 µM against a Panel of Enzyme or Binding Displacement Assays 
pd007 - MK-5172: To evaluate, in Enzyme, and Radioligand Binding assays, the activity of compound MKW-1004 (PT #1104878) 
Grazoprevir was not an inhibitor of CES1, CES2, and Cat A that are implicated in metabolism of HCV 
nucleotide prodrugs (Study number pd012) and so has no potential to impact CES1/2- and Cat A-
mediated metabolism of pro-drugs and other therapeutic agents. 
Grazoprevir was tested in a multiple round HIV infection assay in MT4 cells and in an HBV replication 
assay in HepG2.2.15 cells to investigate its potential activity against these viruses. Grazoprevir did not 
register any activity against HIV at 8.4 µM (study number pd011) or HBV at 10 µM (study number 
pd014). Thus, a specificity factor >1X104 was derived relative to its activity in GT1a replicon (EC50 = 
0.4 nM). As a sizeable proportion of HCV patients are co-infected with HIV, grazoprevir may be co-
dosed with HIV drugs. In combination studies with a set of 10 approved HIV drugs (including tenofovir, 
emtricitabine, darunavir, atazanavir, raltegravir, dolutegravir, efavirenz, rilpivirine, enfuvirtide, and 
maraviroc) in HIV replication, a concentration of 100 nM grazoprevir increased maraviroc EC50 1.2-fold 
from 0.38 ± 0.03 nM to 0.45 ± 0.03 nM (p value = 0.03) in cell culture. There was no impact on the 
other HIV drugs in the presence of any concentration of grazoprevir tested (15 - 500 nM). The HIV 
drugs at clinically relevant concentrations did not impact the inhibitory potency of grazoprevir in GT1a 
replicon cells (study number: pd015).  
Elbasvir 
No significant activities were noted in 116 enzymatic or radioligand binding assays (study number 
pd001). Testing in the enzyme assays identified 3 targets with IC50 values <10 µM. Only 1 target, rat 
Protein Serine/Threonine Kinase PKC (non-selective) gave an IC50 of 0.877 µM that was <1 µM, 
yielding a specificity factor of >100,000-fold relative to HCV GT1 replicon (replicon EC90).

Elbasvir was inactive against CES1, and CES2, and Cat A that are implicated in metabolism of pro-
drugs (study number PD012). 
As a large proportion of HCV patients are co-infected with HIV, elbasvir may be co-dosed with HIV 
drugs. In combination studies with a set of 10 approved HIV drugs (including tenofovir, emtricitabine, 
darunavir, atazanavir, raltegravir, dolutegravir, efavirenz, rilpivirine, enfuvirtide, and maraviroc) in HIV 
replication there was no impact on the other HIV drugs in the presence of clinically relevant 
concentrations of elbasvir (30 to 500 nM). Conversely, the HIV drugs did not impact the inhibitory 
potency of elbasvir in GT1a replicon cells at clinically relevant concentrations (study number PD015). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Grazoprevir 
Cardiovascular (CV) 
Human ether-à-go-go-related gene (Herg) assay 
Grazoprevir was tested for its effect on hERG potassium channel current (IKr), the slowly activating 
delayed rectifier cardiac potassium channel current (IKs) and the cardiac sodium channel hNav1.5 
expressed in mammalian cells. hERG current was inhibited with IC50 value of 8.9 µM and an IC20 
value of 3.5 µM. Enhanced hERG step current (while inhibiting the hERG tail current), indicated a 
complex activity profile. However, this complex activity profile was not considered a concern based on 
the high hERG current IC50 and IC20 and was consequently not explored further. There was no effect 
on IKs or INa at the highest concentration tested of 30 µM. 
Grazoprevir was tested for effect on hERG channels heterologously expressed in CHO-K1 cells using 
standard whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques. Grazoprevir inhibited hERG current with an IC50 value 
of 25 µM and an IC20 value of 6.3 µM. In addition to the concentration-dependent inhibitory effects, 
apparent effects on the gating properties of the hERG current, beyond the scope of the study, were 
noted, most notably at actual test concentrations of 27 and 96 μM. The Applicant goes onto say that 
the concentration responses for hERG inhibition and enhancement were more clearly separated and 
even less potent when measured at physiological temperatures in the GLP hERG study. 
The Applicant stated that taking into account that the hERG assay was conducted in absence of protein 
and that grazoprevir is >99% protein bound in humans, the IKr IC50 is >10,000X the unbound Cmax 
in HCV-infected patients (100 mg). Additionally, there were apparent effects on the gating properties 
of the hERG current at actual test concentrations of 27 µM and 96 µM. These effects were not 
considered a concern based on the high concentrations at the effect levels compared to the unbound 
Cmax at the human recommended dose of grazoprevir (100 mg).  
Exploratory Cardiovascular Study in Anesthetised Dogs 
In an intravenous exploratory cardiovascular study in anesthetised dogs performed at 1, 2, and 
2mg/kg, there were no test article-related effects. Mean grazoprevir plasma concentrations measured 
following the 30-minute infusions of 1, 2 and 2 mg/kg were 12.6, 48.5, and 74.4 µM (Mean), 
respectively. 
Cardiovascular and Respiratory 
Oral Cardiovascular and Respiratory Telemetry Study in Dogs 
An oral cardiovascular and respiratory telemetry study in dogs was performed at doses of 5, 20, and 
600 mg/kg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 26/151 
 
 
 
 
 
At 20 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg, increases in heart rate (peak changes: +42 bpm [42%] and +32 bpm 
[30%], respectively) and coincident decreases in QT interval (peak changes: -17 msec [-7%] and -20 
msec [-9%], respectively) were observed approximately 3 to 20 hours post dose. Decreases in PR 
interval (peak changes: -8 msec [-9%]) were also observed 5 to 12 hours post dose at 600 mg/kg. 
There were no other test article-related effects. The no-observed-effect level (NOEL) was considered to 
be 5 mg/kg (approximately 50X the grazoprevir Cmax in HCV-infected patients (100 mg) and the 
NOEL for respiratory function was 600 mg/kg. There were no cardiovascular changes observed at the 
electrocardiographic (ECG) examination or at histomorphological examination in the 1-month oral 
toxicity study in dogs at up op 600 mg/kg/day. Cmax = 105 µM at 600 mg/kg/day is approximately 
457X the grazoprevir Cmax in HCV-infected patients (100 mg). 
There was no test article-related QTc changes in the supratherapeutic dose QTc clinical study 
conducted in healthy volunteers administered a single oral dose of grazoprevir at 1600 mg.  
Central nervous system (CNS) 
The potential neurobehavioral effects of grazoprevir were evaluated in functional observational battery 
(FOB) assays was performed at doses up to the dose resulting in maximum achievable exposure, 200 
mg/kg b.i.d. There were no test article-related effects. At 50 mg/kg Cmax was 27.8 μM after a single 
oral dose (measured in the exploratory single and multiple dose oral toxicokinetic study in rats (Study 
number TT 09-1102) is approximately 121X the Cmax in HCV-infected patients (100 mg). 
Other studies 
In Vivo Liver Response Assay 
An exploratory liver screening assay was conducted to evaluate grazoprevir-related changes in 
expression of liver genes in Wistar Han rats. The extent of the changes in gene expression observed 
indicated that grazoprevir had limited impact on rat liver function.  
Elbasvir 
Cardiovascular (CV) 
hERG 
In the definitive assay, elbasvir minimally inhibited IKr by 5.2% at a maximum testable concentration 
of 10 µM in heterologously-expressed hERG channels using standard voltage-clamp techniques. 
Elbasvir was also tested for its potential effect on IKs and INav1.5 . There was no effect on IKs and a 
minimal inhibition of INav1.5 (17%) at the maximum testable concentration, 30 µM. These assays 
were conducted in absence of protein. Elbasvir is >99% protein bound in humans, the IKr IC50 is 
>6,500X the unbound Cmax in HCV-infected patients (50 mg). 
In vivo 
Conscious dogs were given oral doses of 0.5, 2, and 50 mg/kg, there were no cardiovascular findings. 
The NOEL for cardiovascular changes was considered to be 50 mg/kg. No pharmacokinetics was 
collected in telemetrised dogs; however, at a single dose of 25 mg/kg, the dose of the 14-day oral 
toxicity study in dogs Cmax = 0.594 μM and represents approximately 4X the Cmax in HCV-infected 
patients (50 mg).

Respiratory  
Conscious dogs were given single doses of 0.5, 2, and 50 mg/kg. No test article-related changes in 
respiratory function or body temperature were observed. The no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for 
respiratory and body temperature effects wad considered to be 50 mg/kg. 
CNS 
A FOB study was conducted after a single dose in rats (oral doses of 100, 300 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg 
b.i.d. (total daily dose, 2000 mg/kg). There were no test article-related neurobehavioral changes. No 
pharmacokinetics was collected after a single day of administration at 1000 mg/kg b.i.d. However, 
after 7 daily doses of 750 mg/kg in the exploratory 7-day tolerability study in male rats, Cmax = 1.14 
µM and represents approximately 8X the Cmax in HCV-infected patients (50 mg). 
Other studies 
Additional screening studies were performed to determine elbasvir serum biochemical profile in rats 
and dogs to identify any potential elbasvir-related changes in gene expression indicative of changes in 
pathways associated with various physiologic or pathologic functions in some major rat organs or 
tissues. No effects were noted.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic parameters of grazoprevir and elbasvir have been studied in mice, Wistar Han 
(WI) or, pigmented Dutch-Belted rabbits, beagle dogs and cynomologus monkeys. A battery of studies 
has been conducted to determine the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profile of 
grazoprevir and elbasvir in multiple non-clinical species including those used for both pharmacological 
(mouse and rat) and toxicological (rat, rabbit and dog) evaluations. Grazoprevir and elbasvir were 
administered as 14C labelled, [3H]-labelled or un-labelled drug. The routes of administration were 
intravenous or oral. 
Methods of analysis 
Grazoprevir 
Plasma and liver concentrations of grazoprevir for the evaluation of the PK/ADME (non-GLP 
pharmacokinetic experiments of the compound were determined by LC/MS/MS following protein 
precipitation using Turbo Ion Spray in positive ion mode. Radioactivity was determined by direct liquid 
scintillation counting (LSC) of samples or HPLC eluent (the latter with an in-line radiochemical flow 
detector). For samples with limited total radioactivity, the HPLC eluent was fractionally collected into 
scintillation plates and the plates were dried and counted using a microbeta counter. Reverse-phase 
HPLC combined with radiometric detection was used to obtain [3H]grazoprevir or [14C]grazoprevir 
metabolite profiles. Metabolite structures were determined by mass spectrometry. For toxicokinetic 
studies, plasma and liver concentrations of grazoprevir were determined by a validated LC MS/MS 
method in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). 
Elbasvir 
Both plasma and liver concentrations of elbasvir were determined by LC/MS/MS following protein 
precipitation using Turbo Ion spray in positive ion mode for the characterization of the PK/ADME (non-
GLP studies) of the compound. Radioactivity was determined by direct LSC of samples and of HPLC 
eluent using radiochemical flow detectors or in cases of low total radioactivity, by fractionally collecting 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016

samples into plates and then counting the dried plates using a microbeta detector. The metabolite 
profiles were obtained using reverse-phase HPLC combined with radiometric detection and metabolite 
structures were determined using mass spectrometry. Validated LC/MS/MS methods in accordance 
with GLP were used for the toxicokinetic determinations of elbasvir plasma and liver concentrations. 
Absorption  
Grazoprevir  
Following intravenous administration of grazoprevir, the mean plasma clearance (CLp) in rats and dogs 
was 27.8 mL/min/kg and 5.2 mL/min/kg, the elimination half-life (t1/2) was 1.4 and 3.0 hours, and 
the steady state volume of distribution (Vdss) was 3.1 L/kg and 0.7 L/kg in the rat and dog, 
respectively (Study Report PK001, 043M94). Following oral administration of grazoprevir, the 
bioavailability (%F) in both of these species was low (12-13%). Based on studies conducted in bile 
duct-cannulated (BDC) rats and dogs, the fraction absorbed was estimated to be ~40%, suggesting 
that the low oral bioavailability likely results from incomplete absorption and a hepatic first pass effect. 
In female Dutch Belted rabbits orally administered 200 mg/kg grazoprevir, the mean Cmax, Tmax, and 
AUC0-∞ were 8.0 µM, 1.5 hr, and 68 µM∙hr, respectively (Study Report PK004, 043M94). 
In a toxicokinetics study, the effect of multiple oral dosing and gender on grazoprevir pharmacokinetics 
was also evaluated in SD rats. In a 14 day study, grazoprevir oral exposures in rat were similar 
following single (101 µM∙hr) or multiple (70.0 µM∙hr) oral doses of 50 mg/kg. In another study, the 
AUC0-24hr was 10.1 µM∙hr in males and 7.44 µM∙hr in female WI rats after multiple oral doses of 25 
mg/kg for 1 month. The AUC0-24hr was 16.5 µM∙hr in males and 29.6 µM∙hr in female WI rats after 
multiple oral doses of 50 mg/kg for 1 month. 
Elbasvir 
Elbasvir pharmacokinetics was studied in WI rats, Dutch Belted rabbits, beagle dogs, and cynomologus 
monkey. In rat, dog, and monkey, respectively, elbasvir had a moderate plasma clearance (24 
mL/min/kg, 8.4 mL/min/kg, and 5.2 mL/min/kg), volume of distribution (5.0 L/kg, 3.0 L/kg, and 2.7 
L/kg) and half-life (4.2, 7.7, and 16 hours) (Study Report PK001, 03YQQP. The oral bioavailability of 
elbasvir was low in rats (3-9%) and moderate in dogs (~35%). The estimated fraction absorbed in 
those species was ~0.1-0.4 based on the totality of intravenous and oral pharmacokinetics as well as 
excretion data in BDC animals. Tmax was prolonged, occurring at 3-5 hours. In both rats and dogs, the 
oral exposures were less than dose-proportional, possibly due to solubility-limited absorption (Study 
Report PK001, 03YQQP; 2.6.6.B.3.8). 
Multiple dose oral exposures were also studied in rats, and comparison of the single dose (300 mg/kg) 
AUC0-∞ of 7.8 µM∙hr to the multiple dose (300 mg/kg) AUC0-∞ of 11.5 (Table 2.6.6: B.9) indicates 
some potential for accumulation. Exposures in male and female rats were comparable. 
In dogs administered repeated oral doses of 2, 25, and 1000 mg/kg, the comparison of AUC0-∞ on 
Day 1 to Week 5 showed no potential for accumulation or autoinduction of elbasvir. The multiple dose 
studies were conducted in both male and female dogs and the data indicated a lack of gender-
dependence on the oral PK of elbasvir.

Distribution 
Grazoprevir  
Rat 
The tissue distribution of grazoprevir was assessed in Wistar Han (WI; non-pigmented) and Long 
Evans (LE; pigmented) rats by quantitative whole body autoradiography (QWBA) following a single oral 
dose (50 mg/kg) of [14C]grazoprevir (Study Report PK015, 03Z4SS). The distribution pattern of 
grazoprevir in the WI and LE rats was similar. Grazoprevir tissue distribution was limited and 
radioactivity was located primarily in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and liver. Selective distribution to 
the liver was consistent with grazoprevir being a rat OATP1B2 substrate. Grazoprevir and related 
radioactivity had limited distribution to the brain, as anticipated for a P-gp substrate. In the pigmented 
LE rats, low levels (494 ng radioequivalents/g tissue) of radioactivity were detected in the uveal tract 
of the eye at 8 hours; however, the radioactivity was below the limit of quantification by 24 hours, 
indicating that grazoprevir and related radioactivity does not bind to melanin. Elimination of 
radioactivity was nearly complete from most tissues by 24 hours post dose and in all tissues, including 
the GI tract and liver, by 168 hours post dose, demonstrating that grazoprevir and related radioactivity 
is effectively eliminated. 
In a separate study, the concentration of grazoprevir in the liver and plasma of rats was studied as a 
function of time at several oral doses of 5, 25, and 100 mg/kg (Study Reports PK001, 043M94; PK005, 
042YRZ). At all-time points, the liver concentrations exceeded the plasma concentrations. The liver to 
plasma concentration ratios ranged from ~400 at plasma concentrations less than ~0.1 µM and 
decreased to 5 at a plasma concentration of 51.1 µM, suggesting some saturable uptake process. 
While the plasma exposures (AUC0-∞) increased in a greater than dose proportional manner, the liver 
exposures were proportional between the 5 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg oral doses and less than dose 
proportional from the 25 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg doses. At the 25 mg/kg dose which has a well-defined 
curve, the terminal plasma and liver concentrations declined in parallel with an estimated half-life of 
~7 hours. 
Dog 
Liver and plasma concentrations were also studied in dog following oral doses of 1 or 5 mg/kg [Study 
Reports PK001, 043M94; PK005, 042YRZ). The results in dog mimic the results in rat with liver 
concentrations exceeding the plasma concentrations at all times. Also like rat, the dog liver to plasma 
concentration ratios decreased as the plasma concentrations increased, indicating potential saturable 
uptake into liver. The liver to plasma concentration ratios ranged from ~70 at plasma concentrations 
less than ~0.04 µM and decreased to 5 at a plasma concentration of 8.33 µM. In this species, the 
terminal plasma clearance described the terminal liver clearance with an elimination half-life of ~9 
hours. Grazoprevir elimination from the dog liver was complete by ~72 hours. 
Placental Transfer in Rat and Rabbit 
Grazoprevir crosses the placenta of pregnant rats and rabbits. The foetal to maternal plasma 
concentration ratios range from 0.0138 to 0.894 in rat and 0.0128 to 0.0706 in rabbit. 
In Vitro Plasma Protein Binding and Blood-to-Plasma Concentration Ratio 
Grazoprevir was bound extensively to plasma proteins. The extent of binding was similar in all species 
tested with a fraction unbound of 0.016, 0.014, 0.009, and 0.012 in rat, rabbit, dog, and human, 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 30/151 
 
 
 
 
 
respectively (Study Reports PK003, 0436QZ; PK004, 043M96). The unbound concentration was 
constant over the range tested (0.1 – 10 µM). Grazoprevir bound to both human serum albumin and 
α1-acid glycoprotein and the binding to these proteins was not saturable at concentrations up to 10 µM 
(Study Report PK021, 03XQKZ). 
An in vitro analysis of plasma from renal disease patients and healthy matched control subjects 
indicated that renal disease does not alter grazoprevir plasma protein binding; the unbound fractions 
were 0.022, 0.018, and 0.017 in patients with severe renal impairment, patients with end stage renal 
disease (ESRD) on dialysis, and in healthy matched control subjects, respectively (Study Report 
PK021, 03XQKZ). In vitro plasma protein binding was also conducted on samples from varying degrees 
of hepatic insufficiency and showed that hepatic insufficiency did not change grazoprevir plasma 
protein binding.  
The unbound fractions were 0.017 and 0.012 in mild hepatic insufficient and matched controlled 
subjects, respectively, 0.021 and 0.017 in moderate hepatic insufficient and matched controlled 
subjects, respectively, and 0.019 and 0.017 in severe hepatic insufficiency and matched controlled 
subjects, respectively (Study Report PK021, 03XQKZ). 
The in vitro equilibrium blood-to-plasma concentration ratio was independent of the grazoprevir 
concentrations (0.1-10 µM) tested, with mean values of 0.6, 0.5, and 0.7 for rat, dog, and human, 
respectively (Study Report PK003, 0436QZ), indicating that grazoprevir does not extensively partition 
into blood cells and that total blood clearance is higher than plasma clearance in these species. 
Elbasvir 
The tissue distribution of [14C]elbasvir was studied using QWBA in both pigmented Long Evans (LE) 
rats and non-pigmented WI rats following a single 30 mg/kg P.O. dose (Study Report PK008, 03LRMP). 
Elbasvir distributed well into most tissues including the liver, but had limited distribution to the brain; 
elbasavir was shown to be a P-gp substrate (Study Report PK008, 03LRMP; PK004, 03Y5VM). Total 
radioactivity was below the limit of quantification in all tissues except the spleen, kidney cortex, liver, 
and Harderian gland by 7 days post dose and in all tissues by 28 days post dose, except the uveal tract 
of the eye in pigmented rats. At an early time point, the concentration of total radioactivity in the uveal 
tract of the eye was low and the same in both the pigmented and non-pigmented rats, but as time 
progressed the elimination of radioactivity from uveal tract of the pigmented rats was slower. The 
retention of radioactivity in the uveal tract of the pigmented rats indicated a potential for elbasvir to 
bind to melanin which is sometimes related to phototoxicity. However, elbasvir phototoxicity potential 
was studied in preclinical species and found to not be of concern. 
The distribution of elbasvir to the liver and brain was also examined using LC/MS/MS analysis following 
a 30 mg/kg P.O. dose to WI rats. The results show a brain to plasma AUC0-24hr ratio of 0.3 and a 
liver to plasma AUC0-24hr ratio of 193. The limited distribution to the brain is consistent with the 
QWBA analysis; however, the LC/MS/MS-based analysis indicates a higher distribution of elbasvir into 
the liver (liver to plasma AUC0-24hr = 193) as compared to the QWBA analysis (liver to plasma 
concentration ratio 12-20). The reason for the quantitative difference in elbasvir distribution to the 
liver based on the two different methods of analysis remains unknown. However, the results suggest 
that elbasvir distributed relatively well into the liver, the target organ for HCV-treatment. 
Placental Transfer in Rat and Rabbit 
Elbasvir placental transfer was studied in pregnant rats and rabbits following 1000 mg/kg/day oral 
dosing from Gestation Day (GD) 6/7 to GD 20 with placental transfer evaluated on GD 20. Elbasvir

crossed the placenta of both rats and rabbits with fetal plasma concentrations being 0.6 to 5% that of 
the maternal plasma. 
In Vitro Plasma Protein Binding and Blood-to-Plasma Concentration Ratio 
Elbasvir binding to plasma proteins was extensive. In mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human the 
unbound fraction was <0.001 and independent of the concentration tested (Study Reports PK002, 
03XZ42; PK005, 03Y9KC). The unbound fraction in rabbit plasma was higher at 0.012 (Study Report 
PK005, 03Y9KC). Elbasvir bound to both human serum albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein and binding 
to both of these plasma proteins was considered to contribute to the low unbound fraction in plasma 
(Study Report PK012, 03YB6T). In in vitro evaluations, elbasvir plasma protein binding was unchanged 
in both renal insufficient and hepatically impaired patients (Study Report PK0012, 03YB6T). 
Elbasvir did not preferentially partition into blood cells with blood to plasma concentration ratios of 
0.61, 0.94, 0.56, and 0.62 in rat, dog, monkey, and human, respectively (Study Report PK002, 
03XZ42). The total blood clearance was, therefore, slightly higher than the reported plasma clearances 
for these species. 
Metabolism 
Grazoprevir 
In Vivo Metabolism in Rat, Rabbit, Dog, and Human 
The in vivo metabolism of [3H] or [14C]grazoprevir was studied in the rat, rabbit, dog and human. The 
studies indicated that in all preclinical species tested, both metabolism and biliary excretion of intact 
compound contributed to grazoprevir elimination. Across the preclinical species tested and humans, 
oxidative metabolism was the major route of biotransformation and little or no circulating metabolites 
observed. 
The metabolism of [3H] or [14C]grazoprevir was determined in BDC male WI rats following a 5 mg/kg 
P.O. dose, in BDC male Beagle dogs following a 0.5 mg/kg intravenous dose or 1 mg/kg P.O. dose, and 
in intact female Dutch Belted rabbits following a 200 mg/kg oral dose (Study Reports PK002, 03Z77Z; 
PK004, 043M96; PK018, 03ZXFB). In rats, radioactivity recovered in bile and feces represented 28.1% 
and 72.8%, respectively, of the administered dose and a negligible amount (0.4%) of the radioactive 
dose was recovered in urine (Study Report PK002, 03Z77Z). The metabolites characterized in rat bile 
and feces consisted of several minor metabolites resulting from oxidative metabolism (M1a, M3, M4a, 
M4b, M5, M7a, M9) or oxidative metabolism and the addition of glutathione (M8) (Study Report PK002, 
03Z77Z). The elimination and biotransformation of grazoprevir in dogs was similar to rats. Following 
an intravenous dose to dogs, grazoprevir was eliminated in bile (74% of the dose) as approximately 
equivalent amounts of oxidative metabolites and grazoprevir, in feces (22% of the dose) and in urine 
(<1% of the dose) (Study Report PK018, 03ZXFB). The metabolites detected in dog bile (M3, M4a, 
M4b, M7a) were also detected in rat bile, indicating that the metabolism across species was similar. 
The radioactivity in feces following oral dosing was profiled and only grazoprevir and a metabolite likely 
formed via bacterial metabolism in the gut, M10, were identified. Only grazoprevir was detected in the 
plasma of rats and dogs following oral administration of [3H] or [14C]grazoprevir. Similar to rats and 
dogs, grazoprevir was the major component of the radioactivity eliminated in rabbit feces and several 
minor oxidative metabolites (M1a, M3, M4a, M4b, M5, M7a, and M9) were also observed. The

predominant radioactive peak in rabbit plasma was grazoprevir along with minor amounts of 
metabolites M3, M4a, M4b, and M7. 
Overall, the metabolism of grazoprevir in preclinical species and human was similar. Following an oral 
dose of 186-188 mg (~200 µCi) of [14C]grazoprevir to humans, essentially the entire radioactive dose 
(110%) was excreted in feces, with urinary recovery contributing only 0.29% [PK016, 03N2K3]. Based 
on the fecal metabolic profile, grazoprevir and M10 (considered a likely bacterial product of grazoprevir 
formed and retained within the alimentary canal) accounted for 80% of the administered dose and 
oxidative metabolites (and their bacterial products) account for 22% of the administered dose (Study 
Report PK009, 03ZXF3). A minor oxidative metabolite observed only in human feces, M14 (4% of the 
dose), was structurally similar to the metabolite M5 (M14 without hydroxylation) formed in vivo in rats 
and rabbits and in vitro in rats, rabbits, dogs and humans. 
Based on the absolute oral bioavailability study in human, the human fraction absorbed was estimated 
to be ~0.5 with wide variability [see Clinical Report] and coupled with the metabolism data suggests 
that biliary excretion and metabolism contribute almost equally to the elimination of grazoprevir in 
human. The oxidative metabolites observed in human feces were observed in the preclinical species 
(Study Reports PK002, 03Z77Z; PK004, 043M96; PK018, 03ZXFB). Also, similar to rats and dogs, 
grazoprevir was the only radioactive peak detected in human plasma (Study Report PK009, 03ZXF3). 
In Vitro Metabolism in Mouse, Rat, Rabbit, Dog, and Human 
The in vitro metabolism of grazoprevir was studied in liver microsomes and hepatocytes from rat, 
rabbit, dog, and human and hepatic microsomes from mice (Study Reports PK003, 0436QZ; PK004, 
043M96; PK009, 03ZXF3; PK026, 03YBN6). The in vitro metabolism across species was similar with 
oxidative metabolism being the predominant biotransformation pathway. In rat, rabbit, dog, and 
human liver preparations, 8 oxidative metabolites were identified. The metabolites resulted from 
hydroxylation (M1a, M4a, M4b, M7a, and M9), oxidative O-dealkylation (M3), oxidative loss of the 
vinylcyclopropylamide (M5) and oxidation and addition of glutathione (M8). The metabolites formed in 
vitro were predictive of the metabolites formed in vivo, with the exception of the metabolites proposed 
to result from bacterial metabolism, M10, M11a, and M11b. In mouse liver microsomal incubations, 
minor amounts of M3, M4a, M4b, and M10 were observed. The metabolites identified in human liver 
preparations were also seen in the rat, rabbit, and dog liver preparations. 
The potential for grazoprevir to form chemically reactive metabolites was assessed using [3H] or 
[14H]grazoprevir with rat or human liver microsomes or human hepatocytes. Grazoprevir showed 
some NADPH-dependent covalent protein binding in both species and the covalent protein binding was 
decreased with the addition of glutathione (GSH) or ritonavir [an approved antiviral protease inhibitor 
(Study Report PK012, 03XQKP)]. The reduced covalent protein binding with the addition of ritonavir or 
GSH and in the absence of NADPH suggests that the bioactivation is CYP-dependent and that 
endogenous cellular antioxidants/nucleophiles can serve a protective role. The absence of metabolites 
indicative of bioactivation in human excreta suggests that formation of chemically reactive 
intermediates is minor, if any, in human. 
Elbasvir 
In Vivo Metabolism in Rat, Rabbit, Dog, and Human 
Following a 5 mg/kg intravenous dose of [14C]elbasvir to BDC male WI rats, elbasvir was eliminated 
predominantly as parent compound in bile (20.1%), urine (16.2%) and feces (20.2%), totalling 56.5% 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 33/151 
 
 
 
 
 
of the administered dose [Study Report PK017, 03YK0B; PK018, 03YQFJ]. Oxidative metabolites 
totalling 15.4% of the administered dose were also recovered in the bile as M2 and M3. The 
metabolites M2 and M3 are simple hydroxylation products of elbasvir. Following a 1 mg/kg intravenous 
dose of [14C]elbasvir to BDC dogs, only a minor amount (~4%) of the dose was recovered as the 
oxidative metabolites M2 and M3 in dog bile and feces (Study Reports PK011, 03Y9QY; PK016, 
03Y7QS). Profiling of plasma from rats and dogs that received an oral dose of elbasvir indicated that 
only elbasvir circulates in these species (Study Reports PK003, 03YQYY; PK003, 03YQYY). 
Following a 100 mg/kg oral dose of [14C]elbasvir to intact Dutch Belted rabbits the majority of the 
dose was recovered in feces (70%) with very little drug related material recovered in urine (1%) 
[Study Report PK005, 03Y9KC]. The radioactivity extracted from rabbit feces was profiled and the only 
radioactive peak observed was elbasvir (Study Report PK005, 03Y9KC). Several minor oxidative 
metabolites (M1a, M1b, M2, M2a, M2b, M2c, M3, and M4) were detected using mass spectrometry 
only. Rabbit plasma was also profiled and elbasvir was the only radioactive peak observed with minor 
amounts of the oxidative metabolites M2b and M4 found using mass spectrometry [Study Report 
PK005, 03Y9KC). 
The metabolism of elbasvir in preclinical species was representative of the metabolism in human. The 
oxidative metabolites, M2 and M3, found in the excreta of preclinical species were also the only two 
metabolites detected in human excreta (feces) (Study Reports PK010, 040346; PK013, 03WD9D). 
Elbasvir was the only dose-related material detected in human plasma (Study Reports PK010, 040346; 
PK013, 03WD9D). Since the metabolites formed in vivo in human (M2 and M3) are also formed in the 
rat, rabbit, and dog, these preclinical species are suitable toxicology species (Study Reports PK002, 
03XZ42; PK005, 03Y9KC). 
In Vitro Metabolism in Mice, Rat, Rabbit, Dog, and Human 
Elbasvir demonstrated low turnover in mouse, rat, dog, and human liver microsomes and/or 
hepatocytes. Qualitatively, metabolites observed in human were also observed in animal liver 
preparations. In rat, rabbit, dog, and human liver preparations 2 hydroxylation products, M2 and M3, 
were identified (Study Reports PK002, 03XZ42; PK005, 03Y9KC) A trace amount of a double oxidation 
metabolite, M1, was also detected in rat, dog, and human hepatocytes (Study Reports PK002, 03XZ42; 
PK005, 03Y9KC). In mouse hepatocytes, M2 was detected. 
Excretion 
Grazoprevir 
In the preclinical species (WI rats, Dutch belted rabbits, and Beagle dogs) and humans, the major 
mode of grazoprevir elimination was biliary and/or faecal route, with little renal elimination. Following a 
5 mg/kg P.O. dose of [3H] grazoprevir to BDC rats, the radioactivity was recovered in bile (28.1%), 
faeces (72.8%), and urine (0.4%) totalling 101.3% (Study Report PK002, 03Z77Z). In intact rabbits 
following a 200 mg/kg oral dose, the radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (77.3%) and urine (1.4%) 
totalling 78.7% of the dose over 0-72 hours (Study Report PK004, 043M96). In BDC dogs following a 
0.5 mg/kg intravenous dose, the dose was recovered in bile (74.3%), faeces (22.0%) and urine 
(0.5%) and also in bile (27.8%), faeces (26.3%) and urine (3.4%) following a 1 mg/kg oral dose 
(Study Report PK018, 03ZXFB). Following a 186-188 mg oral dose to healthy human volunteers, 
grazoprevir was eliminated almost entirely into faeces (110%) with very little of the dose recovered in 
urine (0.29%) (Study Report PK016, 03N2K3).

Excretion in Milk of Rats 
Grazoprevir excretion into the milk of lactating rats was studied by determining the concentration of 
drug in maternal plasma and milk on Lactation Day (LD) 14 at 2 and 8 hours following 25 mg/kg/day, 
100 mg/kg/day, or 200 mg/kg b.i.d. from GD 6 to LD 14. Maternal plasma concentrations of 
grazoprevir ranged from 3.81 to 22.3 µM and milk concentrations from 1.70 to 31.7 µM. The milk to 
maternal plasma concentration ratios ranged from 0.538 to 0.866 indicating that grazoprevir is 
excreted into the milk of lactating rats. 
Excretion in Milk of Rats 
The excretion of elbasvir into the milk of lactating rats was investigated by measuring the 
concentration of drug in maternal plasma and milk on Lactation Day (LD) 14 following a 1000 
mg/kg/day oral dose from GD 6 to LD 14 (n=4). The concentrations in plasma and milk were 
determined at 2 hours after the last dose on LD 14. The elbasvir concentration in maternal plasma and 
milk at 2 hours was 1.40 µM and 5.75 µM, respectively, with a milk to plasma concentration ratio of 
4.15. The results showed the excretion of elbasvir into the milk of lactating rats. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Grazoprevir 
The potential for grazoprevir to be a victim of drug-drug interactions (DDI) was studied in vitro. The 
oxidative metabolism of grazoprevir was shown to be catalysed primarily by CYP3A (Study Reports 
PK003, 0436QZ; PK011, 044RQK). Grazoprevir was also shown to be a substrate for OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (Study Report PK003, 0436QZ). Therefore, grazoprevir was 
considered to have a potential to be a victim of drug-drug interactions by compounds known to inhibit 
or induce CYP3A and P-gp or inhibit OATP1B1 and/or OATP1B3. In vitro in LLC-PK1 cells, grazoprevir 
showed an apparent permeability (Papp) of 19x10-6 cm/s) (Study Report PK003, 0436QZ). 
The potential for grazoprevir to perpetrate DDIs was also studied in vitro. Grazoprevir showed some 
potential to inhibit intestinal CYP3A (IC50 = 73 µM), but not any of the other major CYPs, UGT1A1, 
CES1, CES2, or Cat A (PK013 (Study Reports PK013, 042TXL; PK008, 03Y9RJ). 
Grazoprevir did not show evidence of time-dependent inhibition of either CYP3A or CYP2C8 (Study 
Reports PK003, 0436QZ; PK025, 03YPR5). In incubations with primary human hepatocytes, 
grazoprevir showed no potential to induce CYP3A4, CYP1A2, or CYP2B6 (Study Report PK003, 
0436QZ). In in vitro studies, grazoprevir demonstrated time- and temperature-dependent uptake in 
rat and human hepatocytes, suggesting that a carrier (transporter)-mediated system(s) is involved in 
grazoprevir uptake into human and rat hepatocytes (Study Report PK003, 0436QZ). 
Based on in vitro data, grazoprevir is not predicted to inhibit P-gp, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3, but has 
some potential to inhibit intestinal BCRP (Study Reports PK003, 0436QZ; PK010, 03Y34H). Grazoprevir 
also showed some in vitro inhibition of BSEP, MRP2, MRP3, and MRP4 (Study Reports PK007, 03Y34C; 
PK017, 03DVGM). 
It is noted that in drug interaction studies conducted with grazoprevir, no information on the effects of 
organic anion transporter (OAT) 1, OAT3, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1 or OCT2 has been 
provided. The applicant is requested to provide this information 
Clinical interaction studies showed that grazoprevir is a CYP3A/P-gp and OATP1B1/3 substrate and 
weak inhibitor of CYP3A and BCRP.

Elbasvir 
Based on in vitro evaluations using human liver microsomes, elbasvir has a potential to be a victim of 
CYP3A/P-gp inhibition and induction. In human liver microsomes with specific chemical inhibitors and 
in experiments with recombinant CYP isoforms, elbasvir oxidative metabolism was shown to occur 
primarily via CYP3A (PK002, 03XZ42). In cell based assays expressing select transporters, elbasvir was 
shown to be a substrate for P-gp (PK002, 03XZ42; PK004, 03Y5VM; PK015, 03Y4Z0). In vitro, elbasvir 
appeared not to be a substrate for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 (PK002, PK004, PK015). Due to poor passive 
permeability (0.7-4.7 x 10-6 cm/sec) in the host cell line (Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II cells), 
it could not be determined whether or not elbasvir is a substrate for BCRP (PK004; 03Y5VM). 
Based on the in vitro evaluation, elbasvir was shown to have a low potential for perpetrating drug-drug 
interactions. In human liver microsomes, elbasvir did not inhibit any major CYP isoform (CYP1A2, 2B6, 
2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4) (PK020, 03Y5BH). Elbasvir was also not a time-dependent inhibitor of 
CYP3A (PK002, 03XZ42). In vitro, elbasvir was a weak inhibitor of UGT1A1 (70.9 µM) at two-orders of 
magnitude above the clinically relevant Cmax (0.151 µM) (PK009, 03MBKP; see Clinical Report). 
Therefore, elbasvir was considered unlikely to be a clinically-relevant inhibitor of UGT1A1. In 
incubations with human hepatocytes, elbasvir did not cause induction of CYP3A4, CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 
(PK020, 03Y5BR). In vitro, elbasvir showed some potential to inhibit human P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, 
and BCRP (PK002, 03XZ42; PK004, 03Y5VM; PK021, 03YS0W). 
Clinical interaction studies confirmed that elbasvir is a CYP3A/P-gp substrate and also that elbasvir is a 
mild inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, but not OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Grazoprevir 
No formal single dose toxicity studies have been conducted. However, consistent with ICH M3 (R2) 
guidance, acute toxicity was assessed from the repeat-dose toxicity studies, in which oral doses of 
grazoprevir up to 500 mg/kg/day in mice, 1000 mg/kg/day in rats (with highest AUC0-24 hr at 200 
mg/kg b.i.d., i.e. total daily dose of 400 mg/kg/day) and up to 600 mg/kg/day in dogs were 
administered.  
Elbasvir 
No formal acute toxicity studies have been conducted. However, consistent with ICH M3 (R2) guidance, 
acute toxicity after a single dose was assessed from the repeat-dose oral toxicity studies, where oral 
doses of elbasvir up to1000 mg/kg in mice, 1000 mg/kg b.i.d. in rats, and 1000 mg/kg in dogs were 
given. There was no evidence of acute toxicity in these species. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Grazoprevir 
Grazoprevir was investigated in a number of repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats, and dogs, 
including oral range finding studies of up to 3-months in mice, toxicity studies of up to 6 months in 
rats and 9 months in dogs. Systemic plasma exposures were unexpectedly low in the initial 1-month 
rat study. It was subsequently determined that grazoprevir, when administered in a solution, provided 
higher exposures than in suspension. As a result a 1-month rat study was repeated at doses up to the 
maximum feasible dose in solution (200 mg/kg b.i.d). Unless otherwise indicated, routine Necropsy

parameters (physical signs, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmic, and clinical pathology 
determinations; and electrocardiographic examinations in dogs only) and postmortem parameters 
(organ weights, gross observations and histomorphologic examinations) were evaluated. 
Mice 
One-Month Oral Range-Finding and Toxicokinetic Study in rasH2 Wild- Type Mice (Hybrid) 
Male and female Jic:CB6F1-nonTgrasH2@Jcl mice were given 20, 100, 200, or 500 mg/kg/day of  
grazoprevir, supplied as a spray-dried formulation. In addition to routine endpoints, Transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) examination was performed on liver slides, and grazoprevir concentrations 
in liver-gallbladder homogenate were determined. Recovery assessment was not included in this study.  
At 500 mg/kg/day, there were body weight loss in both sexes, decreases in total white blood cell and 
lymphocyte counts (-37% and -43%, respectively) in females and increases in total white blood cell, 
neutrophil, lymphocyte, and eosinophil (+63, +53, +61, +350%) counts in males, minor increases in 
red blood cell and decreases in other erythroid parameters (mean corpuscular volume, haemoglobin, 
and haemoglobin concentration), minor increases in platelet counts in both sexes, compared to 
controls. Increases in total/direct bilirubin (up to 47-fold), aspartate aminotransferase (AST; up to 2-
fold), alanine aminotransferase (ALT; up to 5-fold), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP; >2-fold), and 
minor decreases in serum total protein, albumin and globulin, and minor increases in glucose, 
phosphorus, cholesterol in both sexes, and in blood urea nitrogen in a single male, compared to 
controls. At 200 mg/kg/day decreases in total white blood cell and lymphocyte counts were seen in 
females (-41% for both parameters) and minor increases in platelet count was noted in males. Serum 
biochemical changes consisted of increase in total/direct bilirubin in both sexes (up to 8-fold), and 
minor increases in serum ALT (>2-fold), ALP (individual) and phosphorus, and minor decreases in 
serum total protein, albumin and globulin in females only, and minor increases in cholesterol in both 
sexes. At 100 mg/kg/day, test article-related changes consisted of minor decreases in total white blood 
cell and lymphocyte counts in females only, and minor increases in cholesterol in both sexes and in 
total bilirubin in 1 male. 
At 500 mg/kg/day degeneration of the renal tubular epithelium of the kidney (very slight in females 
and very slight to moderate in males), very slightly to slightly increased hepatocellular size in both 
sexes, and slight periportal hepatocellular cytoplasmic rarefaction (consistent with increased 
hepatocellular glycogen content, as confirmed by PAS staining and TEM) in females, and villous 
atrophy (mostly restricted to the duodenum; very slight in females and very slight to slight in males) 
in the small intestine, were noted. The increased hepatocellular size at 500 mg/kg/day correlated with 
increased mean liver weights and increased organ size in both sexes and with prominent lobular 
pattern in males. At 100 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day in females and at 200 mg/kg/day in males 
mean liver weight increases with very slightly to slightly increased hepatocellular size was seen in 
males at 200 mg/kg/day (of overall lower incidence and mean severity than at 500 mg/kg/day). 
Additional histomorphologic changes were observed in other tissues from animals from both sexes at 
500 mg/kg/day and in 2 males at 200 mg/kg/day, but were considered secondary to reduced general 
condition of these animals. The NOEL was considered to be 20 mg/kg/day in both sexes. However, the 
applicant argues that the changes noted at 100 mg/kg/day were limited to very slight to slight 
haematological/serum biochemical changes and increased liver weights, and are considered of minimal 
toxicological significance based on their small magnitude, the lack of impact on general condition of the 
animals, and the lack of histomorphologic correlates. The NOEL was considered to be 20 mg/kg/day in 
both sexes. The NOAEL was considered to be 100 mg/kg/day. 100 mg/kg/day provided a plasma 
systemic exposure (AUC0-24 hr = 164 µM.hr & Cmax of 40.8 µM) approximately 83X and 177X over 
the grazoprevir exposure in HCV-infected patients (100 mg), respectively.

A high inter-animal variability was observed in plasma concentrations at all doses. There were no 
substantial (i.e., greater than 2-fold) sex-related differences in mean systemic exposure (AUC0-24 hr) 
or mean Cmax at all doses. 
Three-Month Study in CD1 Mice  
Crl:CD1(ICR) mice were given 20, 100, 200, or 500 mg/kg/day of grazoprevir, supplied as a spray-
dried formulation. Recovery assessment was not included as part of this study. At 500 mg/kg/day in 
both sexes decreases in red blood cell count, and in other erythroid parameters (haemoglobin 
concentration, haematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, haemoglobin, haemoglobin concentration); and 
increases in serum glucose, ALT, and ALP (ALT and ALP >2-fold relative to controls), and moderate to 
marked increases in total/direct bilirubin (up to 32-fold relative to controls) were observed compared 
to controls. In addition at 500 mg/kg/day there were increases in white blood cell count, due to 
increases in neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, and in serum cholesterol in females, and decreased 
total body weight gain in males. At 200 mg/kg/day increases in serum ALP (<2-fold) and total bilirubin 
(up to 3-fold) were noted in both sexes, along with increased in serum ALT (<2-fold) in females; and 
increases in serum glucose in males, compared to controls. At 100 mg/kg/day increases in serum 
total/direct bilirubin were seen in males (up to 2-fold). 
At 500 mg/kg/day slight to marked degeneration of the renal tubular epithelium of the kidney, and 
very slightly to moderately increased hepatocellular size which correlated with increases in mean liver 
weights and/or increased organ size were seen in both sexes and with prominent lobular pattern in 
males. Increased hepatocellular size was associated with very slight to slight periportal hepatocellular 
cytoplasmic rarefaction was observed in the liver of females. TEM examination of livers from 2 females 
and 2 males at 500 mg/kg/day showed cytoplasmic accumulation of large amounts of glycogen in 
periportal and centrilobular hepatocytes, which was more prominent in females. In the gallbladder, 
very slight or slight focal inflammation was observed in 1 female and 1 male. At 200 mg/kg/day, very 
slight to slight increased hepatocellular size associated with, in 1 female, very slight peri-portal 
hepatocellular cytoplasmic rarefaction correlated with mean liver weight increases in both sexes.  
The NOEL was considered to be 100 mg/kg/day in females and 20 mg/kg/day in males. However, the 
Necropsy changes noted at 200 mg/kg/day (the serum biochemical changes) were considered of 
minimal toxicological significance based the small magnitude and the lack of histomorphologic 
correlates. The post-mortem changes noted at 200 mg/kg/day (very slight to slight increased 
hepatocellular size associated with very slight peri-portal hepatocellular cytoplasmic rarefaction and 
correlated with mean liver weight increases) were not considered adverse based on their slight severity 
and the lack of evidence of necrosis or inflammation. Therefore, the NOAEL was considered to be 200 
mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 hr = 820 ± 109 µM.hr). 200 mg/kg/day provided a plasma systemic exposure 
(AUC0-24 hr = 820 µM.hr) approximately 416X over the grazoprevir exposure in HCV-infected patients 
(100 mg). At 100 mg/kg/day the approximate exposure cover would be 237X.  
A high inter-animal variability was observed in plasma concentrations at all doses. There were no 
substantial sex-related differences in mean systemic exposure (AUC0-24 hr) or mean Cmax at all 
doses. Mean systemic exposure (AUC0-24 hr) and Cmax were greater than dose proportional between 
20 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, and approximately dose proportional between 100 mg/kg/day and 
500 mg/kg/day.

Rats 
One-Month Oral Toxicity Study in Rats  
Male and female Crl:WI(Han) rats were given 25, 50, or 1000 mg/kg/day of grazoprevir . There were 
no relevant effects. Recovery assessment was not included as part of this study. The NOAEL was 
considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 hr: 24.3 ± 4.09 µM.hr). There were no substantial (i.e., 
greater than 2-fold) sex-related differences in systemic exposure (AUC0-24 hr) or Cmax. Systemic 
exposure and Cmax were slightly greater than dose-proportional between 25 mg/kg/day and 50 
mg/kg/day, and were similar at 50 mg/kg/day and 1000 mg/kg/day, suggesting a saturation of 
absorption at doses greater than 50 mg/kg/day. Grazoprevir concentrations in plasma from control 
group animals at 2 hours post dose were below the LLQ of the bioanalytical method.  
One-Month Oral Toxicity Study in Rats with a 2-Week Interim Necropsy. 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential toxicity and toxicokinetic profile of grazoprevir 
when administered orally for approximately 2 weeks and 1 month. Male and female Crl:WI(Han) were 
given 50, 200 mg/kg/day, or 200 mg/kg b.i.d. (a minimum of 6 hours between the 2 daily doses) of 
grazoprevir or vehicle (dosed b.i.d.; a minimum of 6 hours between the 2 daily doses) only. 200 
mg/kg/day was the highest feasible dose in solution. Recovery assessment was not included as part of 
this study. Liver drug concentrations were also measured. There were no relevant effects. The NOAEL 
was considered to be 200 mg/kg b.i.d. (AUC0-24 hr = 212 ± 63.0 µM.hr). 
A high variability in plasma concentrations was observed at all doses and each collection day. There 
were no substantial (i.e., greater than 2-fold) sex-related differences in mean systemic exposure 
(AUC0-24 hr) or mean Cmax in Study Weeks 2 and 4 at all doses. Taking into account the inter-
individual variability, mean systemic exposure was approximately dose proportional between 50 
mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day, and mean Cmax was considered similar at 50 mg/kg/day, 200 
mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg b.i.d. Mean systemic exposure and Cmax were considered similar in Study 
Weeks 2 and 4 at 50 mg/kg/day. The apparent 2-fold difference in mean systemic exposure and mean 
Cmax was attributed to the high inter animal variability. Systemic exposure and Cmax were considered 
similar in Study Weeks 2 and 4 at 200 mg/kg b.i.d. Grazoprevir concentrations in plasma from controls 
2 hours post dose were below the LLQ of the bioanalytical method in Study Weeks 2 and 4.  
High variability in liver concentrations was observed at all doses at interim (Study Week 3) and final 
necropsies (Study Week 5). Mean liver concentrations at interim and final necropsies were considered 
similar at 50 mg/kg/day, 200 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg b.i.d. Low levels of the test substance were 
measured in liver at necropsy in 3 control animals. All concentration values for grazoprevir in the liver 
controls were less than 0.9% of the mean value at 50 mg/kg/day (low dose), in Weeks 3 and 5, 
respectively. Based on the low concentrations of the test substance observed in the liver of the control 
animals compared to the higher concentrations that were measured in the liver at 50 mg/kg/day, the 
low levels of the test substance that were observed in the control liver were not considered to have  
compromise the validity or reliability of the toxicokinetic evaluation or of the toxicity assessment. 
Six-Month Oral Toxicity Study in Rats  
Male and female Crl:WI(Han) rats were given 50 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg once daily, or 200 mg/kg twice 
daily (200 mg/kg b.i.d.) of grazoprevir. Recovery assessment was not included as part of this study.  
Individual increases in serum total bilirubin was noted in one female at 200 mg/kg/day (0.3 mg/dL vs 
up to 0.2 mg/dL in controls) and in both sexes at 200 mg/kg b.i.d. (0.3 mg/dL or 0.4 mg/dL in 4 of 15 
females, and in 2 of 15 males vs up to 0.2 mg/dL in both sexes in controls), and decreases in serum 
sodium, chloride, and potassium was seen in females at 200 mg/kg b.i.d. The clinical pathology

changes were considered of minimal toxicological significance based on their small magnitude and the 
lack of histological correlates. Focal haemorrhage in the glandular mucosa of the stomach was seen in 
males at 200 mg/kg b.i.d.  
Since the systemic exposure to grazoprevir at 200 mg/kg b.i.d. was similar in males and females and 
also similar to the systemic exposure at 200 mg/kg/day (once daily), this focal haemorrhage was 
considered due to prolonged daily direct contact of the gastric mucosa to grazoprevir administered at 
200 mg/kg twice daily. The gender difference was attributed to the heavier males received larger 
dosing volumes than females at 200 mg/kg b.i.d. In the absence of chronic changes after 6 months of 
treatment, this finding in males was considered of minimal toxicological significance. The NOAEL was 
considered to be 200 mg/kg b.i.d. (AUC0-24 hr = 445 ± 88.5 µM.hr). This dose provides an exposure 
(AUC0-24 hr = 445 µM.hr) approximately 226X over the grazoprevir exposure in HCV-infected patients 
(100 mg). 
High inter-animal variability was observed in plasma concentrations at all doses. There were no 
substantial sex-related differences in mean systemic exposure (AUC0-24 hr) or mean Cmax. In Weeks 
4, 9, and 13, between 50 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day, mean systemic exposure was approximately 
dose proportional and mean Cmax was less than dose proportional. At 200 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg 
b.i.d., mean systemic exposure and mean Cmax were similar, for the 3 collection intervals. Mean 
systemic exposure and mean Cmax were similar in Study Weeks 4, 9, and 13 for each dose group, 
suggesting that steady state is maintained until Study Week 13. Grazoprevir concentrations in plasma 
from all control animals at 2 hours post dose were below the LLQ of the bioanalytical method in Study 
Weeks 4, 9, and 13. There were no sex-related differences in mean liver concentrations at Week 27 
(final necropsy) and taking into account the high inter-animal variability, these mean concentrations 
were similar over the dose range.  
Low level of the test substance was measured in liver at necropsy in 1 control animal, and was less 
than 1% of the mean liver concentration of the low-dose group (50 mg/kg/day). Based on the low 
concentration of the test substance observed in the liver of the control animal compared to the higher 
concentrations that were measured at 50 mg/kg/day, the low level of the test substance that was 
observed in the control liver was not considered to compromise the validity or reliability of the 
toxicokinetic evaluation or of the toxicity assessment. 
Dog 
One-Month Oral Toxicity Study in Dogs  
Beagle dogs were given 5, 20, or 600 mg/kg/day of grazoprevir or vehicle only. 50 mg/kg/day was 
expected to produce toxicity based on results from the preliminary tolerability study and to result in 
systemic plasma exposure that is high multiples (>50-fold) the human exposure. Recovery assessment 
was not included as part of this study.  
Emesis, decreases in erythroid parameters (red blood cell count, haemoglobin, reticulocytes, and 
haematocrit), slight to moderate increases in total bilirubin (up to 5-fold compared to controls), and 
degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium of the testes was seen at 600 mg/kg/day. The Applicant 
goes onto say that changes were considered minimally adverse. Emesis did not impact the physical 
condition of the animals; the haematological changes were of very slight severity and did not have any 
histomorphologic correlates; the bilirubin increase although of moderate severity was not associated 
with changes in any other biomarkers of liver toxicity (AST, ALT, ALP) and did not have any 
histomorphologic correlates; the degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium of the testes noted in all 
animals at 600 mg/kg/day was of very slight to slight severity. The change was widely distributed 
throughout the testes and was characterised by exfoliation of degenerate and frequently

multinucleated spermatogenic epithelial cells into the lumen with thinning of spermatogenic epithelium, 
occasional sertoli cell vacuolation, and retained spermatids. The epididymides of affected animals had a 
corresponding increase in cellular debris and exfoliated cells within tubular lumens. There were no 
findings in the testes and epididymides in animals at 20 mg/kg/day.  The Applicant argues that these 
findings are expected to be reversible based on a literature reference (Ref. 4.3: 03RKQY] Creasy 
Dianne M. Pathogenesis of male reproductive toxicity. Toxicological Pathology 2001;29(1):64-76).  
Increases in total bilirubin in 1 male (2-fold compared to pre-test) was seen at 20 mg/kg/day and was 
considered of minimal toxicological significance based on their low amplitude, the lack of associated 
increases in any other biomarkers of hepatobiliary toxicity (AST, ALT, ALP) and the lack of 
histomorphologic correlates. The NOAEL was considered to be 20 mg/kg/day which provided a plasma 
systemic exposure (AUC0-24 hr = 497 µM.hr) which us approximately 252X over the grazoprevir 
exposure in HCV-infected patients (100 mg). 
There were no substantial (i.e., greater than 2-fold) sex-related differences in systemic exposure 
(AUC0-24 hr) or Cmax. Systemic exposure was greater than dose proportional between 5 mg/kg/day 
and 20 mg/kg/day and less than dose proportional between 20 mg/kg/day and 600 mg/kg/day on 
Study Day 1 and in Study Week 5. Cmax was approximately dose proportional between 5 mg/kg/day 
and 20 mg/kg/day and less than dose proportional between 20 mg/kg/day and 600 mg/kg/day, on 
Study Day 1 and in Study Week 5. Systemic exposure and Cmax were similar at the low and mid doses 
on Study Day 1 and in Study Week 5, suggesting that steady state toxicokinetics at these doses were 
attained within the first day of dosing and were maintained until Study Week 5. At 600 mg/kg/day 
systemic exposure and Cmax were slightly greater in Study Week 5 than on Study Day 1 suggesting 
slight accumulation probably due to slow elimination at this dose. Grazoprevir concentrations in plasma 
from all control group animals on Study Day 1 and in Study Week 5 were below the LLQ of the 
bioanalytical method. 
Nine-Month Oral Toxicity Study in Dogs with a 3-Month Interim Necropsy.  
Beagle dogs were given 5 mg/kg/day or 15 mg/kg/day for approximately 38 weeks, or 300 mg/kg/day 
followed by 100 mg/kg/day for approximately 11 and 27 weeks, respectively, of grazoprevir, or vehicle 
only. 15 mg/kg/day was expected to produce toxicity and to result in systemic plasma exposure at 
high multiples (>50-fold) of the human exposure. At 300 mg/kg/day, excessive body weight losses (up 
to -22% relative to pre-test) due to unsatisfactory food consumption/inappetence led to the sacrifice of 
2 animals (1 male and 1 female in Study Weeks 7 and 11, respectively), and to the lowering of the 
high dose to 100 mg/kg/day in Study Week 12. Recovery assessment was not included as part of this 
study. 
At 300 mg/kg/day increases in the incidence and frequency of unformed/liquid faeces (females only) 
and post-dosing emesis compared to controls; yellow discoloration of the faeces and, in a single 
animal, skin and eyes (bulbar conjunctiva); decreases in erythroid parameters and increases in 
fibrinogen and platelets; increases in serum total bilirubin (up to 11-fold compared to controls; 
predominantly direct bilirubin in the most affected animals), increases in serum ALP (<4-fold; males 
only), and minor transient decreases in serum cholesterol; and increases in urine bilirubin, were 
observed.  
Necropsy findings during the 27-week period at 100 mg/kg/day were generally similar to the findings 
noted in the first 11 weeks at 300 mg/kg/day and included increases in the incidence and frequency of 
unformed/liquid faeces (females only) and post-dosing emesis (females only), yellow discoloration of 
the faeces; body weight loss and unsatisfactory food consumption/inappetence (in a single male); 
decreases in most erythroid parameters and increases in fibrinogen and platelets; increases in serum

total bilirubin (up to 7-fold compared to controls; predominantly direct bilirubin), increases in serum 
ALP (<4-fold; males and transiently in a single female), and transient decreases in serum cholesterol 
(in a single male); and increases in urine bilirubin (in a single male). Also at 100 mg/kg/day, along 
with the decreased erythroid parameters, increase in mean erythrocyte count (males in Study Week 
38) and/or in mean or individual reticulocyte count, and the presence of nucleated erythrocytes in 
some animals were suggestive of a regenerative response. At 15 mg/kg/day, increases in serum total 
bilirubin was noted in both sexes (up to 3-fold compared to controls).  
There were gross and microscopic changes at 300 mg/kg/day (both sexes) in animals killed early in 
Study Weeks 7 and 11, respectively. Gallbladder distention with abundant bile content was noted 
grossly in both animals but did not correlate with any specific histomorphologic changes. Yellowish 
discoloration of the mucosae was also noted in the male. Histomorphologic changes in the male 
consisted of seminiferous tubule degeneration correlating grossly with pale and flaccid testes, 
pigmentation (hemosiderin) in the liver (sinusoidal cells) and bone marrow, focal inflammation of the 
duodenum, and myeloid hyperplasia in the bone marrow. Pigmentation (hemosiderin) was seen in the 
bone marrow. At 300/100-mg/kg/day distended gallbladder with abundant bile content was seen in all 
dogs. In addition, 2 of 3 males at this dose had yellowish discoloration of the gingival mucosae and 
white adipose tissue and/or the aorta (without any specific histomorphologic correlate in the tissues 
examined).  
Mean liver weights (without a specific histomorphological correlate) were increased in both sexes at 
300/100 mg/kg/day only, and dose-dependent decreases in mean testicular weights at was seen ≥15 
mg/kg/day. There were histomorphologic changes in the liver, the gallbladder and the testes at ≥15 
mg/kg/day, and the spleen, bone marrow, and the epididymides at 300/100 mg/kg/day (see later 
text). In the liver, there was very slight to slight pigmentation in sinusoidal cells (hemosiderin) in both 
sexes at 300/100 mg/kg/day only. Very slight microlithiasis was noted occasionally in the lumina of 
larger bile ducts at ≥15 mg/kg/day. Very slight microlithiasis was also observed in the lumen of the 
gallbladder in both sexes at 300/100 mg/kg/day and in 1 female at 15 mg/kg/day. Both in the bile 
ducts and in the gallbladder, the luminal microlithiasis was not associated with any alteration of the 
tissues. At 300/100 mg/kg/day, there was increased pigmentation (hemosiderin) in the spleen in 
males, whereas increased extramedullary erythropoiesis was observed in both sexes. Hyperplasia of 
the erythroid lineage was observed in the bone marrow from a single male at 300/100 mg/kg/day. 
There was degeneration of testicular seminiferous tubules at ≥15 mg/kg/day that was dose-dependent 
in incidence and grade (very slight in 1 male at 15 mg/kg/day; moderate to marked in 3 males at the 
300/100 mg/kg/day), correlated with decreases in testicular weights, and at higher grades coincident 
with decreased amounts of sperm in the lumina of the otherwise unaltered epididymidal ducts.  
The mean liver grazoprevir concentrations (sexes combined) were 4.82 µM at 5 mg/kg/day at the 3-
month interim necropsy, and 6.14, 39.3, and 136 µM at 5, 15, and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, at 
the final necropsy. Liver grazoprevir concentrations in control animals were below the LLQ. 
In the 2 animals that were killed early at 300 mg/kg/day, the individual toxicokinetic parameters 
following the last administration of grazoprevir in Study Week 7 or 11 were comparable to those 
obtained in surviving animals at this dose level (AUC0-24 hr of 3610/3240 µM.hr, Cmax of 171/149 
µM, and Tmax of 4.0/8.0 hr in the male/female, respectively). At the time of sacrifice, the individual 
liver grazoprevir concentrations were 363/356 µM in the male/female, respectively. 
High inter-animal variability was observed at 100 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day. There were no 
substantial sex-related differences in mean systemic exposure (AUC0-24 hr) and in mean Cmax 
values. On Day 1 and in Weeks 4 and 12, mean systemic exposure was greater than dose proportional 
between 5 mg/kg/day and 15 mg/kg/day, and mean Cmax was approximately dose proportional. On 
Assessment report

Day 1 and in Week 12, mean systemic exposure and mean Cmax were less than dose proportional 
between 15 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day. Mean systemic exposure and mean Cmax were similar on 
Day 1 and in Weeks 4 and 12 at 5 mg/kg/day and 15 mg/kg/day, and on Day 1 and in Weeks 3 and 12 
at 300 mg/kg/day, suggesting that steady state in toxicokinetics was attained on Study Day 1. Mean 
systemic exposure and mean Cmax values at 100 mg/kg/day were similar in Study Weeks 16 and 26, 
and similar to the values obtained at 300 mg/kg/day. 
All grazoprevir concentrations in plasma from control group animals were below the LLQ (LLQ = 
0.013/0.014 µM) on Study Day 1 and in Study Weeks 4 and 12. There were no substantial (i.e., 
greater than 2-fold) sex-related differences in mean liver concentrations. The mean liver 
concentrations at 5 mg/kg/day in Study Weeks 14 and 39 (interim and final necropsy, respectively) 
were similar. In Study Week 39, the mean liver concentration at 100 mg/kg/day was approximately 3-
fold greater than the mean liver concentration at 15 mg/kg/day, which was approximately 6-fold 
greater than the mean liver concentration at 5 mg/kg/day. All grazoprevir concentrations in liver from 
control group animals were below the LLQ (LLQ = 0.104 µM) in Study Week 39. 
Based on these results, the NOEL was considered to be 5 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 hr = 69.3 ± 6.0 
µM.hr). The Applicant goes onto say that at 15 mg/kg/day, the bilirubin increase was of slight severity, 
had not progressed with treatment duration, was not associated with changes in any other biomarkers 
of hepatobiliary toxicity (AST, ALT, ALP increases) and did not correlate with histomophologic changes. 
The lumen microlithiasis in the gallbladder and larger bile ducts was considered of minimal toxicological 
significance based the very slight severity and the lack of histomorphologic changes in the gallbladder 
or liver. Once again the Applicant argues that the degeneration of the testicular seminiferous tubules 
characterised by loss of germ cell population confined to postspermatogonial cell types was also 
considered of minimal toxicological significance, based on its very slight severity, and expected 
reversibility (Ref. 4.3: 03RKQY Creasy Dianne M. Pathogenesis of male reproductive toxicity. 
Toxicological Pathology 2001;29(1):64-76). See over-all Assessor toxicology comments on recovery. 
Therefore, the NOAEL was considered to be 15 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 hr = 367± 65.0 µM.hr), which 
provides a systemic plasma exposure (AUC0-24 hr = 367 µM.hr) approximately 186X over the 
grazoprevir exposure in HCV-infected patients (100 mg). There were no test article-related changes at 
5 mg/kg/day. This dose provides a systemic plasma exposure (AUC0-24 hr = 69.3 µM.hr) 
approximately 35X over the grazoprevir exposure in HCV- 
Elbasvir 
Elbasvir was investigated in a number of repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs of duration up to 
6 months and 9 months, respectively. Additionally, a 1-month range-finding study in rasH2 wild-type 
mice was conducted to support dose selection for a potential short-term carcinogenicity study in rasH2 
transgenic mice. The high dose was generally the limit dose according to ICH M3 (R2) guidance, 1000 
mg/kg/day. Routine antemortem parameters were measured.  
Rodent 
One-Month Oral Range-Finding and Toxicokinetic Study in rasH2 Wild-Type Mice. 
Jic:CB6F1-nonTgrasH2@jcl mice were given 10, 50, 300, and 1000 mg/kg/day elbasvir and 1 control 
group of 10/5 females and 10/5 males that received the vehicle only. There were no effects. The NOEL 
was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 hr 151 ±15.1 µM.hr) approximately 63X over the 
human exposure in HCV-infected patients (50 mg). 
There were no substantial sex-related differences in mean systemic exposure (AUC0-24 hr) or mean 
Cmax at all doses. Mean systemic exposure and Cmax were approximately dose-proportional between 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016

10 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day, and less than dose-proportional across 50, 300, and 1000 
mg/kg/day. In vitro, in mouse hepatocytes, only M2 was detected. In general, there were no 
substantial sex-related differences in mean liver concentrations at 4, 8, and 24 hours post dose, except 
at 1000 mg/kg/day at 24 hours where mean liver level was approximately 11.5-fold greater in males 
(correlated with approximately 21-fold greater mean 24-hour plasma level in males due to slower 
elimination), and the mean concentrations increased with the dose. 
Fourteen-Day Oral Toxicity Study in Rats with Micronucleus and Functional Observational 
Battery Assays  
Crl:WI(Han) rats were given 100 mg/kg/day, 300 mg/kg/day, or 1000 mg/kg b.i.d. (total daily dose: 
2000 mg/kg) or vehicle  only. In addition to routine endpoints, a FOB assay was performed after the 
first dose in male rats, a micronucleus assay was performed in both sexes (see Section 4.3) and liver 
elbasvir concentrations were determined in samples at all doses. At 1000 mg/kg b.i.d. white 
discoloration of the faeces (thought, most likely due to the faecal elimination of non-absorbed test 
article). Compared to controls, decreases in body weight gain (-19% and -25% in females and males, 
respectively) with transient decreased food consumption in both sexes, and increases in neutrophils 
(slight; +60%) in females only and serum cholesterol (very slight, +36%) in males only, were noted. 
At 300 mg/kg/day decreased body weight gain (-14%) and increase in neutrophils (+71%) in males 
only were seen. Overall, these antemortem changes were considered minimal, without a 
histomorphologic correlate and so were of minimal toxicological significance. There were no test 
article-related postmortem findings. There were no test article-related variations in the FOB 
parameters. Based on these results, the NOEL was considered to be 300 mg/kg/day in females and 
100 mg/kg/day in males. However, the changes observed in the study were considered of minimal 
toxicological significance and so the NOAEL was considered to be 1000 mg/kg administered twice daily 
(AUC0-24 hr: 21.3 ± 2.15 μM.hr), approximately 9X over the elbasvir exposure in HCV-infected 
patients (50 mg). 
There were no substantial sex-related differences in mean systemic exposure (AUC0-24 hr) or mean 
Cmax at 300 mg/kg/day and 1000 mg/kg b.i.d. Mean systemic exposure and Cmax were less than 
dose proportional between 300 mg/kg/day and 1000 mg/kg b.i.d. Mean elbasvir liver concentrations 
increased in a less than dose-proportional manner between 100 mg/kg/day and 1000 mg/kg b.i.d. 
Three-Month Oral Toxicity Study in Rats 
Crl:WI(Han) rats were given 50, 300, or 1000 mg/kg/day of elbasvir or vehicle only. Transient post 
dosing salivation was noted females at ≥300 mg/kg/day and in males at all doses. Due to the minimal 
and transient nature of this change generally observed immediately post dose, it was considered to be 
a palatability issue rather than a centrally-mediated effect of the compound and consequently of 
minimal toxicological significance. There were no effects on gross observations, organ weight, or 
histomorphologic changes. The NOAEL was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 hr 17.3 ± 1.23 
µM.hr). 
There were generally no substantial sex-related differences in mean systemic exposure (AUC0-24 hr) 
or mean Cmax at all doses. Mean systemic exposure and Cmax were less than dose-proportional 
across all doses. Mean elbasvir liver concentrations were similar in females and males at all doses, and 
increased in a dose related manner. 
Six-Month Oral Toxicity Study in Rats  
Crl:WI(Han) rats were given 30, 300, or 1000 mg/kg/day of elbasvir or vehicle only. Antemortem 
changes were observed at all doses. In both sexes salivation, very slight to slight (non-dose related) 
Assessment report

increases in urine volume (up to +71%) generally with very slight decreases in urine specific gravity 
(up to -1.2%), were observed. In addition, in males at ≥300 mg/kg/day decreased body weight gain 
(up to -17% at 1000 mg/kg/day) associated with occasional decreased food consumption was noted. 
This had no impact on the physical condition of the animals. Based on their nature and in the absence 
of correlating histomorphological changes, these findings were considered of minimal toxicological 
significance. The NOEL was considered to be 30 mg/kg/day. However, the changes noted were of 
minimal toxicological significance, and so the NOAEL was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 
hr: 21.9 ± 1.16 µM.hr) approximately 9X over the elbasvir exposure in HCV-infected patients (50 mg). 
Mean systemic exposure and Cmax were less than dose-proportional across all doses. Mean elbasvir 
liver concentrations were approximately 2- to 3.4-fold greater in males than in females at all doses, 
and increased in a dose related manner. Additionally, the toxicokinetic parameters were comparable to 
previous studies, when similar doses were compared. 
Dog 
One-Month Oral Toxicity Study in Dogs with a Three-Month Treatment-Free Period 
Female beagle dogs were given 1000 mg/kg/day of elbasvir. Six elbasvir-treated dogs were necropsied 
following an approximately 3-month treatment-free period. Originally, a 6-month treatment-free 
period was scheduled in the study. However, elbasvir-related changes observed after the 1-month 
dosing period had resolved following the 3-month treatment-free period, and the 6 remaining elbasvir-
treated dogs originally planned to be necropsied following the 6-month treatment-free period were 
returned to the animal colony without post-mortem examinations.  
White discoloration of the faeces, emesis, and body weight loss was noted during the dosing period. 
Decreased skin turgor and/or thin appearance were observed in 2 animals and this correlated with the 
body weight loss. These ante-mortem changes were limited to the 1-month dosing period, and 
resolved in the 3-month treatment-free period. Postmortem changes noted at the end of the 1-month 
dosing period consisted of vacuolation in the gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissues of the small 
intestine (Peyer’s patches) and large intestine, as well as in the spleen and/or lymph nodes. The 
changes characterised by the presence of an increased number of large vacuolated macrophages, most 
prominent within the follicular areas of the lymphoid tissues and ultrastructurally by the presence of an 
increased number of lysosomes containing myelin figures in affected macrophages were consistent 
with phospholipidosis. There were no postmortem findings noted at necropsy, histormorphological or 
TEM examination at the end of the 3-month treatment-free period, indicating reversibility of the 
elbasvir-related phospholipidosis.  
Three-Month Oral Toxicity Study in Dogs  
Beagle dogs were given 2, 25, or 1000 mg/kg/day of elbasvir or vehicle only. White/pale brown 
discoloration of the faeces in all animals at 1000 mg/kg/day, most likely due to the fecal elimination of 
non-absorbed test article. 
There were no gross observations or organ weight changes. An increased number of large vacuolated 
macrophages in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue of the small intestine (Peyer’s patches) and/or 
large intestine, lymph nodes, and/or spleen in females and males at 1000 mg/kg/day and in 1 male at 
25 mg/kg/day, were observed. The vacuolation was ultrastructurally consistent with lysosomal 
phospholipid accumulation (phospholipidosis). The severity of these changes ranged from very slight to 
slight at 1000 mg/kg/day and was very slight in males at 25 mg/kg/day. The applicant stated the 
vacuolation observed, was not associated with any other effects in the lymphoid tissues and in 
particular not with lymphoid depletion or inflammation/necrosis, or with any haematological changes

(i.e., no decreased white blood cell or lymphocyte counts, no abnormal circulating blood cells). 
Therefore, based on the very slight to slight severity, the absence of other effects in the lymphoid 
tissue or in circulating blood cells, this histomorphologic finding was considered of minimal toxicological 
significance. Elbasvir-related phospholipidosis was shown to be reversible in a 1-month oral toxicity 
study in dogs with a 3-month treatment-free period (see above). Based on these results, the NOEL 
was considered to be 2 mg/kg/day. The changes noted in the study were of minimal toxicological 
significance and the NOAEL was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 hr: 19.3 ± 2.19 µM.hr) 
approximately 7X over the elbasvir exposure in HCV-infected patients (50 mg).  
There were generally no substantial sex-related differences in mean systemic exposure (AUC0-24 hr) 
or mean Cmax. Mean systemic exposure was greater than dose-proportional between 2 and 25 
mg/kg/day and less than dose-proportional between 25 and 1000 mg/kg/day while mean Cmax was 
approximately dose-proportional between 2 and 25 mg/kg/day and less than dose-proportional 
between 25 and 1000 mg/kg/day. Mean systemic exposure and Cmax were not substantially different 
on Study Day 1 and in Study Weeks 5 and 13, suggesting that steady state toxicokinetics were 
attained after the first dose. All elbasvir liver concentrations were below the LLQ at 2 mg/kg/day. Mean 
elbasvir liver concentrations at 25 and 1000 mg/kg/day were greater in males than in females, and 
increased as the dose increased. 
Nine-Month Oral Toxicity Study in Dogs  
Beagle dogs were given 5, 25, or 1000 mg/kg/day of elbasvir or vehicle only. At 1000 mg/kg/day 
sporadic emesis, frequent discoloration of faeces and occasional presence of substance in pan (mainly 
white or pale brown for both observations and most likely due to presence of test article in faces) were 
noted. At the beginning of the study, transient or intermittent body weight losses, and occasional 
decreases in food consumption was seen. The applicant goes onto say that these changes had no 
major impact on the general condition of the animals, no histomorphological correlated and are 
considered of minimal toxicological significance. 
There were no test article-related changes in clinical pathology parameters or at in 
electrocardiographic and ophthalmologic examinations. 
In both sexes vacuolation was observed at 1000 mg/kg/day (8/8 dogs; generally very slight to slight) 
and 25 mg/kg/day (2/8 dogs; very slight). The applicant goes onto say that the vacuolation was 
generally observed in the follicular areas of the lymphoid tissues, in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue 
of the stomach, small intestine (Peyer's patches), large intestine, in solitary lymphoid follicle in the 
gallbladder and/or in lymph nodes. The nature and severity of the changes (previously shown to be 
ultrastructurally consistent with phospholipidosis) were generally comparable to those previously 
observed in dogs following administration of elbasvir during 3 months indicating no progression of this 
finding with longer duration of dosing. No other effects were seen, in particular no lymphoid depletion, 
were observed in the lymphoid tissue. Therefore, similarly to the 3-month toxicity study, these 
histological findings are considered of minimal toxicological significance. Based on these findings, the 
NOEL was considered to be 5 mg/kg/day. However, the changes noted in this study are of minimal 
toxicological significance, and the NOAEL was therefore considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 
hr: 16.6 ± 3.06 μM.hr) approximately 7X over the elbasvir exposure in HCV-infected patients (50 mg). 
There were generally no substantial sex-related differences in mean systemic exposure (AUC0-24 hr) 
or mean Cmax at all doses. Mean systemic exposure and mean Cmax were approximately dose-
proportional between 5 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day and less than dose-proportional between 25 
mg/kg/day and 1000 mg/kg/day. Generally, mean systemic exposure and Cmax were not substantially

different on Study Day 1 and in Study Weeks 4, 13, and 26 at all doses, suggesting that steady state 
toxicokinetics were attained after the first dose. 
Genotoxicity 
Grazoprevir 
Grazoprevir was not genotoxic in the microbial mutagenesis assay and was negative in the 
chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. The top concentrations used in these 
studies were the limit concentration or limited by cytotoxicity, respectively.  
Grazoprevir was negative in the in vivo micronucleus assay in rats up to the limit dose of 1000 
mg/kg/day  and up to the dose resulting in the maximum achievable exposure, 200 mg/kg b.i.d., total 
daily dose, 400 mg/kg/day . 400 mg/kg/day provides a plasma systemic exposure (AUC0-24 hr = 212 
µM.hr) 108X over the grazoprevir exposure in HCV-infected patients (100 mg). 
Elbasvir 
Elbasvir was not genotoxic in the microbial mutagenesis assay, and was negative in the assay for 
chromosomal aberrations in Chinese Hamster ovary cells and in an exploratory assay for micronucleus 
induction in Chinese Hamster ovary cells. The top concentrations used in these studies were the limit 
concentration or limited by solubility.  
Elbasvir was negative in in vivo micronucleus assays in rats up to 1000 mg/kg b.i.d. (total daily dose: 
2000 mg/kg). The high dose was the limit dose, 1000 mg/kg administered twice daily. 
Carcinogenicity 
In accordance with ICH S1A guidance, carcinogenicity studies were not conducted given that the 
human use of grazoprevir and elbasvir and  is less than 6 months in duration and that there is an 
absence of a genotoxic signal in the battery of genotoxicity studies and no evidence of a proliferative 
signal in the chronic toxicity studies. The CHMP considered this as acceptable.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Studies were conducted to determine the developmental and reproductive effects of grazoprevir in rats 
and rabbits. An IV formulation was developed for the rabbit embryo-fetal developmental study as no 
oral formulations achieved reproducible systemic plasma exposures at multiples of human exposure. 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
Grazoprevir 
An oral fertility study in sexually mature female and male rats was performed at doses up to 200 
mg/kg b.i.d., dose resulting in the highest achievable exposure.  
There were no effects on female and male fertility parameters and in general toxicity parameters and 
the NOEL for both female and male fertility parameters and general toxicity parameters was 
considered to be 200 mg/kg b.i.d. (total daily dose: 400 mg/kg/day). Based on these findings, the 
NOEL for female/male fertility parameters in rats and for general toxicity parameters in female and 
male rats was 200 mg/kg b.i.d. (AUC0-24 hr = 212 ±63.0 µM.hr based on Study Week 4 toxicokinetic 
parameters from the 1-month oral toxicity study in rats.

Embryo-fœtal development 
Grazoprevir  
An oral developmental toxicity study in rats with prenatal evaluation was performed at doses up to 200 
mg/kg b.i.d. (total daily dose: 400 mg/kg/day), dose resulting in the highest achievable systemic 
plasma exposure. There was no test article-related maternal or developmental toxicity and the NOEL 
for both maternal and developmental toxicity was 200 mg/kg b.i.d. This dose provides a plasma 
systemic exposure (AUC0-24 hr = 217 µM.hr) approximately 110X over the grazoprevir exposure in 
HCV-infected patients (100 mg). 
In a preliminary oral developmental toxicity study in rabbits, pregnant rabbits were given grazoprevir 
at doses of 50 mg/kg/day, 200 mg/kg/day, 200 mg/kg/b.i.d. (total daily dose: 400 mg/kg). The 
exposure was limited to 3.61 µM.hr, and according to the Applicant, excessive vehicle-related toxicities 
were observed in the control and at 200-mg/kg/b.i.d, due to total volume of PEG administered (2 
mL/kg/day).  
As a consequence, an intravenous nanosuspension was developed for the studies in rabbits. In a 
preliminary intravenous developmental toxicity study, dose limiting maternal toxicity was achieved at 
the 200 mg/kg/day with mortality of 2 dams and discontinuation of this dose-group .  
In the definitive intravenous developmental rabbit (Dutch Belted) toxicity study, animals were given 
25, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day nanosuspension of grazoprevir or vehicle only by IV injection. The 
incidence of foetuses with a cervical rib at 100 mg/kg/day group was slightly above the highest 
historical control group incidence (litter mean of 2.9% [3 foetuses in 1 litter] and 1%, respectively). 
The Applicant argued that due to this low incidence and no other effects on skeletal morphology, this 
finding was considered non-test article-related. 
The maternal and developmental NOEL was considered to be 100 mg/kg/day. This dose provides a 
plasma systemic exposure (AUC0-24 hr = 76.1 µM.hr) approximately 39X over the grazoprevir 
exposure in HCV-infected patients (100 mg). The exposure cover over the clinical exposure (100 mg) 
at 50 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 hr = 24.4) is approximately 12x, which is an acceptable safety margin.  
On GD 15, mean systemic exposure (AUC0-24 hr) was greater than dose proportional between 25 
mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day and, mean Cmax was greater than dose proportional between 25 
mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day and approximately dose proportional between 50 mg/kg/day and 100 
mg/kg/day. 
Elbasvir 
Oral Fertility Study in Female and Male Rats  
The potential effects of elbasvir on the fertility of F0 female and male rats were evaluated following 
once daily oral administration for 15 days prior to cohabitation, during cohabitation, and through GD 7 
for the females or until the day prior to scheduled sacrifice (approximately 6 weeks total) for the 
males. Crl:WI(Han) sexually mature rats were assigned to 4 groups of 20 rats per sex each that 
received 50, 300, or 1000 mg/kg/day of elbasvir or vehicle only. At 300, or 1000 mg/kg/day there 
were transient decreases in bodyweight and food consumption.  Decreased sperm count per gram 
cauda epididymis was seen at 1000 mg/kg/day (14% below controls); however, there were no effects 
on reproductive parameters as assessed by mating performance, fertility, embryonic/fetal survival, 
mean testicular weight, and sperm motility. There was no reproductive toxicity at 1000 mg/kg/day in 
females or animals of both sexes at 50 and 300 mg/kg/day.  
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 48/151 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on these findings, the NOEL for female fertility parameters was considered to be 1000 
mg/kg/day. The NOEL for male fertility parameters was considered to be 300 mg/kg/day, based on the 
slight decrease in mean sperm count. Given the lack of any coincident effects on reproductive 
performance as assessed by mating performance, fertility, and embryonic/foetal survival, mean 
testicular weight, and sperm motility and of any histomorphological testicular changes in the chronic 
rat toxicity study (Study number: TT 12-6033) and also in the chronic dog toxicity study (Study 
number TT 12-6030), this finding was not considered adverse and the NOAEL for female/male fertility 
parameters was therefore considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 hr: 17.3 ± 1.23 µM.hr, 
measured at Study Week 13 in the 3-month oral toxicity study in rats (study number: TT 11-6024), 
approximately 7X over the human exposure in HCV-infected patients (50 mg), respectively. The NOEL 
for general toxicity parameters was 50 mg/kg/day both sexes. However, the changes in general 
toxicity parameters were considered of minimal toxicological significance and the so the NOAEL was 
considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day. 
Oral Embryo-Fetal Developmental Toxicity and Toxicokinetic Study in Rats  
From GD 6 through 20, females were given 50, 300, or 1000 mg/kg/day of elbasvir or vehicle only. At 
1000 mg/kg/day a decrease in mean maternal body weight gain from GD 6 to 21 was noted (13% 
below controls), and from GD 6 to 21 adjusted for total foetal weight (19% below control). Based on 
its low severity, this decrease in maternal body weight is considered of minimal toxicological 
significance. There were no other effects. The NOEL for maternal toxicity was considered to be 300 
mg/kg/day. However, the maternal changes noted in the study were of minimal toxicological 
significance and the NOAEL for maternal toxicity was considered to be1000 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for 
developmental toxicity was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 hr: 21.8 ± 1.79 µM.hr) 
approximately 9X over the human exposure in HCV-infected patients (50 mg). 
Mean systemic exposure (AUC0-24 hr) and Cmax were less than dose proportional across all doses. 
Additionally, mean AUC0-24 hr and Cmax in pregnant rats were consistent with those achieved in non-
pregnant rats at the same doses. 
Oral Embryo-Foetal Developmental Toxicity and Toxicokinetic Study in Rabbits 
The potential developmental toxicity of elbasvir was evaluated in rabbits following oral administration 
from GD 7 through 20.From GD 7 through 20, females were given 30, 100, or 1000 mg/kg/day of 
elbasvir , or vehicle only. There were no effects.  Mean systemic exposure (AUC0-24 hr) was 
approximately dose-proportional across the 3 doses, while mean Cmax was less than dose-
proportional. The NOEL for both maternal and developmental toxicity was considered to be 1000 
mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 hr: 39.4 ± 9.20 µM.hr) approximately 17X over the human exposure in HCV-
infected patients (50 mg). 
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
Grazoprevir 
The potential effects of grazoprevir on development, growth, behaviour, reproductive performance, 
and fertility of F1 generation in Crl:WI(Han) rats following oral administration of 25, 100, or 200 
mg/kg b.i.d. (total daily dose: 400 mg/kg) to F0 females were evaluated . There were no changes in 
the F0 and F1 generation (postimplantation survival, pup external morphology, mortality, clinical signs, 
body weights, developmental signs (vaginal opening and preputial separation), behavioural tests 
(passive avoidance, auditory startle habituation, open-field motor activity), reproductive performance, 
or fertility) at any dose and the NOEL for both maternal toxicity in the F0 generation and 
developmental toxicity in the F1 generation was considered to be 200 mg/kg b.i.d. The highest mean

maternal plasma systemic exposure achieved at 100 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 hr = 155 µM.hr) represents 
approximately 79X the human exposure in HCV-infected patients (100 mg).  
Elbasvir 
Oral Pre- and Postnatal Developmental Toxicity Study in Rats 
The potential effects of elbasvir on development, growth, behaviour, reproductive performance, and 
fertility of the F1 generation following oral administration to F0 female rats from GD 6 through LD 20 
were evaluated. From GD 6 through LD 20, females were given  50, 300 or 1000 mg/kg/day of 
elbasvir or vehicle only once daily by oral gavage.  
There were no test article-related deaths or clinical signs in the F0 or F1 generations at any dose. In 
the F0 generation, there were no gross observations. At 1000 mg/kg/day, there were transient 
decreases in mean maternal body weight gain between GD 6 and 8 (47% below control) and mean 
food consumption on GD 8 (13% below control). There were no effects on body weights or food 
consumption at 50 or 300 mg/kg/day.  In the F1 generation, there were no effects on post-
implantation survival, pup external morphology, clinical signs, body weights, developmental signs 
(vaginal opening and preputial separation), behavioural tests (passive avoidance, auditory startle 
habituation, open-field motor activity), reproductive performance, or fertility at any doses.  
The NOEL for maternal toxicity in the F0 generation was considered to be300 mg/kg/day; however, the 
changes noted in the F0 generation were not considered adverse and so the NOAEL was considered to 
be 1000 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 hr: 21.8 ± 1.79 μM.hr, measured in the oral embryo-fetal 
developmental toxicity and toxicokinetic study in rats approximately 9X over the human exposure in 
HCV-infected patients (50 mg). In the F1 generation, there were no effects on development, growth, 
behaviour, reproductive performance, or fertility, so the NOEL for developmental toxicity in the F1 
generation was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day.  
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance studies (bovine corneal opacity and permeability assay (BCOP) and acute dermal 
irritation/corrosion study in rabbits) were conducted. In a bovine corneal opacity and permeability 
assay, grazoprevir and elbasvir were classified as a non-irritant. Grazoprevir and elbasvir were not 
dermal irritants in New Zealand White Rabbits.   
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Grazoprevir 
There were no observations or changes considered to be due to potential antigenicity induced by 
grazoprevir or elbasvir in the routine repeat-dose toxicity studies. Therefore, no antigenicity 
evaluations were conducted. 
Immunotoxicity 
The Applicant states that there were no indications of immunotoxic potential as outlined in Section 
2.1.1 of the ICH guideline Immunotoxicity Studies for Human Pharmaceuticals (S8, Step 4), such as 
notable haematological changes (i.e. in leucocytes or lymphocytes), alterations in organ weight and/or 
histology of the spleen, thymus, lymph nodes or bone marrow, changes in serum globulins indicative 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016

changes in serum immunoglobulins, increased incidence of infections, or increased occurrence of 
tumours. As stated in Section 2.2, Weight of Evidence Review, the triggers for additional 
immunotoxicity studies would be a finding of significant magnitude in a single area or findings from 
two or more factors. Since the toxicity studies conducted with elbasvir / grazoprevir in rats and dogs 
lacked triggers of immunotoxicity or any findings indicating immunotoxic potential, additional studies 
were not conducted.  
A Local Lymph Node Assay in Mice (LLNA) in mice was conducted in support of the occupational safety 
program. In this study, elbasvir did not cause dermal irritation and was not a dermal sensitizer.  
Dependence 
The results of the QWBA in non-pigmented and pigmented rats following single oral administration of 
[14C]-grazoprevir at 50 mg/kg and elbasvir demonstrated that they does not readily cross the blood 
brain barrier. Additionally, there was no indication that they have a pharmacologic profile, including 
off-target profile, consistent with drug abuse liability potential, and there was no evidence in the 
routine repeat dose toxicity studies of psychoactive effects (i.e., sedative or stimulant effects). As 
such, no animal abuse potential studies were conducted. 
Metabolites 
Grazoprevir 
No circulating metabolites were detectable in human plasma. Therefore, the ICH M3 (R2) guidance 
requirements relative to metabolite safety assessment have been met with grazoprevir and no studies 
were conducted with any individual metabolites. Additionally, all metabolites of grazoprevir that were 
present in the human excreta are also formed in rats, rabbits or dogs, with the exception of a minor 
(4% of the dose) metabolite, M14, detected in human faeces only. This minor metabolite M14 is 
proposed to be a hydroxylated product of the metabolite M5, which was found in rat bile and faeces 
and rabbit faeces. 
Elbasvir 
No circulating metabolites were detectable in human plasma and all human metabolites of elbasvir 
(identified in vitro in liver microsomes or present in the excreta) are also formed in rats or dogs. No 
further studies were conducted.  
Studies on impurities 
Grazoprevir and Elbasvir 
No nonclinical studies were conducted with any individual impurities. All impurities were qualified by 
the presence in batches evaluated in the nonclinical toxicity studies or by levels allowable under ICH 
guideline Impurities in New Drug Substances [ICH Q3A (R2)]. Additionally, impurities have been 
assessed for potential mutagenicity according to ICH M7 guidance. 
Phototoxicity 
Due to grazoprevir light absorbance in the 290 to 700 nm range, a phototoxicity study was conducted 
in pigmented rats at 50 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg b.i.d. There were no findings in the eyes and/or 
skin indicating that grazoprevir does not pose a risk for phototoxicity.

Due to elbasvir light absorbance in the 290 to 700 nm range, a phototoxicity study was conducted in 
pigmented rats at 100 mg/kg/day and 1000 mg/kg/day. There were no findings in the eyes and/or 
skin indicating that elbasvir does not pose a risk for phototoxicity. 
Combination Toxicity Studies 
Beagle dogs given elbasvir  as a 25-mg/kg/day formulation  and/or grazoprevir  as a 5-mg/kg/day 
formulation, as follows: grazoprevirfollowed by elbasvir; grazoprevir followed by elbasvir vehicle; 
grazoprevir vehicle followed by elbasvir. The fourth group was given grazoprevir vehicle followed by 
elbasvir vehicle. Mortality, clinical observations, body weights, food consumption, electrocardiographic 
and ophthalmology examinations, and clinical and anatomic pathology evaluations were conducted. 
Elbasvir and/or grazoprevir concentrations in plasma and liver homogenate were determined. 
There were no ante-mortem changes. In females lymphoid tissue vacuolation was observed in the 
lymph nodes and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue of the small (Peyer's patches) and/or large 
intestine at 25/5-mg/kg/day elbasvir/grazoprevir and at 25/0-mg/kg/day elbasvir/grazoprevir and was 
attributed to elbasvir administration 
In females lymphoid tissue vacuolation was observed in the lymph nodes and the gut-associated 
lymphoid tissue of the small (Peyer's patches) and/or large intestine at 25/5-mg/kg/day 
elbasvir/grazoprevir and at 25/0-mg/kg/day elbasvir/grazoprevir and was attributed to elbasvir 
administration. These changes were morphologically consistent with phospholipidosis, and were 
consistent with findings noted in toxicity studies conducted in dogs with elbasvir. This finding was 
considered of minimal toxicological significance based its low severity (Study number TT 14-1031) and 
the lack of other effects in the lymphoid tissue (i.e., no lymphoid depletion) and of haematological 
changes. Additionally, the elbasvir-related phospholipidosis was shown to be reversible in a 1-month 
oral toxicity in dogs with a 3-month treatment-free recovery period (Study number: TT 14-1031). 
There was no evidence of a toxicologically significant difference in the post-mortem results when 
elbasvir and grazoprevir were combined in this study. The NOAEL for the elbasvir / grazoprevir 
combination was considered to be 5/25 mg/kg/day (approximately 31/3X in HCV-infected patients, 
100 mg) 
There was no evidence of interaction on the toxicokinetic profiles of each compound as mean systemic 
exposures and mean Cmax of elbasvir and grazoprevir were similar at all doses. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Grazoprevir 
For grazoprevir, a slight risk to the sediment compartment cannot be ruled out. After refinement using 
Simpletreat, the PEC/PNEC was marginally above 1.  
Elbasvir 
For elbasvir, the risk to the sediment compartment has not been fully evaluated. The Applicant is has 
committed to refine the PECSW using the outcome of the ready biodegradability study (OECD 301) as 
input for Simpletreat instead of the outcome of the OECD 314 study. The study on aerobic and 
anaerobic transformation in soil (OECD 307) revealed a DT50 > 1,000 days in soil. Based on the 
results of the provided OECD 307 study elbasvir should be classified as very persistent in soil.

Grazoprevir and elbasvir were investigated as monotherapies in nonclinical toxicity studies including a 
battery of in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity studies; repeat-dose oral toxicity studies of up to 1-
month (elbasvir) or 3-months (grazoprevir) in mouse, 6 months in rats, and 9 months in dogs; and a 
series of developmental and reproductive toxicity studies. A 1-month oral grazoprevir/elbasvir 
combination dog toxicity study was conducted. Overall, the nonclinical monotherapy programs did not 
reveal any overlapping toxicity between grazoprevir and elbasvir and there was no evidence of 
interaction on the toxicological or toxicokinetic profiles of each compound when they were co-
administered in dogs. 
Safety margins have been calculated using data from clinical protocols PN060, PN061, and PN068 
(pooled geometric mean steady state AUC0-24 hr) are 1.97 µM.hr and 2.38 µM.hr, respectively; 
corresponding Cmax values are 0.23 µM and 0.15 µM. 
In the reproductive toxicity studies in rats conducted up to 200 mg/kg b.i.d., there were no changes in 
female and male fertility parameters for Grazoprevir (approximately 108X over the grazoprevir 
exposure in HCV-infected patients (100 mg)). In addition teratogenicity was not observed in pregnant 
rats or rabbits administered grazoprevir during the period of organogenesis. In the definitive IV 
developmental rabbit toxicity study conducted at 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day, the maternal and 
developmental no-observed-effect level (NOEL) was ≥ 100 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 hr = 76.1 µM.hr 
represents approximately 39X grazoprevir exposure in HCV-infected patients). In the developmental 
study in rats with postnatal evaluation conducted at 25, 100 mg/kg/day, and 200 mg/kg b.i.d., there 
were no changes in the F0 and F1 generation at any dose (79X grazoprevir exposure in HCV-infected 
patients (100 mg) – compared to maternal exposure). 
In the reproductive toxicity studies with elbasvir, female and male fertility was evaluated in sexually 
mature female and male rats at 50, 300, and 1000 mg/kg/day. No teratogenicity was observed 
following elbasvir administration during the period of organogenesis to pregnant rats or rabbits up to 
the limit dose, 1000 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 hr = 21.8 µM.hr and 39.4 μMµhr, respectively represent 
approximately 9X and17X the elbasvir exposure in HCV-infected patients (50 mg), respectively). No 
effects on F1 generation in rats were observed when dams were administered elbasvir up to the limit 
dose, 1000 mg/kg/day during organogenesis and lactation. This dose provides a systemic plasma 
exposure, AUC0-24 hr = 21.8 µM.hr (based on toxicokinetic results of the embryo-foetal 
developmental study in rats) approximately 9X over the elbasvir exposure in HCV-infected patients (50 
mg).

Both Grazoprevir and elbasvir were shown to be non-genotoxic in a standard battery of genotoxicity 
studies. In accordance with ICH S1A guidance, carcinogenicity studies were not conducted given that 
the human use of elbasvir is less than 6 months in duration and that there is an absence of a genotoxic 
signal in the battery of genotoxicity studies and no evidence of a proliferative signal in the chronic 
toxicity studies. 
Recovery was not investigated as part of any of the pivotal safety studies. A 12 oral exploratory study, 
with 12 week recovery period was conducted in rasH2 wild-type that only investigated the 
hepatobiliary changes previously seen in shorter term study in the same species/strain. Fully pathology 
was not conducted as part of this study.  A 1-month oral toxicity study in dogs with 3-month treatment 
free recovery period was conducted at of 1000 mg/kg/day elbasvir to evaluate the reversibility of the 
phospholipidosis observed in the repeat-dose study in dogs. Given that suitable margins of exposure 
cover exist for all findings seen in all species compared to clinical exposures, the value of repeating in 
vivo study to investigate reversibility at this stage would be limited. 
The applicant committed to submit an updated ERA with data from the OECD 225 (sediment toxicity 
test with Lumbriculus variegatus) and OECD 218 (repeat toxicity test with the chironomid, 
(Chironomus riparius)) post-authorisation.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical package is considered acceptable and there are no outstanding concerns. The

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Formulations 
GZR has low solubility and high permeability whereas EBR has low solubility and low permeability. The 
solubility of both GZR and EBR are pH-dependent. Five formulations were developed and used in 
clinical studies, including: 
•  Single entity fit-for-purpose (FFP) formulations of each of GZR and EBR 
•  Single entity preliminary market (PMF) formulations of each of GZR (PMF1) and EBR (PMF2) 
•  A fixed-dose combination formulation tablet (EBR/GZR FDC2) that was used in the core Phase 
3 studies (060/C-EDGE TN; 061/C-EDGE COINFECTION and 068/C-EDGE TE).  
• 
The final market image (FMI) formulation has not been tested clinically. On the basis that the 
FMI tablet is identical to the Phase 3 EBR/GZR FDC formulation except for a change in the film 
coat colour and the debossed marking no bioequivalence study was considered to be 
necessary. 
Analytical methods 
Concentrations of GZR and EBR in plasma and dialysate were determined in various laboratories 
(sponsor’s facilities and CRO) using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric 
detection (LC-MS/MS) methods.

In Study 001 in healthy subjects, GZR was not measurable in plasma after doses < 25 mg. At higher 
doses the Tmax generally occurred at 2-4 h. C12h values of at least 28 nM and AUC0-∞ of at least 3.2 
µM• hr (targets calculated from results with another PI and adjusted based on relative activity vs. 
GZR) were attained with single doses ≥ 800 mg and multiple doses ≥ 400 mg (AUC) and 700 mg/day 
(AUC and Cmax). At 100 –  400 mg/day the accumulation ratio based on plasma AUC0-24 was ~3-
fold. Plasma GZR increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner over the range tested and was 
time-dependent. 
After single and multiple doses a biphasic plasma elimination profile was observed with a terminal 
elimination half-life of 16.9-24.7 h. 
Study P040 - Study Title: A 14C-microdose, Absolute Bioavailability Study of Single and Multiple 
Doses of Grazoprevir (MK-5172) in Healthy Adult Volunteers 
In Study 040 in healthy subjects - GZR absolute bioavailability was estimated to be in the range ~10% 
to 40% at doses from 25 to 200 mg (using 25 and 100 mg tablets). The applicant attributed the wide 
range to first-pass hepatic uptake and metabolism as well as incomplete absorption.  
Assuming that intestinal availability (Fg) has a value of ~1 (since ketoconazole had a minimal effect on 
GZR Cmax; see 2.1.10), together with the mean absolute bioavailability, the mean systemic plasma 
clearance of ~20-40 L/h and accounting for the blood to plasma ratio of 0.7, a human oral fraction 
absorbed (Fa) range of ~0.2-1.0 was estimated. This Fa range encompasses the Fa of ~0.5 estimated 
from a PB-PK model and the minimum Fa of 0.22 estimated from the human ADME study. 
Study MK-5172 004 – Study Title: “A Multiple Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, 
Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Grazoprevir (MK-5172) in Hepatitis C Infected Male 
Patients” 
In Study 004 in HCV-infected male patients – As in healthy subjects, Tmax was at 2-4 h and 
elimination was biphasic with t1/2 ~25-45 h, longer at lower doses. The 7-day accumulation ratios 
based on AUC0-24 were 2-4-fold. GZR steady state (reached in ~ 5 days) plasma exposure was ~2-
fold higher in HCV patients than in healthy subjects, such that measurable concentrations occurred 
with 10 mg/day dosing. GZR doses ≥  400 mg/day were required to meet the pre-defined targets 
(described above). Sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.5 report the antiviral efficacy by dose and PK-PD analysis.

EBR 
The absolute bioavailability of EBR is being assessed in an ongoing study. Meanwhile, the fraction 
absorbed (fa) of EBR was estimated from the PB-PK model to be ~0.4. 
Study MK-8742-P001 – Study Title: A Single and Multiple Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety and 
Pharmacokinetics of MK-8742 (Elbasvir) 
In Study MK-8742-P001, after single and multiple doses, Tmax was from 2.5 to 4.0 h. The target C24 
(3.0 nM; derived from daclatasvir data and expected to provide a 3 log10 decline in HCV RNA) was 
attained at ≥ 10 mg/day. Steady state occurred within 1-2 days. The accumulation ratios for AUC0-24 
ranged from 0.981 at 100 mg/day to 2.05 at 10 mg/day. On day 10, based on dosing with multiples of 
1 and 10 mg capsules, AUC and Cmax increased in an approximately dose proportional to slightly less 
than dose proportional fashion over 10 mg to 100 mg/day and EBR PK appeared to be time-
independent. Plasma concentrations declined bi-exponentially with t½ ~20 h after 10 mg to 200 mg 
daily dosing. 
On dosing in the fasted state with 50 mg/day (as 5 x 10 mg capsules) for 28 days, Study 006 gave 
very comparable AUC, Cmax and C24 values vs. those observed on day 10 in Study 001 at 50 mg/day. 
Tmax was 4 h and the accumulation ratios were 1.39 for AUC0-24, 1.20 for Cmax and 1.46 for C24. 
There was no relationship detected between plasma exposures and abnormalities in LFTs.

MK-8742-P002 – Study title: A Multiple Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and 
Pharmacodynamics of MK-8742 (Elbasvir) in Hepatitis C Infected Males 
In Study 002 in HCV-infected male patients – Tmax was at 2-3 h and t1/2 was ~20-24 h. The 5-day 
accumulation ratios based on AUC0-24 and dosing in the fasted state were 1.5-1.9-fold. Steady state 
was reached in ~ 2-3 days. At 50 mg/day and 100 mg/day the mean plasma exposures (AUC0-24) on 
day 5 were 1.49 and 2.20 µM.h, respectively. These values in HCV patients are very similar to those 
reported above on Day 10 for the same daily doses in healthy subjects.

In this study using a single dose of a 100 mg tablet: 
o  A high fat breakfast did not affect the AUC0-∞ (GMR 1.11; 90% CI 1.01, 1.21) or C24 (0.98; 
0.84, 1.14) but the effect on Cmax was much more variable (CV% 58.9) with a GMR of 1.61 
and 90% CI (0.99, 2.62). Tmax was delayed by ~ 40 minutes in the fed state.  
o  When dosing was in the fasted state and after two doses of 20 mg famotidine (at 10 h and 2 h 
prior to GZR) the GMRs (90% CI) for AUC0-∞, Cmax and C24 were 1.22 (1.03, 1.44), 1.63

Study 045 was conducted wholly in the fasting state. Famotidine was given as described in study 027. 
In the comparison between 50 mg EBR administered as 5 x 10 mg FFP capsules (A) vs. 1 x 50 mg 
PMF1 tablet (B), each given with 1 x 100 mg GZR FFP tablet, EBR bioavailability was much lower with 
(B) vs. (A). In the comparison between 50 mg EBR administered as (A) vs. 1 x 50 mg PMF1 tablet 
given after two prior doses of famotidine (C), each administered with 1 x 100 mg GZR FFP tablet, EBR 
bioavailability was also much lower with (C) vs. (A) but slightly greater than observed with (B). The 
EBR PMF1 tablet was not further pursued clinically. 
In the comparison between 50 mg EBR administered as (A) vs. 1 x 50 mg PMF2 tablet (D), each given 
with 1 x 100 mg GZR FFP tablet, EBR bioavailability was only slightly lower for (D) vs. (A), with lower 
90% CI in the range 0.70 to 0.74.  
Distribution 
GZR 
Binding of [3H]GZR to human plasma proteins was low and was concentration-independent up to 10 
µM. However, the unbound plasma fraction is reported as 0.012.  
Protein binding was similar in the plasma of patients without HCV but with severe renal impairment 
(97.8%) or ESRD on haemodialysis (98.4%) vs. healthy matched controls (98.3%). Protein binding 
was similar in patients with mild (98.3%), moderate (97.9%) and severe hepatic impairment (98.1%) 
without HCV infection vs. controls (98.3 – 98.8%).  
The mean blood/plasma concentration ratio was 0.7 in vitro, indicating that it does not preferentially 
distribute into erythrocytes and that blood clearance may be ~40% higher than plasma clearance.  
Passive permeability in LLC-PK1 cells was 19 x 10-6 cm/s, indicating good passive permeability. It was 
found to be a P-gp substrate in transfected cells. It was not possible to determine whether it is a 
substrate of BCRP due to endogenous transport in the host cell line. 
GZR demonstrated time- and temperature-dependent uptake into human hepatocytes. It is a substrate 
of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in transfected cells with a low Km (0.4 and 0.2 µM, respectively), suggesting 
a potential for saturable uptake into liver. 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 67/151 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on intravenous administration in healthy subjects and non-compartmental analysis the absolute 
volume of distribution (Vd) at steady-state was estimated to be ~3600 L following a single dose of 25 
mg and ~1400 L following single and once-daily doses of 200 mg GZR. The latter finding is proposed 
to reflect saturation of liver uptake at the 200 mg dose, which reduces the relative amount of drug 
distributing to the liver compared to plasma and therefore reduces Vd.  
Active liver uptake transport via OATP1B with liver metabolism and excretion means that not all of the 
GZR taken up into liver returns to plasma before elimination. Hence, the estimated Vd may not fully 
account for the volume associated with the liver and the true Vd may be greater. 
EBR 
EBR is extensively (>99.9%) bound to human plasma proteins in vitro over the concentration range of 
1 to 10 μM. There was no evidence of saturation of plasma protein binding within the analytical limits 
of the assay. Binding is to albumin and to α1-acid glycoprotein. Renal insufficiency (including ESRD 
patients on haemodialysis) and hepatic insufficiency had no effect on plasma protein binding in 
subjects not infected with HCV. 
The mean blood/plasma concentration ratio in vitro was 0.62 indicating that it does not bind 
preferentially to erythrocytes and total blood clearance may be ~60% higher than plasma clearance.  
In-vitro studies concluded that it is a P-gp substrate but not an OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 substrate. It was 
not possible to determine whether it is a substrate of BCRP due to endogenous transport in the host 
cell line and high non-specific binding. 
Based on the POPPK analysis, the apparent Vd (Vc + Vp) for a typical individual is ~680 L with inter-
individual variability of Vc ~26%. The Vc in HCV-infected patients was estimated to be ~30% higher 
than in healthy subjects.

Six fasted male subjects received a single oral nominal dose of 200 mg (~200 μCi) [14C]GZR. Total 
radioactivity in plasma was < LLOQ of 40.9 ng equivalents/g (53.330 nM equivalents) in all subjects by 
24 h post-dose and plasma GZR was < LLOQ of 1.00 ng/mL (1.30 nM) in all subjects by 168 h. 
Through the first 8 h the GZR plasma exposure (AUC0-8 and Cmax) was similar to total radioactivity 
with a GMR (95% CI) for AUC0-8 of 0.71 (0.59, 0.87) and GMR for Cmax of 0.81 (0.69, 0.96). No

The applicant proposes a biotransformation pathway, mediated mainly by CYP3A as shown in Figure 
10. 
In the GZR ADME study radioactivity in plasma was < LLOQ in all subjects by 24 h post-dose and 
plasma GZR was < LLOQ (< 1.00 ng/mL [1.30 nM]) in all subjects by 168 h. Tmax values were similar 
for radioactivity and GZR (2.59 and 3.01 h). Through the first 8 h the GZR plasma exposure (AUC0-8 
and Cmax) was similar to total radioactivity with a GMR (95% CI) for AUC0-8 of 0.71 (0.59, 0.87) and 
GMR for Cmax of 0.81 (0.69, 0.96). No metabolites of GZR were found in plasma.  
Radioactivity in urine was < LLOQ in all subjects by 216 h while radioactivity in faeces was quantifiable 
for at least 288 h. By 168 h the majority of the radioactive dose appeared to have been excreted in 
faeces (102%), with less than 0.3% being excreted in urine. Overall, 110.30% of the radioactive dose 
was recovered, with 109.77% in faeces and 0.29% in urine. [14C]GZR-related radioactivity was 
present in faeces as unchanged GZR (44.75%), the gut bacterial reductive metabolite M10 (33.93%) 
and 6 oxidative metabolites (total ~21% radioactivity; M4a, M4b, M7a, M11a, M11b and M14).  
The applicant concluded that ≥  21% of the oral GZR dose is absorbed and, since it is a P-gp substrate, 
some of the drug in faeces likely came from biliary secretion. The applicant concluded that GZR 
elimination is mediated by oxidative metabolism, mainly via CYP3A, and by biliary secretion. The 
between-subject variability in GZR steady-state exposure (~55% for AUC and ~64% for Cmax in non-
cirrhotic HCV-infected patients) and the within-subject variability (~26% for AUC and ~45% for Cmax) 
have been attributed to variability in saturable liver uptake and first pass metabolism. 
In the EBR ADME study radioactivity in plasma was < LLOQ in all subjects by 36 h. The plasma EBR 
LLOQ was 0.25 ng/mL (0.28 nM) and concentrations were quantifiable in all subjects through the 
entire 96 h sampling interval. The AUC0-16 of total radioactivity in plasma was similar to that of intact 
EBR. 
Radioactivity in urine fell to < LLOQ for all subjects by 48 h while levels in faeces appeared quantifiable 
from 24 h to at least 96 h in all subjects. The majority (94.2%) of radioactivity was excreted in the 
first 168 h. Overall, 94.3% of the radioactive dose was recovered, with 94.1% in faeces and 0.175% in 
urine. [14C]EBR-related radioactivity was present in faeces as M2 and M3 mono-oxidative metabolites 
(~19% of the administered dose) and EBR (~75% of the administered dose).  
The between-subject variability in EBR steady state exposure was generally within ~37-48% for AUC 
and ~34-61% for Cmax in HCV-infected patients. The within-subject variability was estimated to be 
~27% for AUC and ~35% for Cmax. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
GZR 
GZR plasma exposure increases in a greater than dose-proportional manner in keeping with saturation 
of liver uptake processes during first-pass elimination. The AUC0-24 exponent from the power model 
was ~1.7 in healthy and HCV-infected populations at steady state with similar terminal elimination 
slopes across all doses, supporting a conclusion that non-linearity in first pass is the primary driver of 
the greater than proportional behaviour rather than non-linearity in elimination. In addition, greater 
than dose proportional increases in exposure were observed for POPPK model-estimated Cmax and 
AUC for HCV-infected patients in Phase 2 and 3 studies who received 25 to 800 mg QD. PB-PK model 
simulations performed with/without activation of CYP3A or OATP1B saturation showed that the 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 71/151 
 
 
 
 
 
  
nonlinear kinetics likely reflect interplay between CYP3A and hepatic uptake transporters such as 
OATP1B. The GZR linearity index is ~1.2-2.5 across a 100 to 400 mg dose range in healthy subjects 
reflecting time-dependent PK, which is ascribed to the same saturable processes. 
EBR 
EBR PK appeared to be linear and time-independent. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
GZR exhibited consistent moderate to high variability in PK parameters within and across individual 
clinical studies. When serial pharmacokinetic samples were collected the overall between-subject 
variability in GZR steady-state exposure ranged from 39% to >100% for AUC and 42% to >100% for 
Cmax in healthy subjects across Phase 1 studies and ~55% for AUC and ~64% for Cmax in non-
cirrhotic HCV-infected patients (Study 059). The within-subject variability was estimated to be ~26% 
for AUC and ~45% for Cmax in Study 055 using a partial replicate design. The applicant attributes the 
variability to saturable liver uptake and metabolism of GZR, particularly during first pass. 
EBR PK exhibited consistently low to moderate variability within and across individual clinical studies. 
When serial pharmacokinetic samples were collected the overall between-subject variability (geometric 
coefficient of variation) in EBR steady state exposure was generally within the range of ~25-62% for 
AUC and ~22-68% for Cmax in healthy subjects and ~37-48% for AUC and ~34-61% for Cmax in 
HCV-infected patients. The within-subject variability was estimated to be ~27% for AUC and ~35% for 
Cmax in Study 055. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
GZR POPPK analysis 
The final model is a two-compartment open model with first order elimination. For GZR 100 mg QD the 
actual and predicted steady-state exposures in a reference population of HCV-infected patients (i.e. 
without baseline factors that increase exposure [cirrhosis, Japanese race or severe CKD]) were similar.

infected patients with PK data in Phase 3 studies (060, 061 and 068; including cirrhotic and non-
cirrhotic patients) were 1.972 μM•hr and 0.228 μM, respectively. Steady-state exposure in non-
cirrhotic HCV-infected patients was ~2-fold higher vs. healthy subjects but concentration-time profiles 
were similar.

Administration: Mean ± SD GZR Concentration-Time Profiles (Inset: Semi-log) 
The PBPK model was used to explore the potential mechanistic basis for the effect of HCV disease on 
GZR exposure. The model-predicted effect of HCV disease was consistent with the observed clinical 
data, supporting a conclusion that the higher exposure in HCV-infected patients is likely due to change 
in first-pass processes and therefore bioavailability (F) caused by impaired liver function. The reduced 
functional liver mass and OATP1B transporter abundance in HCV-infected patients has the potential to 
result in saturable liver uptake of GZR via OATP1B1 at lower concentrations than in healthy subjects. 
The applicant concluded that GZR PK properties in healthy subjects can be extrapolated to HCV-
infected patients given the consistency of ADME processes and similar concentration-time plasma 
profiles. 
Across Phase 2 and 3 studies Ctrough with GZR 100 mg QD gradually increased up to ~Day 7 and then 
declined to reach stable values at ~Week 3 in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients. Since GZR is not 
predicted to induce CYP3A4/P-gp this has been attributed to on-treatment improvement of liver 
function. 
EBR POPPK analysis 
A two-compartment model with lagged first order absorption was used to characterise EBR PK. No 
statistically significant influence of HCV genotype, cirrhosis, Child-Pugh B status, dialysis or use of 
strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors was identified. For 50 mg QD actual and predicted steady-state 
exposures in a reference population of HCV-infected patients (as above) were similar. The POPPK 
estimated gmean AUC and Cmax values in patients were 2.383 μM·hr and 0.151 μM, respectively. In 
Assessment report

the POPPK model HCV was a significant covariate only for Vc. Analyses indicated that steady-state is 
generally achieved within ~5 days at 50 mg/day in HCV-infected patients. The gmean accumulation 
ratio (AUC ratio) ranged from 1.24-1.39 in healthy subjects compared to 1.89 in HCV-infected 
patients.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In clinical study protocols, the applicant’s pre-defined acceptance criteria for concluding no effect of 
concomitant medications on GZR and/or EBR were generally 90% CI around GMRs of (0.5, 2.0) for 
GZR and EBR. Corresponding criteria for concluding no effect of GZR and/or EBR on co-administered 
medications varied but were mostly 90% CI around GMRs of (0.70, 1.43) or (0.5, 2.0). 
In vivo 
DDI studies were conducted with dosing of all agents in the fasted state at least on PK sampling days. 
Please note that the doses of GZR used were often higher than proposed for the final FDC because 200 
mg in healthy subjects was thought to reflect exposures with 100 mg in HCV-infected patients. The 
EBR dose was most often 50 mg.

During the procedure the applicant reported results from study 081 in which the effects of EBR/GZR on 
TDF were assessed. The TFV GMR [90% CI] for AUC0-24 was 1.27 [1.20, 1.35], indicating that the 
effect of the FDC was not greater than that of EBR alone and that no dose adjustment was needed. 
Summary of applicant’s conclusions from clinical DDI studies  
•  GZR and EBR show clinically relevant decreases in exposure with moderate and strong CYP3A 
inducers but no clinically relevant increases in exposure with CYP3A inhibitors.  
•  GZR exposure increases to a clinically relevant extent with OATP1B inhibitors.  
• 
P-gp and BCRP play a limited role in the absorption of GZR and EBR. 
•  GZR is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A, an intestinal BCRP inhibitor, but not an inhibitor of OATP1B.  
• 
• 
EBR is not an inhibitor of OATP1B. 
EBR is an inhibitor of intestinal BCRP and intestinal P-gp. 
Figure 12 summarises the applicant’s initial position regarding need for dose adjustments by 
mechanism of interaction, noting that the grey areas represent the applicant’s bounds. The applicant 
contraindicated use of EBR/GZR with inhibitors of OATP1B and inducers of CYP3A during the procedure.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Grazoprevir (GZR; MK-5172), is an inhibitor of the NS3/4A protease (i.e. it is a PI). NS3/4A-mediated 
cleavage of the polyprotein formed by translation of the HCV RNA genome is essential for replication.  
Elbasvir (EBR; MK-8742) is an inhibitor non-structural protein 5A (NS5A). NS5A is a pleiotropic protein 
with important roles in HCV viral replication and modulation of the physiology of the host cell.  
Primary pharmacology 
GZR  
In a peptide hydrolysis-based enzymatic assay GZR inhibited NS3/4A from GT 1 – 6 with IC50 values < 
1 nM. The IC50 range was from picomolar levels for GT-1 to 0.034-0.135 for non-GT1 enzymes except 
for GT3 (0.69 nM). 
In the replicon assay, GZR inhibited GT1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 4a, 5a and 6a viruses with a mean EC50 range 
0.2 – 2.9 nM. The EC50 was 0.4 nM for GT1a and 0.5 nM for GT1b replicon cell lines with a similar 
value for the full-length GT4a replicon (0.3 nM) and GT6a (0.2 nM). The EC50 was higher for a 
homologous GT2a (2.3 nM) replicon and for chimeric replicons encoding NS3/4As from GT2b (3.7nM) 
or GT5a (1.5nM).  
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 79/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Least activity was observed for the chimeric GT3a (GLA) replicon (EC50 7.6 nM) and full-length GT3a 
(S52) replicon (35 nM) although the value for the chimeric replicon with only the S52 protease domain 
was 2.1 nM. Also, the EC50 in representative GT3a patient isolates ranged from 2-7 nM.  
The EC50 shifted by <3-fold when estimated in the presence of 40% normal human serum.Using 
engineered replicons activity was not affected by RAVs associated with treatment failure to other 
protease inhibitors including V36A/L/M or T54A/S (telaprevir) and Q80K/R (simeprevir). Amino acid 
substitutions associated with the most substantial potency shifts were R155G/T/W, A156T/V and 
D168A/F/G/H/I/K/L/T/V/Y for GT1b and Y56H and D168A/G/H/I/K/T/V for GT1a. RAVs identified in 
GT3 did not confer large potency shifts (≤ 7-fold). 
GZR showed an additive effect with interferon-alpha, ribavirin and EBR with an effect that was additive 
to synergistic with SOF. No cytotoxic effects were observed at any of the combination concentrations 
tested. 
The emergence of resistance in GT1a replicon cells was assessed on exposure to the combination of 
GZR and EBR. Tested alone concentrations 100 X and 1000 X EC90 were required to suppress 
emergence of resistant colonies but 10 X EC90 of each tested in combination blocked the emergence of 
resistant colonies. Clonal sequencing analysis of resistant colonies selected with >1X EC90 combinations 
of both compounds revealed mostly linked mutations (≥ 2 in both protein targets), indicating a higher 
genetic barrier to resistance when GZR and EBR are used in combination. 
Study MK-5172-P004 – Study title: A Multiple Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, 
Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Grazoprevir (MK-5172) in Hepatitis C Infected Male 
Patients 
In Study MK-5172-P004 in HCV-infected male patients the maximum log 10 HCV RNA reduction vs. 
placebo was 5.34 IU/mL, which occurred with 800 mg/day in GT1 patients. In GT3 patients the largest 
reduction was 4.98 IU/mL, which occurred with 600 mg/day. Significant differences vs. placebo 
occurred at all GZR doses for both genotypes tested, as summarised in Figures 13 and 14 for each 
genotype below, which suggest more rapid recovery after day 7 for GT3 (it seems all were GT3a) vs. 
GT1. GT1a and GT1b responded similarly and showed similar relationships with PK parameters.

Baseline and post base-line resistance analysis was conducted in 71/74 GZR patients. The NS3/4A 
gene from samples with > 1000 IU/mL was subjected to PCR and population and selective clonal 
sequencing. On average 45 clones per sample were used for the clonal sequencing analysis. The 
sensitivity of variant detection in clonal sequencing was between 5 - 10%. Post-baseline variants in > 
10% of the samples were noted and NS3/4a variants with more than 5-fold reduced susceptibility were 
considered as RAVs. 
Substitutions at amino acids 168, 156, 56 and 155 were observed in > 10% of GZR patients and 
amino acid variants were also observed at other positions but examination of sequences in Genbank 
database showed that most of these positions are highly polymorphic and their role in resistance is 
unclear. In general, there was no notable difference in terms of the types of RAVs and the prevalence 
of RAVs selected by different dose levels within each genotype. RAVs at amino acids 168, 156, 56 and 
155 occurred more often with GT1a vs. GT1b patients (e.g. at 168: 65% vs. 52% GT1b; at 156: 
26.9% vs. 19%; at 56: 26.9% vs. 9.5%; at 155: 23% vs. 19%).  
In HCV GT1a replicons, substitution Y56H resulted in 16-fold reduced susceptibility and D168A, D168E, 
D168K led to 81-, 14- and 212-fold reduced susceptibility, respectively. In GT1b, variants Y56H, 
A156T, and D168K resulted in 12.6-, 280-, and 121-fold reduced susceptibility, respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 82/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clonal sequence analysis of 13 GT1a and 6 GT1b samples showed that RAVs were consistent with 
those identified by the population analysis. The R155W/A156G double mutation, which confers a > 
3000-fold reduction in susceptibility, was not found up to 2-month follow-up. 
The most frequent baseline polymorphisms were:  
•  GT1a - at 80 (42%) followed by 122 (15%), 168 or 170 (7.6%)  
•  GT1b - at 56 (36%) or 170 (32%) 
•  GT3 at 166 (37.5%) 
None of the baseline polymorphisms impacted on viral response. 
EBR  
In a panel of sub-genomic replicon cell lines that contained NS5A sequences the mean EC50 values 
were almost all in the range 3-14 pM and specifically GT1a (4 pM), GT1b (3 pM), GT2a (31L) (3 pM), 
GT3a (14 pM), GT4a (3 pM), GT5a (1 pM) and GT6d (3 pM). The EC50 was markedly higher for the 
GT2b replicon (3.4 nM), which was largely due to amino acid substitution of L31M within the GT2 NS5A 
sequence.  
There was a 10-fold shift in potency in the presence of 40% NHS.   
Against replicons generated with several patient isolates the EC50 values for GT1a and GT1b were from 
3-10 pM. For GT2 values ranged from 0.003 to 20 nM, largely reflecting the presence of 31M in GT2b. 
For GT3a the range was from 3 pM to 0.4 nM with least activity against 3i and 3g subtypes that 
harbored RAVs at positions 28, 30 and 31. In a diverse set of GT4 and GT6 subtypes there were sub-
picomolar EC50 values for most isolates. The least susceptible was a GT6n isolate for which the EC50 
was 2.7 nM and in which amino acid substitutions were found at positions 28, 30 and 93. The range for 
GT5a was from 0.4-1 pM.   
EBR activity was also assessed in engineered replicons encoding defined RAVs, including those from 
GT1a, GT1b and GT4a. RAVs elicited by other NS5A inhibitors in GT1b caused <20-fold reductions in 
EBR activity and EC50 values were ≤ 50 pM. In contrast, the most shifted variants in GT1a caused a 
2-3 log reduction in activity.  
Reduced activity was observed particularly against Y93H substitutions in GT1a, GT1b, GT2a and GT3a. 
Additional RAVs in GT1a that reduced EBR activity were L31M/V and Q30D/E/H/K/R. In GT2a, GT5a 
and GT6a reduced activity was observed for substitutions at F/L28S/F and L31F.  
The presence of the natural resistance polymorph 31M in GT2b caused EBR resistance. Similar results 
were obtained when a more rapid transient infectious virus assay was used to study defined resistance 
in GT1a instead of stable replicons. 
In de novo resistance selection studies RNA isolated from resistant colonies revealed that variants 
occurred primarily at positions 28, 30, 31 and 93. Substitutions at Q30 and Y93 were mainly 
responsible for potency losses in GT1a. Substitutions F28S, Y93H and Y93H in GT2a, GT2b and GT3a, 
respectively, resulted in >1000-fold loss of activity in those genotypes.  
EBR presented a higher genetic barrier to resistance in GT1b and GT4a in which two nucleotide 
changes were generally required to elicit resistance. Substitutions L28F and L31F in GT5a and F28S 
and L31F in GT6 were the main variants responsible for resistance.   
There was additive to synergistic activity with ribavirin, sofosbuvir and GZR.

Study MK-8742-P002 – Study title: A Multiple Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics 
and Pharmacodynamics of MK-8742 (Elbasvir) in Hepatitis C Infected Males 
In the EBR monotherapy Study 002 in HCV-infected male patients the maximum log10 HCV RNA 
reduction vs. placebo was 4.41 IU/mL, seen with 50 mg/day in GT1 patients. In GT1a and GT3 the 
largest reductions were 3.95 IU/mL at 50 mg/day and 2.27 at 100 mg/day, respectively. Significant 
differences vs. placebo occurred only at 50 mg/day and 100 mg/day for GT3.  
Baseline resistance analysis was conducted in 44 EBR patients using population sequencing and 
polymorphisms at amino acid loci prone to resistance selection by NS5A inhibitors (including EBR) were 
evaluated (positions 28, 30, 31, 58 and 93). Seven patients had HCV with baseline polymorphisms at 
one or more of these loci (2 GT1a, 2 GT1b and 3 GT3), with reduced susceptibility to EBR in HCV 
replicons.

Post-baseline analysis of virus variants suggested that M28T, Q30R, L31V and Y93H in GT1a, L31V and 
Y93H in GT1b and A30K, L31F and Y93H in GT3 were the major RAVs selected by EBR based on 
population sequencing. Variants with these substitutions showed reduced susceptibility to EBR in HCV 
replicons. Detailed clonal sequencing revealed that most of the variants contained double or triple 
linked mutations. Additional polymorphisms were also noted. Three of 5 GT3 patients treated with 10 
mg EBR did not show any antiviral response and clonal sequencing detected NS5A RAVs. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Two QTc studies were conducted as shown in Table 24. All dosing was in the fasted state and in each 
study moxifloxacin 400 mg was shown to be an adequate positive control.

In Study 049 the gmean GZR AUC after a 1600 mg dose was 77 µM.h but the range was very large 
(23-326 µM.h. The gmean Cmax was 14 μM with a range from 5.46-44.6 μM. The applicant does not 
discuss the possible reasons for such a wide range to occur in healthy fasted subjects. Nevertheless, 
the gmean GZR AUC and Cmax values (estimated from the POPPK model) for the 950 HCV-infected 
patients with PK data in Phase 3 studies were 1.972 μM.h and 0.228 μM, respectively, indicating that 
the exposures achieved with 1600 mg considerably exceeded those predicted to be typical for HCV-
infected patients.

Table 20.  Part 1: Statistical Analysis of Pharmacokinetics Primary Objective Estimation of Geometric 
Means for Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Oral Dose Administration of MK-8742 to 
Fasted Healthy Adult Subjects for Each Level of Treatment (Per-Protocol Population) 
In Part 2 the 700 mg dose gave a gmean Cmax of 567 nM (range 245-1240 nM) and AUC0-24 of 6200 
nM.h (range 2690-14,500 nM.h). In comparison, the POPPK estimated gmean AUC and Cmax values in 
HCV-infected patients dosed at 50 mg/day were 2383 nM·h and 151 nM, respectively. In Part 2 there 
were 14 placebo patients with measurable EBR from the previous treatment period but concentrations 
were from 0.287-8.43 nM (i.e. ≤ 1.5% of gmean Cmax). A test for first-order carryover included in the 
model used in the primary evaluation of QTcF change from baseline was not statistically significant at 
the 0.10 level. 
After 700 mg EBR the largest mean change from baseline of QTcF vs. placebo was 0.856 (-1.06, 2.78), 
occurring at 1.5 h post-dose. No subject had average QTcF readings >450 ms and all had a QTcF 
change from baseline ≤30 ms at all times.  
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
In Study MK-5172-p004 the GT3 patients showed a trend for greater viral response across the 100 to 
800 mg dose range, with mean differences in maximum log10 HCV RNA reduction that increased from 2 
to 5 log10. A dose-dependent relationship was not detected in GT1a or GT1b patients since maximum 
log10 HCV RNA reduction was consistently in the range of 4 to 5 log10 and patient exposures across the 
30 - 800 mg dose range appeared to be on the PK-PD plateau.  
In Study mk-8742-p002 there was no trend to suggest a relationship between EBR PK and reduction in 
HCV GT1 RNA. The analysis for GT3 was complicated by the lack of response in 3/5 patients at 10 
mg/day and no conclusions could be drawn.  
Exposure-response analyses based on Phase 2/3 efficacy and PK data showed that: 
•  GZR AUC0-24 and Ctrough were not associated with SVR12 (p >0.2), suggesting that exposures 
at the 100 mg dose were on the maximal response plateau of the E-R curve for efficacy.  
•  EBR AUC0-24 and EBR Ctrough were both associated with SVR12 (p=0.003 and 0.006).  
Based on area under the ROC curve, the final model for EBR AUC0-24 as the pharmacokinetic endpoint 
was a slightly better predictor of SVR12 than the model for Ctrough. Significant covariates (p<0.001) 
were treatment duration, baseline log10 HCV RNA and presence or absence of baseline resistance (of 
any degree) to NS5A inhibitors. In general, SVR12 rates were lower for short treatment durations (8 
weeks), higher baseline log10 HCV RNA and in patients who had baseline resistance to NS5A inhibitors. 
NS5A RAVs that result in > 5-fold shift in EBR were associated with a greater reduction in SVR12 vs. 
those associated with < 5-fold shift. Also, the presence of baseline NS5A resistance had a greater 
impact on SVR12 for GT1a compared to the other genotypes.

Figure 17 shows that EBR exposures associated with the 50 mg dose (with 100 mg GZR) are generally 
on the plateau of the E-R curve, with a subset with baseline resistance to NS5A inhibitors being more 
sensitive to reductions in AUC0-24 compared to those without baseline resistance to NS5A inhibitors.

for differences in baseline HCV RNA between subjects, which may also influence the efficacy outcome. 
Boxplot with Δ: dose=20 mg; Boxplot with +: dose=50 mg. 
Simulations showed that reducing the dose of either GZR or EBR by half still resulted in high projected 
SVR12 rates, even in the worst-case scenario of development of on-treatment resistance to both 
compounds simultaneously in GT1a. 
Exposure-safety analyses explored GZR exposure and Late ALT/AST Elevations. AUC0-24 and Cmax 
were obtained from POPPK and C2 was the GM of individual values from Day 7 onwards. All three PK 
parameters were well correlated with the Late ALT/AST Elevation Events, with AUC0-24 appearing to be 
slightly more predictive based on AUC of ROC.  
A 5-fold increase in AUC0-24 relative to the reference population corresponded to a predicted population 
Late ALT/AST Elevation Event rate of ~2%. A rate of 5% was predicted at a GM AUC0-24 ~ 23.7 μM•hr, 
which represents an exposure margin ~14-fold the GM with 100 mg doses in the reference population 
and ~11-fold that in a broader population. Since AUC0-24 increases in a greater than dose proportional 
manner, a 5-fold increase results in AUCs similar to those observed with a 200 mg GZR dose and a 14-
fold increase results in AUCs between those observed with 200 and 400 mg. The applicant considered

that a 5% incidence rate of Late ALT/AST Elevation Events was the highest clinically acceptable rate 
and this boundary was applied to dose selection for Phase 2b and 3 studies.

The reference population included non-cirrhotic, non-severe CKD, non-Asian HCV-infected patients in the 100 mg dosing arms of the 
Phase 2 and 3 studies/arms included in this analysis. 
The analyses above were used to derive the applicant’s comparability bounds applied to interpretation 
of PK data documenting effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The applicant’s rationale for the 
selection of EBR/GZR 100/50 mg once daily for variable durations for HCV-infected sub-populations in 
Phase 2b/3 studies is based mainly on the following: 
GZR 
The GZR monotherapy study (004) indicated that ≥ 50 mg doses were on the maximum response 
plateau of the dose-response curve for GT1a and GT1b. 
In study 003 SVR12 rates were 89.4% in TN non-cirrhotic GT1 patients treated with 100 mg GZR + PR 
vs. 79.3% to 93.0% with 200, 400 or 800 mg + PR, indicating no need for > 100 mg. In study 038 
similar SVR12 rates were obtained with 50 mg + PR (21/25, 84%) and 100 mg + PR (23/26, 89%) but 
the rate was 13/24 (54%) for the 25 mg + PR regimen in the PP analysis. Elevations of ALT and/or 
AST were observed after TW4 at doses from 200 mg but not at 100 mg.  
Results of Studies 003 and 038 suggested that 100 mg GZR is associated with maximal efficacy and is 
associated with an acceptable risk of Late ALT/AST Elevation Events. 
EBR 
The EBR monotherapy study (002) provided evidence that 10 and 50 mg EBR were associated with 
similar efficacy but 50 mg may provide better sustained suppression of GT1a vs. 10 mg, consistent 
with in-vitro data suggesting that the EBR exposures at 50 mg are more likely to cover more common 
NS5A RAVs than exposures at 10 mg. 
In Part A of the Phase 2 study 035, 12 weeks EBR 50 mg provided similar efficacy to 20 mg with 
SVR12 rates of 100% (22/22) and > 95% (23/24), respectively, in TN non-cirrhotic, GT1-infected 
patients.  
The applicant considered that the 50 mg dose gives a margin for potential decreases in EBR PK without 
impacting efficacy, particularly in more difficult to treat patients (e.g. with cirrhosis).

RAVs in Phase 2/3 clinical failures 
During the procedure the applicant updated the information to describe 31 GT1/4 virologic failures with 
12 weeks EBR/GZR. Samples were assayed using population sequencing. 
At failure treatment-emergent NS3 RAVs were present in 17/31 (54.8%). At FUW24, 29/31 had NS3 
sequences and treatment-emergent NS3 RAVs were detected in 6/29. 
Treatment-emergent NS5A RAVs were present in 27/31 (87.1%) at the time of failure. At FUW24, 
29/31 had NS5A sequences and RAVs were detected in 23/29 (79.3%). 
There were 14/31 (45.2%) with treatment-emergent NS3 and NS5A RAVs at the time of failure. Four 
of 29 with sequences at FUW24 had treatment-emergent NS3 and NS5A RAVs. 
These results indicate a relatively rapid disappearance of treatment-emergent NS3 RAVs and a slower 
decline in NS5A RAVs, which is consistent with data reported for other compounds in the same classes.  
For GT1a treatment-emergent NS3 RAVs were detected in 64% who experienced virologic failure but 
they were present in 22% by FUW24. Treatment-emergent NS5A RAVs were detected in 88% who 
experienced virologic failure (88%) and most were detectable at FUW24 (87%). Also, 56% of GT1a 
patients had treatment-emergent NS3 and NS5A RAVs at failure, and 17% still had these RAVs at 
FUW24. 
For GT1b treatment-emergent NS3 RAVs were detected in 1/4 virologic failures and the RAVs (Y56F 
and V107I) persisted to FUW24. Treatment-emergent NS5A RAVs were detected in 3/4 virologic 
failures and persisted through FUW24. 
Treatment-emergent NS3 RAVs were not detected in the two GT4 virologic failures but both had 
treatment-emergent NS5A RAVs, which were not detectable at FUW24. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Summary of PK properties of GZR 
GZR is a relatively insoluble compound that has limited oral bioavailability (at least 22% is absorbed in 
healthy subjects) that is thought to reflect incomplete absorption and first-pass hepatic uptake. Taking 
GZR with food increases the GZR AUC ~1.5-fold and Cmax ~2.8-fold. The DDI studies were almost all 
conducted in the fasted state. In the clinical efficacy studies EBR/GZR was taken without regard to 
food but many potentially interacting concomitant medications were forbidden. Variability in exposure 
associated with the dosing conditions (fasting/fed) was taken into account when predicting the effects 
of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on exposure. For example, use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor (~3-fold 
increase in GZR AUC) with GZR in the fed state (~1.5-fold increase in GZR AUC) would result in a 
~4.5-fold increase in GZR exposure. Taking into account the contraindications and warnings that were 
introduced to the SmPC during the procedure, the recommendation that EBR/GZR may be taken 
without regard to food was accepted.  
Plasma clearance (85 L/h in HCV-infected; IIV of 42% at 100 mg/day) is dose-dependent, which is 
thought to reflect saturable liver uptake via OATP1B and saturable CYP3A metabolism With a 
blood:plasma ratio of 0.7, total blood clearance may be ~40% higher than plasma clearance. 
Subsequent liver metabolism via CYP3A4 and excretion means that not all of the GZR returns to 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 90/151 
 
 
 
 
 
plasma before elimination in faeces as unchanged drug (~80%) and oxidative metabolites (~20%). 
Therefore the Vd derived from plasma levels may be an under-estimate. As oral bioavailability is 
unknown, it cannot be excluded that extensive biliary excretion of unchanged drug occurs, in which 
case P-gp and BCRP are likely to be involved. 
HCV-infected patients showed increases in plasma levels up to ~day 7 and then a decline to a stable 
level after several weeks, which was thought to reflect improvement in hepatic function as HCV was 
cleared. Steady-state exposure in non-cirrhotic HCV-infected patients was ~2-fold higher than in 
healthy subjects although the concentration-time profile was similar to that in healthy subjects.  
The PBPK model supported the conclusion that the difference between HCV-infected and uninfected 
individuals likely reflects a combination of reductions in CYP3A and OATP1B abundance, hepatic blood 
flow and functional liver mass, resulting in saturable liver uptake of GZR at lower concentrations in 
HCV-infected patients vs. healthy subjects. The lack of dose-proportionality and the time-dependency 
observed have been ascribed to the interplay between first pass metabolism due to CYP3A and hepatic 
uptake via OATP1B. 
After daily dosing with GZR 200 mg in mild, 100 mg in moderate and 50 mg in severe hepatic 
insufficiency, the day 10 GMRs indicated that respective AUCs were 1.66, 4.82 and 11.68 vs. the 
control group. In the clinical trials of efficacy using EBR/GZR 100/50 mg/day patients were restricted 
to Child-Pugh A. Use is contraindicated in patients with CP-B and CP-C.  
With low solubility and the potential for various factors to affect systemic exposure it is not really a 
surprise that between-subject variability in GZR steady-state exposure ranged from ~55% for AUC and 
~64% for Cmax in non-cirrhotic HCV-infected patients and that within-subject variability was 
estimated to be ~26% for AUC and ~45% for Cmax. Age was an important covariate.   
The POPPK modelling for GZR was comprehensive and allowed for a semi-mechanistic understanding of 
the pharmacokinetics.  The PBPK modelling for GZR provided useful supporting data for the effect of 
disease on exposure but this model cannot be used to derive dose adjustments in patients. 
Summary of PK properties of EBR 
EBR is also a relatively insoluble compound. The lack of dose proportionality observed at > 100 mg has 
been ascribed to low solubility limiting its absorption. An absolute oral bioavailability study indicated 
that about one third of an oral dose is absorbed. EBR is thought to have low permeability and plasma 
exposure is slightly decreased when it is taken with food. As for GZR, taking it with agents that 
increase gastric pH had no major effect on plasma levels. 
EBR is extensively bound (>99.9%) to plasma proteins with no measurable effect of renal or hepatic 
impairment on free drug. The estimated Vd is large, with a POPPK-predicted Vc ~30% higher in HCV-
infected patients than in healthy subjects. The estimated apparent oral clearance CL/F for a typical 
HCV-infected patient is ~30 L/h, which is comparable to that in healthy male subjects (32.4 L/h). With 
a blood:plasma ratio of 0.62, total blood clearance of EBR may be ~60% higher than plasma 
clearance.  
EBR is eliminated mainly into faeces as parent drug (~75%) as well as oxidative metabolites formed 
via CYP3A. There were no circulating metabolites detected in plasma. Since oxidative metabolites in 
faeces represented ~19% of the dose it appears that metabolism and excretion of parent drug 
contribute to the elimination of EBR to a similar extent. The apparent t½ in HCV-infected patients is 
~24 h, which is slightly longer than in healthy subjects, and gives an accumulation ratio ~1.9-fold.

EMA/419807/2016

Time to steady state was ~5 days in HCV-infected patients although Ctrough values from Phase 2 and 
3 studies indicated that stable concentrations were achieved within one to two weeks in cirrhotic and 
non-cirrhotic HCV-infected patients. EBR PK appears to be linear and time-independent at least up to 
100 mg QD. Data from the 800 mg dose used in the TQT study showed that PK was less than dose 
proportional at > 100 mg, consistent with low solubility limiting its absorption. 
The mean steady-state EBR plasma concentration-time profiles were comparable between non-cirrhotic 
HCV-infected patients and healthy subjects. The POPPK model also showed that HCV status was a 
significant covariate only on Vc. This finding, which contrasts with that for GZR, is thought to reflect 
the fact that EBR disposition does not depend on OATP1B uptake so that EBR PK is not so sensitive to 
the effects of reduced functional liver mass and OATP1B transporter abundance in HCV-infected 
patients. The POPPK analysis showed no statistically significant influence of cirrhosis or Child-Pugh B 
status on EBR PK. The between-subject variability was ~37-48% for AUC and ~34-61% for Cmax in 
HCV-infected patients whilst within-subject variability was ~27% for AUC and ~35% for Cmax.   
Applicant’s bounds applied to PK data for concluding no important effect on safety or efficacy 
As described in the next section (Pharmacodynamics), it was not agreed that the applicant’s lower 
bounds of 0.4 for GZR and 0.5 for EBR were conservative for the purposes of concluding on effects on 
efficacy. What is more, exposure to GZR may be reduced as HCV is treated, with unpredictable 
improvements in hepatic function affecting disposition. The upper bound of 5.0 for GZR was based on 
the relationship between GZR AUC and Late ALT/AST Elevation Events (see further under 
Pharmacodynamics and Safety). The upper bound of 2.0 for EBR was based on safety in sub-
populations of the Phase 2 and 3 studies with higher than average EBR exposures. These were 
considered to be acceptable cut-off values. 
It is not practical to tailor the dose of EBR/GZR to the individual when there will be only a FDC tablet of 
100/50 mg marketed and when there are no clear grounds on which TDM could be based. It was 
concluded that avoidance of co-administration with certain types of medications for the few months it 
now takes to treat HCV should be advised so as to provide a secure basis for HCV eradication and to 
protect patient safety. A simple and pragmatic approach was considered necessary (see further below 
under interactions). 
Drug interactions 
In clinical studies in HCV-infected patients drugs specifically prohibited were: 
•  Drugs known to be hepatotoxic, including but not limited to etifoxine, isoniazid, nitrofurantoin 
•  Herbal supplements 
•  Strong and moderate CYP 3A/P-gp inducers, including but not limited to: nafcillin, rifampicin, 
carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, bosentan, modafinil, St. John's Wort 
•  OATP inhibitors, including but not limited to ciclosporin, gemfibrozil, eltrombopag, lapatinib 
•  Certain HIV medications, including but not limited to efavirenz, etravirine, all HIV PI and PI/r 
•  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin > 10 mg, atorvastatin > 
10 mg 
•  Systemic corticosteroids ≥ 10 mg prednisone per day 
Use of 200 mg GZR in many DDI studies was appropriate to give similar exposures as achieved with 
100 mg in non-Asian HCV-infected patients without cirrhosis or CKD. Co-administration of single doses

of potential victims on day 11 of EBR/GZR dosing ensured that approximate steady state had been 
reached.  
Co-administration of EBR/GZR with the following has been contraindicated during the procedure: 
• 
• 
Inhibitors of OATP1B1/3 
Inducers of CYP3A4 or P-gp  
Co-administration of EBR/GZR with the following has been “not recommended”: 
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or P-gp   
In summary 
The applicant conducted a comprehensive range of PK studies and applied POPPK and PBPK modelling. 
The revised proposals regarding implications of PK data for the SmPC are acceptable. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The final proposal was for treatment of GT1a, GT1b and 4. 
The median GZR EC50 values against chimeric replicons encoding NS3/4A sequences from clinical 
isolates were from 0.2 nM. The highest value was 5.85 nM for genotype 3 (2.1 7.6 nM; N=6) (i.e. ~30-
fold range). The EBR median EC50 values against chimeric replicons encoding NS5A sequences from 
clinical isolates were from 0.005 nM for GT1a to 0.02 nM for GT3a (0.01 0.33 nM; N=9) (i.e. ~60-fold 
range). Therefore GT3 seems to be generally less susceptible than other genotypes. In contrast, GT4 
isolates appear to be very susceptible.  
Not only are GZR and EBR less active against GT3 compared to GT1 in vitro but also the two 
monotherapy studies in HCV-infected male subjects indicated notable differences in GZR and EBR 
activity between GT1 and GT3. For 100 mg GZR the drop in viral load was much less for GT3 compared 
to GT1a and 1b and there was a rapid recovery post-treatment. For 50 mg EBR there appeared to be 
some leeway in dose for GT1a and 1b but for GT3 the marked difference between 10 mg (3/5 did not 
respond) and 50 mg suggested that there could be little leeway for any reduction in exposure. 
Furthermore, in Phase 2 EBR/GZR with RBV for 12 or 18 weeks performed poorly against GT3 in TN 
and non-cirrhotic patients (SVR12 rates in the FAS were 9/20 [45%] and 12/21 [57%]). These results 
pointed to a concern that pairing SOF with EBR/GZR may mean that efficacy is heavily driven by SOF 
and the strategy could result in selection of resistant HCV during wider use. 
Across genotypes various NS3 substitutions at positions 43, 56, 77, 163, 168 and 178 can have very 
marked effects on GZR activity when they occur alone with further reductions when they occur 
together. NS3 substitutions especially at A156 and at D168 confer reduced susceptibility to GZR and to 
other NS3/4A protease inhibitors. For EBR NS5A various substitutions reduce activity by 6- to 2000 
fold with further reductions when they occur together. EBR activity was reduced >5-fold by M/L28T/A, 
Q/R30E/H/R/G/K/L/D, L31M/V/F, H58D and Y93C/H/N. Some NS5A substitutions confer resistance to 
EBR and other NS5A inhibitors. 
Taking into account that most failures were in GT1a-infected patients, virologic failure during or after 
EBR/GZR was frequently associated with NS3 and/or NS5A RAVS. The persistence of NS5A RAVs at 
FUW24 was a concern and was taken into account when concluding on the genotype-specific posology.  
Exposure-efficacy analyses – applicant’s lower acceptance bounds applied to PK 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 93/151 
 
 
 
 
 
The applicant’s proposed lower bound of 0.4 for GZR was derived from the AUCSS at 50 mg (0.68 
μM•hr) relative to 100 mg (1.77 μM•hr) in a pooled non-cirrhotic, non-Japanese, non-CKD population. 
The applicant considered that the derived ratio of 0.4, supported by viral dynamics modelling, was 
conservative for identifying a boundary at which there would be no loss of efficacy.  
The applicant’s proposed lower bound of 0.5 for EBR was derived from the AUC with 25 mg EBR when 
dosed in combination with 100 mg GZR. This is proposed to be a conservative threshold taking into 
account the similar efficacy observed for 50 mg and 20 mg doses in Phase 2. Patients with HCV 
resistant to NS5A inhibitors have lower SVR12 rates and more sensitivity to changes in EBR exposure. 
Exposure-efficacy analyses showed that: 
•  GZR AUC0-24 and Ctrough were not associated with SVR12, suggesting that exposures at the 
100 mg dose were on the maximal response plateau of the E-R curve for efficacy against GT1 
and 4.  
• 
EBR AUC0-24 and EBR Ctrough were both associated with SVR12 in GT1 and 4.  
AUC0-24 was a slightly better predictor of SVR12 than Ctrough. Significant covariates were treatment 
duration, baseline log10 HCV RNA and presence or absence of baseline resistance (of any degree) to 
NS5A inhibitors. In general, SVR12 rates were lower for short treatment durations (8 weeks), higher 
baseline log10 HCV RNA and in patients who had baseline resistance to NS5A inhibitors, especially if 
infected with GT1a. Hence, low SVR12 rates were primarily associated with GT1a, >800,000 IU/mL 
and NS5A resistance associated with > 5-fold shift in EBR activity (~5% TN GT1a). 
The applicant concluded, based heavily on GT1 data, that the viral response to EBR/GZR 100/50 mg is 
relatively insensitive to variations in exposure at the recommended doses and regimens. These 
analyses were concluded to be useful but they did not adequately support the lower bounds of the 
applicant’s interpretive criteria for effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on GZR and EBR GMRs. In 
addition, there was concern that combinations of factors would result in drops in exposures giving low 
GMRs for both GZR and EBR simultaneously.  
Exposure-safety analyses – applicant’s upper acceptance bounds applied to PK 
In Phase 2 TN non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic patients with GT1 GZR doses of 400 mg or 800 mg, each with 
PR, was associated with ALT/AST >5 x ULN after TW4 following prior on-treatment normalisation 
between TW2 and TW4. The GZR AUC0-24 was particularly well correlated with these Late ALT/AST 
Elevation Events. In the applicant’s defined hepatic safety pool of 2405 patients who received at least 
8 weeks EBR/GZR at the proposed dose there were 25 (1%) with such an event. 
For GZR 100 mg QD the actual and predicted GM steady-state exposures in the applicant’s reference 
population of HCV-infected patients were similar. A 5-fold increase in GZR AUC0-24 relative to the 
reference population corresponded to a predicted population Late ALT/AST Elevation Event rate of 
~2%, on which basis the applicant considers that the upper margin applied to interpretation of GMRs 
(5-fold) is justified. An event rate of 5% was predicted at a GM AUC0-24 ~ 23.7 μM.h, which 
represents an exposure margin ~14-fold the GM with 100 mg doses in the reference population and 
~11-fold that in a broader population. 
Higher than average GZR and/or EBR exposures are predicted in patients on strong/moderate CYP3A 
inhibitors, females, Asians, elderly, patients with mild hepatic impairment and compensated cirrhosis 
or renal impairment/severe CKD. The GZR fold-exposures in some of these subgroups are modest yet 
the rates of late ALT elevations were: 
•  Higher in females (1.7%) vs. males (0.2%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 94/151 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Higher in Asians (2.4%) and blacks (0.9%) compared to whites (0.5%). 
•  Higher in those aged >65 years (1.6%) vs. <65 years (0.7%). 
•  Higher when BMI was <25 kg/m2 (1.1%) vs. >25 kg/m2 (0.5%). 
It can be anticipated that the risk increases when multiple factors are combined. 
Although late ALT elevation events are of concern, most patients completed treatment and there was 
resolution in all cases during or after treatment. For other AEs the patterns between subgroups 
predicted and not predicted to have higher than average exposures did not appear to be markedly 
different between patients who received EBR/GZR and those who received placebo (two studies had a 
placebo control). 
The SmPC includes contraindications related to GZR exposures >5-fold the reference population. 
Warnings and/or or statements that co-administration is not recommended were introduced regarding 
factors that increase exposure to ~3-<5-fold. Amendments were also made to better manage the 
influence of factors that reduce exposure to GZR and/or EBR. 
EBR 50 mg daily had no dose-related safety findings and Phase 1 studies using higher EBR doses 
indicated no limiting toxicity. Therefore the applicant’s upper bound of 2-fold for EBR appeared to be 
acceptable. In any event, the contraindications and warnings applied based on GZR exposures cover 
any concerns that could be raised from the effects on EBR exposures.

During the procedure additional efficacy data were provided as follows: 
•  SVR24 results were reported from studies in which SVR12 data were previously reported. In 
several cases the SVR12 data were also revised to include data not previously available but 
resulted in very minor changes. 
•  SVR12 and SVR24 results were reported from the deferred treatment groups (DTG) of studies 
052 and 060 and were compared to those reported for ITG. 
•  SVR12 data were reported from study 062, a Phase 3 study in 301 HCV-infected patients on 
opiate substitution therapy (OST). 
Common features  
The common features of these studies were: 
•  GZR and EBR were taken without regard to food.  
•  Ribavirin (RBV) dosing (where used) was weight-based and was taken BID with food using 
SmPC-recommended dose adjustment if needed. 
•  Genotyping of HCV was commonly based on the line probe assay (LiPA) in Phase 2 and Abbott 
RealTime HCV Genotype II test for Phase 3. Sequencing part of the NS5B region, followed by 
either BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) analysis or phylogenetic analysis. The latter 
process (NS5B mini-amplicon sequencing) was used for confirmatory genotyping. Testing was 
at centralised laboratories and discordances were reported in CSRs. GT6 cannot be accurate 
genotyping by LiPA so NS5B sequencing was performed for all cases.  
• 
Plasma HCV RNA levels were measured using the Roche COBAS™ Taqman™ HCV Test v2.0 
(HPS), with LLOQ of 25 IU/mL and LOD of 9.3 IU/mL in Phase 2 and version with version with 
and LLOQ and LOD of 15 IU/mL applied for Phase 3. The eligibility cut-off was > 10,000 IU/mL. 
•  SVR12 was defined as HCV RNA <25 IU/mL (either TD[u] or TND) 12 weeks post all therapy. 
• 
• 
Those with HCV RNA ≥ 25 IU/mL in Phase 2 or >15 IU/mL in Phase 3 (TD[q]) at TW4 
confirmed within 2 weeks were discontinued. 
The HCV NS3 and NS5A genes were amplified using RT-PCR followed by population 
sequencing. The limit of variant detection in the population was >25% of the viral population.

Design features 
Other design features were: 
• 
• 
• 
In study 060 patients were HCV TN, non-cirrhotic or cirrhotic and infected with GT1, GT4 or 
GT6. Patients with decompensated liver disease (manifested by the presence or history of 
ascites, oesophageal or gastric variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy or other signs or 
symptoms of advanced liver disease) and cirrhotic patients with a CPT score > 6 were 
excluded. 
In study 061 patients were HCV TN and co-infected with HCV GT1, GT4 or GT6. About 20% 
were to have compensated cirrhosis. 
In study 068 patients were HCV TE, non-cirrhotic or cirrhotic (compensated) and infected with 
GT1, GT4 or GT6. They were null responders, partial responders or relapsers.  
Histories of alcohol abuse, malignancy or HBV co-infection were exclusion criteria in all studies. Co-
infection with HIV was an exclusion criterion in study 060.

Non-response:  HCV RNA detected at end of treatment without HCV RNA < LLOQ on treatment 
Rebound: >1 log10 IU/mL increase in HCV RNA from nadir while on treatment and confirmed from a 
separate blood draw within 2 weeks 
Virologic breakthrough: confirmed (as above) HCV RNA ≥  LLOQ [TD (q)] after being < LLOQ 
previously while on treatment  
Relapse: confirmed (as above) HCV RNA ≥  LLOQ [TD (q)] following end of all study therapy, after 
becoming undetectable (TND) at end of treatment

•  Study 060 planned to randomise ~ 400 patients with ~ 300 in the immediate treatment arm. 
Assuming a response rate of at least 85% in the immediate treatment arm, the study had over

99% power to demonstrate that the SVR12 rate was superior to the reference rate of 73% at 
an overall one-sided 2.5% alpha-level. The calculation was based on SAS PROC POWER based 
on a ztest using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. 
•  Study 061 planned to enrol ~ 200 patients without stratification but enrolment was managed 
to ensure that ~20% had compensated cirrhosis. Assuming a true response rate of at least 
85%, the study had over 99% power to demonstrate that the SVR12 rate is superior to the 
historical reference rate of 70% at an overall one-sided 2.5% alpha-level. 
•  Study 068 planned to enrol ~ 400 patients to provide ~ 100 per treatment group. There was 
99% power to demonstrate that the SVR12 rate in at least one of the arms was superior to 
58% at an overall 0.05 alpha level. The power calculation was based on the assumption of an 
underlying response rate of at least 80%. 
•  Study 060 was double blind up to 4 weeks post-treatment, at which time the placebo group 
received open-label EBR/GZR. Randomisation (ratio 3:1) was stratified by cirrhosis and HCV 
GT.  
•  Study 061 was open label and not randomised. 
•  Study 068 was open-label except that the investigators and patients were blinded to the 
assigned treatment duration through TW12. Patients were randomised (1:1:1:1) to receive 
EBR/GZR for 12 weeks ± RBV or for 16 weeks ± RBV. Randomisation was stratified by 
cirrhotic/non-cirrhotic and by prior PR treatment response. Enrolment was managed to ensure 
the majority had GT1.  
Analysis populations 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS; all treated) was the primary population for the analysis of efficacy. The Per-
Protocol (PP) population was used for a sensitivity analysis of SVR12 and for analyses of secondary 
efficacy endpoints.  
Analysis for efficacy endpoints  
There were 3 types of missing data handled by different approaches: 
1.  Intermittent missing: If a missing data point was immediately preceded and followed by non-
missing HCV RNA outcomes, the missing value was imputed as the worst outcome of the two.  
2.  Non-intermittent missing related to the study drug: patients with missing values due to 
premature study discontinuations for treatment-related reasons were considered as treatment 
failures. 
3.  Non-intermittent missing unrelated to the study drug: missing data due to premature study 
discontinuations with reasons unrelated to treatment (such as loss to follow-up, protocol 
violation, withdrawal of consent, administrative reasons) were imputed as M=F in the primary 
analysis of SVR12 rates. For the HCV RNA results, data following this type of withdrawal from 
study were excluded from the analysis. Sensitivity analyses using M=F were also planned.

Results 
In each study the treatment and study completion rates were very high. Generally the demographics 
were balanced between groups in the studies that included a placebo control. The results for study 062 
were very similar to those for previously reported studies, indicating that adherence was high in the 
opiate-dependent population.  
Summary of cirrhotic patients 
The Phase 2/3 studies with EBR/GZR 50/100 mg were confined to non-cirrhotic patients and 402 Child 
Pugh A compensated cirrhotic patients. The majority had GT1a (54.5%; 37.8% had GT1b) and 58% 
had failed prior peg-IFN/ribavirin ±1st generation PIs. Regarding features of these patients with Child 
Pugh A compensated cirrhosis: 
• 
Thrombocytopenia: 25.1% had a platelet count below 100,000 /µL. In the GT1a and GT1b 
populations the proportions with < 100,000 platelets/µL were 19.6% and 30.3%, respectively.  
•  Hypoalbuminaemia: 6.2% (6.9% GT1a and 5.9% GT1b) had albumin <3.5 g/dL at baseline 
(<3.0 g/dL was an exclusion criterion).  
• 
INR: 24.9% (21.0% GT1a and 27.6% GT1b) had an INR >ULN at baseline but none was >1.7. 
•  Severity of Fibrosis: the most common method for diagnosis of cirrhosis was Fibroscan (64% of 
cirrhotics). Among those with an entry Fibroscan, 36.1% had a score > 25.0 kilopascals 
(31.7% GT1a and 36.4% GT1b). 
Summary of efficacy for GT1 and GT4 
Efficacy data are presented below by GT and potential prognostic parameters for the pooled Resistance 
Analysis Population (RAP), which includes patients from Phase 2 or 3 trials who achieved SVR12 or met 
criteria for virologic failure and for whom baseline sequencing data was available. The RAP does not 
include any subject who discontinued the study for reasons other than virologic failure.  
GT1a - Tables 29 and 30 show that SVR12 rates were similar for non-cirrhotic (94.7% for 12 weeks 
EBR/GZR) and cirrhotic patients (95.4% for 12 weeks EBR/GZR) and 100% for all patients who 
received 16 or 18 weeks of EBR/GZR with RBV.

For 12 weeks EBR/GZR alone the factor that had the largest impact on efficacy was the presence of 
baseline NS5A RAVs. The impact of baseline viral load was most apparent using a viral load cut-off of 
800,000 IU/mL. Among all GT1a-infected subjects with baseline viral HCV RNA ≤ 800,000 IU/mL, one 
non-cirrhotic and no cirrhotic patients failed to achieve SVR12.  
Logistic regression showed an interaction between baseline viral load and the presence of NS5A RAVs 
on efficacy such that loads >800,000 IU/mL had an impact on SVR12 only in the presence of baseline 
NS5A RAVs which conferred >5-fold resistance to EBR. The applicant pointed out that it is not practical 
to base treatment recommendations on NS5A RAV status at baseline. Currently, there are no 
commercial assays available for HCV resistance testing in Europe. In academic centres able to test for 
NS5A RAVs the methodologies and interpretation of results are not standardised. The reported 
prevalence of RAVs and magnitude of impact of baseline NS5A RAVs on efficacy varies according to the 
methodology used to detect RAVs (population sequencing vs. next generation sequencing or NGS), the 
sensitivity threshold applied and the specific NS5A substitutions included in the RAV analysis.  
For example, using population sequencing, <10% of patients in the EBR/GZR trials were found to 
harbour specific NS5A variants at baseline that either reduce the activity of EBR in vitro or were 
observed in virologic failures. In this small number, the presence of these specific RAVs at baseline had 
an impact on the efficacy of 12 weeks EBR/GZR. 
When the same population was analysed using NGS with a 1% sensitivity threshold and a broader 
definition of “RAVs” more than a third of patients had baseline “RAVs” but >90% achieved SVR12.  
Until a consensus is reached on the detection and interpretation of baseline RAVs, deriving guidance 
parameters based on NS5A resistance testing is not a feasible approach. In addition, in the pooled 
efficacy population baseline NS5A RAVs that conferred >5-fold resistance to EBR were found in 5.3% 
TN and 7.8% TE GT1a-infected patients of which ~50% achieved SRV12. Therefore baseline testing for 
RAVs would only predict about half of the failures. 
Baseline viral load ≤800,000 IU/mL appeared to be a useful parameter to determine which GT1a-
infected subjects should be treated with a 12 week EBR/GZR regimen. This sub-group represented 
25% of the GT1a-infected population. The SVR12 rate for 12 weeks EBR/GZR was 93% for those with 
>800,000 IU/mL. If this viral load cut-off was used for determining which patients receive 16 weeks 
EBR/GZR + RBV ~70% would be over-treated.  
Additional analyses were conducted to further explore the effects of baseline viral load and cirrhotic 
status using the RAP. High baseline viral load resulted in numerically lower SVR12 rates among GT1a-
infected patients who received 12 weeks EBR/GZR in each of the viral load strata. No virologic failures 
occurred in those who received 16 or 18 weeks of EBR/GZR with RBV. To further examine the impact 
of baseline HCV RNA a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was created. Of the 506 GT1a-
infected patients in the RAP, 480 (94.9%) achieved SVR12. The threshold (cut-off) that maximised the 
diagnostic performance (using Youden Index) was 1.17 million for baseline HCV RNA. This threshold 
had high specificity (92.3%) but low sensitivity (36.0%), with a high positive predictive value (98.9%) 
and low negative predictive value (7.3%). The accuracy of this threshold was very low at 38.9%. Of 
the 331 with baseline viral load >1.17 million, 307 (93%) achieved SVR12, which corresponds to over-
treating 61% (307/506) of the entire population. 
In addition, data on GT1b is shown in Tables 35-38 as shown for GT1a.

The applicant concluded that 12 weeks EBR/GZR is appropriate for all GT1b-infected patients.  
GT4 - 12 weeks of EBR/GZR resulted in two patients failing to achieve SVR12 whereas all patients who

the virological data supported the use of the same posology for GT4 and GT1a-infected patients.

Baseline and treatment emergent RAVs 
Study 060  
The baseline prevalence of GT1 NS3 RAVs commonly associated with resistance to first generation PIs 
was 39.6% (86 GT1a and 25 GT1b). RAVs associated with >5-fold lower susceptibility to GZR occurred 
in 1.1% (3/280), all of which were D168E in GT1b and two were in cirrhotic patients. There was no 
association between baseline GT1 NS3 RAVs and virologic failure. The Q80K mutation was detected in 
61/151 (40.4%) GT1a and in 2/129 (1.6%) GT1b but there was no association with treatment 
response. Baseline variants commonly associated with resistance to first generation PIs occurred in 
7/18 (38.9%) with GT4 and all achieved SVR12.  
Based on in-vitro GT1a replicon data, >5-fold reduced susceptibility to EBR occurred with M/L28T/A, 
Q/R30E/H/R/G/K/L/D, L31M/V/F, H58D and Y93C/H. In GT1 37/284 (13.0%) had one or more baseline 
RAVs at these loci and SVR12 was achieved in 28/37 (75.7%) vs. 245/247 (99.2%) without RAVs. For 
RAVs causing ≤5-fold shifts 10/11 achieved SVR12 compared to 18/26 with RAVs causing >5-fold 
shifts (Q30R, L31M and Y93C/H/S). For the 19/37 with GT1a SVR12 was achieved in only 11/19 
(57.9%) but for the 18/37 with GT1b only one did not achieve SVR12. 
In the FAS population with baseline viral load > 800,000 IU/mL, SVR12 was achieved in 183/189 
(96.8%) without vs. 22/33 (66.7%) with NS5A RAVs at baseline. For GT1a the respective rates were 
94/98 (95.9%) vs. 7/16 (43.7%) but for GT1b rates were 80/81 (98.8%) vs. 11/12 (91.7%). Among 
the 13 RAP patients (10 GT1a, one GT1b) 6 GT1a failures had treatment-emergent NS3 RAVs 
associated with a >5-fold decrease in GZR susceptibility. Nine of the 10 GT1a failures and the GT1b 
failure had treatment-emergent NS5A RAVs at failure and all were associated with a >5-fold decrease 
in EBR susceptibility.  
Study 061 
The baseline prevalence of GT1 NS3 RAVs commonly associated with resistance to first generation PIs 
was 40.7%. One GT1b virus had a RAV associated with >5-fold lower susceptibility to GZR (D168E). 
There was no association between baseline GT1 NS3 RAVs and virologic failure. 
In GT1 15/183 (8%) had one or more baseline RAVs and 9 (5%) had RAVs associated with >5-fold 
loss of EBR activity (12% in GT1b vs. 7% GT1a). The most common were M28V, Q30H/L/R, L31M, and 
Y93C/H/S. Rates were similar in cirrhotics and non-cirrhotics. SVR12 was achieved in 13/15 (86.7%; 
8/10 GT1a and 5/5 GT1b) vs. 164/168 (97.6%) without RAVs. For RAVs causing >5-fold shifts there 
was an impact on SVR12 rates for GT1a but not GT1b.  
Study 068 
The baseline prevalence of GT1 NS3 RAVs commonly associated with resistance to first generation PIs 
was 33.2% (123/370) and one GT1b virus had a RAV associated with >5-fold lower susceptibility to 
GZR (D168E) but the patient achieved SVR12. There was no clear association between baseline GT1 
NS3 RAVs and virologic failure. 
There were 50 patients (13.5%) infected with GT1 harbouring one or more baseline NS5A RAVs of 
which 40 (10.8%) had RAVs associated with > 5-fold loss of EBR activity (12% of GT1b vs. 9% of 
GT1a). In the absence of NS5A RAVs the SVR12 rate was 99.4% but among those with RAVs 
associated with > 5-fold reduction in susceptibility the rate was 28/40 (70% overall; 52% for GT1a 
and 89% for GT1b). For GT1a (but not GT1b) there was an effect of adding RBV to the latter cases 
such that SVR12 rates were 7/10 with RBV and 4/11 without RBV (pooled across duration groups) as

well as an effect of duration (10/18 after 12 weeks but 18/22 after 16 weeks therapy; pooled across 
RBV groups). 
Nine of the 13 RAP patients (11 GT1a, 2 GT1b) had treatment-emergent NS3 RAVs and no patient had 
WT for both NS3 and NS5A at failure. There were 7/8 failures treated without RBV who had treatment-
emergent NS3 RAVs vs. 2/5 who received RBV. Eleven of 13 RAP patients (6 null responders) had 
NS5A treatment-emergent RAVs and 7/13 had Q30H/R. All 13 had RAVs associated with >5-fold 
reduced susceptibility at failure.  
Study 048 (all GT1 failures on prior DAA/PR) 
Of the 79 patients enrolled 30 had GT1a and 49 had GT1b. The mean time since prior treatment failure 
was similar for GT1a-infected and GT1b-infected patients (592 vs. 535 days). NS3 RAVs conferring 
either < or > a 5 fold reduction in GZR activity occurred in 45.6% (36/79) but only 4/78 (5.1%) had 
variants associated with a >5-fold shift in GZR activity and 3 achieved SVR12. Two of the 3 patients 
who failed to achieve SVR12 had baseline variants associated with ≤ 5-fold reduced susceptibility to 
GZR and one had the R155T variant associated with a >5-fold reduction in GZR activity. Two had NS5A 
variants that confer >5-fold reduced activity of EBR. 
Efficacy against GT3 
The data come only from study 074, which evaluated 4, 6, 8 or 12 weeks treatment with EBR/GZR 
(100/50 mg) and SOF (400 mg) in TN patients with GT1 or GT3, including compensated cirrhosis. 
In GT3 non-cirrhotic patients 8 or 12 weeks treatment was highly efficacious, as was 12 weeks 
treatment in those with cirrhosis.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Two of the applicant’s designated core studies were placebo-controlled (052 and 060). The others were 
uncontrolled, which was an acceptable approach at the time these studies were initiated due to lack of 
approved IFN-free regimens and anticipated severe difficulties of enrolment into DAA+PR controlled 
studies. HCV-RNA data were not generated in the placebo groups, which is acceptable since the 
spontaneous resolution rate of HCV is negligible. 
The asymptotic Wald test was planned and asymptotic (Wald) 95% CI were to be calculated when the 
protocols were written. Since very few patients did not achieve SVR12, in which case the asymptotic 
method might produce unreliable inferences, the 2-sided 1-sample exact test was used instead and the 
Clopper-Pearson method was then used to construct the 95% confidence intervals for the SVR12 rate. 
This change in the method of analysis after seeing the results can be accepted in this case because it 
led the data being analysed with an exact method that is generally more conservative than the 
asymptotic method. Furthermore the statistical assessor has repeated the analysis with the originally 
planned method and the results are practically the same, varying by less than 1% in all studies.  
The FAS population served as the primary population for the analysis of efficacy except that 052 used 
the mFAS population, which gave results almost identical to the FAS. Missing SVR12 results were 
usually imputed as clinical failures, which is the preferred option. 
The different studies had different thresholds for success intended to show that EBR/GZR-containing 
regimens provided SVR12 rates superior to those described using available treatments. Some of these 
criteria may be questionable but in reality this does not matter since the applicant’s claims are based 
on studies in which the observed SVR12 rates and lower bounds of the 95% CI are all very high. Since 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 120/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
there were no randomised active-controlled studies it is not appropriate to comment on how EBR/GZR 
may compare to recently-approved IFN-free regimens. 
Study 068 used an exact one-sided test for a binomial proportion to test whether at least one of the 
treatment arms had an SVR12 rate of at least 58%. For each test, a one-sided alpha-level of 0.0125 
was used to control for multiplicity. The use of a one-sided alpha of 0.0125 does not adequately 
control the type I error at 2.5% one-sided. Nevertheless if 2.5% was to be divided by the 4 
comparisons, this would give a significance level of 0.00625 and all the p-values lie below this. Hence 
the results can be considered statistically significant and a response rate as low as 58% has been 
excluded.  
Pooling across treatment durations, the difference in SVR12 rates between patients who received RBV 
and those who did not was 3.3% (95% CI -1.3%, 8.2%), which supports the conclusion that addition 
of RBV does not substantially increase SVR12 rates. Pooling regimens with and without RBV for a given 
treatment duration, the difference in SVR12 rates for 12 vs. 16 weeks treatment was 1.5% (95% CI -
3.2%, 6.3%), which supports a conclusion that 16 weeks did not substantially increase SVR12 rates. 
However, as acknowledged by the applicant, those who received 16 weeks with RBV had the highest 
SVR12 rate. See below for further discussion of the posology.   
Genotyping 
The LiPA Assay from Versant (2.0) and the Abbott HCV Genotype test were performed at a central 
laboratory in Phase 2 a Phase 3 programmes respectively while the NS5B mini-amplicon was used for 
confirmatory typing. The latter targets a different region of the virus so that discordance between the 
two is possible. In addition, there have been instances in the trials of patients with GT2 based on LiPA 
who were subsequently identified as GT1b by NS5B mini-amplicon followed by either BLAST (basic 
local alignment search tool) analysis or phylogenetic analysis. These patients were thought to have 
recombinant virus, i.e. with a sequence similar to GT2 at the 5’UTR but a sequence at the NS5B region 
that is homologous to GT1. 
HCV polymorphisms  
Baseline substitutions that impacted on SVR12 rates in GT1, 3 and 4 were confined to NS5A. Baseline 
NS5A polymorphisms in GT1a that confer >5 fold reductions in EBR activity in vitro were identified in 
<10% of TN and TE patients but their presence reduced SVR12 from 98% and 99% to 55% and 50% 
in respective subgroups. NS5A RAVs that result in > 5-fold shift in EBR activity were associated with a 
greater reduction in SVR12 vs. those associated with < 5-fold shift. Also, the presence of baseline 
NS5A resistance had a greater impact on SVR12 for GT1a compared to the other genotypes.  
In patients with GT1, 4 and 6 resistance analyses were conducted for 54 virologic failures for which 
sequence data were available (7 with on treatment virologic failure, 47 with post treatment relapse). 
Treatment-emergent substitutions were detected in both HCV drug targets in 23/37 (62%) genotype 
1a, 1/8 (13%) genotype 1b, 2/5 (40%) genotype 4 and 1/4 (25%) genotype 6 subjects. 
Proposed posology by patient sub-group 
The CHMP considered as not appropriate or desirable to approve a new treatment for HCV with 
posology that is based on the prior response to PR or to a first generation PI with PR, which was the 
basis of the applicant’s initial proposal for defining regimens.  
Compensated cirrhosis (CP-A only) does not impact on the efficacy of EBR/GZR after controlling for 
presence of NS5A RAVs and baseline viral load. In reality, this likely reflects the fact that a minority of 
the cirrhotic patients treated were at the more severe end of the spectrum. 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 121/151 
 
 
 
 
 
The most reliable regimen for all patients, regardless of GT, NS5A variants or viral load, was 16 weeks 
EBR/GZR with RBV. Nevertheless, there was reluctance to impose this regimen on all patients suitable 
for treatment with EBR/GZR if a shorter regimen of EBR/GZR alone appeared to be very reliable for a 
specific patient sub-population.  
GT1a and GT4 
The evidence supported the use of the same regimens for GT1a and GT4. 
The data suggested two regimens for GT1a, regardless of cirrhotic status, but specifying in section 4.2 
that the recommendations apply only to patients with compensated cirrhosis (CP-A only):  
EBR/GZR for 12 weeks for all patients with baseline loads ≤  800,000; there seems to be no 
appreciable benefit for extending treatment to 16 weeks or adding RBV in these patients 
EBR/GZR + RBV for 16 weeks to be considered but not mandated for all other patients, i.e. all with > 
800,000 IU/mL (GT1a and GT4) and/or NS5A RAVs (GT1a) 
This position takes into account the data on persistence of NS5A RAVs in failures and the potential for 
cross-resistance with currently approved NS5A inhibitors. The applicant accepted this posology during 
the procedure. 
GT1b 
It was agreed that 12 weeks EBR/GZR could be the regimen for GT1b regardless of other factors. It 
was acknowledged that there will be a few patients with NS5A RAVs who would have benefitted from 
addition of RBV and treatment for 16 weeks. However, there was slightly less concern about RAV 
persistence in GT1b failures and there seemed to be a lesser effect of viral load.  
GT3 
The applicant’s proposed posology for 12 weeks EBR/GZR+SOF to treat GT3 regardless of cirrhosis was 
based on the 96.6% (28/29) SVR12 rate (pooling 8 and 12 weeks regimens) in non-cirrhotics and the 
91% rate (10/11) in cirrhotic patients. However, there was concern regarding the in-vitro data, the 
monotherapy efficacy data and, especially, the prior poor results (high relapse rate) when EBR/GZR 
plus RBV was given for 12 weeks to GT3 patients. Based on these CHMP recommendations, the 
applicant withdrew the proposed posology for GT3 during the procedure. 
Other issues 
In Study 052 a heterogeneous group of patients infected with GT1 and with eGFR < 30 
mL/min/1.73m2 (majority on HD) received EBR/GZR 50/100 mg QD for 12 weeks. About half had 
GT1a and HCV RNA > 800,000 IU/mL, 6.0% had cirrhosis and most were TN (80.4%). SVR12 was 
achieved in 115/116 (99.1%; 95.3, 100). These data suggest that EBR/GZR regimens selected on the 
basis of viral and host factors to be determined can be applied to patients with or without CKD.  
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
EBR/GZR demonstrated in the various regimens proposed by sub-population is associated with high 
SVR12 rates. The lack of comparison with active control was considered acceptable since there is 
negligible spontaneous resolution of chronic HCV infection and there were no approved DAA-only 
containing regimens at the time that the programme was initiated. The approach to the statistical 
analyses of these uncontrolled efficacy data was acceptable. The different studies had different 
thresholds for success intended to show that EBR/GZR-containing regimens provided SVR12 rates 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 122/151 
 
 
 
 
 
superior to those described using available treatments. Although EBR/GZR is clearly effective, basing 
regimen selection on treatment history was not a useful or appropriate approach. The SmPC includes 
the regimen selection based on virological factors. The data support use of 12 weeks EBR/GZR for 
GT1b infections and for GT1a or GT4 infections when the baseline viral load is <800,000 IU/mL. This 
regimen may also be used for GT1a when none of a list of selected NS5A RAVs is present (if testing is 
done). To safeguard response rates in case of baseline RAVs in GT1a viruses and to minimise the risk 
of selecting for resistance 16 weeks plus RBV may be considered for GT1a and GT4 when baseline viral 
load is >800,000 IU/mL or, for GT1a, when selected NS5A RAVs have been detected. These regimens 
appear to be suitable for patients who have compensated cirrhosis (CP-A only), are HIV co-infected or 
have CKD. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
There were 1,234 subjects enrolled and dosed with either EBR or GZR in Phase I studies and 3163 
HCV-infected patients received at least one dose of a GZR-containing regimen or placebo in the Phase 
2/3 studies. Additional safety data were provided during the procedure from the ongoing studies.

(± RBV) the most frequently reported (in >10%) AEs were fatigue (17.0%) and headache (16.4%) 
with rates that were slightly lower without RBV. In the placebo group the most frequently reported AEs 
were headache (18.1%) and fatigue (17.1%). For EBR/GZR (no RBV) the AE rates by SOC were 
comparable between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients and were also comparable with rates in 
cirrhotic patients who received placebo. For EBR/GZR (+ RBV) rates were generally higher in cirrhotic 
vs. non-cirrhotic patients but there was no clear difference in the distributions of particular AEs by 
SOC.

(1.5%) with one or more AEs in liver function analyses (15/1033 [1.5%] without and RBV 10/657 
[1.5%] with RBV). ALT and AST increased both occurred in 17/1690 [1.0%]). Also, 28/1690 (1.7%)

cirrhotic patients and the only marked difference was that nausea was less common in cirrhotic 
patients (9.2% vs. 4.2%). Drug-related AEs were reported in 50.8% of all patients in the ISP but rates

Among all who received EBR/GZR, drug-related hepatic and hepatobiliary disorders were reported in

SAEs 
In the pooled studies 060/061/068  
For EBR/GZR (no RBV) there were 15/639 (2.3%; none drug-related) patients who had non-fatal SAEs 
compared to 3/104 (2.9%; one drug-related) for EBR/GZR (+ RBV) and 3/105 (2.9%; none drug-
related) for placebo. The EBR/GZR patient with a drug-related SAE had two SAEs of abdominal pain 
and a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which occurred at TW6 and TW11, respectively. She completed 
12 weeks of therapy, her TIA resolved and she achieved SVR12 but the investigator considered the TIA 
to be drug-related. There was no clustering of SAEs in non-cirrhotic vs. cirrhotic patients or in mono-
infected vs. HIV co-infected patients. 
In the ISP  
Most (34/39) SAEs occurred in only one patient each, the exceptions being abdominal pain (3, one 
received RBV) and urinary tract infection (2, both received RBV). There was no clear relationship of 
non-fatal SAEs by SOC with treatment duration, cirrhosis status or HCV/HIV co-infection status. One 
patient who received EBR/GZR (no RBV) had drug-related SAEs compared to 3 who received EBR/GZR 
(+RBV), of which 2 were AEs associated with overdose, and none in the placebo group.  
The three SAEs additional to the one (TIA) described above that were considered by investigators to be 
drug-related included: 
•  A patient treated with EBR/GZR x 18 weeks with abdominal pain for which no cause was 
identified.  She completed treatment and achieved SVR12.  
•  A patient with HIV treated with EBR/GZR + RBV x 12 weeks with asthenia while inadvertently 
taking EBR/GZR BID for 2 weeks. The asthenia worsened to severe intensity after the dose 
error was corrected but it later improved and resolved. 
•  A patient treated with EBR/GZR + RBV x 16 weeks with anaemia associated with an accidental 
overdose (1000 mg/day instead of 800 mg/day). Her haemoglobin fell from > 15 to 10.9 g/dL 
and recovered after her RBV dose was corrected. She achieved SVR12. 
Deaths 
There were no deaths in Phase 1 or in Phase 2 dose-finding studies. Two patients in the pooled studies 
060/061/068 died. One patient had a malignant ventricular arrhythmia and was found dead at home at 
2 weeks post-EOT with autopsy-documented coronary disease. The other had a strangulated hernia at 
TW2 and died 2 days after a laparoscopic appendectomy. The conclusion from autopsy was death due 
to complications of gastroesophageal strangulation due to a hiatal hernia. In the ISP there were three 
deaths. The additional death concerned a motor vehicle accident but the patient was not driving at the 
time. 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation 
In the pooled studies 060/061/068  
Four of 639 (0.6%) treated with EBR/GZR (no RBV) discontinued due to an AE, including two 
discontinuations due to protocol-specified criteria (ALT or AST increased) that met the criteria for both 
Late ALT/AST Elevation Events and hepatic laboratory ECI criteria. The other two discontinued due to 
AEs of anxiety and palpitations or of ascites (patient died of peritonitis, sepsis and progressive renal 
failure 22 days after study medication discontinuation). One patient treated with EBR/GZR (+ RBV) 
due to an AE (affect lability) and one patient who received placebo discontinued due to a rash. Among

all patients in the 12-Week Safety Population Pool who received EBR/GZR (with or without RBV) the 
rate was 5/743 (0.7%) for discontinuations due to AEs. 
In the ISP 
Sixteen of 1690 (0.9%) patients discontinued due to an AE of which 3 discontinued due Late ALT/AST 
Elevation Events. Of the rest, discontinuations were due to AEs including anxiety (2), palpitations (2) 
and dyspnoea (2) or due to SAEs of ascites, atrial fibrillation and gastrointestinal inflammation (1 
each; none drug-related). In 8/16 the AEs were considered to be drug-related (3 discontinued RBV 
only). 
Laboratory findings 
In the pooled studies 060/061/068 
ALT and AST 
For EBR/GZR (no RBV) worsening ALT Grade 1.1-2.5 x from baseline occurred in 22/639 (3.4%) while 
2/639 (0.3%) reached >2.5-5.0 x baseline and 5/639 (0.8%) reached >5.0-fold. Grade 3 and Grade 4 
elevations that were worse than baseline occurred in 10 patients (5 each; 0.8%).  
For EBR/GZR (+ RBV) worsening ALT Grade from baseline occurred in only one patient with an 
increase >2.5-5.0 x baseline.  
The placebo group showed the common pattern of elevated ALT at baseline and worsening Grade from 
baseline, which occurred in 60/105 (57.1%).  
For EBR/GZR (no RBV) the mean ALT was >ULN at baseline (77.0 IU/L) and decreased by -48.3 IU/L 
by TW2. The decreases in ALT were maintained through follow-up week 4 (mean change -53.0 IU/L). 
For EBR/GZR (+ RBV) the baseline mean ALT (77.3 IU/L) decreased by -50 IU/L by TW2 and decreases 
were maintained through FW4 (mean change -56.4 IU/L). A similar pattern applied to the AST data.

Total Bilirubin 
The majority had total bilirubin levels WNL during treatment. Elevations were more frequent with 
EBR/GZR (+ RBV), usually in the first two weeks of therapy, and spontaneously resolved. Total 
bilirubin elevations were generally accompanied by declining ALT levels. No patient who received 
EBR/GZR (± RBV) and one who received placebo had ALT/AST >3x ULN concomitant with total 
bilirubin >2x ULN. Worsening of Grade from baseline occurred in 14/639 (2.2%) who received 
EBR/GZR (no RBV) and 26/104 (25%) who received additional RBV. In the latter, the time course was 
consistent with effects of hepatic bilirubin transporter saturation secondary to RBV-induced haemolysis. 
Grade 1 and Grade 2 elevations were more frequent among cirrhotic patients treated with EBR/GZR (+ 
RBV) but there was no such difference observed for EBR/GZR (no RBV). 
In the ISP (= Integrated Safety Pool - includes all subjects who received EBR (50 mg) and 
GZR (100 mg) as single entities or FDC) 
The majority had elevated ALT and AST at baseline. Following initiation of EBR/GZR (+/- RBV), 
ALT/AST levels usually declined in parallel with the decrease in HCV RNA. Grade 3 or 4 ALT/AST 
elevations were uncommon, mostly transient and few were associated with other hepatic laboratory 
evaluations or abdominal symptoms. The rates of Grade 3 elevations were similar to the rates for 
those treated with placebo but rates of Grade 4 ALT/AST elevations were higher vs. placebo.  
Among all patients who received GZR with EBR (± RBV), 26/1690 (1.5%) had Grade 3 or Grade 4 ALT 
elevations (25 occurring on treatment). Thirteen of these 26 experienced ALT >5x ULN in the setting of 
a Late ALT/AST Elevation Event (see further below). The majority of initial ALT >5x ULN values 
occurred after TW4. In 9/26 they occurred at TW1 and in the others between TW6 and TW12. One 
patient who received RBV experienced ALT>3x ULN concomitant with total bilirubin >2x ULN in the 
first two weeks of therapy. At the time of the total bilirubin elevation the ALT was declining. AST 
worsened by 2 or more Grades in 0.8%. 
Three patients had ALT or AST that increased >500 IU/L from baseline during treatment until the last 
day of follow up (up to FW24). All three received EBR/GZR (no RBV) of which two had a Late ALT/AST 
Elevation Event and discontinued study medication and one had a hepatic laboratory event of clinical 
interest (ECI).

Worsening ALT or AST Grade from baseline occurred slightly more frequently with longer durations of 
treatment but rates of Grade 1-4 elevations did not appear to differ according to treatment duration. 
Overall, there were no clear differences in worsening of ALT or AST Grade according to cirrhosis status, 
regardless of RBV co-administration. 
Late ALT/AST Elevation Events (>5xULN)  
Late ALT/AST Elevation Events are considered by the applicant to best describe GZR hepatic safety 
based on: 
The rate of Late ALT/AST Elevation Events increased with GZR >100 mg when given with PR. 
The majority of those who discontinued study medication for protocol-defined hepatic laboratory 
discontinuation criteria had Late ALT/AST Elevation Events.  
In the two placebo-controlled studies (060 and 052) Late ALT/AST Elevation Events were observed in 
patients who received EBR/GZR but not in the placebo group. In contrast, hepatic laboratory ECIs and 
discontinuations due to hepatic laboratory abnormalities occurred in both treatment groups. 
Late ALT/AST Elevation Events had the following features: 
Approximately half occurred at or after TW8 and the majority by TW10 but one-quarter were detected 
at TW12.  All resolved on treatment or post-treatment. Most were transient, resolving within 4 weeks 
and with mean duration of 2 weeks. 
Most were not associated with meaningful changes in other LFTs or with abdominal symptoms. 
• 
• 
In a minority there was a potential alternative non-study drug aetiology identified. 
Late ALT/AST Elevation Events occurred in <1% of total patients who received GZR 100 mg 
QD. 
•  Rates varied by intrinsic factors. Rates were higher in females (1.7% vs. males 0.2%), in 
Asians (2.4%) vs. blacks (0.9%) and whites (0.5%), in those aged >65 years (1.6%) vs. <65 
years (0.7%) and in those with BMI <25 kg/m2 (1.1%) vs. >25 kg/m2 (0.5%). There was no 
difference by cirrhosis status. 
•  23/25 patients with Late ALT/AST Elevation Events had ALT elevations >5x ULN and 2 had an 
AST elevation >5x ULN. The latter 2 were considered to have increased AST due to skeletal 
muscle breakdown, rather than hepatic injury. 
•  No patient who received GZR 100 mg had concomitant ALT/AST >3x ULN and total bilirubin 
>2x ULN that was consistent with hepatocellular injury. 
Of the 25 patients (any dose of GZR) who had Late ALT/AST Elevation (>5X ULN) Events: 
•  All achieved resolution to <5X ULN of which 14 (56.0%) did so before or at EOTAll achieved 
resolution to baseline ALT/AST levels and 6/25 (24.0%) did so before/at EOT 
•  23/25 (92%) achieved return to normal (≤ ULN) ALT/AST levels of which 5 did so before (3) or 
at (2) EOT and 18 did so after EOT. 
• 
Thus 2/25 did not return to normal ALT/AST levels by 24 weeks post-therapy or at last 
documented laboratory follow-up). One of these two patients had ALT baseline = 102 IU/L, 
peak = 391 IU/L (TW8), final = 62 IU/L (follow-up week [FW] 24), with ULN = 40 IU/L; AST 
Assessment report

Page 133/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
baseline = 60 IU/L, peak = 259 IU/L (TW8), final = 42 IU/L (FW24), with ULN = 43 IU/L. The 
other had ALT baseline = 45 IU/L, peak = 170 IU/L (TW12), final = 35 IU/L (FW4), with ULN = 
33 IU/L; AST baseline = 53 IU/L, peak = 133 IU/L (TW12), final = 45 IU/L (FW4), with ULN = 
36 IU/L. 
Late ALT/AST Elevation Events >5xULN by PK 
In 13 Phase 2 and 3 studies 2279 patients had available GZR PK data for analysis, of which 2236 had 
both PK and safety lab data for the evaluation of Late ALT/AST Elevation Events. This population 
includes 22/25 patients with Late ALT/AST Elevation Events, of which 14 (14/2004, 0.7%) received 
GZR 100 mg QD, 4 (4/41, 9.8%) 400 mg QD and 4 (4/36, 11.1%) 800 mg. There were no placebo 
group cases. 
The GZR steady state AUC0-24, Cmax and C2 were well correlated with Late ALT/AST Elevation 
Events. AUC0-24 appeared to be slightly more predictive than the other parameters. After dividing the 
population that received GZR 100 mg into two subgroups according to factors identified to increase 
AUCs, the predicted event rates were consistent with the observed rates. These exposure-response 
analyses suggested that a 5-fold increase in GZR AUC0-24 relative to the reference population 
corresponded to a predicted Late ALT/AST Elevation Event rate of ~2% vs. 0.5% in the reference 
population. The predicted ALT/AST Elevation Event rate reached 5% when at a GM GZR AUC0-24 ~ 
23.7 μM·hr, which is ~14-fold the value for 100 mg GZR in the reference population. Since GZR AUC0-
24 increases in a greater than dose proportional manner, a 5-fold increase vs. the reference population 
equates with exposure after a 200 mg GZR dose and a 14-fold increase equates with exposure after 
doses between 200 and 400 mg. 
Combinations of factors were considered using the POPPK models. The highest GZR exposures were 
predicted to occur in female Asian patients with cirrhosis with GMR [90% CI] of 3.63 [3.16, 4.17]) vs. 
the “reference” population of male white patients with no cirrhosis. Adding in additional effects of low 
weight (e.g. 53 kg) and increased age (e.g. 67 years) gave an estimated fold increase in GZR of 4.37 
[3.91, 4.89].  
If extrinsic factor effects were also to be considered in patients who have a combination of intrinsic 
factors, the use of moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP3A/P-gp may further increase GZR AUC. Based 
on the POPPK model the additional effect of moderate inhibitors of CYP3A/P-gp is estimated to result in 
a 32% increase in GZR AUC vs. those not using such agents who are not elderly, low-weight, Asian, 
cirrhotic and female. Combining this 32% increase with the estimated increase that results from the 
combination of all intrinsic factors leads to an estimated increase in GZR exposure of slightly greater 
than 5-fold and less than 6-fold vs. the reference population. This level of exposure is predicted to 
result in <3% probability of a Late ALT/AST Elevation Event of >5X ULN. 
In the POPPK dataset there were 89 (3%) patients who took moderate CYP3A inhibitors with GZR or 
GZR and EBR in Phase 2 and 3 studies. This population included some patients with intrinsic factors 
associated with increased GZR exposure, including 6 Asians, 4/6 were female and 2/6 aged > 65 
years. Co-administration of GZR and EBR with moderate CYP3A inhibitors did not appear to increase 
the incidence of AEs known to be associated with GZR and EBR. 
The effect of strong inhibitors of CYP3A/P-gp may be larger given the 3-fold increase in GZR AUC that 
was observed in healthy subjects following co-administration with ketoconazole. There are no clinical 
data to describe the effect of co-administration in HCV-infected patients. It is possible that a patient 
with all of the intrinsic factor effects associated with increases in GZR exposure who also uses a strong 
inhibitor of CYP3A/P-gp may have a ~10-fold increase in GZR AUC compared to the reference 
population, which has a predicted ~3.8% probability of a Late ALT/AST Elevation Event of >5X ULN.

Late ALT/AST elevations to >2-5xULN 
There were 52/2405 (2.2%) patients in the Hepatic Safety Population (HSP - includes all subjects who 
received GZR (any dose). This population includes a variety of regimens and GZR doses) who had an 
on-treatment late ALT/AST elevation to >2X to 5X ULN. In the placebo groups the rates for such 
elevations, reflecting the course of HCV without treatment, were 1.8% in study 052 and 3.8% in study 
060. Overall 30/52 30 (57.7%) had only ALT elevations, 5 (9.6%) had only AST elevations and 17 
(32.7%) had both ALT/AST (>2X to 5X ULN) elevations. 
•  46/52 (88.5%) were aged 18-64 years and 6 (11.5%) were ≥  65 years 
•  30 (57.7%) were male 
•  42 (80.8%) were White, 5 (9.6%) were Black and 3 (5.8%) were Asian 
•  26 (50.0%) received 100 mg GZR (22 without IFN) 
Furthermore, Late ALT/AST (>2X to 5X ULN) Elevation Events were observed to be >2X higher in: 
•  Asian males (3/109 [2.8%]) than in Asian females (0/103 [0%]) 
•  Black females (3/120 [2.5%]) than in Black males (2/210 [1.0%]) 
•  Non-Hispanics (48/2143 [2.2%]) vs. Hispanics

[2.0%]); confounded by the small number of events and concomitant GZR dose 
Those who received strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (52/2393 [2.2%]) vs. no such agents (0/12)  
Of the 52, 51 (98.1%) completed study medication. Late ALT/AST Elevations (>2X to 5X ULN) were 
noted at or prior to TW8 in 29 (56.8%) and at or prior to TW12 in 48 (94.1%). Individual logistic 
regression models were developed to assess the impact of these factors and of GZR dose, age, gender, 
race and Asian race. 
In one set of such analyses, GZR dose, age, gender, race (white, black or African- American, Asian or 
other) or Asian race (Asian or not-Asian) were analysed; only GZR dose was associated in a 
statistically significant manner with Late ALT/AST Elevation (>2X to 5X ULN) Events. 
Additional logistic regression analyses demonstrated that only IFN use (which is highly confounded 
with the effects of GZR dose) and concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (confounded by 
small subject numbers [n=4] and administration of >100 mg GZR doses in 3/4 cases) were statistically 
significantly (p<0.05) associated with Late ALT/AST Elevation (>2X to 5X ULN) Events. The use of 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors was not associated with a higher frequency of these laboratory abnormalities. 
The association of a limited number of clinical factors with an increased rate of such ALT/AST 
elevations were likely due to chance and/or confounding factors. The rate was similar to that observed 
in the placebo groups in two studies. In contrast, elevations to >5xULN were not observed in these 
placebo groups. Hence the definition of late elevations based on >5xULN in patients with normal 
baseline levels was discriminative for the effect of GZR.

There were no deaths in this subset. Discontinuations occurred in 3 patients in the 65-69 years 
bracket. Rates for AEs, drug-related AEs and SAEs were similar to placebo across the age brackets. 
Late elevations in ALT occurred in 3 patients aged 65-69 (1) and 70-74 (2) years, all of whom took 
EBR/GZR without RBV. 
Study 052 was confined to patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD). The applicant 
reported safety data from the ITG and DTG groups during the procedure. Overall and within each SOC 
the rates of AEs (including by PT) were similar or lower in the DTG group.

A non-cirrhotic, 53 year old African American male with GT1b infection who was not on HD 
discontinued due to interstitial nephritis. He had prior biopsy-proven membranous 
glomerulonephropathy, cryoglobulinaemia, nephrolithiasis and hypertension. At baseline the creatinine 
was 2.0 mg/dL and was 2.5 mg/dL at TW12 on placebo. Four weeks after starting EBR/GZR he was 
hospitalised with renal stones and therapy was discontinued at ~ week 6. Subsequent creatinine 
values were between 2.7 and 5.3 mg/dL. The last recorded value was 2.8 mg/dL. Renal biopsy initially 
showed interstitial nephritis and repeat renal biopsy showed membranous glomerulopathy.  
A 43 year old male Hispanic patient with GT1a and cirrhosis had a Hepatic ECI. ALT at end of placebo 
was 72 U/L. At TW8 of EBR/GZR ALT was 182 U/L (vs. baseline 55 U/L) but at TW12 it was 56 U/L and 
at FU4 it was 43 U/L. The patient had marked elevations of alkaline phosphatase, GGT and eosinophil 
counts as well as mild elevation of ALT, AST and bilirubin during placebo and EBR/GZR. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Use of CYP3A4 inhibitors 
In DDI studies CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors increased AUCs of GZR and EBR by ~ 3.3- and ~1.8-fold, 
respectively. Use of weak, moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors was permitted in Phase 2/3 studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 138/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the POPPK dataset there were 89 (3%) and 16 (0.6%) patients who took moderate and strong 
CYP3A inhibitors, respectively, with GZR or EBR/GZR. POPPK could not estimate the effect of strong 
CYP3A inhibitors but moderate CYP3A inhibitors were estimated to give GZR and EBR AUCs ~20% and 
30% higher. In the ISP 35/1690 patients took concomitant moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors with EBR/GZR 
(with or without RBV) and there was an increased rate of SAEs in these patients 6/35 (17.1%) vs. 
those who did not take moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (36/1655 [2.2%]). These differences were not 
present in the subset that took EBR/GZR (no RBV). The 6 who took moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and 
had SAEs did not appear to have EBR/GZR-related SAEs (skin ulcer, atrial fibrillation, gastrointestinal 
inflammation, colitis, infectious colitis and tibia fracture). Only 9 ISP patients took strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors.  
Use of statins 
On co-administration with GZR+EBR, the rosuvastatin AUC and Cmax were increased by 2.3- and 5.5-
fold, respectively, and atorvastatin AUC and Cmax were increased by 2- and 4-fold, respectively. 
Concomitant use of 10 mg QD of these statins was permitted in the Phase 2 and 3 studies. In the ISP 
34/1690 took any statin for at least 7 consecutive days with EBR/GZR (with or without RBV). Based on 
these very limited numbers, spread across a range of different statins, there was no clear difference in 
safety profile vs. those who did not take statins. 
Oral contraceptives including ethinyl oestradiol (EE) 
In separate DDI studies GZR and EBR had no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of EE 
and LNG after a single dose of Nordette (ethinyl estradiol [EE] 0.03 mg/levonorgestrel [LNG] 0.15 
mg). Plasma PK of GZR or EBR were not assessed but no DDI was anticipated. Contraceptive 
medications were allowed in the Phase 2 and 3 studies. For patients in the ISP pool with available PK 
estimates from POPPK modeling, the median GZR AUC for those who took OCPs concomitantly (N=35) 
was slightly lower than for those who did not (N=614).  
For the 35 female patients who took OCPs with EBR/GZR (with or without RBV) there were no clear 
differences in frequencies of AEs, drug-related AEs, SAEs or discontinuations vs. those women not 
taking OCPs. There were no meaningful differences in the incidence of AEs by SOC between the two 
groups. There were also no clear differences for any of the laboratory parameters evaluated, including 
ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase or INR. None of the 35 women had Grade 2, 3 or 4 
elevations in ALT, AST, total bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase. None of the 25 patients who 
experienced a late ALT/AST elevation (>5x ULN) were on any OCPs, including EE.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of EBR/GZR, with or without RBV, has been evaluated in a large and diverse population. The 
total size of the safety database is acceptable and it adequately covers patients with compensated 
cirrhosis (CP-A scores only).  
Leaving aside the hepatic events, EBR/GZR alone appears to have a benign safety profile. In particular 
it is notable that very few patients throughout the programme have failed to complete their assigned 
treatment periods. Addition of RBV confers the additional safety problems well known to be associated 
with this agent but even with RBV few patients discontinued due to AEs.  
Based on data from the two placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 studies several of the commonest AEs (such 
as fatigue, headache and nausea) have occurred at similar rates in EBR/GZR and placebo groups. The 
safety profile of EBR/GZR did show some differences according to baseline factors such as age, gender, 
race/ethnicity, cirrhosis, HCV/HIV co-infection or CKD but in the pooled data from 060/061/068 the 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 139/151 
 
 
 
 
 
patterns of differences between subgroups were similar to those observed in the placebo group. 
Extending the duration of treatment from 12 to 16 weeks did not lead to additional AEs or higher rates 
of AEs.  
Following the safety data obtained in the Phase 2 study 003, the applicant instituted a special hepatic 
monitoring programme. The focus was on Late ALT/AST Elevation Events (5xULN), as defined by the 
applicant, which were clearly related to GZR exposures. At the 100 mg dose, taking into account 
multiple forbidden concomitant medications in clinical trials, these events occurred in <1% of patients 
treated with GZR 100 mg. In the pooled analysis of studies 060/061/068 7/743 patients (~0.9%) had 
Late ALT/AST Elevation Events and in the ISP 13/1690 (0.8%) had Late ALT/AST Elevation Events. At 
this GZR dose (100 mg) no patient had concomitant ALT/AST >3x ULN and total bilirubin >2x ULN that 
was consistent with hepatocellular injury. Late ALT/AST Elevation Events generally occurred at or after 
TW8. Most have been short-lived and all so far have resolved. They were not accompanied by 
abnormalities of other tests of hepatic function or by liver-related symptoms.  
These Late ALT/AST Elevation Events may not per se lead to permanent hepatic damage but there is 
currently no clear explanation as to why they occur when they do. Also, the rate of these Late ALT/AST 
Elevation Events was increased by intrinsic factors that increase GZR exposures. In the Phase 2/3 
studies there were several forbidden concomitant medications known to increase GZR exposures. 
During the procedure the applicant updated the SmPC to better reflect the risks by describing rates 
GZR exposures by intrinsic factors, contraindicating use with OATP1B inhibitors (which could also 
potentially affect efficacy since they limit hepatic uptake of GZR) and adding adequate statements that 
use with CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors is not recommended. There remains a possibility that GZR exposures 
could be substantially increased when a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors tending to 
increase GZR exposure occurs in an individual patient when the occurrence of each factor alone would 
not necessarily cause concern. However, the final revised SmPC adequately reflects this risk. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of EBR/GZR 50/100 mg is generally benign. Increases in transaminases relatively 
late during treatment period are associated with higher than usual GZR plasma exposures. The 
underlying mechanism of these events is not understood at present but so far they have occurred at 
low rates and have resolved. This risk is considered to be manageable.

The applicant’s proposal for routine risk minimisation measures is considered sufficient to address 
these safety concerns. 
Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.3 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to omit EXP and Lot from the wallet labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons: 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 146/151 
 
 
 
 
 
The wallet has a window through which EXP and Lot are visible on the blister. Therefore, it was felt 
unnecessary to repeat this information on the wallet itself as it would appear through a window in the 
inner carton (the blister is glued within the inner wallet). 
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included 
in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, and translated in all languages but will 
appear in grey-shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.  
A request of translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
Due to the low production volumes, the QRD Group accepted the request for English only blister label 
(INN in English or Latin); however, the QRD Group requested that the invented name must also be 
added. The following information has been agreed to be displayed on the blister label: Invented name, 
INN (English or Latin), EXP, Lot and 2D code.  
In addition, because of space constraints, the QRD Group accepted the translation exemption request 
of EXP and Lot on the outer carton. 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
2.9.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Zepatier (elbasvir / grazoprevir) is included 
in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was 
not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The clinical programme has demonstrated that EBR/GZR in the various regimens proposed by sub-
population is associated with high SVR12 rates. The fact that there is no comparison with active 
controlled groups was acceptable at the time that the programme was initiated since there is negligible 
spontaneous resolution of chronic HCV infection and there were no approved DAA-only containing 
regimens. The approach to the statistical analyses of these uncontrolled efficacy data was acceptable. 
The different studies had different thresholds for success intended to show that EBR/GZR -containing 
regimens provided SVR12 rates superior to those described using available treatments. Some of these 
criteria may be questionable but in reality this does not matter since the applicant’s final claims are 
based on studies in which the observed SVR12 rates and lower bounds of the 95% CI are all very high.  
Although EBR/GZR is clearly effective, basing regimen selection on treatment history was not a useful 
or appropriate approach. The SmPC includes the regimen selection based on virological factors. The 
data support use of 12 weeks EBR/GZR for GT1b infections and for GT1a or GT4 infections when the 
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 147/151 
 
 
 
 
 
baseline viral load is <800,000 IU/mL. This regimen may also be used for GT1a when none of a list of 
selected NS5A RAVs is present (if testing is done). To safeguard response rates in case of baseline 
RAVs in GT1a viruses and to minimise the risk of selecting for resistance 16 weeks plus RBV may be 
considered for GT1a and GT4 when baseline viral load is >800,000 IU/mL or, for GT1a, when selected 
NS5A RAVs have been detected. These regimens appear to be suitable for patients who have 
compensated cirrhosis (CP-A only), are HIV co-infected or have CKD. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Risks 
There is very considerable potential for cross-resistance between each of GZR and EBR and other 
licensed agents in their respective classes but there are some exceptions. In addition, at least some 
further generation molecules in each class may not be affected by RAVs associated with markedly 
reduced susceptibility to GZR or EBR.  
So far there are few data available on the persistence of resistance-associated substitutions after 
failure of EBR/GZR but the available data indicate that treatment-emergent NS5A resistance-
associated substitutions have generally persisted for a long period whereas the majority of NS3 
resistance associated substitutions have not.  
There remain some concerns regarding the efficacy of EBR/GZR when plasma exposures are reduced 
to 40-50% of those in a reference HCV-infected patient. It is not possible to fully concur with the 
applicant that the viral response to EBR/GZR 100/50 mg is relatively insensitive to variations in 
exposure at the recommended doses and regimens. However, the concern can be somewhat be 
mitigated by that fact that the use of Zepatier with inducers of CYP3A or P-gp is contraindicated. 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety of EBR/GZR, with or without RBV, has been evaluated in a large and diverse population. The 
total size of the safety database is acceptable. Leaving aside the hepatic events, EBR/GZR alone 
appears to have a benign safety profile. Addition of RBV confers the additional safety problems well 
known to be associated with this agent.  
Following the safety data obtained in study 003 the applicant instituted a special hepatic monitoring 
programme. The focus has been on Late ALT/AST Elevation Events, which were clearly related to GZR 
exposures. At the 100 mg dose, taking into account multiple forbidden concomitant medications in 
clinical trials, these events occurred in <1% of patients treated with GZR 100 mg. In the pooled 
analysis of the three Phase 3 studies (060/061/068) seven out of 743 patients (~0.9%) had Late 
ALT/AST Elevation Events and in the ISP 13/1690 (0.8%) had Late ALT/AST Elevation Events. At this 
GZR dose (100 mg) no patient had concomitant ALT/AST >3x ULN and total bilirubin >2x ULN that was 
consistent with hepatocellular injury.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In the applicant’s defined hepatic safety pool of 2405 patients who received at least 8 weeks GZR there 
were 25 (1%) patients with a Late ALT/AST Elevation Event. These late events, which followed a period 
of normalisation on treatment, were not the only elevations in AST/ALT observed. There were 53 
patients with late elevations by 2-5-fold, while 36 patients had such an event and/or had a hepatic 
laboratory events of clinical interest (ECI) and/or discontinued treatment because they met the pre-
defined hepatic safety criteria.  
Assessment report  
EMA/419807/2016 
Page 148/151 
 
 
 
 
 
Late ALT/AST Elevation Events have generally occurred at or after TW8. They were not accompanied 
by abnormalities of other tests of hepatic function or by liver-related symptoms. Most have been short-
lived and all so far have resolved. The rate of these Late ALT/AST Elevation Events was higher in 
patients with intrinsic factors that increase GZR exposures. Thus far the applicant predicts a rate of 
<2% for any separate factor but a rate of 3.8% is predicted as possible for combinations of several 
intrinsic and extrinsic factors in the same patient. The mechanism behind such events, which occur 
after resolution of baseline abnormalities and while still on treatment, is unknown.  
The question then arises how important such elevations are to patient management and safety. Firstly, 
it appears that 20/25 such patients completed their assigned treatment. Secondly, there was 
resolution in all cases. Nevertheless, the rates that may be observed during routine use, when multiple 
factors that increase GZR exposures may co-exist despite contraindications and warnings in the SmPC, 
could be higher. Also, as more cases accrue it may be that not all fully resolve. As a consequence, in 
addition to the adequate wording in the SmPC, these issues will closely be followed in the post-
authorisation.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
EBR/GZR provides another DAA-only (IFN-free) regimen for treatment of HCV infections. The SVR12 
rates have been very high. The final proposed posology is based on virological factors and it is 
acceptable. 
Very few patients have discontinued treatment during clinical trials, indicating that in general adverse 
events have not prompted cessation of therapy. The factors that may lead to increased rates of hepatic 
events have been identified and to some extent controlled for in the SmPC but in routine use 
combinations of factors may lead to higher rates than reported from trials. RMP monitoring is 
important. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
EBR/GZR provides another DAA-only (IFN-free) regimen for treatment of HCV infections. The SVR12 
rates have been very high. Efficacy data support use of 12 weeks EBR/GZR for GT1b infections and for 
GT1a or GT4 infections when the baseline viral load is <800,000 IU/mL. This regimen may also be 
used for GT1a when none of selected NS5A RAVs are present. In case of baseline RAVs in GT1a viruses 
16 weeks plus RBV may be considered for GT1a and for GT4/ GT1a when baseline viral load is 
>800,000 IU/mL. 
The treatment regimen of 12 weeks EBR/GZR is suitable for patients who have compensated cirrhosis 
(CP-A only), HIV co-infection or have CKD. 
The safety profile of EBR/GZR is benign. Late ALT/AST Elevation Events have been observed which so 
far seems to be manageable as have a short duration, have resolved and were not accompanied by 
abnormalities of other tests of hepatic function or by liver-related symptoms. 
4.  Recommendations

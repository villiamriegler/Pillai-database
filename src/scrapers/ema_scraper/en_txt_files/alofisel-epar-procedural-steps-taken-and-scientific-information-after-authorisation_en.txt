of the MAH’s Global Safety Database. Furthermore, this 
variation updated section 4.2 of the SmPC and added the 
term `Perilesional` as an approved EDQM term. Sections 1, 
2.2, 3, 4.2, 6.5 and 6.6 of the SmPC were updated in order 
to replace the term “suspension for injection” for 
“dispersion for injection”, following the assessment of 
R/0036. The Annex A, Package Leaflet and Labelling are 
updated in accordance. The black triangle sign was 
removed, since the product doesn’t fall under the additional 
monitoring criteria anymore. For more information, please

the CAT and CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance 
and PL 
of Alofisel in the approved indication remains favourable 
and therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.  The MAH updated the 
RMP with the status of the ongoing Cx601 0303 study. 
Annex A of Alofisel was updated in order to reflect correct 
QRD terminology. The product information was updated in 
accordance with the latest QRD template and minor 
wording clarifications have also been included. Further, the 
MAH will update section 4.8 of the SmPC in a separate

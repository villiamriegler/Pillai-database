PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for ERLEADA (Apalutamide) 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan  (RMP)  for  ERLEADA.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of ERLEADA, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will 
be obtained about ERLEADA’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
ERLEADA's  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how ERLEADA should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for ERLEADA should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of ERLEADA’s 
RMP. 
I. 
The Medicine and What it is Used For 
ERLEADA is authorized for the treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
(NM-CRPC)  in  adult  men  who  are  at  high  risk  of  developing  metastatic  disease  and  for  the 
treatment of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in adult men in combination 
with  androgen  deprivation  therapy  (ADT)  (see  SmPC  for  the  full  indication).  It  contains 
apalutamide as the active substance and it is given as an oral tablet. 
Further information about the evaluation of ERLEADA’s benefits can be found in ERLEADA’s 
EPAR, including  in  its  plain-language summary,  available on the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/erleada. 
II. 
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or Further 
Characterize the Risks 
Important risks of ERLEADA, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about ERLEADA’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL and 
SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or without 
prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
analyzed  regularly,  including  Periodic  Benefit-Risk  Evaluation  Report/Periodic  Safety  Update 
Report assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of ERLEADA is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important  risks  of  ERLEADA  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks 
can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of ERLEADA. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the 
safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-
term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks 
Important Identified Risk: Seizures 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
In nonclinical studies in animals, apalutamide was given at high 
doses and seizures were observed. Seizures have also been reported 
in apalutamide clinical trials. As a precautionary measure, patients 
who had any prior history of seizure or had conditions that might 
predispose to seizures were excluded from clinical trials with 
apalutamide. Additionally, medications known to lower seizure 
threshold were also prohibited while on trial medication. Seizures 
are described in the current SmPC for ERLEADA. 
Some conditions that may predispose patients to seizures such as: 
infantile onset of seizures, masses or lesions in the brain, a prior 
history of seizures, or the use of certain medication that may lower 
the seizure threshold, may increase a patient’s risk of seizures when 
administered ERLEADA.

Important Identified Risk: Fall 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Fall is considered an important identified risk, based on clinical 
trial data in men with NM-CRPC (Trial ARN-509-003).  
In Trial ARN-509-003 (NM-CRPC population), 22.0% of 
apalutamide-treated subjects versus 9.5% of placebo-treated 
subjects experienced fall (clinical cut-off date of 1 February 2020). 
In Trial PCR3002 (mHSPC population), fall occurred with a 
similar frequency in the apalutamide (9.4%) and placebo (7.4%) 
arm (clinical cut-off date of 07 September 2020). 
Fall is described in the current SmPC for ERLEADA. 
Being older, being on prolonged ADT, potentially having impaired 
musculoskeletal function, and possibly being treated with multiple 
concomitant therapies, or having a combination of any of these 
variables, may place a patient at risk to fall.

Important Identified Risk: Non-pathological fracture 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Non-pathological fracture is considered an important identified 
risk, based on clinical trial data in men with NM-CRPC (Trial 
ARN-509-003).  
In Trial ARN-509-003 (NM-CRPC population), 18.1% of 
apalutamide-treated subjects versus 7.5% of placebo-treated 
subjects reported fracture (clinical cut-off date of 1 February 2020). 
In Trial PCR3002 (mHSPC population), fracture occurred for 
10.3% of subjects in the apalutamide arm and 5.9% in the placebo 
arm (clinical cut-off date of 07 September 2020). 
Non-pathological fracture is described in the current SmPC for 
ERLEADA. About half of the fractures reported in clinical trials 
(for both subjects treated with apalutamide and placebo) were 
reported within 7 days of a fall. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Androgen deprivation therapy is associated with significant bone 
loss and increased risk for low trauma or fragility fractures; effects 
are cumulative with prolonged use of ADT. In addition, as fall is 
likely to increase the risk of fractures, the following risk factors for 
fall are also risk factors for fractures: being older, potentially 
having impaired musculoskeletal function, and possibly being 
treated with multiple concomitant therapies, or having a 
combination of any of these variables.

Important Identified Risk: Ischemic heart disease 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Ischemic heart disease is considered an important identified risk, 
based on clinical trial data in men with mHSPC (Trial PCR3002).  
In Trial PCR3002 (mHSPC population), 5.9% of apalutamide-
treated subjects versus 2.3% of placebo-treated subjects 
experienced ischemic heart disease; the exposure-adjusted 
incidence (events per 100 person-years) was 3.3 versus 1.6. In Trial 
ARN-509-003 (NM-CRPC population), ischemic heart disease was 
reported in 5.5% of apalutamide-treated subjects versus 2.8% of 
placebo-treated subjects; the exposure-adjusted incidence was 
numerically lower in the apalutamide arm (2.5) as compared with 
the placebo arm (3.6). 
Ischemic heart disease is described in the current SmPC for 
ERLEADA. 
Risk factors for ischemic heart disease include hypertension, 
diabetes, and dyslipidemia.

Important Identified Risk: Ischemic cerebrovascular disorders 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Ischemic cerebrovascular disorders is considered an important 
identified risk based on clinical trial data in men with NM-CRPC 
(Trial ARN-509-003). 
In Trial ARN-509-003 (NM-CRPC population), 4.0% of 
apalutamide-treated subjects versus 1.0% of placebo-treated 
subjects experienced ischemic cerebrovascular disorders; the 
exposure-adjusted incidence (events per 100 person-years) was 1.9 
versus 0.9. In Trial PCR3002 (mHSPC population), ischemic 
cerebrovascular disorders were reported for 2.5% of subjects in the 
apalutamide group and 2.3% of subjects in the placebo group; the 
exposure-adjusted incidence was numerically the same for the 
apalutamide (1.3) and the placebo (1.3) arms. 
Ischemic cerebrovascular disorders is described in the current 
SmPC for ERLEADA.

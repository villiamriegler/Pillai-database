1.  Background information on the procedure  
1.1.  Submission of the dossier  
Novo Nordisk A/S submitted on 29 December 2020 an extension of the  marketing authorisation. 
Extension application to add a new strength of 2 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen. 
The MAH applied for a change or addition  of a new strength. 
The MAH applied for the  following indication for Ozempic the new strength: 
Ozempic is indicated for the treatment of adults with  insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus 
as an adjunct  to diet and exercise 
• 
as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or 
contraindications 
in addition to  other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes. 
• 
For trial results with  respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, 
and the populations studied, see sections 4.4,  4.5 and 5.1. 
Furthermore, the RMP is updated to version 6.1. 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC,  as amended - complete and independent application.

1234/2008,  (2)  point(s) (c) - Extensions of marketing authorisations 
1.3.  Information on Paediatric requirements  
Not  applicable, the currently approved Ozempic PIP (EMEA-001441-PIP01-13-M03)  has not  been 
updated since a new strength  does not trigger the paediatric regulation. The currently approved PIP is 
included in the application.   
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity  
1.4.1.  Similarity  
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000  and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000,  the MAH  did not submit  a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to  the proposed indication. 
1.5.  Scientific advice  
The MAH did not  seek Scientific advice at  the CHMP.

The CHMP, in the  light of the overall data submitted  and the scientific 
11 November 2021 
discussion within  the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting 
a marketing authorisation to  Ozempic on  
2.  Scientific discussion  
2.1.  Problem statement  
Semaglutide for once-weekly s.c. injection  (Ozempic) is approved worldwide for the treatment  of type 
2 diabetes (T2D) at maintenance doses of 0.5  mg and 1.0  mg. Treatment with  semaglutide improves 
glycaemic control, reduces body weight  and reduces cardiovascular risk. Additionally, semaglutide is 
being developed for weight  management using a once-weekly dose of 2.4 mg. 
A third maintenance dose of once-weekly semaglutide s.c. 2.0 mg is developed for patients  with T2D 
who may benefit from additional glucose-lowering and body weight loss as the  disease progresses. In 
this application,  data from the phase 3b Trial NN9535-4506  are presented to support the use of 
semaglutide 2.0 mg for the  treatment of T2D. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition  
The claimed indication is:  
Ozempic is indicated for the treatment of adults with  insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus 
as an adjunct  to diet and exercise 
• 
as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or 
contraindications 
• 
in addition to  other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes. 
For study results with  respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, 
and the populations studied, see sections 4.4,  4.5 and 5.1. 
The applicant has not  made any changes to the approved indication,  however, the posology with 
regards to increase in dose to  2.0 mg has been amended. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The global prevalence of diabetes is estimated to 9.3%  with the  majority being type 2  diabetes 
(reference: IDF 2019).  The estimated number of persons living with  diabetes in Europe is 59 million  in 
2019.  Systematic reviews indicate that  the relative risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is between 
1.6 and 2.6. 
T2D remains a substantial health care challenge with  a projected worldwide prevalence of 10.9%  (700 
million adults)  by 2045.  T2D is a progressive disease and persistent hyperglycaemia can lead to 
serious microvascular and macrovascular complications. Despite the availability of several treatments, 
optimising glycaemic control remains a challenge in many patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/21773/2022  
Page 8/60 
 
 
 
 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis  
Type 2 diabetes is a progressive metabolic disease primarily characterised by abnormal glucose 
metabolism. 
The pathophysiology of type 2  diabetes is characterised by chronic hyperglycaemia caused by insulin 
resistance in the  peripheral tissue, by reduced insulin  production in the pancreatic beta-cells and by 
increased hepatic glucose release.  
The pathogenesis is seemingly heterogeneous and also involves environmental, lifestyle, and genetic 
components. All of these factors contribute to chronic hyperglycaemia which, if left untreated,  is 
associated with  β-cell failure and increased risk of long-term micro-and macrovascular complications. 
Long-term glycaemic control is fundamental for the  management of type 2 diabetes to prevent/slow 
down progression of β-cell failure and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes-related complications. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Type 2 diabetes is chronic metabolic disease characterised by deficient insulin  activity arising from 
decreased insulin secretion secondary to β-cell insufficiency, compromised insulin action  in peripheral 
target tissue (insulin  resistance), or a combination of these. The abnormal metabolic state is 
exacerbated by excess glucagon secretion, excess hepatic glucose production, altered metabolism of 
protein and lipids, and reduced incretin effect.  
The symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop gradually. Blood tests will  be used to confirm the 
diagnosis. The tests  measure the amount of sugar, or glucose, in the  blood. The tests used are: 
Glycated haemoglobin (A1C) test  (gold standard), fasting plasma glucose test, random plasma glucose 
test and oral glucose tolerance test. 
2.1.5.  Management  
Several products are approved for the treatment type 2 diabetes: metformin, GLP-1 analogues, DPP4-
inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors,  sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and insulin.  
The ADA and EASD consensus report recommends a patient-centred approach for glycaemic 
management in  type 2 diabetes. Patient characteristics and preferences are important factors for 
individualising treatment goals and strategies. Individualised HbA1c target, indicators of high-risk or 
established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease or heart failure of a patient, 
risk of hypoglycaemia, body weight  and costs are main factors that should be considered in the 
treatment of patients with  type 2 diabetes. The main goal of all the  above-mentioned drug classes is to 
lower plasma glucose. However, even though  several classes are combined, the patients’ individualised 
goals are not always reached. 
2.2.  About the product  
Semaglutide is a glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1  RA). The specific modifications in the 
GLP-1 molecule are: 1) a modification in  position 8 (alanine to 2-aminoisobutyric acid) of the peptide 
backbone to increase stability against dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), and a change in position 34 from 
a lysine to an arginine to limit  the options for acylation to the  one remaining lysine in the  sequence; 2) 
a large hydrophilic spacer between the  lysine in position 26  and the gamma glutamate whereto the 
fatty acid is attached; 3) a C18 fatty di-acid with  a terminal acidic group. The spacer and the  fatty acid 
both contribute  to increased albumin binding, which  slows the  degradation of semaglutide in plasma 
Assessment report  
EMA/21773/2022  
Page 9/60 
 
 
 
and results in decreased renal clearance prolonging the half-life of semaglutide to  approximately 1 
week making it suitable for once weekly s.c. administration. 
Semaglutide 2.68  mg/ml solution for injection is a clear and colourless solution filled in a 3 ml 
cartridge, assembled in a PDS290 pen-injector. The PDS290 pen-injector for semaglutide 2.68 mg/ml 
delivers doses (each dose 0.74 ml)  of 2 mg (4  doses available).  
The active ingredient, semaglutide, is a GLP-1 analogue substituted  with  a fatty acid side chain. 
Semaglutide is produced using recombinant DNA technology in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) 
followed by chemical modification. The drug substance is identical to the already approved drug 
substance for Ozempic. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development  
Semaglutide has been investigated in  a comprehensive global clinical development programme 
(SUSTAIN) involving more than  11,000  subjects across 11 phase 3 trials, including a dedicated 
cardiovascular outcomes trial. In the SUSTAIN programme, semaglutide was investigated throughout 
the continuum  of T2D care, from monotherapy in drug naïve patients  with  short disease duration to 
combination use with one or more OADs or basal insulin in  patients in a later stage of T2D disease 
progression. Across the SUSTAIN trials, semaglutide demonstrated superior reduction in HbA1c and 
body weight  compared to placebo and several active comparators. The cardiovascular outcomes trial 
(SUSTAIN 6)  demonstrated a statistically significant  reduction in the risk of major adverse 
cardiovascular events compared to placebo in subjects with  T2D at high  risk of or established 
cardiovascular diseases. Semaglutide has a safety profile consistent with  the safety profile of the  GLP-1 
RA drug class.  
Two maintenance doses of semaglutide are currently approved for the treatment  of T2D: 0.5  mg and 
1.0 mg. Across the SUSTAIN programme, larger reductions in  HbA1c and body weight were consistently 
observed with semaglutide 1.0 mg than  with 0.5  mg. However, it  was observed that  20-30% of 
patients receiving semaglutide 1.0 mg did not  achieve the treatment target of HbA1c <7.0%. 
No CHMP  scientific advices have been given for the  current application.  
2.4.  Quality aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction  
The scope of this line extension application is to  register a new 2 mg strength: solution  for 
subcutaneous injection in a cartridge assembled in a disposable pre-filled pen (PFP)  (also referred to as 
PDS290 pen injector), containing  8 mg semaglutide in 3  mL of solution  (concentration 2.68 mg/mL). 
Each PFP is intended to deliver 4 doses of 2 mg. The pack sizes are 1 and 3 PFPs co-packaged with 4 
and 12 NovoFine Plus needles, respectively. 
The cartridge, PFP, and needles are the  same as those in  the currently authorised for Ozempic 1.34 
mg/mL (0.25  mg, 0.5 mg and 1 mg) presentations:  
- Cartridge (Type I glass) closed at  the one end with  a rubber plunger and at the other end with  an 
aluminium cap;  
- Cartridge assembled into  a disposable PDS290 multi-dose pen injector - Disposable NovoFine Plus 
needles are co-packaged.

EMA/21773/2022  
Page 10/60 
 
 
 
The qualitative and quantitative composition in excipients in the new presentations also remains 
unchanged. 
The active substance semaglutide is a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP 1) analogue produced in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells by recombinant DNA technology. Module 3.2.S is not  affected by this 
application. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance  
Module 3.2.S is not  affected by this application.  
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product  
Description of the  product 
Semaglutide 2  mg solution for injection is a clear and colourless solution filled in a 3 mL cartridge 
assembled in a PDS290 pen injector. NovoFine Plus 32G needles are co-packaged. 
Semaglutide is formulated with  the following compendial excipients: disodium phosphate, dihydrate 
(buffering agent), propylene glycol (tonicity  agent), hydrochloric acid (pH adjustment  to 7.4), sodium 
hydroxide (pH adjustment),  and water for injections (solvent).  
The average overfill volume is approximately 0.2 mL. 
Pharmaceutical  development 
Finished product understanding  has been achieved based on the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP), 
prior knowledge gained during development of Ozempic 1.34 mg/mL presentations, formulation 
development studies, and risk assessment of the manufacturing  process.  
There were no changes made to the  composition of the finished product during development.  
Semaglutide 2.68  mg/mL solution  for injection manufacturing process development is based on the 
manufacturing process of Ozempic 1.34 mg/mL  finished products. Changes from the  manufacturing 
processes for primary stability batches to finished products intended for the market are limited  to 
batch size and the  implementation of sterile filtration  close to filling.   
The primary container closure system is identical to the currently authorised 1 mg presentations. No 
new extractables and leachables studies have been performed, this  is acceptable as the  composition of 
the solution,  the pH, and the primary container is identical, except for an increase of the  relatively low 
peptide content. 
Sterility of the finished product is obtained by filtration  and filling under aseptic conditions.  The 
antimicrobial preservative efficacy of phenol in semaglutide 2.68  mg/mL solution for injection has been 
tested according to  Ph. Eur. Container closure integrity has been confirmed by microbial ingress tests. 
Semaglutide 2.68  mg/mL in the  3 mL cartridge is compatible with  the PDS290 pen injector. There is no 
direct contact between the semaglutide solution for injection and the pen injector. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls  
The manufacturing sites for semaglutide 2.68 mg/mL  solution for injection are listed and identical to 
the Ozempic 1 mg finished products.  
Briefly, semaglutide active substance is dissolved in a solution containing all excipients and diluted with 
water for injections to  obtain the desired weight.  The pH  is adjusted if needed by adding diluted 
Assessment report  
EMA/21773/2022

sodium hydroxide or diluted  hydrochloric acid. The final solution is pre-filtered using a bacteria-
retaining filter with  0.45 µm  pore size and a sterilising filter with  ≤0.2 µm pore size. Sterile filtration at 
point of filling  is carried out  with  a sterilising filter with  ≤0.2  µm pore size. Filter specifications and 
filter validation documents are provided. Established ranges for process parameters based on data 
from process justification  are also provided, these include temperature, stirring speed, stirring time, 
holding times and process time. Pre-treatment procedures of the primary packaging materials are 
provided. Caps and plungers are steam sterilised using Ph. Eur. 5.1.1. reference conditions (≥1210C, ≥
15 min) and cartridges are depyrogenated.   
Assembly with  the PDS290 pen injector for semaglutide 2.68 mg/mL  is described in sufficient detail 
and identical to the assembly of semaglutide 1.34 mg/mL solution  for injection. After final assembly, 
PDS290 pen injectors are labelled and packing in carton before the final release. 
No reprocessing is foreseen. 
Process controls 
Critical steps and in-process controls (IPCs) have been assigned for the semaglutide finished product. 
The proposed actions for failing to meet acceptance criteria are considered acceptable. Adequate 
process controls are in place for the front and rear assembly and the final assembly. The dose accuracy 
of the finished products is controlled routinely. 
Process validation 
Validation activities have been performed to confirm that  the manufacturing process for the 
semaglutide finished product is capable of consistently and reproducibly producing finished product of 
the required quality in  commercial manufacturing scale. The process validation activities encompass a) 
Process justification, b) Process validation programme, and c) Ongoing process verification. 
The purpose of the process justification is to support the  process parameters and limits  for IPCs for the 
production scale manufacturing processes. The process justification was performed with scalable 
process parameters (batch size independent) and non-scalable process parameters (batch size 
dependent and/or equipment specific).    
Three commercial scale batches of semaglutide 2.68  mg/mL solution for injection were manufactured 
and filled in 3 mL cartridges for process validation. Results from IPCs, extensive sampling , and batch 
analysis data demonstrate that the  manufacturing process yields consistent and reproducible finished 
products. 
Validation studies to control the essential functions of the PDS290 pen-injector for semaglutide 2.68 
mg/mL solution  for injection demonstrate that assembled pen-injectors of the  required quality are 
consistently produced.

Specifications include control of identity, impurities,  content and other general tests.  
The proposed acceptance criteria are based on prior knowledge from manufacturing and stability data 
of Ozempic 1.34  mg/mL presentations.  
The proposed finished product specifications, including  acceptance criteria for content of semaglutide 
and for impurities,  are based on the approved specifications and limits  for the semaglutide 1.34 
mg/mL. These limits are sufficiently tight  and considered approvable. n alignment with  the currently 
authorised presentations for Ozempic, no release testing for bioactivity is proposed since the specific 
Assessment report

bioactivity can be adequately monitored by the reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography 
(RP-HPLC) content  assay. 
The specifications are considered acceptable. 
Analytical procedures 
Analytical procedures are described and validated according to relevant ICH guidelines, or reference is 
made to  compendial requirements (Ph. Eur.).  The non-pharmacopoeia analytical procedures in the 
finished product specification are identical to those used for the Ozempic 1.34 mg/mL. 
Batch  analyses 
Analyses of all relevant finished product batches are provided. The results from the three process 
validation batches indicate that  the manufacturing process for semaglutide 2.68 mg/mL solution  for 
injection is under control. 
Characterisation of impurities 
The impurity profiles obtained for semaglutide 2.68  mg/mL solution for injection are comparable to the 
Ozempic 1.34  mg/mL. No new impurities were found to be generated, and the major degradation 
products characterised by liquid  chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) are the same.  
The risk assessment for elemental impurities, in accordance with  ICH Q3D, is considered approvable, 
and the levels found were consistently below 30%  of the  permissible daily exposure (PDE) value based 
on the worst-case finished product dosing.  
According to the  Applicant, a risk assessment for the  potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in 
the finished product was performed. Only the  conclusions are provided. This is acceptable considering 
that  this application is a line extension, and the excipients or container closure system do not  give rise 
to an increased risk in the  formation of nitrosamine impurities. 
Container closure system 
The container closure system for semaglutide 2.68  mg/mL is currently used with  Ozempic 1 mg 
presentations.  
The 3 mL cartridge is made of colourless hydrolytic glass (Type 1 glass as defined by Ph. Eur.). The 
closure at one end of the  cartridge is a cap that  consists of a rubber disc and a seal of aluminium. The 
rubber disk is made of laminated rubber, with  bromobutyl rubber (Type 1, Ph. Eur.) in contact with  the 
finished product. The closure at the other end of the cartridge is a plunger made of chlorobutyl rubber 
(Type 1,  Ph. Eur.). The laminated rubber and rubber plunger are not made with  natural rubber latex. 
Extractable and leachable studies and container closure integrity testing  were part of the finished 
product development studies. Sterilisation procedures are described as part of the  manufacturing 
process. Sufficient documentation is provided. 
The cartridge is assembled in a PDS290 pen-injector. The PDS290 pen injector components are not in 
direct contact with  the solution for injection.  Overall, sufficient information has been provided to 
demonstrate that the pen injector fulfils the relevant ISO requirements. 
The PDS290 pen injector was tested  in a usability  study and found to  be safe and effective for the 
intended users, intended use and use environments with  regards to handling and differentiation.  
In addition, a Notified Body Opinion according to Article 117 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745  on Medical 
Devices was provided, confirming full compliance of the  PDS290 pen injector with the  relevant general 
safety and performance requirements.  
Assessment report  
EMA/21773/2022  
Page 13/60 
 
 
 
The PDS290 pen-injector is co-packaged with compatible NovoFine Plus 32G needles (same needles as 
those currently authorised for Ozempic 1.34 mg/mL  presentations).  
Stability of the product  
The stability test programme for the semaglutide finished product was performed according to  current 
ICH guidelines.  
No changes in formulation and primary container closure system were introduced between the 
production of the primary stability batches and process validation batches.  
Long-term stability  data for three primary stability batches and for one primary stability batch 
assembled in the device, and for the three process validation batches were performed. Only slight 
changes in  content and impurities are observed; all results for these parameters remain within  the 
proposed shelf life specification. No changes in the other stability parameters are observed. 
Furthermore, the stability is comparable for all batches tested. The proposed shelf life before first use 
of 24 months, when stored at 5°C ± 3°C,  is considered acceptable. 
An in-use simulation is performed to simulate patient usage. The proposed in-use period of 42 days 
below 30°C or in a refrigerator (5°C ± 3°C)  after first opening is considered approvable.  
The semaglutide solution  for injection is considered photosensitive. Photo stability studies show that 
the pen-injector with  the cap on provides adequate protection from light  exposure. This consideration 
is reflected in the SmPC.  
Post approval change management protocol(s)  
A Post approval change management protocol (PACMP) is included to add a second manufacturing site 
for the semaglutide 2.68  mg/mL finished product (formulation, filling  and inspection).  The contents  of 
the PACMP are well aligned with  PACMPs recently accepted for additional finished product facilities for 
Ozempic and are considered acceptable.  
Adventitious agents  
The semaglutide precursor peptide is produced from a yeast strain. Yeast is not  a host  for mammalian 
viruses. The cell line has been tested for microbial purity.  
As no further raw materials or excipients of human or animal origin are used for the manufacture of 
semaglutide, the finished product is evaluated to be safe with  regards to transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathies (TSE) agents. 
The finished product is considered to be safe with regards to virus, TSE agents, bacteria, mycoplasma, 
and fungi. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The  pharmaceutical  development,  manufacturing  process  and  controls  are  based  on  the  currently 
authorised 1.34  mg/mL mg presentations. The quality of the  finished product is controlled by adequate 
test  methods  and  specifications.  No  major objection  was  identified  during  the  procedure. The  overall 
quality  documentation  provided in  this  line  extension application  is  considered adequate and  complies 
with  existing guidelines.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The overall quality of Ozempic 2 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen is considered acceptable when 
used in accordance with the conditions  defined in the SmPC. 
From a quality point of view, this line extension application is considered acceptable. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development  
None.  
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects  
Section on ‘Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment’ (ERA) has been assessed in the current 
procedure as a new ERA document was submitted. 
2.5.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment  
The active substance is a peptide, which  will not  alter the  concentration or distribution  of the substance 
in the environment. Therefore, semaglutide is not expected to  pose a risk to the  environment. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects  
In the current procedure a new ERA document was submitted, in which  the applicant has adequately 
justified the absence of further studies to assess the environmental risk of semaglutide. 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will  not alter the concentration or 
distribution  of the substance in  the environment. Therefore, semaglutide is not expected to pose a risk 
to the environment. 
2.5.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects  
No new non-clinical studies have been submitted  for this  procedure which is acceptable. There are no 
objections to the approval from a non-clinical perspective.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology  
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics  
This line-extension application concerns the application for an additional, higher maintenance dose of 
semaglutide 2.0 mg once-weekly s.c. for the treatment of T2D. The applicant submitted a phase 3 trial 
(NN9535-4506)  as a pivotal trial to support this application. In this  trial, sparse pharmacokinetic 
samples were collected, and pharmacokinetic parameters based on these samples were obtained using 
a population pharmacokinetic analysis. The applicant also submitted  two supportive studies NN9535-
3687 (a bioequivalence study) and NN9536-4374  (phase 3 trial  with 2.4  mg semaglutide for weight 
indication as supportive safety evidence). The bioequivalence study NN9535-3687  has been assessed 
before (initial  marketing authorisation application).  Also, reference was made to  study NN9535-3685 
and NN9536-4455  that evaluated the influence of semaglutide 1.0 mg and 2.4 mg on gastric 
emptying.  
The higher maintenance dose of semaglutide 2.0 mg once-weekly s.c. is delivered as in a prefilled 
disposable pen-injector belonging to the same PDS290 technology platform as the existing Ozempic 
doses. The concentration of the to-be-marketed product (for the 2.0 mg dose) is 2.68 mg/ml. 
Methods 
Validated LC-MS/MS  bioanalytical methods, previously assessed in initial  marketing authorisation 
application, were used to analyse semaglutide in plasma. In study NN9535-3687,  standard non-
compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters have been determined. A population pharmacokinetic 
analysis was conducted to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters in pivotal study NN9535-4506.  The 
objectives were to  evaluate the dose proportionality of the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide and the 
impact of covariates on semaglutide exposure. 
Population PK model used to characterise PK data  from phase 3 trial (NN9535-4506) 
 A one-compartment structural model with  first-order absorption and first-order elimination was used 
to describe the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide. The absorption rate constant was fixed to  a value of 
0.0296  h-1, based on earlier clinical pharmacology trials in normoglycaemic and type 2 diabetes 
subjects. Between-subject variability was included for CL/V and V/F and assumed to have a log-normal 
distribution.  Residual variability was described by a proportional error model.  
Covariate factors were implemented using the  same factors as for the  SUSTAIN population PK model, 
with  two differences: First,  the injection site was previously shown to have a negligible effect on PK,1 
and therefore, this data was not collected for this  analysis. Second, the  dose factor (originally testing 
0.5 mg vs 1.0 mg) will,  for this  analysis, test an effect on exposure (CL/F) at 2.0  mg vs 1.0 mg. The 
covariate factors to  be included for CL/F are sex, age group, race, ethnicity,  body weight,  renal 
function,  and maintenance dose. Covariates were analysed using  a “full  covariate model” and assumed 
a power model structure. The population pharmacokinetic model was reduced by excluding covariates 
that  were not considered significantly impact exposure (p<0.05).    
The first-order conditional estimation with  interaction as implemented in NONMEM  version 7.3 was 
used to estimate model parameters. Non-parametric bootstrap was used to estimate standard errors. 
The population pharmacokinetic model was evaluated using  standard goodness-of-fit plots, visual 
predictive checks, parameter uncertainty, shrinkage and plausibility  of fixed model parameters. 
A total of 3632 pharmacokinetic observations from 956 subjects (on-treatment) were evaluated for 
inclusion in the population  pharmacokinetic dataset. 229 observations (6.3%)  were excluded due to

values below the lower limit of quantification  or inadequate dosing history. The final population 
pharmacokinetic model comprised 3403 pharmacokinetic observations from 944  subjects.  
A visual predictive check of the  model is displayed below in Figure 1. Model parameters are displayed 
in Table 1.

Study NN9535-3687  investigated and compared the pharmacokinetics of following  s.c. injection  of 
0.5 mg semaglutide with  three different concentrations semaglutide (1 mg/mL, 3 mg/mL,  and 10 
mg/mL). Equivalence between semaglutide 1 mg/mL and 3 mg/mL  was demonstrated for overall 
exposure (AUC0−inf) and for Cmax. Equivalence between the  10 mg/mL product strength  versus 1 
mg/mL and 3 mg/mL, respectively, was shown for overall exposure (AUC), but  not for Cmax.  
Distribution 
No new information has been provided. 
Elimination 
No new information has been provided. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality  
Dose proportionality was evaluated in the population pharmacokinetic analyses of the pivotal phase 3 
trial. The geometric mean average concentration was estimated to be 27 nM [range: 14-56  nM] for the 
1.0 mg and 54 nM  [range: 28-102  nM]  for the 2.0 mg dose. 
Time dependency 
During the Ozempic programme, it was shown that  semaglutide steady-state exposure is stable over 
time, with  accumulation ratios of approximately 2. Bodyweight was identified as the  most influential 
covariate affecting semaglutide plasma exposure.  
Variability  
The population pharmacokinetic analyses of the  pivotal phase 3 trial, based on trough  concentrations, 
estimated an approximately 13.9% between-subject variability in AUC. Within-subject  variability is 
Assessment report  
EMA/21773/2022

estimated to be 25.0% (CV), which  was based on the residual error model of the population 
pharmacokinetic model.  
Special populations 
No new covariates have been identified in the population pharmacokinetic model for the  2.0 mg dose. 
Bodyweight was the  predominant factor influencing the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide. Therefore, 
no new information is described here.   
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The applicant conducted two studies to investigate het effect on gastrointestinal emptying, study 
NN9535-3685  with  semaglutide 1.0 mg and NN9536-4455  with  semaglutide 2.4 mg (to support the 
weight  management indication), see tables below.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology  
The higher maintenance dose of semaglutide 2.0 mg once-weekly s.c. is delivered as in a prefilled 
disposable pen-injector belonging to the same PDS290 technology platform as the existing Ozempic 
doses. The concentration of the to-be-marketed product (for the 2.0 mg dose) is 2.68 mg/ml. 
In the pivotal phase 3 trial (NN9535-4506)  this  product was not  administered. Instead, two injections 
of 1.0 mg (1.34  mg/mL) were administered. The switch to the  to-be-marketed product 2.0 mg (2.68 
mg/ml) is not expected to  significantly influence the  pharmacokinetics of semaglutide based on the 
results of the bioequivalence trial NN9535-3687.  In this trial, different concentrations of semaglutide 
were evaluated at the same dose level of 0.5mg  semaglutide. Bioequivalence between semaglutide 1 
mg/mL and 3 mg/mL was demonstrated for overall exposure (AUC0−inf) and Cmax. Therefore, it can be 
considered reasonable that the proposed 2  mg dose with  the 2.68 mg/mL  formulation will  provide 
equivalent exposures as the double administration of 1 mg dose with  the 1.34  mg/mL formulations.   
Based on trough concentrations after treatment with  1 mg and 2  mg dose of semaglutide in the  phase 
3 trial (NN9535-4506)  and the  previously conducted bioequivalence trial NN9535-3652,  it  can be 
concluded that semaglutide steady-state exposure (AUC and Cmax) increased approximately 
proportionally with  the dose, in the dose range of 0.25-2.0  mg semaglutide. 
During the Ozempic programme, it  was shown that  semaglutide steady-state exposure is stable over 
time with  accumulation ratios of approximately 2 (study NN9535-3634).  Bodyweight was identified as 
the most influential  covariate affecting semaglutide plasma exposure.  
As requested, the applicant provided an estimate of the within-subject  variability of semaglutide 2 mg 
dose. The within-subject  variability has been estimated using the population pharmacokinetic model. A 
proportional residual error model was used. The within-subject  variability of semaglutide for the 2 mg 
dose is estimated to be about 25%,  which is in line with  previous observations in the SUSTAIN 
programme with  a within-subject  variability of 24%  for the existing Ozempic doses (0.25,  0.5, and 1.0 
mg/week). 
The pharmacokinetics of semaglutide in patients with  type 2 diabetes have been characterised for the 
0.25,  0.5 and 1.0 mg dosages in previous Ozempic trials and up to  2.0-mg in pivotal phase 3  trial 
(NN9535-4506).  The results in patients with  type 2 diabetes are comparable between trials. No  new 
covariates have been identified  in the population pharmacokinetic model for the 2.0  mg dose. 
Bodyweight was the  predominant factor influencing the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide. No 
differences in the pharmacokinetics of the higher 2.0 mg dose are to  be expected as dose 
proportionality is demonstrated for the 2.0 mg.  
Several drug-drug interaction studies  were conducted in the clinical development program of 0.25,  0.5 
and 1.0 mg semaglutide. In vitro studies have shown very low potential for semaglutide to inhibit  or 
induce CYP enzymes, and to inhibit  drug transporters. The potential  of semaglutide to delay gastric 
emptying may influence the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medical products.  
No new drug-drug interaction studies have been provided for the 2.0 mg formulation. Upon request, 
the applicant justified that  the potential  effect of semaglutide 2.0 mg on the absorption of oral 
medicines is anticipated not  to exceed that of semaglutide 1.0 mg. The applicant conducted two 
studies to investigate het effect on gastrointestinal emptying, study NN9535-3685  with  semaglutide 
1.0 mg and NN9536-4455  with  semaglutide 2.4mg (to  support the weight management indication). 
Based on data from these trials, semaglutide 2.4 mg (assessed at week 20) did  not appear to further 
delay gastric emptying compared to semaglutide 1.0 mg (assessed at week 12). Accordingly, the 
influence the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medical products is expected to  be similar 
between the existing 1.0 mg and the higher 2.0 mg dose level. 
Assessment report  
EMA/21773/2022  
Page 20/60 
 
 
 
Upon request, the applicant assessed whether an increased incidence of anti-drug antibodies can be 
expected due to the higher 2.0 mg dose. In the SUSTAIN programme, the frequencies of antibody 
positive subjects for the existing Ozempic 1.0  mg were between 0% and 3.2%, and in study NN9536 
with  semaglutide 2.4  mg dose, for the weight management indication, 3%  of subjects developed anti-
semaglutide antibodies. As the incidence of ADAs was low and comparable between the different dose 
levels and no impact on efficacy and safety was observed, the incidence and impact of anti-drug 
antibodies is expected to be low with  the semaglutide 2.0  mg dose as well.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology  
The pharmacokinetics of semaglutide 2.0 mg once-weekly s.c. has been appropriately characterised. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy  
Data from Trial 4506 is the pivotal study of efficacy and safety with  semaglutide 2.0  mg.  
The following data provide supportive evidence for this application: 
Trial 3687: trial supporting  the comparability of the intended to-be-marketed drug product for 
semaglutide 2.0 mg (semaglutide drug product concentration: 2.68 mg/mL) with  the semaglutide drug 
product used in Trial 4506  (semaglutide drug product concentration: 1.34 mg/mL).  Trial 3687  was 
submitted  to the EMA. 
Trial 4191: phase 2 dose-finding trial: Supportive evidence of safety is available from the clinical 
development programme for semaglutide 2.4 mg in  weight management (STEP), comprising 4 phase 
3a therapeutic confirmatory trials. One of the  4 trials in the programme investigated the efficacy and 
safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg in subjects with  obesity or overweight and with  T2D as a comorbidity 
(NN9536-4374,  STEP 2).  
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies)  
To explore the potential of higher semaglutide doses, the phase 2 Trial NN9535-4191  (hereafter 
referred to as Trial 4191)  was conducted. In Trial 4191, once-daily semaglutide s.c. doses up to  0.3 
mg (equivalent to ~2.1 mg once-weekly) were investigated in 705  subjects with  T2D. After 26 weeks, 
dose dependent and clinically relevant reductions in HbA1c and body weight were observed (Table 4). 
Once-daily semaglutide s.c. was well-tolerated with  no new safety concerns identified.

Data from Trial 4191 and the SUSTAIN trials were included in the exposure-response model, which 
supported the hypothesis of additional glucose lowering and body weight loss with  higher dose levels of 
semaglutide. With dose increase from semaglutide 1.0 mg to 2.0  mg, a reduction in HbA1c  of 0.26%-
points was predicted. Therefore, the increment from semaglutide 1.0  mg to 2.0 mg was expected to 
provide clinically meaningful differentiation on glycaemic control, with  a higher likelihood of more 
patients achieving glycaemic targets.  
Semaglutide  drug product intended to-be-marketed  for semaglutide  2.0 mg 
Ozempic is currently marketed with  the drug product concentration 1.34 mg/mL which  was used in 
Trial 4506 (Table 5). The intended to-be-marketed product for semaglutide 2.0  mg has a drug product 
concentration of 2.68 mg/mL with  dose-volume retained at 0.74 mL (Table 5). In Trial 4506, 
semaglutide 2.0 mg was administered as 2 separate injections of 1.0  mg, with  0.74 mL dose volume 
each. Except for the semaglutide concentration, the composition of semaglutide drug product 
2.68  mg/mL is identical to the current drug product for Ozempic (1.34 mg/mL),  also used in 
Trial 4506.

Comparability between drug product intended to-be-marketed for semaglutide 2.0  mg vs. drug product 
in Trial 4506  
A previously conducted trial (NN9535-3687,  hereafter referred to as Trial 3687) supports the 
comparability of the current semaglutide drug product 1.34 mg/mL (used in Trial 4506)  to the 
semaglutide drug product (2.68 mg/mL),  intended to-be-marketed for the  semaglutide 2.0  mg dose 
(details below). 
The composition of the semaglutide drug products (1.0 mg/mL,  3.0 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL)  tested in 
Trial NN9535-3687  was identical to the current Ozempic product, and to the  drug product to-be-
marketed for semaglutide 2.0 mg, except for the  semaglutide concentration. 
Summary of Trial 3687 
Trial 3687 was a randomised, two-period, incomplete cross-over trial in healthy subjects investigating 
if the comparison of different semaglutide drug product concentrations (1 mg/mL,  3 mg/mL, and 
10 mg/mL)  met the bioequivalence criterion concerning the total exposure after single s.c. injections. 
To support the change in  semaglutide drug product concentration from 1.34 mg/mL to  2.68 mg/mL 
(for the semaglutide 2.0 mg dose), only the comparison between the semaglutide drug product 
concentrations 1.0 mg/mL and 3.0  mg/mL is relevant and therefore presented in this  document.  
For the comparison between semaglutide drug product concentrations, 1.0 mg/mL and 3.0 mg/mL,  the 
90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the  treatment ratios were fully contained within  the bioequivalence 
Assessment report

limits of 80-125%  for both the total  exposure and Cmax. The treatment ratios for semaglutide drug 
product concentrations 1.0 mg/mL: 3.0  mg/mL were: 
AUC0−∞: 1.02 [0.99; 1.05]90%CI 
Cmax: 0.91 [0.84; 1.00]90%CI 
Hence, the comparison between semaglutide drug product concentrations of 1.0 mg/mL  and 
3.0 mg/mL  in Trial 3687  met the equivalence criterion. These data support comparability between the 
semaglutide drug product concentrations of 1.34  mg/mL (used in Trial 4506)  and 2.68 mg/mL  (to-be-
marketed drug product for semaglutide 2.0 mg) as the concentration range is contained within  the 
concentration range tested in  Trial 3687. 
Further, bridging  the semaglutide drug product concentrations based on Trial 3687 is considered 
appropriate as semaglutide exposure increased in a dose-proportional manner from 1.0 mg 
(administered with 1.34  mg/mL) to 2.0  mg (administered as 2 doses of 1.0 mg, 1.34  mg/mL) based on 
population PK data from Trial 4506. 
In summary, the results from Trial 3687  support the change in  drug product concentration from that 
used in Trial 4506  (1.34  mg/mL) to that  of the intended to-be-marketed drug product for semaglutide 
2.0 mg (2.68  mg/mL).

Trial 4506 
Methods 
Trial design 
Trial 4506 was a multinational,  multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, two-armed, active-comparator 
trial with  a 49-week trial period (incl. screening, dose-escalation, 40  weeks treatment and 7 weeks 
follow-up). The trial design is shown schematically in Figure 3.   
A total of 961 adults  with T2D were randomised 1:1  to treatment with  once-weekly semaglutide 
2.0 mg or 1.0 mg.

Estimands 
Two estimand strategies were defined for this trial. 
The hypothetical estimand strategy is considered the primary strategy, except in the  US, where FDA 
has specifically requested the treatment policy estimand strategy to  be the primary strategy.  
For each endpoint,  results based on the hypothetical estimand strategy will be presented first, followed 
by results based on the treatment policy estimand strategy where applicable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/21773/2022

Hypothetical  estimand strategy 
The hypothetical estimand addressing the primary objective was defined as the treatment difference in 
mean change from baseline to week 40 in  HbA1c (%-point)  of semaglutide 2.0 mg versus semaglutide 
1.0 mg, both  as an add-on to metformin with  or without  SU, in  all randomised subjects with  T2D, 
regardless of change in treatment dose and had they not discontinued  treatment or initiated any 
rescue medication (anti-diabetic medications). 
Other parameters that were evaluated by the  hypothetical estimand strategy used the same 
hypothetical estimand as for the primary objective, however with  “HbA1c (%)-point”  replaced by the 
relevant parameter and unit. 
Treatment  policy estimand strategy 
The treatment policy estimand addressing the primary objective was defined as the treatment 
difference in mean change from baseline to week 40 in  HbA1c (%-point)  of semaglutide 2.0 mg versus 
semaglutide 1.0 mg, both as an add-on to metformin with or without  SU, in all randomised subjects 
with  T2D, regardless of change in  treatment dose, discontinuation  of treatment and initiation  of rescue 
medication (anti-diabetic medications). 
Other parameters that were evaluated by the  treatment policy estimand strategy used the same 
treatment policy estimand as for the primary objective, however with  “HbA1c (%)-point”  replaced by 
the relevant parameter and unit. 
•  Sample size 
The sample size calculation was performed to ensure sufficient  power for confirming superiority of 
once-weekly semaglutide 2.0  mg vs. once-weekly semaglutide 1.0  mg on change from baseline to 
week 40 in  HbA1c (%-point)  based on each estimand separately. 
For the primary endpoint,  an on-treatment  HbA1c effect of -0.26%-point  was predicted based on 
exposure-response modelling. The treatment  policy estimand was assumed to reflect a 15%  lower 
effect (based on results from the SUSTAIN phase 3a programme). With  the adjusted HbA1c treatment 
effect of -0.22%-point  and an SD of 1.1%-point,  964  randomised subjects would give 87%  power to 
confirmed superiority of the  primary endpoint based on the treatment  policy estimand, and at least 
87% power for confirming superiority for the primary endpoint  based on the hypothetical estimand. 
•  Randomisation and  Blinding (masking) 
Blinding (masking)  
The first 12 weeks during escalation all the trial products were packed open-label as all subjects 
followed the same treatment regimen in this period. From week 13, the  subject was to receive the trial 
product, which was packed open-label (which contained semaglutide), as well as the trial product 
which was packed blinded (and contained either semaglutide or placebo). The active drug and placebo 
drug were visually identical.

Randomisation  
All subjects were centrally randomised using  an IWRS and assigned to the next available treatment 
according to  randomisation schedule. Trial product was dispensed/allocated at the trial visits 
summarised in the flowchart.   
At screening, each subject was be assigned a unique 6-digit  subject number which remained the same 
throughout  the trial. Each site was assigned a 3-digit  number and all subject numbers started with  the 
site number. 
•  Statistical methods 
An overview of statistical  methods used for the analysis of trial 4506  is presented below.  
Analysis sets and observation periods 
Data selection for statistical analysis was selected first by the  analysis population, and subsequently by 
events/data for those subjects based on the observation period. 
For the evaluation of efficacy, one analysis set was defined: 
Full analysis set:  All randomised subjects. Subjects in the FAS were analysed according to the 
treatment to which  they were assigned at  randomisation. 
For the evaluation of efficacy, the  following observation periods were defined: 
‘On-treatment  without rescue medication’ observation period: this  observation period is a sub-
set of the ‘on-treatment’ observation period and represents the time period where subjects are 
considered treated with  trial product but have not  initiated any rescue medication. The observation 
period starts at  the date of first  dose of trial product and ends at the  date of any of the  following: 
initiation  of rescue medication 
the date of last dose of trial product +14  days 
‘In-trial’ observation period: This observation period is defined as the period from the date of 
randomisation to the first of the following dates, both inclusive: 
Follow-up  visit (P11) 
Death 
Subject withdrew informed consent 
Last contact  for subjects lost to follow-up 
Confirmatory endpoints 
Two confirmatory endpoints are defined in this trial 
change from baseline (week 0) to week 40  in HbA1c (%-point) 
change from baseline (week 0) to week 40  in body weight  (kg) 
For each estimand strategy, both endpoints were tested for superiority. The type-I error rate was 
controlled in the strong sense across the primary and confirmatory secondary hypotheses, separately 
for each estimand, at an overall two-sided alpha-level of 0.05.

The superiority of once-weekly semaglutide s.c. 2.0 mg versus once-weekly semaglutide s.c. 1.0  mg 
was evaluated hierarchically according to the sequence below (the  treatment difference was defined as 
µ = [semaglutide 2.0 mg minus semaglutide 1.0 mg]):

Abbreviations: ANCOVA; analysis of covariance; FAS: full analysis set; MAR: missing at random 
The primary (except US) hypothetical estimand was estimated based on FAS using post-baseline data 
collected up to and including week 40  from the ‘on-treatment  without  rescue medication’ observation 
period.   
Imputation of missing data was handled by multiple  imputation (MI),  assuming that missing data were 
missing at random (MAR).  The imputation  was performed separately within each treatment group 
defined by randomised treatment.  First, intermittent  missing values were imputed using a Markov 
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)  method, to obtain a monotone missing data pattern,  generating 500 
complete data sets. Secondly, a sequential conditional linear regression approach for imputing 
monotone missing values was implemented starting  with  the first visit after baseline and sequentially

continuing  to the last planned visit at week 40.  The model used for imputation  included the baseline 
and post-baseline HbA1c values observed prior to the visit in question as covariates.   
The 500 complete datasets were analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment 
and stratification as fixed factors and the baseline HbA1c as a covariate. Rubin’s rule was applied to 
obtain inference. 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
Of the 961 randomised subjects, 97.1%  completed the  trial and 92.5% completed treatment, equally 
balanced between the two  treatment arms. Few  subjects discontinued  treatment due to AEs (4.6%  and 
4.4% in  the semaglutide 1.0  mg and 2.0 mg arm, respectively). See Table 7 for details.

•  Recruitment / Baseline  data 
Subjects enrolled in this trial  had a mean age of 58 years, mean HbA1c of 8.9%, mean duration of 
diabetes of 9.5  years and a mean body weight of 99.3  kg. Approximately 74% of subjects had a BMI 
≥30 kg/m2 and 58.6% of the population  was male. At baseline, all subjects were treated with 
metformin, and approximately half of subjects were treated with  SU.  
•  Numbers analysed  / Outcomes and estimation 
At the end of the treatment visit (week 40), 95.9%  and 96.9% of treatment completers in  the 
semaglutide 2.0 and 1.0 mg arm, respectively, were at target doses. 
Overall, few subjects (2.9%)  initiated  rescue medication, predominantly constituting  SU or SGLT2 
inhibitor  classes, during the course of the treatment. A greater proportion of subjects in the 
semaglutide 1.0 mg arm required the use of rescue medication compared to the semaglutide 2.0 mg 
arm (4.2%  vs. 1.7% subjects). 
Change  in HbA1c  
Semaglutide 2.0  mg was superior to semaglutide 1.0 mg for the  primary endpoint of change from 
baseline to week 40 in HbA1c, as evaluated by the  hypothetical and treatment  policy estimands (Table 
8).

HbA1c <7.0% or ≤6.5%  
At baseline, mean HbA1c was 8.9%  and 8.8% in the  semaglutide 2.0  and 1.0  mg treatment arms, 
respectively. A greater proportion of subjects achieved HbA1c target levels (ADA: <7.0% or AACE: 
≤6.5%)  at week 40 with  semaglutide 2.0 mg compared to semaglutide 1.0 mg, as evaluated by the 
hypothetical estimand (Table 9).  The odds of achieving HbA1c targets were statistically  significant 
favouring semaglutide 2.0 mg, as evaluated using the hypothetical estimand (Table 9). Similar results 
were observed for HbA1c targets evaluated by the treatment policy estimand. (64.4% vs 55.8% for 
HbA1c<7%;  49.4% vs 37.1% for HbA1c <6.5%).

Fasting plasma glucose  
The reduction in FPG was consistent  with  the observed reduction in HbA1c. The change from baseline to 
week 40 in  mean FPG levels was statistically significantly greater with  semaglutide 2.0 mg compared 
to semaglutide 1.0 mg as evaluated by the hypothetical estimand (Table 10).  However, the difference 
between semaglutide 2.0  mg and semaglutide 1.0  mg was not  statistically significant as evaluated by 
the treatment policy estimand.

Body weight  decreased to a larger extent with  semaglutide 2.0 mg than with  semaglutide 1.0 mg after 
escalation to  semaglutide 2.0  mg at week 12. Mean body weight continued  to show a downward trend 
at the last treatment  visit for both  treatment arms (Table 12). A similar pattern in body weight 
reduction over the duration of the trial was observed for the in-trial  observation period.

Body weight  loss ≥5% or ≥10.0%  
At baseline, the  mean body weight was 100.1  kg and 98.6  kg in the semaglutide 2.0  and 1.0  mg 
treatment arms, respectively. A greater proportion of subjects achieved weight  loss ≥5%  or ≥10.0%  at 
week 40 with  semaglutide 2.0 mg compared to semaglutide 1.0 mg. The odds of achieving body 
weight  loss ≥5.0%  or ≥10.0%  were statistically significant in favour of semaglutide 2.0 mg as 
evaluated using the  hypothetical estimand strategy (Table 13). Statistical  analysis using the treatment

Duration of main phase: 
The trial period was 49 weeks with  2 weeks screening 
period. The treatment duration  of the  trial was 40 
weeks, with  an additional 7 weeks of follow-up. 
Hypotheses 
Primary objective:   
• 
To establish the superior effect of semaglutide s.c. 2.0 mg once-weekly 
versus semaglutide s.c. 1.0  mg once-weekly on glycaemic control in subjects 
with  T2D, on a background of metformin with  or without  SU treatment. 
Secondary objectives:   
• 
To compare the effect of semaglutide s.c. 2.0 mg once-weekly versus 
semaglutide s.c. 1.0 mg once-weekly in subjects with  T2D, on a background 
of metformin with or without  SU treatment, on

Data from all randomised subjects in the FAS were included in the  analyses. The 
presented results are for the hypothetical estimand which estimates the absolute 
treatment difference in mean change from baseline to week 40  of semaglutide 2.0 
mg versus semaglutide 1.0 mg, both as an add-on to  metformin with  or without  SU, 
in all randomised subjects with  T2D, regardless of change in treatment  dose and had 
they not discontinued treatment  or initiated  any rescue medication (anti-diabetic 
medications). 
Continuous endpoints were analysed using a linear regression (ANCOVA) model with   
treatment and stratification  factor as fixed factors and baseline value as covariate 
applying Rubin's rule to  draw inference. 
The ETD between semaglutide 2.0 mg and semaglutide 1.0 mg was reported 
together with  the associated two-sided 95%  CI and corresponding p-value.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
To explore the potential of higher semaglutide doses, the phase 2 Trial NN9535-4191  (hereafter 
referred to as Trial 4191)  was conducted. In Trial 4191, once-daily semaglutide s.c. doses up to  0.3 
mg (equivalent to ~2.1 mg once-weekly) were investigated in 705  subjects with  T2D.

Data from Trial 4191 and the SUSTAIN trials were included in the exposure-response model. With dose 
increase from semaglutide 1.0 mg to 2.0  mg, a reduction in  HbA1c of 0.26%-points  was predicted. In 
addition, an additional reduction in body weight of a least 2.5 kg is to be expected. 
Trial 4506 was a multinational,  multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, two-armed, active-comparator 
trial with  a 49-week trial period (incl. screening, dose-escalation, 40  weeks treatment and 9 weeks 
follow-up). A total  of 961  adults with  T2D were randomised 1:1 to treatment  with  once-weekly 
semaglutide 2.0 mg or 1.0 mg. Subjects with  T2D were enrolled in the trial (HbA1c of 8-10%).  Patients 
were treated with  metformin alone or in combination with  SU. The trial  design is acceptable, the 
primary objective was to establish the superior effect of semaglutide s.c. 2.0  mg once-weekly versus 
semaglutide s.c. 1.0 mg once-weekly on glycaemic control in subjects with  T2D, on a background of 
metformin with  or without  SU treatment. 
•  Secondary objectives were to compare the effect of semaglutide s.c. 2.0 mg once-weekly 
versus semaglutide s.c. 1.0  mg once-weekly in subjects with  T2D, on a background of 
metformin with  or without  SU treatment,  on: body weight,  vital signs, hypoglycaemia and 
general safety and tolerability.  
Of the 961 randomised subjects, 97.1%  completed the  trial and 92.5% completed treatment, equally 
balanced between the two  treatment arms.  
Subjects enrolled in this trial  had a mean age of 58 years, mean HbA1c of 8.9%,  mean duration of 
diabetes of 9.5  years and a mean body weight of 99.3  kg. Approximately 74% of subjects had a BMI 
≥30 kg/m2, and 58.6%  of the population was male. Characteristics were comparable between 
treatment groups. Baseline HbA1c was somewhat higher than  that  in most other studies with 
semaglutide. 
Overall, few subjects (2.9%)  initiated  rescue medication, predominantly constituting  SU or SGLT2 
inhibitor  classes, during the course of the treatment. A greater proportion of subjects in the 
semaglutide 1.0 mg arm required use of rescue medication compared to the semaglutide 2.0 mg arm 
(4.2%  vs. 1.7%  subjects). 
Efficacy data  and additional analyses 
The estimated mean HbA1c reduced to  6.7% from a relatively high baseline value of 8.9% (estimated 
mean change from baseline of -2.2%-point,  hypothetical estimand). Comparatively, in the semaglutide 
1.0 mg arm, the estimated mean change from baseline was -1.9%-point.  Similar results were 
observed using the treatment policy estimand strategy. The estimated treatment difference in HbA1c 
reduction between 1.0 and 2.0 mg was modest (0.23%,  hypothetical estimand; 0.18%, treatment 
policy estimand),  especially when the  relatively high baseline HbA1c is taken into account. A modest 
additional proportion of subjects achieved HbA1c target levels at week 40 with  semaglutide 2.0  mg 
compared to semaglutide 1.0 mg (treatment estimand 64.4%  vs 55.8%  for target  HbA1c<7%). 
Semaglutide 2.0  mg was superior to semaglutide 1.0 mg for the  secondary confirmatory endpoint of 
change from baseline to week 40 in body weight as evaluated by the  hypothetical estimand (-0.93 [-
1.68;  -0.18]95%CI, p=0.0155).  However, superiority could not  be confirmed with the  treatment policy 
estimand (-0.77  [-1.55; 0.01]95%CI,  p=0.0535).  The reduction in body weight of 0.8-0.9  kg is less 
than expected from the dose-finding study (-2.5  kg).  
After 40 weeks of treatment, a reduction in blood pressure was observed for both doses of 
semaglutide. There were no relevant differences between the 1.0  mg and the  2.0 mg dose. 
Trial 3687 was a randomised, two-period, incomplete cross-over trial in healthy subjects investigating 
if comparison of different semaglutide drug product concentrations (1 mg/mL, 3 mg/mL,  and 10 
mg/mL) met the  bioequivalence criterion with  respect to the total  exposure after single s.c. injections.  
Assessment report  
EMA/21773/2022  
Page 38/60 
 
 
 
These data support comparability between the  semaglutide drug product concentrations of 1.34 
mg/mL (used in Trial 4506) and 2.68  mg/mL (to-be-marketed drug product for semaglutide 2.0  mg) 
as the concentration range is contained within  the concentration range tested in  Trial 3687. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy  
The estimated treatment difference in HbA1c reduction between 1.0 and 2.0 mg was modest 
(approximately 0.2%), especially when the  relatively high baseline HbA1c is taken into account. In 
general, results with  respect to HbA1c  were similar across pre-specified subgroups.  
Semaglutide 2.0  mg was statistically superior to semaglutide 1.0 mg for body weight  as evaluated by 
the hypothetical estimand; however, superiority could not  be statistically  confirmed with  the treatment 
policy estimand. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety  
Safety methodology  
The safety evaluation is based on the safety analysis set (SAS) primarily using the on-treatment 
observation period as this represents the  period when subjects were considered exposed to the trial 
product. The in-trial observation period was used for deaths and adverse events (AEs) related to  the 
safety focus areas with  potentially long latency between onset and diagnosis. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient  exposure  
Exposure was defined as the time from first date to last date of dose of trial product plus the 
ascertainment window of 49 days (both  dates inclusive).  
A total of 959 subjects were exposed to trial products, with  479  subjects exposed to semaglutide 
2.0 mg and 480  subjects to semaglutide 1.0 mg. The duration of exposure and observation based on 
the on-treatment  and in-trial  observation periods, respectively, was comparable between the 
treatment arms: 
semaglutide 2.0 mg: 409.9  PYE and 431.0  PYO 
semaglutide 1.0 mg: 411.2  PYE and 433.7  PYO 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events   
An overview of AEs reported for the  on-treatment observation period is presented in Table 16. 
A slightly higher proportion of subjects experienced AEs in the semaglutide 2.0 mg treatment arm 
compared to the semaglutide 1.0 mg treatment arm; while the event rates were similar between the 
treatment arms: 
• 
• 
semaglutide 2.0 mg: 56.8%  subjects; 189.1  events per 100 PYE 
semaglutide 1.0 mg: 52.3%  subjects; 201.4  events per 100 PYE 
No difference between the treatment arms was observed in terms of the proportion of subjects with 
SAEs, severe AEs or AEs leading to  premature treatment discontinuation.  In both treatment arms, the 
majority of the AEs were non-serious, of mild  or moderate severity, and reported as recovered. The

steepest increase in the number of subjects reporting their first AE was during  the dose-escalation 
period.

proportion  of subjects  with at least one event, E: number of events, R: events per 100 years of exposure, seq.: 
sequelae. 
As expected for the GLP-1 RA drug class, gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported 
AEs in both treatment arms (Figure 7). For most system organ classes (SOCs), the proportions of 
subjects with events and the event rates with  semaglutide 2.0  mg were similar to or lower than with 
semaglutide 1.0 mg. Compared to the semaglutide 1.0 mg arm, slightly more subjects in the 
semaglutide 2.0 mg arm reported AEs across SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders, metabolism and 
nutrition  disorders, investigations, vascular disorders and blood and lymphatic system disorders 
(Figure 7).  The most common AEs reported by ≥5.0%  subjects by preferred terms (PTs) were nausea, 
diarrhoea, vomiting, decreased appetite and dyspepsia (Figure  8). The majority of the common AEs 
were non-serious, of mild or moderate severity, and with  outcome reported as recovered. 
Infections and infestations  are the second most frequent AEs affecting 16.9% of the subjects in both 
treatment arms, i.e. there is no difference between the dosing groups. The listing  by preferred terms 
are spread across a large number of different infections and infestations.

Safety focus areas  
Based on the disease, drug class, and regulatory feedback and requirements, safety focus areas of 
special interest were pre-defined for the  evaluation of safety with  semaglutide 2.0 mg. An overview of 
the results for the safety focus areas in presented in Figure 9 and summarised in subsequent sections.

period. IT: in-trial observation period. MedDRA version 23.0. 
Gastrointestinal disorders  
The proportion of subjects with  AEs related to gastrointestinal disorders was slightly higher with 
semaglutide 2.0 mg (34.0%)  compared to semaglutide 1.0  mg (30.8%);  while, the event rates were 
similar in the treatment arms (84.4 vs. 85.8 events per 100  PYE) (Figure 9).  
The most frequently reported PTs reported by ≥5% of subjects in both treatment  arms were nausea, 
diarrhoea, vomiting and dyspepsia. The majority of AEs were non-serious, of mild or moderate severity 
and were reported as recovered. A higher proportion of AEs related to gastrointestinal  disorders with 
semaglutide 2.0 mg compared to semaglutide 1.0 mg were judged as probably or possibly related to 
trial product by the investigator. In the semaglutide 2.0  mg arm, 12  subjects reported severe AEs 
related to  gastrointestinal disorders compared to 8 subjects in the semaglutide 1.0 mg arm. Severe 
events in  the semaglutide 2.0  mg treatment arm were mainly vomiting. 
The incidence of premature treatment discontinuation  due to AEs related to gastrointestinal  disorders 
was similar between the two  treatment arms (3.3%  vs 2.7%  of subjects for semaglutide 2.0 mg vs 
semaglutide 1.0 mg, respectively). 
SAEs related to gastrointestinal disorders were reported in both treatment  arms: 
• 
• 
semaglutide 2.0 mg: 3 subjects reported 3 events (PTs: colitis,  constipation and oesophagitis) 
semaglutide 1.0 mg: 2 subjects reported 3 events (PTs: abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting) 
Cardiovascular disorders  
The proportion of subjects with  AEs related to cardiovascular disorders was 5.0% in the  semaglutide 
2.0 mg arm and 4.0% in the semaglutide 1.0 mg arm with  comparable event rates between the 
treatment arms (Figure 9).  
In both treatment arms, the majority of AEs related to cardiovascular disorders were non-serious, mild 
or moderate in severity and judged by the investigator as unlikely related to  trial product with outcome

reported as recovered. Most of the identified  events were reported within  the cardiac disorders SOC, 
where minor imbalances across PTs were observed between the treatment arms. 
A total of 3 events led to premature treatment discontinuation: 
• 
• 
semaglutide 2.0 mg: 1 SAE (atrial fibrillation) and 1 non-serious AE (syncope) 
semaglutide 1.0 mg: 1 SAE (acute myocardial infarction) 
The proportion of subjects with  SAEs related to  cardiovascular disorders was similar in both  treatment 
arms: 
semaglutide 2.0 mg: 6 subjects (1.3%) reported 9 events 
semaglutide 1.0 mg: 8 subjects (1.7%) reported 9 events  
Pulse rate 
The change in pulse rate was investigated as a supportive secondary endpoint. Pulse rate increased in 
the 2.0  and 1.0  mg arms and with  no statistically significant difference between the arms (+3.6  vs 
+2.6  beats/min, respectively, p=0.06) 
Hypoglycaemic episodes  
The number of treatment-emergent severe or blood glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia 
episodes (Novo Nordisk classification) from the first dose to week 40, was a supportive secondary 
safety endpoint.  There were no statistically  significant differences in the rate or odds of experiencing 
severe or blood glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia episodes between the treatment arms 
(Table 17). The majority of severe or blood glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia episodes 
occurred when the trial product was used in combination with  SU or insulin.

Neoplasms  
Assessment report  
EMA/21773/2022  
Page 43/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, 18 subjects reported 26 AEs related to  neoplasms during the trial. The proportion of subjects 
with  AEs related to all neoplasms (benign and malignant) and the event rates were low in both 
treatment arms (Figure 9). In all, 7 events were serious (all malignant),  4 were severe (all malignant), 
and 22 were mild  or moderate in severity. All events were assessed as unlikely related to trial product 
by the investigator and none led to premature treatment  discontinuation.  
Nine (9)  subjects reported a total  of 13  AEs related to malignant neoplasms during the  trial with  no 
notable treatment difference. One subject in the semaglutide 1.0 mg treatment arm reported 4 events 
of squamous cell carcinoma (at different locations) and 1 event of basal cell carcinoma, accounting for 
the higher event rate in the  semaglutide 1.0  mg arm (Figure 9).  Except for one subject with  4 events 
of squamous cell carcinoma and 1 event of basal cell carcinoma, all AEs related to malignant 
neoplasms were single events reported in single subjects, with  no clustering in  SOCs/PTs, tissue or 
organ of origin. Also, there was no clustering in SOCs/PTs, tissue or organ of origin for the benign 
neoplasms. 
Allergic reactions  
The proportion of subjects reporting AEs related to allergic reactions and the  event rates were low and 
similar between the  treatment arms (Figure 9).  The most frequently reported AEs were in the  skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders SOC. Except for 1  event, all events were non-serious, and the majority 
were mild in  severity. The SAE (urticaria) was reported in the semaglutide 1.0 mg arm and was judged 
unlikely to  related to trial product by the investigator and the subject recovered from the event. 
Diabetic retinopathy   
Fourteen (14)  subjects reported a total  of 14  AEs related to diabetic retinopathy during the trial (Figure 
9). The proportion of subjects with  these AEs and the corresponding event rates were similar between 
the treatment arms. The most frequently reported AE was diabetic retinopathy, and the remaining 
events were distributed across several PTs. The majority of events were mild in severity and judged as 
unlikely related to trial product by the investigator. Since the  majority of events with  additional data 
collection were reported in  connection with the  end of treatment eye examination, the outcome for 
most AEs related to diabetic retinopathy were reported as not  recovered. No SAEs were reported, and 
no events led to premature treatment discontinuation. 
Medication  errors  
Overdose because of medication errors occurred in 5 patients, i.e. 5 events in 4 patients in  the 
semaglutide 2.0 mg arm and 1 event in the semaglutide 1.0 mg arm. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse  event/deaths/other  significant events   
Three deaths were reported during the trial: 
• 
• 
semaglutide 2.0 mg: 2 subjects; events: head injury and death (reason unknown) 
semaglutide 1.0 mg: 1 subject; event: neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder 
The proportions of subjects reporting SAEs and the corresponding event rates were comparable 
between the treatment arms: 
• 
• 
semaglutide 2.0 mg: 4.4% subjects; 7.1  events per 100 PYE 
semaglutide 1.0 mg: 5.2% subjects; 9.7  events per 100 PYE 
SAEs were distributed across multiple  SOCs and PTs with  no clustering observed in either treatment 
arm.

The SAEs that  were deemed possibly or probably related to the study drug by the investigator included 
constipation (1  patient), oesophagitis (1 patient),  nausea (1 patient),  vomiting (1 patient),  atrial 
fibrillation (1  patient), myocardial infarction (1 patient),  cholelithiasis (1 patient),  weight decrease (1 
patient),  dehydration (1 patient)  and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (1 patient). 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings  
Apart from the pancreatic enzymes lipase and amylase, no notable change over the course of the trial 
was observed in any of the biochemistry or haematology laboratory parameters  
In both treatment groups, mean (geometric) levels of lipase increased by 30% and amylase increased 
by 20%. The increase in lipase and amylase occurred during the initial  20 weeks of treatment, followed 
by a slight  further increase in mean levels during the  rest of the on-treatment  period. There were no 
AEs related to pancreatitis. 
2.6.8.5.  Safety  in special populations  
An overview of the results for the safety of semaglutide 2.0 mg in the subgroups investigated is 
provided in Figure 10. 
Apart from the subgroups presented here, no other parameters for safety in special group and 
situations  were evaluated for trial 4506.  
Overall, the trial population  did not display markedly different AE profiles for semaglutide 2.0 mg 
relative to semaglutide 1.0 mg, when  divided into subgroups by the described intrinsic and extrinsic 
factors Figure  10).

Baseline  age 
Overall, the treatment differences for all AEs, SAEs and severe AEs were similar across subgroups of 
age. However, there appeared to be a slightly more pronounced treatment difference in the reporting 
of AEs leading to premature treatment discontinuation  of trial product in  subjects with  age ≥75  years, 
albeit the number of events was low (5 subjects [31.3%]  vs 2 subjects [11.1]  for semaglutide 2.0 mg 
vs semaglutide 1.0 mg, respectively) More pronounced treatment  differences in the  reporting of AEs 
among subjects ≥75  years were seen for: 
•  Diarrhoea (2 subject [12.5%] vs 1 subject [5.6%] for semaglutide 2.0 mg vs semaglutide 
1.0 mg, respectively) 
•  Vomiting (3 subjects [18.8%]  vs 1 subject [5.6%]  for semaglutide 2.0 mg vs semaglutide 
1.0 mg, respectively) 
Baseline  body weight 
Overall, the treatment differences for all AEs, SAEs, severe AEs and AEs leading to premature 
treatment discontinuation  of the trial product were similar across body weight  subgroups. However, 
Assessment report

there appeared to be a slightly more pronounced treatment difference in the reporting of all AEs and 
AEs leading to  premature treatment discontinuation  of trial product in the lowest baseline body weight 
category, albeit the number of subjects within  this  subgroup was low (all AEs: 25 subjects [75.8%]  vs 
25 subjects [55.6%];  AEs leading to premature treatment discontinuation:  5 subjects [15.2%] vs 2 
subjects [4.4%] for semaglutide 2.0 mg vs semaglutide 1.0 mg, respectively). More pronounced 
treatment differences in the reporting of AEs among subjects with  a baseline body weight  of <70  kg 
was seen for: 
•  Nausea (11 subjects [33.3%] vs 7 subjects [15.6%]  for semaglutide 2.0 mg vs semaglutide 
1.0 mg, respectively) 
The more pronounced treatment  difference in reporting of AEs of nausea and AEs leading to premature 
treatment discontinuation  among subjects with  a baseline body weight of <70 kg could be related to 
the higher exposure in these subjects or the low number of subjects in this  subgroup. 
Baseline  renal  function 
Overall, no treatment differences were observed in reporting of AEs, SAEs, severe AEs and AEs leading 
to premature treatment  discontinuation of trial product across subgroups of baseline renal function. For 
subjects with moderate renal impairment there were overall more pronounced treatment  differences in 
the reporting of AEs within: 
•  Vomiting (3 subjects [21.4%]  vs 0 subjects for semaglutide 2.0  mg vs semaglutide 1.0 mg, 
respectively). 
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events   
Reference is made to results from the NN9536  semaglutide s.c. 2.4  mg (STEP) programme, where 
anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were assessed for all subjects included in the  STEP 1 and STEP 2 trials. 
STEP 2  trial included subjects with  T2D and overweight or obesity. In this  trial, 1% (4/396)  of exposed 
subjects developed ADAs at the  semaglutide 1.0  mg dose, whereas 3% (12/401)  of exposed subjects 
developed ADAs at the 2.4 mg dose. No influence of ADAs on body weight  and HbA1c was observed.  
2.6.8.7.  Safety  related  to drug-drug interactions and other interactions  
The potential of high dose semaglutide to delay gastric emptying may influence the absorption of 
concomitantly administered oral medical products (described under ‘Pharmacokinetics’). 
2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse  events   
The proportion of subjects with  AEs leading to premature discontinuation  was low and similar in  both 
the treatment arms (4.4% of subjects in the semaglutide 2.0 mg arm and 4.6%  of subjects in 
semaglutide 1.0 mg arm). AEs leading to premature discontinuation  were predominantly 
gastrointestinal disorders (3.3%  of subjects in the  semaglutide 2.0  mg arm and 2.7% of subjects in 
semaglutide 1.0 mg arm). 
Assessment report  
EMA/21773/2022  
Page 47/60 
 
 
 
 
2.6.8.9.  Post marketing experience   
The safety profile of the lower dose semaglutide is well established from marketing authorisation 
studies and post-marketing experience. The safety data were in line with  the safety and tolerability 
profile of the GLP 1 RA drug class with  no new or unexpected findings.  The higher incidence of patients 
experiencing gastrointestinal adverse events is considered manageable: the higher dose of 
semaglutide can be tapered to  1 mg. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety  
Trial 4506, a total of 959  subjects were exposed to trial products, with  479 subjects exposed to 
semaglutide 2.0 mg and 480 subjects to semaglutide 1.0 mg. Exposure was defined as the time from 
first date to last date of dose of trial product plus the ascertainment window of 49 days (both  dates 
inclusive).  
Adverse events 
A slightly higher proportion of subjects experienced AEs in the semaglutide 2.0 mg treatment arm 
compared to the semaglutide 1.0 mg treatment arm; while, the  event rates were similar between the 
treatment arm (56.8% subjects; 189.1  events per 100 PYE vs 52.3%  subjects; 201.4 events per 100 
PYE).  
As expected for the GLP-1 RA drug class, gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported 
AEs in both treatment arms. Compared to the semaglutide 1.0 mg arm, slightly more subjects in the 
semaglutide 2.0 mg arm reported AEs across SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders. Nausea occurred in 
similar proportions of patients when treated with  semaglutide 1 mg and 2  mg, respectively, diarrhoea 
and vomiting in higher proportions on semaglutide 2 mg. The gastrointestinal adverse reactions led to 
treatment discontinuation  in similar proportions in the  semaglutide 1 mg and 2 mg treatment groups.  
Infections and infestations  are the second most frequent AEs affecting 16.9% of the subjects in both 
treatment arms, i.e. there is no difference between the dosing groups. There was no consistent  pattern 
of any types of infections and no suggestion of a cause-effect association with  the high dose 
semaglutide in the available data. 
Events of special interest 
The proportion of subjects with  AEs related to gastrointestinal disorders was slightly higher with 
semaglutide 2.0 mg (34.0%)  compared to semaglutide 1.0  mg (30.8%).   
The proportions of subjects reporting SAEs and the corresponding event rates were comparable 
between the treatment arms. Three deaths were reported during the  trial:(semaglutide 2.0 mg: 2 
subjects; semaglutide 1.0  mg: 1 subject).  
The proportion of subjects with  AEs related to cardiovascular disorders was 5.0% in the  semaglutide 
2.0 mg arm and 4.0% in the semaglutide 1.0 mg arm with  comparable event rates between the 
treatment arms. A CV outcome trial  was conducted with  the lower dose semaglutide, which did not 
indicate an increased risk.  However, trial 4506 was not designed to evaluate impact of the high dose 
semaglutide on CV risk reduction. In addition,  the difference vs semaglutide 1.0 mg was not due to 
MACE events, but mainly due to events of palpitations (5  subjects vs 1 subject) and atrial fibrillation  (2 
subjects vs 1 subject). Although  it is unknown whether or not the CV benefit demonstrated in SUSTAIN 
6 for semaglutide 0.5  mg and 1.0  mg also is applicable for semaglutide 2.0 mg, there is no indication 
of an increased risk of cardiovascular events.  
Assessment report  
EMA/21773/2022  
Page 48/60 
 
 
 
Pulse rate increased in both  treatment arms and tended to be higher with semaglutide 2.0 mg (1 
beat/min, p=0.055).   
There were no statistically  significant differences in the rate or odds of experiencing severe or blood 
glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia episodes between the treatment arms. Most episodes 
occurred on concomitant treatment with  SU or insulin.  
Nine (9)  subjects reported a total  of 13  AEs related to malignant neoplasms during the  trial with  no 
notable treatment difference.  
Fourteen (14)  subjects reported a total  of 14  AEs related to diabetic retinopathy during the trial. The 
proportion of subjects with  these AEs and the corresponding event rates were similar between the 
treatment arms. However, the concern remains that the  underlying pathological mechanism of 
retinopathy in conjunction with  semaglutide treatment, including  the relationship to time and dose, is 
not fully understood. Since patients  with  uncontrolled and potentially unstable  diabetic retinopathy or 
maculopathy were excluded from study  4506, a potential dose-related effect of the higher dose of 2.0 
mg on retinopathy in patients with  pre-existing unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy cannot be 
excluded based on study 4506  data. The Applicant has updated SmPC section 4.4,  stating that  there is 
no experience with semaglutide 2.0 mg in patients with  type 2 diabetes with uncontrolled or potentially 
unstable diabetic retinopathy, and that treatment  with  semaglutide 2.0  mg is not  recommended in 
these patients.  
Overdose because of medication errors occurred in 5 patients.  
In both treatment groups, mean (geometric) levels of lipase increased by 30% and amylase increased 
by 20%.  
Subgroup analyses 
The subgroups investigated in study 4506  was based on the following intrinsic  factors: age, sex, BMI, 
body weight,  race, ethnicity,  HbA1c, diabetes duration, renal function, and the following extrinsic 
factor: region. Previously investigated subgroups based on CV history, hypertension and hepatic 
function in  the initial dossier on semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0  mg were provided upon request. Based on the 
data, no dose adjustment for safety reasons is recommended in any of the subgroups investigated. 
Overall, the trial population  did not display markedly different AE profiles for semaglutide 2.0 mg 
relative to semaglutide 1.0 mg, when  divided into subgroups. However, there were more adverse 
events in  patients in the lowest body weight (and BMI) subgroup. This was added to the  SmPC.  
Overall, the treatment differences for all AEs, SAEs and severe AEs were similar across subgroups of 
age. However, there appeared to be a slightly more pronounced treatment difference in the reporting 
of AEs leading to premature treatment discontinuation  of trial product in  subjects with  age ≥75  years, 
albeit the number of events was low (5 subjects [31.3%]  vs 2 subjects [11.1]  for semaglutide 2.0 mg 
vs semaglutide 1.0 mg, respectively). More pronounced treatment  differences in the  reporting of AEs 
among subjects ≥75  years were seen for: diarrhoea (12.5% vs 5.6%) and vomiting (18.8%  vs 5.6%). 
There appeared to be a slightly more pronounced treatment  difference in the reporting of all AEs and 
AEs leading to  premature treatment discontinuation  of trial product in the lowest baseline body weight 
category, albeit the number of subjects within  this  subgroup was low (all AEs: 75.8%  vs 55.6%;  AEs 
leading to premature treatment discontinuation  (15.2%  vs 4.4%).  More pronounced treatment 
differences in the reporting of AEs among subjects with  a baseline body weight of <70 kg was seen for 
nausea (33.3%  vs 15.6%). 
Overall, no treatment differences were observed in reporting of AEs, SAEs, severe AEs and AEs leading 
to premature treatment  discontinuation of trial product across subgroups of baseline renal function.

2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety  
The safety data were in line with  the safety and tolerability profile of the GLP 1 RA drug class with  no 
new or unexpected findings. A higher proportion of subjects experienced AEs in the semaglutide 2.0 
mg treatment arm compared to the semaglutide 1.0 mg treatment arm.  As expected for the GLP-1 RA 
drug class, gastrointestinal  disorders were the most frequently reported AEs in both treatment arms. 
Compared to the semaglutide 1.0 mg arm, more subjects in the semaglutide 2.0 mg arm reported AEs 
across SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders. However, since patients  with uncontrolled and potentially 
unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy were excluded from study 4506,  a dose-related effect of 
2.0 mg on retinopathy cannot be excluded. The Applicant has updated SmPC section 4.4,  stating  that 
there is no experience with semaglutide 2.0  mg in patients with  type 2 diabetes with  uncontrolled or 
potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy, and that treatment with  semaglutide 2.0  mg is not 
recommended in these patients.

2.7.4.  Conclusion  
The CHMP considered that  the risk management plan version 6.1 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance  
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system  
The CHMP considered that  the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.  Details on the Novo Nordisk 
pharmacovigilance system master file and the qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance 
(QPPV) can be found in the original marketing authorisation application. This is regarded 
acceptable. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the  list of Union reference dates (EURD list)  provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC  and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Product information  
2.9.1.  User consultation  
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with  target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH  and has been found acceptable for the  following reasons: 
No full user consultation with  target patient  groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Ozempic doses of 0.25 mg, 0.5  mg and 1 mg. The 
bridging report submitted by the MAH  has been found acceptable. 
Assessment report

2.9.2.  Additional monitoring  
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU)  726/2004,  Ozempic (semaglutide) is included in the 
additional monitoring list  as it  contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011,  was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that  this will  allow quick identification  of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context  
3.1.1.  Disease or condition  
T2D remains a substantial health care challenge with  a projected worldwide prevalence of 10.9%  (700 
million adults)  by 2045.  T2D is a progressive disease, and persistent hyperglycaemia can lead to 
serious microvascular and macrovascular complications. Despite the availability of several treatments, 
optimising glycaemic control remains a challenge in many patients. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need  
Semaglutide for once-weekly s.c. injection  (Ozempic) is approved worldwide for treatment of type 2 
diabetes (T2D) at  maintenance doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0  mg. Semaglutide has been investigated in a 
comprehensive global clinical development programme (SUSTAIN) involving more than  11,000 
subjects across 11 phase 3 trials, including  a dedicated cardiovascular outcomes trial.  
Two maintenance doses of semaglutide are currently approved for the treatment  of T2D: 0.5  mg and 
1.0 mg. Across the SUSTAIN programme, larger reductions in  HbA1c and body weight were consistently 
observed with semaglutide 1.0 mg than  with 0.5  mg. However, it  was observed that  20-30% of 
patients receiving semaglutide 1.0 mg did not  achieve the treatment target of HbA1c <7.0%. 
A third maintenance dose of once-weekly semaglutide s.c. 2.0 mg is developed for patients  with T2D 
who can benefit from additional glucose-lowering and body weight  loss as the disease progresses. In 
this application,  data from the phase 3b Trial NN9535-4506  are presented to support the use of 
semaglutide 2.0 mg for the  treatment of T2D. Additionally, semaglutide is being developed for weight 
management using  a once-weekly dose of 2.4 mg. 
The present indication  remains unchanged by this  line extension. The proposed update of the posology 
reads as follows: 
After at least 4  weeks with a dose of 1 mg once weekly, the dose can be increased to 2 mg once 
weekly to further improve glycaemic control. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies  
Dose finding 
Assessment report  
EMA/21773/2022  
Page 53/60 
 
 
 
 
To explore the potential of higher semaglutide doses, the phase 2 Trial NN9535-4191  (hereafter 
referred to as Trial 4191)  was conducted. In Trial 4191, once-daily semaglutide s.c. doses up to  0.3 
mg (equivalent to ~2.1 mg once-weekly) were investigated in 705  subjects with  T2D. Data from Trial 
4191  and the  SUSTAIN trials were included in the  exposure-response model. With dose increase from 
semaglutide 1.0 mg to 2.0 mg, a reduction in HbA1c of 0.26%-points  was predicted. In addition,  an 
additional reduction in body weight of a least 2.5  kg is to  be expected. 
Pivotal study 
Trial 4506 was a multinational,  multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, two-armed, active-comparator 
trial with  a 49-week trial period (incl. screening, dose-escalation, 40  weeks treatment and 9 weeks 
follow-up). A total  of 961  adults with  T2D were randomised 1:1 to treatment  with  once-weekly 
semaglutide 2.0 mg or 1.0 mg. Subjects with  T2D were enrolled in the trial (HbA1c of 8-10%).  Patients 
were treated with  metformin alone or in combination with  SU. The trial  design is acceptable. 
• 
The primary objective was to establish the superior effect of semaglutide s.c. 2.0 mg once-
weekly versus semaglutide s.c. 1.0  mg once-weekly on glycaemic control in subjects with  T2D, 
on a background of metformin with  or without  SU treatment. 
•  Secondary objectives were to compare the effect of semaglutide s.c. 2.0 mg once-weekly 
versus semaglutide s.c. 1.0  mg once-weekly in subjects with  T2D, on a background of 
metformin with  or without  SU treatment,  on body weight,  vital signs, hypoglycaemia and 
general safety and tolerability.  
Of the 961 randomised subjects, 97.1%  completed the  trial, and 92.5% completed treatment, equally 
balanced between the two  treatment arms.  
Subjects enrolled in this trial  had a mean age of 58 years, mean HbA1c of 8.9%,  mean duration of 
diabetes of 9.5  years and a mean body weight of 99.3  kg. Approximately 74% of subjects had a BMI 
≥30 kg/m2, and 58.6%  of the population was male. Characteristics were comparable between 
treatment groups. Baseline HbA1c was somewhat higher than  that  in most other studies with 
semaglutide. 
Overall, few subjects (2.9%)  initiated  rescue medication, predominantly constituting  SU or SGLT2 
inhibitor  classes, during the treatment. A greater proportion of subjects in the  semaglutide 1.0  mg arm 
required use of rescue medication compared to the  semaglutide 2.0  mg arm (4.2%  vs. 1.7%  subjects). 
3.2.  Favourable effects  
Pivotal study 
The estimated mean HbA1c reduced to  6.7% from a relatively high baseline value of 8.9% (estimated 
mean change from baseline of -2.2%-point,  hypothetical estimand). Comparatively, in the semaglutide 
1.0 mg arm, the estimated mean change from baseline was -1.9%-point.  Similar results were 
observed using the treatment policy estimand strategy. The estimated treatment difference in HbA1c 
reduction between 1.0 and 2.0 mg was 0.23%  (hypothetical estimand) and 0.18% (treatment  policy 
estimand).  
A greater proportion of subjects achieved HbA1c target levels (ADA: <7.0%  or AACE: ≤6.5%)  at week 
40 with  semaglutide 2.0 mg compared to semaglutide 1.0 mg, as evaluated by the  treatment estimand 
(64.4%  vs 55.8%  for HbA1c<7%;  49.4%  vs 37.1%  for HbA1c <6.5%). 
In general, results concerning HbA1c were similar across pre-specified subgroups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/21773/2022

Semaglutide 2.0  mg was superior to semaglutide 1.0 mg for the  secondary confirmatory endpoint of 
change from baseline to week 40 in body weight as evaluated by the  hypothetical estimand (-0.93 [-
1.68;  -0.18]95%CI, p=0.0155).  However, superiority could not  be confirmed with the  treatment policy 
estimand (-0.77  [-1.55; 0.01]95%CI,  p=0.0535). 
After 40 weeks of treatment, a reduction in blood pressure was observed for both doses of 
semaglutide. There were no relevant differences between the 1.0  mg and the  2.0 mg dose. 
STEP 2  trial with  semaglutide 2.4  mg (other procedure) 
One of the  4 trials in the clinical development programme for semaglutide 2.4 mg in weight 
management (NN9536-4374,  STEP 2) investigated the weight-reducing  potential and the safety of 
semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg administered once weekly as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and 
increased physical activity in subjects with  type 2 diabetes (T2D) and overweight or obesity (BMI ≥27 
kg/m2) as compared to placebo. The dose in the weight  loss programme (2.4  mg) is higher than  that 
used in pivotal study 4191 (2.0  mg), and the study will be assessed in detail in a separate procedure. 
However, study results may be used for comparison purposes in the present application. For the 
treatment policy estimand, the estimated treatment difference in HbA1c between semaglutide 2.4 mg 
and semaglutide 1.0 mg (supportive secondary endpoint) was −0.15%  [−0.34;  0.04]95%  CI. With 
respect to  body weight,  the estimated treatment difference was −2.65% [−3.66;  −1.64]95%  CI for 
semaglutide 2.4 mg vs semaglutide 1.0 mg. 
Comparability study 
Trial 3687 was a randomised, two-period, incomplete cross-over trial in healthy subjects investigating 
if comparing different semaglutide drug product concentrations (1  mg/mL, 3 mg/mL, and 10 mg/mL) 
met the bioequivalence criterion concerning the total  exposure after single s.c. injections. These data 
support comparability between the semaglutide drug product concentrations of 1.34  mg/mL (used in 
Trial 4506) and 2.68  mg/mL (to-be-marketed drug product for semaglutide 2.0  mg) as the 
concentration range is contained within  the concentration range tested  in Trial 3687. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects  
The estimated treatment difference in HbA1c reduction between 1.0 and 2.0 mg was modest (0.23%, 
hypothetical estimand; 0.18%,  treatment policy estimand),  especially when the  relatively high baseline 
HbA1c is taken into account. A modest additional proportion of subjects achieved HbA1c target levels 
at week 40  with semaglutide 2.0 mg compared to semaglutide 1.0 mg (hypothetical  treatment 
estimand (64.4%  vs 55.8%  for target HbA1c<7%).  This modest effect is in line with  the small 
additional HbA1c lowering effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to 1.0  mg in STEP2 (-0.15%;  weight 
management clinical development programme).  
Concerning body weight,  superiority could not be confirmed with  the treatment policy estimand. In 
addition, the  additional reduction in body weight  of 0.8-0.9  kg is less than  expected from the dose-
finding study (-2.5  kg). The additional  reduction in body weight  is also less than that  observed in in 
STEP2 (-2.6 kg), but  this may be explained by the higher dose in STEP2. 
In the submitted  trial, semaglutide was studied as an add-on to metformin (and SU) but not in 
combination with  other antihyperglycemic agents (in  contrast to the phase 3  studies where 
semaglutide was given as an add-on to various background medications). However, it is considered 
likely that  the incremental benefit of the  higher dose is maintained when used in  combination with 
other glucose-lowering medications.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects  
Pivotal trial 
Trial 4506, a total of 959  subjects were exposed to trial products, with  479 subjects exposed to 
semaglutide 2.0 mg and 480 subjects to semaglutide 1.0 mg.  
A higher proportion of subjects experienced AEs in the semaglutide 2.0 mg treatment arm compared to 
the semaglutide 1.0 mg treatment arm; while, the event rates were similar between the treatment  arm 
(956.8%  subjects; 189.1 events per 100  PYE vs 52.3% subjects; 201.4  events per 100 PYE).  
As expected for the GLP-1 RA drug class, gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported 
AEs in both treatment arms. Compared to the semaglutide 1.0 mg arm, more subjects in  the 
semaglutide 2.0 mg arm reported AEs across SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders. Nausea occurred in 
similar proportions of patients when treated with  semaglutide 1 mg and 2  mg, respectively, diarrhoea 
and vomiting in higher proportions on semaglutide 2 mg. The gastrointestinal adverse reactions led to 
treatment discontinuation  in similar proportions in the  semaglutide 1 mg and 2 mg treatment groups. 
Subgroup analyses 
Overall, the trial population  did not display markedly different AE profiles for semaglutide 2.0 mg 
relative to semaglutide 1.0 mg when divided into subgroups.  
Greater proportions of patients  in the oldest age-group >=75  years, and in  the lowest BMI group 
<25 kg/m2 and in the  lowest body weight  group <70  kg experienced gastrointestinal AEs. 
Events of special interest 
The proportion of subjects with  AEs related to gastrointestinal disorders was higher with  semaglutide 
2.0 mg (34.0%)  compared to semaglutide 1.0 mg (30.8%).   
The proportions of subjects reporting SAEs and the corresponding event rates were comparable 
between the treatment arms. Three deaths were reported during the  trial:(semaglutide 2.0 mg: 2 
subjects; semaglutide 1.0  mg: 1 subject).  
Nine (9)  subjects reported a total  of 13  AEs related to malignant neoplasms during the  trial with  no 
notable treatment difference.  
Fourteen (14)  subjects reported a total  of 14  AEs related to diabetic retinopathy during the trial. The 
proportion of subjects with  these AEs and the corresponding event rates were similar between the 
treatment arms.  
In both treatment groups, mean (geometric) levels of lipase increased by 30% and amylase increased 
by 20%, but  there were no AEs related to pancreatitis. 
STEP 2  trial with  semaglutide 2.4  mg (other procedure) 
The STEP 2 trial (one of the 4 trials in the  clinical development programme for semaglutide 2.4 mg in 
weight  management (NN9536-4374))  may also be used for comparison purposes with  respect to  safety 
in the present application. In this study, 403  subjects with T2D were exposed to semaglutide 2.4 mg 
for 533 PYE. In general, the safety profile of semaglutide 2.4  mg was consistent  with the  2.0 mg dose.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects  
The proportion of subjects with  AEs related to cardiovascular disorders was 5.0% in the  semaglutide 
2.0 mg arm and 4.0% in the semaglutide 1.0 mg arm with  comparable event rates between the 
treatment arms. The pulse rate increased in both treatment arms and tended to  be higher with

semaglutide 2.0 mg (1 beat/min, p=0.055).  A CV outcome trial was conducted with  the lower dose 
semaglutide, which did not  indicate an increased risk, but the higher dose situation is unclear However, 
trial 4506  was not  designed to evaluate impact of the  high dose semaglutide on CV risk reduction. In 
addition, the  difference vs semaglutide 1.0 mg was not due to MACE events, but mainly due to  events 
of palpitations (5 subjects vs 1 subject) and atrial fibrillation  (2 subjects vs 1 subject). Although it  is 
unknown whether or not the CV benefit demonstrated in SUSTAIN 6 for semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 
mg also is applicable for semaglutide 2.0 mg, there is no indication of an increased risk of 
cardiovascular events. 
Retinal disorders were included as a safety focus area for the STEP 2 trial (diabetes patients)  in the 
semaglutide 2.4 mg for the  weight management programme. In STEP 2, subjects with uncontrolled 
and potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy were not  eligible for enrolment in the 
trial. A total of 85 AEs of retinal disorders were identified by the pre-defined MedDRA search. These 
events were reported by a larger proportion of subjects with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 2.4  mg 
compared to placebo (6.2%,  6.9% and 4.2%,  respectively).  
The Company provided data on the effects of semaglutide on DRP and MACE in patients with 
"uncontrolled or potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy" in SUSTAIN 6 (semaglutide 0.5  and 1.0  mg 
in patients  with diabetes). The estimated HRs in the ‘uncontrolled or potentially unstable diabetic 
retinopathy’ subpopulation in SUSTAIN 6 are consistent with  those in the overall population. However, 
the absolute effects are of a different magnitude. In the ‘uncontrolled or potentially unstable diabetic 
retinopathy’ subpopulation for every 100 patients that  were treated, semaglutide prevented 3 MACE 
events, but caused 6 events of serious DRP. Therefore, a strong warning in  the SmPC was required. 
Interactions 
Uncertainties also exist with  regard to potential  interactions (delay of gastric emptying and of intestinal 
transit)  of high  dose semaglutide with concomitantly administered oral drugs. 
The rate or odds of experiencing severe or blood glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia 
episodes were comparable between the treatment arms. However, this  was based on a post-hoc 
defined analysis.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion  
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
In principle, the proposed study design and conducted pivotal does not directly reflect the way in which 
the higher dose will  be applied in clinical practice. A forced titration  study design targeting a certain 
cut-off would be more appropriate. However, for additional  desirable glycaemic control, the dosage can 
be increased; initially up to 1 mg and now up to  2 mg once weekly. 
The higher HbA1c range at baseline led to the  inclusion of a subgroup of patients for whom  treatment 
intensification is more important, and these patients may benefit more from treatment with  the higher 
semaglutide dose. Although study  4506 was not specifically performed in the target population,  the 
results support the use of the  higher dose in patients that  are not  sufficiently controlled with  the lower 
dose.

Body weight  is an important  endpoint for patients with  type 2  diabetes. The reduction in body weight 
of 0.8-0.9  kg is small. 
The safety profile of the lower dose semaglutide is well established from marketing authorisation 
studies and post-marketing experience. The safety data were in line with  the safety and tolerability 
profile of the GLP 1 RA drug class with  no new or unexpected findings.  The higher incidence of patients 
experiencing gastrointestinal adverse events is considered manageable: the higher dose of 
semaglutide can be tapered to  1 mg. However, the concern remains that the  underlying pathological 
mechanism of retinopathy in conjunction with  semaglutide treatment, including  the relationship to time 
and dose, is not  fully understood. Since patients with  uncontrolled and potentially unstable diabetic 
retinopathy or maculopathy were excluded from study 4506,  the observation of no difference between 
the 1.0  mg and 2.0  mg treatment arms with  respect to the  proportions of subjects having diabetic 
retinopathy at the end-of-study eye examination, overall, or subjects experiencing new onset or 
worsening of diabetic retinopathy from baseline to end-of-study, may only apply to this selected 
patient population  without  pre-existing unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy. In combination 
with  data from the STEP2 trial, a potential dose-related effect of the higher dose of 2.0 mg on 
retinopathy in patients with  pre-existing unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy cannot be 
excluded. The Applicant has updated SmPC section 4.4, stating  that there is no experience with 
semaglutide 2.0 mg in patients with  type 2 diabetes with uncontrolled or potentially unstable diabetic 
retinopathy, and that  treatment with  semaglutide 2.0  mg is not  recommended in these patients. 
The effect of the higher dose semaglutide on CV risk is not clear, but  there is no suggestion of an 
increased risk of cardiovascular events. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks  
The effect size of additional efficacy afforded by the higher dose may be beneficial for some patients.  
The overall B/R for the new higher dose strength of semaglutide (2 mg) is considered positive. 
The application is approvable.   
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance  
Not  applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions  
The overall benefit/risk balance of Ozempic is positive, subject to the conditions stated  in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP  review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP  considers by 
consensus that  the benefit-risk balance of, Ozempic 2 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen, is 
favourable in the following indication(s): 
Assessment report  
EMA/21773/2022

Ozempic is indicated for the treatment of adults with  insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus 
as an adjunct  to diet and exercise 
• 
as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or 
contraindications 
in addition to  other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes. 
• 
For trial results with  respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, 
and the populations studied, see sections 4.4,  4.5 and 5.1. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the  marketing authorisation for Ozempic subject 
to the following  conditions:

ZEPATIER for 12 weeks
ZEPATIER for 12 weeks
ZEPATIER for 16 weeks plus ribavirinA should be considered in
patients with baseline HCV RNA level >800,000 IU/mL to minimise
the risk of treatment failure (see section 5.1).
A In the adult clinical studies, the dose of ribavirin was weight-based (< 66 kg = 800 mg/day, 66 to
80 kg = 1,000 mg/day, 81 to 105 kg = 1,200 mg/day, > 105 kg = 1,400 mg/day) administered in two
divided doses with food.
For specific dosage instructions for ribavirin, including dose modification, refer to the ribavirin
Summary of Product Characteristics.
Patients should be instructed that if vomiting occurs within 4 hours of dosing, an additional tablet can
be taken up to 8 hours before the next dose. If vomiting occurs more than 4 hours after dosing, no
further dose is needed.
In case a dose of ZEPATIER is missed and it is within 16 hours of the time ZEPATIER is usually
taken, the patient should be instructed to take ZEPATIER as soon as possible and then take the next
dose of ZEPATIER at the usual time. If more than 16 hours have passed since ZEPATIER is usually
taken, then the patient should be instructed that the missed dose should NOT be taken and to take the
next dose per the usual dosing schedule. Patients should be instructed not to take a double dose.
Elderly
No dose adjustment of ZEPATIER is required for elderly patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Renal impairment and end stage renal disease (ESRD)
No dose adjustment of ZEPATIER is required in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal
impairment (including patients receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment of ZEPATIER is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh
A). ZEPATIER is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh
B or C) (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). 
The safety and efficacy of ZEPATIER have not been established in liver transplant recipients. 
Paediatric population
No dosage adjustment of ZEPATIER is required in paediatric patients 12 years of age and older who
weigh at least 30 kg (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).
The safety and efficacy of ZEPATIER in children aged less than 12 years have not been established. 
3
Method of administration
For oral use.
The film-coated tablets should be swallowed whole and may be taken with or without food (see
section 5.2). 
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Co-administration with inhibitors of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B (OATP1B), such as
rifampicin, atazanavir, darunavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir, cobicistat or ciclosporin (see
sections 4.4 and 4.5).
Co-administration with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) or P-glycoprotein (P-gp), such as
efavirenz, phenytoin, carbamazepine, bosentan, etravirine, modafinil or St. John’s wort (Hypericum
perforatum) (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
ALT elevations
The rate of late ALT elevations during treatment is directly related to the plasma exposure to
grazoprevir. During clinical studies with ZEPATIER with or without ribavirin, < 1 % of subjects
experienced elevations of ALT from normal levels to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal
(ULN), (see section 4.8). Higher rates of late ALT elevations occurred in females (2 % [11/652]),
Asians (2 % [4/165]), and subjects aged ≥ 65 years (2 % [3/187]) (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). These late
ALT elevations generally occurred at or after treatment week 8.
Hepatic laboratory testing should be performed prior to therapy, at treatment week 8, and as clinically
indicated. For patients receiving 16 weeks of therapy, additional hepatic laboratory testing should be
performed at treatment week 12.
Patients should be instructed to consult their healthcare professional without delay if they have
onset of fatigue, weakness, lack of appetite, nausea and vomiting, jaundice or discoloured
faeces.
Discontinuation of ZEPATIER should be considered if ALT levels are confirmed to be greater
than 10 times the ULN.
ZEPATIER should be discontinued if ALT elevation is accompanied by signs or symptoms of
liver inflammation or increasing conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, or international
normalised ratio (INR).
Genotype-specific activity
The efficacy of ZEPATIER has not been demonstrated in HCV genotypes 2, 3, 5 and 6. ZEPATIER is
not recommended in patients infected with these genotypes.
Retreatment
The efficacy of ZEPATIER in patients previously exposed to ZEPATIER, or to medicinal products of
the same classes as those of ZEPATIER (NS5A inhibitors or NS3/4A inhibitors other than telaprevir,
simeprevir, boceprevir), has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1).

Interactions with medicinal products
Co-administration of ZEPATIER and OATP1B inhibitors is contraindicated because it may
significantly increase grazoprevir plasma concentrations. 
Co-administration of ZEPATIER and CYP3A or P-gp inducers is contraindicated because it may
significantly decrease elbasvir and grazoprevir plasma concentrations and may lead to a reduced
therapeutic effect of ZEPATIER (see sections 4.3, 4.5 and 5.2). 
The concomitant use of ZEPATIER and strong CYP3A inhibitors increases elbasvir and grazoprevir
concentrations, and co-administration is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
HCV/HBV (hepatitis B virus) co-infection
Cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after
treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before
initiation of treatment. HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and should
therefore be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines.
Use in diabetic patients
Diabetics may experience improved glucose control potentially resulting in symptomatic
hypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV direct acting antiviral (DAA) treatment. Glucose levels of
diabetic patients initiating DAA therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the first
3 months, and their diabetic medication modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the
diabetic care of the patient should be informed when DAA therapy is initiated.
Paediatric population
ZEPATIER is not indicated for use in children under 12 years of age.
Excipients
ZEPATIER contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose
intolerance, total lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal
product.
ZEPATIER contains 69.85 mg sodium per tablet, equivalent to 3.5 % of the WHO recommended
maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ZEPATIER
Grazoprevir is a substrate of OATP1B drug transporters. Co-administration of ZEPATIER with
medicinal products that inhibit OATP1B transporters is contraindicated because it may result in a
significant increase in the plasma concentration of grazoprevir (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Elbasvir and grazoprevir are substrates of CYP3A and P-gp. Co-administration of inducers of CYP3A
or P-gp with ZEPATIER is contraindicated because it may decrease elbasvir and grazoprevir plasma
concentrations, which may lead to reduced therapeutic effect of ZEPATIER (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Co-administration of ZEPATIER with strong CYP3A inhibitors increases elbasvir and grazoprevir
plasma concentrations, and co-administration is not recommended (see Table 2 and section 4.4).
5
Co-administration of ZEPATIER with P-gp inhibitors is expected to have a minimal effect on the
plasma concentrations of ZEPATIER.
The potential for grazoprevir to be a breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) substrate cannot be
excluded.
Potential for ZEPATIER to affect other medicinal products
Elbasvir and grazoprevir are inhibitors of the drug transporter BCRP at the intestinal level in humans
and may increase plasma concentrations of co-administered BCRP substrates. Elbasvir is not a
CYP3A inhibitor in vitro and grazoprevir is a weak CYP3A inhibitor in humans. Co-administration
with grazoprevir did not result in clinically relevant increases in exposures of CYP3A substrates.
Therefore, no dose adjustment is required for CYP3A substrates when co-administered with
ZEPATIER. 
Elbasvir has minimal intestinal P-gp inhibition in humans, and does not result in clinically relevant
increases in concentrations of digoxin (a P-gp substrate), with an 11% increase in plasma AUC.
Grazoprevir is not a P-gp inhibitor based on in vitro data. Elbasvir and grazoprevir are not OATP1B
inhibitors in humans. Based on in vitro data, clinically significant interactions with ZEPATIER as an
inhibitor of other CYP enzymes, UGT1A1, esterases (CES1, CES2, and CatA), OAT1, OAT3, and
OCT2 are not expected. Based on in vitro data, a potential for GZR to inhibit BSEP cannot be
excluded. Multiple-dose administration of elbasvir or grazoprevir is unlikely to induce the metabolism
of medicinal products metabolised by CYP isoforms based on in vitro data. 
Patients treated with vitamin K antagonists 
As liver function may change during treatment with ZEPATIER, a close monitoring of International
Normalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended.
Impact of DAA therapy on drugs metabolized by the liver
Grazoprevir’s weak inhibition of CYP3A may increase levels of CYP3A substrates. In addition, the
plasma concentrations of drugs that are CYP3A substrates may be decreased by improvement in liver
function during DAA therapy, related to clearance of HCV. Therefore, close monitoring and potential
dose adjustment of CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., calcineurin inhibitors)
may be required during therapy, as drug levels may change (see Table 2).
Interactions between ZEPATIER and other medicinal products 
Table 2 provides a listing of assessed or potential medicinal product interactions. An up “↑” or down
“↓” arrow represents a change in exposure that requires monitoring or a dose adjustment of that
medication, or the co-administration is not recommended or contraindicated. No clinically relevant
change in exposure is represented by a horizontal arrow “↔”. 
The medicinal product interactions described are based on results from studies conducted with either
ZEPATIER or elbasvir (EBR) and grazoprevir (GZR) as individual agents, or are predicted medicinal
product interactions that may occur with elbasvir or grazoprevir. The table is not all-inclusive.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
If ZEPATIER is co-administered with ribavirin, the information for ribavirin with regard to
contraception, pregnancy testing, pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility also applies to this
combination regimen (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for the co-administered
medicinal product for additional information). 
Women of childbearing potential / contraception in males and females 
When ZEPATIER is used in combination with ribavirin, women of childbearing potential or their
male partners must use an effective form of contraception during treatment and for a period of time
after the treatment has concluded.
Pregnancy
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with ZEPATIER in pregnant women. Animal
studies do not indicate harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. Because reproduction
19
animal studies are not always predictive of human response, ZEPATIER should be used only if the
potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether elbasvir or grazoprevir and their metabolites are excreted in human milk.
Available pharmacokinetic data in animals has shown excretion of elbasvir and grazoprevir in milk. A
decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from
ZEPATIER therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of
therapy for the woman. 
Fertility
No human data on the effect of elbasvir and grazoprevir on fertility are available. Animal studies do
not indicate harmful effects of elbasvir or grazoprevir on fertility at elbasvir and grazoprevir exposures
higher than the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ZEPATIER (administered alone or in combination with ribavirin) is not likely to have an effect on the
ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be informed that fatigue has been reported during
treatment with ZEPATIER (see section 4.8).
4.8  Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The safety of ZEPATIER was assessed based on 3 placebo-controlled studies and 7 uncontrolled
Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies in approximately 2,000 subjects with chronic hepatitis C infection with
compensated liver disease (with or without cirrhosis).
In clinical studies, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (greater than 10%) were fatigue and
headache. Less than 1 % of subjects treated with ZEPATIER with or without ribavirin had serious
adverse reactions (abdominal pain, transient ischaemic attack and anaemia). Less than 1 % of subjects
treated with ZEPATIER with or without ribavirin permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse
reactions. The frequency of serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in
subjects with compensated cirrhosis were comparable to those seen in subjects without cirrhosis.
When elbasvir/grazoprevir was studied with ribavirin, the most frequent adverse reactions to
elbasvir/grazoprevir + ribavirin combination therapy were consistent with the known safety profile of
ribavirin.
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions
The following adverse reactions were identified in patients taking ZEPATIER without ribavirin for 12
weeks. The adverse reactions are listed below by body system organ class and frequency. Frequencies
are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to
< 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) or very rare (< 1/10,000).

Serum Late ALT elevations
During clinical studies with ZEPATIER with or without ribavirin, regardless of treatment duration,
< 1 % (13/1,690) of subjects experienced elevations of ALT from normal levels to greater than 5 times
the ULN, generally at or after treatment week 8 (mean onset time 10 weeks, range 6-12 weeks). These
late ALT elevations were typically asymptomatic. Most late ALT elevations resolved with ongoing
therapy with ZEPATIER or after completion of therapy (see section 4.4). The frequency of late ALT
elevations was higher in subjects with higher grazoprevir plasma concentration (see sections 4.4, 4.5
and 5.2). The incidence of late ALT elevations was not affected by treatment duration. Cirrhosis was
not a risk factor for late ALT elevations. Less than 1% of subjects treated with ZEPATIER with or
without ribavirin experienced ALT elevations >2.5 – 5 times the ULN during treatment; there were no
treatment discontinuations due to these ALT elevations. 
21
Paediatric population
The safety assessment of Zepatier in paediatric patients aged 12 years and older is based on data from
a Phase 2b, open-label clinical study that enrolled 22 patients who were treated with Zepatier for
12 weeks.The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in clinical studies of
Zepatier in adults. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
Human experience of overdose with ZEPATIER is limited. The highest dose of elbasvir was 200 mg
once daily for 10 days, and a single dose of 800 mg. The highest dose of grazoprevir was 1,000 mg
once daily for 10 days, and a single dose of 1,600 mg. In these healthy volunteer studies, adverse
reactions were similar in frequency and severity to those reported in the placebo groups.
In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of
adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted. 
Haemodialysis does not remove elbasvir or grazoprevir. Elbasvir and grazoprevir are not expected to
be removed by peritoneal dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, Direct acting antivirals, Antivirals for
treatment of HCV infections, ATC code: J05AP54.
Mechanism of action
ZEPATIER combines two direct-acting antiviral agents with distinct mechanisms of action and non-
overlapping resistance profiles to target HCV at multiple steps in the viral lifecycle.
Elbasvir is an inhibitor of HCV NS5A, which is essential for viral RNA replication and virion
assembly. 
Grazoprevir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS3/4A protease which is necessary for the proteolytic
cleavage of the HCV encoded polyprotein (into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and
NS5B proteins) and is essential for viral replication. In a biochemical assay, grazoprevir inhibited the
proteolytic activity of the recombinant NS3/4A protease enzymes from HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, 3 and
4a with IC50 values ranging from 4 to 690 pM. 
Antiviral activity
The EC50 values of elbasvir and grazoprevir against full-length or chimeric replicons encoding NS5A
or NS3 sequences from reference sequences and clinical isolates are presented in Table 5.

Resistance
In cell culture 
HCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to elbasvir and grazoprevir have been selected in cell
culture for genotypes 1a, 1b and 4. 
For elbasvir, in HCV genotype 1a replicons, single NS5A substitutions Q30D/E/H/R, L31M/V and
Y93C/H/N reduced elbasvir antiviral activity by 6- to 2,000-fold. In genotype 1b replicons, single
NS5A substitutions L31F and Y93H reduced elbasvir antiviral activity by 17-fold. In genotype 4
replicons, single NS5A substitutions L30S, M31V, and Y93H reduced elbasvir antiviral activity by 3-
to 23-fold. In general, in HCV genotype 1a, 1b or 4 combinations of elbasvir resistance-associated
substitutions further reduced elbasvir antiviral activity.
For grazoprevir, in HCV genotype 1a replicons, single NS3 substitutions D168A/E/G/S/V reduced
grazoprevir antiviral activity by 2- to 81-fold. In genotype 1b replicons, single NS3 substitutions
F43S, A156S/T/V, and D168A/G/V reduced grazoprevir antiviral activity by 3- to 375-fold. In
genotype 4 replicons, single NS3 substitutions D168A/V reduced grazoprevir antiviral activity by 110-
to 320-fold. In general, in HCV genotype 1a, 1b or 4 replicons, combinations of grazoprevir
resistance-associated substitutions further reduced grazoprevir antiviral activity.
In clinical studies
In a pooled analysis of subjects treated with regimens containing elbasvir/grazoprevir or elbasvir +
grazoprevir with or without ribavirin in Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, resistance analyses were
conducted for 50 subjects who experienced virologic failure and had sequence data available (6 with
on-treatment virologic failure, 44 with post-treatment relapse). 
Treatment-emergent substitutions observed in the viral populations of these subjects based on
genotypes are shown in Table 6. Treatment-emergent substitutions were detected in both HCV drug
targets in 23/37 (62 %) genotype 1a, 1/8 (13 %) genotype 1b and 2/5 (40 %) genotype 4 subjects.

Cross-resistance
Elbasvir is active in vitro against genotype 1a NS5A substitutions, M28V and Q30L, genotype 1b
substitutions, L28M/V, R30Q, L31V, Y93C, and genotype 4 substitution, M31V, which confer
resistance to other NS5A inhibitors. In general, other NS5A substitutions conferring resistance to
NS5A inhibitors may also confer resistance to elbasvir. NS5A substitutions conferring resistance to
elbasvir may reduce the antiviral activity of other NS5A inhibitors. 
24
 
Grazoprevir is active in vitro against the following genotype 1a NS3 substitutions which confer
resistance to other NS3/4A protease inhibitors: V36A/L/M, Q41R, F43L, T54A/S, V55A/I, Y56F,
Q80K/R, V107I, S122A/G/R/T, I132V, R155K, A156S, D168N/S, I170T/V. Grazoprevir is active in
vitro against the following genotype 1b NS3 substitutions conferring resistance to other NS3/4A
protease inhibitors: V36A/I/L/M, Q41L/R, F43S, T54A/C/G/S, V55A/I, Y56F, Q80L/R, V107I,
S122A/G/R, R155E/K/N/Q/S, A156G/S, D168E/N/S, V170A/I/T. Some NS3 substitutions at A156
and at D168 confer reduced antiviral activity to grazoprevir as well as to other NS3/4A protease
inhibitors. 
The substitutions associated with resistance to NS5B inhibitors do not affect the activity of elbasvir or
grazoprevir. 
Persistence of resistance-associated substitutions 
The persistence of elbasvir and grazoprevir treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions in NS5A, and
NS3, respectively, was assessed in genotype 1-infected subjects in Phase 2 and 3 studies whose virus
had treatment-emergent resistance-associated substitution in the drug target, and with available data
through at least 24 weeks post-treatment using population (or Sanger) sequencing. 
Viral populations with treatment-emergent NS5A resistance-associated substitutions were generally
more persistent than NS3 resistance associated substitutions. Among genotype 1a-infected subjects,
NS5A resistance-associated substitutions persisted at detectable levels at follow-up week 12 in 95%
(35/37) of subjects and in 100% (9/9) of subjects with follow-up week 24 data. Among genotype 1b-
infected subjects, NS5A resistance-associated substitutions persisted at detectable levels in 100% (7/7)
of subjects at follow-up week 12 and in 100% (3/3) of subjects with follow-up week 24 data.
Among genotype 1a-infected subjects, NS3 resistance-associated substitutions persisted at detectable
levels at follow-up week 24 in 31% (4/13) of subjects. Among genotype 1b-infected subjects, NS3
resistance-associated substitutions persisted at detectable levels at follow-up week 24 in 50% (1/2) of
subjects. 
Due to the limited number of genotype 4-infected subjects with treatment emergent NS5A and NS3
resistance associated substitutions, trends in persistence of treatment emergent substitutions in this
genotype could not be established.
The long-term clinical impact of the emergence or persistence of virus containing ZEPATIER
resistance-associated substitutions is unknown.
Effect of baseline HCV polymorphisms on treatment response 
In pooled analyses of subjects who achieved SVR12 or met criteria for virologic failure, the
prevalence and impact of NS5A polymorphisms (including M28T/A, Q30E/H/R/G/K/D, L31M/V/F,
H58D, and Y93C/H/N) and NS3 polymorphisms (substitutions at positions 36, 54, 55, 56, 80, 107,
122, 132, 155, 156, 158, 168, 170, and 175) that confer greater than 5-fold reduction of elbasvir and
grazoprevir antiviral activity respectively in vitro were evaluated. The observed treatment response
differences by treatment regimen in specific patient populations in the presence or absence of baseline
NS5A or NS3 polymorphisms are summarised in Table 7.

Clinical study in subjects with advanced chronic kidney disease with genotype 1 CHC infection
In the C-SURFER study, overall SVR was achieved in 94 % (115/122) of subjects receiving EBR +
GZR for 12 weeks. 
Paediatric population
The efficacy of ZEPATIER was evaluated in an open-label clinical study in 22 paediatric subjects
12 years to less than 18 years of age who received ZEPATIER for 12 weeks. HCV GT1a infected
subjects with one or more baseline NS5A resistance-associated substitutions were excluded from study
participation.
In this study, treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced subjects 12 years to less than 18 years of age
with genotype 1 or 4 CHC, without cirrhosis, were treated with ZEPATIER for 12 weeks. The median
age was 13.5 years (range: 12 to 17); 50 % were female; 95 % were White; the weight range was
28.1 kg to 96.5 kg; 95.5 % had genotype 1 and 4.5 % had genotype 4; 63.6 % were treatment-naïve,
36.4 % were treatment-experienced; 45.5 % had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than
800,000 IU/mL. The overall SVR12 rate was 100 % (22/22). The safety, pharmacokinetics and
efficacy observed in this study were comparable to those observed in adults.
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Following administration of elbasvir/grazoprevir to HCV-infected subjects, elbasvir peak plasma
concentrations occur at a median Tmax of 3 hours (range of 3 to 6 hours); grazoprevir peak plasma
concentrations occur at a median Tmax of 2 hours (range of 30 minutes to 3 hours). For elbasvir, the
absolute bioavailability is estimated to be 32%. For grazoprevir, the absolute bioavailability after a
200 mg single dose ranged from 15 – 27% and after multiple 200 mg doses ranged from 20 – 40%.
31
Relative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of elbasvir/grazoprevir with a high-
fat (900 kcal, 500 kcal from fat) meal to healthy subjects resulted in decreases in elbasvir AUC0-inf and
Cmax of approximately 11 % and 15 %, respectively, and increases in grazoprevir AUC0-inf and Cmax of
approximately 1.5-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively. These differences in elbasvir and grazoprevir
exposure are not clinically relevant; therefore, elbasvir/grazoprevir may be taken without regard to
food.
Elbasvir pharmacokinetics are similar in healthy subjects and HCV-infected subjects. Grazoprevir oral
exposures are approximately 2-fold greater in HCV-infected subjects as compared to healthy subjects.
Based on the population pharmacokinetic modeling in non-cirrhotic, HCV-infected subjects, the
geometric mean steady-state elbasvir AUC0-24 and Cmax  at 50 mg were 2,180 nM•hr and 137 nM,
respectively, and the geometric mean steady-state grazoprevir AUC0-24 and Cmax  at 100 mg were
1,860 nM•hr and 220 nM, respectively. Following once daily administration of elbasvir/grazoprevir to
HCV-infected subjects, elbasvir and grazoprevir reached steady state within approximately 6 days.
Distribution
Elbasvir and grazoprevir are extensively bound (> 99.9 % and 98.8 %, respectively) to human plasma
proteins. Both elbasvir and grazoprevir bind to human serum albumin and  1-acid glycoprotein.
Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
Elimination
The geometric mean apparent terminal half-life (% geometric mean coefficient of variation) is
approximately 24 (24 %) hours at 50 mg elbasvir and approximately 31 (34 %) hours at 100 mg
grazoprevir in HCV-infected subjects. 
Metabolism
Elbasvir and grazoprevir are partially eliminated by oxidative metabolism, primarily by CYP3A. No
circulating metabolites of either elbasvir or grazoprevir were detected in human plasma.
Excretion
The primary route of elimination of elbasvir and grazoprevir is through faeces with almost all
(> 90 %) of the radiolabeled dose recovered in faeces compared to < 1 % in urine.
Linearity/non-linearity
Elbasvir pharmacokinetics were approximately dose-proportional over the range of 5-100 mg once
daily. Grazoprevir pharmacokinetics increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner over the
range of 10-800 mg once daily in HCV-infected subjects.
Pharmacokinetics in special populations
Renal impairment
In non-HCV-infected subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) who were
not on dialysis, elbasvir and grazoprevir AUC values were increased by 86 % and 65 %, respectively,
compared to non-HCV-infected subjects with normal renal function (eGFR > 80 mL/min/1.73 m2). In
non-HCV-infected subjects with dialysis-dependent, severe renal impairment, elbasvir and grazoprevir
AUC values were unchanged compared to subjects with normal renal function. Concentrations of
elbasvir were not quantifiable in the dialysate samples. Less than 0.5 % of grazoprevir was recovered
in dialysate over a 4-hour dialysis session.
In population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients, elbasvir and grazoprevir AUCs were
25 % and 10 % higher, respectively, in dialysis-dependent patients and 46 % and 40 % higher,
32
respectively, in non-dialysis-dependent patients with severe renal impairment compared to elbasvir
and grazoprevir AUC in patients without severe renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment
In  non-HCV-infected  subjects  with  mild  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  A  [CP-A],  score  of  5-6),
elbasvir  AUC0-inf  was  decreased  by  40%  and  grazoprevir  steady-state  AUC0-24  was  increased  70 %
compared to matched healthy subjects.
In non-HCV-infected subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B [CP-B], score of 7-9),
and  severe  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  C  [CP-C],  score  of 10-15)  elbasvir  AUC  decreased  by
28 %  and  12%,  respectively,  while  the  grazoprevir  steady-state  AUC0-24  was  increased  5-fold  and
12-fold respectively, compared to matched healthy subjects (see sections 4.2 and 4.3).
Population PK analyses of HCV-infected patients in Phase 2 and 3 studies demonstrated that
grazoprevir steady-state AUC0-24 increased by approximately 65 % in HCV-infected patients with
compensated cirrhosis (all with CP-A) compared to HCV-infected non-cirrhotic patients, while
elbasvir steady-state AUC was similar (see section 4.2).
Paediatric population
The pharmacokinetics of elbasvir and grazoprevir have been evaluated in 22 paediatric subjects
12 years of age and older who received a daily dose of ZEPATIER (50 mg elbasvir/100 mg
grazoprevir). Elbasvir and grazoprevir exposures in paediatric subjects were comparable to those
observed in adults.
In paediatric subjects 12 years of age and older, the geometric mean steady-state elbasvir AUC0-24 and
Cmax at 50 mg were 2,410 nM•hr and 190 nM, respectively, and the geometric mean steady-state
grazoprevir AUC0-24 and Cmax at 100 mg were 1,450 nM•hr and 246 nM, respectively.
Elderly
In population pharmacokinetic analyses, elbasvir and grazoprevir AUCs are estimated to be 16 % and
45 % higher, respectively, in subjects ≥ 65 years of age compared to subjects less than 65 years of age.
These changes are not clinically relevant; therefore, no dose adjustment of elbasvir/grazoprevir is
recommended based on age (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Gender
In population pharmacokinetic analyses, elbasvir and grazoprevir AUCs are estimated to be 50 % and
30 % higher, respectively, in females compared to males. These changes are not clinically relevant;
therefore, no dose adjustment of elbasvir/grazoprevir is recommended based on sex (see section 4.4).
Weight/BMI
In population pharmacokinetic analyses, there was no effect of weight on elbasvir pharmacokinetics.
Grazoprevir AUC is estimated to be 15 % higher in a 53 kg subject compared to a 77 kg subject. This
change is not clinically relevant for grazoprevir. Therefore, no dose adjustment of
elbasvir/grazoprevir is recommended based on weight/BMI (see section 4.4).
Race/Ethnicity
In population pharmacokinetic analyses, elbasvir and grazoprevir AUCs are estimated to be 15 % and
50 % higher, respectively, for Asians compared to Whites. Population pharmacokinetics estimates of
exposure of elbasvir and grazoprevir were comparable between Whites and Black/African Americans.
These changes are not clinically relevant; therefore, no dose adjustment of elbasvir/grazoprevir is
recommended based on race/ethnicity (see section 4.4).
5.3  Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction and development
with grazoprevir or elbasvir. Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures
33
considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to
clinical use. Carcinogenicity studies for grazoprevir and elbasvir have not been conducted.
Embryo fetal and post natal development
Elbasvir
Elbasvir was given to rats and rabbits without eliciting adverse effects on embryofetal or post natal
development at up to the highest doses tested (approximately 9- and 17-fold above human exposure in
rats and rabbits, respectively). Elbasvir has been shown to cross the placenta in rats and rabbits.
Elbasvir was excreted into the milk of lactating rats with concentrations 4-fold that of the maternal
plasma concentrations.
Grazoprevir
Grazoprevir was given to rats and rabbits without eliciting adverse effects on embryofetal or post natal
development at up to highest doses tested (approximately 79- and 39-fold above human exposure in
rats and rabbits, respectively). Grazoprevir has been shown to cross the placenta in rats and rabbits.
Grazoprevir was excreted into the milk of lactating rats with concentrations < 1-fold of the maternal
plasma concentrations.

Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What ZEPATIER is and what it is used for
What ZEPATIER is
ZEPATIER is an antiviral medicine that contains the active substances elbasvir and grazoprevir.
What ZEPATIER is used for
ZEPATIER is used to treat long-term hepatitis C infection in adults and children aged 12 years and
older who weigh at least 30 kilograms.
How ZEPATIER works
Hepatitis C is a virus that infects the liver. The active substances in the medicine work together by
blocking two different proteins that the hepatitis C virus needs to grow and reproduce. This allows the
infection to be permanently removed from the body. 
ZEPATIER is sometimes taken with another medicine, ribavirin.
It is very important that you also read the leaflets for the other medicines that you will be taking with
ZEPATIER. If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.
2.  What you need to know before you take ZEPATIER
Do not take ZEPATIER if:
you are allergic to elbasvir, grazoprevir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in
section 6)
you have certain moderate or severe liver problems
you are taking any of the following medicines:
o 
rifampicin, usually given for tuberculosis
o 
HIV protease inhibitors such as atazanavir, darunavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, or tipranavir
o 
efavirenz or etravirine for HIV
o 
elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or
elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide for HIV

bosentan for pulmonary arterial hypertension
carbamazepine or phenytoin, mainly used for epilepsy and seizures
modafinil to help people who cannot stay awake
St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal medicine) for depression or other
problems
If you are taking ZEPATIER with ribavirin, please make sure that you read the "Do not take" section
of the ribavirin package leaflet. If you are unsure of any information in the package leaflet, please
contact your doctor or pharmacist.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking ZEPATIER if you: 
have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor may want to
monitor you more closely
have ever taken any medicine for hepatitis C
have any liver problems other than hepatitis C
have had a liver transplant
have diabetes. You may need closer monitoring of your blood glucose levels and/or adjustment
of your diabetes medication after starting ZEPATIER. Some diabetic patients have experienced
low sugar levels in the blood (hypoglycaemia) after starting treatment with medicines like
ZEPATIER.
have any other medical conditions.
Blood tests 
Your doctor will test your blood before, during and after your treatment with ZEPATIER. This is so
your doctor can: 
decide if you should take ZEPATIER and for how long
decide what other medicines you should take with ZEPATIER and for how long
check for side effects 
check if your treatment has worked and you are free of hepatitis C
check how your liver is working - tell your doctor straight away if you have any of the
following signs of liver problems: loss of appetite; feeling or being sick; feeling tired or weak;
yellowing of your skin or eyes; colour changes in your stool. Your doctor may want to test your
blood to check how your liver is working if you develop any of these symptoms.
Children 
ZEPATIER is not for use in children younger than 12 years of age.
Other medicines and ZEPATIER
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines. This includes herbal medicines and medicines obtained without a prescription. Keep a list
of your medicines and show it to your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. 
There are some medicines you must not take with ZEPATIER. See list under “Do not take
ZEPATIER if you are taking any of the following medicines.”
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you take any of the following medicines:
oral ketoconazole for fungal infections
tacrolimus to prevent organ transplant rejection
dabigatran to prevent blood clots
rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin, or lovastatin, for lowering blood cholesterol
sunitinib to treat certain cancers

warfarin and other similar medicines called vitamin K antagonists used to thin the blood. Your
doctor may need to increase the frequency of your blood tests to check how well your blood can
clot.
Your liver function may improve with treatment of hepatitis C and therefore may affect other
medications that are handled by the liver. Your doctor may need to closely monitor these other
medicines you are taking and make adjustments during ZEPATIER therapy.
Your doctor may have to change your medicines or change the dose of your medicines.
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking
ZEPATIER.
Pregnancy and contraception
The effects of ZEPATIER in pregnancy are not known. If you are pregnant, think you might be
pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
ZEPATIER with ribavirin
You must not become pregnant if you are taking ZEPATIER with ribavirin. Ribavirin can be
very damaging to an unborn baby. This means you and your partner must take special
precautions in sexual activity if there is any chance you or your partner could become pregnant. 
You or your partner must use an effective method of contraception during treatment with
ZEPATIER with ribavirin and for some time afterwards. Talk to your doctor about different
contraception methods that are suitable for you. 
If you or your partner becomes pregnant while taking ZEPATIER with ribavirin or in the
months that follow, tell your doctor straight away. 
It is very important that you read the information concerning pregnancy and contraception in the
ribavirin package leaflet very carefully. It is important that both men and women read the
information.
Breast-feeding 
Talk to your doctor before taking ZEPATIER if you are breast-feeding. It is not known whether the
two medicines in ZEPATIER pass into human breast milk.
If you are taking ZEPATIER with ribavirin, make sure that you also read the Pregnancy and
Breast-feeding sections of the package leaflet for this other medicine.
Driving and using machines
Do not drive or operate machines if you feel tired after taking your medicine. 
ZEPATIER contains lactose 
ZEPATIER contains lactose monohydrate. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an
intolerance to some sugars, talk to your doctor before taking this medicine. 
ZEPATIER contains sodium 
This medicine contains 69.85 mg sodium (main component of cooking / table salt) in each tablet. This
is equivalent to 3.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.
3.  How to take ZEPATIER
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor
or pharmacist if you are not sure. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking ZEPATIER if you
have ever taken any medicines for hepatitis C or if you have any other medical condition.

How much to take
The recommended dose is one tablet once a day with or without food. Your doctor will tell you how
many weeks you should take ZEPATIER for. 
Swallow the tablet whole with or without food. Do not chew, crush or split the tablet. Tell your doctor
or pharmacist if you have problems swallowing tablets.
If you take more ZEPATIER than you should 
If you take more ZEPATIER than you should, talk to a doctor straight away. Take the medicine pack
with you so that you can show the doctor what you have taken. 
If you forget to take ZEPATIER
It is important not to miss a dose of this medicine. If you do miss a dose, work out how long it is since
you should have taken ZEPATIER: 
If it has been less than 16 hours since you should have taken your dose, take the missed dose as
soon as possible. Then take your next dose at your usual time. 
If it has been more than 16 hours since you should have taken your dose, do not take the missed
dose. Wait and take your next dose at your usual time. 
Do not take a double dose (two doses together) to make up for a forgotten dose. 
Do not stop taking ZEPATIER
Do not stop taking this medicine unless your doctor tells you to. It is very important that you complete
the full course of treatment. This will give the medicine the best chance to treat your hepatitis C
infection. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

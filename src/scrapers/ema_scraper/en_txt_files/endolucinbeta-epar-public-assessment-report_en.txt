2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Lutetium chemically belongs to one of two special groups of the Periodic Tables called Lanthanides. The other 
group – actinides - is more widely known as it contains the nuclear fuel elements uranium and plutonium. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404078/2016 
Page 7/58 
  
  
 
 
 
The Lanthanides series starts with lanthanum (La, Z = 57) and ends with Lutetium (Lu, Z = 71). All 
lanthanides commonly favour the (III) oxidation resulting in great similarity among these elements. Likewise, 
lutetium is not the only element from the series which is used for radiopharmaceutical purposes, but cerium 
(Ce), samarium (Sa), gadolinium(Gd), holmium (Ho) and ytterbium (Yb) likewise are currently under 
investigation for their suitability as radiopharmaceutical label. The lanthanides are often referred to as the 
rare earth elements with lutetium being the less abundant of these. 
Lutetium (177Lu) has no intrinsic pharmacodynamics properties. It is a medium-energy β-emitter with a 
maximum energy of 0.5 MeV and a maximum tissue penetration of 2 mm. The average beta energy is 
approximately 0.13 MeV. 177Lu also emits low-energy γ-rays at 208 keV (11%) and 113 keV (6.4%), allowing 
scintigraphy and subsequent dosimetry with the same therapeutic compound, if needed. The shorter β-range 
of 177Lu compared to other radiotherapeutic agents such as yttrium provides better irradiation of small 
tumours, sparing surrounding tissue (the range of yttrium is 12 mm in tissue, due to the higher energy of 
2.27 MeV). 177Lu decays to stable hafnium (177Hf) with a half-life of 6.647 days. The relatively long half-life of 
177Lu provides logistic advantages that facilitate its supply to locations far from reactors. 
EndolucinBeta contains 177Lu, a radioisotope of Lutetium, as lutetium(177Lu)chloride in solution. It contains 3-
150 GBq Lutetium (177Lu) chloride which corresponds to 0.73 – 37micrograms of Lutetium (177Lu).  The 
solution comes in a 2 ml and 10 ml vial where the volume 0.075 -3.75 ml. Lutetium (177Lu) chloride is 
produced by the irradiation of highly enriched Ytterbium (176Yb) in neutron sources with a thermal neutron 
flux between 1013 and 1016 cm-2s-1.   
Non carrier added (n.c.a.) Lutetium (177Lu) chloride is produced by the irradiation of highly enriched  
Ytterbium (176Yb) in neutron sources with a thermal neutron flux between 1013 and 1016 cm-2s-1. The following 
nuclear reaction is ongoing in the irradiation: 
176Yb(n, γ)177Yb → 177Lu 
The produced Ytterbium (177Yb) with a half-life of 1.9 h decays to Lutetium (177Lu). In a chromatographic 
process, the accumulated Lutetium (177Lu) is separated chemically from the original target material. 
Lutetium (177Lu) emits both medium-energy beta particles and imageable gamma photons, and has a 
half-life of 6.647 days. The primary radiation emissions of Lutetium (177Lu) are shown in Table 1.

The produced Ytterbium (177Yb) with a half-life of 1.9 h decays to Lutetium (177Lu). Lutetium (177Lu) decays 
by emission of beta radiation to stable Hafnium (177Hf). In a chromatographic process, the accumulated 
Lutetium (177Lu) is separated chemically from the original target material. 
EndolucinBeta is indicated for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules which have been specifically developed 
for radiolabelling with this radionuclide. As EndolucinBeta is a radiopharmaceutical precursor, it is not 
designed to be given directly to patients. This solution is to be used for the labelling of peptides or proteins 
which subsequently are administered to patients to facilitate diagnosis and therapy by its radiation 
properties.  The quantity of EndolucinBeta required for radiolabelling and the quantity of Lutetium (177Lu) -
labelled medicinal product that is subsequently administered will depend on the medicinal product 
radiolabelled and its intended use. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
• 
To be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, which have been specifically developed for 
radiolabelling with this radionuclide. Radiopharmaceutical precursor - Not intended for direct use in 
patients. 
The final agreed indication was as follows: 
• 
To be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, which have been specifically developed for 
radiolabelling with this radionuclide. Radiopharmaceutical precursor - Not intended for direct use in 
patients. 
EndolucinBeta is only to be used by specialists experienced with in vitro radiolabelling. 
The quantity of EndolucinBeta required for radiolabelling and the quantity of Lutetium (177Lu)- labelled 
medicinal product that is subsequently administered will depend on the medicinal product radiolabelled and 
its intended use. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal 
product to be radiolabelled. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
EndolucinBeta is not intended to be administered directly to the patients. It is used as radiopharmaceutical 
precursor and may be coupled to a variety of molecules, facilitating diagnosis and therapy by its radiation 
properties. 
The finished product is presented as radiopharmaceutical precursor, solution containing 40 GBq/ ml of 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride as active substance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404078/2016 
Page 9/58 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1 ml of solution contains 40 GBq Lutetium (177Lu) chloride on activity reference time (ART), corresponding to 
10 micrograms of Lutetium (177Lu) as chloride. 
Other ingredients are: hydrochloric acid solution.  
The product is available in type I glass vial, with a bromobutyl stopper, closed with an aluminium seal as 
described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance is Lutetium (177Lu) chloride corresponding to the molecular 
formula LuCl 3 and has a relative molecular mass 282.3 g/mol.   
Lutetium chloride (LuCl3) is a colourless/white crystal.  
The active substance 177Lu is a synthetic radionuclide produced in a nuclear reactor.  177Lu can be produced 
by two different routes:  
directly by neutron bombardment of cold 176Lu 
(i) 
indirectly by neutron bombardment of 176Yb to form 177Yb which decays to 177Lu;  
(ii) 
The 177Lu isotope is obtained by method (ii), the indirect method.  This indirect method has certain 
advantages such as avoiding production of the long-lived radionuclide impurity 177mLu.  The target 176Yb is 
more than 99% pure and purification steps can also be employed as starting materials 176Yb are chemically 
different from the desired product 177Lu.  Product produced by this method is of high purity with a high 
specific activity which has advantages in certain labelling and therapeutic applications. 
From a quality point of view, notwithstanding the different isotopic distributions of Lutetium and different 
Specific Activity (expressed as GBq/mg), non-carrier-added Lutetium (177Lu) Chloride and carrier-added 
Lutetium (177Lu) Chloride are clearly the same active substance. 
The active substance is not isolated during the manufacture and is dissolved in a solution of diluted 
hydrochloric acid. The general properties of the active substance therefore relate to the active substance 
lutetium (177Lu) chloride in diluted hydrochloric acid solution. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride is synthesized using commercially available well defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. The manufacturing process consists in the following steps: preparation of the 
manufacturing process, ampule manufacture and irradiation, target processing, radiochemical separation, 
formulation of the stock solution, sampling for quality testing. 
Lutetium (177Lu) is produced by the irradiation of highly enriched Ytterbium (176Yb) in neutron sources with a 
thermal neutron flux. The following nuclear reaction is takes place during irradiation:  
176Yb (n, γ)177Yb → 177Lu 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404078/2016 
Page 10/58 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The produced Ytterbium (177Yb) with a half-life of 1.9 h decays to Lutetium (177Lu). In a chromatographic 
process, the accumulated Lutetium (177Lu) is separated chemically from the original target material and is 
dissolved in 0.04 M HCl.  
The active substance lutetium (177Lu) chloride is not isolated during the manufacturing process; it is dissolved 
in diluted hydrochloric acid (0.04 M HCl).  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. 
A type I glass vial internally coated with a chemically bonded layer of SiO2 is used as container closure for 
the stock solution. The vial remains all the time until dispensing of the stock solution in the hot cell. 
Certificates of analysis are provided confirming compliance with Type I Glass requirements as stated in the Ph 
Eur 3.2.1. 
Specification 
The active substance release specification includes tests for radioactivity concentration, appearance, identity 
(Gamma spectrometry), identity chloride (Ph Eur), pH, specific activity (ICP-MS),chemical purity (ICP-MS),  
radionuclidic purity (gamma spectroscopy), radiochemical purity (TLC), bacterial endotoxins (Ph Eur) and 
total organ carbon (TOC measurement). 
The description of analytical procedures and validation of analytical procedures are described under the   
Finish product section. Moreover, the reference standards are those described for the finished product for the 
same reason.   
Batch analysis data on three production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three production scale batches of active substance (i.e. stock solution) from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package at room temperature for at least 11 days from the 
day of manufacturing. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, activity concentration (dose calibrator), identity 177Lu 
(gamma spectrometry), identity chloride (Ph Eur), pH, chemical purity (ICP-MS), radiochemical purity (TLC), 
radiolabelling yield (TLC) and total organ carbon (TOC). Test methods correspond to those described for the 
finished product.  
After storage of the stock solution at room temperature for at least 11 days from the day of manufacturing all 
parameters tested comply with the specifications. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404078/2016 
Page 11/58 
  
  
 
 
 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier(s) is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of up to 2 days with an expiry of 4 
days from the date of manufacturing of the stock solution in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The composition of the finished product consists in Lutetium (177Lu) as lutetium chloride as active substance 
in a solution of hydrochloric acid.  
The stock solution is filled in 2 ml or 10 ml vials (and may be diluted by 0.04 M HCl) to obtain a defined 
activity concentration of 40 GBq/ml at ART. 
The aim of pharmaceutical development was to produce a sterile finished product with a low content of 
metallic impurities, to ensure appropriate quality and the intended performance of the product to deliver the 
intended radiolabelling capacity.  
A solution of 177Lu in 0.04M HCl was chosen for the following reasons:  
-  0.04 M HCl allows to maintain the pH of the finished product at maximum of 2 as requested by the 
draft monograph of the Ph. Eur. “Lutetium (177Lu) solution for radiolabelling”.  
- 
- 
The  concentration  of  0.04  M  HCl  is  suitable  to  keep  the  177Lu  in  solution,  which  is  necessary  for 
labelling of the carrier molecules.  
The pH of this solution is suitable to perform radiolabelling reactions by adding only minimal amounts 
of buffer solution.  
The active substance Lutetium (177Lu) is dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid; thus it is in the chemical form 
of Lutetium (177Lu) chloride.  A classic compatibility study is not applicable in this case. The active substance 
is an inorganic substance that is not susceptible to degradation caused by interaction with excipients. As a 
radioactive element, the active substance is characterised by its physical half-life (6.647 days). Other 
instabilities are not expected. 
An important parameter for the quality of the radiopharmaceutical precursor solution is the radiolabelling 
yield. To achieve a high yield of the subsequent labelling reactions even traces of metals should be avoided 
when choosing the excipients. Therefore, only excipients and reagents of high purity are used. 
Manufacture is a continuous process from starting material through to manufacture of the finished product. 
The product is sterilised by terminal sterilisation according to an accelerated cycle The finished product is 
sterilised by autoclaving and tested for sterility according to Ph. Eur. 2.6.1. Bacterial endotoxins are tested 
according to Ph. Eur. 2.6.14. Testing of sterility is performed retrospectively after the complete decay of 
radioactivity.  The conditions of the solution, acidic pH (1 - 2) and gamma radiation are not favourable for the 
growth of microorganisms. 
The product is available in type I glass vial, with a bromobutyl stopper, closed with an aluminium seal. 
Integrity of the stoppered and crimped vials was demonstrated by the dye ingress (methylene blue) method. 
All vials tested were shown to meet the acceptance criteria, whether automatically or manually crimped.

Fragmentation tests, in line with Ph. Eur. 3.2.9, were conducted to ensure that piercing of the rubber stopper 
with a subcutaneous needle does not damage the stopper; results complied with the Ph. Eur. Limit. A 
leaching study was conducted to observe levels of trace elemental impurities in the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The active ingredient lutetium (177Lu) chloride is not isolated during the manufacturing process; it is solved in 
diluted hydrochloric acid (0.04 M HCl).  The manufacturing of finished product comprises the following main 
steps: filling, autoclaving, and secondary packaging. The process is considered to be a non-standard 
manufacturing process. 
Three  batches  have  been  manufactured  in  compliance  with  the  process  controls  during  validation  and  the 
finished  product  specifications,  demonstrating  the  consistency  and  robustness  of  the  manufacturing 
procedure. It can then be concluded that the manufacturing process of EndolucinBeta described is validated. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: activity per 
vial (dose calibrator), radioactivity concentration, appearance, identity 177Lu (gamma spectrometry), identity 
chloride  (Ph  Eur),  pH,  specific  activity  (ICP-MS),  chemical  purity  (ICP-MS),  radionuclidic  purity  (gamma 
spectrometry), radiochemical purity (TLC), bacterial endotoxins (Ph Eur) and sterility (Ph Eur). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three commercial scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions at 25 
ºC  /  60%  RH  and  under  accelerated  conditions  at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH  for  up  to  11  days  according  to  the  ICH 
guidelines were provided. The batches are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Photostability is not tested because the product is packed in a lead container (secondary packing) and is not 
exposed to light. 
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  identity  177Lu  (gamma  spectrometry),  identity  chloride  (Ph  Eur),  pH, 
chemical  purity  (ICP-MS),  radionuclidic  purity  (gamma  spectrometry),  radiochemical  purity  (TLC),  bacterial 
endotoxins (Ph Eur), sterility (Ph Eur) and total organ carbon (TOC). 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
As would be expected with a product of this nature, very little change is observed on stability testing, aside 
from the obvious decay of radioactivity. The key parameters of radionuclidic and radiochemical purity remain 
essentially  unchanged  and  all  parameters  are  within  the  proposed  specifications.  The  tests  for  sterility  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404078/2016 
Page 13/58 
  
  
 
 
 
 
radionuclidic  purity  have  been  accomplished  retrospectively  after  the  complete  decay  (about  12  weeks)  of 
radioactivity. The results for these parameters are also within the predefined limits. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of up to 9 days from date of manufacturing as stated 
in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. The time of manufacture of the finished product shall mean the day 
of filling. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The element lutetium does not appear to have a natural physiological function and it is found only in traces in 
the body. The content in food is not monitored, but was found to be extremely low; some vegetables were 
found to have as little as 10 ppt in dry matter. From this it can be extrapolated that the natural uptake may 
be as low as a few micrograms per year1 . Lutetium can be administered orally at high doses without 
inducing any signs of overt toxicity (single dose toxicity). Like other metal ions, lutetium ions do have a 
bacteriotoxic potential. With an effective concentration (EC50) of 1.57 μM, Lu3+ is more bacteriotoxic than 
La3+, Cd2+, or Zn2+ and approximately equally as bacteriotoxic as Cu2+2. 
177Lu as a free (non-complexed) radioisotope 
First reports on the medical use of 177Lu were published in 1969, describing the use of this radioactive 
element for bone imaging in rabbits3 . Whereas 177Lu is currently used as an immunotherapeutic due to the 
emission of β-radiation with a range of only 2 mm compared to the range of 12 mm described for 90Y, 177Lu 
also emits γ-irradiation, enabling its use for radio-imaging purposes4 . 177Lu was discussed to be 
advantageous for bone imaging, due to the medium energy gamma radiation emitted and the half-life of 
more than six days, giving a balance between practical considerations for handling and duration of radiation 
exposure . Depending on the chelating agent used for administration, the radioactivity is distributed in 
different tissues. If highly stable complexes such as diethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) are selected 
for administration, the radioactivity is excreted in urine prior to distribution in bone or other tissues. When 
complexes of low stability are formed, "radiocolloid" formation apparently takes place in vivo, and 
reticuloendothelial localisation is the result. However, if hydroxyethylenediamine tetracetic acid is used for 
complexing, forming a complex of intermediate stability, approximately 50% of the administered dose 
localises in the skeleton. The remainder is promptly cleared from the plasma by the kidneys, and the rate of 
clearance was found to be similar to that of 85Sr, a radionuclide used previously. Despite these encouraging 
data, no further uses were described until 1985, when Bard et al.5  described the use of 177Lu in the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in an experimental model in rabbits. The use of 177Lu was tried to limit the 
proliferative response of the synovia to inflammation and to locally reduce/block the immune response in the 
joint, preventing the inflammation induced destruction of cartilage. Although some joints, which had received 
0.35 mCi, showed signs of damage to the articular cartilage, this damage was not apparent with either of the 
two lower doses, indicating that a separation between pharmacological activity and toxicity is possible. 
In a different study, it was evaluated whether 177Lu could be utilised to image the parathyroid gland, aiming 
at localising potential parathyroid adenoma in a pre-surgical setting. Although certain enrichment in 
parathyroid tissue could be observed, the enrichment was not sufficient for imaging for lutetium. 
177Lu radioimmunotherapy 
To evaluate the stability of chelated complexes, i.e. molecules which complex 177Lu3+ presented in an 
aqueous solution, an in vitro method was developed and several complexing agents were compared. 177Lu 
was found to form stable complexes with DOTA and with DOTA-based complexing agents such as 1, 4, 7, 10-
tetraaza-N-(1-carboxy-3-(4-nitrophenyl)propyl)-N', N", N"'-tris(acetic acid) cyclododecane (PA-DOTA). These 
chelators molecules could be rapidly filled with 177Lu in vitro, resulting in stable complexes with high (>98%) 
rates of labelling6,7,8. The complex with DOTA was found to be highly stable and mostly irreversible, with 
release of less than 5% of the label within 21 days of incubation in vitro9.

Pharmacology of 177Hf as a decay product from 177Lu 
177Lu decays by β-emission of intermediate energy, accompanied by γ-emission of intermediate energy, to 
the stable isotope 177Hf with a half-life of 6.647 days. Therefore, each individual exposed to 177Lu is also 
exposed to 177Hf. Whereas the highest cumulative dose of lutetium to be administered in patients depends on 
the intended application and on the carrier protein used, cumulative doses of up to 29.6 GBq 177Lu (7.2 μg) 
are reported. Assuming a worst case scenario in which no 177Lu is excreted before decay, the cumulative 
exposure would be up to 7.2 μg hafnium. Therefore the pharmacology of 177Hf was also evaluated. 
Hafnium, being a stable isotope, is present in nature and can be taken up by each individual in food, drinking 
water or as dust inhaled. The amount of Hf present in the human body is not known, but is negligible. It has 
no known biological role, and its salts generally have low toxicity. The element is poorly absorbed by the 
body, and poisoning by Hf compounds is not known. Plants take up small amounts of Hf from the soil in 
which they grow, and levels of 0.01-0.4 ppm (dry weight) have been recorded. No daily intake can be 
calculated from these data, but it is likely to be very low. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Lutetium in its ionic form (Lu3+) has been investigated as a membrane stabilising agent, inhibiting 
transmembrane calcium permeation. Using a rat aorta preparation in vitro, lutetium and other rare earth 
metals were investigated for their effects on calcium distribution and transmembrane calcium movements, 
using the radioactive isotope 45Ca. In addition, the effects of lutetium on aortic smooth muscle contractions 
were examined, since calcium entry is essential for contractions. At a concentration of 1.5 mM in the bath 
solution, Lu3+ reduced the calcium uptake in the preparation and had a relaxant property, interpreted as 
membrane stabilisation10. Ionic lutetium was also shown to interfere with inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA) neurotransmission, resulting in enhancement of GABA currents. The effect of Lu3+ was investigated in 
rat septal neurons in culture by using the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. GABA (10 μM) currents were 
moderately enhanced by about 40% upon application of a concentration of 100 μM Lu3+ 11. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology of lutetium in its ionic form was evaluated using the isolated rabbit ileum, in 
anaesthetised cats and in non-anaesthetised rats. 
In the isolated rabbit ileum preparation, lutetium chloride produced a concentration dependent relaxant 
effect, and at high concentrations (up to 40 mg) an irreversible paralysis was observed. The exact 
concentration in the bath solution is not given, since the reference volume is not given (most likely 40 
mg/100 ml). If the rabbit ileum was pre-contracted with acetylcholine or nicotine, the contraction of these 
agents was antagonised with an antispasmodic EC50 of 0.6 and 0.5 mg/ml. In a different preparation, the cat 
superior ganglion preparation, lutetium had no ganglion blocking effect, indicating that the smooth muscle 
relaxant effect was due to a direct interaction with the muscle, in line with the reported calcium blocking 
activity of high concentrations of lutetium,12. 
Cardiovascular effects of intravenously administered lutetium chloride were investigated in the anaesthetised 
cat. No pharmacological effects on respiration or on the cardiovascular system were observed in the dose 
range 1 to 10 mg/kg lutetium chloride, upon cumulative dosing. The administration of 20 mg/kg was in the 
lethal dose range, resulting in lethality in 5 out of 10 cats. In animals which did not die upon administration 
of 20 mg/kg, a transient hypotension with concomitant reduction in blood flow was observed. Respiration was

not affected. In animals which died at this dose or at the highest tested dose of 40 mg/kg, a complete 
cardiovascular collapse, coupled with respiratory paralysis, was observed, leading to death. While no effect 
on ECG parameters were observed up to the dose of 10 mg/kg i.v., in animals dosed 20 mg/kg and above, 
pre-lethal changes included inversion of QRS complex, transient ventricular fibrillations, heart block, and 
changes in the T-wave morphology. However, even at this dose no QT-prolongation was reported. Within the 
dose range tested, lutetium chloride had no influence on the pharmacological response to acetylcholine, 
histamine, or electrical vagal stimulation. Neither atropine nor epinephrine had positive effects on the 
cardiovascular collapse induced in the lethal dose range of 20-40 mg/kg. 
In a different experiment, lutetium chloride (10 mg/kg) was administered intravenously in non-anaesthetised 
rats, and the safety of this single dose administration was observed, with focus on hepatic metabolism. 
Lutetium administration had no effect on calcium accumulation at the dose level of 10 mg/kg i.v., but it 
resulted in increased concentration of calcium in various organs (liver, spleen, lungs and kidneys) at 20 
mg/kg i.v., a dose which was found to be in the lethal dose range in cats. Lutetium (10 mg/kg) had no effect 
on hepatic metabolism, as indicated by a lack of change in hepatic cholesterol, triglycerides and 
phospholipids, serum lipids, and serum hepatic enzyme activity of aspartate transaminase (GOT or AST) and 
alanine transaminase (GPT or ALT)13. 
Hafnium 
The safety pharmacology of hafnium chloride in its ionic form was evaluated using the guinea pig isolated 
ileum and in anaesthetised cats. 
In the isolated guinea pig ileum preparation, hafnium chloride produced a concentration dependent relaxant 
effect, and at high concentrations (range tested: 10 to 200 mg, reference volume not given, most likely 10-
200 mg/100 ml) an irreversible paralysis was obtained. If the rabbit ileum was pre-contracted with 
acetylcholine or nicotine, the contraction of these agents was antagonised with an antispasmodic EC50 of 128 
and 99 mg (again, reference volume not given). In a different preparation, the cat superior ganglion 
preparation, hafnium had no ganglion blocking effect, indicating that the smooth muscle relaxant effect was 
due to a direct interaction with the muscle 14. 
The cardiovascular effect of intravenously administered hafnium chloride was investigated in the 
anaesthetised cat. No pharmacological effects on respiration or the cardiovascular system were observed in 
the dose range 0.5 to 2 mg/kg, upon cumulative dosing. The administration of 5 mg/kg resulted in a 
transient hypotension with a concomitant reduction in blood flow. In these animals, respiration was not 
affected. At this dose, ECG changes were observed including changes in the height and direction of P- and T-
wave, but no effect on the QT interval was reported. The administration of 10 mg/kg resulted in complete 
cardiovascular collapse, followed by respiratory paralysis. Prior to death, the respiratory rate was not 
affected. Within the dose range tested, hafnium chloride had no influence on the pharmacological response to 
acetylcholine, histamine, or electrical vagal stimulation. Neither atropine nor epinephrine had positive effects 
on the cardiovascular collapse induced at the lethal dose of 10 mg/kg.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies LuCl3 has been submitted by the applicant (see non-clinical 
discussion). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic of 177Lu is dependent on the carrier molecule radiolabelled with the isotope.  In an effort 
to examine the dosimetry of 177LuCl 3 in case of accidental intravenous administration, a distribution study 
was carried out in rats.   
The pharmacokinetic parameters and organ distribution of 177Lu after intravenous injection of 15 MBq/kg 
177LuCl 3 in PBS were investigated in male and female rats [Study report ITG-Lu-177-Dosimetry-001]. Each 
animal (n=24, two male and two female per sampling time) received 15 MBq/kg and the blood 177Lu 
concentration was determined at 5 min, 1 h, 12 h, 2 days, 7 days and 28 days after tracer injection.  
Maximum blood concentrations were observed after 5 min (the first sampling time) and were very low, 
reaching 0.08%ID/g in male and female rats, without gender difference. Based on the assumption that the 
blood amounts to 7% of body weight, only 1.52% injected dose was found in blood at this sampling time. 
Already after one hour, no radioactivity above background activity was found in blood, indicating that 177Lu 
was rapidly cleared from the blood pool, immediately after administration. No terminal half-life could be 
calculated, but can be expected to be in the range of a few minutes only. 
The distribution of 177Lu in the evaluated organs, corrected for the decay of radioactivity, is displayed in 
Table 5 below.

The highest amount of 177Lu radioactivity was detected in the liver and spleen, followed by the lung shortly 
after administration, and by bone later on, but with a much lower content. The content in the kidneys 
remained low throughout the study.  
After one hour the activity was: 9.56%ID/g in the liver and 5.26%ID/g in the spleen, whereas the activity in 
the lungs as the third most exposed organ reached only 0.22%ID/g and bone and kidney were only exposed 
to 0.04%ID/g.  
After seven days the remaining activity, corrected for the decay of 177Lu, was: 4.59%ID/g in the liver, and 
6.50%ID/g in the spleen, the maximum concentration reached in the spleen. The content in bone had 
increased to 0.84%ID/g, whereas no activity remained in any of the other organs, except for the jejunum 
(0.59%ID/g), kidneys (0.35%ID/g), stomach (0.09%ID/g), lung (0.03%ID/g) and heart (0.01%ID/g). This 
indicates that the bone accumulates lutetium released from other organs.  
After 28 days (the last sampling time) the remaining activity, corrected for the decay of 177Lu, was: 
0.88%ID/g in the liver, and 2.77%ID/g in the spleen. The content in bone had increased to 1.02%ID/g, with 
practically no activity remaining in any of the other organs, indicating that the bone still accumulated

lutetium released from other organs. Considering that after 28 days, 177Lu has already decayed by 4.2 half-
lives, the actual remaining activity in the bone at this time is only 0.06%ID/g. 
No apparent gender difference could be observed for the distribution of 177Lu in this study. 
The absorption from the injection site was found to be fairly complete within 24 hours. After 24 hours, less 
than 20% of radioactivity had been excreted in urine and faeces, and only 2-3% were found in the liver, 
whereas about 80% were found in the skeleton, with little radioactivity in the remaining body. Exact figures 
were not given for different organs, but the authors describe that there was no enrichment in blood, and only 
limited retention in muscle and skin. Initially the content in the gastrointestinal tract was about 10 times as 
high as in blood or muscle, but decreased thereafter. The kidney was found to be an organ of accumulation 
for the heavier lanthanoids including lutetium, and the urinary route was found to be the primary route of 
excretion for these lanthanoids. The liver was found to be only a secondary organ of storage for the heavier 
lanthanoids, whereas the skeleton was found to be the primary organ or storage, with slow clearance from 
bone (again, no detailed data were given for lutetium).  
A published intravenous (i.v.) biodistribution study in rats with “cold” Lutetium chloride and other chlorides of 
rare earth elements (REEs - yttrium, cerium, praseodymium, europium, dysprosium, ytterbium) indicated 
that REEs in general are rapidly cleared from blood but are retained in the organs for a prolonged period of 
time. The rats received a low dose (9-10 mg/kg) or a high dose (18-20 mg/kg) of REE. At 1 day after i.v. 
administration, more than 78% of the REEs injected were distributed into liver, bone and spleen. Specifically, 
the major organs in which Lutetium accumulated (at 10 and 20 mg/kg) were the liver (64-67%), bone (11-
15%) and spleen (5%). Only minor Lutetium amounts (< 2%) were detected in lungs and kidneys,15.  
Following intravenous dosing, the distribution of 177LuCl 3 in rabbits, complexed in hydroxyethylenediamine 
tetracetic acid (HEDTA), was described by O’Mara et al. In this study, the utility of the lutetium isotope for 
bone imaging was evaluated. According to the publication, HEDTA was selected as the complexing agent, 
which forms complexes of intermediate stability, preventing the formation of "radiocolloids".  
Using this complex, approximately 50% of the administered dose localised in the skeleton. The remainder 
was promptly cleared from the plasma by the kidneys, and the rate of clearance was similar to that of the 
well-known bone imaging radionuclide strontium-85. In fact, about 50% of administered dose was found to 
be localised in the skeleton within one hour of administration, with little change after three and 24 hours, 
indicating stable distribution to bone (see Table 2). In contrast, little content was found in the marrow and 
liver or in the skeleton, and this amount decreased over time, indicating clearance from the tissue and no 
further accumulation. For the determination of tissue distribution in rabbits, the amount of radioactivity in 
whole organ was related to the fractional weight of the respective organ relative to the body weight. For this 
calculation, it was assumed that 10% of the whole body weight accounts for skeleton, 42% for muscle, and 
4% for bone marrow.

Similar distribution data were also reported for lutetium oxide, administered intraperitoneally to mice after 
solubilisation in KHSO4 16 .  About 50% of radioactivity was found in the skeleton, with little clearance over 
time. From other organs evaluated, the liver revealed to be the organ with highest exposure, followed by the 
kidney, spleen, and, with low exposure, the lung. 
After intravenous injection of Lu-chloride, lutetium is predominantly but slowly excreted in the urine3. 
According to Durbin et al. 17, faecal excretion is also observed. The authors found that about 20% of the 
administered radioactivity following intramuscular administration was excreted within 24 hours. Following 
intravenous administration of 177LuCl3 at a dose of 15 MBq/kg in PBS in male and female rats [ITG-Lu-177-
Dosimetry-001], slow clearance of radioactivity from the whole body could be observed. Disregarding the 
radioactive decay of 177Lu to calculate the clearance of the administered dose by excretion only (i.e. 
assuming that no radioactive decay took place), it was shown that after 28 days an average of 30.3% of the 
injected dose remained in the body, with 17.8%ID in bone, 10.5%ID in liver and 1.8%ID in spleen, indicating 
that about 70% was cleared. Considering that after 28 days more than four half-lives of 177Lu have passed, 
resulting in a decay of more than 94% of the administered radioactivity, the remaining radioactivity in the 
body is about 1.8% of the administered dose. Part of the 177Lu administered i.v. is taken up in bone, and no 
clearance other than radioactive decay from bone was observed. After 28 days, 17.8%ID (as 177Lu or 177Hf) is 
found in bone.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Lutetium: single dose toxicity 
The single dose toxicity of lutetium chloride in mice, administered intraperitoneally or orally, was reported by 
Haley et al. 1964. The symptoms of acute (intraperitoneal) toxicity were writhing, ataxia, laboured 
respiration, walking on toes with back arched, and sedation. The first deaths occurred within 24 hours, and 
the peak was at 48 hours. The intraperitoneal LD50 of lutetium chloride was 315 (267-372) mg/kg, 
corresponding to 197 mg lutetium/kg. The oral LD50 in mice was 7100 (6633-7590) mg/kg, corresponding to 
4435 mg lutetium/kg. The subcutaneous administration of 10 mg/mouse of LuCl3 did not result in lethality, 
but at the injection site local calcification could be observed. From these data a subcutaneous LD50 of > 312 
mg/kg lutetium can be derived18. In a different study, the intraperitoneal LD50 of lutetium nitrate was 
evaluated in female mice and rats. The animals were dosed intraperitoneally and were observed for 30 days 
following the administration. In mice, an LD50 of the nitrate salt of 290 (259-325) mg/kg, corresponding to a 
dose of the metal of 108 (97-121) mg/kg, was determined. It is to be noted that in this study some animals 
died late, i.e. more than seven days following dosing. In rats, an intraperitoneal LD50 of 335 mg/kg, 
corresponding to a dose of the metal of 125 (110-142) mg/kg, was determined19. 
Single dose toxicity information following intravenous administration can be derived from safety 
pharmacology studies conducted in anaesthetised cats (see non-clinical safety pharmacology). From these 
data, the intravenous LD50 can be deferred as 20 mg/kg in anaesthetised cats, corresponding to a dose of 
12.5 mg/kg lutetium.

The incidence of osteosarcoma after the injection a dose of unconjugated EndolucinBeta in mice was 
evaluated in a study by Müller et al.20,21, mice were administered carrier added solutions of 177Lu.  Although 
the solution and the route of administration differ from EndolucinBeta, Müller et al. found for a 185 MBq/kg 
dose a total skeletal dose of 28 Gy, was associated with a 12.5% incidence of osteosarcomas.  Although the 
data are not quite clear on the relationship between total dose and incidence of sarcoma, it can be stated 
that the probability of osteosarcoma development after an extremely unlikely administration of 7.5 GBq of 
non-conjugated 177Lu would be well below 12.5%. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Lutetium: repeat dose toxicity (90 days) 
The repeat dose oral toxicity of LuCl3 was evaluated in CRW rats. Animals were fed a diet containing 0.01, 
0.1 or 1% LuCl 3 for a period of 90 days. Based on a daily food consumption of 100 g/kg body weight, this 
resulted in a maximum daily exposure of 625 mg lutetium/kg body weight. Animals were monitored 
throughout the study for signs of toxicity including haematology and at the end of the study the animals were 
dissected. Apart from macroscopic pathology, a limited number of core organs, i.e. heart, lung, liver, kidney, 
spleen, pancreas, adrenals and small intestine, were evaluated histologically. The feeding of LuCl 3 had no 
influence on behaviour, growth rate, haematology, and gross pathology. No signs of toxicity were seen 
evaluating the histology of the selected organs. Therefore, the NOEL of orally administered lutetium chloride 
was set at 1% in the diet, corresponding to about 1000 mg lutetium chloride/kg body weight or 625 mg 
lutetium/kg body weight. 
Genotoxicity 
The applicant did not submit genotoxicity studies. According to Annex 1 Part III of Dir 2001/83/EC, as 
amended, in the specific case of a radiopharmaceutical precursor intended solely for radiolabelling purposes, 
mutagenicity studies on the radionuclide are not considered to be necessary. 
Carcinogenicity 
Radiopharmaceuticals including 177Lu have an inherent carcinogenic potential, derived from the ionising 
radiation emitted during radioactive decay. The effect of 177Lu retained in the skeleton was studied. In 
animals examined 12 months after an exposure to an estimated dose of 2000 to 8000 rd (20 to 80 Gy), an 
increased rate of osteosarcoma formation was observed. The increased rate of osteosarcoma formation was 
comparable to the effect of the radiation from exposure to strontium-90.  
Subcutaneously administered lutetium resulted in formation of local calcification at the injection site within 
one week after the administration, but it was not evaluated whether this local irritant effect induced cell 
transformation19. The local effect of hafnium oxychloride, administered at a concentration of 3 mM (about 20 
µg/mouse administered locally), was evaluated in mice. Local intradermal injection resulted in the formation 
of dysplastic cartilage at the site of injection, as could be observed five months after administration. The 
effect was comparable to the local activity of zirconium chloride, whereas other metal salts with known 
carcinogen potential including beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, and nickel, did not induce this local 
reaction22.

Reproduction Toxicity 
In repeat dose toxicity studies, no toxic effects on reproductive organs were observed following oral dosing of 
lutetium  chloride  or  hafnium  chloride  as  a  food  admix  for  90  days.  The  NOEL  for  lutetium  was  found  to  be 
625 mg/kg body weight for lutetium and 55.5 mg/kg body weight for hafnium. 
The applicant did not submit further data on the chemical toxicity of lutetium or hafnium on the reproductive 
function, and on the teratogenic potential of either compound (see non-clinical discussion).  
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance of lutetium chloride 
Data on the local tolerance of free lutetium from administration of LuCl3 are described by Haley et al. (1964). 
The administration of concentrated lutetium chloride (1:1 solution) to eyes resulted in local irritation and 
delayed ulceration of the cornea, which healed completely within two weeks. If crystalline lutetium chloride 
(0.5 g) was applied to intact skin, no irritation was caused. In contrast, if the crystalline compound was 
brought in contact with abraded skin, the reaction was severe, showing strong irritation peaking at 24 hours. 
The irritated skin healed only after 35 days with formation of scar tissue. The intradermal administration 
resulted in a concentration dependent local irritation or necrosis, and at the lowest concentration tested 
(1:104 and 1:105 dilution in water), a moderate local irritation was induced. Healing occurred with formation 
of nodules within six weeks after administration. Histopathological evaluation of these nodules revealed the 
presence of crystalline deposits of unknown composition. Foreign body giant cells surrounded the crystals, 
and fibroblasts were found in the outer area.  
Other toxicity studies 
The solution of 177LuCl 3 in 0.04 M hydrochloric acid solution is acidic at a pH of 1-2. With paravenous 
injection or infusion into small or collapsed large veins, tissue damage and necrosis can occur, which may be 
irreversible23 . In case of accidental administration of Lutetium (177Lu) chloride n.c.a. ITG to the patient, the 
catheter or affected area should be irrigated with isotonic saline solution. 
Studies on impurities 
Carrier free 177Lu chloride is produced by the irradiation of highly enriched (> 99%) ytterbium (176Yb) in 
neutron sources with a thermal neutron flux between 1013 and 1016 cm-2s1, resulting in the generation of 
177Ytterbium, which declines rapidly with a half-life of 1.9 h to 177Lu. The chromatographic process to 
separate ytterbium from 177Lu utilises alpha-hydroxy-isobutyric acid (HIBA, CAS no. 594-61-6) in small 
amounts, and hence HIBA is a known impurity of 177LuCl 3. HIBA can be classified as a residual solvent in the 
drug substance and drug product. 
Based on a thorough evaluation of HIBA exposure and in line with current guidelines, the HIBA exposure of 
patients undergoing treatment with lutetium containing radiopharmaceuticals is well below the qualification 
thresholds of current guidelines. From a toxicological point of view, the product specification of 100 µg/ml 
total carbon, corresponding to a maximum content of 216.9 µg HIBA per ml stock solution, is acceptable for 
177LuCl 3 drug substance. HIBA does not require further toxicological qualification. 
The only other ingredient is diluted hydrochloric acid. This excipient conforms to the requirements for 
pharmaceutical excipients.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
EndolucinBeta contains no-carrier-added preparation of (177Lu) chloride which exhibits very high radionuclidic 
purity.  No detectable tracers of long-lived 177mLu (t 1/2= 160.44 days) are present in the preparation.  As 
specified in the SmPC, radiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised 
persons in designated clinical settings.  Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the 
regulations and/or appropriate licences of the competent official organisation.  Storage of 
radiopharmaceuticals should be in accordance with national regulation on radioactive materials and any 
unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.  An 
environmental risk from any unused EndolucinBeta can be excluded. 
With regard to products excreted by the patient, the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of 
medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) states that environmental risk assessment 
studies are not required for vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids, 
because they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. Lutetium (177Lu) chloride 
dissociates to elemental 177Lu and chloride when in Solution, and is therefore an electrolyte.  In addition, 
177Lu has no pharmacological action and decays to stable 177Hf, which is also without any pharmacological 
effect.  This decay takes place with a half-life of 6.647 days, meaning that after 33 days (five half-lives) only 
3% of radioactive 177Lu remain.  It is assumed that 177Lu will be in the body for most of its radioactive 'life-
time', and not in the environment. 
Screening for PBT (persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity) is required for substances with a logKow > 4.5. 
However, since lutetium trichloride, is an inorganic salt its logKow will by all means be negative. Therefore no 
screening for PBT will be necessary. 
Therefore, no environmental risk is to be expected from the use of EndolucinBeta.    
2.3.6.  New active substance 
The applicant was asked to provide further justification for the claim of the new active substance. The 
applicant justified based on the qualitative and quantitative composition of EndolucinBeta where the non-
carrier added EndolucinBeta has at production a specific activity of > 3500 GBq/mg, and at the end of shelf-
life, 9 days after production, the specific activity is still > 3000 GBq/mg, whereas for the carrier added 
Lumark a specific activity of 500 GBq/mg at production is reported. Hence, in EndolucinBeta virtually all 
lutetium is 177Lu, whereas in Lumark only approximately 12.5 % of all lutetium is 177Lu, the remaining 87.5 % 
representing other isotopes. In addition, 0.05 % of the radioactivity in Lumark may originate from the long-
lived isotope 177mLu (half-life 160.1 days). Given these differences, the ultimate specific activity of a ligand 
labelled with EndolucinBeta can be expected to be up to 8 times higher than when labelling with carrier 
added Lutetium (177Lu) chloride solutions. The applicant has submitted literature which supported the claim 
that this difference in specific activity might lead to improved clinical peptide receptor radiotherapy response 
and an improved efficacy in certain tumour models and consequently, for the treatment of several human 
tumours.

2.3.7.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A limited non-clinical program which consists of a non-GLP pharmacokinetic study to examine the distribution 
of 177Lu in rats has been submitted.  The remaining sections of the non-clinical dossier have been compiled 
from published literature consisting of information on lutetium trichloride and other lanthanides. Overall, it 
can be agreed that the primary pharmacodynamic function of 177Lu is to provide stable labelling for localised 
radioimmunotherapy and diagnosis which will be dependent on the specificity of the carrier molecule.  The 
isotope itself, at the concentration present in EndolucinBeta, is not expected to have any intrinsic 
pharmacological properties/response.  Hence, the pharmacodynamic properties of 177Lu-labelled medicinal 
products prepared by radiolabelling with 177Lu chloride n.c.a. prior to administration will be dependent on the 
type of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. As a result, the need for dedicated pharmacodynamic 
studies is not considered necessary. 
The secondary pharmacodynamics of ionic lutetium are limited to effects on transmembrane calcium 
permeation and hence smooth muscle contractions.  These effects were demonstrated in vitro in rat aorta 
preparations at concentrations (1.5 mM) far above those used in EndolucinBeta.  Ionic lutetium was also 
shown to interfere with inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission, resulting in enhancement 
of GABA currents. Again, the concentration found to be active was 100 μM, i.e. well in excess of that achieve 
with EndolucinBeta. Based on current knowledge, one would rather conclude that Lu3+ had a moderate 
blocking effect on calcium channels. However, the concentrations required to inhibit calcium permeation and 
hence inhibit smooth muscle contraction, as demonstrated in vitro (1.5 mM), are far above the 
concentrations which may be reached with 177LuCl 3 in vivo, using 177Lu for radioimmunotherapy. 
The effect of Lu3+ was investigated in rat septal neurons in culture by using the whole-cell voltage-clamp 
technique. GABA (10 μM) currents were moderately enhanced by about 40% upon application of a 
concentration of 100 μM Lu3+ . Again, concentrations found to be active were well above the concentration 
reached if 177Lu is used for radioimmunotherapy. Doses in the range of several mg/kg, and not ng/kg, would 
be required to achieve these concentrations.   
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been published with LuCl3 nor are any expected given the lack 
of pharmacodynamic effects seen with LuCl 3. 
The pharmacokinetic of 177Lu is dependent on the carrier molecule radiolabelled with the isotope.  In an effort 
to examine the dosimetry of 177LuCl 3 in case of accidental intravenous administration, a distribution study 
was carried out in rats.  The absorption of the 177Lu was examined following IV injection with 15 MBq/kg 
177LuCl 3.  In the male and female rat, following intravenous administration, Lutetium (177Lu) chloride is 
rapidly cleared from the blood: at 5 min post injection, only 1.52% of the injected activity (%ID) is found in 
blood (corresponding to 0.08%ID/g) and no activity above background levels remains 1 hour post dose. The 
main organs where Lutetium (177Lu) chloride distributes mainly are to the liver, spleen and bone. After one 
hour, the amount in the liver is 9.56% of the injected activity per gram (%ID/g) and in the spleen 
5.26%ID/g. In bone, the content increases from 0.01%ID/g at 5 min to 0.23%ID/g after 12 hours. For the 
next 28 days, further uptake of 177Lu can be observed in the bone, which is compensated in part by 
radioactive decay. Taking into account the radioactive half-life of 177Lu of 6.647 days, the radioactivity 
remaining in the bone after 28 days is only about 0.06%ID/g. 
The accumulation as the rate of clearance was dependent on radioactive decay. After 28 days, an average of 
30.3% of the injected dose is still found in the body, with 17.8 % in bone, 10.5 % in liver and 1.8 % in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404078/2016 
Page 26/58 
  
  
 
 
 
spleen. Faecal and urinary elimination is slow. As a result of both excretion and radioactive decay, the total 
radioactivity remaining in the body after 28 days is about 1.8% of the injected dose. Thus radioactive decay 
is thought to contribute significantly to overall clearance and this finding is supported in bone - 177Lu is taken 
up and no clearance other than radioactive decay could be demonstrated.  
Toxicology was described from the literature which is acceptable given that the toxicological properties of 
Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with EndolucinBeta prior to 
administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled (SmPC section 
5.3). The toxicological properties of Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling 
with EndolucinBeta prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be 
radiolabelled. The toxicity of non-radioactive Lutetium chloride has been studied in different mammalian 
species and using different administration routes. The intraperitoneal LD50 in mice was found to be 
approximately 315 mg/kg. In cats, no pharmacological effects on respiration and cardiovascular function 
were observed up to a cumulative intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg. A high dose of 10 GBq of 177Lu-chloride 
contains 2.4 µg Lutetium, corresponding to a human dose of 0.034 µg/kg. This dose is approximately 7 
orders of magnitude lower than the intraperitoneal LD50 in mice and more than 5 orders of magnitude lower 
than the NOEL observed in cats. Therefore, Lutetium metal-ion toxicity of EndolucinBeta (177Lu)-labelled 
medicinal products can be excluded. 
The most significant toxicological feature of radioactive lutetium chloride, concerns its uptake in bone. This 
uptake in bone is significant as this has been shown to result in osteosarcomas in mice, the risk is related to 
excessive distribution and accumulation to bone tissue.  Accumulation to bone/liver/spleen, the main targets 
for accumulation in animals, is absent in humans and it is considered unlikely that high levels of free 177Lu 
would be present in clinically relevant levels following administration of EndolucinBeta. This is a valid 
argument however it does not exclude the possibility of formation of osteosarcoma, this has been added as a 
potential important risk to the applicant’s RMP. As a result, the SmPC advises the inclusion of a chelator in 
the final formulation to bind and facilitate rapid renal clearance of any free 177Lu (see section 12 of the 
SmPC).  
No mutagenicity data was presented in line with Annex 1 Part III of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended.  
No data on reproductive and developmental toxicity has been published as the product is not to be 
administered directly to humans.  However, the use of EndolucinBeta is contraindicated in established or 
suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded and is highlighted accordingly in the SmPC 
section 4.3.  
An ERA has not been conducted for EndolucinBeta.  This is considered acceptable given that EndolucinBeta is 
a radiopharmaceutical precursor.  An ERA will be performed with the final radiolabelled product. With respect 
to the radioactive environmental impact 177LuCl3, it is important to highlight that 177Lutetium is a radioisotope 
with a relatively short half-life (6.7 days) which contribute significantly to a relative short-lasting 
environmental impact of the product. Therefore lutetium trichloride is not expected to pose a significant risk 
to the environment. The special precautions for storage and special precautions for disposal and other 
handling of unused medicinal product has been adequately justified in the SmPC section 6.4 and 6.6, 
respectively.  
The justification of EndolucinBeta as a New Active Substance is based on the premise that the matrix of the 
active moiety can contribute to the pharmaco-kinetics and biodistribution of the active moiety and in this 
Assessment report

manner can result in differences in efficacy and safety. The Applicant has pointed to the potential differences 
in the elemental impurities levels between Lumark and EndolucinBeta with the sum of impurities in Lumark 
potentially up to 200 µg/ml compared with EndolucinBeta of up to 22 µg/ml. These differences along with the 
fact that all EndolucinBeta is 177Lu compared to 12.5% in Lumark form the basis of the argument that the 
matrix of the active moiety is different.  
The Applicant has described a number of preclinical studies where they attempt to demonstrate that these 
differences in the matrix of the active moiety can result in differences in efficacy and safety. The Melis et al 24 
reference provides some direct comparison of carrier versus non-carrier added 177Lu and shows that less 
DOTATATE is required to attach the same amount of 177Lu when using non-carrier added 177Lu. The authors 
conclude that this increased specific activity might lead to improved clinical peptide receptor radiotherapy 
response. However, in the results section of the abstract the authors reveal that in a rat tumour model, both 
forms of 177Lu lead to tumour size reduction at 8 days and complete remission at 30 days. This data suggests 
that despite the potential differences in biodistribution, efficacy is unaffected. In the absence of shown 
differences in efficacy and safety and taking also into account the absence of comparison in any of the other 
studies which provides no further substantiation of this claim, the claim of New Active Substance status is not 
supported. 
2.3.8.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
177Lu has no pharmacological action and decays to stable 177Hf, which is also without any pharmacological 
effect.  There is no general concern over the toxicity of the lutetium in the preparation as it is not to be 
administered directly in humans. The safety of 177Lu will be evaluated further considering that single and 
repeated dose toxicity studies will be provided for the carrier medicinal products using the 177Lutetium 
radiolabel. The main concern related to the development of osteosarcoma and its latency observed in mice 
studies. The risk has been addressed in the RMP as a potential safety concern and in the SmPC, which 
includes recommendations on the addition of DTPA prior to intravenous administration of 177Lu labelled 
ligands. 
For the purpose of an application for a radiopharmaceutical for radiolabelling, the non-clinical aspects of 
EndolucinBeta have been adequately addressed.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No clinical pharmacology studies were submitted with this application (see clinical pharmacology discussion). 
The applicant submitted a review and discussion of the published literature on the pharmacokinetic properties 
of 177Lu. Lutetium (177Lu) chloride n.c.a. is a precursor to be used for radiolabelling purposes in combination 
with other medicinal products consisting of a suitable linker (chelator) and a disease-specific carrier.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No clinical pharmacology studies were submitted with this application (see clinical pharmacology discussion). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The lack of clinical pharmacology studies is considered acceptable. Lutetium (177Lu) chloride n.c.a. is not 
intended to be directly administered to the patient. The pharmacokinetics of a radiopharmaceutical would be 
dependent on the carrier molecule labelled with EndolucinBeta. The pharmacodynamics of a 
radiopharmaceutical would also be dependent on the carrier molecule and on the method of conjugation used 
to link it to the radioisotope. 177LuCl 3 has no primary pharmacodynamic function and only very few data are 
available on the general pharmacodynamics of lutetium as a metal ion and 177LuCl 3, administered as a free 
soluble radioactive metal salt. Ionic lutetium in general appears to have no pharmacological function, but 
radioactive lutetium salts have been investigated for a few clinical applications. 
No interaction studies of Lutetium (177Lu) chloride with other medicinal products have been performed. 
For information concerning interactions associated with the use of Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal 
products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be 
radiolabelled. 
The pharmacodynamic properties of Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling 
with EndolucinBeta, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be 
radiolabelled. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal 
product to be radiolabelled.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of EndolucinBeta will be dependent on the carrier molecule and on the method of 
conjugation used to link it to the radionuclide. The relevant clinical pharmacology data with EndolucinBeta will 
have to be submitted separately with the application for the different carrier molecules. Thus, the lack of 
studies in pharmacology for this application is acceptable. For the purpose of an application for a 
radiopharmaceutical for radiolabelling, the clinical pharmacology of EndolucinBeta has been adequately 
addressed.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The applicant did not submit dose response studies (see clinical efficacy discussion). 
2.5.2.  Clinical utility 
The applicant submitted clinical data from the literature to support the clinical utility of EndolucinBeta when 
attached to a relevant carrier or 177Lu radionuclide in treatment of neuroendocrine tumours (NET). 
177Lu as a radiopharmaceutical for neuroendocrine tumors 
Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy  
Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) is a form of molecular targeted therapy which is performed by 
using a small peptide that is coupled with a radionuclide emitting beta radiation. Somatostatin analogues 
labelled with radionuclides are a good example of PRRT. Because the majority of neuroendocrine tumours 
(NET) express somatostatin receptors which bind to somatostatin, they can be successfully targeted, and 
PRRT was found to be more effective in lesions with higher receptor expression. In advanced and 
metastasised NET, the use of surgery, external beam radiotherapy and chemotherapy as cytoreductive 
options is limited4. As an additional option, treatment with radiolabelled somatostatin analogues is considered 
to be important in the management of patients with inoperable or metastasised NET, 25, 26 , 27, 28. Recently, 
it has been suggested that repeated cycles of PRRT may also have potential in the neoadjuvant setting29. 
PRRT in this indication includes the use of 177Lu-labelled somatostatin analogues, and evidence of its clinical 
efficacy has been confirmed by various reviews of exploratory clinical trials30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 thereby 
supporting the therapeutic utility of 177Lu in targeted in vivo radiotherapy. 
For incorporation of a radiometal into a peptide structure, a chelator is required. For the coupling of the 
radionuclide and the somatostatin analogue in PRRT, the chelator DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-
1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) has been frequently used. As outlined below, several studies on 177Lu-based PRRT 
have investigated the use of different thermodynamically stable chelator somatostatin analogues, such as 
[DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotide (DOTATOC), [DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotate (DOTATATE) and [DOTA0-1-Nal3]octreotide 
(DOTANOC). DOTATATE differs from DOTATOC only in that the C-terminal threoninol is replaced with 
threonine, 37. 
In patients with somatostatin receptor-positive tumours, it was found that the uptake of radioactivity, 
expressed as a percentage of the injected dose of 177Lu-DOTATATE, was comparable with the use of 
111In-DOTATOC in the kidneys, spleen and liver, but was three to four times higher in four out of five 
tumours38. Another investigation compared 177Lu-DOTATOC and 177Lu-DOTATATE in patients39. For both 
peptides there was a fast clearance from the blood expressed as percentage of injected activity (%IA). 
During the first day, the blood clearance of 177Lu-DOTATOC was slightly faster than that of 177Lu-DOTATATE 
but the difference did not reach significance. Thereafter, blood clearance for both peptides was nearly the 
same. The cumulative excreted activity in the urine was higher for 177Lu-DOTATOC than for 177Lu-DOTATATE, 
at 81% versus 71%. The mean residence time ratio (177Lu-DOTATATE vs. 177Lu-DOTATOC) was 2.1 for

tumour, 1.5 for spleen and 1.4 for kidneys. This indicates that the radiation doses for the spleen and kidneys 
are lower with 177Lu-DOTATOC while the tumour-absorbed dose (or uptake) appears higher following 
administration of 177Lu-DOTATATE. The tumour-absorbed dose is important for the therapeutic success of 
PRRT but dose-limiting factors are the radiation exposure of the kidney and/or bone marrow40, 41 ,42. Thus, 
both compounds (177Lu-DOTATATE and 177Lu-DOTATOC) are potentially useful. 
Schuchardt et al.43 analysed the in vivo behaviour of the 177Lu-labelled peptides DOTATATE, DOTATOC and 
DOTANOC by measuring organ and tumour kinetics, and by performing dosimetric calculations. In total, 253 
patients with metastasised NET who underwent PRRT were examined. Out of these, 185 patients received 
177Lu-DOTATATE, 59 were treated with 177Lu-DOTATOC and 9 received 177Lu-DOTANOC. 177Lu-DOTATOC had 
the lowest uptake/dose delivered to normal organs and the highest tumour-to-kidney ratio. 177Lu-DOTATATE 
was shown to deliver the highest tumour dose (due to the longer residence time in the malignant lesions). 
The dose to whole body, spleen and kidneys was highest for 177Lu-DOTANOC. Both 177Lu-DOTATOC and 177Lu-
DOTATATE were considered by the authors suitable for PRRT.  
The same group 44 correlated the uptake, residence time and resulting mean absorbed dose in the kidneys 
with the post-therapy effect on renal function using 177Lu-DOTATATE and 177Lu-DOTATOC during consecutive 
cycles of PRRT in 22 patients with metastatic NET. The patients were followed up for 6-12 months. Uptake, 
residence time and mean absorbed dose to the kidneys were slightly, but significantly, higher for 
177Lu-DOTATATE. The tumour-to-kidney ratio was numerically higher for 177Lu-DOTATOC. There were no 
statistically significant changes in renal function parameters with either 177Lu-DOTATATE or 177Lu-DOTATOC. 
The authors concluded that 177Lu-DOTATOC delivers a slightly, but significantly, lower renal dose but both 
compounds are considered safe radiopharmaceuticals concerning renal toxicity. 
Based on Phase 2 trials, more than 1,000 patients suffering from advanced NET have been treated with 90Y- 
or 177Lu-labelled DOTATOC or DOTATATE in Europe by 2012; objective response rates of 20-40% were 
observed. It has been reported that some European centres perform 400 treatments with 177Lu-DOTATATE 
(7.4 GBq each) per year45. Also centres outside Europe already used 177Lu-DOTATATE in hundreds of patients 
suffering from various types of neuroendocrine-originated tumours46, 47. 
Therapeutic studies with 177Lu-DOTATOC in somatostatin receptor-positive cancers 
Relapsed NET 
 Forrer et al.48 performed a prospective study with 177Lu-DOTATOC in 27 patients with relapsed NET. All 
patients received 7.4 GBq of i.v. 177Lu-DOTATOC. Restaging was performed after 8-12 weeks. 177Lu-DOTATOC 
showed a high specific uptake by somatostatin receptor-positive tumours. The γ-component of 177Lu allowed 
acquisition of scintigraphic images of high quality. After restaging, a partial remission was observed in 2 
patients, a minor response in 5 patients, stable disease in 12 patients and progressive disease in 8 patients. 
177Lu-DOTATOC therapy was well tolerated. No serious adverse events occurred. The authors concluded that 
177Lu-DOTATOC therapy in patients with relapse after 90Y-DOTATOC treatment is feasible, safe and 
efficacious. Similar results were obtained in another study in patients switched to 177Lu-DOTATOC therapy 
following disease relapse after initial therapy with 90Y-DOTATOC49. 
Kratochwil et al.50 investigated the efficacy of 90Y- and/or 177Lu-DOTATOC when infused into the hepatic 
artery of 15 patients with liver metastases arising from NET. Complete remission was achieved in 1 (7%) 
patient and partial remission was observed in 8 (53%) patients, 6 patients were classified as stable (40%).

The concomitant decrease of elevated serum tumour marker confirmed the radiologic response. Median time 
to progression was not reached within a mean follow-up period of 20 months. 
Villard et al.51 compared the efficacy and safety of combined treatment with 90Y-DOTATOC and 177Lu-
DOTATOC versus treatment with 90Y-DOTATOC alone in patients with metastasised neuroendocrine cancers. 
Patients were treated with repeated cycles of 90Y-DOTATOC or with cycles alternating between 90Y-DOTATOC 
and 177Lu-DOTATOC. A total of 486 patients completed three or more treatment cycles; 237 patients received 
90Y-DOTATOC and 249 patients received 90Y-DOTATOC + 177Lu-DOTATOC. Patients receiving the combination 
had a significantly longer survival than patients receiving 90Y-DOTATOC alone (5.51 vs. 3.96 years, p = 
0.006). The rates of severe haematologic toxicities and severe renal toxicity were comparable between 
groups. The authors advocated the combined use because of the complementary characteristics of the 
radioisotopes. 90Y has a long-range, high-energy emission that allows for the deposition of high radiation 
doses in large metastases and 177Lu has a short-range, lower-energy emission that allows concentration of 
most of its dose in small metastases. 
In a comparative study conducted by Romer et al.52, patients with advanced NET underwent repeated cycles 
of 90Y-DOTATOC or 177Lu-DOTATOC until progression of disease or permanent adverse events. Overall, 910 
patients underwent 1,804 cycles of 90Y-DOTATOC and 141 patients underwent 259 cycles of 177Lu-DOTATOC. 
The median survival after 177Lu-DOTATOC and after 90Y-DOTATOC was comparable (45.5 vs. 35.9 months, 
p = 0.49). Subgroup analyses revealed a significantly longer survival for 177Lu-DOTATOC in patients with low 
tumour uptake, solitary lesions and extra-hepatic lesions. The rate of severe transient hematotoxicities was 
lower after 177Lu-DOTATOC treatment (1.4 vs. 10.1%, p = 0.001) while the rate of severe permanent renal 
toxicities was similar in both treatment groups (9.2 vs. 7.8%, p = 0.32). 
Somatostatin receptor-positive metastatic paraganglioma and phaeochromocytoma 
Forrer et al.53 evaluated the efficacy and safety of radiolabelled DOTATOC in 28 patients with surgically 
incurable somatostatin receptor-positive metastatic paraganglioma and phaeochromocytoma. Most patients 
received initial treatment with 90Y-DOTATOC followed by 2 cycles of 7.4 GBq 177Lu-DOTATOC. Restaging was 
performed at 8-12 weeks after the last treatment cycle. At restaging, 2 partial remissions and 5 minor 
responses were found. In addition, there were 2 mixed responses; 13 patients showed a stable disease and 6 
patients remained progressive. Time to progression ranged from 3 to > 42 months. The treatment was well 
tolerated. The authors concluded that radiolabelled DOTATOC appears to be a treatment option for surgically 
incurable paragangliomas because of low toxicity and long-lasting remissions. 
Metastatic gastrinomas 
Grozinsky-Glasberg et al.54 retrospectively studied 11 patients with metastatic gastrinomas. Nine patients 
received alternately 90Y-DOTATOC and 177Lu-DOTATOC for progressive disease; 2 patients received 177Lu-
DOTATATE. PRRT induced symptomatic improvement in all patients. Periodic radiological surveillance showed 
complete response in 1 patient, partial tumour response in 5 patients and tumour stabilisation in 5 patients. 
In 7 patients, the anti-tumour effect of PRRT persisted after a median period of 14 months. Four patients 
died due to tumour progression. The authors concluded that PRRT seems to be a promising tool for the 
management of patients with inoperable or progressive metastatic gastrinomas.

Recently, it has been suggested that gamma probe-guided surgery after tandem PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATOC 
and 90Y-DOTATOC is feasible and appears to be more sensitive than 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT. This technique 
might achieve a more complete tumour resection through intra-operative detection of very small lesions 
directly after PRRT55. 
Therapeutic studies with 177Lu-DOTATATE in neuroendocrine gastro-entero-pancreatic tumours 
Kwekkeboom et al. performed a study in 35 patients with neuroendocrine gastro-entero-pancreatic tumours. 
Patients were treated at doses of 3.7, 5.5 or 7.4 GBq 177Lu-DOTATATE up to a final cumulative dose of 22.2-
29.6 GBq, with treatment intervals of 6-9 weeks. Three months after the final administration, complete 
remission was found in 1 patient (3%), partial remission in 12 (35%), stable disease in 14 (41%) and 
progressive disease in 7 patients (21%). Grade 3 anaemia, leucocytopenia and thrombocytopenia occurred 
after 0%, 1% and 1% of administrations, respectively. Serum creatinine and creatinine clearance did not 
change significantly. The authors concluded that in view of the high success rate of 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy 
and the absence of serious side effects, it should be used in patients with gastro-entero-pancreatic tumours 
without waiting for tumour progression. 
Teunissen et al.56 evaluated the quality of life in patients with metastatic somatostatin receptor-positive 
gastro-entero-pancreatic tumours treated with 177Lu-DOTATATE. Fifty patients who had been treated with 
22.2 to 29.6 GBq of 177Lu-DOTATATE and had a follow-up of at least 3 months were studied. Twenty-four 
patients had regression, 19 had stable disease, 6 had progressive disease, and one had a non-assessable 
disease status. 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy significantly improved the quality of life status as well as several 
function and symptom scales, especially in those patients with proven tumour regression. The results were 
confirmed in a subsequent study (performed by the same group) in 265 patients with gastro-entero-
pancreatic or bronchial neuroendocrine tumours treated with 177Lu-DOTATATE57. 
Kwekkeboom et al. conducted a study in 131 patients with metastasized or inoperable endocrine gastro-
entero-pancreatic tumours positive for somatostatin receptors. The patients were treated up to a cumulative 
dose of 22.2 to 29.6 GBq of 177Lu-DOTATATE. A favourable effect on tumour size was observed in 47% of 
patients, with a median time to progression of > 36 months. The latter compared favourably with 
chemotherapy. Serious side effects were rare. A sub-analysis of patients with somatostatin receptor-positive 
foregut carcinoid tumours of bronchial, gastric or thymic origin showed an overall remission rate of 50%58 . 
The treatment effects of 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy were described in another large group of patients with 
gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours59 . Patients were treated up to a cumulative dose of 27.8 
to 29.6 GBq, usually in four treatment cycles, with treatment intervals of 6 to 10 weeks. Toxicity analysis was 
done in 504 patients and efficacy analysis in 310 patients. Complete and partial tumour remissions occurred 
in 2% and 28% of patients, respectively. Minor tumour response occurred in 16%. Median time to 
progression was 40 months. Median overall survival from start of treatment was 46 months and median 
overall survival from diagnosis was 128 months. Compared with historical controls, there was a survival 
benefit of 40 to 72 months from diagnosis. Treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE had few adverse effects. Any 
hematologic toxicity grade 3 or 4 occurred after 3.6% of administrations. Serious adverse events that were 
likely attributable to the treatment were myelodysplastic syndrome in 3 patients, and temporary, nonfatal 
liver toxicity in 2 patients. 
Kunikowska et al.60  performed a non-randomised study with a combination of simultaneously administered 
radionuclides. A cocktail of 50% 90Y-DOTATATE + 50% 177Lu-DOTATATE was used in 25 patients with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404078/2016

disseminated NET and compared to another group of 25 patients treated with 90Y-DOTATATE alone. Overall 
survival was significantly longer in patients treated with the combination (p = 0.027). Tumour response and 
progression-free survival were not significantly different between treatments. Side effects were rare and mild. 
The authors suggest that the therapy with tandem radioisotopes (90Y-/177Lu-DOTATATE) provides longer 
overall survival than with a single radioisotope (90Y-DOTATATE), with a comparable safety profile. The study 
confirmed preliminary results gathered in 16 patients with NET refractory to conventional therapy61 .  
Bodei et al.62  performed a Phase 1-2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 177Lu-DOTATATE 
administered in multiple cycles to patients with unresectable/metastatic somatostatin receptor-positive 
tumours (mainly NET). Fifty-one patients received escalating doses of 177Lu-DOTATATE (Group 1: 3.7-5.18 
GBq/cycle, Group 2: 5.18-7.4 GBq/cycle). Cumulative activities ranged from 3.7 to 29.2 GBq. Partial and 
complete responses occurred in 15 of 46 (32.6%) assessable patients. The median time to progression was 
36 months. Overall survival was 68% at 36 months. 177Lu-DOTATATE was well tolerated up to 29 GBq 
cumulative activity. The maximum tolerated dose/cycle was not reached. 
In another Phase 2 study, Claringbold et al.63  investigated the efficacy and safety of capecitabine combined 
with 177Lu-DOTATATE for the treatment of disseminated, progressive, unresectable NET. Enrolled Patients 
(N = 33) received four cycles of 7.8 GBq 177Lu-DOTATATE at 8-weekly intervals. Chemotherapy with oral 
1,650 mg/m2 capecitabine for 14 consecutive days was commenced in the morning of radionuclide therapy. 
Cycles of capecitabine were repeated every 8 weeks at the time of each subsequent radiopeptide infusion. 
Tumour control and stabilisation of disease was obtained in 94% of patients. The addition of capecitabine 
chemotherapy did not increase the minimal toxicity of 177Lu-DOTATATE radiopeptide therapy. The same 
group conducted a similar study in which a comparable treatment schedule was applied in patients with 
advanced NET (N = 35). However, temozolomide was added during the last five days of each capecitabine 
cycle. The authors conclude that 177Lu-DOTATATE, in combination with capecitabine and temozolomide, was 
well tolerated and showed substantial tumor control rates64 .  
Sansovini et al.65  evaluated the efficacy and safety profile of 177Lu-DOTATATE in patients with advanced G1-
G2 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. Fifty-two consecutive patients were treated at two different 
therapeutic doses of 18.5 or 27.8 GBq in five cycles, according to the patient's kidney function and bone 
marrow reserve. Both therapeutic doses resulted in antitumor activity, with 12% complete response, 27% 
partial response and 46% stable disease in the high-dose group, whereas 4% showed complete response, 
15% partial response and 58% stable disease in the low-dose group. No major acute or delayed 
haematological toxicity were reported. The authors concluded that progression-free survival was significantly 
longer (p = 0.05) after a total activity of 27.8 GBq. 
Van Vliet et al.66  investigated RECIST, SWOG criteria, modified RECIST (mRECIST) and modified SWOG 
(mSWOG) criteria in patients with NET treated with 177Lu-DOTATATE. Two-hundred sixty-eight patients were 
studied. The rates of objective response, stable disease and progressive disease were 28%, 49% and 24%, 
respectively, according to RECIST; 25%, 49% and 26%, respectively, according to SWOG; 44%, 33% and 
24%, respectively, according to mRECIST; and 45%, 29% and 26%, respectively, according to mSWOG. The 
authors concluded that with all 4 scoring systems, patients with progressive disease had a significantly 
shorter overall survival than patients with an objective response or stable disease. 
In the context of a non-randomised Phase 2 trial in the USA, Delpassand et al. enrolled 37 patients with 
grade 1 and grade 2 disseminated and progressive gastro-entero-pancreatic NET. Repeated cycles of 
radiotherapy were administered. In each cycle, patients received 7.4 GBq of 177Lu-DOTATATE via i.v. infusion 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404078/2016 
Page 34/58 
  
  
 
 
 
up to a cumulative dose of 29.6 GBq. Among 32 evaluable patients, partial response and minimal response to 
treatment were seen in 28% and 3%, respectively, and stable disease was observed in 41% of patients. In 
total, 28% had progressive disease. The authors concluded that a response to treatment was significantly 
associated with lower burden of disease in the liver. Moreover, no significant acute or delayed hematologic or 
kidney toxicity was observed.  
Other uses of 177Lu-DOTATATE 
177Lu also emits low-energy γ-rays which allow direct imaging and dosimetry after therapy, 67, 68. Based on a 
study in 39 patients with metastatic NET, it has also been suggested that pre-treatment dosimetry is possible 
with 177Lu-DOTATATE, giving the opportunity to tailor therapies more accurately69. 
177Lu as a radiopharmaceutical to treat painful bone metastases 
Ethylene diamine tetra methylene phosphonic acid (EDTMP) forms stable complexes with various radiometals 
and these EDTMP-radiometal complexes concentrate in the skeleton in proportion to osteoblastic activity70. 
Yuan et al.72  conducted a Phase 2 study with 177Lu-labelled EDTMP to assess its efficacy and safety in the 
palliative treatment of bone pain in patients with breast cancer and hormone refractory prostate cancer with 
bone metastases. Sixteen patients were enrolled in the trial and were subsequently divided into two groups, 
the low-dose group (1.295 GBq) and the high dose group (2.59 GBq). An obvious reduction in the mean pain 
score was observed at 2 to 6 weeks after the administration of 177Lu-EDTMP. The rate of complete responses 
in bone pain palliation was 55% in Group 1 and 80% in Group 2 at 6 weeks after treatment. The authors 
conclude that doses as high as 2.59 GBq were well tolerated and that the study indicate that 177Lu-EDTMP is 
an effective and safe treatment for palliation of metastatic bone pain in patients with prostate or breast 
cancer. 
Shinto et al.71  also evaluated the potential of 177Lu-EDTMP for palliation of metastatic bone pain. Ten 
patients with disseminated skeletal metastases received a single bolus infusion of 177Lu-EDTMP (3.7 GBq). A 
significant reduction in the mean pain score was noted in all patients. The initial mean pain score of 8.44 
dropped to 5.73 within 1 month of treatment. The toxicity of the agent was assessed by analysing complete 
blood counts. None of the patients experienced blood-related toxicity. 
In an effort to exploit the potential of other bone-seeking agents for imaging and therapy, 177Lu-labelled 
complexes of DOTA derivatives (i.e. bisphosphonate monoamide analogues) have been in development72. 
177Lu as a radiopharmaceutical to radiolabel monoclonal antibodies for radioimmunotherapy 
For radioimmunotherapy, radionuclides are attached to monoclonal antibodies (or to fragments thereof). In 
the past, mainly 131I or 90Y were used for that purpose. Recently, it has been suggested that other 
radionuclides, such as 177Lu, with better physical properties will further improve the safety of this therapy73.  
Radioimmunotherapy combines biologic and radiolytic mechanisms to destroy targeted tumour cells. In 
addition, the crossfire effect of the β-radiation as well as the bystander effect may kill malignant cells that do 
not express the target protein or may be poorly vascularised74. For the coupling of 177Lu with the antibody, 
the chelator DOTA is usually used. Some review articles provide evidence for the clinical utility of 177Lu-
labelled monoclonal antibodies in targeted in vivo radioimmunotherapy75, 76.

Antibody CC49 
CC49 is a murine monoclonal antibody that recognises the tumour-associated glycoprotein 72. An initial 
Phase 1 study of i.v. 177Lu-labelled CC49 (using the chelator PA-DOTA) in 9 patients with previously treated 
advanced adenocarcinoma revealed no antitumour response77 .  
In another early Phase 1 study, 12 ovarian cancer patients who failed chemotherapy received intraperitoneal 
177Lu-CC49 antibody. One of 8 patients with gross disease had > 50% tumour reduction after therapy, while 
six progressed and one went off study with stable disease. Of patients with microscopic or occult disease, one 
relapsed at 10 months and three remained without evidence of disease after 18 months. The maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) could not be reached with levels of 0.37, 0.67, 0.93 and 1.11 GBq/m2. The author 
concluded that intraperitoneal radioimmunotherapy with 177Lu-CC49 was well tolerated and appears to have 
anti-tumour activity against chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer in the peritoneal cavity78. 
Alvarez et al.79  conducted a Phase 1-2 study of intraperitoneal 177Lu-CC49 antibody in 27 ovarian cancer 
patients who failed chemotherapy. One of 13 patients with gross disease had > 50% tumour reduction after 
therapy. Seven of 9 patients with < 1 cm nodules progressed in ≤ 21 months. Of patients with microscopic or 
occult disease, one relapsed at 10 months and four of five remained without evidence of disease at > 6 to 35 
months. Bone marrow suppression was the dose-limiting toxic effect. The MTD was assessed at 1.67 GBq/m2.  
In a Phase 1 study, Meredith et al.80  examined the feasibility of combining subcutaneous interferon and 
intraperitoneal Taxol (paclitaxel) with intraperitoneal 177Lu-CC49. In total, 46 patients with recurrent or 
persistent ovarian cancer were enrolled. The MTD for 177Lu-CC49 was 1.48 GBq/m2 when given with 
interferon + 100 mg/m2 Taxol. Four of 17 patients with measurable disease had a partial response and 4 of 
27 patients with non-measurable disease had progression-free intervals of 18+, 21+, 21+ and 37+ months. 
The authors concluded that the combination of intraperitoneal Taxol with 177Lu-CC49 and interferon was well 
tolerated, with bone marrow suppression being the dose-limiting toxicity. The same group analysed data 
from 92 patients > 5 years after intraperitoneal radionuclide therapy with 90Y- or 177Lu-CC49 to determine 
prognostic factors. A statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival was noted for less 
bulky disease and younger age. Dose escalation of radionuclide did not change risk of progression. Therefore, 
the authors concluded that this therapy may have therapeutic efficacy at modest dose levels81. 
Antibody J591 
Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a well-established, prostate cancer-restricted, cell-surface 
antigen. J591 is a monoclonal de-immunised murine anti-PSMA antibody which has been developed to target 
the extracellular domain of PSMA. J591 can be used to deliver radioisotopes to prostate cancer cells82 . 
A Phase 1 trial of 177Lu-labelled J591 (up to three doses using the chelator DOTA) was performed in 35 
patients with progressing androgen-independent prostate cancer83, 84. Biologic activity was seen in 4 patients 
experiencing ≥ 50% declines in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels lasting from 3+ to 8 months. An 
additional 16 patients (46%) experienced PSA stabilisation for a median of 60 days. The authors concluded 
that excellent targeting of known sites of prostate cancer metastases was seen. The MTD of 177Lu-J591 was 
assessed at 2.59 GBq/m2. Myelosuppression was the dose limiting toxicity. The authors concluded that 
multiple doses of 1.11 GBq/m2 were well tolerated.  
Antibody cG250 (girentuximab) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404078/2016 
Page 36/58 
  
  
 
 
 
The chimeric antibody cG250 (girentuximab) is reactive with carbonic anhydrase IX, a heat-sensitive 
transmembranous glycoprotein which is ubiquitously expressed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). 
Expression in normal tissues is restricted to the gastrointestinal mucosa and gastrointestinal-related 
structures with much lower expression levels than in ccRCC. Patients with metastatic ccRCC have a dismal 
prognosis85. 
Stillebroer et al.88 conducted a Phase 1 radioimmunotherapy study with 177Lu-labelled cG250 (conjugated 
with DOTA) in 23 patients with progressive metastasized ccRCC. Groups of 3 patients received 177Lu-cG250, 
starting at a dose level of 1.11 GBq/m2 with dose increments of 0.37 GBq/m2 per group. Patients could 
receive a total of three treatment cycles. The MTD was assessed at 2.405 GBq/m2 because higher doses 
resulted in dose-limiting myelotoxicity. Most patients (74%) demonstrated stable disease at 3 months after 
the first treatment, and 1 patient showed a partial response that lasted for 9 months. Mean growth of target 
tumour lesions was reduced from 40.4% during the last 3 months before study entry to 5.5% at 3 months 
after the first treatment cycle. The authors concluded that radioimmunotherapy with 177Lu-cG250 may 
stabilise previously progressive metastatic ccRCC. 
Rituximab 
Rituximab, is approved for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and it has been shown that DOTA-
rituximab (4:1) can be labelled with 177Lu with sufficient stability while the immunoconjugate retains its 
immunoreactivity86.  
Forrer et al.87, 88 conducted a Phase 1-2 study with 177Lu-DOTA-rituximab in 31 patients suffering from 
relapsing follicular, mantle cell or other indolent B-cell lymphomas. To evaluate the MTD, the dosage of the 
radiopharmaceutical was adjusted according to body surface area. The MTD was assessed at 1.67 GBq/m2. 
Thrombocytopenia and leucopenia were the dose-limiting toxicities. Clinical responses were observed at all 
dose levels and for all lymphoma entities. Some of the responses were durable; the longest follow-up was 
> 8 years. At time of reporting, 11 patients were alive and 8 patients were disease-free. The authors 
concluded that 177Lu-DOTA-rituximab treatment was a safe and feasible option for the lymphoma entities 
investigated. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
No original clinical efficacy studies were conducted by the applicant as information related to clinical efficacy 
obtained from the precursor alone is not considered relevant in the present case. Information on the clinical 
utility of the radiopharmaceutical precursor (177Lu) when attached to appropriate carrier molecules was 
provided. 
The Applicant presented relevant and recent published articles to demonstrate the clinical utility of 177Lu in 
patients with neuroendocrine tumours using 177Lu-labelled somatostatin analogues. The applicant presents 
recent publications documenting therapeutic effects in neuroendocrine gastro-entero-pancreatic tumours, as 
well as some very recent studies looking at palliative treatment of bone pain in patients with breast cancer.  
For the purpose of this application, it is sufficient that clinical utility in neuroendocrine tumours has been 
demonstrated. As expected with this radiopharmaceutical precursor, no indication is claimed with this 
application. It is intended for radiolabelling of suitable carrier molecules (peptides, antibodies) which have 
been specifically developed and authorised for radiolabelling with this radionuclide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404078/2016

For each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity administered 
should in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required therapeutic effect. 
EndolucinBeta is not to be administered directly to the patient, but must be used for the radiolabelling of 
carrier molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides, vitamins or other substrates. 
For more information concerning paediatric use of Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products refer to the 
Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. The 
European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of the studies with EndolucinBeta 
in all subsets of the paediatric population on grounds that the specific medicinal product does not represent a 
significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for paediatric patients. This waiver does however not 
extend to any therapeutic uses of the product when linked to a carrier molecule (see section 4.2 of the SmPC 
for information on paediatric use). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
It is the view of the CHMP that clinical utility of EndolucinBeta attached to the relevant molecular carrier has 
been demonstrated for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumours.  According to Directive 2001/83/EC, as 
amended, Annex I Part III, this is considered sufficient for the purposes of applications for 
radiopharmaceuticals for radiolabelling. Further efficacy and safety data in particular indications will be 
assessed during the marketing authorisation application for carrier molecules proposing to use EndolucinBeta 
as a radiolabel. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The applicant did not submit safety data in humans with EndolucinBeta since EndolucinBeta is not intended to 
be administered directly to patients. 
The safety of EndolucinBeta has been considered from two perspectives: safety relating to lutetium itself 
attached to an appropriate carrier and safety relating to radioactivity. 
Patient exposure 
The applicant did not provide information on patient exposure. 
Radiation protection 
Point-source approximation shows that the average dose rate experienced 20 hours after administration of a 
dose of 7.3 GBq EndolucinBeta labelled radiopharmaceutical (residual radioactivity 1.5 GBq) by a person at 1 
meter distance from the patient’s body centre with an abdominal radius of 15 cm is 3.5 µSv/h. Doubling the 
distance to the patient to 2 meters reduces the dose rate by a factor of 4, to 0.9 µSv/h. The same dose in a 
patient with an abdominal radius of 25 cm yields a dose rate at 1 meter of 2.6 µSv/h. The generally accepted 
threshold for discharge of the treated patient from the hospital is 20 µSv/hr. In most countries, the exposure 
limit for hospital staff is set the same as for the general public at 1 mSv/year. When taking the 3.5 µSv/h 
dose rate as an average, this would allow hospital staff to work approx. 300 hours/year in close vicinity of 
patients treated with EndolucinBeta labelled radiopharmaceuticals without wearing radiation protection. Of

course, the nuclear medicine staff is expected to wear standard radiation protection. Further precautions with 
respect to relatives, carers and hospital staff are provided in section 6.6 of the SmPC. 
Dosimetry and biodistribution 
Dosimetry data on Lutetium (177Lu) chloride n.c.a.  
The dosimetry of 177Lu chloride n.c.a. has been assessed in a study in rats (see non-clinical section). Using 
the animal data collected in the rat biodistribution and dosimetry study, the dosimetry estimates were based 
on a rat biodistribution study performed according to MIRD pamphlet no.16, and the calculations were 
performed using the OLINDA 1.1 software package. Time points for measurements were 5 minutes, 1 hour, 
12 hours, 2 days, 7 days and 28 days. Propagation for the various age classes was carried out according to 
Stabin and Siegel89, using different body phantoms for the various age classes.  The resulting estimated 
organ absorbed radiation doses and effective doses are given in Table 7 below. 
The extrapolated data show that after (accidental) injection of 177LuCl3 in man, the spleen (5.7 mSv/MBq) 
and the liver (5.6 mSv/MBq) absorb most of the administered radioactive dose, followed by the osteogenic 
cells (2.2 mSv/MBq). All other organs absorb less than 1 mSv/MBq each, with the red marrow absorbing 0.59 
mSv/MBq, the kidneys 0.37 mSv/MBq, the adrenals 0.21 mSv/MBq, and the remainder ≤ 0.1 mSv/MBq each. 
Overall, the absorbed radiation doses increase with decreasing age, as with any radionuclide. The total 
effective dose is 0.534 mSv/MBq in a 73.7 kg adult, increasing to 3.88 mSv/MBq in a 9.7 kg one-year-old.  
Thus, with accidental injection of for example one GBq 177LuCl3 (each vial delivered contains an activity 
ranging from 3 to 150 GBq), the total effective dose would be 0.53 Sv for an adult, which could be associated 
with first clinical signs of radiation toxicity, such as nausea and fatigue90. From the dosimetry Table 5, the 
lowest dose of 0.3 GBq administered accidentally would result in radiation toxicity to individual organs.  
The radiation dose received by various organs following intravenous administration of a Lutetium (177Lu)-
labelled medicinal product is dependent on the specific molecule being radiolabelled. 
Information on radiation dosimetry of each different medicinal product following administration of the 
radiolabelled preparation is available in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the 
particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. 
The dosimetry table below is presented in order to evaluate the contribution of non-conjugated Lutetium 
(177Lu) to the radiation dose following the administration of a Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal product or 
resulting from an accidental intravenous injection of EndolucinBeta.

intravenous administration of 177LuCl3 for various human age classes, based on 
data collected in rats (n=24) 
The effective dose to a 73.7 kg adult resulting from an inadvertently injected intravenous activity of 1 GBq 
would be 534 mSv. 
Radioimmunotherapy of Neuroendocrine tumours 
Currently the primary clinical use of 177Lu is the treatment of neuroendocrine tumours, targeting the 
somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtype 2 with somatostatin analogues, which are 177Lu labelled, using DOTA 
and derivatives of DOTA as chelating agents . Different peptide ligands have been tried, starting with 
octreotide, which was later replaced with [Tyr3]octreotide, a ligand with higher selectivity to the SSTR 
subtype 2. This ligand binds to the SSTR subtype 2, but also to subtype 3 and 5. The selective binding is

associated with a high affinity for SSTR-expressing tissues, including SSTR-positive tumours, with very little 
uptake in other tissues (except kidneys). The coupling with 177Lu results in a high exposure of the tumour 
tissue to energy primarily from the β-decay, sparing the surrounding tissue due to the low penetration depth 
of about 2 mm. 
Adverse events 
Safety of 177Lu-based PRRT  
Adequate dosimetry is mandatory for effective and safe PRRT and dose-limiting organs are usually either the 
kidneys or the bone marrow, 91.  
After PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE, the radioactivity concentration in the bone marrow is identical to that in the 
blood with no significant binding of the radiopharmaceutical to bone marrow precursor stem cells. An 
individual calculation of the bone marrow absorbed dose is necessary due to high between-patient variability.  
The kidneys are critical organs in PRRT because somatostatin analogues are mainly excreted renally. After 
being filtered by glomeruli, radiopeptides are reabsorbed and retained from the proximal tubule; renal 
toxicity occurs because of irradiation of the radiosensitive glomeruli by activity retained in the relatively 
radioresistant tubular cells. The radiation dose to the kidneys may pose an important limit to the amount of 
radioactivity that can be administered safely92 . Hence, there is the need for kidney protection when PRRT 
(e.g. with 177Lu-DOTATOC, 177Lu-DOTATATE or 90Y-DOTATOC) is applied in patients with somatostatin 
receptor-positive tumours. Most centres therefore combine the treatment with some form of amino acid 
infusion to inhibit tubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide.  
Renal function loss and even end-stage renal disease have been reported after PRRT with 90Y-DOTATOC,  93 . 
The range of beta particles (β-) from 90Y is maximally 12 mm which is long enough to reach the glomeruli; 
however, the range of the 177Lu-electrons is shorter (approximately 2 mm) which causes a lower average 
decline in creatinine clearance compared to patients treated with 90Y-labelled carriers. In a study performed 
by Valkema et al., the median decline in creatinine clearance was 7.3% per year in patients treated with 90Y-
DOTATOC and 3.8% per year in patients treated with 177Lu-DOTATATE (p = 0.06). Other studies did also 
suggest that 177Lu-DOTATATE is less toxic to the kidneys than 90Y-DOTATOC94.  
Studies showed that 177Lu-DOTATOC could be less toxic to the kidneys than 177Lu-DOTATATE, ,  , both 
compounds have been assessed as safe radiopharmaceuticals with regard to renal toxicity.  
The complete side effect profile of a maximum injected activity of 7.4 GBq per cycle of 177Lu-DOTATATE was 
analysed in a large cohort of 504 patients with gastro-entero-pancreatic NET (1,772 treatments between 
January 2000 to August 2006). Acute side effects occurring within 24 hours after the administration of the 
radiopeptide were nausea after 25% of administrations, vomiting after 10%, and abdominal discomfort or 
pain after 10%. Acute haematological toxicity was often mild and transient with grade 3 or 4 toxicity (WHO 
criteria) in 3.6% of administrations calculated on a per-cycle basis or 9.5% of patients on a per-patient basis 
(at least one of several cycles). Temporary mild hair loss occurred in 62% of patients but alopecia was rare. 
Serious delayed adverse events that were likely attributable to treatment were myelodysplastic syndrome in 
3 patients, and temporary, non-fatal liver toxicity in 2 patients. In 6 patients (approximately 1%) with highly 
hormonally active NET, a hormone-related crisis occurred after administration due to massive release of 
bioactive substances. With adequate treatment, all patients eventually recovered95. In the other studies with 
177Lu-DOTATATE, no major acute or delayed renal or haematological toxicity was observed,, . In one of these

studies, the occurrence of nausea and vomiting was attributed to the co-administration of hyperosmolar 
solution of amino acids because the symptoms subsided shortly after completion of therapy.  
Safety of 177Lu-based Radioimmunotherapy  
Preliminary data from various clinical studies (mainly Phase 1) with 177Lu-labelled monoclonal antibodies 
suggest that the grade of toxicity was dose-dependent as demonstrated in dose escalating studies79, 79, 83, 84, 
85, 87. 
For certain 177Lu-labelled antibodies (e.g. 177Lu-J591), the liver, spleen or kidney might be critical organs 
based on radiation dosimetry estimates96. In the same population, myelotoxicity after treatment with 177Lu-
J591 could be predicted on the basis of the amount of radioactive dose administered. The cross-fire effect of 
high-energy β--particles within the bone and the marrow may deliver radiation doses non-uniformly97. 
No local reactions were observed in humans, healthy volunteers and patients suffering from advanced 
anthraco-silicosis or sarcoidosis, given intradermal injection of hafnium oxychloride. The study was 
specifically designed to evaluate whether hafnium (and other metal salts) could induce local persistent tissue 
reactions, and therefore patients were evaluated for up to nine months. In none of the patients administered 
intradermal hafnium oxychloride, a tissue reaction was observed98. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No death has resulted from the administration of any ligand radiolabeled with 177Lu up to now. A study has 
shown that myelodysplastic syndrome is a rare but serious complication of treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE.  
In most articles describing the use of i.v. 177Lu-DOTATOC, no serious adverse effects, including kidney 
toxicity, were reported, , . In one large study (910 patients received 1,804 cycles of 90Y-DOTATOC and 141 
patients received 259 cycles of 177Lu-DOTATOC), the rate of severe transient haematotoxicities was lower 
after 177Lu-DOTATOC treatment compared with 90Y-DOTATOC (1.4 vs. 10.1%, p = 0.001) while the rate of 
severe permanent renal toxicities was similar in both treatment groups (9.2 vs. 7.8%, p = 0.32).  
Laboratory findings 
A study in 47 patients with NET showed a significant decrease in mean serum calcium levels after treatment 
with 177Lu-DOTATATE, resulting in mild hypocalcaemia in about 20% of patients. It was concluded that serum 
calcium levels should be monitored after PRRT. Sierra et al.99 reported that lymphocyte toxicity in PRRT is 
mainly due to the selective targeting of B-cells. The drop in B-cells was more pronounced with 90Y-DOTATOC 
than after 177Lu-DOTATATE administration.  
Safety in special populations 
As this is a radioactive medicinal product, it is contraindicated for use during pregnancy. 
The handling of 177Lu-labelled pharmaceuticals implies an increase of the personnel exposure. One study 
evaluated the skin equivalent doses during 177Lu-DOTATOC labelling and administration. The authors 
concluded that the use of appropriate protection devices and procedures allows the observance of generally 
accepted dose limits for exposed workers100.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No data on safety related to drug-drug interaction was submitted (see clinical safety discussion).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The results from published experience with 177Lu-labelled carrier molecules clearly support the overall clinical 
safety of 177Lu in targeted in vivo radiotherapy.  
The safety profiles of 177Lu-DOTATATE and 177Lu-DOTATOC in PRRT are well documented.  
The results from published clinical experience with 177Lu-labelled carrier molecules such as 177Lu-DOTATATE 
or 177Lu-DOTATOC suggest that 177Lu can be well tolerated and adverse drug reactions are manageable in 
patients receiving the targeted radiotherapy. The dose-limiting organs upon 177Lu-DOTATATE or 177Lu-
DOTATOC therapy are usually either the kidneys or the bone marrow. If kidney protective agents are used, 
renal adverse effects are usually mild. Most frequent acute adverse effects include nausea, vomiting and 
abdominal discomfort/pain which can be controlled by supportive measures. Other, usually reversible, side 
effects are bone marrow depression and impaired renal function. Hormonal crises occur infrequently.  
Adverse reactions following the administration of a Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal product prepared by 
radiolabelling with EndolucinBeta will be dependent on the specific medicinal product being used. Such 
information will be supplied in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal 
product to be radiolabelled. 
Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of hereditary 
defects. The radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer and 
mutations. In all cases, it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation are less than from the disease 
itself. The risk has been included as an important potential risk in the RMP. There is the potential risk 
identified of the development of osteosarcoma as 177Lu is taken up and accumulated in the bones.  
Extrapolation of animal data to man suggest that after accidental injection of Lutetium (177Lu) chloride n.c.a. 
ITG, the highest absorption is to be expected is in the spleen (5.7 mSv/MBq) and the liver (5.6 mSv/MBq), 
followed by the osteogenic cells (2.2 mSv/MBq). The total effective dose would be 0.534 mSv/MBq in a 73.3 
kg adult. All other organs absorb less than 1 mSv/MBq.  Accidental injection of one GBq 177LuCl 3 in an adult, 
given the total effective dose would be 0.53 mSv/MBq for an adult, could result in the first clinical sign of 
radiation toxicity (nausea and fatigue).  In a 5 year old, this would result in severe radiation toxicity and in a 
one year might be fatal were the total effect dose increases to 3.88 mSv/MBq – the absorbed radiation doses 
increase with decreasing age.  However, 177LuCl 3 is for in vitro labelling only and is not to be administered 
directly, so this data reflects at best a very worst case scenario.  It is recommended to add a binding agent 
such as DTPA prior to intravenous administration of 177Lu-labeled conjugates in order to form a complex with 
free 177Lu, leading to rapid renal clearance. This has been adequately addressed in the SmPC section 4.9. It is 
expected that in centres where this radiolabel will be used, the necessary special precautions for disposal and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404078/2016

other handling and preparation of radiopharmaceuticals would be taken into consideration to minimise 
radiation exposure and further guidance is provided in the SmPC in sections 6.6 and 12, respectively. 
Renal impairment and bone marrow compromise: Careful consideration of the benefit risk ratio in these 
patients is required since an increased radiation exposure is possible.  It is recommended to perform 
individual radiation dosimetry assessments of specific organs, which may not be the target organ of therapy. 
When an administration of radiopharmaceuticals to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it is 
important to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period should be 
assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. If in doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the woman has 
missed a period, if the period is very irregular, etc.), alternative techniques not using ionising radiation (if 
there are any) should be offered to the patient. Before the use of 177Lu-labelled medicinal products, 
pregnancy should be excluded using an adequate/validated test. As a result, developmental toxicity including 
reproductive toxicity is included as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
Before administering radiopharmaceuticals to a mother who is breastfeeding, consideration should be given 
to the possibility of delaying the administration of radionuclide until the mother has ceased breastfeeding, 
and to what is the most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceuticals, bearing in mind the secretion of activity 
in breast milk. If the administration is considered necessary, breastfeeding should be interrupted and the 
expressed feeds discarded. 
According to literature reports and taking a conservative approach (maximum patient dose of 10 GBq, 
average labeling yield and no additional measures), it may be considered that 177Lu-labelled medicinal 
products do not lead to reproductive toxicity including spermatogenetic damage in male testes or genetic 
damage in male testes or female ovaries. 
Effects on ability to drive and to use machines following treatment by Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal 
products will be specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product 
to be radiolabelled. 
The presence of free Lutetium (177Lu) chloride in the body after an inadvertent administration of 
EndolucinBeta will lead to increased bone marrow toxicity and haematopoietic stem cell damage. Therefore, 
in case of an inadvertent administration of EndolucinBeta, the radiotoxicity for the patient must be reduced 
by immediate (i. e. within 1 hour) administration of preparations containing chelators like Ca-DTPA or Ca-
EDTA in order to increase the elimination of the radionuclide from the body. 
The following preparations must be available in medical institutions, which use EndolucinBeta for labelling of 
carrier molecules for therapeutic purposes: 
- Ca-DTPA (Trisodium calcium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) or 
- Ca-EDTA (Calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate) 
These chelating agents help with the elimination of Lutetium (177Lu) radiotoxicity by an exchange between 
the calcium ion in the complex and the Lutetium (177Lu) ion. Due to the capacity of the chelating ligands 
(DTPA, EDTA) of forming water soluble complexes, the complexes and bound Lutetium (177Lu) are rapidly 
eliminated by the kidneys. 
1 g of the chelating agents should be administered by slow intravenous injection over 3 – 4 minutes or by 
infusion (1 g in 100 – 250 mL of glucose, or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404078/2016 
Page 44/58 
  
  
 
 
 
The chelating efficacy is greatest immediately or within one hour of exposure when the radionuclide is 
circulating in or available to tissue fluids and plasma. However, a post-exposure interval > 1 hour does not 
preclude the administration and effective action of chelator with reduced efficiency. Intravenous 
administration should not be protracted over more than 2 hours. 
In any case, the blood parameters of the patient have to be monitored and the appropriate actions 
immediately taken if there is evidence of radiotoxicity. 
The toxicity of free Lutetium (177Lu) due to in-vivo release from the labelled biomolecule in the body during 
therapy could be reduced by post-administration of chelating agents. 
Radiolabelling of medicinal products, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides, vitamins or other substrates, 
with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride is very sensitive to the presence of trace metal impurities. 
It is important that all glassware, syringe needles etc., used for the preparation of the radiolabelled medicinal 
product are thoroughly cleaned to ensure freedom from such trace metal impurities. Only syringe needles 
(for example, non-metallic) with proven resistance to dilute acid should be used to minimise trace metal 
impurity levels. 
In the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with medicinal products 
other than the medicinal products to be radiolabelled. 
Radiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in designated 
clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations and/or 
appropriate licences of the competent official organisation. 
Radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and 
pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken. 
For instructions on extemporary preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12. 
If at any time in the preparation of this product the integrity of this container is compromised it should not be 
used. 
Administration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the medicinal 
product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory. 
The surface dose rates and the accumulated dose depend on many factors. Measurements on the location 
and during work are critical and should be practiced for more precise and instructive determination of overall 
radiation dose to the staff. Healthcare personnel are advised to limit the time of close contact with patients 
injected with Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled radiopharmaceuticals. The use of television monitor systems to 
monitor the patients is recommended. Given the long half-life of Lutetium (177Lu), it is specially 
recommended to avoid internal contamination. For this reason it is mandatory to use protective high quality 
(latex/nitrile) gloves in any direct contact with the radiopharmaceutical (vial/syringe) and with the patient. 
For minimising radiation exposure resulting from repeated exposition there is no recommendation except the 
strict observance of the above ones.  
The administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or 
contamination from spill of urine, vomiting, etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with national 
regulations must therefore be taken. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404078/2016

Any unused medicinal product or waste material must be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 
Before use, packaging and radioactivity should be checked. Activity may be measured using an ionisation 
chamber. Medication errors associated with preparation and procedures has been included as an important 
potential risk in the RMP. 
Lutetium (177Lu) is a beta(-)/gamma emitter. Activity measurements using an ionization chamber are very 
sensitive to geometric factors and therefore should be performed only under geometric conditions which have 
been appropriately validated. 
Usual precautions regarding sterility and radioactivity should be respected. 
Withdrawals should be performed under aseptic conditions. The vials must not be opened before disinfecting 
the stopper, the solution should be withdrawn via the stopper using a single dose syringe fitted with suitable 
protective shielding and a disposable sterile needle or using an authorised automated application system. 
If the integrity of this vial is compromised, the product should not be used. 
The complexing agent and other reagents should be added to the vial with Lutetium (177Lu)chloride. Free 
Lutetium (177Lu) is taken up and accumulates in the bones. This could potentially result in osteosarcomas. It 
is recommended to add a binding agent such as DTPA prior to intravenous administration of Lutetium (177Lu)-
labelled conjugates in order to form a complex with free Lutetium (177Lu), if present, leading to a rapid renal 
clearance of Lutetium (177Lu). 
Adequate quality control of the radiochemical purity of ready to use radiopharmaceuticals gained after 
radiolabelling with EndolucinBeta should be assured. Limits for radiochemical impurities should be set 
recognising the radiotoxicological potential of Lutetium-177. Free non-bound Lutetium-177 should be 
consequently minimised. 
There is a contraindication for hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1. and established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 
4.6). For information on contraindications to particular Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared 
by radiolabelling with EndolucinBeta, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the 
particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety of EndolucinBeta can be considered as those relating to the radioactivity of the product and those 
related to free lutetium. As EndolucinBeta is intended to be administered labelled to a carrier molecule, the 
safety and extent of exposure will be dependent on the carrier molecule. For the purpose of an application for 
a radiopharmaceutical for radiolabelling, the safety of EndolucinBeta has been adequately addressed.

Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
The QRD Group accepted to omit the pharmaceutical form as well as the statement “For administration after 
in vitro radiolabelling” from the vial label based on space constraints. This decision was based on the fact that 
the vial is only to be removed from the lead pot (these particulars appear on the lead pot label) right before 
administration. 
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included in the 
Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, and translated in all languages but will appear in grey-
shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.

2.9.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, EndolucinBeta (lutetium (177Lu) chloride) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was 
not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
EndolucinBeta  is  a  radio-pharmaceutical  precursor  intended  solely  for  radio-labelling  purposes  with  other 
medicinal products such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates for radio-nuclide therapy. As 
a precursor, EndolucinBeta is not intended to be given directly to patients.  
A review of the literature was performed in order to document the clinical utility of 177Lu. The clinical utility of 
177Lu has been demonstrated in the management of patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine 
tumours (GEP-NET).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
None. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
There are no major safety concerns with regards to free 177Lu as the doses of EndolucinBeta administered are 
expected to be very low and are unlikely to be associated with toxicity. 177Lu has a relatively short half-life of 
6.647 days. Moreover, and as for all radioactive products, unfavourable effects relating to the radioactivity 
would be expected. These include carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and effects on different tissues. For 177Lu, 
the accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical in bone has been evidenced in non-clinical studies. However, the 
risk has been addressed in the SmPC with the recommended use of the chelator DTPA to minimise the risk of 
free 177Lu. Radiotoxicity would also be dependent on the radiation characteristics of 177Lu in EndolucinBeta as 
well as on the carrier molecule to which EndolucinBeta is labelled. 177Lu-DOTATOC and 177Lu-DOTATATE are 
well tolerated in PRRT with low risk of toxicity, if adequate kidney protective measures are applied and dose 
limits are respected. The dose-limiting organs are usually the kidneys or the bone marrow. 
In addition to radiation exposure to the patient, the risk of radiation exposure to other individuals is also a 
risk, considering the emission of gamma and β particles from 177Lu. Exposure to ionising radiation must be 
justified on the basis of likely clinical benefit. However, the radiation safety of EndolucinBeta in its use as 
radiopharmaceutical precursor has been adequately addressed in the product information. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404078/2016 
Page 50/58 
  
  
 
 
 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Toxicity  of  free  177Lu  due  to  in-vivo  release  from  the  labelled  biomolecule  in  the  body  during  therapy  could 
occur. 177Lu has a long half-life in particular in tissues like bone and liver and accumulation in these organs is 
likely. As 177Lu is intended to be a radiolabel, the pharmacokinetics is dependent on the pharmacokinetics of 
the  carrier  molecule.  The  radiation  effect  of  accumulation  in  these  organs  is  not  known  although  this  effect 
would also be dependent on the carrier molecule. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
No clinical studies have been performed as benefit and efficacy will be determined by the safety and efficacy 
of the compounds with the carrier molecules (peptides, antibodies) which have been specifically developed 
and authorised for radiolabelling with this radionuclide. Clinical utility of 177Lu in particular in neuroendocrine 
tumours has been demonstrated. As a radiopharmaceutical precursor, claims of clinical benefit should be the 
subject of assessment of an application for a radiopharmaceutical labelled with 177Lu.  
The risk of radiation to patients and to others is not unlike with other radionuclides and is dependent on the 
pharmacokinetics of the carrier molecule and necessary precautions with using radiopharmaceuticals would 
be expected when using any carrier molecule labelled with 177Lu. For individual radiopharmaceuticals labelled 
with 177Lu, the exposure to radiation, including any radiation effect of accumulation, should be justified by the 
expected clinical benefit. This should be the subject of assessment in any applications for these medicinal 
products.   
Benefit-risk balance 
The clinical utility of EndolucinBeta in the diagnosis and treatment of certain tumours has been 
demonstrated.  The risk associated with radiation is as expected with other radionuclides and information on 
minimising this risk has been provided in the RMP and the product information. There are no unresolved 
issues, which would have a negative impact on the benefit/risk balance of the product.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
EndolucinBeta is a radiopharmaceutical precursor and is not intended to be administered on its own to 
patients. As a result, the benefits and risks of the intended administration of 177Lu will be assessed 
independently when it is added to a carrier molecule. For the purpose of an application for a 
radiopharmaceutical for radiolabelling, the clinical utility and the safety of EndolucinBeta has been adequately 
addressed. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of EndolucinBeta as a radiopharmaceutical precursor, not intended for direct use in 
patients, and to be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, which have been specifically 
developed and authorised for radiolabelling with this radionuclide is favourable and therefore recommends

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of data on the quality, non-clinical and clinical properties of the active substance, 
the CHMP considers that 177Lu (EndolucinBeta) is not qualified as a new active substance as it does not differ 
significantly in properties with regard to safety and efficacy from the previously authorised substance.

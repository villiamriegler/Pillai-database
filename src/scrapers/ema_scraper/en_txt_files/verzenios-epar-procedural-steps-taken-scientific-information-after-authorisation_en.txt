MONARCH 2 showed a statistically significant improvement 
in patients receiving Verzenios plus fulvestrant compared 
with those receiving placebo plus fulvestrant. The median 
OS was 46.7 months in the Verzenios plus fulvestrant arm 
versus 37.3 months in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm 
(HR=0.757 (95% CI (0.606, 0.945), p-value=0.0137). 
Analyses for OS by stratification factors showed OS HR of 
0.675 (95 % CI: 0.511, 0.891) in patients with visceral 
disease, and 0.686 (95 % CI: 0.451, 1.043) in patients 
with primary endocrine resistance.

Moreover, the recommendation for use of an additional

removed, as women treated with abemaciclib for breast 
cancer should not be using exogenous oestrogen and 
progestins.

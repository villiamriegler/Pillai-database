Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Lojuxta in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy,

the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
and PL 
Lojuxta in the approved indication remains favourable, but 
recommended that one additional five-year renewal be 
required based on the following pharmacovigilance 
grounds: 
- 
Lojuxta was granted a Marketing Authorisation 
under exceptional circumstances and the MAH committed 
to complete a number of post-approval commitments 
within agreed timeframes. One specific obligation is still 
Page 8/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pending, due to the fact that two registries (LOWER and 
PER) are still ongoing, which will generate further clinical 
(safety and effectiveness) data. 
- 
Further, considering the safety profile of Lojuxta, 
the MAH was requested to continue to submit yearly PSURs 
unless otherwise specified.

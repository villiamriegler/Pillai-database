2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant is seeking a conditional marketing approval (CMA) for the medicinal product Lumykras 
(sotorasib) with the following clinical indication: as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients 
with previously treated KRAS G12C mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer covering approximately 84% of all lung cancers. In 
2020, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death with over 257 000 deaths across the European 
Union (EU) (JRC, 2020). NSCLC is the most frequent lung cancer subtype and patients with advanced 
NSCLC (stage IIIB and IV) have a low 5-year survival rate of 5.2% (SEER, 2019). Advanced NSCLC is 
defined to include tumours ≥4 cm, T3 or T4 tumours (based on the American Joint Committee on 
Cancer, 6th edition), and/or tumours that received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but also other criteria 
have been presented.  
KRAS mutations are the most frequent gain-of-function alterations in patients with advanced NSCLC 
being more common in the lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) and Caucasians. Altogether, KRAS mutations 
occur in 20–40% of lung adenocarcinomas and approximately 42% of the KRAS related lung cancers 
harbour G12C mutation with only 10% of NSCLC in the Asian patients harbouring this mutation. The 
estimated incidence of KRAS mutations is up to 25–35% in smokers (Dearden et al, Ann Oncol 24, 
2013) with KRAS p.G12C found more often among the former or current smokers (Dogan S et al, Clin 
Cancer Res 18, 2012), while the other KRAS mutation subtypes p.G12D and p.G12A are met more 
often in non-smokers (Dogan S et al, Clin Cancer Res 18, 2012; Riely GJ et al, Clin Cancer Res 14, 
2008). The smokers have also been reported to have more often complex KRAS-mutant tumours, 
higher mutational burden, and higher frequency of major co-occurring mutations in TP53 or STK11. 
The age, gender, or the duration of smoking is not associated with KRAS mutation incidence (Riely GJ 
et al, Clin Cancer Res 14, 2008). KRAS mutations are ethnicity driven, since they are found in only 
10% of Asian patients. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The RAS family of proto-oncogenes consists of 3 closely related genes that encode guanosine 
triphosphatases (GTPases) responsible for regulating cellular proliferation and survival (Simanshu DK 
et al, Cell 2017; Barbacid M, Annual rev Biochem 1987). Different tumour types are associated with 
mutations in certain isoforms of RAS, with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) being 
the most frequently mutated isoform in most cancers (Prior IA et al, Cancer Res 2012). 
Of the KRAS mutations, an estimated 80% occur at codon 12. The KRAS p.G12C structural change 
results in a defect in the association of guanosine triphosphatase-activating proteins (GAPs), thereby 
reducing the hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by the KRAS protein. The resulting 
accumulation of active, GTP-bound KRAS leads to proliferative and survival signalling in tumour cells 
(Jones RP et al, Br J Cancer 2017). 
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021  
Page 10/147 
 
 
 
 
Of the KRAS-related lung cancers approximately 42% are related to G12C mutation, while the 
proportion of other KRAS mutations G12V, G12D, G12A and other G12 and G13 mutations is 21%, 
17%, 10% and 12% of cases, respectively (Dogan S et al. Clin Cancer Res 2012). The KRAS mutation 
rate is estimated to be 10- to 100-fold that of EGFR-mutated or KRAS wild-type tumours having high 
correlation with the STK11 and P53 mutations (Dogan S et al, Clin Cancer Res 2012 and Imielinski M et 
al, Cell 2012). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
NSCLC patients who are positive for KRAS mutations are typically white and have a history of cigarette 
smoking. Age, gender, or the number of pack-years are not associated with KRAS mutation incidence. 
Higher proportions of women, former or current smokers, and non-squamous cell carcinoma histology 
are observed in the patients with KRAS p.G12C-mutated advanced NSCLC. (Sattler et al., 2021) 
For patients with lung cancer, the most significant symptoms affecting their daily lives have been 
identified as fatigue, shortness of breath, and chronic pain. Other symptoms include insomnia, anxiety, 
and depression (US FDA, 2013, Liao et al, 2011; Tishelman et al, 2007; Tishelman et al, 2005; Cooley 
et al, 2003; Study 20200090). 
The literature is not conclusive about the prognostic of patients with KRAS-mutated NSCLC, including 
KRAS p.G12C-mutated NSCLC. Some studies reported no prognostic difference with the overall patient 
with advanced NSCLC (Sattler et al., 2020) whereas in others KRAS mutations have been considered 
to be associated with poorer prognosis and have been estimated to lead to a 30% relative mortality 
over-risk (Mascaux C et al, Br J Cancer 2005 and Meng D et al, Lung Cancer 2013). Furthermore, 
types of mutated codons seem to have a prognostic value with codon 12 mutations appearing to be a 
more potent oncogenic driver compared to the codon 13 mutations with a higher level of resistance to 
apoptosis and a predisposition to anchorage-independent growth (Guerrero S et al, Cancer Res. 2000). 
KRAS mutations have also been assumed to present a negative predictive role of responsiveness and 
to chemotherapy (Macerelli M et al, Lung Cancer 2014). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Treatment patterns were generally similar among patients with KRAS p.G12C-mutated advanced 
NSCLC and the overall group of patients with advanced NSCLC. Platinum-based chemotherapy 
regimens and regimens including checkpoint inhibitors were the most common regimens in the first- 
and second-lines of therapy after diagnosis of advanced disease. 
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and European Society for Medical Oncology 
(ESMO) treatment guidelines call for testing of all patients with NSCLC for oncogenic driver mutations 
(Ettinger et al, 2019; Planchard et al, 2018). However, KRAS mutations are qualified as an 
undruggable target and no anticancer therapies are currently approved in the EU for the treatment of 
patients with NSCLC that specifically target tumours that have the KRAS p.G12C mutation (Román et 
al, 2018; McCormick, 2016). Further, oncogenic KRAS mutations rarely occur concomitantly with these 
other actionable oncogenic mutations (Studies 20200097, 20180277, and 20190344; Scheffler et al, 
2019; Martorell et al, 2017; Gainor et al, 2013). Thus, most patients with oncogenic KRAS mutations, 
including the KRAS p.G12C mutation, are not candidates for currently approved targeted therapies and 
consequently are typically treated as patients without targetable mutations (i.e. with chemotherapy, 
immunotherapy, or antiangiogenic agents) (Planchard et al, 2018; Van Cutsem et al, 2014). 
In first-line therapy, patients with NSCLC without actionable oncogenic driver mutations are typically 
treated with checkpoint inhibitors with or without platinum-containing doublets chemotherapy such as 
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021  
Page 11/147 
 
 
 
 
cisplatin/pemetrexed. Patients requiring subsequent second-line or later therapy are commonly treated 
with taxane chemotherapy with or without a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor or 
checkpoint inhibitors/platinum-containing doublet chemotherapy (if not already given in first line). 
Standard-of-care outcomes for patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC (who are not candidates for 
currently approved targeted therapy) in ≥ second-line therapies, who had received first-line platinum-
containing chemotherapy doublets (typically cisplatin/pemetrexed), have demonstrated objective 
response rates (ORRs; objective response = complete response + partial response) between 5.5% to 
13% with chemotherapy (typically a taxane) and between 9.7% to 22.5% with chemotherapy plus a 
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor (Gridelli et al, 2018; Rittmeyer et al, 
2017; Herbst et al, 2016; Borghaei et al, 2015; Herbst et al, 2007). These studies have also 
demonstrated progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of 2.8 to 4.2 months and 6 to 
11.4 months, respectively, for chemotherapy alone and 4.8 to 5.4 months and 9.9 to 12.6 months, 
respectively, for chemotherapy with a VEGFR inhibitor. The treatment intent in 2nd line therapy is 
usually aimed to prolong life and alleviate symptoms caused by the advanced cancer. Second line 
therapy does not usually lead to permanent cure. 
It has been debated in the literature whether the presence or absence of a KRAS mutation or the type 
of KRAS substitution, codon type or the presence of MASI has a differential benefit from adjuvant 
chemotherapy (Villaruz LC et al, Cancer 2013, Camps C et al, Lung Cancer 2011, Kalikaki A et al, Lung 
Cancer 2010). In these publications no significant difference were observed. However, the data from 
the French National Cancer Institute indicate that patients with KRAS-mutated NSCLC show a lower 
proportion of responses to cytotoxic chemotherapy and decreased survival compared with the overall 
population of patients with NSCLC (Barlesi et al, 2016), and this finding has been supported by other 
data indicating that patients with KRAS-mutated NSCLC have a poor prognosis (Wiesweg et al, 2019; 
Park et al, 2017; Hames et al, 2016; Svaton et al, 2016; Johnson et al, 2013). Similar findings were 
reported in Chinese patients, with a shorter median OS observed in patients with the KRAS p.G12C 
mutation compared with patients with wildtype tumours (Liu et al, 2020). The evaluation of patients 
with KRAS p.G12C-mutated NSCLC in Western populations showed that OS was similar with patients 
with other KRAS mutations (Arbour et al, 2020; Cui et al, 2020a; Cui et al, 2020b) and Japanese 
patients with the KRAS p.G12C or p.G12V mutation had a longer median PFS compared with patients 
with other KRAS mutations (Tamiya et al, 2020). 
2.2.  About the product 
Sotorasib is a selective KRASG12C (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) inhibitor, which 
blocks tumour cell signalling and survival, inhibits cell growth, and promotes apoptosis selectively in 
tumours harbouring KRASG12C, an oncogenic driver of tumorigenesis across multiple cancer types. 
Sotorasib is bound both to the P2 pocket and the His95 surface groove, locking the protein in an 
inactive state that prevents downstream signalling. Sotorasib also enhance antigen presentation and 
inflammatory cytokine production and induce anti-tumour inflammatory responses. 
The CHMP considers the following indication approvable: 
Lumykras as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS G12C mutation and who have progressed after at least one prior line of 
systemic therapy. 
The recommended dose is 960 mg sotorasib (eight 120 mg tablets) once daily, at the same time each 
day. 
Duration of treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021

Treatment with Lumykras is recommended until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Missed doses or vomiting 
If less than 6 hours have passed since the scheduled time of dosing, the patient should take the dose 
as normal. If more than 6 hours have passed since the scheduled time of dosing, the patient must not 
take the dose. Treatment should be continued as prescribed the next day. 
If vomiting occurs after taking Lumykras, the patient must not take an additional dose on the same 
day, and treatment must be continued as prescribed the next day. 
Dose modifications 
Dosing should be modified based on Lumykras toxicity. The dose reduction rules outlined in section 4.2 
are based on clinical data. Pharmacokinetic data do suggest a similar exposure at lower sotorasib 
doses. Dose reduction levels are summarised in table 1. Dose modifications for adverse reactions are 
provided in table 2. 
If toxicity events occur, a maximum of two dose reductions are permitted. Lumykras must be 
discontinued if patients are unable to tolerate the minimum dose of 240 mg once daily.

Lumykras is for oral use. The tablets must be swallowed whole. There are no data to support the 
administration of Lumykras if the tablets are chewed, crushed, or split but the tablets can be dispersed 
in water (see below). The tablets can be taken with or without food. 
Administration to patients who have difficulty swallowing solids 
Patients should disperse tablets in 120 mL of non-carbonated, room-temperature water, without 
crushing them. Other liquids must not be used. Patients should stir until tablets are dispersed into 
small pieces (the tablet will not dissolve completely) and drink immediately. The appearance of the 
mixture may range from pale to bright yellow. The container must be rinsed with an additional 120 mL 
of water, which should be drunk immediately. If it is not drunk immediately, patients must stir again to 
ensure that the tablets are dispersed. The dispersion must be discarded if it is not drunk within 
2 hours. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a conditional marketing authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
The applicant considers that the benefit risk is positive based on: 
Efficacy: ORR of 37.4 (95 CI: 28.8, 46.6), which was durable, with a median (95 CI) DOR of 8.4 
(6.9,  8.4)  months.  The  applicant  considers  that  the  ORR,  exceeding  the  pre-specified  benchmark  for 
Study  20170543,  which  was  based  on  the  ORR  observed  for  the  pivotal  study  with  ramucirumab 
combined with docetaxel, demonstrates the clinical benefit of Lumykras treatment. 
Safety: Sotorasib was generally safe and well tolerated, based on the evidence currently available from 
the total safety population enrolled in clinical trials. It is considered that the risks associated with 
sotorasib can be managed through routine pharmacovigilance and risk communication through the 
proposed prescribing information, labelling, and packaging. 
• 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
The proposed confirmatory trial is an ongoing Phase 3 study (Study 20190009; CodeBreaK 200, 
N=approximately 330), 2-arms, randomised, open-label trial of the safety and efficacy of sotorasib 
monotherapy administered at 960 mg QD daily and docetaxel administered at dose of 75 mg/m2 over 1 
hour every 3 weeks for a treatment cycle of 21 days for subjects with previously treated advanced 
NSCLC with the KRAS p.G12C mutation. The first patient was enrolled in the 4th of June 2020 and the 
enrolment is expected to be complete in Q4 2021. Primary PFS analysis and interim OS analysis (67% 
of events) is anticipated in Q1/early Q2 2022.Several immunotherapies and pemetrexed chemotherapy 
have been approved recently. The efficacy and safety of these novel therapeutic agents in the current 
subset of patients is not yet well-known. Therefore, the applicant claims that docetaxel represents a 
reasonable and valid alternative for the comparator in Phase 3 trial representing Standard of Care 
(SOC) in the second line treatment after the first line therapies, such as platinum doublet and 
checkpoint inhibitor with or without platinum-containing doublets chemotherapy, have been given. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as: 
No inhibitors specifically targeting KRAS p.G12C mutations have been successfully developed until 
recently. The applicant claims that oncogenic KRAS mutations, including the KRAS p.G12C mutation, 
rarely occur concomitantly with other actionable mutations. In studies 20180277 and 20200097, EGFR 
mutations were observed in 0.2 - 1.2% of patients, ROS1 mutations in 0.2 - 0.3%, and BRAF mutations 
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021  
Page 14/147 
 
 
 
 
in 0.9-1.0%, and no ALK alterations were reported. A low number of subjects enrolled in phase 2 of 
Study 20170543 had co-mutations (10.3% of subjects for TP53, 5.6% for serine/threonine kinase 
11(STK11), 2.4% for EGFR, and 1.6% all other co-mutations; no subjects had co-mutations in ALK or 
ROS. Most patients with oncogenic KRAS mutations, including the KRAS p.G12C mutation, are thus not 
candidates for currently approved targeted therapies and consequently are typically treated as patients 
without targetable mutations (i.e., with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or antiangiogenic agents). The 
applicant has provided an overview of available treatment options for patients with previously treated 
KRAS p.G12C mutated advanced NSCLC, including afatinib, docetaxel, erlotinib, nintedanib/docetaxel, 
pemetrexed, ramucirumab/docetaxel; and for patients not previously treated with the check-point 
inhibitors, atezolizumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab. The ORR in the provided studies varies 
between 4.7-20%, with highest response rate reported for ramucirumab/docetaxel (22.9%). 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required.  
The durable ORR observed could be expected to translate to a favourable OS for treated patient when 
compared to current available treatments for patients with previously-treated KRAS p.G12C-mutated 
locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. 
A Conditional Approval of sotorasib would make available a treatment with a potential major therapeutic 
advantage versus currently available therapies, with compelling evidence of anti-tumour activity and a 
tolerable safety profile. Sotorasib would otherwise not be available to patients until comprehensive data 
are available, anticipated to be Q1/Q2 2022. The applicant claims that the current treatment would offer 
an additional option after treatment attempts with other therapies have been failed. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablet containing 120 mg of sotorasib. 
Other ingredients are: microcrystalline cellulose, (E460(i)), lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose 
sodium (E468), magnesium stearate (E470b). Components of the film-coating agent are: polyvinyl 
alcohol (E1203), titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol 4000 (E1521), talc (E553b) and iron oxide yellow 
(E172).  
The product is available in PVC/PE/PVDC blisters with aluminium foil backing or in HDPE bottle with a 
child-resistant polypropylene cap and aluminium foil induction seal liner, as described in section 6.5 of 
the SmPC.  
2.4.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of sotorasib is 6-fluoro-7-(2-fluoro-6-hydroxyphenyl)-(1M)-1-[4-methyl-2-(propan-
2-yl)pyridin-3-yl]-4-[(2S)-2-methyl-4-(prop-2-enoyl)piperazin-1-yl]pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2(1H)-one 
corresponding to the molecular formula C30H30F2N6O3. It has a relative molecular mass of 560.6 and 
the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021

Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of sotorasib was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, NMR 
analysis (1H, 13C, 15N, and 19F NMR), mass spectroscopy, absorption ultraviolet/visible, infrared 
spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction. The solid-state properties of the active substance 
were measured by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), 
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and dynamic vapor sorption (DVS). 
Sotorasib is a white to off-white to yellow to light brown powder. Sotorasib is slightly hygroscopic. The 
solubility of sotorasib is highest at pH 1.2, very slightly soluble at pH 3.6 and practically insoluble over 
a pH range of 4.6 to 6.8. Given its low solubility and high permeability, sotorasib is classified as a BCS 
Class 2.  
Sotorasib exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of two chiral centres. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled at the level of the starting materials and active substance specification (by chiral HPLC).  
Polymorphism has been observed for sotorasib. Sixteen crystalline forms, including 3 anhydrous forms 
and 13 solvate forms, have been discovered to date. Based on crystal form screening and 
characterisation studies, sotorasib anhydrous free base Form I, the desired form for this MAA, was 
determined experimentally to be the most thermodynamically stable form.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Sotorasib is synthesised in five main chemical steps; the synthesis uses commercially available well-
defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised.  
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development programme. The types of bond connections and order of reaction steps have 
remained unchanged over the course of development. Process development changes have consisted of 
changes to solvents, reagents, processing conditions, and starting materials. Similar impurity profiles 
are observed for batches produced using the previous and the current commercial processes. Changes 
introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. 
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. Additionally, it is has been shown 
that one form has been consistently produced throughout the development of the manufacturing 
process of the active substance. 
The active substance is packaged in double low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags, closed with a cable 
tie, the LDPE bags comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended.

Specification 
The active substance release and stability specification includes tests for description, identification 
(FTIR), enantiomer identification (HPLC/RT), assay (HPLC), organic impurities (HPLC), chiral impurities 
(HPLC), residual solvents (GC), residue on ignition (ph. Eur.), elemental impurities (ICP-MS, Ph. Eur.), 
trifluoroacetic acid (IC) and particle size distribution (laser diffraction measurement, Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities above the qualification threshold of ICH Q3A have been qualified at the established levels 
using data from preclinical safety studies. With regards to mutagenic impurities, a hybrid ICH S9/ICH 
M7 approach has been applied. Since ICH M7(R1) guideline does not apply to active substances and 
finished products intended for advanced cancer indications, this is accepted as it is more restrictive 
than the requirements. Only the solvents used in the last steps of the commercial process are routinely 
controlled in line with ICH Q3C (option 1). 
A test for particle size (PSD) was added in the active substance specification during the procedure The 
whole control strategy for the polymorphic form is considered adequate. The analytical methods used 
have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data (7 commercial scale batches) of the active substance, per active substance 
manufacturer, are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to 
batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from six commercial batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers 
stored in in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market for up to 18 
months under long term conditions (30ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: assay (HPLC), organic impurities (HPLC), chiral impurities 
(HPLC), water content (Karl fisher, Ph. Eur.), and visual appearance. The analytical methods used were 
the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. No trend of degradation is observed. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch of the active 
substance. Sotorasib as solid state is susceptible to colour change under stressed 3 x ICH light 
conditions. However, no change in purity, assay, mass balance, or peak purity was observed under 
these conditions. 
Results on stress conditions (hydrolytic, oxidative, thermal) were also provided on one batch of the active 
substance.  All  stressed  samples  were  evaluated  for changes  in  physical  appearance,  impurity  profile, 
assay, mass balance, and sotorasib peak purity in comparison with the unstressed controls. Sotorasib in 
solution  exhibits  significant  degradation  when  exposed  to  hydrolysis  (acidic  and  basic)  and  oxidative 
degradation. The main degradation product observed is 3368167 (DS Dione). Sotorasib as solid state is 
not degraded under heat and humidity. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months when stored 
below 30°C, protected from light, in the proposed container.

2.4.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is an immediate-release film-coated tablet containing 120 mg of sotorasib. 
The dosage form is a yellow oblong (7 mm × 16 mm) tablet debossed with “AMG” on one side and 
“120” on the opposite side. 
The composition of the finished product is presented.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards, with the exception of iron oxide yellow, which complies with NF and JPE, this is acceptable. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included 
in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The dosage form has been developed for the adult population. The recommended daily dose is 960 mg 
sotorasib (eight 120 mg tablets) once daily; the dose is reduced on an individual basis, down to 240 
mg once daily (two 120 mg tablets), based on the toxicity experienced by the patient. The 
administration of eight concomitant tablets is not ideal; the applicant is recommended to develop a 
presentation with higher drug load to allow for fewer tablets per dose. For patients having difficulty to 
swallow, an alternative method of administration by dispersing the tablets in water is proposed. 
Additionally, the applicant is recommended to conduct a feasibility study of sotorasib 120 mg film-
coated tablets administration through an enteral feeding tube for adult patients within 6 months of 
approval of the MAA. In consideration of the therapeutic indication, and given the possible alternative 
administration method, the formulation is considered acceptable. 
Development studies support the PI information regarding dispersion of tablets. Only water should be 
used as dispersion medium, as the active substance degrades in acidic conditions, hence fruit juices 
are not suitable. Since the PI stated that ‘..tablets are in small pieces (the tablet will not completely 
dissolve)’ the Ph. Eur. requirement for fineness of the dispersion can be waived for this immediate 
release pharmaceutical form. Stability data support the two-hour in-use period, as proposed in the 
SmPC, of the dispersed tablets.  
Uncoated tablets were used in Phase 1 and early Phase 2 studies. During Phase 2, the proposed 
commercial film-coated tablet was introduced to support on-going Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies. 
The same core tablet formulation has been used throughout clinical trials. The core tablets were 
manufactured using the same dry granulation by roller compaction. The formulation used during the 
pivotal clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing.  
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. In addition to 
traditional manufacturing process optimisation, consisting of univariate experiments (initial blending, 
roller compaction, final blending/lubrication, compression) and scale-up studies, the formulation and 
manufacturing development have been evaluated through the use of the use of risk assessment design 
of experiments (DoE) to identify the critical product quality attributes and critical process parameters. 
In one DoE study the effect of the active substance particle size and the amount of the excipients 
croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, and magnesium stearate 
(extra-granular) on manufacturing process and on the finished product characteristics was evaluated. 
The amount of excipients in the formulation was optimised. Different particle sizes lead to different 
dissolutions profiles of the finished product. The particle size distribution impact on PK values (i.e., 
Cmax and AUC) was further assessed using GastroPlus software, which indicated that the differences in 
dissolution observed for the batches manufactured with large particle size may not be significant in 
vivo. However, considering the low solubility of the active substance, a specification limit for active

substance PSD, in line with particle size tested clinically, has been added to the active substance 
specification.   
In a second DoE the spray rates and exhaust temperatures of the final coating were evaluated; all 
batches had acceptable coating quality. Supplementary information has been provided during the 
procedure regarding the polymorphism of the active substance in the finished product, which further 
confirms the consistency, stability and adequate monitoring of polymorph I.   
The critical process parameters have been adequately identified. The manufacturing process mainly 
includes target values for process parameters, with limited ranges corresponding to not more than 
normal variability; based on this process characterisation studies are considered sufficient and they 
adequately support the commercial manufacturing process operating conditions. 
The QC dissolution conditions are considered acceptable. During the procedure a major objection (MO) 
was raised on the dissolution method conditions and specifications. The level of surfactant (0.2 %) has 
been thoroughly justified to address the MO: SDS levels below 0.2%, i.e. 0.1% and 0.15%, have been 
tested but were shown to be not sufficient to provide complete release in a reasonable timeframe. 
Solubility data in SDS 0.15% indicate that sink conditions are not met at this concentration in pH 6.8 
buffer.  
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated by investigating tablets 
manufactured with active substance having a particle size outside the specification limits and with 
tablets subjected to humidity stress. Additionally, in order to provide greater discriminatory capacity, 
dissolution specification has been revised as requested as part of the MO raised on the dissolution 
method. The QC sampling point has been tightened from 30 minutes to 15 minutes with Q = 80%.  
The primary packaging is PVC/PE/PVDC blisters with aluminium foil backing or HDPE bottle with a child-
resistant polypropylene cap and aluminium foil induction seal liner. The material of both presentations 
complies  with  Ph.Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. Child-resistance complies 
to ISO 8317. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Manufacturing process is adequately described. Sufficient details are provided, including equipment 
type and capacity, mesh screen sizes, and process parameters target values with normal operating 
ranges. Process robustness is supported by development data from the development to the commercial 
scale. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. Validation batches will be completed prior to 
marketing. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description,  identification  (HPLC/UV,  HPLC/RT),  assay  (HPLC),  organic  impurities  (HPLC),  content 
Uniformity (HPLC, Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), water content (Karl Fisher, Ph. Eur.) and microbial 
limits (Ph. Eur.). 
The tests and controls applied for the finished product at release and throughout shelf life are 
appropriate for the dosage form. The specifications comply with the Ph. Eur. requirements and with 
ICH guidelines. Several specification limits (assay, DS-dione, dissolution and water content) have been

tightened during the procedure and are considered acceptable. The lack of chirality test in the finished 
product specifications is supported as the risk of racemisation or epimerisation during the 
manufacturing process of the active substance and finished product is considered low, as also 
supported by batch data. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 3 
batches using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental 
impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment, and the 
presented batch data, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity 
controls. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions 
and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control 
measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. The same reference standards used in the active substance 
analysis are also used in the finished product and are considered satisfactory. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 9 pilot scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three pilot scale batches (primary stability batches) for each presentation (blister 
and bottle) and additional supportive pilot scale batches (5 for the blister and 8 for the bottle) of 
finished product stored for up to 18 months (blister presentation) and 24 months (bottle presentation) 
under long term conditions (30ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are 
identical to those proposed for marketing, were manufactured using active substance batches from 
both the active substance manufacturers and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing.  
Samples were tested for the shelf-life specification. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
No significant changes have been observed.  
In addition, 1 batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. No significant were observed. Stress stability studies (60°C / 33% 
RH and 60°C / 75% RH for up to 4 weeks) was performed on one batch of the finished product; the 
results from the stress study showed that the film-coated finished product is stable with respect to 
temperature and slightly sensitive to humidity (assay and impurity results were within the specification 
limit). Samples were also exposed to forced degradation conditions: 85°C (1 week); 85°C (2 weeks); 
85°C / 85% RH (1 week); 85°C / 85% RH (2 weeks); Light stressed (3 x ICH); 0.1 N HCl (24 Hrs.) 
neutralised; 0.1 N NaOH (2 Hrs.) neutralised; 20% H2O2 (24 hours). Through the forced degradation 
study, it was concluded that the main degradation pathways are hydrolysis and oxidation. Also, the 
Assessment report

main peak remains spectrally pure in all the stressed samples. The results indicate that the HPLC 
method is specific and stability indicating and is suitable for release and stability testing. 
Stability and stress data give no indication that the drug product is susceptible to deterioration. Each 
bottle contains 120 tablets which should cover 15 days of treatment; however, for patients with dose 
reduction, a bottle could be used up to 60 days (worst case). Based on stress studies and updated ICH 
long-term stability studies, justification that in-use stability studies do not need to be undertaken can 
be accepted. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months and no special storage 
conditions, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3), are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The MOs raised during 
the procedure on the redefinition of acryloyl chloride as starting material and on the choice of the 
conditions and acceptance criteria of the dissolution method have been adequately addressed.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to the development of a formulation with 
a higher drug load and the provision of studies to support administration through an enteral feeding 
tube for adult patients. These points are put forward and agreed as recommendations for future quality 
development. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
The applicant is recommended to: 
1)  To provide the data from a study to assess the feasibility of sotorasib 120 mg film-coated 
tablets administration through an enteral feeding tube for adult patients within six months 
from granting of the MAA.   
Assessment report

2)  To develop a higher drug load presentation to reduce the number of tablets needed for each 
single dose.   
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Sotorasib is a potent and selective covalent inhibitor of KRASG12C and is being developed for the 
treatment of patients with advanced malignancies that have the p.G12C mutation of KRAS. Sotorasib 
binds irreversibly to the P2 pocket of KRASG12C through a novel interaction with the histidine 95 
groove and a precise covalent reaction with cysteine. Binding of sotorasib locks KRASG12C in the 
inactive GDP bound conformation and prevents loading of GTP. This blocks the interaction with 
downstream effectors like RAF, thus preventing p-ERK. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In a biochemical assay (Study R20150198), sotorasib potently inhibited the activation of recombinant 
KRASG12C, but did not inhibit activation of WT KRAS. Sotorasib also potently inhibited MAPK signalling 
only in KRAS p.G12C-mutant cell lines (Study R20190078).  It also impaired viability in all but one 
p.G12C-mutant cell lines and did not affect non p.G12C cell lines (Study R20150199).   
In vivo sotorasib covalently modified KRASG12C and significantly inhibited p-ERK in human tumour 
xenografts at doses as low as 3 mg/kg (Studies R20150188 and R20190129). Sotorasib inhibition 
peaked at approximately 2 hours and persisted for at least 48 hours after a single dose. Sotorasib also 
significantly inhibited tumour growth at doses as low as 3 mg/kg and at 100 mg/kg achieved up to 
62% tumour regression (Studies R20150189, R20150190 and R20150191). Sotorasib had no effect in 
non-KRAS p.G12C tumour models and did not impact body weight in any study. In a patient-derived 
xenograft (PDX) model of KRAS p.G12C colorectal carcinoma, sotorasib inhibited p ERK and tumour 
growth in a dose-dependent manner and resulted in 45% regression at 100 mg/kg (Study 
R20190131). 
In combination studies, sotorasib displayed synergistic cell killing in vitro in multiple KRAS p.G12C cell 
lines with inhibitors of every tested node of the MAPK pathway upstream and downstream of RAS and 
with inhibitors of the AKT pathway (Studies 153397, R20180032, 153894). Significantly enhanced anti-
tumour activity was also observed in vivo with combinations of sotorasib with inhibitors of EGFR/pan-
ErbB, SHP 2, or MEK, and with carboplatin chemotherapy (Studies R20180033, 153358).   
In a syngeneic murine colorectal tumour model (CT-26) engineered to endogenously express KRAS 
p.G12C, sotorasib treatment in vitro inhibited p-ERK and viability and also enhanced MHC class I 
antigen and inflammatory cytokine expression (Canon et al, 2019).  Dosing of sotorasib in 
immunocompetent mice bearing CT-26 KRAS p.G12C tumours resulted in permanent complete 
regression of tumours in 80% of the animals (Study R20190128). Combination of sotorasib with an 
immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1) significantly enhanced anti-tumour activity at a suboptimal 
dose of sotorasib (Canon et al, 2019). Mechanistic studies revealed that sotorasib treatment induced 
an inflamed tumour microenvironment by enhancing inflammatory cytokine production and MHC class I 
expression in the tumours, which led to infiltration of anti-tumour immune cell subsets including 
proliferating effector T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages (Study R20180035). Rechallenge

experiments established that cured mice had developed an anti-tumour immune response to CT-26, 
irrespective of the KRAS mutation status (Canon et al, 2019). 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The general selectivity of sotorasib in vitro was assessed against various targets including receptors, 
enzymes, ion channels, and transporters; minimal activity was observed, suggesting sotorasib is highly 
selective for KRASG12C (Studies 124452 and 124453). In NCI-H358 cells, cysteine proteome profiling 
indicated that sotorasib engaged only the Cys12-contaning peptide from KRASG12C (Study 
R20150219; Patricelli et al, 2016).   
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
The sotorasib hERG IC50 was 54.8 µM (Study 150431); no clinically significant interaction with the 
hERG channel is expected over the proposed clinical dose range. In vivo, sotorasib at doses up to 300 
mg/kg did not result in changes to qualitative ECG, quantitative ECG, or haemodynamic parameters in 
a GLP cardiovascular safety pharmacology study in telemetered dogs (Study 150458). Likewise, there 
were no effects on ECG parameters in the 28-day dog repeat-dose toxicology study. Overall, no 
cardiovascular concerns have been identified for sotorasib (Study 150429). 
Human circulating metabolites (AMG3368167 [M24], AMG3375854 [M10], and AMG3413829 [M18]) 
were assessed for potential primary or secondary pharmacology effects and for effects on in vitro hERG 
potassium channel. Among the 3 metabolites, M18 has the same covalent warhead as sotorasib, while 
M24 and M10 lack it. Consistently, only M18 maintains primary pharmacology effects; however, the 
effect is markedly reduced when compared to sotorasib. Secondary pharmacology screenings for these 
3 metabolites did not indicate any clinically relevant or significant off-target pharmacological activities 
although M24 at 10 µM showed 61.0 and 52.3 percent inhibition, respectively, for Neurokinin NK1 and 
NK2 receptors (Study 124807). In vitro hERG assays for these metabolites did not indicate any 
clinically relevant or significant interactions (Studies 124803 and 153419).  
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have not been conducted. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and PK characteristics of sotorasib were evaluated 
in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey. The analytical methods are generally well validated according to the 
FDA guideline. The methods are sensitive, selective, accurate, and reproducible. Sotorasib is stable 
during storage, processing, and analysis. 
Sotorasib was readily absorbed after a PO dose to non-cannulated male and female rats and BDC male 
rats. The absorption of sotorasib was studied in mouse, rat, dog and monkey. Following oral 
administration, mean tmax of sotorasib ranged from approximately 0.25 to 1.2 hours in all species. 
Sotorasib exhibited low to moderate Foral in mouse, rat, and dog; approximately 35% in mouse, 30% in 
rat, and 34% in dog.  
Sotorasib biotransformation through primary glutathione conjugation was major and accounted for up 
to approximately 21% to 33% of the dose from intact male and female rats, respectively, and up to 
approximately 41% of the dose in male BDC rats. Sotorasib underwent biotransformation in dogs to 
eleven identified metabolites. The major circulating metabolite M24 was observed in all nonclinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021  
Page 23/147 
 
 
 
 
species, however the AUC of this metabolite varied between 33-391% of sotorasib AUC between 
species. The AUC of metabolite M12 (glutathione conjugate) varied from 46.9% in dogs to 37.3% of 
sotorasib AUC in monkeys.  
Sotorasib and the main metabolites have a varying plasma protein binding profile. The free fraction of 
sotorasib to mouse, rat, dog, and human plasma across the concentration range tested varied less 
than 2-fold when comparing the human value to the values found with animal plasma (with an average 
in vitro unbound fraction of approximately 0.071, 0.054, 0.21, and 0.11 in mouse, rat, dog, and 
human. The metabolite M10 showed the highest fraction unbound at 50 μM, whereas the metabolite 
M18 showed the lowest fraction unbound at 50 μM and the highest at 1 μM. 
Sotorasib exhibits moderate to high clearance, a moderate volume of distribution and a low to 
moderate bioavailability in nonclinical species. The t1/2,z of sotorasib in nonclinical species following 
intravenous administration ranged between 0.41 and 0.71 hours. Sotorasib and three of its metabolites 
(M10, M18, and M24) have moderate binding to plasma proteins and did not preferentially distribute 
into blood cells when assessed in vitro in rat, dog, and human, which indicates that plasma 
concentrations are suitable to assess exposure in human as well as rat and dog, which were the two 
nonclinical species used in repeat-dose toxicology studies.  
A whole-body distribution study in male LE or male or female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats showed that 
[14C]-Sotorasib-derived radioactivity distributed reversibly to most tissues after a single PO dose (60 
mg/kg), with Cmax occurring in most tissues at 0.5 hour postdose. Tissues with the highest sotorasib-
related radioactivity exposures common to both rat strains were liver, kidney, thyroid, pancreas, 
exorbital lacrimal gland, and the intra-orbital lacrimal gland. Elimination of sotorasib-related 
radioactivity was nearly complete for most tissues by 336 hours postdose. By the final sampling time 
of 672 hours postdose, only highly perfused tissues including blood, kidney, lung, myocardium and 
spleen had measurable concentrations of sotorasib-related radioactivity. Sotorasib was highly 
permeable in vitro (5.67 x 10-6 cm/s – 11.2 x 10-6 cm/s) across polarised Madin-Darby canine kidney 
epithelial cells (MDCKII).  Circulating metabolite M24 was also highly permeable in vitro (25.6 x 10-6 
cm/s – 27.7 x 10-6 cm/s) across polarised MDCKII cells (Study 150563). 
The metabolism of sotorasib was studied in vitro using pooled liver microsomes and hepatocytes.  
Metabolites M10, M18, and M24 were the predominant sotorasib metabolites formed using human 
hepatocytes. The in vitro sotorasib metabolites formed by pooled human liver microsomes and 
hepatocytes were also produced by pooled liver microsomes and hepatocytes from the rat and dog, the 
nonclinical species used in repeat-dose toxicology studies. No unique human metabolites of sotorasib 
were observed in vitro. All human in vitro metabolites of sotorasib were observed from in vitro 
incubations with rat and dog. 
The metabolism and excretion of [14C]-sotorasib were evaluated in non-cannulated male or female rats 
as well as in BDC male rats after a single PO dose of sotorasib (60 mg/kg).  Overall, the data indicated 
that sotorasib was readily absorbed after an PO dose to non-cannulated male and female rats and BDC 
male rats, underwent extensive biotransformation, and was eliminated primarily by non-enzymatic 
conjugation and metabolic clearance; [14C]-sotorasib-derived radioactivity was excreted primarily 
through biliary and faecal pathways. Biotransformation of sotorasib was mediated primarily by non-
enzymatic glutathione conjugation, oxidation, and to a lesser extent, reduction and dealkylation. 
Secondary sotorasib metabolism was substantive and included amide hydrolysis, cysteine-conjugate 
cleavage, N-acetylation, methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfonation. Biotransformation of sotorasib 
through primary glutathione conjugation was major and accounted for up to approximately 21 to 33 
of dose from intact male and female rats, respectively, and up to approximately 41 of dose in male 
BDC rats. Sotorasib metabolites originating from primary oxidation account for up to approximately 
20 of dose in non-cannulated rats and for approximately 10 of dose in BDC rats. Reduction of the 
Assessment report

sotorasib acrolein moiety account for up to approximately 10 of dose in non-cannulated male and 
female rats and approximately 2.7 of dose in BDC rats, whereas dealkylation at the piperazine moiety 
accounted for approximately 10 to 13 of dose in non-cannulated rats and for approximately 6 of 
dose in BDC rats.   
The metabolism and excretion of [14C]-sotorasib were evaluated in non-cannulated male and female 
dogs after a single PO (500 mg/kg) dose of sotorasib. Sotorasib accounted for 6.65% or 9.22% of total 
plasma radioactivity exposure in male and female dogs, respectively. Co-eluting sotorasib metabolites 
M10/M48 (des (methylpipe razinylpropenone [MPPO])-oxy-sotorasib dione glucuronide) and M24 
accounted for 64.4% and 21.3%, respectively, of total plasma radioactivity exposure in male dogs and 
60.2% and 20.2%, respectively, of total plasma radioactivity in female dogs. Overall, [14C]-sotorasib-
derived radioactivity was minimally absorbed and was eliminated predominantly as unchanged 
sotorasib in faeces following a single 500 mg/kg dose to male or female dogs.

Mixed plasma matrix experiments were performed to characterise circulating metabolites after multiple 
doses of sotorasib in male or female rat, dog, or humans. Overall, the data presented in the mixed 
matrix experiments indicate that sotorasib underwent oxidative N-dealkylation, glutathione 
conjugation, oxidation, and to a lesser extent, hydrogenation, lysine conjugation, and glucuronide 
conjugation, with similar circulating metabolites observed across rat, dog, and humans.   
In vitro experiments were run to characterise the enzymes or mechanisms involved with the formation 
of the sotorasib metabolites M12 (glutathione adduct) and M24 (oxidative dealkylation).  In vitro 
studies using recombinant GSTs, human liver cytosol, or human liver S9 fractions demonstrated that 
M12 formation from sotorasib is primarily non-enzymatic (Michael addition), with limited contribution 
from GST enzymes. Formation of M24 from sotorasib was predominantly catalysed by CYP3A. 
The potential for sotorasib to inhibit cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism was examined in vitro 
using HLMs. Sotorasib was shown to inhibit CYP2C8 (inhibition constant [Ki] = 25.6 M), CYP2D6 (Ki = 
Assessment report

18.2 M), and CYP3A (Ki = 4.82 M, midazolam; Ki = 17.8 M, testosterone). Sotorasib was a time-
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A with an inactivation constant (KI) of 1.92 M and kinact of 0.016 min-1.  
Sotorasib metabolite M24 was an inhibitor of CYP2B6 (Ki = 22.0 M), CYP2C8 (Ki = 10.1 M), CYP2C9 
(Ki = 4.47 M), CYP2C19 (Ki = 36.3 M), CYP2D6 (Ki = 51.9 M), and CYP3A (Ki = 14.5 M, midazolam; 
Ki = 21.2 M, testosterone).  Sotorasib metabolite M24 was a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A with a 
KI of 32.7 M and kinact of 0.010 min-1 in vitro. Sotorasib M18 was an inhibitor of CYP2C8 (IC50 = 68.11 
M), and CYP3A (IC50 = 28.40 M, midazolam; IC50 = 26.68 M, testosterone) and a time-dependent 
inhibitor of CYP3A (IC50 = 4.13 M, midazolam; IC50 = 3.48 M, testosterone) in vitro. 
The potential for sotorasib and metabolite M24 to induce human cytochrome P450 isoforms was 
assessed in vitro after treatment of human hepatocytes in primary culture with sotorasib and M24. 
Following incubation with 0.0005 to 30 M sotorasib for up to 72 hours, CYP3A4 mRNA levels increased 
by 8- to 37-fold with a mean EC50 of 1.12 M; additionally, M24 incubation with 0.0005 to 30 M for up 
to 72 hours increased CYP3A4 mRNA levels by 8- to 18-fold with a mean EC50 of 2.07 M. Sotorasib 
was also an inducer of CYP2B6 (35 to 70 of positive control), CYP2C8 (11 to 55 of positive 
control), CYP2C9 (27 to 60 of positive control) and CYP2C19 (25 to 62 of positive control). 
Sotorasib M24 was an inducer of CYP1A2 (8 to 12 of positive control), CYP2B6 (28 to 46 of 
positive control), CYP2C8 (67 to 90 of positive control), CYP2C9 (38 to 54 of positive control) 
and CYP2C19 (50 to 60 of positive control). 
The potential for sotorasib metabolites M10 and M18 to induce the expression of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 was assessed in vitro in human hepatocytes across a 
concentration range of 0.1 to 100 M (Study 153424). Sotorasib metabolite M10 showed the potential 
to induce CYP2B6 in two of the three hepatocyte donors tested, with respective EC50 and maximal fold 
induction (Emax) values of 30.4 to 34.7 M and 2.55 to 2.74-fold. Sotorasib metabolite M18 showed the 
potential to induce CYP2B6 in one donor only, with respective EC50 and Emax values of 11.1 M and 
2.25-fold. Sotorasib metabolite M10 showed the potential to induce CYP3A4 in all three hepatocyte 
donors, with respective EC50 and Emax values of 31.8 to 36.0 M and 14.1 to 36.3-fold. Sotorasib 
metabolite M18 also showed the potential to induce CYP3A4 in all three hepatocyte donors, with 
respective EC50 and Emax values of 10.4 to 14.0 M and 3.59 to 6.65-fold. Sotorasib metabolite M10 
showed the potential to induce CYP2C8 in all three hepatocyte donors, with respective EC50 and Emax 
values of 35.3 to 39.4 M and 3.15 to 4.99-fold. Sotorasib metabolite M10 showed the potential to 
induce CYP2C9 in one hepatocyte donor, with respective EC50 and Emax values of 35.1 M and 3.16-fold, 
respectively. 
In vitro, sotorasib is a P-gp substrate (net efflux ratio [ER] = 57.8  5.82); thus, active transport by 
P-gp may affect sotorasib absorption and elimination (Study 150540). Sotorasib is not a BCRP 
substrate in vitro. Sotorasib was characterised as an in vitro inhibitor of human OATP1B1 (IC50 = 29.3 
M), MATE1 (IC50 = 0.440 M), MATE2-K (IC50 = 2.39 M), and P-gp (IC50 = 60.2 M) (Study 150539). 
Incomplete inhibition curves for sotorasib (concentration-dependent loss in activity observed with 
greater than 25 activity remaining at the highest concentration tested) was observed up to the 
highest test concentration for human OAT1 (IC50 = 64.7 M), OAT3 (IC50 = 42.8 M), OCT1 (IC50 = 
58.3 M), OATP1B3 (IC50 = 54.2 M), and BCRP (IC50 = 120 M) in vitro. 
Sotorasib metabolite M24 was characterised as an in vitro inhibitor of human OAT1 (IC50 = 10.2 μM), 
OAT3 (IC50 = 5.28 μM), OATP1B1 (IC50 = 6.63 μM), OATP1B3 (IC50 = 31.8 μM), MATE1 (IC50 = 0.632 
μM), and P-gp (IC50 = 41.1 μM). Incomplete inhibition curves for sotorasib metabolite M24 
(concentration-dependent loss in activity observed with greater than 25 activity remaining at the 
highest concentration tested) were observed up to the highest test concentration for human MATE2-K 
(IC50 = 81.2 μM) and BCRP (IC50 = 72.7 μM) in vitro.

The potential for two additional metabolites of sotorasib, M10 and M18, to cause transporter-mediated 
DDI was evaluated in vitro. M10 was characterised as in vitro inhibitor of human OAT3 (IC50 = 32.6 M) 
and MATE2-K (IC50 = 18.5 M) (Study 153425). Incomplete inhibition curves for SOTORASIB 
metabolite M10 (concentration-dependent loss in activity observed with greater than 25 activity 
remaining at the highest concentration tested) were observed up to the highest test concentration for 
human MATE1 (IC50 = 46.6 M) in vitro. Sotorasib metabolite M18 was characterised as in vitro 
inhibitor of human OAT3 (IC50 = 5.86 M), OCT1 (IC50 = 12.7 M), OATP1B1 (IC50 = 11.6 M), OATP1B3 
(IC50 = 17.9 M), and MATE1 (IC50 = 7.53 M). Incomplete inhibition curves for M18 (concentration-
dependent loss in activity observed with greater than 25 activity remaining at the highest 
concentration tested) were observed up to the highest test concentration for human OAT1 
(IC50 = 76.2 M) and MATE2-K (IC50 = 21.3 M) in vitro. 
Information on observed concentrations of sotorasib from clinical studies (Cmax = 9.12 g/mL, Study 
20170543) were integrated with measured in vitro and kinetic parameters to estimate DDI risk for 
both CYPs and transporters; estimates were only carried out for CYPs or transporters where inhibition 
was observed in vitro.  
Initial DDI risk estimates were calculated using basic models of reversible inhibition, as described in 
the EMA and FDA Guidance on Drug Interactions (FDA, 2020; EMA, 2013). For CYP2C8 and CYP2D6, 
estimates based mechanistic static models or physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling, 
respectively, indicated that a clinical study was not necessary, as estimated increases in AUC upon co-
administration with CYP-isoform selective substrates were within the 1.25-fold criteria defined by the 
EMA and FDA guidance. For CYP3A, a clinical study was run due to the complex nature of the 
anticipated DDI (simultaneous CYP inhibition, inactivation, and induction). For transporters, estimated 
DDIs for BCRP, MATE-1, MATE-2K, and P-gp exceeded the recommended guidance thresholds; clinical 
DDI studies for MATE-1/MATE-2K and P-gp were run. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity studies were not conducted. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
The repeat dose toxicological assessment of sotorasib has been conducted in the Rat/Sprague Dawley 
and Dog/Beagle by oral gavage administration of sotorasib up to 3 months duration (including 
supportive toxicokinetic evaluations). 
Two repeat dose GLP studies evaluated the potential toxicity and measured toxicokinetics of sotorasib 
in Sprague Dawley rats when administered by daily oral dosing up to or 200 mg/kg for 28 days 
(followed by a 28-day recovery) and up to 750 mg/Kg for 3-month (followed by 2-month recovery). 
The administration of sotorasib by once daily oral gavage was well tolerated in animals dosed up to 
200 mg/kg (the highest dose in the 28 day-study) and up to 180 mg/Kg (the mean dose tested in the 
3-month study). 
The kidney was identified as a target organ of toxicity in the rat. Minimal to moderate 
degeneration/necrosis of renal tubular epithelium was observed. The incidence and severity of tubular 
degeneration/necrosis were generally dose dependent and involved primarily the outer stripes of the 
outer medulla of the kidney. 
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021  
Page 27/147 
 
 
 
 
At the severely toxic dose in 10% of the rats (STD10; 180 mg/Kg) determined in the 3-month repeat 
dose study, mild tubular degeneration/necrosis were accompanied by morphologic features in the 
tubular epithelium involving large portions of the outer and/or inner stripes of the outer medulla 
(OSOM and ISOM, respectively). In the OSOM, there was cytoplasmic basophilia with or without focal 
necrosis of isolated or small segments of tubular epithelium. In the ISOM, there was scattered acute 
necrosis of tubule epithelium characterised by shrunken hypereosinophilic cytoplasm and pyknotic 
nuclei. Moderate tubular degeneration was accompanied with tubular necrosis in the OSOM, 
characterised by numerous short segments of tubular epithelium with granular to hypereosinophilic 
cytoplasm and pyknotic or absent nuclei. Sotorasib related changes in clinical chemistry, urinalysis, 
urine chemistry, and urine biomarkers were generally consistent with renal tubular injury and 
dysfunction. A full recovery of those parameters was observed at the end of treatment period. 
A mechanistic exploratory 7-Day Oral Toxicology Study in the Male Sprague Dawley Rat (Study 
153127) was conducted in order to address the renal toxicity in the rat characterised by tubular 
epithelial degeneration/necrosis primarily restricted to the proximal tubules in the OSOM. The 
formation of a putative toxic reactive metabolite in the rat kidney was involved in the mechanism of 
renal toxicity. Therefore, the renal findings were considered a rat-specific toxicity, not expected to be 
relevant for Humans (see: Other Studies, Mechanistic studies). 
Sotorasib related changes in haematology parameters were also observed during the treatment period. 
The increased haematopoiesis in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow was predominantly composed of 
erythroid precursors and was considered a normal physiologic response to the sotorasib related 
minimal decrease in RBC mass. However, those changes in the haematological parameters were 
completely reversed at the end of the recovery phase. Moreover, none of the sotorasib related clinical 
pathology findings and microscopic changes were considered to be severely toxic.  
Based on these results, the severely toxic dose in 10% of animals (STD10) was considered to be > 200 
mg/kg in the 28-day study (200 mg/kg Day 27 Cmax and AUClast values of 2.35 μg/mL and 12.6 
hr*μg/mL for the males and 8.61 μg/mL and 53.7 hr*μg/mL for the females) and to be 180 mg/kg in 
the 3-month study (180 mg/kg Day 91 Cmax: 10.1 μg/mL and AUClast: 63.7 hr*μg/mL; the exposure 
multiples). The exposure multiples based on unchanged sotorasib concentration in plasma from 
patients dosed 960 mg sotorasib tended to be low (1.7). 
Two repeat dose GLP studies evaluated the potential toxicity and measured toxicokinetics of sotorasib 
in the Beagle Dog when administered by daily oral dosing up to 300 mg/kg for 28 days and up to 1000 
mg/kg (500 mg/Kg BID) for 3-month. 
Sotorasib was well tolerated following daily oral administration in the 28-day study up to 300 mg/kg. 
Key sotorasib related changes were limited to minimal to mild decrease in RBC mass associated with 
decreased reticulocytes. The highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) was considered to be  300 
mg/kg (correlated to Day 27 Cmax/ AUClast values of 3.68 μg/mL/ 15.8 hr* μg/mL).

Table 4: Mean ± SD toxicokinetic parameters for sotorasib after daily oral administration for 28 days in 
the Beagle dog (sexes combined) 
In the GLP 3-month dog toxicology study (Study 150433), higher dose levels were evaluated (up to 
500 mg/kg BID) to achieve higher systemic exposure; however, the exposure even at 1000 mg/kg/day 
was lower than the exposure observed in the 3-month rat toxicology study.  
The administration of sotorasib by twice daily oral gavage was well tolerated in beagle dogs at levels of 
1000 mg/kg/day. Sotorasib related changes included abnormal content in the gall bladder, minimal to 
mild changes in haematology (decrease in RBC mass) and serum chemistry parameters (increase in 
total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol and triglycerides). Light microscopic changes were 
observed in the liver (hepatocellular hypertrophy with increased liver weight), pituitary (hypertrophy of 
basophils with increased pituitary weight), and the thyroid gland (decreased colloid and hypertrophy of 
follicular epithelium with decreased thyroid weight). These microscopic changes were considered to be 
either non-severely toxic and attributed to an adaptive or secondary response to hepatocellular 
enzyme induction. 
No toxicological findings in the kidney were identified in the repeat dose toxicity studies conducted in 
the dog. The highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) was 1000 mg/kg/day (correlated to Day 90 
Cmax/ AUClast values of 4.63 μg/mL/ 14.1 hr* μg/mL). The exposure multiples based on unchanged 
sotorasib concentration in plasma from patients dosed 960 mg sotorasib are lower than 1.

(Study 153409) was performed. An adaptive response to reduced thyroid hormone levels by induced 
hepatic UGTs was identified. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Sotorasib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) assay (Study 124824). Sotorasib was 
not genotoxic in the in vivo rat micronucleus and comet assays. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
The reproductive and developmental safety assessment of sotorasib is focused on embryofetal 
toxicology studies. Data from a non-pivotal maternal tolerability study performed in rabbits and two 
GLP-embryo-fetal studies conducted in the Sprague Dawley Rat and New Zealand White rabbits was 
provided (including supportive toxicokinetic evaluations). The set of available reproductive and 
developmental toxicological information is in line with ICH S9 requirements to support the marketing of 
pharmaceuticals for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer.  
The non-clinical assessment of potential adverse effects of sotorasib in male and female reproductive 
organs has been addressed within the scope of repeat dose toxicity studies. No toxicological findings in 
the reproductive organs were mentioned in studies conducted in rats and dogs. 
Potential safety concerns on embryo-foetal development have been assessed in the Sprague Dawley 
Rat and New Zealand White rabbits orally dosed with sotorasib from Gestation Day (GD)7 to GD17 and 
from GD7 to GD19, respectively.  
Sotorasib was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley CD (Crl:CD[SD]) female rats once daily by 
oral gavage from GD 7 through GD 17 at doses up to 540 mg/kg. Sotorasib was tolerated at all dose 
levels with maternal effects on body weights, body weight gains, and food consumption at the highest 
dose, 540 mg/kg (corresponding to a systemic exposure 3.9 times higher than the exposure at the 
human dose of 960 mg based on AUC). There were no effects on any ovarian, uterine or litter 
parameters. In addition, there were no effects on embryo-fetal survival or fetal body weights at any 
dose. Sotorasib did not produce any fetal external, visceral, or skeletal malformations or variations. 
In the study conducted in rabbits, female New Zealand White [Hra: (NZW)SPF] rabbits were orally 
administered sotorasib from GD 7 through GD 19 at doses up to 100 mg/Kg. Sotorasib related 
maternal effects included early euthanasia of one female on GD 21 and lower maternal body weight 
gain and food consumption at 100 mg/Kg (i.e., 2.2 times higher than the systemic exposure at the 
human dose of 960 mg based on AUC). There were no effects on embryo-fetal survival, but there were 
sotorasib related reductions in mean fetal body weights and a delay in skeletal ossification (fewer 
metacarpals) at 100 mg/Kg. Those fetal findings were observed only at the dose level associated with 
decreased body weight gain and food consumption in dams during the dosing phase. Maternal 
administration of sotorasib did not produce any fetal external, visceral, or skeletal malformations or 
variations. A delay in the skeletal ossification, as evidence of growth retardation associated with 
reduced fetal body weight in the presence of significant maternal toxicity, might be interpreted as a 
non-specific effect of sotorasib in the embryo-fetal development.

2.5.4.6.  Local tolerance  
Local tolerance of sotorasib was evaluated after oral dosing in the repeat-dose studies; no evidence of 
local irritant effects was observed in the digestive tract. 
2.5.4.7.  Other toxicity studies 
Several screening assessments were performed for 3 circulating metabolites, AMG3368167 (M24), 
AMG3375854 (M10), and AMG3413829 (M18), identified in human, rat and dog. The screening 
assessments included potential primary or secondary pharmacology effects and for effects on in vitro 
hERG potassium channel and mutagenicity. The results indicated no clinically relevant safety concerns. 
There are 9 specified impurities in total warranting nonclinical qualification; all of them were qualified 
with bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) and general 28-day repeat-dose toxicology studies 
in the rat or dog in line with the ICH guidance (ICH Q3A, 2006; ICH Q3B, 2006). 
A study was conducted to determine the phototoxic potential of AMG3365648. Sotorasib at 
concentrations from 0.032 to 100 g/mL was negative in an exploratory in vitro study using 3T3 
fibroblasts.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The effects of sotorasib monotherapy in vitro studies consisted of structural, biochemical and cellular 
characterisation of sotorasib. Primary pharmacodynamics in vivo studies included 1) effects of 
sotorasib monotherapy (consisting of pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetics and occupancy studies of 
sotorasib), 2) effects of sotorasib combination therapy and 3) effects of sotorasib on anti-tumour 
inflammatory response. The studies were well planned and clearly indicated that sotorasib targets 
specifically tumours with KRAS p.G12C mutation, and inhibits growth of these tumours. 
In combination studies of tumour cell viability in vitro, significantly enhanced anti-tumour activity of 
sotorasib was observed with the MAPK pathway upstream and downstream of RAS inhibitors, and with 
inhibitors of EGFR/pan- erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase family (ErbB), SHP 2, or MAPK/ERK kinases. 
Combination of sotorasib with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (PD1 antibody) enhanced tumour 
regression at a lower sotorasib dose. Sotorasib was shown to induce a pro-inflammatory 
microenvironment. The genes affected included those involved in interferon signalling, chemokine 
production (including Cxcl11), antigen processing, cytotoxic and natural killer cell activity, and markers 
of innate immune system stimulation. 
Overall, in vitro and in vivo primary pharmacology data support the intended clinical use. Moreover, 
the in vivo models and the sotorasib dose range studied are considered mostly relevant for the clinical 
situation.

Sotorasib did not show significant activity in vitro against various targets including receptors, enzymes, 
ion channels, and transporters. In NCI-H358 tumour cells, cysteine-proteome profiling demonstrated 
that sotorasib engaged only the cysteine at amino acid position 12 (Cys12) peptide from KRASG12C. 
General off-target selectivity of 3 major human circulating metabolites, M24, M18 and M10 was 
assessed in the same way as sotorasib. The concentration of these metabolites in the in vitro assays 
was 14 to 138-fold greater than the unbound fraction of the metabolites observed in human (Table 3). 
The only positive signal in screening studies, M24 at 10 µM showed inhibition for Neurokinin NK1 and 
NK2 receptors. However, this effect is not considered to be clinically significant as the concentration of 
10 µM is 138-folder higher than the free fraction of M24 in human plasma at 960 mg.  
IC50 for human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) was 54.8 µM sotorasib, therefore clinically 
significant interaction with the hERG are not expected at therapeutic doses. In a GLP cardiovascular 
safety pharmacology study in telemetered dogs, sotorasib at doses up to 300 mg/kg did not result in 
changes to electrocardiogram (ECG) or haemodynamic parameters. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis for SOTORASIB were adequately validated. However, studies of SOTORASIB were 
performed with the (S) isomer, while no information is provided for the potential isomerisation in vitro 
or in vivo. Sotorasib is used as (S, M) isomer. Sotorasib molecule has both chiral centre and chiral 
axis. The desired (S, M)-isomer has chiral centre in S-configuration and chiral axis in M-configuration. 
In the applicant’s answer it is talked about rotamers, which points to chiral axis. Chiral axis forms in 
sotorasib molecule so that spin of the pyridine ring of the lower part of the molecule around the first 
bond is not free due to presence of substituents attached to the pyridine ring. Therefore, sotorasib can 
exist as following forms: 1. (S, M), desired form; 2. (S, P); 3. (R, M); 4. (R, P). In the specifications of 
DS there are limits for those chiral impurities. Chemically (S, M) isomer is stabile (28 days, 80 C). 
However, what happens in vivo remains to be solved. The applicant has demonstrated that no 
conversion of sotorasib to its rotamers was observed at 37ºC during in vitro studies, using human 
plasma, over 2 hours. As per EMA guideline on “Investigation of Chiral Active Substances”, the 
possibility of the formation of the other enantiomer “in vivo” should be considered in relation to the 
chemical structure at an early stage in order to justify the need for any enantiospecific bioanalysis. The 
potential for interconversion of sotorasib rotomers was evaluated using clinical samples at day 1 and 
day 8 from clinical study 20170543 and reported in Study 155849. No conversion of sotorasib to its 
rotomers was observed in the clinical samples.  
Sotorasib was readily absorbed after a PO dose to non-cannulated male and female rats and BDC male 
rats. Primary sotorasib biotransformation was mediated by non-enzymatic glutathione conjugation. 
The absorption of sotorasib was studied in mouse, rat, dog and monkey. The major circulating 
metabolite M24 was observed in all nonclinical species. In humans, M24 is not the main circulating 
metabolite. 
Sotorasib and its metabolite M24 were highly permeable in vitro across canine kidney epithelial cells in 
MDCK Transwell Assay. Caco-2 monolayer cells derived from colon cancer cells can be considered the 
gold standard for in vitro permeability assay. MDR1-tranfected MDCK cell systems are useful to 
characterise P-gp transporter activity and inhibition in vitro. Sotorasib is a P-gp substrate; thus, active 
transport by P-gp may affect sotorasib absorption and elimination. MDR1-tranfected MDCK cell system 
can be considered an appropriate permeability assay for sotorasib as an alternative to Caco-2 assay. 
Overall, [14C] -sotorasib-derived radioactivity was minimally absorbed and was eliminated 
predominantly as unchanged sotorasib in faeces following a single 500 mg/kg dose to male or female 
dogs.

Sotorasib is an amphoteric molecule, with basic pKa of 4.56 and acidic pKa of 8.06. In dogs, which 
have some unique characteristics in gastrointestinal physiology, incomplete sotorasib dissolution in the 
suspension or tablet formulations led to incomplete absorption and lower systemic exposure when 
compared to the solution dose. 
Based on the radiolabelled mass balance studies in rat (Study 152495), dog (Study 153304), and 
human (Study 20190321), sotorasib metabolite M10 was the major circulating metabolite observed in 
rat, dog, and human.  
Although a preliminary in vitro metabolite assessment using human hepatocytes indicated that 
metabolites M10, M18 and M24 were the predominant sotorasib metabolites, M10 metabolite was 
determined as a single major metabolite (> 10% of total radioactivity) based on the human mass 
balance study (Study 20190321). It is agreed that the 3-month repeat-dose toxicology study in the rat 
evaluated sufficiently the safety of not only unchanged sotorasib, but also human major metabolite 
M10. Moreover, results from cross-species studies (150531) on the metabolism of sotorasib in vitro in 
hepatocytes from mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human show that M10 was formed in all species 
(percent of total MS response 2.5, 2.6, 12.1, 6.8 and 9.9%, respectively). Thus, per ICHS9 M10 is not 
a unique human major metabolite. 
Non-clinical studies with metabolites for anticancer pharmaceuticals are not warranted based on ICH 
S9 (ICH S9, 2009) and ICH S9 Q&A clarification (ICH S9 Q&A, 2018). Therefore, exposures to key 
metabolites (including M10) were not directly measured within any GLP toxicology studies. However, 
based on the results from the rat mass balance study (Study 152495), systemic exposure to M10 
metabolite in the 3-month rat study can be extrapolated, and the predicted exposures to M10 
metabolite in the rat are considered to be greater than those in humans. The dose level used in the 
single-dose rat mass balance study with 14C-sotorasib was 60 mg/kg. The Cmax of metabolite M10 in 
the rat were approximately 5.5- to 9-fold greater than those in humans that received a single dose of 
sotorasib at the highest clinical dose of 960 mg (Table 3). The dose levels used in the 3-month rat 
study were 60, 180 and 750 mg/kg. Although there were no steady-state M10 metabolite exposure 
data in the rat, M10 metabolite exposure in the rat at the lowest dose of 60 mg/kg was already higher 
than that in human at the highest clinical dose; therefore, M10 metabolite exposures in the rat at both 
of the higher doses of 180 and 750 mg/kg are expected to be greater compared to the human. Thus, 
the 3-month repeat-dose toxicology study in the rat (at least one species) evaluated the safety of not 
only unchanged sotorasib but also human major metabolite M10.  
In vitro studies indicate that sotorasib is metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8, CYP3A4, and 
CYP3A5, and is a substrate of P glycoprotein (P gp). Sotorasib was an inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 in vitro. Sotorasib is an in vitro inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and 
CYP3A. In vitro studies indicate that sotorasib is an inhibitor of human organic anion transporter 
(OAT)3, OATP1B1, Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) and P-gp (see section 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Toxicology 
Potential acute effects of sotorasib were evaluated in the repeat-dose rat and dog toxicology studies. 
There were no sotorasib related acute adverse effects in the rat or dog. The lack of dedicated single 
dose toxicity studies is acceptable. The non-clinical set of repeat dose toxicity studies are in line with 
ICH S9. The repeat dose toxicological assessment of sotorasib has been conducted in the Rat/Sprague 
Dawley and Dog/Beagle by oral gavage administration of sotorasib up to 3 months duration (including 
supportive toxicokinetics evaluations). Primary pharmacology-related on-target effects are not 
expected in “non-tumour-bearing” rats and dogs used in repeat dose toxicological assessment. 
Two repeat dose GLP studies evaluated the potential toxicity and measured toxicokinetics of sotorasib 
in Sprague Dawley rats when administered by daily oral dosing up to or 200 mg/kg for 28 days

(followed by a 28-day recovery) and up to 750 mg/Kg for 3-month (followed by 2-month recovery). 
The administration of sotorasib by once daily oral gavage was well tolerated in animals dosed up to 
200 mg/kg (the highest dose in the 28 day-study) and up to 180 mg/Kg (the mean dose tested in the 
3-month study). 
Consistent with tumour-specific target distribution, there were no primary pharmacology-related 
on-target effects identified from pivotal repeat-dose toxicology studies. The kidney was identified as a 
target organ of toxicity in the rat. Minimal to moderate degeneration/necrosis of renal tubular 
epithelium was observed. The incidence and severity of tubular degeneration/necrosis were generally 
dose dependent and involved primarily the outer stripes of the outer medulla of the kidney. In the 28-
day study, 2 of 20 animals at 200 mg/kg (the highest dose tested) had renal tubular 
degeneration/necrosis, and this change was minimal to mild. In the 3-month rat study, the same renal 
change progressed to a more chronic nature that involved more of the renal tubule; this was attributed 
to higher exposures and longer study duration. Based on the results of mechanistic studies as well as 
the metabolic pathways of sotorasib, the renal toxicity was attributed to the formation of a putative 
toxic reactive metabolite following metabolism of sotorasib by the mercapturate pathway. Rat-specific 
renal toxicity and a low risk in the clinic are supported by sotorasib metabolism and safety data, as 
well as published information (Anders, 2004b; Gul Altuntas and Kharasch, 2002; Iyer and Anders, 
1996; Mccarthy et al, 1994; Green et al, 1990; Lash et al, 1990). Similar toxicity was not observed in 
the dog toxicology studies and there have been no similar signals of acute renal toxicity in the 
sotorasib clinical trials to date. Clinical trials with sotorasib have included monitoring of renal function 
with regular measurement of the serum creatinine and/or estimated creatinine clearance along with 
microscopic examination of urine sediment. The applicant confirmed that there has been no signal 
identified in the clinical studies suggestive of similar renal toxicity characterised in the rat toxicology 
studies. 
Sotorasib related changes in haematology parameters were also observed during the treatment period. 
However, those changes were completely reversed at the end of the recovery phase. Moreover, none 
of the sotorasib related clinical pathology findings and microscopic changes were considered to be 
severely toxic. Based on these results, the severely toxic dose in 10% of animals (STD10) was 
considered to be > 200 mg/kg in the 28-day study and to be 180 mg/kg in the 3-month study. The 
exposure multiples based on unchanged sotorasib concentration in plasma from patients dosed 960 mg 
sotorasib tended to be low (1.7). 
Two repeat dose GLP studies evaluated the potential toxicity and measured toxicokinetics of sotorasib 
in the Beagle Dog when administered by daily oral dosing up to 300 mg/kg for 28 days and up to 1000 
mg/kg (500 mg/kg BID) for 3-month. Sotorasib was well tolerated following daily oral administration in 
the 28-day study up to 300 mg/kg. Key sotorasib related changes were limited to minimal to mild 
decrease in RBC mass associated with decreased reticulocytes. In the GLP 3-month dog toxicology 
study, higher dose levels were evaluated (up to 500 mg/kg BID) to achieve higher systemic exposure; 
however, the exposure even at 1000 mg/kg/day was lower than the exposure observed in the 3-month 
rat toxicology study.  
In the dog 3-month study there were adaptive changes in the liver, pituitary, and thyroid, secondary to 
hepatocellular enzyme induction. If effects on the thyroid do occur, they are clinically monitorable.  
The mean observed sotorasib clinical exposures from 180, 360, 720, and 960 mg once daily (QD) 
dosing in subjects (Study 20170543) were lower than the exposures observed at the STD10 of 180 
mg/kg in rats in the 3-month GLP repeat-dose toxicology study (Study 150432), but higher than the 
exposures observed at the HNSTD of 1000 mg/kg/day in dogs in the 3-month GLP repeat-dose 
toxicology study (Study 150433).

The comparison of Cmax and AUC values in the last TK sampling day confirms the low exposure of 
sotorasib in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs compared to exposure in human plasma after 
a single dose (Day 1, Study 20170543). On Day 8 Cmax was 25% lower in human plasma suggesting 
that steady-dose Cmax of sotorasib is presumably further decreasing along the dosing due to 
autoinduction of its own metabolism.  
When considering the exposure multiples based on steady-state sotorasib concentration in human 
plasma relative to exposure in plasma of animal species used in toxicology studies, it was challenging 
to establish the optimal study design of repeat-dose toxicology studies, especially in the dog, due to 
low sotorasib systemic exposure. In pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies only TK of the parent drug was 
measured and therefore, it is now known the amount of the circulating metabolites in the plasma of 
toxicology species. Neither are there specific safety data of the main metabolites available and their 
impact on nonclinical toxicology evaluation and safety margins is not known.  
The higher exposures for the sum of sotorasib and its metabolites in rat and dog as compared to the 
exposures observed in clinic do not fully support that the nonclinical toxicology evaluation sufficiently 
assessed potential safety liabilities for the clinic. Especially in the dog, the interrelationship of the 
physiologic characteristics of the canine gastrointestinal tract and those of a particular compound can 
be difficult to unravel (Tibbits 2003).  
Sotorasib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) assay. Sotorasib was not genotoxic in 
the in vivo rat micronucleus and comet assays. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with sotorasib which is acceptable in line with ICHS9. 
In rat (Sprague Dawley) and rabbit (New Zealand White) embryo-foetal development studies (as 
described by ICH S5(R3), 2020), oral sotorasib was not teratogenic. Moreover, data from a non-pivotal 
maternal tolerability study performed in rabbits has been provided. 
In the rat, there were no effects on embryo-fetal development up to the highest dose tested (540 
mg/kg, corresponding to a systemic exposure 3.9 times higher than the exposure at the maximum 
recommended human dose [MRHD] of 960 mg based on area under the curve [AUC]). 
In the rabbit, lower fetal body weights and a reduction in the number of ossified metacarpals in 
foetuses were observed only at the highest dose level tested (100 mg/kg, corresponding to a systemic 
exposure 2.2 times higher than the exposure at the MRHD of 960 mg based on AUC), which was 
associated with maternal effects such as decreased body weight gain and food consumption during the 
dosing phase. Reduced ossification, as evidence of growth retardation associated with reduced foetal 
body weight, was interpreted as a non-specific effect in the presence of significant maternal toxicity 
(see section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
Primary pharmacology-related on-target effects on embryofetal development will not be expected in 
normal “non-tumour-bearing” animals. 
Sotorasib was not phototoxic in vitro. Human circulating metabolites, M24, M10 and M18 raised no 
clinically relevant safety concerns based on primary or secondary pharmacology screening, in vitro 
hERG or mutagenicity assessment.  
As per ICH guideline S9 on non-clinical evaluation for anticancer pharmaceuticals, exceeding the 
established limits for impurities identified in ICH Q3A and Q3B guidelines could be appropriate for 
anticancer pharmaceuticals. There are 9 specified impurities in total warranting nonclinical 
qualification; all of them were qualified with bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) and general 
28 day repeat dose toxicology studies in the rat or dog in line with the ICH guidance (ICH Q3A, 2006; 
ICH Q3B, 2006).

Sotorasib is not a PBT substance. Considering the above data, sotorasib should be used according to 
the precautions stated in the SmPC (section 6.6) in order to minimise any potential risks to the 
environment. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The primary pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that sotorasib is highly selective 
small molecule inhibitor that covalently binds to the KRASG12C and impairs downstream oncogenic 
signalling exclusively in KRAS p.G12C tumour cells. The KRAS p.G12C mutation has only been reported 
in tumour tissue and is not present in normal tissue. Consistent with tumour specific target 
distribution, there were no apparent primary pharmacology related on target effects identified. 
From the pharmacokinetic point of view, sotorasib has a very complex metabolism. The main 
metabolites have accumulation potential in the plasma. Sotorasib and the main metabolites had 
several interactions in vitro with CYP isoforms and human transporters, some of which may be clinically 
relevant. 
Overall, the toxicology programme revealed that sotorasib had low toxicity potential in pivotal toxicity 
studies.  
Overall, the nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology programme may support the 
marketing authorisation of sotorasib for treatment of KRAS p.G12C-mutated tumours.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Sotorasib is an orally available, first in class small molecule that specifically binds and irreversibly 
inhibits the KRASp.G12C mutant protein (KRASG12C). 
In addition to non-clinical pharmacokinetics studies (in vitro metabolite profiling, CYP inhibition and 
induction, and P-gp substrate evaluation, protein binding …), the clinical pharmacology investigations 
of sotorasib consisted of 9 clinical studies performed in healthy volunteers and one in patients (Study 
20170543, Pivotal study). 
The PK of sotorasib have not been investigated in special populations such as hepatic dysfunction. 
PopPK analysis and two exposure-response analysis were performed. 
Methods 
•  Bioanalysis 
Plasma concentration of sotorasib and its metabolites (M10, M18 and M24) were determined using a 
liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS), two separates methods were used. 
• 
Pharmacokinetic analysis 
Standard non-compartmental (model-independent) pharmacokinetic methods were used to calculate 
PK parameters using Phoenix® WinNonlin version 8.1 (Certara, Princeton, NJ). 
Pharmacokinetics of sotorasib were investigated by population modelling using a nonlinear mixed 
effects modelling approach with NONMEM software program (version 7.2, ICON Development 
Solutions, Ellicot City, MD).  
Exposure-response analysis (efficacy and safety) were also performed using predicted PK metrics from 
the population pharmacokinetic model. 
Absorption  
Following single oral dose of sotorasib in healthy volunteers or patients and after multiple-dosing of 
sotorasib at doses between 180 mg to 960 mg, median Tmax ranged from 0.73 to 1.5h in HV and from 
1 to 1.5 h in patients. 
In patients Cmax ranged from 6190 to 8600 ng/mL at Day 1 and from 5390 to 6440 ng/mL at Day 8. 
As shown at Day 1 and more particularly at Day 8, PK exposure parameters are similar between a 180 
mg and a 960 mg QD dose (Table 8). 
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021  
Page 40/147 
 
 
 
 
Table 8: PK parameter estimates following oral administration of sotorasib QD from 180 mg to 960 mg 
Formal clinical investigation (mass balance study 20190321) does not support a fairly high degree 
(≥85%) of absorption of sotorasib in humans. The overall recovery of radioactivity was low 80.6%, 
with 74.4 % of the dose recovered in faeces and 5.81% recovered in urine. Approximately 54.4% of 
[14C]-sotorasib was recovered unchanged in faeces, whereas less than 2% was recovered unchanged 
in urine. Absorption of sotorasib is clear affected by a preponderant pre-systemic elimination process. 
Sotorasib is a low permeable drug (<85%) and is a low soluble drug (pH dependent), therefore 
sotorasib is a BCS class 4 drug. 
Absolute bioavailability 
The absolute bioavailability is unknown. However based on the results of the mass balance study 
(despite the fact that only 80% of the total radioactivity was recovered), F could be estimated around 
26%, unless it could be demonstrated that all the sotorasib unchanged part (=54,5%) excreted in 
faeces is firstly absorbed in the systemic circulation then excreted unchanged in faeces. 
Relative bioavailability/Bioequivalence 
The claimed recommended dose of sotorasib is 960 mg suggesting QD intake of 8 tablets of 120 mg. 
Therefore, the applicant investigated an alternative method of administration where sotorasib will be 
predispersed in water. 
Results of study 20190500 show that PK exposure parameters (Cmax, AUCs) remain similar with or 
without predispersed SOTORASIB in water. Based on this study, the applicant statement that sotorasib 
can be taken with this alternative method is acceptable 
Food effect 
In study 20190316, the effect of a high fat meal on sotorasib PK was investigated in 14 healthy 
volunteers who were administered a single oral dose of 360 mg sotorasib in the fasted and the fed 
states. PK results indicated that administration of a high fat meal delayed by 1.25 (median Tmax) the 
absorption of sotorasib. Following administration of sotorasib with a high-fat, high-calorie meal, there 
was no effect on Cmax, and AUC increased by 38% compared to administration under fasted 
conditions.  
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021  
Page 41/147 
 
 
 
 
 
In study 20170543, the effect of high fat meal was performed in a subset of patients, who were 
administered oral dose of 360 (n=2) or 960 mg (n=8) sotorasib in the fasted and the fed states.  
PK results indicated that administration of a high fat meal delayed the absorption of sotorasib by 3h 
with a median Tmax of 4h. In the fed state the AUC and Cmax of sotorasib were 75% and 38% higher 
respectively, compared to the fasted state at the dose of 360 mg. At a 960 mg dose Cmax decreased 
by 34% and AUC increased by 25% compared to fasted state. 
Based on these data, the applicant preconise that sotorasib can be administered with or without food.  
Effects with acid reducing agents 
In study 20200199, the effects of acidic reducing agents (omeprazole and famotidine) in fed state on 
sotorasib PK was investigated in 14 healthy volunteers who were administered 960 mg sotorasib in the 
fed state.  
Under fed conditions (standard calorie moderate-fat meals), co-administration of multiple doses of 
omeprazole with a single dose of 960 mg sotorasib decreased sotorasib Cmax by 65% and AUC by 
57%. Co-administration of a single dose of famotidine given 10 hours prior and 2 hours after a single 
dose of 960 mg sotorasib decreased sotorasib Cmax by 35% and AUC by 38%. 
Under fasted conditions, co administration of multiple doses of omeprazole with a single dose of 960 
mg sotorasib decreased sotorasib Cmax by 57% and AUC by 42% 
Distribution 
In vitro, plasma protein binding of sotorasib was 89% and sotorasib bound preferentially to alpha-1-
acid glycoprotein in vitro (Study 155351). 
In the human AME study (Study 20190321), the blood-to-plasma radioactivity ratios was determined 
to be 1 (range min-max: 0.8-1.29), suggesting lack of meaningful distribution of sotorasib into blood 
cells. Based on in vitro investigation mean B/P was estimated at 0.69. 
Following oral dosing, in healthy volunteers the sotorasib Vz/F was estimated at 242 L, thus indicating 
high distribution in tissues. The geometric mean apparent volume of distribution after 960 mg PO QD 
for 8 consecutive days of sotorasib was 211 L (determined using noncompartmental analysis). 
Elimination 
In patients (study 20170543) receiving doses of 180, 360, 720, and 960 mg as film-coated tablets 
(except for the 180 mg dose containing 30 and 120 mg as uncoated tablet), sotorasib clearance (CL/F) 
varied between geometric mean of 4.42 and 14.3 L/h (48 – 108 %CV) on day 1. At Day 8, following 
multiple dose of 960 mg sotorasib once daily, geometric mean CL/F was estimated at 26.2 L/h and the 
mean half-life was 5h. 
The main elimination route was hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4 enzyme and excretion of metabolites 
in both urine and faeces. Sotorasib is mainly excreted as unchanged drug in faeces (53%) and in urine 
with a fraction excreted less than 2 % (1.74%). 
•  Mass balance  
The mass balance study 20190321 consisted of the administration of a single oral dose of 720 mg 
containing approximately 1µCi of [14C]-sotorasib to 8 healthy volunteers. Results are summarised in 
Table 9 (plasma and plasma total radioactivity) and Figure 2.

Table 9: Summary of PK parameters of plasma and total radioactivity in plasma of SOTORASIB  
Figure 2: Arithmetic mean (+SD) cumulative urinary and faecal recovery (% Radioactive dose) vs time 
Following oral administration, approximately 5.81% of the radioactive dose was recovered in urine with 
unchanged sotorasib of 1.39% and 74.4% in the faeces with unchanged sotorasib of 52.97%. Renal 
clearance was found to be low and estimated at 0.41 L/h.  
Metabolism 
Sotorasib was extensively metabolised following oxidative and conjugation process as shown in Error! 
Reference source not found.. Following direct injection of diluted plasma, sotorasib accounted for 
17.1% of the total radioactivity and one major metabolite was detected, M10 which account for 26.8%. 
Other metabolites such as M24, M18 and M12 accounted for 7.81%, 4.28% and 3.28%, respectively.  
Results of the metabolite profiling indicated that sotorasib was the main component excreted in faeces 
with 52.97% of dose. M8, M10, M18 and M24 accounted for less than 1.49%, AMG3414811 was not 
detected in faeces, nor in plasma. In urine AMG510 and M10 was the main components excreted with

1.39% and 1.49% respectively. Therefore whereas 86% of the dose excreted in the urine was 
identified, approximately 80% of the dose excreted in faeces was identified. 
Based on in vitro investigations using human recombinant CYP enzymes, sotorasib was found to be 
predominantly metabolised by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5 and 2C8.  
Following single oral administration of a radioactive sotorasib dose of 720 mg, a cysteine adduct (M12, 
formed through hydrolysis of a glutathione adduct) and an oxidative metabolite (M24) resulting from 
CYP3A-mediated cleavage of the piperazine acrylamide moiety were the primary circulating 
metabolites. Neither of these metabolites were pharmacologically active.

Interconversion 
Sotorasib has an asymmetric (S) carbon and a chiral axe (M). However the manufacturing process is 
designed to develop only sotorasib (S,M). Therefore any endogenous inter-conversion is unlikely.

M10, M18 and M20 PK was characterised in a subset of patient during study 20170543. Only M18 was 
found to be active but lesser than sotorasib.  
Based on the PK profiles, M10 appears to accumulate with an AR of 17.2, whereas both M18 and M24 
had minor accumulation (AR approximately of 3). 
M24 is considered inactive. However since M24 formation was mediated by CYP 3A effects on CYP 
inhibition and induction was investigated. M24 was found in vitro to be a time-dependent inhibitor of 
CYP3A and an inducer of CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19.In addition M24 was also characterised as 
a P-gp substrate and an inhibitor of P-gp. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality of sotorasib was investigated following single and multiple oral doses in patients 
during Study 20170543. 
Following single oral dose of sotorasib from 180 mg to 960 mg, both Cmax and AUCinf appears overall 
similar, with increasing CL and V as dose increase. Following multiple dose the same trend is observed 
for both the PK exposure metrics (Cmax and AUCinf) and PK parameters (CL and V). 
Geometric mean Cmax and AUC0-24h were less than dose proportional, with 1.4 and 1.9-fold increases, 
respectively, for a 5.3 increase in dose over the dose range of 180 to 960 mg. Similarly, Cmax and 
AUC0-24h increase by 1- to 1.3-fold with the same dose range at Day 8, this is particularly highlighted in 
Error! Reference source not found.. 
Only patients received multiple dose of sotorasib. Following QD dosing in patients the applicant claimed 
that steady state is expected to be reached after 3 weeks as shown in Figure 4. Whereas estimated 
half-life of sotorasib was 6.5h, after repeated administration, no accumulation of the product is 
expected.  
The discrepancy between the estimated half-life and the reaching of steady state, rely, according to 
the applicant, on an auto-induction phenomenon. Interestingly the auto-induction process appears 
more pronounced when the QD dose increased from 180 to 960 mg. Such behavior has been handled 
in the PopPK analysis.

Pharmacokinetic in target population 
Population pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling was performed to characterise and predict the PK of 
sotorasib (report 152921). Data from six studies were utilised; five Phase 1 studies in 69 healthy 
volunteers (n=14 each from studies 20190316, 20190318, 20190319, 20190320, and n=13 from 
study 20190317), and one Phase 1/2 study (study 20170543) is being performed in oncology patients 
with 258 patients with NSCLC, 113 patients with rectal or colon cancer, and 60 patients with other 
types of tumours (overall n=431 from study 20170543). The PK analysis dataset included 
concentration-time data from all patients receiving at least one dose at data cutoff of September 2nd, 
2020. The analysis dataset consisted of 7476 quantifiable sotorasib concentration time samples from 
500 volunteers. Overall, 276 of 7752 samples, 3.56 % samples below the limit of quantification were 
excluded from the analysis.

The population PK model was updated using additional data. Additional data from studies 20190500 
(comparative Bioavailability/Bioequivalence: single oral doses of 960 mg sotorasib administered as 
either tablets or a water dispersion) and 20200199 (effect of acid reducing agents, famotidine or 
omeprazole in fed state; PK, safety, and tolerability: sotorasib 960 mg PO administered alone and in 
combination with either 40 mg famotidine or 40 mg omeprazole) in healthy were added to the dataset.  
The number of patients for study 20170543 included in the population PK analysis are presented in  
Table 10. There were 4706 intensive PK samples and 2770 sparse PK samples included in the original 
population PK analysis from one Phase 1/2 patient study and five Phase 1 healthy subject studies. 
After including PK data from Studies 20190500 and 20200199, additional 328 intensive PK samples 
from healthy subjects were included in the updated population PK analysis.  
Table 10: Number of participants for study 20170543 included in the population PK analysis 
The final model structure is a two-compartment disposition model with three transit compartments and 
a first order elimination. In order to describe the observed non-linear dose-exposure relationship and 
the induction effect following multiple dosing, the model was parameterised with different relative 
bioavailability values (F1) by doses using 960 mg dose as reference. Changes in exposure due to the 
induction effect were modeled using an exponential function with a first order rate coefficient 
parameter (KIND_F), such that the relative bioavailability (F1) and clearance (CL) were modulated by 
KIND_F from baseline (F1BS and CLBS) to steady state of the induction (F1SS and CLSS).  
Relative bioavailability (F1, reference fixed to 1 for 960 mg QD dosing) at sotorasib doses of 180, 360, 
480, 720, and 960 mg at baseline (day 1) and steady-state of induction effect was less than dose 
proportional varying between 4.95 and 1.53 (180 and 960 mg, respectively) at day 1 and between 
4.58 and 1.00 at steady state. The induction effect on F1 seems to be higher at higher doses.  
Sotorasib apparent CL was estimated by the model to increase by 91 % at steady-state relative to day 
1 over time while the F1 was estimated to decrease by 35 % over time. The induction half-life 
corresponding to the estimated induction rate constant of 0.00845 1/h is 3.4 days, suggesting the 
induction reaches its state-steady in 2-3 weeks. The model-predicted and observed Ctrough (pre-dose 
sotorasib concentration in NSCLC patients receiving 960 mg Sotorasib in the first 5 cycles) over time 
are presented in Figure 5 below.

The co-administration with PPIs and high-fat meal were found to have an effect on bioavailability F for 
both and on ka for a high-fat meal. 
The updated final model is a three-compartment model with first order absorption. A delay in 
absorption is described using two transit models with the same rate constant (KA). Like in the previous 
model, a time-dependent increase in clearance was included by an exponential function with a first 
order rate coefficient parameter (KIND). Again, different relative bioavailability (F1) for different doses 
were applied (reference dose: 960 mg) with induction effect (=KIND), leading to bioavailability values 
from 1 (960 mg) to 4.66 (180 mg). Interindividual variability (IIV) were found for on KA (67.6 %CV), 
V2 (54.4 %CV), CL (54.8 %CV). The following covariates were identified: albumin, race, gender, 
baseline tumour size (categorical) on CL, high-fat meal on KA, use of PPI and High-fat meal on F1, and 
gender on V2. A combined error model was selected (exponential = 0.622 (2.91% RSE), additive = 
2.26 (109 % RSE)). As opposed to the previous model, ECOG baseline was not found a statistically 
significant covariate on CL anymore. 
Sotorasib has shown time-dependent induction of CYP3A4 in in vitro studies. In study 20170543, 
sotorasib exposure decreased after repeated dosing. In the midazolam sub-study, midazolam exposure 
was decreased after co-administrated with sotorasib following 14 days of repeated sotorasib dosing, 
suggesting possible autoinduction of CYP3A4 by sotorasib. The autoinduction of CYP3A4 enzyme, which 
may be present in the gut and liver, may reduce relative bioavailability (F1) and increase clearance 
(CL) of sotorasib. To model the induction effect on F1 and CL, the time-dependent effect was described 
by an exponential function with a first-order rate coefficient parameter (KIND).

• 
Renal impairment 
No formal PK study was performed to investigate the potential effect of renal impairment on the PK of 
sotorasib. Besides, this effect was investigated and tested as a covariate in the population PK model.  
A slight decrease in clearance of sotorasib was observed patients with moderate renal impairment. 
However, it should be noted that the number of these patients (n=37, 7.54 % of all patients) was 
relatively smaller compared to those with mild renal impairment and normal renal function. No 
information was provided for patients with severe renal impairment.  
No PK/clinical data in patients with severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease are available. 
• 
Hepatic impairment 
No formal PK study was performed to investigate the potential effect of hepatic impairment on the PK 
of sotorasib. Besides, this effect was investigated and tested as a covariate in the population PK model.

The degree of hepatic impairment (i.e. mild or moderate) seem not to affect the clearance of sotorasib 
markedly. However, it should be noted that the number of these patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment was low (n=3, 0.6 % of all patients) precluding any valid conclusion from the population 
analysis regarding this subgroup. No information was provided for patients with severe hepatic 
impairment. Thus these results require cautious interpretation. Moreover, these results are based on a 
population PK model that is currently not considered reliable, thus are not conclusive at the time being. 
• 
Gender 
Sex was found a statistically significant covariate on CL and V2. Simulations predicted that the 
differences were associated with an increase exposure for the female population (+24 % in Cmax,ss and 
+19 % in AUCtau,ss).

Race 
Asians showed a slightly higher clearance of sotorasib, associated with slight increase in exposure. The 
differences in CL and V2 between Japanese and non-Japanese Asian patients seem limited.

Higher ECOG score and greater tumour size at baseline, were associated with lower clearance and 
higher exposure. Patients had a higher exposure compared to healthy volunteers. Thus, some patients 
may require dose adjustments. Using the updated model, ECOG baseline was not found a statistically 
significant covariate on CL anymore.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Effect of other drug on sotorasib (victim drug) 
In vitro studies showed sotorasib, parent drug, was substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp.  
Co administration of sotorasib with multiple doses of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampicin) decreased 
sotorasib Cmax by 35% and AUC by 51%.  
CYP3A4 contribution to sotorasib metabolism was shown to be moderate, of roughly 30%.  
Effect of sotorasib on other drugs (perpetrator drug) 
Sotorasib was identified in vitro as CYP3A4 time-dependent inhibitor and inducer. The net effect was 
further investigated in Part 2e of Study 20170543 conducted with midazolam, CUP3A4 probe 
substrate. Co administration of sotorasib with midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) decreased 
midazolam Cmax by 48% and AUC by 53%. 
In addition to sotorasib CYP3A4 induction potential, sotorasib was in vitro an inducer of CYP enzymes 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. No induction of CYP1A2 was observed after incubation with 
sotorasib (Study 150536).  
Sotorasib was also identified in vitro as an inhibitor of CYP2D6. In addition to the initial PBPK model 
submitted to describe sotorasib following single administration, a new model was submitted to describe 
sotorasib PK at steady state in NSCLC patients by decreasing the apparent clearance (CL/F) from 37.5 
L/h, the single dose model value to 25 L/h to fit steady-state PK data in target population. 
Consequently, depending on the dosing regimen single or multiple administrations, the model to use 
varies. The provided model was not demonstrated to be able to robustly describe sotorasib PK, 
following single and multiple dose administration, and across dose levels. Therefore, interaction 
prediction with CYP2D6 based on the proposed PBPK model cannot be endorsed. (See discussion on 
clinical pharmacology).  
Sotorasib was identified in vitro as an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3.  
With regards to P-gp inhibition, in study 20190315 conducted in healthy subjects, digoxin showed an 
increase in digoxin exposure by 21% (ratio of 1.214 with 90% CI = 1.105, 1.334) and an increase in 
Cmax by 91% (ratio of 1.914 with 90% CI = 1.574, 2.328). 
MATE1 and MATE2-K inhibition was also evaluated in study 20190317 conducted in healthy subjects 
with co-administration of metformin. The results showed sotorasib did not affect metformin PK (based 
on AUC last and AUC inf with the estimated ratios of 0.990 (90% CI 0.914, 1.073) and 0.985 (90% CI 
0.909, 1.067). Therefore, sotorasib is not expected to affect substrate transport mediated by 
MATE1/MATE2K or OCT2.

Exposure-response (ER) analyses for efficacy and safety of sotorasib in patients with advanced solid 
tumours with a specific KRAS mutation were performed (report 152922). PK exposure metrics 
predicted by the PopPK analysis (AUCtau,ss, Cmax,ss, Ctrough,ss) were used as input for both analyses. 
Data from Phase 1/2 study 20170543 were analysed. The analysis dataset for ER analysis for efficacy 
and safety consisted of patient data with a phase 1 data cut-off date of July 6th, 2020 and a phase 2 
data cut-off date of September 1st, 2020. NSCLC patients with at least one post-treatment plasma 
concentration measurement and one evaluation of corresponding efficacy endpoints were included in 
the ER analysis for efficacy.  
Exposure-response-efficacy 
PD endpoints consisted of ORR, DCR, PFS, OS, DOR and TTR (time to respond) and BTSR (best tumour 
size response). Time to respond (TTR) and best tumour size response (BTSR) were evaluated using 
linear regression. Objective response rate (ORR), and disease control rate (DCR) were evaluated using 
logistic regression model. Time-to-event endpoints progression free survival (PFS), overall survival 
(OS), and duration of response (DOR) were evaluated using a Cox proportional hazard model or an 
abbreviated to Cox model. 
The dataset for efficacy consisted of 248 NSCLC patients with at least one post-treatment plasma 
concentration and at least one evaluation of efficacy endpoints from Study 20170543. The dataset for 
safety consisted of 421 patients with solid tumours (n=248 with NSCLC, n=113 CRC, and n=60 other 
types of solid tumours). 
Graphical analyses for efficacy reveal that smaller tumour size (< 70 mm), ECOG=0 were associated 
with a longer progression free survival and overall survival. Kaplan Meier curves for PFS, OS and DOR 
with AUC in NSCLC patients indicate that increasing exposure is not associated with an improved 
outcome.  
Moreover, an increase in exposure was associated with decreasing response for BOR, ORR, DCR, OS, 
and PFS and it seems that exposure and dose are not correlated to efficacy (e.g. baseline sum of lesion 
diameters, brain metastasis) as shown in  
 for BOR and Error! Reference source not found. for ORR and DCR.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Sotorasib, a new chemical entity, is an orally available, first in class small molecule that specifically 
binds and irreversibly inhibits the KRASp.G12C mutant protein.  
Sotorasib is a BCS class IV drug, with probably very low absolute bioavailability due to a marked pre-
systemic elimination process and low solubility at intestinal pH. The drug exhibits a pronounced 
nonlinear PK behaviour and is extensively metabolised mainly by CYP3A4. Three metabolites (M10, 
M18 and M24) were investigated during the clinical development programme, mainly M24. 
Based on the food effect study (and substudy in patients), the applicant recommends that sotorasib 
can be administered with or without food. In healthy volunteers (HV) or patients following a 360 mg 
dose, a high fat meal was associated with an increase of AUC of 38% and 75% respectively. Whereas 
the study in HV is adequately designed, results from the patient sub-study should be viewed 
cautiously. The applicant was asked to discuss if an increase in the AUC by at least 38% is clinically 
relevant when sotorasib is administered with a high fat meal. The increase AUC of 38% was not 
discussed. Nevertheless, the applicant provided an in-depth discussion related to the safety events 
observed in the patients that received sotorasib in the fed/fasted states however, given the number of 
subjects in each state (14 vs 200), no clear conclusions can be drawn. 
In the mass-balance study (720 mg single dose) sotorasib accounted only for 22.2% of circulating 
radioactivity. Exposure to sotorasib decreases over time, presumably due to autoinduction of 
metabolism, whereas exposure to metabolites is expected to increase. It is unfortunate that the mass-
balance study was conducted using a single dose even though it was recommended in the CHMP 
scientific advice to conduct the study at steady state to mimic the therapeutic situation. Such design 
would have been helpful to assess the accumulation potential of sotorasib’s main metabolites. 
Presently the applicant has not presented reliable data on metabolite accumulation following 
administration of multiple doses. Therefore, the accumulation of sotorasib metabolites should be 
investigated particularly during the ongoing dose comparison study (Recommendation).  
Sotorasib exhibited nonlinear pharmacokinetics over a range of single and multiple oral administration 
doses studied between 180 to 960 mg QD as Cmax and AUC0-24 hour were less than dose 
proportional. The average Cmax and AUC0-24h values following multiple doses were similar for all dosing 
regimens from 180 mg QD to 960 mg QD. Exposure to sotorasib decreases over time following 960 mg 
QD dosing regimen until steady state is reached. Steady state plasma concentrations were achieved by 
approximately 3 weeks across the phase 1 and phase 2 clinical studies across all sotorasib doses (see 
section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Co-administration of sotorasib with a PPI (omeprazole) or an H2 receptor antagonist (famotidine) led 
to a decrease in sotorasib concentrations. Co-administration of PPIs and H2 receptor antagonists with 
sotorasib is not recommended because the impact on sotorasib efficacy is unknown. If treatment with 
an acid-reducing agent is required, sotorasib should be taken 4 hours before or 10 hours after 
administration of a local antacid (see sections 4.2 and 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Co-administration of multiple-dose itraconazole (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) did not increase 
sotorasib exposures to a clinically significant extent. No dose adjustment of sotorasib is recommended 
when co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
Co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, enzalutamide, mitotane, 
phenytoin and St. John’s wort) with sotorasib is not recommended because they may decrease 
sotorasib exposure. 
Sotorasib is a moderate CYP3A4 inducer. Co administration of sotorasib with CYP3A4 substrates led to 
a decrease in their plasma concentrations, which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates. 
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021  
Page 57/147 
 
 
 
 
Co-administration of sotorasib with CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices, including but 
not limited to alfentanil, ciclosporin, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, hormonal 
contraceptives, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus and tacrolimus, should be avoided. If co-administration 
cannot be avoided, adjust the CYP3A4 substrate dosage in accordance with the current summary of 
product characteristics. 
In vitro data indicated that sotorasib may have the potential to induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19; the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. When sotorasib is co-administered with 
medicinal products metabolised by these enzymes, appropriate monitoring is recommended. 
Interactions of sotorasib with CYP2D6 substrates was investigated by in silico approaches. Two PBPK 
models were presented to describe sotorasib PK following single dose in heathy populations and 
multiple dose in NSCLC patients respectively. To describe sotorasib PK at steady-state in target 
population, the apparent clearance (CL/F) was reduced from 37.5 L/h, the single dose model value to 
25 L/h to fit steady-state PK data in target population. The use of two different models depending on 
the dosing regimen is not considered acceptable, especially considering the decrease in clearance at 
steady-state was attributed to sotorasib auto-induction which may be accounted by PBPK models, 
given their mechanistic nature. In addition, the platform qualification for CYP2D6 inhibition, which 
enzyme is subject to polymorphism, is considered insufficiently qualified. As a consequence, the 
following data has been reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC: in vitro data indicated that sotorasib may 
have the potential to inhibit CYP2D6, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. When 
sotorasib is co-administered with CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol), 
appropriate monitoring is recommended. 
In vitro data indicated that sotorasib may have the potential to inhibit BCRP; the clinical relevance of 
these findings is unknown. When sotorasib is co-administered with BCRP substrates (e.g. 
methotrexate, mitoxantrone, topotecan and lapatinib), appropriate monitoring is recommended. 
Co-administration of sotorasib with P gp substrates with narrow therapeutic indices is not 
recommended. If co administration cannot be avoided, adjust the P gp substrate dosage in accordance 
with the current summary of product characteristics. 
The applicant is recommended to conduct a clinical drug-drug interaction study to investigate the effect 
of coadministration of sotorasib on the pharmacokinetics of a BCRP substrate (rosuvastatin) the MAH 
shall submit the final clinical study report of a phase I, open-label, fixed sequence crossover study in 
healthy subjects (Recommendation). 
One population PK analysis and two ER analysis were performed. The population PK model was not 
considered reliable. Consequently the ER analysis based on this model cannot be considered reliable. 
An updated population PK model was submitted during the procedure but not considered robust 
(parameter estimates with low precision, and diagnostic plots revealing lack of descriptive and 
predictive performance) and not considered reliable to simulate doses less than 960 mg. A population

mg vs. 960 mg) should be conducted. If deemed appropriate, the SmPC will be updated according to 
the results of the refined model using the dose comparison data part of Study 20170543 (240 mg vs. 
960 mg) (Recommendation). To this end the applicant agrees to submit such analysis, the refined 
model is expected until 30 September 2023.  
The applicant has not conducted dedicated PK studies in special populations. The effects of impaired 
renal and hepatic function and other intrinsic factors were evaluated only in the population PK analysis.  
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild renal impairment (creatine clearance, 
CrCL, ≥ 60 mL/min). Sotorasib has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe renal 
impairment (CrCL < 60 mL/min). Therefore, caution should be exercised when treating patients with

moderate, severe and end stage renal impairment. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients 
with mild hepatic impairment (AST or ALT < 2.5 × ULN or total bilirubin < 1.5 × ULN). However, 
administration of sotorasib in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment is not 
recommended. The applicant will conduct a formal PK study in subjects with hepatic impairment (Study 
20200362) (see RMP). 
The claimed dose of 960 mg QD is not soundly justified from a PK perspective. On 09 March 2021 the 
applicant proposed an update for a dose comparison part for patients with NSCLC to be added to Study 
20170543 (phase 2 Part B). Sotorasib has demonstrated a non-linear pharmacokinetic profile, with 
responses noted at all dose levels ranging from 180 mg to 960 mg. A dose of 240 mg QD has been 
selected for further exploration in this dose comparison part of the study to investigate whether a 
lower dose can be as safe and efficacious as 960 mg QD. The applicant proposes to use 240 mg QD 
(administered as two 120 mg tablets) as the lower dose in this dose-comparison study. Exposure at 
the 240 mg dose is expected to be above the concentration associated with 90 % inhibition in vitro and 
is anticipated to generate an exposure profile where robust clinical responses have been observed in 
advanced cancer patients. This dose would have a meaningfully different tablet burden compared with 
the higher dose (2 tablets versus 8 tablets). From the PK perspective, the investigation of lower doses 
than 960 mg are endorsed and highly encouraged. The results of the ongoing dose comparison part of 
Study 20170543 (phase 2 Part B) investigating a 240 mg QD dose will be submitted 
(Recommendation). 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the PKs of sotorasib have been characterised in healthy subjects and in the target patients 
based on formal phase 1 and 2 studies. The claimed dose of 960 mg QD is not soundly justified from a 
PK perspective. To this end the results from the ongoing dose comparison part for patients with NSCLC 
to be added to Study 20170543 (phase 2 Part B) where a 240 mg QD dose will be investigated, are 
awaited.  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The Phase-1 portion of the study 20170543 was the first-in-human (FIH) study of sotorasib and was 
conducted in 2 parts:  part 1 - dose exploration and part 2 - dose expansion.  
Part 1 (dose exploration) had several dose cohorts that evaluated sotorasib administered under 
different conditions in subjects with KRAS p.G12C-mutated advanced solid tumours: 
-  Part 1a: escalating dosing of once daily (QD) sotorasib monotherapy administered orally  (180 
mg to 960 mg). 
-   Part 1b: 480 mg sotorasib monotherapy twice daily (BID) administered with food.   
-  Part 1d:  960 mg sotorasib QD administered with food. 
- 
In part 1c cohort, 360, 720, and 960 mg sotorasib QD in combination with  pembrolizumab 
were evaluated in subjects with NSCLC (combination therapy). 
The phase 1 dose expansion (part 2) was to open when the MTD and/or a RP2D had been determined 
in part 1. Part 2 comprised several cohorts that evaluated sotorasib administered under different 
conditions in subjects with KRAS p.G12C-mutated advanced solid tumours: 
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021  
Page 59/147 
 
 
 
 
-  Part 2a: 960 mg sotorasib monotherapy QD. 
-  Part 2b: 480 mg sotorasib monotherapy BID administered with food. 
-  Part 2d:  960 mg sotorasib QD administered with food. 
- 
In Part 2c, sotorasib QD in combination with pembrolizumab will be evaluated in subjects with 
NSCLC 
-  Part 2e: evaluated safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, PK and pharmacodynamic 
parameters of 960 mg QD dosing for sotorasib monotherapy in subjects with previously 
untreated KRAS p.G12C-mutated metastatic NSCLC.  In addition, approximately 4 to 6 
subjects enrolled in part 2e could participate in a drug-drug interaction substudy of sotorasib 
with midazolam. 
The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sotorasib and to estimate the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of sotorasib in adult 
subjects with KRAS p.G12C-mutated advanced solid tumours.  
The secondary objectives of this study were the evaluation of tumour response (for all study parts, 
except part 2e) and pharmacokinetics.  
The full analysis set included all subjects who received ≥ 1 dose of sotorasib and had ≥1 or more 
measurable lesions at baseline as assessed by blinded independent central review using RECIST 1.1. 
The monotherapy phase-1 ORR analysis set included all subjects in the phase-1 full analysis set who 
had the opportunity to be followed for ≥ 7 weeks starting from day 1. 
The RP2D for sotorasib was determined to be 960 mg QD, which was the highest dose tested.

•  Treatments 
Sotorasib was provided as 120 mg tablets and was administered orally once daily (QD) and without 
interruption (ie, no planned off-treatment days). The RP2D was 960 mg PO QD.  
Daily treatment with sotorasib in phase 2 was to continue without interruption) until disease 
progression, treatment intolerance, withdrawal of consent, or death. 
•  Objectives 
For the phase 2 portion of the study, the  primary objective was to evaluate the objective response rate 
(ORR) for sotorasib as monotherapy in subjects with KRAS p.G12C-mutated advanced solid tumours. 
Secondary objectives for both portions of the study included other measures of sotorasib  efficacy 
(endpoints of duration of response, disease control rate, time to response,  progression-free survival 
[PFS], and overall survival [OS]), safety, and pharmacokinetics.

•  Sample size 
Approximately 250 subjects were to be enrolled in phase 2 (at least 105 subjects with NSCLC and 60 
subjects with CRC). The phase 2 part of the study targeted an ORR higher than a prespecified 
benchmark rate to be excluded. The threshold was based on the lower limit of the 95% CI for the 
observed ORR for each tumour type (NSCLC or CRC). 
For subjects with NSCLC, a large phase 3 clinical trial (REVEL) in the second-line treatment after 
disease progression on platinum-based therapy showed an ORR of 23% (95% CI: 20, 26) with 
ramucirumab plus docetaxel treatment (Garon et al, 2014; Cyramza Prescribing Information). Thus, 
the benchmark ORR to exclude was selected as 23% for the NSCLC study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021  
Page 62/147 
 
 
 
 
For subjects with CRC, while treatment with regorafenib or TAS 102 in subjects who had ≥ third-line 
treatment the ORRs of 1% to 4% were observed. These therapies had also demonstrated survival 
benefits (Li et al, 2015; Mayer et al, 2015; Grothey et al, 2013). 
To justify the use of the surrogate endpoint ORR in the Phase 2 study for the subjects with CRC, a 
higher benchmark ORR was selected. Thus, the benchmark ORR to exclude was selected as 10% for 
the CRC study. 
A sample size of 105 subjects for NSCLC and 60 subjects with CRC provide approximately a 90% 
probability that the lower limit of the ORR 95% CI exceeds the tumour-specific benchmark ORR. 
The minimum observed ORRs that would exclude the benchmark ORR with 105 subjects with NSCLC 
and 60 subjects with CRC are 32% and 20%, respectively. No benchmark ORR was set for the other 
tumour types because of expected low enrolment.

•  Statistical methods 
Primary endpoint analyses 
The primary analysis of the phase 2 portion of the study estimated ORR (CR+PR) measured by CT or 
MRI and assessed by RECIST 1.1 by BICR. The analysis was performed by tumour type. For NSCLC, a 
benchmark rate was selected as 23% based on a phase 3 trial (REVEL) for second-line treatment after 
disease progression on platinum-based therapy, which showed a 23% ORR with ramucirumab + 
docetaxel. According to the protocol and SAP, the primary NSCLC analysis was to be considered 
successful if the 95% confidence interval excluded the 23% pre-specified benchmark rate, 
corresponding to an ORR estimate ≥ 32%. 
The percentage of subjects with an OR in Phase 2 ORR Analysis Set were summarised along with a 
Clopper-Pearson exact confidence interval. Subjects without a post-baseline tumour assessment were 
considered as non-responders. 
BICR was used for the primary analysis, with investigator assessment used for sensitivity analysis. 
Concordance between central review and investigator assessments was summarised by tumour type. 
Secondary endpoint analyses 
•  Disease control rate (DCR) was summarised as for ORR 
• 
• 
Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and duration of response (DOR) were 
summarised with Kaplan-Meier median, quartiles and rates for selected time points. DOR was 
summarised for subjects who achieved confirmed partial or complete response only 
Time to response (TTR) was summarised for subjects who achieved a confirmed partial or 
complete response only, with mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum 
The censoring rules for PFS are described in the table below: 
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021  
Page 63/147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DOR censoring rules were following the same strategy as for PFS. Regarding OS, subjects who did not 
die were censored at the date of last contact. 
Futility interim analyses 
The interim futility analyses were conducted in a continuous manner using Bayesian predictive 
probability for NSCLC. It began after approximately 25 response-evaluable subjects, defined as 
received at least 1 dose of sotorasib and had at least 7 weeks response data starting from day 1. 
Following this initial interim analysis, subsequent interim analyses were performed after every 10 
subjects becomes response evaluable. The futility analyses were reviewed at interim futility data 
review team (DRT) meetings. 
The Go criterion was met if the probability that the true ORR exceeds the benchmark ORR is ≥ to a high 
probability of: 
•  Go criterion for NSCLC: probability [ORR > 0.23] ≥ 80% 
•  Go Criterion for CRC: probability [ORR > 0.1] ≥ 95% 
Given the existing observed data during the continuous monitoring stage, the Bayesian predictive 
probability was obtained by calculating the probability of reaching a Go Criterion should the treatment 
group be enrolled and evaluated to the maximum planned final sample size of 105 NSCLC subjects. 
Futility was met if it was predicted that there is a small probability of reaching a Go Criterion upon full 
enrolment of 105 NSCLC given the existing observed data. A non-informative prior distribution of beta 
(1, 1) was used. Futility for the NSCLS was when the predictive probability of a Go decision was below 
5%. 
The analysis population for the primary endpoint: 
Phase 2 full analysis set  
All subjects in phase 2 who received ≥1 dose of sotorasib and have 1 or more measurable lesions at 
baseline as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1. This analysis set was to be used to evaluate response-
related endpoints in the primary and final analyses.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The primary support for the proposed indication is based on efficacy results from subjects with KRAS 
p.G12C-mutated advanced NSCLC enrolled in the pivotal phase 2 portion of Study 20170543 
(CodeBreaK 100). This study is an ongoing phase 1/2, open label, single-group study of sotorasib in 
subjects with KRAS p.G12C-mutated advanced or metastatic NSCLC, colorectal cancer, and other solid 
tumours. Further efficacy support is provided based on the results from the phase-1 portion assessing 
sotorasib as monotherapy.  
Main study 
Phase-1 portion  
The Phase-1 portion of study 20170543 was the first-in-human (FIH) study of sotorasib and was 
conducted in 2 parts:  part 1 - dose exploration and part 2 - dose expansion. During the dose 
exploration (part 1) of the phase 1, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed in any cohort but the 
RP2D for sotorasib was determined to be 960 mg QD, which was the highest dose tested. However, 
Sotorasib has demonstrated a non-linear pharmacokinetic profile (see section 2.6.1 
Pharmacokinetics), with an important dose non-linearity. Responses were observed at all dose 
levels from 180 mg to 960 mg and a significant inverse ER relationship was observed. The 960  mg 
QD dose used in the Phase-2 portion of the study 20170543 is thus not considered justified.  
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021  
Page 96/147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Then, since the 960 mg QD dose is not justified, the applicant has planned to add a dose 
comparison part (part B) to the phase-2 portion of the study 20170543 in order to determine the 
optimal dose in subjects with previously treated locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic KRAS 
p.G12C mutant advanced NSCLC. The dose of 240 mg QD has been selected for further exploration 
in this dose comparison part of the study. The results of this study extension are highly relevant for 
dose optimisation. 
Phase-2 portion  
The target population for the pivotal study were adult patients with advanced solid tumours (NSCLC, 
CRC, and other solid tumours) and the enrolment was restricted to subjects with KRAS p.G12C-
mutation as assessed by molecular testing. The pivotal study population for the currently claimed 
indication were patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) with centrally confirmed KRAS p.G12C mutation in pre-dose tumour biopsy (N=126 
patients). By the inclusion criteria the study subjects had ≥ 1 prior line(s) of anticancer therapy, 
progressed on prior line(s) of therapy, had measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria and had ECOG 
performance status of ≤ 1. 
The inclusion criteria of disease progression after received prior line therapies (checkpoint inhibitor, 
platinum-based therapy or their combination, targeted therapy against oncogenic driver mutations) 
were not defined in detail regarding the treatment duration or the number of the progressed tumour 
locations or their site and whether the clinical or radiologic progression was applied as a progression 
criteria. In the definition of measurable lesion, radiotherapy was not excluded and the applicant was 
requested to clarify how this could have potentially affected the evaluation of ORR results. 
Uncertainties remain in the response evaluation in several patients in which the previous radiotherapy 
may have influenced the response evaluation. However, these uncertainties are not expected to 
substantially impact the key outcomes of the study and hence this issue is not pursued further.  
Targeted biological therapies included anti-VEGF (bevacizumab, ramucirumab), anti PD-1, anti PD-L1, 
or other checkpoint inhibitor (atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, durvalumab, ipilimumab, 
MedImmune D6840, TSR-042), and RANK-L inhibitor (denosumab) targeted biologic. The following are 
the targeted small molecules that were used: capmatinib, nintedanib, trametinib, vorolanib, RMC-
4630, sitravatinib, cobimetinib. It is considered that the difference in ORR between subgroups of 
subjects with or without brain metastases is mostly prognostic. This is supported by historical evidence 
of poor outcomes in patients with brain metastases compared to patients without. Ongoing study 
20190135 in subjects with NSCLC and brain metastases should further inform the effect in this 
population. On the other hand, no scientific basis could be found by the applicant for differences 
observed between subgroups of patients with/without prior platinum-based chemotherapy and patients 
with/without both prior platinum-based chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 or anti PD-L1 therapies. These 
differences are most likely observed due to the small sample sizes of these subgroups. These 
subgroups (amongst other baseline characteristics) will be explored in the larger phase 3 study. 
The applicant noted that oncogenic KRAS mutations, including the KRAS p.G12C mutation, rarely occur 
concomitantly with other actionable mutations. However, co-mutations were reported in 39 subjects 
(31.1%) and among them actionable driver mutations were identified in 6 patients; 3 patients (2.4%) 
with EGFR mutation, 2 patients (1.6%) with MET mutation and 1 patient (0.8%) with BRAF mutation. 
No subjects had co-mutations in ALK or ROS. Since the mutation data reported by the study centre did 
not provide specific mutations, actionability of the mutation is unknown. While ideally patients should 
get targeted therapy early in their treatment course if their tumour has an actionable driver mutation, 
these 6 subjects did not receive it as their first line of therapy and 4 of these subjects had not received 
a targeted therapy after 3 lines of therapy. Further information about the previous treatments of the 
subjects having actionable driver mutations was received from the applicant as requested during the 
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021  
Page 97/147 
 
 
 
 
evaluation. Based on the applicant´s responses, the treatment outcome was not negatively affected by 
these co-mutations, even though the data is limited. There were almost as many patients with PD-L1 
expression <1%, ≥1% and <50% and ≥50% with respectively 33 subjects (26.2%), 24 subjects 
(19.0%) and 35 subjects (27.8%). For 34 subjects (27.0%) the PD-L1 expression was unknown. 
Indeed, in Study 20170543, PD-L1 expression level was not required data. Therefore, this information 
was not available for every enrolled subject even though queries were made in an attempt to collect 
this information. Of these 34 subjects with PD-L1 status “unknown,” 88.2% (30 subjects) had prior PD-
1 and/or PD-L1 therapy, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, similar to the entire study 
population. Among the 4 subjects who did not receive checkpoint inhibitor therapy, all 4 received at 
least platinum doublet chemotherapy. Overall, the significance of PD-L1 expression on the outcome of 
the pivotal trial remains unclear and this topic needs to be addressed in further clinical studies, 
including the ongoing Phase III study. 
All subjects in the Phase 2 trial received sotorasib as monotherapy administered orally 960 mg 
(8 tablets of 120 mg) once daily (QD) without interruption until disease progression. 
The primary objective of the Phase 2 trial was the evaluation of tumour objective response rate (ORR) 
(CR + PR) assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria of sotorasib as monotherapy in subjects with KRAS p.G12C-
mutated advanced tumours (NSCLC, CRC, and other tumour types). The secondary objectives and 
endpoints were DOR, DCR, TTR, PFS (including also 6-month and 12-month outcome), and OS 
(including also 12-month OS). In addition, the PK parameters (Cmax, AUC, Cl, tmax) were measured. 
Overall, the proposed endpoints selected as well as the objectives seem reasonable, though, 
interpretation of OS and PFS results is hampered by the study design. 
The choice of ORR as the primary endpoint is justified in a Phase 2 single-arm study. It is 
acknowledged that the selected primary endpoint in contrast to OS excludes the impact of natural 
history of the tumour unrelated to the intervention interfering the outcome. The DOR secondary 
endpoint is important to contextualise the primary outcome, but it has the same limitations as the 
primary endpoint regarding the intrinsic factors in trial setting potentially biasing the evaluation against 
published data. 
Overall, it seems that the current study population has approximately a 10% lower proportion of 
patients with a high PD-L1 expression compared to the cohort in the RWE studies submitted to support 
the claim for unmet medical need. The significance of PD-L1 expression on the outcome in this this trial 
is unclear and this topic needs to be addressed in further clinical studies, including the ongoing Phase 
III study. This is of prime importance while knowing that the prognosis of NSCLC is highly dependent 
also on the PD-L1 level, which contributes to the response rate obtained. 
The sample size for the NSCLC group was based on the approximation of a 90% probability that the 
lower limit of the ORR 95% CI exceeds the tumour-specific benchmark ORR of 23% derived from the 
REVEL study in the second-line treatment setting with ramucirumab plus docetaxel after disease 
progression on platinum-based therapy (Garon et al, 2014). The use of the REVEL study, although 
seeming to have more favourable study population compared to the current study in terms of 
treatment lines and smoking history, leaves many uncertainties regarding the disease progression 
potential (e.g. prognostic PD-L1 expression level and various driver gene co-mutations were not 
studied in the reference study) and by lacking adequate baseline information to compare and justify 
the similar characteristics in the study populations. The REVEL study was also conducted before 
immunotherapies were approved which makes hard to contextualise the relevance of these data. In 
the CHMP scientific advice the targeted lower limit for the ORR of 23% was not agreed on and due to 
the inter-trial setting, an ORR of at least 32% [0.24 – 0.42] was considered more suitable 
(EMEA/H/SA/4171/1/2019/II).

The minimum sample size for the observed ORRs to exclude 32% benchmark point-estimate was 
estimated to be 105 study subjects for the advanced NSCLC.  
Statistical methods and endpoint definitions are appropriate. However, almost all patients enrolled in 
the NSCLC group (123/126) were included in the FAS population with only 3 patients being excluded 
due to the non-measurable lesion, who were included in the study by an obvious protocol violation. 
The statistical analysis plan was amended four times and in three of these after the first patient was  
The reported protocol violations are not expected to have a significant impact on the efficacy 
evaluation. The treatment compliance in the NSCLC group was high with only one patient discontinuing 
due to non-compliance. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 126 subjects with NSCLC were enrolled and all the 126 subjects received sotorasib. Among 
them, 123 subjects were included in the full analysis set (FAS), and 3 subjects were excluded as they 
did not have ≥ 1 measurable lesion at baseline according to BICR. However, the dataset used for 
sensitivity analysis of response-related efficacy endpoints using assessment per investigator comprised 
126 subjects. 
Primary endpoint 
As of the DCO of 1 December 2020, the ORR (CR + PR) assessed per RECIST 1.1 by BICR was 37.1 % 
(46 of 124 subjects; 95% CI: 28.6, 46.23) consisting of 3 subjects (2.4%) who achieved CR and 43 
subjects (34.7%) who achieved PR. 
The concordance rates between central review and investigator for objective response, best overall 
response, and disease progression were 82.9%, 72.7%, and 78.0%, respectively at the DCO of 1 
September 2020. The concordance rate for objective response was 83.1% at the DCO of 1 December 
2020. 
Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the consistency of the ORR between subgroups. In the 
context of a single arm study with small sample size in each subgroup, the interpretation of subgroup 
analyses is hampered, and no formal conclusion could be done whether these factors are predictive or 
prognostic. 
Secondary endpoints 
The disease control rate (DCR) (95% Cl) for subjects with NSCLC was relatively high, 99/123 (80.5%, 
95% CI: 72.37, 87.08) with 43.1% of subjects having stable disease, and the time to response was 
short 1.35 (1.2, 6.1) months. The value of the observation is limited with relatively short minimal time 
interval criteria defined for the SD on which DCR was based on.  
As of the 20 June 2021 data cut-off date, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of median (95% CI) DOR for the 
46 objective responders was 11.1 months (6.9, 15.0) months. As of the data cut-off date, the Kaplan-
Meier estimates for DOR at 6, 9, and 12 months were 71.2%, 55.7%, and 45.1%, respectively. The 
Kaplan-Meier estimate of median (95% CI) follow-up time for DOR was 15.3 (15.2, 15.8) months.  
Although the duration of previous treatment response was not collected in Study 20170543, the 
immediate prior treatment start and discontinuation dates were known for all 123 subjects. Based on 
the available data the median duration on treatment was numerically higher for sotorasib (5.5 months, 
95% CI: 4.1, 7.6) than for the previous therapy (4.2 months, 95% CI: 3.0, 5.6). This might indicate at 
least similar treatment response with sotorasib to prior treatment. The applicant did not provide the 
data on correlation between the prior treatment length and the response with sotorasib, but the data 
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021  
Page 99/147 
 
 
 
 
seem to support similar or slightly better response with sotorasib overall, despite it being the later 
treatment line. 
As of the DCO of 1 December 2020 of the 46 responders in the NSCLC group, the median time to 
response was 1.35 (1.2, 10.1) months.  
At the DCO of 1 December 2020, the median PFS was 6.8 months with a median follow-up time of 11 
months (min, max: 0.3, 12.6+) and the 95% CI range from 10.8 to 11.1 months by the Kaplan-Meier 
analysis. Results of subgroup analysis of PFS by central review were presented. However, in the 
context of a single arm study with an overall small study size and some unbalanced subgroups it is 
difficult to draw conclusion. The presented PFS data are also limited due to the short duration of follow-
up. 
At the DCO of 1 December 2020, the median OS was 12.5 months (95% CI: 10.0 NE) by Kaplan-Meier 
analysis. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival was 89.5% (82.7, 93.8) at 3 months, 63.5% (54.3, 
71.4) at 9 months, and 51.4% (41.9, 60.1) at 12 months. Overall, the interpretation of time-to-event 
endpoints (OS and PFS) is hampered by the fact that there is no randomised comparator and, 
therefore, no robust conclusions can be drawn. 
Supportive studies – Phase-1 portion of the study 20170543 
Further efficacy support is provided based on the results from the phase-1 portion assessing sotorasib 
as monotherapy. During the phase-1 portion of study 20170543, 34 subjects with previously treated 
NSCLC received 960 mg QD sotorasib monotherapy (fasted) dose. Since the sotorasib dose used in this 
cohort was identical to the dose used in the phase-2 portion of the study, the efficacy data are 
supportive of the phase 2 NSCLC efficacy data package.  
As of the DCO date (06 July 2020) of 34 subjects with previously treated NSCLC in the monotherapy 
960-mg QD (fasted) dose cohort (parts 1a, 2a), the ORR was 47.1% (95%CI: 29.78, 64.87), 
consisting of 16 subjects (47.1%) who achieved partial responses. No patients achieved a complete 
response. The DCR was 94.1% (95%CI: 80.32, 99.28) with 16 subjects with PR and 16 subjects with 
SD. 
Out of the 16 objective responders, the KM estimate of median DOR was not reached (95%CI: 4.2, 
NE) with a median (range) follow-up time for DOR of 9.0 months (1.5, 15.0). However, due to the low 
number of events with more than two third of patients who were censored at the time of analysis, no 
conclusion can be drawn regarding the expected durability of response. 
The median (range) TTR was 1.41 months (0.8, 8.3). 
As of the DCO date, the KM estimate of median PFS was 5.3 months (95%CI: 3.1, 8.1) with a median 
(range) follow-up time for PFS of 11.1 months (1.2+, 16.30). The KM PFS probability estimate 
(95%CI) was 42.9% (25.5, 59.2) at 6 months and 31.2% (15.6, 48.2) at 12 months. 
The KM estimate of median OS was 7.6 months (95%CI: 6.3, NE) with a median (range) follow-up 
time for OS was 12.2 months (2.5+, 17.1). The Kaplan-Meier estimate (95%CI) of survival was 72.2% 
(53.3, 84.4) at 6 months and 41.2% (23.8, 57.9) at 12 months. 
Moreover, among the 25 subjects treated with the different doses of sotorasib monotherapy (180 mg 
to 720 mg QD [fasted]; phase 1, part 1a and part 2a) in the phase 1 ORR analysis set, 8 subjects 
(32%) had a confirmed partial response. Among these 8 responders, the DOR was at least 3 months in 
7 subjects (87.5%), at least 6 months in 5 subjects (62.5%), at least 9 months in 3 subjects (37.5%), 
at least 12 months in 1 subject (12.5%). 
Overall, efficacy data between the phase 1 and 2 are rather consistent.

In vitro biomarker test 
For NSCLC in the phase-2 portion of study 20170543, the mutation was confirmed by central testing 
(therascreen® KRAS RGQ PCR from Qiagen) prior to enrolment. The baseline tissue samples used were 
archival FFPE blocks or slides, less than 5 years since collection. Baseline plasma samples were 
collected before a subject’s first dose on Cycle 1 Day 1. Total nucleic acids were extracted from the 
FFPE tissue samples, RNA was purified, DNA libraries prepared, and target DNA amplified. Both target-
captured DNA and target-captured RNA were sequenced and used to detect single and multi-nucleotide 
alterations, insertions and deletions, copy number variants, and translocations. Cell-free DNA was 
isolated from plasma samples and sequenced for detection of single nucleotide variants, insertions and 
deletions, fusions and copy number variations. Samples were processed and analysed using standard 
tissue and plasma tests for the genes of interest (EGFR pathway and related genes).  
Moreover, based on the Phase 1 data (with limited sample size), no clear co-mutation or biomarker 
profile was identified to be correlated with response or resistance to sotorasib in NSCLC. However, the 
results of the exploratory biomarker analyses for the phase 2 portion of the study 20170543 have not 
been provided and are now expected to understand the outcome and the prognostic within this 
heterogeneous patient population. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
A waiver was requested for the treatment of children, from birth to ≤ 18 years of age with non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) on the grounds that NSCLC is a condition that predominantly occurs in the 
adult population and the extreme rarity of paediatric tumours with the KRAS p.G12C mutation, and the 
disease or condition for which the specific medicinal product is intended does not occur in the specified 
paediatric population. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
The evidence for efficacy of sotorasib is limited to uncontrolled data from one single arm phase 2 
study. As comprehensive data are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was requested 
by the applicant in the initial submission based on response rate. The current trial is considered 
sufficient to support the conditional marketing authorisation but has limitations in the demonstration of 
longer-term effect and time related endpoints (PFS and OS) remain descriptive. Therefore, additional 
controlled efficacy data on survival endpoints are needed as a SOB. 
To provide more comprehensive data in the proposed indicated population, a confirmatory, active-
controlled, phase 3 study is currently ongoing in the same population of patients. Study 20190009 
(CodeBreaK 200), is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of sotorasib administered at 960 mg 
QD daily versus docetaxel and have the ability to provide confirmatory evidence, provided that a 
successful PFS result is supported by the totality of the data, including a favourable effect on OS /no 
negative trend as described in the CHMP anticancer product guideline. Results from this study are 
intended to provide a comprehensive data package and potentially convert the conditional MA into a 
full MA. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the available data the observed ORR of 37% is considered clinically meaningful in the patient 
population with advanced NSCLC carrying p.G12C mutation, and it is also higher than the ORRs 
observed with non-targeted treatments and docetaxel in overall NSCLC patient population. 
Furthermore, considering that almost all patients in the current study had metastatic disease and had 
already received platinum-based therapy and nearly 91% also the checkpoint inhibitor therapy leading 
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021  
Page 101/147 
 
 
 
 
to the treatment resistant disease, the current response rate is considered relevant in this heavily 
pretreated population.  
DOR of 11.1 months (95% CI 6.9, 15.0) at the latest data cut-off of 21 June 2021, supports clinically 
relevant response duration and clinical benefit.  
Based on these aspects, sotorasib might offer an alternative treatment option for patients who have 
already experienced different chemotherapies with poor response and do not have any standard or 
care treatments available.  
The CHMP considers the following measure necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of sotorasib in the treatment of patients with KRAS G12C-
mutated NSCLC, the MAH should submit the clinical study report for the phase III CodeBreaK 200 
study (Study 20190009) comparing sotorasib versus docetaxel for the treatment of previously treated 
KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC. The clinical study report will be submitted by 31 March 2023.

gastrointestinal disorders (34.6%). Consistent with the primary analysis, the most frequently reported 
(>10%of subjects) treatment-related adverse events in the total monotherapy population by preferred 
term were diarrhoea (22.6%), nausea (11.8%), increased AST (10.7%), and increased ALT (10.5%). 
Adverse drug reactions  
Medical review was based on a broad evaluation of all adverse events (including their severity, onset, 
duration, and outcome), changes in laboratory values, and vital signs. Adverse reactions were 
determined to be those events that were reported ≥ 10% in subjects with any tumour type who were 
treated with sotorasib monotherapy at 960 mg QD. In addition, medical review of all adverse events 
reported was undertaken, with special attention to common events, grade ≥3 and serious adverse 
events. A review of all the frequently occurring adverse events was performed, with consideration of 
the events expected to occur at a particular incidence in patients with known underlying diseases to 
identify an appropriate initial threshold for identifying adverse drug reactions. Based on this review, 
adverse drug reactions for sotorasib were initially selected by evaluating adverse events that occurred 
with a ≥ 15% overall incidence rate, grade ≥ 3 adverse events with a ≥ 2% overall incidence rate, or 
serious adverse events with ≥ 2% overall incidence rate. An assessment was also performed on 
adverse events not meeting any of these thresholds that could represent potentially serious toxicities 
(eg, cardiac and neurological events), or those commonly associated with drug use (eg, rash). 
Additional considerations such as temporal association, biological plausibility, and medical judgment 
were then applied for a probable causal drug event association to determine the final adverse drug 
reactions.

interrupted) or discontinuation of sotorasib were reported for 25 subjects (12.5%) and 9 subjects 
(4.5%), respectively. Consistent with the primary analysis, the most frequently reported (≥1% of 
subjects) hepatotoxicity adverse events leading to discontinuation of sotorasib were increased ALT 
(1.5%), increased AST (1.5%), drug-induced liver injury (1.5%), increased blood ALP (1.0%), and 
increased transaminases (1.0%). Consistent with the primary analysis, the most frequently reported 
(≥ 1% of subjects) hepatotoxicity adverse events leading to dose modification of sotorasib were 
increased ALT (8.0%), increased AST (8.0%), increased blood ALP (3.5%), drug-induced liver injury 
(1.0%), and abnormal hepatic function (1.0%).  
No fatal hepatotoxicity adverse events of interest were reported. 
All Tumour Types, 960 mg Once-daily Fasted 
In subjects treated at 960 mg once-daily for all tumour types, hepatotoxicity adverse events of interest 
were reported for 92 subjects (25.6%). Consistent with the primary analysis, the most frequently

Co-administration of sotorasib with a strong CYP3A4 inducer, proton pump inhibitor, or H2 receptor 
antagonist led to a decrease in sotorasib concentrations. In addition, sotorasib is a moderate CYP3A4 
inducer; coadministration of sotorasib with CYP3A4 substrates led to a decrease in their plasma 
concentrations.

2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
Sotorasib is not yet a marketed product. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety results of sotorasib monotherapy at the intended dose (960 mg once daily) in the proposed 
indication (KRAS p.G12C-mutated NSCLC), are mainly coming from the phase 1/2, open-label study 
20170543. The safety population in the target population of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is 
relatively small, n = 200 with a lack of comparative data and a limited follow-up period. At the latest 
data cut-off date of 01 December 2020, a total of 456 subjects have been exposed to sotorasib 
monotherapy across all doses and tumour types, (colorectal cancer at the intended dose n=87, all 
other tumour types at the intended dose n=72, pool of any tumour type at the intended dose n=359), 
and only 200 of them in NSCLC at the intended dose. 
Supportive safety data from study 20190009 (Phase 3 study of sotorasib versus docetaxel in the 
NSCLC subjects with Mutated KRAS p.G12C), study 20190147 (Phase 1, in Subjects of Chinese 
Descent with Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumours with KRAS p.G12C Mutation) and study 20190135 (in 
combination with tametinib, RMC-4630, afatinib, atezolizumab and panitumumab/FOLFIRI) have been 
provided. All these studies are phase I/II open-label and one-arm treatment trials except the ongoing 
phase 3 study 20190009, evaluating sotorasib versus docetaxel which started on 4th of June 2020. 
However, only 21 subjects received at least 1 dose of sotorasib. At the present time, there is no 
available safety data of sotorasib compared to other available therapies.  
At the latest data cut-off date of 01 December 2020, 141 subjects (70%) with NSCLC treated at 960 
mg once-daily had discontinued treatment; the most frequently reported reason for treatment 
discontinuation was disease progression (54%) and AEs (9%). 
Demographics were generally consistent for subjects treated at the intended dose for all tumour types 
and for the total monotherapy population at any dose. A smaller proportion of subjects with NSCLC 
treated at 960 mg once-daily were < 65 years of age compared with subjects treated at the intended 
dose for all tumour types or with the total monotherapy population at any dose (44.5% versus 54.9% 
and 53.3% respectively). This difference is mainly attributable to the CRC population with subjects that 
were mostly <65 years of age (75%). 
Subjects with NSCLC were treated with sotorasib monotherapy for a median of 24 weeks, with 46% 
and 10% of subjects receiving treatment for ≥6 and ≥12 months, respectively. Exposure was slightly 
lower for all tumour types or the total monotherapy population (median 18.0 weeks, respectively), 
than for subjects with NSCLC.

Mean Relative dose intensity was 90% for NSCLC patients. 
Adverse Events: 98.5% of NSCLC patients (197 of 200 subjects) reported at least 1 TEAE and 68.5% 
of these patients reported TEAEs that were considered drug-related. The incidence of adverse events 
was higher for subjects with NSCLC treated at 960 mg once-daily compared with subjects treated at 
960 mg once-daily for all tumour types and for the total any dose monotherapy population. This 
difference is largely attributable to the lower incidence of adverse events in subjects with colorectal 
cancer treated at 960 mg once-daily; Grade ≥3 TEAEs (61% vs 35.6%), SAEs (52.5% vs 27.6%), 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation of sotorasib (9.0% vs 1.1%), fatal AEs (17.5% vs 2.3%) and related 
grade ≥3 TEAE (20.5% vs 8%). This could be explained by the difference in some baseline 
demographics like age, ECOG status and by the type of prior treatments.  
Most common TEAEs NSCLC population (vs all tumour type at 960 mg once-daily) were diarrhoea 
(43.5% vs 34%), nausea (28% vs 25.2%), fatigue (24.5% vs 20.6%), increased aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) (20% vs 15.6%), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (19% vs 13.9%), 
back pain (19% vs 13.9%), constipation (17.5% vs 13.2%) dyspnoea (16.5% vs 11.1%), vomiting 
(17% vs 17.8%), cough (14% vs 11.4%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (13% vs 9.5%), 
arthralgia (19.5% vs 13.9%), decreased appetite (12% vs 9.5%), anaemia (14.5% vs 12.8%), 
peripheral oedema (12% vs 9.5%), pneumonia (11.5% vs 7.8%), and headache (12.0% vs 10.3%). 
TEAEs any tumour/any dose pooled results did not show any significant difference nor any trend in 
relation to the incidence by the dose. 
The most frequently reported (≥10% of subjects) treatment-related adverse events in subjects with 
NSCLC treated at 960 mg once-daily were diarrhoea (28%), nausea (16%), increased ALT (15.5%), 
increased AST (15.5%), and fatigue (11.5%). However, to which degree a certain TEAE may be 
assumed to be attributable to the underlying disease is difficult to determine given the single-arm 
study design. 
Grade ≥3 adverse events: Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs were reported at least once for 61% (122/200) of the 
total of the NSCLC patients. The most common Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs reported were pneumonia (7.5%), 
increased ALT (7.5%), increased AST (6.5%), pleural effusion (6.0%), and diarrhoea (5.0%). 
Grade ≥ 3 AE were reported for 190 subjects (53%) in the total monotherapy population at the 
recommended dose. The most frequently reported grade≥ 3 adverse events were pneumonia (5.6%) 
and increased ALT (4.5%), AST (4.2%). The profile of the most common AEs of CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 in 
NSCLC patients is comparable with that observed in the total monotherapy pool at the recommended 
dose. The exception was cholangitis, pancreatic carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma metastatic, small 
intestinal obstruction showing a higher frequency in the monotherapy pool, mainly due to other 
tumour’s type prone for these AEs in the monotherapy pool.  
The most frequently reported treatment-related grade ≥3 adverse events in subjects with NSCLC 
treated at 960 mg once-daily by preferred term were increased ALT (7%), increased AST (5.5%), and 
diarrhoea (4%). 
Serious Adverse events: SAE were reported for 105 of 200 subjects with NSCLC (52.5%) treated 
with 960 mg QD sotorasib. The most frequently reported serious adverse events for subjects with 
NSCLC were pneumonia (8%), NSCLC (4.5%), pleural effusion (4%), respiratory failure (4%), back 
pain (3%), dyspnoea (2.5%) and metastatic lung cancer (2%). Most of these serious AEs were not 
considered related to treatment, only 7% of serious AEs were considered related to sotorasib. The 
most frequently reported treatment-related serious adverse events in subjects with NSCLC were 
increased ALT, nausea, and pneumonitis (each 1%). Cases of pneumonitis lead to treatment 
discontinuation. Pneumonitis was added to the list of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Special warning has been included as well in the section 4.4 of the SmPC for monitoring patients for

new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Lumykras should be withhold in 
patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinued if no other potential causes of 
ILD/pneumonitis are identified. 
The types of serious adverse events reported for subjects with CRC and other tumour types (pleural 
effusion, cholangitis, large intestinal obstruction, small intestinal obstruction, pancreatic carcinoma, 
pancreatic carcinoma metastatic) treated with 960 mg QD sotorasib were different to those reported 
for NSCLC subjects, mostly reflecting the type of underlying cancer.  
Deaths: Among all the NSCLC patients, 35 cases of Grade 5 TEAEs (17.5%) were reported; Fatal 
adverse events reported for more than 1 subject included NSCLC (8 subjects [4%]), metastatic lung 
cancer (4 subjects [2%]), respiratory failure (5 subjects [2.5%]), pneumonia n=3 (1.5%), cardiac 
arrest (2 subjects [1%]), and malignant lung neoplasm (2 subjects [1%]). 
For the total monotherapy population at the recommended dose, fatal adverse events were reported 
for 55 subjects (15.3%). Fatal adverse events reported for more than 1 subject included NSCLC (8 
subjects [2.2%]), metastatic lung cancer (4 subjects [1.1%]), metastatic pancreatic carcinoma (6 
subjects [1.7%]), pneumonia n=3 (1.5%), pancreatic carcinoma (4 subjects [1.1%]), respiratory 
failure (5 subjects [1.4%]), cardiac arrest (2 subjects [0.6%]), cholangiocarcinoma (2 subjects 
[0.6%]), and malignant lung neoplasm (2 subjects [0.6%]). The respiratory SOC TEAEs leading to 
death in the pool came mostly from the lung cancer patients. Other Fatal reported AEs were consistent 
with subject’s cancer type.  
A medical review of the fatal adverse events of small intestinal obstruction found both subjects had 
medical history, disease-related pathology, and/or disease progression at the time of fatality. 
All Grade 5 TEAEs were considered treatment unrelated by the investigator.  
Adverse events of special interest: ALT increased (19%) and AST increased (20%) were the most 
common TEAEs among NSCLC patients. Hepatotoxicity adverse events of interest were reported for 57 
subjects (28.5%) among NSCLC patients. Grade≥3 hepatotoxicity adverse events were reported for 30 
subjects (15%). Serious adverse events were reported for 9 subjects (4.5%) with NSCLC. 9 subjects 
(4.5%) had events of interest leading to discontinuation of sotorasib. Sotorasib can cause 
hepatotoxicity, which may lead to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and hepatitis. Patients should be 
then monitored for liver function (ALT, AST, and total bilirubin) prior to the start of treatment, with 
more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase and/or bilirubin elevations. Among 
patients who experienced hepatotoxicity, 38% had hepatotoxicity leading to dose interruption or dose 
reduction. Overall, 26% of patients with hepatotoxicity received concurrent corticosteroids for the 
treatment of hepatotoxicity. The SmPC includes dosing reduction/interruption recommendations based 
on the severity of the laboratory abnormalities, and hepatotoxicity in sections 4.2 and 4.4.  
Renal toxicity was identified as an event of interest. Non-clinical toxicology data suggested the 
potential for renal toxicity. In the integrated safety analysis set for study 20170543, renal toxicity 
adverse events were reported for 34 of 200 subjects (17%) with NSCLC. The most frequently reported 
renal toxicity adverse event was hyponatremia (8%). Six subjects (3%) had grade ≥ 3 renal toxicity 
adverse events; the most frequently reported was hyponatremia (2%). Events of hyponatremia were 
reported as serious adverse events for 2 subjects (1%). One subject (0.5%) had a renal toxicity event 
leading to interruption of sotorasib (hyponatremia); no subjects discontinued sotorasib due to renal 
toxicity adverse events. No fatal renal toxicity adverse events were reported. A total of 5 subjects in 
the monotherapy population had acute kidney injury, including 1 of the 200 subjects with NSCLC. 
The medical review of the 5 events did not suggest causality between sotorasib and the event of acute 
kidney injury. Renal toxicity should continue to be monitored in the postmarketing setting.

No specific pattern in change of blood pressure (BP) was observed in patients treated with sotorasib, 
although there was variability in both systolic and diastolic BP. No significant change in weight was 
observed in patients treated with sotorasib.  
As regards QT prolongation, 500 ms QT absolute QT value and delta QT of 60 ms are the thresholds 
provided in the ICH E14 guideline to state that there is a QT prolonging effect. In subjects with NSCLC, 
elevated post-baseline QTcF intervals were reported infrequently, with maximum post-baseline QTcF 
intervals> 450 to 480 msec or >480 to 500 msec reported for 6.5% and 0.5%, respectively; no 
subjects with NSCLC had a post-baseline QTcF interval >500 msec and no subjects had changes from 
baseline in QTcF interval >60 msec. One subject in the total monotherapy population at any dose had 
a post-baseline QTcF interval > 500 msec. This subject had a baseline QTcF of 481 msec. This subject 
did not have any adverse events at the time of the increased QTcF as of cardiac disorders or nervous 
system disorders, or other potential clinical correlations. 
In addition to the increase in AT, other liver function tests were elevated. Thus, in NSCLC patients, ALP 
was increased in 13% of patients, with Grade ≥3 in 4.2%; and GGT was increased in 3.5% of patients, 
with Grade ≥3 in 2.6%. Total bilirubin was increased in 3.5%, with only 1.6% having a Grade ≥3 AE. 
No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between elderly patients (≥ 65 years old) 
and younger patients. There is limited data on the safety and efficacy of sotorasib in patients aged 75 
years and older but these do not suggest that a dose adjustment is required in elderly patients. 
The incidence of adverse events tended to be numerically lower for men compared with women. 
Whether these represent true differences in toxicity by sex group or reflect other circumstances is not 
possible to know. The proportion of patients reporting TEAEs were generally consistent between 
patients based on region. 
The incidence of adverse events (including Grade>3, and serious AE) tended to be numerically lower 
for Asian subgroup compared with white subgroup. Subgroups of black and Asian were of very limited 
size (n=16). 
Dose interruption/reduction for the management of a TEAE was reported in 35.5% of subjects with 
NSCLC (71 of 200 subjects). The most common TEAEs leading to dose reduction/interruption were 
diarrhoea (8%), increased ALT (8%), increased AST (8%), increased blood ALP (3.5%), nausea (3%), 
and pneumonia (3%). Treatment-related adverse events leading to dose reduction or interruption of 
sotorasib were reported for 42 subjects (21%). The most frequently reported (≥1% of subjects) were 
diarrhoea (7.5%), increased AST (7.5%), increased ALT (7%), nausea (3%), increased blood ALP 
(2.5%), abnormal hepatic function (1 %), and vomiting (1.5%). 
Adverse events leading to dose reduction or interruption of sotorasib were reported for 145 subjects 
(31.8%) in the total monotherapy population. Overall, the types of adverse events leading to both 
sotorasib treatment interruption/dose reduction were generally similar to those reported for subjects 
with NSCLC. 
Eighteen (18) of 200 subjects with NSCLC (9%) had adverse events leading to sotorasib 
discontinuation. The most frequently reported were drug-induced liver injury (1.5%), increased ALT 
(1.5%), increased AST (1.5%), increased blood ALP (1%), pneumonitis (1%), and increased 
transaminases (1%).  
Adverse drug reactions in the SmPC section 4.8 are based on subjects with KRAS p.G12C mutated 
advanced solid tumours who received 960 mg orally once daily as monotherapy (n=359), to maximise 
the potential for identifying adverse events that were related to sotorasib use, which is considered 
acceptable. The criteria used to identify ADRs are considered acceptable.

The dose modification criteria as reflected on SmPC are based solely on dose modification criteria used 
in the clinical studies. In line with the overall dose selection rationale, the negligible differences in 
exposure levels within the range of doses used were not taken into account, leading to uncertainty 
about the efficiency of the approach. While it is acknowledged that the dose reductions are not 
expected to lead to significantly lower exposure based on PK modelling, based on available clinical data 
the safety profile is manageable, also in situations where dose modifications are required due to 
adverse events. Among the 30 subjects with NSCLC who had dose reduction due to adverse events, 
the objective response rate (ORR) per central review was 40% (12 of 30 subjects), which is 
comparable with the overall ORR of 37.4% observed in subjects with NSCLC in phase 2. Currently, 
limited data is available on the impact of the dose modification criteria on resolution of adverse events. 
As the same criteria are used in the on-going confirmatory Study 20190009, more data will be 
available to confirm the impact of the dose modifications on management of adverse events. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
Additional safety data including comparative data will be provided as part of the specific obligation in 
order to fulfil a CMA. Study 201900091 will allow a better characterisation of the long-term safety and 
a contextualisation of the safety data compared to the control arm. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The totality of evidence generated at this time point indicates that sotorasib was generally well 
tolerated, with adverse events mainly related to gastrointestinal reactions, increased liver enzymes 
and general disorders, and a low number of adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (9% 
in the NSCLC 960-mg sotorasib monotherapy). The key risk with sotorasib is hepatotoxicity with 
laboratory abnormalities for serum transaminases, mostly mild-moderate, but require monitoring and 
resulted in dose modification, or temporary interruption or use of steroids until resolution. Appropriate 
routine risk minimisation measures, as described in the SmPC have also been put in place to mitigate 
the adverse reaction of pneumonitis. Sotorasib toxicity could overall be considered clinically 
manageable in the context of a conditional MA. 
The entire safety database is limited and based on data from single-arm phase 1/2 trial in different 
diseases. To provide more comprehensive efficacy and safety data in the proposed indicated 
population, the results of an ongoing, confirmatory, active-controlled, phase 3 study will be submitted 
by the applicant in the same population of patients as a specific obligation in the context of the 
conditional MA. The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety 
data in the context of a conditional MA: 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of sotorasib in the treatment of patients with KRAS G12C-
mutated NSCLC, the MAH should submit the clinical study report for the phase III CodeBreaK 200 
study (Study 20190009) comparing sotorasib versus docetaxel for the treatment of previously treated 
KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC. The clinical study report will be submitted by 31 March 2023.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as: 
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
• 
It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 14-a] 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The authorised indication is: “LUMYKRAS as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults with 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS G12C mutation and who have progressed 
after at least one prior line of systemic therapy.” 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently, KRAS-related advanced NSCLC is treated in a conventional manner with the initial platinum-
based chemotherapy regimens and/or regimens, including checkpoint inhibitors in the first- and 
second-line treatments. Additional second-line or subsequent lines of therapy include taxane 
chemotherapy with or without a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor or checkpoint 
inhibitors/platinum-containing doublet chemotherapy (if not already given in first line). The objective 
response rates (ORRs; objective response = complete response + partial response) have been 
reported to be between 5.5% to 13% with chemotherapy (typically a taxane) and between 9.7% to 
22.5% with chemotherapy plus a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor (Gridelli 
et al, 2018; Rittmeyer et al, 2017; Herbst et al, 2016; Borghaei et al, 2015; Herbst et al, 2007). The 
respective outcomes for the PFS and OS were 2.8 to 4.2 months and 6 to 11.4 months with 
chemotherapy alone and 4.8 to 5.4 months and 9.9 to 12.6 months with chemo plus VEGFR inhibitor. 
Based on current data, there is unmet medical need for patients with advanced NSCLC harbouring the 
KRAS mutation based on unavailability of the targeted treatment, poor results obtained with approved 
therapies and severe AEs often accompanying the cytotoxic therapies.

EMA/706135/2021

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The primary support for the proposed indication is based on the phase 2 portion of Study 20170543 
(CodeBreaK 100). This study is an ongoing phase ½, open label, single-group study of sotorasib in 
subjects with KRAS p.G12C-mutated advanced or metastatic NSCLC, colorectal cancer, and other solid 
tumours. Further efficacy support is provided based on the results from the phase-1 portion assessing 
sotorasib as monotherapy. 
In addition, the multicentre, randomised (1:1), open-label active-controlled confirmatory Phase 3 
study is enrolling adult locally-advanced and unresectable or metastatic NSCLC patients with KRAS 
p.G12C mutation and who have failed ≥1 prior systemic therapy. In the Phase 3 trial sotorasib 960 mg 
PO QD treatment is compared against docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV q3w in efficacy, safety PROs and PK. 
The data from the ongoing confirmatory Phase 3 study are not yet available.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
At the DCO date (01 December 2020), out of the 124 patients included in the FAS, the ORR (CR + PR) 
assessed per RECIST 1.1 by BICR was 37.1% (46 of 124 subjects; 95% CI: 28.6, 46.2) consisting of 3 
subjects (2.4%) who achieved CR and 43 subjects (34.7%) who achieved PR. The study achieved the 
threshold predetermined by the applicant for a positive outcome (ORR > 32% and lower limit of the 
95% CI for ORR > 23%). The sensitivity analysis of ORR based on investigator assessment was 30.2% 
(95% CI: 22.31, 38.97) consisting of 1 subject (0.8%) who achieved CR and 37 subjects (29.4%) who 
achieved PR. The concordance rates between the central review and investigator for objective 
response, best overall response, and disease progression were 83.1%, 73.0%, and 74.2%, 
respectively. 
As of the 21 June 2021 data cut-off date, of the 46 objective responders, the median DOR was 11.1 
months (95% CI: 6.9, 15.0) with a median follow-up time of 15.3 months (95% CI: 15.2, 15.8). The 
median time to response was 1.35 months (range: 1.2, 10.1). 
The median PFS was 6.8 months (95% CI: 5.1, 8.2) with a median follow-up time of 11.0 months 
(min, max: 0.3, 12.6) and the median OS was 12.5 months (95% CI: 10.0, NE) with a median follow-
up time of 12.2 months (min, max: 1.1, 15.6).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Study 20170543 is a single-arm clinical trial aimed at investigating the efficacy of sotorasib in patients 
with previously treated KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. There are obvious 
uncertainties related to the design of a single arm phase 1/2 study without any control of the type I 
error. Determining efficacy in single-arm studies can be challenging due to the lack of comparator and 
due to the potential selection bias, especially in a heterogeneous population for whom the prognostic of 
the patients is not clearly established. The literature is indeed not conclusive about the prognostic of 
patients with KRAS-mutated NSCLC, including p.G12C-mutated NSCLC. Some studies reported that 
patients with KRAS mutations have a poor prognostic while other studies have demonstrated no 
prognostic difference with the overall patients with advanced NSCLC (Sattler et al., 2020). Thus, 
definitive conclusions cannot be drawn on time to event endpoints from a single arm trial. Results of 
PFS and OS are thus considered exploratory in this context. However, confirmatory PFS results 
supported by the totality of the data, including a favourable effect on OS /no negative trend are 
awaited from the ongoing phase 3 trial comparing the efficacy of sotorasib versus docetaxel. 
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021  
Page 138/147 
 
 
 
 
The sample size is another limitation (for main results and subgroup assessments), as well as the 
relatively short follow-up time which limits the interpretation of several study endpoints. 
Finally, the claimed dose of 960 mg is not justified from both a PK and PK/PD perspective. An 
important dose nonlinearity and a significant inverse ER relationship were indeed observed. The 
sotorasib 960 mg QD regimen has exceeded the exposure-response saturation level and the applicant 
is intending to incorporate an additional study arm to the currently ongoing Phase 2 trial to find the 
optimal dose. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
As of the data cut-off dates for the phase 1 and phase 2 portions of study 20170543, the safety 
database comprises 456 patients across all doses and tumour types, (colorectal cancer at the intended 
dose n=87, all other tumour types at the intended dose n=72, pool of any tumour type at the intended 
dose n=359), of which 200 are patients with NSCLC. 
Nearly all patients experienced at least one TEAEs. 
Grade ≥3 AEs and SAEs were experienced, respectively, by 61% and 52.5% of patients with NSCLC 
and by 53.3 % and 45.2% of patients in total any tumour type/any dose pool. The most frequently 
reported serious adverse events among NSCLC patients were pneumonia (8%), NSCLC (4.5%), pleural 
effusion (4%), respiratory failure (4%), back pain (3%), dyspnoea (2.5) and metastatic lung cancer 
(2%). 
The most frequent AEs in NSCLC patients belong to gastrointestinal disorders SOC (71.5%) including 
occurrence of nausea, diarrhoea, constipation and vomiting, abdominal pain; musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders SOC (51.5%) including back pain and arthralgia; and general disorders and 
administration site conditions SOC (49.5%) including fatigue, oedema peripheral and pyrexia.  
AESI cases of hepatotoxicity are notable in about 28.5% of patients with NSCLC (15% Grade ≥3). ALT 
increased (19%) and AST increased (20%) were the most common TEAEs among NSCLC patients. AST 
increased and ALT increased TEAEs were severe (grade ≥3) in 6.5% and 7.5% of patients respectively. 
5 cases of DILI were reported among 456 patients in the total any tumour type/any dose pool.  
Renal toxicity was identified as an event of interest. Renal toxicity adverse events were reported for 34 
of 200 subjects (17%) with NSCLC (3% grade ≥ 3). The most frequently reported renal toxicity adverse 
event of interest was hyponatremia (8%) (2% grade ≥ 3). A total of 5 subjects in the monotherapy any 
tumour/any dose population had acute kidney injury, including 1 of the 200 subjects with NSCLC 
receiving 960 mg QD sotorasib and 4 of the 359 subjects treated with 960 mg QD sotorasib for all 
tumour types. 
Pneumonitis were reported in 3 patients (1.1%), all were serious and 2 cases led to treatment 
discontinuation. 
SAEs most commonly reported as treatment-related by investigators concerned increased ALT, nausea, 
and pneumonitis; 
Treatment discontinuation due to AEs occurred in about 9% of patients, and dose interruption / 
reductions in about 35.5% of patients, which is not negligible. 
A substantial proportion of patients (about 17.5%) had fatal AEs. All were considered drug unrelated 
by investigator.

EMA/706135/2021  
Page 139/147 
 
 
 
 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The number of patients with NSCLC is limited (200 patients) and the single-cohort design of the phase 
I/II study 20170543 precludes a causality assessment. There is no direct comparison of the sotorasib 
safety profile with current standard of care therapy (chemotherapy and immunotherapy).  
The median duration of exposure of about 6 months is considered limited, with only 46% and 10% of 
subjects receiving treatment for ≥6 and ≥12 months, respectively; long-term safety data are not 
available.  
Safety data in patients with the most advanced age (>75 years) remain limited. Patients with ECOG 
status 0 and 1 have been enrolled and data in frail patients, of most relevance for late lines of therapy, 
is missing. A key uncertainty in the safety of sotorasib relates to hepatotoxicity, which seems to be an 
unpredictable adverse reaction with an unknown mechanism. Although the discontinuation rate due to 
hepatotoxicity was found to be low (4.5%) and no fatal cases were reported, the number of 
hepatotoxicity adverse events and unresolved cases is notable. Section 4.4 of the SmPC reflects the 
overall use of steroids for the treatment of hepatotoxicity in study 20170543 (24/359=6.7%). 
The dose modifications rules evolved during the study 20170543 and the larger dose reduction from 
960 mg to 480 mg (in line with the current SmPC), was only applied later in the trial with Protocol 
amendment 6. Therefore, only 36.8% of subjects had dose reduction from 960 mg to 480 mg, most 
subjects having a reduction from 960 mg to 720 mg (57.9%). Given the non-linear PK, these SmPC 
dose modification recommendations are not ideal, but were nevertheless applied in the pivotal study 
20170543. It is recognised that the currently proposed dose modification rules are also applied in the 
ongoing Phase 3 study. The comparison of 960 mg QD to 240 mg QD in the context of the study 
20170543 will further shed light to the issue of optimal dosing.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The activity data available for Lumykras is considered meaningful for the targeted group of patients 
with KRAS p.G12C mutated locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC. The primary endpoint ORR 
showed over 37% overall response rate (ORR) in patients of whom the majority had received several 
previous treatment lines and had been treated with anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 with or without platinum-
based combination chemotherapy as well as targeted therapies against actionable oncogenic driver 
mutations, if present.  
Only 5 patients with stage III disease at study screening were included in the phase II study. 
Extrapolation of indication to locally advanced disease is considered reasonable since the proposed 
treatment option is aimed for a population that has already received at least one line of treatment in 
the advanced disease setting and in line with previously approved biomarker targeted therapy 
indications in NSCLC. 
In indirect comparisons, the ORR observed compares favourably to the response observed with 
conventional treatments, including pembrolizumab, in the 2nd line overall NSCLC population in which 
response rates up to about 30% ORR have been observed. However, direct comparisons are not 
available. The activity of Lumykras is even more important considering the large part of the patients 
(35%) in the current study having already experienced 2 or more treatment lines with progression and 
22% at least 3 prior treatment lines with progression. Considering that the current product, being a 
monotherapy without any additional backbone chemotherapy, emphasises further the value of the 
current data in a patient population with limited treatment options available.  
The design of the study and the observed activity are however of limited value in establishing the 
magnitude of effects in terms of important clinical endpoints in terms of OS, PFS, and Harmol. 
However, the observed activity in terms of response rate and response duration is such that one can 
conclude that a clinically relevant effect in terms of efficacy is established even if the magnitude cannot 
be precisely estimated based on the available data.  
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021  
Page 141/147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To provide comprehensive efficacy and safety data in the proposed indicated population, an ongoing, 
confirmatory, active-controlled, phase 3 study will be submitted by the applicant in the same 
population of patients.  
Sotorasib was generally well tolerated, with AEs mainly related to gastrointestinal reactions, increased 
liver enzymes and general disorders. The key risk with sotorasib is hepatotoxicity with laboratory 
abnormalities for serum transaminases (AST (20%) and ALT (19%)) mostly mild-moderate, but 
require monitoring and resulted in dose modification, or temporary interruption or use of steroids until 
resolution.  
The totality of evidence generated at this time point indicates that sotorasib was generally well 
tolerated, with a low number of adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (9% in the NSCLC 
960-mg sotorasib monotherapy). Sotorasib toxicity could overall be considered clinically manageable in 
the context of a conditional MA.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit-risk balance of sotorasib is considered positive. Although the magnitude of benefits needs 
to be confirmed, the available activity data allows to conclude that efficacy is established. The toxicity 
profile is considered acceptable. 
Despite important uncertainties about the precise magnitude of the benefits, sotorasib benefits 
outweigh the harms for the second line treatment setting and beyond (2L+) of patients with KRAS 
G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The pivotal trial supports the conditional 
marketing authorisation and the SOB will provide comprehensive data on the impact on time-
dependent endpoint, as well as comparative safety.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was 
requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a seriously debilitating and life-
threatening disease. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
Ability to provide comprehensive data. It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide 
comprehensive data. The ongoing multicentre, randomised (1:1), open-label active-controlled 
confirmatory Phase 3 study is intended to enrol 330 locally-advanced and unresectable or 
metastatic NSCLC patients with KRAS p.G12C mutation and who have failed ≥1 prior systemic 
therapy. In this Phase 3 trial sotorasib 960 mg PO QD treatment is compared against docetaxel 75 
mg/m2 IV q3w. The interim analysis timing was adjusted to be at approximately 70% information 
fraction when approximately 160 PFS events observed from both groups. Cross-over from 
docetaxel control group is allowed, hampering the ability of the study to demonstrate OS benefit 
compared to docetaxel in the target population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/706135/2021  
Page 142/147 
 
 
 
 
Nevertheless, the phase 3 trial have the ability to provide confirmatory evidence, provided that a 
successful PFS result is supported by the totality of the data, including a favourable effect on OS 
/no negative trend as described in the guideline on the “Evaluation of anticancer medicinal 
products in man” (EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.6). The due date for the submission of the final study 
results is 31 March 2023. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as sotorasib may provide a therapeutic advantage for 
patients with KRAS p.G12C-mutated advanced NSCLC. Efficacy results observed in studies with 
other available treatments including afatinib, docetaxel, erlotinib, nintedanib/docetaxel, 
pemetrexed ramucirumab/docetaxel, atezolizumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab have been 
presented by the applicant. While the limitations related to indirect comparisons between studies 
are acknowledged, ORRs in the provided studies are all lower than that observed with sotorasib 
(ORR 37%), with highest response rate reported for pembrolizumab (30%).The justification for 
major therapeutic advantage, providing an overview of available treatment options in 2nd line 
setting is considered to be sufficient by the CHMP. Moreover, providing a new treatment option 
with a new mechanism of action, oral administration and with a different safety profile is 
considered to be a relevant therapeutic advantage. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. In the population defined by the claimed indication the 
benefit/risk is considered to be positive. Approval based on non-comprehensive data from a single 
arm study could lead to earlier availability of the treatment. Today enrolment of study 20190009 
has been completed (18 countries globally, including 12 countries and 67 sites in Europe) and 
thus no impact of the approval of sotorasib is anticipated on the ability of the applicant to 
complete the SOB.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Lumykras is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
Divergent position is appended to this report. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Lumykras is favourable in the following indication: 
Lumykras as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS G12C mutation and who have progressed after at least one prior line of 
systemic therapy.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Specific obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the conditional marketing 
authorisation  
This being a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures: 
Description 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of sotorasib in the treatment of patients 
with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC, the MAH should submit the clinical study report for 
the phase III CodeBreaK 200 study (Study 20190009) comparing sotorasib versus 
docetaxel for the treatment of previously treated KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC. The 
clinical study report will be submitted by: 
Due date 
31 March 2023 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
These conditions fully reflect the advice received from the PRAC.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that sotorasib is to be qualified as 
a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised 
within the European Union. 
Refer to Appendix on new active substance (NAS).

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 11 November 2021 
Lumykras EMEA/H/C/005522/0000 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending 
the granting of the marketing authorisation of Lumykras (Sotorasib) for the following indication: 
LUMYKRAS as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced NSCLC with KRAS 
G12C mutation and who have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. 
The reasons for the divergent opinion are as follows: 
The evidence for efficacy of Sotorasib based on the single arm trial (Study 20170543) is considered 
insufficient:  
• 
The overall response rate (ORR) in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (37.4%; 95% CI: 28.84, 46.58), associated 
with a very low rate of complete response (1.6%), and the duration of response (DoR) (11.1 
months; 95% CI: 6.9, 15.0) are unconvincing and not outstanding as would be required for a 
single-arm trial.  
• 
In the absence of an outstanding ORR and DoR, time-related endpoints would have been needed 
to establish clinical benefit, but the impact of treatment with Sotorasib on PFS and OS cannot 
be reliably estimated and PFS and OS results remain therefore descriptive and non-inferential. 
Thus, due to major uncertainties regarding efficacy combined with considerable toxicity of Sotorasib, we 
cannot conclude on a positive B/R.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Pradaxa  75  and  110  mg  hard  capsules  were  authorised  in  the  EU  on  18  March  2008  for  primary 
prevention  of  venous  thromboembolic  events  (primary  VTE  prevention)  in  adult  patients  who  have 
undergone elective total hip replacement surgery or total knee replacement surgery. On 1 August 2011 
the  extension  of  the  indication  to:  prevention  of  stroke  and  systemic  embolism in  adult patients  with 
nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) was approved. In the context of this variation a new strength of 150 
mg hard capsule was registered as a line extension to the marketing authorisation.  
In  October  2011  the  CHMP  finalised  the  variation  II/22  for  Pradaxa  following  the  assessment  of  fatal 
bleeding  events  related  to  the  use  of  Pradaxa.  The  database  lock  point  (DBL)  used  for  this  variation 
was 23 August 2011.  It was concluded that a specific statement should be included in section 4.2 of 
the Pradaxa SmPC that an estimation of kidney function is mandatory in all patients, prior to initiation 
of Pradaxa treatment, also under certain circumstances during treatment. 
In  December  2011  the  CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to  provide  the  tabulated  description  of  all  fatal 
bleeding  cases  associated  with  Pradaxa  use, in light of  the  significant increase  in  the  number  of  fatal 
bleeding  events  associated  with  the  use  of  Pradaxa  since  the  completion  of  variation  Pradaxa 
EMEA/H/C/000829/II/0022.  The  MAH  was  asked  to  provide  an  in-depth  analysis  and  discussion  of 
whether  the  occurrence  of  fatal  bleedings  events  in  the  real-world  setting  observed  so  far  is  higher 
than  expected  from  the  RE-LY  study  results.  In  addition,  a  recent  meta-analysis  by  Ken  Uchino  and 
Adrian  V  Hernandez  was  published  (Circulation.  2011;  124:  A15500)  where  it  was  suggested  that 
Pradaxa  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  myocardial  infarction/acute  coronary  syndrome.  The 
MAH was requested to provide its view on the meta-analysis. The assessment of these responses was 
done  within  the  ARs  for  FUM  029  and  for  FU2  029.1.  The  cut-off  date  for  the  data  submitted  within 
FUM 029 was 31 October 2011. The cut off date for the data submitted within the MAH’s responses to 
the AR for FUM 029 and assessed in the AR for FU2 029.1 was 31 December 2011. The CHMP finalized 
the  assessment  of  the  FU2  029.1  in  March  2012.  In  addition  an  Ad  Hoc  Experts  Group  meeting  on 
Pradaxa  was  convened  on  6th  March  2012  to  advise  the  CHMP  in  particular  on  the  possible 
improvement  in  the  prevention  and  medical  management  of  bleedings  related  to  the  use  of  Pradaxa 
(Minutes  from  the  Ad  Hoc  Experts  Group  meeting  included  in  Attachement  8).  The  current  variation 
was  submitted  to  update  the  SmPC  with  regards  to  the  contraindications  and  warnings  related  to 
haemorrhagic risk factors and to respond to additional questions as requested in the ARs for FUM 029 
and  FU2  029.1  (Attachement  7).  The  Rapporteur’s  AR  for  current  variation  included  mainly  the 
discussion on the possible SmPC modifications. To present a fuller picture of the information assessed 
the CHMP ARs for FUM 029, FU2 029.1 are included as attachments.  
2.2.  Clinical Safety aspects 
2.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Analysis of all fatal bleeding cases 
In  light  of  the  significant  increase  in  the  number  of  fatal  bleeding  events  associated  with  the  use  of 
Pradaxa  (in  terms  of  post-marketing  reports/spontaneous  reporting),  the  MAH  was  requested  to 
provide  tabulated  description  of  all  fatal  bleeding  cases  associated  with  Pradaxa  use.  The  following 
information  was  asked  to  be  included,  wherever  feasible:  case  ID,  country,  nature  of  bleeding  event

leading  to  death,  age,  sex,  weight,  Pradaxa  dose  at  time  of  event,  indication  for  Pradaxa  treatment, 
time from start of Pradaxa treatment to start of bleeding event, renal function, concomitant medication 
and risk factors for bleeding.  
In  December  2011  the  MAH  was  asked  to  perform  a  worldwide  search  for  spontaneous  and  health 
authority  individual  case  safety  reports  (ICSRs)  that  concern  A)  fatal  bleeding  events  or  B)  serious 
bleeding  cases  where  another  cause  of  death  was  reported  or  the  cause  of  death  was  unknown  in 
patients  treated  with  dabigatran  etexilate.  The  date  of  data  cut-off  was  31  October  2011.  This  has 
resulted  in  the  identification  of  340  ICSRs.  These  included  260  cases  of  fatal  bleedings  (A)  and  80 
serious  bleeding  cases  with  another  or  unknown  cause  of  death  reported  (B).  In  total,  the  340  cases 
had reported 449 bleeding events as some subjects experienced more than one event, corresponding 
to about 1.3 events/case. The MAH has also provided an extensive spreadsheet encompassing all the 
aforementioned 340 cases and including information as requested in the question with the exception of 
renal  function  which  has  been  addressed  separately  in  the  narrative  response  above.  In  addition  to 
being  included  in  the  spreadsheet,  also  country,  region,  gender,  age,  time  to  onset,  dose,  site  of 
bleeding,  concomitant  medication,  medical  history  and  concomitant  diseases  have  been  addressed 
separately in the narrative response.

In  Table  1  the  MAH  has  presented  the  country  distribution  of  the  reported  340  cases  by  31  October 
2011. According to this table there were 23 cases with a fatal bleeding event plus 6 cases with serious 
bleeding  events  with  another  or  unknown  cause  of  death  reported  in  the  EU/EEA.  As  expected,  the 
majority of cases derive from the United States (169 fatal bleedings + 44 cases with serious bleeding 
events with another or unknown cause of death reported - in total 213 events). Compared to Europe, a 
larger quantity of dabigatran etexilate has been used in the United States where dabigatran etexilate 
was approved on 19 October 2010 for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with 
non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The therapeutic indications are different in the EU (primary prevention of 
VTE  in  orthopaedic  surgery  plus  prevention  of  stroke  in  AF)  and  the  US  (prevention  of  stroke  in  AF). 
While  the  AF  indication  involves  long-term  treatment,  the  duration  of  treatment  is  short  in  the 
orthopaedic surgery indications. From this perspective, the MAH was asked to calculate reporting rates 
for EU and US separately. Furthermore, the MAH was requested to present the main characteristics (in 
terms  of  gender  distribution,  mean  age,  dose,  mean  time  to  onset,  rate  of  severe  renal  impairment) 
for the EU and US cases separately in a tabular format.  
The  MAH  based  its  response  (assessed  within  the  AR  for  FU2  029.1)  on  the  457  ISRs  of  serious 
bleedings with fatal outcome for any reason, including bleeding as well as other and unknown causes 
of  death  (fatal  bleeding  B)  that  were  reported  worldwide  as  of  31  December  2011.  Hereof  were  the 
”subgroup” of 368 ISRs of serious bleedings with fatal outcome (fatal bleeding A). The majority of all 
cases  (fatal  bleeding  B)  were  from  the  US  (263  cases  (58%)),  and  sixty-two  cases  (14%)  refer  to  a 
patient from any country in the European Economic Area (EEA). The reporting rate was higher in the 
US  compared  to  the  EEA.  The  MAH  has  displayed  the  main  characteristics  as  far  as  available.  The 
interpretation  of  this  information  was,  however,  hampered  by  the  limited  availability  of  many  of  the 
requested parameters. While sex was available for most of the cases, age was available for 46 cases in 
the EEU and 139 cases in the US. The mean age was slightly higher in the US compared to the EU (80 
vs. 76 years) but this may reflect the different indications authorised in the US and Europe. (pVTE not 
authorised  in  the  US).  The  same  applied  for  the  doses,  which  were  higher  in  the  US  compared  to 
Europe,  consistent  with  the  higher  doses  authorised  for  the  SPAF  indication  compared  to  the  pVTEp 
indication. The quantification of renal impairment was only possible in few of those patients, hence no 
conclusions  could  be  drawn  from  the  comparison  of  the  data  in  the  EU  and  US  presented  by  main 
characteristic of patients (in terms of gender distribution, mean age, dose, mean time to onset, rate of 
severe renal impairment). Overall, CHMP agreed with the MAH that a comparison was hampered by the 
difference in approved indications in the US and the EU. 
At data cut-off 31 October 2011, 21 cases of fatal bleedings plus 5 cases with serious bleeding events 
with another or unknown cause of death reported had accumulated in Japan. A follow up measure FUM 
0028  followed  by  variation  II/22  completed  in  October  2011  was  triggered  by  six  cases  of  fatal 
bleeding  reported  on  12  August  2011  by  the  Japanese  Authorities.  Dabigatran  etexilate  was  first 
marketed in Japan in January 2011. Variation II/22 led to changes in the product information stressing 
the importance of assessing renal function.  
When  breaking  the  340  reported  cases  with  the  data  cut-off  31  Oct  2011  down  by  outcome  (fatal 
bleeding  vs.  bleeding  events  with  other  or  unknown  cause  of  death)  and  gender,  no  unexpected 
differences were observed. It has been shown that 166 cases were reported in female patients and 122 
cases by male patients. Gender information was not available in 52 (15.3%) of cases. In both sexes, 
fatal bleedings represented the majority of events (Figure 1).

Age  was  not  known  in  119  (35%)  of  the  spontaneous  reports.  When  focusing  on  confirmed  cases 
where  age  was  known  (n=  209),  the  MAH  stated  274  but  this  could  not  be  replicated  from  the 
numbers in Figure 2), 143 cases were reported in patients > 75 years of age (68%). This confirms that 
high age is a major risk factor for bleeding events.  
When  analyzing  the  449  reported  bleeding  events  by  site  of  bleeding  (Figure  3),  it  has  been  shown 
that the majority of events were gastrointestinal bleedings as expected.  
Figure 3 Events by site of bleeding (data cut-off 31 October 2011) 
The  bleeding  site  was  known  for  346  events.  176  of  these  events  occured  in  the  GI  tract.  91  events 
represented intracranial bleedings. Figure 4 illustrates the outcome of the bleeding events in relation to 
the site of bleeding.

The outcome was unreported or unknown for 21.6% of events. For the remainder, a complete recovery 
was only reported for 5.3% and a recovery with sequelae in 0.6% of events. In the large majority of 
events (319 (71%)), the events were fatal confirming the seriousness of these events. The analysis of 
time  to  onset  of  the  first  bleeding  event  demonstrates  that  most  bleeding  events  occurred  relatively 
early during treatment with dabigatran (26.1% in the first 10 days and 67.8% within the first month of 
therapy (Figure 5)).  
Figure 5 Cases by time to onset (in days) of first bleeding event (data cut-off 31 October 2011) 
Of  note,  time  to  onset  was  overall  reported  in  only  33.8%  of  cases.  No  unexpected  pattern  was 
observed when the number of cases were broken down by age and time to onset, but this analysis is 
limited by the fact that both variables were only known in a limited number of cases (Figure 7).

The MAH has also analyzed the relationship between daily dose of dabigatran etexilate at the time of 
the event and the site of bleeding (Figure 8).

The dose was only reported in 183/340 cases (data cut off 31 Oct 2011). 2 events were excluded from 
the  analysis  because  of  ”implausible  or  isolatedly  reported  dose”.  The  figure  8  illustrates  that  the 
majority  of  events  occurred  with  the  220  and  300  mg  daily  doses  as  expected.  From  the  provided 
spreadsheet, it was clear that at least 40 patients receiving the 300 mg daily dose (mainly US patients 
more than 80 years old) would have received 220 mg daily because of their age alone had they been 
treated  according  to  the  EU  SmPC.  The  true  number  of  elderly  on  a  high  dose  is  likely  to  be 
considerably higher considering that information about age or dose was missing in a large number of 
the  cases.  The  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  an  analysis  of  the  cases  in  terms  of:  a.  How  many 
patients of the 340 cases received a higher dose of Pradaxa than recommended as per the EU SmPC? 
b. How many patients received Pradaxa despite one or more contraindications as per the EU SmPC? In 
response  the  MAH  has  re-evaluated  the  340  cases  with  respect  to  dose  and  contraindications.  The 
assumptions made for this evaluation were based on the recommended doses as per European SmPC 
for the SPAF indication (i.e. a lower dose of 110 mg BID for patients ≥ 80 years, for patients with high 
risk  of  bleeding,  e.g.  patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment,  and  for  patients  with  verapamil  as 
concomitant treatment) and the primary VTE prevention indication (i.e. 150 mg OD for patients ≥ 75 
years,  for  patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment,  and  for  patients  concomitantly  treated  with 
verapamil, amiodarone or quinidine, as well as 75 mg OD for patients with moderate renal failure and 
concomitant  treatment  with  verapamil).  The  contraindications  comprised  severe  renal  failure, 
concomitant  treatment  with  ketoconazole,  cyclosporine,  itraconozole,  tacrolimus,  and  furthermore 
reported  concomitant  diseases  were  reviewed  for  information  concerning  active  clinically  significant 
bleeding,  organic  lesions  at  risk  of  bleeding,  spontaneous  or  pharmacological  impairment  of 
haemostasis,  hepatic  impairment  or  liver  diseases.  It  was  possible  to  get  information  on  dosage  in 
approximately half of the reports, that is to say in 173 of the 340 patients. Based on this figure, in 40 
(23.1%) of the 173 patients a higher dose than recommended in the EU SmPC was administered (38 
of  these  from  the  USA  where  different  dose  recommendations  are  in  place)  and  27  patients  (15.6%) 
had contraindications, predominantly severe renal failure (mostly in Japan). In summary, as per the EU 
approved label 23.1% of those patients where the posology used was known, were treated with a dose 
that  was  too  high  and  15.6%  of  patients  appeared  to  have  contraindications.  Although  the  MAH  has 
not  explicitly  commented  on  the  overlap  between  those  patients  with  too  high  doses  as  per  EU 
posology and patients with contraindications as per EU SmPC, it can be deducted from the data (higher 
dose than as per EU recommendation is mostly related to US cases, most reports on contraindications 
related to severe renal impairment came mostly from Japan) that the majority were separate reports. 
No  futher  actions  were  deemed  necessary  by  the  CHMP  based  on  the  provided  information.  The 
necessity  of  assessment  of  renal  function  (severe  renal  impairment  being  the  most  frequent 
contraindication that was neglected) has been stressed in the SmPC.  
When breaking the cases down by outcome and age (Figure 9), the distribution among the groups of 
fatal bleedings vs. bleedings with other causes of death reported was overall similar across age groups. 
As noted before, the majority of events occurred in patients older than 75 years.

The analysis of potentially confounding risk factors for bleeding events was hampered by the relatively 
large  amount  of  missing  data.  Only  34.4%  of  reports  contained  information  on  concomitant 
medication. Table 2 presents co-suspected medications as assessed by the reporter.

According to the reporters relatively few patients received concomitant medication that may also have 
increased  the  risk  of  bleeding  (acetylsalicylic  acid  (9),  warfarin  (5),  clopidogrel  (3),  enoxaparin  (2), 
heparin (1)). The table presenting concomitant medications reported in a percentage higher than 3% 
actually  reveal  that  25  patients  received  concomitant  acetylsalicylic  acid,  and  6  clopidogrel  (Table  3). 
Four patients have received citalopram, an SSRI that might also interact with dabigatran.

Information  on  past  medical  history  was  provided  in  20%  of  cases.  As  expected  from  the  target 
population,  a  number  of  patients  have  a  past  history  of  cardiovascular/CNS  events  (central  nervous 
system vascular disorders (14), coronary artery disorders (7)). Furthermore, some patients have also 
reported  previous  gastrointestinal  haemorrhages  (5)  and  gastrointestinal  ulceration/perforation  (3) 
which may indicate a higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (Table 4).

Similarly, information about concomitant diseases (available in 43.5% of cases) reveal that a number 
of  patients  had  concomitant  diseases  that  are  known  to  be  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  vascular 
events  including  hemorrhages  (vascular  hypertensive  disorders  (67),  glucose  metabolism  disorders 
(27),  gastrointestinal  bleeding  events  (gastrointestinal  neoplasms  (7))  and  lifestyle  issues  (alcohol?)

Finally,  the  MAH  has  analyzed  the  340  cases  according  to  renal  function.  Again,  information  is 
unfortunately  very  limited  (only  available  in  12.9%  of  cases)  and  potentially unrepresentative  as  this 
background  information  might  be  more  prone  to  be  reported  in  patients  with  renal  insufficiency. 
Nevertheless,  Table  7  demonstrates  that  in  44  patients  with  available  data  on  renal  dysfunction,  23 
patients had a CrCl or a GFR indicating severe renal impairment.

Despite  the  abovementioned  limitations,  these  data  in  view  of  the  CHMP  confirm  that  severe  renal 
insufficiency  is  indeed  a  major  risk  factor  for  bleeding  events.  However,  in  the  cases  it  was  unclear 
whether  the  reported  severe  renal  impairment  was  present  at  the  time  of  bleeding  or  whether  it 
followed  the  bleeding  event  (as  a  complication).  The  MAH  was  requested  to  clarify  for  each  case,  if 
possible. This information was hoped to give some idea of whether higher proportions of patients with 
severe  renal  impairment  have  fatal  bleeding  events  as  opposed  to  more  minor  adverse  effects.    The 
total  number  of  reports  referring  to  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  would  also  provide  some 
level  of  information  regarding  whether  an  unacceptably  high  number  of  such  patients  have  been 
exposed to dabigatran etexilate. 
Clarification  on  the  cases  with  severe  renal  failure  has  been  provided  by  the  MAH.  In  26  of  the  457 
patients  (cut  off  date:  31  December  2011)  with  serious  bleeding  events  reported  with  any  (including 
unknown)  cause  of  death,  information  on  severe  renal  impairment  was  provided.  Each  single  patient 
was  checked  for  concomitant  and  past  diseases,  date  of  occurrence  of  the  bleeding  event,  dates  of 
relevant laboratory parameters used for estimation of renal function and Pradaxa treatment dates. In 
13  of  the  26  severely  renally  impaired  patients  the  severe  renal  impairment  was  existing  before  the 
bleeding  event.  In  6  patients  the  severe  renal  impairment  was  a  consequence  of  the  blood  loss 
(prerenal failure) and in 7 cases an assessment was not possible. In addition, the MAH was asked to 
provide  the  proportions  of  patients  with  normal  renal  function  and  mild,  moderate  and  severe  renal 
impairment  in  their  overall  safety  database  of  all  ADRs.  From  the  provided  data  it  appears  that  a 
higher  percentage  of  patients  where  a  serious  bleeding  with  death  was  reported  had  severe  renal 
insufficiency (47%) compared to all post-marketing ISRs where severe renal insufficiency was reported 
in 30%. However, these data must be interpreted extremely carefully. In only 673 ISRs out of 24,312 
ISRs (2.8%) quantifiable information on renal function was available. However, such information was 
available  in  66  out  of  those  457  ISR  with  serious  bleedings  entailing  death  (12%).  Due  to  the 
limitations  of  the  spontaneous  reportings  in  the  opinion  of  the  CHMP  no  firm  conclusions  could  be 
drawn on this issue.  
The  DHPC  recently  circulated  in  the  EU  (following  the  CHMP  conclusion  on  variation  Pradaxa  II/22) 
provided  a  reminder  to  prescribers  that  dabigatran  etexilate  treatment  is  contraindicated  in  patients 
with severe renal impairment and stressed the importance of assessing renal function.  The MAH was 
asked  to  comment  on  how  they  intend  to  determine  whether  the  DHPC  has  reduced  prescribing  in 
patients  with  severe  renal  impairment.  Overall,  it  seems  too  early  to  determine  whether  the  DHPC, 
which was distributed between end October and mid November 2011 (except in France where this was 
planned  in  parallel  to  the  launch  of  the  SPAF  indication  in  April  2012),  has  reduced  prescribing  in 
patients  with  severe  renal  impairment.  While  the  monthly  number  of  cases  of  serious  bleedings  with 
fatal  outcome  and  severe  renal  impairment  was  approximately  1-2  in  the  EEA  from  August  to 
September,  it  increased  to  8  cases  both  in  November  and  December  2011.  This  corresponds  to  a 
considerable  increase  of  the  monthly  reporting  rate,  especially  in  the  two  last  months  of  2011,  when 
expressed  by  100,000  patient  years.  The  rates  were  14.5  in  August,  19.2  in  September,  25.5  in

October, 78.9 in November and 93.7 in December 2012. It was agreed with the MAH that this may be 
due  to  a  reporting  bias  and  due  to  increased  awareness  following  the  DHPC,  however,  this  remains 
speculation. Following the request of a drug utilization study, protocols were already submitted for the 
assessment to the CHMP. These are handled within FUM25 (study 1160.136  GLORIA-AF) and FUM26 
(study 1160.144 Study to assess potential off-label use outside AF), and both procedures are still on-
going.  It  was  considered  that  the  already  requested  measures  are  sufficient  to  address  the  drug 
utilization program.  
Summary 
In  summary,  the  MAH  had  provided  tables  of  information  summarizing  various  characteristics  of  the 
group  of  patients  with  fatal  bleeding  reactions  within  FUM  029.  This  approach  was  accepted  by  the 
CHMP.  However,  no  attempt  to  discuss/analyse  the  cases,  or  to  relate  risk  factors/characteristics 
together has been initially made.  The MAH provided within responses to the FUM 029 a discussion of 
the cases with multiple risk factors for bleeding and made an attempt to identify those that are likely 
to  be  the  most  important.  The  discussion  was  linked  to  renal  function  status  which  was  not  discusse 
previously and in relation to other risk factors and outcomes. The discussion concentrated on possible 
PK  and  PD  drug  interactions  and  considered  whether  current  SmPC  warnings  are  adequate.  In  the 
response the MAH stated that by 31 October there were 340 ISR reported and by 31 December 2011 
457 ISR of serious bleeding events reported as fatal plus bleeding events with other or unknown cause 
of death. Of these 457 cases, age and gender were available for 283 case reports. The MAH’s analyses 
provided in response to the RA for FU 029 were built on these latter cases. In these cases, any of the 
risk factors: antiplatelet use, P-gp-inhibitor use or severe renal impairment were reported in 83 cases 
(29%).  There  was  an  increase  of  fatal  bleeding  cases  with  age  in  the  presence  of  severe  renal 
impairment. For the other risk factors and the combination of risk factors, an association with age was 
not seen. However, overall the number of fatalities in patients with combined risk factors was low. As 
the risk factors are already mentioned appropriately in the EU SmPC, as severe renal impairment is a 
contraindication and as the SmPC was recently strengthened with respect to the need for assessment 
of  renal  function,  the  current  SmPC  and  the  conducted  measures  were  regarded  by  the  CHMP  as 
sufficient.  The  CHMP  agreed  that  the  analysis  did  not  provide  a  basis  for  determining  further  risk 
minimization activities. However, the number of cases with multiple risk factors was relatively low, and 
it was felt that it would be difficult to disentangle the relative contribution of each risk factor from an 
analysis of post-marketing events.  
Fatal bleeding cases in the real world setting as compared to the RE-LY study 
The MAH was asked to analyze and discuss of whether the occurrence of fatal bleedings events in the 
real-world setting observed so far is higher than expected from the RE-LY study results. The MAH has 
compared the occurrence of fatal bleeding events post-marketing with the rate observed in the RE-LY 
study. Reference was made to Table 8.

Post  marketing:  Fatal  bleeding  events;  RE-LY:  Adjudicated  MBE  where  the  investigator  has 
indicated ‘death’ as MBE criterion per protocol definition 
Post marketing: Serious bleeding events (fatal or non-fatal) in a case with a fatal outcome; RE-
LY: Not applicable 
Post marketing: Regulatory serious events; RE-LY: MBE per protocol definition 
Fatal  A  events  corresponded  to  the  cases,  where  the  outcome  of  the  bleeding  was  reported  as  fatal 
bleeding. Fatal B events correspond to the cases, where the outcome of the bleeding was reported as 
fatal bleeding plus serious bleeding cases where another cause of death was reported or the cause of 
death  was  unknown.  A  cumulative  reporting  rate  has  been  calculated  based  on  the  number  of 
individual  case  safety  reports  (ICSRs)  (=  numerator)  and  global  bulk  sales  (=  denominator).  The 
resulting post-marketing fatal bleeding rate was estimated to be 6.3 (Fatal A events) and 8.3 (Fatal B 
events) per 10,000 patient years. In comparison, it was 16.6 for the 110 mg BID dose and 19.5 for the 
150 mg BID dose in the RE-LY study. It was also noted that the rate was 31.0 for warfarin in the RE-LY 
study. The MAH concluded and the CHMP agreed that the post-marketing bleeding rates for dabigatran 
etexilate  are  substantially  less  than  the  respective  rates  seen  in  the  RE-LY  groups  for  both  doses  of 
dabigatran etexilate. If the reporting rate in the post-marketing phase had been higher than in the RE-
LY  study,  there  would  clearly  have  been  a  safety  concern.  The  fact  that  reporting  rate  in  the  post-
marketing  phase  is  lower  gives  some  reassurance  as  to  the  safety  profile  of  the  product.  However, 
there  are  several  limitations  to  the  performed  calculations  as  the  reporting  rate  of  serious  bleeding 
events is likely to be underestimated for two reasons. Firstly, underreporting in spontaneous reporting 
systems is a well known phenomenon and in particular this is likely to be the case when the event is 
expected.  However,  this  tendency  could  to  some  extent  be  counteracted  by  the  seriousness  of  the 
event in question and the fact that Pradaxa represents a new treatment modality in the prevention of 
stroke  in  atrial  fibrillation  patients  and  the  consequent  increased  attention  about  Pradaxa  among 
physicians. Secondly, the denominator is likely to be overestimated since it is based on bulk sales and 
not the amount of drug actually consumed. Put in other words, the estimate does not take into account 
stocks  of  drug  at  wholesalers,  pharmacies  or  patients.  Finally,  the  evaluation  of  the  observed  versus 
expected rates of bleeding is further complicated by lack of information on relevant covariates for the 
patients  using  the  drug  post-marketing,  i.e.  whether  patients  at  low  or  high  risk  of  bleeding  are 
treated. Therefore, post-marketing bleeding-rates must be interpreted with caution. In conclusion, one 
would have liked the difference in fatal bleeding rates based on post-marketing reports and the RE-LY 
study, respectively, to be larger than actually seen. However, at present there is no solid evidence to 
suggest that the fatal bleeding rate in patients treated with Pradaxa in the clinical setting is larger than 
in the RE-LY study. In the AR for FUM 029 the MAH was requested to provide an estimate of the actual 
drug  consumption  post-marketing  and  to  repeat  the  calculation  of  the  cumulative  post-marketing 
bleeding rate on this basis (drug in stock should be excluded from the denominator) and comment on 
the  result.  The  MAH  was  also  asked  to  comment  on  the  likely  level  of  under-reporting  of  fatal 
bleedings.  
The MAH has presented 3 different estimates of patient exposure to marketed Pradaxa:  
1. Global data from the IMS Health MIDAS database which covers product sales volume by wholesalers 
into pharmacies and/or hospitals and excludes drug in stock at the wholesaler level, as well as product 
samples. 
2.  Commercial  product  sold  ex-factory  since  the  first  Pradaxa  launch,  excluding  product  samples 
(distributed by company representatives) or free goods. (Boehringer Ingelheim’s standard method for 
estimating patient exposure to Pradaxa). 
3. Commercial product sold ex-factory, including product samples and free goods.

Overall,  the  methodologies  applied  for  estimating  post-marketing  exposure  were  endorsed.  The  most 
conservative method is method a. Also according to this method, the fatal bleeding rate was still below 
the rates observed in the RE-LY study for both the 110 mg BID and the 150 mg BID doses (1.7-2 fold 
difference)  and  for  warfarin  (3-fold  difference).  It  is  agreed  that  a  bleeding  event  is  more  likely  to 
stimulate  adverse  event  reporting  than  most  other  events,  especially  if  it  has  a  serious  or  fatal 
outcome and in view of the attention of healthcare professionals due to the novelty of the therapeutic 
principle  of  Pradaxa  and  its  recent  launch.  In  conclusion,  the  requested  more  conservative  re-
calculations of the fatal bleeding rate based on post-marketing reports have been provided. Based on 
the provided data, the rates are still lower than the rates observed in the RE-LY study. 
Development  of  an  antidote  for  Pradaxa  and  medical  management  of  major 
bleeding events 
Within  the  FUM  029  the  MAH  was  asked  to  provide  an  update  on  how  far  the  development  of  an 
antidote  to  Pradaxa  has  progressed.  A  reversal  agent/antidote  for  dabigatran  is  under  early 
development  (preclinical stage).  The  MAH  was  requested  to  comment  on  whether  any  new  advice  on 
management  of  bleeding  in  dabigatran  etexilate  treated  patients  is  available,  and  whether  the 
information  in  section  4.9  of  the  SmPC  is  still  complete/up-to-date.  Also,  it  was  noted  that  the 
information  provided  in  the  Canadian  product  monograph  was  more  extensive  than  that  of  the  EU 
SmPC.  The  MAH  proposed  an  addition  to  section  4.9  suggesting  treatment  options  that  may  be 
considered in case of overdose: activated prothrombin complex concentrates, recombinant Factor VIIa, 
concentrates  of  coagulation  factors  II,  IX  or  X,  and  platelet  concentrates  (where  thrombocytopenia  is 
present or long acting antiplatelet drugs have been used). The evidence for these treatments is at this 
stage theoretical, and clinical data supporting them in the treatment of Pradaxa overdose are lacking. 
But  this  limitation  has  been  appropriately  stated  in  the  proposed  text.  Hence,  the  proposal  was 
supported by the CHMP. It should be noted that an Ad hoc expert meeting was convened on 6 March 
2012  to  address  this  issue.  Experts  supported  the  new  proposal  for  the  management  of  the  major 
bleeding,  in  particular  the  recommendation  to  consider  the  use  of  activated  PCC,  recombinant  factor 
VIIa  or  concentrates  of  coagulation  factors.  Also,  the  administration  of  platelet  concentrates  in  cases 
where  thrombocytopenia  is  present  or  long  acting  antiplatelet  drugs  have  been  used  were  found 
justified. The experts didn’t see the preference for any of the suggested treatment options given only 
experimental evidence to support the role of these agents in counteracting the anticoagulant effect of 
dabigatran and the fact that their usefulness in clinical settings has not been established. Instead, they 
suggested leaving it at the discretion of the treating physician. Some experts stated however that the 
increased  risk  of  rebound  thromboembolism  could  be observed  with  the  use  of  some  of  these  agents 
(PCC).  
The  topic  of  (the  lack  of)  an  antidote  has  recently  been  highlighted  in  the  New  England  Journal  of 
Medicine  in  a  letter  to  the  editor:  http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1111095.  It  was 
suggested  in  the  letter  that  patients  treated  with  dabigatran  who  experience  injury/trauma  are  at 
increased risk of serious bleedings, including fatal bleedings. Further, the EMA has recently conducted 
an  analysis  in  EudraVigilance  to  compare  the  reported  risk  associated  with  the  use  of  dabigatran 
etexilate  in  acutely  injured  patients  to  the  reported  risk  associated  with  older  (warfarin, 
acenocoumarol)  and  another  new  oral  anticoagulant  (rivaroxaban).  The  primary  endpoint  in  the 
analysis were case count numbers, a measure of disproportionality of reporting (PRR) and percentage 
of  reported  fatal  cases  on  selected  MedDRA  terms  reflecting  acute  neurological  haemorrhagic  events 
and  injuries.  The  study  confirmed  that  a  high  number  of  reports  involving  dabigatran  etexilate 
suggesting  a  haemorrhagic  neurological  complication  or  an  acute  injury  have  been  transmitted  to 
EudraVigilance.  The  number  of  reports  is  very  close  to  the  number  of  reports  involving  warfarin.  The 
number  of  reports  involving  rivaroxaban  is  generally  lower  compared  to  dabigatran  etexilate  and 
warfarin.  It  was  particularly  highlighted  that  there  was  a  high  number  of  reports  of  falls  involving

dabigatran  etexilate.  The  MAH  was  asked  to  comment  on  the  NEJM  letter  and  the  EMA  analysis. 
Further,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  an  analysis  of  cases  of  serious  bleedings  observed  in 
Pradaxa-treated  patients  experiencing  acute  injury/trauma,  both  from  clinical  trials  and  from  post-
marketing  reports.  The  analysis  should  include  a  comparison  to  other  oral  anticoagulants.  Finally,  in 
light  of  the  lack  of  an  antidote  the  MAH  was  asked  in  the  AR  for  FUM  029  to  discuss  possible 
implications for the product information and the RMP for Pradaxa. In response the company provided 
the assessment of the following: 
  Comments  to  the  recent  article  in  NEJM  regarding  the  management  of  Pradaxa-treated  patients 
experiencing trauma 
  Comments to the EMA analysis on serious bleedings in patients experiencing acute injury/trauma 
  Analysis of trauma-associated bleedings from clinical trials (the RE-LY study) 
  Analysis of trauma-associated bleedings from post-marketing events 
Comments  to  the  recent  article  in  NEJM  regarding  the  management  of  Pradaxa-treated  patients 
experiencing trauma: 
Regarding the availability of means for assessing the degree of anticoagulation: The MAH pointed out 
that there are indeed readily available tests for the degree of dabigatran-related anticoagulation: aPTT 
which  is  widely  available,  ECT  and  TT.  However,  here  it  should  be  noted  that  aPTT  can  only  be 
regarded  as  a  qualitative/semi-quantitative  test  and  that  the  other,  more  precise  methods  are  not 
widely accessible and results are not reported rapidly.  
Regarding  the  availability  of  a  reversal  strategy:  The  MAH  acknowledges  that  there  is  currently  no 
available antidote and that prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) and other clotting cofactors as a 
reversal strategy are currently unproven. This was supported, and this caveat has been mentioned in 
the new recommendations for treatment of overdose in section 4.9 of the SmPC.  
Regarding  the  fact  that  life-threatening  bleeding  complications  can  occur  after  an  injury  in  patients 
taking dabigatran etexilate: The MAH acknowledged this fact, but also referred to the RE-LY where the 
number  of  major  bleedings  was  less  in  patients  treated  with  dabigatran  etexilate  than  in  patients 
treated with warfarin. The comments provided by the MAH to the article in NEJM were considered by 
the CHMP to be acceptable. 
Comments to the EMA analysis on serious bleedings in patients experiencing acute injury/trauma: 
The  MAH  refered  to  the  RE-LY  study,  where  haemorrhagic  neurological  complications  were  less 
frequent  in  patients  on  dabigatran  etexilate  than  in  patients  treated  warfarin,  and  that  there  are  no 
other  controlled  data  to  indicate  the  opposite.  Further,  post-hoc  analyses  of  the  RE-LY  study  showed 
that the incidence of trauma-related bleedings were less than in warfarin-treated patients. In addition, 
the MAH listed the well-known methodological weaknesses associated with analyses of post-marketing 
reports on which the EMA analysis is based. The MAH’s comments to the EMA analysis were considered 
by the CHMP to be acceptable. 
Analysis of trauma-associated bleedings from clinical trials (the RE-LY study): 
The  presence  of  trauma  was  not  routinely  recorded  in  major  bleeding  cases  in  the  RE-LY  study. 
However,  the  MAH  has  conducted  a  post-hoc  analysis  of  trauma  in  relation  to  intracranial 
haemmorrhage  (ICH).  Two  experts  independently  re-evaluated  each  ICH  case  to  additionally  identify 
the  primary  site  of  intracranial  bleeding  by  review  of  imaging  reports,  presence  of  associated  head 
trauma,  and  neurologic  outcomes.  The  frequency  of  traumatic  intracerebral,  subdural  and 
subarachnoid haemorrhages was generally numerically lower for both doses (110 and 150 mg BID) of 
dabigatran etixilate compared to warfarin. For fatal ICH related to trauma, the numbers of events were 
Assessment report  
EMA/556143/2012  
Page 21/43
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
too  low  to  allow  a  meaningful  analysis.  Bearing in mind  the limitations  of  the  provided  analysis  (post 
hoc analysis, no routine recording of presence of trauma), there is no indication in the RE-LY study of 
any  excess  of  ICH  related  to  trauma  with  dabigatran  etixilate  compared  to  warfarin.  The  provided 
analysis and the interpretation by the MAH were considered by the CHMP acceptable. 
Analysis of trauma-associated bleedings from post-marketing events: 
The  MAH  has  analyzed  post-marketing  reports  in  patients  treated  with  Pradaxa  who  experienced  a 
serious  bleeding  event  as  well  as  trauma  (a  serious  accident  or  injury).  Cut-off  was  31  December 
2011,  and  144  patients  were  identified.  In  the  cases  with  fatal  outcome,  more  often  fall  and  head 
injury was reported, the proportion of patients of older age was higher, and generally patients received 
a higher Pradaxa dose. None of these findings can be said to be unexpected. The provided analyses by 
the MAH were acceptable. 
Possible implications for the product information and the RMP for Pradaxa: 
The  MAH  stated  that  in  the  EU  SmPC  recommendations  for  dose  adaptation  in  elderly  patients  have 
been  provided,  and  it  is  reflected  in  the  RMP.  However,  the  MAH  didn’t  initially  provide  an  overall 
discussion of possible implications of the issues related to trauma for the product information and the 
RMP. The provided analyses were considered by the CHMP satisfactory. However, the MAH was asked 
to  discuss  whether  the  issue  of  management  of  Pradaxa-treated  patients  experiencing  trauma/acute 
injury is adequately addressed in the SmPC and RMP or if amendments are needed. It should be noted 
that  an  Ad  hoc  Expert  meeting  on  6  March  2012  was  consulted  on  this  topic.  The  importance  of  the 
education  of  patients  and  prescribers  was  expressed  during  the  meeting,  in  particular  the  need  for 
easy access to the educational materials. The good example of the educational strategy used in Japan 
was presented by the MAH (that according to the MAH is planned to be copied in the EU) and was felt 
reassuring  by  the  experts.  The  experts  reviewed  the  recommendations  for  management  of  major 
bleeding included in the RELY study protocol that were provided by the MAH and found them to follow 
standard  practice  and  to  be  in  line  with  the  latest  proposal  of  the  SmPC.  It  was  proposed  that  the 
consultation of a coagulation expert in case of major bleeding could be recommended in the SmPC as it 
was in the protocol of the RELY study. The information about the danger of dehydration was included 
into the PIL as it may lead to changes in renal function in susceptible patients.    
In addition the CHMP found the contraindication “Organic lesion at risk of bleeding” ambiguous since it 
was  not  entirely  clear  which  diseases  and  conditions  are  encompassed  by  the  term.  Based  on  the 
available  evidence,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  propose  a  revised  wording  for  the  contraindication, 
specifically  with  regard  to  the  nature  of  the  lesions  that  will  constitute  a  contraindication.  Such  a 
revised wording should include common examples of lesions or conditions which would contraindicate 
Pradaxa treatment. The MAH agreed to remove the current contraindication “Organic leasion at risk of 
bleeding” and proposed to replace it with “Lesion or condition which significantly increases the risk of 
major bleeding, such as major arteriovenous malformations or vascular aneurysms; major intraspinal 
or intracerebral vascular abnormalities”. The dilemma was that on one hand one would like to provide 
firm,  specific  guidance  to  prescribers  about  what  constitutes  a  contraindication  with  regard  to 
increased bleeding risk, and on the other hand it is important to allow for an individual assessment by 
the  prescribing  physician  of  the  benefits  and  risks  in  each  individual  case  where  there  are 
haemmorhagic  risk  factors.The  arguments  made  by  the  MAH  that  is  important  to  balance  risk  and 
benefit on an individual basis and allow for the physician to make benefit-risk assessment for as many 
patients  as  possible  were  in  many  respects  supported  by  the  CHMP.  The  problem  with  the  proposed 
wording  was  however  that  it  leaved  the  impression  that  only  the  mentioned  conditions  (major 
arteriovenous  malformations  or  vascular  aneurysms;  major  intraspinal  or  intracerebral  vascular 
abnormalities)  are  contraindications.  Certainly,  other  conditions  such  as  active  ulcerative 
Assessment report  
EMA/556143/2012  
Page 22/43
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gastrointestinal  disease  would  in  severe  cases  be  reasons  not  to  use  Pradaxa.  Consequently,  after 
considering the various options CHMP is of the opinion this to be the most appropriate solution that the 
contraindication  “Organic  lesion  at  risk  of  bleeding”  is  replaced  by:  “Lesion  or  condition  at  significant 
risk  of  major  bleeding  such  as  current  or  recent  gastrointestinal  ulceration,  presence  of  malignant 
neoplasms  at  high  risk  of  bleeding,  recent  brain  or  spinal  injury,  recent  brain,  spinal  or  ophthalmic 
surgery,  recent  intracranial  haemorrhage,  known  or  suspected  oesophageal  varices,  arteriovenous 
malformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities”. 
It  has  been  also  noted  that  the  contraindication  “Spontaneous  or  pharmacological  impairment  of 
haemostasis” was not fully consistent with other sections of the SmPC. The contraindication may imply 
that  any  medication  that  impairs  or  has  the  potential  to  impair  haemostasis  is  contraindicated.  This 
would  include  any  anticoagulant/antiplatelet  agent,  including  acetylsalicylic  acid,  NSAIDs  and  SSRIs. 
However,  in  other  sections  of  the  SmPC  (4.4  and  4.5),  warnings  and  further  details  about  the 
interactions  were  provided,  but  the  use  of  the  agents  are  not  specified  as  contraindicated.  
For all anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents as well as other medicines or classes of medicines known 
to (potentially) impair haemostatis, the MAH was asked to - based on all available evidence - discuss 
the  appropriate  level  of  caution  (contraindication,  warning/precaution  or  neither)  that  should  be 
applied  when  used  concomitantly  with  Pradaxa  and  to  propose  changes  to  the  SmPC  accordingly. 
Further, the MAH was asked to discuss whether recommendations about the use of these concomitant 
medicines  in  patients  undergoing  hip/knee  replacement  should  be  provided,  including  advice  as  to 
if/when these medicines should be discontinued prior to surgery and when they can be safely restarted 
afterwards. In response the MAH proposed to remove “pharmacological impairment of haemostasis” as 
a contraindication arguing that combination of any medicine that impairs hemostasis with Pradaxa will 
increase  the  risk  of  bleeding  but  may  be  justified based  on  the  physician’s  judgement  of  the  benefit-
risk balance in each individual treatment. As for the previously discussed contraindication the dilemma 
was  also  here  the  balance  between  providing  firm,  specific  guidance  to  prescribers  about  what 
constitutes  a  contraindication  with  regard  to  increased  bleeding  risk  and  allowing  for  an  individual 
assessment by the prescribing physician of the benefits and risks in each individual case where there 
are hemorrhagic risk factors. Overall, the removal of the contraindication was supported by the CHMP. 
Instead  the  following  contraindication  was  agreed  by  the  CHMP:  “Concomitant  treatment  with  any 
other  anticoagulant  agent  e.g.  unfractionated  heparin,  low  molecular  weight  heparins  (enoxaparin, 
dalteparin  etc),  heparin  derivatives  (fondaparinux  etc),  oral  anticoagulants  (warfarin,  rivaroxaban, 
apixaban  etc)  except  under  the  circumstances  of  switching  therapy  to  or  from  Pradaxa  (see  section 
4.2)”.  With  regard  to  the  other  part  of  the  original  contraindication,  it  was  considered  that 
“Spontaneous  impairment  of  haemostasis”  is  too  unspecific  and  may  be  interpreted  as  including 
conditions  that  should  not  be  regarded  as  absolute  contraindications.  Hence,  the  mention  of 
“Congenital or acquired coagulation disorders” and “Thrombocytopenia or functional platelet defects” in 
section  4.4  as  conditions  that  require  a  careful  benefit-risk  assessment  was  considered  more 
appropriate.  A  more  precise  definition  of  severe  conditions  relating  to  these  disorders  that  would 
constitute  a  contraindication  was  considered,  but  it  was  concluded  that  the  now  proposed  text  in 
section 4.4 is sufficient to make prescribers aware that they should only use Pradaxa in patients with 
these  conditions  after  a  thorough  benefit-risk  assessment  and  only  when  the  benefit  outweighs  the 
bleeding risk. 
Ad Hoc Experts Group Meeting for Pradaxa 6 March 2012 
Following  the  CHMP  request,  an  ad  hoc  expert  group  meeting  was  convened  on  6  March  2012  to 
provide advice on the list of questions adopted by the CHMP at its February 2012 meeting (please, see 
the Minutes from the Ad Hoc Experts Group meeting enclosed in Attachement 8). The questions posed 
to  experts  were  regarding:  (1)  the  need  for  the  routing  monitoring  of  Pradaxa,  (2)  the 
monitoring/treatment/  follow  up  which  could  improve  management  of  Pradaxa  treated  patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/556143/2012

experiencing  trauma/acute 
injury  and  major  bleeding,  (3)  the  recommendations  regarding 
management of bleeding events in patients taking Pardaxa and  (4) the need for dose modification or 
SmPC clarifications to diminish the risk of bleeding events.  
The  majority  of  experts  agreed  that  no  routine  monitoring  of  the  anticoagulant  activity  of 
Pradaxa  is recommended  (which  is  the  recommendation  in  the current Product  Information 
(PI)) because the desired plasma drug level and the therapeutic window are not known and 
there  is  significant  variability  of  more  widely  available  tests  such  as  the  aPTT  making 
interpretation  difficult.  It  was  recognised  that  the  RELY  study  (that  included  about  18  000 
patients) was not a plasma-level-driven trial; on the contrary the results were based on the 
specific dosing regimen that is reflected in the current PI.  
The  experts  reviewed  the  recommendations  for  management  of  major  bleeding  included  in  the  RELY 
study protocol that were provided by the MAH and found them to follow standard practice and to be in 
line with the latest proposal of the PI. It was proposed that the consultation of a coagulation expert in 
case  of  major  bleeding  could  be  recommended  in  the  PI  as  it  was  in  the  protocol  of  the  RELY  study. 
The information about the danger of dehydration was suggested to be included into the PIL as it may 
lead to changes in renal function in susceptible patients.  
The  new  proposal  for  the  management  of  the  major  bleeding,  in  particular  the  recommendation  to 
consider  the  use  of  activated  PCC,  recombinant  factor  VIIa  or  concentrates  of  coagulation  factors 
(section  4.9  of  the  SmPC  proposed  within  FUM  029)  was  supported  by  the  Group.  Some  experts 
admitted however that the increased risk of rebound thromboembolism could be observed with the use 
of some of these agents (PCC).    
The experts confirmed that the standard dose currently proposed for majority of patients (150 mg BID) 
should left in the PI because the results of the RELY trial are based on this dosing regimen. The Group 
felt that the wording of Section 4.2 is relatively clear given the complexity of the information included 
in this section. Nevertheless, the proposal to further clarify this section was supported by the experts.   
The CHMP agreed with the advice received from the experts. 
Risk of myocardial infarction/acute coronary syndrome 
A  recent  meta-analysis  by  Ken  Uchino  and  Adrian  V  Hernandez  (Circulation.  2011;  124:  A15500) 
suggested that Pradaxa was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction/acute coronary 
syndrome.  Within  the  FUM  029  the  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  the  MAH’s  view  on  the  meta-
analysis. 
In the RE-LY study supporting the new indication in atrial fibrillation patients, a slightly higher rate of 
myocardial  infarction  (MI)  was  noted  in  patients  treated  with  either  of  the  Pradaxa  doses  than  in 
patients treated with warfarin. This lead to the following wording in the SmPC:“In the phase III study 
RE-LY  (see  section  5.1.)  the  overall  rate  of  myocardial  infarction  (MI)  was  0.82,  0.81,  and  0.64  %  / 
year for dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily, dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily and warfarin, 
respectively,  an  increase  in  relative  risk  for  dabigatran  of  29  %  and  27  %  compared  to  warfarin. 
Irrespective  of  therapy,  the  highest  absolute  risk  of  MI  was  seen  in  the  following  subgroups,  with 
similar  relative  risk:  patients  with  previous  MI,  patients  ≥  65  years  with  either  diabetes  or  coronary 
artery disease, patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 %, and patients with moderate renal 
dysfunction.  Furthermore  a  higher  risk  of  MI  was  seen  in  patients  concomitantly  taking  ASA  plus 
clopidogrel  or  clopidogrel  alone.”  This  finding  from  the  RE-LY  study  formed  a  background  for 
conducting the meta-analysis by Ken Uchino and Adrian V Hernandez (Circulation. 2011; 124: A15500) 
presented at the American Heart Association Congress in 2011. The objective of the meta-analysis was 
Assessment report  
EMA/556143/2012  
Page 24/43
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to systematically evaluate the risk of MI or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with the use of dabigatran 
etexilate  for  several  indications,  and  the  authors  conducted  a  search  in  PubMed  of  non-inferiority 
randomized controlled studies of dabigatran etexilate that reported MI or ACS as secondary outcomes. 
Seven  trials  encompassing  31,097  patients  were  selected  and  are  summarized  below:  two  studies  in 
prophylaxis  of  stroke  in  atrial  fibrillation  (AF)  (RE-LY  and  PETRO),  one  study  in  acute  venous 
thromboembolism (RE-COVER), one study in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (RE-DEEM), three studies 
in prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis in hip or knee replacement surgery (RE-NOVATE, RE-MODEL 
and  RE-MOBILIZE).  Control  arms  included  warfarin,  enoxaparin  or  placebo.  The  result  of  the  meta-
analysis was that dabigatran etexilate was significantly associated with a higher risk for MI or ACS than 
the  control  group  (dabigatran  etexilate  255/20718=1.23%  vs.  control  91/10379=0.88%;  OR  1.31, 
95% CI 1.03-1.67). Similar results were seen when using the revised RE-LY dataset or when excluding 
the  short-term  orthopedic  surgery  trials.  The  authors conclude  that  dabigatran  etexilate is  associated 
with  an  increased  risk  of  MI  or  ACS  in  a  broad  spectrum  of  patients  when  tested  against  different 
controls,  and  that  clinicians  should  consider  the  potential  of  these  serious  harmful  cardiovascular 
effects in the use of dabigatran etexilate. 
The  MAH  highlighted  a  number  of  methodological  weaknesses  and  limitations  of  the  meta-analysis. 
They  can  be  summarized  as  follows:  (1)  pooling  of  data  across  trials  with  different  comparators, 
patient  populations,  indications  and  doses,  (2)  Inclusion  of  low  subtherapeutic  doses  from  phase  II 
trials, (3) Using an outdated dataset from the RE-LY study for the primary analysis, (4) Non-inclusion 
of  other  published  data  (from  the  RE-MEDY  and  RE-SONATE  studies)  and  data  available  to  the  MAH. 
Instead, the MAH draws the attention to its own Acute Coronary Syndrome Overview (U11-3561-01). 
This  overview  was  completed  just  prior  to  the  start  of  the  current  procedure  and  is  an  extensive 
analysis  of  acute  coronary  syndrome  events  associated  with  the  use  of  dabigatran  etexilate,  and  the 
main  topics  are:  epidemiology,  non-clinical  aspects  of  atherothrombosis,  the  atrial  fibrillation  study 
(RE-LY),  the  ACS  study  (RE-DEEM),  the  venous  thromboembolism  (VTE)  studies,  meta-analyses.  The 
section in the company review on the RE-LY study in AF patients is mainly a repetition of the already 
known  and  assessed  results  of  the  study.  However,  the  MAH  emphasized  that  an  excess  of  first  MI 
occurrence  in  the  dabigatran  etexilate  treatment  arms,  compared  to  warfarin  was  still  present,  more 
than  three  months  after  their  RE-LY  study  drug  was  discontinued.  The  MAH  suggested  that  the 
difference in MI incidence rates could have been due to underlying imbalances between the treatment 
groups  rather  than  the  treatments  themselves  as  nearly  20%  of  the  MIs  in  the  dabigatran  etexilate 
treatment  groups  occurred  off  treatment.  Further  subgroup  analyses  were  presented,  and  one 
particular finding was noted, namely that in the subgroup of patients with valvular heart disease (VHD) 
at  baseline,  the  difference  in  MI  rate  favouring  warfarin  was  much  higher  than  in  the  overall 
population. The company suggested that the low rate in the warfarin-treated group could be a chance 
finding. The hazard ratios (HR) for MI and death compared to warfarin in this subgroup were close to 1 
and  similar  to  the  HRs  seen  for  the  overall  population.  The  MAH  reiterated  the  favourable  results  for 
dabigatran  etexilate  compared  to  warfarin  on  major  endpoints  and  concluded  that  overall  for  AF 
patients  receiving  dabigatran  etexilate  for  stroke  prevention,  the  small  numeric  imbalance  in  MI 
occurrence for patients receiving dabigatran etexilate compared to warfarin was outweighed by lower 
rates of stroke, vascular death, CV death, and all cause death. This conclusion was generally endorsed 
by the CHMP, but the MAH was asked to discuss whether the findings in the subgroup of patients with 
valvular  heart  disease  (VHD)  warrant  strengthening  of  the  product  information.  Following  further 
explanation the CHMP agreed with the MAH that the results from the RE-LY study on the frequency of 
MI in warfarin-treated patients with or without VHD lacked biological/clinical plausibility and were not 
readily explainable other than as a spurious finding. Further, even if it was a true finding, the current 
wording of the atrial fibrillation indication to a large extent excludes patients with VHD.

The section on the phase II dose-finding RE-DEEM study in ACS patients summarized the rates of MI 
(fatal and non-fatal) which were 1.6% for placebo and 3.0, 2.7, 1.7, and 2.3% for dabigatran etexilate 
doses  50,  75,  110,  and  150  mg  bid,  respectively.  The  MAH  noted  that  fatal  MIs  only  occurred  in  the 
placebo  and  two  lowest  dabigatran  etexilate  doses,  50  and  75  mg  bid.  In  the  high  dose  dabigatran 
etexilate  110  mg  bid  and  dabigatran  etexilate  150  mg  bid  treatment  groups  there  were  no  fatal  MIs, 
and similar total MI rates, and lower all cause death rates, compared to those receiving placebo.  
In  the  section  on  the  VTE  studies,  both  the  orthopaedic  surgery  (hip  and  knee  replacement)  primary 
prevention VTE studies and the acute VTE/secondary prevention of VTE studies were discussed. In the 
initial  three  orthopaedic  surgery  studies  (RE-MOBILIZE,  RE-MODEL  and  RE-NOVATE),  the  incidence 
rates  of  ACS  and  MI  were  low  and  comparable  between  the  dabigatran  etexilate  and  the  comparator 
used in all these studies, enoxaparin (0.39 and 0.41%, respectively). Studies in acute VTE (RE-COVER 
and  RE-COVER  II)  and  a  secondary  VTE  prevention  study  (RE-MEDY)  included  warfarin  as  an  active 
comparator and showed low incidence rates of MI, but there were numerically more MIs reported in the 
dabigatran  etexilate  treatment  groups  than  in  the  warfarin  groups,  especially  in  RE-COVER  II  and 
REMEDY. In another secondary VTE prevention study (RE-SONATE) comparing dabigatran etexilate to 
placebo (RE-SONATE), there was only one MI in each treatment group. 
The  CHMP  assessed  the  meta-analysis  conducted  by  the  company  itself.  The  meta-analysis  was 
performed to assess the frequency of MI and CV outcome events individually and in several composite 
endpoints. In a subanalysis that included only clinical trials comparing dabigatran etexilate to warfarin 
(six  studies  in  AF  and  acute  VTE/secondary  prevention  of  VTE),  there  were  more  MI  events  in  the 
dabigatran  etexilate  treatment  groups  than  those  receiving  warfarin.  From  randomization  to  study 
termination, the odds ratios (OR)  for MI (95% CI) were 1.30 (0.96, 1.76) and 1.42 (1.07, 1.88), for 
dabigatran etexilate 110 mg bid or 150 mg bid, compared to warfarin, respectively. The assessment of 
events for studies comparing dabigatran etexilate to enoxaparin (five studies, all in primary prevention 
of  VTE  in  orthopaedic  surgery)  or  placebo  (three  studies  in  primary  prevention  of  VTE  in  orthopaedic 
surgery,  secondary  prevention  of  VTE  and  treatment  of  ACS)  was  limited  due  to  smaller  treatment 
groups and infrequent outcome events, and consequently the confidence intervals were wide. The odds 
ratio  (OR)  for  MI  (95%  CI)  was  0.5  (0.22,  1.10)  for  dabigatran  etexilate  220  mg  qd  compared  to 
enoxaparin. The odds ratios (OR)  for MI (95% CI) were 1.07 (0.36, 3.20) and 1.37 (0.50, 3.70), for 
dabigatran etexilate 110 mg bid or 150 mg bid, compared to placebo, respectively. 
The pitfalls in meta-analyses on adverse events reported from  clinical trials were recently highlighted 
in a Commentary by Huang et al. (Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug safety 2011: 20: 1014-1020). The 
metaanalysis  by  Uchino  &  Hernandez  did  not  provide  sufficient  information  to  assess  whether  the 
standards recommended by Huang et al. were met. The main criticism by the MAH was that the meta-
analysis pooled a set of heterogeneous trials, and this was a valid point according to Huang et al. who 
suggested  that  meta-analyses  should  be  conducted  with  subpopulations  that  share  a  similar  benefit-
risk profile. The MAH has provided its own comprehensive overview of MI/ACS associated with the use 
of  dabigatran  etexilate.  The  overview  includes  a  meta-analysis  that  to  some  extent  addresses  the 
weaknesses of the meta-analysis by Uchino and Hernandez. When looking at the studies with warfarin 
as a comparator individually and from the meta-analysis, it appeared to be a consistent and relatively 
robust finding that the incidence of MI in patients treated with dabigatran etixilate was higher than in 
patients  treated  with  warfarin.  The  absolute  differences  were  small,  and  it  was  agreed  by  the  CHMP 
that  the  difference  is  counterbalanced  by  dabigatran  etexilate’s  beneficial  effects  in  terms  of  stroke 
reduction and lower observed rates of CV mortality and overall mortality by a solid margin. It was not 
finally  established  whether  the  difference  in  MI  rates  between  dabigatran  etixilate  and  warfarin 
represent a true adverse effect of dabigatran or is caused by a protective effect of warfarin (or both). 
To  some  extent  the  question  is  academic  and  of  limited  practical  interest  given  the  differences 
favouring  dabigatran  etixilate  over  warfarin  on  a  number  of  other  important  endpoints.  Since  no

increased  rate  of  MI  was  convincingly  shown  in  studies  where  dabigatran  etexilate  was  compared  to 
placebo or enoxaparin, it seems plausible that the imbalance in the RE-LY trial could be explained by a 
protective effect of warfarin. The dose-response relationship with regard to the incidence of MI was not 
clear-cut; some analyses suggested a dose-response relation, but in the study in ACS (RE-DEEM) the 
incidence  of  MI  was  highest  in  patients  treated  with  the  lowest  doses  of  dabigatran  etixilate.  In 
conclusion, the MAH response regarding this issue was considered by the CHMP as satisfactory.  
The  CHMP  requested  in  addition  an  analysis  of  post-marketing  reports  of  myocardial  infarction/acute 
coronary  syndrome  in  the  perspective  of  what  was  observed  in  the  clinical  trials  with  Pradaxa,  in 
particular  the  RE-LY  study.  The  approach  taken  by  the  MAH  for  answering  this  question  was  very 
similar  to  the  approach  taken  when  addressing  the  fatal  bleedings  topic.  The  MAH  has  performed  a 
worldwide  search  for  spontaneous  and  health  authority  individual  case  safety  reports  (ICSRs)  that 
concern  the  MedDRA  terms  “myocardial  infarction”,  “angina  unstable”,  “ECG  signs  of  myocardial 
ischaemia”  and  “myocardial ischaemia”.  The  cut-off date  for  the  data  was  31  October  2011.  This  has 
resulted in the identification of 133 ICSRs. For myocardial infarction alone, 126 cases were identified. 
In  44  patients,  a  fatal  outcome  was  reported.  The  majority  of  the  cases  were  reported  from  North 
America.  No  indication  was  reported  in  52  cases,  atrial  fibrillation  was  the  indication  in  62  cases, 
primary  VTE  prevention  in  17  cases,  and  off-label  use  in  2  cases.  As  seen  with  the  reports  on  fatal 
bleedings, information about demographics, other baseline characteristics and concomitant medication 
was  lacking  in  a  large  proportion  of  the  reports.  Looking  at  the  information  that  was  available,  there 
were no major unexpected findings with regard to gender and age distribution for the post-marketing 
reported events compared to the events observed in the RE-LY study. However, the proportion of very 
old patients was higher in the post-marketing reported cases. The MAH has compared the occurrence 
of  MI/ACS  reports  post-marketing  with  the  rate  of  MI  observed  in  the  RE-LY  study.  A  cumulative 
reporting  rate  has  been  calculated  based  on  the  number  of  individual  case  safety  reports  (ICSRs)  (= 
numerator)  and  global  bulk  sales  (=  denominator).  The  resulting  post-marketing  MI/ACS  rate  was 
estimated to be 3.2 per 10,000 patient years. In comparison, the rate was about 80 per 10,000 patient 
years  in  the  RE-LY  study.  Further,  the  MAH  compared  the  occurrence  of  fatal  MI/ACS  reports  post-
marketing  with  the  rate  of  fatal  MI  (calculated  from  the  adjudication  categories  of  vascular  death  as 
sudden  and  non-sudden  cardiac  death  occurring  after  a  recent  MI)  in  the  RE-LY  study.  The  resulting 
post-marketing fatal MI/ACS rate is estimated to be 1.1 per 10,000 patient years. In comparison, the 
rate  was  6.8  per  10,000  patient  years  in  the  RE-LY  study  (the  two  does  combined).  The  MAH 
concluded  that  the  post-marketing  MI/ACS  and  fatal  MI/ACS  rates  for  dabigatran  etexilate  were 
substantially  less  than  the  respective  rates  seen  in  the  RE-LY  groups  for  both  doses  of  dabigatran 
etexilate. The CHMP agreed that the reported rates of MI in the post-marketing setting were many-fold 
lower than observed in the RE-LY study. There was no suggestion that the MI rate in patients treated 
with Pradaxa in the clinical setting was larger than in the RE-LY study. Similarly to what was requested 
for  fatal  bleedings,  the  MAH  was  asked  to  provide  an  estimate  of  the  actual  drug  consumption  post-
marketing  and  to  repeat  the  calculation  of  the  cumulative  post-marketing  MI/ACS  rate  on  this  basis 
(drug in stock should be excluded from the denominator). The MAH was also requested to comment on 
the likely level of under-reporting of MI/ACS. The point made by the MAH in response document that 
coronary  ischemia  and  associated  events  would  typically  not  raise  strong  suspicion  of  a  causal 
association  with  anticoagulant  therapy  and  consequently  may  be  subject  to  more  pronounced 
underreporting than bleeding events was supported. Even with most conservative (i.e. highest) rate of 
MI/ACS reports post-marketing (40.0 per 100,000 patient years), it was still many-fold lower than the 
rate of MI observed in the RE-LY study (about 800 per 100,000 patient years). Please note that in the 
last  round  of  company  responses,  the  rates  were  given  as  cases  per  10,000  patient  years.  Overall, 
post-marketing MI/ACS and fatal MI/ACS rates for dabigatran etexilate are substantially less than the 
respective  rates  seen  in  the  RE-LY  groups  for  both  doses  of  dabigatran  etexilate  and  there  was  no 
suggestion that the MI rate in patients treated with Pradaxa in the clinical setting is larger than in the

RE-LY  study.  It  is  the  position  of  the  MAH  that  no  changes  are  needed  in  the  SmPC  following  the 
results  of  the  meta-analysis  and  the  analysis  mentioned  above.  The  CHMP  agreed  that  the  current 
wording in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC on MI is balanced.  
The MAH has provided the RE-LY coagulation biomarker substudy findings, which described the levels 
of  D-dimer,  prothrombin  fragment  1+2  (PF1,2),  factor  VIIa  (FVIIa)  and  soluble  tissue  factor  (sTF)  at 
baseline  and  their  relation  to  outcome  events,  in  order  to  justify  that  there  is  no  pathophysiological 
mechanism  associated  with  dabigatran  resulting  in  an  increased  risk  of  MI.  However,  it  was  widely 
accepted  that  the  pathophysiological  mechanism  for  MI  mainly  involves  platelet  activation  and, 
consistently, antiplatelet therapy is the main pharmacological treatment after an ACS. Despite the fact 
that  the  PETRO  dose-finding  study  with  dabigatran  showed  an 
increase 
in  urinary  11-
dehydrothromboxane B2 (DTB2), which could be a marker of platelet activation (Ezekowitz et al. Am J 
Cardiol.  2007),  the  RE-LY  coagulation  biomarker  substudy  did  not  address  this  issue.  The  MAH  was 
requested 
to  discuss  any 
clinical/preclinical  data 
suggesting  an 
increase 
in  platelet 
aggregation/activation  with  dabigatran  either  during  treatment  or  early  after  stopping  dabigatran.  In 
particular,  the  increase  in  urinary  11-dehydrothromboxane  B2  (DTB2)  in  the  PETRO  study,  which 
“needs  resolution”,  according  to  the  authors’  conclusions,  was  asked  to  be  addressed  by  the  MAH, 
since it may be a consequence of a potential platelet activation by dabigatran. The MAH has provided a 
brief  overview  of  the  non-clinical  evidence  relating  to  thrombosis,  atherothrombosis  and  platelet 
aggregation. With  regard  to  the  latter,  there  appear  to  be  conflicting  results in  that  the  PETRO  study 
showed  an  increase  in  urinary  11-dehydrothromboxane  B2  (DTB2)  whereas  this  was  not  the  case  in 
the RE-LY study. Additional non-clinical information will be available soon and will be assessed within 
the  upcoming  studies  (included  already  previously  in  the  RMP).  The  non-clinical  data  will  obviously 
have  to  be  seen  in  the  context  of  the  clinical  data.  The  response  by  the  MAH  was  considered 
satisfactory. 
General issues 
The MAH was requested to explain their follow-up procedures for serious ADRs and how they intend to 
improve  the  quality  of  spontaneous  reports.  The  MAH  has  in  its  response  outlined  the  company’s 
standard procedures to obtain follow-up information on spontaneously reported adverse events. These 
procedures  are  in  line  with  what  is  typically  seen  in  the  pharmaceutical  industry.  It  is  noted  that  the 
MAH  uses  event  specific  questionnaires  in  order  to  obtain  more  specific  information  about  certain 
events/event  categories  and  that  the  MAH  in  last  quarter  of  2011  introduced  a  bleeding  event 
questionnaire.  The  latter  is  obviously  relevant  for  the  recording  of  bleeding  events  associated  with 
Pradaxa.  Further,  the  MAH  stated  that  it  has  intensified  the  follow-up  on  reported  adverse  events  in 
the  second  half  of  2011  and  that  improvements  have  been  observed  from  Q1  2011  to  Q4  2011  on  a 
number of parameters.  While the quality of post-marketing reports to a high degree is dependent on 
the procedures implemented by the MAH, it should also be acknowledged that poor quality and lack of 
information in post-marketing reports is inevitable in a substantial proportion of the cases - even with 
the  best  intentions  and  efforts  by  the  pharmaceutical  company.  The  MAH’s  response  was  considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.2.  Discussion 
Fatal bleeding events  
In  December  2011  the  MAH  was  asked  to  perform  a  worldwide  search  for  spontaneous  and  health 
authority  individual  case  safety  reports  (ICSRs)  that  concern  A)  fatal  bleeding  events  or  B)  serious 
bleeding  cases  where  another  cause  of  death  was  reported  or  the  cause  of  death  was  unknown  in 
patients  treated  with  dabigatran  etexilate.  This  has  resulted  in  the  identification  of  340  ICSRs.  These 
Assessment report  
EMA/556143/2012  
Page 28/43
 
 
 
 
 
 
included 260 cases of fatal bleedings (A) and 80 serious bleeding cases with another or unknown cause 
of  death  reported  (B).  In  total,  the  340  cases  had  reported  449  bleeding  events  as  some  subjects 
experienced more than one event. The MAH has provided an extensive spreadsheet encompassing all 
the  aforementioned  340  cases  and  including  information  as  requested  in  the  question  with  the 
exception of renal function which has been addressed separately. Overall, this approach taken by the 
MAH  was  supported  by  the  CHMP,  although  an  elaborate  discussion  of  the  presented  data  was 
additionally  requested.  The  analysis  was  hampered  by  the  missing  or  incomplete  data  typically 
associated with post-marketing reports. According to the CHMP it did not reveal risk factors or findings 
that have not already been adequately addressed in the revised SmPC for Pradaxa (such as high age 
and  impaired  renal  function).  It  was  evident  that  a  substantial  number  of  very  old  patients  were 
treated with doses higher than recommended in the EU SmPC.  
From  a  calculation  based  on  the  search  results  described  above  as  numerator  and  the  bulk  sales 
figures as denominator, the resulting post-marketing fatal bleeding rate was estimated to be 6.3 (Fatal 
A  events)  and  8.3  (Fatal  B  events)  per  10,000  patient  years  (please  see  definition  of  Fatal  A  and  B 
events under question 1b). In comparison, it was 16.6 for the 110 mg BID dose and 19.5 for the 150 
mg BID dose in the RE-LY study. The rate was 31.0 for warfarin in the RE-LY study. There was no solid 
evidence to suggest that the fatal bleeding rate in patients treated with Pradaxa in the clinical setting 
was  larger  than  in  the  RE-LY  study.  However,  the  denominator  for  the  calculation  may  have  been 
overestimated  due  to  sold  drug  not  actually  having  been  taken  by  patients.  Consequently,  the  MAH 
provided an estimate of the actual drug consumption post-marketing and repeat the calculation of the 
cumulative  post-marketing  bleeding  rate  and  also  discussed  the  likely  level  of  underreporting.  The 
information provided was considered reassuring by the CHMP.  
Finally, an update on the development of a reversal agent/antidote for  dabigatran has  been provided 
by  the  MAH.  The  MAH  commented  on  two  recent  publications  on  serious  bleedings  related  to  acute 
injury/trauma  and  provided  an  analysis  of  the  topic  with  data  both  from  clinical  trials  and  from  post-
marketing reports. In light of the lack of an antidote the detailed information on recommended medical 
management  of  bleeding  events  associated  with  the  use  of  Pradaxa  was  included  into  the  product 
information  and  the  RMP  for  Pradaxa.  In  addition  an  advice  from  the  Ad  Hoc  experts  Group  was 
requested  in  this  regard  by  the  CHMP  and  the  modifications  to  the  SmPC  were  supported  by  the 
experts.  
In conclusion, several sections of the SmPC were modified to provide further more specific guidance to 
the prescribers to diminish the risk related to bleeding events in patients taking Pradaxa. Furthermore 
educational materials were updated and should further diminish this risk.  
Myocardial infarction/acute coronary syndrome 
The  objective  of  the  meta-analysis  by  Ken  Uchino  and  Adrian  V  Hernandez  (Circulation.  2011;  124: 
A15500) was to systematically evaluate the risk of MI or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with the use 
of  dabigatran  etexilate  for  several  indications.  Seven  trials  encompassing  31,097  patients  were 
selected. Control arms included warfarin, enoxaparin or placebo. The analysis indicated that dabigatran 
etexilate  was  significantly  associated  with  a  higher  risk  for  MI  or  ACS  than  the  control  group 
(dabigatran  etexilate  255/20718=1.23%  vs.  control  91/10379=0.88%;  OR  1.31,  95%  CI  1.03-1.67). 
The  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  poster  by  Uchino  and  Hernandez  does  not  provide  sufficient 
information  to  assess  whether  the  standards  recommended  for  meta-analyses  were  met.  The  main 
criticism  by  the  MAH  was  that  the  meta-analysis  pooled  a  set  of  heterogeneous  trials,  and  this  was 
considered to be a valid point by the CHMP. The MAH has provided its own comprehensive overview of 
MI/ACS associated with the use of dabigatran etexilate. The overview included a meta-analysis that to 
some extent addresses the weaknesses of the meta-analysis by Uchino and Hernandez. When looking 
Assessment report

at the studies with warfarin as a comparator individually and from the meta-analysis, it appeared to be 
a  consistent  and  relatively  robust  finding  that  the  incidence  of  MI  in  patients  treated  with  dabigatran 
etixilate was higher than in patients treated with warfarin. The absolute differences were small, and it 
was  agreed  by  the  CHMP  that  the  difference  was  counterbalanced  by  dabigatran  etexilate’s  beneficial 
effects in terms of stroke reduction and lower observed rates of CV mortality and overall mortality by a 
solid margin. 
Based on the current level of evidence it could not be finally established whether the difference in MI 
rates between dabigatran etixilate and warfarin represented a true adverse effect of dabigatran or was 
caused  by  a  protective  effect  of  warfarin  (or  both).  To  some  extent  the  question  was  considered 
academic  and  of  limited  practical  interest  given  the  differences  favouring  dabigatran  etixilate  over 
warfarin  on  a  number  of  other  important  endpoints.  Since  no  increased  rate  of  MI  was  convincingly 
shown  in  studies  where  dabigatran  etexilate  was  compared  to  placebo  or  enoxaparin,  it  seemed 
plausible that the imbalance in the RE-LY trial could be explained by a protective effect of warfarin. The 
dose-response  relationship  with  regard  to  the  incidence  of  MI  was  not  clear-cut;  some  analyses 
suggest a dose-response relation, but in the study in ACS (RE-DEEM) the incidence of MI was highest 
in patients treated with the lowest doses of dabigatran etixilate. Overall, the CHMP concluded that the 
MAH responded to the Uchino and Hernandez analysis satisfactory.  
The MAH has compared the occurrence of MI/ACS reports post-marketing with the rate of MI observed 
in the RE-LY study. A cumulative reporting rate has been calculated based on the number of individual 
case safety reports (ICSRs) (= numerator) and global bulk sales (= denominator). The resulting post-
marketing MI/ACS rate was estimated to be 3.2 per 10,000 patient years. In comparison, the rate was 
about 80 per 10,000 patient years in the RE-LY study. It was agreed that the reported rates of MI in 
the  post-marketing  setting  are  many-fold  lower  than  observed  in  the  RE-LY  study.  There  was  no 
suggestion that the MI rate in patients treated with Pradaxa in the clinical setting is larger than in the 
RE-LY study. It was the position of the MAH supported by the CHMP that no changes were needed in 
the SmPC. It was agreed that the current wording in section 4.4 and 4.8 on MI is balanced.  
The conclusion of the CHMP is that the apparent excess risk of MI in atrial fibrillation patients treated 
with Pradaxa compared to patients treated with warfarin continues to be outweighed by lower rates of 
stroke, vascular death, CV death, and all cause death in the opinion of the CHMP.  
Conclusions pertaining to both fatal bleedings and MI/ACS 
The  poor  quality  of  the  spontaneous  reports  and  the  level  of  missing  information  for  several 
parameters was a concern.  For example, only 12.9% of bleeding cases included information regarding 
renal  status.  Similarly  only  a  small  number  of  cases  provided  details  of  past  medical  history, 
concomitant medications, time to onset etc.  The MAH explained their follow-up procedures for serious 
ADRs  and  how  they  intend  to  improve  the  quality  of  spontaneous  reports.  This  response  was 
considered  satisfactory  by  the  CHMP  and  the  Committee  agreed  that  the  benefit-risk  of  Pradaxa 
remains positive.  
2.3.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan within this variation procedure which included a 
risk  minimisation  plan.  In  the  updated  RMP  the  educational  materials  were  brought  in  line  with  the 
SmPC modifications. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that no new 
pharmacovigilance activities in addition to those already being performed were needed to monitor the 
safety of the product. No new additional risk minimisation activities were required.

2.4.  Changes to the Product Information 
Main modifications agreed by the CHMP to be included in the SmPC for Pradaxa were following: 
- Section 4.2 of the SmPC was reorganised to improve the readability of the SmPC and to add the 
information about the recommended method to assess the renal function; 
- In Section 4.3 previous contraindication: “Organic lesions at risk of bleeding” was modified into 
“Lesion or condition at significant risk of major bleeding such as current or recent gastrointestinal 
ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent brain or spinal injury, 
recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, known or suspected 
oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or 
intracerebral vascular abnormalities”; 
- In Section 4.3 previous contraindication: “Spontaneous or pharmacological impairement of 
hemostasis” was modified into: “Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulant agent e.g. 
unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin etc), heparin derivatives 
(fondaparinux etc), oral anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, apixaban etc) except under the 
circumstances of switching therapy to or from Pradaxa (see section 4.2); 
- In section 4.4 Table 1 (Summarises factors which may increase the haemorrhagic risk) was revised 
and aligned with the modified contraindications; 
- In section 4.5 the information about concomitant use of Pradaxa and anticoagulant and antiplatelet 
aggregation agents was modified; 
- In section 4.9 the information was included to improve the medical management of major bleedings 
in patients taking Pradaxa; 
- In section 5.1 the information about the major bledding events related to the concomitant use of 
antiplatelets, ASA or clopidogrel and both dabigatran etexilate and warfarin, was included. 
The below listed changes were agreed by the CHMP to the Product Information (PI): 
Pradaxa 75 mg 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
“For  the  following  groups  the  recommended  daily  dose  of  Pradaxa  is  150 mg  taken  once  daily  as 
2 capsules of 75 mg: 
 
Patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment  (creatinine  clearance,  CrCL 30-50 ml/min)  [see  Renal 
impairment (prevention of VTE)] 
Patients  who  receive  concomitant  verapamil,  amiodarone,  quinidine  [see  Concomitant  use  of 
Pradaxa  with  strong  P-glycoprotein  (P-gp)  inhibitors,  i.e.  amidarone,  quinidine  or  verapamil 
(prevention of VTE)] 
Patients aged 75 or above [see Elderly (prevention of VTE)]” 
 
 
“..Assessment of renal function (prevention of VTE): 
In all patients: 
 
Renal function should be assessed by calculating the creatine clearance (CrCL) prior to initiation 
of  treatment  with  Pradaxa  to  exclude  patients  with  severe  renal 
impairment  (i.e. 
CrCL < 30 ml/min)  (see  sections  4.3,  4.4  and  5.2).  Pradaxa  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with 
severe renal impairment 
Renal  function  should  also  be  assessed  when  a  decline  in  renal  function  is  suspected  during 
treatment (e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and with certain co-medications)

The  method  used  to  estimate  renal  function  (CrCL  in  ml/min)  during  the  clinical  development  of 
Pradaxa was the Cockgroft-Gault method. The formula is as follows: 
 
For creatinine in mol/l: 
1.23  (140-age [years])  weight [kg] ( 0.85 if female) 
serum creatinine [mol/l] 
 
For creatinine in mg/dl: 
(140-age [years])  weight [kg] ( 0.85 if female) 
   72  serum creatinine [mg/dl] 
This method is recommended when assessing patients’ CrCL prior to and during Pradaxa treatment.”

“As  with  all  anticoagulants,  dabigatran  etexilate  should  be  used  with  caution  in  conditions  with  an 
increased  risk  of  bleeding  and  in  situations  with  concomitant  use  of  drugs  affecting  haemostasis  by 
inhibition  of  platelet  aggregation.  Bleeding  can  occur  at  any  site  during  therapy  with  dabigatran.  An 
unexplained  fall  in  haemoglobin  and/or  haematocrit  or  blood  pressure  should  lead  to  a  search  for  a 
bleeding site.” 
“Use of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), clopidogrel or non steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), as well 
as  the  presence  of  esophagitis,  gastritis  or  gastroesophageal  reflux  requiring  proton  pump  inhibitors 
(PPI)  or  histamine  2  (H2)-blocker  treatment  increase  the  risk  of  GI  bleeding.  The  administration  of  a

The  presence  of  lesions,  conditions,  procedures  and/or  pharmacological  treatment  (such  as  NSAIDs, 
antiplatelets, SSRIs and SNRIs, see section 4.5), which significantly increase the risk of major bleeding 
requires  a  careful  benefit-risk  assessment.  Pradaxa  should  only  be  given  if  the  benefit  outweighs 
bleeding risks. 
4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
“There is no or only limited experience with the following treatments have not been studied and which 
may  increase  the  risk  of  bleeding  when  used  concomitantly  with  Pradaxa:  anticoagulants  such  as 
unfractionated  heparin  (UFH),  low  molecular  weight  heparins  (LMWH),  and  heparin  derivatives 
(fondaparinux,  desirudin),  thrombolytic  agents,  and  vitamin  K  antagonists,  rivaroxaban  or  other  oral 
anticoagulants  (see  section  4.3),  and  platelet  aggregation  agents  such  as  GPIIb/IIIa  receptor 
antagonists, ticlopidine, prasugrel, ticagrelor, dextran and sulfinpyrazone, rivaroxaban, and vitamin K 
antagonists (see section 4.4). 
“UFH can be administered at doses necessary to maintain a patent central venous or arterial catheter 
(see sections 4.34.2 and 4.4).” 
4.9  Overdose 
“Activated prothrombin complex concentrates (e.g., FEIBA) or recombinant Factor VIIa or concentrates 
of  coagulation  factors  II,  IX  and  X,  may  be  considered.  There  is  some  experimental  evidence  to 
support the role of these agents in reversing the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, but data on their 
usefulness in clinical settings and also on the possible risk of rebound thromboembolism is very limited. 
Coagulation  tests  may  become  unreliable  following  adminstration  of  suggested  reversing  agents. 
Caution  should  be  exercised  when  interpreting  these  tests.  Consideration  should  also  be  given  to 
administration  of  platelet  concentrates  in  cases  where  thrombocytopenia  is  present  or  long  acting 
antiplatelet  drugs  have  been  used.  All  symptomatic  treatment  should  be  given  according  to  the 
physician's judgement. 
Depending on local availability, a consultation of a coagulation expert should be considered in case of 
major bleedings”

« In  a  study  of  prevention  of  stroke  and  SEE  in  adult  patients  with  nonvalvular  atrial  fibrillation, 
Ddabigatran  etexilate  was  associated  with  higher  rates  of  major  gastrointestinal  (GI)  bleeding  which 
was statistically significant for dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily. This increased risk was seen in 
the elderly (≥ 75 years). Use of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), clopidogrel or non steroidal antiinflammatory 
drug  (NSAID),  as  well  as  the  presence  of  esophagitis,  gastritis  or  gastroesophageal  reflux  requiring 
proton pump inhibitors (PPI) or histamine 2 (H2)-blocker treatment increase the risk of GI bleeding. In 
these  atrial  fibrillationpatients  a  dosage  of  220 mg  dabigatran  given  as  110 mg  capsule  twice  daily 
should be considered and posology recommendations in section 4.2 be followed. The administration of

4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
“Anticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation agents 
“There is no or only limited experience with the following treatments have not been studied and which 
may  increase  the  risk  of  bleeding  when  used  concomitantly  with  Pradaxa:  anticoagulants  such  as 
unfractionated  heparin  (UFH),  low  molecular  weight  heparins  (LMWH),  and  heparin  derivatives 
(fondaparinux,  desirudin),  thrombolytic  agents,  and  vitamin  K  antagonists,  rivaroxaban  or  other  oral 
anticoagulants  (see  section  4.3),  and  platelet  aggregation  agents  such  as  GPIIb/IIIa  receptor 
antagonists, ticlopidine, prasugrel, ticagrelor, dextran and sulfinpyrazone, rivaroxaban, and vitamin K 
antagonists (see section 4.4). 
“From  the  limited  data  collected  in  the  phase  III  study  RE  LY  in  patients  with  atrial  fibrillation  it  was 
observed that the concomitant use of other oral or parenteral anticoagulants increases major bleeding 
rates  with  both  dabigatran  etexilate  and  warfarin  by  approximately  2.5-fold,  mainly  related  to 
situations when switching from one anticoagulant to another (see section 4.3).” 
“UFH can be administered at doses necessary to maintain a patent central venous or arterial catheter 
(see sections 4.34.2 and 4.4).” 
Clopidogrel  and  ASA:  From  the  data  collected  in  the  phase  III  study  RE-LY  (see  section  5.1)  it  was 
observed  that  the  concomitant  use  of  antiplatelets,  ASA  or  clopidogrel  approximately  doubles  major 
bleeding  rates  with  both  dabigatran  etexilate  and  warfarin  (see  section  4.4).  ASA  or  clopidogrel 
co-medication with dabigatran etexilate at dosages of 110 mg or 150 mg twice daily may increase the 
risk  of  major  bleeding  (see  section  4.4).  The  higher  rate  of  bleeding  events  by  ASA  or  clopidogrel 
co-medication was also observed for warfarin.”

Renal function should be assessed by calculating the CrCL prior to initiation of treatment with Pradaxa 
to exclude patients with severe renal impairment (i.e. CrCL < 30 ml/min)]. 
While  on  treatment  renal  function  should  be  assessed  at  least  once  a  year  or  more  frequently  as 
needed  in  certain  clinical  situations  when  it  is  suspected  that  the  renal  function  could  decline  or 
deteriorate (such as hypovolemia, dehydration, and with certain comedications, etc).”

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Haemorrhagic risk 
“As  with  all  anticoagulants,  dabigatran  etexilate  should  be  used  with  caution  in  conditions  with  an 
increased  risk  of  bleeding  and  in  situations  with  concomitant  use  of  drugs  affecting  haemostasis  by 
inhibition  of  platelet  aggregation.  Bleeding  can  occur  at  any  site  during  therapy  with  dabigatran.  An 
unexplained  fall  in  haemoglobin  and/or  haematocrit  or  blood  pressure  should  lead  to  a  search  for  a 
bleeding site.” 
« In  a  study  of  prevention  of  stroke  and  SEE  in  adult  patients  with  nonvalvular  atrial  fibrillation, 
Ddabigatran  etexilate  was  associated  with  higher  rates  of  major  gastrointestinal  (GI)  bleeding  which 
was statistically significant for dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily. This increased risk was seen in 
the elderly (≥ 75 years). Use of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), clopidogrel or non steroidal antiinflammatory 
drug  (NSAID),  as  well  as  the  presence  of  esophagitis,  gastritis  or  gastroesophageal  reflux  requiring

proton pump inhibitors (PPI) or histamine 2 (H2)-blocker treatment increase the risk of GI bleeding. In 
these  atrial  fibrillationpatients  a  dosage  of  220 mg  dabigatran  given  as  110 mg  capsule  twice  daily 
should be considered and posology recommendations in section 4.2 be followed. The administration of 
a PPI can be considered to prevent GI bleeding. »

The  presence  of  lesions,  conditions,  procedures  and/or  pharmacological  treatment  (such  as  NSAIDs, 
antiplatelets, SSRIs and SNRIs, see section 4.5), which significantly increase the risk of major bleeding 
requires  a  careful  benefit-risk  assessment.  Pradaxa  should  only  be  given  if  the  benefit  outweighs 
bleeding risks. 
4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
“Anticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation agents 
“There is no or only limited experience with the following treatments have not been studied and which 
may  increase  the  risk  of  bleeding  when  used  concomitantly  with  Pradaxa:  anticoagulants  such  as 
unfractionated  heparin  (UFH),  low  molecular  weight  heparins  (LMWH),  and  heparin  derivatives 
(fondaparinux,  desirudin),  thrombolytic  agents,  and  vitamin  K  antagonists,  rivaroxaban  or  other  oral 
anticoagulants  (see  section  4.3),  and  platelet  aggregation  agents  such  as  GPIIb/IIIa  receptor

antagonists, ticlopidine, prasugrel, ticagrelor, dextran and sulfinpyrazone, rivaroxaban, and vitamin K 
antagonists (see section 4.4). 
“From  the  limited  data  collected  in  the  phase  III  study  RE  LY  in  patients  with  atrial  fibrillation  it  was 
observed that the concomitant use of other oral or parenteral anticoagulants increases major bleeding 
rates  with  both  dabigatran  etexilate  and  warfarin  by  approximately  2.5-fold,  mainly  related  to 
situations when switching from one anticoagulant to another (see section 4.3).” 
“UFH can be administered at doses necessary to maintain a patent central venous or arterial catheter 
(see sections 4.34.2 and 4.4).” 
Clopidogrel  and  ASA:  From  the  data  collected  in  the  phase  III  study  RE-LY  (see  section  5.1)  it  was 
observed  that  the  concomitant  use  of  antiplatelets,  ASA  or  clopidogrel  approximately  doubles  major 
bleeding  rates  with  both  dabigatran  etexilate  and  warfarin  (see  section  4.4).  ASA  or  clopidogrel 
co-medication with dabigatran etexilate at dosages of 110 mg or 150 mg twice daily may increase the 
risk  of  major  bleeding  (see  section  4.4).  The  higher  rate  of  bleeding  events  by  ASA  or  clopidogrel 
co-medication was also observed for warfarin.” 
“From  the  data  collected  in  the  phase  III  study  RE-LY  (see  section  5.1)  it  was  observed  that  ASA  or 
clopidogrel  co-medication  with  dabigatran  etexilate  at  dosages  of  110 mg  or  150 mg  twice  daily  may 
increase  the  risk  of  major  bleeding  (see  section  4.4).  The  higher  rate  of  bleeding  events  by  ASA  or 
clopidogrel co-medication was also observed for warfarin” 
4.9  Overdose 
“Activated prothrombin complex concentrates (e.g., FEIBA) or recombinant Factor VIIa or concentrates 
of  coagulation  factors  II,  IX  and  X,  may  be  considered.  There  is  some  experimental  evidence  to 
support the role of these agents in reversing the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, but data on their 
usefulness in clinical settings and also on the possible risk of rebound thromboembolism is very limited. 
Coagulation  tests  may  become  unreliable  following  adminstration  of  suggested  reversing  agents. 
Caution  should  be  exercised  when  interpreting  these  tests.  Consideration  should  also  be  given  to 
administration  of  platelet  concentrates  in  cases  where  thrombocytopenia  is  present  or  long  acting 
antiplatelet  drugs  have  been  used.  All  symptomatic  treatment  should  be  given  according  to  the 
physician's judgement. 
Depending on local availability, a consultation of a coagulation expert should be considered in case of 
major bleedings” 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
“The concomitant use of antiplatelets ASA or clopidogrel approximately doubles MBE rates with both 
dabigatran etexilate and warfarin.”

The consecutive changes were introduced into the Annex IIIB and were agreed by the CHMP. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
In  December  2011  the  CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to  provide  the  tabulated  description  of  all  fatal 
bleeding  cases  associated  with  Pradaxa  use, in light of  the  significant increase  in  the  number  of  fatal 
bleeding  events  associated  with  the  use  of  Pradaxa  since  the  completion  of  variation  Pradaxa 
EMEA/H/C/000829/II/0022.  The  MAH  was  asked  to  provide  an  in-depth  analysis  and  discussion  of 
whether  the  occurrence  of  fatal  bleedings  events  in  the  real-world  setting  observed  so  far  is  higher 
than  expected  from  the  RE-LY  study  results.  In  addition,  a  recent  meta-analysis  by  Ken  Uchino  and 
Adrian  V  Hernandez  was  published  (Circulation.  2011;  124:  A15500)  where  it  was  suggested  that 
Pradaxa  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  myocardial  infarction/acute  coronary  syndrome.  The 
MAH was requested to provide its view on the meta-analysis. The assessment of these responses was 
done within the ARs for FUM 029 and for FU2 029.1. In addition an Ad Hoc Experts Group meeting on 
Pradaxa  was  convened  on  6th  March  2012  to  advise  the  CHMP  in  particular  on  the  possible 
improvement in prevention and medical management of bleeding events related to the use of Pradaxa. 
Current  variation  was  submitted  to  update  the  SmPC  with  regards  to  the  contraindications  and 
warnings  related  to  haemorrhagic  risk  factors  and  to  respond  to  additional  questions  as  requested  in 
the ARs for FUM 029 and FU2 029.1.  
Following  the  assessment  of  all  the  information  provided  by  the  MAH  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the 
benefit-risk for Pradaxa remains positive.   
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore  recommends  the  variation  to  the  terms  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation,  concerning  the 
following change(s): 
Variation accepted 
Type 
C.I.4 
Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC 
II 
due in particular to new quality, pre-clinical, clinical or 
pharmacovigilance data 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.9 (all 3 strengths) and 5.1 (110 and 150 mg strengths) of the 
SmPC  in  order  to  minimise  the  risk  related  to  bleeding  events  in  patients  treated  with  Pradaxa 
following the AR for FUM 029. The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC and Package Leaflet.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Bexsero (rMenB+OMV NZ) vaccine was first registered in the European Union (EU), through the 
centralized procedure on 14 January 2013, and has received marketing authorization in twelve 
additional (non-EU) countries. The current therapeutic indication in the rMenB+OMV NZ Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) is for active immunization of individuals from 2 months of age and 
older against invasive meningococcal disease caused by N meningitidis serogroup (or group) B. 
The MAH stated that (V102_19) is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Bexsero (rMenB+OMV NZ) was used as a comparator in this study. Standard formulation of Bexsero 
was used in this study. 
The licensed rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine (volume 0,5 ml) contains 50 µg of recombinant Neisserial 
Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) fusion protein (also referred to as recombinant protein [rp]287-953), 
50 µg ofrecombinant Neisseria adhesin A (NadA) protein (rp961c), 50 µg of recombinant factor H 
binding protein (fHbp) fusion protein (rp936-741), 25 µg of Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMV) from 
Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B strain NZ98/254 containing PorA P 1.4 (the immunodominant 
antigen present in the OMV component), and 1,5 mg of aluminium hydroxide as adjuvant adsorbent. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction

Description 
In study V 102_19, immune responses to an investigational Meningococcal MenABCWY vaccine have 
been assessed and compared with responses to 2 licensed vaccines, Menveo (Meningococcal group A, 
C, W-135, and Y conjugate vaccine, referred to as MenACWY throughout this document) and Bexsero 
(Meningococcal group B vaccine, referred to as rMenB+OMV NZ or rMenBOMV) when administered 
concomitantly (in the same arm or in 2 different arms) or either vaccine alone. 
The purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether there is a potential immune interference 
(possible lymph nodes stress) when MenABCWY (the combination vaccine consisting of MenACWY 
lyophilized component and rMenB+OMV NZ liquid component) is administered to healthy adolescents 
and adults following a 2-dose vaccination schedule with doses administered 2 months apart. Bexsero 
and Menveo were used as comparators in this study. 
Methods

Primary Objective: 
• 
To assess the immune response to 2 doses of MenABCWY, rMenB+OMV NZ, or rMenB+OMV NZ 
and MenACWY administered concomitantly in the same arm or in 2 different arms, and to a 
single dose of MenACWY at 1 month after the last vaccination 
Secondary Objectives: 
• 
Immunogenicity objective: to assess the immune response to 2 doses of MenABCWY, 
rMenB+OMV NZ, or rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY administered concomitantly in the same 
arm or in 2 different arms at 1 month after the first vaccination 
•  Safety objective: to assess the safety and tolerability of 2 doses of MenABCWY, rMenB+OMV 
NZ, or rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY administered concomitantly in the same arm or in 2 
different arms, and to a single dose of MenACWY

Study V 102_19 was a Phase Il, open-label, randomised, controlled study conducted at 16 centres in 
the Czech Republic. A total of 500 subjects (10-25 years old at the time of first vaccination) were 
randomised (1:1:1:1:1) to 5 groups and received vaccinations as follows: 
MenABCWY study group: 1 intramuscular (IM) dose of MenABCWY twice, 2 months apart. 
rMenBOMV+ACWY_S study group: concomitantly received 1 IM dose of rMenB+OMV NZ and 1 IM 
dose of MenACWY in the same arm (approximately 2.5 cm apart) twice, 2 months apart. 
rMenBOMV+ACWY_D study group: concomitantly received 1 IM dose of rMenB+OMV NZ and 1 IM 
dose of MenACWY in 2 different arms twice, 2 months apart. 
rMenBOMV study group: 1 IM dose of rMenB+OMV NZ twice, 2 months apart. 
MenACWY study group: 1 IM dose of MenACWY once.

Study population /Sample size 
Approximately 500 subjects were planned to be randomly assigned at a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the 
following 5 study groups, with stratification by age group within each group (10 to 17 years and 18 to 
25 years): 
Treatments 
•  MenABCWY: Approximately 100 subjects (50 subjects aged 10 to 17 years and 50 subjects aged 
18 to 25 years) were to receive 1 intramuscular (IM) dose of MenABCWY twice, 2 months apart. 
• 
• 
• 
rMenBOMV+ACWY_S: Approximately 100 subjects (50 subjects aged 10 to 17 years and 50 
subjects aged 18 to 25 years) were to concomitantly receive 1 IM dose of rMenB+OMV NZ and 1 
IM dose of MenACWY in the same arm (approximately 2.5 cm apart) twice, 2 months apart. 
rMenBOMV+ACWY_D: Approximately 100 subjects (50 subjects aged 10 to 17 years and 50 
subjects aged 18 to 25 years) were to concomitantly receive 1 IM dose of rMenB+OMV NZ and 1 
IM dose of MenACWY in 2 different arms twice, 2 months apart. 
rMenBOMV: Approximately 100 subjects (50 subjects aged 10 to 17 years and 50 subjects aged 
18 to 25 years) were to receive 1 IM dose of rMenB+OMV NZ twice, 2 months apart. 
•  MenACWY: Approximately 100 subjects (50 subjects aged 10 to 17 years and 50 subjects aged 18 
to 25 years) were to receive 1 IM dose of MenACWY once. 
After completing all prerequisite procedures prior to the first vaccination, subjects were allocated a 
study group and treatment number and blood samples were drawn. At Visit 1 (Day 1), subjects 
received their first dose of study vaccine(s). 
The subjects were observed closely for at least 30 minutes following the administration of the 
vaccine(s), with appropriate medical treatment readily available in case of anaphylaxis. Solicited 
adverse events (AEs) were recorded during this 30-minute period. The subjects/parent(s) or legally 
acceptable representative (LAR) were given a diary card and were trained on how to self-measure local 
solicited AEs and body temperature. 
The second dose of study vaccine(s) was administered at Visit 3 (Day 61), with the exception of the 
MenACWY group who only received a single dose at Visit 1. 
To test for immune response within the serogroups, blood samples were collected at Visit 1 (Day 1), 
Visit 2 (Day 31), and Visit 4 (Day 91), with the exception of the MenACWY group who only had blood 
drawn at Visit 1 and Visit 2. 
Paper diary (pDiary, referred to as Subject Diary hereafter) reminder calls to the subject/subject’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s) about completion of the Subject Diary were performed 3 and 5 days (±1 day) after 
each vaccination (i.e., Day 4 and Day 6 after the first vaccination and accordingly after the second 
vaccination). Safety follow-up calls were made to the subject by a healthcare professional to collect 
relevant safety information on Day 15 and Day 75. 
Test vaccine, dose, mode of administration and lot number: All vaccines used were developed 
and manufactured by GSK. The study vaccines specific to this study were: 
•  MenABCWY obtained by extemporaneous mixing of lyophilized MenACWY powder in a vial with 
rMenB+OMV NZ supplied in a prefilled syringe 
• 
rMenB+OMV NZ as suspension for injection in a prefilled syringe 
EMA/225105/2020  
Page 5/16 
 
  
 
 
•  MenACWY conjugate vaccine obtained by extemporaneous mixing of the lyophilized MenA powder 
component in a vial with the MenCWY liquid components. 
The lot numbers used were DSR0141992 and DSR0141993. 
Duration of study: For each subject (except for subjects randomized to the MenACWY study group), 
the duration of study was approximately 3 months, with vaccination at Day 1 and Day 61 followed by a 
30-day follow-up period. For subjects randomized to the MenACWY study group, the duration of study 
was approximately 2 months; with vaccination at Day 1 followed by a 30-day follow-up period.

•  30 days (including the day of vaccination) after each vaccination (Day 1 to Day 31 and Day 61 
to Day 91 [Day 1 to Day 31 only for subjects in the MenACWY group]) 
•  Serious adverse events (SAEs), medically attended AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, and 
adverse events of special interest (AESIs), in all study groups from informed consent signature 
to Visit 4 (Day 91) 
Statistical Methods 
Primary immunogenicity endpoints (1 month after the last dose) 
•  hSBA geometric mean titer: As titer results were not normally distributed, summary statistics 
were calculated using log-transformed titer results. The anti-logarithm of the summary statistics 
was presented. Unadjusted summaries included the number of subjects with non-missing titer 
results, GMT, geometric standard deviation (GSD), 80% confidence interval (CI) for GMT, 
minimum, and maximum. Adjusted summaries were calculated at baseline using an analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) model (which included study group and center as fixed effects), and at Analysis 
Visit (AVISIT) 4 (1 month after last dose) using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model 
(which included study group, center, and strain [only the ANCOVA model fitted to pooled 
serogroup B test strains] as fixed effects, and baseline log-transformed titer with centering at 
zero as continuous covariate). Both the ANOVA and ANCOVA models were fitted to individual 
serogroups A, C, W-135, Y and the individual serogroup B test strains, as well to the pooled 
serogroup B test strains only. The adjusted GMT, standard error (SE), and 80% CI from the 
ANOVA and ANCOVA models were presented. 
•  hSBA geometric mean ratios: The GMR was summarized by study group atAVISIT 4 for each 
serogroup (A, C, W-135, Y) and the 4 individual serogroup B test strains. Unadjusted summaries 
included the number of subjects with non-missing titer results at AVISIT 4, GMR (at AVISIT 4 
only), GSD of the difference in log- transformed titer results at AVISIT 4 and baseline, 80% CI for 
GMR, minimum, and maximum. Adjusted summaries at baseline were calculated using an ANOVA 
model, and at AVISIT 4 using an ANCOVA model. The adjusted GMT, SE, and 80% CI from the 
ANOVA and ANCOVA models were presented. Ratio was calculated by dividing antibody titer from 
AVISIT4 (1 month after last dose) with baseline antibody titer. 
•  Percentage of subjects with titers above LLOQ and percentage of subjects with a 4-fold increase in 
hSBA titer: The percentage of subjects with titers above the LLOQ and percentage of subjects 
with a 4-fold increase in hSBA titer along with the associated 2-sided 80% Clopper-Pearson CIs 
were computed by study group at baseline and AVISIT 4. In addition, differences in percentages 
of subjects with titers above the LLOQ and percentage of subjects with a 4-fold increase in hSBA 
titer and their 2-sided 80% CIs between selected study groups were calculated using the method 
of Miettinen and Nurminen. 
Secondary immunogenicity endpoints (1 month after the last dose): The analyses described above for 
the respective primary endpoints was repeated using AVISIT 2 (1 months from primary dose) instead 
of AVISIT 4. The MenACWY study group was not included in the secondary analyses as subjects in the 
MenACWY group received single dose of vaccine and analyzed as primary immunogenicity endpoints. 
Safety: All safety analyses were run descriptively.

A total of 14 (14.0%), 17 (16.3%), 14 (14.0%), 13 (13.8%), and 6 (5.9%) subjects had at least one 
unsolicited medically attended AEs in rMenBOMV+ACWY_S, rMenBOMV+ACWY_D, rMenBOMV, and 
MenACWY study groups, respectively. 
No deaths were reported in this study. A total of 2 (1.9%), 1 (1.0%), and 2 (2.1%) subjects had at 
least one SAEs post-vaccination at any visit in the rMenBOMV+ACWY_S (concussion in both the 
subjects considered not related to study vaccines), rMenBOMV+ACWY_D (tibia fracture considered not 
related to study vaccines), and rMenBOMV study groups (lower limb fracture in 1 subject considered 
not related to study vaccines and syncope in 1 subject considered related to study vaccines), 
respectively. 
No subjects were withdrawn from the study or study vaccine due to AEs. None of the subjects reported 
an AESI (arthritis) in the study. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The purpose  of the current study was to evaluate whether there is a potential  immune interference 
(possible lymph nodes  stress) when new investigational vaccine MenABCWY  (the combination 
vaccine consisting of MenACWY  ( Menveo)   lyophilized component and rMenB+OMV  NZ (Bexsero) 
liquid component) is administered  to healthy  adolescents  and adults following a 2-dose vaccination 
schedule with doses administered  2 months  apart. Bexsero and Menveo were used as comparators in 
this study.

The results showed that the highest antibody response against MenB serotypes was archived when 
rMenB+OMV NZ (Bexsero) was administered alone. Also, if Bexsero and Menveo were administered at 
the same time, but on different arms, the antibody levels against MenB was comparable as if Bexsero 
was administered alone.  
The safety data did not add any new information about Bexsero safety profile. Interestingly, fever after 
Bexsero administration was rare (1%) whereas in investigational product it reached to 6 % of 
recipients to report appearance of fever. The study population was relatively small (Subjects at age 
10-17; N= 147) and therefore the chance to detect rare AEs and SAEs is low. No new safety or efficacy 
concern is raised from this study. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The results of this study indicate no new efficacy or safety concern for Bexsero. This P46 procedure is 
considered fulfilled. 
PAM Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The product is Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord, 50 mg/850 mg and 50 mg/1000 mg film-
coated tablets. The application for marketing authorisation is submitted as a generic MA application. 
The reference product is Janumet, film-coated tablet, 50 mg/850 mg and 50 mg/1000 mg marketed by 
Merck Sharp and Dohme B.V., that was first approved in the European Union on 16 July 2008 via the 
centralised procedure (EMEA/H/C/000861). 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord combines two antihyperglycaemic medicinal products with 
complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: 
sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP 4) inhibitor, and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the 
biguanide class. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by 
elevated levels of blood glucose, which prevalence has been increasing steadily all over the world. Type 
Assessment report  
EMA/568807/2022  
Page 9/32 
 
 
 
 
2 diabetes mellitus is due primarily to lifestyle factors and genetics. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is 
characterized by insulin insensitivity as a result of insulin resistance, declining insulin production, and 
eventual pancreatic beta-cell failure. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, the body does not produce enough 
insulin or the cells ignore the insulin. Over time, high blood sugar levels can increase the risk for 
serious complications, including serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves.  
Sitagliptin is an active, potent, and highly selective inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4 
inhibitor) that has been approved for the therapy of type 2 diabetes. Sitagliptin 100 mg daily was well 
tolerated and provided effective and sustained improvement in HbA1c, FPG and PPG levels. Sitagliptin 
prolongs the activity of proteins that increase the release of insulin after blood sugar rises, such as 
after a meal. Sitagliptin metabolizes the naturally occurring incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 
(GLP-1) and glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) resulting in enhanced glucose-
dependent insulin secretion from the pancreas and decreased hepatic glucose production.  
Metformin is the most commonly prescribed therapy for patients with T2DM. It has a good safety 
profile and high efficiency in reducing fasting and postprandial blood glucose and lowering glycosylated 
haemoglobin in patients. The hypoglycaemic effect of metformin is closely related to its capabilities in 
suppression of hepatic glucose production and intestinal glucose absorption, and promotion of β-cell 
functions and insulin sensitivity. Metformin increases insulin release and cell viability at the presence of 
glucose or free fatty acids. In addition, it also decreases lipogenesis in the liver, muscles, and fat, 
inhibits lipolysis in fat and increases glucose utilization and GLP-1 secretion. 
The dose of antihyperglycaemic therapy with sitagliptin/metformin hydrochloride should be 
individualised on the basis of the patient’s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability while not 
exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 100 mg sitagliptin. Sitagliptin/metformin is given 
twice daily with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal adverse reactions associated with metformin. 
The indications applied for Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord are the same as those for the 
reference product Janumet:  
For adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: 
It is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients 
inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin alone or those already 
being treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin. 
It is indicated in combination with a sulphonylurea (i.e., triple combination therapy) as an 
adjunct to diet and exercise in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose 
of metformin and a sulphonylurea. 
It is indicated as triple combination therapy with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
gamma (PPARγ) agonist (i.e., a thiazolidinedione) as an adjunct to diet and exercise in patients 
inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a PPARγ agonist. 
It is also indicated as add-on to insulin (i.e., triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet 
and exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients when stable dose of insulin and metformin 
alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.

2.2.2.  Active substance - Sitagliptin Hydrochloride Monohydrate 
2.2.2.1.  General Information 
The chemical name of sitagliptin hydrochloride monohydrate is (3R)-3-amino-1-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-
5,6-dihydro[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-α]pyrazin-7(8H)-yl]-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butan-1-one hydrochloride 
monohydrate corresponding to the molecular formula C16H18ClF6N5O2. It has a relative molecular mass 
of 461.8 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of sitagliptin hydrochloride monohydrate was confirmed by a combination of 
elemental analyses, UV spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and mass 
spectrometry. The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by XRD. 
Sitagliptin hydrochloride monohydrate is a white to almost-white powder, slightly hygroscopic and freely 
soluble in aqueous media across the physiological pH range. 
Sitagliptin hydrochloride monohydrate exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral center 
which is introduced selectively in the synthetic process. The (R)-enantiomer of the active substance is 
synthesised.  Enantiopurity  is  routinely  controlled  by  a  chiral  HPLC  method  in  the  active  substance 
specification.  
It has been demonstrated through XRD analysis, that the manufacturing process consistently produces 
the same crystal structure and polymorphic form, and the polymorphic form is stable during storage. 
2.2.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured by one manufacturing site. 
Assessment report  
EMA/568807/2022  
Page 11/32 
 
 
 
 
 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance sitagliptin hydrochloride 
monohydrate has been provided in the restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.  
Sitagliptin hydrochloride monohydrate is synthesized in 8-10 main steps (depending on the 
intermediate manufacturer) using three well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The characterisation 
of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new 
active substances. During the procedure, a major objection was raised on the restricted part of the 
ASMF in relation to impurity control in one of the starting materials which was addressed in a 
satisfactory way by the ASMF Holder. A further major objection was raised on the applicant’s part of 
the ASMF due to the detection of an unexpected impurity in active substance from one intermediate 
manufacturing site. Further work revealed that with the GC method used, the unexpected impurity co-
eluded with another impurity which is routinely controlled in the active substance specification. An 
optimised method was developed, in which the two peaks elude separately. Active substance samples 
were tested with the improved method and the unexpected impurity was not detected. The tested 
batches included samples of active substance manufactured with intermediate from the two different 
intermediate manufacturers, respectively. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in a transparent low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bag with strip seal 
and then in another transparent LDPE bag with strip seal followed by a triple laminated sunlight barrier 
bag (TLSB) with heat seal. These bags are further packed in HDPE containers. The primary packaging 
material complies with the EC directive EC 10/2011 as amended and with monograph Ph. Eur 3.1.3. for 
polyolefins. 
2.2.2.3.  Specification 
The active substance specification used by finished product manufacturer includes tests for: description 
(visual), solubility (Ph. Eur.), identity (IR, enantiomeric purity and test for chloride), hydrochloric acid 
content (potentiometry), water content (KF), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur), related substances (HPLC), 
enantiomeric purity (HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), benzene content (GC), polymorphic 
form (PXRD) and particle size (laser diffraction). 
The specification is identical to the specification used by the active substance manufacturer and in line 
with the Ph. Eur. Monograph for sitagliptin phosphate, where applicable, with the additional test for 
particle size, polymorphic form and residual solvents. 
Limits for impurities have been set in line with ICH Q3A. The analytical methods used have been 
adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 3 production scale batches of the active substance were provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
2.2.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data from three production-scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 
60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
Assessment report  
EMA/568807/2022  
Page 12/32 
 
 
 
guidelines were provided. Samples were tested for description, identification, water content, related 
substances, enantiomeric purity, assay and polymorph. The analytical methods used were the same as 
for release and are stability indicating. No significant changes to any of the measured parameters were 
observed and all parameters remained within specifications. 
The active substance was also exposed to stressed conditions. The active substance is sensitive to 
degradation under acidic, basic and oxidative conditions. No changes were observed under thermal 
stress and high humidity. In photostability studies, degradation was observed in solution but not in the 
solid state.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months in the proposed 
container and at temperatures not exceeding 25°C (excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C). 
The packaging protects the active substance from light during storage. 
2.2.3.  Active substance - Metformin Hydrochloride 
2.2.3.1.  General Information 
The chemical name of metformin hydrochloride is 1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride corresponding to 
the molecular formula C4H12ClN5. It has a molecular mass of 165.6 and the following structure: 
Figure 2: active substance structure

(HPLC) and assay (titrimetry). Additional tests are carried out by the finished product manufacturer for 
residual solvents (GC) and particle size (laser diffraction). 
The analytical tests carried out comply with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. Eur. 
monograph.  
Additional specifications have been set for residual solvents and particle size. Non-compendial methods 
have been adequately validated and described according to ICH Q2. Limits for particle size were set in 
line with batches used to manufacture finished product for the bioequivalence studies. 
Batch analysis data from 3 production scale batches of the active substance were provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
2.2.3.4.  Stability 
No re-test period is stated on the CEP and therefore results of stability studies in support of the retest 
period have been provided. 
Stability data from 16 batches of active substance (out of which 12 were production-scale batches) 
from the proposed manufacturer stored in the intended commercial packaging for up to 60 months 
under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Samples were tested for description, 
identity, appearance of solution, loss on drying, related substances and assay. The analytical methods 
used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. No significant changes to any of the 
measured parameters were observed and all remained within specifications under long term and 
accelerated conditions. 
The active substance was also exposed to stressed conditions. The active substance is sensitive to 
degradation under basic and oxidative conditions and minor changes were seen under acetic 
conditions. No changes were observed under thermal stress and high humidity. In photostability 
studies, degradation was observed in solution but not in the solid state.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months (as assigned by 
the finished product manufacturer) when stored at ambient temperature in the proposed, well-closed 
container. 
2.2.4.  Finished medicinal product 
2.2.4.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing sitagliptin hydrochloride 
monohydrate and metformin hydrochloride as active substances in a fixed dose combination. Two 
strengths are proposed to be authorised: 
•  50 mg / 850 mg: pink coloured, capsule shaped, film-coated tablet debossed, with ‘SM2’ on 
one side and plain on other side. Length: 20.10 to 20.40 mm and Width: 9.80 to 10.10 mm. 
•  50 mg / 1000 mg: red coloured, capsule shaped, film-coated tablet debossed with ‘SM3’ on 
one side and plain on other side. Length: 21.30 to 21.60 mm and Width: 10.40 to 10.70 mm. 
The two strengths can be sufficiently differentiated by colour and debossing.  
Assessment report  
EMA/568807/2022  
Page 14/32 
 
 
 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a generic product that is essentially similar 
and bioequivalent to the reference product, Janumet. The generic product was developed containing 
the same two strengths as the reference product. Metformin hydrochloride is used in both products. 
However, in the generic product, sitagliptin hydrochloride monohydrate is used instead of sitagliptin 
phosphate monohydrate used in the reference product which is acceptable according to Directive 
2001/83/EC. A different salt of an active substance is considered to be the same active substance, if 
does not differ significantly in properties with regard to safety and efficacy (see non-clinical/clinical 
aspects). 
The excipients were selected based on the excipients used in the reference product with certain 
differences. Calcium hydrogen phosphate, croscarmellose sodium and magnesium stearate are used 
for the generic but are not used in the reference product. Sodium stearyl fumarate is used in the 
reference product, but not in the generic. For the film-coat, the same individual components are used 
except for iron oxide black which is used for the 50 mg/ 850 mg reference product, but not included in 
the Opadry selected for the generic. 
Compatibility of each excipient with both active substances was overall sufficiently demonstrated under 
accelerated conditions (40oC, 75% RH). All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and 
their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished 
product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
For metformin hydrochloride, two polymorphic forms are known and for sitagliptin hydrochloride 
monohydrate one singular crystalline form. XRPD analysis was used to study if any changes in 
polymorphic form occur during tablet manufacturing and/or storage. No change in polymorphic form 
was observed and the data presented was considered satisfactory. 
The quality target product profile (QTTP) was derived from chemical and physical properties of the two 
active substances, from the characteristics of the reference product and the reference product label 
and from the intended patient population.  
Critical quality attributes (CQAs) were identified, and assay, uniformity of dosage units, dissolution and 
related substances are identified as the subset of CQAs that have the potential to be impacted by 
formulation and/or process variables. Risk assessment was used throughout development to identify 
potentially high-risk formulation and process variables and to determine which studies were necessary 
to achieve product and process understanding in order to develop a control strategy. Each risk 
assessment was then updated after development to capture the reduced level of risk based on 
improved product and process understanding. 
Design of experiments was used in formulation development studies. The two tablet strengths are not 
dose proportional. The dose of sitagliptin remains quantitatively the same while the portion of 
metformin varies across the two strengths.  
The development of the dissolution method is described in sufficient detail and the selected method 
was appropriately justified. The discriminatory power of the dissolution method was investigated. 
Sufficient information on the discriminatory power of the dissolution method was provided considering 
also that the tablets are for immediate release and the active substances are freely soluble. 
Bioequivalence with the reference product was demonstrated in two studies (see clinical aspects). In 
addition, comparative in vitro dissolution studies were conducted. Dissolution profiles were very similar 
for the generic and the reference product. 
A risk assessment of the overall finished product manufacturing process was performed to identify the 
high risk steps that may affect the CQAs of the final finished product. A risk assessment was conducted 
to identify potentially high risk process variables which could impact the finished product CQAs. This 
Assessment report  
EMA/568807/2022  
Page 15/32 
 
 
 
method of identifying process variables for further study was applied in each process step risk 
assessment. Previous experience with these process steps was used to determine the degree of risk 
associated with each process step and its potential to impact the CQAs of the finished product. Further 
risk assessment was performed subsequently on each high and/or medium risk process step to identify 
which process variables may potentially impact the intermediate CQAs. Evaluation of all possible 
process variables that could potentially impact the quality attributes of the output material of any 
given process step was not feasible therefore; some of the variables were set constant based on 
proven acceptable ranges of development and current understanding. Following the experiments 
conducted roller pressure and fluid intake may impact the tablet dissolution, under or over-blending 
may impact tablets assay and uniformity of dosage units, turret speed, hardness (compression force) 
and compression run time were identified as critical process parameters and as scale dependent 
parameters. Therefore, these parameters will be evaluated during scale up batch execution. 
The primary packaging is PVC/PE/PVDC-aluminium blisters or Alu-Alu blisters. The material complies 
with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
2.2.4.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by one manufacturing site.  
The manufacturing process, along with in-process tests, consists of six main steps: 1) intra-granular 
stage, 2) extra granular stage, 3) sifting and blending, 4) compression, 5) coating, and 6) packaging. 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  for  3  batches of  each  strength.  It  has 
been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of 
intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
2.2.4.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form including description (visual), identification (HPLC, HPLC by PDA, titanium dioxide, iron dioxide), 
dissolution  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (HPLC),  water  content  (KF),  related 
substances (HPLC), N-nitroso dimethylamine (NDMA, GC-MS/MS) and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
Related substances are limited in line with ICH Q3B. 
Following the first round of assessment, a question was raised in relation to the proposed limits for 
total impurities, both at release and at shelf life. Limits were considered too wide for total impurities 
related to sitagliptin, for total impurities related to metformin hydrochloride and also for the total of 
both. The CHMP requested to tighten the limits in line with process capabilities, product behaviour and 
batch data at release and from stability studies. Reference was also made to the limit for total 
impurities in the Ph. Eur. Monograph for sitagliptin phosphate. Following the responses received, the 
issue was upgraded to a Major Objection. Following that, the applicant provided satisfactory responses 
to resolve the Major Objection and relevant limits were tightened to acceptable limits.  
Following the first round of assessment, a question was also raised on the proposed assay limits for 
sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride and the proposed widening of limits at shelf life. Following the 
responses received, the issue was upgraded to a Major Objection in the List of Outstanding issues as 
the provided data was insufficient to justify the proposed limits at release and the widening of limits 
Assessment report  
EMA/568807/2022  
Page 16/32 
 
 
 
proposed for the shelf-life specification. The applicant then provided satisfactory responses to resolve 
the Major Objection.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product was assessed following a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data from 
3 batches of each strength using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each 
relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk 
assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any 
elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. 
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
was performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). The finished 
product contains metformin which contains dimethyl amine as an impurity and is known to be 
susceptible to formation of NDMA during formulation. NDMA is routinely controlled in the finished 
product. Numerous batches of both strengths were tested when packaged in the proposed primary 
container and in all instances the results were below the limit of quantification (0.01 ppm). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 production scale batches of each strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
2.2.4.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 production-scale batches of finished product of each strength stored for up to 18 
months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), 12 months at intermediate conditions (30°C / 
75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The batches are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed 
in both of the primary packaging proposed for marketing, respectively. 
Samples  were  tested  for  description,  water  content,  dissolution,  assay,  related  substances  and 
microbiological  quality.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are  stability  indicating.  Under  long-term 
conditions,  no  significant  changes  were  observed  for  either  strength  and  for  either  packaging.  Under 
accelerated  conditions,  no  significant  changes  were  observed  for  either  strength  packaged  in  Alu/Alu 
blisters.  In  the  PVC/PE/PVDC  blister  packaging,  an  increase  of  sitagliptin-related  impurities  was 
observed, but results remained within the specification limits.  
In addition, samples were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. In solution, degradation is seen for both APIs, but no changes were 
observed for the tablet (solid), including under directly exposed conditions. 
Forced degradation studies were also conducted. It was observed, that sitagliptin is sensitive to oxidative, 
acidic, and basic conditions. Metformin is sensitive to oxidative and basic conditions, while only minor 
Assessment report  
EMA/568807/2022  
Page 17/32 
 
 
 
changes were seen under acetic conditions. Under thermal stress and high humidity, no changes were 
seen for both sitagliptin and metformin. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years and the storage condition ‘Store 
below 30°C’ as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
2.2.4.5.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.5.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. Regarding the active substance, a Major Objection was raised 
during the procedure in relation to control of impurities in one of the starting materials used to 
manufacture the active substance. A further Major Objection was raised due to the detection of an 
unexpected impurity in active substance from one intermediate manufacturing site. Satisfactory 
responses were received during the procedure to address and resolve both these Major Objections. 
Two questions related to the proposed limits for total impurities and assay in the finished product 
specifications were upgraded to Major Objections during the procedure, but additional responses 
received were satisfactory to resolve both Major Objections. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.7.  Recommendation for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicological  properties  of  sitagliptin  and  metformin  are  well 
known. As sitagliptin and metformin are widely used, well-known active substances, the applicant has 
not provided additional studies and further studies are not required. Overview based on literature review 
is, thus, appropriate. 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which 
is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
Assessment report

Page 18/32 
 
 
 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
A  summary  of  the  literature  with  regards  to  non-clinical  data  of  sitagliptin  and  justifications  that  the 
different salt of the active substance sitagliptin does not differ significantly in properties with regards to 
safety  and  efficacy  of  the  reference  product  was  provided  and  was  accepted  by  the  CHMP.  This  is  in 
accordance with the relevant guideline and additional non-clinical studies were not considered necessary. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord manufactured by Accord Healthcare S.L.U. is 
considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all sitagliptin 
and metformin hydrochloride containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active 
substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview is adequate. The non-clinical sections of the SmPC are in line with the 
reference text, Janumet film-coated tablets, Merck Sharp & Dohme B.V., CP product, 
EMEA/H/C/000861. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride 
Accord and justifications that the different salt of the active substance does not differ significantly in 
properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the reference product was provided and was accepted 
by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional non-clinical studies were 
not considered necessary. 
There  are  no  objections  to  approval  of  Sitagliptin/Metformin  hydrochloride  Accord  from  a  non-clinical 
point of view. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for film coated tablets containing sitagliptin/metformin hydrochloride. To support 
the marketing authorisation application the applicant conducted two bioequivalence study with [cross-
over / parallel] design under fed conditions.  
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical 
assessment Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1 in its 
current version is of particular relevance as well as the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation 
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09.  
The clinical overview on the clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety has been provided and is 
adequate.

36 healthy adult male subjects (20-42 years old, BMI 18.6 - 29.9 kg/m2) of Asian race were enrolled 
and randomized. Five (05) subjects (no. 04, 13, 18, 22 and 25) dropped out. 31 subjects completed 
both periods and were included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. 
•  Analytical methods 
The  method  validation  reports  (MV0400,  Version  00,  dated  21/10/2019,  Addendum-I  signed  on 
22/10/2019, Addendum-II signed on 27/11/2019, Addendum-III signed on 04/08/2020 and Addendum-
IV signed on 28/10/2020) have been provided for the method of sitagliptin and metformin. 
A validated LC-MS/MS method by solid-phase extraction was used to determine sitagliptin and metformin 
concentrations in K2EDTA human plasma. The internal standards were sitagliptin-D4 hydrochloride and 
metformin-D6 HCl. Certificates of analysis are provided for the analytes and the internal standards.  
The calibration curve range and quality control concentrations during study sample analysis were: 
Sitagliptin: 
Calibration range: 3.0204-1501.2 ng/ml 
QC  concentrations  (ng/ml):  8.7258  (LQC),  93.826  (AQC-II),  187.65  (AQC-I),  525.63  (MQC)  and 
1140.2 (HQC). 
Metformin: 
Calibration range: 10.063-5001.3 ng/mL 
QC  concentrations  (ng/ml):  29.079  (LQC),  312.68  (AQC-II),  625.36  (AQC-I),  1751.7  (MQC)  and 
3799.8 (HQC).

A total of 1733 samples were analysed. A total of 02 samples (0.12%) were reanalysed for sitagliptin 
due to incomplete analysis, inconsistent internal standard response and poor chromatography and a total 
of 01 sample (0.06%) was reanalysed for metformin due to incomplete analysis. 
For incurred sample reanalysis 140 samples were run for sitagliptin and 140 samples for metformin. A 
total of 100% of samples were found to be within a variation of 20% from the mean value for sitagliptin 
and 99.3% for metformin. Long term stability of the analytes in matrix at -70±15°C and -20±10°C was 
proven for a period that spanned the time from first study sample collection to completion of ISR analysis.   
•  Pharmacokinetic variables 
The  primary  pharmacokinetic  parameters  for  this  study  were  AUC0-t  and  Cmax,  and  the  secondary 
pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  AUC0-∞,  AUC0-t/AUC0-∞,  Residual  area,  Tmax,  T1/2  and  Kel  for  both 
sitagliptin and metformin, respectively.  
The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using standard methods and a non-compartmental 
approach. Actual sampling times were used for calculation of the PK parameters, except for pre-dose 
samples. The PK analysis software used was Phoenix WinNonlin Software Version 8.3. 
•  Statistical methods 
PROC  GLM  of  SAS  Studio  3.6  (Basic  Edition)  (SAS  Institute  Inc.,  USA)  was  employed  for  statistical 
analysis.  ANOVA  was  performed  on  ln  transformed  pharmacokinetic  parameters  for  Cmax,  AUC0-t  and 
AUC0-∞.  
The model included group, sequence, sequence*group, period (group), treatment, treatment*group and 
subject (sequence*group) as fixed effects. The ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax and 
AUC0-t) of Sitagliptin and Metformin were analyzed using an ANOVA model at alpha 0.05. 
Bioequivalence criteria: 
90%  confidence  interval  for  the  difference  of  the  least-square  means  of  the  logarithmic  transformed 
values of Cmax and AUCt at 5% level of significance should be between 80.00% and 125.00% to meet 
bioequivalence criteria for Sitagliptin and Metformin.

01-2021  
Netherlands 
36 healthy adult male subjects (19-43 years old, BMI 19.1 - 28.4 kg/m2) of Asian race were enrolled 
and randomized. Five (05) subjects (no. 13, 19, 20, 24 and 36) dropped out (see details below). 31 
subjects completed both periods and were included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis.  
•  Analytical methods 
The method validation reports (MV0400, Version 00, dated 21/10/2019, Addendum-I signed on 
22/10/2019, Addendum-II signed on 27/11/2019, Addendum-III signed on 04/08/2020 and 
Addendum-IV signed on 28/10/2020) have been provided for the method of sitagliptin and metformin. 
A validated LC-MS/MS method by solid-phase extraction was used to determine sitagliptin and 
metformin concentrations in K2EDTA human plasma. The internal standards were Sitagliptin-D4 
hydrochloride and Metformin-D6 HCl. Certificates of analysis are provided for the analytes and the 
internal standards.  
The calibration curve range and quality control concentrations during study sample analysis were: 
Sitagliptin: 
Calibration range: 3.0204-1501.2 ng/ml 
QC concentrations (ng/ml): 8.7258 (LQC), 93.826 (AQC-II), 187.65 (AQC-I), 525.63 (MQC) and 
1140.2 (HQC). 
Metformin: 
Calibration range: 10.063-5001.3 ng/mL 
QC concentrations (ng/ml): 29.079 (LQC), 312.68 (AQC-II), 625.36 (AQC-I), 1751.7 (MQC) and 
3799.8 (HQC). 
Accuracy and precision of QC samples obtained during analysis of subject samples is shown below: 
Sitagliptin 
Inter-run precision: 1.9 – 4.7% 
Inter-run accuracy:  97.4 – 100.3% 
Metformin 
Inter-run precision: 1.8 – 7.1% 
Inter-run accuracy:  98.5 – 100.8% 
A total of 1735 samples were analysed. A total of 02 samples (0.12%) were reanalysed for sitagliptin 
due to inconsistent internal standard response and poor chromatography and a total of 01 sample 
(0.06%) was reanalysed for metformin due to inconsistent internal standard response. 
Assessment report  
EMA/568807/2022  
Page 25/32 
 
 
 
 
For incurred sample reanalysis 140 samples were run for sitagliptin and 140 samples for metformin. A 
total of 98.6% of samples were found to be within a variation of 20% from the mean value for 
sitagliptin and 100% for metformin. The maximum study sample storage period from the first blood 
draw (23/09/2020) to last sample analysis (20/10/2020) is 28 days, which is covered by the validated 
long-term stability. 
•  Pharmacokinetic variables 
The primary pharmacokinetic parameters for this study were AUC0-t and Cmax, and the secondary 
pharmacokinetic parameters were AUC0-∞, AUC0-t/AUC0-∞, Residual area, Tmax, T1/2 and Kel for both 
sitagliptin and metformin, respectively.  
The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using standard methods and a non-compartmental 
approach. Actual sampling times were used for calculation of the PK parameters, except for pre-dose 
samples. The PK analysis software used was Phoenix WinNonlin Software Version 8.3. 
•  Statistical methods 
PROC GLM of SAS Studio 3.6 (Basic Edition) (SAS Institute Inc., USA) was employed for statistical 
analysis. ANOVA was performed on ln transformed pharmacokinetic parameters for Cmax, AUC0-t and 
AUC0-∞.  
The ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax and AUC0-t) of Sitagliptin and Metformin were 
analyzed using an ANOVA model at alpha 0.05. The model included sequence, treatment, period and 
subject (sequence) as fixed effects. The significance of the sequence effect at alpha 0.10 was 
calculated using the subject nested within the sequence as the error term.  
Bioequivalence criteria: 
90% confidence interval for the difference of the least-square means of the logarithmic transformed 
values of Cmax and AUCt at 5% level of significance should be between 80.00% and 125.00% to meet 
bioequivalence criteria for Sitagliptin and Metformin.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of sitagliptin hydrochloride monohydrate and metformin 
hydrochloride film coated tablets. The reference product Janumet is indicated in the treatment of type 
2 diabetes mellitus, for adult patients: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients inadequately 
controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin alone or those already being treated 
with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin. 
in combination with a sulphonylurea (i.e., triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and 
exercise in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin and 
a sulphonylurea. 
as triple combination therapy with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 
(PPARγ) agonist (i.e., a thiazolidinedione) as an adjunct to diet and exercise in patients 
inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a PPARγ agonist. 
as add-on to insulin (i.e., triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and exercise to 
improve glycaemic control in patients when stable dose of insulin and metformin alone do not 
provide adequate glycaemic control. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient. 
Two bioequivalence studies, one for each strength of the applied sitagliptin/metformin fixed dose 
combination product (50mg/850 mg and 50mg/1000mg), form the pivotal basis with a standardized, 
randomized, 2-way, cross-over design. Both studies were conducted under fed state in line with the 
Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence. The study design was considered adequate to 
evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European 
requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were 
adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were 
adequate. 
The test formulation of Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord met the protocol-defined criteria for 
bioequivalence when compared with the reference product Janumet. The point estimates and their 
90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the 
protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was 
demonstrated. 
This application contains a different salt of the active substance sitagliptin (hydrochloride monohydrate 
vs phosphate monohydrate). A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical and clinical data of 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord and justifications that the different salt of sitagliptin does 
not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the reference product was 
provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and 
additional non-clinical/clinical studies were not considered necessary. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information.  
Assessment report  
EMA/568807/2022  
Page 30/32 
 
 
 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord is favourable in the 
following indication: 
For adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: 
It is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients 
inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin alone or those already 
being treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin. 
It is indicated in combination with a sulphonylurea (i.e., triple combination therapy) as an 
adjunct to diet and exercise in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose 
of metformin and a sulphonylurea. 
It is indicated as triple combination therapy with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
gamma (PPARγ) agonist (i.e., a thiazolidinedione) as an adjunct to diet and exercise in patients 
inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a PPARγ agonist. 
It is also indicated as add-on to insulin (i.e., triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet 
and exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients when stable dose of insulin and 
metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Carfilzomib is a tetrapeptide epoxyketone proteasome inhibitor that selectively and irreversibly binds to 
the N terminal threonine containing active sites of the 20S proteasome, the proteolytic core particle 
within the 26S proteasome, and displays little to no activity against other protease classes. Carfilzomib 
had antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities in preclinical models in haematologic tumours. In 
animals, carfilzomib inhibited proteasome activity in blood and tissue and delayed tumour growth in 
models of multiple myeloma. In vitro, carfilzomib was found to have minimal neurotoxicity and minimal 
reaction to non proteasomal proteases (SmPC section 5.1). 
The current indication for Kyprolis is as follows: 
Kyprolis in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy (see section 5.1). 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) applied for the following indication:  
Kyprolis in combination with either lenalidomide and dexamethasone or dexamethasone alone is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior 
therapy (see section 5.1). 
When combined with dexamethasone, Kyprolis is administered intravenously as a 30 minute infusion on 
two consecutive days, each week for three weeks (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16) followed by a 12-day rest 
period (days 17 to 28).  Each 28-day period is considered one treatment cycle. 
Kyprolis is administered at a starting dose of 20 mg/m2 (maximum dose 44 mg) in cycle 1 on days 1 and 
2.  If tolerated, the dose should be increased on day 8 of cycle 1 to 56  mg/m2 (maximum dose 123 mg) 
(SmPC section 4.2). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Kyprolis (carfilzomib) is currently approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma 
in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. In the approved SmPC, when combined with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone Kyprolis is administered at a starting dose of 20 mg/m2 (maximum 
dose is 44 mg) in cycle 1 on days 1 and 2. If tolerated, the dose should be increased on day 8 of cycle 1 
to 27 mg/m2 (maximum dose 60 mg). From cycle 13, the day 8 and 9 doses of Kyprolis are omitted. 
The present Variation has been submitted to propose an update to the therapeutic indication in the SmPC 
for Kyprolis to account for efficacy data from the Phase 3 clinical study 2011-003 (also known as 
ENDEAVOR).  
Based on the posology in the ENDEAVOR study, when combined with dexamethasone, Kyprolis is 
administered at a starting dose of 20 mg/m2 (maximum dose is 44 mg) in cycle 1 on days 1 and 2. If 
tolerated, the dose should be increased on day 8 of cycle 1 to 56 mg/m2 (maximum dose 123 mg).  
As a result of the increased maximum dose, the applicant has submitted an updated Environmental Risk 
Assessment (ERA) with this submission.

2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  MAH  has  provided  an  updated  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  (ERA)  in  accordance  with  EMA 
recommendations, the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of medicinal products for human 
use  (EMA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00,  2006)  and  the  Questions  and  Answers  document  on  the  Guideline 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010). 
Phase I ERA: Estimation of exposure 
•  Screening for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) 
As part of the screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity, the Applicant provided log10POW 
(4.6). The octanol-water partition coefficient (POW) has been estimated at pH 4, 7 and 9 and 20 ºC using 
“Shake Flask Method” according to the OECD 107. 
Data from this study is provided in Table 1 below. 
Table 1. Data from OECD Study to Assess the Octanol/Water Partition Coefficient of carfilzomib 
As  the  log10Pow  value  is  >  4.5  at  pH  7,  there  is  requirement  to  screen  carfilzomib  for  persistence, 
bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT). 
According to the EU TGD (ECHA 2014), the PBT/vPvB assessment is required since the estimated log KOW 
value is clearly above the cut-off of 4.5. 
Based  on  the  log10Pow  (Log  Kow)  at  pH  7  of  4.6  the  applicant  has  initiated  the  first  step  of  a  PBT 
assessment  in  the  form  of  an  OECD  308  (Aerobic  and  Anaerobic  Transformation  in  Aquatic  Sediment 
Systems) study in two aerobic sediments. 
A specific PBT assessment according to the REACH Annex III is ongoing. Therefore, the applicant was 
recommended to submit the missing data as soon as their results will be available and an update of the 
ERA accordingly. The applicant has agreed to submit the results of the OECD 308 (Aerobic and Anaerobic 
Transformation in Aquatic Sediment Systems) study and an updated ERA by April 2017.  
•  Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) 
The  applicant  calculated  a  refined  PECsurfacewater  in  compliance  with  the  guideline  on  the  ERA  for 
carfilzomib. As the action limit of 0.01 μg/L is not exceeded further risk assessment in Phase II of the 
procedure is not required. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
An Environmental Risk Assessment has been undertaken for carfilzomib in accordance with EMA 
recommendations, the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of medicinal products for human 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/517040/2016

use (EMA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, 2006) and the Questions and Answers document on the Guideline 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010). 
The predicted environmental concentration (PEC), based on the refined Fpen, was calculated and is not 
expected to exceed 0.01 µg/L.  Thus, no further Phase II environmental fate and effect analysis is deemed 
necessary.   
The octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) was estimated using a validated and recognized method 
“Shake Flask Method” according to the OECD 107. The log pow value (4.6) presented by the applicant for 
carfilzomib is above the PBT, vPvB criteria. Therefore, a PBT assessment is required. The applicant is 
performing a specific PBT assessment according to the criteria as laid down in REACH Annex III. The first 
step of a PBT assessment in the form of an OECD 308 in two aerobic sediments is ongoing.  
The applicant has agreed to provide the results of OECD 308 and the updated ERA by April 2017. This is 
considered acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A specific PBT assessment according to the criteria as laid down in REACH Annex III is ongoing.  
The CHMP recommended the submission of the results of OECD 308 and the updated ERA by April 2017.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
An updated clinical pharmacology data package has been submitted to support the marketing application 
of the Phase 3 study 2011-003, studying carfilzomib (Kyprolis) plus dexamethasone [Kd] versus 
bortezomib (Velcade) plus dexamethasone [Vd]. In this trial, carfilzomib 20/56 mg/m2 was administered 
as an IV infusion over 30 minutes in subjects with relapsed multiple myeloma.  
This updated clinical pharmacology data package:  
• Provides results from sparse PK sampling from the Phase 3 study 2011-003  
• Reiterates preliminary PK data to inform dosing recommendations in subjects with baseline 
hepatic impairment as well as subjects with baseline renal impairment from ongoing studies 
CFZ001(TR-1160-171) and CFZ002 (TR-1161-171) (inclusive of most of the planned PK samples) 
evaluating PK of carfilzomib at 27 and 56 mg/m2  
• Summarizes potential effects of additional covariates (relative to the original population PK 
analysis), in particular, the effect of race, country of origin (Japan versus others), baseline 
renal/hepatic impairment, and baseline albumin on the PK of carfilzomib. This updated population 
PK analysis includes data from the above-mentioned studies, CFZ001, CFZ002, and 2011-003  
 • Provides Pharmacodynamics (PDn) results at 20/56 mg/m2 IV infusion over 30 minutes from 
PX-171-007 (DD-0176R-00). In addition, a summary of key PK and PDn data will be presented 
from PX-171-007,  
which will be cross-referenced to the previously submitted PK report 
(TR-0479-171) and PDn report (TR-0478-171)  
• Provides an updated exposure-response analysis with data from 2011-003 (Amgen 
Pharmacometrics Report 121604, see Section 1.3.1; TR-1162-171)  
Absorption 
Impact of Infusion Length on Pharmacokinetics of Carfilzomib  
Pharmacokinetic and PDn effects following a 30-minute IV infusion appear to be similar to those following 
a 2- to 10-minute IV infusion; an exception is a reduced Cmax as a result of the 30-minute IV infusion.

The PK profile of carfilzomib administered as a 30-minute IV infusion was characterized in PX-171-007 
(intensive PK sampling) and 2011-003 (sparse PK sampling).  The data at multiple dose levels in 
PX-171-007 indicated that a longer infusion of 30 minutes resulted in a similar half-life, CL, and AUC, but 
the Cmax level is approximately a 2- to 3-fold reduction relative to a 2- to 10-minute IV infusion.  For 
example, the geometric mean (geometric %CV) of AUC0-inf following 30-minute IV administration of the 
20 mg/m2 dose was 292 (54.5%) ng•hr/mL (see table 2 below), within range of the AUC following the 
2- to 10-minute IV infusion of the same dose of drug (geometric %CV = 223 [104%] ng•hr/mL.

The mean Cmax at the 20 mg/m2 dose (796 ng/mL) was approximately 3-fold lower following the 
30-minute infusion compared to the mean Cmax observed following the 2- to 10-minute IV infusion at 
20 mg/m2 (geometric %CV = 2390 [104%] ng/mL).   
Time to maximum concentration occurred at the end of infusion following both 2- to 10-minute and 
30-minute infusions. Comparable AUC, but lower Cmax, values were also seen with the 30-minute and 
the 2- to 10-minute IV infusions for the 36 mg/m2 dose.  The geometric %CV of AUC0-inf and Cmax 
values following the 30-minute infusions at 36 mg/m2 were 426 (70.1) ng·hr/mL and 
1061 (50.7) ng/mL, respectively compared to 663 (51.4) ng·hr/mL and 5718 (46.5) ng/mL following the 
2- to 10-minute infusions.  Sparse PK data at 56 mg/m2 over the 30-minute infusion from Study 
2011-003 were combined with data from other clinical studies in the population PK analysis.  Despite a 
higher dose, a 56 mg/m2 dose over a 30-minute infusion resulted in a reduced Cmax (2079 ng/mL) 
compared with a 27 mg/m2 dose over a 2- to 10-minute infusion (4232 ng/mL); however, the 
corresponding AUC was double (948 ng∙hr/mL versus 379 ng∙hr/mL.

Distribution 
Similar to those reported following a 2- to 10-minute IV infusion, the mean volume of distribution at 
steady state (Vss) after a 20 mg/m2 dose of a 30-minute IV infusion of carfilzomib was 21.8 L in subjects 
with multiple myeloma (Study PX-171-007).  In an in vitro study, binding of carfilzomib to human plasma 
proteins averaged 97% over the concentration range of 0.4 to 4 µM, and this extent of binding was not 
concentration dependent.  Ex vivo assessment using plasma from subjects with multiple myeloma 
indicated that plasma protein binding of carfilzomib in subjects with mild to severe renal dysfunction was 
similar to those of normal renal function, and ranged from 97.6% to 98.3% (TR-0452-171).   
Metabolism 
Upon administration, carfilzomib was rapidly and extensively metabolized in subjects with multiple 
myeloma and solid tumours. The predominant metabolites measured in human plasma and urine and 
generated in vitro by human hepatocytes were peptide fragments (PR-389/M14, PR-413/M15) and the 
diol of carfilzomib (PR-519/M16), suggesting that peptidase cleavage and epoxide hydrolysis were the 
principal pathways of metabolism.   
Cytochrome P450-mediated mechanisms appear to play a minor role in the overall metabolism of 
carfilzomib. Each of the metabolites (PR-389/M14, PR-413/M15, and PR-519/M16) lacks an epoxyketone 
pharmacophore and has no known biologic activity. In addition, the metabolites in humans are formed in 
preclinical species, and there are no unique or disproportionate metabolites in humans. 
Excretion 
Renal and biliary elimination of unlabelled carfilzomib was evaluated in subjects with multiple myeloma or 
solid tumours in lieu of a radiolabelled mass balance study in healthy volunteers.  The excretion profile of 
carfilzomib and predominant metabolites was assessed by a 24-hour collection of urine and faecal 
samples in PX-171-008 and urine sample collection in PX-171-005. The metabolites of carfilzomib are 
primarily recovered in urine.  Within 24 hours following IV administration of a single 27 mg/m2 dose of 
carfilzomib to subjects with multiple myeloma or solid tumours, approximately 30% of the administered 
dose of carfilzomib was excreted in urine as metabolites PR-389/M14 (~24% to 31%) and PR-413/M15 
(~2%).  Urinary excretion of parent compound was negligible (0.3% of the total dose).  A small amount 
of metabolite PR-389/M14 (0.2%) was recovered in faeces with no detection of carfilzomib and 
metabolites (PR-413/M15 and PR-519/M16) in faecal samples.   
The relatively low recovery observed in urine and faecal samples could be due to the collection time 
limited to 24 hours post-dose and measurements not accounting for minor metabolites. In addition, 
carfilzomib is peptidic in nature and irreversibly binds to its target; thus, drug recovery might be limited 
by target binding in cells that are slow to turn over proteasomes and amino acids (leucine and 
phenylalanine) that may be incorporated into normal biosynthetic pathways. 
Dose proportionality

Page 12/101 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the data collected from PX-171-005 and PX-171-007, the exposure (AUC and Cmax) increased in 
a dose-dependent manner from 15 to 56 mg/m2 when looking at similar infusion durations.  
Dose-proportionality was assessed but was limited by the high variability in PK parameters and small 
sample size.  
Special populations 
The objectives of the carfilzomib population pharmacokinetic analysis are the following: 
• 
• 
• 
To update the existing population PK model to include additional data from three studies: 
2011-003, CFZ001, and CFZ002 
To obtain updated estimates of pharmacokinetic parameters 
To evaluate effects of subjects' demographic characteristics and other covariates on PK 
parameters, in particular, the effect of race, country of origin (Japan versus others), baseline 
renal/hepatic impairment and baseline albumin on PK of carfilzomib 
The previous population PK model (TR-1015-171) identified the structural model of carfilzomib to be a 
2-compartment model with first order elimination (Table 3). This compartmental model structure was 
maintained for the current population PK analysis. 
A slight effect of BSA on clearance was observed. However, PK exposure metrics based on the final model 
found 95% of all subjects taking carfilzomib achieve exposure (Cmax and AUC) within 10% of the 
exposure for a subject with median BSA. The current population PK analysis (Table 4) did not identify any 
other clinically meaningful covariates that impacted the pharmacokinetic profile of carfilzomib. The 
covariates of CrCL, sex, age, weight, race, albumin, renal and liver impairment, Japanese origin, and 
cancer type had no detectable influence on model parameters. Parameters estimates for carfilzomib in 
both final PK models are presented in table 3 and 4 below:

Renal impairment 
The renal impairment study, CFZ001, was conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
safety of carfilzomib 56 mg/m2 using a 30-minute infusion in patients with ESRD. The Phase 3 Study 
2011-003 (ENDEAVOR) enrolled subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment as measured by 
creatinine clearance as low as 15 mL/minute, but excluded those subjects with ESRD. Thus, the PK and 
safety data from CFZ001 will complement the Phase 3 ENDEAVOR study.

Carfilzomib is rapidly and extensively metabolized mainly to M14 and M16. A fast transformation of M16 
into M14 is expected due to their low levels in urine and faeces and its short t1/2. As consequence, 
carfilzomib will be mainly eliminated in urine as metabolite M14 or incorporated into normal biosynthetic 
pathways due to its peptidic nature and its irreversible binds to its target. The percent of M14 excreted in 
urine relative to the dose of carfilzomib was approximately 30%, M14 has a short half-life, no

accumulation is expected for this metabolite and M14 is described as a no pharmacological active 
metabolite. 
Hepatic impairment 
The hepatic impairment study CFZ002 is currently ongoing and the final study report is expected during 
the second quarter of 2016 (please refer to the Risk management plan section). 
Study CFZ002 was designed to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic characteristics of carfilzomib in 
subjects with normal hepatic function or varying degrees of chronic hepatic impairment (mild, moderate, 
or severe hepatic impairment). Subjects with relapsed or progressive advanced malignancies (solid 
tumors or hematologic malignancies) are enrolled into cohorts based on their degree of hepatic 
impairment. Each cohort is to be composed of approximately 10 evaluable subjects. Carfilzomib was 
administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at 20 mg/m2 on cycle 1 days 1 and 2, followed by 
escalation to 27 mg/m2 on cycle 1 days 8, 9, 15, and 16 of a 28-day cycle. Subjects who adequately 
tolerated dosing at 27 mg/m2 in cycle 1 were administered carfilzomib at 56 mg/m2 in cycle 2 and beyond. 
Pharmacokinetics samples were collected on cycle 1 day 16 (carfilzomib 27 mg/m2) and cycle 2 day 1 
(carfilzomib 56 mg/m2).  
Based on data cutoff of 02 February 2015, a total of 30 subjects were enrolled in the study, including 28 
subjects with solid tumors and 2 subjects with multiple myeloma. Preliminary pharmacokinetic data 
based on approximately 90% of the final planned evaluable subjects in cohorts 1 to 3 (normal hepatic 
function, and mild and moderate hepatic impairment) have been analyzed. As of 08 June 2015, data were 
available from 2 additional subjects in cohort 3 and results were similar to those summarized below based 
on the data cutoff of 02 February 2015.  
As of 02 February 2015, no pharmacokinetic data have been collected for cohort 4 (severe hepatic 
impairment). Enrollment for cohort 4 has been challenging. Although 13 subjects have been screened for 
potential enrollment in cohort 4, only 4 subjects have qualified and none of them were able to stay on 
treatment long enough to enable collection of pharmacokinetic samples on cycle 1 day 16, the primary 
pharmacokinetic time point for this study. All 4 subjects enrolled in cohort 4 of the study have died or 
discontinued treatment prior to reaching cycle 1 day 16. All deaths were confounded by multiple 
comorbidities in the setting of advanced solid tumors with generally extensive hepatic and/or pulmonary 
metastases. Due to continued enrollment challenge and the lack of demonstrable efficacy with carfilzomib 
monotherapy in this population of mostly solid tumor subjects, on 22 July 2015, the United States Food 
and Drug Administration accepted the proposed protocol amendment to close cohort 4.  
The pharmacokinetic parameters after carfilzomib administration at 27 or 56 mg/m2 in subjects with 
hepatic impairment are shown in Table 8.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro, Carfilzomib displayed a modest direct, time-dependent inhibitory effect on human cytochrome 
P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5).  
In the study conducted in subjects with solid tumours (PX-171-008), single and repeat dosing of 
carfilzomib at 27 mg/m2 did not affect the PK of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary pharmacology 
Despite the rapid clearance of carfilzomib from the plasma compartment, IV administration resulted in 
potent and prolonged proteasome inhibition in whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) in subjects with multiple myeloma or solid tumours.  
Following the first dose of carfilzomib (15 to 56 mg/m2), a dose-dependent inhibition of CT-L active sites 
of the 20S proteasome was observed (≥ 67% and ≥ 75% in whole blood and PBMCs, respectively).  A 
similar inhibition profile was observed in bone marrow-derived CD138+ tumour cells.  Proteasome 
inhibition with carfilzomib was found to be durable, with minimal recovery in PBMCs after 24 hours but 
near-complete recovery between carfilzomib dosing cycles. At the higher dose at 56 mg/m2, there was 
not only a greater inhibition of CT-L subunits compared to those at 15 to 20 mg/m2, but also a greater 
inhibition of other proteasome subunits, which may be associated with an increased likelihood of 
achieving a clinical response (DD-0176R-00). Similar proteasome inhibition by carfilzomib was achieved 
with 2- to 10-minute and 30-minute infusions at the 2 dose levels (20 and 36 mg/m2) at which it was 
tested.   
Secondary Pharmacology  
QT Effects 
In Study PX-171-007, 26% of patients treated with a dose of 20/56 had a change from baseline in QTcB 
between 30 and 60 msec. Additionally, case of Torsade de pointes-QT prolongation (SMQB), syncope and 
sudden death had been observed in 1.9%, 1.1% and 0.4% of patients.

Exploratory Exposure-response Analysis  
The MAH has provided an updated analysis to a previously conducted exposure-response analysis 
(TR-1092-171) by incorporating additional data from randomized phase 3 Study 2011-003 (ENDEAVOR). 
Methods 
The exposure efficacy analysis of overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), duration of 
response (DOR), and progression-free survival (PFS) was performed based on 133 of the 464 (28.7%) 
subjects with relapsed multiple myeloma who were randomized to the carfilzomib plus dexamethasone 
arm received a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion of 20/56 mg/m2 carfilzomib in the phase 3 Study 
2011- 003 (ENDEAVOR). 
The pooled exposure-efficacy analysis was based on 507 subjects with multiple myeloma across seven 
studies from 15 to 20/56 mg/m2 dose levels including a randomized phase 3 Study 2011-003 
(ENDEAVOR), a randomized phase 3 Study (PX-171-009) and 5 phase 1b and phase 2 studies 
(PX-171-003 – Part 2 (A1),PX-171-004, PX-171-005, PX-171-006, and PX-171-007). This pooled 
analysis included data from different populations (relapsed or relapsed/refractory), different treatments 
(carfilzomib monotherapy, carfilzomib combination therapy with lenalidomide and dexamethasone [KRd] 
or carfilzomib combination therapy with dexamethasone [Kd]), different infusion lengths (2 to 10 minutes 
or 30 minutes), and different doses (from 15 to 20/56 mg/m2). Duration of response and PFS were not 
included in the pooled analysis, as different assessment criteria of PFS and DOR between the phase 1b/2 
studies and phase 3 studies were used. 
For safety endpoints, a pooled analysis was performed in 576 subjects (507 subjects with multiple 
myeloma and 69 subjects with solid tumors). The safety endpoints included any grade adverse events 
leading to carfilzomib discontinuation, any grade 3 or higher adverse events, and cardiac- and 
hepatic/renal-related adverse events. 
Subjects received IV infusion of carfilzomib over 2 to 10 minutes (over 10 minutes in Study PX-171-009) 
or over 30 minutes (in Study PX-171-007 and phase 3 Study 2011-003) on 2 consecutive days each week 
for 3 weeks (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16), this was followed by a 12-day rest period (days 17 to 28) for 
each 28-day cycle. A population pharmacokinetic (PK) model was used to derive exposure metrics 
(various estimates of area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] and maximum concentration 
[Cmax]) that were explored in relation to efficacy and safety. To assess the relationship of carfilzomib 
exposure with the responses or adverse event, logistic models were used for binary endpoints and 
standard survival analyses (such as log-rank test, linear Cox regression) were performed for time–to 
event endpoints. Subject baseline characteristics, including demographics, ECOG PS, number of prior 
regimens, serum beta-2 microglobulin levels, concomitant medication (dexamethasone or lenalidomide) 
and other covariates, were included in the multiple regression analysis. 
Results:  
The exposure response analysis of efficacy endpoints was consistent with the previously reported results 
(TR-1092-171) demonstrating a relationship between carfilzomib cycle 1 average AUC and response 
categories ORR/CBR across subjects receiving doses from 15 mg/m2 to 20/56 mg/m2. In the exposure 
response analysis of safety endpoints, no statistically significant relationship was identified to indicate a 
correlation between increasing exposure and increasing risk of adverse events in subjects with multiple 
myeloma or solid tumors.

Study 2011-003 (ENDEAVOR): Specifically, the exposure-response analysis of efficacy endpoints in 
subjects from Study 2011-003 alone, in which all subjects received the 20/56 mg/m2 dose, did not show 
any statistically significant relationship between carfilzomib exposure (AUC or Cmax) and the primary 
efficacy endpoints, PFS and ORR/CBR.  
Of note, the median (95% CI) of cycle 1 average AUC in Study 2011-003 (ENDEAVOR) was 108 (48.5 to 
211) ng•h/mL, approximately two times higher than the median (95%CI) of the other studies included in 
the analysis. 
No apparent relationship between carfilzomib exposure and efficacy endpoints was observed in Study 
2011-003 (ENDEAVOR), indicating that multiple myeloma subjects may benefit from carfilzomib 
regardless of potential PK differences within a 30-minute infusion of the 20/56 mg/m2 dosing regimen. 
Pooled Analysis of Clinical Studies: When combining data from all the studies in a pooled exposure 
response analysis of efficacy endpoints, the results of the logistic regression model indicated a 
relationship between carfilzomib cycle 1 average AUC and response categories ORR/CBR with increasing 
cycle 1 average AUC associated with increases in ORR/CBR over a dose range of 15 mg/m2 to 20/56 
mg/m2. The mean ORR in the first and fourth quartiles of the cycle 1 average AUC were 38.5% and 
84.4%, respectively.  
After adjusting for  baseline characteristics and prognostic factors, an increase in cycle 1 average AUC 
from the first to the fourth quartile (45.6 to 87.5 ng•h/mL) was associated with an increase of the ORR by 
a factor of 1.75 (odds ratio = 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24 to 2.52).  
No positive relationships between Cmax and ORR/CBR were identified. 
Figure 2. Logistic regression of the probability of clinical benefit versus AUC (pooled analysis) 
The pooled efficacy analysis also identified several statistically significant covariate effects (p < 0.05) for 
ORR and CBR. The model for ORR indicated that subjects refractory to bortezomib (odds ratio = 0.48; 
95% CI: 0.28 to 0.84) or black race (odds ratio = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.87) had a decreased

probability of overall response while having baseline platelet count ≥ 150 (x 109/L) (odds ratio = 1.90; 
95% CI: 1.20 to 3.03), having one prior line of therapy (odds ratio = 1.97; 95% CI: 1.11 to 3.57), KRd 
combination therapy (odds ratio = 7.93; 95% CI: 4.38 to 14.96), or Kd combination therapy (odds ratio 
= 2.10; 95%CI: 1.00 to 4.45) increased the probability of overall response. 
Table 10. Multiple logistic model for ORR (pooled analysis) 
Despite inclusion of different populations (relapsed or relapsed/refractory), different treatments 
(carfilzomib monotherapy or KRd or Kd combination therapy), different infusion lengths (2 to 10 minutes 
or 30 minutes), and different doses (from 15 to 20/56 mg/m2) in the pooled dataset, the pooled exposure 
response analysis of efficacy endpoints across studies showed that after adjusting for baseline 
characteristics and prognostic factors, higher exposure (cycle 1 average AUC) of carfilzomib is associated 
with improved ORR/CBR across a dose range of 15 to 20/56 mg/m2 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
New data for the 30-minute infusion dose of 20/56 mg/m2 mainly comes from the previously submitted 
trial PX-171-007: A Phase 1b/2, multicentre open label study of the safety and activity of carfilzomib in 
subjects with relapsed solid tumours, relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma or refractory 
lymphoma. Of note, the initial assessment of this trial was focused on the currently approved dose of 
20/27 mg/m2. 
Based on data from studies PX-171-005 and PX-171-007, the exposure (AUC and Cmax) increased in a 
dose-dependent manner from 15 to 56 mg/m2 when looking at similar infusion durations.  
Dose-proportionality was assessed but was limited by the high variability in PK parameters and small 
sample size. Based on these data, Section 5.2 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect it. 
The impact of 30-minute infusion compared to 2 to 10-minute infusion was assessed in the initial MA as 
part of study PX-171-007. Changes included in section 5.2. of SmPC come from study PX-171-007 and 
are acceptable: 
“A 30-minute infusion resulted in a similar half-life and AUC, but 2- to 3-fold lower Cmax compared to that 
observed with a 2- to 10-minute infusion of the same dose. Following a 30-minute infusion of the 56 
mg/m2 dose, the AUC (948 ng•hr/mL) was approximately 2.5-fold that observed at the 27 mg/m2 level, 
and Cmax (2079 ng/mL) was lower compared to that of 27 mg/m2 over the 2- to 10-minute infusion”. 
Hence the following recommendation has been included in Section 5.2 of the SmPC: 
“The Cmax and AUC following a 2- to 10-minute intravenous infusion of 27 mg/m2 was 4,232 ng/mL and 
379 ng•hr/mL, respectively.  Following repeated doses of Kyprolis at 15 and 20 mg/m2, systemic

exposure (AUC) and half-life were similar on days 1 and 15 or 16 of cycle 1, suggesting there was no 
systemic carfilzomib accumulation.  At doses between 20 and 36 56 mg/m2, there was a dose-dependent 
increase in exposure”. 
 An updated population PK model has been presented including, in addition to the previous clinical trials, 
data from study 2011-003 as well as preliminary data from the currently ongoing trials in patients with 
renal and hepatic impairment (CFZ001, CFZ002). Using the previously identified structural model for 
carfilzomib, a slight effect of BSA on clearance was observed. However, PK exposure metrics based on the 
final model found 95% of all subjects taking carfilzomib achieve exposure (Cmax and AUC) within 10% of 
the exposure for a subject with median BSA. The current population PK analysis did not identify any other 
clinically meaningful covariates that impacted the pharmacokinetic profile of carfilzomib. Shrinkage (%) 
is higher than 30% in the final PK model (Variation II- 001). In fact, because of the high (> 40%) 
shrinkage in the V1 random effects in the base model, visual assessment of the random effects versus the 
covariates was not used to select covariate models. Instead, an automated stepwise selection was used. 
It should be also noted that BQL (13.3%) has been omitted in this population PK. The “M3 BLQ method” 
which exclude data errors and assume all non-zero trough measurements to be BLQ observations (Beal 
2001), was not explored in the current analysis as the previous population PK analysis 
(TR-1015-171-Marketing Authorization procedure) did not find that using the M3 BLQ replacement 
method resulted in substantially better fits. Of note due to the high shrinkage detected in the final PK 
model, the conclusion of this population PK model should be interpreted with caution. Regarding 
methods, the execution and results with NONMEN and Prediction corrected VPC were provided during the 
evaluation and were considered adequate. 
Regarding renal impairment, study PX-171-005 and preliminary data on Study CFZ001 showed that the 
pharmacokinetics of carfilzomib was similar between subjects with normal renal function and subjects on 
dialysis (end-stage renal disease [ESRD]). These data suggest that the pharmacokinetics of carfilzomib is 
not influenced by the degree of baseline renal impairment; however this will be reviewed when the final 
study report for CFZ001 will be submitted through a variation by the second quarter of 2016. 
Considering the metabolism of carfilzomib and its routes of excretion, hepatic impairment is not expected 
to have meaningful impact on pharmacokinetic of carfilzomib. However, its biological activity per se could 
be responsible of hepatic safety consequences. The hepatic impairment study CFZ002 is currently 
ongoing and the final study report will be submitted through a variation by the second quarter of 2016. 
No new drug interaction studies have been performed. Taking into account that Carfilzomib displayed a 
modest direct, time-dependent inhibitory effect on human cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5), a DDI 
study with midazolam was conducted at the time of initial MA. Taking into account that doses higher than 
27mg have not been tested in DDI study with midazolan, DDI cannot be ruled out at doses as high as 
20/56 mg/m2. The applicant has developed a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to 
predict the potential effect of carfilzomib at doses of 56 and 70 mg/m2 on the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A 
substrate midazolam. Simulations using the PBPK model indicated no impact of carfilzomib on midazolam 
PK for the doses of 56 and 70 mg/m2, similar to the clinical data observed at 27 mg/m2. Hence, in order 
to properly address the issue, the CHMP recommends the submission of the PBPK report which is 
expected to be finalised by May 2016. In the meantime, the information included in the SmPC about this 
issue has been updated to reflect that the study with midazolam was conducted with dose of 27 mg/m2 
(2-10 min infusion) and no data are available with dose of 56 mg/m2 (30 min infusion).

The following recommendation was made in section 5.1 of the SmpC with regards to the higher dose of 56 
mg/m2: 
“At the higher dose of 56 mg/m2, there was not only a greater inhibition of CT-L subunits (≥ 90%) 
compared to those at 15 to 20 mg/m2, but also a greater inhibition of other proteasome subunits (LMP7, 
MECL1, and LMP2). There was an approximately 8%, 23% and 34% increase in the inhibition of LMP7, 
MECL1, and LMP2 subunits respectively at the dose of 56 mg/m2compared to those at 15 to 20 mg/m2. 
Similar proteasome inhibition by carfilzomib was achieved with 2- to 10-minute and 30-minute infusions 
at the 2 dose levels (20 and 36 mg/m2) at which it was tested.” 
In Study PX-171-007, 26% of patients treated with a dose of 20/56 had a change from baseline in QTcB 
between 30 and 60 msec. Additionally, case of Torsade de pointes-QT prolongation (SMQB), syncope and 
sudden death had been observed in 1.9%, 1.1% and 0.4% of patients. However, as there was no clear 
signal of a dose/concentration-related effect of carfilzomib on cardiac repolarization using the QT interval 
with Fridericia’s correction (QTcF interval) or from the analysis of concentration-QTc analysis in the initial 
marketing procedure, the current warning about QT interval prolongation included in the section 4.4 of 
SmPC is still considered adequate. Cardiac arrhythmias associated with carfilzomib treatment will 
continue to be monitored with routine pharmacovigilance.  
Results from the updated exposure-response analysis were overall in line with the previously submitted 
report. Only a relationship was found in the pooled analysis between carfilzomib cycle 1 average AUC and 
ORR/CBR with increasing AUC associated with higher probability of response. No relation between 
exposure and safety endpoints was found. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacology of Kyprolis for the new combination has been reasonably well investigated.  
Changes under sections 4.5 (in relation with DDI study with midazolam), 5.1 and 5.2 (regarding 
pharmacodynamics of the newly proposed dose) have been implemented.  
The CHMP recommends the submission of the PBPK report by October 2016.  
In addition, the final study reports for the currently ongoing trials in patients with renal and hepatic 
impairment (CFZ001, CFZ002) will be provided in Q2 2016 in line with the RMP.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
The carfilzomib dose of 20/56 mg/m2 was selected for this head-to-head study based on evidence of a 
dose-response relationship and the hypothesis that a greater depth and duration of proteasome 
inhibition, which could be achieved with higher doses, could drive greater efficacy.  Preclinical studies in 
rats showed that when comparable doses were tested, an increased infusion time led to lower maximum 
drug concentration in plasma (Cmax), comparable area under the plasma drug concentration time curve 
(AUC) and proteasome inhibition, and better tolerability (Jiang 2011; Yang 2011).  A phase 1b study, 
PX-171-007 showed high response rates at higher doses of carfilzomib and identified 56 mg/m2 as the

maximum tolerated dose (MTD) when infused over 30 minutes in subjects with relapsed or refractory 
multiple myeloma. Carfilzomib was highly active and well tolerated at a dose of 56 mg/m2 when given 
alone or in combination with dexamethasone.

Treatments 
Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either carfilzomib with dexamethasone (Cd arm) or bortezomib 
with dexamethasone (Vd arm). Study treatment was administered to subjects in both arms until 
confirmed disease progression, physician decision, intolerable side effects necessitating discontinuation, 
withdrawal of consent, or death.  
The treatments administered in each study arm are summarized below.  
Carfilzomib Plus Dexamethasone Arm 
Subjects randomized to the Cd arm received their assigned treatment in 28-day cycles as follows: 
•  Dexamethasone 20 mg was to be given on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16 , 22, and 23 at least 30 minutes 
(but no more than 4 hours) prior to carfilzomib, on a schedule of every 28 days. 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/517040/2016  
Page 29/101 
 
 
 
 
 
o  On nonclinic days, dexamethasone oral (PO) could be self-administered at home. Missed 
doses of dexamethasone were not to be made up.  
o  Subjects were to maintain a diary of outpatient dexamethasone PO administration. 
•  Carfilzomib 20 mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) on Days 1 and 2 of Cycle 1, followed by 
escalation to 56 mg/m2 over 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) on Days 8, 9, 15, and 16 of Cycle 1.  
o  Subjects who tolerated 56 mg/m2 in Cycle 1 were to be kept at this dose on Days 1, 2, 8, 
9, 15, and 16 every 28 days until PD or intolerable side effects. 
Carfilzomib was to be administered within ± 2 days of the scheduled dose. Anticipated treatment delays 
greater than 2 days were to be discussed with the medical monitor. 
Bortezomib Plus Dexamethasone Arm 
Subjects randomized to the Vd arm received their assigned treatment in 21-day cycles as follows: 
•  Dexamethasone 20 mg was to be given on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 every 21 days at least 
30 minutes (but no more than 4 hours) prior to bortezomib. 
o  On nonclinic days, dexamethasone PO could be self-administered at home. Missed doses 
of dexamethasone were not to be made up. 
o  Subjects were to maintain a diary of outpatient PO dexamethasone administration. 
•  Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 IV push or SC (per regulatory approval) was to be given on Days 1, 4, 8, 
and 11 of each 21-day cycle until PD or intolerable side effects. Subjects were to continue to 
receive bortezomib with the same route of administration (SC or IV) throughout the study. A 
switch of route of administration for medical reasons could be made per the physician’s 
discretion.  
Bortezomib was to be administered within ± 2 days of the scheduled dose. Anticipated treatment 
delays greater than 2 days were to be discussed with the medical monitor.  
Intravenous hydration was to be given immediately prior to carfilzomib during Cycle 1 and at the 
investigator’s discretion in Cycle 2 and higher. This was to consist of 250 to 500 mL normal saline or other 
appropriate IV fluid. The goal of the hydration program was to maintain robust urine output (e.g., ≥ 2 
L/day). Subjects were to be monitored periodically during this period for evidence of fluid overload. 
For subjects thought to be at particularly high risk for the development of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), 
based on high tumor burden, guidance to begin oral hydration up to 48 hours before starting carfilzomib 
could be given.  
The dose of carfilzomib was to be calculated using the subject’s actual body surface area (BSA) at 
baseline. Subjects with a BSA > 2.2 m2 were to receive a dose based upon a 2.2 m2 BSA. Dose 
adjustments did not need to be made for weight gains/losses of ≤ 20%. 
At Cycle 1 Day 1, the following treatments were also started: 
•  Valacyclovir 500 mg PO, once daily (or equivalent antiviral), continuing for the duration of 
treatment (additional prophylaxis was at the investigator’s discretion).L 
• 
Lansoprazole 15 mg PO, once daily (or other oral proton-pump inhibitor to prevent peptic ulcer 
disease according to institutional practice) for the duration of treatment with dexamethasone 
Optional and allowed concomitant medications were:

•  Allopurinol (or other approved uric acid-lowering agent) could be prescribed at the investigator’s 
discretion in subjects at high risk for TLS due to high tumor burden. 
•  Mycostatin or oral fluconazole could be prescribed at the investigator’s discretion to prevent oral 
thrush. 
•  Antiemetics and antidiarrheal agents could be administered as necessary.  
•  Myeloid growth factors could be used if neutropenia occurred but were not to be given 
prophylactically. 
•  Red blood cell transfusions, erythropoietin stimulating agents, or platelet transfusions were 
permitted if clinically indicated in accordance with institutional guidelines. 
• 
Palliative radiation for pain management was permitted with the written approval of the medical 
monitor. 
•  Bisphosphonates were permitted as indicated and in accordance with institutional guidelines. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to compare PFS in subjects with multiple myeloma who relapsed 
after 1 to 3 prior therapies treated with carfilzomib plus dexamethasone (Cd) or bortezomib plus 
dexamethasone (Vd). 
The secondary objectives of this study were to compare the following between the study arms: Overall 
survival (OS): Overall response rate (ORR); Neuropathy events; Safety and tolerability (assess change 
from baseline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), right ventricular (RV) function, and pulmonary 
artery pressure in a subset of subjects from both treatment groups). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of the study was PFS as determined by the IRC, defined as the time from 
randomization to the earlier of disease progression or death due to any cause. 
The secondary endpoints were: 
•  OS, defined as the time from randomization to the date of death (whatever the cause). 
•  ORR, defined as the proportion of subjects in each study arm who achieved confirmed stringent 
complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial 
response (PR) as their best response. 
•  Duration of response (DOR), defined as the time in months from the initial start of response (PR 
or better) to the earlier of documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. 
•  Neuropathy events, defined as the incidence of Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy (PN), as 
specified by peripheral neuropathy Standardised MedDRA Query, narrow (scope) (SMQN) terms. 
The study had the following exploratory objectives: 
• 
• 
Evaluate population pharmacokinetics (PK) for a subset of Cd subjects and 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PDn) relationships for safety and efficacy 
Evaluate pharmacodynamic (PDn) and proteomic biomarkers in a subset of subjects from both 
treatment groups 
•  Analyse genetic and gene expression biomarkers that may potentially predict for response and

•  Compare TTP between the treatment groups 
•  Compare CBR (defined as ORR + minimal response [MR]) between the treatment groups 
•  Compare DCR (defined as ORR + MR + stable disease [SD] lasting at least 8 weeks) between the 
treatment groups 
•  Compare Global Health Status/Quality of Life (QoL) (measured by EORTC Quality of Life 
Questionnaire QLQ-C30) 
•  Compare subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-MY20, and FACT/GOG-Ntx (Version 4; 
“Additional Concerns” questionnaire) between the treatment groups and describe Medical 
Resource Utilization (MRU) 
• 
Evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD) status: The frequency of MRD negativity when CR, sCR, 
or VGPR is achieved 
Sample size 
It was estimated that 526 PFS events would provide 90% power to detect a PFS hazard ratio (HR) of 0.75 
with 1-sided overall Type-I error of 0.025 when 1 interim analysis was performed at 75% of information 
time (i.e., 75% of 526 PFS events) using O’Brien-Fleming type alpha spending function. A total of 888 
subjects enrolled over a 22-month period, including 9 months of enrolment ramp-up period and followed 
for an additional 8 months after the planned closure of enrolment, was expected to result in the required 
526 events. Additional assumptions that informed sample size calculation included exponential 
distribution for PFS, 10.0 months median PFS for Regimen Vd (i.e., 13.3 months median PFS for Regimen 
Cd), and a 3% rate for loss to follow-up. 
The final analysis of OS was to be performed after approximately 496 deaths occurred. A total of 496 
deaths would provide 69% power to detect a HR of 0.8 corresponding to a 20% reduction in risk of death 
for Cd versus Vd, with a 1-sided significance level of 0.025 and 2 planned OS interim analyses. This is 
based on historical data and is under the assumption of 29.8 months of median OS for the Vd arm and the 
exponential distribution of OS (Richardson 2005). A 2% loss to follow-up for the OS endpoint was also 
assumed in this calculation.  
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Cd or Vd through an interactive voice or 
interactive web response system (IXRS). Randomization was stratified based on: 
• 
• 
• 
Prior proteasome inhibitor treatment (Yes or No) 
International Staging System (ISS) Stage (Stage 1 versus Stages 2 or 3) 
Lines of prior treatment (1 versus 2 or 3 lines) 
•  Choice of route of bortezomib administration (IV versus SC - in accordance with local regulatory 
approved route of administration) 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study.

Statistical methods 
General considerations 
Summary statistics were to be provided for the primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints. For 
continuous variables, the number of subjects with non-missing data, mean, either the standard of error 
or the standard deviation, median, 25th percentile (first quartile), 75th percentile (third quartile), 
minimum, and maximum were to be presented for each study arm. The distribution of time-to-event 
endpoints was to be summarized by Kaplan-Meier method. Quartiles, including median were to be 
estimated by Kaplan-Meier method along with their 95% CIs by Klein and Moeschberger (1997) with 
log-log transformation for each study arm. Duration of follow-up for time-to-event endpoints was to be 
summarized for each study arm by reverse Kaplan-Meier method (Schemper 1996). For discrete 
variables, frequencies and percentages were to be presented. Point estimates were to be accompanied by 
2-sided 95% CIs. 
Analysis populations 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population was the basis for the primary analysis of efficacy in this study, and 
it consisted of all randomized subjects. Subjects in the ITT Population were included in the treatment 
group to which they were randomized. All efficacy endpoints (PFS, OS, ORR, TTP, CBR, and DCR) were 
analysed in the ITT Population. 
Independent review committee and Independent Data Monitoring Committee 
The primary responsibility of the IRC was the independent assessment of subject efficacy outcomes in 
accordance with the IMWG-URC. The IRC assessments were made without knowledge of the 
randomization assignments, subject, site, investigator identity, or individual subject efficacy outcomes, 
as determined by the local investigators and ORCA. The outcomes determined by the IRC were to serve 
as the primary data source for the primary interim and final analysis for PFS. The IRC was not responsible 
for assessing safety. The IRC was composed of 3 independent multiple myeloma experts 
An IDMC was convened for this study and acted in an advisory capacity to the sponsor with respect to 
safeguarding the interests of study subjects, assessing interim safety and efficacy data, and monitoring 
the overall conduct of the study. The IDMC provided recommendations for stopping or continuing the 
study. The IDMC was composed of 3 experts in multiple myeloma and 1 biostatistician 
Study endpoints 
Progression-free survival was defined as the duration in months from randomization to the earlier of 
disease progression or death due to any cause. Response and disease progression were to be centrally 
reviewed by the IRC and also, for supportive analyses, determined by the sponsor using Onyx Response 
Computational Assessment (ORCA), a computer algorithm prespecified before the unblinded interim 
efficacy analysis, as well as investigators. The primary data source for the final analysis was to be the 
results determined by the IRC. Analyses of concordance and discordance between the IRC, local 
investigators, and ORCA assessments of disease response and progression were also to be performed. 
The discordance between the results from the local investigator, ORCA evaluation, and IRC were to be 
summarized overall and by study arm. 
The robustness of the PFS analysis based on disease outcomes determined by the IRC was evaluated 
using the following prespecified sensitivity analyses: Progression-free survival assessed by local

investigators; Progression-free survival assessed by the sponsor using disease ORCA; Unstratified 
analysis; Initiation of nonprotocol anticancer therapy treated as a PFS event; Initiation of nonprotocol 
anticancer therapy treated as neither a PFS event nor a censoring event; Missing assessments treated as 
censoring events in Vd arm and as PFS events in the Cd arm 
•  Changes over time in QLQ-C30 Global Health Scale/QoL score were to be compared between 
treatment groups using a restricted maximum likelihood-based mixed model for repeated 
measures (MMRM). The dependent variable of this model was the QLQ-C30 Global Health 
Scale/QoL visit score measured every 4 weeks (every 28 days ± 4 days), including baseline visits. 
The model was to include treatment effect (Cd versus Vd), as well as the 4 randomization 
stratification factors, as fixed effects. Analyses of selected subscales of QLQ-C30 and QLQ-MY20 
were also performed. 
• 
The FACT/GOG-Ntx scores were analyzed using the same MMRM modeling approach that was 
used for analysis of the QLQ-C30 Global Health Scale/QoL scale 
Interim analysis 
The PFS interim analysis was to be performed using a group sequential monitoring plan. The monitoring 
plan included an O’Brien-Fleming type of efficacy stopping boundary constructed using the Lan-DeMets 
alpha spending function (Lan 1983; DeMets 1995) to ensure a 1-sided Type I error rate ≤ 0.025. The 
monitoring boundary was adjusted by the IDMC to correspond to the actual events observed at the 
interim analysis using the same design method as described.  
Table 1. Monitoring Criteria and Alpha Spending at the Interim and Final Analyses of Progression-Free 
Survival 
The OS analysis at the primary PFS analysis (either interim or final PFS analysis time) was the first OS 
interim analysis. All other secondary endpoints will be final at the primary PFS analysis time.

the IRC and investigators, and 76% consistent between investigators and ORCA. In comparison, 
concordance rates for assessment of best overall response were notably lower, with higher concordance 
between the IRC and ORCA (81.3%) than between the IRC and investigators (55.8%), or between 
investigators and ORCA (52.5%). Probably, this was due to the fact that the CRF page capturing best 
overall response by investigator (BOR) was not expected to be completed until the patient discontinues 
therapy

Exploratory endpoints 
Time to progression (TTP) 
The median TTP was longer in the Cd arm (22.2 months [95% CI: 17.7, NE]) than in the Vd arm (10.1 
months [95% CI: 8.8, 11.7]). The median follow-up for disease progression was 11.3 months (95% CI: 
11.1, 12.1) in the Cd arm and 11.0 months (95% CI: 9.5, 11.3) in the Vd arm. 
Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) 
The CBR by IRC in the Cd arm (81.9% [95% CI: 78.1, 85.3]) was higher than in the Vd arm (73.8% [95% 
CI: 69.5, 77.7]). As determined by ORCA, the CBR was 82.1% (95% CI: 78.3, 85.5) in the Cd arm and 
76.3% (95% CI: 72.2, 80.1) in the Vd arm. By investigators, the CBR was 61.6% (95% CI: 57.0, 66.1) 
in the Cd arm and 64.7% (95% CI: 60.2, 69.1) in the Vd arm. 
Disease Control Rate (DCR) 
By IRC, the DCR was 90.5% (95% CI: 87.5, 93.0) in the Cd arm and 85.2% (95% CI: 81.6, 88.3) in the 
Vd arm). As determined by ORCA, the DCR was 88.8% (95% CI: 85.6, 91.5) in the Cd arm and 83.4% 
(95% CI: 79.7, 86.7) in the Vd arm. By investigators, the DCR was 69.6% (95% CI: 65.2, 73.8) in the Cd 
arm and 77.2% (95% CI: 73.1, 80.9) in the Vd arm.

Notes

<0.0001 
Based on the results from the PFS interim analysis, the IDMC 
recommended stopping the trial for efficacy, and Onyx Pharmaceuticals 
accepted the recommendation. Monitoring for safety and long-term 
survival is continuing. 
Stratification factors were: prior proteasome inhibitor treatment (Yes or 
No), ISS Stage (Stage 1 versus Stages 2 or 3), lines of prior treatment (1 
versus 2 or 3 lines) and choice of route of bortezomib administration (IV 
versus SC) 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The 2011-003 study was designed in order to allow the recruitment of patients with MM previously treated 
with at least one prior line (transplant is considered 1st line of therapy) but not more than three. Both 
bortezomib and carfilzomib were allowed as previous treatment, provided at least PR was obtained and 
there was a treatment-free interval of 6 months. Patients refractory to prior lenalidomide treatment were 
allowed. The requirement for a 6 month treatment-free interval reflects the usual clinical practice with 
bortezomib, though there are nodata regarding carfilzomib a similar pattern could be expected. In the Cd 
arm, subjects received carfilzomib 20 mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1, followed by 
escalation to 56 mg/m2 over 30 minutes on days 8, 9, 15, and 16 of cycle 1.  Subjects who tolerated 56 
mg/m2 in cycle 1 were kept at this dose for each subsequent 28 day cycle until disease progression, 
intolerable side effects, withdrawal of consent, or death. Bortezomib was administered iv or sc.The 
bortezomib PI (based on the RETRIEVE trial) recommends that patients achieving a response or a stable 
disease after 4 cycles of Vd can continue to receive the same combination for a maximum of 4 additional 
cycles. However, in the ENDEAVOUR study, subjects received bortezomib until disease progression, 
intolerable side effects, withdrawal of consent, or death.  This approach seems reasonable in the context 
of a clinical trial, especially in those subjects where bortezomib was administered sc. 
PFS was the primary endpoint, with OS, ORR and DoR as secondary endpoints. The use of PFS as main 
outcome variable is acceptable, given that there are different efficacious treatment alternatives that 
patients could receive, which will likely modify the expected survival. Although the design of the study is 
unblinded, the use of an IRC  to assess response (as defined by IMWG-URC) is endorsed. In addition, the 
different sensitive analyses planned increase the level of robustness of the results. 
No critical protocol deviations or amendments have been identified. One key change to the original design 
was introduced. It was a reduction in the required number of OS events. This revision was made to 
shorten the expected study duration and minimize the impact of cross-over. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The population recruited in the study is the one expected at relapse. The median age of 65 is similar to 
that in other phase 3 studies in relapsed MM patients. The study enrolled 143 subjects (15%)above 75 
years. The majority geographic region is Western Europe (38%).  
More than half of patients received previous transplant (vast majority autologous). Patients with at least 
2 previous regimens are 50%. Thalidomide and bortezomib were received by 50%, whereas lenalidomide 
was administered to 38%. Prior Imid and Bortezomib were received in 35% of subjects. Approximately 
4% of patients were refractory to any prior bortezomib therapy. Refractory to the last therapy was 
reported in 40%, with 25% (235 subjects) of patients refractory to lenalidomide.

Repeating protease inhibitor treatment for relapsing MM is a clinical option, especially after a long-lasting 
remission (>12 months). In patients on 2011-003 whose last prior regimen included bortezomib (n=343) 
PFS was longer in the Cd arm than in the Vd arm regardless of the length of the bortezomib-free period 
(data not shown). 
After a recommendation of the IDMC based on the first interim analysis of PFS, the study was stopped.  
The use of Cd provided an increase in PFS of approximately 9 months vs Vd (HR = 0.533 [95% CI: 0.437, 
0.651]; log-rank p < 0.0001). The median PFS was 18.7 months (95% CI: 15.6, not estimable [NE]) in 
the Cd arm versus 9.4 months (95% CI: 8.4, 10.4) in Vd. This result seems robust as the different 
sensitive analyses offer similar results. In the new analysis provided (cutoff date of 3 March 2016) both 
the PFS investigator assessed and PFS by ORCA show comparable results to the previous analysis.It is not 
proven thatthis delay in the progression of MM can be translated into a longer survival, since OS data are 
not definitive. In this regard the first interim analysis offered a positive trend for Cd vs Vd (HR = 0.786; 
95% CI:  0.575, 1.075; p = 0.065) supported with the same trend in a post hoc analysis (65% of total 
events required) with a HR of 0.805 (95%CI: 0.646, 1.003). The second interim analysis is expected 
during this year (in second half 2016). 
Secondary variables according to IRC support the PFS results. However, the investigator assessment 
showed no differences between arms (Cd vs Vd) in ORR, CBR and DCR. This unexpected result could be 
due to the fact that the CRF page capturing best overall response by investigator was not expected to be 
completed until the patient discontinued therapy.  In contrast, the IRC assessed best overall response for 
all subjects regardless if they had discontinued therapy.  Due to the prolonged PFS, two hundred subjects 
were still on therapy on the Cd arm and 105 on the Vd arm at the time of the IA data cutoff, which resulted 
in 168 subjects with missing investigator assessed BOR (109 Cd arm subjects and 59 Vd arm subjects).  
The best overall response of those subjects was imputed as NE in investigator assessed BOR analyses and 
these subjects were counted as non-responders which resulted in low ORR, CBR and DCR estimates per 
investigator.  
The depth of the response (rate of sCR+CR+VGPR) is higher for the experimental arm (Cd) regardless of 
the method of analysis (IRC; investigator). 
The PFS benefit of Kd was consistently observed in the vast majority of subgroups, including patients 
≥ 75 years of age (n = 143), patients with high risk genetic mutations (n = 210), and patients with 
baseline creatinine clearance of 30 - < 50mL/min (n = 128). 
Other subgroups of interest also showed the superiority of the new combination (Cd): prior bortezomib 
treatment (PFS HR 0.56 95%CI [0.436, 0.728]), prior lenalidomide (PFS HR 0.69 95%CI [0.516, 0.918]) 
and prior Imid and bortezomib (PFS HR 0.64 95%CI [0.473, 0.861]). However, in one potential 
population for this combination, patients refractory to lenalidomide, the benefit is less clear (PFS HR 0.80 
95%CI [0.573, 1.110]) though there seem to be a higher response in those treated with Cd than those 
treated with Vd (61.9% vs 54.9%). In addition, patients refractory/intolerant to Bortezomib were 
excluded from the study. Despite this inclusion criterion, surprisingly there is a very small subgroup of 
patients labelled as bortezomib refractory (19+15 Vd and Cd) where the treatment with Cd seems to be 
superior to Vd (PFS HR 0.37 95%CI [0.128, 1.080]) even though it does not seem reasonable to obtain 
conclusions from this comparison (bortezomib would not be the best comparator and the activity of 
carfilzomib in these subjects is not totally known). 
Finally, although this is a low sample size, in the subgroup of patients who received bortezomib in the line 
just prior to randomization and had an interval relapse free of 6-12 months, there were not substantial 
differences between treatments (median PFS duration 6.5 months; 95% CI: 1.1, 17.5 in the Vd arm and

7.2 months (1.5, NE) in the Cd arm with HR=0.963; 95% CI: 0.32, 2.899). Of note, the ORR was 75% 
(6/8 subjects) in the Vd arm, and 42% (5/12 subjects) in the Cd arm. In those with an interval relapse 
>12 months, the benefit of Cd seems consistently higher than in those subjects treated with Vd 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The superiority of the new combination of Carfilzomib plus Dexamethasone (Cd) vs. Bortezomib plus 
Dexamethasone (Vd) has been shown in terms of improved PFS, of approximately 9 months, and 
improved depth of response. PFS results showed a significant benefit for those patients treated with Cd.  
The CHMP recommended the submission of the OS second interim analysis of the ENDEAVOUR study by 
July 2017.

subjects were enrolled. 
−  Serious  adverse  events  (102  events)  in  the  Early  Carfilzomib  Access  Program  (ECAP)  in  23 
countries in which 571 subjects were enrolled.  
-  Serious  adverse  events  (100  events)  in  the  Single  Patient  Investigational  New  Drug  (SPIND) 
program in which 35 subjects were enrolled. 
− Adverse events (11145 total events: serious [2528 events] and non-serious [8617 events]) from 
postmarketing reports, where it is estimated that approximately 20000 patients have been treated

Patient exposure 
Carfilzomib is currently being evaluated worldwide in several phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical studies as a 
treatment option for patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. As of 30 June 2015, 
subjects have been exposed to carfilzomib in the following studies or programs: 
•  Approximately  4450  individual  subjects  have  been  enrolled  in  22  clinical  studies  (Onyx/Amgen 
sponsored), of which an estimated total of 2940 subjects have been treated with carfilzomib. 
• 3549 subjects have been enrolled in 76 ISTs, of which 2413 were treated with carfilzomib. 
• 89 subjects have been enrolled in Ono Pharmaceutical sponsored studies. 
• 571 subjects have been enrolled in the Early Carfilzomib Access Program (ECAP) in 23 countries. 
• 35 subjects have been enrolled in the SPIND program. 
• Approximately 20000 patients have received carfilzomib in the postmarketing setting. 
In  combination  with  dexamethasone,  patients  were  exposed  to  carfilzomib  in  study  2011-003 
(ENDEAVOR), which is the main study supporting the present application.

Adverse events of special interest 
Cardiac Adverse Events 
Cardiac Arrhythmias 
The  cumulative  subject  incidence  during  the  ENDEAVOR  120-day  Safety  Update  was  17.3%  (2.8%  ≥ 
grade 3) in the Cd arm and 10.1% (4.4% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm.  
Since the ENDEAVOR sNDA, no additional cardiac arrhythmia adverse events led to discontinuation of 
carfilzomib or bortezomib and there were no additional fatal cardiac arrhythmia adverse events. 
The following adverse events were ≥ 2% more frequent in subjects in the Cd arm compared with those in 
the Vd arm: tachycardia (Cd 4.8%, Vd 2.0%), palpitations (Cd 4.8%, Vd 0.9%), and sinus tachycardia 
(Cd 2.6%, Vd 0.9%). Syncope was the only event that occurred with a ≥ 2% higher frequency in subjects 
in the Vd arm compared with those in the Cd arm (Cd 1.3%, Vd 3.7%).   
Torsades de pointes-QT prolongation (SMQB) occurred in 1.9% of subjects in the Cd arm compared with 
5.0% of subjects in the Vd arm. In the Cd arm, 1.1% of subjects had events that were Grade 3 or higher 
versus 3.1% of subjects in the Vd arm. For both treatment groups, the most common event, of any grade, 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/517040/2016  
Page 72/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was syncope, which occurred in 5 (1.1%) subjects in the Cd arm and in 17 (3.7%) subjects in the Vd arm. 
Within this grouping, events leading to the discontinuation of carfilzomib or bortezomib occurred in 0.4% 
and 0.2% of subjects,  respectively. Grade 5 events occurred in 1.1% of subjects in the Cd arm and in 
0.4% of subjects in the Vd arm. Since the ENDEAVOR sNDA, 1 additional subject in the Cd arm had an 
adverse event in the Torsade de pointes-QT prolongation of syncope; the cumulative subject incidence 
was 2.2% in the Cd arm and 5.0% in the Vd arm.  
Cardiac Failure 
The cumulative subject incidence during the ENDEAVOR 120-day Safety Update was 8.6% (5.2% ≥ grade 
3) in the Cd arm and 3.3% (2.0% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm.  
Since the ENDEAVOR sNDA, there were no additional fatal cardiac failures. No additional subjects in the 
Vd arm had a cardiac failure that resulted in discontinuation of bortezomib and 2 additional subjects in the 
Cd arm had a cardiac failure that resulted in discontinuation of carfilzomib. 
The most common events were cardiac failure (Cd 3.7%, Vd 1.1%) and decreased ejection fraction (Cd 
2.4%, Vd 0.9%). 
Cardiomyopathy 
The cumulative subject incidence during the ENDEAVOR 120-day Safety Update was 3.5% (1.9% ≥ grade 
3) in the Cd arm and 1.3% (0.4% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm. No fatal adverse events were reported for the 
cardiomyopathy in either treatment arm. One additional subject in the Cd arm had a cardiomyopathy 
adverse event that resulted in discontinuation of carfilzomib. 
The decreased ejection fraction was the most frequently reported event (Cd 2.4%, Vd 0.9%). 
Ischemic Heart Disease 
The cumulative subject incidence in Study 2011-003 during the ENDEAVOR 120-day Safety Update was 
3.0% (1.7% ≥ grade 3) in the Cd arm and 2.0% (1.5% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm. Since the ENDEAVOR 
sNDA,  there  were  no  additional  fatal  adverse  events  or  adverse  events  leading  to  discontinuation  of 
carfilzomib or bortezomib. 
Angina pectoris was the most frequently reported event (Cd 1.1%, Vd: 0.2%). 
Cardiopulmonary Sub- study 
A cardiopulmonary substudy was conducted within Study 2011-003 to explore the impact of carfilzomib 
on echocardiographic parameters and their correlation with cardiac events. 
The  results  of  the  mixed-model  for  repeated  measures  analysis  of  change  in  left  ventricular  ejection 
fraction, fractional area change, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure have not significantly changed 
since the ENDEAVOR sNDA. 
The substudy did not find echocardiographic evidence of cumulative cardiac injury associated with the use 
of carfilzomib over a median of approximately 30 weeks of exposure.

Gastrointestinal Events 
Gastrointestinal  adverse  events  of  diarrhea,  nausea,  constipation,  and  vomiting  were  previously 
identified  as  ADRs  of  carfilzomib.  Since  the  ENDEAVOR  sNDA,  1  new  adverse  drug  reaction 
(gastrointestinal perforation) has been identified. 
The  cumulative  subject  incidence  during  the  ENDEAVOR  120-day  Safety  Update  was  59.8%  (9.7%  ≥ 
grade 3) in Cd arm and 65.1% (14.3% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm. Since the ENDEAVOR sNDA, 2 additional 
subjects (1 Cd, 1 Vd) had a gastrointestinal adverse event that resulted in discontinuation of carfilzomib 
or bortezomib. There were no fatal gastrointestinal disorder adverse events. 
The most common adverse events in the ENDEAVOR sNDA, were diarrhea (Cd 33.5%, Vd 40.1%), nausea 
(Cd 22.0%, Vd 19.1%), vomiting (Cd 15.6%, Vd 9.2%), and constipation (Cd 15.1%, Vd 27.9%). 
Hematologic Events 
Anemia 
The cumulative subject incidence during the ENDEAVOR 120-day Safety Update was 41.7% (15.8% ≥ 
grade 3) in the Cd arm and 28.1% (10.1% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm. Since the ENDEAVOR sNDA, 1 
additional  subject  had  anemia  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  carfilzomib  and  no  subjects  had  a  fatal 
anemia adverse event. 
Leukopenia 
The cumulative subject incidence during the ENDEAVOR 120-day Safety Update was 21.8% (15.3% ≥ 
grade 3) in the Cd arm and 16.4% (8.6% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm.  Since the ENDEAVOR sNDA, no 
additional subjects had leukopenia adverse events that led to discontinuation of carfilzomib or bortezomib 
and  there  were  no  fatal  leukopenia  adverse  events.  The  decreased  lymphocyte  count  (Cd  9.1%,  Vd 
3.9%),  lymphopenia  (Cd  6.7%,  Vd  5.5%),  and  neutropenia  (Cd  5.8%,  Vd  5.5%)  were  the  3  most 
frequently reported adverse events during the ENDEAVOR 120-day Safety Update.  Of the ≥ grade 3 
adverse events, decreased lymphocyte count (Cd 6.3%, Vd 1.8%) and lymphopenia (Cd 4.5%, Vd 3.1%) 
occurred at a higher frequency in the Cd arm (≥ 1% difference compared with Vd arm). 
Grade  4  neutropenia  was  balanced  in  both  arms  (0.4%  in  each).  None  of  the  subjects  with  grade  4 
neutropenia (Cd 2 subjects, Vd 2 subjects) also had an adverse event of sepsis.

Peripheral Neuropathy Adverse Events 
Study  2011-003  excluded  subjects  with  significant  neuropathy  at  baseline  (defined  as  grade  3  or  4 
neuropathy or grade 2 neuropathy with pain), but allowed subjects with low-grade peripheral neuropathy 
at  baseline  (grade  2  without  pain  or  grade  1)  to  enroll  because  of  the  high  prevalence  of  peripheral 
neuropathy in the multiple myeloma population. 
The cumulative subject incidence during the ENDEAVOR sNDA Safety Update was 20.1% (2.4% ≥ grade 
3) in the Cd arm and 52.6% (8.6% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm. Since the ENDEAVOR sNDA, no additional 
subjects  had  peripheral  neuropathy  adverse  events  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  carfilzomib  and  4

The  cumulative  subject  incidence  during  the  ENDEAVOR  120-day  Safety  Update  was  33.3%  (2.6%  ≥ 
grade 3) in the  Cd arm and 27.9% (2.2% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm.   Since  the ENDEAVOR sNDA, 3 
additional  subjects  in  the  Cd  arm  had  an  angioedema  adverse  event  that  led  to  discontinuation  of 
carfilzomib and there were no additional fatal adverse events. 
The most common adverse events in this category were peripheral edema (Cd 23.5%, Vd 18.4%) and 
edema (Cd 3.9%, Vd 4.6%.

hypophosphatemia was 6.7% (3.0% ≥ grade 3) in the Cd arm and 5.7% (1.1% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm.  
No subject in the Cd arm discontinued treatment due to one of these events, and no fatal adverse events 
were reported. 
Malignant or Unspecified Tumors 
Since  the  ENDEAVOR  sNDA,  no  malignant  or  unspecified  tumor  ADRs  were  identified.  Since  the 
ENDEAVOR sNDA, 1 additional subject in each treatment arm (Vd and Cd) had a malignant or unspecified 
tumor  in  Study  2011-003.  Therefore,  the  cumulative  subject  incidence  of  malignant  or  unspecified 
tumors during the ENDEAVOR 120-day Safety Update was 6.3% (4.1% ≥ grade 3) in the Cd arm and 
1.5% (1.3% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm. Since the ENDEAVOR sNDA, no additional malignant or unspecified 
tumor adverse events led to discontinuation of carfilzomib or bortezomib or were fatal.

Vital signs 
There were no notable differences in median values of heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate 
between the Cd and Vd arms at the measured time points in Study 2011-003. There are no additional 
analyses conducted for the ENDEAVOR 120-day Safety Update. 
Electrocardiograms 
Electrocardiograms were required for all subjects at baseline only in Study 2011-003. 
Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy and Lactation 
As of 30 June 2015, no pregnancies have been reported in subjects receiving carfilzomib. 
Overdose 
At the time of the safety update (30 June 2015) there was a cumulative total of 1 overdose and 6 
medication errors. The 1 overdose included a patient who received a high dose of carfilzomib in a clinical 
trial; however, no further details were provided. Two medication errors included administration of 
carfilzomib with saline.

Drug Abuse  
Carfilzomib has no known drug abuse or dependence potential. No signal for drug abuse has been 
identified in nonclinical studies of carfilzomib, and the pharmacology does not suggest that carfilzomib 
has the potential for abuse. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The drug-drug interaction potential of carfilzomib is expected to be low. Please refer to the discussion on 
Clinical Pharmacology/Non Clinical. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Table 34. Summary of Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Carfilzomib or Bortezomib in ≥ 1% of Subjects in any 
arm by Preferred Term (Safety Population; Study 2011-003) 
Post marketing experience 
Based on available marketing data, it is estimated that 20000 patients have been treated with the 
marketed prduct Kyprolis (carfilzomib) from the international birthdate 20 July 2012 through 10 July 
2015.  
As of 30 June 2015, the sponsor received a total of 11145 events in 3373 cases from worldwide sources 
from the international birthdate through 30 June 2015. Of these 11145 events, 8617 (77.3%) were 
non-serious and 2528 (22.7%) events were serious. Of the 3373 cases, 423 (12.5%) were fatal.  
The most commonly reported fatal events were plasma cell myeloma (159 events), disease progression 
(82 events), and “death” (81 events). 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/517040/2016  
Page 85/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The sponsor received a total of 2569 events in 632 cases from worldwide sources that were initially 
received during the interval period of 13 January 2015 through 30 January 2015. Of the 2569 events, 
1895 were non-serious and 674 were serious. Of the 632 cases, 76 (12%) were fatal. 
The most commonly reported fatal events were “death” (45 events, additional events reported in these 
cases included cardiac disorders, infections, progressive disease, cerebral hemorrhage, and renal failure) 
and disease progression (12 events). 
After a comprehensive review of the Clinical and Safety databases (including analysis of postmarketing 
safety reports cumulative through 26 May 2015), gastrointestinal perforation, pericardial effusion and 
pericarditis were added as new ADRs. 
Consideration of Long-term Safety of Carfilzomib 
To  assess  long-term  safety  of  study  treatment,  the  subject  incidence  of  overall  adverse  events  and 
serious adverse events were evaluated during sequential dosing periods of months 1 to 6, 7 to 12, 13 to 
18, 19 to 24, as well as after month 24, among subjects who received treatment in each period in Study 
2011-003. 
Based on the cumulative data in the ENDEAVOR 120-day Safety Update, subjects consistently received 
more treatment in the Cd arm compared with the Vd arm: 
• > 6 months: Cd 324 subjects (70.0%) and Vd 221 subjects (48.5%) 
• > 12 months: Cd 212 subjects (45.8%) and Vd 103 subjects (22.6%) 
• > 18 months: Cd 99 subjects (21.4%) and Vd 39 subjects (8.6%) 
• > 24 months: Cd 24 subjects (5.2%) and Vd 6 subjects (1.3%) 
The percentage of subjects who had an adverse event during a treatment period generally decreased with 
increasing  length  of  time  on  treatment  in  both  arms.  The  percentage  of  subjects  who  had  a  serious 
adverse  event  also  decreased  with  increasing  length  of  time  on  treatment  in  both  arms  (with  the 
exception of Vd at 13 to 18 months). 
There was  no trend towards increased subject incidence within the Cd and Vd arms of any individual 
serious  adverse  event  between  the  early  and  later  treatment  periods,  nor  was  there  an  increased 
difference in subject incidence of any individual serious adverse event between the 2 arms in the later 
treatment periods through month 24.  
The number of subjects who received treatment > month 24 was low (Cd: 24 subjects; Vd: 6 subjects). 
2.6.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety  data  of  the  current  application  is  mainly  based  on  results  from  the  Phase  3  Study  2011-003 
(ENDEAVOUR),  in  relapsed  Multiple  Myeloma  patients  in  which  Cd  (n=463)  was  compared  with  Vd 
(n=456).  
Overall, the carfilzomib safety database includes safety data from the ENDEAVOR study up to the data 
cut-off  date  of  30th  June  2015,  an  update  of  selected  ongoing  and  completed  studies  as  well  as  the 
postmarketing experience with carfilzomib.  
Following initial doses of carfilzomib at 20 mg/m2, the dose was increased to 27 mg/m2 in study PX 171 
009 and to 56 mg/m2 in study 2011 003. A cross-study comparison of the adverse reactions occurring in 
the  Kyprolis  and  dexamethasone  (Kd)  arm  of  study  2011  003  vs  the  Kyprolis,  lenalidomide  and

dexamethasone (KRd) arm of study PX 171 009 suggest that there may be a potential dose relationship 
for  the  following  adverse reactions:  cardiac  failure  (Kd  8.2%,  KRd  6.4%),  dyspnoea  (Kd  30.9%,  KRd 
22.7%), hypertension (Kd 25.9%, KRd 15.8%), and pulmonary hypertension (Kd 1.3%, KRd 0.8%). 
In  ENDEAVOR  study, more subjects in the Cd arm  (25.1%, 116 subjects) compared with the Vd arm 
(11.4%,  52  subjects)  remained  on  treatment.  The  median  duration  of  Carfilzomib  treatment  was  21 
weeks longer in the Cd arm (48.0 weeks and 12.0 cycles) than in the Vd arm (27.0 weeks and 8.0 cycles).  
A total of 919 (98.9%) subjects (463 in the Cd arm, 456 in the Vd arm) who received at least 1 dose of 
randomized treatment were included in the safety analysis. 
Subjects with at least 1 treatment-emergent AE was pretty similar between arms (99%). The most 
frequently reported events, were anemia (40.8%), diarrhea (33.5%), pyrexia (31.5%), fatigue (31.1%) 
and dyspnea (30.5%). Adverse events that occurred with a ≥ 5% higher subject incidence in the Cd arm 
relative to the Vd arm were anemia, peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, pyrexia, 
dyspnea, headache, bronchitis, hypertension, vomiting, muscle spasms, increased blood creatinine and 
decreased lymphocyte count. 
The percentage of AEs grade 3 was higher in the Cd arm (78.8% vs 69.3 Vd vs Cd respectively). AEs 
grade ≥3 more frequently reported in the Cd vs Vd were anemia (10% vs 16%), hypertension (3% vs 
13%), lymphocyte count decreased (2% vs 6%), dyspnea (2% vs 6%), lymphopenia (3% vs 5%), 
hypophosphatemia (1% vs 3%), pyrexia (1% vs 3%), bronchitis (1% vs 3%), and cardiac failure (1% vs 
2%) (Vd vs Cd, respectively). 
Regarding infections, the prolonged exposure to low-dose dexamethasone in study population may play 
a role in the increased risk of such events. 
The incidence of SAEs was 54.9% in the Cd arm and 38.4% in the Vd arm. In all subjects, pneumonia was 
the most commonly reported treatment-emergent SAE (Cd 7.8%, Vd 8.8%). Serious adverse events that 
occurred more frequently (i.e., a difference of ≥ 1% of subjects) in the Cd arm when compared with the 
Vd arm were dysphonia, pyrexia, pulmonary embolism, cardiac failure, bronchopneumonia, bronchitis, 
and plasmacytoma. 
A total of 75 subjects (27.4%) in the Cd arm and 90 patients (31.6%) in the Vd arm had died at the time 
of data cut-off. Infections and cardiac adverse events were the most frequent fatal adverse events in the 
Cd arm within 30 days after the last dose. 
The rate of discontinuation due to AEs was similar for Cd and Vd in each analysis of treatment 
discontinuation, with 25.3% in the Cd arm and 23.7% in the Vd arm discontinuing any treatment. The 
most common adverse events (≥ 1%) that led to discontinuation of carfilzomib were cardiac failure (Cd 
1.5%, Vd 0) and asthenia (Cd: 1.1%, Vd 0.4%). 
Anemia,  neutropenia,  and  thrombocytopenia  are  known  class  effects  of  proteasome  inhibitors  and 
immunomodulatory drugs.  The cumulative subject incidence of thrombocytopenia was 31.7% (12.1% ≥ 
grade 3) in the Cd arm and 26.1% (14.5% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm, the cumulative subject incidence of 
neutropenia was 21.8% (15.3% ≥ grade 3) in the Cd arm and 16.4% (8.6% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm and 
the cumulative subject incidence of anemia was 41.7% (15.8% ≥ grade 3) in the Cd arm and 28.1% 
(10.1% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm. 
The cumulative subject incidence if cardiac Arrhythmias was 17.3% (2.8% ≥ grade 3) in the Cd arm 
and 10.1% (4.4% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm. Torsades de pointes-QT prolongation (SMQB) occurred

in 1.9% of subjects in the Cd arm compared with 5.0% of subjects in the Vd arm. In the Cd arm, 
1.1% of subjects had events that were Grade 3 or higher versus 3.1% of subjects in the Vd arm. For 
both treatment groups, the most common event, of any grade, was syncope (1.1% Cd arm, 3.7% 
Vd arm). 
Cardiac Failure, the cumulative subject incidence was 8.6% (5.2% ≥ grade 3) in the Cd arm and 
3.3% (2.0% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm.   Cardiomyopathy, the cumulative subject incidence was 
3.5% (1.9% ≥ grade 3) in the Cd arm and 1.3% (0.4% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm.  Ischemic Heart 
Disease, the cumulative subject incidence was 3.0% (1.7% ≥ grade 3) in the Cd arm and 2.0% 
(1.5% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm.  
The cumulative subject incidence of gastrointestinal events was 59.8% (9.7% ≥ grade 3) in Cd arm 
and 65.1% (14.3% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm.  
Increased  ALT,  AST,  gamma-glutamyltransferase,  cholestasis,  hyperbilirubinemia,  and  hepatic  failure 
were previously identified as ADRs of carfilzomib. The cumulative subject incidence of Hepatic Failure, 
Fibrosis and Cirrhosis in ENDEAVOR trial was 2.6% (1.3% ≥ grade 3) in the Cd arm compare to 1.1% 
(0.2% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm. 
Bronchopneumonia and respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and preferred terms of sepsis and 
viral infections were previously identified as ADRs for carfilzomib. Lung infection has been included as a 
new  uncommon  AE  associated  to  use  of  carfilzomib  Furthermore  rhinitis  has  been  newly  identified 
adverse reaction (SmPC, section 4.8). 
Despite peripheral neuropathy is a known adverse event of proteasome inhibitors, cases of grade 2 and 
higher peripheral neuropathy were reported in 6% of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma in the Kd 
arm, compared with 32% in the Vd arm. 
The cumulative subject incidence was 20.1% (2.4% ≥  grade 3) in the Cd arm and 52.6% (8.6% ≥  grade 
3) in the Vd arm. The most common adverse events were peripheral neuropathy (Cd 9.9%, Vd 27.4%), 
peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (Cd  5.8%,  Vd  15.1%),  and  neuralgia  (Cd  2.2%,  Vd  15.4%).The 
cumulative subject incidence of Interstitial Lung Disease was 1.5% (1.3% ≥ grade 3) in the Cd arm and 
0.7% (0.4% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm.  
The cumulative subject incidence of Renal Adverse Events was 8.9% (4.8% ≥ grade 3) in the Cd arm and 
5.9% (3.3% ≥ grade 3) in the Vd arm. 
Cases of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with 
fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients who received Kyprolis. The overall incidence of venous 
thromboembolic events was higher in the Kyprolis arms of two phase  3 studies. In study PX  171 009 the 
incidence of venous thromboembolic events was 15.3% in the KRd arm and 9.0% in the Rd arm. 
Grade ≥ 3 venous thromboembolic events were reported in 5.6% of patients in the KRd arm and 3.9% of 
patients in the Rd arm. In study 2011 003 the incidence of venous thromboembolic events was 10.6% in 
the Kd arm and 3.1% in the bortezomib plus dexamethasone (Vd) arm. Grade ≥ 3 venous 
thromboembolic events were reported in 3.0% of patients in the Kd arm and 1.5% of patients in the Vd 
arm (SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8) Venous thromboembolic events has been classified as an identified risk 
in the Risk Management plan.

No critical amendments of the product information have been proposed and a user consultation is not 
considered needed. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Study 2011-003 (ENDEAVOUR) has provided convincing evidence of clinical efficacy of carfilzomib in 
combination with dexamethasone alone in terms of the primary endpoint PFS, compared to bortezomib 
plus dexamethasone, in adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior 
therapy with HR = 0.533 (p < 0.0001), based on 414 (79%) IRC-confirmed PFS events occurred (52% 
and 37% of events in Vd and Cd respectively). 
The robustness of the PFS effect is supported by sensitivity analyses (investigator, ORCA, next treatment, 
interim analysis and missing assessment) and by general consistency within subgroups including 
subgroups of special interest as prior bortezomib treatment (PFS HR 0.56 95%CI [0.436, 0.728]), prior 
lenalidomide (PFS HR 0.69 95%CI [0.516, 0.918]) and prior Imid and bortezomib (PFS HR 0.64 95%CI 
[0.473, 0.861]).  .  The secondary endpoints including response rate by IRC, the treatment with Cd 
provides a higher response (62.6% [58.0, 67.0] vs 76.9% [72.8, 80.7] Vd vs Cd respectively) and a 
deeper response (CR: 20 [4.3%] vs 50 [10.8%]; VGPR 104 [22.4%] vs 194 [41.8%]). The median 
duration of the response (both by IRC and investigator) was also significantly superior in the Cd arm (10.4 
months [9.3, 13.8] in Vd vs 21.3 months [21.3, NE] in Cd; IRC) (8.6 months [7.5, 10.2] in Vd vs 12.9 
months [10.2, 15.8] in Cd; Investigator). The median TTP according to IRC was longer in the Cd arm 
(22.2 months [95% CI: 17.7, NE]) than in the Vd arm (10.1 months [95% CI: 8.8, 11.7]). 
Regarding the clinical benefit rate and disease control rate by IRC, both support the superiority of the 
combination of carfilzomib ad dexamethasone (CBR: 81.9% vs 73.8% Cd vs Vd respectively) (DCR: 
90.5% vs 85.2%). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Based on the results of the first interim analysis a positive trend for Cd vs Vd (HR = 0.786; 95% CI:  
0.575, 1.075; p = 0.065) was observed for OS. This positive trend has been unchanged in a post hoc 
analysis carried out with 322 events (65% of total events required; HR 0.805  95%CI: 0.646, 1.003). 
Despite the fact that Cd is pointing out a clear trend in OS benefit, the data are not definitive. Additional

follow-up will further quantify the OS benefit of Cd over Vd (see discussion on clinical efficacy).  
Regarding the subgroup of patients who received bortezomib in the line just prior to randomization and 
had an interval relapse free of 6-12 months, there were not substantial differences between treatments 
(median PFS duration 6.5 months; 95% CI: 1.1, 17.5 in the Vd arm and 7.2 months (1.5, NE) in the Cd 
arm with HR=0.963; 95% CI: 0.32, 2.899) Nevertheless, the sample size of this subgroup is really low so 
as to draw conclusions about that. Of note, the ORR was 75% (6/8 subjects) in the Vd arm, and 42% 
(5/12 subjects) in the Cd arm. In those with an interval relapse >12 months, the benefit of Cd seems 
consistently higher than in those subjects treated with Vd 
In those patients refractory to any prior lenalidomide treatment the delay in the progression is less clear 
(PFS HR 0.80 95%CI [0.573, 1.110]) even though there seem to be a higher response in those treated 
with Cd than those treated with Vd (61.9% vs 54.9%). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
A total of 919 (98.9%) subjects (463 in the Cd arm, 456 in the Vd arm) who received at least 1 dose of 
randomized treatment were included in the safety analysis. 
Subjects with at least 1 treatment-emergent AE was pretty similar between arms (99%). The most 
frequently reported events, were anemia (40.8%), diarrhea (33.5%), pyrexia (31.5%), fatigue (31.1%) 
and dyspnea (30.5%). Adverse events that occurred with a ≥ 5% higher subject incidence in the Cd arm 
relative to the Vd arm were anemia, peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, pyrexia, 
dyspnea, headache, bronchitis, hypertension, vomiting, muscle spasms, increased blood creatinine and 
decreased lymphocyte count. 
The percentage of AEs grade 3 was higher in the Cd arm (78.8% vs 69.3 Vd vs Cd respectively). AEs 
grade ≥3 more frequently reported in the Cd vs Vd were anemia (10% vs 16%), hypertension (3% vs 
13%), lymphocyte count decreased (2% vs 6%), dyspnea (2% vs 6%), lymphopenia (3% vs 5%), 
hypophosphatemia (1% vs 3%), pyrexia (1% vs 3%), bronchitis (1% vs 3%), and cardiac failure (1% vs 
2%) (Vd vs Cd, respectively). 
Rhinitis and lung infection have been newly identified adverse events (SmPC) and have been added in the 
SmPC.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There are no important uncertainties in the knowledge of unfavourable effects.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The use of the treatment combination carfilzomib and dexamethasone provides a longer PFS (18.7 
months (95% CI: 15.6, NE) versus 9.4 months (95% CI: 8.4, 10.4) for bortezomib+dexamethasone, as 
a consequence of a higher antitumor activity. The ORR is higher and deeper than that obtained by Vd. This 
fact is in itself of clinical value, given that the regimen bortezomib and dexamethasone is one of the 
current regimens at relapse. Hence, a new available regimen better than Vd could mean a certain 
advantage. Moreover, when the results from the ENDEAVOUR study are indirectly compared to the 
available alternatives, only the triple combination KRd (carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone) seems 
superior. So, in those patients not candidates to receive that triplet, a new alternative as Cd would be 
valuable. 
Overall, there is a pattern of more frequent Grade 3/4 adverse events (78.8% vs 69.3 Vd vs Cd) and SAEs 
(54.9% vs 38.4 Vd vs Cd) in patients treated with Cd compared to those treated with Vd. 
Rhinitis and lung infection are added as newly identified ADRs on the PI. 
The rate of discontinuation due to AEs was similar for Cd and Vd in each analysis of treatment 
discontinuation, with 25.3% in the Cd arm and 23.7% in the Vd arm discontinuing any treatment. The 
most common adverse events (≥ 1%) that led to discontinuation of carfilzomib were cardiac failure (Cd 
1.5%, Vd 0) and asthenia (Cd: 1.1%, Vd 0.4%). 
Benefit-risk balance 
The  efficacy  of  carfilzomib  with  dexamethasone  alone  in  the  target  population  is  considered  clinically 
relevant and, in the view of the safety profile, the benefits are considered to outweigh the combined risks 
and uncertainties. Therefore, the benefit-risk balance is considered positive. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
At relapse, the choice of treatment in patients with MM depends on several factors, being the previous 
response and free relapse interval, two of the most important factors when it comes to deciding the best 
treatment alternative. Recently, the landscape of therapeutic armamentarium has been modified with the 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

introduction of several combinations (which includes either carfilzomib or panobinostat) even though, 
both lenalidomide and bortezomib are the basis for the decisions at relapse.  
The introduction of a new combination of carfilzomib (a proteasome inhibitor) and dexamethasone would 
be valuable from the clinical point of view, since not all patients are candidates to receive a triple 
combination. There is no doubt that the use of carfilzomib along with dexamethasone provides a longer 
delay in the progression of MM than the combination of bortezomib and dexamethasone. This benefit in 
terms of PFS (regardless of the method of analysis) could be related to the deeper response of patients 
treated with Cd, which hopefully could be eventually translated into a longer survival. Certainly, the 
recent combination of carfilzomib-lenalidomide and dexamethasone appears to be a better choice for 
those patients who are fit for it, but a better alternative to Vd in terms of efficacy with an acceptable 
tolerability and toxicity (treatment discontinuations due to an AE were similar) would be of interest in the 
relapse setting. 
The overall clinical benefit of the treatment has been demonstrated.

Extension of Indication to include new indication for Kyprolis to be used with either lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone or dexamethasone alone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who 
have received at least one prior therapy. 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet and 
the RMP (version 6.0) is updated in accordance. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) updated section 6.6 of the SmPC to include the 
option to administer Kyprolis in a 100 mL intravenous bag containing 5% glucose solution for injection in 
line with the extension of indication part of this variation.  
Furthermore the MAH took the opportunity to include some editorial changes and harmonisations in the 
PI and to update the information of local representatives for Croatia and Cyprus. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this group of variations. In particular the 
EPAR module "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

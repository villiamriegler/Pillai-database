CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Neupro is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe idiopathic Restless Legs 
Syndrome (RLS) in adults. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The dose recommendations made are in nominal dose. 
A single daily dose should be initiated at 1 mg/24 h. Depending on the individual patient response, the 
dose may be increased in weekly increments of 1 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 3 mg/24 h. The need 
for treatment continuation should be reconsidered every 6 months.  
Neupro is applied once a day. The patch should be applied at approximately the same time every day. 
The patch remains on the skin for 24 hours and will then be replaced by a new one at a different site of 
application.  
If the patient forgets to apply the patch at the usual time of the day or if the patch becomes detached, 
another patch should be applied for the remainder of the day.

Treatment discontinuation 
Neupro should be discontinued gradually. The daily dose should be reduced in steps of 1 mg/24 h with 
a dose reduction preferably every other day, until complete withdrawal of Neupro (see section 4.4). 
Following this procedure, rebound (worsening of symptoms beyond initial intensity after 
discontinuation of treatment) has not been observed. 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Adjustment of the dose is not necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Caution 
is advised when treating patients with severe hepatic impairment, which may result in lower rotigotine 
clearance. Rotigotine has not been investigated in this patient group. A dose reduction might be 
needed in case of worsening of the hepatic impairment.  
Renal impairment 
Adjustment of the dose is not necessary in patients with mild to severe renal impairment, including 
those requiring dialysis. Unexpected accumulation of rotigotine levels may also occur at acute 
worsening of renal function (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of rotigotine in children and adolescents have not yet been established. 
Currently available data are described in section 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be 
made. 
Method of administration 
Neupro is for transdermal use. 
The patch should be applied to clean, dry, intact healthy skin on the abdomen, thigh, hip, flank, 
shoulder, or upper arm. Reapplication to the same site within 14 days should be avoided. Neupro 
should not be placed on skin that is red, irritated or damaged (see section 4.4). 
Use and handling 
Each patch is packed in a sachet and should be applied directly after the sachet has been opened. One 
half of the release liner should be removed and the sticky side should be applied and pressed firmly to 
the skin. Then, the patch is fold back and the second part of the release liner is removed. The sticky 
side of the patch should not be touched. The patch should be pressed down firmly with the palm of the 
hand for about 30 seconds, so that it sticks well. 
The patch should not be cut into pieces. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Magnetic resonance imaging or cardioversion (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Magnetic resonance imaging and cardioversion 
The backing layer of Neupro contains aluminium. To avoid skin burns, Neupro should be removed if 
the patient has to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cardioversion.

Orthostatic hypotension 
Dopamine agonists are known to impair the systemic regulation of the blood pressure resulting in 
postural/orthostatic hypotension. These events have also been observed during treatment with 
rotigotine, but the incidence was similar to that observed in placebo-treated patients. 
It is recommended to monitor blood pressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the 
general risk of orthostatic hypotension associated with dopaminergic therapy. 
Syncope 
In clinical studies with rotigotine, syncope has been observed at a rate that was similar to that observed 
in patients treated with placebo. Because patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease were 
excluded in these studies, patients with severe cardiovascular disease should be asked about symptoms 
of syncope and pre-syncope. 
Sudden onset of sleep and somnolence 
Rotigotine has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset. Sudden onset of 
sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness of any warning signs, has been reported. 
Prescribers should continually reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, as patients may not 
acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned. A reduction of dosage or termination 
of therapy should be carefully considered.  
Impulse control and other related disorders  
Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders and related 
disorders including dopamine dysregulation syndrome. Patients and carers should be made aware that 
behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including pathologic gambling, increased libido, 
hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in 
patients treated with dopamine agonists, including rotigotine. In some patients, dopamine 
dysregulation syndrome was observed under the treatment with rotigotine. Dose reduction/tapered 
discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop. 
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome 
Symptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal 
of dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended to taper treatment (see section 4.2). 
Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome 
Symptoms suggestive of dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (for example, pain, fatigue, 
depression, sweating, and anxiety) have been reported with abrupt withdrawal of dopaminergic 
therapy, therefore, it is recommended to taper treatment (see section 4.2). 
Abnormal thinking and behaviour 
Abnormal thinking and behaviour have been reported and can consist of a variety of manifestations 
including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behaviour, 
disorientation, aggressive behaviour, agitation, and delirium. 
Fibrotic complications 
Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, 
pericarditis and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived 
dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when treatment is discontinued, 
complete resolution does not always occur. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these 
compounds, whether other, nonergot derived dopamine agonists can cause them is unknown. 
Neuroleptics 
Neuroleptics given as antiemetic should not be given to patients taking dopamine agonists (see also 
section 4.5). 
Ophthalmologic monitoring 
Ophthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur. 
Heat application 
External heat (excessive sunlight, heating pads and other sources of heat such as sauna, hot bath) 
should not be applied to the area of the patch. 
Application site reactions 
Application site skin reactions may occur and are usually mild or moderate in intensity. It is 
recommended that the application site should be rotated on a daily basis (e.g. from the right side to the 
left side and from the upper body to the lower body). The same site should not be used within 14 days. 
If application site reactions occur which last for more than a few days or are persistent, if there is an 
increase in severity, or if the skin reaction spreads outside the application site, an assessment of the 
risk/benefit balance for the individual patient should be conducted. 
If there is a skin rash or irritation from the transdermal system, direct sunlight on the area should be 
avoided until the skin heals, as exposure could lead to changes in the skin color. 
If a generalised skin reaction (e.g. allergic rash, including erythematous, macular, papular rash or 
pruritus) associated with the use of Neupro is observed, Neupro should be discontinued. 
Peripheral oedema 
Peripheral oedema has been observed in clinical trials conducted in patients with RLS. 
Augmentation 
Augmentation may occur. Augmentation refers to the earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or 
even the afternoon), increase in severity of symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other body 
parts. In long-term clinical studies with rotigotine, the majority of augmentation episodes were seen in 
the first and second years of treatment. Doses higher than the approved dose range for RLS should be 
avoided as this may lead to higher rates of augmentation (see section 5.1). 
Sulphite sensitivity 
Neupro contains sodium metabisulphite, a sulphite that may cause allergic-type reactions including 
anaphylactic symptoms and life threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible 
people. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Because rotigotine is a dopamine agonist, it is assumed that dopamine antagonists, such as 
neuroleptics (e.g. phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish 
the effectiveness of Neupro, and co-administration should be avoided. Because of possible additive 
effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking sedating medicinal products or other CNS 
(central nervous system) depressants (e.g. benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants) or alcohol 
in combination with rotigotine. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Co-administration of L-dopa and carbidopa with rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
rotigotine, and rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of L-dopa and carbidopa. 
Co-administration of domperidone with rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rotigotine.  
Co-administration of omeprazole (inhibitor of CYP2C19), in doses of 40 mg/day, had no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics and metabolism of rotigotine in healthy volunteers. 
Co-administration of rotigotine (3 mg/24 h) did not affect the pharmacodynamics and 
pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (0.03 mg ethinylestradiol, 0.15 mg levonorgestrel).  
Interactions with other forms of hormonal contraception have not been investigated. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential, contraception in females 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception to prevent pregnancy during 
treatment with rotigotine. 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of rotigotine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not 
indicate any teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, but embryo-toxicity was observed in rats and mice 
at materno-toxic doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Rotigotine should 
not be used during pregnancy.  
Breast-feeding 
Because rotigotine decreases prolactin secretion in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected. Studies 
in rats have shown that rotigotine and/or its metabolite(s) are excreted in breast milk. In the absence of 
human data, breast-feeding should be discontinued. 
Fertility 
For information on fertility studies, please see section 5.3. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Rotigotine may have major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Patients being treated with rotigotine and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes 
must be informed not to drive or engage in activities (e.g. operating machines) where impaired 
alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death until such recurrent episodes 
and somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials comprising a total of 748 Neupro- 
and 214 placebo-treated patients, 65.5% of the patients on Neupro and 33.2% of patients on placebo 
reported at least one adverse reaction. 
At the beginning of therapy dopaminergic adverse reactions such as nausea and vomiting may occur. 
These are usually mild or moderate in intensity and transient even if treatment is continued. 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in more than 10% of patients treated with Neupro are nausea, 
application site reactions, asthenic conditions and headache. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In trials where the application sites were rotated as reflected in the instructions provided in the SmPC 
and package leaflet, 34.2% of 748 patients using Neupro, experienced application site reactions. The 
majority of application site reactions were mild or moderate in intensity, limited to the application 
areas and resulted in discontinuation of Neupro in 7.2% of subjects. 
Discontinuation rate 
The discontinuation rate was studied in 3 clinical trials ranging up to 3 years in duration. The 
percentage of subjects discontinuing was 25-38% over the first year, 10% in the second year, and 11% 
in the third year. Periodic assessment of efficacy should be performed, along with evaluation of safety, 
including augmentation. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following table covers adverse drug reactions from the pooled studies mentioned above in patients 
with Restless Legs Syndrome and from post-marketing experience. Within the system organ classes, 
adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of patients expected to experience 
the reaction), using the following categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are 
presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Rotigotine has been associated with somnolence including excessive daytime somnolence and sudden 
sleep onset episodes. In isolated cases “sudden onset of sleep” occurred while driving and resulted in 
motor vehicle accidents (see also sections 4.4 and 4.7). 
Impulse control disorders 
Pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating 
and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists, including rotigotine (see 
section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
The most likely adverse reactions would be those related to the pharmacodynamic profile of a 
dopamine agonist, including nausea, vomiting, hypotension, involuntary movements, hallucinations, 
confusion, convulsions and other signs of central dopaminergic stimulation.

Management 
There is no known antidote for overdose of dopamine agonists. In case of suspected overdose, removal 
of the patch(es) should be considered because after removal of the patch(es) the active substance input 
is stopped and the plasma concentration of rotigotine decreases rapidly. The patient should be 
monitored closely, including heart rate, heart rhythm and blood pressure.  
Treatment of overdose may require general supportive measures to maintain the vital signs. Dialysis 
would not be expected to be beneficial as rotigotine is not eliminated by dialysis. 
If it is necessary to discontinue rotigotine, this should be done gradually to prevent neuroleptic 
malignant syndrome. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-parkinson drugs, dopamine agonists; ATC code: N04BC09 
Rotigotine is a non-ergolinic dopamine agonist for the treatment of signs and symptoms of Parkinson’s 
disease and Restless Legs Syndrome.  
Mechanism of action 
Rotigotine is believed to elicit its beneficial effect on Parkinson’s disease by activation of the D3, D2 
and D1 receptors of the caudate-putamen in the brain. 
The precise mechanism of action of rotigotine as a treatment of RLS is unknown. It is thought that 
rotigotine may exert its activity mainly via dopamine receptors. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Regarding the functional activity at the various receptor subtypes and their distribution in the brain, 
rotigotine is a D2 and D3 receptor agonist acting also on D1, D4 and D5 receptors. With non-
dopaminergic receptors, rotigotine showed antagonism at alpha2B and agonism at 5HT1A receptors, 
but no activity on the 5HT2B receptor.  
Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of rotigotine was evaluated in 5 placebo-controlled trials with more than 1,400 patients 
with idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). Efficacy was demonstrated in controlled trials in 
patients treated for up to 29 weeks.  The effect was maintained over a 6 months period.  
The changes from baseline in the International RLS Rating Scale (IRLS) and CGI-item 1 (severity of 
illness) were primary efficacy parameters. For both primary endpoints statistically significant 
differences have been observed for the doses 1 mg/24 h, 2 mg/24 h and 3 mg/24 h in comparison to 
placebo. After 6 months of maintenance treatment in patients with moderate to severe RLS, the 
baseline IRLS score improved from 30.7 to 20.7 for placebo and from 30.2 to 13.8 for rotigotine. The 
adjusted mean difference was -6.5 points (CI95% -8.7; -4.4, p <0.0001). CGI-I responder rates (much 
improved, very much improved) were 43.0% and 67.5% for placebo and rotigotine respectively 
(difference 24.5% CI 95%: 14.2%; 34.8%, p<0.0001). 
In a placebo-controlled, 7-week trial polysomnographic parameters were investigated. Rotigotine 
significantly reduced the periodic limb movement index (PLMI) from 50.9 to 7.7 versus 37.4 to 32.7 
for placebo (p<0.0001). 
Augmentation 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In two 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, clinically relevant augmentation was 
observed in 1.5% of rotigotine-treated patients versus 0.5% of placebo treated patients. In two open-
label, follow-up studies over a subsequent 12 months, the rate of clinically relevant augmentation was 
2.9%. None of these patients discontinued therapy because of augmentation. In a 5-year open-label 
treatment study, augmentation occurred in 11.9% of patients treated with the approved dosages for 
RLS (1-3 mg/24 h), and 5.1% were considered clinically significant. In this study, the majority of 
augmentation episodes occurred in the first and second years of treatment. Furthermore, in this study a 
higher dose of 4 mg/24 h that is unapproved in RLS was also used and led to higher rates of 
augmentation. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following application, rotigotine is continuously released from the transdermal patch and absorbed 
through the skin. Steady-state concentrations are reached after one to two days of patch application 
and are maintained at a stable level by once daily application in which the patch is worn for 24 hours. 
Rotigotine plasma concentrations increase dose-proportionally over a dose range of 1 mg/24 h to 
24 mg/24 h. 
Approximately 45% of the active substance within the patch is released to the skin in 24 hours. The 
absolute bioavailability after transdermal application is approximately 37%. 
Rotating the site of patch application may result in day-to-day differences in plasma levels. 
Differences in bioavailability of rotigotine ranged from 2% (upper arm versus flank) to 46% (shoulder 
versus thigh). However, there is no indication of a relevant impact on the clinical outcome. 
Distribution 
The in vitro binding of rotigotine to plasma proteins is approximately 92%. 
The apparent volume of distribution in humans is approximately 84 l/kg. 
Biotransformation 
Rotigotine is metabolised to a great extent. Rotigotine is metabolised by N-dealkylation as well as 
direct and secondary conjugation. In vitro results indicate that different CYP isoforms are able to 
catalyse the N-dealkylation of rotigotine. Main metabolites are sulfates and glucuronide conjugates of 
the parent compound as well as N-desalkyl-metabolites, which are biologically inactive. 
The information on metabolites is incomplete. 
Elimination 
Approximately 71% of the rotigotine dose is excreted in urine and a smaller part of about 23% is 
excreted in faeces. 
The clearance of rotigotine after transdermal administration is approximately 10 l/min and its overall 
elimination half-life is 5 to 7 hours. The pharmacokinetic profile shows a biphasic elimination with an 
initial half-life of about 2 to 3 hours. 
Because the patch is administered transdermally, no effect of food and gastrointestinal conditions is 
expected. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special patient groups 
Because therapy with Neupro is initiated at a low dose and gradually titrated according to clinical 
tolerability to obtain the optimum therapeutic effect, adjustment of the dose based on gender, weight, 
or age is not necessary. 
Hepatic and renal impairment 
In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment or mild to severe renal impairment, no relevant 
increases of rotigotine plasma levels were observed. Neupro was not investigated in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment.  
Plasma levels of conjugates of rotigotine and its desalkyl metabolites increase with impaired renal 
function. However, a contribution of these metabolites to clinical effects is unlikely. 
Paediatric population 
Limited pharmacokinetic data obtained in adolescent patients with RLS (13-17 years, n=24) following 
treatment with multiple doses of 0.5 to 3mg/24h showed that systemic exposure to rotigotine was 
similar to that observed in adults. Efficacy/safety data is insufficient to establish a relation between 
exposure and response (see also paediatric information in section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In repeated dose and long-term toxicity studies, the major effects were associated with the dopamine 
agonist related pharmacodynamic effects and the consequent decrease of prolactin secretion.  
After a single dose of rotigotine, binding to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes) in the pigmented rat 
and monkey was evident, but was slowly cleared over the 14-day observation period. 
Retinal degeneration was observed by transmission microscopy at a dose equivalent to 2.8 times the 
maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m² basis in a 3-month study in albino rats. The effects 
were more pronounced in female rats. Additional studies to further evaluate the specific pathology 
have not been performed. Retinal degeneration was not observed during the routine histopathological 
evaluation of the eyes in any of the toxicology studies in any species used. The relevance of these 
findings to humans is not known. 
In a carcinogenicity study, male rats developed Leydig cell tumours and hyperplasia. Malignant 
tumours were noted predominantly in the uterus of mid- and high-dose females. These changes are 
well-known effects of dopamine agonists in rats after life-long therapy and assessed as not relevant to 
man. 
The effects of rotigotine on reproduction have been investigated in rats, rabbits and mice. Rotigotine 
was not teratogenic in all three species, but was embryotoxic in rats and mice at materno-toxic doses. 
Rotigotine did not influence male fertility in rats, but clearly reduced female fertility in rats and mice, 
because of the effects on prolactin levels which are particularly significant in rodents. 
Rotigotine did not induce gene mutations in the Ames test, but did show effects in the in vitro Mouse 
Lymphoma Assay with metabolic activation and weaker effects without metabolic activation. This 
mutagenic effect could be attributed to a clastogenic effect of rotigotine. This effect was not confirmed 
in vivo in the Mouse Micronucleus Test in the rat Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) test. Since it 
ran more or less parallel with a decreased relative total growth of the cells, it may be related to a 
cytotoxic effect of the compound. Therefore, the relevance of the one positive in vitro mutagenicity 
test is not known.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Restless Legs Syndrome 
Neupro is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe idiopathic Restless Legs 
Syndrome (RLS) in adults. 
Parkinson’s disease 
Neupro is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of early-stage idiopathic Parkinson’s 
disease as monotherapy (i.e. without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i.e. over the course 
of the disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent 
and fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or ‘on-off’ fluctuations). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The dose recommendations made are in nominal dose. 
Restless Legs Syndrome 
A single daily dose should be initiated at 1 mg/24 h. Depending on the individual patient response, the 
dose may be increased in weekly increments of 1 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 3 mg/24 h. The need 
for treatment continuation should be reconsidered every 6 months.  
Parkinson’s disease 
Dosing in patients with early-stage Parkinson’s disease: 
A single daily dose should be initiated at 2 mg/24 h and then increased in weekly increments of 
2 mg/24 h to an effective dose up to a maximum dose of 8 mg/24 h. 
4 mg/24 h may be an effective dose in some patients. For most patients an effective dose is reached 
within 3 or 4 weeks at doses of 6 mg/24 h or 8 mg/24 h, respectively. 
The maximum dose is 8 mg/24 h. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dosing in patients with advanced stage Parkinson’s disease with fluctuations: 
A single daily dose should be initiated at 4 mg/24 h and then increased in weekly increments of 
2 mg/24 h to an effective dose up to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h. 
4 mg/24 h or 6 mg/24 h may be effective doses in some patients. For most patients an effective dose is 
reached within 3 to 7 weeks at doses of 8 mg/24 h up to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h. 
For doses higher than 8 mg/24 h multiple patches may be used to achieve the final dose e.g. 
10 mg/24 h may be reached by combination of a 6 mg/24 h and a 4 mg/24 h patch.  
Neupro is applied once a day. The patch should be applied at approximately the same time every day. 
The patch remains on the skin for 24 hours and will then be replaced by a new one at a different site of 
application.  
If the patient forgets to apply the patch at the usual time of the day or if the patch becomes detached, 
another patch should be applied for the remainder of the day. 
Treatment discontinuation 
Restless Legs Syndrome 
Neupro should be discontinued gradually. The daily dose should be reduced in steps of 1 mg/24 h with 
a dose reduction preferably every other day, until complete withdrawal of Neupro (see section 4.4). 
Following this procedure, rebound (worsening of symptoms beyond initial intensity after 
discontinuation of treatment) has not been observed. 
Parkinson’s disease 
Neupro should be discontinued gradually. The daily dose should be reduced in steps of 2 mg/24 h with 
a dose reduction preferably every other day, until complete withdrawal of Neupro (see section 4.4). 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Adjustment of the dose is not necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Caution 
is advised when treating patients with severe hepatic impairment, which may result in lower rotigotine 
clearance. Rotigotine has not been investigated in this patient group. A dose reduction might be 
needed in case of worsening of the hepatic impairment.  
Renal impairment 
Adjustment of the dose is not necessary in patients with mild to severe renal impairment, including 
those requiring dialysis. Unexpected accumulation of rotigotine levels may also occur at acute 
worsening of renal function (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of rotigotine in children and adolescents have not yet been established. 
Currently available data are described in section 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology in children 
with RLS can be made. 
There is no relevant use of Neupro in the paediatric population in Parkinson’s disease. 
Method of administration 
Neupro is for transdermal use. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The patch should be applied to clean, dry, intact healthy skin on the abdomen, thigh, hip, flank, 
shoulder, or upper arm. Reapplication to the same site within 14 days should be avoided. Neupro 
should not be placed on skin that is red, irritated or damaged (see section 4.4). 
Use and handling 
Each patch is packed in a sachet and should be applied directly after the sachet has been opened. One 
half of the release liner should be removed and the sticky side should be applied and pressed firmly to 
the skin. Then, the patch is fold back and the second part of the release liner is removed. The sticky 
side of the patch should not be touched. The patch should be pressed down firmly with the palm of the 
hand for about 30 seconds, so that it sticks well. 
The patch should not be cut into pieces. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Magnetic resonance imaging or cardioversion (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
If a Parkinson’s disease patient is insufficiently controlled while on treatment with rotigotine 
switching to another dopamine agonist might provide additional benefit (see section 5.1) 
Both indications: 
Magnetic resonance imaging and cardioversion 
The backing layer of Neupro contains aluminium. To avoid skin burns, Neupro should be removed if 
the patient has to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cardioversion. 
Orthostatic hypotension 
Dopamine agonists are known to impair the systemic regulation of the blood pressure resulting in 
postural/orthostatic hypotension. These events have also been observed during treatment with 
rotigotine, but the incidence was similar to that observed in placebo-treated patients. 
It is recommended to monitor blood pressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the 
general risk of orthostatic hypotension associated with dopaminergic therapy. 
Syncope 
In clinical studies with rotigotine, syncope has been observed at a rate that was similar to that observed 
in patients treated with placebo. Because patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease were 
excluded in these studies, patients with severe cardiovascular disease should be asked about symptoms 
of syncope and pre-syncope. 
Sudden onset of sleep and somnolence 
Rotigotine has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset. Sudden onset of 
sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness of any warning signs, has been reported. 
Prescribers should continually reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, as patients may not 
acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned. A reduction of dosage or termination 
of therapy should be carefully considered.  
Impulse control and other related disorders 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders and related 
disorders including dopamine dysregulation syndrome. Patients and carers should be made aware that 
behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including pathologic gambling, increased libido, 
hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in 
patients treated with dopamine agonists, including rotigotine. In some patients, dopamine 
dysregulation syndrome was observed under the treatment with rotigotine. Dose reduction/tapered 
discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop. 
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome 
Symptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal 
of dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended to taper treatment (see section 4.2). 
Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome 
Symptoms suggestive of dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (for example, pain, fatigue, 
depression, sweating, and anxiety) have been reported with abrupt withdrawal of dopaminergic 
therapy, therefore, it is recommended to taper treatment (see section 4.2). 
Abnormal thinking and behaviour 
Abnormal thinking and behaviour have been reported and can consist of a variety of manifestations 
including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behaviour, 
disorientation, aggressive behaviour, agitation, and delirium. 
Fibrotic complications 
Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, 
pericarditis and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived 
dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when treatment is discontinued, 
complete resolution does not always occur. 
Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these 
compounds, whether other, nonergot derived dopamine agonists can cause them is unknown. 
Neuroleptics 
Neuroleptics given as antiemetic should not be given to patients taking dopamine agonists (see also 
section 4.5). 
Ophthalmologic monitoring 
Ophthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur. 
Heat application 
External heat (excessive sunlight, heating pads and other sources of heat such as sauna, hot bath) 
should not be applied to the area of the patch. 
Application site reactions 
Application site skin reactions may occur and are usually mild or moderate in intensity. It is 
recommended that the application site should be rotated on a daily basis (e.g. from the right side to the 
left side and from the upper body to the lower body). The same site should not be used within 14 days. 
If application site reactions occur which last for more than a few days or are persistent, if there is an 
increase in severity, or if the skin reaction spreads outside the application site, an assessment of the 
risk/benefit balance for the individual patient should be conducted. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If there is a skin rash or irritation from the transdermal system, direct sunlight on the area should be 
avoided until the skin heals, as exposure could lead to changes in the skin color. 
If a generalised skin reaction (e.g. allergic rash, including erythematous, macular, papular rash or 
pruritus) associated with the use of Neupro is observed, Neupro should be discontinued. 
Peripheral oedema 
In clinical studies in Parkinson’s patients, the 6 month-specific rates of peripheral oedema remained at 
about 4% through the entire observation period up to 36 months. Peripheral oedema has also been 
observed in clinical trials conducted in patients with RLS. 
Sulphite sensitivity 
Neupro contains sodium metabisulphite, a sulphite that may cause allergic-type reactions including 
anaphylactic symptoms and life threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible 
people. 
Observed in patients with Parkinson’s disease 
Dopaminergic adverse reactions 
The incidence of some dopaminergic adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, dyskinesia, and 
peripheral oedema generally is higher when given in combination with L-dopa in Parkinson’s patients. 
This should be considered when prescribing rotigotine. 
Dystonic reactions 
Dystonic reactions including dystonia, abnormal posture, torticollis and pleurothotonus (Pisa 
Syndrome) have occasionally been reported in patients with Parkinson’s disease following initiation or 
incremental dose increase of rotigotine. Although dystonic reactions may be a symptom of Parkinson’s 
disease, the symptoms in some of these patients have improved after reduction or withdrawal of 
rotigotine. If a dystonic reaction occurs, the dopaminergic medication regimen should be reviewed and 
an adjustment in the dose of rotigotine considered.  
Observed in patients with Restless Legs Syndrome 
Augmentation 
Augmentation may occur in Restless Legs Syndrome patients. Augmentation refers to the earlier onset 
of symptoms in the evening (or even the afternoon), increase in severity of symptoms, and spread of 
symptoms to involve other body parts. In long-term clinical studies with rotigotine, the majority of 
augmentation episodes were seen in the first and second years of treatment. Doses higher than the 
approved dose range for RLS should be avoided as this may lead to higher rates of augmentation (see 
section 5.1). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Because rotigotine is a dopamine agonist, it is assumed that dopamine antagonists, such as 
neuroleptics (e.g. phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish 
the effectiveness of Neupro, and co-administration should be avoided. Because of possible additive 
effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking sedating medicinal products or other CNS 
(central nervous system) depressants (e.g. benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants) or alcohol 
in combination with rotigotine. 
Co-administration of L-dopa and carbidopa with rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
rotigotine, and rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of L-dopa and carbidopa. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Co-administration of domperidone with rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rotigotine.  
Co-administration of omeprazole (inhibitor of CYP2C19), in doses of 40 mg/day, had no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics and metabolism of rotigotine in healthy volunteers. 
Neupro may potentiate the dopaminergic adverse reaction of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate 
pre-existing dyskinesia, as described with other dopamine agonists. 
Co-administration of rotigotine (3 mg/24 h) did not affect the pharmacodynamics and 
pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (0.03 mg ethinylestradiol, 0.15 mg levonorgestrel).  
Interactions with other forms of hormonal contraception have not been investigated. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential, contraception in females 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception to prevent pregnancy during 
treatment with rotigotine. 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of rotigotine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not 
indicate any teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, but embryo-toxicity was observed in rats and mice 
at materno-toxic doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Rotigotine should 
not be used during pregnancy.  
Breast-feeding 
Because rotigotine decreases prolactin secretion in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected. Studies 
in rats have shown that rotigotine and/or its metabolite(s) are excreted in breast milk. In the absence of 
human data, breast-feeding should be discontinued. 
Fertility 
For information on fertility studies, please see section 5.3. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Rotigotine may have major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Patients being treated with rotigotine and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes 
must be informed not to drive or engage in activities (e.g. operating machines) where impaired 
alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death until such recurrent episodes 
and somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Restless Legs Syndrome 
Summary of the safety profile 
Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials comprising a total of 748 Neupro- 
and 214 placebo-treated patients, 65.5% of the patients on Neupro and 33.2% of patients on placebo 
reported at least one adverse reaction. 
At the beginning of therapy dopaminergic adverse reactions such as nausea and vomiting may occur. 
These are usually mild or moderate in intensity and transient even if treatment is continued. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in more than 10% of patients treated with Neupro are nausea, 
application site reactions, asthenic conditions and headache. 
In trials where the application sites were rotated as reflected in the instructions provided in the SmPC 
and package leaflet, 34.2% of 748 patients using Neupro, experienced application site reactions. The 
majority of application site reactions were mild or moderate in intensity, limited to the application 
areas and resulted in discontinuation of Neupro in 7.2% of subjects. 
Discontinuation rate 
The discontinuation rate was studied in 3 clinical trials ranging up to 3 years in duration. The 
percentage of subjects discontinuing was 25-38% over the first year, 10% in the second year, and 11% 
in the third year. Periodic assessment of efficacy should be performed, along with evaluation of safety, 
including augmentation. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following table covers adverse drug reactions from the pooled studies mentioned above in patients 
with Restless Legs Syndrome and from post-marketing experience. Within the system organ classes, 
adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of patients expected to experience

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Sudden onset of sleep and somnolence 
Rhabdomyolysisc 
Rotigotine has been associated with somnolence including excessive daytime somnolence and sudden 
sleep onset episodes. In isolated cases “sudden onset of sleep” occurred while driving and resulted in 
motor vehicle accidents (see also sections 4.4 and 4.7). 
Impulse control disorders 
Pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating 
and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists, including rotigotine (see 
section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
The most likely adverse reactions would be those related to the pharmacodynamic profile of a 
dopamine agonist, including nausea, vomiting, hypotension, involuntary movements, hallucinations, 
confusion, convulsions and other signs of central dopaminergic stimulation. 
Management 
There is no known antidote for overdose of dopamine agonists. In case of suspected overdose, removal 
of the patch(es) should be considered because after removal of the patch(es) the active substance input 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is stopped and the plasma concentration of rotigotine decreases rapidly. The patient should be 
monitored closely, including heart rate, heart rhythm and blood pressure.  
Treatment of overdose may require general supportive measures to maintain the vital signs. Dialysis 
would not be expected to be beneficial as rotigotine is not eliminated by dialysis. 
If it is necessary to discontinue rotigotine, this should be done gradually to prevent neuroleptic 
malignant syndrome.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-parkinson drugs, dopamine agonists; ATC code: N04BC09 
Rotigotine is a non-ergolinic dopamine agonist for the treatment of signs and symptoms of Parkinson’s 
disease and Restless Legs Syndrome.  
Mechanism of action 
Rotigotine is believed to elicit its beneficial effect on Parkinson’s disease by activation of the D3, D2 
and D1 receptors of the caudate-putamen in the brain. 
The precise mechanism of action of rotigotine as a treatment of RLS is unknown. It is thought that 
rotigotine may exert its activity mainly via dopamine receptors. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Regarding the functional activity at the various receptor subtypes and their distribution in the brain, 
rotigotine is a D2 and D3 receptor agonist acting also on D1, D4 and D5 receptors. With non-
dopaminergic receptors, rotigotine showed antagonism at alpha2B and agonism at 5HT1A receptors, 
but no activity on the 5HT2B receptor.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Clinical studies in Restless Legs Syndrome 
The efficacy of rotigotine was evaluated in 5 placebo-controlled trials with more than 1,400 patients 
with idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). Efficacy was demonstrated in controlled trials in 
patients treated for up to 29 weeks. The effect was maintained over a 6 months period.  
The changes from baseline in the International RLS Rating Scale (IRLS) and CGI-item 1 (severity of 
illness) were primary efficacy parameters. For both primary endpoints statistically significant 
differences have been observed for the doses 1 mg/24 h, 2 mg/24 h and 3 mg/24 h in comparison to 
placebo. After 6 months of maintenance treatment in patients with moderate to severe RLS, the 
baseline IRLS score improved from 30.7 to 20.7 for placebo and from 30.2 to 13.8 for rotigotine. The 
adjusted mean difference was -6.5 points (CI95% -8.7; -4.4, p <0.0001). CGI-I responder rates (much 
improved, very much improved) were 43.0% and 67.5% for placebo and rotigotine respectively 
(difference 24.5% CI 95%: 14.2%; 34.8%, p<0.0001). 
In a placebo-controlled, 7-week trial polysomnographic parameters were investigated. Rotigotine 
significantly reduced the periodic limb movement index (PLMI) from 50.9 to 7.7 versus 37.4 to 32.7 
for placebo (p<0.0001). 
Augmentation 
In two 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, clinically relevant augmentation was 
observed in 1.5% of rotigotine-treated patients versus 0.5% of placebo treated patients. In two open-
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
label, follow-up studies over a subsequent 12 months, the rate of clinically relevant augmentation was 
2.9%. None of these patients discontinued therapy because of augmentation. In a 5-year open-label 
treatment study, augmentation occurred in 11.9% of patients treated with the approved dosages for 
RLS (1-3 mg/24 h), and 5.1% were considered clinically significant. In this study, the majority of 
augmentation episodes occurred in the first and second years of treatment. Furthermore, in this study a 
higher dose of 4 mg/24 h that is unapproved in RLS was also used and led to higher rates of 
augmentation. 
Clinical studies in Parkinson’s disease 
The effectiveness of rotigotine in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's 
disease was evaluated in a multinational drug development program consisting of four pivotal, 
parallel, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled studies and three studies investigating specific 
aspects of Parkinson’s disease. 
Two pivotal trials (SP512 Part I and SP513 Part I) investigating the effectiveness of rotigotine in 
the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease were conducted in patients 
who were not receiving concomitant dopamine agonist therapy and were either L-dopa naïve or 
previous L-dopa treatment was ≤ 6 months. The primary outcome assessment was the score for the 
Activities of Daily Living (ADL) component (Part II) plus the Motor Examination component (Part 
III) of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Efficacy was determined by the 
subject’s response to therapy in terms of responder and absolute points improvement in the scores of 
ADL and Motor Examination combined (UPDRS part II+III). 
In the double blind study SP512 Part I, 177 patients received rotigotine and 96 patients received 
placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine or placebo in weekly increments 
of 2 mg/24 h starting at 2 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 6 mg/24 h. Patients in each treatment group 
were maintained at their optimal dose for 6 months. 
At the end of the maintenance treatment in 91% of the subjects in the rotigotine arm, the optimal dose 
was the maximal dose allowed i.e. 6 mg/24 h. An improvement of 20% was seen in 48% of the 
subjects receiving rotigotine and in 19% of the subjects receiving placebo (Difference 29%, CI95% 
18%; 39%, p<0.0001). With rotigotine, the mean improvement in the UPDRS score (Parts II + III) was 
-3.98 points (baseline 29.9 points) whereas in the placebo-treated arm a worsening of 1.31 points was 
observed (baseline 30.0 points). The difference was 5.28 points and statistically significant 
(p<0.0001).   
In the double-blind study SP513 Part I, 213 patients received rotigotine, 227 received ropinirole and 
117 patients received placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine in weekly 
increments of 2 mg/24 h starting at 2 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 8 mg/24 h over 4 weeks. In the 
ropinirole group, patients were titrated to their optimal dose up to a maximum of 24 mg/day over 13 
weeks. Patients in each treatment group were maintained for 6 months. 
At the end of the maintenance treatment in 92% of the subjects in the rotigotine arm, the optimal dose 
was the maximal dose allowed i.e. 8 mg/24 h. An improvement of 20% was seen in 52% of the 
subjects receiving rotigotine, 68% of the subjects receiving ropinirole and 30% of the subjects 
receiving placebo (Difference rotigotine versus placebo 21.7%, CI95% 11.1%; 32.4%, difference 
ropinirole versus placebo 38.4%, CI95% 28.1%; 48.6%, difference ropinirole versus rotigotine 16.6%, 
CI95% 7.6%; 25.7%). The mean improvement in the UPDRS score (Parts II + III) was 6.83 points 
(baseline 33.2 points) in the rotigotine arm, 10.78 points in the ropinirole arm (baseline 32.2 points) 
and 2.33 points in the placebo arm (baseline 31.3 points). All differences between the active 
treatments and placebo were statistically significant. This study failed to demonstrate non-inferiority 
of rotigotine to ropinirole. 
In a subsequent open-label study (SP824), a multicenter, multinational study, the tolerability of 
overnight switching from ropinirole, pramipexole or cabergoline to rotigotine transdermal patch and 
its effect on symptoms in subjects with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease have been studied. 116 patients 
were switched from previous oral therapy to receive up to 8 mg/24 h of rotigotine, among these were 
47 who had been treated with ropinirole up to 9 mg/day, 47 who had been treated with pramipexole up 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to 2 mg/day and 22 who had been treated with cabergoline up to 3 mg/day. Switching to rotigotine 
was feasible, with minor dose adjustment (median 2 mg/24 h) being necessary in only 2 patients 
switching from ropinirole, 5 patients from pramipexole and 4 patients from cabergoline. 
Improvements were seen in UPDRS Parts I - IV scores. The safety profile was unchanged from that 
observed in previous studies. 
In a randomized, open-label study (SP825) in patients with early-stage Parkinson’s disease, 25 
patients were randomized to rotigotine treatment and 26 to ropinirole. In both arms treatment was 
titrated to optimal or maximum dose of 8 mg/24 h or 9 mg/day, respectively. Both treatments showed 
improvements in early morning motor function and sleep. Motor symptoms (UPDRS Part III) 
improved by 6.3 ± 1.3 points in rotigotine-treated patients, and by 5.9 ± 1.3 points in the ropinirole-
group after 4 weeks of maintenance. Sleep (PDSS) improved by 4.1 ± 13.8 points for rotigotine-
treated patients, and by 2.5 ± 13.5 points for ropinirole-treated patients. The safety profile was 
comparable, with the exception of application site reactions. 
In studies SP824 and SP825 conducted since the initial comparative trial, rotigotine and ropinirole at 
equivalent doses were shown to have comparable efficacy. 
Two additional pivotal trials (SP650DB and SP515) were conducted in patients who were receiving 
concomitant levodopa therapy. The primary outcome assessment was the reduction in “off” time 
(hours). Efficacy was determined by the subject’s response to therapy in terms of responder and 
absolute improvement in the time spent “off”. 
In the double blind study SP650DB, 113 patients received rotigotine up to a maximum dose of 
8 mg/24 h, 109 patients received rotigotine up to a maximum dose of 12 mg/24 h and 119 patients 
received placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal doses of rotigotine or placebo in weekly 
increments of 2 mg/24 h starting at 4 mg/24 h. Patients in each treatment group were maintained at 
their optimal dose for 6 months. At the end of the maintenance treatment an improvement of at least 
30% was seen in 57% and 55% of the subjects receiving rotigotine 8 mg/24 h and 12 mg/24 h, 
respectively and in 34% of the subjects receiving placebo (Differences 22% and 21%, respectively, 
CI95% 10%; 35% and 8%; 33%, respectively, p<0.001 for both rotigotine groups). With rotigotine, the 
mean reductions in “off” time were 2.7 and 2.1 hours, respectively whereas in the placebo-treated arm 
a reduction of 0.9 hours was observed. The differences were statistically significant (p<0.001 and 
p=0.003, respectively). 
In the double-blind study SP515, 201 patients received rotigotine, 200 received pramipexole and 
100 patients received placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine in weekly 
increments of 2 mg/24 h starting at 4 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h. In the pramipexole 
group, patients received 0,375 mg in the first week, 0.75 mg in the second week and were titrated 
further in weekly increments of 0.75 mg to their optimal dose up to a maximum of 4.5 mg/day. 
Patients in each treatment group were maintained for 4 months. 
At the end of the maintenance treatment an improvement of at least 30% was seen in 60% of the 
subjects receiving rotigotine, 67% of the subjects receiving pramipexole and 35% of the subjects 
receiving placebo (Difference rotigotine versus placebo 25%, CI95% 13%; 36%, difference pramipexole 
versus placebo 32%, CI95% 21%; 43%, difference pramipexole versus rotigotine 7%, CI95%  -2%; 17%). 
The mean reduction in the “off” time was 2.5 hours in the rotigotine arm, 2.8 hours in the pramipexole 
arm and 0.9 hours in the placebo arm. All differences between the active treatments and placebo were 
statistically significant.  
A further multinational double-blind study (SP889) was conducted in 287 patients with early or 
advanced stages of Parkinson’s disease who had unsatisfactory early morning motor symptom control. 
81.5% of these patients were on concomitant levodopa therapy. 190 patients received rotigotine, and 
97 placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine or placebo in weekly 
increments of 2 mg/24 h starting at 2 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h over 8 weeks, 
followed by a maintenance period of 4 weeks. Early morning motor function, assessed by UPDRS part 
III, and nocturnal sleep disturbances, measured by the modified Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(PDSS-2), were co-primary outcome measures. At the end of maintenance, the mean UPDRS part III 
score had improved by 7.0 points in rotigotine-treated patients (baseline 29.6), and by 3.9 points in the 
placebo-group (baseline 32.0). Improvements in the mean PDSS-2 total score were 5.9 (rotigotine, 
baseline 19.3) and 1.9 points (placebo, baseline 20.5). Treatment differences for the coprimary 
variables were statistically significant (p=0.0002 and p<0.0001). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following application, rotigotine is continuously released from the transdermal patch and absorbed 
through the skin. Steady-state concentrations are reached after one to two days of patch application 
and are maintained at a stable level by once daily application in which the patch is worn for 24 hours. 
Rotigotine plasma concentrations increase dose-proportionally over a dose range of 1 mg/24 h to 
24 mg/24 h. 
Approximately 45% of the active substance within the patch is released to the skin in 24 hours. The 
absolute bioavailability after transdermal application is approximately 37%. 
Rotating the site of patch application may result in day-to-day differences in plasma levels. 
Differences in bioavailability of rotigotine ranged from 2% (upper arm versus flank) to 46% (shoulder 
versus thigh). However, there is no indication of a relevant impact on the clinical outcome. 
Distribution 
The in vitro binding of rotigotine to plasma proteins is approximately 92%. 
The apparent volume of distribution in humans is approximately 84 l/kg. 
Biotransformation 
Rotigotine is metabolised to a great extent. Rotigotine is metabolised by N-dealkylation as well as 
direct and secondary conjugation. In vitro results indicate that different CYP isoforms are able to 
catalyse the N-dealkylation of rotigotine. Main metabolites are sulfates and glucuronide conjugates of 
the parent compound as well as N-desalkyl-metabolites, which are biologically inactive. 
The information on metabolites is incomplete. 
Elimination 
Approximately 71% of the rotigotine dose is excreted in urine and a smaller part of about 23% is 
excreted in faeces. 
The clearance of rotigotine after transdermal administration is approximately 10 l/min and its overall 
elimination half-life is 5 to 7 hours. The pharmacokinetic profile shows a biphasic elimination with an 
initial half-life of about 2 to 3 hours. 
Because the patch is administered transdermally, no effect of food and gastrointestinal conditions is 
expected. 
Special patient groups 
Because therapy with Neupro is initiated at a low dose and gradually titrated according to clinical 
tolerability to obtain the optimum therapeutic effect, adjustment of the dose based on gender, weight, 
or age is not necessary. 
Hepatic and renal impairment 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment or mild to severe renal impairment, no relevant 
increases of rotigotine plasma levels were observed. Neupro was not investigated in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment.  
Plasma levels of conjugates of rotigotine and its desalkyl metabolites increase with impaired renal 
function. However, a contribution of these metabolites to clinical effects is unlikely. 
Paediatric population 
Limited pharmacokinetic data obtained in adolescent patients with RLS (13-17 years, n=24) following 
treatment with multiple doses of 0.5 to 3mg/24h showed that systemic exposure to rotigotine was 
similar to that observed in adults. Efficacy/safety data is insufficient to establish a relation between 
exposure and response (see also paediatric information in section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In repeated dose and long-term toxicity studies, the major effects were associated with the dopamine 
agonist related pharmacodynamic effects and the consequent decrease of prolactin secretion.  
After a single dose of rotigotine, binding to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes) in the pigmented rat 
and monkey was evident, but was slowly cleared over the 14-day observation period. 
Retinal degeneration was observed by transmission microscopy at a dose equivalent to 2.8 times the 
maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m² basis in a 3-month study in albino rats. The effects 
were more pronounced in female rats. Additional studies to further evaluate the specific pathology 
have not been performed. Retinal degeneration was not observed during the routine histopathological 
evaluation of the eyes in any of the toxicology studies in any species used. The relevance of these 
findings to humans is not known. 
In a carcinogenicity study, male rats developed Leydig cell tumours and hyperplasia. Malignant 
tumours were noted predominantly in the uterus of mid- and high-dose females. These changes are 
well-known effects of dopamine agonists in rats after life-long therapy and assessed as not relevant to 
man. 
The effects of rotigotine on reproduction have been investigated in rats, rabbits and mice. Rotigotine 
was not teratogenic in all three species, but was embryotoxic in rats and mice at materno-toxic doses. 
Rotigotine did not influence male fertility in rats, but clearly reduced female fertility in rats and mice, 
because of the effects on prolactin levels which are particularly significant in rodents. 
Rotigotine did not induce gene mutations in the Ames test, but did show effects in the in vitro Mouse 
Lymphoma Assay with metabolic activation and weaker effects without metabolic activation. This 
mutagenic effect could be attributed to a clastogenic effect of rotigotine. This effect was not confirmed 
in vivo in the Mouse Micronucleus Test in the rat Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) test. Since it 
ran more or less parallel with a decreased relative total growth of the cells, it may be related to a 
cytotoxic effect of the compound. Therefore, the relevance of the one positive in vitro mutagenicity 
test is not known.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Neupro is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of early-stage idiopathic Parkinson’s 
disease as monotherapy (i.e. without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i.e. over the course 
of the disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent 
and fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or ‘on-off’ fluctuations). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The dose recommendations made are in nominal dose. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dosing in patients with early-stage Parkinson’s disease: 
A single daily dose should be initiated at 2 mg/24 h and then increased in weekly increments of 
2 mg/24 h to an effective dose up to a maximum dose of 8 mg/24 h. 
4 mg/24 h may be an effective dose in some patients. For most patients an effective dose is reached 
within 3 or 4 weeks at doses of 6 mg/24 h or 8 mg/24 h, respectively. 
The maximum dose is 8 mg/24 h. 
Dosing in patients with advanced stage Parkinson’s disease with fluctuations: 
A single daily dose should be initiated at 4 mg/24 h and then increased in weekly increments of 
2 mg/24 h to an effective dose up to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h. 
4 mg/24 h or 6 mg/24 h may be effective doses in some patients. For most patients an effective dose is 
reached within 3 to 7 weeks at doses of 8 mg/24 h up to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h. 
For doses higher than 8 mg/24 h multiple patches may be used to achieve the final dose e.g. 
10 mg/24 h may be reached by combination of a 6 mg/24 h and a 4 mg/24 h patch.  
Neupro is applied once a day. The patch should be applied at approximately the same time every day. 
The patch remains on the skin for 24 hours and will then be replaced by a new one at a different site of 
application.  
If the patient forgets to apply the patch at the usual time of the day or if the patch becomes detached, 
another patch should be applied for the remainder of the day. 
Treatment discontinuation 
Neupro should be discontinued gradually. The daily dose should be reduced in steps of 2 mg/24 h with 
a dose reduction preferably every other day, until complete withdrawal of Neupro (see section 4.4). 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Adjustment of the dose is not necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Caution 
is advised when treating patients with severe hepatic impairment, which may result in lower rotigotine 
clearance. Rotigotine has not been investigated in this patient group. A dose reduction might be 
needed in case of worsening of the hepatic impairment.  
Renal impairment 
Adjustment of the dose is not necessary in patients with mild to severe renal impairment, including 
those requiring dialysis. Unexpected accumulation of rotigotine levels may also occur at acute 
worsening of renal function (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Neupro in the paediatric population in Parkinson’s disease. 
Method of administration 
Neupro is for transdermal use. 
The patch should be applied to clean, dry, intact healthy skin on the abdomen, thigh, hip, flank, 
shoulder, or upper arm. Reapplication to the same site within 14 days should be avoided. Neupro 
should not be placed on skin that is red, irritated or damaged (see section 4.4). 
Use and handling 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Each patch is packed in a sachet and should be applied directly after the sachet has been opened. One 
half of the release liner should be removed and the sticky side should be applied and pressed firmly to 
the skin. Then, the patch is fold back and the second part of the release liner is removed. The sticky 
side of the patch should not be touched. The patch should be pressed down firmly with the palm of the 
hand for about 30 seconds, so that it sticks well. 
The patch should not be cut into pieces. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Magnetic resonance imaging or cardioversion (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
If a Parkinson’s disease patient is insufficiently controlled while on treatment with rotigotine 
switching to another dopamine agonist might provide additional benefit (see section 5.1) 
Magnetic resonance imaging and cardioversion 
The backing layer of Neupro contains aluminium. To avoid skin burns, Neupro should be removed if 
the patient has to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cardioversion. 
Orthostatic hypotension 
Dopamine agonists are known to impair the systemic regulation of the blood pressure resulting in 
postural/orthostatic hypotension. These events have also been observed during treatment with 
rotigotine, but the incidence was similar to that observed in placebo-treated patients. 
It is recommended to monitor blood pressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the 
general risk of orthostatic hypotension associated with dopaminergic therapy. 
Syncope 
In clinical studies with rotigotine, syncope has been observed at a rate that was similar to that observed 
in patients treated with placebo. Because patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease were 
excluded in these studies, patients with severe cardiovascular disease should be asked about symptoms 
of syncope and pre-syncope. 
Sudden onset of sleep and somnolence 
Rotigotine has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset. Sudden onset of 
sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness of any warning signs, has been reported. 
Prescribers should continually reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, as patients may not 
acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned. A reduction of dosage or termination 
of therapy should be carefully considered.  
Impulse control and other related disorders 
Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders and related 
disorders including dopamine dysregulation syndrome. Patients and carers should be made aware that 
behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including pathologic gambling, increased libido, 
hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in 
patients treated with dopamine agonists, including rotigotine. In some patients, dopamine 
dysregulation syndrome was observed under the treatment with rotigotine. Dose reduction/tapered 
discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop. 
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Symptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal 
of dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended to taper treatment (see section 4.2). 
Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome 
Symptoms suggestive of dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (for example, pain, fatigue, 
depression, sweating, and anxiety) have been reported with abrupt withdrawal of dopaminergic 
therapy, therefore, it is recommended to taper treatment (see section 4.2). 
Abnormal thinking and behaviour 
Abnormal thinking and behaviour have been reported and can consist of a variety of manifestations 
including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behaviour, 
disorientation, aggressive behaviour, agitation, and delirium. 
Fibrotic complications 
Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, 
pericarditis and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived 
dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when treatment is discontinued, 
complete resolution does not always occur. 
Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these 
compounds, whether other, nonergot derived dopamine agonists can cause them is unknown. 
Neuroleptics 
Neuroleptics given as antiemetic should not be given to patients taking dopamine agonists (see also 
section 4.5). 
Ophthalmologic monitoring 
Ophthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur. 
Heat application 
External heat (excessive sunlight, heating pads and other sources of heat such as sauna, hot bath) 
should not be applied to the area of the patch. 
Application site reactions 
Application site skin reactions may occur and are usually mild or moderate in intensity. It is 
recommended that the application site should be rotated on a daily basis (e.g. from the right side to the 
left side and from the upper body to the lower body). The same site should not be used within 14 days. 
If application site reactions occur which last for more than a few days or are persistent, if there is an 
increase in severity, or if the skin reaction spreads outside the application site, an assessment of the 
risk/benefit balance for the individual patient should be conducted. 
If there is a skin rash or irritation from the transdermal system, direct sunlight on the area should be 
avoided until the skin heals, as exposure could lead to changes in the skin color. 
If a generalised skin reaction (e.g. allergic rash, including erythematous, macular, papular rash or 
pruritus) associated with the use of Neupro is observed, Neupro should be discontinued. 
Peripheral oedema 
In clinical studies in Parkinson’s patients, the 6 month-specific rates of peripheral oedema remained at 
about 4% through the entire observation period up to 36 months. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dopaminergic adverse reactions 
The incidence of some dopaminergic adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, dyskinesia, and 
peripheral oedema generally is higher when given in combination with L-dopa in Parkinson’s patients. 
This should be considered when prescribing rotigotine. 
Dystonic reactions 
Dystonic reactions including dystonia, abnormal posture, torticollis and pleurothotonus (Pisa 
Syndrome) have occasionally been reported in patients with Parkinson’s disease following initiation or 
incremental dose increase of rotigotine. Although dystonic reactions may be a symptom of Parkinson’s 
disease, the symptoms in some of these patients have improved after reduction or withdrawal of 
rotigotine. If a dystonic reaction occurs, the dopaminergic medication regimen should be reviewed and 
an adjustment in the dose of rotigotine considered.  
Sulphite sensitivity 
Neupro contains sodium metabisulphite, a sulphite that may cause allergic-type reactions including 
anaphylactic symptoms and life threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible 
people. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Because rotigotine is a dopamine agonist, it is assumed that dopamine antagonists, such as 
neuroleptics (e.g. phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish 
the effectiveness of Neupro, and co-administration should be avoided. Because of possible additive 
effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking sedating medicinal products or other CNS 
(central nervous system) depressants (e.g. benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants) or alcohol 
in combination with rotigotine. 
Co-administration of L-dopa and carbidopa with rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
rotigotine, and rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of L-dopa and carbidopa. 
Co-administration of domperidone with rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rotigotine.  
Co-administration of omeprazole (inhibitor of CYP2C19), in doses of 40 mg/day, had no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics and metabolism of rotigotine in healthy volunteers. 
Neupro may potentiate the dopaminergic adverse reaction of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate 
pre-existing dyskinesia, as described with other dopamine agonists. 
Co-administration of rotigotine (3 mg/24 h) did not affect the pharmacodynamics and 
pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (0.03 mg ethinylestradiol, 0.15 mg levonorgestrel).  
Interactions with other forms of hormonal contraception have not been investigated. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential, contraception in females 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception to prevent pregnancy during 
treatment with rotigotine. 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of rotigotine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not 
indicate any teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, but embryo-toxicity was observed in rats and mice 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
at materno-toxic doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Rotigotine should 
not be used during pregnancy.  
Breast-feeding 
Because rotigotine decreases prolactin secretion in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected. Studies 
in rats have shown that rotigotine and/or its metabolite(s) are excreted in breast milk. In the absence of 
human data, breast-feeding should be discontinued. 
Fertility 
For information on fertility studies, please see section 5.3. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Rotigotine may have major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Patients being treated with rotigotine and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes 
must be informed not to drive or engage in activities (e.g. operating machines) where impaired 
alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death until such recurrent episodes 
and somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials comprising a total of 1,307 Neupro- 
and 607 placebo-treated patients, 72.5% of the patients on Neupro and 58.0% of patients on placebo 
reported at least one adverse reaction. 
At the beginning of therapy dopaminergic adverse reactions such as nausea and vomiting may occur. 
These are usually mild or moderate in intensity and transient even if treatment is continued. 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in more than 10% of patients treated with Neupro 
transdermal patch are nausea, vomiting, application site reactions, somnolence, dizziness and 
headache. 
In trials where the application sites were rotated as reflected in the instructions provided in SmPC and 
package leaflet, 35.7% of 830 patients using the Neupro transdermal patch, experienced application 
site reactions. The majority of application site reactions were mild or moderate in intensity, limited to 
the application areas and resulted in discontinuation of treatment with Neupro in only 4.3% of all 
subjects receiving Neupro. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following table covers adverse drug reactions from the pooled studies mentioned above in patients 
with Parkinson’s disease and from post-marketing experience. Within the system organ classes, 
adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of patients expected to experience 
the reaction), using the following categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are 
presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Rotigotine has been associated with somnolence including excessive daytime somnolence and sudden 
sleep onset episodes. In isolated cases “sudden onset of sleep” occurred while driving and resulted in 
motor vehicle accidents (see also sections 4.4 and 4.7). 
Impulse control disorders 
Pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating 
and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists, including rotigotine (see 
section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
The most likely adverse reactions would be those related to the pharmacodynamic profile of a 
dopamine agonist, including nausea, vomiting, hypotension, involuntary movements, hallucinations, 
confusion, convulsions and other signs of central dopaminergic stimulation. 
Management 
There is no known antidote for overdose of dopamine agonists. In case of suspected overdose, removal 
of the patch(es) should be considered because after removal of the patch(es) the active substance input 
is stopped and the plasma concentration of rotigotine decreases rapidly. The patient should be 
monitored closely, including heart rate, heart rhythm and blood pressure.  
Treatment of overdose may require general supportive measures to maintain the vital signs. Dialysis 
would not be expected to be beneficial as rotigotine is not eliminated by dialysis. 
If it is necessary to discontinue rotigotine, this should be done gradually to prevent neuroleptic 
malignant syndrome. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-parkinson drugs, dopamine agonists; ATC code: N04BC09 
Rotigotine is a non-ergolinic dopamine agonist for the treatment of signs and symptoms of Parkinson’s 
disease and Restless Legs Syndrome.  
Mechanism of action 
Rotigotine is believed to elicit its beneficial effect on Parkinson’s disease by activation of the D3, D2 
and D1 receptors of the caudate-putamen in the brain. 
The precise mechanism of action of rotigotine as a treatment of RLS is unknown. It is thought that 
rotigotine may exert its activity mainly via dopamine receptors. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Regarding the functional activity at the various receptor subtypes and their distribution in the brain, 
rotigotine is a D2 and D3 receptor agonist acting also on D1, D4 and D5 receptors. With non-
dopaminergic receptors, rotigotine showed antagonism at alpha2B and agonism at 5HT1A receptors, 
but no activity on the 5HT2B receptor.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The effectiveness of rotigotine in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's 
disease was evaluated in a multinational drug development program consisting of four pivotal, 
parallel, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled studies and three studies investigating specific 
aspects of Parkinson’s disease.  
Two pivotal trials (SP512 Part I and SP513 Part I) investigating the effectiveness of rotigotine in 
the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease were conducted in patients 
who were not receiving concomitant dopamine agonist therapy and were either L-dopa naïve or 
previous L-dopa treatment was ≤ 6 months. The primary outcome assessment was the score for the 
Activities of Daily Living (ADL) component (Part II) plus the Motor Examination component (Part 
III) of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).  
Efficacy was determined by the subject’s response to therapy in terms of responder and absolute 
points improvement in the scores of ADL and Motor Examination combined (UPDRS part II+III). 
In the double blind study SP512 Part I, 177 patients received rotigotine and 96 patients received 
placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine or placebo in weekly increments 
of 2 mg/24 h starting at 2 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 6 mg/24 h. Patients in each treatment group 
were maintained at their optimal dose for 6 months. 
At the end of the maintenance treatment in 91% of the subjects in the rotigotine arm, the optimal dose 
was the maximal dose allowed i.e. 6 mg/24 h. An improvement of 20% was seen in 48% of the 
subjects receiving rotigotine and in 19% of the subjects receiving placebo (Difference 29%, CI95% 
18%; 39%, p<0.0001). With rotigotine, the mean improvement in the UPDRS score (Parts II + III) was 
-3.98 points (baseline 29.9 points) whereas in the placebo-treated arm a worsening of 1.31 points was 
observed (baseline 30.0 points). The difference was 5.28 points and statistically significant 
(p<0.0001).   
In the double-blind study SP513 Part I, 213 patients received rotigotine, 227 received ropinirole and 
117 patients received placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine in weekly 
increments of 2 mg/24 h starting at 2 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 8 mg/24 h over 4 weeks. In the 
ropinirole group, patients were titrated to their optimal dose up to a maximum of 24 mg/day over 13 
weeks. Patients in each treatment group were maintained for 6 months. 
At the end of the maintenance treatment in 92% of the subjects in the rotigotine arm, the optimal dose 
was the maximal dose allowed i.e. 8 mg/24 h. An improvement of 20% was seen in 52% of the 
subjects receiving rotigotine, 68% of the subjects receiving ropinirole and 30% of the subjects 
receiving placebo (Difference rotigotine versus placebo 21.7%, CI95% 11.1%; 32.4%, difference 
ropinirole versus placebo 38.4%, CI95% 28.1%; 48.6%, difference ropinirole versus rotigotine 16.6%, 
CI95% 7.6%; 25.7%). The mean improvement in the UPDRS score (Parts II + III) was 6.83 points 
(baseline 33.2 points) in the rotigotine arm, 10.78 points in the ropinirole arm (baseline 32.2 points) 
and 2.33 points in the placebo arm (baseline 31.3 points). All differences between the active 
treatments and placebo were statistically significant. This study failed to demonstrate non-inferiority 
of rotigotine to ropinirole.  
In a subsequent open-label study (SP824), a multicenter, multinational study, the tolerability of 
overnight switching from ropinirole, pramipexole or cabergoline to rotigotine transdermal patch and 
its effect on symptoms in subjects with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease have been studied. 116 patients 
were switched from previous oral therapy to receive up to 8 mg/24 h of rotigotine, among these were 
47 who had been treated with ropinirole up to 9 mg/day, 47 who had been treated with pramipexole up 
to 2 mg/day and 22 who had been treated with cabergoline up to 3 mg/day. Switching to rotigotine 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was feasible, with minor dose adjustment (median 2 mg/24 h) being necessary in only 2 patients 
switching from ropinirole, 5 patients from pramipexole and 4 patients from cabergoline. 
Improvements were seen in UPDRS Parts I - IV scores. The safety profile was unchanged from that 
observed in previous studies. 
In a randomized, open-label study (SP825) in patients with early stage Parkinson’s disease, 25 
patients were randomized to rotigotine treatment and 26 to ropinirole. In both arms treatment was 
titrated to optimal or maximum dose of 8 mg/24 h or 9 mg/day, respectively. Both treatments showed 
improvements in early morning motor function and sleep. Motor symptoms (UPDRS Part III) 
improved by 6.3 ± 1.3 points in rotigotine-treated patients, and by 5.9 ± 1.3 points in the ropinirole-
group after 4 weeks of maintenance. Sleep (PDSS) improved by 4.1 ± 13.8 points for rotigotine-
treated patients, and by 2.5 ± 13.5 points for ropinirole-treated patients. The safety profile was 
comparable, with the exception of application site reactions. 
In studies SP824 and SP825 conducted since the initial comparative trial, rotigotine and ropinirole at 
equivalent doses were shown to have comparable efficacy. 
Two additional pivotal trials (SP650DB and SP515) were conducted in patients who were receiving 
concomitant levodopa therapy. The primary outcome assessment was the reduction in “off” time 
(hours). Efficacy was determined by the subject’s response to therapy in terms of responder and 
absolute improvement in the time spent “off”. 
In the double blind study SP650DB, 113 patients received rotigotine up to a maximum dose of 
8 mg/24 h, 109 patients received rotigotine up to a maximum dose of 12 mg/24 h and 119 patients 
received placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal doses of rotigotine or placebo in weekly 
increments of 2 mg/24 h starting at 4 mg/24 h. Patients in each treatment group were maintained at 
their optimal dose for 6 months. At the end of the maintenance treatment an improvement of at least 
30% was seen in 57% and 55% of the subjects receiving rotigotine 8 mg/24 h and 12 mg/24 h, 
respectively and in 34% of the subjects receiving placebo (Differences 22% and 21%, respectively, 
CI95% 10%; 35% and 8%; 33%, respectively, p<0.001 for both rotigotine groups). With rotigotine, the 
mean reductions in “off” time were 2.7 and 2.1 hours, respectively whereas in the placebo-treated arm 
a reduction of 0.9 hours was observed. The differences were statistically significant (p<0.001 and 
p=0.003, respectively). 
In the double-blind study SP515, 201 patients received rotigotine, 200 received pramipexole and 
100 patients received placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine in weekly 
increments of 2 mg/24 h starting at 4 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h. In the pramipexole 
group, patients received 0,375 mg in the first week, 0.75 mg in the second week and were titrated 
further in weekly increments of 0.75 mg to their optimal dose up to a maximum of 4.5 mg/day. 
Patients in each treatment group were maintained for 4 months. 
At the end of the maintenance treatment an improvement of at least 30% was seen in 60% of the 
subjects receiving rotigotine, 67% of the subjects receiving pramipexole and 35% of the subjects 
receiving placebo (Difference rotigotine versus placebo 25%, CI95% 13%; 36%, difference pramipexole 
versus placebo 32%, CI95% 21%; 43%, difference pramipexole versus rotigotine 7%, CI95%  -2%; 17%). 
The mean reduction in the “off” time was 2.5 hours in the rotigotine arm, 2.8 hours in the pramipexole 
arm and 0.9 hours in the placebo arm. All differences between the active treatments and placebo were 
statistically significant.  
A further multinational double-blind study (SP889) was conducted in 287 patients with early or 
advanced stages of Parkinson’s disease who had unsatisfactory early morning motor symptom control. 
81.5% of these patients were on concomitant levodopa therapy. 190 patients received rotigotine, and 
97 placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine or placebo in weekly 
increments of 2 mg/24 h starting at 2 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h over 8 weeks, 
followed by a maintenance period of 4 weeks. Early morning motor function, assessed by UPDRS part 
III, and nocturnal sleep disturbances, measured by the modified Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale 
(PDSS-2), were co-primary outcome measures. At the end of maintenance, the mean UPDRS part III 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
score had improved by 7.0 points in rotigotine-treated patients (baseline 29.6), and by 3.9 points in the 
placebo-group (baseline 32.0). Improvements in the mean PDSS-2 total score were 5.9 (rotigotine, 
baseline 19.3) and 1.9 points (placebo, baseline 20.5). Treatment differences for the coprimary 
variables were statistically significant (p=0.0002 and p<0.0001). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following application, rotigotine is continuously released from the transdermal patch and absorbed 
through the skin. Steady-state concentrations are reached after one to two days of patch application 
and are maintained at a stable level by once daily application in which the patch is worn for 24 hours. 
Rotigotine plasma concentrations increase dose-proportionally over a dose range of 1 mg/24 h to 
24 mg/24 h. 
Approximately 45% of the active substance within the patch is released to the skin in 24 hours. The 
absolute bioavailability after transdermal application is approximately 37%. 
Rotating the site of patch application may result in day-to-day differences in plasma levels. 
Differences in bioavailability of rotigotine ranged from 2% (upper arm versus flank) to 46% (shoulder 
versus thigh). However, there is no indication of a relevant impact on the clinical outcome. 
Distribution 
The in vitro binding of rotigotine to plasma proteins is approximately 92%. 
The apparent volume of distribution in humans is approximately 84 l/kg. 
Biotransformation 
Rotigotine is metabolised to a great extent. Rotigotine is metabolised by N-dealkylation as well as 
direct and secondary conjugation. In vitro results indicate that different CYP isoforms are able to 
catalyse the N-dealkylation of rotigotine. Main metabolites are sulfates and glucuronide conjugates of 
the parent compound as well as N-desalkyl-metabolites, which are biologically inactive. 
The information on metabolites is incomplete. 
Elimination 
Approximately 71% of the rotigotine dose is excreted in urine and a smaller part of about 23% is 
excreted in faeces. 
The clearance of rotigotine after transdermal administration is approximately 10 l/min and its overall 
elimination half-life is 5 to 7 hours. The pharmacokinetic profile shows a biphasic elimination with an 
initial half-life of about 2 to 3 hours. 
Because the patch is administered transdermally, no effect of food and gastrointestinal conditions is 
expected. 
Special patient groups 
Because therapy with Neupro is initiated at a low dose and gradually titrated according to clinical 
tolerability to obtain the optimum therapeutic effect, adjustment of the dose based on gender, weight, 
or age is not necessary. 
Hepatic and renal impairment 
In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment or mild to severe renal impairment, no relevant 
increases of rotigotine plasma levels were observed. Neupro was not investigated in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment.  
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Plasma levels of conjugates of rotigotine and its desalkyl metabolites increase with impaired renal 
function. However, a contribution of these metabolites to clinical effects is unlikely. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In repeated dose and long-term toxicity studies, the major effects were associated with the dopamine 
agonist related pharmacodynamic effects and the consequent decrease of prolactin secretion.  
After a single dose of rotigotine, binding to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes) in the pigmented rat 
and monkey was evident, but was slowly cleared over the 14-day observation period. 
Retinal degeneration was observed by transmission microscopy at a dose equivalent to 2.8 times the 
maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m² basis in a 3-month study in albino rats. The effects 
were more pronounced in female rats. Additional studies to further evaluate the specific pathology 
have not been performed. Retinal degeneration was not observed during the routine histopathological 
evaluation of the eyes in any of the toxicology studies in any species used. The relevance of these 
findings to humans is not known. 
In a carcinogenicity study, male rats developed Leydig cell tumours and hyperplasia. Malignant 
tumours were noted predominantly in the uterus of mid- and high-dose females. These changes are 
well-known effects of dopamine agonists in rats after life-long therapy and assessed as not relevant to 
man. 
The effects of rotigotine on reproduction have been investigated in rats, rabbits and mice. Rotigotine 
was not teratogenic in all three species, but was embryotoxic in rats and mice at materno-toxic doses. 
Rotigotine did not influence male fertility in rats, but clearly reduced female fertility in rats and mice, 
because of the effects on prolactin levels which are particularly significant in rodents. 
Rotigotine did not induce gene mutations in the Ames test, but did show effects in the in vitro Mouse 
Lymphoma Assay with metabolic activation and weaker effects without metabolic activation. This 
mutagenic effect could be attributed to a clastogenic effect of rotigotine. This effect was not confirmed 
in vivo in the Mouse Micronucleus Test in the rat Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) test. Since it 
ran more or less parallel with a decreased relative total growth of the cells, it may be related to a 
cytotoxic effect of the compound. Therefore, the relevance of the one positive in vitro mutagenicity 
test is not known.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Neupro is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of early-stage idiopathic Parkinson’s 
disease as monotherapy (i.e. without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i.e. over the course 
of the disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent 
and fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or ‘on-off’ fluctuations). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The dose recommendations made are in nominal dose. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dosing in patients with early-stage Parkinson’s disease: 
A single daily dose should be initiated at 2 mg/24 h and then increased in weekly increments of 
2 mg/24 h to an effective dose up to a maximum dose of 8 mg/24 h. 
4 mg/24 h may be an effective dose in some patients. For most patients an effective dose is reached 
within 3 or 4 weeks at doses of 6 mg/24 h or 8 mg/24 h, respectively. 
The maximum dose is 8 mg/24 h. 
Dosing in patients with advanced stage Parkinson’s disease with fluctuations: 
A single daily dose should be initiated at 4 mg/24 h and then increased in weekly increments of 
2 mg/24 h to an effective dose up to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h. 
4 mg/24 h or 6 mg/24 h may be effective doses in some patients. For most patients an effective dose is 
reached within 3 to 7 weeks at doses of 8 mg/24 h up to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h. 
Neupro treatment initiation pack contains 4 different packages (one for each strength) with 7 patches 
each, for the first four weeks of therapy.  
Depending on the patient’s response, not all of the following dose steps may be required or additional 
higher doses may be needed after week 4, which are not covered by this package. 
On the first day of treatment the patient starts with Neupro 2 mg/24 h. During the second week, the 
patient takes Neupro 4 mg/24 h. During the third week, he or she takes Neupro 6 mg/24 h and during 
the fourth week Neupro 8 mg/24 h. The packages are marked with “Week 1 (2, 3 or 4)”. 
Neupro is applied once a day. The patch should be applied at approximately the same time every day. 
The patch remains on the skin for 24 hours and will then be replaced by a new one at a different site of 
application.  
If the patient forgets to apply the patch at the usual time of the day or if the patch becomes detached, 
another patch should be applied for the remainder of the day. 
Treatment discontinuation 
Neupro should be discontinued gradually. The daily dose should be reduced in steps of 2 mg/24 h with 
a dose reduction preferably every other day, until complete withdrawal of Neupro (see section 4.4). 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Adjustment of the dose is not necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Caution 
is advised when treating patients with severe hepatic impairment, which may result in lower rotigotine 
clearance. Rotigotine has not been investigated in this patient group. A dose reduction might be 
needed in case of worsening of the hepatic impairment.  
Renal impairment 
Adjustment of the dose is not necessary in patients with mild to severe renal impairment, including 
those requiring dialysis. Unexpected accumulation of rotigotine levels may also occur at acute 
worsening of renal function (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Neupro in the paediatric population in Parkinson’s disease. 
Method of administration 
Neupro is for transdermal use. 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The patch should be applied to clean, dry, intact healthy skin on the abdomen, thigh, hip, flank, 
shoulder, or upper arm. Reapplication to the same site within 14 days should be avoided. Neupro 
should not be placed on skin that is red, irritated or damaged (see section 4.4). 
Use and handling 
Each patch is packed in a sachet and should be applied directly after the sachet has been opened. One 
half of the release liner should be removed and the sticky side should be applied and pressed firmly to 
the skin. Then, the patch is fold back and the second part of the release liner is removed. The sticky 
side of the patch should not be touched. The patch should be pressed down firmly with the palm of the 
hand for about 30 seconds, so that it sticks well. 
The patch should not be cut into pieces. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Magnetic resonance imaging or cardioversion (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
If a Parkinson’s disease patient is insufficiently controlled while on treatment with rotigotine 
switching to another dopamine agonist might provide additional benefit (see section 5.1) 
Magnetic resonance imaging and cardioversion 
The backing layer of Neupro contains aluminium. To avoid skin burns, Neupro should be removed if 
the patient has to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cardioversion. 
Orthostatic hypotension 
Dopamine agonists are known to impair the systemic regulation of the blood pressure resulting in 
postural/orthostatic hypotension. These events have also been observed during treatment with 
rotigotine, but the incidence was similar to that observed in placebo-treated patients. 
It is recommended to monitor blood pressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the 
general risk of orthostatic hypotension associated with dopaminergic therapy. 
Syncope 
In clinical studies with rotigotine, syncope has been observed at a rate that was similar to that observed 
in patients treated with placebo. Because patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease were 
excluded in these studies, patients with severe cardiovascular disease should be asked about symptoms 
of syncope and pre-syncope. 
Sudden onset of sleep and somnolence 
Rotigotine has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset. Sudden onset of 
sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness of any warning signs, has been reported. 
Prescribers should continually reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, as patients may not 
acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned. A reduction of dosage or termination 
of therapy should be carefully considered.  
Impulse control and other related disorders 
Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders and related 
disorders including dopamine dysregulation syndrome. Patients and carers should be made aware that 
behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including pathologic gambling, increased libido, 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in 
patients treated with dopamine agonists, including rotigotine. In some patients, dopamine 
dysregulation syndrome was observed under the treatment with rotigotine. Dose reduction/tapered 
discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop. 
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome 
Symptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal 
of dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended to taper treatment (see section 4.2). 
Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome 
Symptoms suggestive of dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (for example, pain, fatigue, 
depression, sweating, and anxiety) have been reported with abrupt withdrawal of dopaminergic 
therapy, therefore, it is recommended to taper treatment (see section 4.2). 
Abnormal thinking and behaviour 
Abnormal thinking and behaviour have been reported and can consist of a variety of manifestations 
including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behaviour, 
disorientation, aggressive behaviour, agitation, and delirium. 
Fibrotic complications 
Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, 
pericarditis and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived 
dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when treatment is discontinued, 
complete resolution does not always occur. 
Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these 
compounds, whether other, nonergot derived dopamine agonists can cause them is unknown. 
Neuroleptics 
Neuroleptics given as antiemetic should not be given to patients taking dopamine agonists (see also 
section 4.5). 
Ophthalmologic monitoring 
Ophthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur. 
Heat application 
External heat (excessive sunlight, heating pads and other sources of heat such as sauna, hot bath) 
should not be applied to the area of the patch. 
Application site reactions 
Application site skin reactions may occur and are usually mild or moderate in intensity. It is 
recommended that the application site should be rotated on a daily basis (e.g. from the right side to the 
left side and from the upper body to the lower body). The same site should not be used within 14 days. 
If application site reactions occur which last for more than a few days or are persistent, if there is an 
increase in severity, or if the skin reaction spreads outside the application site, an assessment of the 
risk/benefit balance for the individual patient should be conducted. 
If there is a skin rash or irritation from the transdermal system, direct sunlight on the area should be 
avoided until the skin heals, as exposure could lead to changes in the skin color. 
If a generalised skin reaction (e.g. allergic rash, including erythematous, macular, papular rash or 
pruritus) associated with the use of Neupro is observed, Neupro should be discontinued. 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Peripheral oedema 
In clinical studies in Parkinson’s patients, the 6 month-specific rates of peripheral oedema remained at 
about 4% through the entire observation period up to 36 months. 
Dopaminergic adverse reactions 
The incidence of some dopaminergic adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, dyskinesia, and 
peripheral oedema generally is higher when given in combination with L-dopa in Parkinson’s patients. 
This should be considered when prescribing rotigotine. 
Dystonic reactions 
Dystonic reactions including dystonia, abnormal posture, torticollis and pleurothotonus (Pisa 
Syndrome) have occasionally been reported in patients with Parkinson’s disease following initiation or 
incremental dose increase of rotigotine. Although dystonic reactions may be a symptom of Parkinson’s 
disease, the symptoms in some of these patients have improved after reduction or withdrawal of 
rotigotine. If a dystonic reaction occurs, the dopaminergic medication regimen should be reviewed and 
an adjustment in the dose of rotigotine considered.  
Sulphite sensitivity 
Neupro contains sodium metabisulphite, a sulphite that may cause allergic-type reactions including 
anaphylactic symptoms and life threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible 
people. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Because rotigotine is a dopamine agonist, it is assumed that dopamine antagonists, such as 
neuroleptics (e.g. phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish 
the effectiveness of Neupro, and co-administration should be avoided. Because of possible additive 
effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking sedating medicinal products or other CNS 
(central nervous system) depressants (e.g. benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants) or alcohol 
in combination with rotigotine. 
Co-administration of L-dopa and carbidopa with rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
rotigotine, and rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of L-dopa and carbidopa. 
Co-administration of domperidone with rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rotigotine.  
Co-administration of omeprazole (inhibitor of CYP2C19), in doses of 40 mg/day, had no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics and metabolism of rotigotine in healthy volunteers. 
Neupro may potentiate the dopaminergic adverse reaction of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate 
pre-existing dyskinesia, as described with other dopamine agonists. 
Co-administration of rotigotine (3 mg/24 h) did not affect the pharmacodynamics and 
pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (0.03 mg ethinylestradiol, 0.15 mg levonorgestrel).  
Interactions with other forms of hormonal contraception have not been investigated. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential, contraception in females 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception to prevent pregnancy during 
treatment with rotigotine. 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of rotigotine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not 
indicate any teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, but embryo-toxicity was observed in rats and mice 
at materno-toxic doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Rotigotine should 
not be used during pregnancy.  
Breast-feeding 
Because rotigotine decreases prolactin secretion in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected. Studies 
in rats have shown that rotigotine and/or its metabolite(s) are excreted in breast milk. In the absence of 
human data, breast-feeding should be discontinued. 
Fertility 
For information on fertility studies, please see section 5.3. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Rotigotine may have major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Patients being treated with rotigotine and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes 
must be informed not to drive or engage in activities (e.g. operating machines) where impaired 
alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death until such recurrent episodes 
and somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials comprising a total of 1,307 Neupro- 
and 607 placebo-treated patients, 72.5% of the patients on Neupro and 58.0% of patients on placebo 
reported at least one adverse reaction. 
At the beginning of therapy dopaminergic adverse reactions such as nausea and vomiting may occur. 
These are usually mild or moderate in intensity and transient even if treatment is continued. 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in more than 10% of patients treated with Neupro 
transdermal patch are nausea, vomiting, application site reactions, somnolence, dizziness and 
headache. 
In trials where the application sites were rotated as reflected in the instructions provided in SmPC and 
package leaflet, 35.7% of 830 patients using the Neupro transdermal patch, experienced application 
site reactions. The majority of application site reactions were mild or moderate in intensity, limited to 
the application areas and resulted in discontinuation of treatment with Neupro in only 4.3% of all 
subjects receiving Neupro. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following table covers adverse drug reactions from the pooled studies mentioned above in patients 
with Parkinson’s disease and from post-marketing experience. Within the system organ classes, 
adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of patients expected to experience 
the reaction), using the following categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are 
presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Sudden onset of sleep and somnolence 
Rotigotine has been associated with somnolence including excessive daytime somnolence and sudden 
sleep onset episodes. In isolated cases “sudden onset of sleep” occurred while driving and resulted in 
motor vehicle accidents (see also sections 4.4 and 4.7). 
Impulse control disorders 
Pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating 
and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists, including rotigotine (see 
section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
The most likely adverse reactions would be those related to the pharmacodynamic profile of a 
dopamine agonist, including nausea, vomiting, hypotension, involuntary movements, hallucinations, 
confusion, convulsions and other signs of central dopaminergic stimulation. 
Management 
There is no known antidote for overdose of dopamine agonists. In case of suspected overdose, removal 
of the patch(es) should be considered because after removal of the patch(es) the active substance input 
is stopped and the plasma concentration of rotigotine decreases rapidly. The patient should be 
monitored closely, including heart rate, heart rhythm and blood pressure.  
Treatment of overdose may require general supportive measures to maintain the vital signs. Dialysis 
would not be expected to be beneficial as rotigotine is not eliminated by dialysis. 
If it is necessary to discontinue rotigotine, this should be done gradually to prevent neuroleptic 
malignant syndrome.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-parkinson drugs, dopamine agonists; ATC code: N04BC09 
Rotigotine is a non-ergolinic dopamine agonist for the treatment of signs and symptoms of Parkinson’s 
disease and Restless Legs Syndrome.  
Mechanism of action 
Rotigotine is believed to elicit its beneficial effect on Parkinson’s disease by activation of the D3, D2 
and D1 receptors of the caudate-putamen in the brain. 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The precise mechanism of action of rotigotine as a treatment of RLS is unknown. It is thought that 
rotigotine may exert its activity mainly via dopamine receptors. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Regarding the functional activity at the various receptor subtypes and their distribution in the brain, 
rotigotine is a D2 and D3 receptor agonist acting also on D1, D4 and D5 receptors. With non-
dopaminergic receptors, rotigotine showed antagonism at alpha2B and agonism at 5HT1A receptors, 
but no activity on the 5HT2B receptor.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The effectiveness of rotigotine in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's 
disease was evaluated in a multinational drug development program consisting of four pivotal, 
parallel, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled studies and three studies investigating specific 
aspects of Parkinson’s disease. 
Two pivotal trials (SP512 Part I and SP513 Part I) investigating the effectiveness of rotigotine in 
the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease were conducted in patients 
who were not receiving concomitant dopamine agonist therapy and were either L-dopa naïve or 
previous L-dopa treatment was ≤ 6 months. The primary outcome assessment was the score for the 
Activities of Daily Living (ADL) component (Part II) plus the Motor Examination component (Part 
III) of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).  
Efficacy was determined by the subject’s response to therapy in terms of responder and absolute 
points improvement in the scores of ADL and Motor Examination combined (UPDRS part II+III). 
In the double blind study SP512 Part I, 177 patients received rotigotine and 96 patients received 
placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine or placebo in weekly increments 
of 2 mg/24 h starting at 2 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 6 mg/24 h. Patients in each treatment group 
were maintained at their optimal dose for 6 months. 
At the end of the maintenance treatment in 91% of the subjects in the rotigotine arm, the optimal dose 
was the maximal dose allowed i.e. 6 mg/24 h. An improvement of 20% was seen in 48% of the 
subjects receiving rotigotine and in 19% of the subjects receiving placebo (Difference 29%, CI95% 
18%; 39%, p<0.0001). With rotigotine, the mean improvement in the UPDRS score (Parts II + III) was 
-3.98 points (baseline 29.9 points) whereas in the placebo-treated arm a worsening of 1.31 points was 
observed (baseline 30.0 points). The difference was 5.28 points and statistically significant 
(p<0.0001).   
In the double-blind study SP513 Part I, 213 patients received rotigotine, 227 received ropinirole and 
117 patients received placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine in weekly 
increments of 2 mg/24 h starting at 2 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 8 mg/24 h over 4 weeks. In the 
ropinirole group, patients were titrated to their optimal dose up to a maximum of 24 mg/day over 13 
weeks. Patients in each treatment group were maintained for 6 months. 
At the end of the maintenance treatment in 92% of the subjects in the rotigotine arm, the optimal dose 
was the maximal dose allowed i.e. 8 mg/24 h. An improvement of 20% was seen in 52% of the 
subjects receiving rotigotine, 68% of the subjects receiving ropinirole and 30% of the subjects 
receiving placebo (Difference rotigotine versus placebo 21.7%, CI95% 11.1%; 32.4%, difference 
ropinirole versus placebo 38.4%, CI95% 28.1%; 48.6%, difference ropinirole versus rotigotine 16.6%, 
CI95% 7.6%; 25.7%). The mean improvement in the UPDRS score (Parts II + III) was 6.83 points 
(baseline 33.2 points) in the rotigotine arm, 10.78 points in the ropinirole arm (baseline 32.2 points) 
and 2.33 points in the placebo arm (baseline 31.3 points). All differences between the active 
treatments and placebo were statistically significant. This study failed to demonstrate non-inferiority 
of rotigotine to ropinirole.  
In a subsequent open-label study (SP824), a multicenter, multinational study, the tolerability of 
overnight switching from ropinirole, pramipexole or cabergoline to rotigotine transdermal patch and 
its effect on symptoms in subjects with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease have been studied. 116 patients 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were switched from previous oral therapy to receive up to 8 mg/24 h of rotigotine, among these were 
47 who had been treated with ropinirole up to 9 mg/day, 47 who had been treated with pramipexole up 
to 2 mg/day and 22 who had been treated with cabergoline up to 3 mg/day. Switching to rotigotine 
was feasible, with minor dose adjustment (median 2 mg/24 h) being necessary in only 2 patients 
switching from ropinirole, 5 patients from pramipexole and 4 patients from cabergoline. 
Improvements were seen in UPDRS Parts I - IV scores. The safety profile was unchanged from that 
observed in previous studies. 
In a randomized, open-label study (SP825) in patients with early stage Parkinson’s disease, 25 
patients were randomized to rotigotine treatment and 26 to ropinirole. In both arms treatment was 
titrated to optimal or maximum dose of 8 mg/24 h or 9 mg/day, respectively. Both treatments showed 
improvements in early morning motor function and sleep. Motor symptoms (UPDRS Part III) 
improved by 6.3 ± 1.3 points in rotigotine-treated patients, and by 5.9 ± 1.3 points in the ropinirole-
group after 4 weeks of maintenance. Sleep (PDSS) improved by 4.1 ± 13.8 points for rotigotine-
treated patients, and by 2.5 ± 13.5 points for ropinirole-treated patients. The safety profile was 
comparable, with the exception of application site reactions. 
In studies SP824 and SP825 conducted since the initial comparative trial, rotigotine and ropinirole at 
equivalent doses were shown to have comparable efficacy. 
Two additional pivotal trials (SP650DB and SP515) were conducted in patients who were receiving 
concomitant levodopa therapy. The primary outcome assessment was the reduction in “off” time 
(hours). Efficacy was determined by the subject’s response to therapy in terms of responder and 
absolute improvement in the time spent “off”. 
In the double blind study SP650DB, 113 patients received rotigotine up to a maximum dose of 
8 mg/24 h, 109 patients received rotigotine up to a maximum dose of 12 mg/24 h and 119 patients 
received placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal doses of rotigotine or placebo in weekly 
increments of 2 mg/24 h starting at 4 mg/24 h. Patients in each treatment group were maintained at 
their optimal dose for 6 months. At the end of the maintenance treatment an improvement of at least 
30% was seen in 57% and 55% of the subjects receiving rotigotine 8 mg/24 h and 12 mg/24 h, 
respectively and in 34% of the subjects receiving placebo (Differences 22% and 21%, respectively, 
CI95% 10%; 35% and 8%; 33%, respectively, p<0.001 for both rotigotine groups). With rotigotine, the 
mean reductions in “off” time were 2.7 and 2.1 hours, respectively whereas in the placebo-treated arm 
a reduction of 0.9 hours was observed. The differences were statistically significant (p<0.001 and 
p=0.003, respectively). 
In the double-blind study SP515, 201 patients received rotigotine, 200 received pramipexole and 
100 patients received placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine in weekly 
increments of 2 mg/24 h starting at 4 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h. In the pramipexole 
group, patients received 0,375 mg in the first week, 0.75 mg in the second week and were titrated 
further in weekly increments of 0.75 mg to their optimal dose up to a maximum of 4.5 mg/day. 
Patients in each treatment group were maintained for 4 months. 
At the end of the maintenance treatment an improvement of at least 30% was seen in 60% of the 
subjects receiving rotigotine, 67% of the subjects receiving pramipexole and 35% of the subjects 
receiving placebo (Difference rotigotine versus placebo 25%, CI95% 13%; 36%, difference pramipexole 
versus placebo 32%, CI95% 21%; 43%, difference pramipexole versus rotigotine 7%, CI95%  -2%; 17%). 
The mean reduction in the “off” time was 2.5 hours in the rotigotine arm, 2.8 hours in the pramipexole 
arm and 0.9 hours in the placebo arm. All differences between the active treatments and placebo were 
statistically significant.  
A further multinational double-blind study (SP889) was conducted in 287 patients with early or 
advanced stages of Parkinson’s disease who had unsatisfactory early morning motor symptom control. 
81.5% of these patients were on concomitant levodopa therapy. 190 patients received rotigotine, and 
97 placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine or placebo in weekly 
increments of 2 mg/24 h starting at 2 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h over 8 weeks, 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
followed by a maintenance period of 4 weeks. Early morning motor function, assessed by UPDRS part 
III, and nocturnal sleep disturbances, measured by the modified Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale 
(PDSS-2), were co-primary outcome measures. At the end of maintenance, the mean UPDRS part III 
score had improved by 7.0 points in rotigotine-treated patients (baseline 29.6), and by 3.9 points in the 
placebo-group (baseline 32.0). Improvements in the mean PDSS-2 total score were 5.9 (rotigotine, 
baseline 19.3) and 1.9 points (placebo, baseline 20.5). Treatment differences for the coprimary 
variables were statistically significant (p=0.0002 and p<0.0001). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following application, rotigotine is continuously released from the transdermal patch and absorbed 
through the skin. Steady-state concentrations are reached after one to two days of patch application 
and are maintained at a stable level by once daily application in which the patch is worn for 24 hours. 
Rotigotine plasma concentrations increase dose-proportionally over a dose range of 1 mg/24 h to 
24 mg/24 h. 
Approximately 45% of the active substance within the patch is released to the skin in 24 hours. The 
absolute bioavailability after transdermal application is approximately 37%. 
Rotating the site of patch application may result in day-to-day differences in plasma levels. 
Differences in bioavailability of rotigotine ranged from 2% (upper arm versus flank) to 46% (shoulder 
versus thigh). However, there is no indication of a relevant impact on the clinical outcome. 
Distribution 
The in vitro binding of rotigotine to plasma proteins is approximately 92%. 
The apparent volume of distribution in humans is approximately 84 l/kg. 
Biotransformation 
Rotigotine is metabolised to a great extent. Rotigotine is metabolised by N-dealkylation as well as 
direct and secondary conjugation. In vitro results indicate that different CYP isoforms are able to 
catalyse the N-dealkylation of rotigotine. Main metabolites are sulfates and glucuronide conjugates of 
the parent compound as well as N-desalkyl-metabolites, which are biologically inactive. 
The information on metabolites is incomplete. 
Elimination 
Approximately 71% of the rotigotine dose is excreted in urine and a smaller part of about 23% is 
excreted in faeces. 
The clearance of rotigotine after transdermal administration is approximately 10 l/min and its overall 
elimination half-life is 5 to 7 hours. The pharmacokinetic profile shows a biphasic elimination with an 
initial half-life of about 2 to 3 hours. 
Because the patch is administered transdermally, no effect of food and gastrointestinal conditions is 
expected. 
Special patient groups 
Because therapy with Neupro is initiated at a low dose and gradually titrated according to clinical 
tolerability to obtain the optimum therapeutic effect, adjustment of the dose based on gender, weight, 
or age is not necessary. 
Hepatic and renal impairment 
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment or mild to severe renal impairment, no relevant 
increases of rotigotine plasma levels were observed. Neupro was not investigated in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment.  
Plasma levels of conjugates of rotigotine and its desalkyl metabolites increase with impaired renal 
function. However, a contribution of these metabolites to clinical effects is unlikely. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In repeated dose and long-term toxicity studies, the major effects were associated with the dopamine 
agonist related pharmacodynamic effects and the consequent decrease of prolactin secretion.  
After a single dose of rotigotine, binding to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes) in the pigmented rat 
and monkey was evident, but was slowly cleared over the 14-day observation period. 
Retinal degeneration was observed by transmission microscopy at a dose equivalent to 2.8 times the 
maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m² basis in a 3-month study in albino rats. The effects 
were more pronounced in female rats. Additional studies to further evaluate the specific pathology 
have not been performed. Retinal degeneration was not observed during the routine histopathological 
evaluation of the eyes in any of the toxicology studies in any species used. The relevance of these 
findings to humans is not known. 
In a carcinogenicity study, male rats developed Leydig cell tumours and hyperplasia. Malignant 
tumours were noted predominantly in the uterus of mid- and high-dose females. These changes are 
well-known effects of dopamine agonists in rats after life-long therapy and assessed as not relevant to 
man. 
The effects of rotigotine on reproduction have been investigated in rats, rabbits and mice. Rotigotine 
was not teratogenic in all three species, but was embryotoxic in rats and mice at materno-toxic doses. 
Rotigotine did not influence male fertility in rats, but clearly reduced female fertility in rats and mice, 
because of the effects on prolactin levels which are particularly significant in rodents. 
Rotigotine did not induce gene mutations in the Ames test, but did show effects in the in vitro Mouse 
Lymphoma Assay with metabolic activation and weaker effects without metabolic activation. This 
mutagenic effect could be attributed to a clastogenic effect of rotigotine. This effect was not confirmed 
in vivo in the Mouse Micronucleus Test in the rat Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) test. Since it 
ran more or less parallel with a decreased relative total growth of the cells, it may be related to a 
cytotoxic effect of the compound. Therefore, the relevance of the one positive in vitro mutagenicity 
test is not known.

important information for you. 
• 
• 
• 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. 
This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, 
even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Neupro is and what it is used for 
What Neupro is 
Neupro contains the active substance rotigotine.  
It belongs to a group of medicines called ‘dopamine agonists’. Dopamine is a messenger in the brain 
which is important for movement. 
What Neupro is used for  
Neupro is used in adults to treat the signs and symptoms of: 
• 
Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) – this can be associated with discomfort in your legs or arms, 
urges to move around, sleep disturbance and feeling tired or sleepy during the day. These 
symptoms are either reduced or their duration is shortened with Neupro treatment. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Neupro 
Do not use Neupro if: 
• 
you are allergic to rotigotine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
you need to have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (diagnostic pictures of the inside 
of the body, created using magnetic rather than x-ray energy) 
you need ‘cardioversion’ (specific treatment for abnormal heart beat). 
• 
• 
You must take your Neupro patch off just before undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or 
cardioversion to avoid skin burns  because the patch contains aluminium. You can put a new patch on 
afterwards.  
If any of the above apply to you, do not use Neupro. If you are not sure about this, talk to your doctor 
or pharmacist or nurse first. 
125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse before using Neupro. This is because: 
• 
your blood pressure needs checking regularly while using Neupro, especially at the start of the 
treatment. Neupro may affect your blood pressure. 
your eyes need checking regularly while using Neupro. If you notice any problems with your 
eyesight between checks, talk to your doctor straight away. 
if you have serious liver problems, your doctor may need to change the dose. If your liver 
problems get worse during treatment, talk to your doctor straight away. 
you may get skin problems caused by the patch – see ‘Skin problems caused by the patch’ in 
section 4. 
you may feel very sleepy or fall asleep suddenly – see ‘Driving and using machines’ in 
section 2. 
your symptoms of Restless Legs Syndrome may start earlier than usual, be more intense and 
involve other limbs. If you experience such symptoms either before or after beginning treatment 
with Neupro, contact your doctor as your treatment may need to be adjusted. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Medicines used to treat Restless Legs Syndrome should be reduced or stopped gradually. Tell your 
doctor if after stopping or reducing your Neupro treatment you experience symptoms such as 
depression, anxiety, fatigue, sweating or pain. 
Loss of consciousness can occur 
Neupro can cause loss of consciousness. This can happen especially when you start using Neupro or 
when your dose is increased. Tell your doctor if you lose consciousness or feel dizzy. 
Changes in behaviour and abnormal thinking 
Neupro can cause side effects that change your behaviour (how you act). You may find it helpful to 
tell a member of your family or carer that you are using this medicine and ask them to read this leaflet. 
This is so that your family or carer can tell you, or your doctor, if they are worried about any changes 
in your behaviour. Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices you are using the drug 
excessively or developing craving for large doses of Neupro or other medicines used to treat Restless 
Legs Syndrome. 
See ‘Changes to your behaviour and abnormal thinking’ in section 4 for more information. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children below 18 years of age because it is not known if it is safe or 
effective in this age group. 
Other medicines and Neupro 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. 
Do not take the following medicines while using Neupro – because they may decrease its effect:  
• 
• 
‘anti-psychotic’ medicines – used to treat certain mental illnesses  
metoclopramide – used to treat nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting.  
Talk to your doctor before using Neupro if you are taking: 
• 
sedating medicines such as benzodiazepines or medicines used to treat mental illness or 
depression. 
medicines that lower blood pressure. Neupro may decrease blood pressure when you stand up – 
this effect may be worsened by the medicines used to lower blood pressure.  
• 
Your doctor will let you know if it is safe to keep taking these medicines while using Neupro. 
126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Neupro with food, drink and alcohol 
Because rotigotine enters your bloodstream through your skin, food or drink does not affect the way 
this medicine is absorbed by the body. You should discuss with your doctor if it is safe for you to 
drink alcohol while using Neupro. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Neupro if you are pregnant. This is because the effects of rotigotine on pregnancy and the 
unborn baby are not known.  
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Neupro. This is because rotigotine may pass into your breast 
milk and affect your baby. It is also likely to lower the amount of milk you produce. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Neupro may make you feel very sleepy and you may fall asleep very suddenly. If this happens, do not 
drive. In isolated cases, people have fallen asleep while driving and this has caused accidents. 
Also do not use tools or machines if you feel very sleepy – or do anything else which may put others 
or yourself at risk of serious injury. 
Neupro contains sodium metabisulphite (E223) 
Sodium metabisulphite (E223) may rarely cause severe hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions and 
bronchospasm (breathing distress caused by narrowing of the airways). 
3. 
How to use Neupro 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Which strength patches to use 
Neupro is available in different strength patches which release the medicine over 24 hours. The 
strengths are 1 mg/24 h, 2 mg/24 h and 3 mg/24 h for the treatment of Restless Leg Syndrome.  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Your starting dose will be one, 1 mg/24 h patch each day.  
From the second week, your daily dose may be increased by 1 mg each week until you get to the 
right maintenance dose for you. This is when you and your doctor agree that the symptoms are 
being controlled well enough and the side effects of the medicines are acceptable. 
Please follow the instructions of the prescriber carefully. 
The maximum dose is 3 mg per day. 
If you have to stop taking this medicine, see ‘If you stop using Neupro’ in section 3. 
How to use the Neupro patches 
Neupro is a patch that is put on the skin. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Make sure that you take the old patch off before putting on a new one. 
Stick the new patch on a different area of the skin each day.  
Leave the patch on your skin for 24 hours, then take it off and put on a new one.  
Change the patches at about the same time every day. 
Do not cut the Neupro patches into pieces. 
127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Where to stick the patch 
Put the sticky side of the patch onto clean, dry, 
healthy skin on the following areas as shown in grey on 
the pictures opposite:  
• 
• 
• 
Shoulder or upper arm. 
Belly. 
Flank (your side, between the ribs 
and hips). 
Thigh or hip. 
• 
To avoid skin irritation 
• 
Stick the patch onto a different area of skin each day. For 
example, put it on the right side of your body one day, then 
on the left side of your body the next day. Or on your upper 
body one day, then on your lower body the day after that.  
Do not stick Neupro on the same area of skin twice 
within 14 days. 
Do not stick the patch on broken or damaged skin – or on 
skin that is red or irritated. 
• 
• 
If you still get problems with your skin because of the patch, please see ‘Skin problems caused by 
the patch’ in section 4 for more information. 
To prevent the patch becoming loose or falling off 
• 
• 
Do not put the patch in an area where it can be rubbed by tight clothing. 
Do not use creams, oils, lotions, powders or other skin products where you will put the patch. 
Also do not use them on or near a patch you are already wearing.  
If you need to stick the patch to a hairy area of skin, you must shave the area at least 3 days 
before sticking the patch there. 
If the edges of the patch lift, the patch may be taped down with adhesive medical tape. 
• 
• 
If the patch falls off, put on a new patch for the rest of the day – then replace the patch at the usual 
time. 
• 
• 
• 
Do not let the area of the patch get hot – for example too much sunlight, saunas, hot baths, 
heating pads or hot-water bottles. This is because the medicine may be released faster. If you 
think that too much heat has been applied, contact your doctor or pharmacist. 
Always check that the patch has not fallen off after activities such as bathing, showering or 
exercising. 
If the patch has irritated your skin, keep that area protected from direct sunlight. This is 
because it may change the colour of the skin. 
How to use the patch 
• 
• 
Each patch is packed in a separate sachet.  
Before opening the sachet decide where you are going to stick this new patch and check you 
have removed any old patch. 
Stick the Neupro patch onto your skin as soon as you have opened the sachet and removed the 
release liner. 
• 
128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. 
To open the sachet, hold the sachet 
in both hands. 
2.  
Peel apart the foil. 
3. 
Open the sachet. 
4. 
Take the patch out of the sachet. 
5.  
The sticky side of the patch is 
covered by a transparent release 
liner.  
•  Hold the patch in both hands 
with the release liner facing 
you. 
Bend the patch in half.  
6. 
• 
This makes the S-shaped break in 
the liner open up. 
7. 
• 
• 
Peel off one side of the 
release liner. 
Do not touch the sticky side 
of the patch with your 
fingers. 
129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8. 
• 
• 
• 
Hold the other half of the 
rigid release liner. 
Then put the sticky half of 
the patch onto your skin. 
Press the sticky side of the 
patch firmly into place. 
9. 
Fold back the other half of the 
patch and remove the other side of 
the release liner. 
10. 
• 
• 
Press the patch down firmly 
with the palm of your hand.  
Keep it pressed for about 
30 seconds.  
This makes sure the patch is 
touching the skin and the edges 
stick down well. 
11. 
Wash your hands with soap and 
water straight after handling the 
patch. 
• 
• 
How to take off a used patch 
• 
• 
Slowly and carefully peel off the used patch. 
Gently wash the area with warm water and mild soap. This will remove any stickiness that stays 
on your skin. You can also use a little baby oil to remove any stickiness that will not wash off. 
Do not use alcohol or other dissolving liquids – such as nail polish remover. These may irritate 
your skin. 
If you use more Neupro than you should 
Using higher doses of Neupro than your doctor has prescribed may cause side effects such as feeling 
sick (nausea) or vomiting, low blood pressure, seeing or hearing things that are not real 
(hallucinations), feeling confused, very sleepy, having involuntary movements and convulsions.  
In such cases, contact your doctor or hospital straight away. They will tell you what to do. 
If you forget to change the patch at your usual time 
• 
If you have forgotten to change the patch at your usual time, change it as soon as you remember. 
Take off the old patch and use a new one.  
If you have forgotten to stick on a new patch after removing the old one, use a new patch as 
soon as you remember.  
In both cases, use a new patch at the usual time on the following day. Do not use a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Neupro 
Do not stop using Neupro without talking to your doctor. A sudden stop could lead to a medical 
condition called ‘neuroleptic malignant syndrome’ which could be life-threatening. The signs include: 
loss of muscle movement (akinesia), rigid muscles, fever, unstable blood pressure, increased heart rate 
(tachycardia), confusion, low level of consciousness (such as a coma).  
130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If your doctor says you should stop Neupro, the daily dose should be lowered gradually: 
• 
Restless Legs Syndrome – lowered by 1 mg every other day. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Tell your 
doctor or pharmacist or nurse if you notice any side effects. 
Side effects more likely at the start of treatment  
You may feel sick (nausea) and vomit at the start of treatment. These effects are usually mild or 
moderate and only last for a short time. Talk to your doctor if they last for a long time or if you are 
worried about them. 
Skin problems caused by the patch 
• 
You may get redness and itching on the skin where the patch has been – these reactions are 
usually mild or moderate.  
The reactions normally go away after a few hours – once you remove the patch. 
Talk to your doctor if you have a skin reaction that lasts longer than a few days or is severe. 
Also do this if it spreads outside the area of skin that was covered by the patch. 
Avoid sunlight and solarium exposure on areas of skin showing any kind of skin reaction caused 
by the patch.  
To help avoid the skin reactions, you should put the patch on a different area of skin every day, 
and only use the same area again after 14 days. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Loss of consciousness can occur 
Neupro can cause loss of consciousness. This can happen especially when you start using Neupro or 
when your dose is increased. Tell your doctor if you lose consciousness or feel dizzy. 
Changes in behaviour and abnormal thinking 
Tell your doctor if you notice any changes in behaviour, thinking or both, that are listed below. 
They will discuss ways of managing or reducing symptoms.  
You may find it helpful to also tell a member of your family or carer that you are using this medicine 
and ask them to read this leaflet. This is so that your family or carer can tell you, or your doctor, if 
they are worried about any changes in your behaviour. Neupro can cause unusual urges or cravings 
which you cannot resist such as the impulse, drive or temptation to do things that could harm yourself 
or others.  
These may include: 
• 
• 
strong impulse to gamble too much – even if this seriously affects you or your family 
altered or increased sexual interest and behaviour which causes significant concern to you or 
others – for example, an increased sex drive 
uncontrolled shopping or spending too much 
binge eating (eating large amounts of food in a short period of time) or compulsive eating 
(eating more food than normal and more than is needed to satisfy your hunger). 
• 
• 
Neupro may cause other behaviours and abnormal thinking. These may include: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
abnormal thoughts about reality 
delusions and hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not real) 
confusion 
disorientation 
aggressive behaviour 
131 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
agitation 
delirium. 
Tell your doctor if you notice any changes in behaviour, thinking or both that are listed above. 
They will discuss ways of managing or reducing symptoms.  
Allergic reactions 
Contact your doctor if you notice signs of an allergic reaction – these can include swelling of the face, 
tongue or lips.

What to do with the used and unused patches

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Neupro is and what it is used for 
What Neupro is 
Neupro contains the active substance rotigotine.  
It belongs to a group of medicines called ‘dopamine agonists’. Dopamine is a messenger in the brain 
which is important for movement. 
What Neupro is used for  
Neupro is used in adults to treat the signs and symptoms of:  
• 
Parkinson’s disease – Neupro can be used on its own or with another medicine called 
levodopa. 
Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) – this can be associated with discomfort in your legs or arms, 
urge to move around, sleep disturbance and feeling tired or sleepy during the day. These 
symptoms are either reduced or their duration is shortened with Neupro treatment.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Neupro 
Do not use Neupro if: 
• 
you are allergic to rotigotine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
you need to have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (diagnostic pictures of the inside 
of the body, created using magnetic rather than x-ray energy)  
you need ‘cardioversion’ (specific treatment for abnormal heart beat). 
You must take your Neupro patch off just before undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or 
cardioversion to avoid skin burns because the patch contains aluminium. You can put a new patch on 
afterwards. 
If any of the above apply to you, do not use Neupro. If you are not sure about this, talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse first.

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Neupro. This is because: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
your blood pressure needs checking regularly while using Neupro, especially at the start of the 
treatment. Neupro may affect your blood pressure. 
your eyes need checking regularly while using Neupro. If you notice any problems with your 
eyesight between checks, talk to your doctor straight away. 
if you have serious liver problems, your doctor may need to change the dose. If your liver 
problems get worse during treatment, talk to your doctor straight away. 
you may get skin problems caused by the patch – see ‘Skin problems caused by the patch’ in 
section 4. 
you may feel very sleepy or fall asleep suddenly – see ‘Driving and using machines’ in 
section 2. 
you may get involuntary muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive movements or 
postures (dystonia), posture abnormal or sidewards bending of the back (also called 
pleurothotonus or Pisa Syndrome). If this happens, your doctor may want to adjust your 
medication. 
your symptoms of Restless Legs Syndrome may start earlier than usual, be more intense and 
involve other limbs. If you experience such symptoms either before or after beginning treatment 
with Neupro, contact your doctor as your treatment may need to be adjusted.  
Medicines used to treat Parkinson's disease and Restless Legs Syndrome should be reduced or stopped 
gradually. Tell your doctor if after stopping or reducing your Neupro treatment you experience 
symptoms such as depression, anxiety, fatigue, sweating or pain. 
Loss of consciousness can occur 
Neupro can cause loss of consciousness. This can happen especially when you start using Neupro or 
when your dose is increased. Tell your doctor if you lose consciousness or feel dizzy. 
Changes in behaviour and abnormal thinking 
Neupro can cause side effects that change your behaviour (how you act). You may find it helpful to 
tell a member of your family or carer that you are using this medicine and ask them to read this leaflet. 
This is so that your family or carer can tell you, or your doctor, if they are worried about any changes 
in your behaviour. 
These include:  
• 
 craving for large doses of Neupro or other medicines used to treat Parkinson's disease and 
Restless Legs Syndrome. 
• 
• 
unusual urges or cravings which you cannot resist and that could harm yourself or others – the 
symptoms are mainly seen in patients with Parkinson’s disease 
abnormal thinking or behaviour – most of the symptoms occur more frequently in patients with 
Parkinson’s disease. 
See ‘Changes to your behaviour and abnormal thinking’ in section 4 for more information. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children below 18 years of age because it is not known if it is safe or 
effective in this age group. 
Other medicines and Neupro 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. 
If you are treated with Neupro and levodopa at the same time, some side effects may get more serious. 
This includes seeing or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations), movements you cannot control 
related to Parkinson’s disease (‘dyskinesia’), and swelling of legs and feet. 
137 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not take the following medicines while using Neupro – because they may decrease its effect: 
• 
• 
‘anti-psychotic’ medicines – used to treat certain mental illnesses 
metoclopramide – used to treat nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting.  
Talk to your doctor before using Neupro if you are taking: 
• 
sedating medicines such as benzodiazepines or medicines used to treat mental illness or 
depression. 
medicines that lower blood pressure. Neupro may decrease blood pressure when you stand up – 
this effect may be worsened by the medicines used to lower blood pressure.  
• 
Your doctor will let you know if it is safe to keep taking these medicines while using Neupro. 
Neupro with food, drink and alcohol 
Because rotigotine enters your bloodstream through your skin, food or drink does not affect the way 
this medicine is absorbed by the body. You should discuss with your doctor if it is safe for you to 
drink alcohol while using Neupro. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Neupro if you are pregnant. This is because the effects of rotigotine on pregnancy and the 
unborn baby are not known.  
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Neupro. This is because rotigotine may pass into your breast 
milk and affect your baby. It is also likely to lower the amount of milk you produce. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Neupro may make you feel very sleepy and you may fall asleep very suddenly. If this happens, do not 
drive. In isolated cases, people have fallen asleep while driving and this has caused accidents. 
Also do not use tools or machines if you feel very sleepy – or do anything else which may put others 
or yourself at risk of serious injury. 
Neupro contains sodium metabisulphite (E223)  
Sodium metabisulphite (E223) may rarely cause severe hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions and 
bronchospasm (breathing distress caused by narrowing of the airways). 
3. 
How to use Neupro 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Which strength patches to use 
The dose of Neupro will depend on your illness – see below. 
Neupro is available in different strength patches which release the medicine over 24 hours. The 
strengths are 1 mg/24 h, 2 mg/24 h, 3 mg/24 h, 4 mg/24 h, 6 mg/24 h and 8 mg/24 h. The patches of 1 
mg/24 h and 3 mg/24 h are used for the treatment of Restless Leg Syndrome, while the patches of  
4 mg/24 h, 6 mg/24 h and 8 mg/24 h are used for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. The patches of 
2 mg/24 h are used for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and Restless Leg Syndrome. 
• 
• 
You may have to use more than one patch to reach your dose, as prescribed by your doctor.  
For doses higher than 8 mg/24 h (doses prescribed by your doctor above the available 
strengths), multiple patches must be applied to achieve the final dose. For example the daily 
dose of 10 mg may be reached by applying one patch of 6 mg/24 h and one patch of 4 mg/24 h.  
138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
The patches should not be cut into pieces.  
Treatment of Parkinson’s disease 
Patients not taking levodopa – early stage of Parkinson’s disease 
• 
Your starting daily dose will be one 2 mg/24 h patch each day.  
• 
From the second week your daily dose may be increased by 2 mg each week – until you get to 
the right maintenance dose for you.  
For most patients, the right dose is between 6 mg and 8 mg each day. This is normally reached 
within 3 to 4 weeks. 
The maximum dose is 8 mg each day. 
• 
• 
Patients taking levodopa – advanced stage of Parkinson’s disease 
• 
Your starting daily dose will be one 4 mg/24 h patch each day.  
• 
From the second week your daily dose will be increased by 2 mg each week – until you get to 
the right maintenance dose for you.  
For most patients, the right dose is between 8 mg and 16 mg each day. This is normally reached 
within 3 to 7 weeks. 
The maximum dose is 16 mg each day. 
• 
• 
Treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome 
• 
• 
Your starting dose will be one 1 mg/24 h patch each day.  
From the second week, your daily dose may be increased by 1 mg each week – until you get to 
the right maintenance dose for you. This is when you and your doctor agree that the symptoms 
are being controlled well enough and the side effects of the medicines are acceptable. 
The maximum dose is 3 mg per day. 
• 
If you have to stop taking this medicine, see ‘If you stop using Neupro’ in section 3. 
How to use the Neupro patches: 
Neupro is a patch that is put on the skin. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Make sure that you take the old patch off before putting on a new one. 
Stick the new patch on a different area of the skin each day.  
Leave the patch on your skin for 24 hours, then take it off and put on a new one.  
Change the patches at about the same time every day. 
Do not cut the Neupro patches into pieces. 
Where to stick the patch 
Put the sticky side of the patch onto clean, dry, 
healthy skin on the following areas as shown in grey on 
the pictures opposite:  
• 
• 
• 
Shoulder or upper arm. 
Belly. 
Flank (your side, between the ribs 
and hips). 
Thigh or hip. 
• 
139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To avoid skin irritation 
• 
Stick the patch onto a different area of skin each day. For 
example, put it on the right side of your body one day, then 
on the left side of your body the next day. Or on your upper 
body one day, then on your lower body the day after that.  
Do not stick Neupro on the same area of skin twice 
within 14 days. 
Do not stick the patch on broken or damaged skin – or on 
skin that is red or irritated. 
• 
• 
If you still get problems with your skin because of the patch, please see ‘Skin problems caused by 
the patch’ in section 4 for more information. 
To prevent the patch becoming loose or falling off 
• 
• 
Do not put the patch in an area where it can be rubbed by tight clothing. 
Do not use creams, oils, lotions, powders or other skin products where you will put the patch. 
Also do not use them on or near a patch you are already wearing.  
If you need to stick the patch to a hairy area of skin, you must shave the area at least 3 days 
before sticking the patch there. 
If the edges of the patch lift, the patch may be taped down with adhesive medical tape. 
• 
• 
If the patch falls off, put on a new patch for the rest of the day – then replace the patch at the usual 
time. 
• 
• 
• 
Do not let the area of the patch get hot – for example too much sunlight, saunas, hot baths, 
heating pads or hot-water bottles. This is because the medicine may be released faster. If you 
think that too much heat has been applied, contact your doctor or pharmacist. 
Always check that the patch has not fallen off after activities such as bathing, showering or 
exercising. 
If the patch has irritated your skin, keep that area protected from direct sunlight. This is 
because it may change the colour of the skin. 
How to use the patch 
• 
• 
Each patch is packed in a separate sachet.  
Before opening the sachet decide where you are going to stick this new patch and check you 
have removed any old patch. 
Stick the Neupro patch onto your skin as soon as you have opened the sachet and removed the 
release liner. 
• 
1. 
To open the sachet, hold the 
sachet in both hands.  
2.  
Peel apart the foil. 
140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
Open the sachet. 
4. 
Take the patch out of the sachet. 
5.  
The sticky side of the patch is 
covered by a transparent release 
liner.  
•  Hold the patch in both hands 
with the release liner facing 
you. 
Bend the patch in half.  
6. 
• 
This makes the S-shaped break in 
the liner open up. 
7. 
• 
• 
8. 
• 
• 
• 
Peel off one side of the 
release liner.  
Do not touch the sticky 
side of the patch with your 
fingers. 
Hold the other half of the 
rigid release liner.  
Then put the sticky half of 
the patch onto your skin.  
Press the sticky side of the 
patch firmly into place. 
9. 
Fold back the other half of the 
patch and remove the other side 
of the release liner. 
141 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10. 
• 
• 
Press the patch down 
firmly with the palm of 
your hand.  
Keep it pressed for about 
30 seconds.  
This makes sure the patch is 
touching the skin and the edges 
stick down well. 
11. 
Wash your hands with soap and 
water straight after handling the 
patch. 
How to take off a used patch 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Slowly and carefully peel off the used patch. 
Gently wash the area with warm water and mild soap. This will remove any stickiness that stays 
on your skin. You can also use a little baby oil to remove any stickiness that will not wash off. 
Do not use alcohol or other dissolving liquids – such as nail polish remover. These may irritate 
your skin. 
If you use more Neupro than you should 
Using higher doses of Neupro than your doctor has prescribed may cause side effects such as feeling 
sick (nausea) or vomiting, low blood pressure, seeing or hearing things that are not real 
(hallucinations), feeling confused, very sleepy, having involuntary movements and convulsions.  
In such cases, contact your doctor or hospital straight away. They will tell you what to do. 
If you forget to change the patch at your usual time 
• 
If you have forgotten to change the patch at your usual time, change it as soon as you remember 
Take off the old patch and use a new one.  
If you have forgotten to stick on a new patch after removing the old one, use a new patch as 
soon as you remember.  
In both cases, use a new patch at the usual time on the following day. Do not use a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Neupro 
Do not stop using Neupro without talking to your doctor. A sudden stop could lead to a medical 
condition called ‘neuroleptic malignant syndrome’ which could be life-threatening. The signs include: 
loss of muscle movement (akinesia), rigid muscles, fever, unstable blood pressure, increased heart rate 
(tachycardia), confusion, low level of consciousness (such as a coma).  
If your doctor says you should stop Neupro, the daily dose should be lowered gradually: 
• 
• 
Parkinson’s disease – lowered by 2 mg every other day. 
Restless Legs Syndrome – lowered by 1 mg every other day. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Tell your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you notice any side effects. 
142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Side effects more likely at the start of treatment  
You may feel sick (nausea) and vomit at the start of treatment. These effects are usually mild or 
moderate and only last for a short time. Talk to your doctor if they last for a long time or if you are 
worried about them. 
Skin problems caused by the patch 
• 
You may get redness and itching on the skin where the patch has been – these reactions are 
usually mild or moderate. 
The reactions normally go away after a few hours – once you remove the patch. 
Talk to your doctor if you have a skin reaction that lasts longer than a few days or is severe. 
Also do this if it spreads outside the area of skin that was covered by the patch. 
Avoid sunlight and solarium exposure on areas of skin showing any kind of skin reaction caused 
by the patch.  
To help avoid the skin reactions, you should put the patch on a different area of skin every day, 
and only use the same area again after 14 days. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Loss of consciousness can occur 
Neupro can cause loss of consciousness. This can happen especially when you start using Neupro or 
when your dose is increased. Tell your doctor if you lose consciousness or feel dizzy. 
Changes in behaviour and abnormal thinking 
Tell your doctor if you notice any changes in behaviour, thinking or both, that are listed below. 
They will discuss ways of managing or reducing symptoms.  
You may find it helpful to also tell a member of your family or carer that you are using this medicine 
and ask them to read this leaflet. This is so that your family or carer can tell you, or your doctor, if 
they are worried about any changes in your behaviour. Neupro can cause unusual urges or cravings 
which you cannot resist such as the impulse, drive or temptation to do things that could harm yourself 
or others – the symptoms are mainly seen in patients with Parkinson’s disease.  
These may include: 
• 
• 
strong impulse to gamble too much – even if this seriously affects you or your family 
altered or increased sexual interest and behaviour which causes significant concern to you or 
others – for example, an increased sex drive 
uncontrolled shopping or spending too much 
binge eating (eating large amounts of food in a short period of time) or compulsive eating 
(eating more food than normal and more than is needed to satisfy your hunger). 
• 
• 
Neupro may cause other behaviours and abnormal thinking. These may include: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
abnormal thoughts about reality 
delusions and hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not real) 
confusion 
disorientation 
aggressive behaviour 
agitation 
delirium.  
Tell your doctor if you notice any changes in behaviour, thinking or both that are listed above. 
They will discuss ways of managing or reducing symptoms.  
Allergic reactions 
Contact your doctor if you notice signs of an allergic reaction – these can include swelling of the face, 
tongue or lips.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Neupro is and what it is used for 
What Neupro is 
Neupro contains the active substance rotigotine.  
It belongs to a group of medicines called ‘dopamine agonists’. Dopamine is a messenger in the brain 
which is important for movement 
What Neupro is used for 
Neupro is used in adults to treat the signs and symptoms of:  
• 
Parkinson’s disease – Neupro can be used on its own or with another medicine called 
levodopa. 
149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you use Neupro 
Do not use Neupro if: 
• 
you are allergic to rotigotine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
you need to have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (diagnostic pictures of the inside 
of the body, created using magnetic rather than x-ray energy)  
you need ‘cardioversion’ (specific treatment for abnormal heart beat). 
You must take your Neupro patch off just before undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or 
cardioversion to avoid skin burns because the patch contains aluminium. You can put a new patch on 
afterwards. 
If any of the above apply to you, do not use Neupro. If you are not sure about this, talk to your doctor 
or pharmacist or nurse first. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Neupro. This is because: 
• 
your blood pressure needs checking regularly while using Neupro, especially at the start of the 
treatment. Neupro may affect your blood pressure. 
your eyes need checking regularly while using Neupro. If you notice any problems with your 
eyesight between checks, talk to your doctor straight away. 
if you have serious liver problems, your doctor may need to change the dose. If your liver 
problems get worse during treatment, talk to your doctor straight away. 
you may get skin problems caused by the patch – see ‘Skin problems caused by the patch’ in 
section 4. 
you may feel very sleepy or fall asleep suddenly – see ‘Driving and using machines’ in 
section 2. 
you may get involuntary muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive movements or 
postures (dystonia), posture abnormal or sidewards bending of the back (also called 
pleurothotonus or Pisa Syndrome). If this happens, your doctor may want to adjust your 
medication. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you experience these symptoms after beginning treatment with Neupro, contact your doctor. 
Medicines used to treat Parkinson's disease should be reduced or stopped gradually. Tell your doctor if 
after stopping or reducing your Neupro treatment you experience symptoms such as depression, 
anxiety, fatigue, sweating or pain. 
Loss of consciousness can occur 
Neupro can cause loss of consciousness. This can happen especially when you start using Neupro or 
when your dose is increased. Tell your doctor if you lose consciousness or feel dizzy. 
Changes in behaviour and abnormal thinking 
Neupro can cause side effects that change your behaviour (how you act). You may find it helpful to 
tell a member of your family or carer that you are using this medicine and ask them to read this leaflet. 
This is so that your family or carer can tell you, or your doctor, if they are worried about any changes 
in your behaviour. 
These include:  
• 
• 
• 
craving for large doses of Neupro or other medicines used to treat Parkinson's disease. 
unusual urges or cravings which you cannot resist and that could harm yourself or others 
abnormal thinking or behaviour. 
See ‘Changes to your behaviour and abnormal thinking’ in section 4 for more information. 
150 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children below 18 years of age because it is not known if it is safe or 
effective in this age group. 
Other medicines and Neupro 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. 
If you are treated with Neupro and levodopa at the same time, some side effects may get more serious. 
This includes seeing or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations), movements you cannot control 
related to Parkinson’s disease (‘dyskinesia’), and swelling of legs and feet. 
Do not take the following medicines while using Neupro – because they may decrease its effect:  
• 
• 
‘anti-psychotic’ medicines – used to treat certain mental illnesses 
metoclopramide – used to treat nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting.  
Talk to your doctor before using Neupro if you are taking: 
• 
sedating medicines such as benzodiazepines or medicines used to treat mental illness or 
depression. 
medicines that lower blood pressure. Neupro may decrease blood pressure when you stand up – 
this effect may be worsened by the medicines used to lower blood pressure. 
• 
Your doctor will let you know if it is safe to keep taking these medicines while using Neupro. 
Neupro with food, drink and alcohol 
Because rotigotine enters your bloodstream through your skin, food or drink does not affect the way 
this medicine is absorbed by the body. You should discuss with your doctor if it is safe for you to 
drink alcohol while using Neupro. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Neupro if you are pregnant. This is because the effects of rotigotine on pregnancy and the 
unborn baby are not known.  
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Neupro. This is because rotigotine may pass into your breast 
milk and affect your baby. It is also likely to lower the amount of milk you produce. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Neupro may make you feel very sleepy, and you may fall asleep very suddenly. If this happens, do not 
drive. In isolated cases, people have fallen asleep while driving and this has caused accidents. 
Also do not use tools or machines if you feel very sleepy – or do anything else which may put others 
or yourself at risk of serious injury. 
Neupro contains sodium metabisulphite (E223)  
Sodium metabisulphite (E223) may rarely cause severe hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions and 
bronchospasm (breathing distress caused by narrowing of the airways). 
3. 
How to use Neupro 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Which strength patches to use 
The dose of Neupro will depend on your illness – see below. 
Neupro is available in different strength patches which release the medicine over 24 hours. The 
strengths are 2 mg/24 h, 4 mg/24 h, 6 mg/24 h and 8 mg/24 h for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.  
• 
• 
• 
You may have to use more than one patch to reach your dose, as prescribed by your doctor. 
For doses higher than 8 mg/24 h (doses prescribed by your doctor above the available 
strengths), multiple patches must be applied to achieve the final dose. For example a daily dose 
of 10 mg/24 h may be reached by applying one patch of 6 mg/24 h and one patch of 4 mg/24 h. 
The patches should not be cut into pieces. 
Treatment of Parkinson’s disease 
Patients not taking levodopa – early stage of Parkinson’s disease 
• 
Your starting daily dose will be one 2 mg/24 h patch each day.  
• 
From the second week your daily dose may be increased by 2 mg each week – until you get to 
the right maintenance dose for you.  
For most patients, the right dose is between 6 mg and 8 mg each day. This is normally reached 
within 3 to 4 weeks. 
The maximum dose is 8 mg each day. 
• 
• 
Patients taking levodopa – advanced stage of Parkinson’s disease 
• 
Your starting daily dose will be one 4 mg/24 h patch each day.  
• 
From the second week your daily dose will be increased by 2 mg each week – until you get to 
the right maintenance dose for you.  
For most patients, the right dose is between 8 mg and 16 mg each day. This is normally reached 
within 3 to 7 weeks. 
The maximum dose is 16 mg each day. 
• 
• 
If you have to stop taking this medicine, see ‘If you stop using Neupro’ in section 3. 
How to use the Neupro patches 
Neupro is a patch that is put on the skin. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Make sure that you take the old patch off before putting on a new one. 
Stick the new patch on a different area of the skin each day.  
Leave the patch on your skin for 24 hours, then take it off and put on a new one.  
Change the patches at about the same time every day. 
Do not cut the Neupro patches into pieces. 
Where to stick the patch 
Put the sticky side of the patch onto clean, dry, 
healthy skin on the following areas as shown in grey on 
the pictures opposite:  
Shoulder or upper arm. 
• 
•  Belly. 
• 
Flank (your side, between the ribs 
and hips). 
•  Thigh or hip. 
152 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To avoid skin irritation 
• 
Stick the patch onto a different area of skin each day. For 
example, put it on the right side of your body one day, then 
on the left side of your body the next day. Or on your upper 
body one day, then on your lower body the day after that.  
Do not stick Neupro on the same area of skin twice 
within 14 days. 
Do not stick the patch on broken or damaged skin – or on 
skin that is red or irritated. 
• 
• 
If you still get problems with your skin because of the patch, please see Skin problems caused by the 
patch’ in section 4 for more information. 
To prevent the patch becoming loose or falling off 
• 
• 
Do not put the patch in an area where it can be rubbed by tight clothing. 
Do not use creams, oils, lotions, powders or other skin products where you will put the patch. 
Also do not use them on or near a patch you are already wearing.  
If you need to stick the patch to a hairy area of skin, you must shave the area at least 3 days 
before sticking the patch there. 
If the edges of the patch lift, the patch may be taped down with adhesive medical tape. 
• 
• 
If the patch falls off, put on a new patch for the rest of the day – then replace the patch at the usual 
time. 
• 
• 
• 
Do not let the area of the patch get hot – for example too much sunlight, saunas, hot baths, 
heating pads or hot-water bottles. This is because the medicine may be released faster. If you 
think that too much heat has been applied, contact your doctor or pharmacist. 
Always check that the patch has not fallen off after activities such as bathing, showering or 
exercising. 
If the patch has irritated your skin, keep that area protected from direct sunlight. This is 
because it may change the colour of the skin. 
How to use the patch 
• 
• 
Each patch is packed in a separate sachet.  
Before opening the sachet decide where you are going to stick this new patch and check you 
have removed any old patch. 
Stick the Neupro patch onto your skin as soon as you have opened the sachet and removed the 
release liner. 
• 
1. 
To open the sachet, hold the 
sachet in both hands.  
2.  
Peel apart the foil. 
153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
Open the sachet. 
4. 
Take the patch out of the 
sachet. 
5.  
The sticky side of the patch is 
covered by a transparent 
release liner.  
•  Hold the patch in both 
hands with the release 
liner facing you. 
Bend the patch in half.  
6. 
• 
This makes the S-shaped 
break in the liner open up. 
7. 
• 
• 
8. 
• 
• 
• 
Peel off one side of the 
release liner.  
Do not touch the sticky 
side of the patch with 
your fingers. 
Hold the other half of 
the rigid release liner.  
Then put the sticky half 
of the patch onto your 
skin.  
Press the sticky side of 
the patch firmly into 
place. 
9. 
Fold back the other half of the 
patch and remove the other 
side of the release liner. 
154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10. 
• 
• 
Press the patch down 
firmly with the palm of 
your hand.  
Keep it pressed for 
about 30 seconds.  
This makes sure the patch is 
touching the skin and the 
edges stick down well. 
11. 
Wash your hands with soap 
and water straight after 
handling the patch. 
How to take off a used patch 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Slowly and carefully peel off the used patch. 
Gently wash the area with warm water and mild soap. This will remove any stickiness that stays 
on your skin. You can also use a little baby oil to remove any stickiness that will not wash off. 
Do not use alcohol or other dissolving liquids – such as nail polish remover. These may irritate 
your skin. 
If you use more Neupro than you should 
Using higher doses of Neupro than your doctor has prescribed may cause side effects such as feeling 
sick (nausea) or vomiting, low blood pressure, seeing or hearing things that are not real 
(hallucinations), feeling confused, very sleepy, having involuntary movements and convulsions.  
In such cases, contact your doctor or hospital straight away. They will tell you what to do. 
If you forget to change the patch at your usual time 
• 
If you have forgotten to change the patch at your usual time, change it as soon as you remember. 
Take off the old patch and use a new one.  
If you have forgotten to stick on a new patch after removing the old one, use a new patch as 
soon as you remember. 
In both cases, use a new patch at the usual time on the following day. Do not use a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Neupro 
Do not stop using Neupro without talking to your doctor. A sudden stop could lead to a medical 
condition called ‘neuroleptic malignant syndrome’ which could be life-threatening. The signs include: 
loss of muscle movement (akinesia), rigid muscles, fever, unstable blood pressure, increased heart rate 
(tachycardia), confusion, low level of consciousness (such as a coma).  
If your doctor says you should stop Neupro, the daily dose should be lowered gradually: 
• 
Parkinson’s disease – lowered by 2 mg every other day. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Tell your 
doctor or pharmacist or nurse if you notice any side effects. 
Side effects more likely at the start of treatment 
You may feel sick (nausea) and vomit at the start of treatment. These effects are usually mild or 
moderate and only last for a short time. Talk to your doctor if they last for a long time or if you are 
worried about them. 
155 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skin problems caused by the patch 
• 
You may get redness and itching on the skin where the patch has been – these reactions are 
usually mild or moderate. 
The reactions normally go away after a few hours – once you remove the patch. 
Talk to your doctor if you have a skin reaction that lasts longer than a few days or is severe. 
Also do this if it spreads outside the area of skin that was covered by the patch. 
Avoid sunlight and solarium exposure on areas of skin showing any kind of skin reaction caused 
by the patch.  
To help avoid the skin reactions, you should put the patch on a different area of skin every day, 
and only use the same area again after 14 days. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Loss of consciousness can occur 
Neupro can cause loss of consciousness. This can happen especially when you start using Neupro or 
when your dose is increased. Tell your doctor if you lose consciousness or feel dizzy. 
Changes in behaviour and abnormal thinking 
Tell your doctor if you notice any changes in behaviour, thinking or both, that are listed below. 
They will discuss ways of managing or reducing symptoms.  
You may find it helpful to also tell a member of your family or carer that you are using this medicine 
and ask them to read this leaflet. This is so that your family or carer can tell you, or your doctor, if 
they are worried about any changes in your behaviour. Neupro can cause unusual urges or cravings 
which you cannot resist such as the impulse, drive or temptation to do things that could harm yourself 
or others.  
These may include: 
• 
• 
strong impulse to gamble too much – even if this seriously affects you or your family 
altered or increased sexual interest and behaviour which causes significant concern to you or 
others – for example, an increased sex drive 
uncontrolled shopping or spending too much 
binge eating (eating large amounts of food in a short period of time) or compulsive eating 
(eating more food than normal and more than is needed to satisfy your hunger). 
• 
• 
Neupro may cause other behaviours and abnormal thinking. These may include: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
abnormal thoughts about reality 
delusions and hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not real) 
confusion 
disorientation 
aggressive behaviour 
agitation 
delirium.  
Tell your doctor if you notice any changes in behaviour, thinking or both that are listed above. 
They will discuss ways of managing or reducing symptoms.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Neupro is and what it is used for 
What Neupro is 
Neupro contains the active substance rotigotine.  
It belongs to a group of medicines called ‘dopamine agonists’. Dopamine is a messenger in the brain 
which is important for movement. 
What Neupro is used for 
Neupro is used in adults to treat the signs and symptoms of:  
• 
Parkinson’s disease – Neupro can be used on its own or with another medicine called 
levodopa. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Neupro 
Do not use Neupro if: 
• 
you are allergic to rotigotine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
you need to have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (diagnostic pictures of the inside 
of the body, created using magnetic rather than x-ray energy)  
you need ‘cardioversion’ (specific treatment for abnormal heart beat). 
• 
• 
You must take your Neupro patch off just before undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or 
cardioversion to avoid skin burns because the patch contains aluminium. You can put a new patch on 
afterwards. 
161 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If any of the above apply to you, do not use Neupro. If you are not sure about this, talk to your doctor 
or pharmacist or nurse first. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Neupro. This is because 
• 
your blood pressure needs checking regularly while using Neupro, especially at the start of the 
treatment. Neupro may affect your blood pressure. 
your eyes need checking regularly while using Neupro. If you notice any problems with your 
eyesight between checks, talk to your doctor straight away. 
if you have serious liver problems, your doctor may need to change the dose. If your liver 
problems get worse during treatment, talk to your doctor straight away. 
you may get skin problems caused by the patch – see ‘Skin problems caused by the patch’ in 
section 4. 
you may feel very sleepy or fall asleep suddenly – see ‘Driving and using machines’ in 
section 2. 
you may get involuntary muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive movements or 
postures (dystonia), posture abnormal or sidewards bending of the back (also called 
pleurothotonus or Pisa Syndrome). If this happens, your doctor may want to adjust your 
medication. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you experience these symptoms after beginning treatment with Neupro, contact your doctor. 
Medicines used to treat Parkinson's disease should be reduced or stopped gradually. Tell your doctor if 
after stopping or reducing your Neupro treatment you experience symptoms such as depression, 
anxiety, fatigue, sweating or pain. 
Loss of consciousness can occur 
Neupro can cause loss of consciousness. This can happen especially when you start using Neupro or 
when your dose is increased. Tell your doctor if you lose consciousness or feel dizzy. 
Changes in behaviour and abnormal thinking 
Neupro can cause side effects that change your behaviour (how you act). You may find it helpful to 
tell a member of your family or carer that you are using this medicine and ask them to read this leaflet. 
This is so that your family or carer can tell you, or your doctor, if they are worried about any changes 
in your behaviour. 
These include:  
• 
• 
• 
craving for large doses of Neupro or other medicines used to treat Parkinson’s disease. 
unusual urges or cravings which you cannot resist and that could harm yourself or others 
abnormal thinking or behaviour. 
See ‘Changes to your behaviour and abnormal thinking’ in section 4 for more information. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children below 18 years of age because it is not known if it is safe or 
effective in this age group. 
Other medicines and Neupro 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. 
If you are treated with Neupro and levodopa at the same time, some side effects may get more serious. 
This includes seeing or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations), movements you cannot control 
related to Parkinson’s disease (‘dyskinesia’), and swelling of legs and feet. 
162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not take the following medicines while using Neupro – because they may decrease its effect:  
• 
• 
‘anti-psychotic’ medicines – used to treat certain mental illnesses 
metoclopramide – used to treat nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting.  
Talk to your doctor before using Neupro if you are taking: 
• 
sedating medicines such as benzodiazepines or medicines used to treat mental illness or 
depression. 
medicines that lower blood pressure. Neupro may decrease blood pressure when you stand up – 
this effect may be worsened by the medicines used to lower blood pressure.  
• 
Your doctor will let you know if it is safe to keep taking these medicines while using Neupro. 
Neupro with food, drink and alcohol 
Because rotigotine enters your bloodstream through your skin, food or drink does not affect the way 
this medicine is absorbed by the body. You should discuss with your doctor if it is safe for you to 
drink alcohol while using Neupro. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Neupro if you are pregnant. This is because the effects of rotigotine on pregnancy and the 
unborn baby are not known.  
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Neupro. This is because rotigotine may pass into your breast 
milk and affect your baby. It is also likely to lower the amount of milk you produce. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Neupro may make you feel very sleepy and you may fall asleep very suddenly. If this happens, do not 
drive. In isolated cases people have fallen asleep while driving and this has caused accidents. 
Also do not use tools or machines if you feel very sleepy – or do anything else which may put others 
or yourself at risk of serious injury. 
Neupro contains sodium metabisulphite (E223) 
Sodium metabisulphite (E223) may rarely cause severe hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions and 
bronchospasm (breathing distress caused by narrowing of the airways). 
3. 
How to use Neupro 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Which strength patches to use 
The dose of Neupro will depend on your illness – see below. 
Neupro is available in different strength patches which release the medicine over 24 hours. The 
strengths are 2 mg/24 h, 4 mg/24 h, 6 mg/24 h and 8 mg/24 h for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. 
You may have to use more than one patch to reach your dose, as prescribed by your doctor. 
The Neupro treatment initiation pack contains 4 different packages (one for each strength) with 
7 patches in each package. These packages are usually needed for the first four weeks of therapy, but 
depending on your response to Neupro, you may not need to use all of the dose packages included or 
you may need additional higher doses after week 4, which are not covered by this package.  
163 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On the first day of treatment, start with Neupro 2 mg (package marked “Week 1”), and use one 
Neupro 2 mg transdermal patch daily. You should take Neupro 2 mg for 7 days 
(e.g. if you start on a Sunday, switch to the next dose on the following Sunday).  
At the beginning of the second week, you should take Neupro 4 mg (package marked with “Week 2”). 
At the beginning of the third week, you should take Neupro 6 mg (package marked with “Week 3”). 
At the beginning of the fourth week, you should take Neupro 8 mg (package marked with “Week 4”). 
The right dose for you will depend on your needs. 
4 mg of Neupro every day may be an effective dose for some patients. For most patients with early 
stage Parkinson’s disease, the right dose is reached within 3 or 4 weeks, at doses of 6 mg per day or 
8 mg per day, respectively. The maximum dose is 8 mg per day. For most patients with advanced-
stage Parkinson’s disease the right dose is reached within 3 to 7 weeks, at doses of 8 mg per day up to 
a maximum dose of 16 mg per day. For doses higher than 8 mg/24 h (doses prescribed by your doctor 
above the available strengths), multiple patches must be applied to achieve the final dose. For 
example, a daily dose of 14 mg can be reached by applying one patch of 6 mg/24 h and one patch of 8 
mg/24 h and likewise, a daily dose of 16 mg can be reached by applying two patches of 8 mg/24 h. 
If you have to stop taking this medicine see ‘If you stop using Neupro’ in section 3. 
How to use the Neupro patches  
Neupro is a patch that is put on the skin. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Make sure that you take the old patch off before putting on a new one. 
Stick the new patch on a different area of the skin each day.  
Leave the patch on your skin for 24 hours, then take it off and put on a new one.  
Change the patch at about the same time every day. 
Do not cut the Neupro patches into pieces. 
Where to stick the patch 
Put the sticky side of the patch onto clean, dry, 
healthy skin on the following areas as shown in grey on 
the pictures opposite:  
Shoulder or upper arm. 
• 
•  Belly. 
• 
Flank (your side, between the ribs 
and hips). 
•  Thigh or hip. 
To avoid skin irritation 
• 
Stick the patch onto a different area of skin each day. For 
example, put it on the right side of your body one day, then 
on the left side of your body the next day. Or on your upper 
body one day, then on your lower body the day after that.  
Do not stick Neupro on the same area of skin twice 
within 14 days. 
Do not stick the patch on broken or damaged skin – or on 
skin that is red or irritated. 
• 
• 
If you still get problems with your skin because of the patch, please see ‘Skin problems caused by 
the patch’ in section 4 for more information. 
To prevent the patch becoming loose or falling off 
• 
• 
Do not put the patch in an area where it can be rubbed by tight clothing. 
Do not use creams, oils, lotions, powders or other skin products where you will put the patch. 
Also do not use them on or near a patch you are already wearing.  
164 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
If you need to stick the patch to a hairy area of skin, you must shave the area at least 3 days 
before sticking the patch there. 
If the edges of the patch lift, the patch may be taped down with adhesive medical tape. 
If the patch falls off, put on a new patch for the rest of the day – then replace the patch at the usual 
time. 
• 
• 
• 
Do not let the area of the patch get hot – for example too much sunlight, saunas, hot baths, 
heating pads or hot-water bottles. This is because the medicine may be released faster. If you 
think that too much heat has been applied, contact your doctor or pharmacist. 
Always check that the patch has not fallen off after activities such as bathing, showering or 
exercising. 
If the patch has irritated your skin, keep that area protected from direct sunlight. This is 
because it may change the colour of the skin. 
How to use the patch 
• 
• 
Each patch is packed in a separate sachet.  
Before opening the sachet decide where you are going to stick this new patch and check you 
have removed any old patch. 
Stick the Neupro patch onto your skin as soon as you have opened the sachet and removed the 
release liner. 
• 
1. 
To open the sachet, hold the 
sachet in both hands.  
2.  
Peel apart the foil. 
3. 
Open the sachet. 
4. 
Take the patch out of the sachet. 
165 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.  
The sticky side of the patch is 
covered by a transparent release 
liner.  
•  Hold the patch in both 
hands with the release liner 
facing you. 
Bend the patch in half.  
6. 
• 
This makes the S-shaped break 
in the liner open up. 
7. 
• 
• 
8. 
• 
• 
• 
Peel off one side of the 
release liner.  
Do not touch the sticky 
side of the patch with 
your fingers. 
Hold the other half of the 
rigid release liner.  
Then put the sticky half 
of the patch onto your 
skin.  
Press the sticky side of 
the patch firmly into 
place. 
9. 
Fold back the other half of the 
patch and remove the other side 
of the release liner. 
10. 
• 
• 
Press the patch down 
firmly with the palm of 
your hand.  
Keep it pressed for about 
30 seconds.  
This makes sure the patch is 
touching the skin and the edges 
stick down well. 
11. 
Wash your hands with soap and 
water straight after handling the 
patch. 
166 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How to take off a used patch 
• 
• 
Slowly and carefully peel off the used patch. 
Gently wash the area with warm water and mild soap. This will remove any stickiness that stays 
on your skin. You can also use a little baby oil to remove any stickiness that will not wash off. 
Do not use alcohol or other dissolving liquids – such as nail polish remover. These may irritate 
your skin. 
• 
If you use more Neupro than you should 
Using higher doses of Neupro than your doctor has prescribed may cause side effects such as feeling 
sick (nausea) or vomiting, low blood pressure, seeing or hearing things that are not real 
(hallucinations), feeling confused, very sleepy, having involuntary movements and convulsions. In 
such cases, contact your doctor or hospital straight away. They will tell you what to do. 
If you have used a different patch (e.g. Neupro 4 mg/24 h instead of Neupro 2 mg/24 h) than your 
doctor told you to, contact your doctor or hospital for advice immediately, and follow their advice on 
changes of patches. 
If you have any unpleasant reactions, contact your doctor. 
If you forget to change the patch at your usual time 
• 
If you have forgotten to change the patch at your usual time, change it as soon as you remember. 
Take off the old patch and use a new one.  
If you have forgotten to stick on a new patch after removing the old one, use a new patch as 
soon as you remember.  
• 
In both cases, use a new patch at the usual time on the following day. Do not use a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Neupro 
Do not stop using Neupro without talking to your doctor. A sudden stop could lead to a medical 
condition called ‘neuroleptic malignant syndrome’ which could be life-threatening. The signs include: 
loss of muscle movement (akinesia), rigid muscles, fever, unstable blood pressure, increased heart rate 
(tachycardia), confusion, low level of consciousness (such as a coma).  
If your doctor says you should stop Neupro, the daily dose of Neupro should be lowered gradually: 
• 
Parkinson’s disease – lowered by 2 mg every other day. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Tell your 
doctor or pharmacist or nurse if you notice any side effects. 
Side effects more likely at the start of treatment 
You may feel sick (nausea) and vomit at the start of treatment. These effects are usually mild or 
moderate and only last for a short time. Talk to your doctor if they last for a long time or if you are 
worried about them. 
Skin problems caused by the patch 
• 
You may get redness and itching on the skin where the patch has been – these reactions are 
usually mild or moderate. 
The reactions normally go away after a few hours – once you remove the patch. 
Talk to your doctor if you have a skin reaction that lasts longer than a few days or is severe. 
Also do this if it spreads outside the area of skin that was covered by the patch.

• 
Avoid sunlight and solarium exposure on areas of skin showing any kind of skin reaction caused 
by the patch.  
To help avoid the skin reactions, you should put the patch on a different area of skin every day, 
and only use the same area again after 14 days. 
Loss of consciousness can occur 
Neupro can cause loss of consciousness. This can happen especially when you start using Neupro or 
when your dose is increased. Tell your doctor if you lose consciousness or feel dizzy.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for rotigotine, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
In  view  of  available  data  on  ‘Dystonic  reactions  including  Pisa  syndrome’  from  clinical  trials, 
spontaneous  reports,  including  33  cases  with  positive  dechallenge  (29/33 medically  confirmed),  of 
which 28 where in Parkinson disease, 18 relevant literature articles (2 on rotigotine and 16 on other 
nonergolinic  dopamine  agonists  -  DAs)  and  a  plausible  mechanism  of  action,  the  PRAC  considers 
that a warning on dystonics reaction is justified. The PRAC concluded that the product information 
of  products  containing  rotigotine  for  the  therapeutic  indication  ‘Parkinson  Disease’,  regardless  of 
the dosage, should be amended accordingly. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall 
conclusions and grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for rotigotine the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing rotigotine is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

4.1    Therapeutic indications   
Wakix is indicated in adults, adolescents and children from the age of 6 years for the treatment of 
narcolepsy with or without cataplexy (see also section 5.1).   
4.2    Posology and method of administration   
Treatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in the treatment of sleep disorders.   
Posology   
Adults 
Wakix should be used at the lowest effective dose, depending on individual patient response and 
tolerance, according to an up-titration scheme, without exceeding the dose of 36 mg/day:    
-  Week 1: initial dose of 9 mg (two 4.5 mg tablets) per day.   
- 
Week 2: the dose may be increased to 18 mg (one 18 mg tablet) per day or decreased to 4.5 mg 
(one 4.5 mg tablet) per day.

-  Week 3: the dose may be increased to 36 mg (two 18 mg tablets) per day.   
At any time the dose can be decreased (down to 4.5 mg per day) or increased (up to 36 mg per day) 
according to the physician assessment and the patient’s response.   
The total daily dose should be administered as a single dose in the morning during breakfast.   
Maintenance of efficacy 
As long-term efficacy data are limited (see section 5.1), the continued efficacy of treatment should be 
regularly evaluated by the physician. 
Special populations   
Elderly   
Limited data are available in elderly. Therefore, dosing should be adjusted according to their renal and 
hepatic status.   
Renal impairment   
In patients with renal impairment, the maximum daily dose should be 18 mg.   
Hepatic impairment   
In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) two weeks after initiation of treatment, 
the daily dose can be increased without exceeding a maximal dose of 18 mg (see section 5.2).   
Pitolisant is contra-indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) (see section 
4.3).  
No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment.  
Paediatric population   
Wakix should be used at the optimal dose, depending on individual patient response and tolerance, 
according to an up-titration scheme, without exceeding the dose of 36 mg/day (18 mg/day in children 
weighing less than 40 kg).  
-  Week 1: initial dose of 4.5 mg (one 4.5 mg tablet) per day.   
- 
- 
-  Week 4: in children weighing 40 kg and above, the dose may be increased to 36 mg (two 18 mg 
tablets) per day.   
Week 2: the dose may be increased to 9 mg (two 4.5mg tablets) per day.   
Week 3: the dose may be increased to 18 mg (one 18 mg tablet) per day.   
At any time, the dose can be decreased (down to 4.5 mg per day) or increased (up to 36 mg per day in 
children weighing 40 kg and above or 18 mg per day in children weighing less than 40 kg) according 
to the physician assessment and the patient’s response.   
The total daily dose should be administered as a single dose in the morning during breakfast.   
Poor metabolizers 
By comparison to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers, higher systemic exposure (up to 3 fold) is 
observed in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers. In the up-titration scheme, dose increment should take into 
account this higher exposure. 
Method of administration  
For oral use. 
4.3    Contraindications

4.4    Special warnings and precautions for use   
Psychiatric disorders   
Pitolisant should be administered with caution in patients with history of psychiatric disorders such as 
severe anxiety or severe depression with suicidal ideation risk. Suicidal ideation has been reported in 
patients with psychiatric history treated with pitolisant. 
Hepatic or renal impairment   
Pitolisant should be administered with caution in patients with either renal impairment or moderate 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) and dosing regimen should be adapted according to section 4.2.    
Gastrointestinal disorders   
Gastric disorders reactions have been reported with pitolisant, therefore it should be administered with 
caution in patients with acid related gastric disorders (see section 4.8) or when co-administered with 
gastric irritants such as corticosteroids or NSAID.   
Nutrition disorders   
Pitolisant should be administered with caution in patients with severe obesity or severe anorexia (see 
section 4.8). In case of significant weight change, treatment should be re-evaluated by the physician.   
Cardiac disorders   
In two dedicated QT studies, supra-therapeutic doses of pitolisant (3-6-times the therapeutic dose, that 
is 108 mg to 216 mg) produced mild to moderate prolongation of QTc interval (10-13 ms). In clinical 
trials, no specific cardiac safety signal was identified at therapeutic doses of pitolisant. Nevertheless, 
patients with cardiac disease, co-medicated with other QT-prolonging medicinal products or known to 
increase the risk of repolarization disorders, or co-medicated with medicinal products that significantly 
increase pitolisant Cmax and AUC ratio (see section 4.5) or patients with severe renal or moderate 
hepatic impairment (see section 4.4) should be carefully monitored (see section 4.5).   
Epilepsy  
Convulsions were reported at high doses in animal models (see section 5.3). In clinical trials, one 
epilepsy aggravation was reported in one epileptic patient. Caution should be taken for patients with 
severe epilepsy.   
Women of childbearing potential  
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and at least up 
to 21 days after treatment discontinuation (based on pitolisant/metabolites half-life). Pitolisant may 
reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, an alternative method of effective 
contraception should be used if the woman patient is using hormonal contraceptives (see sections 4.5 
and 4.6).  
Drug-drug interactions  
The combination of pitolisant with substrates of CYP3A4 and having a narrow therapeutic margin 
should be avoided (see section 4.5).  
Rebound effect 
4   
   
   
 
   
 
   
 
   
 
   
 
   
 
   
 
 
 
 
No rebound effect was reported during clinical trials. However, treatment discontinuation should be 
monitored. 
Drug abuse 
Pitolisant showed absence or low abuse potential according to clinical data (specific human abuse 
potential study at doses from 36 up to 216 mg in adults and observed abuse-related adverse effects in 
phase 3 studies). 
4.5    Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction   
Antidepressants   
Tri or tetracyclic antidepressants (e.g. imipramine, clomipramine, mirtazapine) may impair the 
efficacy of pitolisant because they display histamine H1-receptor antagonist activity and possibly 
cancel the effect of endogenous histamine released in brain by the treatment.   
Anti-histamines   
Anti-histamines (H1-receptor antagonists) crossing the haemato-encephalic barrier (e.g. pheniramine 
maleate, chlorpheniramine, diphenydramine, promethazine, mepyramine, doxylamine) may impair the 
efficacy of pitolisant.   
QT-prolonging substances or known to increase the risk of repolarization disorders  
Combination with pitolisant should be made with a careful monitoring (see section 4.4).  
Pharmacokinetic interactions   
Medicinal products affecting pitolisant metabolism  
Enzyme inducers   
- 
Co-administration of pitolisant with rifampicin in multiple doses significantly decreases pitolisant 
mean Cmax and AUC ratio about 39% and 50%, respectively. Therefore, co-administration of pitolisant 
with potent CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) should be 
done with caution. With St John’s Wort (Hypericum Perforatum), due to its strong CYP3A4 inducing 
effect, caution should be exercised when taken concurrently with pitolisant. A clinical monitoring 
should be made when both active substances are combined and, eventually a dosage adjustment during 
the combination and one week after the inducer treatment.   
In a clinical multiple dose study, the combination of pitolisant with probenecid decreases the AUC of 
pitolisant by about 34%. 
CYP2D6 inhibitors   
- 
Co-administration of pitolisant with paroxetine significantly increases pitolisant mean Cmax and 
AUC0—72h ratio about 47% and 105%, respectively. Given the 2-fold increase of pitolisant exposure, its 
coadministration with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. paroxetine, fluoxetine, venlafaxine, duloxetine, 
bupropion, quinidine, terbinafine, cinacalcet) should be done with caution. A dosage adjustment 
during the combination could eventually be considered.   
Medicinal products that pitolisant may affect metabolism  
CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 substrates  
- 
Based on in vitro data, pitolisant and its main metabolites may induce CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 at 
therapeutic concentrations and by extrapolation, CYP2C, UGTs and P-gp. No clinical data on the 
magnitude of this interaction are available. Therefore, the combination of pitolisant with substrates of 
CYP3A4 and having a narrow therapeutic margin (e.g. immunosuppressants, docetaxel, kinase 
5   
 
 
 
 
   
 
   
 
   
 
  
 
  
   
   
  
inhibitors, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine) should be avoided (see section 4.4). With other CYP3A4, 
CYP2B6 (e.g. efavirenz, bupropion), CYP2C (e.g. repaglinide, phenytoin, warfarin), P-gp (e.g. 
dabigatran, digoxin) and UGT (e.g. morphine, paracetamol, irinotecan) substrates, caution should be 
made with a clinical monitoring of their efficacy.   
With oral contraceptives, the combination with pitolisant should be avoided and a further reliable 
contraceptive method used.  
Substrates of OCT1   
- 
Pitolisant shows greater than 50% inhibition towards OCT1 (organic cation transporters 1) at 
1.33 µM, the extrapolated IC50 of pitolisant is 0.795 µM.   
Even if the clinical relevance of this effect is not established, caution is advised when pitolisant is 
administered with a substrate of OCT1 (e.g. metformin (biguanides)) (see section 5.2).   
The combination of pitolisant with modafinil or sodium oxybate, usual treatments of narcolepsy was 
evaluated in healthy volunteers, at therapeutic doses. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug-drug 
interaction was evidenced either with modafinil or with sodium oxybate. 
Paediatric population   
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.   
4.6    Fertility, pregnancy and lactation   
Women of childbearing potential   
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and at least up 
to 21 days after treatment discontinuation (based on pitolisant/metabolites half-life). 
Pitolisant/metabolites may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, an 
alternative method of effective contraception should be used if the woman is using hormonal 
contraceptives (see section 4.5).   
Pregnancy   
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of pitolisant in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity, including teratogenicity. In rats, pitolisant/metabolites were 
shown to cross the placenta (see section 5.3).  
Pitolisant should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk 
for foetus.  
Breast-feeding   
Animal study has shown excretion of pitolisant/metabolites in milk. Therefore, breastfeeding is 
contraindicated during treatment with pitolisant (see section 4.3).   
Fertility   
Study in animals has shown effects on semen parameters, without a significant impact on reproductive 
performance in males and reduction on the percentage of live foetuses in treated females (see section 
5.3).   
4.7    Effects on ability to drive and use machines   
Pitolisant has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

Patients with abnormal levels of sleepiness who take pitolisant should be advised that their level of 
wakefulness may not return to normal. Patients with excessive daytime sleepiness, including those 
taking pitolisant should be frequently reassessed for their degree of sleepiness and, if appropriate, 
advised to avoid driving or any other potentially dangerous activity.

Description of selected adverse reactions   
Headache and insomnia   
During clinical studies, episodes of headache and insomnia have been reported (7.7 % to 8.4%). Most 
of these adverse reactions were mild to moderate. If symptoms persist a reduced daily dose or 
discontinuation should be considered.   
Gastric disorders 
Gastric disorders caused by hyperacidity have been reported during clinical studies in 3.5% of the 
patients receiving pitolisant. These effects were mostly mild to moderate. If they persist a corrective 
treatment with proton pump inhibitor could be initiated.   
Paediatric population (Age 6 to 17) 
The paediatric population has been studied in a double-blind multicentre randomized placebo-
controlled trial; a total of 73 children and adolescents with narcolepsy with or without cataplexy were 
treated with pitolisant for 8 weeks.  
Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children and adolescents were similar to that of 
adults. The most frequent related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in this population were 
headache (11%), insomnia (5.5%), hypertension (2.7%). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions   
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.   
4.9    Overdose   
Symptoms 
Symptoms of Wakix overdose may include headache, insomnia, irritability, nausea and abdominal 
pain.

5.    PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES   
5.1     Pharmacodynamic properties   
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, ATC code: N07XX11.   
Mechanism of action 
Pitolisant is a potent, orally active histamine H3-receptor antagonist/inverse agonist which, via its 
blockade of histamine auto-receptors enhances the activity of brain histaminergic neurons, a major 
arousal system with widespread projections to the whole brain. Pitolisant also modulates various 
neurotransmitter systems, increasing acetylcholine, noradrenaline and dopamine release in the brain. 
However no increase in dopamine release in the striatal complex including nucleus accumbens was 
evidenced for pitolisant.   
Pharmacodynamic effects   
In narcoleptic patients with or without cataplexy, pitolisant improves the level and duration of 
wakefulness and daytime alertness assessed by objective measures of ability to sustain wakefulness 
(e.g. Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT)) and attention (e.g. Sustained Attention to Response 
Task (SART)).   
Clinical efficacy and safety   
Adult population 
Narcolepsy (with or without cataplexy) is a chronic condition. The effectiveness of pitolisant up to 
36 mg once a day, for the treatment of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy was established in two 
main, 8 weeks, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trials 
(Harmony I and Harmony CTP). Harmony Ibis, study with a similar design, was limited to 18 mg 
once a day. Long-term safety data of Wakix in this indication are available in the open label long-term 
study HARMONY III. 
The pivotal study (Harmony 1), double-blind, randomized, vs placebo and modafinil (400 mg/day), 
parallel group studies with flexible dose adaptation, included 94 patients (31 patients treated with 
pitolisant, 30 with placebo and 33 with modafinil). Dosage was initiated at 9 mg once a day and was 
increased, according to efficacy response and tolerance to 18 mg or 36 mg once a day per 1-week 
interval. Most patients (60%) reached the 36 mg once a day dosage. To assess the efficacy of pitolisant 
on Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score was used as primary 
efficacy criterion. The results with pitolisant were significantly superior to those in the placebo group 
(mean difference: -3.33; 95%CI [-5.83 to -0.83]; p < 0.05) but did not differ significantly from the 
results in the modafinil group (mean difference: 0.12; 95%CI [-2.5 to 2.7]). The waking effect of the 
two active substances was established at similar rates (Figure 1).   
10   
  
   
   
   
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
Figure 1: Changes in Epworth Sleepiness Scale Score (ESS) (mean ± SEM) from Baseline to 
week 8 in Harmony 1 study   
The effect on Epworth was supported in two laboratory tests of vigilance and attention (Maintenance 
of Wakefulness Test (MWT) (p=0.044) and Sustained Attention to Response (SART) (p=0.053, 
almost but not significant)).   
Cataplexy attacks frequency in patients displaying this symptom was decreased significantly 
(p=0.034) with pitolisant (-65%) compared to placebo (-10%). The daily cataplexy rate (geometric 
means) was 0.52 at baseline and 0.18 at final visit for pitolisant and 0.43 at baseline and 0.39 at final 
visit for placebo, with a rate ratio rR=0.38 [0.16 ; 0.93] (p=0.034).    
The second pivotal study (Harmony Ibis) included 165 patients (67 treated with pitolisant, 33 with 
placebo and 65 with modafinil). The study design was similar to study Harmony I except that the 
maximum dose for pitolisant reached by 75% of patients was 18 mg once a day instead of 36 mg in 
Harmony I. As an important unbalance led to comparison of results with or without cluster grouping 
of sites, the most conservative approach showed non-significant ESS score decrease with pitolisant 
compared to placebo (pitolisant-placebo=-1.94 with p=0.065). Results from cataplexy rate at 18 mg 
once a day were not consistent with those of the first pivotal study (36 mg once a day). 
Improvement of the two objective tests of wakefulness and attention, MWT and SART, with pitolisant 
was significant versus placebo (p=0.009 and p=0.002 respectively) and non-significant versus 
modafinil (p=0.713 and p=0.294 respectively). 
Harmony CTP, a supportive double blind, randomized, parallel group study of pitolisant versus 
placebo, was designed to establish pitolisant efficacy in patients with high frequency cataplexy in 
narcolepsy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the average number of cataplexy attacks 
per week between the 2 weeks of baseline and the 4 weeks of stable treatment period at the end of 
study. 105 narcoleptic patients with high frequency weekly cataplexy rates at baseline were included 
(54 patients treated with pitolisant and 51 with placebo). Dosage was initiated at 4.5 mg once a day 
and was increased, according to efficacy response and tolerance to 9 mg, 18 mg or 36 mg once a day 
per 1-week interval. Most patients (65%) reached the 36 mg once a day dosage.   
On the primary efficacy endpoint, Weekly Rate of Cataplexy episodes (WRC), the results with 
pitolisant were significantly superior to those in the placebo group (p < 0.0001), with a progressive 
64% decrease from baseline to end of treatment (Figure 2). At baseline, the geometric mean of WRC 
was 7.31 (median=6.5 [4.5; 12]) and 9.15 (median=8.5 [5.5; 15.5]) in the placebo and pitolisant groups 
11   
   
   
   
   
   
  
 
 
  
respectively. During the stable period (until the end of treatment), geometric mean WRC decreased to 
6.79 (median=6 [3; 15]) and 3.28 (median=3 [1.3; 6]) in the placebo and pitolisant groups respectively 
in patients who had experienced at least one episode of cataplexy. The observed WRC in pitolisant 
group was about half of WRC in the placebo group: the effect size of pitolisant compared with placebo 
was summarized by the ratio rate rR(Pt/Pb), rR=0.512; 95%CI [0.435 to 0.603]; p < 0.0001). The 
effect size of pitolisant compared with placebo based on a model for WRC based on BOCF with centre 
as a fixed effect was 0.581, 95%CI [0.493 to 0.686]; p<0.0001.

Harmony CTP study   
*p<0.0001 vs placebo   
The effect of pitolisant on EDS was also assessed in this population using the ESS score. In the 
pitolisant group, ESS decreased significantly between baseline and the end of treatment compared to 
placebo with an observed mean change of -1.9 ± 4.3 and -5.4 ± 4.3 (mean ± sd) for placebo and 
pitolisant respectively, (p<0.0001) (Figure 3). This effect on EDS was confirmed by the results on 
Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT). The geometric mean of the ratios (MWTFinal/MWTBaseline) 
was 1.8 (95%CI 1.19; 2.71, p=0.005). The MWT value in the pitolisant group was 80% higher than in

The open-label, long-term Phase III study (HARMONY III) assessed the long term safety of pitolisant 
in patients suffering from narcolepsy (with or without cataplexy) over 12 months and with an 
extension of up to 5 years. 102 narcoleptic patients with or without cataplexy were included in the 12 
months follow-up period. 68 patients completed the first 12 months period. 45, 38, 34 and 14 patients 
completed the 2, 3, 4 and 5 year follow-up periods, respectively. 
The maximal dose received during the study was 36 mg / day in 85% of patients. After 12 months of 
treatment, improvements in EDS assessed by ESS score of remaining patients is of same magnitude as 
those observed in the other trials conducted in narcoleptic patients. The decrease in mean ESS score 
(SD) was -3.62 (4.63) after 1 year.   
After 12 months of treatment with pitolisant, frequency of symptoms such as sleep attacks, sleep 
paralysis, cataplexy and hallucinations has been improved. 
No major safety concern was identified. The safety results observed were similar to those reported in 
previous trials where pitolisant at 36 mg once daily was given for up to 3 months only. 
Paediatric population   
The effectiveness of pitolisant up to 36 mg once a day has been studied for the treatment of narcolepsy 
with or without cataplexy in children from 6 to less than 18 years old in an 8-week, multicenter, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. It included 110 patients (72 patients 
in the pitolisant group, 38 in the placebo group). Dosage was initiated at 4.5 mg once a day and was 
increased, according to efficacy response and tolerance to 18 mg or 36 mg once a day per 1-week 
interval. Patients weighing less than 40 kg remained at a maximum dose of 18 mg. Most patients 
(60%) reached the 36 mg once a day dosage. 35 patients (31.8%) were aged 6 to 11 years and 
75 patients (68.2%) were aged 12 to less than 18 years. To assess the efficacy of pitolisant on 
Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy (CTP), the Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale (UNS) 
total score was used as primary efficacy criterion, assessed as the change from baseline to the end of 
double-blind period. The estimate LS means difference (SE) [95% CI] of UNS between treatment 
groups (pitolisant minus placebo) was -3.69 (1.37) [-6.38; -0.99], p=0.0073. Secondary endpoints 
included the paediatric daytime sleepiness scale (PDSS), the UNS-cataplexy (CTP) subscore, and the 
weekly rate of cataplexy (WRC). The estimate LS means difference (SE) [95% CI] of the PDSS total 
score between treatment groups (pitolisant minus placebo) was -3.41 (1.07) [-5.52; -1.31], p=0.0015. 
In the subgroup of patients with type 1 narcolepsy, who had no minimum level of cataplexy required 
at inclusion (N=61 in the pitolisant group; N=29 in the placebo group), the estimate LS means 
difference (SE) [95% CI] of the UNS-CTP subscore between treatment groups (pitolisant minus 
placebo) was -1.77 (0.78) [-3.29; -0.24], p=0.0229, and the rate ratio between the WRC in the 
pitolisant group and the WRC in the placebo group, adjusted for baseline, was in favor of pitolisant 
(0.42 [95% CI: 0.18; 1.01], p=0.0540).

5.2    Pharmacokinetic properties   
The exposure to pitolisant in healthy volunteers was assessed in studies involving more than 200 
subjects that received doses of pitolisant in single administration up to 216 mg and for a duration up to 
28 days.   
Absorption   
Pitolisant is well and rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentration reached approximately three 
hours after administration.   
14   
 
 
 
  
  
   
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution   
Pitolisant exhibits high serum protein binding (>90%) and demonstrates approximately equal 
distribution between red blood cells and plasma.   
Biotransformation   
The metabolisation of pitolisant in humans is fully characterized. The major non-conjugated 
metabolites are hydroxylated derivatives in several positions and cleaved forms of pitolisant leading to 
inactive major carboxylic acid metabolite found in urine and serum. They are formed under the action 
of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Several conjugated metabolites were identified, the major ones (inactive) 
being two glycine conjugates of the acid metabolite of pitolisant and a glucuronide of a ketone 
metabolite of monohydroxy desaturated pitolisant.    
On liver microsomes, pitolisant and its major metabolites do not significantly inhibit the activities of 
the cytochromes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, CYP2B6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A4 and of 
uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferases isoforms UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9 and 
UGT2B7 up to the concentration of 13.3 µM, a level considerably higher than the levels achieved with 
therapeutic dose. Pitolisant is an inhibitor of CYP2D6 with moderate potency (IC50 = 2.6 µM).    
Pitolisant induces CYP3A4, CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 in vitro. Clinically relevant interactions are 
expected with CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 substrates and by extrapolation, UGTs, CYP2C and P-gp 
substrates (see section 4.5).  
In vitro studies indicate that pitolisant is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of human P-glycoprotein 
and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Pitolisant is not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3. 
Pitolisant is not a significant inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, or 
MATE2K at the tested concentration. Pitolisant shows greater than 50% inhibition towards OCT1 
(organic cation transporters 1) at 1.33 µM, the extrapolated IC50 of pitolisant is 0.795 µM (see section 
4.5).   
Elimination   
Pitolisant has a plasma half-life of 10-12 hours. Upon repeated administrations, the steady state is 
achieved after 5-6 days of administration leading to an increased serum level around 100%. Inter 
individual variability is rather high, some volunteers showing outlier high profile (without tolerance 
issues).   
The elimination is mainly achieved via urine (approximately 63%) through an inactive non conjugated 
metabolite (BP2.951) and a glycine conjugated metabolite. 25% of the dose is excreted through 
expired air and a small fraction (<3%) recovered in faeces where the amount of pitolisant or BP2.951 
was negligible.    
Linearity/non-linearity   
When pitolisant dose is doubled from 27 to 54 mg, AUC0-∞ is increased by about 2.3.   
Special populations   
Elderly   
In 68 to 80 years old patients the pharmacokinetics of pitolisant is not different compared to younger 
patients (18 to 45 years of age). Above 80 years old, kinetics show a slight variation without clinical 
relevance. Limited data are available in elderly. Therefore, dosing should be adjusted according to 
their renal hepatic status (see section 4.2 and 4.4).  
Renal impairment   
15   
 
   
 
   
  
   
   
 
 
   
 
   
 
   
In patients with impaired renal function (stages 2 to 4 according to the international classification of 
chronic kidney disease, i.e. creatinine clearance between 15 and 89 ml/min), Cmax and AUC tended to 
be increased by a factor of 2.5 without any impact on half-life (see section 4.2).   
Hepatic impairment   
In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A), there was no significant changes in 
pharmacokinetics compared with normal healthy volunteers. In patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh B), AUC increased by a factor 2.4, while half-life doubled (see section 4.2). 
Pitolisant pharmacokinetics after repeated administration in patients with hepatic impairment has not 
been evaluated yet.   
CYP2D6 poor metabolizers 
The exposure to Pitolisant was higher in the CYP2D6 poor metabolisers after a single dose and at 
steady state; Cmax and AUC(0-tau) was approximately 2.7-fold and 3.2-fold greater on Day 1 and 2.1-
fold and 2.4-fold on Day 7. The serum Pitolisant half-life was longer in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers 
compared to the extensive metabolisers. 
Race   
The effect of race on metabolism of pitolisant has not been evaluated.   
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of pitolisant at the dose of 18 mg in children from 6 to less than 18 years with 
narcolepsy has been studied in a multi-centre, single dose trial. By comparison to adult patients 
exposure, in a Population PK analysis with a body weight-dependent model, systemic exposure to 
pitolisant at the dose of 18 mg as estimated by Cmax and AUC0-10h are roughly 3-fold higher in children 
with a body weight below 40 kg and 2-fold higher in adolescents with a body weight above 40 kg 
compared to adults. Therefore, the dose titration should be initiated at the lowest dose of 4.5 mg and 
limited to 18 mg in children weighing less than 40 kg (see section 4.2). 
5.3    Preclinical safety data   
After 1 month in mice, 6 months in rats and 9 months in monkeys, no adverse effect level (NOAEL) 
were 75, 30 and 12 mg/kg/day, p.o., respectively, providing safety margins of 9, 1 and 0.4, 
respectively when compared to the drug exposure at therapeutic dose in human. In rats, transient 
reversible convulsive episodes occurred at Tmax , that may be attributable to a metabolite abundant in 
this species but not in humans. In monkeys, at the highest doses, transient CNS related clinical signs 
including emesis, tremors and convulsions were reported. At the highest doses, no histopathological 
changes were recorded in monkeys and rats presented some limited histopathological changes in some 
organs (liver, duodenum, thymus, adrenal gland and lung).   
Pitolisant was neither genotoxic nor carcinogenic.  
Teratogenic effect of pitolisant was observed at maternally toxic doses (teratogenicity safety margins 
< 1 in rats and in rabbits). At high doses, pitolisant induced sperm morphology abnormalities and 
decreased motility without any significant effect on fertility indexes in male rats and it decreased the 
percentage of live conceptuses and increased post-implantation loss in female rats (safety margin of 
1). It caused a delay in post-natal development (safety margin of 1).   
Pitolisant/metabolites were shown to cross the placenta barrier in animals.   
Juvenile toxicity studies in rats revealed that the administration of pitolisant at high doses induced a 
dose related mortality and convulsive episode that may be attributable to a metabolite abundant in rats 
but not in humans.   
Pitolisant blocked hERG channel with an IC50 exceeding therapeutic concentrations and induced a 
slight QTc prolongation in dogs.  
16   
   
 
   
 
   
   
   
  
   
   
   
 
In preclinical studies, drug dependence and drug abuse liability studies were conducted in mice, 
monkeys and rats. However, no definitive conclusion could be drawn on tolerance, dependence and 
self-administration studies.

Contents of the pack and other information   
1.    What Wakix is and what it is used for   
Wakix contains the active ingredient pitolisant. It is a medicine used to treat adults, adolescents and 
children over the age of 6 years with narcolepsy, with or without cataplexy.  
Narcolepsy is a condition that causes excessive daytime sleepiness and a tendency to suddenly fall 
asleep in inappropriate situations (sleep attacks). Cataplexy is the onset of sudden muscle weakness or 
paralysis without losing consciousness, in response to a sudden emotional reaction such as anger, fear, 
joy, laughter or surprise.   
The active substance, pitolisant, attaches to receptors on cells in the brain that are involved in 
stimulating alertness. This helps to combat daytime sleepiness and cataplexy and promote 
wakefulness.   
2.    What you need to know before you take Wakix   
Do not take Wakix if you   
- 
- 
- 
Are allergic to pitolisant or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).   
Have severe liver problems, as pitolisant is normally broken down in the liver and excess levels 
may build up in patients whose liver function is severely reduced.   
Are breastfeeding.

Other medicines and Wakix   
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Wakix can affect the way other medicines work and other medicines can affect the way 
Wakix works. Your doctor may need to adjust your doses.   
In particular, you should be cautious if you take Wakix together with some antidepressants (e.g. 
imipramine, clomipramine and mirtazapine) and some medicines to treat allergic conditions (anti-
histamines, e.g. pheniramine maleate, chlorpheniramine, diphenydramine, promethazine, mepyramine, 
doxylamine).

antibiotic), phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital (mainly used to control seizures), quinidine, 
digoxin (used to treat abnormal heart rhythms), paroxetine, fluoxetine, venlafaxine, duloxetine 
(antidepressants), St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) a herbal remedy for depression, bupropion 
(antidepressant or aid to smoking cessation), cinacalcet (for treatment of disorders of the parathyroid 
gland), terbinafine (used to treat fungal infections), metformin, repaglinide (used to treat diabete), 
docetaxel, irinotecan (used to treat cancer), cisapride (used to treat gastric reflux), pimozide (used to

Wakix may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, an alternative method of effective

Pregnancy and breast-feeding   
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.   
Pregnancy 
36   
   
 
 
 
 
   
 
   
   
 
 
 
  
 
Wakix should not be used during pregnancy unless your doctor says so. There is not enough 
information available to know whether any particular risk is associated with the use of Wakix during 
pregnancy. If you are a woman, you have to take a contraceptive during your treatment with Wakix 
and at least up to 21 days after treatment discontinuation. As Wakix may reduce the effectiveness of 
hormonal contraceptive, an alternative method of effective contraception has to be used.   
Breast-feeding 
Wakix passes into breast milk in animal. Patients taking Wakix must stop breastfeeding.   
Driving and using machines   
You should be cautious with activities that require attention such as driving a car and handling 
machinery. If you are unsure whether your condition has a negative effect on your ability to drive, talk 
to your doctor.   
3.    How to take Wakix   
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.   
Adults 
Treatment is normally started with a dose of 9 mg once per day, and gradually increased over three 
weeks to the most appropriate dose. At any time, your doctor can increase or decrease your dose 
depending on how well the medicine works for you and how well you tolerate it.   
It might take a few days before you feel the benefit of the medicine and the maximum benefit is 
usually felt after a few weeks.   
Do not change doses of Wakix on your own. Any change in dosage must be prescribed and monitored

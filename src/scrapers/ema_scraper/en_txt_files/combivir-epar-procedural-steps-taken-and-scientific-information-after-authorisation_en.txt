1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

lamivudine and between lamivudine and abacavir or 
zidovudine. Overall, the CHMP concluded that the data

reviewed indicated a terminal elimination half-life for

204993 and 204994. Study 204993 was a phase I, 
relative oral bioavailability study of different fixed 
dose combinations of dolutegravir and lamivudine in 
healthy subjects. Study 204994 was an open-label, 
randomized, single dose, crossover,  bioequivalence 
study of fixed-dose combination tablet(s) of 
dolutegravir and lamivudine versus dolutegravir and 
lamivudine single entities and food effect assessment

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to bring 
the PI in line with the latest QRD template version

Patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC of 
the fixed-dose combination products Combivir, 
Dovato, Kivexa, Triumeq and Trizivir to include new 
information about use of the products in patients 
with renal impairment. Furthermore, minor editorial 
changes have been implemented throughout the 
Product Information and the lists of local 
representatives have been updated for all products. 
mL/min receiving Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ Triumeq/ 
Trizivir may experience a 1.6-to 3.3-fold higher lamivudine 
exposure (AUC) than patients with a creatinine clearance 
≥50 mL/min. There are no safety data from randomized, 
controlled trials comparing Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ 
Triumeq/ Trizivir to the individual components in patients 
with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min who 
received dose-adjusted lamivudine. In the original 
lamivudine registrational trials in combination with 
zidovudine, higher lamivudine exposures were associated 
with higher rates of haematologic toxicities (neutropenia 
and anaemia), although discontinuations due to

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

neutropenia or anaemia each occurred in <1% of subjects. 
Other lamivudine-related adverse events (such as gastro-
intestinal and hepatic disorders) may occur. 
The CHMP considered that, with the exception of Epivir, the 
previous recommendations to adjust the dose in patients 
with a sustained creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 
mL/min can be removed. 
Patients with a sustained creatinine clearance between 30 
and 49 mL/min who receive Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ 
Triumeq/ Trizivir should be monitored for lamivudine-
related adverse events, notably haematologic toxicities. If 
new or worsening neutropenia or anaemia develop, a dose 
adjustment of lamivudine, per lamivudine prescribing 
information, is indicated, which cannot be achieved with 
Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ Triumeq/ Trizivir.  
Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ Triumeq/ Trizivir should be 
discontinued and the individual components should be used 
to construct the treatment regimen. 
The existing dose recommendations for Epivir have been 
maintained. The CHMP considered the lack of impact on pill 
burden when the lamivudine dose is adjusted for a 
monocomponent product and the fact that dose 
adjustments may be still used for subjects initially treated 
with lamivudine-containing fixed dose combinations, but 
requiring dose-adjusted individual components 
administration for safety reasons.

Product Characteristics.

Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. In addition, the

administration of sorbitol containing medicines may reduce 
the exposure of lamivudine, possibly resulting in reduced 
virologic suppression or viral resistance. 
Co-administration of sorbitol solution (3.2 g, 10.2 g, 13.4 
g) with a single 300 mg dose (Adult HIV daily dose) of 
lamivudine oral solution resulted in dose-dependent 
decreases of 14%, 32%, and 36% in lamivudine exposure 
(AUC) and 28%, 52%, and 55% in the Cmax of lamivudine 
in adults. When possible, avoid chronic co-administration of 
Zeffix with medicinal products containing sorbitol or other 
osmotic acting poly-alcohols or monosaccharide alcohols 
(e.g. xylitol, mannitol, lactitol, maltitol). Consider more 
frequent monitoring of HIV-1 viral load when chronic co-
administration cannot be avoided.

Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC in order to revise 
the wording regarding mitochondrial dysfunction 
to a variable degree, which is most pronounced with 
stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. There have been 
reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV negative infants 
exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside 
analogues; these have predominantly concerned treatment

hyperlipasemia). These events have often been transitory. 
Late onset neurological disorders have been reported rarely 
(hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether 
such neurological disorders are transient or permanent is 
currently unknown. These findings should be considered for 
any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, that 
present with severe clinical findings of unknown etiology, 
particularly neurologic findings. These findings do not affect 
current national recommendations to use antiretroviral 
therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical 
transmission of HIV.

cladribine (CdA) was assessed in a type II variation of

Chtioui et al (Concomitant treatment with lamivudine 
renders cladribine inactive by inhibition of its 
phosphorylation. Br.J.Haematology. 2008; 144: 136-137). 
This article described a patient with chronic lymphoid 
leukaemia who was treated with CdA and Zeffix. No 
decrease of the peripheral blood lymphocyte count was 
observed after the first cycle of CdA. Zeffix was 
discontinued and the lymphocyte count decreased following 
the second and third cycles of CdA. The authors suspected 
a potential interaction based on intracellular 
phosphorylation when both medicines are administered 
concomitantly. In addition, an in vitro study was carried out 
using peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a 
healthy volunteer. This in vitro study showed that 
phosphorylated CdA levels were decreased with increasing 
3TC concentrations.

polymyositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Still’s syndrome and 
myasthenia gravis. Cases involving zidovudine, lamivudine, 
abacavir and fosamprenavir were identified. These 
disorders all developed when CD4 count was increased or 
increasing and viral load undetectable. The autoimmune 
disorders resolved (or improved) spontaneously or with 
specific therapy and while Anti-Retroviral Therapy was 
continued. Most of cases had a relatively late onset 
following Anti-Retroviral Therapy initiation except cases of 
Guillain-Barré syndrome and adult onset Still’s disease. The 
time to onset ranged from 2 weeks to 37 months. 
While it was recognised that the number of cases is small, 
the long and variable time to onset probably causes 
underreporting of such adverse reactions and therefore 
little is known on the exact pathogenesis and the risk 
factors. The CHMP agreed that information about 
autoimmune disorders occurring in the context of immune 
reconstitution should be reflected in the product 
information.

zidovudine and ribavirin is associated with a greater risk of 
anaemia. The consensus conference on the treatment of 
HCV/HIV co-infected patients already recommended that 
the use of zidovudine should be avoided due to an excess

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency). 
Vihuma can be used for all age groups. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia. 
Treatment monitoring 
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide the 
dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their 
response to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight 
may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical 
interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation 
analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable. 
When using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining 
factor VIII activity in patients’ blood samples, plasma factor VIII activity results can be significantly 
affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay. Also there can 
be significant discrepancies between assay results obtained by aPTT-based one stage clotting assay 
and the chromogenic assay according to Ph. Eur. This is of importance particularly when changing the 
laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay. 
Posology 
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, 
on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition. 
The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which is 
related to the current WHO concentrate standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in 
plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or preferably in 
International Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma). 
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to the quantity of factor VIII in one 
mL of normal human plasma.  
On-demand treatment 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 
1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 
approximately 2% of normal activity or 2 IU/dL. The required dose is determined using the following 
formula:  
Required units = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) (IU/dL) x 0.5 (IU/kg per IU/dL) 
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =   2 x administered IU 
  body weight (kg) 
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
clinical effectiveness in the individual case. 
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dL) in the corresponding period. The following table can 
be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery.

indicated by pain is resolved or healing 
is achieved.  
Repeat infusion every 12 to 24 hours 
for 3 to 4 days or more until pain and 
acute disability are resolved.  
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours 
until threat is resolved.

Repeat infusion every 8–24 hours until 
adequate wound healing, then therapy 
for at least another 7 days to maintain a 
factor VIII activity of 30% to 
60% (IU/dL).  
Prophylaxis 
For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses are 
20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. The regimen may be adjusted 
based on patient response. 
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary. 
Paediatric population 
The posology is the same in adults and children and adolescents, however, shorter dose intervals or 
higher doses may be necessary for children and adolescents. Currently available data are described in 
sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. 
Method of administration 
Vihuma is for intravenous use. 
It is recommended that not more than 4 mL per minute be administered.

For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of 
the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity 
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Vihuma 
contains traces of human host cell proteins other than factor VIII. If symptoms of hypersensitivity 
occur, patients should be advised to discontinue use of the medicinal product immediately and contact 
their physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including 
hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. 
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. 
Inhibitors 
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) 
per mL of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the 
severity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 50 
exposure days but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon. 
Cases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII 
product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a 
previous history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients 
carefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch.  
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
inhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of 
insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.  
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected 
factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate 
dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of 
inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of 
haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. 
Cardiovascular events  
In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FVIII may increase the 
cardiovascular risk. 
Catheter-related complications 
If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.

Paediatric population 
The listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children and adolescents. 
Excipient related considerations (sodium content) 
This medicinal product contains 18.4 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.92 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed with Vihuma. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII.  
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII 
during pregnancy and breast feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during 
pregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated. There are no fertility data available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Vihuma has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.   
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angiooedema, burning and stinging at the 
infusion site, chills, flushing, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, rash, restlessness, 
tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, urticaria, including generalised urticaria, vomiting, 
wheezing) have rarely been observed with FVIII preparations and may in some cases progress to 
severe anaphylaxis (including shock).  
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated 
with factor VIII, including with Vihuma. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as 
an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia 
centre be contacted. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 1 presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and Preferred 
Term Level). Frequencies are based on reports from clinical trials with a total of 355 unique subjects 
with severe haemophilia A, of which 247 were previously treated patients (PTPs) and 108 were 
previously untreated patients (PUPs). 
Frequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10); 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare 
(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Investigations 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
A non-neutralizing anti-factor VIII antibody was detected in one adult patient (see Table 1). The 
sample was tested by the central laboratory at eight dilutions. The result was positive only at dilution 
factor 1 and the antibody titre was very low. Inhibitory activity, as measured by the modified Bethesda 
assay, was not detected in this patient. Clinical efficacy and in vivo recovery of Vihuma was not 
affected in this patient. 
Paediatric population 
Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children and adolescents are assumed to be the 
same as in adults. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No cases of overdose have been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code: B02BD02. 
The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von 
Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac patient, 
factor VIII binds to von Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a 
cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. 
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin 
and a clot can be formed. Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to decreased levels of factor VIII:C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal 
organs, either spontaneously or as results of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the 
plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby temporarily enabling a correction of the factor VIII 
deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies. 
Adult and adolescent population 12 - 65 years of age 
Prophylaxis: In a clinical study in 32 adult patients with severe haemophilia A, the median 
consumption of Vihuma for prophylaxis was 468.7 IU/kg/month. 
Treatment of bleeding: The median dose to treat break-through bleeding episodes was 33.0 IU/kg in 
these patients who were on prophylaxis. In another clinical study, 22 adult patients were treated on 
demand.  In total 986 bleeding episodes were treated with a median dose of 30.9 IU/kg. In general, 
minor bleeds required slightly lower, and more severe bleeds required up to three-fold higher median 
doses. 
Individualised prophylaxis: Individualised PK-based prophylaxis was evaluated in 66 adult PTPs with 
severe haemophilia A. Following a 1-3 month standard prophylaxis phase (every other day or 3 times 
weekly dosing), 44 (67%) patients were switched to a dosing regimen based on their PK assessment, 
and 40 completed the 6 months of prophylaxis according to the assigned dosing and treatment scheme. 
Of these patients, 34 (85%) were treated twice weekly or less. 33 (82.5%) patients did not experience 
any bleeds and 36 (90.0%) patients had no spontaneous bleeds. The mean ± SD annualised bleeding 
rate was 1.2 ± 3.9 and the mean ± SD dose were 52.2 ± 12.2 IU/kg per injection and 99.7 ± 25.6 
IU/kg per week.  
Of note, annualised bleeding rate (ABR) is not comparable between different factor concentrates and 
between different clinical studies. 
Paediatric population 
Data were obtained in 29 previously treated children between 2 and 5 years of age, 31 children 
between 6 and 12 years of age and one adolescent of 14 years. The median dose per prophylactic 
infusion was 37.8 IU/kg. Twenty patients used median doses of more than 45 IU/kg. The median 
consumption of Vihuma for prophylaxis per month was 521.9 IU/kg. A higher median dose of Vihuma 
was required to treat bleedings in children (43.9 IU/kg) than in adults (33.0 IU/kg), and a higher 
median dose was required to treat moderate to major than minor bleedings (78.2 IU/kg vs. 41.7 IU/kg). 
Younger children in general required higher median doses (6-12 years: 43.9 IU/kg; 2-5 years: 
52.6 IU/kg). These data were corroborated by a long-term follow-up of 49 of these children who were 
treated for an additional median period of approximately 30 months (range from 9.5 to 52 months); 
during this period 45% of children had no spontaneous bleeds. 
Data from 108 previously untreated patients with severe haemophilia A (<1% FVIII:C) were obtained 
in a prospective open-label clinical study. In the majority of patients prophylactic treatment was 
initiated after the occurrence of the first bleeding episode requiring treatment.

As known from the literature, recovery and half-life was lower in young children than in adults and 
clearance higher, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma volume per kilogram body 
weight in younger patients.

In pre-clinical studies, Vihuma was used to safely and effectively restore haemostasis in dogs with 
haemophilia. Toxicology studies showed that local intravenous administration and systemic exposure 
were well tolerated in laboratory animals (rats and cynomolgus monkeys). 
Specific studies with long-term repeated administration such as reproduction toxicity, chronic toxicity, 
and carcinogenicity were not performed with Vihuma due to the immune response to heterologous 
proteins in all non-human mammalian species. 
No studies were performed on the mutagenic potential of Vihuma.  
Ex vivo evaluations using a commercial assay kit to quantify T cell response to protein therapeutics 
indicate a low risk of immunogenicity.

-  Solvent: 1 borosilicate pre-filled glass syringe containing 2.5 mL water for injections 
-  1 sterile vial adapter for reconstitution with 1 butterfly needle and 2 alcohol swabs  
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
The powder should only be reconstituted with the supplied solvent (2.5 mL water for injections) using 
the supplied injection set. The vial should be gently rotated until all powder is dissolved. After 
reconstitution, the solution should be drawn back into the syringe.  
The reconstituted medicinal product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and 
discoloration prior to administration. The reconstituted medicinal product is a clear, colourless 
solution, free from foreign particles and has a pH of 6.5 to 7.5.  Do not use solutions that are cloudy or 
have deposits. 
Instructions for preparation and administration 
1.  Allow the solvent syringe (water for injections) and the powder in the closed vial to reach 
room temperature. You can do this by holding them in your hands until they feel as warm as 
your hands. Do not use any other way to heat the vial and pre-filled syringe. This temperature 
should be maintained during reconstitution. 
2.  Remove the plastic flip-off cap from the powder vial to expose the central portions of the 
rubber stopper. Do not remove the grey stopper or metal ring around the top of the vial.  
3.  Wipe the top of the vial with an alcohol swab. Allow the alcohol to dry.  
4.  Peel back the paper cover from the vial adapter package. Leave the adapter in the package.  
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.  Place the powder vial on an even surface and hold it. Take the adapter package and place the 
vial adapter over the centre of the rubber stopper of the powder vial. Press the adapter package 
down firmly until the adapter spike penetrates the rubber stopper. The adapter snaps onto the 
vial when done. 
6.  Peel back the paper cover from the pre-filled syringe package. Hold the plunger rod at the end 
and do not touch the shaft. Screw the threaded end of the plunger rod to the solvent syringe 
plunger by turning the plunger rod clockwise until a slight resistance is felt. 
7.  Break off the tamper-proof plastic tip from the other end of the solvent syringe by snapping 
the perforation of the cap. Do not touch the inside of the cap or the syringe tip. . 
12 
  
 
 
8.  Remove the adapter packaging from the top of the vial and discard. 
9.  Firmly connect the solvent syringe to the vial adapter by turning clockwise until resistance is 
felt. 
10.  Slowly inject all solvent into the powder vial by pressing down the plunger rod. 
11.  Without removing the syringe, gently move or swirl the vial in circles a few times to dissolve 
the powder. Do not shake. Wait until all the powder dissolves completely. 
12.  Inspect the final solution for particles before administration. The solution should be clear and 
colourless, practically free from visible particles. Do not use solutions that are cloudy or have 
deposits. 
13 
 
 
 
13.  Turn the vial attached to the syringe upside down, and slowly draw the final solution into the 
syringe. Make sure that the entire content of the vial is transferred to the syringe.  
14.  Detach the filled syringe from the vial adapter by turning the vial counter clockwise and 
discard the empty vial. 
15.  The solution is now ready and should be used right away. Do not refrigerate. 
16.  Clean the chosen injection site with one of the provided alcohol swabs. 
17.  Attach the provided infusion set to the syringe. 
Insert the needle of the infusion set into the chosen vein as you have been taught. If you have 
used a tourniquet to make the vein easier to see, this tourniquet should be released before you 
start injecting the solution. 
 Do not allow any blood to flow back into the syringe, or it may clot and clog the syringe, 
preventing you from injecting the right dose. 
18.  Inject the solution into the vein at a slow speed, not faster than 4 mL per minute. 
If you use more than one vial of powder for one treatment, you may use again the same injection 
needle of the infusion set. The vial adapter and the syringe are for single use only. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Vihuma is and what it is used for 
Vihuma contains the active substance human recombinant coagulation factor VIII (also called 
simoctocog alfa). Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleeding. In patients 
with haemophilia A (inborn factor VIII deficiency), factor VIII is missing or does not work properly. 
Vihuma  replaces  the missing  factor  VIII  so  the  blood  can clot  normally, and can  be used  in all  age 
groups to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Vihuma 
Do not use Vihuma 
• 
if you are allergic to the active substance simoctocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before using Vihuma. 
There is a rare chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic 
reaction) to Vihuma. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions as they are listed in 
section 4 “Allergic reactions”.  
If any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with 
all factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working 
properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If 
you or your child´s bleeding is not controlled with Vihuma, tell your doctor immediately. 
Cardiovascular events  
In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with factor VIII may increase 
the cardiovascular risk. 
Catheter-related complications 
If you require a central venous access device (CVAD), risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, presence of bacteria in the blood and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. 
Traceability 
It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your Vihuma. 
So, every time you get a new package of Vihuma, note down the date and the batch number (which is 
on the packaging after {Lot} and keep this information in a safe place. 
Other medicines and Vihuma 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine.  
Driving and using machines 
Vihuma has no influence on your ability to drive and use machines.  
Vihuma contains sodium 
This medicine contains 18.4 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 0.92 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
3. 
How to use Vihuma 
Treatment with Vihuma will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with 
haemophilia A. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or nurse has told you. Check with 
your doctor or nurse if you are not sure. 
Vihuma is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or a nurse. You or someone else 
might also give your Vihuma injection, but only after receiving adequate training. 
Your doctor will calculate your dose of Vihuma (in international units = IU) depending on your 
clinical condition and body weight, and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. 
How often you need an injection will depend on how well Vihuma works for you. Usually, treatment 
for haemophilia A is a life-long treatment. 
Prevention of bleeding 
The usual dose of Vihuma is 20 to 40 IU per kg body weight, given every 2 to 3 days. However, in 
some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may be necessary. 
Treatment of bleeding 
The dose of Vihuma is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be 
achieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding.  
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have the impression that Vihuma is not working well enough, talk to your doctor. Your doctor 
will carry out laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor VIII levels. This is 
particularly important if you are having major surgery. 
Patients developing factor VIII inhibitors 
If your factor VIII fails to reach expected levels with Vihuma, or if bleeding is not adequately 
controlled, it could be due to the development of factor VIII inhibitors. This will be checked by your 
doctor. You might need a higher dose of Vihuma or a different product to control bleeding. Do not 
increase the total dose of Vihuma to control your bleeding without consulting your doctor. 
Use in children and adolescents 
The way Vihuma is used in children and adolescents does not differ from the way it is used in adults. 
Because factor VIII products may have to be given more often in children and adolescents, a central 
venous access device (CVAD) may need to be fitted. A CVAD is an external connector that allows 
medicines to be given into the bloodstream without injection through the skin. 
If you use more Vihuma than you should 
No symptoms of overdose have been reported. If you have injected more Vihuma than you should, 
please inform your doctor. 
If you forget to use Vihuma 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next dose immediately 
and continue as advised by your doctor. 
If you stop using Vihuma 
Do not stop using Vihuma without consulting your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Please stop using this medicine immediately and seek urgent medical advice if: 
- 
you notice symptoms of allergic reactions 
Allergic reactions may include rash, hives, urticaria (itchy rash), including generalized 
urticaria, swelling of lips and tongue, shortness of breath, wheezing, tightness of the chest, 
vomiting, restlessness, low blood pressure, and dizziness. These symptoms can be early 
symptoms of an anaphylactic shock. If severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic) occur 
(very rare: may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people), the injection must be stopped immediately, 
and you must contact your doctor right away. Severe symptoms require prompt emergency 
treatment. 
you notice that the medicine stops working properly (bleeding is not stopped or becomes 
frequent)  
For children and adolescents not previously treated with factor VIII medicines, inhibitor 
antibodies (see section 2) may form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 patients). 
However, for patients who have received previous treatment with factor VIII (more than 150 
days of treatment) the risk is uncommon (less than 1 in 100 patients). If this happens, your or 
your child´s medicines may stop working properly and you or your child may experience 
persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your doctor immediately. 
- 
Common side effects may affect up to 1 in 10 people 
Hypersensitivity, fever. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Uncommon side effects may affect up to 1 in 100 people 
Tingling or numbness (paraesthesia), headache, dizziness, vertigo, dyspnoea, dry mouth, back pain, 
injection site inflammation, injection site pain, a vague feeling of bodily discomfort (malaise), 
haemorrhagic anaemia, anaemia, chest pain, non-neutralising antibody positive (in previously treated 
patients). 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this 
leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION AND ADMINISTRATION 
1.  Allow the solvent syringe (water for injections) and the powder in the closed vial to reach 
room temperature. You can do this by holding them in your hands until they feel as warm as 
your hands. Do not use any other way to heat the vial and pre-filled syringe. This temperature 
should be maintained during reconstitution. 
2.  Remove the plastic flip-off cap from the powder vial to expose the central portions of the 
rubber stopper. Do not remove the grey stopper or metal ring around the top of the vial.  
3.  Wipe the top of the vial with an alcohol swab. Allow the alcohol to dry.  
4.  Peel back the paper cover from the vial adapter package. Leave the adapter in the package.  
5.  Place the powder vial on an even surface and hold it. Take the adapter package and place the 
vial adapter over the centre of the rubber stopper of the powder vial. Press the adapter package 
down firmly until the adapter spike penetrates the rubber stopper. The adapter snaps onto the 
vial when done. 
51 
 
 
  
6.  Peel back the paper cover from the pre-filled syringe package. Hold the plunger rod at the end 
and do not touch the shaft. Screw the threaded end of the plunger rod into the solvent syringe 
plunger by turning the plunger rod clockwise until a slight resistance is felt. 
7.  Break off the tamper-proof plastic tip from the other end of the solvent syringe by snapping 
the perforation of the cap. Do not touch the inside of the cap or the syringe tip. 
8.  Remove the adapter packaging from the top of the vial and discard. 
9.  Firmly connect the solvent syringe to the vial adapter by turning clockwise until resistance is 
felt. 
52 
 
 
 
10.  Slowly inject all solvent into the powder vial by pressing down the plunger rod. 
11.  Without removing the syringe, gently move or swirl the vial in circles a few times to dissolve 
the powder. Do not shake. Wait until all the powder dissolves completely. 
12.  Inspect the final solution for particles before administration. The solution should be clear and 
colourless, practically free from visible particles. Do not use solutions that are cloudy or have 
deposits. 
13.  Turn the vial attached to the syringe upside down, and slowly draw the final solution into the 
syringe. Make sure that the entire content of the vial is transferred to the syringe.  
14.  Detach the filled syringe from the vial adapter by turning the vial counter clockwise and 
discard the empty vial. 
53 
 
 
 
15.  The solution is now ready and should be used right away. Do not refrigerate. 
16.  Clean the chosen injection site with one of the provided alcohol swabs. 
17.  Attach the provided infusion set to the syringe. 
Insert the needle of the infusion set into the chosen vein as you have been taught. If you have 
used a tourniquet to make the vein easier to see, this tourniquet should be released before you 
start injecting the solution. 
Do not allow any blood to flow back into the syringe, or it may clot and clog the syringe, 
preventing you from injecting the right dose. 
18.  Inject the solution into the vein at a slow speed, not faster than 4 mL per minute. 
If you use more than one vial of powder for one treatment, you may use again the same injection 
needle of the infusion set. The vial adapter and the syringe are for single use only.

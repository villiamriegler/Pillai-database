Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for blinatumomab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on CD19 negative relapse of Ph negative B-precursor acute lymphatic leukemia 
(ALL) while maintaining identical phenotypical and immunophenotypic features and lineage switch from 
B-precursor ALL to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from clinical trials, the literature, spontaneous reports 
including in some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and in view of a plausible 
mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between blinatumomab and CD19 
negativity of Ph negative acute lymphatic leukemia in relapsed patients is established and a causal 
relationship between blinatumomab and lineage switch from ALL to acute myeloid leukemia in relapsed 
patients is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of 
products containing blinatumomab should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for blinatumomab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing blinatumomab is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
REZOLSTA 
Darunavir / cobicistat 
On 25 September 2014, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a 
positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
REZOLSTA (800 mg/150 mg), film-coated tablet intended for the treatment of antiretroviral therapy 
(ART)-naïve adults and ART-experienced adults with no darunavir (DRV) resistance associated 
mutations (RAMs). The applicant for this medicinal product is Janssen-Cilag International N.V. 
They may request a re-examination of any CHMP opinion, provided they notify the European Medicines 
Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
REZOLSTA is a fixed-dose combination of the antiretroviral medicinal product darunavir and the 
pharmacokinetic enhancer cobicistat. The active substance of REZOLSTA is darunavir, an HIV-1 
protease inhibitor [Antivirals for systemic use, antivirals for treatment of HIV infection, combinations 
(ATC code: J05AR14)]. 
The benefits with REZOLSTA are its ability to provide sustainable virological suppression if given as 
part of combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for treatment of HIV-1 infection. The 
most common side effects are diarrhoea, nausea, and rash. A pharmacovigilance plan for REZOLSTA 
will be implemented as part of the marketing authorisation.  
The approved indication is: "REZOLSTA, is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal 
products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1) infection in adults aged 18 
years or older. Genotypic testing should guide the use of REZOLSTA (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 
5.1)".  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 
67 days from adoption of the opinion.

The CHMP, on the basis of quality, safety and efficacy data submitted, considers there to be a 
favourable benefit-to-risk balance for REZOLSTA and therefore recommends the granting of the 
marketing authorisation.

1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Amversio 1 g oral powder 
2.  QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
1 g of powder contains 1 g of betaine anhydrous.  
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Oral powder.  
White crystalline free flowing powder.  
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Amversio is indicated as adjunctive treatment of homocystinuria, involving deficiencies or defects in:  
• 
• 
• 
cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS),  
5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR),  
cobalamin cofactor metabolism (cbl).  
Amversio should be used as supplement to other therapies such as vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin 
B12 (cobalamin), folate and a specific diet. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Amversio treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the treatment of patients with 
homocystinuria. 
Posology 
Children and adults  
The recommended total daily dose is 100 mg/kg/day given in 2 doses daily. However, the dose should 
be individually titrated according to plasma levels of homocysteine and methionine. In some patients 
doses above 200 mg/kg/day were needed to reach therapeutic goals. Caution should be exercised with 
up-titrating doses for patients with CBS deficiency due to the risk for hypermethioninaemia. 
Methionine levels should be closely monitored in these patients.  
Special populations  
Hepatic or renal impairment  
Experience with betaine anhydrous therapy in patients with renal insufficiency or non-alcoholic 
hepatic steatosis has demonstrated no need to adapt the dose regimen of Amversio. 
Therapeutic monitoring 
The aim of treatment is to keep plasma levels of total homocysteine below 15 μmol/L or as low as 
possible. The steady-state response usually occurs within a month. 
Method of administration  
Oral use

The bottle should be lightly shaken before opening. Three measuring spoons are provided which 
dispense either 100 mg, 150 mg or 1 g of betaine anhydrous. It is recommended that a heaped 
measuring spoon is removed from the bottle and a flat surface e.g. base of a knife is drawn across the 
top of the measure. This will give the following doses: the green measuring spoon dispenses 100 mg, 
the blue measuring spoon dispenses 150 mg and the purple measuring spoon dispenses 1 g of betaine 
anhydrous. 
The powder should be mixed with water, juice, milk, formula or food until completely dissolved and 
ingested immediately after mixing. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Uncommon cases of severe cerebral oedema associated with hypermethioninemia were reported with 
betaine anhydrous therapy in patients with CBS deficiency (see section 4.8). Complete recovery was 
seen after treatment discontinuation:  
- 
The plasma methionine concentrations should be kept below 1,000 μmol/L. It is recommended 
to measure plasma methionine level at start of treatment and about annually or biannually 
thereafter. If methionine increases particularly above the first safety threshold of 700 μmol/L, 
patient should be monitored more frequently and compliance with diet should be checked. In 
order to reduce methionine levels, modification of diet as well as dose reduction of Amversio or 
temporal interruption of Amversio treatment should be considered. 
If any symptoms of cerebral oedema like morning headaches with vomiting and/or visual 
changes appear, plasma methionine level and compliance to the diet should be checked and 
treatment with Amversio interrupted.  
If symptoms of cerebral oedema recur after re-introduction of treatment then betaine anhydrous 
therapy should be discontinued indefinitely.  
- 
- 
To minimise the risk of potential drug interactions, it is advisable to leave 30 minutes between the 
intake of betaine anhydrous and amino acids mixtures and/or medicinal products containing vigabatrin 
and GABA analogues (see section 4.5). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed.  
Based on in vitro data, betaine anhydrous might interact with amino acids mixtures and medicinal 
products containing vigabatrin and GABA analogues. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy  
Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse event of betaine anhydrous on 
pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn child. To date, no other relevant epidemiologic data 
are available. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted. During pregnancy, administering 
betaine anhydrous in addition to pyridoxine, folate, anticoagulant and diet under close monitoring of 
plasma homocysteine would be compatible with good maternal and foetal outcomes. However, 
Amversio should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.

Breast-feeding  
It is not known whether betaine anhydrous is excreted in human milk (although its metabolic 
precursor, choline, occurs at high levels in human milk). Because of lack of data, caution should be 
exercised when prescribing Amversio to breast-feeding women. 
Fertility  
No data is available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Amversio has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
In general, adverse reactions seen with betaine anhydrous therapy appeared to be not serious and are 
mainly related to the gastrointestinal system. Gastrointestinal disorders like diarrhoea, glossitis, 
nausea, stomach discomfort, vomiting and dental disorders may occur uncommonly.  
The most commonly reported adverse reaction during treatment is blood methionine increased. 
Complete recovery was seen after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
Reported adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency.  
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon  
(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency 
grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders  
Psychiatric disorders  
Nervous system disorders  
Gastrointestinal disorders  
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  
Renal and urinary disorders  
Investigations  
Description of selected adverse reactions  
Uncommon: anorexia  
Uncommon: agitation, irritability  
Uncommon: brain oedema*  
Uncommon: diarrhoea, glossitis, nausea, stomach 
discomfort, vomiting  
Uncommon: hair loss, hives, skin odour abnormal  
Uncommon: urinary incontinence  
Very common: blood methionine increased*  
*Uncommon cases of severe cerebral oedema and hypermethioninemia were reported within 2 weeks 
to 6 months of starting betaine anhydrous therapy in patients with CBS deficiency, with complete 
recovery after treatment discontinuation.  
Symptoms of cerebral oedema include morning headaches with vomiting and/or visual changes.  
High increases in plasma methionine levels in a range from 1,000 to 3,000 μmol/L were noted in these 
patients. As cerebral oedema has also been reported in patients with hypermethioninemia, secondary 
hypermethioninemia due to betaine anhydrous therapy has been postulated as a possible mechanism of 
action.  
For specific recommendations, see section 4.4. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, amino acids and 
derivatives, ATC code: A16AA06. 
Mechanism of action 
Betaine anhydrous was shown to lower plasma homocysteine levels in the three types of 
homocystinuria, i.e. CBS deficiency; MTHFR deficiency and cbl defect. The extent of this effect was 
dependent on the absolute degree of hyperhomocysteinemia, being higher in severe 
hyperhomocysteinemia. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Betaine anhydrous acts as a methyl group donor in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine 
in patients with homocystinuria. As a result, plasma levels of homocysteine should decrease in these 
patients, to 20-30% of pre-treatment levels.  
Betaine anhydrous has also been shown to increase plasma methionine and S-adenosyl methionine 
(SAM) levels in patients with MTHFR deficiency and cbl defects. In CBS-deficient patients without 
dietary restriction of methionine, excessive accumulation of methionine has been observed.  
Betaine anhydrous supplementation was shown to improve the metabolic abnormalities in the 
cerebrospinal fluid of patients with homocystinuria. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Elevated homocysteine plasma levels are associated with cardiovascular events (such as thrombosis), 
osteoporosis, skeletal abnormalities, and optic lens dislocation. In observational studies, clinical 
improvement (cardiovascular and neurodevelopmental) was reported by the treating physician in about 
75% of patients taking betaine anhydrous. Most of these patients were also receiving other treatments 
such as vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B12 (cobalamin) and folate with variable biochemical 
responses. In most cases, adding betaine anhydrous resulted in a further reduction in plasma 
homocysteine level. It is likely that due to the multiple nature of therapy (dietary, pharmaceutical, 
supportive) in these patients, there may be an element of overestimation in the clinical effects of 
betaine anhydrous treatment. Late detection of homocystinuria in symptomatic state is responsible for 
residual morbidity due to irreversible damage to connective tissue (ophthalmological, skeletal) that 
cannot be corrected by further therapy. The available clinical data do not allow correlating posology 
and clinical efficacy. There is no evidence of development of tolerance. 
In a few cases, increased plasma methionine levels were associated with cerebral oedema (see sections 
4.4 and 4.8). 
Monitoring plasma homocysteine levels has demonstrated that the onset of action of betaine 
anhydrous occurred within several days and that a steady-state response was achieved within one 
month. 
Paediatric population 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In paediatric patients less than 10 years of age, the usual effective dose regimen is 100 mg/kg/day 
given in 2 doses daily; increasing the frequency above twice daily and/or the dose above 
150 mg/kg/day does not improve the homocysteine-lowering effect. 
Monitoring betaine plasma concentrations does not help to define the efficacy of treatment, since these 
concentrations do not directly correspond to the flux through the cytosolic betaine homocysteine 
methyl transferase pathway. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetic data of homocystinuric patients on long-term betaine anhydrous supplementation 
are very similar to those of healthy volunteers. This demonstrates that differences in betaine anhydrous 
kinetics are most probably due to betaine anhydrous depletion in untreated homocystinuria and are 
only meaningful for the initial treatment. 
Absorption 
The absolute bioavailability of betaine anhydrous has not been determined. In healthy adult volunteers 
(age between 21 to 49 years), after a single oral dose of betaine anhydrous (50 mg/kg), absorption 
was rapid (tmax = 0.9 ± 0.3 hours and a Cmax = 0.9 ± 0.2 mM).  
After a repeated dose regimen of 100 mg/kg/day for 5 days, the absorption kinetics did not change. 
Distribution 
Betaine anhydrous was rapidly distributed into a relatively large volume (V/F = 1.3 l/kg).  
After a repeated dose regiment of 100 mg/kg/day for 5 days, the distribution half-life was prolonged 
significantly (up to 36 h), indicating saturable transport and redistribution processes. 
Biotransformation 
Betaine anhydrous is a methyl group donor. 
Elimination 
With a slow elimination rate (mean half-life = 14 h, mean total body clearance, CL/F, = 84 ml/h/kg), 
renal clearance is negligible (5% of total body clearance), assuming 100% bioavailability. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
At high doses, a CNS depressant effect and irritation of the gastrointestinal tract was seen in rats. 
Long-term carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted on betaine 
anhydrous. A standard battery of genotoxicity test reveals no specific hazard for humans.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Amversio is and what it is used for 
Amversio contains betaine anhydrous which is intended to be an adjunctive treatment of 
homocystinuria, an inherited (genetic) disease where the amino acid methionine cannot be broken 
down completely by the body. 
Methionine is present in regular food protein (such as meat, fish, milk, cheese, eggs). It is converted 
into homocysteine which is then normally converted into cysteine during digestion. Homocystinuria is 
a disease caused by the accumulation of homocysteine which is not converted to cysteine and is 
characterised by formation of clots in the veins, bone weakness, and skeletal and crystalline lens 
abnormalities. The use of Amversio together with other treatments such as vitamin B6, vitamin B12, 
folate and a specific diet aims to reduce the elevated homocysteine levels in your body. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Amversio  
Do not take Amversio 
- 
if you are allergic to betaine anhydrous. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Amversio. 
- 
If you notice side effects like headaches, vomiting or a change in your vision and you are of the 
homocystinuria subtype called CBS (cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency), please contact 
your doctor immediately, they could be signs of a swelling in the brain (cerebral oedema). In 
that case your doctor will monitor your methionine level in your body and may review your 
diet. Your treatment with Amversio may need to be interrupted.  
If you are treated with Amversio and with an amino-acid mixture and if you need to take other 
medicines at the same time, leave 30 minutes between the intake (see “section “Other medicines 
and Amversio). 
- 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicines and Amversio 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  
If you are taking amino-acid mixture or medicines such as vigabatrin or Gaba analogues (medicine 
used to treat epilepsy), please tell your doctor as they might interact with your treatment with 
Amversio. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will decide if you can use this 
medicine during pregnancy and breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Amversio has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
3. 
How to take Amversio 
The use of this medicine will be supervised by a doctor experienced in the treatment of patients with 
homocystinuria.  
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose in children and adults is 100 mg/kg/day divided in 2 doses per day. In some 
patients doses above 200 mg/kg/day were needed to reach therapeutic goals. Your doctor may adapt 
the dose depending on your laboratory values. 
You will therefore need regular blood tests to determine the correct daily dose. 
Instructions for use 
You should take Amversio orally (by mouth).  
To measure the dose: 
• 
• 
shake the bottle lightly before opening  
take the correct measuring spoon:  
• the green measuring spoon dispenses 100 mg;  
• the blue measuring spoon dispenses 150 mg;  
• the purple measuring spoon dispenses 1 g.  
take a heaped spoonful of powder out of the bottle  
pass the flat back of a knife over the top of the spoon  
the powder left in the spoon is one spoonful  
take the correct number of spoonfuls of powder from the bottle  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Mix the measured dose of powder with water, juice, milk, formula or food until completely dissolved 
and ingest immediately after mixing. 
If you take more Amversio than you should 
If you accidentally take too much Amversio, talk to a doctor or pharmacist immediately. 
If you forget to take Amversio 
Do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten doses. If you forget to take a dose take it as soon as 
you remember it and continue the next dose as planned. 
If you stop taking Amversio 
Do not stop the treatment without consulting your doctor. Contact your doctor or pharmacist before 
stopping. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

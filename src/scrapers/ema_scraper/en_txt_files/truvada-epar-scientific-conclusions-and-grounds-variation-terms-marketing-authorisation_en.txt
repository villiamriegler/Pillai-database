Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for  emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil, the 
scientific conclusions of the CHMP are as follows: 
Having reviewed the cumulative safety review on osteopenia/osteoporosis, the PRAC considers that 
section 4.4 and section 5.1 of the emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil Summary of Product Characteristics 
need changing to enhance the information on bone effects. Annex II and the Package leaflet are updated 
accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil the CHMP is of the opinion 
that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is 
unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

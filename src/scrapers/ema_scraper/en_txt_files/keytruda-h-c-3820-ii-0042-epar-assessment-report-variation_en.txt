1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Merck Sharp & Dohme B.V. 
submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 20 December 2017 an application for a variation.  
The following variation was requested:

Extension of Indication to include treatment as monotherapy of recurrent or metastatic head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy based on the results 
from KEYNOTE-040 (KN040) with supportive data from two additional single arm studies (KEYNOTE-012/ 
KEYNOTE-055). KN040 is a randomized, multi-center, pivotal phase III study investigating KEYTRUDA as 
a monotherapy versus standard treatment (methotrexate, docetaxel or cetuximab) in 495 patients with 
recurrent or metastatic HNSCC who have previously progressed on prior platinum. As a consequence, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to include in SmPC section 5.2 the description of 
pembrolizumab PK results on time-dependent change in clearance using a time-dependent 
pharmacokinetic (TDPK) model structure rather than the static PK model structure. 
An updated RMP version 15.1 was provided as part of the application. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0059/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0059/2014 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
Scientific Advice related to the design of the pivotal study (Protocol 040/PN040) was received from the 
CHMP (EMEA/H/SA/2437/3/2014/II - EMA/CHMP/SAWP/545618/2014).

Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a humanized monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody that blocks the interaction 
between programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligands, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 
(PD-L1) and programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PD-L2). The PD-1 pathway, especially the PD-1 
receptor-ligand interaction, represents a major immune-control switch that may be engaged by ligands 
expressed in the tumor microenvironment to overcome active antitumor-specific T cell immune 
surveillance. 
Keytruda is currently approved in EU for metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma, 
refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma and advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma.

Problem statement 
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) describe an anatomically heterogeneous group of 
cancers encompassing a variety of tumours originating in the lip, oral cavity, hypopharynx, oropharynx, 
nasopharynx or larynx, oral cavity and laryngeal cancers being the most common. It is the sixth most 
common malignancy worldwide, accounting for 6% of all cancer cases and responsible for an estimated 
1–2% of all cancer deaths1 23. In Europe, approximately 140.000 new cases of HNSCC were diagnosed in 
2014, corresponding to an annual incidence of 43/100.000. Median age of diagnosis is in the late 60s and 
70s45.  
More than 90% of head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, originating from the epithelium 
of the mucosal lining of the upper aerodigestive tract. These neoplasms are aggressive in their biologic 
behaviour, resulting in significant destructive disease above the clavicle, with the development of local 
(cervical) lymph node metastases and distant metastases, even after effective local therapy. 
Significantly, 10 to 30% of patients with cancer of the lip or oral cavity subsequently develop second 
primary neoplasms of the upper aerodigestive tract. 
Tobacco, alcohol, male gender and older age are risk factors for HNSCC, together with HPV infection for 
cancers located in the oropharynx. Tobacco-related HNSCC disease has declined, whereas HPV-positive 
disease has increased6. 
Survival in HNSCC is predicted primarily by stage, anatomical site and HPV status. HPV-related 
oropharyngeal cancers represent a distinct entity in terms of biology, where HPV-negative HNSCC disease 
is driven by stepwise accumulation of mutations whereas HPV-positive disease is driven by the integration 
of 2 viral oncogenes that target the P53 tumour suppressor gene. Therefore, tumours have different 
clinical behavior, with HPV-positive disease having better prognosis and better response to treatment 
compared to HPV-negative cancers.  
Classical presentation of HNSCC includes pain, dysphagia, odynophagia, dysphonia, otalgia, hoarseness, 
and citrus intolerance. Human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal disease is characterized with early 
cervical lymph node metastases. Common sites of metastases include lymph nodes, bone, and lung. 
The challenges of R/M HNSCC include pain, speech, swallowing, breathing, and social function.  
Patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) HNSCC have a poor prognosis with median overall survival of 
under 1 year7.  
Current Therapies in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma 
Treatment options for patients with this disease vary according to the disease setting as well as other 
clinical characteristics. Patients with localized HNSCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer stages I-IVB) 
are treated with potentially curative therapy using ≥1 treatment modalities (surgery, radiation therapy, 
chemotherapy, and biologic therapy). However, many patients develop recurrent disease, with a 
recurrence rate in early-stage HNSCC of 10-20% and in locally advanced HNSCC of about 50%, with a 
predominance of locoregional failure. This population includes patients whose disease recurred locally or 
who developed distant metastasis after initial treatment for localized disease and the rare patients with 
distant metastasis at first presentation. Only a limited percentage of patients with localized recurrence

can be treated with curative intent, but the vast majority receives palliative treatment with systemic 
therapy. Treatment of patients with unresectable, persistent, recurrent or metastatic HNSCC is dictated 
in large part by the patient’s performance status, which is one of the most important factors associated 
with clinical outcome. The main treatment objectives are to prolong survival and/or provide symptom 
palliation.  
In the first-line treatment of R/M HNSCC, combination therapy with cetuximab plus cisplatin/carboplatin 
plus 5-fluorouracil followed by maintenance cetuximab (the “EXTREME” regimen) has shown the best 
results so far, with median survival of 10-14 months8. In clinical practice, other combinations, such as a 
taxane or cisplatin plus cetuximab, are also sometimes used as first-line treatment for R/M SCCHN when 
patients are not fit enough for the EXTREME regimen. After disease progression on or after 1L therapy in 
R/M HNSCC, the treatment options are participation in a clinical trial, systemic therapy or best supportive 
care. Systemic therapies may include cisplatin/carboplatin, 5-FU, cetuximab, docetaxel, paclitaxel, 
gemcitabine, vinorelbine, methotrexate, capecitabine and nivolumab. Overall, clinical trials showed a 
response rate up to 20%. Combination chemotherapy has not produced better survival outcomes 
compared to single-agent treatment.  
In 2017, Nivolumab was authorized in EU for the treatment of squamous cell cancer of the head and neck 
in adults progressing on or after platinum-based therapy, based on the result of the phase 3, randomised, 
open-label study (CA209141- Checkmate 141), where 361 HNSCC patients who have experienced 
disease progression during or within 6 months of receiving platinum-based therapy regimen were 
randomised 2:1 to receive either nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W (n=240) or investigator’s choice of either 
cetuximab (n=15), methotrexate (n = 52) or docetaxel (n=54). The primary efficacy outcome OS was in 
favour of nivolumab, showing HR of 0.71 (95% CI 0.55, 0.90) p-value 0.0048, median OS 7.72 (95%CI 
5.68, 8.77) vs 5.06 (95%CI 4.04, 6.24) months in nivolumab vs standard treatment respectively. PFS HR 
was 0.87 (95% CI 0.69, 1.11) p-value 0.2597, for a median PFS of 2.04 (95%CI 1.91, 2.14) vs 2.33 
(95%CI 1.97, 3.12). Confirmed ORR were 13.3% vs 5.8%, with a median duration of response of 9.7 
(2.8-20.3+) vs 4.0 (1.5+-8.5+) months.

Pembrolizumab in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma 
Pembrolizumab clinical development programme in R/M HNSCC included three clinical trials in 2L+ where 
pembrolizumab is used as monotherapy: the controlled study KN040 (presented as pivotal in this 
application) and the single arm trials KN012 and KN055 (supportive studies for the sought indication). In 
addition, the KN048 trial is ongoing in the 1L setting, exploring both the monotherapy and 
pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy. Estimated primary completion date of KN048 is 
December 2018 (from ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02358031).  
The MAH applied for the following indication:  
“KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy”. 
Based on the CHMP request to restrict pembrolizumab indication in the treatment of recurrent-metastatic 
HNSCC to PD-L1 expressing tumor with a TPS score ≥50%, the MAH updated the wording of the indication 
as follows:  
Assessment report  
EMA/543713/2018 
Page 10/151 
 
  
 
 
“KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a ≥ 50% TPS and 
progressing on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy (see section 5.1).” 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Pembrolizumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not be a significant 
risk to the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of 
Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), pembrolizumab is exempt from 
preparation of an Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) as the product and excipients do not pose a 
significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The applicant did not submit studies for the ERA. According to the guideline, in the case of products 
containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an ERA justifying the lack of ERA studies is 
acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Clinical pharmacology results for pembrolizumab specific to support approval in the treatment of adult 
patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC on or after platinum containing chemotherapy are available 
from study KEYNOTE-040 (KN040) with supportive data from two additional single arm studies 
(KEYNOTE-012 Cohort B and KEYNOTE-055). 
The updated clinical pharmacology results in this submission include: 
•  The  available  data  supporting  the  appropriateness  of  the  200  mg  Q3W  dose  of  pembrolizumab  for 
HNSCC.

Overview of bioanalytical methods and assay validation 
To support human PK assessment, an immunoassay method employing electrochemiluminescence (ECL) 
detection on the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assay platform was used for quantification of MK-3475 in 
serum samples collected during clinical studies.  
Initial method validation was conducted by Merck Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories (Oss, The 
Netherlands). Following method transfer of a refined version of the assay and subsequent validation at 
the contract research organization (CRO), Intertek (San Diego, CA), the method (2nd generation assay, 
Report 4020) was used to support bioanalysis of MK-3475 in serum samples from clinical study P001. An 
updated version of the method (3rd generation assay, Report 5018) was used to support bioanalysis of all 
samples from clinical studies subsequent to P001. The 3rd generation assay method was later transferred 
and cross-validated at a second CRO, PPD (Richmond, VA) to increase the level of automation, increase 
of sample throughput and reduce variability.  
The method validation documents for the quantitative determination of pembrolizumab are listed and 
summarised in the following tables:

Table 2: List of MK-3475 PK assay validation reports 
During the continued use of the 3rd generation assay at PPD it was noticed that variability at the LLOQ 
level of 10 ng/mL prevented the appropriate assessment of the influence of new disease states on the 
assay. Therefore it was decided to raise the LLOQ of the assay and change the concentration of the QCs 
to appropriately span the new range of the assay. 
Accuracy and precision of the new QCs were assessed and appeared to be within the already established 
accuracy and precision (Report 04GRV4). Moreover, due to the logistical difficulties in shipping clinical 
serum samples collected in China from China to PPD laboratories in USA, the 3rd generation assay at PPD 
was transferred and cross-validated at Wuxi AppTec laboratories in Shanghai, China (Report 04RYSL) and 
(Report 04P467).  
The validated method at Wuxi is utilized to support Pembrolizumab drug concentration analysis for study 
protocols where Chinese subjects are enrolled through clinical sites in China. The performance of the Wuxi 
validated method is summarized in the following table:

Overview of pembrolizumab ADA Method Validation 
The ADA assay was originally developed and validated at Merck Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories 
(Oss, The Netherlands) in November 2010, with a full assay validation. The assay was transferred to 
Intertek (San Diego, CA) and underwent method transfer validation in September 2011.  
The method was later transferred and re-validated at a second CRO, PPD (Richmond, VA) to perform ADA 
analysis at the same lab conducting quantitation of pembrolizumab in serum samples. 
Due to the logistical difficulties in shipping clinical serum sample out of China for bioanalytical testing, 
ADA method was fully validated at Wuxi AppTec laboratory in Shanghai, China to perform ADA analysis of 
samples for studies in which Chinese subjects are enrolled through clinical sites in China. A summary of 
these assay parameter performances is reported in the following table:

Table 4: Performance of the Wuxi ADA assay validation parameters 
With method developed at Intertek, the anti-CDR enriched ADA positive control at 250 ng/mL can tolerate 
up to 25 μg/mL of pembrolizumab. The method at PPD, which includes extended overnight incubation 
times and optimized acid neutralization timing for further drug tolerance enhancement, can tolerate up to 
124 μg/mL drug in an ADA positive control spiked at 250 ng/mL of anti-CDR enriched ADA. 
Assessment report

The method used at Wuxi achieved comparable drug tolerance to PPD; the method can tolerate up to 98 
μg/mL drug in an ADA positive control spiked at 250 ng/mL of anti-CDR enriched ADA.  
A statistical evaluation was conducted to compare the drug tolerance values obtained at Wuxi and PPD 
and it was concluded that PPD’s drug tolerance of 124 μg/mL drug at 250 ng/mL of ADA, being statistically 
similar to Wuxi’s drug tolerance, will be used for study data obtained from both of these laboratories to 
assess clinical relevance of immunogenicity. 
Pharmacokinetic in target population 
A focused PK analysis was conducted primarily to show the similarity of observed concentrations in 
subjects with HNSCC from study KN040 (with supportive data from study KN012 and KN055) with the 
predictions from the definitive population PK analysis. This analysis is presented in the PK report (Report 
04R7X0).  
The definitive population TDPK model seems adequate to describe the PK data in subjects with HNSCC 
(see below section on PK/PD Modelling for a description of the time-dependent pharmacokinetic (TDPK) 
model structure). 
Pharmacokinetic data in HNSCC adult subjects 
PK samples were collected and measured for 241 subjects in KN040 HNSCC (200 mg Q3W).  
PK schedule in KN040: Pre-dose pembrolizumab serum concentrations (Ctrough) were obtained within 24 
hours prior to dosing at Cycles 1, 2, 4 and 8 and every 4 cycles (12 weeks) thereafter. Post-dose serum 
concentrations (Cmax) were drawn within approximately 30 minutes after the end of the infusion in Cycle 
1 and Cycle 8. One additional PK sample is drawn between 72 and 168 hours (3-7 days) after Cycle 1 
dosing.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
KEYTRUDA is an antibody that binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its 
interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that 
has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. KEYTRUDA potentiates T-cell 
responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2, 
which are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the 
tumour microenvironment. 
Preclinical in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that use of mAb to block PD-1 and/or PD-L1 
enhances tumour-cell specific T-cell activation, cytokine production, anti-tumour effector mechanisms, 
and clearance of tumour cells by the immune system. In T-cell activation assays using human donor blood 
cells, the EC50 was in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 nM. Pembrolizumab also modulates the level of interleukin-2 
(IL-2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interferon gamma (IFNγ), and other cytokines. Importantly, 
the antibody potentiates existing immune responses only in the presence of antigen and does not 
non-specifically activate T cells. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Dose regimen 
A dosing regimen of 200 mg Q3W is recommended for pembrolizumab in the treatment of adult subjects 
with HNSCC. The pembrolizumab dosing regimen selected for KN040 was based upon the collective 
clinical experience of pembrolizumab monotherapy across multiple tumor types.  
Clinical response in patients from the HNSCC trials including treatment arms dosed at 200 mg Q3W 
(KN040, KN055 and KN012-B2) and 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN012-B) support the comparability of patient 
outcomes at the proposed dosing regimen of 200 mg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W. Efficacy results in 
Assessment report  
EMA/543713/2018 
Page 20/151 
 
  
 
subjects with HNSCC show no clinically meaningful difference between 200 mg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q2W 
dosing regimens. 
In KN012-B, patients received a pembrolizumab regimen of 10 mg/kg Q2W. The objective response rate 
(ORR) was 16.7% (95% CI: 8.3, 28.5) with median time to response of 3.7 months (range, 1.7-16.7 
months).  
In KN012-B2, where pembrolizumab was administered 200 mg Q3W, ORR was 18.2% (95% CI: 12.0, 
25.8) with median time to response of 2.1 months (range, 1.6-11.1 months).  
In KN055, the ORR for all subjects administered with 200 mg Q3W pembrolizumab was 16.4% (95% CI: 
11.2, 22.8) and the median time to response was 2.1 months (range, 1.6-11.6 months). 
The lack of a meaningful difference in efficacy across a >5-fold dose range from 200 mg Q3W to 10 mg/kg 
Q2W in subjects with HNSCC is consistent with the previously established dose- and/or 
exposure-response relationships for approved indications.  
Immunogenicity 
No new data are available for this submission since no more data are collected with respect to previous 
immunogenicity dataset. The existing immunogenicity assessment for pembrolizumab is based on a 
sufficiently large dataset of patients. 
In clinical studies in patients treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W, 200 mg Q3W, or 10 mg/kg Q2W 
or Q3W, 36 of 2,034 (1.8%) evaluable patients tested positive for treatment-emergent antibodies to 
pembrolizumab, of which 9 (0.4%) patients had neutralising antibodies against pembrolizumab. There 
was no evidence of an altered pharmacokinetic or safety profile with anti-pembrolizumab binding or 
neutralizing antibody development. 
2.3.1.  PK/PD modelling 
Previously, a pooled population PK analysis using data from the KN001, KN002 and KN006 studies was 
performed to characterize serum pembrolizumab concentrations over time based on a dataset including 
2188 subjects across the melanoma and NSCLC indications (Report 04DDV3).  
Subsequently, Pharmacokinetic data from KN010 and KN024 patients with NSCLC were added to the 
dataset, and the parameters from the existing model were re-estimated. 
The dataset of 2188 subjects with advanced melanoma and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) used in 
the definitive population PK analysis was expanded to include data from 653 subjects from KEYNOTE-010 
and 152 subjects from KEYNOTE-024 for a total N of 2993 subjects (16800 PK observations) included in 
the analysis. 
The addition of concentration data from KEYNOTE-010 and 024 did not meaningfully alter the previously 
established population PK model for Pembrolizumab (Report 04DDV3). This confirms that the prior 
analysis can be considered definitive with respect to informing the PK characteristics. The most recent 
reference dataset for monotherapy includes all available PK data from subjects enrolled on KEYNOTE-001 
(KN001), KEYNOTE-002 (KN002), KEYNOTE-006 (KN006), KEYNOTE-010 (KN010), and KEYNOTE-024 
(KN024), with an overall sample size of 2993. 
Over the course of recent clinical development, pembrolizumab PK disposition has been characterized via 
pooled population PK analyses using serum concentration-time data contributed from subjects across 
various clinical studies. While earlier population PK analyses were conducted using a two-compartment 
PK structural model with static clearance (CL) (i.e. no time-dependent changes in CL, referred to as a 
‘static model’), more recent analyses have included a time-dependent pharmacokinetic (TDPK) 
Assessment report  
EMA/543713/2018 
Page 21/151 
 
  
component for characterizing on-study changes in CL, with the intent of improving description of 
long-term pembrolizumab concentration-time data.  
The description of pembrolizumab PK in the US prescribing information and the EU SmPC are based on 
these two different population PK model structures. The model supporting US prescribing information 
involves estimating a time-dependent change in clearance using a time-dependent pharmacokinetic 
(TDPK) model structure, and the model supporting the EU SmPC assumes a static clearance (with no 
time-dependent changes). 
To support the harmonization of pembrolizumab PK information in the EU SmPC and US prescribing 
information, a final rerun of the TDPK parameterization and covariate search has been conducted, again 
using the current SmPC dataset (n=2993; table below).

General model development procedures, described in the original reports 04FYYY and 04FFLX, were 
followed with the new expanded dataset used in this analysis (16800 pembrolizumab concentration from 
2993 subjects).

In brief, the population PK analysis was performed using a non-linear mixed effects modelling approach. 
Model selection was based on the Log- Likelihood Criterion, goodness of fit plots and scientific plausibility. 
Identification of covariates was done using automated stepwise covariate model building. The covariate 
was retained in the model during the forward addition step if there was a reduction in the objective value, 
i.e. OFV, of 6.63 or more (P < 0.01, degree of freedom [df] = 1). In the subsequent backward deletion 
step, an OFV increase greater than 10.8 (P ≤ .001, df = 1) was required for a covariate to be retained in 
the model.

Reliability  of  the  present TDPK  model  was  checked  with  a  range  of  goodness of  fit  plots  as  well  as  a 
bootstrap evaluation and visual predictive checks. 
Plots of conditional weighted residuals versus population predictions and of conditional weighted residuals 
versus time after first dose are presented in Figure 5:

The present TDPK model parameter estimates and bootstrap estimates are presented in  
Table 10. The covariate model was fitted to 1000 bootstrap replicate datasets to evaluate its stability and 
performance. Among the 1000 runs, 137 (13.7%) reported ‘minimization terminated’ errors, and thus, 
were skipped when calculating the bootstrap results. The 95% CIs calculated from bootstrap for all of 
parameter estimates obtained from successfully converged bootstrapping runs are summarized in the

Comparison To Prior PK Analyses Supporting Product Labeling 
The results and performance of the static PK and TDPK models using KN001,-002,-006,-010, and -024

compared with results of the present analysis. Plots of conditional weighted residuals versus time after 
first dose of the previous static (04FFLX), previous TDPK (04FYYY), and present TDPK model are shown in 
Figure 7.

p1p2p6p10p24, time-dependant PK model from p1p2p6p10 and present TDPK model from

A comparison of parameter estimates between Static PK Model (04FFLX), previous Time-Dependent PK 
Model (04FYYY) and Present TDPK Model was provided in Table 8 (reported above).  
Consistent with prior findings, this TDPK model indicates that on-study changes in CL with time are small 
in magnitude (~20% average reduction) relative to the clinical dose range evaluated (~500% from 2 
mg/kg to 10 mg/kg). The covariate analysis was repeated and a similar set of covariates as selected for 
the original static PK model were identified for the TDPK model. In general, the PK parameter values, 
including magnitudes of these covariate effects were similar between the TD and current SmPC static PK 
models, suggesting no clinically significant impact of these new results.  
Estimation of derived pharmacokinetic parameters 
The population TDPK model described in this report was used to estimate secondary PK parameters of 
pembrolizumab for inclusion in product labelling: 
Pembrolizumab clearance (CV%) is approximately 23% lower [geometric mean, 195 mL/day (40%)] at 
steady state than that after the first dose [252mL/day (37%)]. The geometric mean value (CV%) for 
volume of distribution at steady state is 6.0 L (20%) and for terminal half-life (t1/2) is 22 days (32%). 
Steady-state concentrations of pembrolizumab were reached by 16 weeks of repeated dosing. 
The systemic accumulation of pembrolizumab at steady-state is 2.1 fold. The peak concentration (Cmax), 
trough concentration (Cmin), and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve at steady state 
(AUCss) of pembrolizumab increased dose proportionally in the dose range of 2 to 10 mg/kg every 3 
weeks.

2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacology results for pembrolizumab specific to support approval in the treatment of adult 
patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC on or after platinum containing chemotherapy are available 
from study KEYNOTE-040 (KN040) with supportive data from two additional single arm studies 
(KEYNOTE-012 Cohort B and KEYNOTE-055). 
The approach taken by the applicant was to compare the observed PK data for the current indication, 
HNSCC, with the predictions from the reference model. 
The reference pharmacokinetic model for this submission was the TDPK model instead of the previous 
Static PK model (Report 04DDV3). In fact, over the course of recent clinical development, pembrolizumab 
PK disposition has been characterized via pooled population PK analyses using serum concentration-time 
data contributed from subjects across various clinical studies. While earlier population PK analyses were 
conducted using a two-compartment PK structural model with static clearance (CL) (i.e. no 
time-dependent changes in CL, referred to as a ‘static model’), more recent analyses have included a 
time-dependent pharmacokinetic (TDPK) component for characterizing on-study changes in CL, with the 
intent of improving description of long-term pembrolizumab concentration-time data.  
Pembrolizumab serum concentrations in cycle 1, 2 and 8 observed at 200 mg Q3W in HNSCC patients are 
comparable to the range of concentrations at the same dose levels observed in patients with other type 
of cancer (Melanoma, NSCLC, UC…), and as general consideration, slight differences are considered 
unlikely to be clinically relevant in light of the flat relationship between dose and exposure. 
The observed concentrations in HNSCC generally fall within the range of predicted concentrations, both 
after first dose and at steady state (at and after cycle 8) indicating that the definitive population TDPK 
model provides an adequate representation of the pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics in HNSCC, in 
addition to melanoma and NSCLC. 
Further to the CHMP request, the MAH provided a direct comparison of the observed PK data (trough and 
peak concentrations at each cycle) with those obtained with the 200 mg Q3W flat dose for other tumour 
types (data not shown). Boxplots showed that concentrations from KEYNOTE-040 were comparable with 
the concentrations at the same time points for the same 200 mg Q3W dose from across multiple 
protocols/tumour types. 
The MAH took the opportunity of this extension of indication to include in SmPC section 5.2 the description 
of pembrolizumab PK results on time-dependent change in clearance using a time-dependent 
pharmacokinetic (TDPK) model structure rather than the static PK model structure. 
The magnitude of on-study change in clearance with the TDPK model is about 20%, therefore it is not 
considered clinically meaningful. The proposed final dataset is based on the EU SmPC dataset consisting 
of PK data from KEYNOTE-001,-002, -006, -010 and -024 (n=2993).  
An increment of roughly 20% and 15%, for CL and Q respectively, as well as a decrement of the %CV 
values from 36.8% to 31.4% for both CL and Q parameters has been observed in the proposed updated 
label time dependent model (TDPK). 
Overall, the MAH’s proposal to implement a TDPK model structure is endorsed as well as the proposed 
update of PK parameters obtained from this model in EU SmPC section 5.2. 
No dose finding study was conducted for pembrolizumab monotherapy for treatment of HNSCC. The 
recommended dose and schedule of pembrolizumab monotherapy for treatment of HNSCC is the same as 
that approved for 1L NSCLC, cHL and urothelial carcinoma monotherapy: 200 mg IV infusion over 60 
minutes Q3W. This is considered acceptable.

Regarding immunogenicity, no new data are available for this submission since no more data are 
collected respect to the previous immunogenicity dataset. The existing immunogenicity assessment for 
pembrolizumab is based on a sufficiently large dataset of 3268 patients, with a very low observed rate of 
treatment emergent ADA (1.8%) and no demonstrated impact on efficacy or safety. This percentage was 
consistent across tumor type. 
Bioanalytical methods and assay validation 
The 3rd generation assay at PPD was transferred and cross-validated at Wuxi AppTec laboratories in 
Shanghai, China (Report 04RYSL) and (Report 04P467), due to the logistical difficulties in shipping clinical 
serum samples collected in China from China to PPD laboratories in USA.  
The validated method at Wuxi is utilized to support Pembrolizumab drug concentration analysis for study 
protocols where Chinese subjects are enrolled through clinical sites in China. The methods’ main 
characteristics were correctly investigated, and resulted within the required specifications. The two 
methods were then compared through cross-validation. 
A cross-validation exercise between the 3rd generation assay at PPD and method developed at Wuxi was 
performed with 30 clinical samples to determine the methods’ result comparability. The MAH concluded 
that the cross lab reproducibility (PPD-Wuxi) on the same set of 30 pooled study samples was 
demonstrated considering that 29 out of 30 of tested samples were within the 30% relative bias. 
However, these results are not compliant with the acceptance criteria reported in the relevant Guideline 
on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2**) section 4.3 Cross 
validation: […] For study samples, the difference between the two values obtained should be within 20% 
of the mean for at least 67% of the repeats.[…]. In the submitted cross-validation method, the difference 
between the two values were within 20% only for 17 pooled study samples out of 30 (56,7%). Data 
demonstrate that the concentration data obtained at Wuxi AppTec laboratories were lower when 
compared to the concentration data obtained at PPD. 
Considering that “the outcome of the cross validation is critical in determining whether the obtained data 
are reliable and whether they can be compared and used”, the MAH was requested to discuss on this issue 
and extensively justify deviation from relevant guideline.  
The MAH clarified that all pembrolizumab serum concentration submitted in this extension of indication 
(PK  data  from    KEYNOTE-040,  and  from  KEYNOTE-012/KEYNOTE-055)  were  generated  at  PPD 
laboratories while analysis of pembrolizumab serum concentrations at Wuxi AppTec laboratories (located 
in Shanghai, China) is limited to clinical sample collections from clinics in China. 
Regarding  the  cross  validation  per  se,  the  MAH  will  consider  the  cross-validation  data  in  a  manner 
consistent with the relevant guideline prior to the submission of future marketing applications, which may 
include pembrolizumab serum concentration data generated at multiple laboratories.  
2.3.3.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of pembrolizumab has been sufficiently investigated 
for the extension of the indication of pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for treatment of HNSCC. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
To support the Keytruda extension of indication as treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic 
(R/M) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after 
platinum-containing chemotherapy, the MAH submitted the results of the pivotal trial KEYNOTE-040 
study (KN040), an open-label, Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, active-controlled clinical trial 
Assessment report  
EMA/543713/2018 
Page 27/151 
 
  
evaluating the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks [Q3W]) versus the choice of 
3 different standard treatment options (ie, methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab) in subjects with 
disease progression occurring during or after a platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen (eg, 
carboplatin or cisplatin) administered either as 1L or 2L treatment (eg, R/M setting), or 
recurrence/disease progression within 3 to 6 months following combination therapy with 
platinum-containing chemotherapy (eg, locally advanced setting).  
In addition, data derived from two supportive studies KEYNOTE-012 (KN012) and KEYNOTE-055 (KN055) 
have been provided. KN012 is an open-label, multicohort, multicenter, non-randomized Phase 1b trial of 
pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors. Cohort B (10 mg/kg Q2W) enrolled subjects with 
PD-L1 positive (based on a prototype IHC assay ≥1% PD-L1 membrane staining of tumor cells or the 
presence of a stromal banding pattern) HNSCC and Cohort B2 (200 mg Q3W) is an “all comers” cohort 
(enrolling HNSCC subjects regardless of PD-L1 tumor status). Data from Cohorts B and B2 have been 
pooled and presented here. KN055 is an open-label, single-cohort, multicenter, non-randomized Phase 2 
trial of pembrolizumab (200 mg Q3W) in subjects with R/M HNSCC regardless of PD-L1 or HPV status and 
whose disease had progressed on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy and cetuximab therapy. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No specific dose-response studies have been performed for HNSCC population. Pembrolizumab has been 
administered in R/M HNSCC at a fixed dose regimen of 200 mg Q3W to subjects in all three trials, with the 
exception of cohort B in KN012 (including 61 patients PD-L1 positive) who received pembrolizumab at 10 
mg/kg Q2W.  
Pembrolizumab was initially approved for advanced melanoma at 2 mg/kg Q3W. Subsequent approvals 
for adult subjects were at 200 mg Q3W dosing regimens for multiple other indications. The choice of the 
switch to the flat dose was based on simulations performed using the population PK model of 
pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are 
consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient 
exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response 
and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are 
well tolerated and safe.

Main inclusion criteria 
•  Age ≥ 18 years  
•  Histologically or cytologically-confirmed recurrent (recurrent disease that is not amenable to curative 
treatment with local and/or systemic therapies) or metastatic (disseminated) head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx that is considered 
incurable by local therapies. Subjects may not have any other primary tumor site (e.g. nasopharynx). 
•

a. Disease progression after treatment with a platinum-containing regimen for recurrent (disease not 
amenable to curative treatment)/metastatic disease. Note: Disease progression may occur at any time 
during or after a platinum-containing regimen (e.g. carboplatin or cisplatin) which was administered in 
either 1L or 2L in the recurrent/metastatic setting     
OR 
b. Recurrence/progression within 6 months of prior multimodal therapy using platinum (e.g. locally 
advanced setting) 
•  Have results from local testing of HPV positivity for oropharyngeal cancer defined as p16 IHC testing 
using the CINtec® assay and a 70% cutoff point. Note: HPV stratification in this trial will be 
performed using local or central testing of HPV status in patients with oropharynx cancer. Oral cavity, 
hypopharynx, and larynx cancer are not required to undergo HPV testing by p16 IHC as by convention 
they are assumed to be HPV negative. 
•  Have provided tissue for PD-L1 biomarker analysis – and received the PD-L1 results – (PD-L1 analysis 
will be blinded to both site and sponsor) from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy. Note: 
Patients for whom newly obtained samples cannot be obtained (e.g. inaccessible or patient safety 
concern) may submit an archived specimen only upon agreement from the Sponsor. Note: If 
emerging data indicate a high concordance in PD-L1 expression scores between newly obtained and 
archival samples, archived samples may be acceptable. 
•  Have radiographically measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 as determined by the site. Tumor 
lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been 
demonstrated in such lesions.

The choice of standard therapy for a subject must be identified and documented prior to randomization. 
Patients randomized to standard therapy who discontinue will not be crossed-over to pembrolizumab. 
Subjects resistant to one of the 3 standard treatments in this trial (ie, methotrexate, docetaxel, or 
cetuximab) could not receive the same agent if randomized to the standard treatment group. 
Administration of trial treatments continued until any of the following occurred: documented disease 
progression (i.e. radiographic PD confirmed by the site at least 28 days after verification of progression by 
central imaging vendor, with the option of continuing treatment in patient is clinically stable while 
awaiting radiologic confirmation of progression), unacceptable AEs, intercurrent illness that prevented 
further administration of treatment, investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject, subject (or legally

acceptable representative) requested treatment discontinuation, pregnancy, subject noncompliance, 
completion of 24 months of treatment with pembrolizumab, subject lost to follow-up, or administrative 
reasons. 
Discontinuation of treatment may be considered for subjects with confirmed CR treated for at least 24 
weeks with pembrolizumab and had at least two treatments with pembrolizumab beyond the date when 
the initial CR was declared. 
The first on-study imaging was at 9 weeks after first dose of study treatment and then every 6 weeks 
thereafter or more frequently if clinically indicated. After 1 year, imaging time point will occur every 9 
weeks.  
In subjects who discontinue study therapy without centrally verified disease progression, a radiologic 
evaluation should be performed at the time of treatment discontinuation (i.e., date of discontinue ± 4 
week window).

Rationale for Changing the PD-L1 Scoring Method and Cutoff from Tumour Proportion Score 
(TPS) ≥ 50% to Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥ 1 in KEYNOTE-040 
TPS is defined as the percentage of viable tumor cells showing partial or complete membrane staining at 
any intensity. TPS ≥ 50% has been used as the initial pre-specified scoring method and cutoff to assess 
PD-L1 status and as stratification factor in KN040. 
However, evidence on literature and data for pembrolizumab in HNSCC from KN012 and in other solid 
tumours showed that PDL1 expression on Tumour Infiltrating Immune Cells significantly contributes to 
clinical outcome upon treatment with pembrolizumab. Therefore a new scoring system called Combined 
Positive Score (CPS) was developed by the MAH. CPS is defined as the number of PD-L1 staining cells 
(tumour cells, lymphocytes, macrophages) divided by the total number of viable tumour cells, multiplied 
by 100. This scoring system with ≥ 1 cutoff has been selected as the primary biomarker in Gastric, 
Bladder and TNBC pembrolizumab trials.  
To understand the role of PDL1 expression on infiltrating inflammatory cells in HNSCC in predicting 
outcome with pembrolizumab, a retrospective evaluation of 190 HNSCC patients with IHC scoring in 
KN012 Cohorts B (61 pts, PD-L1 ≥1%, 10 mg/kg pembrolizumab) and B2 (132 pts, any PD-L1 status, 200 
mg) was performed. ROC curves for CPS and TPS showed statistically significant difference (p=0.004 2 
sided) in the AUC. 
Cohort B2 (with any PD-L1 status) was analysed alone. The incorporation of inflammatory cell staining 
improved sensitivity for detecting responders.

PPV: positive predictive value, the response rate above the cutoff

Prevalence: the percentage of patients with CPS scores above the cutoff 
Clinical KN012 results ORR, PFS and OS were analysed according to both TPS and CPS score in all 
population (cohort B + B2, n=190). Curves for PFS according to TPS at cutoff <1% or ≥1% were 
overlapping, as well as for OS. 
Based on the results from KN012, the KN040 clinical protocol was amended, prior to data analysis, to 
include CPS ≥ 1 as the primary PD-L1 scoring method and cutoff. TPS ≥ 50% was also assessed, but as 
a pre-defined exploratory objective.  
Sample size 
Approximately 466 subjects were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the pembrolizumab group or the 
standard treatment group. 
This was an event driven trial. The final OS analysis in all subjects was to be conducted after ~340 deaths 
occurred between the pembrolizumab group and the standard treatment group. Under the proportional 
hazard assumption with 340 events at the final analysis, the study provided 90% power to demonstrate 
superiority in OS of pembrolizumab relative to standard treatment at the alpha = 2.5% (one-sided) level 
with a true hazard ratio (HR) of 0.7. Success for OS at the final analysis approximately corresponded to 
an observed hazard ratio of <0.80.  
The sample size calculation was based on the following assumptions: (1) OS follows an exponential 
distribution with a median of 6.2 months in the standard treatment group; (2) hazard ratio between 
MK-3475 and standard treatment is 0.7; (3) an enrollment period of 16 months; and (4) a yearly 
discontinuation from trial rate of 5%. 
Randomisation 
Randomization occurred centrally using an IVRS/IWRS. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
pembrolizumab or standard treatment in an unblinded fashion using centrally randomized blocks. 
Randomization was stratified according to the following factors: 
• 
ECOG Performance Status (0 versus 1) 
•  HPV status (positive vs negative) 
• 
PD-L1 expression status (PD-L1 strongly positive [TPS ≥50% TPS] versus PD-L1 not strongly 
positive [TPS <50%] or not able to be determined for any level)  
HPV stratification in this trial was performed using local or central testing of HPV status in subjects with 
oropharynx cancer. Oral cavity, hypopharynx, and larynx cancer were not required to undergo HPV 
testing by p16 IHC as by convention they were assumed to be HPV negative. Results from local testing of 
HPV positivity for oropharyngeal cancer were defined as p16 IHC testing using the CINtec® assay and a 
70% cutoff point. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label trial.

EMA/543713/2018

Statistical methods 
The intention-to-treat (ITT) population was used for the analysis of efficacy data.  
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival curves. The treatment difference in survival 
was assessed by the stratified log-rank test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's 
method of tie handling was used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference. The hazard ratio 
and its 95% confidence interval from the stratified Cox model with a single treatment covariate were 
reported. The same stratification factors used for randomization were applied to both the stratified 
log-rank test and the stratified Cox model for all subject population as well as PD-L1 1% CPS subject 
population. For the primary OS analysis in all subjects, an additional sensitivity analysis replacing the 
PD-L1 Strong Positive vs. Not Strong Positive by the PD-L1 1% CPS vs. Not 1% CPS in the stratified 
analysis was performed. 
Subjects in the standard therapy arm were expected to discontinue treatment earlier compared to 
subjects in the pembrolizumab arm and might switch to another anti PD-1 treatment following verification 
of progressive disease by central review. As an exploratory analysis, the Rank Preserving Structural 
Failure Time (RPSFT) model proposed by Robins and Tsiatis (1991) [49] was used to adjust for the effect 
of crossover to other PD-1 therapies on OS. 
The 95% confidence intervals of the hazard ratio for OS after adjustment of the cross-over effect were 
provided. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the OS rate at 9 weeks, 27 weeks (when most cross-overs are 
likely to occur) and other time points of interest were compared between the two treatment groups to 
explore the confounding effect of subsequent treatments. 
For PFS endpoint the same analysis defined for OS endpoint and based on Kaplan Meier method and Cox 
proportional hazard model were applied. The proportional hazard assumption was tested at the 0.05 
significance level by including treatment*function(time) as a factor in the model; nonsignificance 
(p>0.05) of this factor suggested proportionality. A kernel-based estimate of log-hazard vs. time was 
used to identify the appropriate functional form of the treatment effect-by-time interaction in a Cox PH 
model. Further, a visual examination of the plot of the differences in the log versus time for each level of 
treatment group was examined. To account for the possible non-proportional hazards effect associated 
with immunotherapies, a supportive analysis was conducted using a test for the restricted mean survival 
time (RMST) proposed by Uno, Tian, et al for equality of two survival functions based on weighted 
differences of Kaplan-Meier curves. Thus, the PFS within each treatment group was estimated using this 
approach, the 95% confidence intervals for the difference were computed, and a test for differences 
between treatment groups were performed. The cutoff for determining the RMST was the last month for 
which at least 30 subjects within each treatment group were still at risk. 
One key assumption for the stratified Cox proportional hazard model is that the hazard ratio (HR) is 
constant across strata. If strong departures from constant HR are observed in the stratified PFS analysis 
for all subjects, a sensitivity analysis may be performed using the twostep weighted Cox model approach 
by Mehrotra et al [52]. In this approach, the treatment effect is estimated within each stratum and the 
stratum-specific estimates are subsequently combined using sample size weights. 
The family-wise type I error rate for this study was controlled at 2.5% (one-sided) with full alpha 
allocated to the OS hypothesis in all subjects (H1). A Hwang-Shih-DeCani alpha spending function with 
the gamma parameter (-4) and beta-spending function with the gamma parameter (-16) were 
constructed to implement group sequential boundaries that control the type I error rate as well as allow 
for non-binding futility analysis. Two interim analyses for OS in all subjects were planned in this trial and 
further details of the interim analysis strategy can be found in following table.

The following figure shows the hierarchical order for testing key secondary endpoints and alpha spending 
scheme according to the method of Maurer and Bretz. 
Stratified Miettinen and Nurminen’s method with strata weighting by sample size were used for 
comparison of the objective response rates between the treatment groups. A 95% confidence interval for 
the difference in response rates between the pembrolizumab arm and the standard therapy arm were 
provided. The same stratification factors used for randomization were applied to the analysis. ORR by site 
radiology assessment and ORR in the subgroup of subjects with PD-L1 1% CPS were analyzed using the 
same approach as the primary ORR analysis.

Response duration was summarized descriptively using Kaplan-Meier medians and quartiles. Only the 
subset of subjects who showed a complete response or partial response were included in this analysis.  
An exploratory analysis of PFS2 was conducted using the same methods as for the secondary analysis of 
PFS.  
Exploratory analyses of the treatment effect comparing pembrolizumab to standard treatment for OS, 
PFS, and ORR using RECIST 1.1 as assessed by blinded independent radiology review in the subgroup of 
subjects with strongly positive PD-L1 expression defined by ≥50% TPS were carried out. 
EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ H&N35, and EQ-5D were summarized as part of the exploratory analysis. 
Longitudinal and descriptive data analysis were used to evaluate patient-reported outcomes. Several 
approaches were considered to address the issue of informative missing data: (i) truncating the analysis 
observation period at the visit closest to median duration of treatment in the comparator arm, (ii) 
hierarchical pattern mixture models incorporating reason for missingness (a model that treats disease 
progression as a time varying covariate) and (iii) multiple imputation methods. The difference in PRO 
score for progressed patients compared to patients with no radiographic evidence of tumor progression 
was evaluated within each treatment arm. For HEA, descriptive statistics by treatment group were 
includes total counts of each type of healthcare contact, as well as the total number of hospital days.

Recruitment 
A total of 699 subjects were screened. Overall, 495 subjects (247 versus 248) were randomized in 100 
centers worldwide (21 countries, 97 centers randomized subjects to trial treatment: Australia, Belgium, 
Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, 
Puerto Rico, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, United States) and 
were included in the ITT population. Enrollment was from 03-DEC-2014 to 13-MAY-2016 (~17 months).

The data cut-off for the analysis was 15-MAY-2017 (one year after the last patient was enrolled). 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments: 
A total of 11 protocol amendments to the original protocol, including 3 global and 8 country-specific, were 
implemented during the study. Main changes are summarized below: 
Table 15: Global amendments to the protocol 
Protocol or Amendment  Main changes  
Protocol (01-AUG-2014)  
Original protocol (PFS and OS as co-primary objectives in all subjects) 
Amendment 01  
Increased number from 466 to 600;  
(27-FEB-2015) 
added hypotheses for PFS and OS in the PD-L1 Strong Positive population (TPS ≥50%) as 
primary objectives (4 primary hypotheses);  
added hypotheses for PFS and OS in the CPS >1 PD-L1 positive population as secondary 
objectives  
Amendment 10 
Decreased the sample size from 600 to 466 subjects; 
(10-MAR-2016) 
kept OS in all subjects as the single primary hypothesis and downgraded OS and PFS in 
the PD-L1 positive subjects from primary hypotheses to key secondary hypotheses; 
replaced hypotheses on the PD-L1 population with hypotheses on the CPS ≥1 population; 
promoted ORR to a key secondary endpoints;  
updated language to include PD-L1 status masking and included the role of unblinded 
Sponsor personnel. 
Amendment 11  
Updated, in the Statistical Analysis Plan, the alpha-spending language, power calculation, 
(02-NOV-2016) 
Protocol deviations: 
and timing of the final analysis to reflect the change to the number of death events at the 
final analysis. 
The medical monitoring process included a review of all major deviations documented as of 13-NOV-2017 
(n=90) to identify a subgroup of subjects with deviations that were considered clinically relevant (n=11). 
Clinically relevant major deviations included one subject who received prohibited medication while on 
study treatment (1) and subjects who did not meet entry criteria (10) as below:  
•  1 patient was enrolled without having been treated with failed platinum therapy. 
•  4 subjects received three or more lines of therapy prior to screening 
•  3 subjects did not meet inclusion criteria 4b: Recurrence/progression within 6 months of prior 
multimodal therapy using platinum (e.g. locally advanced setting) 
•  1 patient with a tumour lesion situated in a previously irradiated area not being progressive (=not 
measurable per inclusion criteria) 
•  1 subject did not meet entry criteria due to prior chemo specifics not obtained through medical 
records from Mexico. 
Assessment report

Page 39/151 
 
  
The remaining deviations were minor and/or not clinically relevant and did not affect subject safety or the 
interpretation of trial results.

Numbers analysed 
Efficacy analyses were based on ITT population (randomized subjects were included regardless of 
whether or not they received trial treatment) which include 495 subjects (247 in the pembrolizumab 
treatment group and 248 in the standard treatment group). 
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary analysis was based on a data cut-off date of 15-MAY-2017 and a database lock date of 
04-JUN-2017; however, the database did not fully capture data on all subjects who had died as of the 
data cutoff date of 15-MAY-2017 as there was incomplete collection of survival data on 12/388 subjects 
(11 deaths and 1 confirmed alive status). Critical changes to the database were made to capture all death 
events on 3 occasions (26-AUG-2017, 25-SEP-2017, and 13-OCT-2017) permitting the entry of survival 
data that had not been captured in the database lock of 04-JUN-2017.  
Unless specifically noted otherwise, all efficacy results provided are based on a database lock 
date of 13-OCT-2017, at which time data on all subjects who had died as of the data cut-off date of 
15-MAY-2017 were included in the database.  
The only p-value provided for statistical inference is the one for the primary OS analysis in all subjects 
based on the 04-JUN-2017 database lock. All other p-values, including those based on the 13-OCT-2017 
database update, are considered nominal and are not adjusted for multiplicity.

Primary endpoint: OS (DBL 04-JUN-2017) 
At the time of the database lock on 04-JUN-2017, data on 377 (97.2%) of 388 subjects who had died as 
of the data cutoff date of 15-MAY-2017 were included in the database. This is the only p-value provided 
for statistical inference. The OS boundary of 0.0316 narrowly missed the primary statistical hypothesis of 
a p-value OS boundary of 0.0175 for 377 events (deaths). Median follow-up for OS was 7.8 months 
(range, 0.1, 28.6 months).

PFS per modified RECIST 
Modified RECIST 1.1, which takes into account the unique tumor response patterns seen with 
pembrolizumab treatment (eg, tumour flare), was also used by investigators for making treatment 
decisions. PFS per modified RECIST was assessed at least 4 weeks after confirmation of PD per RECIST 
1.1. 
Figure 12: Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS based on BICR per modified RECIST (ITT 
population) 
Median PFS according to modified RECIST 1.1 was 3.5 vs 4.8 months in pembrolizumab vs standard 
treatment arm, respectively, (HR = 1.04 [95% CI: 0.86, 1.27]). PFS rate at 6 months was 35.3% and 
41.1%, at 9 months was 25.8% and 26.1%, and at 12 months was 18.7 and 13.7% by KM estimation.  
An updated analysis was conducted in which the initial PD date was used as the PD event date per 
mRECIST for subjects who had disease progression per RECIST 1.1 without confirmation. In this 
corrected analysis, the median PFS per modified RECIST (pembrolizumab:2.1 months, 95% CI: (2.1, 
2.4); standard treatment: 2.3 months, 95% CI: 2.1, 2.9) is largely the same as that per RECIST 1.1.

Table 27: Summary of best objective response BICR per RECIST 1.1 (ITT population) 
Confirmed responses were 26 (10.5%) and 18 (7.3%) in pembrolizumab and standard treatment group 
respectively (the scan for confirmation of response was performed at the earliest 4 weeks after the first 
indication of response, or at the next scheduled scan (e.g. 6 weeks later), whichever clinically indicated). 
ORR by investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1 was consistent with the ORR according to BICR: 
pembrolizumab 16.2% (95%CI 11.8, 21.4) vs standard treatment 10.1% (95%CI 6.6, 14.5), with the 
exception of 4 additional CRs recorded in the pembrolizumab group.

Health-related Quality of Life (Exploratory Endpoint) 
Electronic patient reported outcomes (ePROs) were administered prior to all study procedures, and were 
to be performed prior to Cycle 1,2,3,4 and every 2 cycles thereafter (e.g., Cycle 6,8,10) up to a year or 
End of Treatment, whichever occurs first, and the 30-day safety follow-up visit. The primary analysis for 
PRO was based on a quality-of-life-related full analysis set (FAS) population, which consists of all 
randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment, and had completed at least one 
PRO assessment. 
Changes from baseline in the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-H&N35 were primarily evaluated at Week 
9 and at Week 15. Supportive analyses on the mean change from baseline to Week 21 and 27.   
Assessment report  
EMA/543713/2018 
Page 52/151 
 
  
 
 
Compliance for both questionnaires C30 and H&N35 was approximately 95% in both arms at baseline, 
88% vs 80% in pembrolizumab vs control arm at Week 9, 75% in both arms at Week 15, 84% vs 69% at 
Week 21, 86% vs 64% at Week 27. 
EORTC QLQ-C30: 
Baseline global health status/QOL scores were similar between treatment arms in EORTC QLQ-C30. 
Over 15 weeks of follow-up, subjects receiving pembrolizumab had stable global health status/QOL, while 
those treated with standard treatment had a decline of global health status/QOL. 
Subjects in the pembrolizumab arm exhibited stable scores at Week 9/Week 15 relative to baseline in 
most of the functioning and symptom domains of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (i.e. 95% CIs mostly included 
zero), except for the physical and cognitive functioning score which exhibited a decline from baseline to 
Week 15.

EORTC QLQ-H&N35: 
Subjects in the pembrolizumab and standard treatment arms generally exhibited stable or slight 
numerical worsening from baseline to Week 9/Week 15 in most of the symptom domains of the EORTC 
QLQ-H&N35 (i.e. 95% CIs mostly included zero). As an exception, dry mouth at Week 15 remained stable 
relative to baseline in the pembrolizumab arm and improved relative to baseline in the standard 
treatment arm. At Week 9/Week 15, the proportions of subjects with “deteriorated” status for the 
symptom domains of the EORTC QLQ-H&N35 in the pembrolizumab arm were generally smaller or similar 
to the standard treatment arm with few exceptions (dry mouth at Week 15). 
EQ-5D: 
Subjects in both the pembrolizumab and standard treatment arms exhibited stable or slight numerical 
worsening from baseline to Week 9/Week 15 in the EQ-5D visual analog scale and utility scores.

OS analyses 
Proportional hazards (PH) assumption 
The PH assumption for OS was examined using both graphical and analytical methods. 
• 
• 
Plot of log(-log(survival)) against log(time) was generated. If the PH assumption was satisfied then 
the curves should be approximately parallel to each other. 
Plot of Schoenfeld residuals versus survival time was generated. If the PH assumption was satisfied 
then the plot of scaled residuals over time should be randomly distributed at either side of the “zero” 
line.

OS Sensitivity analyses - 2-step Cox model of OS 
A sensitivity analysis using the two-step weighted Cox model approach was performed to adjust for 
non-constant hazard ratio across strata for OS (PD-L1 50%, HPV status, and ECOG status). In this 
approach, the treatment effect is estimated within each stratum and the stratum-specific estimates are 
subsequently combined using sample size weights.

OS sensitivity analyses with regard to subsequent immunotherapy use 
No pre-specified crossover of subjects from standard treatment to immunotherapy was defined in the 
protocol. However, unplanned crossover was reported and analysed. Subsequent immunotherapies used

by subjects in the KN040 trial included: nivolumab, anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody (unspecified), 
anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibody (unspecified), pembrolizumab, avelumab, tremelimumab, durvalumab, 
utomilumab, durvalumab (+) tremelimumab. 
In the ITT population, 42 subjects crossed over to subsequent immunotherapy (checkpoint inhibitors or 
immunotherapy) post-randomization; 30 (23%) in North America (NA) and 12 (4.0%) in European Union 
(EU). There were no subjects who crossed over to subsequent immunotherapy in the Rest of World 
(ROW).  
Table 37: Post-randomization Subsequent Medication (Crossover to Checkpoint Inhibitors or 
Immunotherapy at any Time) (ITT Population) 
To  examine  the  impact  of  crossover  to  subsequent  immunotherapy,  three  sensitivity  analyses  were 
conducted: 
1.  subjects  with  subsequent  immunotherapy  were  censored  at  the  initiation  of  subsequent 
immunotherapy:  HR = 0.72 (95%CI 0.58, 0.88), p-value 0.00075 
2.  subjects with subsequent immunotherapy were excluded:  HR = 0.66 (95%CI 0.54, 0.82), p-value 
0.00005 
3.  the time of the first initiation of subsequent immunotherapy was included in a Cox regression model 
as a time varying adjustment covariate along with the pembrolizumab treatment effect:  HR = 0.73 
(95%CI 0.60, 0.90), p-value 0.0015 (CSR KN040 table 11-6) (The same analysis in all subjects using 
time-varying adjustment covariate method performed at the initial DBL of 04-JUN-2017 yielded an 
HR = 0.76 [95%CI 0.62, 0.93], p-value = 0.0045).

The MAH has provided the results for the post-hoc exploratory subgroup of subjects with CPS≥1 and 
TPS<50% population.  KEYNOTE-040 was not designed to be adequately powered to test subjects with 
CPS ≥1 and TPS <50%, thus evaluation of OS in this underpowered subgroup should be considered 
hypothesis generating.

Methods 
Study participant  
The trial enrolled male/female subjects of at least 18 years of age, ECOG 0-1 and adequate organ 
functions. Subjects must have had histologically or cytologically-confirmed R/M HNSCC of the oral cavity, 
oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx that was considered incurable by local therapies (subjects with 
oropharynx cancer must have had an assessment of HPV status from tumor tissue). 
Subjects must have been resistant to both platinum (either cisplatin or carboplatin) and cetuximab-based 
therapy, i.e. tumor progression or recurrence within 6 months of the last dose of platinum and cetuximab 
therapy in the adjuvant (eg, with radiation after surgery), primary (eg, with radiation), recurrent, or 
metastatic setting. Platinum and cetuximab did not need to be given concurrently; however, subjects 
must have recurred within 6 months of the last dose for each of these therapies. Any number of previous 
systemic regimens given for recurrent and/or metastatic disease was allowed. 
Subjects must have provided tissue for PD-L1 biomarker analysis from a newly obtained core or excisional 
biopsy (archived specimen may be submitted upon agreement from the Sponsor). 
Subjects must have had measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 as determined by central review. 
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area were considered measurable if progression had 
been demonstrated in such lesions.  
Subject with known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis, 
chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study Day 
1, active autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment in past 2 years (ie, with use of disease 
modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs), prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, 
anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent active infection, active non infectious pneumonitis, HIV, HBV, HCV were 
excluded. 
Treatments  
All patients received 200 mg of pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (Q3W).   
The first imaging assessment was performed at 9 weeks, then every 6 weeks to complete the first year of 
treatment, then every 9 weeks for subjects who remained on treatment for the 2nd year of 
pembrolizumab.

RECIST 1.1 response rate as assessed by the independent central radiology vendor was used as the 
primary efficacy endpoint.  
If radiologic imaging showed PD, tumor assessment might be repeated ≥4 weeks later at the site in order 
to confirm PD with the option of continuing treatment for clinically stable subjects.  
Subjects who attained an investigator-determined confirmed CR might have considered stopping trial 
treatment after receiving at least 24 weeks of treatment. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: To determine the safety and tolerability of 200 mg Q3W dose of pembrolizumab in 
subjects with R/M HNSCC who have progressed on platinum and cetuximab therapy. 
Primary objectives: To evaluate antitumor activity of pembrolizumab by ORR using RECIST 1.1 assessed 
by independent central radiology review in all subjects and in PD-L1 strong positive (i.e. TPS ≥50%) 
subjects with R/M HNSCC who have progressed on platinum and cetuximab therapy. 
Secondary objectives: To evaluate antitumor activity of pembrolizumab by ORR in PD-L1 positive 
subjects, and to estimate the duration of response, PFS and OS in all subjects, PD-L1 strong positive, and 
PD-L1 positive subjects.

Sample size  
Assuming that approximately 135 of the 150 enrolled subjects with recurrent and/or metastatic head and 
neck cancer will be evaluable for the primary efficacy analysis in the FAS population, the study has 
approximately 85% power to demonstrate that the ORR is >5% with a type I error rate of 1.25% if the 
true ORR in all subjects is 13%. Success for this hypothesis requires at least 14/135 responses. Assuming 
that the prevalence of PD-L1 strong positive subjects with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck 
cancer is 20%~30%, then among the 150 enrolled subjects approximately 30~45 PD-L1 strong positive 
subjects would be expected. The study has approximately 92% to 99% power to demonstrate that the 
Assessment report

Page 76/151 
 
  
ORR >5% with a type I error rate of 1.25% if the true ORR in PD-L1 strong positive subjects is 30%. 
Success for this hypothesis requires at least 6 responses out of 30~39 PD-L1 strong positive subjects, and 
at least 7 responses out of 40~45 PD-L1 strong positive subjects. 
Statistical methods 
The ORR was evaluated for the primary efficacy hypothesis and estimated separately for all subjects and 
for subjects with strongly positive PD-L1 expression based on TPS ≥50%. A 97.5% CI along with a 
one-sided p-value for testing the null hypothesis based on the binomial distribution was provided for ORR.  
The trial was considered to have met the efficacy endpoint if the one-sided p-value for testing the primary 
hypothesis in all subjects was less than 1.25%, OR if the one-sided p-value for testing the primary 
hypothesis in PD-L1 strongly positive subjects was less than 1.25%. A step-down procedure controlled 
Type I error between the primary PD-L1 strongly positive hypothesis and the secondary PD-L1 positive 
(defined as TPS >0% by IHC) hypothesis. 
Results 
Patient disposition 
A total of 172 subjects were enrolled. 1 subject was not dosed, therefore excluded from efficacy and

Methods 
Study participant  
The trial enrolled male/female subjects of at least 18 years of age, ECOG 0-1 and adequate organ 
functions. For Cohort B and B2, subject must have had a histologically or cytologically-confirmed 
diagnosis of cancer that was recurrent, metastatic, or persistent squamous cell carcinoma of the head or 
neck, both HPV-positive and HPV-negative. Disease was measurable according to RECIST 1.1. There was 
no limit to the number of prior treatment regimens. In Cohort B, tumours were to be PD-L1 positive as 
determined by IHC at a central laboratory from either an archived FFPE tumor sample or a newly obtained 
biopsy, while in Cohort B2 patients were enrolled regardless PD-L1 status. Previously treated CNS 
metastases were allowed provided they were stable.   
Patients with immunosuppression, receiving immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first 
dose, active autoimmune disease or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, HIV, 
HBV, HCV were excluded.  
Treatments  
All patients received pembrolizumab, which was administered at 10 mg/kg Q2W in Cohort B, and at 
200 mg Q3W in Cohort B2.   
Imaging was performed every 8 weeks to assess response to treatment according to RECIST 1.1 based on 
independent central radiology review. If imaging showed PD, tumor assessment was repeated ≥ 4 weeks 
later to confirm PD, with the option of continuing treatment for clinically stable subjects. For the purpose 
of analysis, a PD that was not confirmed due to a missing confirmation assessment was considered a PD.

Sample size  
Cohort B: HPV negative HNC subjects were evaluated separately from HPV positive subjects. With a 
maximum of 22 evaluable PD-L1 positive subjects with HPV negative head and neck cancer, the study has 
approximately 80% power to detect a 25% difference in ORR under the null hypothesis of ORR=10% with 
a type I error rate of 2.5% if the true ORR is 35%. Success for this hypothesis required at least 6/22 
responses. The actual number of subjects enrolled might be larger than 22 to ensure that at least 22 
subjects are evaluable for analysis. With a maximum of 12 evaluable PD-L1 positive subjects with HPV 
positive head and neck cancer, the study had approximately 73% power to detect a 35% difference in 
ORR under the null ORR=20% with a type I error rate of 5% if the true ORR is 55%. Success for this 
hypothesis required at least 6 responses. The actual number of subjects enrolled might be larger than 12 
to ensure that at least 12 subjects are evaluable for analysis.  
Statistical methods 
For the RECIST 1.1 response rate (per independent central radiology review) in each cohort, an exact 
Clopper-Pearson 95% CI and p value were provided for testing the null hypothesis, using exact binomial 
distribution. Subjects who met the criteria for the primary analysis population but without response data 
were counted as non-responders. 
For DOR, Kaplan-Meier curves and median estimates from the KM curves were provided. Subjects who did 
not achieve a response were excluded from the DOR analyses. 
For PFS and OS, Kaplan-Meier curves and median estimates from the KM curves were provided. Subjects 
without efficacy evaluation data or without survival data were censored at Day 1 in the PFS analyses.

Each subject is counted once for Subject Study Medication Disposition based on the latest corresponding disposition 
record. Cohort B: Head and Neck Cancer; Cohort B2: Head and Neck Cancer Expansion 
(Database Cutoff Date: 26APR2016). 
Recruitment 
This trial was conducted at 16 centers (8 in US). Data cutoff date for the HNSCC Cohorts B and B2 
presented here is 26-Apr-2016. 
Baseline data 
Male patients were approximately 80% in both cohorts. Most patients were White; there were 20% of 
Asiatic subjects in Cohort B2 vs only 2% in Cohort B. ECOG was 0 in 30% and 1 in 70% of patients in both 
cohorts. Patients were mainly metastatic (M1); none had brain metastases. All but three patients 
received prior treatment, median number of systemic therapy was 2 (range 0-7). 47% received prior 
adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy. Further baseline data are presented in the table below:

Cohort B: Head and Neck Cancer; Cohort B2: Head and Neck Cancer Expansion 
(Database Cutoff Date: 26APR2016). 
Among platinum-progressed subjects, 139 had tumors with PD-L1 CPS≥1 per CPS scoring method 
(80%). Fifty (29%) had tumors with strongly positive PD-L1 expression per the TPS scoring method (i.e. 
TPS≥50%). Baseline characteristics of patients CPS≥1 were comparable to the overall 
platinum-progressed population. In the TPS ≥50% population, some differences compared to the overall 
population are noted: i.e. lower median age (56.5 years), less patients with ECOG 0 (22%), no therapies 
for metastatic disease (26%), less patients received prior cetuximab (48%), lower median sum of target 
lesions (77).   
Numbers analysed 
The primary efficacy population consisted of the All Subjects as Treated population (ASaT, N = 192) in the 
combined Cohorts B (n = 60) and B2 (n = 132), and included all enrolled subjects who received at least 
one dose of study medication. A subset of the primary efficacy population consisted of subjects who had 
progressed on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy (n = 174, including 53 subjects in Cohort B and 
121 subjects in Cohort B2). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Results reported below are related to subjects in Cohorts B (n=53) and B2 (n=121) combined who 
progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy, regardless of prior cetuximab exposure (n = 174).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH is requesting an extension of indication for Keytruda (pembrolizumab) as monotherapy for the 
treatment of adult patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) HNSCC with disease progression on or after 
platinum-containing chemotherapy, based on the data from the pivotal study KEYNOTE-040 and the two 
supportive studies KEYNOTE-055 and KEYNOTE-012. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
KEYNOTE-040 (pivotal study) 
KN040 is an ongoing, Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, active-controlled, open-label clinical trial to 
examine the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab versus the choice of 3 different standard treatment 
options in subjects with R/M HNSCC whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-containing 
chemotherapy. Subjects were randomized to receive treatment with either pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W, 
or investigator’s choice of methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab. Subjects were stratified by ECOG PS (0 
versus 1), HPV status (positive versus negative) for oropharynx cancer only, and PD-L1 status (strongly 
positive versus not strongly positive, where strongly positive is defined as tumour proportion score [TPS] 
≥50%). 
Eligible patients were histologically or cytologically-confirmed recurrent (not amenable to curative 
treatment with local and/or systemic therapies) or metastatic HNSCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx, 
hypopharynx, and larynx. All subjects had disease progression to prior platinum treatment. At the time of 
SA, it was evaluated that 1st line patients may be considered similar to second-line patients, the 
homogeneity of the trial population being thus preserved. 
The proposed control arm is considered adequate. Although cetuximab is approved as monotherapy in 
second line in R/M HNSCC by FDA but not in EU, its inclusion among the options in the control arm is 
considered appropriate from a clinical perspective.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was OS in the ITT population. Key secondary efficacy endpoints included 
OS in subjects with PD-L1 by CPS ≥1, PFS, ORR and DOR (both based on central radiology review). PFS, 
ORR and DOR were evaluated both in the ITT and CPS ≥1 populations.

PD-L1 scoring method was changed from TPS (tumor proportion score, i.e. PD-L1 expression on tumour 
cells only), which was used as stratification factor, to CPS (combined positive score, i.e. PD-L1 expression 
on tumour cells and immune cells infiltrating the tumour stroma), used for the analyses. CPS is defined as 
the number of PD-L1 staining cells (tumor cells, lymphocytes, macrophages) divided by the total number 
of viable tumor cells, multiplied by 100. The choice of the CPS score with the cut-off 1 was based on a 
retrospective evaluation of ORR in 190 HNSCC patients from KN012, showing that CPS with cut-off 1 was 
able to better discriminate patients with worse and better outcome following pembrolizumab treatment 
compared to TPS, although the number of subjects whose tumor had CPS score < 1 was quite limited 
(35/190). Based on these results, the KN040 clinical protocol was amended, prior to data analysis, to 
include CPS ≥ 1 as the primary PD-L1 scoring method and cut-off. CPS score is also applied to the ongoing 
HNSCC first-line study KN048.  
The final OS analysis in all subjects was planned to be conducted after ~340 deaths overall. Under the 
proportional hazard assumption with 340 events at the final analysis, the study provided 90% power to 
demonstrate superiority in OS of pembrolizumab relative to standard treatment at the alpha = 2.5% 
(one-sided) level with a true HR of 0.7 and median of 6.2 months in the standard treatment group. 
Approximately 466 subjects were therefore to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the pembrolizumab group 
or the standard treatment group. Several changes of the sample size assumptions have been adopted. 
The initial projected number of death events at the final analysis (351 OS events and 466 patients) was 
revised in Amendment 11 onward to account for the delayed separation in the overall survival curves that 
have been observed with immunotherapies and additional follow-up time was incorporated into the trial 
to ensure that the final analysis was conducted at an appropriate time to characterize the potential benefit 
of immunotherapy, as stated by the MAH. Therefore, in the last protocol version, the study was based on 
340 OS events (466 patients). The rationale is acknowledged. However, it is not clear why the final 
analysis was conducted after 388 OS events occurred (495 patients enrolled). It should be noted that an 
increase of the number of events affects the minimal detectable HR that it is slightly shifted toward the 
null hypothesis. In addition, amendment 11 (2.11.2016) has been released after the two planned interim 
analyses were performed (IA1 OS all subjects, 144 OS events, cut-off date 15.4.2016, IA2 216 OS 
events, cut-off date 1.8.2016). Therefore, there is a concern that modifications were not entirely driven 
by data external to the current study. 
Overall, the statistical analyses proposed in the protocol are considered adequate. However, the protocol 
was amended several times and the changes have heavily modified the statistical component of the study 
design (definition of primary endpoint, stratification factors, follow-up duration, unplanned crossover) 
and sample size, and therefore have influenced the conduction of the study, having implications for the 
clinical interpretation of the results. 
KEYNOTE-055 and KEYNOTE-012 (supportive studies) 
KEYNOTE-055 is an ongoing Phase 2, multicenter, nonrandomized, single-cohort trial of pembrolizumab 
in subjects with R/M HNSCC (regardless PD-L1 and HPV status) who had progressed on platinum and 
cetuximab therapy, which have been presented as supportive study.  
KEYNOTE-012 is an open-label, multicohort, multicenter, nonrandomized Phase 1b clinical trial 
evaluating the safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced 
solid tumors, including R/M HNSCC. Subjects with PD-L1-positive (based on a prototype IHC assay ≥1% 
PD-L1 membrane staining of tumor cells or the presence of a stromal banding pattern) HNSCC were 
enrolled in Cohort B and treated with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W. Following a protocol amendment, 
subjects with HNSCC regardless of PD-L1 status were enrolled in Cohort B2 and treated with 
pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W.

In both KN012 and KN055, the primary efficacy endpoint was ORR using RECIST 1.1 criteria by central 
radiology assessment; DOR, PFS and OS were among secondary endpoints. The primary population for 
efficacy analysis was the All Patients as Treated (ASaT) in both studies. Data cut-off date is 22-APR-2016 
(≥6 months after enrollment of the last subject) for KN055, and 26-APR-2016 for KN012.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
KEYNOTE-040 (pivotal study) 
There were 699 patients screened and 495 randomized (247 in the pembrolizumab and 248 in the 
standard treatment arm). It is noted that a higher number of patients in the standard therapy arm did not 
receive treatment (1 vs 14). There were more subjects who stopped treatment due to patients’ consent 
withdrawal or physician decision in the standard arm compared to the control arm (10.3% vs 4.1%), 
which is not unexpected. Since this imbalance might have exerted a negative impact on the performance 
of the SOC arm in the ITT analysis, two sensitivity analyses for OS with different handling of these 
patients to provide further insight in the best versus worst scenario have been requested (analysis 1: 
censoring time at the date of the database lock; analysis 2: put an event instead of a censoring at the 
observed censoring time). Both sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary OS ITT analysis. 
There was approximately the same rate of radiological (60.6% vs 59%) and clinical progression (14.6% 
vs 14.1%) in both arms. Slightly more patients discontinued treatment in the chemotherapy arm due to 
side effect (11% vs 15.8%). 
The majority of subjects were male, White, former smokers, about 70% with ECOG-PS of 1, median age 
60 years. Most subjects had a negative HPV status (~75%). Tumour PDL-1 score was CPS ≥1 in 79.4% 
vs 77% of patients. Baseline characteristics appeared overall balanced, with few minimal differences 
noted between treatment arms. Information regarding baseline disease burden were requested; indeed, 
this might be relevant also with regard to the issue of the excess of early deaths observed with 
pembrolizumab as compared to the control arm (in Checkmate141 study, high tumour burden was 
associated with early deaths in Opdivo treated R/M HNSCC patients compared to docetaxel). Higher 
median tumour size as well as higher variability in baseline tumour size in the control arm compared to 
the pembrolizumab arm is noted. However, further analyses showed that the incorporation of tumour size 
into the model does not substantially change the magnitude of the OS effect.  
The major protocol deviations appeared balanced between arms, therefore it is not considered to have 
had impact on the final study results. 
The primary OS analysis was based on a data cutoff date of 15-MAY-2017 (388 OS events occurred) and 
a database lock date of 04-JUN-2017 (information on 377 OS events were available), which is the only 
p-value provided for statistical inference and adjusted for multiplicity. OS HR was 0.82 (95%CI 
0.67-1.01, p=0.0316). From a statistical point of view, the result was not statistically significant as it 
missed the pre-specified primary statistical hypothesis of a p-value OS boundary of 0.0175 for 377 
deaths.  
A sensitivity analysis was performed at 340 OS events, corresponding to the planned final number of OS 
events, showing an even lower benefit of pembrolizumab over standard treatment (HR 0.86, 95%CI 
0.69-1.06, p=0.081). 
All the efficacy data presented by the MAH are based on a database lock date of 13-OCT-2017 (not 
adjusted for multiplicity), at which time data on all the 388 subjects who had died as of the data cutoff 
date of 15-MAY-2017 were included in the database (388 events). The HR for OS in the overall population 
was 0.80 (95%CI 0.65, 0.98), with a one-sided p-value of 0.01605 in favour of pembrolizumab, 
corresponding to a gain in median OS of 1.5 months (8.4 vs 6.9 months in pembrolizumab vs standard 
Assessment report

Page 93/151 
 
  
arm respectively). OS events were 73.3% vs 83.5% in pembrolizumab vs standard treatment arm 
respectively. 
The first portion of the pembrolizumab KM OS curve lies slightly below/overlaps the standard treatment 
arm up to approximately month 4-5. However, a clear separation in favour of pembrolizumab is seen 
afterwards, and curves appeared to further divide over time, as shown by an increasing difference in OS 
rate between arms (from 2.8% difference in OS rate at 6 months to 10.5% difference at 12 months). The 
same trend was observed in CheckMate-141 study testing nivolumab vs standard treatment (same 
comparator’s drugs as in KN040) in the same R/M HNSCC setting. The MAH has been requested to provide 
analyses to identify patient/disease characteristics that may have contributed to the early crossing of the 
OS curves, and provide further data regarding patients who died within 4-5 months and discuss potential 
factors to be considered in the selection of patients and to evaluate whether appropriate information 
should be included in the SmPC to guide physicians in the choice of treatment. In the pembrolizumab arm, 
there are slightly more patients compared to the control arm with more advanced disease (e.g. Stage 
IVC, M1, liver disease), although baseline median tumor size was slightly higher in the standard 
treatment group. Also, more patients who progressed <3 months from prior platinum treatment or 
systemic therapy are noted in the pembrolizumab arm compared to the control arm, as well as more lines 
of prior therapies. The MAH didn’t discuss association of tumour PD-L1 expression status with a higher 
risk of early death; however, this obviously also plays a role. If excluding subjects with CPS<1, 
differences appear less pronounced. The overlapping of the 95% CIs for both treatment groups in the OS 
Kaplan-Meier curves in the initial time period before the crossover of the curves are acknowledged. 
However, a trend toward an increased risk of death with pembrolizumab compared to standard treatment 
is noted in the first two months, based both on the number of deaths in the two arms and on the 
instantaneous hazard rate. Baseline characteristics of patients who died within 2 months from 
randomization, as well as univariate analyses (data not shown), showed that the most relevant difference 
appears to be related to the PD-L1 expression status, with lower number of TPS≥50% patients who died 
early with pembrolizumab compared to subjects receiving standard treatment. This observation is 
compatible with the OS KM curves of the TPS≥50% population which are not crossing. The possibility to 
draw solid conclusion on other single factors is hampered by the limited number of subjects analysed.  
According to subgroup analysis, no benefit is seen in OS for pembrolizumab compared to docetaxel. 
Female patients did not appear to gain advantage from pembrolizumab treatment with regard to OS, 
acknowledging the limited number of female patients enrolled in KN040 (expected due to the 
epidemiology of the disease). Some imbalances in baseline characteristics in female patients have been 
noted, some of them possibly favouring control arm.   
Crossover was not pre-specified in the protocol, although unplanned crossover occurred. In the ITT 
population, 42 subjects received an immunotherapy after trial treatment, 31 in the control arm (12.5%), 
and 11 patients in the pembrolizumab arm. The rate of crossover does not appear high and the sensitivity 
analyses performed to analyze the unplanned crossover are not improving OS results to a large extent. It 
should also be noted that such analyses can break the randomization balance.  
Overall, about 62% of subjects were enrolled in EU, where pembrolizumab showed higher OS advantage 
for pembrolizumab over standard treatment compared to the ITT population (OS HR=0.65). On the 
contrary, standard treatment shower higher OS advantage compared to pembrolizumab in North America 
(HR=1.29). This difference seems to be related to a highly better OS performance of the standard 
treatment in NA compared to EU (median OS 11.8 vs 6.4 months in NA vs EU, respectively), while the 
pembrolizumab arm has similar OS outcome in both regions. However a negative OS HR would not be 
expected even with a 100% rate of crossover. The MAH further discussed the unfavourable treatment 
effect of pembrolizumab in the NA subpopulation. Baseline characteristics were largely comparable 
between ITT and NA apart from differences in the HPV status (overall more HPV positive subjects in NA 
Assessment report  
EMA/543713/2018 
Page 94/151 
 
  
compared to ITT population), although this imbalance is considered not to explain the better efficacy 
results in the control arm of the NA subpopulation. The post-progression therapies are considered not to 
fully explain the magnitude of regional differences in efficacy results. Patients were not stratified by 
region, therefore the statistical analyses are not based on randomized comparison. Baseline 
characteristics of the EU population did not show any meaningful differences compared to the ITT 
population. The OS results in the NA population appeared therefore to remain lastly unexplained. 
No benefit in PFS was evident for pembrolizumab compared to the standard treatment (HR=0.96, 95%CI 
0.79, 1.16, p=0.325). Median PFS was similar in both arms (2.1 vs 2.3 months), although curves seems 
to slightly diverge since month 5, with a 4% absolute difference in PFS rate at month 9 and 12 in favor of 
pembrolizumab. A supportive analysis using RMST restricted mean survival time showed that the PFS 
benefit of pembrolizumab over standard treatment seems to increase over time.  
ORR by BICR was slightly better with pembrolizumab (14.6%, 95% CI: 10.4, 19.6) compared to standard 
therapy (10.1%, 95% CI: 6.6, 14.5), although a higher rate of progressive disease occurred in the 
pembrolizumab arm (43.7% vs 39.1%). Patients who achieved CR were 4 (1.6%) with pembrolizumab vs 
1 (0.4%) with chemotherapy (docetaxel). Docetaxel lead to higher ORR among standard treatment drugs 
(11.8%). Median DOR was notably longer with pembrolizumab (18.4 vs 5 months) as well as more 
patients had extended (i.e. ≥6 months) response duration (71.5% vs 47.1%). Median time to response 
was almost doubled for pembrolizumab compared to standard treatment (4.5 vs 2.2 months), both in the 
overall population and in all subgroups according to PD-L1 expression, although it is acknowledged that 
this is based on a limited number of patients.       
In relation to the exploratory endpoint Health-related Quality of Life, changes from baseline in the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-H&N35 were primarily evaluated at Week 9 and at Week 15, showing over 15 
weeks of follow-up that subjects receiving pembrolizumab had stable global health status/QOL, while 
those treated with standard treatment had a decline of global health status/QOL. The lowest compliance 
to ePRO questionnaires is reported at Week 15, when it was approximately 75% in both arms. HRQoL 
were exploratory endpoints with no pre-specified hypothesis. The open-label design further hampers the 
interpretation of data. 
With regard to PD-L1 expression, efficacy results by PD-L1-expression status demonstrated a consistent 
association between PD-L1 expression and treatment effect of pembrolizumab. PD-L1 positive (CPS≥1) 
patients appeared to benefit more from pembrolizumab treatment compared with the ITT population, 
with the highest advantage for TPS ≥50% tumors (strongly positive). On the other hand, PD-L1 
expression status does not appear to influence the activity of the standard treatments in R/M HNSCC in 
KN040 study.   
In the CPS<1 population, no advantage of pembrolizumab monotherapy over standard treatment is seen 
in all efficacy endpoints, in addition to a detrimental effect in ORR [OS CPS<1: HR=1.28 (95%CI 0.80, 
2.07), p=0.848; OS in EU CPS<1: HR=0.82 (95%CI 0.46, 1.45); PFS CPS<1: HR=1.33 (95%CI 0.86, 
2.07), p=0.9; ORR CPS<1: 4.0% (0.5,13.7) vs 11.1% (4.2,22.6)]. A possible advantage for 
pembrolizumab in duration of response cannot be defined in CPS<1 population, as no confirmed 
responses were reported in this subgroup. Acknowledging the intrinsic limitation of subgroup analyses, 
based on the available data from KN040, there is no evidence of benefit to support an indication of 
pembrolizumab in R/M HNSCC in subjects whose tumor has PD-L1 CPS score <1.  
A relevant advantage of pembrolizumab compared to standard treatment is seen in strongly positive 
PD-L1 expressing tumours (i.e. TPS≥50%) comprising about 25% of the overall population (and 
approximately 33% of CPS≥1 subjects). In the TPS≥50% population, the benefit of pembrolizumab vs 
standard treatment is clear and observed in all efficacy endpoints. OS curves do not overlap, clearly 
separating from the beginning, with OS HR=0.53 (95%CI 0.35-0.81).

To provide a more complete picture on the impact of different PD-L1 expression levels on the treatment 
effect of pembrolizumab, the MAH was requested to provide efficacy analysis on main endpoints (OS, PFS 
and ORR) for subjects with CPS≥1 and TPS<50% and for subjects with TPS <1 (representing 40% of 
study population) (it is acknowledged that these cut-offs have not been validated). For the post-hoc 
exploratory CPS ≥1 and TPS <50% population, an OS HR of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.12) was shown, with 
comparable PFS and ORR results between the two treatment arms. The benefit in the group with CPS≥1 
and TPS<50% has not been convincingly demonstrated  
Evaluation of PD-L1 expression in tumour- and immune cells (CPS) has not been implemented as 
stratification factor at randomization (but TPS <50% vs. ≥50%), since the clinical relevance of CPS has 
been only learned during the conduct of the study based on phase II data.  
Based on KN012, the CPS cut-off of 10 showed lower sensitivity (75%) but higher specificity (45.4%) 
compared to cut-off 1 (sensitivity 95.8%, specificity 22.2%), although this cut-off has not been further 
explored. In order to evaluate whether a different PD-L1 cut-off could better discriminate patients who 
gain benefit from pembrolizumab and can be more useful in clinical practice, the MAH presented and 
discussed baseline characteristics and all efficacy results (e.g. OS, PFS, ORR, DoR etc) of KN040 
according to CPS cut-off of 10 (both in CPS ≥ 10 and CPS < 10 populations), as well as in the KN012 
population which have been used to define the ROC curve and the new PD-L1 CPS score. In KN040, in 
both CPS<10 and CPS≥10 subgroups, no meaningful imbalances in baseline characteristics between 
treatment arms are observed. In addition, overall baseline characteristics appear comparable with the 
ones of the ITT population. Comparable efficacy results are shown in CPS≥1 and CPS≥10 populations. 
Based on the provided data, it could be speculated that in the population with a CPS score between 1 and 
10 (CPS≥1 and <10) there is a trend toward a non detrimental effect compared to the standard treatment 
(OS HR<1).  
Greater OS advantage of pembrolizumab over standard treatment was seen in the HPV negative 
compared to HPV positive subjects (data not shown). 
KEYNOTE-055 and KEYNOTE-012 (supportive studies) 
Patients in the supportive studies KN012 and KN055 were more heavily pretreated compared to the 
pivotal trial: indeed, patients who had 2 or more prior lines therapy for metastatic disease were and 
71.1% in Cohort B and 63.2% in Cohort B2 of KN012, and 75.5% in KN055, compared to 28.1% in 
KN040. Composition according to age and ECOG were similar in all three studies. As in KN040, about 80% 
of patients in both KN055 and KN012 had PD-L1 CPS ≥1 score.   
In KN055 study, 171 patients were included in the ASaT population. ORR based on RECIST 1.1 per central 
radiology assessment (confirmed responses only) was 16.4% (95%CI 11.2, 22.8), with only 1 CR, with a 
trend toward higher response rate with higher PD-L1 expression. Median duration of response was 8.3 
months (range 1.6+ - 11.6+), with 72% of subjects with Response ≥ 6 months similar to KN040. PFS and 
OS results are overall comparable to the pembrolizumab arm of KN040.  
In the KN012 study, a subset of the primary efficacy population consisted of subjects who had progressed 
on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy (n = 174, including 53 subjects in Cohort B and 121 
subjects in Cohort B2) of which results have been presented. Overall, ORR was 16.7% (95%CI 11.5, 
23.1). Median time to response was Not Reached (range 2.4+ - 29.5+), with number of subjects with 
response ≥ 6 Months 85% and ≥ 12 Months 71%.  
It is considered that the supportive studies KN055 and KN012 are providing further evidence to support 
the durability of response of pembrolizumab in R/M HNSCC after prior treatment, although the rate of 
subjects who achieve response is not outstanding. In addition, a trend toward higher ORR in positive 
PD-L1 subjects is also confirmed.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The protocol was amended several times and the changes have heavily modified the statistical 
component of the study design (definition of primary endpoint, stratification factors, follow-up duration, 
unplanned crossover) and sample size, and therefore have influenced the conduction of the study, having 
implications for the clinical interpretation of the results. In view of these methodologically issues 
(especially considering the formal lack of statistical significance in a single pivotal trial) it could be a 
possible option to reject the trial based on regulatory and statistical principles. However, in a more 
general view - taking the overall data and knowledge into account- this would be not considered the most 
appropriate way to address the provided evidence regarding the treatment effect of pembrolizumab in 2L 
HNSCC and there is a biological plausibility of the observed relation between PD-L1 expression and 
efficacy, therefore to look into subgroups based on PD-L1 expression.  
The use of the CPS≥1 PD-L1 cut-off does not convincingly identify a population that will benefit from 
pembrolizumab. In the TPS≥50% population, the benefit of pembrolizumab vs standard treatment is 
demonstrated and observed in all efficacy endpoints. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
The overall safety profile of pembrolizumab, evaluated across clinical studies in patients with different 
solid tumours, is mainly associated with immune-related adverse reactions, and characterised by general 
(fatigue, decreased appetite), gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhoea, constipation), respiratory (cough, 
dyspnoea), and skin (pruritus and rash) disorders.  
The present submission focuses on the use of pembrolizumab for R/M HNSCC in patients with disease 
progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy by evaluating the KN040 trial results and by 
comparing KN040 pembrolizumab-treated subjects with a Reference Safety Dataset. Safety analyses 
included two integrated datasets either in all subjects with R/M HNSCC (Pooled HNSCC Dataset) and in all 
pembrolizumab trials (Cumulative Running Safety Dataset), in order to show consistency of safety data 
within R/M HNSCC and across multiple indications, respectively.  
Analyses in all four datasets were conducted on the Subject as Treated (AsaT) population, including all 
randomized patients who received at least one dose of treatment.  
Introduction 
For the purpose of safety evaluation of pembrolizumab in subjects with disease progression on or after 
platinum-containing chemotherapy for R/M HNSCC, the pembrolizumab-treated group receiving 200 mg 
administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks (Q3W) within the active 
controlled Phase 3 KN040 trial (N=246) was compared to: 
1.  The group treated with standard treatment for R/M HNSCC according to investigator’s decision in the 
KN040  trial  (pooled  or  single  type  of  treatment  with  cetuximab  [n=71],  methotrexate  [n=64], 
docetaxel [n=99]) (N=234); 
2.  3 other pembrolizumab-treated patient populations:  
a.  Pooled  HNSCC  Dataset:  all  subjects  with  pretreated  R/M  HNSCC  from  KN040,  KN012 
(Cohorts B and B2) and KN055 (N=609) allowing for evaluation of pembrolizumab safety in 
R/M HNSCC indication.

Subject characteristics 
In KN040, approximately 83% were male gender, 33% aged =>65 years, and 71% with ECOG 
performance status of 1 (only ECOG 0-1 were allowed in the trial). Baseline demographic and disease 
characteristics and tumor assessments were generally well balanced between pembrolizumab and 
standard treatment groups. There was a higher proportion of patients with metastases in the 
pembrolizumab group (74.4%) than in the standard treatment group (66.2%).  
Compared to the Reference Safety and Cumulative Running Safety Datasets, participants in the KN040 
trial as well as in the Pooled HNSCC Dataset were more often male gender, aged <65 years, and with an 
ECOG =>1. Further, KN040 participants for two-thirds (78%) were enrolled outside the US, while the 
other Datasets included more often patients from the US (Pooled HNSCC Dataset) or with equal 
distribution among geographical areas (Reference Safety and Cumulative Running Safety Datasets).

Table 82: Drug-Related Adverse Events in KN040 (ASaT population) - Incidence ≥5% in One 
or More Treatment Groups) by Decreasing Incidence in the MK-3475 group 
Except for hypothyroidism, incidences of all other drug-related AEs (≥5%) were higher in the standard 
treatment group. Drug-related AEs, occurred in a similar percentage with all the three drugs of the KN040 
standard treatment arm: cetuximab 88.7%, methotrexate 78.1%, docetaxel 83.3%.  
Grade 1-2 drug-related AEs were found in 74% of subjects treated with pembrolizumab and in 80% of 
those receiving standard treatment. 
Drug-related AEs in KN040 and in the other Safety Datasets analysed are summarised in the table below:  
Table 83: Drug-Related Adverse Events By Decreasing Frequency of Preferred Term 
(Incidence ≥ 5% in One or More Treatment Groups) 
The incidence of pembrolizumab-related Pneumonia was 0.4% in KN040, 0.2% in the Pooled HNSCC 
Database, 0.6% in the Reference Safety Dataset, and 0.5% in the Cumulative Running Safety Dataset.  
Approximately half of subjects had a drug-related AE that was of maximum toxicity Grade 1 or 2 (49.6% 
in KN040 compared to 59.9% in the Reference Safety Dataset, respectively).

Grade 3-5 drug-related AEs  
Table 84: Drug-Related Grade 3-5 Adverse Events by Decreasing Incidence in KN040 (ASaT 
Population) 
Grade 3-5 drug related AEs occurred in a similar percentage of patients treated with methotrexate 
(42.2%) and docetaxel (46.5%), while the proportion was lower in subjects receiving cetuximab 
(16.9%).  
In KN040, 64% of Grade 3-5 AEs were observed in one single patient. Events registered in 2 or more 
participants treated with pembrolizumab were: Diarrhoea, Fatigue, Dyspnoea, Pneumonitis. In the 
standard treatment arm Neutrophil count decreased (8.5%), Stomatitis (4.7%), and Febrile neutropenia 
(4.3%) were the most common Grade 3-5 AEs.

Population) 
Proportion  of  subjects  with  pembrolizumab-related  Grade 3-5  AEs  in  the  KN040  population  was 
consistent  across  all  Datasets  and  among  Grade  3-5  drug-related  AEs,  specific  PTs  were  reported  in 
≤1.6% of all populations (see table below).

Frequency  of  Grade  3-5  pembrolizumab-related  Pneumonia  was  similar  among  all  4  datasets  (0.4%, 
0.2%, 0.3% and 0.2% in KN040, Pooled HNSCC Dataset, Reference Safety Dataset, Cumulative Running 
Safety Dataset, respectively). 
Other Significant Events (Adverse Events of Special interest, AEOSIs) 
Immune-mediated  events  and  infusion-related  reactions  associated  with  pembrolizumab  were 
considered AEOSIs. A pre-specified and continually up-dated list of PTs was used for data collection and 
analyses (see table below):  
Table 85 Immune mediated events and infusion-related reactions associated with 
Pembrolizumab 
Assessment report  
EMA/543713/2018 
Page 110/151 
 
  
 
 
Among AEOSIs, frequencies of all-causality AEs (21.6 vs 12.0%), drug-related AEs (21.5 vs 5.1%) and 
SAEs (3.7 vs 0.4%) were noticeably higher in subjects treated with pembrolizumab than in those 
receiving standard treatment. Also, treatment discontinuation due to AEOSI was more frequently 
registered in the pembrolizumab arm. AEOSI Grade 3-5 AEs rates were similar among the two treatment 
arms (See the next table). 
AEs were reported for the following AEOSI categories in the pembrolizumab group:  
•  Hypothyroidism (15.0%), pneumonitis (4.1%), skin including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (2.8) , 
hyperthyroidism (2.0%), colitis (0.8%), hepatitis (0.8%), Guillain-Barre syndrome (0.8%), and 
infusion reactions (3.3%),  
AEs were reported for the following AEOSI categories in the standard treatment group:  
•  Hypothyroidism  (3.8%),  skin  (3.8%),  pneumonitis  (1.3%),  colitis  (0.4%),  hyperthyroidism 
(0.4%), and infusion reactions (3.0%).

Table 86: AEOSIs in KN040 (ASaT population) 
The most frequently reported (≥2% of subjects) AEOSI for the pembrolizumab arm of the KN040 
Population were Hypothyroidism, Pneumonitis, Infusion Reactions, Severe Skin Reactions, and 
Hyperthyroidism. Most AEOSIs were mild to moderate in severity (Grade 1 or 2). One subject (0.4%) 
experienced a Grade 4 AEOSI of Hepatitis (autoimmune hepatitis) which resolved. Only one AEOSI fatal 
event was registered (Grade 5 Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and recorded as being related to 
pembrolizumab. No new AEOSIs were recorded in the KN040 study population. 
Table 87: Subjects With Adverse Events by Maximum Toxicity Grade – AEOSI Overall (ASaT 
Population) 
Concerning outcome, among the 63 subjects in the KN040 Population who experienced 1 or more 
AEOSIs, these were recorded as fatal in 1 subject (1.6%), resolved in 20 subjects (31.7%), resolved with 
sequelae in 1 subject (1.6%), resolving in 5 subjects (7.9%), not resolved in 34 subjects (54.0%), and of 
unknown outcome in 2 subjects (3.2%). A higher proportion of AEOSIs of the pembrolizumab group 
remained unresolved at the time of data cut-off when compared to the standard treatment arm (54% vs 
39.3%, respectively). With regard to specific AEOSIs, the proportion of not resolved events was 67.6% of 
Hypothyroidism (N=25/37), 40% of Pneumonitis (N=4/10), 42.9% of Severe skin reaction (N=3/7), 50% 
of Guillain-Barre syndrome (N=1/2), and 20% of Hyperthyroidism (N=1/5).  
Hypothyroidism and radiation status 
Hypothyroidism is one of the long-term toxicities of radiation therapy in HNSCC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/543713/2018 
Page 112/151 
 
  
 
 
The great majority of subjects had received prior radiation in both treatment arms in the KN040 ASaT 
population. In the KN040 trial, Hypothyroidism was more frequently recorded in pembrolizumab-treated 
subjects (N=37/246; 15%) than in the group receiving standard treatment (N=9/234; 3.8%). Toxicity 
severity of hypothyroidism was classified as Grade 1 or 2 in all KN040 pembrolizumab-treated cases, 
except for one. A previous radiation therapy had been administered to almost all pembrolizumab-treated 
subjects developing the event (94.9%).  
Table 88: Radiation Status Among Subjects with and without hypothyroidism 
Only 1/37 (2.7%) subjects with hypothyroidism received systemic corticosteroids started at low dose. In 
67.6% of hypothyroidism cases, the event remained unresolved at the cut-off date, needing chronic 
hormone replacement treatment.  
A similar frequency of hypothyroidism was reported in both KN040 (15.0%) and in the Pooled HNSCC 
Dataset (15.1%). However, Hypothyroidism rate was higher with pembrolizumab in HNSCC patients 
compared to that in subjects of the other datasets, where it was 8.5% and 9.3% in the Reference Safety 
Dataset and in the Cumulative Running Safety Dataset, respectively. Hypothyroidism tended to occur 
earlier in HNSCC treated patients: indeed, median time to onset of first hypothyroidism event was 64 
days in both KN040 and HNSCC Pooled Safety Dataset, versus 106 and 103 days in the Reference Safety 
Dataset and in the Cumulative Running Safety Dataset, respectively.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
In the KN040 trial, the proportion of subjects with one or more SAEs in the pembrolizumab and the 
standard treatment group were 44.7% and 39.3%, respectively. SAEs for Pembrolizumab vs Standard 
Treatment in the KN040 trial are presented in the table below: 
Table 93: Serious Adverse Events Up to 90 Days After Last Dose by Decreasing Incidence in 
the MK-3475 group (Incidence >1% in the MK-3475 Treatment Group) 
The most frequently reported SAEs (>2.0 %) were  
• 
pneumonia, tumor haemorrhage, hypercalcaemia, diarrhoea, pneumonia aspiration, and 
pneumonitis in subjects treated with pembrolizumab,  
Assessment report  
EMA/543713/2018

• 
pneumonia and febrile neutropenia (3.8%) in subjects treated with standard treatment. 
Cumulative frequency of Pneumonia, Pneumonia aspiration, and Pneumonitis accounted for 12.9% in the 
pembrolizumab arm and 9.4% in the standard treatment group.  
In comparison with the other datasets, frequency of SAEs in the KN040 pembrolizumab-treated group 
(44.7%) was to some extent higher than in that found in the Reference Safety Dataset (37.2%) and the 
Cumulate Running Safety Dataset (38.4%), but consistent with that of the Pooled HNSCC Dataset 
(46.1%).

in Pembrolizumab KN040 Treatment Group) By Decreasing Frequency of Preferred Term 
(Subjects in ASaT Population Treated with MK-3475) 
Drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) 
In the KN040 trial, drug-related SAEs were less often registered in the pembrolizumab group than in the 
overall standard treatment arm (8.9% vs 15.4%, respectively). More in detail, drug-related SAEs in 
pembrolizumab-treated patients were more frequent compared to patients receiving cetuximab (5.6%), 
and less common than in subjects receiving both methotrexate (17.2%) or docetaxel (21.2%).  
Pembrolizumab-related SAEs occurring in two or more subjects were: Pneumonitis (1.6%), Diarrhoea 
(1.6%), and Colitis (0.8%); all other events were reported in a single subject.  
The most frequently reported drug-related SAEs among subjects treated with standard treatment were 
Febrile neutropenia (3.4%), Pneumonia, Neutrophil count decreased, and Stomatitis (each 1.3%), 
Diarrhoea, Sepsis, and Dehydration (each 0.9%); all other events occurred in a single subject.  
Frequency of drug-related SAEs was consistent between KN040 (8.9%) and the other Datasets (Pooled 
HNSCC Dataset 9.9%; Running Safety Dataset 10.0%; Cumulative Running Dataset 10.1%). 
Drug-related SAEs of Pneumonitis and Pneumonia occurred at the same frequency in KN040 and in all the 
other Datasets (cumulative proportions were: 2.0% in KN040, 1.7% in the Pooled HNSCC Dataset, 1.9% 
in the Reference Safety Dataset, and 1.7% in the Cumulative Running Dataset).  
Deaths  
Analysis of deaths from AEs did not include events attributed to progression of malignant neoplasm or of 
disease that were not considered related to trial treatment.

Deaths for Pembrolizumab vs Standard Treatment in the KEYNOTE-040 (KN040) trial 
Table 95: Summary of death reasons 
Four subjects (1.6%) of the pembrolizumab arm were considered by the Investigator to have developed 
a drug-related fatal AE: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Death due to unknown cause, Malignant neoplasm 
progression, Large intestine perforation.  
In the standard treatment group, the following fatal events were registered: Pneumonia in 5 subjects 
(2.1%), Death due to not specified cause in 4 subjects (1.7%), Tumor hemorrhage and Lung infection 
each recorded in 2 subjects (0.9%). Other events leading to death in single subjects were: Myocardial 
infarction, Mouth hemorrhage, Alcoholic cirrhosis, Respiratory tract infection, Septic shock, Euthanasia, 
Malignant neoplasm progression, Asphyxia, Pneumonia aspiration, Dyspnea, Pulmonary embolism, 
Respiratory tract hemorrhage. 
Two of these deaths were considered related to standard treatment by the Investigator (0.8%): 
Pneumonia and Malignant neoplasm progression. 
Two deaths due to tumour haemorrhage both reported in the pembrolizumab KN040 treatment arm.  
Deaths from the comparison of KN040 with the Pooled HNSCC Dataset, the Reference Safety Dataset, and 
the Cumulative Running Safety Dataset  
The rate of AEs leading to death in the pembrolizumab-treated group of KN040 (8.1%) was higher than 
in the Reference Safety Dataset (3.9%) and the Cumulative Running Dataset (4.8%), but comparable to 
that of the Pooled HNSCC Dataset (8.9%) and similar to the KN040 standard treatment arm (10.7%). 
Also, proportions of death due to pneumonia, death (cause not specified), tumour haemorrhage and 
respiratory failure were higher in subjects in the HNSCC population, both in study KN040 and pooled 
across studies in HNSCC, in comparison to the Reference Safety Dataset. The rate of Pneumonia, the 
most frequently reported AEs leading to death in KN040 pembrolizumab treatment group (2.4%), was 
higher compared to all the other datasets (1.3% in the Pooled Safety HNSCC Dataset, 0.4% in the 
Reference Safety Database).  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Abnormalities in haematology tests performed during treatment or within 30 days of last dose of study 
drug were primarily Grade 1-2 in the pembrolizumab and standard treatment groups.

• 
• 
In the pembrolizumab group, the only Grade 3-4 hematologic abnormalities reported in ≥5% of 
treated subjects with both baseline and post-baseline measurements were decreased 
haemoglobin (10.5 % Grade 3 only) and decreased lymphocytes (15.3 % Grade 3; 2.3 % Grade 
4). 
In the standard treatment, the only Grade 3-4 hematologic abnormalities reported in ≥5% of 
subjects were decreased haemoglobin (10.3% Grade 3 only), decreased leukocytes (6.7% Grade 
3; 5.3% Grade 4), decreased lymphocytes (26.1% Grade 3; 6.6% Grade 4), and decreased 
neutrophil count (6.6% Grade 3; 10.8% Grade 4). 
The  most  frequent  (>5%)  ≥2-grade  shifts  from  baseline  to  a  Grade  3  or  4  hematologic  abnormality 
included  
• 
• 
lymphopenia and anemia among pembrolizumab-treated subjects, and  
Lymphopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, and anemia in the standard treatment group. 
Electrolytes  
Abnormalities in electrolyte tests performed during treatment or within 30 days of last dose of study drug 
were mainly Grade 1-2 in the pembrolizumab and standard treatment group. 
• 
In the pembrolizumab group, the only Grade 3-4 electrolyte abnormalities reported in ≥5% of 
treated subjects with both baseline and post-baseline measurements were hypercalcaemia 
(3.2% Grade 3; 4.1% Grade 4), hyponatremia (8.1% Grade 3; 3.2% Grade 4) and 
hypophosphatemia (9.9% Grade 3 only) 
• 
In the standard treatment group the only Grade 3-4 electrolyte abnormalities reported in ≥5% of 
treated subjects with both baseline and post-baseline measurements were hyponatremia (11.5% 
Grade 3; 1.9% Grade 4) and hypophosphatemia (8.2% Grade 3 only) 
The  most  frequent  (>5%)  ≥2-grade  shifts  from  baseline  to  a  Grade  3  or  4  electrolyte  abnormality 
included  
• 
• 
hyponatremia and hypophosphatemia among pembrolizumab-treated subjects, and  
hyponatremia and hypophosphatemia in the standard treatment group.  
Hypercalcaemia 
Proportions of subjects with laboratory abnormalities of increased calcium (hypercalcaemia) were similar 
in the KN040 population (24.2%) and in the total HNSCC population (21.1 %), but lower in the Reference 
Safety Dataset (8.0%).  
For comparison, distribution by maximum toxicity Grade is shown for the AEs of hypercalcaemia and 
hypercalcaemia of malignancy. 
Proportions of the AE hypercalcaemia were higher in the in the KN040 population (7.7%) and in the total 
HNSCC population (9.0%), but lower in the Reference Safety Dataset (2.0%). Numbers and proportions 
of the drug-related AE hypercalcaemia were low in the KN040 population (n=1 [0.4%]) and in the total 
HNSCC population (n=3 [0.5]™) and in the Reference Safety Dataset (n=6 [0.2%]).

Liver function tests 
In both treatment groups, liver function test (LFT) abnormalities during treatment or within 30 days of 
last dose of study drug were primarily Grade 1 to 2 in severity.  
•  Grade 3-4 liver function test abnormalities were recorded in less than 5% of treated subjects with 
both baseline and post-baseline measurements;  
•  ≥2-grade shifts from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 liver function test abnormality were recorded in 
less than 5 % in both treatment groups. 
Data were additionally analysed according to predetermined criteria for detection of drug-induced liver 
injury. 
The most frequent liver function finding observed in both treatment groups was ALT and AST elevations; 
a higher proportion of liver laboratory abnormalities was reported in the standard treatment group.

Safety in special populations 
Safety was evaluated in subgroups defined by intrinsic and extrinsic factors (age, gender, ECOG 
performance status, and region). Some differences were found with regards to gender and performance 
status. 
Safety profile by Age  
The proportion of drug-related AEs was higher in the cohort ≥65 years (77.8%) in the pembrolizumab 
arm as compared to the cohort <65 years (55.8%), but similar to the respective cohort in the standard 
treatment arm (77.0%).  
Only few patients ≥75 years were treated in the study, 19 in the pembrolizumab group and 10 in the 
standard treatment group. Of these, 1 subject in the pembrolizumab arm was ≥85 years, and none in the 
standard treatment arm. 
Proportion of subjects ≥65 years was lower in the KN040 population (32.9%) than in Reference Safety 
Dataset (43.3%). No data on the safety profile was provided for the subgroups of subjects ≥75 to < 85 
years and ≥85 years.

Safety profile by Performance Status 
As expected, in the KN040 trial patients with performance status of 1 had worse safety profile than those 
with ECOG of 0 in both treatment groups (ECOG >1 was a trial exclusion criterion). Details are presented 
in the table below:

Table 103: Adverse event summary by ECOG status category (0, 1) (Subjects in ASaT 
population treated with MK-3475) 
Safety profile by Region 
The overall incidence of AEs reported in the US was similar to ex-US in both treatment groups. No notable 
differences were found in the pembrolizumab-treated arm due to region. In the standard treatment 
group, a higher proportion of subjects in the ex-US region experienced Grade 3 to 5 AEs (including 
drug-related), SAEs, dose modifications, and deaths (≥5% difference).  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
This issue is not applicable because no specific studies have been performed on food or drug-drug 
interactions with pembrolizumab. However, as systemic corticosteroids may be used in combination with 
pembrolizumab to ameliorate potential side effects, the potential for a PK DDI with pembrolizumab as a 
victim was assessed as part of the population PK analysis. No relationship was observed between 
prolonged use of systemic corticosteroids and pembrolizumab exposure. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs leading to treatment discontinuation  
Table 104: Subjects with adverse events resulting in treatment discontinuation by decreasing 
incidence by treatment (incidence > 0% in one or more treatment groups) (ASaT population) 
The proportion of drug-related AEs leading to treatment discontinuation in the KN040 trial was 
comparable among the two treatment arms (6.1% vs 5.1%, in the pembrolizumab and the standard 
Assessment report

treatment arm, respectively). Stevens-Johnson syndrome was the only drug-related AE leading to 
treatment discontinuation in >1 subject (2 subjects [0.8%]) in the pembrolizumab arm. 
The proportion of subjects with AEs (regardless causality) leading to treatment discontinuation in KN040 
and the other Datasets was comparable and ranged from 10.9% to 13.8%.  
Rate of drug-related AEs leading to treatment discontinuation in the KN040 trial (6.1%) was similar to 
that observed in the Reference Safety Dataset (5.2%). In both, the Pooled HNSCC Dataset and the 
Reference Safety Dataset, the most common drug-related AE leading to treatment discontinuation was 
Pneumonitis (5 subjects [0.8%] and 34 subjects [1.2%], respectively, vs 1 subject [0.4%] in KN040).  
AEs leading to treatment Interruption 
AEs leading to treatment discontinuation for Pembrolizumab Versus Standard Treatment in KEYNOTE-040 
(KN040) 
In the KN040 trial, the rate of dose interruption was similar between the two arms (26.4% vs 29.9% in 
pembrolizumab and standard treatment group, respectively). The most frequently recorded AEs 
(regardless causality) resulting in treatment interruption in ≥ 2% of subjects were Anaemia and 
Pneumonia in both treatment arms. In addition, Stomatitis and Neutrophils count decreased also resulted 
in treatment interruption of the standard treatment in ≥2% of patients. Drug-related AEs leading to 
treatment interruption were instead less common with pembrolizumab (9.8% vs 20.1% in 
pembrolizumab arm vs standard treatment arm, respectively), most common being Anaemia and 
Pneumonitis with pembrolizumab, vs Stomatitis and haematological toxicity with standard treatment.  
AEs leading to treatment interruption from the comparison of KN040 with the Pooled HNSCC Dataset, the 
Reference Safety Dataset, and the Cumulative Running Safety Dataset    
When comparing the KN040 trial population to that of the other datasets, rate of AEs (regardless 
causality) leading to treatment interruption was comparable (26.4% and 22.2%, respectively in the 
KN040 trial and the Reference Safety Dataset).  
Frequency of drug-related AEs leading to treatment interruption was similar among the 
pembrolizumab-treated KN040 population (9.8%) and the Reference Safety Dataset (12.5%). The 
majority of drug-related AEs leading to treatment interruption in the pembrolizumab-treated KN040 
population were reported in a single subject. Of those events reported in >1 subject, Anaemia, 
Pneumonitis, Rash, and Infusion-related reaction were more frequent in the KN040 population than in the 
Reference Safety Dataset.  
Post marketing experience 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab was summarized in the Periodic Safety Update Report covering the 
period 04-Mar-2017 through 03-Sep-2017 (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010403/201709). 
As a result of the review of the PSUR, the SmPC section 4.8 was updated to add pericarditis and 
pericardial effusion as new adverse drug reactions (ADR) with a frequency uncommon and to add a 
footnote to the existing ADR  ‘myasthenic syndrome’ to indicate that the event ‘myasthenia gravis’ is 
included. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The evaluation of pembrolizumab safety profile in subjects with disease progression on or after 
platinum-containing chemotherapy for R/M HNSCC is based on the pivotal KN040 trial, comparing 
pembrolizumab (N=246) to the investigator’s choice of standard treatments (N=234). A Reference Safety 
Assessment report  
EMA/543713/2018 
Page 124/151 
 
  
Dataset (including 2799 subjects with melanoma and NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy 
from clinical trials KN001, KN002, KN006 and KN010) was provided to allow for comparison of the KN040 
safety profile with pembrolizumab used for other indications. The Pooled HNSCC Dataset, comprising 
participants in three pembrolizumab R/M HNSCC trials (KN040, KN12 and KN055, N=609), and the 
Cumulative Running Dataset, including data from all pembrolizumab trials submitted to regulatory 
authority up to 4 weeks prior to the data cut-off for KN040 (15 MAY 2017) (N=4831), were also included 
for evaluation of an integrated safety analysis in the HNSCC setting and across multiple indications. For a 
more appropriate safety evaluation, the MAH has been asked to provide an Integrated Summary of Safety 
for all indications authorized in the EU (advanced melanoma, NSCLC, urothelial carcinoma and Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma altogether comprising 3,830 subjects), along with further comparative tables. Review of the 
data provided did not reveal relevant changes to the reference safety dataset of 2,799 subjects submitted 
with the initial application. There were no new safety signals. The primary safety analysis population 
presented in this application is the ASaT population, which includes all enrolled subjects who were 
randomized and received at least 1 dose of pembrolizumab in KN040 (N=246). Data cut-off date was 
15-MAY-2017. 
In the KN040 trial, drug exposure was slightly longer for pembrolizumab-treated subjects (median study 
days 85) than for those receiving standard HNSCC treatment (cetuximab 71; methotrexate 43; docetaxel 
53). Further, drug exposure was lower in HNSCC subjects of the KN040 and the Pooled HNSCC Dataset in 
respect to the Reference Safety and the Cumulative Running Safety Datasets. Main patient characteristics 
were similar in KN040 and in the Pooled HNSCC Dataset. Compared to the Reference Safety or the 
Cumulative Running Safety Datasets, KN040 participants were more often male gender, aged <65 years, 
enrolled outside the US, and with ECOG of 1. The HNSCC population appears to be sicker than the 
population in the Reference Safety Dataset considering the high proportion of subjects with a baseline 
ECOG status of 1 and the less favourable safety profile. Differences in drug exposure and patient 
characteristics among datasets were likely due to epidemiological and clinical features associated with 
R/M HNSCC. 
Overall, the adverse event summary demonstrated a favourable safety profile for pembrolizumab 
compared to standard treatment options (cetuximab, docetaxel, or methotrexate) mainly due to lower 
frequencies of  drug-related toxicity (drug-related AEs 63% vs 83.8%, drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs 13.4% 
vs 36.3%, drug-related SAEs 8.9% vs 15.4%, drug-related discontinuations 11.4% vs 15.8%) and 
deaths (8.1% vs 10.7%). Differently, SAEs (44.7% vs 39.3%), and discontinuation due to SAEs (4.5% vs 
2.1%) or to drug-related AEs (6.1% vs 5.1%) were slightly more common with pembrolizumab than with 
standard treatment. In addition, it is noted that drug-related grade 3-5 AEs did not differ significantly in 
pembrolizumab- compared to cetuximab-treated patients (13.4% vs 16.9%).  
Exposure-adjusted incidence rate of AEs and of Grade 3-5 AEs were lower for the pembrolizumab arm 
than for the standard treatment group (628.28 vs 1147.61 x 100 and 316.31 vs 502.25 x 100 
person-years of exposure, respectively). Also, exposure-adjusted rates of individual AEs (incidence 
≥10%) were lower in the pembrolizumab treatment group in comparison to the standard treatment group 
with the exception of hypothyroidism.  
The adverse event profile of both study arms reflects the well-known differences and is related to the 
different mode of actions of pembrolizumab and chemotherapeutics. Adverse events regardless of 
causality were recorded in 96.7% and 97.0% in the pembrolizumab and standard treatment arms, 
respectively. AEs by SOCs occurring more often in the standard treatment than in the pembrolizumab 
arm belonged to the following: General disorders and administration site conditions (52.8% vs 65.4%), 
Investigations (26.8% vs 39.3%), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (30.1% vs 50%). On the 
contrary, Endocrine disorders (17.5% vs 5.1%), and Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
(47.2% vs 38.5%) were more frequently recorded with pembrolizumab than with standard treatment.

Page 125/151 
 
  
Among PTs, Anaemia (26.8% vs 22.6% in pembrolizumab and standard treatment arm, respectively) and 
Fatigue (19.5% vs 26.9%) were the most often observed AEs in both treatment arms. Hypothyroidism 
was more commonly reported in the pembrolizumab arm compared to the standard treatment group 
(15% vs 3.8%), and risk difference was in favour of standard treatment; differently, Mucosal 
inflammation, Stomatitis, Neutrophil count decreased and Alopecia were more often registered in 
subjects receiving standard treatment, with risk difference favouring pembrolizumab.  
At specific treatment comparisons, Hypothyroidism was steadily more frequently reported in 
pembrolizumab-treated subjects than in cetuximab-, methotrexate-, or docetaxel-treated participants. 
As expected, cetuximab showed a different safety profile compared to chemotherapy, with the highest 
difference in favour of pembrolizumab vs cetuximab reported for skin toxicities and hypomagnesaemia.  
Among Grade 3-5 AEs (58.1% in pembrolizumab and 59.0% in the standard treatment), Pneumonia 
(9.3% vs 6.0%) and Anaemia (6.1% vs 6.0%) were the most common in pembrolizumab-treated 
subjects; differently, Neutrophil count decreased was the most frequent Grade 3-5 AE in the standard 
treatment arm (8.5% vs 0.4%).  
Frequencies of SAEs were higher in pembrolizumab-treated subjects (44.7% vs 39.3%). SAEs most 
frequently reported (>2.0 %) were Pneumonia (8.1%), Tumour haemorrhage (3.7%), Hypercalcaemia 
(2.8%), Diarrhea, Pneumonia aspiration, and Pneumonitis (2.4% each) in subjects treated with 
pembrolizumab, and pneumonia (6.8%) and Febrile neutropenia (3.8%) in subjects treated with 
standard treatment. 2 SAEs, Tumour haemorrhage and Hypercalcaemia, accounted largely for the overall 
higher proportion of SAEs in the pembrolizumab treatment arm.  
In terms of drug-related AEs, the most often observed drug-related AEs in the pembrolizumab arm 
(incidence >5%) were Hypothyroidism (13.4% vs 0.9%), Fatigue (12.6% vs 18.4%), Diarrhoea (8.1% vs 
10.3%), Rash (7.7% vs 14.5%), Asthenia (7.3% vs 12%), Anaemia (6.9 vs 14.1), and Decreased 
appetite (5.7% vs 9.4%). All events, except hypothyroidism, had higher rates in the standard treatment 
compared to the pembrolizumab arm. Toxicity Grade 3-5 drug-related AEs more often seen in the 
pembrolizumab arm were Diarrhea (1.6% vs 0.4%) and Fatigue (1.6% vs 0.9%), while the most 
frequently observed in the standard treatment arm were Neutrophil count decreased (0.4% vs 8.5%), 
Stomatitis (0.4% vs 4.7%) and Febrile neutropenia (0% vs 4.3%). Notably, time to first drug-related 
Grade 3-5 AE was shorter in the group receiving standard treatment in respect to that treated with 
pembrolizumab.   
Among drug-related SAEs, events occurring in two or more pembrolizumab-treated subjects were 
Pneumonitis (1.6%), Diarrhoea (1.6%), and Colitis (0.8%). The most frequently reported drug-related 
SAEs among subjects treated with standard treatment were Febrile neutropenia (3.4%), Pneumonia, 
Neutrophil count decreased, and Stomatitis (each 1.3%). 
Frequency of AEs leading to death was quite similar across the KN040 study arms (20/246 [8.1%] vs 
25/234 [10.7%]), and in both treatment arms the most common cause was Pneumonia (2.4% vs 2.1%).  
The 20 deaths reported in the KN040 pembrolizumab-treated arm were due to: Pneumonia in 6 subjects 
(2.4%), Death with unknown cause in 5 subjects (2%), Tumor hemorrhage, and Respiratory failure in 2 
subjects each (0.8%). Further, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Malignant neoplasm progression, Alcohol 
poisoning, Fall, and Large intestine perforation were recorded in a single case each. None of the 5 
subjects who died due to unknown cause, underwent autopsy. In one of these cases, the Investigator 
judged the event to be related to pembrolizumab. As the narratives provided only scarce in information, 
it is not possible to assess study drug causality.  
Four subjects (1.6%) of the pembrolizumab arm were judged by the Investigator to have developed a 
drug-related, immune-related, fatal AE: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Death due to unknown cause, 
Assessment report  
EMA/543713/2018 
Page 126/151 
 
  
Malignant neoplasm progression, Large intestine perforation. Relation with the study drug was considered 
unlikely by the MAH, because of confounding variables (limited data available, concomitant antibiotics 
intake, progression of underlying neoplasm, concomitant disorder). Based on the existing information, 
causality of the fatal event with the study drug is however considered to be as follows:  
- 
“Probably-related” in one case of fatal Stevens-Johnson syndrome: even though acknowledging 
confounding co-medications, temporal relationship between exposure and event occurrence are 
plausible. Diagnosis was biopsy-proven. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (including fatal events) is a 
known adverse drug reaction associated with pembrolizumab and addressed in the current SmPC 
for Keytruda.  
- 
“Probably-related” in one subject with Large intestine perforation: immune-mediated AE with 
perforation of the intestine is listed in SmPC. Though biologic causality is plausible and time to 
onset is appropriate, association with mesenteric ischemia is likely. It is agreed that peripheral 
artery disease is a confounding factor; 
- 
“Possibly-related” in one case with Death due to unknown cause: causality with the study drug 
cannot be excluded, given the temporal relationship. No active comorbid condition, relevant 
comedication, or life-style health risks were recorded; 
- 
“Unlikely-related” in one case with Malignant disease progression: disease progression is a more 
plausible explanation for the fatal event. 
Two deaths in the control arm were considered related to standard treatment (0.8%): Pneumonia and 
Malignant neoplasm progression.  
The Applicant provided a tabular overview of all 388 deaths by category. Most subjects died due to 
progressive disease in both the pembrolizumab group and standard treatment group (57.9% and 66.1%, 
respectively). Two deaths due to tumour haemorrhage resulted from carotid artery bleeding (verbatims 
acute arterial bleed from tumour  in one subject  and tumour bleeding from carotid artery) in another 
subject , both in the pembrolizumab KN040 treatment arm. Another death due to bleeding from the 
carotid arteryin a subject ) treated for HNSCC was reported from the uncontrolled phase Ib study 
3475-012. Based on the medical review of the bleeding events, the MAH concluded that the higher 
incidence of haemoptysis and tumour haemorrhage in the pembrolizumab was not drug-related, but 
rather related to the underlying disease. Currently, it cannot be conclusively decided whether the higher 
incidences of these 2 bleeding events in the pembrolizumab arm might be possibly associated with 
pembrolizumab or were rather a chance finding. In the latter case AEs of tumor haemorrhage or 
haemoptysis would be expected to be more balanced between treatment arms in further randomized 
clinical trials of pembrolizumab in the indication HNSCC. It might be considered to describe the 
information regarding the imbalance in bleeding events between treatment arms in the SmPC. However, 
data are currently limited to one randomized study. The Applicant reviewed all SAEs of haemorrhage with 
respect to associated carotid artery bleeding both in the KN040 population and in HNSCC population as 
per CHMP request. No new safety signal was detected. 
At comparison of KN040 pembrolizumab-treated subjects with the other submitted Datasets, the overall 
frequency of AEs (regardless causality) was similar in the KN040 and the Reference Safety Dataset 
(96.7% vs 97.4%, respectively). Considering the comparable pattern of fatal SAEs in both treatment 
arms in study KN040, the higher frequency of fatal SAEs as compared to the Reference Safety Dataset 
seems to generally reflect the course of the underlying disease. 
Individual AEs registered with higher frequency in the KN040 population than in the Reference Safety 
Dataset were: Anaemia (26.8% vs 12.4%), Hypothyroidism (15% vs 8.4%), Pneumonia (11% vs 5%), 
and Dysphagia (9.8% vs 2.1%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/543713/2018 
Page 127/151 
 
  
Drug-related AEs were quite comparable in KN040 pembrolizumab-treated subjects (63%) and the 
population of the Reference Safety Dataset (69.3%). Only Hypothyroidism (13.4% vs 7.6%) and 
Anaemia (6.9% vs 3.4%) had higher rates in the trial than in the Reference Safety Dataset. Nevertheless, 
frequency and profile were superimposable to that of the Pooled HNSCC Dataset (63.5%). Frequency of 
drug-related grade 3-5 AEs consistently ranged from 13.4% to 14.4% across all Datasets.  
Proportion of SAEs was to some extent higher among HNSCC patients treated with pembrolizumab either 
in the KN040 trial (44.7%) or in the Pooled HNSCC Dataset (46.1%), when compared to subjects included 
in the Reference Safety (37.2%) or the Cumulative Running Safety (38.4%) Datasets. Frequency of 
drug-related SAEs was instead consistent among all datasets (range 8.9%-10%). When summarizing the 
individual SAEs of Pneumonia, Pneumonia aspiration and Pneumonitis, the rate appeared higher in 
HNSCC compared to the other safety datasets. When the SOC Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders is analysed, no substantial differences have been observed across datasets. In the KN040 trial 
(8.1%) and the Pooled HNSCC Dataset (8.1%) AEs leading to death rates were twice as high as that of the 
Reference Safety Dataset (3.9%). Unbalance is seen in the rate of Pneumonia, which was higher in KN040 
(2.4%) and in Pooled HNSCC Dataset (1.3%) compared to the Reference Safety Dataset (0.6%).  
The number of elderly subjects ≥75 years included in the ASaT population is low (18 subjects in the age 
group between ≥75 years and <85 years, and 1 subject ≥85years in the pembrolizumab arm), and no 
conclusions can be drawn regarding subjects >75 years due to limited dataset. Based on the provided 
data, no concerns are raised, when analyzing safety profile across different levels of age. As expected, 
ECOG performance status had a marked influence on the safety profile in both treatment groups, with 
higher frequencies of Grade 3 to 5 AEs, SAEs, deaths, dose modifications and discontinuations from 
treatment in subjects with ECOG status of 1 at baseline compared to ECOG status of 0. With regard to 
gender, though comparison of overall AEs was similar among males and females, women had a higher 
frequency of overall and drug-related SAEs, deaths, and treatment modifications, as well as 
discontinuations. This finding has not been confirmed in the Reference Safety Dataset, where no major 
difference has been observed among gender, and could be influenced by the underrepresentation of 
female participants included in HNSCC trials (predictable based on epidemiology of HNSCC). The MAH 
was asked to discuss this apparent difference in safety profile by gender. It is acknowledged that 
pembrolizumab-related AEs are higher in male compared to female (64.6% vs 55%). On the contrary, 
slightly higher frequencies of drug-related SAE, and drug-related AEs leading to death and 
discontinuation were observed in female compared to male. The limited number of women in the 
pembrolizumab arm could have influenced the reported differences, although the small subgroup is not 
allowing reaching solid conclusion. 
The MAH has provided adverse events summary tables according to PD-L1 expression (CPS <1 vs CPS 
≥1; and CPS <10 vs CPS ≥10), as requested, as well as exposure-adjusted AEs (data not shown). 
Overall, the safety profile of pembrolizumab does not appear to be impacted by PD-L1 status. With 
regards to AEOSIs (which include Immune-mediated events and Infusion-related reactions), no new 
immune-mediated events associated with pembrolizumab treatment for R/M HNSCC were identified. 
However, a higher rate of pembrolizumab-related hypothyroidism was seen in the KN040 pembrolizumab 
arm (13.4%) and consistently in the Pooled HNSCC Dataset (11.2%), compared to both the KN040 
standard treatment group (0.9%) and to the Reference Safety Dataset (7.6%). Grade of hypothyroidism 
was generally 1-2, and no SAE or deaths have been related to this type of event. Almost all subjects 
(95%) with hypothyroidism had previously received radiotherapy. Only very few subjects were treated 
with systemic corticosteroids, that were started at low dose. At study cut-off date, 67% of the events 
remained unresolved with the need of long-term hormone replacement therapy. No difference was 
observed in severity nor in the management of hypothyroidism in subjects with HNSCC compared to 
subjects treated with pembrolizumab for other indications, with the exception of a shorter median time to 
onset of first hypothyroidism event (64 days in both KN040 and Pooled HNSCC Dataset vs 106 and 103 
Assessment report  
EMA/543713/2018 
Page 128/151 
 
  
days in the Reference Safety and in the Cumulative Running Safety Datasets, respectively). The MAH 
included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC, a warning for the more frequent occurrence of hypothyroidism in 
HNSCC patients receiving pembrolizumab and previously treated with RT, as requested. 
The MAH analyzed specifically the AEOSI Oedema, as previous pembrolizumab R/M HNSCC trials 
frequently reported the occurrence of localized oedema. In the KN040 trial, proportions of drug-related 
oedema were comparable between the two arms (2.9% vs 2.1% for pembrolizumab and standard 
treatment, respectively), and the majority of events were low grade and not impacting on treatment. 
Frequencies of the 5 most common oedema events were similar in the pembrolizumab treatment group 
and the total HNSCC population, but higher when compared to the Reference Safety Dataset. Therefore, 
based on the data provided, oedema does not raise major concerns. Oedema (comprising the following 
terms: oedema peripheral, generalised oedema, fluid overload, fluid retention, eyelid oedema and lip 
oedema, face oedema, localized oedema and periorbital oedema) is listed in section 4.8 of the current 
SmPC for Keytruda™ with the frequency “common”. 
A trend towards higher proportions of hypercalcaemia can be seen in the laboratory tests, and in the 
Grade 3-4 AEs in the pembrolizumab treatment group. Some of the AEs of hypercalcaemia are possibly 
AEs of hypercalcaemia of malignancy that have not been reported (and therefore, not coded) as such; 
however, hypercalcaemia is also listed as adverse drug reaction to pembrolizumab in section 4.8 of the 
current SmPC for Keytruda™ with the frequency “uncommon”. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The submitted safety analyses support the conclusion that overall pembrolizumab compares favourably 
with standard treatment, particularly with regard to drug-related events and time to first Grade 3-5 AE in 
subjects with R/M HNSCC failing platinum-containing chemotherapy. No new safety issues have 
emerged. The safety profile appeared consistent with the previously-reported pembrolizumab toxicity, 
even though a higher risk of immune-mediated, low-grade, generally persistent hypothyroidism in 
pembrolizumab-treated subjects with R/M HNSCC was found. Most of the subjects experiencing 
hypothyroidism had received previous radiotherapy and showed an earlier onset of the event when 
compared to that in other pembrolizumab indications. A review all SAEs of haemorrhage with respect to 
associated carotid artery bleeding did not identify any new safety signal.   
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are being 
updated to include treatment as monotherapy of recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma (HNSCC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a ≥ 50% TPS and progressing on or 
after platinum-containing chemotherapy based on the results from KEYNOTE-040 (KN040). The Package 
Leaflet is being updated accordingly. In addition, section 5.2 of the SmPC is being updated to include a 
description of pembrolizumab PK results on time-dependent change in clearance using a time-dependent 
pharmacokinetic (TDPK) model structure rather than the static PK model structure. 
In addition, the existing obligation in the Annex II with regard to the further exploration of the value of 
biomarkers to predict the efficacy of pembrolizumab has been updated to include also the HNSCC study 
(KN040).

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
- A CHMP request was received during variation EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0023/G (new indications in 
urothelial carcinoma approved on 24-Aug-2017) to perform a new user testing considering that all 
sections of the package leaflet were affected since marketing authorization. The proposed revisions 
included in this variation for R/M HNSCC do not constitute significant changes that would require the need 
to conduct a new user consultation. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The following extension of indication for pembrolizumab is sought: “KEYTRUDA is indicated for the 
treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with disease 
progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy”. 
After the second RSI, the indication was restricted to include patients whose tumor express PD-L1 as 
follows:  
“KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a ≥ 50% TPS and 
progressing on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy (see section 5.1).” 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the first-line treatment of R/M HNSCC, combination therapy with cetuximab plus cisplatin/carboplatin 
plus 5-fluorouracil followed by maintenance cetuximab (the “EXTREME” regimen) has shown the best 
results so far. Patients who progress on (or are ineligible for) the EXTREME regimen and other 
cetuximab-based first-line treatments can participate in a clinical trial, receive systemic therapy or best 
supportive care. Systemic therapies may include cisplatin/carboplatin, 5-FU, cetuximab, docetaxel, 
paclitaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, methotrexate, capecitabine. Nivolumab has been recently approved 
in EU in the same indication pembrolizumab is applying for. Nivolumab was approved regardless PD-L1 
expression.  
Patients with R/M HNSCC have a poor prognosis with median overall survival of under 1 year. Treatment 
is dictated in large part by the patient’s performance status, which is one of the most important factor 
associated with clinical outcome. The main treatment objectives are to prolong survival and/or provide 
symptom palliation. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Pivotal study: KEYNOTE-040, phase 3 open label randomized comparing pembrolizumab vs standard 
treatment (investigator’s choice of methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab) in R/M HNSCC progressed 
after prior platinum treatment.  
Supportive studies: phase 2 single arm KEYNOTE-055 and phase Ib KEYNOTE-012.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
•  HR for OS in the overall population was 0.80 (95%CI 0.65, 0.98), corresponding to a gain in median 
OS of 1.5 months (not adjusted for multiplicity).  
•  OS curves separate after month 4-5 and further tend to divide over time  
• 
Efficacy results are partially enriched in PD-L1 CPS ≥1 (HR=0.74), but highest advantage is seen in 
strongly positive (TPS≥50%) tumours (HR=0.53) 
•  Median DOR and rate of patients with ≥6 months response duration notably in favour of 
pembrolizumab  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
• 
• 
Primary OS analysis (DBL 04-JUN-2017), the only p-value provided for statistical inference not 
statistically significant (HR 0.82). Despite the fact that the primary efficacy analysis has been 
performed based on a higher number of events than originally planned, it did not show statistically 
significant results.  
Pembrolizumab OS curve lies below/overlaps the one of the standard treatment arm up to month 4-5. 
A higher number of deaths within two months from randomization is seen in the pembrolizumab arm 
compared to the control arm. Further data have been requested to determine potential factors useful 
to select patients in clinical practice.  
•  Several protocol amendments modified the statistical component of the study design and sample 
size, having implications for the clinical interpretation of the results.  
•  Detrimental effect of pembrolizumab over standard treatment in the NA population, with OS 
overperformance of the standard treatment arm. 
• 
Longer median time to response of pembrolizumab vs standard treatment in Keynote-040, longer 
compared also to pembrolizumab in the supportive studies.   
•  No subjects with ECOG PS ≥2 or active brain metastasis have been enrolled. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
• 
• 
• 
The overall exposure-adjusted AE rate was lower in the pembrolizumab-treated group than in the 
standard treatment group (1969.8 events/100 person-years versus 3245.7 events/100 
person-years). 
Frequencies of SAEs were higher in pembrolizumab-treated subjects (44.7% vs 39.3%), mainly due 
to SAEs of hypercalcaemia and tumour haemorrhage. Proportions of drug-related SAEs were lower in 
pembrolizumab-treated subjects (8.9% vs 15.4%). 
Two deaths in the pembrolizumab-treated subjects resulted from carotid artery bleeding.  
Among 246 pembrolizumab treated subjects, 4 deaths (1.6%) were assessed as study-drug associated 
(death, unspecified, large intestine perforation; malignant neoplasm progression, and Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome). SJS is a known adverse drug reaction associated with pembrolizumab, large intestine 
perforation is considered to be more likely associated with mesenteric ischemia.  
•  SOCs more frequently recorded in the standard treatment arm were: General disorders and 
administration site conditions (52.8% vs 65.4%), Investigations (26.8% vs 39.3%), Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders (30.1% vs 50%). On the contrary, Endocrine disorders (17.5% vs

5.1%), and Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (47.2% vs 38.5%) were more often 
registered with pembrolizumab.  
•  A higher rate of drug-related hypothyroidism seen in the KN040 pembrolizumab arm (13.4%) and in 
the Pooled HNSCC Dataset (11.2%), compared to both the KN040 standard treatment group (0.9%) 
and to the Reference Safety Dataset (7.6%). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
• 
• 
• 
Interpretation of safety in the elderly is limited by small numbers of subjects in the 75 to 84 years of 
age subgroup (n = 18) and the fact that there was only 1 treated subject ≥85 years of age. However, 
there were no indications of worse (or better) safety in the elderly ≥65 years (relative to younger 
subjects (< 65 years) in the Reference Safety Dataset comprising the data for the 2 approved 
indications. No data on very old subjects (75 years and older) were provided in the Reference Safety 
Dataset. 
Experience with pembrolizumab in HNSCC is, from a safety perspective, limited, and long-term safety 
is not well characterised. There is, however, a relatively large safety dataset of pembrolizumab 
monotherapy in other indications. The safety of pembrolizumab in HNSCC was generally consistent 
with the overall experience with pembrolizumab in 2 other tumour types. 
Interpretation of safety in female subjects is impacted by the limited dataset (n = 40 [16.3%]).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Despite the fact that the primary efficacy analysis has been performed based on a higher number of 
events than originally planned, the pivotal trial KEYNOTE-040 did not show statistically significant OS 
result. As seen with other anti-PD1 (nivolumab) in the same setting, as well as with pembrolizumab in 
other indication, pembrolizumab OS curve lies below/overlap with the one of the standard treatment arm.  
The OS curves appear to cross at month 4-5, then the clinical advantage of pembrolizumab is seen in the 
separation of the curves which tend to further divide over time. Increased risk of early death with 
pembrolizumab over standard treatment within the first two months from randomization has been 
investigated, showing that the PD-L1 expression is one of the factor to take into account.   
Evaluation of PD-L1 expression in tumour- and immune cells (CPS) has not been implemented as 
stratification factor at randomization (but TPS <50% vs. ≥50%), since the clinical relevance of CPS has 
been only identified during the conduct of the study based on phase II data. 
The positive results seem to be driven by subjects whose tumor has PD-L1 CPS score ≥1, with highest 
advantage for strongly positive PD-L1 expressing tumours (TPS ≥ 50%). Response rate appears not 
outstanding, although the benefit of pembrolizumab is primarily laying on the longer median duration of 
response and durable response rate, which is confirmed in the supportive studies. However, no benefit is 
seen in OS and PFS, if not even a detrimental effect in ORR, in the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 CPS<1 
expression.  
The highest advantage of pembrolizumab compared to standard treatment is seen in strongly positive 
PD-L1 expressing tumours (i.e. TPS≥50%) comprising about 25% of the overall population (and 
approximately 33% of CPS≥1 subjects). In the TPS≥50% population, the benefit of pembrolizumab vs 
standard treatment is clear and observed in all efficacy endpoints. OS curves do not overlap, clearly 
separating from the beginning, with OS HR=0.53 (95%CI 0.35-0.81). 
In the subgroup of patients with CPS≥1 but TPS<50%, the benefit has not been convincingly 
demonstrated. 
The drug-related toxicity appears to compare quite favourably with the standard treatment. No new 
safety issues have been highlighted.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the overall data provided an indication of pembrolizumab in R/M HNSCC tumour with PD-L1 TPS 
score ≥50% is deemed appropriate. 
Even taking into account the methodological limitations, and the results in the ITT population, in patients 
whose tumour has a PD-L1 TPS score ≥50% a strong treatment effect with a separation of the KM OS 
curves from the beginning is observed supporting the beneficial effect of pembrolizumab over standard 
treatment, combined with an overall more favourable safety profile compared to standard treatment.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Keytruda for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic HNSCC in adults whose tumours 
express PD-L1 with a ≥ 50% TPS and progressing on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy is 
positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, II and 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
IIIB 
approved one  
Extension of Indication to include treatment as monotherapy of recurrent or metastatic head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a ≥ 50% TPS and 
progressing on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy based on the results from KEYNOTE-040 
(KN040) with supportive data from two additional single arm studies (KEYNOTE-012/ KEYNOTE-055). 
KN040 is a randomized, multi-center, pivotal phase III study investigating KEYTRUDA as a monotherapy 
versus standard treatment (methotrexate, docetaxel or cetuximab) in 495 patients with recurrent or 
metastatic HNSCC who have previously progressed on prior platinum. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 
4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to include in SmPC section 5.2 the description of 
pembrolizumab PK results on time-dependent change in clearance using a time-dependent 
pharmacokinetic (TDPK) model structure rather than the static PK model structure. 
Furthermore, the existing obligation in the Annex II with regard to the further exploration of the value of 
biomarkers to predict the efficacy of pembrolizumab has been updated to include also the HNSCC study 
(KN040). 
An updated RMP version 16 was agreed during the procedure.

4. The value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of pembrolizumab should be further 
explored, specifically: 
Additional biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status by Immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) (e.g. PD-L2, RNA signature, etc.) predictive of pembrolizumab efficacy should be 
investigated together with more information regarding the pattern of expression of 
PD-L1  obtained in the ongoing NSCLC studies (P001, P010, P024 and P042)  
and urothelial carcinoma studies (KN045, KN052)  
and HNSCC study (KN040): 
•  Genomic  analyses  using  whole  exome  sequencing  and/or  RNAseq  (e.g.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Eylea contains the active substance aflibercept (also referred to as VEGF Trap), which is a recombinant 
fusion protein consisting of ligand binding regions within the extracellular domains of the human VEGF 
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 6/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
receptor (VEGFR) linked to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin IgG1. More specifically, aflibercept 
comprises immunoglobulin domain 2 from VEGFR1 fused to Ig domain 3 from VEGFR2, which in turn is 
fused to the constant region of a human IgG1.  
Aflibercept binds multiple isoforms of VEGF-A and placental growth factor-2 (PlGF-2) which are 
members of the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that act as potent mitogenic, chemotactic, and 
vascular permeability factors for endothelial cells, producing pathological neovascularization, excessive 
vascular permeability, and vascular inflammation. 
Eylea has been approved in the European Union (EU) under the centralised procedure by Commission 
Decision on 22 November 2012 for the treatment of adult patients with neovascular (wet) age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD). The indication was later extended by Commission Decision on 26 August 
2013 to include treatment of visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to central retinal 
vein occlusion (CRVO) in adults.  
Eylea is a solution for injection available in vials or pre-filled syringes. The recommended dose for 
Eylea is 2 mg aflibercept equivalent to 50 microlitrers given intravitreally (IVT). 
With this application, the MAH sought the addition of a new indication for adults “for the treatment of 
diabetic macular oedema (DME)”. In support of this application, the MAH submitted results from the 
clinical development program including a Phase 2 study (DA VINCI) and two similarly designed phase 3 
studies (VISTA and VIVID).  
Diabetic macular oedema (DME) is one of the major causes of visual impairment in patients with 
diabetic retinopathy (DR).  DR is a complication of diabetes resulting from damage to the blood vessels 
of the retina in the back of the eye. The risk of related visual loss in people with diabetes is up to 25 
times higher than in the population not affected by diabetes. Vision loss may become irreversible when 
anatomic structures are impaired due to macula oedema chronicity. DME is often bilateral and 
therefore, may affect greatly the quality of life of active subjects. 
About 10 % of diabetic patients are affected by DME. The control of diabetes-associated metabolic 
abnormalities (i.e., hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, and hypertension) is of importance in preserving 
visual function since these conditions have been identified as major risk factors for both the 
development and progression of DR and DME.  
In 1985, the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) established macular laser 
photocoagulation as the standard of care for DME and laser became for years the mainstay of DME 
treatment. At the time of this report, other therapeutic options for the management of DME included 
surgery, steroids, and anti-VEGF agents. 
Several proinflammatory cytokines including VEGF have been shown to be extensively involved in the 
development and progression of DME. VEGF promotes neovascularization and microvascular leakage, 
which are thought to contribute to vision loss. Consequently, antagonising the VEGF-mediated 
pathological vascular hyperpermeability in the retina may help stabilising vision but also maintaining 
and improving vision.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP.

2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In line with the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 1), since aflibercept is a protein and unlikely to result in a significant risk to 
the environment, Eylea is exempted from an environmental risk assessment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The development of aflibercept (VEGF Trap) for the treatment of DME occurred concurrently with the 
clinical development programs for the treatment of neovascular AMD and CRVO. The pharmacokinetics 
(PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) observed after VEGF Trap IVT administration in subjects with AMD 
and CRVO were discussed in previous applications.  
The PK characterisation in support of this application relied partly on the data already submitted and 
assessed for the already approved indications as well as on additional data collected specifically in the 
target patients (DME patients). Considering the nature of the product and its intended use, PK data 
based on the measurement of plasma levels was only relevant with regards to the systemic tolerability 
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 9/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the product. In order to bridge the data for systemic tolerability already collected in AMD and CRVO 
patients, the systemic exposure in these latter groups of patients was compared to that observed in 
DME patients. 
Two phase 1 studies were conducted in subjects with DME receiving VEGF Trap (VGFT-OD-0307 and 
VGFT-OD-0512):  
•  Study VGFT-OD-0307  
This was a double-blind, randomised, dose-escalating study evaluating safety, tolerability and bio-
effect after intravenous (IV) administration of VEGF Trap in subjects with DME. Subjects were planned 
to receive 4 IV infusions of VEGF Trap, once every 2 weeks (day 1, day 15, day 29, and day 43), at 
dose levels of 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, or 3 mg/kg, or placebo. However, dosing was stopped before the 
planned sequential dose escalation when dose-limiting toxicities (grade 2 proteinuria in a single subject 
and grade 4 treatment-related malignant hypertension in a single subject) were observed in another 
phase 1 dose-escalation study in subjects with AMD (VGFT-OD-0305). The dose limiting toxicities 
observed in study VGFT-OD-0305 occurred at the 3 mg/kg IV dose.  
Therefore, only the lowest dose (0.3 mg/kg) of study drug was investigated. Nine subjects were 
randomised and treated (3 placebo, 6 VEGF Trap 0.3 mg/kg). Concentrations of free and bound VEGF 
Trap were determined at selected time intervals following dose administration (screening, day 1[pre-
dose], day 8, day 15, day 29, day 43, day 57, day 71, day 85, and day 133 [3 months post-last 
dose]). 
•  Study VGFT-OD-0512  
This was an open-label, proof-of-concept study evaluating safety, tolerability and bio-effect of VEGF 
Trap IVT administration in subjects with DME. Five (5) subjects with DME were enrolled. Subjects 
received a single IVT injection of 4 mg VEGF Trap into the study eye. During the first 6 weeks after the 
injection, vital signs as well as ocular and systemic adverse events( AEs) were recorded. Blood samples 
for analysis of free and bound VEGF Trap concentrations in plasma were collected at screening, day 1 
(pre-dose), day 3, day 8, day 15, day 29, day 43 and day 155 following the single IVT administration.  
A phase 2 study was conducted in subjects with DME receiving IVT injections of VEGF Trap: 
•  Study VGFT-OD-0706 – DA VINCI  
This study was a double-masked, prospective, randomised, multiple-dose study evaluating the efficacy, 
safety and tolerability of different IVT dosing regimens of VEGF Trap in DME patients (see section 
2.4.1. for details).  
PK data was obtained in a sub-study, which employed a dense sampling schedule for PK analysis in 8 
subjects with DME who had previous exposure to VEGF Trap in VGFT-OD-0706. Plasma samples were 
collected on day 1 (at 0 hours [pre dose], 4 hours post-dose, and 8 hours post-dose), day 2, day 3, 
day 4, day 5, day 8, day 15, and day 29. The PK parameters for free and adjusted bound VEGF Trap 
were estimated using non-compartmental methods.  
PK data was furthermore collected in one of the Phase 3 studies: 
•  Study 91745 - VIVID 
VIVID was a randomised, active-controlled, double-masked, multi-centre international clinical study to 
assess the potential benefit of VEGF Trap treatment administered IVT compared with the standard of 
care laser photocoagulation treatment, over 148 weeks in subjects with DME secondary to diabetes 
mellitus. Data up to the primary endpoint at week 52 were provided in support of this application. A

total of 404 subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to one of 3 treatment groups, 2 different dosing regimens 
of 2 mg VEGF Trap (with sham laser), 2Q4 or 2Q8 (following 5 initial monthly doses), or laser 
photocoagulation treatment (with sham injections).  
PK data were collected utilising a sparse sampling schedule. Plasma samples for the measurement of 
free and adjusted bound VEGF Trap concentrations were collected at week 0 (day 1 before study drug 
administration/baseline and 1 to 4 hours after the first study drug administration), day 2 to day 4, 
week 24 (before study drug administration) and week 52 (before study drug administration).  
Methods  
The same analytical methods as in previous applications for AMD and CRVO were used. 
Concentrations of free and bound VEGF Trap in plasma were measured using validated enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The assay for bound VEGF Trap was calibrated using the VEGF: VEGF 
Trap standards, and results were reported for bound VEGF Trap as weight per volume (μg/mL or 
ng/mL) of the VEGF:VEGF Trap complex. To determine the amount of bound VEGF Trap (referred to as 
adjusted bound VEGF Trap), the concentration of the complex must be adjusted by a factor of 0.717 to 
account for the VEGF present in the bound complex. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for the free 
and adjusted bound assays is 0.0156 μg/mL and 0.0315 μg/mL, respectively.  
Dense VEGF Trap plasma concentration-time data were used to calculate PK parameters by non-
compartmental analysis for these studies. Sparse VEGF Trap plasma concentration data were used to 
compare concentrations of free and adjusted bound VEGF Trap in the DME subject population and to 
assess these concentrations in a number of sub-groups. Graphical assessments of individual and mean 
plasma concentration versus time data were evaluated, and summary statistics of the derived 
parameters were generated. 
In each of the clinical studies, mean VEGF Trap concentrations in plasma were calculated from all the 
individual subject results. For the calculation of the arithmetic means, those individual concentrations 
that were below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) were assigned a value of 0 μg/mL.  
Results 
Study VGFT-OD-0307:  
Following administration of 0.3 mg/kg VEGF Trap IV, free VEGF Trap was quantifiable in plasma in 2 of 
the 6 subjects, 2 weeks after the first dose. Free VEGF Trap concentrations were quantifiable in plasma 
in 5 of the 6 subjects, 2 weeks after the last dose, but no longer 28 days after the last dose (study day 
71). Plasma concentrations of bound VEGF Trap were quantifiable in all subjects after the initial drug 
administration (day 1) up through day 85 of the study (42 days following the last dose). At the last 
scheduled sampling time point (day 133, i.e. 90 days following the last dose), concentrations of bound 
VEGF Trap were still quantifiable in 3 of the 6 subjects. At no time were the levels of free VEGF Trap in 
excess of bound VEGF Trap, nor was there a plateauing of the systemic bound VEGF Trap 
concentrations.  
The concentrations of both free and adjusted bound VEGF Trap in plasma were higher (approximately 
200% and 116%, respectively) at day 8 in study VGFT-OD-0307 (subjects with DME) compared to 
study VGFT-OD-0305 (subjects with AMD).  
At no time were the levels of free VEGF Trap in excess of bound VEGF Trap, nor was there a plateauing 
of the systemic bound VEGF Trap concentrations. Taken together, these data suggest that in this 
study, there was no evidence for saturation of VEGF binding.

VGFT-OD-0512 
Free VEGF Trap plasma concentrations following a single IVT dose of 4 mg VEGF Trap into the study 
eye were below LLOQ at baseline, as well as at the day 15 and later visits. Free VEGF Trap was 
detectable in plasma only at the day 3 and day 8 sampling times. Maximum detected concentration of 
VEGF Trap was 0.092 mg/L and 0.036 mg/L on day 3 and day 8, respectively, and the mean 
concentrations were 0.050 mg/L and 0.027 mg/L, respectively.  
All plasma concentrations of bound VEGF Trap that were collected before the first dose (screening and 
day 1), at a follow-up visit (day 155), and at the early termination visit (1 sample, day 82) were BLQ. 
Measurable concentrations of bound VEGF Trap in plasma were observed between day 3 and day 43. 
The adjusted bound VEGF Trap concentrations in plasma were generally low. The concentration-
versus-time profile of bound VEGF Trap concentrations did not suggest that PK saturation was 
achieved.  
None of the 5 subjects had detectable anti-VEGF Trap antibodies. 
VGFT-OD-0706 
Following a 2 mg IVT administration, the systemic exposure to free VEGF Trap was low. Complete 
concentration-time profiles were not obtained for most subjects because of the low systemic 
concentrations of free VEGF Trap. Each subject had a varying number of samples with concentrations 
of free VEGF Trap below the LLOQ, and only a total of 35% of the post-dose samples were above the 
LLOQ and quantifiable. Despite using a dense sampling scheme, only a limited number of detectable 
concentrations of free VEGF Trap were observed, and thus an elimination half-life (t 1/2) for free VEGF 
Trap could not be accurately determined. However, by visual inspection of the mean data, the 
concentration-time profile of free VEGF Trap could be described by an initial absorption phase followed 
by a single elimination phase. 
The maximum plasma concentration (cmax) of free VEGF Trap observed among individual subjects 
ranged from 0 μg/mL to 0.0760 μg/mL, with a mean of 0.0320 μg/mL and a median of 0.0340 μg/mL. 
The variability in exposure between subjects was large, presumably because concentrations of free 
VEGF Trap were close to or below the LLOQ for the analytical assay. 
The median time to peak systemic concentrations of free VEGF Trap occurred approximately 14 hours 
to 15 hours following IVT administration (median t max = 0.625 days). The area under the 
concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the last validated measurable plasma concentration 
(AUClast) ranged from 0 to 0.165 day•μg/mL (median of 0.0767 day•μg/mL). For those subjects with 
detectible concentrations of free VEGF Trap, the duration of exposure was short, with a median time to 
LLOQ of 3.6 days (ranging from 0.974 days to 7.03 days [actual times]).  
The systemic exposure to adjusted bound VEGF Trap was low. In 7 out of 8 subjects, pre-dose 
concentrations of adjusted VEGF Trap:VEGF complex were below the LLOQ of the assay. A baseline 
concentration of adjusted VEGF Trap:VEGF complex (0.106 μg/mL) was observed in one subject, who 
was last treated with VEGF Trap 29 days (as part of VGFT-OD-0706 [DA VINCI]) prior to enrolment in 
this PK sub-study. For one subject, all post-dose concentrations of adjusted VEGF Trap:VEGF complex 
were found to be below the LLOQ. Of the remaining 7 subjects, concentrations of adjusted VEGF 
Trap:VEGF complex were low with a highest observed concentration of 0.182 μg/mL and a total of 
54% of the post-dose samples above the LLOQ. 
The mean concentration–time profiles observed were described by an initial increase in adjusted bound 
VEGF Trap concentrations to a plateau. The cmax of adjusted bound VEGF Trap observed among 
individual subjects ranged from 0 μg/mL to 0.182 μg/mL, with a mean of 0.085 μg/mL and a median of 
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 12/79 
 
 
 
 
 
0.0825 μg/mL. Median time to cmax (tmax) was 13.9 days. Following t max, there is a plateauing of 
adjusted bound VEGF Trap concentration which extended until the end of sampling (day 28, nominal 
time), for which an average last observed concentration (Clast) of 0.0748 μg/mL was determined. 
AUClast ranged from 0 day•μg/mL to 4.61 day•μg/mL (median of 1.88 day•μg/mL).  
Seven subjects tested negative for ADA in samples collected at hour 0 and at day 29. One subject 
tested positive in the ADA assay in samples collected at hour 0 and at day 29. 
The calculated PK parameters (cmax, t max and AUC) are provided for comparison between the DME, 
AMD, and CRVO subject populations in the table below. 
Table 1 - Summary of PK Parameters for Free and Adjusted Bound VEGF Trap in Subjects 
with DME (VGFT-OD-0706.PK), AMD (VGFT-OD-0702.PK), or CRVO (GALILEO [14130]) 
In the DME subject population, as also observed in the AMD and CRVO subject populations, the 
concentration of free VEGF Trap was very low. Mean cmax values were only 2-times, 1.2-times and 3-
times higher than the LLOQ in DME, AMD and CRVO patients, respectively. 
VIVID 
After IVT administration of 2 mg VEGF Trap (2Q4 and 2Q8), the systemic exposure to free VEGF Trap 
was low. Concentrations of free VEGF Trap in plasma after repeated VEGF Trap administrations were 
quantifiable in only a minority of samples evaluated. The majority of the detectable concentrations 
Assessment report

were close to LLOQ (LLOQ = 0.0156 μg/mL) and did not exceed the LLOQ by more than about 4-fold. 
In general, free VEGF Trap concentrations were less than 0.065 μg/mL. Observed maximum 
concentrations of free VEGF Trap in the plasma were reached after 2 days to 4 days, and declined to 
BLQ in almost all subjects thereafter. Repeated administration of VEGF Trap 2Q4 or 2Q8 did not result 
in any accumulation of the VEGF Trap in plasma. 
Concentrations of adjusted bound VEGF Trap were detectable in plasma between 2 to 4 days after IVT 
administration of VEGF Trap. The maximum mean concentrations of adjusted bound VEGF Trap were 
observed at week 24, i.e. 4 weeks after the sixth administration of the 2Q4 dosing regimen and at 
week 52, i.e. 4 weeks (half the dosing interval) after the ninth administration of the 2Q8 dosing 
regimen. The maximum mean concentrations were approximately 0.150 μg/mL and 0.100 μg/mL, after 
2Q4 and 2Q8 administration, respectively. At each time, the mean free VEGF Trap concentrations had 
already declined to BLQ. 
Exploratory sub-group analyses in VIVID revealed no relevant differences in free and adjusted bound 
VEGF Trap plasma concentrations with respect to age, race, body mass index (BMI), renal impairment 
(as specified by medical history and creatinine clearance), medical history of hepatic impairment, or 
haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Comparison of ethnicity and geographical region (Japan versus non-Japan) 
did not reveal any relevant differences with respect to free VEGF Trap plasma concentration.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
As in the AMD and CRVO programs, the DME clinical pharmacology program furthermore evaluated PD 
parameters that differentiated between the local ocular and systemic effects of VEGF Trap after IVT 
administration in subjects with DME. The ocular PD effect (resolution of macular oedema) was 
assessed by measurement of central retinal thickness (CRT) using optical coherence tomography 
(OCT). Systemic PD effects were assessed using measurement of blood pressure as a surrogate 
marker. Finally, the immunogenic potential of VEGF Trap in DME patients was investigated.  
See section 2.3.2. and 2.4. for details on the study design of the clinical studies. A summary of the PD 
and immunogenicity data collected in the studies is provided below.  
•  Study VGFT-OD-0307 (phase 1 study, IV administration)  
Pharmacodynamic information gathered in this study included macular volume and blood pressure 
measurements. Furthermore, the last administration of study drug was followed by a 6-week 
observation period for retinal thickness and development of anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Subjects were 
followed up to 1 year after the last dose of study drug for safety assessment.  
•  Study VGFT-OD-0512  (phase 1 study, single IVT administration) 
Blood samples for analysis of ADA in serum were collected before study drug administration at 
screening, day 43, and day 155. Pharmacodynamic information including retinal thickness and blood 
pressure measurements was obtained. 
•  Study VGFT-OD-0706 – DA VINCI (phase 2 study) 
PD data were obtained with regards to CRT and blood pressure measurements. Serum samples for 
ADA analysis were collected on day 1 (pre dose) and on day 29. 
•  VIVID and VISTA 
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 14/79 
 
 
 
 
 
While PK data were only collected in the VIVID study, PD and immunogenicity information was 
gathered in both phase 3 trials. See section 2.4.2. for details on the design and methodologies for both 
studies.  
With respect to PD, the effect of a 2 mg dose of VEGF Trap administered IVT on CRT and blood 
pressure was explored. Serum samples for detection of ADA were collected during the first year of the 
studies at week 0 (before study drug administration) and week 52 (before study drug administration). 
Samples that were tested positive for ADA were further evaluated for neutralising antibody (NAb) 
activity. Drug concentration and ADA analyses were performed using the safety analysis set. 
Methods  
See section 2.4. for a summary of the methods for collection of PD data. 
In all clinical studies conducted, serum samples were collected for the analysis of ADAs. Two validated 
ADA assays were utilised to analyse samples. These were an original ELISA-based ADA assay that was 
used in the early phase 1 and phase 2 studies for the AMD and DME clinical development programs, 
and a bridging immunoassay that was used for the phase 3 studies in the AMD, CRVO, and DME clinical 
development programs. The sensitivity of the original ELISA assay was approximately 240 ng/mL and 
the sensitivity of the bridging immunoassay was approximately 5.4 ng/mL; about 40-fold more 
sensitive than the original ELISA. 
ADA positive samples were considered to reflect pre-treatment immunoreactivity if a subject was 
tested positive at baseline and the titer did not increase substantially in subsequent samples. A 
treatment-emergent response if the ADA test was negative at screening, but post-dose sample(s) were 
tested positive or in case of a positive screen sample and titer increases in post-dose sample(s) at 
least 4-fold. 
The NAb assay was a validated, competitive, ligand-binding assay used to analyse samples from the 
phase 3 studies in the AMD, CRVO, and DME clinical development programs. This assay incorporated a 
VEGF ELISA as an indirect method to determine the presence of NAbs that prevent the binding of VEGF 
to VEGF Trap. Results were reported as either positive or negative. 
Results 
PD parameters 
PD results for studies VGFT-OD-0706 and VIVID are discussed in section 2.4.  
Study VGFT-OD-0307 
In this study, the mean and median results for blood pressure measurements varied relative to 
baseline values, with no obvious trends relating to treatment or treatment duration in subjects 
receiving VEGF Trap versus placebo. Interpretation of ocular PD measurements was limited by the 
small total number of subjects studied (N=9) and the fact that 2 out of 3 subjects who received 
placebo withdrew prematurely from the study. A slight reduction in mean macular volume from 
baseline to day 57 was seen in the study eye of subjects in the VEGF Trap treatment group. The mean 
reductions were greater in magnitude at some time points during the study than variations in values 
determined prior to VEGF Trap administration that occurred between screening and baseline visits. OCT 
measurements were inconclusive. There was no clear effect of VEGF Trap on foveal thickness.

VGFT-OD-0512 
At visits on day 3 through day 43, excess retinal thickness of the study eye was less than the baseline 
measurements for all subjects (with individual changes ranging from -4 μm to -235 μm, and median 
changes of -58 μm to -84 μm). At most visits, the changes in mean excess retinal thickness relative to 
baseline were statistically significant by Student’s t test. 
At visits from day 3 through day 29, systolic blood pressure was generally lower than baseline, with 
median changes from baseline ranging from -14 mm Hg to -20 mm Hg. Median changes from baseline 
in diastolic blood pressure on day 3 through day 29 ranged -2 mm Hg to -6 mm Hg. Blood pressure 
values on day 43 were similar to baseline values.  
Immunogenicity 
Results from the bridging ADA assay used to evaluate samples from 864 subjects in the VISTA and 
VIVID studies are shown in the table below.  
Table 2 - Number of Subjects with Anti-VEGF Trap Antibodies by Treatment Group 
in VISTA and VIVID 
In VISTA and VIVID, samples from 461 and 403 subjects, respectively, were collected at screening or 
pre-dose day 1 (baseline), and at week 52, or at early termination, and evaluated for ADA. A total of 
15 and 4 subjects, respectively, that participated in these studies were tested ADA positive. Of these 
19 subjects, 4 were in the laser group that did not receive VEGF Trap. Subjects in the laser group 
could have been eligible to receive anti-VEGF therapy as additional treatment in the study or fellow 
eye. Two of these subjects received anti-VEGF therapy (ranibizumab and VEGF Trap, respectively). The 
majority (10 subjects) of the 15 subjects in the VEGF Trap groups that were positive in the ADA assay 
did not exhibit a treatment-emergent response, and for none of these subjects neutralising activity was 
demonstrated. These positive responses in the ADA assay were most likely due to high serum 
Assessment report

background levels in the assay or pre-existing immunoreactivity, and not an immune response to VEGF 
Trap. This is supported by the relatively low titer levels observed, the majority of which were near 30, 
the minimum for the ADA assay. 
Only 7 subjects administered VEGF Trap demonstrated a treatment-emergent positive response in the 
ADA assay and 2 of these 7 subjects were in the laser group. Most titers in the post-baseline samples 
were generally minimal or low (titers ranged from 30 to 480). Two subjects with treatment-emergent 
positive responses in the ADA assay demonstrated neutralising activity at week 52, one in the 2Q4 
group and one in the 2Q8 group. 
None of the positive responses in the ADA assay appeared to have any impact on safety parameters 
assessed. None of the subjects with a treatment-emergent positive ADA response or a NAb response 
experienced any AEs consistent with a potential immune response, such as intraocular inflammation. 
The incidence of pre-treatment immunoreactivity to VEGF Trap was approximately 1% to 2% across 
treatment groups, including the laser treatment group. The incidence of treatment-emergent 
immunoreactivity to VEGF Trap was approximately 1% across treatment groups, including the laser 
treatment group. There were no apparent differences in safety between subjects with or without ADA. 
In the phase 3 AMD and CRVO clinical studies, the incidence of pre-treatment immunoreactivity to 
VEGF Trap was 1% to 3% across treatment groups. After dosing with VEGF Trap for 52 weeks, 
antibodies to VEGF Trap were detected in a similar percentage range of subjects. There were no 
differences in efficacy or safety between subjects with or without ADA. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The development of Eylea for use in DME occurred concurrently with the AMD and CRVO development 
program. However, additional investigation of the PK, PD and immunogenicity of Eylea specifically in 
the DME population was needed, given the unique features of this disease and the population affected 
by it, including the widespread and chronic disruption of the blood-retinal barrier in diabetes, the 
potential need for long term therapy, and the comorbid status of the diabetic patient population.  
PK data were available from a range of studies, including dense PK sampling in a subset of 8 patients 
in the Phase 2 study DA VINCI. The peak and total systemic exposure to both free and adjusted bound 
Eylea in DME patients was comparable to that observed in AMD and CRVO patients. Small differences 
observed in the mean concentration-time data, appeared to reflect the high variability, the few 
numbers of subjects with detectable concentrations of free VEGF Trap in each study, and the low 
concentrations measured.  
When comparing data from phase 1 IV-dosing studies conducted in DME and AMD patients, both free 
and adjusted bound VEGF Trap plasma concentrations were found to be higher (approximately 200% 
and 116%, respectively) in subjects with DME compared to subjects with AMD. This difference was 
attributed to the higher weight of DME subjects (115.5 kg mean body weight compared to 71.6 kg for 
AMD patients), which resulted in a higher total dose (0.3 mg/kg) of VEGF Trap administered. In 
addition, weight is a known covariate affecting systemic exposure of VEGF Trap.   
There were no signs of PK saturation. No accumulation of VEGF Trap in plasma was observed after 
repeated IVT administration. 
A subgroup analysis in VIVID did not reveal any effect of age, race, BMI, renal impairment, hepatic 
impairment, HbA1c, ethnicity or geographical region on systemic exposure. However, the sample sizes 
were small and associated with a high variability. Furthermore, a high number of concentration values 
were BLQ.  
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 17/79 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, no specific PK concerns arose for the DME population. Relevant PK information has been 
included in the SmPC in relation to the DME population.  
In regard to the potential immunogenicity in the DME population, VEGF Trap demonstrated very low 
immunoreactivity in the VISTA and VIVID studies. Only 7 subjects exhibited a positive response in the 
ADA assay subsequent to dosing. The antibody titers were generally low, and only 2 subjects 
developed antibodies with neutralising activity, neither of whom displayed an exacerbated safety 
profile, which was reassuring. The results were comparable to those from the AMD and CRVO 
development programs, and did not give rise to concerns.  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology program presented in support of this application was considered 
acceptable. The PK profile and immunogenicity of VEGF Trap in DME patients appear to be comparable 
to that observed in AMD and CRVO patients. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Data supporting the clinical efficacy of VEGF Trap in the treatment of DME were primarily derived from 
two phase 3 studies: Study VGFT-OD-1009 (VISTA) and Study 91745 (VIVID). Both studies were on-
going at the time of submission of this application.  
In addition, the MAH presented result from a phase 2 study VGFT-OD-0706 (DA VINCI) in support of 
the dosing regimen. 
Due to historical timing, laser therapy, which has been the standard DME therapy for years, was the 
reference treatment in all three studies. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
DA VINCI was a phase 2, double-masked, randomised, dose-ranging study conducted in 39 sites in 3 
countries (United States, Canada, and Austria) to explore the appropriate dose and dosing schedule for 
VEGF Trap in the treatment of DME.  
The primary objective of the study was to explore the effect of various doses and dose intervals of IVT-
administered VEGF Trap on BCVA in patients with DME. 
A secondary objective of this study was to assess the dose-related effects of IVT-administered VEGF 
Trap on central retinal thickness (CRT) by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients with DME. 
The primary endpoint in the study was change in BCVA from baseline to week 24. 
The secondary endpoints were the change in BCVA from baseline to week 52, the proportion of 
patients who gained at least 15 ETDRS letters in BCVA from baseline at weeks 24 and 52, the change 
from baseline in CRT at weeks 24 and 52 as assessed by OCT, and the number of focal laser 
treatments. 
In order to be eligible for recruitment, patients had to be adults ≥ 18 years with type 1 or 2 diabetes 
mellitus with clinically significant DME with central involvement (defined as OCT CRT ≥250 µm) and 
best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/40 to 20/320 (letter score of 73 to 24) in the study eye. 
Major exclusion criteria were previous vitrectomy, recent pan retinal photocoagulation, macular laser, 
intraocular steroids or anti-VEGF, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy.  
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 5 treatment groups:  
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 18/79 
 
 
 
 
 
•  0.5 VEGF Trap IVT every 4 weeks (0.5Q4);  
•  2 mg VEGF Trap IVT every 4 weeks (2Q4),  
•  2 mg VEGF Trap IVT every 8 weeks (2Q8) [following monthly injections for the first 3 months],  
•  2 mg as needed (2PRN) according to VEGF Trap re-treatment criteria [following monthly 
injections for the first 3 months];  
• 
laser photocoagulation [focal laser using modified ETDRS technique], at week 1 and once every 
16 weeks according to laser re-treatment criteria (laser).  
Patients received an injection (active or sham) at every visit, and laser (active or sham) at week 1 
(visit 3) and 1 week after study visits at which patient met the laser re-treatment criteria.  
The PRN VEGF Trap re-treatment criteria were as follows (any 1 of the criteria was required): 
•  An increase in retinal thickness >50 μm in the central subfield on OCT compared to the lowest 
previous measurement; 
•  New or persistent cystic retinal changes or sub-retinal fluid on OCT or persistent diffuse 
oedema ≥250 µm in the central subfield on OCT; 
• 
• 
Loss of ≥5 letters from the best previous measurement in conjunction with any increase in 
retinal thickness in the central subfield on OCT; 
In the absence of retinal oedema in the central subfield, there was an increase in visual acuity 
(VA) between the current and most recent visit of ≥5 letters. 
Laser re-treatment criteria (any 1 of the criteria was required): 
• 
Thickening of the retina at or within 500 microns of the centre of the macula 
•  Hard exudates at or within 500 microns of the centre of the macula, if associated with 
thickening of adjacent retina 
•  A zone or zones of retinal thickening 1 disc area or larger, any part of which was within 1 disc 
diameter of the centre of the macula. 
Eligible patients were enrolled and randomised on day 1 (visit 2), and received treatment 
(active/sham) at each study visit every 4 weeks, until week 52. After the 1-year treatment period, 
subjects were to be followed for safety in a 6-month, off-drug, follow-up phase (week 52 to week 76). 
However, the follow-up period was curtailed and the last visit for this study occurred in September 
2010 before all subjects had reached the end of the off-drug follow-up period at week 76.  
Results 
A total of 221 patients were enrolled and randomised, of whom 219 were treated: 44 patients with 
laser and 175 patients with VEGF Trap (44 patients with 0.5Q4, 44 patients with 2Q4, 42 patients with 
2Q8, and 45 patients with 2PRN). The majority of patients (80%) completed the study to the end of 
the treatment period (week 52). 
The majority of patients in each group were male (52%-64%). Most patients (86%-93%) were white; 
the mean age ranged from 61 to 64 years, with an overall range of 29 to 87 years. With the exception 
of ethnicity, no marked differences in demographic characteristics among the treatment groups were 
observed. A higher proportion of patients in the 0.5Q4, 2Q4, and 2PRN treatment groups (30%-36%) 
were Hispanic or Latino compared to the patients in the laser and 2q8 groups (12%-18%).

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (89%-98% in each treatment group) with a Diabetic Retinopathy Severity 
Score (DRSS) which was moderate or severe in intensity (76% to 93% in each treatment group) were 
the most commonly reported baseline disease. The mean Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study 
(ETDRS) letter scores and mean CRT ranged from 57.6 to 59.6 letters and 426.1 to 456.6 µm, 
respectively. HbA1C and intraocular pressure (IOP) were comparable at baseline.

Change in central retinal thickness (CRT) 
From baseline to week 24 the VEGF Trap groups showed greater mean reductions in CRT from baseline 
(-127.3 μm to -194.5 μm) compared to the laser group (-67.9 μm). The differences were statistically 
significant. The effects were maintained through week 52.  
After completion of the 3 initial monthly doses for the 2Q8 regimen, a rapid onset of small fluctuations 
in the improvement in CRT was observed that generally decreased over time, ranging from 35 μm to 
5 μm. These fluctuations were greater than those seen in the AMD studies.

Number of Focal Laser Treatments 
In the first 20 weeks of treatment, most patients in the laser group received 2 laser treatments, the 
maximum number allowed.

Starting at week 24, patients in the VEGF Trap groups were allowed to receive laser rescue treatment. 
At week 48, the mean number of focal laser treatment was <1 for all VEGF Trap groups and 2.5 for 
patients in the laser group. 
Additional analyses not identified as secondary endpoints 
o  Patients with Loss of ETDRS Letter Score 
Only a small number of patients mainly in the laser group and VEGF Trap group applying the lowest 
dose (0.5Q4) experienced a loss of 10 letters or more in the ETDRS letter score by weeks 24 and 52. 
o  Change in BCVA from Baseline to Week 76 
Not all patients reached week 76; therefore, fewer patients were included in the analysis. In addition, 
all patients were allowed to receive other treatment for DME during this off-drug follow-up period. The 
mean change from baseline in BCVA at week 76 was higher in all VEGF Trap treatment groups (5.8 
letters to 12.0 letters) compared to laser (3.0 letters). 
2.4.1.1.  Discussion 
In this Phase 2 dose-ranging study, 4 dose levels/regimens of Eylea were compared against focal laser. 
Laser was permitted no more frequently than once every 16 weeks. In practice laser is usually 
administered at minimum intervals of 12 weeks. This was reflected in the phase 3 studies. Despite this 
anomaly, the methodology of this study was considered acceptable. 
The results of this study show a rapid increase in BCVA for all active treatment groups over the first 
4-6 months, with a declining rate of increase over the subsequent 6 months. The functional endpoints 
were mirrored by reductions in central retinal thickness. The DA VINCI study was not designed to 
distinguish among treatment groups and from the data obtained, there was little difference evident 
between the active treatments in terms of efficacy. The following observations could be made:  
−  The different doses (0.5 mg or 2 mg) and dosing regimens (given every 4 weeks, every 8 
weeks or on a PRN basis, with the latter two following an initial loading regime of 3 monthly 
dose) were each superior to laser treatment and resulted in statistically significant increases in 
visual acuity and reductions in OCT measured retinal thickness at week 24. The onset of the 
treatment effects was observed in all active arms as early as week 1 for BCVA and week 4 for 
CRT. These effects were relatively well maintained up to week 52.  
−  The results of the treatment groups where patients received 2 mg VEGF-Trap at more intensive 
dosing frequencies over a 24 weeks period achieved numerically greater improvements than in 
the 0.5 VEGF-Trap group.  
−  Subjects in the 2Q8 group showed numerically less improvement in CRT and in BCVA from 
baseline compared to the subjects in the 2Q4 group.  
Based on these results, the MAH decided that the dose to advance into the phase 3 DME program was 
2 mg, and the selected dose regimens were every 4 weeks and every 8 weeks after 5 initial monthly 
doses.  
The rationale for the dose selection of 2 mg VEGF Trap was mainly based on the safety and efficacy 
results achieved in the phase 2 AMD study VGFT-OD-0508 (CLEAR-IT). Furthermore, the MAH referred 
to the scientific literature which suggested that intraocular VEGF levels may be higher in DME patients 
compared to those in AMD or CRVO patients (Campochiaro 2009). The vitreous level of VEGF has also 
been correlated with the severity of diabetic retinopathy (Funatsu 2003). The MAH also pointed out 
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 22/79 
 
 
 
 
 
that a greater proportion of patients lost vision from baseline at week 52 in the 0.5 mg treatment 
group as opposed to the 2Q4 group receiving 2mg VEGF Trap. While the CHMP considered that there 
was little evidence for the inferiority of the 0.5 mg dose compared to the 2 mg dose, the decision to 
take 2 mg forward into phase 3 rather than 0.5 mg was accepted.  
However, the CHMP considered the decision not to investigate the PRN regimen in phase 3 as 
contentious. It was agreed that a similar number of injections was administered to the 2Q8 and 2PRN 
groups, that the visual acuity and anatomic outcomes were similar between the two groups, and that it 
might generally be preferable to treat a disease proactively than prevent its worsening. However, the 
treatment period was relatively short, and DME is a chronic condition, with a waxing and waning 
course. It would therefore have been valuable to investigate a PRN dosing regime in phase 3 to gain 
information about the possible effects of a reduced injection frequency later on in the treatment 
course. 
Furthermore, in order to take into account the fluctuations in CRT observed in the 2Q8 group upon 
start of the bi-monthly treatment schedule, the applicant changed the phase 3 VISTA and VIVID 
protocols to try to improve efficacy in the 2Q8 group. The original protocol stated that the subjects in 
the 2Q8 group were to receive monthly 3 doses at the first 3 visits (baseline, week 4, and week 8) 
before starting the 2Q8 schedule. This was revised by the addition of another dose at week 12 and 
hence changing the number of initial monthly doses for subjects in the 2Q8 group to a total of 5 
injections. This change was considered acceptable by the CHMP, albeit more or less arbitrary.   
Finally, the CHMP noted that BCVA was relatively well-maintained during the 6 month off-drug follow-
up period. However, patients were allowed to receive other DME treatments during this time. The MAH 
clarified that less than a fifth of the subjects, for whom data were available at week 76, received 
additional treatments, mainly anti-VEGF agents and laser. The treatments were distributed evenly 
across the groups. Therefore, patients were able to maintain improvements in vision following one year 
of treatment with Eylea despite the limited use of further treatment in this period. This has a bearing 
on the issue of possible cessation of treatment (see also discussion on clinical efficacy in section 2.4.3. 
).  
2.4.2.  Main studies 
The two pivotal phase 3 studies in support of this application, VISTA and VIVID, have nearly identical 
overall study designs and are described together unless otherwise indicated.  
For both studies, data up to 1 year has been provided in the initial application with the period covered 
being 26 May 2011 (first subject’s first dose) to 22 January 2013 (last subject’s last visit for the 
primary endpoint) for Year 1 of VISTA, and 9 May 2011 to 03 June 2013 for VIVID. The next data cuts 
are for year 2 and 3 results (through week 148), respectively. Upon request of the CHMP, the MAH 
provided a summary of 2 Year data for the VISTA study, while 2 Year data for VIVID were not yet 
available at the time of this report.  
The primary analysis tested superiority of VEGF Trap compared to laser since laser was the standard of 
care at the time of initiation of the studies and is still used as primary therapy in many regions of the 
world.  
Efficacy and safety variables were assessed for each study individually and in an integrated analysis of 
the pooled 12-month data from the two Phase-3 studies.

Methods 
Study participants 
In VISTA approximately 402 subjects were planned to be randomised with a target of approximately 
134 subjects randomized in each treatment group. In VIVID, approximately 375 subjects were planned 
to be randomised with a target of approximately 125 subjects in each treatment group. 
The target study population in both studies were men and women 18 years and older with DME, 
involving the centre of the macula, secondary to diabetes mellitus. 
The main inclusion criteria were:  
•  Adults ≥18 years with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus; 
•  Diagnosis of DME secondary to diabetes mellitus involving the centre of the macula (central 
subfield on OCT) in the study eye;

Treatments 
Participants in both studies received either VEGF Trap, delivered IVT at a dosage of 2 mg and 
2 different regimens, or laser treatment as follows: 
•  2 mg VEGF Trap every 4 weeks (2Q4);  
•  2 mg VEGF Trap every 8 weeks (2Q8) and sham injection at alternating visits, after 5 initial 
monthly injections (day 1, week 4, week 8, week 12, and week 16); 
• 
Laser therapy using the modified ETDRS protocol (with sham injection) at day 1 and at visits at 
which patients met any of the criteria for laser re-treatment (but no more often than every 12 
weeks). From month 6 onwards laser patients were eligible for VEGF Trap treatment 
(5 monthly injections followed by 2Q8 regime to the study end) if they met the additional 
treatment criteria. During Year 3 laser patients were eligible for VEGF-Trap PRN treatment if 
they met any of the VEGF Trap re-treatment criteria. 
Figure 3 - Study flow diagram for VISTA and VIVID 
Subjects had a screening visit (day -21 to day 0), were randomised (day 1) and received active or 
sham treatment at the baseline visit (day 1) and at study visits every 4 weeks from week 4 to week 
144 (to maintain masking). Both active treatment groups also received sham laser therapy at baseline 
and at every visit starting at week 12, at which subjects met any of the criteria for laser re-treatment.  
Starting at week 24 (month 6), active laser therapy could be given to patients in the VEGF Trap groups 
when subjects met the criteria for additional treatment. 
Laser re-treatment criteria were the same as in Phase 2 (see 2.4.1. ). 
The additional VEGF Trap treatment criteria (from month 6 onwards) were as follows: 
• 
Loss at any single visit of ≥ 15 letters from the best previous visual acuity (VA) score due to 
DME and the patient’s current VA score is not better than the baseline score, or 
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 25/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Loss at 2 consecutive visits at least 7 days apart (second visit may be an unscheduled visit) of 
≥10 letters from the best previous VA score due to DME and the patient’s current VA score is 
not better than the baseline score. 
Objectives 
Both studies were designed to demonstrate superiority of IVT-administered VEGF Trap compared to 
laser treatment, which was the standard of care at the time of initiation of the clinical development 
program, in improving best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in subjects with DME.  
Secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety of IVT-administered VEGF Trap in subjects with DME, 
including specific PK in VIVID Study and antibody data in VIVID and VISTA studies.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
All primary and secondary endpoints for both studies were set at Week 52 (i.e. 12 months).  
Primary Efficacy Variable: 
The primary endpoint was the change by BCVA in ETDRS letter score (assessed using the ETDRS 
protocol at 4 meters by certified and masked visual acuity examiners to ensure consistent 
measurement of BCVA) from baseline to week 52 (visit 15). 
Secondary Efficacy Variables: 
The secondary endpoints were: 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of subjects who gained ≥10 ETDRS letters from baseline to week 52; 
Proportion of subjects who gained ≥15 ETDRS letters from baseline to week 52; 
The proportion of subjects who achieved a ≥2-step improvement on the ETDRS Diabetic 
Retinopathy Severity Score (DRSS) from baseline to week 52; 
•  Change in central retinal thickness (CRT) from baseline to week 52, as assessed by OCT 
(assessed by reading centre certified and masked OCT technicians; OCT images controlled by 
the masked readers of independent reading centre and electronically archived at the study 
sites as part of the source documentation);  
•  NEI VFQ-25 near activities subscale change from baseline to week 52; 
•  NEI VFQ-25 distance activities subscale change from baseline to week 52. 
Additional Efficacy Variables: 
The following additional endpoints were analysed at week 52: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of subjects who gained ≥0 and ≥5 ETDRS letters from baseline; 
Proportion of subjects who lost ≥5, ≥10, and ≥15 ETDRS letters from baseline; 
Time to first gain of ≥15 ETDRS letters from baseline; 
Time to first confirmed gain of ≥15 ETDRS letters from baseline; 
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 26/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Proportion of subjects with a ≥2- or ≥3-step worsening, or a ≥3-step improvement from 
baseline in the DRSS score as assessed on fundus photography; 
•  Change from baseline in the NEI VFQ-25 total score and subscales over time. 
Quality of Life was assessed based on the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire-25 
(NEI VFQ-25). In addition, in VIVID, health-related quality of life was assessed using the Euro QOL-5 
dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) was used, albeit EQ-5D score was not one of the efficacy variables.  
Sample size 
The sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint. Assuming a normal distribution for the 
primary endpoint, a true difference in the mean change in BCVA between the treatment arms (VEGF 
Trap versus laser) of 7 letters can be expected with a standard deviation for each VEGF Trap arm of 10 
letters and laser of 16 letters. A sample size of 92 patients per arm will provide 90% power for 
rejecting the null hypothesis using a 2-sided t-test at the 2.5% (5%/2) significance level (using 
Bonferroni adjustment for the 2 comparisons on the primary efficacy endpoint). Allowing for a drop-out 
rate of around 25% or 30%, approximately 125 or 134 patients per arm will be required depending of 
the study. This results in a total of approximately 375 or 402 patients for 3 groups. 
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were randomised using a ratio of 1:1:1 (2Q4, 2Q8, and laser) via interactive voice 
response system/ interactive web response system following stratification. Within each stratum, 
subjects were randomised to 1 of 3 treatment groups according to a predetermined central 
randomisation scheme. 
In the VISTA study, randomisation was stratified by history of myocardial infarction and/or 
cerebrovascular accident (yes vs. no). In contrast, in VIVID, subjects were stratified by geographic 
region (Europe/Australia vs. Japan).  
Only 1 eye (the study eye) received randomised treatment. If DME were present, the fellow eye could 
also receive anti-VEGF treatment. 
Blinding (masking) 
To enable masking of the study, all patients received either active or sham injection and laser (active 
or sham, if criteria were met) at each scheduled study visit to the end of the study.  
A masked physician was assigned to assess adverse events (AEs), perform the masked assessment of 
efficacy, assess re-treatment criteria, and assess additional treatment criteria. 
A separate unmasked (unblinded) physician administered the study drug injection, sham injection, 
laser/sham photocoagulation, laser re-treatment, and additional treatment. The unmasked physician or 
designee (eg, pharmacist) did not have any role in the study beyond the receipt, tracking, preparation, 
destruction, administration of study drug, and safety assessment during the observation period 
following study drug administration. 
Statistical methods 
The populations for analysis were defined as follows: 
• 
The  full  analysis  set  (FAS)  includes  all  randomised  patients  who  receive  any  study  drug  and 
have  a  baseline  and  at  least  1  post-baseline  assessment  of  BCVA.  Patients  were  analysed 
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 27/79 
 
 
 
 
 
according  to  the  treatment  assigned  at  baseline  (as  randomised).  All  efficacy  endpoints  were 
analysed  using  the  FAS  and  the  FAS  was  used  for  primary  analysis  (statistical  evaluation  of 
superiority). 
• 
• 
The per protocol set (PPS) includes all patients in the FAS that did not have any major protocol 
violations. The final determination on the exclusion of patients from the PPS was made during 
a  validity  review  meeting  on  the  masked  data  prior  to  database  lock.  Analysis  of  the  PPS  is 
performed  according  to  the  treatment  the  patient  actually  received  (as  treated).  The  primary 
endpoint was also evaluated on the PPS.  
The  safety  analysis  set  (SAF)  includes  all  patients  who  received  any  study  medication. 
Treatment  compliance/administration,  all  clinical  safety  and  tolerability  assessments  were 
analysed  using  the  SAF.  Patients  were  summarised  according  to  the  treatment  actually 
received  (as  treated).  The  safety  analysis  was  performed  on  the  observed  safety  data, 
regardless of additional treatment administered to patients during the study. 
Efficacy data were analysed as randomised following the intent-to-treat principle with last observation 
carried forward on the FAS. The efficacy analysis on the FAS is considered to be the primary one 
(statistical evaluation of superiority).  
Descriptive statistics for continuous variables included the mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
median, and maximum. Categorical variables were frequency and percentage. 
All statistical analysis were performed using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS), version 9.1 or higher. 
Analysis of data from the two phase 3 studies was determined based on 2 statistical analysis plans 
(SAPs) for each study: a global SAP and a US SAP (that was agreed upon with the US FDA). In both 
SAPs, the primary variables are the same; however, the designation, timing, and hierarchical test 
sequence for the secondary variables differs between the 2 SAPs. For the hierarchy defined in the US 
SAP, the only secondary variable at week 52 is the proportion of subjects who gained ≥15 ETDRS 
letters from baseline. All other secondary variables in the hierarchy defined in the US SAP are analysed 
in an exploratory manner at week 52. The integrated analysis follows the same approach. 
The primary analysis was a multiple-comparison of change in BCVA from baseline to Week 52 
comparing both active treatment arms with laser. For the VIVID primary analysis, an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model was used with baseline BCVA measurement as a covariate, and treatment 
group and geographic region (Europe/Australia, Japan) as fixed factors. For VISTA an ANCOVA model 
with treatment as the main effect, history of myocardial infarction and/or cerebrovascular accident as a 
fixed effect, and baseline BCVA measurement as the covariate was used. In order to control the 
nominal family-wise type I error rate of 5%, the Bonferroni multiple comparison test was used to 
adjust the comparisons between study treatments and control, i.e. each VEGF Trap group versus laser 
group comparison was tested independently at the 2-sided significance level of 2.5%. 
For the primary efficacy analysis, measurements obtained after the initiation of additional treatment 
were censored. Missing or censored values were imputed using the last non-censored value (last 
observation carried forward [LOCF]). Baseline values were not carried forward. 
Several pre-specified sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of statistical results 
and address the impact of missing data due to drop-outs or receipt of additional treatment. All 
sensitivity analyses were analysed on the FAS. The sensitivity analyses used for the primary efficacy 
variable were: observed case analysis, including data after additional treatment, repeated 
measurements model, multiple imputation analysis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014

A logistic regression was performed as secondary statistical method of evaluation for the primary 
endpoint. 
A testing hierarchy was defined in the global SAP for secondary criteria. This was to be applied for the 
respective active arm if the primary efficacy endpoint had shown superiority at the 2.5% level in FAS. 
While p values were reported for all comparisons, a superiority claim could be made for a given 
endpoint between the respective VEGF Trap group and the laser group only if all preceding endpoint 
comparisons in the hierarchy (including the primary endpoint) were shown to be statistically significant 
at a 2.5% 2-sided significance level. 
A series of subgroups analyses based on demographics, disease characteristics, and medical history 
were explored: Gender; Age: <55 years; ≥55 to <65 years; ≥65 to <75 years; ≥75 years; Race: 
White versus Asian (VIVID) or Black or African American, Other (VISTA) ; Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino 
(no/yes); vivid : Geographic region: Japan, Europe/Australia; Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c): ≤ 
8%, > 8%) 
Subgroups for efficacy analyses only were: Baseline VA category: <40 letters (20/160), ≥40 to <55 
letters (≥20/160 to 20/80); ≥55 to <65 letters (≥20/80 to 20/50); ≥65 letters (≥20/50). 
Subgroups for safety analyses only were: Medical history of hypertension, of cerebrovascular disease 
(eg, cerebrovascular accident [CVA]/stroke), of ischemic heart disease (eg, MI); Renal impairment; 
Hepatic impairment. 
Results 
Recruitment 
In VISTA, a total of 687 subjects were screened. Of these, a total of 466 subjects were randomised 
and 461 subjects received treatment, while 5 subjects were randomised but were not treated. Of these 
5 subjects, 3 did not meet inclusion criteria and were inadvertently randomised, and 2 withdrew 
consent. 
In VIVID, a total of 604 subjects were screened, of which 406 were randomised as follows: 135 
subjects in the laser group, 136 subjects in the 2Q4 group, and 135 subjects in the 2Q8 group. Most of 
the subjects who were not randomized were screening failures. Two randomised subjects (both in the 
laser group) discontinued before receiving treatment due to protocol deviations. 
Conduct of the study 
The VISTA study was conducted in 54 study centres in the United States of America. The original 
protocol, dated 21 March 2011, was amended three times. 
The VIVID study was conducted in 73 centres in Japan, European countries, and Australia. The original 
protocol was dated 20 October 2010 and was amended twice. 
Baseline data 
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics in the study eye are summarised in Table 5 and 
Table 6. The demographics of subjects in both studies were comparable, and balanced with the 
exception of race, ethnicity, and baseline BMI. In VISTA, a higher proportion of black subjects (11.1% 
in VISTA versus 0.5% for VIVID) and Hispanic subjects (16.6% in VISTA versus 3.2% for VIVID) were 
enrolled in the study, and a higher proportion of Asians were enrolled in VIVID (19.6% versus 2.2% for

VISTA DME). Body mass index (BMI) and mean baseline weight were slightly higher in VISTA (29.2% 
of patients with BMI over >35 kg/m²; mean body weight of 90 kg) as compared to VIVID (9.9% of 
patients with BMI over >35 kg/m²; mean body weight of 80 kg). 
With regards to geographic region (data collected only in VIVID), the majority of subjects in VIVID 
were non-Japanese (327/403, 81.1%). Regarding the stratification factors in VISTA, 13% of the 
patients had a history of myocardial infarction and 7% of cerebrovascular accident.

In the FAS of VISTA, the total mean baseline BCVA letter score in the study eye was 59.3 and was 
similar among the treatment groups. However, in the 2Q4 group a smaller proportion of subjects had a 
BCVA ≥55 to <65 letters compared to the laser and 2Q8 groups (31.8% versus 33.1% and 40.4%). 
The mean baseline HbA1C was 7.8%. A smaller proportion of patients in the laser group had a baseline 
HbA1c >8% compared to the 2Q4 and 2Q8 groups (29.2% vs. 37.0% and 37.7%). The mean duration 
of diabetes mellitus was 17.1 years and most subjects had type 2 diabetes (92.2%) and had received 
prior treatment for DME in the study eye (317/459, 69.1%). 
In the FAS of the VIVID study, the total mean baseline BCVA letter score in the study eye was 60.1 
and was similar among the treatment groups. Most subjects (30.0%) had an ETDRS DRSS score of 
level 53 (moderately severe/severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy). The mean CRT was 
520.0 μm with a higher mean CRT observed in the laser group compared to the 2Q4 and 2Q8 groups 
(540.3 μm versus 501.9 μm and 518.4 μm, respectively). The mean IOP was 15.9 mm Hg and similar 
among treatment groups. The mean baseline HbA1c was 7.7%. The mean duration of diabetes mellitus 
was 14.3 years. With regards to HbA1c, the proportion of subjects with HbA1c > 8% at baseline was 
slightly higher in the 2Q4 group (40.4% compared to 32.6% in the 2Q8 group and 31.8% in the laser 
group). 
Overall, baseline disease characteristics could be considered balanced between both phase 3 studies, 
with the exception of CRT, which was 482.6 μm in the VISTA study and 520 μm in the VIVID study. 
This may be the result of the CRT inclusion criterion in the VIVID study (≥300 µm) which was not 
present in VISTA.  
Numeric differences were also reported for the NEI VFQ25 “near and distance” activities (about 7 
points difference between VISTA and VIVID (higher values).  
In both studies and in both VEGF Trap groups, the majority of subjects had a baseline ETDRS score 
≥ 55 letters. A diabetic retinopathy severity score (DRSS) of 43, 47 or 53 was observed in 77% of 
patients at baseline. A quarter of the patients could not be graded in VIVID study (compared to only 
1.7% in VISTA study), which the MAH explained to be due to different validated methods used for 
grading DRSS by the reading centres for VIVID and VISTA. Therefore the DRSS improvement could not 
be measured in these patients. Furthermore, a total of 92% of subjects in VISTA had type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. In VIVID, post-hoc review of the medical history allowed confirmation of type 2 diabetes in 
44.7% of the patients. However, assignment of the diabetes type was not possible for the majority of 
the recruited patients (51.1%).  
In VISTA, 69.1% had received prior treatment for DME, including anti-VEGF (42.9%), IVT steroids 
(23.5%), and laser (52.9%). For VIVID, only data on prior treatment with anti-VEGF agents (8.9%) 
were provided. In VIVID 80% had received prior treatment for DME, including anti-VEGF (9%), IVT 
steroids (6%), and laser (65%). The total proportion of subjects in each study with a history of both 
pan retinal photocoagulation and macular laser was 78% in VISTA and 71% in VIVID. 
A total of 29% of subjects in VISTA were pseudophakic, compared with 15% in VIVID. 
Overall, for both VISTA and VIVID studies, the ocular and non-ocular medical and surgical history 
findings were as expected for subjects with DME. 
Baseline disease characteristics for the PPS were similar to those of the FAS.  
Numbers analysed 
Only 3 patients in total were excluded from the FAS due to not having any data post-baseline (see 
Table 7).

Table 7 – Sample size and analysis sets for VISTA, VIVID and the integrated 
analysis (all enrolled subjects) 
The proportion of subjects completing week 52 in the VISTA study (93.3%) was slightly higher than in 
VIVID (88.7%) (see Table 8).

In the integrated analysis, 77 (8.8%) subjects discontinued before week 52. The proportion of subjects 
who discontinued was somewhat higher in the laser group (10.7%) versus the VEGF Trap groups 
(7.2% and 8.7% for the VEGF Trap 2Q4 and VEGF Trap 2Q8 groups, respectively), which was mainly 
due to an imbalance in the discontinuations in the VIVID study. The most common reasons for 
discontinuation in the laser group were AEs and withdrawal of consent (3.8% for both). The most 
common reason for discontinuation in the VEGF Trap groups was withdrawal of consent (2.6%). 
More than 90% of subjects were at least 75% compliant with their injections during the first 52 weeks. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
For both individual studies as well as in the integrated analysis a statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful improvement in BCVA after 52 weeks was seen in both VEGF trap groups (2Q4 and 2Q8) 
compared to the laser group (see Table 9 and Figure 4).

Results in the PPS yielded consistency with the analyses conducted in the FAS. 
Sensitivity analyses performed on the change in BCVA from baseline to week 52 displayed similar 
results than those in the FAS and PPS using LOCF. Similar results were also displayed for PPS. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Six secondary variables were explored:  
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of subjects (%) who gained ≥10 ETDRS letters from baseline to week 52; 
Proportion of subjects (%) who gained ≥15 ETDRS letters from baseline to week 52; 
Proportion of subjects (%) who achieved a ≥2-step improvement on the DRSS from baseline to 
week 52;  
•  Change in CRT from baseline to week 52, as assessed by OCT;  
•  NEI VFQ-25 near activities subscale change from baseline to week 52; 
•  NEI VFQ-25 distance activities subscale change from baseline to week 52. 
The results by study are displayed in Table 10.

Table 10 - Secondary efficacy variables – Results from baseline to Week 52 in 
VISTA DME and VIVID DME 
With the exception of the NEI VFQ-25 score results, both VEGF-Trap treatment groups showed 
statistically significant superiority compared to laser for all secondary endpoints.  
For the NEI VFQ-25 scores, numerical improvements were seen in nearly all of the active treatment 
groups. Statistical superiority compared to laser was only reached for near activities in the 2Q4 group 
of the VISTA study, while no improvement in the distance activities scores for 2Q8 in VIVID was seen. 
With regards to CRT, fluctuations were observed in the mean change from baseline in CRT once 2Q8 
administration began (see Figure 5).

Additional endpoints 
At week 52, the 2Q4 and 2Q8 groups in both studies showed greater proportion of subjects who 
experienced a gain of ≥ 0 and ≥ 5 ETDRS letters compared to the laser group. 
At week 52, the 2Q4 and 2Q8 groups in both studies showed a smaller proportion of subjects who lost 
≥ 5, ≥ 10, and ≥ 15 ETDRS letters compared to the laser group. 
Time and confirmed time to first gain of ≥15 ETDRS letters: 
• 
• 
• 
Less than 25% of the subjects in the laser group gained ≥15 letters over 52 weeks. 
In VISTA, the median time to first gain of ≥15 ETDRS letters was 265 days in the 2Q4 group 
and 364 days in the 2Q8 group. At the 25% quartile, these were 84 and 140 days in the 2Q4 
and 2Q8 group, respectively. In VIVID, a gain of ≥15 letters was achieved by 25% of subjects 
at week 20.0 in the 2Q4 and 2Q8 groups, respectively.  
In VISTA, a confirmed gain of ≥15 letters was achieved by 25% of subjects at day 139 in the 
2Q4 group and at day 196 in the 2Q8 group. The difference between the 2Q4 and 2Q8 groups 
was seen before week 16 when both groups received monthly doses. In VIVID, a confirmed 
gain of ≥ 15 letters was achieved by 25% of subjects at week 35.9 in the 2Q4 group and at 
week 31 in the 2Q8 group.  
In VISTA, at week 52, mean increases in NEI VFQ-25 total score of 4.8, 8.5, and 6.8 points were 
observed in the laser, 2Q4, and 2Q8 groups, respectively. In VIVID, change in mean NEI VFQ-25 total 
score at week 52 compared with laser were minimal and less <1.50 point. 
In both studies, in general, fewer subjects in the 2Q4 and 2Q8 groups had ≥2 or ≥3 level worsening 
over the 52-week study period and more had ≥3 level improvement in ETDRS DRSS compared to 
subjects in the laser group.

Worsening on the DRSS ≥2-step:  
•  VISTA: 22 [14.3%] subjects in the laser group, 11 [7.1%] subjects in the 2Q4 group, and 7 
[4.6%] subjects in the 2Q8 group; 
•  VIVID: 7 [8.8%] subjects in the laser group, 1 [1.2%] subjects in the 2Q4 group, and 2 
[2.4%] subjects in the 2Q8 group.  
Worsening on the DRSS ≥3-step:  
•  VISTA: 7 [4.5%] subjects in the laser group, 4 [2.6%] subjects in the 2Q4 group, and 4 
[2.6%] subjects in the 2Q8 group, respectively); 
•  VIVID: 1 [1.2%] subject in both the 2Q4 and the 2Q8 group versus 2 [2.5%] in the laser 
group.  
Improvement on the DRSS by ≥3-steps:  
•  VISTA: 8 [5.2%] subjects in the laser group, 26 [16.9%] subjects in the 2Q4 group, and 19 
[12.6%] subjects in the 2Q8 group. 
•  VIVID: 0 [0.0%] subjects in the laser group, 3 [3.7%] subjects in the 2Q4 group, and 2 
[2.4%] subjects in the 2Q8 group). 
VISTA Year 2 results 
A summary of the key efficacy variables at week 100 (Year 2) for the VISTA study is provided below. 
Overall, these results confirmed a persistence of effect over time. 
•  Change in BCVA 
At Week 100, the mean changes from baseline for the two VEGF Trap treatment arms were 11.5 (2Q4) 
and 11.1 (2Q8). Statistically significant differences to laser were maintained through Week 100. A 
plateau seemed to be reached at the transition from the first year of treatment into the second year 
with the gain in visual acuity stabilising on a level significantly and approximately 2 lines better than 
laser, while no further gains are observed during the second year. 
•  Gain of ≥ 10 or 15 ETDRS letters from baseline 
Compared to Week 52, the gain in ETDRS letters from baseline appeared to slightly decline at Week 
100 in the two VEGF Trap treatment arms, while increased improvements were observed for the laser 
group. Nevertheless, mean differences remained statically and clinically significant in support of VEGF 
Trap. 
•  ≥ 2-step improvement in ETDRS DRSS 
Compared to Week 52, the difference in ≥ 2-step improvement in ETDRS DRSS at Week 100 for both 
VEGF Trap groups compared to laser increased and was 21.7 and 21.5% for the 2Q4 and 2Q8 group, 
respectively. 
•  Central retinal thickness (CRT) 
Between Week 52 and Week 100 improvements in CRT appear very limited (to around -5 µm for VTE 
groups and -10 µm for laser). As observed from the beginning of the 2Q8 posology (from Week 20 
onwards), the curve of improvements in CRT continued to fluctuate between two injections. 
•  Changes in NEI VFQ-25

With regards to the near activities score, at Week 100, throughout the entire observation period, mean 
changes for both VEGF Trap groups were higher than the changes in the laser group; p-values for 
differences to laser were 0.0529 (2Q4) and 0.0218 (2Q8). 
With regards to the distance activities score, at Week 100, mean changes for both VEGF Trap groups 
were higher than the changes in the laser group; the difference between 2Q4 and laser was nominally 
statistically significant p = 0.0072 but not for the difference between 2Q8 and laser (p = 0.0072). 
Ancillary analyses 
Overall, subgroup analyses were qualitatively consistent with those in the overall population for both 
pivotal phase 3 studies. 
In addition to the NEI-VFQ-25 score, quality of life was explored in VIVID based on changes in the Euro 
QOL-5 dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) score. Only minimal changes from baseline were observed. 
No results for EQ-5D were available from the VISTA study.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses) 
Results from the integrated analysis of VISTA and VIVID are presented above, as relevant. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Efficacy of Eylea in the treatment of DME was assessed in two randomised, multicentre, double-
masked, active-controlled phase 3 studies (VISTA and VIVID) conducted in patients with clinically 
significant DME. Supportive data were available from one phase 2 dose ranging study (DA VINCI, see 
section 2.4.1. ).  
A total of 862 subjects were randomised and treated in the phase 3 studies and were evaluable for 
efficacy. Of those, 576 were randomised to the Eylea treatment groups, whereby 290 patients received 
2 mg VEGF Trap every 4 weeks (2Q4), 286 received 2 mg VEGF Trap every 8 weeks following 5 initial 
monthly injections (2Q8), and 286 were treated with laser photocoagulation.  
Generally, the design and conduct of the two studies was considered acceptable. 
Differences regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria were limited between the two studies. However, 
patient population profiles in terms of baseline demographics and characteristics of disease did not 
completely match across studies. Differences included the BMI, which was higher in VISTA, CRT values 
(higher in VIVID), lack of DRSS grading in a quarter of the patients in VIVID (compared to 1.7% in 
VISTA), higher NEI VFQ-25 scores in VIVID and higher number of pseudophakic patients in VISTA.  
A total of 92% of subjects in VISTA had type 2 diabetes. In VIVID, a post-hoc review identified 45% of 
the patients to suffer from type 2 diabetes, but the diabetes type could not be determined for 51% of 
the patients. From this information, it appeared that only few subjects with type 1 diabetes were 
included in the phase 3 trials and the limited experience was reflected in the SmPC. 
Furthermore, among the total number of subjects enrolled across both studies, only 8 subjects (0.9%) 
had a baseline HbA1c > 12% (all subjects from VISTA). The limited experience in these subjects has 
been included in the SmPC. 
A larger percentage of subjects in VISTA received prior anti-VEGF treatment (43%) compared to VIVID 
(9%). As there were no apparent differences in the mean changes in BCVA and CRT at week 52 
between treatment naïve subjects and subjects who had received prior anti-VEGF treatment, this didn’t 
appear to be a major issue. Finally, differences between the studies were also noted when looking at 
any kind of prior DME treatment (69% in VISTA and 80% in VIVID). 
Taken together, the differences in the baseline characteristics suggested that subjects in VISTA may 
have had DME of a more refractory nature, particularly since the proportion of subjects who had 
received prior anti-VEGF treatment was 4 times higher in VISTA compared to VIVID.  
The CHMP also noted that subjects with significant macular ischaemia were excluded from the studies. 
However, in a small study by Chang et al 2008, anti-VEGF-treatment with bevacizumab was shown to 
reduce visual acuity in DME patients with macular ischaemia. The CHMP consequently questioned 
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 45/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
whether VEGF Trap will be effective in ischaemic patients and whether this subgroup have a higher risk 
for an impaired vision if treated with VEGF Trap. To clarify the point, the MAH provided an analysis 
comparing ischemic and non ischemic groups of patients with macula ischemia involving fovea in VIVID 
where macular ischemia was systematically assessed by the reading centre (not in VISTA). This 
analysis did not seem to reproduce the vision decrease observed by Chung et al 2008 for ischemic 
patients. However, the CHMP considered that visual acuity reduced in DME patients with macular 
ischaemia should be monitored in future PSURs. 
The primary and all secondary endpoints for both studies was set at 1 Year. This duration was 
considered too short to establish long term efficacy. However, summary results for Year 2 in VISTA 
were submitted during the review of the application (see also discussion below) and additional data 
were to be collected over the total 3 years duration of the studies.  
The choice of efficacy variables was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
With the initial application, the MAH submitted 1 Year data for both phase 3 studies. Upon request by 
the CHMP, the MAH also provided a summary of the key efficacy outcomes at Year 2 for the VISTA 
study. Data for VIVID beyond 1 Year were not yet available at the time of this report. 
Results from the two phase 3 studies showed clinically and statically relevant superiority of Eylea 
treatment over laser photocoagulation with regards to the primary endpoint, with a difference in mean 
BCVA gain of 9-12 letters in the two VEGF Trap groups compared to laser, as well as in all visual acuity 
and anatomic secondary endpoints at Week 52 (Year 1).  
The difference between the VEGF Trap groups and the laser group with regards to responders with 
≥ 15 ETDRS letters gain (i.e. 3 lines on the vision chart) was about 30-20%. Improvements in CRT 
were also significantly in favour of VEGF Trap and were seen as early as Week 1. Superiority of VEGF 
Trap compared to laser was also observed with regards to ≥2-step improvement in DRSS. However, 
supportive literature for the relevance of the DRSS endpoint to the primary indication (DME) and of the 
relevance of the effect size has not been provided. In addition, for a quarter of the patients in VIVID 
the DRSS status was not gradable. 
Results for the quality of life endpoints based on NEI VFQ-25 scores were neither statistically 
compelling (except for the near activities score in the 2Q4 group in the VISTA study) nor consistent 
across the two studies. It therefore appeared that the benefits of Eylea in terms of gain in vision and 
particularly with regards to the gain in visual acuity of 15 or more letters on the ETDRS chart was not 
well translated in a useful improvement for the management of current daily activities. However, the 
MAH explained that vision-related quality of life always considers visual function of both eyes, with 
more weight on the better-seeing eye than on the worse-seeing eye. Since in both pivotal trials, the 
study eye was defined as the worse-seeing eye and fellow-eye treatment according to standard of care 
was allowed, the outcomes may be biased and a strict correlation between visual function on the study 
eye is not necessarily expected. Furthermore, the NEI-VFQ-25 is known to have a high variability and 
the sample size might not have been sufficient to detect a difference at the statistical significance 
level. Since the overall health state of patients is not affected by ophthalmologic treatment, it can also 
be expected that despite a significant and meaningful gain in visual acuity in the study eye, these 
changes do not necessarily translate into respective benefits in health status. These explanations were 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The effect of Eylea was consistent across primary analysis and secondary analyses in the FAS and the 
PPS. Overall, a similar trend was seen in sensitivity analyses. A consistent effect was also achieved in 
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 46/79 
 
 
 
 
 
predefined subgroups although some subgroups were too small to allow firm conclusions. Furthermore, 
results from the integrated analysis were consistent with the outcome of the individual studies.  
No clear advantages were seen for the 2Q4 regimen when compared to the 2Q8 regimen. Therefore, 
the selection of the 2Q8 regimen with 5 initial monthly injections was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP from an efficacy perspective at least for the start of treatment. However, due to the limited 
available data beyond one year of treatment, uncertainties remained regarding the long-term 
management of DME with VEGF Trap which was considered to not have been fully explored. 
Efficacy data from Year 2 in VISTA confirmed maintenance of efficacy beyond Year 1. A plateau is 
reached in terms of the degree of improvement in visual acuity and CRT after 12 months. A continued 
regime of injections every 8 weeks was sufficient to maintain these improvements. Further support for 
maintenance of the effect may be given by previous experience with ranibizumab through the 
extension phase of the RESTORE study as well as RISE and RIDE studies (Ophthalmology, 2012) and 
Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network study (Ophthalmology, 2011). DA VINCI results also 
suggested that improvements in vision achieved in the first year of treatment may persist after 
treatment has ceased, as reflected in a relatively well-maintained BCVA gain during the 6 month off-
drug follow-up period of the study and despite only limited use of further treatment in this period. This 
however would support an extended treatment interval. 
Therefore, the CHMP considered that it was reasonable to allow a gradually extending interval between 
treatments after the initial year of therapy, as approved for the AMD indication. However, the benefits 
of an extended treatment interval versus a fixed dosing regimen in the long-term treatment of DME 
remain unproven as this was not investigated in the pivotal phase 3 trials. Therefore, the CHMP 
requested that the posology for long-term treatment should be further investigated in a post-
marketing study with a view to comparing different treatment regimens (2Q8, PRN and treat-and-
extend) after the first year of treatment, thereby exploring different common practices in the 
management of DME as well as criteria for possibly ceasing treatment if no longer required.  
Furthermore, in the initial posology proposal by the MAH, no rules for treatment cessation in non-
responders were defined. To assess the potential for stopping therapy in non-responders, the MAH 
presented an analysis of outcome over 12 months in three potential groups of non-responders, defined 
by change from baseline in BCVA after 3 months. However, the number of subjects in the two most 
meaningful groups (those losing or not gaining vision) was too small to allow any firm conclusions. 
Still, in order to avoid unnecessary treatment of patients not benefitting from continued therapy, it was 
recommended to discontinue Eylea if visual and anatomic outcomes indicate that the patient is not 
benefiting from continued treatment. This was agreed by the CHMP.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Taken together, data from the two pivotal phase 3 studies, VISTA and VIVID, supported efficacy of 
Eylea given every 2 months following 5 initial monthly applications in the treatment of DME. A clinically 
relevant beneficial effect was shown over 1 year of treatment for relevant visual acuity and 
morphological outcomes. Efficacy was furthermore supported by the phase 2 trial DA VINICI and 
2 year data from the VISTA trial, demonstrating maintenance of efficacy beyond the first year of 
treatment. Nevertheless, long-term efficacy data from the 2 pivotal trials VISTA and VIVID should be 
provided, once available, including full reports on the 2 year data as well as the final study reports 
covering the full treatment period of 3 years.  
The CHMP considered furthermore the following measure necessary to address issues related to long-
term efficacy:  
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 47/79 
 
 
 
 
 
Interventional post-authorisation efficacy study in patients with diabetic macular oedema with the 
primary objective of comparing, after the first initial year of Eylea treatment, the standard regime of 
injections every 8 weeks with alternative treatment regimes, i.e. extended treatment intervals based 
on visual and anatomic outcomes (PRN and treat-and-extend). 
This measure was considered necessary due to concerns about the optimal long term treatment 
strategy in light of the lack of comparative data for the fixed and flexible dosing regimens. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considered that the benefits of Eylea as demonstrated in clinical trials based on 
fixed dosing regimens was impacted by differences in common clinical practices, whereby more flexible 
regimens are used in the treatment of DME. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Assessment of the clinical safety of VEGF Trap in subjects with DME was mainly based on 52 week 
safety data derived from the two pivotal phase 3 studies VISTA and VIVID. These studies included a 
total of 872 randomised subjects. Both studies had a similar design (see section 2.4.2. for details on 
the study methodology) and employed three treatment arms VEGF Trap 2Q4, VEGF Trap 2Q8 and 
laser. No safety data from these studies beyond the first year of treatment was available at the time of 
this report. 
Supportive safety data were provided from 219 subjects with DME treated in the phase 2 DA VINCI 
study. 
The clinical safety of VEGF Trap for the treatment of DME was also supported by the available clinical 
safety database for AMD and CRVO. 
For data on immunogenicity, see section 2.3.3.  
Patient exposure 
•  VIVID AND VISTA: Integrated analysis 
In VIVID and VISTA studies, a total of 865 subjects constituted the safety analysis set (please refer to 
Table 7 summarising the sample size and analysis sets for details). 
Approximately 90% of subjects in all the groups completed 52 weeks of treatment. 
The majority of subjects received the planned treatment for the study eye, which represent 
13 injections in the 2Q4 group and 9 injections in the 2Q8 group. The median (mean) number of 
injections was 13 (12.0) in the 2Q4 group and 9 (8.5) in the 2Q8 group. The median duration of 
treatment was 52 weeks. 
Subjects could receive additional treatment in the study eye (VEGF Trap for laser subjects and laser for 
VEGF Trap subjects) at each visit starting with week 24 if the criteria for additional treatment were 
met. More subjects in the laser arm received additional treatment (27.9%) than in the VEGF Trap arms 
(3.4% in 2Q4 and 4.2% in 2Q8). 
Bilateral treatment 
Subjects with bilateral disease could receive anti-VEGF treatment in the fellow eye (for DME) in both 
VIVID and VISTA. In both studies, subjects received ranibizumab and infrequently, bevacizumab. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 48/79 
 
 
 
 
 
VISTA, subjects could also receive, and primarily did receive, VEGF Trap (only one subject received 
bevacizumab). In VIVID, subjects could not receive VEGF Trap. 
In VISTA, a total of 91 subjects in the laser group, 91 subjects in the 2Q4 group, and 107 subjects in 
the 2Q8 group received anti-VEGF injections (VEGF Trap or ranibizumab [if VEGF Trap was not 
available due to logistical reasons]) in the fellow eye over the course of the study. In VIVID, a total of 
32 subjects in the laser group, 36 subjects in the 2Q4 group, and 34 subjects in the 2Q8 group 
received anti-VEGF injections (ranibizumab or bevacizumab; licensed treatment preferred) in the fellow 
eye over the course of the study.  
The percentage of subjects receiving fellow eye treatment during the study across all treatment groups 
was similar (42.9% - 49.1%). In the subjects who received fellow eye injections, the median number 
of fellow eye injections across all treatment groups was 4, and the mean number of fellow eye 
injections across all treatment groups was 4.3 – 4.5. 
•  DA VINCI 
In the DA VINCI study, a total of 219 subjects received any treatment in either of the 5 study arms: 
VEGF Trap 0.5Q4; VEGF Trap 2Q4; VEGF Trap2Q8; VEGF Trap 2PRN; laser (see section 2.4.1. for 
details on the study design and sample sizes). 
The total mean exposure to VEGF Trap in terms of number of injections was 11.7, 10.8, 7.2, and 7.4 in 
the 0.5Q4, 2Q4, 2Q8 and 2PRN treatment groups, respectively.  
Adverse events  
Overall adverse events 
•  VIVID AND VISTA: Integrated analysis 
See Table 13 for an overview of the integrated analysis of adverse events in VISTA and VIVID. 
Almost all subjects (89.7% to 89.9% of subjects in each treatment group) experienced at least 
1 treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) during the first year of the study. Overall, the incidences 
of ocular and non-ocular TEAEs were similar among treatment groups (see also below). 
When compared to the VEGF Trap combined group, more subjects in the laser group reported ocular 
TEAEs in the study eye that were of greater than mild severity. The severities of non-ocular TEAEs 
were similarly distributed across the treatment groups. 
With regards to serious adverse events (SAEs), a notable difference between the groups was a greater 
frequency of study eye SAEs in the laser group than in the VTE combined group (4.2% vs. 1.7%). 
The incidences of TEAEs leading to discontinuation, study drug-related TEAEs, treatment emergent 
SAEs, and deaths were generally low.

In general, the pattern of TEAEs was similar between the pivotal studies. However, VISTA had a higher 
overall incidence of TEAEs (86.6% versus 92.6%), a higher incidence of non-ocular TEAEs (67.1% 
versus 81.6%), and a higher incidence of treatment emergent SAEs (19.1% versus 32.3%), and more 
severe TEAEs compared with VIVID. However, the incidence of study drug-related TEAEs were lower in 
VISTA compared with VIVID (1.5% versus 9.7%). 
•  DA VINCI 
Ocular and non-ocular TEAEs were reported by the majority of subjects in all treatment groups.  
The incidences of ocular and non-ocular TEAEs were similar among treatment groups. However, the 
incidence of serious ocular TEAEs in the study eye occurred at a higher frequency in the laser group 
(5/44 subjects [11%]) compared to the combined VEGF Trap groups (5/175 subjects [3%]), but the 
overall frequency was low. 
The frequencies of severe non-ocular TEAEs in any VEGF Trap group (VEGF Trap combined, 17.7%) 
were higher overall than in the laser group (11.4%), but only 2 were considered to be drug-related. 
There were few deaths and TEAEs leading to discontinuations, and they occurred at similar frequencies 
across the treatment groups. 
Ocular adverse events 
•  VIVID AND VISTA: Integrated analysis 
o  Study eye treatment 
The MAH presented a tabular overview of ocular TEAEs in the study eye occurring in ≥1% of subjects of 
any treatment group. The number of subjects experiencing at least 1 ocular TEAE in the study eye was 
higher in the laser group (64.5%) compared to the VEGF Trap 2Q4 group and 2Q8 groups (VEGF Trap 
combined 58.7%). Some adverse events were more frequent in the laser group compared to the 
combined VEGF Trap group, which could be related to the progression of diabetic retinopathy: “cystoid 
macular oedema” (3.5% versus 1.2%), “diabetic retinal oedema” (2.8% versus 0.7%), “diabetic 
retinopathy” (2.8% versus 0.3%), “macular oedema” (2.1% versus 0.3%), “retinal haemorrhage” 
(7.3% versus 3.6%), “retinal neovascularisation” (4.5% versus 0.9%), “visual impairment” (2.4% 
versus 0.9%), “vitreous haemorrhage” (3.8% versus 0.4%) and “visual acuity tests abnormal” (8% 
versus 2.6%). 
Some adverse events were more frequent in the VGEF Trap groups compared to laser and could be 
related to the injection: “conjunctival haemorrhage” (28% versus 17.4%), “eye pain” (9%vs 6.3%), 
“ocular hypertension” (2.2% versus 0%) and “increased intraocular pressure” (5% versus 3.5%). Of 
note, the fact that both VEGF Trap and sham injection procedures required sub-conjunctival 
anaesthetic injection can explain that these events were also reported in the laser group. Injection-
related TEAE were more frequent in the 2Q4 group as could be expected since the number of injections 
was higher and AEs related to the progression of diabetic retinopathy were almost similar.  
Three other adverse effects were more frequent in VEGF groups compared to laser: “increased 
lacrimation” (3.1% versus 1.7%), “vitreous floaters” (5.9% versus 3.1%) and “punctate keratitis” 
(2.9% versus 1%). 
For the VEGF Trap treatment groups, the most common ocular TEAEs in the study eye were 
conjunctival haemorrhage (28.0%) and eye pain (9.0%). For the laser treatment group, the most 
common ocular TEAEs in the study eye were conjunctival haemorrhage (17.4%) and retinal 
haemorrhage (7.3%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 51/79 
 
 
 
 
 
There were few events consistent with significant ocular inflammation or potential infection: 
iridocyclitis in 2 subjects, one in the 2Q4 group (0.3%) and one in the 2Q8 group (0.3%); uveitis in 
1 subject in 2Q4 group (0.3%), and no reports of endophthalmitis. 
The overall incidence of severe ocular TEAEs in the study eye was low and similar in the laser 
treatment group (2.8%) and the VEGF Trap 2Q4 treatment group (2.4%), but lower in the VEGF Trap 
2Q8 treatment group (1.4%). 
The overall incidence of study drug-related TEAEs was highest in the VEGF Trap 2Q4 group (8.2%) and 
lowest in the laser group (2.8%); the incidence in the VEGF Trap 2Q8 group was 4.9%. The most 
frequently reported study drug related ocular TEAEs in the study eye were intraocular pressure (IOP) 
increased, ocular hyperemia, and conjunctival haemorrhage. 
o  Fellow eye treatment 
The number of subjects experiencing at least 1 ocular TEAE in the fellow eye was consistent across all 
treatment groups (50.5% to 52.9%). For all 3 treatment groups, the most common ocular TEAEs 
(≥0%) in the fellow eye were conjunctival haemorrhage (laser, 10.5%; 2Q4, 11.0%; 2Q8, 9.4%) and 
diabetic retinal oedema (laser, 7.7%; 2Q4, 11.3%; 2Q8, 8.4%). 
•  DA VINCI 
Overall, the proportion of subjects reporting ocular TEAEs in the study eye was similar across all 
treatment groups. Most subjects reported events which were mild or moderate in intensity, as 
determined by the investigator. The 3 most commonly occurring TEAEs in the combined VEGF Trap 
groups were associated with the injection procedure (conjunctival haemorrhage, eye pain, and 
increased IOP) and occurred at a higher frequency in the combined VEGF Trap groups compared to the 
laser group. The rate of these events across the VEGF treatment groups was also consistent with the 
number of injections administered. According to the MAH, no AE trends were observed relative to dose 
or to frequency of injection. Indeed, when quadrupling the dose, no major difference in the AE profile 
was observe except for “eye irritation” (0% in laser group, 2.3% in 0.5Q4 group and 4.5% and 4.8% 
respectively in 2Q4 and 2Q8 groups). Similarly, there was no major difference in terms of AEs related 
to diabetic retinopathy progression between 2Q4 and 2Q8 groups. 
A total of 6 subjects (3%) in the VEGF Trap groups reported ocular TEAEs in the study eye which were 
judged by the investigator to be related to study drug. With the exception of eye pain and cataract, 
which were reported in 2 subjects, all other study drug-related ocular AEs in the study eye were 
reported in single subjects (ocular hyperaemia, vision blurred, vitreal cells, and citreous floaters). 
Non-Ocular adverse events  
•  VIVID AND VISTA: Integrated analysis 
The number of subjects experiencing at least 1 non-ocular TEAE was balanced between treatment 
groups. 
In 6 system organ classes (SOC), a slightly higher incidence of non-ocular TEAEs was observed in the 
VEGF Trap combined groups than in the laser group: “Blood and lymphatic system disorders” (6.2% in 
VEGF Trap groups and 4.9% in laser group), “Cardiac disorders” (10.9% in the VEGF Trap groups and 
9.4% in laser group), “Immune system disorders” (3.6% versus 1.7% in laser group) “Infections and 
infestations” (37% versus 34.8% in laser group), “Respiratory disorders”( 11.4% in laser group versus 
10.1%) and “ Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified” (4.7% versus 2. 4%). A difference in 
incidence was also observed for the preferred term (PT) “oedema peripheral”, and “glycosylated

haemoglobin increased” for which a higher incidence of non-ocular TEAEs in the combined VEGF Trap 
groups was observed compared to laser.   
The number of subjects with events in the SOCs cardiac disorders, immune system disorders, 
infections and infestations, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders was slightly higher in the 
VEGF Trap 2Q4 group compared to the laser and the 2Q8 group. 
The number of subjects with events in the SOC neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified 
(including cysts and polyps) is slightly higher in the 2Q4 group and the 2Q8 groups compared to the 
laser group. 
The number of subjects with events in the SOC investigations, musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders, renal and urinary disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders is slightly higher in the 
laser group compared to the 2Q4 and the 2Q8 group. 
For all 3 treatment groups, the most common non-ocular TEAEs were hypertension and 
nasopharyngitis and were balanced between treatment groups. 
Anaemia occurred at a higher incidence in subjects in the VEGF Trap groups compared to subjects in 
the laser group (VEGF Trap combined 4.8% versus laser 2.4%). In contrast to this, in the SOC 
“Investigations” the incidence of “haemoglobin < 115g/L (M) or 95 g/L (F)” was higher in the laser 
group (9% versus 5.2%). According to the MAH, an analysis of laboratory values for haemoglobin at 
week 24 and week 52 did not indicate an increased risk for decrease of haemoglobin values for the 
VEGF Trap groups.  
Finally, in most of the SOCs, the VEGF Trap 2Q4 group has a slightly higher incidence of events 
compared to 2Q8, especially in the SOC “Cardiac disorders”. Within this SOC the single most frequently 
reported TEAE in the VEGF Trap groups was “cardiac failure congestive”, which was reported by 15 
subjects (2.6%) in the VEGF Trap combined group versus 1 subject (0.3%) in the laser group. Most of 
the cases were observed in the VISTA study and only one was observed in VIVID.  
Other non-ocular TEAEs occurring at a slightly higher incidence in subjects in the VEGF Trap groups 
compared to subjects in the laser group included peripheral oedema (4.5% versus 2.8%); and 
pneumonia (2.6% versus 1.4%). Events which occurred more frequently in the laser group included 
hyperglycaemia (0.9% versus 3.8%), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (0.9% versus 3.1%), 
and hypercholesterolaemia (1.2% versus 3.1%). With regards to hyperglycaemia, it is noteworthy that 
the incidence of the term “blood glucose increased” in the SOC “Investigations” was higher in the VEGF 
Trap combined groups compared to laser (2.5% versus 1.7%).  
In general, the pattern of TEAEs was similar between the pivotal studies; however, the incidences of 
reported TEAEs were different. VISTA had a higher overall incidence of TEAEs, and a higher incidence 
for every SOC compared to VIVID. 
Study drug related non-ocular TEAEs occurred at a low incidence. No PT was reported by more than 
2 subjects in any treatment group. 
•  DA VINCI 
Treatment-emergent AEs in the SOCs of Investigations, Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders, 
Gastrointestinal Disorders and Cardiac Disorders occurred at a higher frequency in the combined VEGF 
Trap groups compared to the laser group. 
The difference in the SOC Investigations was primarily due to blood glucose increased, urine 
protein/creatinine ratio increased and glycosylated haemoglobin increased. For Metabolism and 
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 53/79 
 
 
 
 
 
Nutrition Disorders, the difference was primarily due to hypercholesterolaemia and conditions affecting 
glycaemic control (hyperglycaemia, diabetes mellitus). By preferred term, The difference in the SOC 
Gastrointestinal Disorders was primarily due to nausea, diarrhoea, and constipation. Finally, more 
patients in the combined VEGF Trap groups had  an event in the Cardiac Disorders SOC, primarily due 
to cardiac failure congestive and coronary artery disease. Of note, a higher proportion of subjects in 
the VEGF Trap groups had a medical history of cardiac disorders prior to entering the study (33% to 
48%) compared to the laser group (18%).  
A higher incidence for the VEGF Trap groups compared to laser was also reported for the PT terms 
“anaemia”, “blood glucose increased” and “glycosylated haemoglobin increased”. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
•  VIVID AND VISTA: Integrated analysis 
A total of 8 deaths were reported in the integrated analysis as of week 52: 5 deaths in the VIVID 
study, and 3 deaths in the VISTA study. 
In VIVID, the 5 deaths concerned 1 subject in the laser group (acute myocardial infarction) and 4 
patients in the VEGF Trap 2Q8 group (hypertensive heart disease, lung neoplasm, B-cell lymphoma, 
cardiac failure) 
In VISTA, the 3 deaths concerned 1 subject in the laser group (sudden cardiac death) and 2 subjects in 
the VEGF Trap 2Q4 group (myocardial infarction and death [etiology unknown]) 
One of the deaths, hypertensive heart disease in a 64-year old Asian male in the VEGF Trap 2Q8 
group, was judged by the investigator to be related to study drug. 
Finally, 10 other fatal cases were reported in the second year of VISTA study including 6 of 
cardiovascular origin. 
•  DA VINCI 
A total of 7 deaths were reported during the study, 6/175 subjects in the VEGF Trap groups (1 subject 
in the 0.5Q4 group with multi organ failure, 3 subjects  in the 2Q4 group with cerebral infarction, non-
small cell lung cancer, and sudden death, respectively, and 2 subjects in the 2Q8 group with renal 
failure and acute coronary syndrome, respectively) and 1/44 subject in the laser group (cardiac 
arrest). 
According to the MAH, none of the events that led to death in these subjects were judged by the 
investigator to be related to study drug or to the study procedure.  
Serious ocular adverse events 
•  VIVID and VISTA: Integrated analysis 
A total of 10 ocular adverse events were reported as serious in DME studies, including only one drug-
related SAE: IOP increased in 2Q8 group.  
The laser treatment group had the highest incidence of serious ocular TEAEs.  
The most frequently reported serious ocular TEAE in the study eye was vitreous haemorrhage (1.4% in 
the laser group versus 0.5% in VEGF Trap combined group). There were no reports of endophtalmitis.  
•  DA VINCI 
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 54/79 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, serious ocular TEAEs in the study eye were reported by few subjects but at a higher frequency 
in the laser group  compared to the combined VEGF Trap groups (5 subjects versus 3 subjects). In the 
laser group, 3 subjects reported events which were both serious and severe while only 1 subject in the 
2Q4 group reported an event that was severe and serious. According to the MAH, there were overall no 
apparent trends relative to dose or frequency of injections. Two endophtalmitis cases were reported.  
Serious non-ocular adverse events 
•  VIVID AND VISTA: Integrated analysis 
Overall, 133 serious non-ocular cases were reported. The most reported events were “cardiac failure 
congestive” (1.9% in the VEGF Trap combined groups versus 0.3% in the laser group), “anaemia” 
(2.1% in the VEGF Trap combined groups versus 0.3% in the laser group), “cellulitis” (1.7% in the 
VEGF Trap combined groups versus 0.7% in laser group) and “renal failure acute” (1.9% in the VEGF 
Trap combined groups versus 1.7% in the laser group). 
There were slightly more subjects with serious TEAEs reported for the VEGF Trap combined group 
compared to laser for the SOC “blood and lymphatic system disorders” and the SOC “neoplasm, 
benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps)”. 
There were slightly more subjects with serious TEAEs reported for the laser group compared to the 
VEGF Trap combined group for the SOC “gastrointestinal disorders”, the SOC “musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders”. 
Two AEs were assessed as drug-related: ischaemic stroke in the VEGF Trap 2Q4 group and 
hypertensive heart disease in the VEGF Trap 2Q8 group. 
•  DA VINCI 
According to the MAH, the proportion of subjects reporting serious non-ocular TEAEs was comparable 
across the treatment groups. Compared to the laser group, the VEGF Trap combined group had a 
higher incidence (by ≥1%) of congestive cardiac failure and cellulitis. 
A total of 9 AE were assessed as drug-related and occurred in 2 VEGF Trap subjects: 1 subject with 3 
events (acute myocardial infarction, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure) and 1 subject with 6 
events (nausea, vomiting, asthenia, blood pressure increased, dizziness, and hyperhidrosis). 
Arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) 
ATEs are AEs potentially related to systemic VEGF inhibition and there is a theoretical risk of ATEs 
following IVT use of VEGF inhibitors. Arterial thromboembolic events, as defined by the APTC criteria 
(Antiplatelet Trialists’ Collaboration), include non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or 
vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). 
•  VIVID AND VISTA: Integrated analysis 
The overall incidence of subjects with treatment-emergent APTC events was similar among treatment 
groups in the integrated analysis. Non-fatal myocardial infarction was more frequent in the laser 
group, while non-fatal stroke was more frequent in the VEGF Trap combined group. Vascular death was 
reported with similar frequency in all 3 treatment groups. 
•  DA VINCI 
Events were balanced among the 5 treatment groups. According to the MAH, there was no pattern 
indicating a higher risk in subjects receiving VEGF Trap.

Laboratory findings 
Chemistry 
At week 52, in subjects with no pre-defined laboratory assessment of abnormal at baseline who also 
had a valid laboratory value at week 52, the incidence of predefined laboratory abnormalities was 
generally balanced among the treatment groups. An exception was hyperglycaemia (glucose ≥11.1 
mmol/L [unfasted]), which was observed less frequently in the laser (13.1%) group than in the VEGF 
Trap 2Q4 (20.2%) and 2Q8 (23.0%) groups. This abnormality was more frequent in VISTA compared 
to VIVID. 
Hyperglycaemia was also observed in the DA VINCI study, where 19 subjects (11%) in VEGF Trap 
groups reported blood glucose increased compared to 1 subject (2%) in the laser group.  
Haematology 
At week 52, in subjects with no pre-defined laboratory assessment of abnormal at baseline who also 
had a valid laboratory value at week 52, the incidence of predefined laboratory abnormalities was 
generally balanced between the treatment groups. An exception was haemoglobin levels ≤115 g/L and 
≤95 g/L, which was observed most frequently in the laser (9.0%) group. A similar trend was seen for 
haematocrit ≤0.37v/v (male), ≤0.32v/v (female). 
In the DA VINCI study, the highest incidence of decreased haemoglobin and decrease haematocrit was 
in the VEGF Trap 2Q4 group. 
Urinalysis 
According to the MAH, no trends towards an increase or decrease in mean values over time were seen 
for the urinalysis parameter ‘specific gravity’. For total protein/creatinine ratio, the mean change from 
baseline was greater for the VEGF Trap combined group than for the laser group (25.37 mG/mMOL vs. 
7.28 mG/mMOL, respectively) but the median differences from baseline were similar (1.00 mg/mMOL 
vs. -0.50 mG/mMOL, respectively). 
Vital signs 
According to the MAH, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure were similar among treatment groups 
in the integrated analysis at baseline and varied relative to the baseline values in all treatment groups 
throughout the study, with no obvious trends over time relative to treatment or dose. 
Safety in special populations 
Sub-group analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of the following demographic and disease 
variables on safety: Gender; Baseline Age (<55 years,  ≥55 years to <65 years, and ≥65 years to <75 
years, ≥75 years ); Race (white, Asian and Black/African American); Ethnicity (hipanic and Latino); 
Geographic region (Japan, Europe & Australia, United States); HbA1c (>8% and ≤8%); Medical history 
of hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, renal and hepatic impairment. 
Overall, according to the MAH, the results of the subgroup analyses for ocular TEAEs in the study eye 
and non-ocular TEAEs were similar to those seen in the total study population. An extract of the results 
in relevant subgroups is provided below. 
Gender: The most notable difference between genders occurred in the cardiac disorders SOC, where 
men in both VTE groups had a higher frequency of serious TEAEs than women. Importantly the 
frequency of these events in the laser group was also higher for men than women. 
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 56/79 
 
 
 
 
 
Baseline age: Overall, according to the MAH, compared to the younger subgroup, the older subgroup 
did not have a higher incidence of ocular TEAEs, non-ocular AEs or ocular serious TEAEs. However, the 
older subgroup had a higher incidence of non-ocular serious TEAES and a higher incidence of APTC 
events. 
HbA1c (>8% and ≤8%): Approximately 35% of subjects had a HbA1c above 8%. Concerning non-
ocular AE, incidence of glycosylated haemoglobin increased and hypertension were higher in the 
HbA1c >8% group.  
Medical history of hypertension: Approximately 80% of subjects had a medical history of hypertension. 
Compared to subjects without a medical history of hypertension, the subjects with a medical history of 
hypertension did not demonstrate greater incidences of overall TEAEs, ocular TEAEs, non-ocular TEAEs, 
or ocular serious TEAES.  
Medical history of cerebrovascular disease: Over 88% of the subjects in the integrated analysis did not 
have a medical history of cerebrovascular disease (e.g. cerebrovascular accident/ stroke). Compared to 
the subjects without a medical history of cerebrovascular disease, the subjects with such history had in 
general a similar incidence across treatment groups of overall TEAEs and ocular TEAEs. However, the 
incidence of severe non-ocular TEAEs was higher in the VEGF Trap groups than in the laser group in 
subjects with a medical history of cerebrovascular events. 
Medical history of ischaemic heart disease: Approximately 22% of subjects had a medical history of 
ischemic heart disease. Compared to subjects without a medical history of ischemic heart disease, the 
subjects with a medical history of ischemic heart disease had similar incidences of overall TEAEs and 
ocular TEAEs. Incidences were generally balanced across all treatment groups. However, subjects with 
a medical history of ischemic heart disease, regardless of treatment group, demonstrated a higher 
incidence of non-ocular TEAEs, overall serious TEAEs (primarily driven by a higher incidence of non-
ocular serious TEAEs), and APTC events; the difference was particularly notable for the cardiac SOC. 
Medical history of renal impairment: Approximately 57% of subjects had normal renal status, and 30 
% had mild renal impairment. According to the MAH, there were no notable differences in TEAE profile 
between subgroups with normal renal function and mild renal impairment. 
Medical history of hepatic impairment: Over 95% of the subjects in integrated analysis did not have a 
medical history of hepatic impairment. According to the MAH, the subgroup that did have a medical 
history of hepatic impairment was small and therefore a comparison of subgroups would have very 
limited utility. 
•  Bilateral treatment 
The MAH analysed subjects based on bilateral anti-VEGF treatment. An increase of non-ocular AEs was 
observed in patients with fellow eye injections compared to patients without fellow eye injections 
(80.6% versus 70.3%). A difference was especially observed in the SOC “Nervous system disorders” 
(10.3% versus 14.9%) and “Vascular disorders” (15.2% versus 26.7%). 
To further explore any potential dose response of anti-VEGF treatment on the safety profile, subjects in 
the laser group in VIVID and VISTA, respectively, who received fellow eye treatment (injected 
unilaterally) were compared by the MAH to subjects in the 2Q4 and 2Q8 groups combined, who also 
received fellow eye injections (injected bilaterally). The results for subjects in the laser groups with 
fellow-eye injections were similar to those for subjects in the VEGF Trap groups with fellow-eye 
injections.

• 
Pregnancy, Lactation and Fertility 
No new data on the use of VEGF Trap in pregnant or lactating women was provided. Studies in animals 
have shown reproductive toxicity after systemic administration. 
•  Overdose/Drug Abuse/Withdrawal and rebound 
No cases of overdose, drug abuse or withdrawal and rebound were reported in the DME clinical trials.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with VEGF Trap, which was considered 
acceptable by the CHMP.  
Subjects participating in the DME clinical development program of VEGF Trap received treatment for a 
variety of diseases common to this study population including their underlying disease, diabetes; and 
also hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and cardiovascular disease. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The incidence of TEAEs resulting in discontinuation of study drug was low in the integrated analysis of 
VISTA and VIVID. Over the full 52 weeks of the studies, approximately 1% of the VEGF Trap subjects 
discontinued the studies for a TEAE; 1.4% of subjects from the 2Q4 group and 0.7% from the 2Q8 
group. Overall there were more discontinuations due to ocular TEAEs in the laser group than in the 
VEGF Trap combined group while non-ocular TEAEs were more similarly distributed across the 
treatment groups. 
Post marketing experience 
VEGF Trap has been commercially available in the United States since November 2011 and in the EU 
since November 2012, as well as in a number of other countries as of 2012.  
A total of 1761 spontaneous ADRs have been reported starting on the date of product availability in 
countries where Eylea has been commercially available through to 31 August 2013. Based upon the 
most recent publicly available sales information (by 2nd Quarter of 2013) the number of vials sold 
worldwide was estimated to be 996,742. Each vial sold is considered to represent a single drug 
administration. 
Of the 1761 spontaneous ADRs, 1444 were medically confirmed reports by health care providers 
(HCPs) and 317 were reported by non-HCPs (e.g., patients or family members). Of the 1444 HCP-
reported ADRs, 866 were serious. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical safety analysis was based on data pooled from the two pivotal phase 3 studies (VISTA and 
VIVID) during treatment year 1. Supportive safety data were available for 219 subjects with DME 
treated in the phase 2 DA VINCI study. Overall, data from 578 patients receiving IVT VEGF Trap was 
available from DME studies. This limited size did not allow detection of rare events. However, overall 
the extent of the available safety database was considered sufficient to support this application, 
considering that the clinical safety of VEGF Trap was further enriched by the available data for 
previously authorised indications, AMD and CRVO. 
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 58/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Limited information was available beyond 1 year of treatment. The CHMP considered that long-term 
data would be useful to more accurately assess the safety profile of VEGF Trap in DME. To this end, the 
CHMP considered that the submission of long-term data from the 2 pivotal trials VISTA and VIVID, 
including full reports on the 2 year data as well as the final study reports covering the full treatment 
period of 3 years, as already recommended to support long-term efficacy of Eylea (see section 2.4.3.  
and 2.4.4. ) would be sufficient. 
The overall incidence of ocular and non-ocular effects in the pooled phase 3 studies seemed to be 
similar between laser and VEGF Trap groups. However, since 27.9% of subjects in the laser group 
received additional treatment in the study eye, comparison of AE occurrence between laser and 
VEGF Trap combined groups, especially for systemic adverse events was considered by the CHMP to be 
of limited value and should be interpreted with caution. 
Overall, 6 deaths were reported in the VEGF Trap groups and 2 patients (not receiving additional 
VEGF Trap treatment) died in the laser group. Three of the 6 cases in VEGF Trap groups had a cardiac 
origin. In two cases, despite of cardiovascular medical history, which is a confounding factor, causal 
role of VEGF Trap could not be excluded. Upon request by the CHMP, the MAH performed a comparison 
of mortality rates in AMD, CRVO and DME. This analysis did not initially identify any significant 
difference (1.51%, 0% and 1.08%, respectively), but the comparison was performed based on 
different periods (1 year data for DME and 2 year data for AMD). Year 2 VISTA results revealed 
additional 10 fatal cases including 6 cases of cardiovascular origin, resulting in a higher mortality rate 
(1.38%) compared to the combined year 1 data. The CHMP recommended that additional long-term 
data, in particular year 2 data from VIVID, were provided post-approval to further investigate this 
issue. 
Bilateral treatment of VEGF Trap was received by some patients in VISTA. An increase of non-ocular 
AEs, in particular with regards to nervous system disorders and vascular disorders was observed in 
patients with fellow eye injections compared to patients without fellow eye injections (80.6% versus 
70.3%). Therefore, following a request by CHMP, bilateral treatment was added as a subcategory of 
the missing information ‘Concomitant use of different anti-VEGF therapies and other therapies for wet 
AMD, CRVO and DME’ in the risk management plan (RMP) in order to closely monitor this concern. In 
the future analysis in PSURs, the MAH should focus on cardiovascular risks and calculate odds ratios.  
Ocular TEAEs in the study eye were generally consistent with the expected adverse consequences of 
the injection procedure in the VEGF Trap groups (IOP increased, conjunctival haemorrhage, eye pain) 
or with disease progression in the laser group (macular oedema, diabetic retinopathy, retinal 
haemorrhage). Injection-related AEs were more frequent in the 2Q4 group as expected since the 
number of injections was higher. No case of endophthalmitis was reported in the two Phase 3 studies 
and two cases were reported in the Phase 2 DA VINCI study. As diabetic patients are more at risk for 
developing infections, the CHMP considered that this AE should be closely monitored in this population. 
Finally, punctuate keratitis occurred more frequently in VEGF Trap groups than in the laser group and 
was added as an ADR to SmPC section 4.8. Except for punctuate keratitis, no new ocular AE emerged 
and no increase in frequency of the already listed ADRs was identified except for cataract cortical (from 
uncommon to common) and uveitis (from rare to uncommon).  
For most of the SOCs, non-ocular TEAEs were similar between the treatment groups. The most 
common TEAEs in both treatment groups were nasopharyngitis and hypertension, which were  adverse 
events previously reported with the AMD and CRVO applications.  
In VISTA, there was a higher incidence of non-ocular TEAEs than in VIVID. The CHMP considered that 
the difference could be explained by the fact that the 2 populations were different in terms of baseline 
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 59/79 
 
 
 
 
 
characteristics. The VISTA population had more cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension and 
ischaemic heart disease) and more subjects have an unbalanced glycaemic control. 
Regarding cardiac disorders, cardiac failure congestive was reported by 15 subjects (2.6%) in the 
VEGF Trap combined group of the VISTA and VIVID studies versus 1 subject (0.3%) in the laser group. 
Most of the cases were observed in the VISTA study and only one was observed in VIVID, which may 
be due to the fact that more subjects in VISTA had an unbalanced glycaemic control than in VIVID. A 
higher incidence of this event in the VEGF Trap treatment groups was also observed in the DA VINCI 
study. As diabetic patients are at risk for developing congestive cardiac failure, this adverse event was 
of concern. However, two year data from VISTA did not show a major difference between laser (6.5%) 
and VEGF Trap combined groups (6.8%). The CHMP recommended that these data should be 
completed by year 2 data from the VIVID study, once available. 
Two different analyses of patients with medical history of ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular 
accident have been provided by the MAH which show a difference in the incidence of serious non-ocular 
TEAE compared to patient without such medical history. In the group of subjects with a history of 
ischemic heart disease, the higher incidence is mostly driven by cardiac disorder events and especially 
by events of cardiac failure congestive which is not surprising as diabetes mellitus and medical history 
of myocardial infarction are both related risk factors. With regards to cerebrovascular accident, no firm 
conclusions could be drawn as the number of patients with such medical history was limited. 
Nevertheless, the CHMP considered that the safety profile in these patients should be closely monitored 
in future PSURs. In addition, SmPC section 4.4 was updated to reflect the limited experience in the 
treatment of patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attacks or myocardial infarction. 
Concerning arterial thromboembolic events (ATE), no major difference was observed between 
VEGF Trap and laser groups. However, non-fatal strokes appeared to be slightly more frequently 
reported in VEGF Trap groups. Furthermore, 11 new ATE events were reported in the second year of 
the VISTA study (3 non-fatal MI, 5 non-fatal strokes and 4 vascular deaths). Overall, the 
interpretability and relevance of these results are limited due to the low number of events. Long-term 
data were considered to be needed in order to more accurately assess ATE occurrence. As the DME 
population has major cardiovascular co-morbidities which put them at a greater risk for developing 
ATE, ATE events were included in the RMP and will be closely monitored in the next PSUR.  
Finally, discrepancies between the reporting rates of the PTs ‘anaemia’ versus ‘haemoglobin < 115g/L 
(M) or 95 g/L (F)’ and ‘hyperglycaemia’ versus ‘blood glucose increased’ were noted. The MAH 
suggested that these apparent discrepancies arose from the fact that AEs were transferred into PT 
terms as per MedDRA coding rules as reported verbatim by the investigators. However, investigators 
are likely to have preferences for how to report a certain adverse events. Therefore, grouping of PTs 
most likely referring to a similar medical condition, was considered adequate and no safety issue arose 
when such grouping was done. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In conclusion, the safety profile of VEGF Trap in DME appeared to be similar to the known profile in 
AMD and CRVO. Overall, the extent of the available safety database supporting this application was 
considered acceptable, however, it was noted that the size was too limited to detect rare adverse 
events. Moreover, the safety analysis was mainly based on 1 year data and long term data were 
considered necessary to complement the safety evaluation post-authorisation. Data from the 2 pivotal 
trials VISTA and VIVID, including full reports on the 2 year data as well as the final study reports 
covering the full treatment period of 3 years, were considered by the CHMP to be sufficient to address 
this concern.  
Assessment report

Page 60/79 
 
 
 
 
 
2.5.4.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. However, in future PSURs, the occurrence of arterial 
thromboembolic events as well as the safety profile in patients with medical history of ischemic heart 
disease and cerebrovascular accident should be closely monitored. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
2.6.1.  PRAC advice 
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan. 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 16.0, the PRAC considers by 
consensus that the risk management system for aflibercept (Eylea) in the treatment of  
•  Neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in adults 
•  Visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) 
and the proposed indication of 
•  Diabetic macular oedema (DME) in adults 
was acceptable. Some deficiencies were noted, which should be addressed with the next RMP update. 
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

- Section 4.2 Posology and methods of 
administration: 
The pre-filled syringe contains more than the 
recommended dose of 2 mg. The extractable 
volume of the syringe (90 microlitres) is not 
to be used in total. The excess volume should 
be expelled before injecting. Injecting the 
entire volume of prefilled syringe could result 
in overdose. To expel the air bubble along 
with excess medicinal product, slowly depress 
the plunger to align the cylindrical base of the 
dome plunger with the black dosing line on 
the syringe (equivalent to 50 microlitres i.e. 
2 mg aflibercept). 
- Section 4.9 Overdose: 
In clinical trials doses of up to 4 mg in 
monthly intervals have been used and 
isolated cases of overdoses with 8 mg 
occurred. Overdosing with increased injection 
volume may increase intraocular pressure. 
Therefore, in case of overdose intraocular 
pressure should be monitored and if deemed 
necessary by the treating physician, 
adequate treatment should be initiated.

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. The changes in SmPC sections 4.1, 
4.2 and 4.4 are shown below (additions highlighted in bold, deletions shown as strike-through). For all 
other changes, see full product information. 
•  SmPC section 4.1 
Eylea is indicated for adults for the treatment of  
o  neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (see section 5.1), 
o  visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion 
(CRVO) (see section 5.1), 
o  visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) (see section 5.1). 
•  SmPC section 4.2 
Diabetic Macular Oedema 
The recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg aflibercept equivalent to 50 microlitres.  
Eylea treatment is initiated with one injection per month for five consecutive doses, 
followed by one injection every two months. There is no requirement for monitoring 
between injections.  
After the first 12 months of treatment with Eylea, the treatment interval may be extended 
based on visual and anatomic outcomes. The schedule for monitoring should be determined 
by the treating physician.

Systemic effects 
Systemic adverse events including non-ocular haemorrhages and arterial thromboembolic events have 
been reported following intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors and there is a theoretical risk that 
these may relate to VEGF inhibition. There are limited data on safety in the treatment of 
patients with CRVO or DME with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attacks or 
myocardial infarction within the last 6 months. Caution should be exercised when treating 
such patients. 
Other 
As with other intravitreal anti-VEGF treatments for AMD and, CRVO and DME the following also 
applies: 
o  The safety and efficacy of Eylea therapy administered to both eyes concurrently have not 
been systematically studied (see section 5.1). 
o 
(…) 
o  There is limited clinical data with Eylea in patients with diabetic retinopathy. 
Populations with limited data 
There is only limited experience in the treatment of subjects with DME due to type I 
diabetes or in diabetic patients with an HbA1c over 12% or with proliferative diabetic 
retinopathy. 
Eylea has not been studied in patients with active systemic infections or in patients with 
concurrent eye conditions such as retinal detachment or macular hole. There is also no 
experience of treatment with Eylea in diabetic patients with uncontrolled hypertension. This 
lack of information should be considered by the physician when treating such patients. 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Eylea 40 mg/ml solution for injection in a vial (as 
submitted and endorsed with the previous extension of indication application for CRVO). The bridging

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Efficacy of VEGF Trap in DME was supported by two phase 3 controlled studies (VISTA and VIVID), 
each comparing 2 different dosing regimens of VEGF Trap [2mg every 4 weeks (2Q4) and 2mg every 8 
weeks after initial 5 monthly doses (2Q8)] against laser photocoagulation. In addition, supportive data 
were obtained from a phase 2 study (DA VINCI). The phase 3 studies were designed to primarily 
demonstrate superiority of VEGF Trap over laser photocoagulation with regard to vision and 
morphological outcomes after 52 weeks (1 year) of treatment. Overall, the CHMP considered that the 
study design was acceptable including a study population representative of a clinically significant 
macular oedema state with a reasonable chance of oedema improvement. Laser was considered an 
adequate control as it was the current standard of care at the time of the DME clinical development 
program. 
In both phase 3 studies, Eylea was superior to laser treatment in the improvement of best-corrected 
visual acuity (BCVA) assessed by the ETDRS chart in subjects at week 52 compared to baseline. The 
mean difference (least squares) between the two VEGF treatment groups and laser in the integrated 
analysis of both studies was 9.9 letters and 10.8 letters for 2Q8 and 2Q4, respectively, which was 
statistically significant and a clinically relevant gain in vision. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the 
robustness of the statistical results of the primary analysis. The superiority of treatment with VEGF 
Trap was further supported by all visual and anatomic secondary outcomes including categorical gains 
of ≥15 letters in BCVA, which were reported in 31.1% to 41.6% of subjects in the VEF Trap 2Q4 and 
2Q8 groups, respectively, compared to 8.4% in the laser group across both studies. This improvement 
in visual acuity represents a doubling of visual angle which is considered perceptible by patients. 
Patients treated with VEGF Trap also had a greater reduction in central retinal thickness of 
about -130μm compared to laser.  
Indirect comparison of historical data showed a similar range of improvements for ranibizumab. 
Both treatment regimens tested were efficacious, however, since both the 2Q4 and 2Q8 groups had 
very similar outcomes at year 1 and since the 2Q8 dosing regimen achieved these improvements with 
fewer median injections (9 injections) compared to 13 injections for the 2Q4 group, the 2Q8 regime 
was considered by the CHMP to be the most appropriate regime at least for the first year of treatment. 
Subgroup analyses in the defined efficacy subgroups (age, gender, race, baseline HbA1c, baseline 
BCVA, and prior anti-VEGF therapy) generally supported the results in the overall populations.  
Finally, both year 2 data from VISTA and data from the 6 month off-drug follow-up period in DA VINCI 
confirmed maintenance of the beneficial treatment effects beyond year 1. A continued regimen of 
injections every 8 weeks (2Q8) was sufficient to maintain the improvements in vision achieved during 
study year 1 in VISTA throughout year 2.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 72/79 
 
 
 
 
 
For historical reasons, the clinical development program of Eylea in DME did not employ ranibizumab 
as direct comparator, since Lucentis had not been approved for use in DME at the time when the 
program started. Therefore, no definitive conclusion on potential differences between the two 
anti-VEGF inhibitors could be drawn from the available data.  
Only few patients recruited in the clinical trials had type I diabetes mellitus and only 8 patients had a 
baseline HbA1c > 12%. The limited experience in these patient groups have been reflected in section 
4.4 of the SmPC. 
Limited information was available on the benefit of treatment in patients with macular ischemia. 
Reports in the scientific literature had suggested that anti-VEGF-treatment may reduce visual acuity in 
these patients. However, no such trend was observed from the limited available data from VIVID. 
Nevertheless, the CHMP requested that events of reduced visual acuity in DME patients with macular 
ischaemia should be monitored in future PSURs. 
Patients recruited in the two phase 3 studies, VISTA and VIVID, differed in some baseline 
characteristics. The differences in baseline disease characteristics suggested that subjects in VISTA 
may have had DME of a more refractory nature, particularly since the proportion of subjects who had 
received prior anti-VEGF treatment was 4 times higher in VISTA. Despite these differences, and while 
the magnitudes of the effects varied, generally consistent treatment effects were observed across the 
studies, suggesting that Eylea will be effective across the range of patients requiring treatment. 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC has been amended to reflect relevant differences between the two studies. 
Supportive literature for the relevance of the DRSS endpoint to the indication of DME and of the 
relevance of the effect size have not been provided. In addition, for a quarter of the patients in VIVID 
the DRSS status was not gradable. Furthermore, results for the quality of life endpoints did not show a 
clear benefit of VEGF Tap treatment over laser. However, the outcome of the NEI-VFQ-25 score is 
based on visual acuity in both eyes, has a high variability and takes into account the overall health 
state of patients, which might explain why the clinical benefits did not appear to translate in a useful 
improvement of the management of current daily activities. 
As treatment benefits were mainly supported by 1 year data, uncertainties remained regarding the 
long-term management of DME with Eylea which had not been fully explored. The available data from 
VISTA and DA VINCI beyond year 1 provided some assurance on the persistence of the beneficial 
treatment effect. However, at the time of this report only a summary of the key efficacy results at 
year 2 in VISTA were available in addition to data from the 6 month off-drug follow-up period of 
DA VINCI. Therefore, the CHMP recommended submission of the full 2-year reports as well as the final 
clinical study reports of both studies, once available. 
Furthermore, both phase 3 trials only studied fixed dosing regimens and no information could be 
derived from the available data on the required duration of treatment or stopping criteria. 
Nevertheless, the vision gain achieved during year 1 in the DA VINCI study was relatively well 
maintained during the 6 month off-drug follow-up period whereas only a fifth of the patients received 
additional treatments in form of mainly anti-VEGF agents and laser. Therefore and in light of the 
published data for ranibizumab, a treat-and-extend approach based on visual and anatomic outcomes 
was considered more suitable for the maintenance therapy of DME with Eylea after the first year. 
However, the CHMP was of the opinion that it was essential to collect additional comparative data for 
the 2Q8 regimen and other alternative dosing regimens (PRN and treat-and extend) commonly used in 
clinical practices in the management of DME in order to confirm the benefits of the selected treatment 
regime in the long-term management of DME. Such data should be collected in a post-authorisation 
efficacy study following the first initial year of Eylea treatment also exploring criteria for ceasing

treatment if no longer required. It was considered that a suitable study design would be a randomised 
non-inferiority study of a duration of at least 2 years (following the first treatment year) and interim 
study results should be provided after the first study year. 
Finally with regards to non-responders, analyses of the efficacy outcomes in three potential groups of 
non-responders, defined by change from baseline in BCVA, were inconclusive due to the low number of 
subjects, in particular with regards to the two most meaningful groups (those losing or not gaining 
vision). Still, in order to avoid unnecessary treatment of patients not benefitting from continued 
therapy, the CHMP agreed to recommend discontinuation of Eylea if visual and anatomic outcomes 
indicate that the patient is not benefiting from continued treatment. 
Risks  
The safety analysis was mainly based on the integrated data of one year data from VISTA and VIVID 
with 578 DME patients exposed to Eylea treatment. Safety data for DME patients were furthermore 
supplemented by supportive data from DA VINCI.  
Overall, the safety profile of Eyea in DME appeared to be consistent with the known profile in the 
already approved indications AMD and CRVO. A similar overall incidence of ocular and non-ocular 
effects was observed when comparing Eylea with laser photocoagulation. 
The most common ocular adverse reactions reported were conjunctival haemorrhage, increased 
intraocular pressure and eye pain, which were related to the injection procedure. Punctuate keratitis 
occurred more frequently in VEGF Trap treatment groups and has been added to section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. Except for this adverse event, no other new ocular adverse events emerged and regarding 
listed effects, no increase in frequency was identified except for cataract cortical (from uncommon to 
common) and uveitis (from rare to uncommon). Overall, intravitreal injections of VEGF Trap were well 
tolerated, irrespective of the frequency of injection. 
The most common non-ocular treatment-emergent adverse events were nasopharyngitis and 
hypertension, which had already been reported in AMD and CRVO studies.  
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, including immunogenicity data, showed a low systemic 
exposure and a low immunogenicity in DME patients consistent with what has been observed in 
previous clinical programs with AMD and CRVO patients.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The size of the clinical DME safety database was limited precluding detection of rare adverse events. 
Moreover, the safety review was mainly based on exposure data of one year of treatment. Long-term 
safety data, i.e. data beyond the first year of Eylea treatment, were limited and only available for 
VISTA at the time of this report. Therefore, the safety evaluation needs to be completed by a critical 
discussion about additional events observed in 2 year and 3 year periods, when the related results are 
submitted for review by CHMP.  
A comparison of the mortality rates after VEGF Trap treatment in AMD, CRVO and DME indications was 
performed to further explore a potential higher risk of deaths in patients treated for DME with anti-
VEGF treatment. However, complete 2 year safety data for VIVID were considered necessary to 
confidently refute an increased risk.

Moreover, non-fatal strokes seemed to be slightly more frequently reported in VEGF Trap treatment 
groups compared to laser. Due to low number of patients, no firm conclusions could be drawn. As the 
DME population has major cardiovascular co-morbidities which put them at a greater risk for 
developing arterial thromboembolic events, these events were included in the RMP and should be 
closely monitored in the next PSUR. 
Finally, the adverse event of congestive heart failure was more frequently reported in VEGF Trap 
groups in year 1 of in the clinical trials. As diabetic patients are at risk for developing congestive 
cardiac failure, this adverse event was of concern. However, 2 year data from VISTA did not support a 
signal of cardiac failure congestive as hardly any difference was observed during this period. 
Nevertheless, the CHMP was of the opinion that data needed to be completed by full 2 and 3 year data 
from the pivotal trials. 
Benefit-risk balance  
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
No new safety concerns were identified for Eylea other than punctuate keratitis when administered to 
patients with DME, whereas a significant superiority in term of efficacy over laser photocoagulation has 
been demonstrated at week 52 in both on-going pivotal studies.  
Improvement in vision and anatomical outcome measures were consistent and statistically significant 
as well as clinically relevant. In particular, in addition to the primary efficacy analysis, responder 
analysis in patients gaining ≥15 letters in visual acuity provided convincing evidence of a relevant 
treatment effect. The treatment effect was further confirmed in sensitivity and subgroup analyses, 
which suggested that Eylea is effective across the range of patients requiring treatment. 
Limited data beyond treatment year 1 provided some evidence of maintenance of efficacy.  
The safety profile of Eyea in DME was generally consistent with the known profile in the already 
approved indications AMD and CRVO. Uncertainties remained with regards to the risk of arterial 
thromboembolic events and congestive heart failure in the population of DME patients due to the 
limited availability of long-term safety data and taking into account that diabetes patients have major 
cardiovascular co-morbidities and are at risk of developing thromboembolic complications.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall, the CHMP considered that the benefits of Eylea in the treatment of DME in adult patients 
outweighed the treatment related risks in both dosing regimens tested.  
Based on the lower number of injections and consequently lower risk of injection related adverse 
events, the 2Q8 regime was considered the most appropriate regime for the first year of treatment. 
Thereafter, it was considered more suitable to gradually extend the treatment interval in responders 
based on visual and anatomic outcomes. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
While a positive benefit-risk profile of Eylea in the treatment of DME was shown for the first treatment 
year, long-term data were limited and additional data should be provided post-approval to confirm 
maintenance of efficacy and complement the safety database. To this end, the CHMP recommended 
that full 2-year and 3-year results of VIVID and VISTA should be submitted for review by CHMP. 
Furthermore, the CHMP was of the opinion that it was essential to collect additional comparative data 
Assessment report  
EMA/430291/2014  
Page 75/79 
 
 
 
 
 
for the 2Q8 regimen and other alternative dosing regimens commonly used in clinical practices in the 
management of DME in order to confirm the benefits of the selected treatment regime in the long-term 
management of DME. To this end, the CHMP requested a randomised post-marketing study with the 
primary objective of testing non-inferiority of the 2Q8 regimen with other alternative dosing regimens 
(PRN and treat-and-extend). The study should also aim at identifying criteria for ceasing treatment if 
no longer required and should be started as soon as possible.  
In conclusion, the CHMP considered the following measures necessary to address issues related to 
long-term efficacy: 
The MAH should perform an interventional post-authorisation efficacy study in patients with diabetic 
macular oedema with the primary objective of comparing, after the first initial year of Eylea treatment, 
the standard regime of injections every 8 weeks with alternative treatment regimens, i.e. extended 
treatment intervals based on visual and anatomic outcomes (PRN and treat-and-extend). The protocol 
should be submitted for review within 2 months following approval of this application. Interim and final 
study data should be provided for review. Adequate non-inferiority margins should be applied. 
4.  Recommendations 
The application for approval of Eylea in the treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic macular 
oedema is approvable since all concerns have all been resolved. 
Final Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following changes: 
Variation requested 
Type 
C.1.6 a) 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
II 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one 
Extension of indication to add a new indication for the treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic 
macular oedema. As a consequence, updates of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 in order to add 
dosing recommendation for DME patients, update the safety information and provide a summary of 
relevant clinical data in DME. SmPC section 4.8 was furthermore updated to introduce a joint summary 
of the safety profile across all indications. Finally, Annex II was updated to reflect the revised 
conditions with regard to the safe and effective use. Minor editorial changes and corrections were 
made as well. The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet for France. 
The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II and Package Leaflet. 
This CHMP recommendation is subject to the following new condition:  
Interventional post-authorisation efficacy study in patients with diabetic macular oedema with the 
primary objective of comparing, after the first initial year of Eylea treatment, the standard regime of 
injections every 8 weeks with alternative treatment regimens, i.e. extended treatment intervals based 
on visual and anatomic outcomes (PRN and treat-and-extend).

Page 78/79 
 
 
 
 
 
Scope 
Extension of indication to add a new indication for the treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic 
macular oedema. As a consequence, updates of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 in order to add 
dosing recommendation for DME patients, update the safety information and provide a summary of 
relevant clinical data in DME. SmPC section 4.8 was furthermore updated to introduce a joint summary 
of the safety profile across all indications.  
Summary 
Upon review of the data of two phase 3 clinical trials as well as one supportive phase 2 study 
investigating the safety and efficacy of Eylea in the treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic 
macular oedema, the CHMP considered that Eylea had been shown to improve vision and reduce 
macular oedema in a relevant patient population in a significant and clinically meaningful manner. The 
safety profile remained largely unchanged and the benefit-risk balance was considered favourable.

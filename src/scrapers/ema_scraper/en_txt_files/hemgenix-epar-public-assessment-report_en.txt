1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant CSL Behring GmbH submitted on 7 March 2022 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Hemgenix, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The 
eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 21 April 2017.  
Hemgenix, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/18/1999 on 21 March 2018 in the 
following condition: Treatment of haemophilia B. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Hemgenix as an orphan medicinal product in 
the approved indications. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the orphan 
maintenance assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/Hemgenix 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Treatment of adults with Haemophilia B (congenital Factor IX deficiency) and with a preexisting 
neutralising anti-AAV5 antibody titre below 1:700 to reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes and the 
need for Factor IX replacement therapy who: 
• currently use Factor IX prophylaxis therapy, 
• or have current or historical life-threatening haemorrhage or repeated, serious spontaneous bleeding 
episodes. 
1.2.  Legal basis and dossier content  
The legal basis for this application refers to: 
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that etranacogene dezaparvovec was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies. 
1.3.  Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0380/2022 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0380/2022 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity

orphan medicinal products. 
1.5.  Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
1.5.1.  Accelerated assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. 
1.5.2.  Conditional marketing authorisation 
During the assessment, the applicant requested consideration of its application for a conditional 
marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation. 
1.5.3.  New active substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance etranacogene dezaparvovec contained in the above 
medicinal product to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
1.5.4.  Scientific recommendation on classification 
The applicant CSL Behring GmbH submitted on 7 March 2022 an application for scientific 
recommendation on classification to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Hemgenix, which was 
designated as an advanced therapy medicinal product on 21 April 2017.  
1.6.  PRIME 
Hemgenix was granted eligibility to PRIME on 21 April 2017 in the following indication: treatment of 
severe haemophilia B. 
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time in view of the following: 
- the unmet need may be acknowledged in particular on the basis of breakthrough bleeds and the 
development of bleeding sequelae such as haemophilic arthropathy;  
- the potential to address the need can be accepted on the basis of preliminary clinical observations in 
patients with FIX activity ≤ 2% of normal;  
- in the study presented a single IV administration resulted in a sustained increase in factor IX activity, 
allowing for interruption of prophylactic treatment for the majority of treated patients.  
Upon granting of eligibility to PRIME, Ilona G. Reischl was appointed by the CAT as rapporteur. 
A kick-off meeting was held on 03 October 2017. The objective of the meeting was to discuss the 
development programme and regulatory strategy for the product. The applicant was recommended to 
address the following key issues through relevant regulatory procedures:  
- CHMP scientific advice on quality and non-clinical aspects including the overall comparability strategy 
to support changes in manufacturing and the formulation.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication of Hemgenix (etranacogene dezaparvovec) is the treatment of adults with 
haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency) and with a pre-existing neutralising anti-AAV5 antibody 
titre below 1:700 to reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes and the need for Factor IX replacement 
therapy who: 
• currently use factor IX prophylaxis therapy, 
or 
• have current or historical life-threatening haemorrhage or repeated, serious spontaneous bleeding 
episodes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 10/149 
 
 
 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Congenital haemophilia B is an X-linked inherited bleeding disorder, almost exclusively in males, 
characterised by an increased bleeding tendency due to either a partial or complete deficiency of the 
essential blood coagulation FIX. The deficiency is the result of mutations of the respective clotting 
factor genes. Approximately 1 in 20,000 to 50,000 live male newborns have haemophilia. 
Based on historical classification using functional FIX levels, approximately one-third of individuals 
have a severe disorder characterised by functional FIX levels < 1% of normal, approximately one-third 
of individuals have moderate haemophilia B, with 1 to 5%, and approximately one-third of individuals 
have mild haemophilia B with > 5 to < 40% of normal FIX levels [White, et al, 2001]. 
However, individuals may exhibit a severe bleeding phenotype irrespective of their FIX level, including 
individuals with current or historical repeated spontaneous bleeding episodes (which may include joint 
or life-threatening haemorrhage), established joint damage due to haemarthroses, and / or the current 
use of factor IX continuous prophylaxis. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Haemophilia B is an inherited bleeding disorder characterised by an increased bleeding tendency due to 
either a partial or complete deficiency in the activity of the essential blood coagulation factor IX. 
Haemophilia B is an X-linked, recessive condition, and occurs primarily in males. Females are typically 
carriers with a mild or absent bleeding phenotype. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
Intra-articular and intramuscular bleeding is a major clinical manifestation of the disease. Bleeding 
most commonly occurs in the knees, elbows, and ankles. The pathogenesis of haemophilic arthropathy 
is multifactorial, with changes occurring in the synovium, bone, cartilage, and blood vessels. Recurrent 
joint bleeding causes synovial proliferation and inflammation (haemophilic synovitis) that contribute to 
end-stage degeneration (haemophilic arthropathy); with pain and limitation of motion severely 
affecting patients’ quality of life (QoL) [Knobe and Berntorp, 2011]. The severity of bleeding 
manifestations generally correlates with the degree of the clotting factor deficiency. Severe forms 
become apparent early in life [Srivastata et al, 2020]. 
2.1.5.  Management 
There is no cure for haemophilia B. The primary goals of haemophilia B therapy are the prevention of 
bleeding episodes, rapid and definitive treatment of bleeding episodes (breakthrough bleeding 
episodes) that occur even while on a regular prophylactic regimen and provision of adequate 
haemostasis during surgery and emergencies. Currently, these goals are essentially met for 
haemophilia B subjects by intravenous (IV) injections of commercially available recombinant- or 
plasma-derived FIX products, either at the time of a bleeding episode (on-demand) or by regular 
infusions up to several times a week (prophylactically). The recent approvals of extended half-life FIX 
products allow for reduced frequency of factor administration (once every 7 to 14 days) and 
maintenance of a higher FIX trough level. 
The current treatment options for haemophilia B have several limitations. Treatment with prophylactic 
regular IV injections of FIX is not curative and very demanding due to the need for frequent IV 
infusions and concomitant risk for infection and thromboses related to the placement of indwelling 
catheters. Periodic or regular FIX infusion result in peaks and troughs in plasma factor levels allowing 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 11/149 
 
 
 
for breakthrough bleeding episodes. Due to these factors, poor adherence to treatment is a concern 
and a major contributing factor to failure of prophylaxis, associated with increased risk of bleeding and 
subsequent joint damage, thereby adding to the all-cause morbidity and mortality rate. 
There is also a risk of developing neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against the administered FIX. The 
burden of the disease is high, both for the individual subject and their families, and for society. Due to 
(long-term) impairments in mobility and functional status, subjects may not be able to fully participate 
in social activities, such as sports, school, or work. Living with haemophilia can have a substantial 
effect on mental wellbeing, particularly among young people and signs of major depressive disorder 
are not uncommon. The economic burden for the society is significant. 
2.2.  About the product 
Etranacogene dezaparvovec is a gene therapy medicinal product that employs a non-replicating, 
recombinant adeno-associated virus-based vector serotype 5 (AAV5) containing a codon-optimised 
coding DNA sequence for the human coagulation Factor IX variant R338L (FIX-Padua) under the 
control of a liver-specific promoter (LP1). 
Etranacogene dezaparvovec is produced using recombinant baculovirus technology. 
Etranacogene dezaparvovec is delivered by a single intravenous dose and is designed to achieve 
prolonged expression of active human FIX in the plasma, synthesised from vector-transduced liver 
tissue. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The CHMP and CAT agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered  to  be  of  major  public  health  interest.  This  was  based  on  Hemgenix  ability  to  induce 
endogenous  factor  IX  expression  and  to  provide  patients  with  a  more  physiological  mode  of  factor 
replacement without the need for a chronic infusion/ injection therapy. This ultimately could represent a 
curative option for patients besides the current substitution treatment. 
However, during assessment the CAT and CHMP concluded that it was no longer appropriate to 
maintain accelerated assessment, in view of the outstanding Major Objections. The timetable was 
switched to standard. 
During the assessment, the applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional 
Marketing Authorisation in accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on 
the following criteria: 
• 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. By way of specific 
obligations, the applicant committed to provide the final CSRs for the ongoing studies CT-
AMT-061-01 and CT-AMT-061-02 for the entire study duration (ie, 5 years) and will provide 
the requested 1 year interim analysis report with the first 50 patients enrolled in Study 
CSL222_4001. 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as although satisfactory methods of treatment of the 
condition exist in the European Union, the applicant has provided sufficient justification for the 
assumption that Hemgenix will be of major therapeutic advantage to those affected by the 
condition. The product has a mechanism of action that offers the potential to reduce or 
eliminate the use of exogenous factor IX products currently authorised for the condition, and 
Assessment report

the non-clinical data provided demonstrate significant improvement of circulating factor IX 
protein and activity levels in valid models of the condition. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. The applicant claimed that making Hemgenix available 
to patients while the collection of comprehensive efficacy and safety data will be ongoing is 
not expected to represent a risk to public health.  
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Hemgenix is a gene therapy medicinal product designed to introduce a copy of the human Factor IX 
(FIX) coding DNA sequence into hepatocytes to address the root cause of the haemophilia B disease. 
Hemgenix employs a non-replicating, recombinant adeno-associated virus-based vector serotype 5 
(AAV5) containing a codon-optimised coding DNA sequence for the human coagulation Factor IX 
variant R338L (AAV5-hFIXco-Padua) under the control of a liver-specific promoter (LP1). The active 
substance etranacogene dezaparvovec is produced using recombinant baculovirus technology. 
Hemgenix is presented as a concentrate for solution for infusion in single-use Type I glass vial 
containing 1 × 1013 genome copies (gc)/mL of etranacogene dezaparvovec. Each vial contains an 
extractable volume of 10 mL of concentrate for solution for infusion, containing a total of 1 x 1014 
genome copies. The total number of vials in each pack corresponds to the dosing requirement for the 
individual patient, depending on the patient’s body weight (recommended single dose of 2 x 1013 gc/kg 
body weight corresponding to 2 mL/kg body weight). 
The active substance is formulated with sucrose, polysorbate-20, potassium chloride, potassium 
dihydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, disodium phosphate, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) 
and water for injections. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
Etranacogene dezaparvovec consists of a human FIXco-Padua (hFIXco-Padua) expression cassette, 
which is packaged within a recombinant AAV5, and administered by intravenous infusion into patients. 
The hFIXco-Padua expression cassette contains a codon-optimised coding DNA sequence encoding the 
R338L variant of human factor IX (FIX Padua) under the control of the liver-specific promoter LP1. In 
the liver, the vector transduces liver cells without genome integration, and vector DNA remains almost 
exclusively in episomal form. 
The amino sequence of the hFIX-Padua protein is described. Structure and general properties are 
briefly but sufficiently described.

2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturing process and process controls 
Etranacogene dezaparvovec active substance is manufactured at uniQure, Inc., 113 Hartwell Avenue, 
Lexington, MA 02421-3125, USA. All sites involved the manufacture, controls and storage of the active 
substance comply with EU GMP. 
Etranacogene dezaparvovec is produced using the Baculovius Expression Vector System (BEVS) that 
utilises an insect cell line derived from Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells. The BEVS is composed of 
different recombinant baculoviruses, which serve to deliver the essential components to produce AAV 
containing the Padua variant of human factor IX gene (hFIX-Padua) in the producer cells. The 
etranacogene dezaparvovec active substance manufacturing process is divided in upstream and 
downstream process.  The upstream process (USP) consists of production of etranacogene 
dezaparvovec by baculo-virus infection and purification using established biotechnology procedures.  
The downstream process consists of a harvest and clarification step, followed by several purification 
steps ending with formulation and final fill.  
The manufacturing process steps have been described in a high-level flow diagram as well as in more 
detailed flow charts and narratives for respective process steps.  
Control of materials 
The starting materials for manufacture of etranacogene dezaparvovec active substance consist of an 
insect cell line (derived from Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells) and purified recombinant baculoviruses. 
The development and characterisation of the master cell bank (MCB) and working cell banks, as well as 
cells at the limit of age (CALs) are described. The produced seed viruses have been adequately 
characterised. The testing strategy of the seed viruses is compliant with Ph. Eur. 5.14.  
Sufficient information on raw and starting materials used in the active substance manufacturing 
process has been submitted. Information on materials of biological origin and testing was sufficiently 
presented. The testing panel for future cell banks and virus seeds is acceptable taking into account the 
commitment of the applicant (Recommendation 2). 
The stability programme for seed and cell banks is acceptable taking into account the commitment of 
the applicant (Recommendation 3). 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Control of critical steps and process material is achieved using process parameter controls and in-
process testing. In-process testing is presented, the methods are described, and justification is 
provided for the defined limits and acceptance criteria. The selection of in-process tests is acceptable. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates is considered appropriate. 
Process validation  
The process validation (PV) strategy employs a 3-stage risk-based approach to the process validation 
lifecycle: Stage 1, Process Design, Stage 2, Process Performance Qualification (PPQ), and Stage 3, 
Continued Process Verification (CPV). PV/PPQ was performed to demonstrate that the process, when 
operated within the defined ranges, produces active substance that consistently meets all IPCs, IPSs, 
and release specifications. 
The PV/PPQ was performed at commercial scale at uniQure’s Lexington MA facility in the USA, which is 
a qualified facility for the manufacture of etranacogene dezaparvovec active substance. All equipment, 
utilities, and facilities were qualified prior to use in the PV/PPQ. 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 14/149 
 
 
 
The information provided on the additional validation studies (media fill studies, filter validation, 
shipping validation) in general give no reason for concern, taking into account the commitment of the 
applicant (Recommendation 8). Levels of process and product-related impurities are controlled by 
active substance release specification. In addition, in the characterisation section of the dossier, data 
of clearance of process-related impurities has been provided for PPQ batches. 
Throughout the lifecycle of the product, a statistical evaluation of the data will be performed to 
demonstrate that the process remains in a validated state of control (CPV). The applicant committed, 
as part of the ongoing CPV programme, to analyse data from all commercial batches at a regular 
frequency to ensure process performance and the process control strategy (PCS) are appropriate to 
ensure product quality (Recommendation 4).  
Manufacturing process development 
Manufacturing Process 
Production of the active substance including site transfer and scale up activities has been adequately 
described. The comparability assessment was performed. The comparability studies include comparison 
of process performance, active substance and finished product batch release results and extended 
characterisation. 
Process Control Strategy 
Identification of critical quality attributes (CQAs) is based on regulatory requirements and a risk 
assessment for severity and uncertainty regarding safety/immunogenicity, potency/efficacy, and 
pharmacokinetics. Quality target product profile (QTPP), clinical/non clinical, structure/function, 
characterisation data, and prior knowledge (including scientific literature and platform knowledge from 
other programs) were utilised in the risk assessment. Routine testing (in-process or release) is 
performed for all CQAs either at active substance or finished product or both stages. Commercial PCS 
has been established based on a scientific and risk-based approach taking into consideration the 
process experience gained from clinical manufacturing and PV/PPQ activities. Process parameters 
(input) and process attributes (output) have been defined for each step of the manufacturing process 
and their criticality has been assessed based on the risk to impact CQAs.  
The manufacture of clinical batches was controlled by action and alarm limits, which is considered the 
preliminary PCS. Prior to commencing PV/PPQ a review of the preliminary PCS was performed and 
proven acceptable ranges (PARs) and normal operating ranges (NORs) were assigned. Development of 
the PCS also included a late-stage failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA). Process parameter and 
process attribute ranges (PAR, NOR) are based either on manufacturing experience, data from 
previously manufactured batches, data from process development/characterisation studies, process 
parameter validation studies, vendor provided operational limits, or equipment and facility capabilities.  
Overall, validation results showed that although NORs are very wide for some parameters, the data 
obtained with PV/PPQ batches are not that different.  
Characterisation 
Elucidation of structure 
Etranacogene dezaparvovec active substance has been extensively characterised using different 
methods focused on capsid and vector identity and composition, biophysical characterisation, post-
translational modifications (PTM), and biological activity.  
Impurities 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 15/149 
 
 
 
Impurities that are present or potentially present in the etranacogene dezaparvovec active substance 
were properly analysed. The levels of these impurities are below the assay limit of detection, or are low 
enough not to pose any risk to patient safety. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
Specification 
Specification for the active substance includes control of identity, purity and impurities, biological 
activity and other general tests. 
The established release specifications cover most of the relevant characteristics of AAV vectors. They 
are in line with the Reflection paper on quality, non-clinical and clinical issues related to the 
development of recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (EMEA/CHMP/GTWP/587488/2007 Rev. 1) 
and Ph. Eur. 5.14. Gene transfer medicinal products for human use. A recommendation has been 
included based on the applicant’s commitment to developing and incorporating a release assay, 
proposing to introduce the method as a release test as a post-approval variation (Recommendation 
10).  
Analytical procedures  
In general, the analytical methods used for release testing of the active substance are correctly 
described and validated taking into account the commitment of the applicant (Recommendation 11).   
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis is in general well presented. Batch-to-batch consistency is in general met. 
Reference standards  
The product derived primary reference standard (PRS) used for active substance batch release and 
stability testing is the same as for finished product testing. The in-house reference standards or 
materials used for process and product-related testing of impurities of active substance release and 
stability testing are well described and acceptable. 
Container closure 
The container closure system is sufficiently described. The container closure system is considered 
adequate for etranacogene dezaparvovec active substance. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Stability studies of active substance involve commercial and historical batches. The tested parameters 
include relevant quality attributes for potency, strength, purity and general quality attributes that are 
considered stability indicating. Overall, the proposed shelf life is acceptable taking into account the 
commitment of the applicant (Recommendation 12).  
The study protocol for the stability data, based on long-term, accelerated and stressed conditions, is 
well designed. Photostability studies have been provided for the finished product.

2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Description of the product 
Etranacogene dezaparvovec is a preservative-free, liquid formulation with a nominal concentration of 
1x1013 genome copies (gc)/mL and is formulated in a sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution, 
pH 7.1 containing sucrose and polysorbate-20 (PS-20). For pH adjustment of the buffer, small 
amounts of hydrochloric acid compliant to compendial standards are used. 
The excipients used in the etranacogene dezaparvovec finished product are qualitatively and 
quantitatively the same as in the active substance. The excipients comply with Ph. Eur. No novel 
excipient is used. 
Hemgenix is supplied as a 10 mL solution (strength 1 x 1013 genome copies/mL) in a single-use Type I 
glass vial with stopper (chlorobutyl rubber), aluminium seal with a flip-off cap. 
The total number of vials in each finished pack corresponds to the dosing requirement of the individual 
patient, depending on the body weight, and is provided on the package.  
The excipients used in etranacogene dezaparvovec finished product comply with Ph. Eur. requirements, 
are commonly used in the manufacturing of parenteral pharmaceutical preparations and are thus 
considered acceptable.  
No overage or overfill is included for the etranacogene dezaparvovec finished product. 
The applicant identified the key physicochemical properties of the active substance that might affect 
finished product performance. Compatibility of active substance with the excipients of the finished 
product was demonstrated. 
Pharmaceutical development 
Details on the formulation development have been provided in the dossier and the formulation 
development of etranacogene dezaparvovec finished product is considered appropriately described. 
The finished product container closure system consists of a depyrogenated 10 mL Type I glass vial, a 
stopper made of chlorobutyl rubber and an aluminium seal with a flip-off cap. Representative diagrams 
and information on the critical dimensions of the components are presented. The glass vial and rubber 
stoppers comply with USP and Ph. Eur. requirements.  
All container closure components are received ready-to-use (sterile). Information on the sterilisation of 
the container closure is provided as outlined in EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015. 
The suitability of the container closure system was adequately evaluated. The compatibility between 
etranacogene dezaparvovec finished product and the primary container closure materials as well as 
absence of adsorption of the AAV to the glass vial / stopper is demonstrated. Extractables and 
leachables have been appropriately addressed. Overall, the choice of container is considered 
appropriate, and based on the currently available data from the simulation studies and from the 
components’ suppliers, the safety risk of extractables and leachables from manufacturing of 
etranacogene dezaparvovec finished product is considered acceptable taking into account the 
commitment of the applicant (Recommendation 16).  
Assessment report

Microbiological attributes 
No preservative has been added to the preparation. As terminal sterilisation is not appropriate for this 
type of product, sterility is assured during manufacture by aseptic practices and in-line filtration with 
sterilising grade filters. In-process testing includes a bioburden test at different steps of product 
manufacture. Final sterility testing is performed in compliance with USP<71> and Ph. Eur. 2.6.1. 
Container closure system components are tested for sterility by the supplier and prior to release for 
use in finished product manufacture. 
The microbial ingress test is part of the aseptic process simulation. 
Stability studies do not indicate any incompatibility issues. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturers 
 All sites involved in manufacturing, controls and storage of the finished product operate in 
accordance with EU GMP. 
The applicant requested an exemption from re-testing upon importation into the EU. The lack of 
detailed justification for such request was initially raised as a Major Objection. During the procedure, 
the applicant agreed to propose a staggered approach to transfer release testing to the EU within a 
defined timeframe. This is considered acceptable (Recommendation 1). 
The proposed batch size and batch formula for minimum and maximum batch sizes are appropriately 
provided. The batch numbering system has been described. 
Manufacturing process 
The manufacturing process for etranacogene dezaparvovec finished product is described in the dossier 
and consists of 1) formulation buffer preparation, 2) thawing of the active substance, 3) sterile 
filtration and finished product compounding, 4) fill and finish, 5) visual inspection and bulk vial storage 
and 6) labelling, packaging and finished product storage.  
In general, the description of the etranacogene dezaparvovec finished product manufacturing process 
is considered sufficient and acceptable. Hold times have been verified through process validation. 
Each process parameter has been classified as key, critical or non-critical. Proven acceptable ranges or 
acceptance criteria have been established for each parameter. The applicant states that the 
classification of the manufacturing process variables was performed in accordance with internal policies 
and procedures. Acceptable ranges for process controls were determined using manufacturing data, 
process development reports, validation reports, stability study reports or vendor recommendations. 
Process validation 
The etranacogene dezaparvovec finished product manufacturing process was validated at the proposed 
commercial manufacturing site. Based on a risk-based approach three consecutive finished product 
batches meeting all PV/PPQ acceptance criteria were manufactured to validate the manufacturing 
process. The process validation strategy included a 3-stage risk-based approach to the process 
validation lifecycle; Stage 1 was a process design phase, process qualification was performed as Stage 
2, and Stage 3 is a continued process verification programme. The validation studies included also

Additional Process Qualification Evaluations: Mixing Performance Qualification, Process Simulation 
Testing, Sterilizing Filter Validation and Shipping Validation. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
Specifications 
Specification for the finished product includes control of identity, purity and impurities, biological activity 
and other general tests. 
Except for the tests for subvisible particles, extractable volume, and sterility, which are tested only for 
finished product, (and capsid protein identity as well as DNA and protein composition, and product and 
process related impurities tested only for active substance), the test items are identical for active 
substance and finished product. The applicant provided a justification for each proposed specification 
acceptance criteria including batch analysis results, statistical considerations, and consideration of non-
clinical and clinical aspects where applicable. 
Overall, the proposed specification is considered adequate to ensure finished product quality taking into 
account the commitments of the applicant (Recommendations 13, 14, 15).   
Analytical procedures 
See active substance. Analytical methods specific to the finished product are compendial. 
Reference standards 
Four reference standards have been used throughout the development of etranacogene dezaparvovec 
finished product. The results of the qualification and characterisation of all four reference standards are 
appropriately provided. The protocol / acceptance criteria for the qualification of future reference 
materials have not been provided. Therefore, a variation procedure is foreseen before a new reference 
standard can be taken into use.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analyses data is appropriately provided in the dossier for historical and commercial batches. 
Characterisation of impurities 
The applicant conducted a risk assessment for elemental impurities in accordance with ICH Q3D guideline 
showing that there are no concerns. It is concluded that the risk is low and it is not necessary to include 
any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. This is acceptable. 
A risk assessment regarding the potential presence of N-nitrosamines impurities in the active substance 
and  finished  product  was  provided  during  the  procedure,  as  requested  (Major  Objection).  This 
assessment concludes the risk is low and as a consequence there is no demonstrated need for testing 
either  active  substance  or  finished  product  for  the  presence  of  N-nitrosamines.  This  conclusion  is 
endorsed. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The applicant proposed a 24-month shelf-life based on 24 months of stability data at long-term storage 
conditions. The applicant has performed stability studies in accordance with the ICH Q5C guideline. 
Stability studies were performed on batches representative of the commercial finished product with 
respect to manufacturing process and container closure system. Some of these batches were used in 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 19/149 
 
 
 
 
clinical studies. The finished product batches were stored at long-term storage and at accelerated 
storage conditions. 
Stability studies have been performed at the long-term storage condition (5°C ± 3°C) and at the 
accelerated condition. Forced degradation studies and photostability studies have also been performed. 
The container closure system and the filled volume used for stability samples are identical to the final 
finished product. 
To evaluate the stability-indicating capability of the analytical methods, a forced degradation study was 
performed. The results support the stability-indicating capability of selected analytical assays. 
A photostability study was performed. The results indicated that the finished product is light-sensitive 
in primary packaging and that the proposed secondary packaging is effective in protecting the finished 
product from photodegradation. 
Considering the totality of the data, the acceptable shelf life for Hemgenix is 24 months (2°C-8°C) 
protected from light. 
In-use stability studies are discussed in the dossier and confirm that once diluted with sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, Hemgenix can be stored at 15°C-25°C in the infusion bag 
protected from light. However, the administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec dose to the patient 
should be completed within 24 hours after the dose preparation. The stability after dilution was 
established for polyethylene/polypropylene (PE/PP) copolymer, polyvinyl chloride (PVC)-free infusion 
bags with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. 
2.4.3.5.  Post-approval change management protocol(s) 
A post-approval change management protocol (PACMP) was submitted to introduce a process change 
in the active substance manufacturing process. The general approach proposed by the applicant was 
considered acceptable in general, additional recommendations were provided to the applicant during 
the procedure. However, the applicant decided to withdraw the PACMP. 
2.4.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
Non-Viral Adventitious Agents 
Microbial safety of etranacogene dezaparvovec against non-viral adventitious agents including 
mycoplasma, mycobacteria, spiroplasma, bacteria and fungi is considered sufficiently assured through 
testing of raw materials, cell banks and virus seeds together. 
With regards to TSE, four materials of biological origin have been identified by the applicant: 
Certificates of suitability (when relevant) or TSE statements have been provided, assuring the TSE 
safety of these four materials.  
Foetal bovine serum (FBS) was used in the preparation of pre-Master Seed Viruses. Certificates of 
suitability from EDQM were provided. 
FBS and recombinant insulin were used at some point during the development of the MCB by the 
supplier of the cells which was stopped after 1992/1993. The applicant provided sufficient evidence 
that the producer cells pose a negligible TSE risk. This conclusion can be endorsed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 20/149 
 
 
 
Viral Adventitious Agents 
The control strategy for viral adventitious agents is performed at several levels: selection of raw 
materials, testing of starting materials for viral adventitious agents, testing of process intermediates at 
appropriate stages, and the inclusion of steps in the manufacturing process with virus reduction 
capacity. 
With respect to the four raw materials of biological origin used in manufacturing, no risk of virus 
contamination was concluded based on their origin and/or their manufacturing process.  
Two materials of biological origin were also used in the generation of the cell banks and the viral 
seeds. The manufacturing process of those materials is expected to inactivate viruses, although no 
proof of this has been presented. FBS used in the generation of the starting seed viruses was shown to 
be free from relevant bovine viruses.  The approach of a risk assessment and testing or relevant 
viruses identified demonstrated freedom from viral contamination. Equally, viral seeds were also tested 
for viral contamination.  
Another control layer is the testing of crude harvest and active substance. Testing occurs with indicator 
cell lines.   
A virus risk assessment was performed to assess the risk of exposure by patients to adventitious 
agents which confirms a negligible risk. In summary, viral adventitious agents are considered 
sufficiently controlled at several levels (raw materials, cell banks, seed viruses and manufacturing 
process) allowing assurance of viral safety for the final product. 
Overall, adventitious agents safety is considered sufficiently assured. 
2.4.3.7.  GMO 
Hemgenix contains genetically modified organisms (GMOs). See Non-clinical section Ecotoxicity / 
environmental risk assessment. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality dossier submitted for etranacogene dezaparvovec (Hemgenix) is generally well organised 
and provides an adequate description of the active substance and finished product, the manufacturing 
procedure and the control strategy defined to ensure a consistent production of the active substance 
and finished product of acceptable quality.  
All the issues raised during the procedure have been resolved, but several Recommendations are 
made, some of them based on commitments proposed by the applicant. 
The applicant applied for an exemption from retesting upon importation into the EU. The provided 
justification was not considered sufficient (Major Objection). In their response, the applicant agreed to 
commit to a staggered approach to transfer the analytical test methods to EU GMP-certified testing 
laboratories within a defined timeframe as per presented plan for the transfer of methods for finished 
product release testing in the EU (Recommendation 1). 
Recommendations are introduced for the introduction of testing of PCVs for future MCB and MSV and to 
provide remaining stability data for a WCB lot after testing within a defined timeframe 
(Recommendations 2 and 3). 
A major objection was initially raised regarding the adequacy of the process control strategy to 
guarantee consistency of the product. The applicant responded to this objection with additional details 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 21/149 
 
 
 
on the process control strategy and several commitments to track process performance to confirm the 
process control strategy adequately assures consistent product quality. The applicant was requested to 
include in the CPV programme an analysis of the upstream infection step, and of the performance of 
two purification steps (Recommendations 4, 5 and 6). In addition, the applicant is recommended to 
estimate the range of MOI used for each batch based on the actual titre of infectious baculovirus. In 
view of the results obtained, the possibility of establishing an acceptance criterion MOI for better 
control of the infectious steps should be explored (Recommendation 7). The applicant also 
committed to perform formal hold time validation studies to collect additional data for extended hold 
times. Submission of the hold time validation study results will occur in terms of a post-approval 
variation procedure for extension of intermediate hold times. This applicant’s commitment is included 
in the list of recommendations (Recommendation 8).  
Regarding the characterisation and control of the active substance, the applicant committed to 
complete the experiments to purify and functionally characterise and to incorporate a release assay for 
the purity attribute, proposing to introduce the method as a release test as a post-approval variation 
(Recommendations 9 and 10). In addition, the revised method validation report for a release assay 
for process related impurities (Recommendation 11) and additional results for active substance 
batches on stability are to be provided post-approval (Recommendation 12).  
Regarding control of the finished product, the applicant committed to further revise the acceptance 
limits for some specification parameters once data from new finished product commercial batches are 
available (Recommendations 13 and 14). Additional commitments have been made to introduce a 
release method for the attribute purity and to update the leachable study results (Recommendations 
15 and 16).  
The applicant also committed to provide the GMP certificates for testing sites once available 
(Recommendation 17) (no pre-approval GMP inspection was required and these sites are included in 
the EMA re-inspection programme and subject to regular GMP inspections post-approval). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall quality of Hemgenix is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
documentation comply with existing guidelines.  
In conclusion, based on the review of the data provided, the marketing authorisation application for 
Hemgenix is considered approvable from the quality point of view. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical 
and biological aspects as described above. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CAT recommends the following points for investigation: 
Description 
1.  The applicant commits to transfer the analytical methods and release testing to EU testing 
laboratories using a staggered approach. All finished product release testing should be

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical development programme was initiated with AMT-060, which has a similar vector 
backbone as etranacogene dezaparvovec (AMT-061), but lacks the 2-nucleotide change in the hFIX 
coding sequence (enhancing the FIX activity of Padua FIX variant). A comprehensive set of 
pharmacology, biodistribution, and toxicology studies has been performed in mice and non-human 
primates (NHPs, in cynomolgus or rhesus macaques) to assess FIX expression and activity, 
biodistribution pattern, shedding, and safety including analysis of genome integration and paternal 
germline transmission of vector DNA. The pivotal biodistribution and toxicology studies were GLP-
compliant. The IV route of administration was used in all non-clinical studies to mimic the intended 
clinical route of administration. The etranacogene dezaparvovec batches used in the non-clinical safety 
testing were representative of the final product used in clinical phase 2b and 3 studies. AMT-060 and 
etranacogene dezaparvovec were similar in terms of transduction efficacy, hFIX transcription and 
translation efficacy, biodistribution pattern and safety. Up to 4 to 6-fold higher FIX clotting activity was 
noted with etranacogene dezaparvovec administration in comparison to equal doses of AMT-060 in 
mice and monkeys. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In support of the MAA of etranacogene dezaparvovec a range of non-clinical in vivo pharmacodynamic 
studies was conducted in wild-type mice, haemophilia B mice (B6.129P2-F9tm1Dws; mice deficient for 
murine factor IX protein/activity) and cynomolgus monkeys. These studies were conducted with AMT-
060, the initially developed product, as well as etranacogene dezaparvovec (AMT-061), a vector that 
bears the Padua-variant of FIX exhibiting higher clotting activity per unit FIX protein. PD endpoints 
were largely incorporated in biodistribution and toxicity studies and hFIX expression was followed up 
for up to 18 months after administration. 
A proof of concept study (NR-060-11-007) was conducted employing AMT-060 and AAV5(92)-LP1-
hFIXco, a predecessor thereof as a positive control, dosed from 1.0 x 1012 to 5 x 1012 gc/kg 
(AAV5(92)-LP1-hFIXco 2.5 x 1012 gc/kg only) to 15 weeks old male C57Bl/6 mice. After a 4-week 
observation period vector DNA and hFIX mRNA were detected at dose-dependent amounts in the livers 
of the mice. In addition, and also in a dose dependent fashion, hFIX protein was detected in murine 
plasma.

For the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of AMT-060 in a disease model, FIX knockout, B6.129P2-
F9tm1Dws mice that express minimal levels of endogenous FIX protein were administered 5x1011, 5x1013 
or 2.3x1014 gc/kg AMT-060 (NR-060-13-007). Endogenous FIX protein levels ranged from 6-18% of 
normal. Four weeks after administration concentrations of hFIX protein were detectable in a dose-
dependent manner. In line with hFIX protein also FIX clotting activity increased with increasing doses 
(11-33%, 644-2280% and 1760-4780% of normal human plasma). Good correlation of hFIX protein 
levels and clotting activity was observed. 
In order to follow transgene expression for a time period of up to 18 months, normal C57Bl/6 mice of 
different ages (neonates – 2 days old, weanlings – 3 weeks old, young adults – 6 weeks old and adults 
– 11 weeks or 6 months old) were dosed 2.3x1014 gc/kg AMT-060 and sacrificed at 18 months of age 
(NR-060-14-008). Human FIX protein was detectable in all age groups already 4 weeks after vector 
administration and throughout the entire study period. Neonatal mice had continuously low hFIX 
protein levels of less than 10% of normal and even less from 6 months after administration (around 
4%). Weanlings had relatively stable hFIX protein levels of 748% of normal after 4 weeks with a 
moderate decrease over time to 269%. Adult mice with 6 weeks of age and older had in common a 
steep increase of hFIX protein levels of between 3316 and 5294% of normal which subsequently 
declined but remained stable at a level of around 1000% of normal until the end of the study period.  
In order to investigate the effect of co-medication with prednisone, which is a potential scenario for the 
clinical setting, a single-dose toxicity and biodistribution study was conducted in normal C57Bl/6 mice 
that also included PD parameters, i.e. measurement of hFIX protein levels (NR-060-14-002). Mice 
received single doses of 5.0x1011, 5.0x1013, 2.3x1014 gc/kg or 2.3x1014 gc/kg plus 1 mg/kg prednisone 
three times per week. Human FIX protein levels were measured 8, 28, 90 and 180 days after 
administration and followed a dose-dependent pattern. Of note, hFIX was reduced to the level of the 
5.0x1013 dosing group in the group that received 2.3x1014 gc/kg plus 1 mg/kg prednisone, whereas 
vector DNA levels in the livers of both 2.3x1014 gc/kg groups were comparable. 
In the scope of a combined toxicity and biodistribution study in wild-type mice three doses of AMT-060 
and AMT-061 (5x1011, 5x1012, 5x1013 gc/kg, all formulated with 0.02% PS-20) were additionally 
compared with respect to hFIX protein levels, as well as chromogenic and clotting activity (NR-061-18-
002). In addition, in the high dose group AMT-060 and AMT-061 formulated without PS20 were 
included. Overall, no difference in hFIX protein levels was detected within one dosing level irrespective 
of the formulation. Only in the 5x1011 gc/kg dosing group AMT-061 appeared to be lower than in the 
AMT-060 group, however, standard deviations were very high in that group. With regard to FIX 
chromogenic and clotting activity, AMT-061 exhibited a 3- to 4-fold and 5- to 6-fold activity, 
respectively. No difference was determined between different formulations at the same dose level. 
Thus, it can be concluded that based on equal hFIX levels the activity of AMT-061 is clearly higher as 
compared to AMT-060. 
A comparative in vivo analysis was performed with five AMT-061 batches that differed with regards to 
their in vitro potencies covering a range from 0.4-1.9 RU (NC-RPT-00006). Male wild-type mice were 
administered doses of 5x1011, 5x1012 and 5x1013 gc/kg of each batch. Levels of hFIX protein as well as 
FIX activity appeared to be dose dependent and did not point towards differences in in vivo potency. 
Similarly, vector DNA levels in the livers varied dose-dependently and no consistent differences 
between batches were determined. Thus, differences in potency observed in vitro did not translate to 
in vivo potency or were blurred by differences in actual drug product concentrations as compared to 
nominal ones and varying transfection efficiencies within the 15 animals of each dosing group. 
Nevertheless, it can be concluded that despite up to almost 5-fold differences in in vitro potency, all 
batches produced a clear dose-related PD effect comparable within each dosing level.

Administration of a single dose of 5x1012 gc/kg AMT-060 to adult male cynomolgus monkeys resulted 
in hFIX protein expression for at least 13 weeks with an initial peak of up to 18% of normal human 
levels 1 week after administration and stabilisation of the protein level at about 5% of normal human 
levels (NR-060-12-003). Thirteen weeks after dosing the average vector DNA level was 1.3×106 gc/μg 
DNA and average hFIX mRNA was 5×104 copies/μg RNA. 
In the scope of a biodistribution and toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys the relationship between 
AMT-060 dose and circulating protein was analysed (Study NR-060-14-010). Monkeys (n=3 per dosing 
group) received doses of 5x1011, 5x1012, 2.5x1013 or 9.3x1013 gc/kg. Blood was collected regularly 
through week 26 and hFIX levels were determined by ELISA. Human FIX protein levels followed a 
similar pattern in all dose levels, i.e. an initial peak around day 8 after infusion and a more or less 
pronounced decrease (highest decrease in the middle dose levels) thereafter with stabilisation of the 
levels from about 8 weeks after administration up to the end of the study period at week 26. A clear 
dose dependence was observed with respect to hFIX levels ranging from 0.3% of normal human levels 
in the lowest to 15% in the highest dosing group. Whereas hFIX levels were relatively similar in all 
animals of the same dosing group for mid and low doses, two animals in the high dose group 
experienced a significant drop in levels from 31.3% and 23.9% to 4.9% and 0.5%, respectively. In 
correlation with the decline in hFIX levels, the respective animals were demonstrated to have 
developed anti-hFIX antibodies. Of note, only animals without pre-existing anti-AAV5 antibodies were 
included in the study. However, post-hoc analysis of the NHP sera with a more sensitive method 
revealed that all monkeys had neutralizing anti-AAV5 antibodies, which appeared not to have an effect 
on transduction or at least did not hinder efficient transduction. This was also demonstrated by 
correlating anti-AAV5 antibody titres with vector DNA levels in the livers and plasma hFIX levels. 
In order to compare the PD properties of AMT-060 and AMT-061, doses of 5x1012 (AMT-060) and 
5x1011, 5x1012 2.5x1013, 9x1013 (AMT-061) gc/kg, respectively, were administered to cynomolgus 
monkeys (NR-061-17-001). All dose levels except for the highest and second highest AMT-061 dose 
produced an initial peak of hFIX protein with subsequent decrease and stabilisation until the end of the 
study period after 26 weeks or 13 weeks for the 5x1011 gc/kg group. In animals of the highest dose 
group protein levels increased until week 8 after administration followed by only little decrease 
thereafter. In the 2.5x1013 gc/kg group a second peak was observed at week 8 catching up with the 
highest dosing group with only one drop at the 24 week observation point. Both 5x1012 dosing groups 
performed equally in terms of hFIX levels. Human FIX activity was assessed by an one-stage aPTT and 
a chromogenic assay. As monkey FIX activity cannot be distinguished from that of hFIX, the baseline 
activity in monkeys was determined before administration of AMT-060 or AMT-061 and found to be 
around 50% of normal human levels. Overall, FIX activity analysed with either of the two assays was 
dose-related and correlated in general well with hFIX protein levels for the AMT-061 groups and 
reached up to 400% of normal human levels in the highest dose group. The dose of 5x1012 AMT-060 
gc/kg resulted in no to very low FIX activity on top of baseline levels. In this group, a drop in FIX 
activity was observed after week 8 after administration. This drop in activity correlated with the 
incidence of anti-hFIX antibodies in one out of three animals of this dosing group. Comparison on an 
individual basis also revealed an inversely related correlation between hFIX-specific antibodies and 
hFIX protein levels. Of note, as the incidence of anti-hFIX antibodies occurred preferably in the 2x1013 
gc/kg group (two out of 3 animals), no correlation to the dose administered appears to exist. 
Two commercial assays, a chromogenic assay and a FIX-specific aPTT test, were set up for their use 
with mouse or monkey plasma. The criteria for assay validation are considered fulfilled for both assays 
and the assays are, thus, regarded suitable for the measurement of FIX activity in the preclinical 
species employed.

2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No studies on secondary pharmacodynamics have been conducted which is acceptable considering the 
nature of the product and its mode of action. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology endpoints were included in the toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys with AMT-
060 and AMT-061. With regard to ECG readings no effects related to the test article were observed 
with AMT-060. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
In order to assess potential effects of prednisone treatment that is applied in patients that develop 
transaminitis secondary to transfection of hepatocytes, mice that were dosed with 2.3 x 1014 gc/kg 
were co-administered with 1 mg/kg prednisone 3x per week (NR-060-14-002). While vector DNA levels 
of prednisone-treated mice were comparable to those in mice that did not receive co-medication, hFIX 
protein levels were reduced upon prednisone treatment. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics assessment of etranacogene dezaparvovec and AMT-060 were incorporated in 
pharmacodynamics and toxicological studies conducted in mice and non-human primates. An additional 
study on paternal germline transmission was conducted in male mice treated with AMT-060. This latter 
study is discussed in detail in the toxicology section of this report. 
Pharmacokinetic studies focused on biodistribution, shedding and persistence of etranacogene 
dezaparvovec and AMT-060 in mice and NHPs.  
Methods of analyses included assessment of vector DNA and vector-derived mRNA with qPCR and RT-
qPCR, hFIX protein, anti-hFIX antibodies, and activity in mouse and monkey matrices. All assays were 
fit to purpose. Activity was assessed by two methods; activated partial thromboplastin time (aPPT) and 
chromogenic assays both measuring the total FIX activity (including vector-derived and endogenous 
activity). Anti-capsid AAV5 antibodies were assessed at pre-dose (screening) and at 25 weeks post 
treatment in monkeys. 
The assays were validated according to recent guidance and in compliance to GLP when necessary, 
bridging validation was conducted to confirm comparability for the detection of AMT-060 and 
etranacogene dezaparvovec using the same method. 
Dedicated studies on absorption were not conducted. This is acceptable with regard to this type of 
gene therapy medicinal product. 
Biodistribution of AMT-060/etranacogene dezaparvovec was investigated as part of various PD and 
toxicological studies conducted in mice and NHP. The selection of tissues for biodistribution analysis 
differed between studies, but the following list was collected in all pivotal, GLP-compliant studies in 
mice and cynomolgus macaques: liver, adrenal glands, brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, lymph nodes, 
muscle, pancreas, salivary glands, spleen, thymus, thyroid, testes, epididymis, seminal vesicles, and 
prostate. To inform on clearance/shedding of the vector DNA, plasma or serum, urine, saliva, and 
semen samples were collected from cynomolgus macaques treated with either AMT-060 or 
etranacogene dezaparvovec. Vector DNA in plasma was also evaluated in mice.

In the non-GLP compliant study NR-060-11-007, distribution of AMT-060 to the liver was assessed in 
C57Bl/6 mice. Mice were dosed IV up to 5.0×1012 gc/kg body weight. This resulted in dose-dependent 
transduction of the liver, with liver vector DNA mean measured to be 8.0x104±6.9x104 at the highest 
dose tested. 
In the non-GLP study NR-060-14-008, newborn, juvenile and adult male C57Bl/6 mice were dosed IV 
with a dose of 2.3×1014 gc/kg of AMT-060 at an age of either 2 days (neonatal), 3 weeks (weanling), 6 
weeks (juveniles), 11 weeks (adult), or 6 months (aged) old to study long-term persistence of liver 
vector DNA. Data revealed long-term persistence of vector DNA in the liver of mice treated at the 
various ages listed above. However, animals treated at 6 weeks and older showed higher DNA levels 
four weeks after administration than neonatal mice and weanlings (1-2 log lower DNA levels). After 18 
months DNA vector levels were approximately one log lower than the levels measured four weeks after 
treatment, with exception of animals dosed at day 2, which showed a 2-log reduction. However, vector 
DNA was still detectable in all age groups’ liver samples. 
In the GLP-compliant studies NR-060-14-002 and NR-060-13-006, biodistribution of AMT-060 to liver 
and off-target tissues was determined after a single IV injection to male mice with a 26-week follow-up 
period. AMT-060 was dosed up to 2.3×1014 gc/kg, with a second high dose group receiving prednisone 
as co-treatment (3x/week, 1 mg/kg) to see if co-administration could alter biodistribution. 
Tissue and blood samples were collected on day 8 and day 180 after dosing. Vector DNA was detected 
in all tissue samples tested in the high dose group. The highest levels of vector DNA were measured in 
the liver on both time points tested, followed by lung and spleen (levels within one log compared to 
liver on day 8, but >1 log on day 180). DNA levels on day 180 decreased in all tissues when compared 
to levels found on day 8. Prednisone treatment did not show a significant impact on biodistribution or 
DNA levels in this study. 
In the GLP study NR-061-18-002, male mice received a single IV dose of either etranacogene 
dezaparvovec or AMT-060 in different formulations (with and without PS-20), followed by a 13-week 
follow-up period, to support direct comparison between the two products and differences in 
formulations. Biodistribution of the two vectors to liver and off-target tissues was determined at three 
dose levels (5x1011, 5x1012, 5x1013 gc/kg). 
Vector DNA in plasma decreased from 1010 copies/ml on day 1 post-dose to 104 copies/ml after 13 
weeks and levels were comparable between the two products and formulations. Distribution of vector 
DNA to the liver increased dose-dependently and no differences were observed between the same dose 
levels of the two products. 
Vector DNA was further detectable in all off-target tissues tested with highest concentrations found in 
adrenal glands, heart, kidney, and spleen. With the exception of the adrenal glands, vector DNA levels 
in off-target tissues were ~100-fold lower than in the left liver lobes. Again, no significant differences 
were observed between AMT-060 and etranacogene dezaparvovec. The addition of PS-20 to the 
formulation did not impact on biodistribution. 
In the non-GLP studies NR-060-12-003 and NR-060-11-009, biodistribution to the five liver lobes of 
rhesus macaques was investigated after single IV administration of AMT-060 at a dose of 5×1012 gc/kg 
with a 90-day recovery period. Homogenous distribution of vector DNA was observed among the liver 
lobes in all treated animals. 
In the GLP-compliant study NR-060-14-010, biodistribution of AMT-060 was determined after single IV 
dosing of male cynomolgus monkeys dosed up to 9.3x1013 gc/kg, followed by a 26-week investigation 
period. Additionally, vector DNA delivery and transgene expression in liver (non-GLP; NR-060-14-006) 
and off-target tissues (non-GLP; NR-060-14-011) were investigated in these animals.

Blood was collected to determine vector DNA levels in serum. Secretion and excretion of the vector 
DNA was measured in saliva and urine. Fluid samples were taken at pre-dose, at week 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 
and 26. Semen samples were collected on day 180. At necropsy 19 different tissues were collected for 
vector DNA analysis by validated qPCR. Four liver lobes were analysed. The hFIX mRNA analysis by RT-
qPCR was conducted on a selection of tissues based on vector DNA levels returned by qPCR. 
Vector DNA levels in serum, saliva and urine decreased over time, with serum showing the highest 
concentrations at all time points measured. Vector DNA levels were below LOD after week 8 in saliva 
and urine. Low levels of vector DNA were detectable in the highest dose group’s semen samples, 
whereas in the lower dose group levels were close to the LOD. 
All animals showed dose-dependent, homogenous and comparable distribution of vector DNA among 
their liver lobes. Dose-dependency was also observed in all other tissues investigated. In the highest 
dose group (9.3×1013 gc/kg) similar levels were detected in the liver and adrenals, followed by the 
spleen, 26 weeks after dosing. In all other tissues, DNA levels were >1 log lower than in the liver. 
However, in accordance with the liver-specific promoter, hFIX mRNA levels were highest in the liver 
and correlated with the vector dose. All other tissues examined (including adrenal glands and spleen) 
showed mRNA expression below the LLOQ. 
In the GLP-compliant study NR-061-17-001, biodistribution of etranacogene dezaparvovec, directly 
compared to AMT-060, was determined after single IV dosing of male cynomolgus monkeys dosed up 
to 9.3x1013 gc/kg, followed by a 13 to 26-week observation period. 
Vector DNA levels in serum decreased at a bi-phasic rate. The plasma half-life (t½) at the dose 
(2.5×1013 gc/kg) closest to the recommended human dose was determined to be around 25 days, with 
comparable plasma curves found between etranacogene dezaparvovec and AMT-060. Low levels of 
vector DNA were detected after 6 months in all dose groups except the lowest one, while DNA 
shedding to urine was only detectable until 3 months post dose. 
Biodistribution occurred to all tissues tested, with liver again showing the highest levels as already 
observed in previous studies. Highest off-target levels (>1 log lower than in liver) were detected in 
adrenal glands and spinal cord (with the latter not tested in previous study). Liver concentrations 
measured for etranacogene dezaparvovec showed dose-dependency and etranacogene dezaparvovec 
and AMT-060 showed similar levels for the compared dose groups in all organs and tissues. 
hFIX mRNA levels in the liver showed dose-dependency and were comparable for etranacogene 
dezaparvovec and AMT-060. mRNA at low levels was also detectable in adrenal glands, although 
estimated to be 30-65-fold lower than in liver at similar vector DNA levels. At the highest dose 
administered low levels of mRNA around the LLOQ were moreover detectable in the spleen, kidney, 
spinal cord and heart samples of some animals. Altogether, these data support the liver-specific 
promoter of the construct. Low levels of off-target expression have also been demonstrated for other 
AAV-mediated gene therapies with transgene expression regulated by tissue-specific promotors 
(Prasad 2011). However, expression around LLOQ in other tissues is not expected to be associated 
with adverse effects. 
Transduction of liver cells was estimated to be between 17-46 percent, depending on the dose 
administered, using FISH. Again, no significant differences between etranacogene dezaparvovec and 
AMT-060 were observed. 
Overall, data on the biodistribution of etranacogene dezaparvovec and AMT-060 did not reveal 
unexpected/adverse findings on tissue distribution of the vector DNA or mRNA expression thereof. The 
vector DNA biodistribution, transduction and hFIX mRNA expression profiles were comparable between 
AMT-060 and etranacogene dezaparvovec at equal dose of 5×1012 gc/kg. The AUCs were 3.7×1010, 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 29/149 
 
 
 
and 3.76×1010 gc × hr/mL for AMT-060 and etranacogene dezaparvovec, respectively. While most off-
target tissues showed detectable levels of the vector DNA, liver presented the highest levels in all 
studies conducted, with mRNA measurements confirming the liver-specificity of the promoter used. 
Both, vector DNA levels as well as mRNA levels, were observed to increase with dose and to decrease 
over time, however still detectable 26-weeks after administration in liver of tested animals. Dose-
dependency and decrease of vector DNA levels was also observed for all off-target tissues investigated, 
with no tissue or organ indicating accumulation over time. Differences in the formulation (PS-20) and 
co-treatment with prednisone did not significantly alter biodistribution of the vector. 
Triggering of antibodies against the capsid and hFIX was evident in the monkey studies. Albeit the 
inter-animal variability (small scale monkey studies), triggering anti-hFIX antibodies had tendency to 
be affected by the vector dose. The applicant confirmed that there was no difference in the antibody 
formation against FIX with AMT-060 compared to etranacogene dezaparvovec with the Padua hFIX 
variant in mice or in NHPs. AMT-060 and etranacogene dezaparvovec were comparable in their 
presence in the liver, biodistribution and hFIX protein levels in blood at equal doses. Thus far, no 
antibodies against hFIX have been noted in the clinical trials. 
AMT-060 and etranacogene dezaparvovec were comparable in their presence in the liver, 
biodistribution and and hFIX protein levels in blood at equal doses. Thus far, no antibodies against 
hFIX have been noted in the clinical trials. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicology data package of etranacogene dezaparvovec and AMT-060 included single IV dose 
toxicity studies up to duration of 6 months with 6 months observation period in C57Bl/6 mice and 
cynomolgus macaques, and a reproduction and developmental toxicity study in mice. IV-route of 
administration, the clinical route, is used in all toxicological studies. 
Doses ranged from a dose supporting a low pharmacological effect level to a dose corresponding to 
approximately 10- and 5-fold the recommended human dose of 2×1013 gc/kg, as tested in mice and 
cynomolgus macaques, respectively.  
Clinical chemistry, haematology/clotting, and cytokine analysis were conducted. To evaluate the 
haemostatic safety related to high levels of circulating hFIX and FIX activity, thrombin/antithrombin III 
(TAT) complex, and D-dimer levels were measured in the toxicity studies. AMT-060 and etranacogene 
dezaparvovec showed a comparable safety profile when tested side-by-side in mice and NHPs. 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
The single IV dose toxicology studies and the analysis of the safety parameters were performed under 
GLP compliance. 
Etranacogene dezaparvovec and AMT-060 were well tolerated in mice and monkeys. The studies did 
not reveal any adverse target organ toxicities associated with the administration and biodistribution of 
the vector, or as a consequence of high-level expression and activity of the hFIX-Padua protein. The 
overall no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for etranacogene dezaparvovec in the NHPs is 
9×1013 gc/kg, the highest dose tested. 9×1013 gc/kg corresponds to the 385% of normal human 
plasma FIX activity level, being approximately 10-fold above the average FIX activity level achieved 
with etranacogene dezaparvovec at the recommended human dose of 2×1013 gc/kg (mean ± SD 36.90 
± 21.40% of normal FIX activity levels).

In mice, minimal pulmonary thrombi were observed with 5×1013 gc/kg dose (one animal treated with 
etranacogene dezaparvovec and one with AMT-060), and could be pharmacology-related, a 
consequence of the high FIX activity levels (approximately 1600% of normal for etranacogene 
dezaparvovec and 300% of normal for AMT-060). The differences in FIX activities between 
etranacogene dezaparvovec and AMT-060 did not reflect on thrombosis incidences in mice studies.   
The most notable findings in NHPs were a transient mild elevation of liver enzymes AST (up to 4.5× 
mean control value) and ALT (up to 3.0× mean control value) observed on day 2 - 4 in all dose groups 
which is likely related to the viral vector load in the liver. Plasma liver enzyme activities were normal 
from Day 8 onwards.  Effects on the clotting cascade were noted with 9×1013 gc/kg in NHPs. APTT was 
slightly shortened, while PT was marginally longer, likely a consequence of the high FIX clotting activity 
levels (endogenous macaque and vector-derived combined) up to ~500% of normal human plasma FIX 
levels. Plasma TAT complex and D-dimer levels were not elevated and there were no associated 
histopathological findings. Overall a similar toxicity profile for AMT-060 and etranacogene 
dezaparvovec, suggests no overstimulation of coagulation with hFIX Padua variant in comparison to wt 
hFIX.  
No notable histopathological findings were recorded. After administration, the vector distributed widely 
and vector DNA was found also in the central nervous system including brains and spinal cord. The 
dorsal root ganglia toxicity (albeit currently with unknown clinical relevance) has been recently 
reported after administration of high dose of AAV vectors in the NHPs. The applicant confirmed that 
dorsal root ganglia toxicity was not included in histopathological analyses. No adverse findings in spinal 
cord (cervical, lumbar, and thoracic) histopathology, including absence of spinal cord axonopathy, were 
reported in the NHP study with etranacogene dezaparvovec dose up to 9 × 1013 gc/kg, with a 26-week 
follow-up. The dorsal root ganglia analysis was not included in the histopathology, but is to be 
investigated in juvenile NHP studies as part of the future PIP. These results will substantiate the 
current knowledge. 
The addition of PS-20 to the test item formulations of AMT-060 or etranacogene dezaparvovec had no 
influence on the safety profile. 
IgG antibodies against the AAV5 capsid proteins were detected after dosing even at the end of the 6-
month observation period. Antibodies against hFIX was also detected in NHPs. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
No repeated dose toxicity studies were conducted. This is acceptable, as only a single etranacogene 
dezaparvovec administration is intended in patients, obviating the need for repeated dose toxicity 
studies with such kind of gene therapy. Furthermore, the high immunity against the AAV5 vector 
obtained after the first administration would complicate subsequent administrations, or even make 
them impossible. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Vector integration after single IV administration of AMT-060 was observed following evaluation of liver 
samples from mice (20 samples, dosed up to 2.3x1014 gc/kg with and without prednisone) and 
cynomolgus macaques (12 samples, dosed up to 1x1014 gc/kg), with tissue collected at sacrifice 26 
weeks post dose.  
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 31/149 
 
 
 
  
Integration site analysis was performed using linear amplification-mediated PCR (LAM-PCR) and non-
restrictive (nr) LAM-PCR followed by deep-sequencing. Liver samples were obtained from the right lobe 
of the non-human primates or whole liver of mice. Vehicle control groups were included in both 
studies. 
In mice (n = 4) injected with rAAV5-hFIX at a dose of 2.3 x 1014 gc/kg body weight, corresponding to 
approximately 10-fold higher dose than the clinical dose in human, 3 x 107 gc/µg host DNA were 
determined at the end of a 26 week observation period, corresponding to a vector copy number/liver 
cell (VCN) ratio of approximately 180. In the murine DNA samples, 266 unique IS could be identified. 
This indicated that out of 1,000 liver cells approximately 1.6 may carry an integrated vector. On a per 
vector genome basis, less than 1 vector out of 100.000 was assumed to be genome-integrated in mice 
at this dose. In NHP (n = 3) injected with 2.5 x 1013 gc/kg body weight, a dose approximately similar 
to the human dose, 1.67 x 106 gc/µg host liver DNA were detected, along with an average of 35 IS. 
This corresponded to a VCN of approximately 11, along with 2.1 integrations for every 100.000 vector 
copies at 26 weeks post-dose. Of note, in an available human liver biopsy collected one year post–dose 
from a study participant (see also the clinical safety section), 6.25 x 105gc/µg host liver DNA and 26 IS 
were determined, indicating that for every 100.000 vector genomes 4.2 may be genome-integrated, 
thus similar numbers as observed in animal studies. 
The AAV-vectors are predominantly in episomal concatemeric forms. Low level of integration of AAVs 
are known to occur and this is an identified risk. The integration analysis conducted with liver tissue 
obtained from NHPs and mice 6 months after administration with AMT-060 confirmed a measurable but 
low level of genome integration in both species’ liver. The retrieved integrants were randomly 
distributed throughout the host genome in the NHPs, while in mice some clustering of AAV integration 
sites was found in liver. The observed integration profile was not associated with genes implicated in 
clonal outgrowth or malignant transformation. Of note, histopathological evaluation of the liver tissues 
from mice and NHPs did not reveal any abnormalities that could otherwise point to potential 
carcinogenicity, such as hypertrophy or hyperplasia at 6 months post AAV-administration.  
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Dedicated studies on carcinogenicity were not conducted with AMT-061 (nor AMT-060). 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
As males comprise the majority of the patient population to be treated, the applicant conducted a 
paternal germline transmission study in mice to address gross adverse effects on the (male) 
reproductive performance. Treated males were paired with untreated females on day 6 after male 
dosing. Although high levels of AMT-060 were detected in all tissues examined (epididymis, seminal 
vesicle, sperm, and testes) in male mice, no AMT-060 was detectable in untreated females nor the 
offspring (uterus, foetuses and placenta were examined). Thus, no paternal germline transmission was 
detected in this study. No adverse effects on reproductive organs were detected in general toxicology 
studies. 
As haemophilia B is almost exclusively limited to male patients, and as the current MAA only comprises 
adult patients, dedicated EFD and PPND studies are not required. Assessment of juvenile toxicity is not 
warranted in the presented setting. 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Refer to PK section. 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 32/149 
 
 
 
2.5.4.7.  Local tolerance  
No dedicated local tolerance studies were conducted.  
No notable findings were observed at microscopical examination of the injection site which was part of 
the general toxicity studies conducted. 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity endpoints were included in single dose toxicity studies, capsid antigens generally caused 
high titres of anti AAV5 antibodies. In addition, anti-human FIX antibodies were observed 
inconsistently in NHP.  
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Hemgenix (etranacogene dezaparvovec) is an AAV-based vector with an expression cassette containing 
hFIXco-Padua under the control of a liver-specific promoter (LP1). Etranacogene dezaparvovec belongs 
to AAV serotype 5 (AAV5) determined by the capsid. The genetic modifications introduced during the 
development of etranacogene dezaparvovec have not affected natural AAV5 host range and tissue 
tropism. 
The modified organism (AAV) is non-replicative and the transgene and its regulatory sequences are 
non-toxic or harmful to humans. 
Based on the current available data, infectious particles are only demonstrated in serum during the 
first days after administration (Favre et al, 2001). Consequently, shedding of infectious GMO particles 
is highly unlikely, but cannot be excluded. In the hypothetical case that shedding of infectious GMO 
does occur, the risk to the environment is considered negligible. Consequently, standard hospital 
hygiene measures are sufficient, and no additional measures are deemed necessary after etranacogene 
dezaparvovec administration. Accordingly, no discharge criteria have been identified that relate to 
potential environmental risks. Patients may leave the hospital as soon as the post-administration 
monitoring has passed, unless a prolonged stay is medically justified by the healthcare professional. 
To ensure that other people without haemophilia B are not exposed to Hemgenix DNA through a 
shedding process, the following risk minimisation measures are introduced (SmPC 4.4. Special 
warnings and precautions for use, and PIL / shedding): Patients treated with etranacogene 
dezaparvovec should not donate blood, or organs, tissues and cells for transplantation to minimise the 
risk of exposure to non-target individuals. 
Considering the evaluation of the characteristics of Hemgenix with respect to their potential of causing 
adverse effects to people or the environment, the potential consequences that might result from the 
occurrence of these effects and the likelihood that these effects occur, can be concluded as negligible. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
A comprehensive panel of PD studies in wt-mice, FIX-deficient mice and cynomolgus monkeys was 
conducted in support of the MAA of etranacogene dezaparvovec. Overall, the results of these studies 
demonstrate that etranacogene dezaparvovec as well as the predecessor product AMT-060 are capable 
of efficiently transducing hepatocytes and, in turn, of increasing or restoring FIX protein levels as well 
as clotting activity in a dose-dependent manner in wt-animals and haemophilia B mice, respectively. 
Doses administered covered 5×1011 to 2.3x1014 gc/kg. A study employing wt mice ranging from 
neonates through weanlings and adults demonstrated that AMT-060 is capable of long term restoration 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 33/149 
 
 
 
of stable FIX levels for at least 18 months after administration in normal mice. Notably, the treatment 
was hardly efficient in neonatal mice due to reasons that remain elusive. On the other hand, the vector 
efficacy was quite comparable in all other age groups, disregarding the initial peak observed in all adult 
age groups. 
It was noted that generally only nominal (theoretical) dose values (gc/kg) were indicated, however, 
these can widely vary from real values, i.e the actual concentration of gc/mL.  The applicant clarified 
that batches used for non-clinical studies were quantified by qPCR. 
As stated by the applicant the employed chromogenic assay as well as the aPTT test do not 
discriminate between monkey and human FIX as well as murine FIX. Therefore, the results of all non-
clinical studies reflect combined animal baseline FIX activity plus human FIX activity. 
The applicant described that lower hFIX levels were detected in mice concomitantly treated with 
prednisone as compared to animals without steroid treatment. A similar observation was made in 
patients that were treated with steroids, however, only upon elevation of transaminase levels and not 
prophylactically. Due to various factors potentially influencing protein expression in patients, the 
decrease in FIX levels in combination with steroid administration cannot unequivocally be assigned to 
one of them. The mechanism responsible for the lower hFIX levels as a consequence of prednisone 
treatment remains elusive. 
In the scope of a biodistribution and toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys the effect of pre-existing 
anti-AAV5 antibodies on transduction efficacy was investigated. Interestingly, under the conditions of 
this study pre-existing neutralizing anti-AAV5 antibodies neither affected transduction efficiency nor 
hFIX levels, whereas emerging anti-hFIX antibodies clearly lowered plasma hFIX levels. The latter 
observation was limited to animals treated with 9.3x1013 gc/kg and, thus, appeared to be dose-
dependent. Somewhat different results regarding anti-hFIX antibodies were observed in a different 
study in cynomolgus monkeys. Also in this study the highest incidence for anti-FIX antibodies was 
observed in the highest dose group, the inhibiting effect of these antibodies, however, was most 
pronounced in the lowest dose group. It is not considered valuable to follow up these observations on a 
non-clinical level as animal models are regarded to be of limited immunological predictivity for 
humans. 
After IV delivery, etranacogene dezaparvovec and AMT-060 distributed widely to the liver and also to 
extra-hepatic tissues (including testis, lungs, heart, spleen, kidneys, bone marrow, lymph nodes, 
adrenal gland, brain and spinal cord). Highest vector concentrations were found in liver, and also 
highest hFIX mRNA was found in liver (transcription driven by the liver specific promoter). In the 
extra-hepatic tissues, the vector DNA copies detected were in general proportional to the dose 
administered. 
AMT-060 instead of etranacogene dezaparvovec was used in several toxicological studies provided. 
This is regarded acceptable as AMT-060 differs only in two base pairs/one amino-acid to the final GTMP 
AMT-061 and thus, in the following toxicological section this deviation will only be further discussed, if 
specific concerns are raised based on this issue. Generally, these changes are not regarded to impact 
biodistribution nor the toxicological profile and studies conducted with AMT-060 are thus deemed 
representative. In some of the general toxicology studies conducted with AMT-061, an additional AMT-
060 arm was included for comparison and to further strengthen the assumption that despite the 
introduced changes to etranacogene dezaparvovec, data obtained for AMT-060 still provide valid 
toxicity data. 
Etranacogene dezaparvovec was well tolerated in mice and monkeys. The most notable findings were 
transient increases in the liver enzymes, and pharmacology activity-related effects on clotting 
parameters (shortened aPTT, longer PT), and occasional thrombi. NOAEL in the mice and NHPs was the 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 34/149 
 
 
 
highest dose tested. NOAEL in NHPs was 9×1013 gc/kg, which resulted in 10-fold above the average 
FIX activity level achieved with etranacogene dezaparvovec at the recommended human dose of 
2×1013 gc/kg, and corresponding to 385% of normal human plasma FIX activity level. Overall, a 
similar toxicity profile for AMT-060 and etranacogene dezaparvovec suggests no overstimulation of 
coagulation with the hFIX Padua variant compared to WT hFIX. Due to wide distribution after IV 
administration, vector DNA was found also in the central nervous system including brain and spinal 
cord. Dorsal root ganglia toxicity analysis was not included, but is going to be evaluated in juvenile 
animal studies as part of the PIP. 
The addition of PS-20 to the test item formulations of AMT-060 or etranacogene dezaparvovec had no 
influence on the safety profile. 
IgG antibodies against the AAV5 capsid proteins were detected after dosing even at the end of the 6-
month observation period. Antibodies against hFIX were also detected in NHPs. 
In the integration studies conducted using liver tissue of mice and NHP, a total of 13,949,235 
sequences were analysed, resulting in 8646 unique IS for the mice and 1541 unique IS for NHP. While 
the number of IS showed to be dose-dependent in mice, an increase in the number of IS was only 
observed for high dose group in NHP. While IS were randomly distributed throughout the host genome 
in the cynomolgus, some intense clustering of AAV IS (= common integrations sites (CIS)) was 
observed in mice, with clustering of >30 IS (with the two most abundant CIS even >60 IS). Specific 
analysis of those CIS revealed the liver specific Alb (Albumin) gene, the Ttc39c gene (tetratricopeptide 
repeat domain 39c), the mouse specific Esp38 gene (exocrine gland secreted peptide 38), and the 
gene Lrrc4c (leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 4C), to show highest IS clustering. The most 
prominent CIS regions were located within the Albumin locus and the TTC39c gene, with a CIS order of 
63. Both genes are known to be expressed in the liver. Integrations near the Albumin locus have also 
been reported in rAAV integration datasets from different animal models (Chandler et al 2015; Gil-
Farina et al 2016). This observation is in accordance with previous studies that demonstrated a higher 
incidence of rAAV integrations within actively transcribed genes containing open chromatin. Genes 
showing hepatic activity are often also associated with hepatotoxicity. In the provided data sets CIS 
were accordingly detected in Alb and Cyp2e1 in mouse samples and CYP3A4, SERPINA1 and PDCD1 in 
NHP. 
Literature states that CIS with IS <5 often occur by chance and thus are unlikely to have any biological 
relevance (Wu et al, 2006). In NHP only one CIS showed an order of >5 IS (i.e., order of 6 IS) and 
was located in the CYP3A4 gene. Overall, the data presented shows intense clustering of IS for few 
(above listed) genes only in mice, with predominance of lower order CIS in NHP, thus indicating that 
AMT-060 vector integrations generally to not tend to target specific genomic regions. 
Analyses of respective genes with three different cancer gene databases (Cancer Gene Census (CGC), 
cBioPortal, Retroviral Tagged Cancer Gene Database (RTCGD)) did not list any of the concerned genes 
to have previously been associated with cancerogenesis. According to the applicant, no enrichment of 
integrations next to or within genes listed in cancer gene databases (CGC, cBioPortal, RTCGD) has 
been observed for either mouse or NHP. A significant increase of unique IS near genes listed in CGC 
and cBioPortal was however observed in mice. 
Moreover, no preferred integration in the proto-oncogenes MECOM, LMO2 or HMGA2, previously 
implicated in insertional oncogenesis, was observed. 
Obtained data did not reveal any signs pointing towards in vivo clonal selection, and the applicant thus 
concludes that altogether data do not indicate any specific carcinogenicity concerns. Although it can be 
agreed that the data presented does not hint towards clonal selection after AAV integration, no long-
term data (>26 weeks) on this issue is currently available with AMT-060/061.

In conclusion, the data provided by the applicant show that integrations in the host genome do occur 
and have to be considered since the proposed human dose of vector administered will lead to a 
cumulative high number of integrations, at a single patient level as well as at a population level. Dose 
is considered a pivotal factor with regards to the frequency of integration and with that a main 
contributor to the risk of insertional oncogenesis. However, other factors affecting the integration 
profile and/or frequency may contribute to this risk as well, including the type and (diseased) state of 
the tissue, the design of the vector, and vector production itself. 
Considering the AAV vector by itself, AAV5 vectors (including AMT-061), are replication defective and 
contain no viral genes. AAV vectors persist for prolonged periods as episomal structures and integrated 
copies of AAV vector genomes are currently assumed to be rare. However, there are observations of 
liver integration of AAV genomes in various animal models. Relevance to human risk is confounded by 
inter-study variability, vector construct dependencies, murine specific integration sites (e.g. Rian locus) 
and murine specific physiology (higher ploidy than typical liver diploid cells, contribution of disease 
progression, mouse strain specific spontaneous tumour formation) (Zhong, 2013; Chandler, 2015; 
Bell, 2006). 
Extensive studies with AAV2 and AAV1 vectors in rodents (Schnepp, 2003; Inagaki, 2008; Li, 2011), 
rabbits (Schnepp, 2003), nonhuman primates (Nowrouzi, 2012) and in human subjects who were 
administered Glybera (an approved gene therapy product) (Kaeppel, 2013) lead to the estimation that 
the integration frequency of AAV vectors is several orders of magnitude lower than the spontaneous 
rate of mutation for human genomes (Cole, 1994) so that the likelihood of insertional mutagenesis by 
AAV vectors may be low. 
However, in another publication authors found clonal integration of wild-type AAV2 in 11 of 193 
hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). AAV2 integrations occurred in known cancer driver genes, namely 
CCNA2 (cyclin A2: four cases), TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase: one case), CCNE1 (cyclin E1: 
three cases), TNFSF10 (tumour necrosis factor superfamily member 10: two cases) and KMT2B 
(lysine-specific methyl transferase 2B; one case), leading to overexpression of the target genes, and 
consequently, oncogenicity events. Authors concluded that wild-type AAV2 viruses are DNA viruses 
associated with oncogenic insertional mutagenesis potential in human HCC (Nault, 2015). The 
relevance of these finding to recombinant AAV5 viruses that lack the Rep genes required for 
integration, as employed in Hemgenix, is unknown. 
Clonal populations of FVIII-producing cells harbouring vector DNA integrations were observed 10 years 
post dose in a haemophilia A dog study, in which animals were treated with AAV8/9 gene therapy. In 
this study clone selection was seen in 5/6 dogs, whereby 44% of the integrations were located near 
genes involved in cell growth (Nguyen, 2021).  Even though no tumours were identified in this study, 
these findings could indicate pre-stages of malignancy. 
Another example was reported in a study, which found that a pre-existing pathology (induced liver 
damage) had an impact on AAV vector-induced HCC (Dalwadi, 2021). The authors highlight that 
increased hepatocyte proliferation, coupled with inflammation, contributed to a higher incidence of 
HCC. 
In a previous study, AAV-induced oncogenicity/tumourigenicity was related to site-specific integration 
of the vector into the Rian locus present in juvenile mice only (Chandler, 2017). However, more recent 
publications (Dalwadi, 2021; Ferla, 2021) link administration of AAV gene therapies also in adult mice 
to liver tumourigenicity (and thus also to potential insertional oncogenesis associated with other 
murine loci).  
Although, so far, there is no direct link to resulting disease (in humans), it may be assumed that 
integration of AAV will at least affect liver biology. Considering the (unique) integration events 
Assessment report

Page 36/149 
 
 
 
observed in the vicinity of cancer related genes in mice, the frequency of the events, and recent data 
obtained in different animal models (mice and dog) with similar vectors, it is important to follow-up 
patients treated with Hemgenix. Further, it is of even higher importance to adapt the follow-up 
measures for patients with a known risk for liver transformation. Even though the dimension of this 
risk in patients remains currently unclear, nonclinical studies of other AAV-based therapies 
demonstrate that AAV-transgene integration can potentially manifest in tumorigenesis. In human 
clinical trials, no cases of liver cancer linked to rAAV gene therapy have occurred.  
Even though, this potentially severe and lifelong risk of insertional mutagenesis and subsequently 
carcinogenesis after intravenous Hemgenix administration has been accordingly depicted in section 
4.4. and 5.3. of the SmPC and in the Risk Management Plan.  
In the paternal germline transmission study, male mice were dosed with 2.3×1014 gc/kg AMT-060 six 
days before mating. Justification for the dosing regimen is assumed to be based on study NR-060-14-
002 where C57BL/6 mice were dosed up to the same concentration and biodistribution was 
investigated in various tissues at day 8 and day 180 after dosing. At day 8, levels of AMT-060 vector 
DNA were detectable in all animals in all investigated tissues, including epididymides, seminal vesicles 
and testes. In the paternal transmission study itself, biodistribution of vector DNA to the above listed 
tissues plus sperm was detected in male animals on Day 20 after dosing, but no such data was 
provided for the time point of mating (D6). Justification for the selection of dose levels and the timing 
of dosage and pairing was provided by the applicant. AMT-060 was present in epididymides, seminal 
vesicles and testes on D6 in study NR-060-14-002, and in epididymides, seminal vesicles, testes and 
sperm on D20 after dosing in the presented study. The time point was chosen based on the expected 
presence of peak levels of qPCR-detectable vector DNA in testes and epididymis, including the 
maturing spermatozoa, which was subsequently confirmed in the 6-month toxicity study in mice with 
AMT-060 (at the Day 8 sacrifice). Reference to recent literature was also provided. It is acknowledged 
that vector DNA was neither detected in females nor fetuses in this study. 
The risk of etranacogene dezaparvovec to third parties or to the environment is considered negligible. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that murine and monkey 
hepatocytes are efficiently transduced by etranacogene dezaparvovec and produce hFIX dose-
dependently, enabling sustained and durable hFIX activity levels.  
From the pharmacokinetic point of view, non-human primates were the most relevant species for non-
clinical efficacy and safety studies, as natural hosts for AAVs. The biodistribution of etranacogene 
dezaparvovec was determined by route of administration (IV) and capsid (AAV5).   
Overall, the toxicology programme revealed that etranacogene dezaparvovec was well tolerated in 
mice and NHPs. AAV stays largely episomal, but a low level of integration was noted in both mice and 
NHPs. 
The potentially severe and lifelong risk of insertional mutagenesis and subsequently carcinogenesis 
after intravenous Hemgenix administration has been included in the product information and Risk 
management Plan.  
Etranacogene dezaparvovec can be granted a marketing authorisation from a non-clinical point of 
view. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the nonclinical aspects as 
described above.

The clinical development programme was initiated with AMT-060 (AAV5-hFIXco), the predecessor of 
etranacogene dezaparvovec. 
AMT-060 was investigated at 2 dose levels in the first-in-human phase 1/2 Study CT-AMT-060-01. 
Treatment was safe and well tolerated in both the low and high-dose cohorts. All 10 subjects converted 
to a mild or moderate haemophilia B phenotype and 9 out of 10 subjects achieved discontinuation of 
routine FIX replacement therapy. At 5 years of follow-up, all subjects continued to stably express FIX 
(mean FIX ranged between 2.8 to 10.7%) and showed a clinically relevant reduction in annualised 
bleeding rate (ABR) for total and spontaneous bleeding episodes. 
Following Health Authority interaction, and in order to increase FIX levels further towards a normal FIX 
range (≥ 40%), the drug product was modified to express the naturally occurring hFIX-Padua variant 
(AAV5-hFIXco-Padua; etranacogene dezaparvovec). 
Assessment report

Clinical development with etranacogene dezaparvovec continued by enrolling 57 subjects into Study 
CT-AMT-061-01 (N = 3) and Study CT-AMT-061-02 (N = 54) regardless of the subjects’ preexisting 
anti-AAV5 neutralizing antibody (nAb) titres.  
2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
AMT-061 (etranacogene dezaparvovec) is a viral gene therapy product to be administered 
intravenously. Conventional pharmacokinetic analyses do not apply to products that form in vivo, and 
therefore no clinical studies have been conducted to investigate the classical aspects of absorption, 
metabolism or excretion of AMT-061. The kinetics of AMT-061-derived FIX activity and FIX protein 
concentrations in plasma, the specific activity of the AMT-061-derived FIX, the distribution of AMT-061 
vector DNA in blood, and the shedding of AMT-061 vector DNA in secreta and excreta are discussed 
under Clinical efficacy and Clinical safety, respectively. 
Factor IX (FIX) activity was measured by two methods: the one-stage clotting assay and the 
chromogenic/amidolytic assay. 
In the one-stage aPTT clotting assay, incubation of the plasma sample with an optimal quantity of 
phospholipid, a negatively charged activator and buffer initiate the activation of the intrinsic 
coagulation pathway. After incubation at 37 °C for a specific period of time calcium is added to trigger 
the coagulation process and the time required for clot formation is measured at a wavelength of 671 
nm. The clotting time in seconds (s) is then converted to a % activity of FIX based on the calibration 
curve, which consists of human plasma with a certified FIX level.  
The following parameters were validated: calibration curve fit, carry over, precision and accuracy, 
lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) and upper limit of quantification (ULOQ), measurement range, 
drift, matrix effect (effect of haemolysis, lipemia and icterus), FIX stability in plasma at ambient 
temperature, FIX freeze/thaw stability in plasma in low temperature freezer, and FIX stability in 
plasma in low temperature freezer. All validation criteria were met. The measurement range was 
established between 0.6 – 110.3 % FIX activity. The method was shown to perform well on samples 
from treated patients. 
The FIX chromogenic assay uses the colorimetric principle of measuring absorbance of light by the 
solution in a cuvette. The amount of light that reaches the photo-detector is converted into an 
electrical signal that is proportional to enzymatic activity. The method for assessing FIX activity uses 
the BIOPHEN chromogenic kit produced by Hyphen Biomed. The following parameters were validated: 
calibration curve fit, carry over, precision and accuracy, lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) and upper 
limit of quantification (ULOQ), measurement range, drift, matrix effect (effect of haemolysis, lipemia 
and icterus), FIX stability in plasma at ambient temperature, FIX freeze/thaw stability in plasma in low 
temperature freezer and FIX stability in plasma in low temperature freezer. The method was 
successfully validated and performed well on samples obtained from treated patients. The 
measurement range for this method was defined as 0.8 - 109.3 % FIX activity. 
The kinetics of FIX activity, FIX protein, clearance of vector DNA and immunogenicity, along with 
safety and tolerability of AMT-060, were evaluated in the first-in-human phase 1/2 study (Study CT-
AMT-060-01) in subjects with moderately severe or severe haemophilia B. The kinetics of FIX activity, 
FIX protein, clearance of vector DNA, immunogenicity, along with efficacy and safety, were evaluated 
in Studies CT-AMT-061-01 and CT-AMT-061-02.  
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 41/149 
 
 
 
In addition to these individual studies, analyses were performed for the impact of both intrinsic factors 
and extrinsic factors and immunogenicity on FIX activity, using data from Study CT-AMT-061-02. 
Analyses of durability of FIX activity and FIX protein expression of etranacogene dezaparvovec were 
performed using combined data from Studies CT-AMT-061-01 and CT-AMT-061-02 with supportive 
evidence from Study CT-AMT-060-01.  
Biodistribution of AMT-061 was tested in human blood and semen by Q-PCR. The method was 
validated for AMT-060. The sequence of primers and probe was not shown. For control plasmid 
(inhibitory control), full map and sequence, with primers and probe highlighted was provided. 
Acceptable recoveries were demonstrated from all matrices tested (blood, urine, semen, nasal 
secretions, faeces and saliva). LOD was set at 10 copies per reaction and LLOQ at 100 copies per 
reaction. None of the extracts showed inhibitory properties. Validation is considered appropriate. 
Results of tests carried out in blood and semen of participants in the Phase III clinical trial were 
presented. A brief description of the method used, including the sequence of primers and probes, was 
submitted. Although no details on the location of primers and probes were provided, this is not 
considered critical as positive results were reported. The method was validated with AMT-060 but 
results of this study show that the method is suitable for detecting AMT-061 as well.  
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Etranacogene dezaparvovec is a somatic gene therapy product that aims to deliver a nucleic acid 
expression cassette capable of driving expression and synthesis of functional FIX to the liver of 
patients with haemophilia B. One-time treatment with etranacogene dezaparvovec allows the patient 
to continuously produce functional human FIX (hFIX)-Padua protein at levels which modify the severity 
of their haemophilia B disease. 
Etranacogene dezaparvovec consists of a hFIX-Padua coding sequence (hFIXco-Padua) expression 
cassette, which is packaged within a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 5 vector (rAAV5). 
Codon-optimisation introduced silent nucleotide changes in the hFIXco, which may improve messenger 
ribonucleic acid stability and FIX gene expression, while not changing the resulting amino acid 
sequence. 
The naturally occurring hFIX-Padua variant encoded by the gene expression cassette of etranacogene 
dezaparvovec differs from the wild-type hFIX protein by a single amino acid substitution of the mature 
protein (Arg [AAG] → Leu [CTG] at position 338 [R338L]), which increases FIX activity 6 to 8-fold. 
The hFIX coding sequence is flanked upstream by the liver-specific promoter-1 (LP-1), driving liver-
specific transgene expression and downstream by the SV40 polyA (transcription termination, 
polyadenylation). Between the LP-1 promoter and the hFIX / hFIX-Padua coding sequence is a SV40 
intron (to promote transgene expression). The entire expression cassette is flanked by inverted 
terminal repeats. 
The PD effect of treatment with Hemgenix consists of the expression of functional FIX protein by 
transduced liver cells, the activity of which can be measured in the plasma. FIX activity is the primary 
efficacy endpoint of the phase 2b study and a secondary efficacy endpoint of the pivotal phase 3 trial, 
therefore those outcomes are discussed in the efficacy part of this assessment report. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The Guideline on the quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of gene therapy medicinal products 
(EMA/CAT/80183/2014) specifies that classical pharmacokinetic studies based on absorption, 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 42/149 
 
 
 
distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies are usually not required for GTMPs. Therefore, 
the lack of clinical pharmacology studies in this dossier is acceptable. The same guideline further 
clarifies that on a case by case basis, pharmacokinetics studies need to be carried out depending on 
the specific GTMPs, e.g. if the gene product is a protein excreted in the blood circulation. Plasma levels 
of the induced FIX activity are defined as the primary endpoint of phase 2b study CT-AMT-061-01 and 
as a secondary endpoint of the pivotal study CT-AMT-061-02 and are discussed in the efficacy part of 
this assessment report. 
Vector DNA biodistribution and shedding are discussed in the safety part of this assessment report. 
The pharmacodynamic effect of Hemgenix is the induction of relevant plasma levels of FIX, which 
restore the coagulatory ability of the patient’s blood. Endpoints illustrating this PD effect are plasma 
levels of FIX, which are defined as a primary or secondary endpoint in the submitted clinical trials. 
Despite these laboratory values being of interest as established surrogate endpoints of efficacy in 
haemophilia trials, the main aim of gene therapy with Hemgenix is to provide patients with the 
freedom from bleeding events and also freedom from regular prophylactic and/or therapeutic infusions 
of external factor IX. Therefore, the endpoints with the most clinical relevance are the annualised 
bleeding rate, annualised factor IX consumption and annualised FIX infusion rate, which are all 
discussed in the clinical efficacy part of this assessment report. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The product can be approved on pharmacology grounds. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the clinical pharmacology 
aspects as described above. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The main evidence for efficacy and safety derives from the phase 2b trial CT-AMT-061-01 and the 
pivotal trial CT-AMT-061-02, in which a combined 57 subjects were enrolled. 2.5 years of follow-up is 
available for the phase 2 study, and 1.5 years for the pivotal study. With the responses to the D120 
LoQ, the applicant submitted efficacy data up to month 36 of CT-AMT-061-01 and up to month 24 for 
pivotal trial AMT-061-02. 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study 
CT-AMT-061-01 
Phase IIb, open-label, single-dose, single-arm, multi-centre trial to confirm the factor IX 
activity level of the serotype 5 adeno-associated viral vector containing the Padua variant of 
a codon-optimised human factor IX gene (AAV5-hFIXco-Padua, AMT-061) administered to 
adult subjects with severe or moderately severe haemophilia B 
CT-AMT-061-01 is an ongoing Phase IIb trial consisting of a screening phase, a treatment plus post-
treatment follow-up phase, and a long-term follow-up phase. After a maximum 6-week screening 
period, 3 eligible subjects received a single IV dose of 2 × 1013 gc/kg AMT-061. Subjects were 
monitored for tolerance to AMT-061 and detection of immediate AEs for 24 hours (overnight stay) after 
dosing. The dosing of the subjects was separated by a minimum of 14 calendar days to allow for 
subject safety monitoring and to ensure appropriate action could be taken in case any acute reactions 
were observed.

Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Males 18 years or older with known severe or moderately 
severe FIX deficiency (1-2% of normal circulating FIX, inclusive and a severe bleeding phenotype) with 
at least 20 exposure days to FIX products could enrol. Patients could be on either prophylaxis or on-
demand therapy, but patients on on-demand therapy must have a history of frequent bleeding (4 or 
more bleeding episodes in the last 12 months) or chronic haemophilic arthropathy (pain, joint 
destruction, and loss of range of motion) in 1 or more joints. Patients with a history of FIX inhibitors, 
HIV-positive patients with CD4+ counts ≥200/μL, subjects who had ALT, AST or total bilirubin >2 
times the upper limit of normal, patients with active infection with hepatitis B or C virus and patients 
with a history of hepatitis B or C exposure, currently controlled by antiviral therapy, were excluded 
from participation in the clinical trial. 
Primary Efficacy Variables/Endpoints:  
Factor IX activity level at six weeks after dosing. 
Secondary Efficacy Variables/Endpoints:  
−  Endogenous factor IX activity level at Week 6 and Week 52 post AMT-061 dose,  
−  Remaining free of previous continuous routine prophylaxis during 52 weeks following AMT-061 
dosing 
−  Total usage of factor IX replacement therapy until 52 weeks following AMT-061 dosing (excluding 
ad hoc prophylaxis for invasive procedures),  
−  Annualised bleeding rate after 52 weeks of AMT-061 dosing (including a further break down of the 
frequency and percentage of spontaneous, traumatic, and joint bleeding events). 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints include joint health and QoL scores, correlation between AAV5 
neutralizing antibodies titres and factor IX activity levels, and factor IX-protein-to-activity ratio in 
subjects without residual expression of non-functional factor IX protein. 
Blood samples for determination of endogenous FIX activity and FIX protein were collected and 
assessed at the central and/or local laboratory. Central laboratory results for FIX activity were used in 
the analyses. Local laboratory results for FIX activity may have been used for local monitoring of 
subjects, to assess the potential need for exogenous FIX, but not to assess treatment outcome. 
Descriptive statistics and plots only display uncontaminated results, i.e., factor IX activity levels that 
were not affected by exogenous factor IX use during the trial. The required wash out period (in order 
to consider a factor IX activity level to be “unaffected” – i.e., “uncontaminated”) was 10 days. 
From the Screening Visit until Week 52, subjects recorded the use of all prophylactic and on-demand 
FIX replacement therapy in an e-diary. In the long-term follow-up phase, subjects record information 
of FIX replacement therapy in a study-specific paper diary. 
From the Screening Visit until Week 52, subjects recorded information of bleeding episodes in an e-
diary. The Investigator assessed each bleeding episode reported in the e-diary as soon as possible 
within 72 hours after it was reported, and recorded the outcome of the bleeding episode. In the long-
term follow-up phase, subjects recorded information of bleeding episodes in a study-specific paper 
diary, which they brought to each visit. Information that was new since the previous visit was collected 
by site staff. Between visits, subjects also contacted the site immediately in case of an experienced 
bleed and provided relevant information. 
Patient Population: This study was initiated on 24 July 2018 (first subject’s informed consent date) and 
occurred at 4 study centres in the United States. A total of 3 subjects were screened and treated in the 
Assessment report

study. All 3 subjects completed 2.5 years (30 months) of follow-up post-AMT-061 administration by 18 
March 2021. All subjects remain in the long-term follow-up period of the study at the time of the data 
cut-off. Study subjects were male and, at screening, were 43, 47, and 50 years old. Two subjects were 
African American (Black) and 1 subject was Caucasian (White). Two suffered from severe haemophilia 
B and one from moderately severe HB. 
Subjects had 1, 3, or 5 bleeding episodes in the year before screening, which were all spontaneous and 
varied in severity from mild to severe. No subject had any target joints at screening (i.e., a joint into 
which they had bled at least 3 times in the 6 previous months). In the 12 months before the Screening 
Visit, all 3 subjects used prophylactic and on-demand FIX replacement therapy and all subjects had > 
150 days of exposure to FIX. 
All 3 subjects had a prior Hepatitis C infection, and 2 subjects had a controlled HIV infection. 
Efficacy Outcomes 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
FIX Activity at Week 6  
At Week 6, mean ± SD uncontaminated FIX activity level was 30.6 ± 6.97% of normal measured by 
the one-stage (aPTT-based) assay. Individual FIX activity levels achieved by each subject at Week 6 
were 23.9%, 30.0%, and 37.8%. This is considerably higher than values achieved in the Phase I study 
CT-AMT-060-01, where mean activity was approximately 7.5% with a dose of 2 × 1013 gc/kg of an 
AAV vector carrying the wild-type FIX DNA. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Factor IX Activity Levels at Week 52 
At Week 52, mean ± SD uncontaminated FIX activity level was 40.8 ± 9.45% of normal measured by 
the one-stage (aPTT-based) assay. Individual FIX activity levels achieved by each subject at Week 52 
were 31.3%, 40.8%, and 50.2% 
Factor IX Activity Levels Post-AMT-061 Administration 
Factor IX activity levels measured by the one-stage (aPTT-based) assay increased for all 3 subjects to 
clinically relevant levels following 1-time administration of AMT-061. At Baseline, uncontaminated 
mean FIX activity was 5.1%, based on data for 1 subject. The other 2 subjects did not have a baseline 
FIX assessment that was considered uncontaminated (i.e., assessments post-AMT-061 administration 
that were more than 5 half-lives of exogenous FIX use), and therefore were not included in this 
calculation. Mean ± SD FIX activity was 23.4 ± 1.04% of normal at Week 3, increasing to 30.6 ± 
6.97% of normal at Week 6, and 40.8 ± 9.45% of normal at Week 52. At Month 18, Month 24, and 
Month 30, mean ± SD FIX activity was 47.0 ± 12.66%, 44.2 ± 7.66%, and 50.0 ± 11.40% of normal, 
respectively. At Month 36, 3 years post-AMT-061 administration, uncontaminated samples were 
available for 2 subjects and demonstrated that FIX activity levels continued to be elevated, at 32.3% 
and 41.5%, respectively. 
Annualised Bleeding Rates and Bleeding Episodes 
The average ABR for the 3 subjects, calculated as the total number of bleeding episodes divided by the 
time (in years) at risk, was 0.27 over the period of 2.5 years (30 months) of follow-up. The ABRs for 
spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes over 2.5 years (30 months) were both 0.14. The 
average ABR for the 3 subjects, calculated as the total number of bleeding episodes divided by the 
time (in years) at risk, was 0.22 over the period of 3 years (36 months) of follow-up. The ABRs for 
spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes over 3 years (36 months) were both 0.11. There were 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 45/149 
 
 
 
no bleeding episodes between 2.5 and 3 years of follow-up (both bleeding episodes occurred in the 
first 18 months post-AMT-061 administration). 
As this trial had no run-in phase specified in the protocol, a comparison to meaningful pre-treatment 
data is not possible. 
Use of Factor IX Replacement Therapy 
The annualised mean FIX replacement use was 306,204.9 IU/year in the 1 year prior to screening, 
260,285.8 IU/year in the 30 days prior to screening, and 299,330.7 IU/year during screening (Table 
2). During the screening period, the annualised mean FIX replacement use was 250,726.5; 266,583.8; 
and 380,681.8 IU/year for the 3 subjects. Subjects used extended half-life products during the 
screening period. 
The annualised mean FIX use was 1220.4 IU/year over 2.5 years (30 months) of follow-up post-AMT-
061 administration and was 689.1 IU/year for the period following discontinuation of routine 
prophylaxis (the post-continuous prophylaxis period; Table 2). All subjects discontinued use of routine 
prophylaxis FIX use between 1 and 4 days post-AMT-061 administration. Over 3 years (36 months) of 
follow-up, the annualised mean FIX use was 1157.2 IU/year post-AMT-061 administration and was 
714.6 IU/year for the period following discontinuation of routine prophylaxis (the post-continuous 
prophylaxis period. 
Exogenous FIX consumption during the post-treatment phase was low, but as this trial had no run-in 
phase specified in the protocol, a comparison to meaningful pre-treatment data is not possible. 
Exploratory Efficacy Measure 
Factor IX Activity Levels – Chromogenic Assay 
At Baseline, Week 6, Week 52, and Month 30, mean ± SD uncontaminated FIX activity measured by 
the chromogenic assay was 2.7%, 17.5 ± 3.64%, 22.2 ± 5.98%, and 22.3 ± 5.90%, respectively 
(Table 3), compared to 5.1%, 30.6 ± 6.97, 40.8 ± 9.45%, and 50.0 ± 11.40%, respectively, 
measured by the one-stage (aPTT-based) assay. Uncontaminated factor IX activity measured using the 
chromogenic assay was approximately half of what was measured using the one-stage assay (mean 
ratio ranged between 0.4431 and 0.6337). 
A discrepancy was noted if FIX activity is measured with the one-stage and the chromogenic assay. 
The chromogenic assay returns approximately half the values observed with the one-stage assay. 
Therefore the correlation of values returned by both assays has to be investigated with a special 
emphasis on high and low values of FIX activity. The discrepancy has to be mentioned in section 4.4 of 
the SmPC and a conversion factor has to be provided to allow the treating physician a meaningful 
monitoring of factor levels with either assay. Furthermore, when using an in vitro thromboplastin time 
(aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining factor IX activity in patients’ blood samples, 
plasma factor IX activity results can be significantly affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the 
reference standard used in the assay. This is of importance particularly when changing the laboratory 
and/or reagents used in the assay. The applicant is therefore asked to clarify which reagents/reference 
standards have been used to monitor patients’ FIX levels in the clinical trial programme and to add a 
description of these assays to the SmPC in the same section as above. In addition, the applicant was 
asked to clarify if the assays used for monitoring FIX levels in the clinical trial environment correspond 
to those widely available for routine clinical monitoring in the EU. 
With their responses to the D120 LoQ, the applicant argued that a conversion factor between the two 
assay methods is not warranted due to the one-stage assay being the most commonly used method to 
monitor FIX activity levels in clinical practice. Furthermore, the mean ratio of FIX activity by 
chromogenic assay to one-stage (aPTT-based) assay ranged from 0.408 to 0.547 across post-dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 46/149 
 
 
 
time-points up to Month 24 and, accordingly, did not allow for a robust single conversion factor 
between these 2 assays.  
However, as the applicant also mentions, the chromogenic assay is used in cases when a clinical 
bleeding phenotype appears to be discrepant from the FIX activity as measured by the one-stage 
assay. Therefore, even if it is not possible to provide a meaningful conversion factor, the fact that the 
two assay systems return discrepant values when monitoring FIX activity induced by AMT-061 
treatment is brought to the attention of the treating physician with a warning statement in section 4.4 
of the SmPC. 
Of the 33 investigator sites used in pivotal trial AMT-061-02, 13 were in the EU (BE, DK, IT, NL, DE, SE 
and IE). The central laboratory used to determine FIX activity was Unilabs a.s. Bioanalytical Solutions 
in Copenhagen, Denmark. The central laboratory used the validated HemoSiL SynthASiL (IL) one stage 
assay platform while the investigator sites used HemoSiL SynthASiL (IL), PTT Automate (Stago), Actin 
FS (Siemens) and Actin FSL (Siemens) one stage assay platforms for local FIX activity determination. 
The applicant has provied a correlation analysis of FIX activity values determined at the central and 
local labs and an analysis of the ratio of FIX activity measured locally and centrally. Both analyses 
support the notion that FIX activity can be determined in a reproducible way using the four different 
assay systems. The one-stage assays used in the pivotal trial correspond to the assay systems most 
commonly used worldwide [Sommer et al, Int J Lab Hematol, 2020; 42:350-58], in addition, as 
described above, the central lab as well as 13 investigator sites were in the EU and used representative 
assay platforms. 
Factor IX Activity Levels and Neutralizing Antibodies 
All subjects had pre-existing nAbs to AAV5 at the Screening Visit, defined as having a titre ≥7. Titres 
were 25.2, 43.8, and 47.6 at the Screening Visit, and 19.5, 22.1, and 33.0 at the Baseline Visit prior to 
administration of AMT-061. By Week 2, titres were >36,450.0 (the upper limit of quantification) for all 
subjects and titres remained >36450.0 through to Month 24. With pre-existing nAbs, subjects still 
achieved a mean FIX activity of approximately 30.6% by Week 6, 40.8% at Week 52, and 50.0% at 
Month 30. 
All three subjects displayed low titre neutralising antibodies against AAV at baseline. Interestingly, the 
subject with the highest titre consistently had the lowest FIX activity levels. However, the low number 
of subjects precludes meaningful conclusions from these data.

or moderately severe haemophilia B 
CT-AMT-061-02 (Health Outcomes with Padua Gene; Evaluation in Haemophilia B [HOPE B]) is an 
ongoing open-label, single-dose, multi-centre, multinational trial, with a screening phase/period, a 
lead-in phase/period, a treatment plus a post-treatment follow-up phase/period, and a long-term 
follow-up phase/period.

During the lead-in phase, which lasted a minimum of 26 weeks, subjects recorded their use of FIX 
replacement therapy and bleeding episodes in their dedicated e-diary in order to provide a baseline of 
bleeding event frequency and FIX consumption. 
Methods 
•  Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria: 
Adult subjects with congenital haemophilia B with known severe or moderately severe FIX deficiency (≤
2% of normal circulating FIX) for which the subject was on continuous routine FIX prophylaxis and had 
>150 previous exposure days of treatment with FIX protein. 
Main exclusion criteria: 
Subjects with a history of FIX inhibitors, ALT >2 times ULN, AST >2 times ULN, Total bilirubin >2 times 
ULN (except if caused by Gilbert disease), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) >2 times ULN, Creatinine >2 
times ULN; Positive HIV serological test at screening and Visit L-Final, not controlled with anti-viral 
therapy as shown by CD4+ counts ≤200/μL (based on central laboratory results); Hepatitis B or C 
infection with the following criteria present at screening: Currently receiving antiviral therapy for 
this/these infection(s) and/or positive for any of the following - Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), 
except if in the opinion of the Investigator this was due to a previous hepatitis B vaccination rather 
than active hepatitis B infection - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid 
(RNA); Known significant medical condition that may have significantly impacted the intended 
transduction of the vector and/or expression and activity of the protein 
•  Treatments 
Subjects were planned to receive a single IV infusion of 2 × 1013 gc/kg AMT-061. 
The pharmaceutical form of AMT-061 was a solution for IV infusion. 
AMT-061 was formulated as a sterile solution at a concentration of approximately 1 × 1013 gc/mL in 
Phosphate Buffer Saline (pH 7.2) with 5% (w/w) sucrose and 0.02% (v/v) polysorbate 20. The IMP 
was supplied in 10 R clear glass type I vials filled with approximately 10 mL of AMT-061. Each vial 
contained an extractable volume of at least 10 mL. 
The AMT-061 product remained in its original secondary packaging and was stored frozen at ≤ -65°C 
at all times prior to use. AMT-061 was stable at ≤-65°C for at least 24 months and for a maximum of 
24 hours at room temperature (as of first vial break and until start of administration). Each vial of 
AMT-061 was labelled with the product name, batch number, vial number, product concentration,

manufacturing date, and storage conditions. Sites were instructed to protect prepared infusion bags 
from light during room temperature storage. 
The reference therapy was the prophylaxis FIX replacement therapy used during the lead-in phase 
prior to treatment with AMT-061. 
•  Objectives

•  Sample size 
The study sample size is constrained by the non-inferiority analysis of the primary endpoint, ABR. 
Based on a literature search of trials in a similar clinical setting and the same underlying disease, as 
well as the previous AMT-060 Phase I/II trial, a non-inferiority margin of 1.8 is assessed for the rate 
ratio of ABR between AMT-061 (post-treatment) and factor IX prophylaxis (lead-in). For establishing 
the non-inferiority margin, an ABR of 2.4 between factor IX prophylaxis and placebo treatment has 
been assumed. Via simulation of ABR under a negative binomial distribution with a yearly rate of 2.4 
events for lead-in and 1.9 for post-treatment, with a Pearson correlation of 0.05 for the number of 
events between the two periods, and with a common negative binomial dispersion parameter of 1.5, a 
sample size of N=50 will demonstrate non-inferiority with a non-inferiority margin of 1.8 and a power 
of 82.0%. Therefore, the study should consist of at least 50 analyzable subjects. Given the sample size 
needed for ABR, this will produce a power >95% for the secondary statistical analysis of endogenous 
factor IX activity. For the secondary statistical analyses of factor IX activity at 6, 12, and 18 months, 
assuming a mean of 30.6 percent of normal (as observed at 6 weeks in study CT-AMT-061-01) and 
assuming a standard deviation of 6.97 (as observed at 6 weeks in study CT-AMT-061-01), assuming 
conservatively that the baseline factor IX activity is 2%, and assuming that the sample size is 50 
subjects, for a one-sample t-test at the 0.025 one-sided level of significance to test whether the 
change from baseline is > 0, the statistical power is > 99%. Alternatively, assuming that the standard 
deviation is 6.95, which is half of the range of factor IX activity values (23.9 to 37.8) observed at 6 
weeks in study CTAMT- 061-01, the statistical power is still > 99%. The nQuery Advisor software was 
employed for this power calculation.

•  Statistical methods 
Analysis population 
Screen Failures 
The screen failure population included all subjects who were screened but never entered the lead-in 
period. 
Lead-in Discontinuers 
The lead-in discontinuers population included all subjects who entered the lead-in period but 
discontinued from the study prior to AMT-061 dosing. 
Safety Population 
The lead-in safety population consisted of all subjects who are enrolled into the lead-in period. The 
post-treatment safety population consisted of all subjects who receive AMT-061, irrespective of any 
protocol deviations. Period-specific safety tabulations used the period-specific safety population for the 
“N” and denominator (for percentages). The safety population consisted of all subjects who are in 
either the lead-in safety population or the post-treatment safety population. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
The FAS included all subjects who are enrolled, entered the lead-in phase, were dosed with AMT-061, 
and provided at least one efficacy endpoint assessment for any efficacy endpoint subsequent to AMT-
061 dosing. The FAS population was the primary population for all efficacy statistical analyses. 
Per-Protocol Population 
The PP population included all subjects from the FAS population who adhered to a stable and adequate 
prophylaxis use during the lead-in phase, who completed at least 18 months of efficacy assessments 
(52 weeks after achieving stable FIX expression) for the 18-month (data cut) analysis who completed 
at least a full year of efficacy assessments for the 12-month (data cut) analysis, or who completed at 
least 6 months of efficacy assessments for the 6-month (data cut) analysis, and who had no major 
protocol deviations that impact the interpretation of efficacy. The PP population was used for sensitivity 
analyses. Protocol deviations that impacted the interpretation of efficacy included the unwillingness to 
discontinue continuous prophylaxis use after receipt of AMT-061. 
Primary Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as follows: 
Annualised bleeding rate (ABR) comparison between AMT-061 and prophylaxis for non-inferiority 
between the 52 weeks following stable FIX expression (6-18 months) post treatment (AMT-061) 
follow-up and the lead-in phase 
ABR was determined for the lead-in period and post-treatment period (for the 52 weeks following 
stable FIX expression [6-18 months]). Analysis of the number of reported bleeding events was 
performed using a repeated measures generalised estimating equations (GEE) negative binomial 
regression model accounting for the paired design of the trial with an offset parameter to account for 
the differential collection periods. An unstructured covariance matrix was employed. If the model fails 
to converge, then a compound symmetry covariance structure is used. The model included the 
treatment (i.e. period) as a categorical variable. If convergence was not attained, then initial 
parameter estimates were provided. The estimated rate ratio and one-sided 97.5% Wald CI and the 
corresponding p-value was determined. The upper limit of the resultant CI of the rate ratio was 
compared to the non-inferiority margin of 1.8. If the upper limit is less than 1.8, then non-inferiority is 
declared. 
Several sensitivity analyses were performed:

Missing Data 
Missing data was maintained as missing in the safety and efficacy datasets, unless specified otherwise. 
If causality was missing for a TEAE, the TEAE was regarded as ‘Related’. If causality was missing for an 
AE with onset before administration of trial drug, the AE was regarded as 'Not related'. If the intensity 
was  missing,  the  intensity  of  the  AE  was  regarded  as  “Severe.”  In  the  case  where  seriousness  was 
missing,  this  should  be  queried.  Seriousness  cannot  be  imputed  as  'Yes'  by  default,  since  this  would 
affect the reconciliation between trial database and registry of SAEs. 
After  18  months  post-dose,  efficacy  and  safety  data  were  collected,  and  the  data  were  locked  and 
analysed. These data included all subject-specific Month 18 visits, as well as visits beyond Month 18 if 
they occurred (or the events/exposures began) before 31 August 2021. The results from this 18-month 
analysis are presented in this CSR.

Detailed  methodology  for  the  display,  summary,  and  statistical  analyses  of  the  data  collected  in  this 
study were documented in a SAP, dated 10 June 2021, prior to the data cutoff date.  
Except where specified, all continuous variables were summarised with descriptive statistics (the number 
of  non-missing  values,  mean,  SD,  median,  minimum,  maximum,  quartiles  [Q1  and  Q3])  and  all 
categorical  variables  were  summarised  with  frequency  counts  and  percentages,  by  treatment  group. 
Data were presented by study phase as appropriate. 
Hypothesis testing for the primary endpoint was carried out as a one-sided non-inferiority test with a 
non-inferiority  margin  of  1.8.  Formal  statistical  testing  of  the  efficacy  endpoints  (where  performed), 
using a hierarchical approach, tested for superiority at a one-sided alpha level of 0.025. 
Time-to-event  data  were  summarised  using  the  Kaplan-Meier  method,  as  appropriate.  Statistical 
analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC 27513).

Study start date: 27 June 2018 (First subject’s informed consent date)  
The study is currently ongoing. 
•  Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments: 
There were 6 global protocol amendments implemented during the trial. 
In Amendment 1, it was specified that factor inhibitor testing at screening and Visit L-Final (exclusion 
criterion #2) would be based on local laboratory results, while all other screening laboratory tests 
(exclusion criteria #3, 4, 5, and 8) would be based on central laboratory results. Inclusion criterion #4 
was updated to include subjects with >150 exposure days of treatment with FIX protein. The timing of 
assessments was refined. Additionally, a chromogenic assay for FIX activity was added; the timing and 
volume of blood draws was updated to integrate the new assay. 
In Amendment 2, the number of study sites was increased to approximately 50. The dose of AMT-061 
was established as 2 × 1013 gc/kg, reflecting results from the interim analysis of the dose confirmation 
study (CT-AMT-061-01). In this amendment, FibroScan™ was added as an assessment tool for liver 
health and it was specified that the Investigator and subject should discuss the importance of a healthy 
liver before and after receiving therapy. Advanced liver fibrosis and a known history of corticosteroid 
allergy were added as exclusion criteria (#9 and #11, respectively). This amendment also clarified that 
clinical management should be considered in the case of ALT level increments of at least 2 × baseline 
and >ULN and AST level increments of at least 2 × ULN. 
Amendment 2 also specified that the lead-in phase would occur for a minimum of 26 weeks, ending at 
or before Visit D. It was clarified that the wash out period would be 3 days for regular-acting FIX 
products and 10 days for extended half-life FIX products. The amendment specified that study visits 
should be scheduled on the day routine prophylactic FIX replacement treatment was planned to be 
administered to ensure FIX activity was at its trough. Post-treatment follow-up assessments could be 
conducted at home, as appropriate. Alpha-fetoprotein and FIX gene sequence analyses were added in 
this amendment. It was clarified that the short form of the iPAQ would be used; the long form of the 
iPAQ was completed by some subjects prior to this amendment. For the optional MSKUS sub-study, it 
was clarified that if it was not possible to obtain the MSKUS at screening, obtaining this first MSKUS at 
a later timepoint was allowed. 
In Amendment 3, an abdominal ultrasound to screen for liver malignancy was added. Exclusion 
criterion #3 was updated to allow subjects with total bilirubin >2 × ULN if this elevation was caused by 
Gilbert disease. It was specified that subjects could have received their dose of continuous routine FIX 
on the day of AMT-061 dosing; blood sampling was to occur prior to FIX administration and the 
requirement that this occurred at the clinic was removed. It was specified that the time period between 
Visit LX and Visit L-Final could be less than 2 months as long as the total lead-in period was a 
minimum of 26 weeks. It was also clarified that if subjects were not able to enter details of their FIX 
replacement therapy or bleeding episodes into the e-diary, the site could have entered the information 
into the eCRF if the subject provided sufficient source documentation. Additionally, guidelines for use 
of FIX for subjects undergoing major surgery were added. 
In Amendment 4, the primary objective and endpoints were updated to include FIX activity after 52 
weeks of AMT-061 treatment and the non-inferiority assessment of AMT-061 during the post-treatment 
follow-up compared to standard of care continuous routine FIX prophylaxis during the lead-in phase, 
Assessment report

which were both previously secondary objectives/endpoints. This amendment also clarified that paper 
diaries were to be used during the long-term follow-up phase to document bleeding episodes and FIX 
use.  
In Amendment 5, the frequency of abdominal ultrasounds in the long-term follow-up phase was 
increased from yearly to every 6 months, and it was specified that abdominal ultrasounds could be 
performed at an unscheduled visit during the long-term follow-up, if judged relevant by the 
Investigator. It was clarified that subjects on continuous routine FIX prophylaxis during the long-term 
follow-up phase were required to contact the site staff immediately in case of a bleeding episode 
and/or FIX use different from their routine FIX prophylaxis, in addition to completing the paper diaries. 
Local laboratory assessments of FIX, ALT, and AST were added to the long-term follow-up. 
Additionally, possible options for causality assessments for AEs (related, probably related, possibly 
related, and not related) were updated to align with what was collected on the eCRFs. 
In Amendment 6, study objectives and endpoints were updated, based on input from the FDA. The 
Hemgenix, was updated to focus on ABR, 52 weeks following establishment of stable FIX expression 
(Months 6 to 18 post-treatment). The previous primary objectives and endpoints related to 
endogenous FIX activity at 6 months and 12 months were moved to be the first and second secondary 
efficacy endpoints, respectively, and endogenous FIX activity at 18 months after AMT-061 dosing was 
added as the third secondary efficacy endpoint. Estimated ABR as a function of pre-IMP anti-AAV5 
antibody titres using the luciferase based nAb assay was added as a secondary efficacy endpoint (as a 
“correlation” analysis).  
For the 6-month analyses, a less refined contamination rule was used, whereby the date of exogenous 
FIX infusion and the subsequent 9 days (10 discrete calendar days in total) were considered to be days 
of contamination with FIX. The 12-month and 18-month analyses used the more refined definition of 
contamination, based on 5 half-lives. It was clarified that the FAS Population would be used for all 
efficacy statistical analyses, with the PP Population used for sensitivity analyses. The definition of the 
PP Population was updated to clarify the timepoints used to identify the population for various data 
cuts. To align with the updated endpoints, the statistical analyses were also reordered and timing 
clarified. As the primary objective was adjusted to focus on ABR, the description of the number of 
subjects, the sample size, and sample size justification was updated, although the sample size 
remained at 50 subjects. Details on the interim and final analyses were updated. Clarification was 
added that during the long-term follow up, quarterly contact (±2 weeks) should occur to monitor for 
AEs, proper completion of study-specific paper diaries, and proper reporting of FIX usage and bleeding 
episodes. It was clarified that the calculation for the number of days until vector DNA can no longer be 
detected in blood and semen would be based on the first of three consecutive negative samples. 
Protocol Deviations 
The majority of protocol deviations were related to timing of study visits, questionnaire completion, or 
absence or incorrect performance of laboratory tests. The impact on the efficacy outcomes is 
considered to be minimal.

Person-time during the post-treatment period (on any day that began) within 5 half-lives subsequent to exogenous FIX use at risk of 
(having) a bleeding episode. Nevertheless, bleeding episodes during such person-time were still counted. 
1. Unadjusted ABR was calculated as the ratio of the number of bleeding episodes to the time of observation (in years). 
2. Adjusted ABR and comparison of ABR between the lead-in and post-treatment period was estimated from a repeated measures 
generalised estimating equations negative binomial regression model accounting for the paired design of the trial with an offset 
parameter to account for the differential collection periods. Treatment period was included as a categorical covariate. 
3. The upper limit of the confidence interval of the rate ratio was compared to the non-inferiority margin of 1.8. If the upper limit was less 
than 1.8, then non-inferiority was declared. 
4. One-sided p-value ≤0.025 for post-treatment/lead-in <1 was regarded as statistically significant. For Month 7-24, p-values not adjusted 
for multiplicity. 
The adjusted ABR for all bleeding episodes was reduced following AMT-061 treatment and stable FIX 
expression, from a rate of 4.19 (95% CI: 3.22, 5.45) for the ≥6-month lead-in period to 1.51 (95%

CI:0.81, 2.82) for Months 7 to 18 of the post-treatment period (64% reduction [95% CI: 36%, 80%; 
period was 0.36 (95% Wald CI: 0.20, 0.64). As the upper limit of the Wald CI was less than 1.8, non-
inferiority can be declared vs. the lead-in standard of care FIX prophylaxis. 
During the ≥6-month lead-in period (cumulative 33.12 person-years of observation), the majority of 
subjects who later received treatment (40/54 [74.1%]) experienced bleeding episodes. 
A total of 136 bleeding episodes were reported for the lead-in period, including 118 FIX-treated 
bleeding episodes. The majority of bleeding episodes (118/136) were very mild to moderate in 
severity; 14 severe and 4 very severe bleeding episodes were reported in 10/54 (18.5%) subjects and 
3/54 (5.6%) subjects, respectively. Traumatic and spontaneous bleeding episodes were reported in 
29/54 (53.7%) and 24/54 (44.4%) subjects, respectively. The most common locations of bleeding 
episodes in the lead-in period were joints (59.3%) and muscle (31.5%). 
During Months 7 to 18 of the post-treatment period, following AMT-061 treatment and stable FIX 
expression (cumulative 49.78 person-years observed), the majority of treated subjects (34/54 
[63.0%]) had zero bleeding episodes; bleeding episodes were reported in 20/54 (37.0%) subjects. 
During Months 7 to 18 of the post-treatment period, 54 bleeding episodes were reported including 30 
FIX-treated bleeding episodes. The majority of bleeding episodes (43/54) were very mild to moderate 
in severity; 7 severe and 2 very severe bleeding episodes were reported in 7/54 (13.0%) of subjects 
and 2/54 (3.7%) subjects, respectively and severity was missing for 2 episodes. Traumatic and 
spontaneous bleeding episodes were reported in 12/54 (22.2%) and 9/54 (16.7%) subjects, 
respectively. The most common locations of bleeding episodes during this post-treatment period were 
joint (20.4) and surface (14.8%). 
Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the ABR results. For FIX-treated bleeding 
episodes, the adjusted ABR was 3.65 (95% CI: 2.82, 4.74) for the ≥6-month lead-in period and 0.84 
(95% CI: 0.41, 1.73) for Months 7 to 18 of the post-treatment period (77% reduction [95% CI: 54%, 
88%, p <0.0001), with an observed ABR rate ratio for the Month 7 to 18 post-treatment period to 
lead-in period of 0.23 (95% Wald CI: 0.12, 0.46). Similar ABR results were observed for the Months 7 
to 18 post-treatment period when the analysis was conducted with the PP Population, irrespective of 
FIX use during the post-treatment period, including only new and true exogenous bleeding episodes, 
including only new and true exogenous FIX-treated bleeding episodes, and excluding person-time with 
contamination from systemic corticosteroids. 
Additionally, in the 53/54 subjects with baseline (i.e. pre-dose) anti-AAV5 nAb titre <3000, the mean 
adjusted ABR was 1.07 during Months 7 to 18, with an observed rate ratio of 0.28 (95% Wald CI: 
0.17, 0.43). 
ABR was significantly reduced during Months 7 to 18 after AMT-061 treatment compared to the lead-in 
period for most of the subgroups analysed, with rate ratios (post-treatment/lead-in) ranging from 0.16 
to 0.57 (p <0.025 for most subgroups (not adjusted for multiplicity). Exceptions to this included 
subjects with a positive anti-AAV5 nAb titre at baseline (N = 21; rate ratio = 1.77), non-White subjects 
(N = 14; rate ratio = 9.14), and subjects who had target joints at screening (N = 10; rate ratio = 
13.42); however, for these subgroups, the unadjusted ABR at Months 7 to 18 post-treatment was less 
than that for the lead-in period. In the ABR analysis, all bleeding episodes were counted but person-
time during the post-treatment period (on any day that began) within 5 half-lives subsequent to 
exogenous FIX use was not considered to be time at risk of (having) a bleeding episode, which may 
have led to higher subject estimates for some subgroups.  
The higher ABR rate ratio in the baseline anti-AAV5 nAb-positive subgroup was driven by a single 
subject with a pre-dose anti-AAV5 nAb titre of 3212.3. This subject did not respond to treatment with 
AMT-061 and was on prophylactic treatment, receiving 30 FIX injections during Months 7 to 18. Time

within 5 half-lives of a FIX injection was removed from the time at risk, which resulted in 
approximately one day (1.09 days) at risk during Months 7 to 12. During this time, this subject had 4 
spontaneous and 1 unknown bleeds, resulting in an ABR of 1673.97. When this subject was excluded 
from the analysis, superiority was reached for the baseline anti-AAV5 nAb-positive subgroup with an 
adjusted rate ratio of 0.30 (95% CI 0.15, 0.62).

1. “Uncontaminated” meant that the blood sampling did not occur within 5 half-lives of exogenous FIX use. Both the date and 
time of exogenous FIX use and blood sampling were considered in determining contamination. FIX levels beginning with 
the Week 3 assessment were used in the analysis. Subjects with zero uncontaminated central- laboratory post-AMT-061 
values had their change from baseline assigned to zero for this analysis, and had their post- baseline values set equal to their 
baseline value; however, the ratio of chromogenic to one-stage was not imputed. Baseline FIX was imputed based on 
subject’s historical hemophilia B severity documented on the case report form. If the subject had documented severe FIX 
deficiency (FIX plasma level <1%), their baseline FIX activity level was imputed as 1%. If the subject had documented 
moderately severe FIX deficiency (FIX plasma level ≥1% and ≤2%,) their baseline FIX activity level was imputed as 2%.

Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of these results. A similar change from baseline in 
FIX activity was observed when the analysis was conducted in the PP Population and when missing FIX 
levels were imputed subjects with 0, uncontaminated values were excluded, values contaminated by 
systemic corticosteroid exposure were excluded, and when the alternative FIX contamination rule was 
used. Similar results were observed in subjects with baseline anti-AAV5 nAb titre <3000. 
FIX activity levels measured by one-stage and chromogenic assay showed a similar discrepancy as in 
trial CT-AMT-061-01, with the chromogenic assay returning significantly lower levels of FIX activity.

Post-treatment period time was the number of days of observation within the time interval, excluding information prior to Day 21. 
1. Unadjusted infusion rate was calculated as the ratio of the number of infusions of FIX to the time of observation (in years). 
Usage related to invasive procedures was not included. 
2. Adjusted infusion rate and comparison of infusion rate between lead-in and post-treatment period was estimated from a repeated 
measures generalized estimating equations negative binomial regression model accounting for the paired design of the trial with 
an offset parameter to account for the differential collection periods. Treatment period was included as a categorical covariate. 
3. One-sided p-value ≤0.025 for post-treatment/lead-in <1 was regarded as statistically significant. For Month 7-18, p-value 
adjusted for multiplicity. 
Proportion of Subjects Remaining Free of Previous Continuous Routine Prophylaxis 
Following treatment with AMT-061, 52/54 (96.3%) subjects discontinued FIX prophylaxis and 
remained free of routine FIX prophylaxis from Day 21 through to Months 7 to 24. 
The other 2 subjects included a subject who received a partial dose of AMT-061 and a subject who had 
a high anti-AAV5 nAb titre at pre-dose (titre = 3212.3). 
Percentage of Subjects with Trough FIX Activity <12% of Normal 
The percentage of subjects attaining FIX activity <12% of normal (measured by the one-stage [aPTT-
based] assay) was compared between the lead-in period and post-treatment period; FIX activity levels 
within 5 half-lives of exogenous FIX use were not included in the analysis. 
By the end of the ≥6-month lead-in period, 43/54 (79.6%) subjects had FIX activity <12% of normal. 
Three months following treatment with AMT-061, FIX activity was <12% of normal in 4/51 (7.8%) 
subjects. This improvement in FIX activity was sustained through Month 12 of the post-treatment 
period, with 4/50 (8.0%) subjects having FIX activity <12% of normal.  At Month 18 and Month 24, 
there were 3/50 (6.0%) subjects and 5/50 (10.0%) subjects with FIX activity <12% of normal, 
respectively. 
Annualised Bleeding Rates: Superiority Assessment 
The ABR for all bleeding episodes during Months 7 to 18 was reduced by 64% following AMT-061 
treatment, with an observed ABR rate ratio for Months 7 to 18 of the post-treatment period to ≥6-
Assessment report

month lead-in period of 0.36 (95% Wald CI: 0.20, 0.64) and a one-sided p-value of 0.0002, 
demonstrating superiority of AMT-061 compared to standard of care routine FIX prophylaxis. 
Superiority of AMT-061 compared to standard of care routine FIX prophylaxis was also demonstrated 
with FIX-treated bleeding episodes. The ABR for FIX-treated bleeding episodes during Months 7 to 18 
was reduced by 77% following AMT-061 treatment, with an ABR for Months 7 to 18 of the post-
treatment period of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.41, 1.73) and a rate ratio (compared to lead-in) of 0.23 (Wald 
95% CI: 0.12, 0.46; p <0.0001). 
At Month 24, an analysis for ABR for all bleeding episodes and for FIX-treated episodes could show 
superiority over standard of care, but adjustment for multiplicity was not done for these results. 
Rate of Spontaneous Bleeding Episodes 
Table 9. Summary of Spontaneous Bleeding Episodes (Full Analysis Set) 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 67/149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Spontaneous bleeding episodes were only experienced by 16.7% of subjects at month 18 and 20.4% 
of subjects at month 24 post-treatment, while 44.4% of subjects reported such events during the lead-
in. This is considered a clinically relevant improvement over FIX-prophylaxis, because many 
spontaneous bleeds occur in joints and joint health continues to deteriorate over time despite 
prophylaxis.     
Rate of Joint Bleeding Episodes 
Table 10. Summary of Joint Bleeding Episodes (Full Analysis Set) 
20.4% of subjects reported joint bleeding episodes post-treatment until month 18, and 27.8% 
reported joint bleeds until month 24, while 59.3% of subjects reported such events during the lead-in, 
which is a clear improvement and represents a clinically meaningful benefit.

FIX Activity Levels and Anti-AAV5 Neutralizing Antibodies 
Overall, 21 subjects had pre-existing nAbs against AAV5 at baseline (i.e., pre-dose), prior to AMT-061 
treatment. Positivity for the presence of anti-AAV5 nAbs required a titre ≥LOD of 7. At baseline, anti-
AAV5 nAb titres were between LOD and <3000 (range: 8.5 to 678.2) for 20/54 (37.0%) subjects 
treated with AMT-061, and was 3212.3 for 1 subject (Subject 15-42-259). Sensitivity analyses 
conducted within the FAS population for subjects with baseline anti-AAV5 nAb titre <3000 did not 
include data for this subject. 
Baseline mean (SD) FIX activity was similar between subjects with pre-existing anti-AAV5 nAbs (1.24 
[0.44]%) and those without pre-existing anti-AAV5 nAbs (1.15 [0.36]%; Table 17). At Month 6 post-
treatment with AMT-061, FIX activity was 35.91% and 40.61% for subjects with and without pre-
existing anti-AAV5 nAbs, respectively, and was significantly increased from baseline with LS mean 
increases of 30.79% (95% CI: 23.26, 38.32; p <0.0001) and 39.46% (95% CI:33.23, 45.69; p 
<0.0001), respectively. At Month 12 post-treatment, FIX activity was 35.54% and 44.82% of normal 
for subjects with and without pre-existing anti-AAV5 nAbs. At 18 months post-treatment, FIX activity 
was 31.14% and 39.87% for subjects with and without pre-existing anti-AAV5 nAbs, respectively, with 
LS mean increases from baseline of 26.83% (95% CI: 19.24, 34.41; p <0.0001) and 38.72% (95% 
CI: 32.49, 44.95; p <0.0001), respectively. At 24 months post-treatment, mean FIX activity was 
32.98% and 38.55% for subjects with and without pre-existing anti-AAV5 NAbs, respectively, with LS 
mean increases from baseline of 28.35% (95% CI: 20.62, 36.08; p <0.0001) and 37.40% (95% CI: 
31.64, 43.16; p <0.0001), respectively.

Treatment Period for Subjects With and Without Pre-Existing Neutralizing Antibodies to

Both subjects with and without anti-AAV nAbs at baseline responded to treatment with AMT-061, with 
the exception of one subject with a baseline anti-AAV nAb titre >3000.  
However, while baseline FIX levels were equally low in both subgroups, the increase of FIX activity 
appears to be higher in those subjects without anti-AAV nAbs.      
Correlation of FIX Activity Levels at Month 18 with pre-IMP Neutralizing Antibodies to AAV5 
Titres 
Neutralizing antibodies were present in 21/54 (38.9%) subjects at baseline, prior to AMT-061 
treatment. The linear regression indicated a trend to lower mean FIX activity in subjects with anti-
AAV5 nAbs at baseline. However, no clinically meaningful correlation between an individual’s titre of 
pre-existing anti-AAV5 nAbs with their FIX activity at 18 months or at 24 months post-treatment was 
identified up to a nAb titre of 3212.3 (18-month Pearson coefficient: -0.35; Spearman coefficient: -
0.30; R2: 0.124; 24-month Pearson coefficient: -0.36; Spearman coefficient: -0.29; R2: 0.129). 
Additionally, the primary endpoint of ABR was met in both subjects with or without pre-existing anti-
AAV5 nAbs at baseline. One subject with a titre of 3212.3 for pre-existing anti-AAV5 nAbs at screening 
did not respond to treatment with AMT-061, and similar results were observed when this subject was 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 70/149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
excluded from the correlation. This subject ended the study early, having withdrawn consent after 24 
months post-treatment (Month 24 visit not completed). 
Similar results were observed when the arithmetic mean FIX activity across Month 6 to Month 18 or to 
Month 24 was considered, when subjects with baseline anti-AAV5 nAb titre <3000 were included, and 
when the correlation of FIX activity with anti-AAV5 nAb titre at the lead-in final visit was assessed. 
However, the lack of a statistically significant correlation between the presence of neutralizing 
antibodies at baseline and mean FIX activity could primarily be an artefact of the small sample size. As 
the applicant has noted, the linear regression does indeed indicate a trend of lower FIX activity in 
subjects with anti-AAV5 nAbs at baseline.  
Target Joints 
A target joint was defined as 3 or more spontaneous bleeding episodes into a single joint within a 
consecutive 6-month period prior to the dosing visit and which was not resolved by the time of dosing. 
An identified target joint with ≤2 spontaneous bleeding episodes within a consecutive 12-month period 
was considered resolved. 
At dosing, 2 subjects had pre-existing targets joints, which resolved during the post-treatment period. 
The time to resolution of target joints for these subjects was 121 and 327 days post-AMT-061 
treatment. 
One subject had a new target joint (left knee joint) that occurred during the post-treatment period 
after stable FIX expression on Day 381, which was not resolved at the data cut-off for this report. 
The one patient who developed the target joint was the patient with the baseline anti-AAV nAb titre of 
3212.3, who was a non-responder to treatment with Hemgenix. No responder developed a new target 
joint during the available observation period of 24 months.      
Subjects with Zero Bleeding Episodes 
The number (%) of subjects with zero bleeding episodes increased following treatment with AMT-061, 
from 14/54 (25.9%) subjects during the ≥6-month lead-in period to 34/54 (63.0%) subjects 
during the Month 7 to 18 post-treatment period. A higher number of subjects (27/54 [50.0%]) had 
zero bleeding episodes during the Month 7 to 24 post-treatment period compared to the lead-in period. 
For subjects with a negative baseline anti-AAV5 nAb titre, 11/33 (33.3%) subjects had 0 bleeding 
episodes during the lead-in period and 23/33 (69.7%) and 19/33 (57.6%) subjects had 0 bleeding 
episodes during the Month 7 to 18 and Month 7 to 24post-treatment periods, respectively.  
For subjects with a positive baseline anti-AAV5 nAb titre, 3/21 (14.3%) subjects had 0 bleeding 
episodes during the lead-in period and 11/21 (52.4%) and 8/21 (38.1%) subjects had 0 bleeding 
episodes during Months 7 to 18 and Month 7 to 24 post-treatment periods, respectively. 
International Physical Activity Questionnaire 
The iPAQ assesses physical activity undertaken across a comprehensive set of domains including 
leisure time, domestic and gardening (yard) activities, and work and transport-related activity. Based 
on the repeated measures linear mixed model, the numerical difference in iPAQ scores between the 
Lead in and Post-treatment Periods was not significant, with a LS mean (SE) difference of -721.2 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 71/149 
 
 
 
(528.61; 95% CI: -1770.6, 328.3; p-value = 0.9121). Between 12 and 24 months (i.e., Year 2) post-
treatment, the LS mean (SE) difference was -785.8 (553.40; 95% CI: -1896.8, 325.2; p = 0.9191). 
EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels VAS Scores 
The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system of health-related QoL states consists of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-
care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire consists of the 
EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ VAS which reflects the patient's perception of their overall 
health on a scale from 0 to 100. No notable difference between the lead-in and post-treatment periods 
was observed with a LS mean (SE) difference of 0.1 (1.84; 95% CI: -3.5, 3.8; p-value 0.4753). 
However, in the second year post-treatment there was a statistically significant improvement in the 
mean EQ-5D-5L VAS scores with a LS mean (SE) difference between 12 and 24 months (i.e., Year 2) 
post-treatment of 2.8 (1.40; 95% CI: 0.0, 5.6; p = 0.0244 [not adjusted for multiplicity]). 
In the IPAQ and EQ-5D-5L scores, at 18 months post treatment no improvement could be observed. At 
24 months, the IPAQ did not show significant changes, but the EQ-5Q-5L score could detect an 
improvement between year 1 and year 2. Most subjects already received state of the art FIX 
prophylaxis with extended half-life products, therefore the burden of infusions is relatively low and it is 
more difficult to demonstrate an additional beneficial effect.    
Exploratory Efficacy Measures 
FIX protein levels 
During the 18 months post-AMT-061 treatment, FIX protein levels fluctuated across visits and ranged 
from 19.35% to 25.25%. FIX protein levels during the post-treatment period followed a similar trend 
to FIX activity by one-stage (aPTT-based) activity; however, more variability was observed in the 
protein concentrations. 
The mean ratio of uncontaminated FIX activity to protein was 5.867 at Week 3, increasing to 8.078 at 
Week 10. The mean ratio of FIX activity to FIX protein level was stable at approximately 7 to 8.5 
between Month 6 and Month 18. 
Haemophilia Joint Health Score 
The HJHS measures joint health, in the domain of body structure and function (i.e., impairment), of 
the joints most commonly affected by bleeding in haemophilia: the knees, ankles, and elbows. The 
total score ranges from 0 to 124, with higher scores considered unfavourable. 
Mean (SD) HJHS at screening was 20.8. At the end of the lead-in period, mean (SD) HJHS in the FAS 
was 21.2 (16.9; Table 21). Following 12 months of treatment with AMT-061, mean (SD) HJHS was 
19.5 (16.8). The LS mean (SE) difference in HJHS score between the lead-in and post-treatment 
periods was -1.7 (0.79; 95% CI: -3.3, -0.1; p-value: 0.0196 [not adjusted for multiplicity]). 
A minimal improvement in the HJHS could be detected. However, the HJHS is primarily designed for 
children with haemophilia aged 4-18 years with mild joint impairment and has not yet been adequately 
studied for use in adults or more severe joint disease, therefore these outcomes have to be interpreted 
with caution. 
Rate of Traumatic Bleeding Episodes 
During the lead-in period, 29/54 (53.7%) subjects experienced 70 traumatic bleeding episodes. During 
the Month 7 to 18 post-treatment period, there were 30 traumatic bleeding episodes in 12/54 (22.2%) 
subjects, including 16 episodes in 9 (16.7%) subjects during the Month 7 to 12 period and 14 episodes 
in 7 (13.0%) subjects during the Month 13 to 18 period.  
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 72/149 
 
 
 
 
The mean number of traumatic bleeding episodes per subject decreased following treatment with AMT-
061 (1.3 during lead-in period to 0.3 during both the Month 7 to 12 and Month 13 to 18 post-
treatment period). The ABR of traumatic bleeding episodes decreased following AMT-061 treatment, 
from 2.09 (95% CI: 1.42, 3.08) for the lead-in period to 0.62 (95% CI: 0.31, 1.23) for the Month 7 to 
18 post-treatment period. 
Traumatic bleeding episodes treated with FIX included 58 episodes in 26/54 (48.1%) subjects during 
the lead-in period and 11 episodes in 9/54 (16.7%) subjects during the Month 7 to 18 period. For FIX-
treated traumatic bleeding episodes, the ABR decreased from 1.74 (95% CI: 1.21, 2.49) for the lead-
in period to 0.22 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.45) for the Month 7 to 18 post-treatment period.  
Patient-Reported Outcomes, Burdens, and Experiences (PROBE) Questionnaire Sub-Study 
The mean (SD) PROBE summary scores were similar between screening (0.778 [0.161]) and the end 
of the lead-in period (0.787 [0.166]). The mean (SD) PROBE summary score was 0.811 (0.168) at 
Month 12 post-treatment with AMT-061. The mean PROBE scores for males and females without 
bleeding disorders were reported as 0.909 and 0.869 respectively. While there still appears to be a 
decrement in QoL compared to subjects with no bleeding disorders, the mean scores in AMT-061-
treated subjects were higher in the post-treatment period compared to the lead-in period. 
More research is needed in the future to ascertain what constitutes a clinically meaningful change in 
PROBE scores with a therapeutic intervention. 
Work Productivity and Activity Impairment 
The WPAI assesses the effect of health problems on a subjects’ ability to work and perform regular 
activities. It consists of 4 domains including absenteeism (defined as the percent of time missed work 
due to health problems), presenteeism (defined as percent impairment while working), work 
productivity loss (which is a combination of absenteeism and presenteeism), and activity impairment. 
During the lead-in period, mean absenteeism in the FAS was 4.97%, 5.95%, and 4.54% at the 
baseline, Month 4, and final lead-in period visits, respectively. During the post-treatment period, mean 
absenteeism was 6.45% at baseline and then was 0.51% and 0.71% at the post-treatment Month 6 
and Month 12 visits, respectively. During the lead-in period, presenteeism was 21.16%, 19.71%, and 
16.06% at the baseline, Month 4, and the final lead-in period visits, respectively. During the post-
treatment period, baseline mean presenteeism was 17.61% and was 11.35% and 10.98% at the post-
treatment Month 6 and Month 12 visits, respectively. Activity impairment levels were similar between 
the lead-in and post-treatment periods. 
Brief Pain Inventory 
The BPI evaluates the severity of a subject’s pain and the impact of this pain on the subject’s daily 
functioning. Pain was assessed on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can image), and the 
level of pain interference with various activities was assessed on a scale of 0 (did not interfere) to 10 
(completely interfered). 
Based on the repeated measures linear mixed model, controlling for the effect of period, visit, and 
period-by-visit interaction, pain intensity decreased numerically following treatment with AMT-061, 
with a LS mean (SE) difference of -0.25 (0.143; 95% CI: -0.53, 0.04; p-value 0.0431 [not adjusted for 
multiplicity]. 
The numerical decrease in pain interference scores between the lead-in and post-treatment periods 
was not significant, with a LS mean (SE) difference of -0.21 (0.161; 95% CI: -0.52, 0.11; p-value 
0.1023 [not adjusted for multiplicity].

Haemophilia Activities List 
The HAL measures the impact of haemophilia on self-perceived functional abilities within 8 modules. 
The difficulty due to haemophilia in the previous month for the domains of each module were assessed 
as either: impossible, always a problem, mostly a problem, sometimes a problem, rarely a problem, or 
never a problem. 
Based on the repeated measures linear mixed model controlling for the effect period, visit, and period-
by-visit interaction, the numerical difference in HAL scores between the lead-in and post-treatment 
periods was not significant with a LS mean (SE) difference of 1.16 (1.287; 95% CI: -1.38, 3.71; p-
value 0.1843 [not adjusted for multiplicity]; 
Haemophilia Specific Quality of Life Index 
The Hem-A-QoL captures aspects of QoL for adult subjects with hemophilia within 10 domains. The 
response options for each question were never, rarely, sometimes, often, or all the time. Scores 
ranged from 0 to 100; lower Hem-A-QoL scores represent a better QoL and higher scores are indicative 
of lower QoL. 
A one-sided p-value ≤0.025 for the post-treatment vs lead-in period was considered statistically 
significant. The analyses were not adjusted for multiplicity. Significant model-based mean differences 
in scores compared with the lead-in period were noted for the Total Score (LS mean -5.50; <0.0001), 
and were also noted for the domains “Treatment” (LS mean -14.88; p<0.0001), “Feelings” (LS mean -
9.42; p<0.0001), “Future” (LS mean -5.02; p = 0.0023), and “Work/School” (LS mean -4.99; p = 
0.0036). 
EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels Index Scores 
The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system of health-related QoL states on which the index scores are based 
consist of 5 domains including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression. 
Based on the repeated measures linear mixed model, controlling for the effect of period, visit, and 
period-by-visit interaction, there was a numerical improvement in EuroQol index scores in the post-
treatment period compared to the lead-in period, but it was not statistically significant at the p = 0.025 
threshold. The LS mean (SE) was 0.0310 (0.01903; 95% CI: -0.0067, 0.0686; p-value: 0.0530 [not 
adjusted for multiplicity]). 
Minimal or no improvements could be detected in the WPAI, BPI, HAL and EQ-5D-5L. 
A minimal clinically important improvement was identified as a 10-point reduction in the 'Physical 
Health' and 'Sports & Leisure' domains, and a 7-point reduction in 'Total Score' for the Hem-A-QoL in 
Wyrwich et al, Haemophilia. 2015 Sep;21(5):578-84. Therefore, while the reported improvements 
were considered statistically significant, their clinical relevance is borderline, which is in line with other 
outcomes reported from PRO endpoints. 
As already mentioned with regard to the secondary endpoints IPAQ and EQ-5D-5L, most patients 
received prophylaxis with EHL FIX products, and it is difficult to demonstrate increased benefit as the 
burden of treatment is relatively low, with FIX infusions necessary every 7-14 days. However, it is 
possible that the significantly decreased bleeding rate could lead to improved PRO scores at later 
observation time-points as e.g. joint health will be preserved in the long-term.

When n <10 and for subgroups based on “Lead-In Bleed Count Category”, model-based statistics were not calculated. No Lead-In-
Period statistics were provided for subgroups based on “Lead-In Bleed Count Category”. 
1. Adjusted ABR and comparison of ABR between lead-in and post-treatment period was estimated from a repeated measures 
generalized estimating equations negative binomial regression model accounting for the paired design of the trial with an offset 
parameter to account for the differential collection periods. Treatment period was included as a categorical covariate. Lead-in 
period data for the Month 7 to 24 comparisons not shown in table; these data are available in the outputs listed below as Source 
for Month 7 to 24. 
2. The upper limit of the confidence interval of the rate ratio was compared to the non-inferiority margin of 1.8. If the upper limit 
was less than 1.8, then non-inferiority was declared. 
3. One-sided p-value ≤0.025 for post-treatment/lead-in <1 was regarded as statistically 
significant p- values not adjusted for multiplicity. 
ABR was significantly reduced during Months 7 to 18 after AMT-061 treatment compared to the lead-in 
period for most of the subgroups analysed, with rate ratios (post-treatment/lead-in) ranging from 0.16 
to 0.57 (p <0.025 for most subgroups (not adjusted for multiplicity). Exceptions to this included 
subjects with a positive anti-AAV5 nAb titre at baseline (N = 21; rate ratio = 1.77), non-White subjects 
(N = 14; rate ratio = 9.14), and subjects who had target joints at screening (N = 10; rate ratio = 
13.42); however, for these subgroups, the unadjusted ABR at Months 7 to 18 post-treatment was less 
than that for the lead-in period. In the ABR analysis, all bleeding episodes were counted but person-
time during the post-treatment period (on any day that began) within 5 half-lives subsequent to 
exogenous FIX use was not considered to be time at risk of (having) a bleeding episode, which may 
have led to higher subject estimates for some subgroups.

With the responses to the D120 LoQ, the applicant provided an ABR subgroup analysis for those 
subjects who required corticosteroid treatment due to elevated transaminases. The ABR is comparable 
to that of subjects who did not require corticosteroid treatment and significantly reduced compared to 
the run-in period.

Measurement of FIX activity did not occur within 5 half-lives of exogenous FIX use. Subjects with central-laboratory post-AMT-
061 values in this timeframe had their change from baseline assigned to zero for this analysis. 
1. Baseline FIX was imputed based on subject’s historical hemophilia B severity documented on the case report form. If the 
subject had documented severe FIX deficiency (FIX plasma level <1%), their baseline FIX activity level was imputed as 1%. 
If the subject had documented moderately severe FIX deficiency (FIX plasma level ≥1% and 
≤2%,) their baseline FIX activity level was imputed as 2%.

For all subgroups, calculated FIX activity was significantly higher at Month 18 post-AMT-061 
administration compared to baseline (p <0.0001, not adjusted for multiplicity). Mean FIX activity 
ranged between 1.00% and 1.29% at baseline and LS mean increases from baseline ranged between 
23.42% and 39.72% of normal across subgroups. Numerical differences within some subgroups were 
noted, especially for the subgroup of 9 subjects who received systemic corticosteroids post-AMT-061 
treatment. This subgroup achieved the lowest mean FIX activity levels at 14.33%. All other subgroups 
showed approximately double or higher FIX activity. 
Effect of Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors on FIX Activity 
Effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on uncontaminated FIX activity was evaluated in the 
pharmacokinetic (PK) population, defined as subjects receiving a full dose of etranacogene 
dezaparvovec and have at least 1 post dose FIX activity measurement in Study CT-AMT-061-02. 
A trend of higher mean FIX activity with increase in age was observed. Whilst there were differences in 
mean FIX activity levels between the subgroups, especially between the < 40 years and ≥ 60 years of 
age subgroups, the impact of age on FIX activity as an independent variable cannot be established. 
The mean FIX activity for the < 40 years of age subgroup was > 30% of normal activity at Month 6 to 
18, and all subjects in this subgroup achieved a FIX activity level within the mild to non-haemophilia B 
range; the minimum FIX activity level at Month 6 to 18 was at least 8%. 
Subjects with mild renal impairment (N = 7/53; PK population) had slightly higher mean FIX activity 
(up to 37% relative difference) compared to those with normal renal function during Month 6 to 18 
post dose. One subject with moderate renal impairment in the study had similar FIX activity as 
subjects with normal renal function. The impact of moderate renal impairment, severe renal 
impairment, and end stage renal disease on FIX activity could not be fully assessed due to either

limited (“moderate”) or no (“severe”, and “end stage renal disease”) subject representation of these 
subgroups.  
Subjects with steatosis Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) scores of ≥ S2 (≥ 260 decibels / meter 
[dB/m]), < S2 (< 260 dB/m) and missing score showed no clinically meaningful difference in the mean 
FIX activity levels. Evaluation of the impact of race, ethnicity, body mass index, and baseline FIX 
activity at the time of historical diagnosis on FIX activity showed that all subgroups within each of 
these variables had clinically meaningful increases in FIX activity post dose. 
Thirteen out of 53 subjects who received a full dose of etranacogene dezaparvovec experienced alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) elevation (ALT > upper limit of normal [ULN] when the baseline ALT is below 
ULN, or ALT > 2 × baseline value, occurring over the initial 90 days post dose) and 9 subjects were 
treated with corticosteroids for ALT elevation of either > ULN (n = 8) or > 2 × baseline value (n = 1). 
Subjects with ALT elevation had approximately 44% lower mean FIX activity at Month 18 compared to 
those that did not have ALT elevation. The 9/53 subjects that were treated with corticosteroid for ALT 
elevations exhibited approximately 63% lower mean FIX activity at Month 18 compared to those who 
did not receive corticosteroid co-administration. The mean FIX activity in the limited number of 
subjects (n = 9) treated with corticosteroids for ALT elevations was > 15% of normal and mean FIX 
activity levels remained in the mild hemophilia B range across all time points.  
Different drug product batches used in Study CT-AMT-061-02 showed no notable differences in the 
mean FIX activity at 6, 12, and18 months after etranacogene dezaparvovec administration. 
Due to the small number of subjects in each subgroup, outcomes have to be interpreted with caution. 
The subgroup of subjects demonstrating appreciably lower FIX activity levels was comprised of those 
patients who experienced an ALT elevation post AMT-061 treatment and especially those patients who 
received corticosteroids as a consequence. The highest FIX activity during months 7-18 in a patient 
treated with corticosteroids was ~30% and the lowest only 4.5%.

The linear regression indicated a trend to lower mean FIX activity in subjects 
with anti-AAV5 NAbs at baseline. However, no clinically meaningful correlation 
between an individual’s titre of preexisting anti-AAV5 NAbs with their FIX 
activity at 18 months post dose was identified up to a NAb titre of 3212.3 
(Pearson coefficient: -0.35; Spearman coefficient: -0.30; R2: 0.124. The 
primary endpoint of ABR was met in both subgroups, with or without 
preexisting anti-AAV5 NAbs at baseline. One subject with a titre of 3212.3 for 
preexisting anti-AAV5 NAbs at screening did not respond to treatment with 
etranacogene dezaparvovec, and similar results were observed when this 
subject was excluded from the correlation analysis.

2.6.5.4.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy 
The LUC-based AAV5-specific Neutralizing Antibody Assay has been adequately analytically validated, 
generally in line with the current ICH guidance for selectivity, specificity, precision, sensitivity, 
linearity, cross-reactivity, analytical cut point, carry-over, and sample stability.  
According to the applicant, the assay is CE marked to Council Directive 98/79/EC, In-Vitro Diagnostic 
Medical Device Directive (IVDD). 
The anti-AAV5 nAb assay used in Study CT-AMT-061-02 was planned to be utilised to screen patients 
previously diagnosed with haemophilia B to aid in the identification of patients with anti-AAV5 nAb levels 
who  are  eligible  for  treatment  with  etranacogene  dezaparvovec.  The  cut-off  titre  proposed  by  the 
applicant  to  confirm  treatment  eligibility  with  Hemgenix  was  <1:700.  This  proposal  is  based  on  data 
from the pivotal trial where one subject with a nAb titre >1:3000 at baseline was found to be a non-
responder to treatment with AMT-061, while all other twenty subjects who exhibited anti-AAV5 nAbs at 
baseline developed clinically relevant FIX activity levels and could terminate prophylaxis with exogenous 
FIX  products.  These  subjects  were  found  to  have  titres  up  to  1:678.2  at  baseline,  and  apart  from 
increased  FIX  activity  they  also  reported  a  statistically  significantly  reduced  annualised  bleeding  rate 
compared  to  the  lead-in  period  using  their  ususal  FIX  prophylaxis.  After  etranacogene  dezaparvovec 
administration, all 53 subjects developed detectable anti-AAV5 NAbs by Week 3 (median titre of 1:8,748; 
ULOQ titre = 1:8,748) which remained elevated through to Month 24 post dose. 
However, in order to avoid a restriction of the indication with this arbitrary cut-off limit based on data 
from one patient only, the CAT requested to further investigate the effectiveness of Hemgenix in a post-
authorisation efficacy study regardless of the preexisting anti-AAV5 nAb titre (PAES).  
2.6.5.5.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Integrated Analysis of Durability of Response 
An integrated exploratory analysis was performed on durability of response for etranacogene 
dezaparvovec for the treatment of haemophilia B. Two clinical studies were included: Study CT-AMT-
061-01 and Study CT-AMT-061-02. The analysis used Month 6 post dose data as the baseline level, 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 87/149 
 
 
 
 
 
while sensitivity analyses were performed using Month 3 post dose data as the baseline. The Month 6 
baseline was chosen because a stable FIX activity level was observed by this time point, with most 
subjects not requiring prophylactic FIX replacement therapy or corticosteroid use for ALT elevation. 
The non-responder subject and the subject who received a partial dose were excluded from the 
durability analysis. Fifty-two out of 54 (96.3%) subjects did not need continuous prophylactic FIX 
replacement therapy from Day 21 through to Months 7 to 18, and the maximum duration of 
corticosteroid use for ALT elevation was 130 days in Study CT-AMT-061-02. 
Additional supportive information on durability of response was provided by the proof-of-concept and 
FIH study of AMT-060 (the predecessor to etranacogene dezaparvovec), Study CT-AMT-060-01. 
The primary objective of the integrated exploratory analysis was to characterise the durability of effect 
of etranacogene dezaparvovec in haemophilia B subjects. Study CT-AMT-061-01 and Study CT-AMT-
061-02 were pooled for the integrated analysis. 
The Durability of Effect Population included subjects who were enrolled, entered the Lead-in Period 
(the Lead-in Period was for Study CT-AMT-061-02 only), received a full dose of etranacogene 
dezaparvovec, and had at least 1 full year of assessments for FIX expression measured by FIX activity 
levels and FIX protein expression, and have baseline anti-AAV5 nab titre < 1:3,000. A total of 55 
subjects (3 from Study CT-AMT-061-01 and 52 from Study CT-AMT-061-02) were part of the Durability 
of Effect Population. The analysis population for durability of response was the Durability of Effect 
Population, with supportive analyses using the AMT-060 Population. The AMT-060 Population included 
subjects in Study CT-AMT-060-01 who received 1 of 2 doses of AMT-060 and had at least 1 full year of 
assessments for FIX expression, measured by FIX activity levels and FIX protein expression. All 10 
subjects from Study CT-AMT-060-01 were part of the AMT-060 Population. FIX activity (measured by 
one-stage [aPTT-based] assay) or FIX protein concentration values that were measured more than 5 
half-lives after most recent FIX-replacement administration (uncontaminated values) were included in 
the durability analysis. 
Percentage change and absolute change in uncontaminated FIX activity or FIX protein concentration 
from Month 6 (baseline) to each time point after Month 6 was evaluated using a linear mixed-effects 
repeated model, controlling for the fixed effects of Month 6 (baseline) FIX value and time point wherein 
the time point was treated as a categorical variable. In all analyses where convergence was achieved, 
a first-order autoregressive covariance structure provided the best fit as assessed by visual 
examination of the residuals along with goodness-of-fit test statistics output by the Statistical Analysis 
System (SAS) procedure MIXED. 
Subgroup analysis was also conducted for durability in both FIX activity and FIX protein levels with an 
added covariate to define the subgroup, as well as adding an interaction term with visit. The following 
subgroups were evaluated: baseline anti-AAV5 nAb titre (positive / negative), ALT increase resulting in 
corticosteroid treatment (yes / no), and baseline FIX level (moderate / severe). 
Durability of FIX Activity Levels 
The analysis of durability of uncontaminated FIX activity levels, as measured by one-stage (aPTT-
based) assay, for the pooled etranacogene dezaparvovec studies (Study CT-AMT-061-01 and Study 
CT-AMT-061-02) assessed as change from baseline and percent change from baseline showed that the 
least square (LS) mean FIX activity levels at Months 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 18 were not statistically 
significantly different from the baseline at Month 6 (Figure 4). 
Similar to the FIX activity level changes for the time points shown above, FIX activity estimates at 
Month 24 showed a lack of difference from the Month 6 baseline. However, these were based on a 
limited sample size (n = 6 at Month 24) and data from additional subjects is needed to confirm this 
observation.

Change from Month 6 Baseline (B) in FIX Activity Level (One-Stage [aPTT-based] Assay) 
after Etranacogene Dezaparvovec Administration (Durability of Effect Population) 
A sensitivity analysis was performed on the change in FIX activity level from baseline at Month 3, 
which showed a gradual increase over time of no more than 5% of normal mean activity up to Month 
12 and no significant difference from Month 3 baseline at Months 18 and 24. 
The durability analysis of change in FIX activity levels from baseline (Month 6) for AMT-060 at 2 dose 
levels (5 × 1012 gc/kg and 2 × 1013 gc/kg) was evaluated as supportive evidence (Durability and PK

Analysis). At both dose levels, the FIX activity levels at almost all time points up to 5 years were not 
statistically significantly different from the Month 6 baseline, with the exception of a marginal increase 
from baseline FIX activity at Months 12 and 24 at the high dose and at Month 54 at the low dose of 
1.55%, 1.59%, and 4.53% of normal activity, respectively. A sensitivity analysis performed on the 
change in FIX activity level from baseline (Month 3) for the AMT-060 study showed similar durability 
up to 5 years from the Month 3 baseline. 
FIX Activity Levels and FIX Protein Levels by Baseline anti-AAV5 nAb 
The effect of preexisting anti-AAV5 nAbs on FIX activity levels after etranacogene dezaparvovec 
administration was evaluated by comparing FIX levels in subjects with and without preexisting anti-
AAV5 nAbs in Study CT-AMT-061-02 (Baseline AAV5 nAb Titre Positive, N=20; PK Population). 
At Month 6 to 18 post dose, subjects with and without preexisting anti-AAV5 nAbs had significant 
increases from baseline in FIX activity. No clinically meaningful differences in the mean FIX activity 
were observed between the 2 subgroups (up to 22% [at Month 18] lower FIX activity in subjects with 
preexisting anti-AAV5 nAbs relative to those without preexisting anti-AAV5 nAbs) at different time 
points post dose.  
Although there was a trend of lower FIX activity in subjects with higher preexisting anti-AAV5 nAb 
titre, no clinically meaningful correlation between an individual’s titre of preexisting anti-AAV5 nAbs 
with their FIX activity at 18 months post-treatment was identified up to an anti-AAV5 nAb titre of 
1:3,212.3 (Pearson coefficient: -0.35; Spearman coefficient: -0.30; R2: 0.124. 
FIX Activity Levels and FIX Protein Levels by Corticosteroid Use for ALT Elevation 
After etranacogene dezaparvovec administration, 9 of 52 subjects in Study CT-AMT-061-02 had 
increased ALT treated with corticosteroids, while none of the 3 subjects in Study CT-AMT-061-01 had 
increased ALT treated with corticosteroids. 
Mean FIX activity and FIX protein levels after etranacogene dezaparvovec administration at Months 6 
to 18 were lower in subjects with ALT elevation treated with corticosteroids (9/55) (with the mean FIX 
activity was ≥ 15% of normal after Month 6), compared to the rest of the subjects in the studies 
(46/55) (Durability and PK Analysis). However, despite lower FIX activity in subjects using 
corticosteroids for ALT elevation, the durability of FIX activity response measured as change from 
baseline of FIX activity was sustained and generally not significantly different up to Month 18 from 
Month 6 baseline in both the subgroups with the exception of marginal change from baseline (Month 6) 
of -3.17% at Month 18 in subjects treated with corticosteroids for ALT elevation and < 3 % at Months 
10 and 12 in the rest of the subjects (Table 14). 
FIX Activity Levels and FIX Protein Levels by Baseline FIX Level 
Based on FIX activity level at the time of diagnosis for subjects that received etranacogene 
dezaparvovec, 10/52 subjects in study CT-AMT-061-02 and 1/3 subjects in study CT-AMT-061-01 had 
moderately severe haemophilia (≤ 2% of normal activity) while the rest of the subjects had severe 
haemophilia (≤ 1% of normal activity). 
Mean FIX activity and FIX protein levels after etranacogene dezaparvovec administration at 6 to 18 
months were slightly lower in moderately severe haemophilia B subjects compared to those in severe 
haemophilia B subjects. 
The provided analyses on the durability of endogenous FIX activity showed that, compared to month 6 
as a baseline, there was a slight decline of FIX activity in the overall population at month 18. Data 
from study CT-AMT-060-01 also show a slow decline over a period of up to five years. 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 90/149 
 
 
 
However, in all investigated subgroups (i.e. baseline anti-AAV5 nAb positive, treated with 
corticosteroids and suffering from moderate haemophilia), the decline was more pronounced, and this 
steeper decline occurred on top of lower FIX activity achieved at month 6. Therefore, it is likely that 
those subgroups will lose the benefit of endogenous FIX markedly earlier than patients without such 
influencing factors. 
2.6.5.6.  Supportive study 
The open-label, uncontrolled study CT-AMT-060-01 was conducted with AAV5-hFIXco (AMT-060), the 
predecessor of etranacogene dezaparvovec, and is therefore considered supportive only.  
No lead-in period was included, but a one-year observation period, during which historically reported 
bleeding episodes were documented. Two dose levels were administered with intra- and inter-cohort 
staggering intervals between IMP administrations for safety reasons. For the purpose of this study, this 
design is considered appropriate. 
Five subjects each were enrolled in the lower dose Cohort 1 and higher dose Cohort 2. Demographic 
baseline data were generally balanced between cohorts, except the mean age, which was higher for 
subjects in Cohort 1 compared to Cohort 2 (60.2 years vs. 38.2 years). The explanation provided by 
the applicant can be followed.   
The primary objective was to assess the 5-year safety profile of AMT-060, which was within the 
expected range. Most TEAE were mild or moderate in severity, one SAE of myelopathy was categorised 
as severe, not treatment-related, and resolved by study completion. Three SAEs (hepatic enzyme 
increased, pyrexia, ALT increased) were considered treatment-related, and the remaining SAEs (renal 
colic, calculus ureteric, myelopathy) were considered not (or unlikely) related by the Investigator, 
which can be agreed with based on the provided information. Three TEAE qualifying for special 
notification involving increased liver parameters were reported and treated with corticosteroids. 
Increased liver parameters are expected due to the mode of action of the IMP.  
One death occurred outside the study period. The investigator assessed the relationship between AMT-
060 and death as being unlikely related. 
After treatment with AMT-060, the mean endogenous FIX activity levels in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 
ranged from 2.8% to 8.2% and 4.0% to 10.7% of normal based upon the one-stage (aPTT-based) FIX 
assay, respectively, and remained stable during the post-tapering period (i.e., after discontinuation of 
FIX prophylaxis post-AMT-060 administration) up to 5 years. Accordingly, the use of FIX replacement 
therapy and mean ABR were reduced after treatment with AMT-060 in both dose cohorts. Baseline as 
well as outcome data were more favourable in the higher dose Cohort 2, which could partially be 
attributed to the lower age. 
No data are yet available for the corresponding long-term extension study CT-AMT-060-04, which is 
still ongoing. CSR is expected in September 2026 and will be reviewed during a later time point. 
Overall, the safety and efficacy profile of AMT-060 would support a favourable benefit/risk balance of 
etranacogene dezaparvovec. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical efficacy dataset of this marketing authorisation application is based on the results of two 
clinical trials investigating AMT-061 at a dose of 2 × 1013 gc/kg BW, i.e. Phase 2b trial CT-AMT-061-01 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 91/149 
 
 
 
and pivotal Phase 3 trial CT-AMT-061-02. Limited supportive data are available from Phase 1 trial CT-
AMT-060-01, which used a predecessor product, AMT-060, at two different dose levels. 
CT-AMT-061-01 is a phase 2b open-label study in patients with severe or moderately severe 
haemophilia B. The primary objective of this study was to confirm that a single dose of 2 × 1013 gc/kg 
AMT-061 resulted in FIX activity levels of ≥5% at 6 weeks after dosing. Three subjects were treated. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was factor IX activity level at six weeks after dosing. Secondary 
endpoints were defined as endogenous factor IX activity level at Week 52 post AMT-061 dose, freedom 
of previous continuous routine prophylaxis, consumption of factor IX replacement therapy and 
annualised bleeding rate. Subjects will be followed for 5 years for efficacy and safety outcomes. 
The applicant has not undertaken a proper dose finding study for etranacogene dezaparvovec. Only 3 
patients were recruited into this first clinical study, based on the result derived from the predecessor 
product, AMT-060. However, these early results are encouraging and the efficacy results of the pivotal 
study are in-line with this dose finding study. Consequently, the issue of not performing a proper dose 
finding study was not further pursued. 
The pivotal phase 3 Study CT-AMT-061-02 is a non-randomised, uncontrolled, open-label, single-arm 
trial of AMT-061. 54 subjects suffering from severe or moderately severe haemophilia B, who were 
treated with prior FIX prophylaxis were treated in the study. During the lead-in phase, which lasted a 
minimum of 26 weeks, subjects recorded their use of FIX replacement therapy and bleeding episodes 
in their dedicated e-diary in order to provide a baseline of bleeding event frequency and FIX 
consumption. Seventy-five subjects were screened, 67 subjects were enrolled and started the lead-in 
period. Fifty-four subjects received AMT-061 at a dose of 2 × 1013 gc/kg and provided data for efficacy 
and safety evaluation. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria select for generally healthy subjects with severe or moderately 
severe (FIX≤2) haemophilia, with a focus on excluding pre-existing significant hepatic disease. This 
precaution is endorsed as one of the most frequent expected short term adverse events is an increase 
in liver function parameters as the immunologic system tries to clear cells infected with the vector. In 
addition, patients with a history of FIX inhibitors were excluded from participation in the clinical 
investigation programme, which is adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as “Annualized bleeding rate comparison between AMT-061 
and prophylaxis for non-inferiority between the lead-in phase and the 52 weeks following stable FIX 
expression (Months 6 to 18 post-treatment)”. An increase of endogenous factor IX levels per se is 
considered desirable, however, the more relevant clinical outcome is the ensuing frequency of bleeding 
events. The prespecified run-in period of at least 26 weeks allows a comparison with the subjects’ own 
ABR during replacement therapy with exogenous factor IX products and as such enhances the 
informative value of this non-randomised trial. Scientific advice was given several times during the 
clinical development of the product. However, the applicant has changed the primary efficacy endpoint 
during the ongoing study without solid clarification of this major change. While the final primary 
efficacy endpoint (ABR comparison between AMT-061 and prophylaxis for non-inferiority between the 
lead-in phase and the 52 weeks following stable FIX expression) is in principle acceptable, the 
applicant was asked to provide further justification of this change and possible influence of this change 
to the study outcome. The applicant has clearly and sufficiently justified why the change of the primary 
endpoint had no major impact on the interpretability or conclusion of the efficacy analysis.  
Factor IX activity, consumption of external FIX and annual infusion rate were among the secondary 
efficacy outcomes, several PRO outcomes with regard to pain, activity and quality of life scores were 
also reported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 92/149 
 
 
 
From a methodological perspective the overall approach is considered acceptable. The trial design was 
discussed and agreed upon during PRIME scientific advice interactions and is in principle endorsed, i.e. 
no comparator arm and ABR (comparison between AMT-061 and prophylaxis for non-inferiority 
between the lead-in phase and the 52 weeks following stable FIX expression) as a primary efficacy 
endpoint. Thus patients serve as their own controls, i.e. an intra-patient comparison instead of a 
randomised comparison is performed. However, the method for the interval estimation of the 
annualised bleeding rate ratio is not considered optimal. 
The applicant was asked to explain why the data collection method for the primary endpoint was 
changed in the middle of the trial and in the middle of the efficacy period for the primary analysis. 
Furthermore, the applicant was asked to elaborate on the data collection method during the lead-in 
study. The applicant was requested to provide convincing rationale that the bleed data is truly 
comparable between the three study periods (lead-in, up to Week 52 and after Week 52). Lastly, the 
applicant was requested to explain in detail how it was ensured that days with no bleeds recorded are 
truly days with no bleeds and not missing data. With the responses to the D120 LoQ, the applicant 
provided sufficient clarification on the methods of data collection for the primary endpoint. The eDiary 
collection is considered to cover the most important periods (i.e. the Lead-in and months 7 to 12 
postdose). The applicant was advised to ensure continued data collection. 
No pre-planned analyses to assess the compliance to complete the bleed questionnaire have been 
identified and no results are found in the CSR. A comprehensive assessment of compliance was 
requested, including the lead-in and actual study and electronic and paper diaries. Importantly, days 
when no bleeds were recorded should be distinguishable from days when the patient was not 
compliant. The rules given to the patients on how and when to complete the diaries should be 
provided. With the responses to the D120 LoQ, a comprehensive assessment of compliance was 
provided, as requested and for most patients the compliance was good in regard to reporting. 
Interim analysis: The rationale for the 6-month and 12-month interim analyses for endogenous factor 
IX activity is not followed. It is understood that the study team had access to the results which is not 
acceptable though this is an open-label study. Access to the aggregated results should not be available 
until the primary analysis. The applicant was requested to confirm which parties had access to the 
results of the interim analyses, what was externally communicated and explain why they were 
conducted. It is notable that both the protocol and the SAP have been amended after the performed 
interim analyses. The requested details were provided by the applicant in regard to the conduct of the 
interim analysis (i.e. timing, data access, etc.). The results were communicated to the scientific 
community in the context of various conferences, beginning in 2019, which is considered 
understandable with regards to the novelty of etranacogene dezaparvovec gene therapy. 
In order for an intra-patient comparison to provide an unbiased estimate, all patients should have 
moved from the lead-in period to the active part of the study. However, 13 out 67 patients 
discontinued from the lead-in period. Only high-level information with regard to number of exclusion 
criterion is provided. Due to that, the applicant was asked to provide exact details from all patients 
excluded during the screening and lead-in period, preferably in a tabulated format. Furthermore, the 
applicant was asked to justify the generalizability of the efficacy results considering the already low 
number of patients in this single pivotal study (n= 54) together with the fact that 19% of the patients 
in the lead-in period did not continue into the actual study. The details on screen failures were 
provided and the presented reasons are considered adequate. In addition, the applicant has provided 
the requested rationale for generalizability of the efficacy results, which imply that the bleeding 
tendencies before the treatment were comparable. 
The applicant has made several, important amendments to this single pivotal study. From the data 
provided it is difficult to outline how many patients were treated before each of the performed 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023

Amendment. The applicant was asked to provide this information. The applicant was also asked to 
clarify how reliable the results of the changed primary endpoint are (ABR, which is considered to be 
subjective at risk of possible bias), due to between- and within-subject variation to reporting bleeds to 
the ePRO, paper diary or to treatment centre. In their response, the applicant provided the requested 
information on the patients treated before each protocol amendment. All patients were treated before 
the change of the primary endpoint. The applicant has also elaborated on the reliability of the results 
due to the change in primary endpoint. 
Overall, the applicant has provided all the information requested and all methodological issues are 
considered resolved. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy data for the proposed dose of 2 × 1013 gc/kg are available from the 3 subjects in trial CT-
AMT-061-01 and from 54 subjects from trial CT-AMT-061-02. Supportive data with the predecessor 
product AMT-060 are available from a phase 1 trial in 2 cohorts of 5 subjects each from study CT-AMT-
060-01. 
In the phase 2b study CT-AMT-061-01, mean FIX activity level at Week 6, the time of the primary 
endpoint read-out, was 30.6 % measured by the one-stage assay. Individual FIX activity levels 
achieved by each subject at Week 6 were 23.9%, 30.0%, and 37.8%. At Week 52, the mean FIX 
activity level was 40.8% measured by the one-stage assay. Individual FIX activity levels achieved by 
each subject at Week 52 were 31.3%, 40.8%, and 50.2%. At Month 36, uncontaminated samples were 
available for 2 subjects and demonstrated that FIX activity levels continued to be elevated, at 32.3% 
and 41.5%, respectively. 
A discrepancy is noted between measuring FIX activity with the one-stage or the chromogenic assay. 
The chromogenic assay returns values approximately half of the values observed with the one-stage 
assay. A warning statement was introduced to section 4.4 of the SmPC to alert the treating physician 
to the fact that the chromogenic assay returns lower FIX activity values than the one-stage assay, with 
a mean ratio of FIX activity by chromogenic assay to one-stage (aPTT-based) assay from 0.408 to 
0.547. 
The average ABR for the 3 subjects was 0.27 over the period of 2.5 years of follow-up. The ABRs for 
spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes over 2.5 years were both 0.14. The average ABR for the 
3 subjects was 0.22 over the period of 3 years (36 months) of follow-up. The ABRs for spontaneous 
and traumatic bleeding episodes over 3 years (36 months) were both 0.11. There were no bleeding 
episodes between 2.5 and 3 years of follow-up (both bleeding episodes occurred in the first 18 months 
post-AMT-061 administration).  These ABR values are low, but as this trial had no run-in phase 
specified in the protocol, a comparison to meaningful pre-treatment data is not possible. 
In the pivotal trial CT-AMT-061-02, a significant reduction of unadjusted mean ABR could be shown 
comparing the lead-in period ABR of 4.11 to the post-treatment ABR of 1.08 recorded during months 7 
to 18. The prespecified NI analysis encompassing a comparison of ABR between the lead-in and post-
treatment period estimated from a negative binomial regression model was significant and non-
inferiority to FIX prophylaxis could be declared. In addition, the secondary outcome of superiority over 
FIX prophylaxis could also be shown. 20.4% of subjects reported joint bleeding episodes post-
treatment, compared to 59.3% of during lead-in. The number of subjects who did not experience any 
bleeding event more than doubled during month 7-18 [34/54 (63.0%)] compared to baseline [14/54 
(25.9%)]. Sensitivity analyses are in line with observed ABR results. In the subgroup analysis, ABR 
was significantly reduced during months 7 to 18 after AMT-061 treatment compared to the lead-in 
period for most of the subgroups analysed, except subjects with a positive anti-AAV5 nAb titre at 
baseline (n = 21) most likely due to one patient with high pre-dose anti-AAV5 nAb titre >3000 (3212).

With the responses to the D120 LoQ, an ABR analysis for months 7-24 after treatment was provided 
(not adjusted for multiplicity). The unadjusted ABR was 0.99, with the adjusted ABR 1.51 (0.83, 4.76). 
27 (50.0%) of subjects reported no bleeding episode from month 7-24. 27.8% of subjects reported 
joint bleeds between month 7-24. 
FIX activity levels showed clinically relevant values at month 6 (mean 38.95; median 37.30), continued 
to increase until month 12 (mean 41.48; median 39.90) and then declined slightly until month 18 
(mean 36.90; median 35.55) and remained steady at month 24 (mean 36.66; median 33.85). No 
subject recorded values >150%. External factor IX consumption as well as external FIX infusion rate in 
the post-treatment period declined to approximately 3% of the value observed during the lead-in 
period. Fifty-two of 54 subjects remained free from FIX replacement therapy during the follow-up 
period of 18 months. One of the two subjects who had to return to FIX replacement therapy received 
only about 10% of the intended dose of AMT-061 due to hypersensitivity and the second had a high 
anti-AAV5 nAb titre at baseline and did not respond to treatment with Hemgenix. 
All investigated subgroups showed an improvement with regard to ABR and FIX activity level in the 
post-treatment period compared to the lead-in period. The subgroup of subjects demonstrating 
appreciably lower FIX activity levels compared to the other subgroups was comprised of those patients 
who experienced an ALT elevation post AMT-061 treatment and especially those patients who received 
corticosteroids as a consequence. The highest FIX activity during months 7-18 in a patient treated with 
corticosteroids was ~30% and the lowest only 4.5%.  
The ideal outcome of the therapy in the long-term, in addition to reduction of ABR, would of course be 
freedom of previous intravenous FIX substitution therapy. Importantly, 34/53 (64.2%) subjects whose 
baseline anti-AAV5 nAb titre was <3000 had 0 bleeding episodes during the Month 7 to 18 post-
treatment period and 27/53 (50.9) subjects had zero bleeds during Month 7-24 period. 
Subjects were enrolled into the pivotal study irrespective of their pre-existing anti-AAV nAb titre. 
Twenty subjects were found to have titres up to 1:678.2 at baseline, and 33 subjects were negative. 
While overall a numerically lower mean Factor IX activity was observed in patients with pre-existing 
neutralising anti-AAV5 antibodies, no clinically meaningful correlation was identified between patients’ 
pre-existing anti-AAV5 antibody titre and their factor IX activity at 18 months post-dose. In 1 patient 
with a titre of 1:3212 for pre-existing anti-AAV5 antibodies at screening, no response to etranacogene 
dezaparvovec treatment was observed, with no factor IX expression and activity. 
In consequence, the applicant proposed a cut-off titre of <1:700 to be introduced into the product 
information which was intended to determine treatment eligibility with Hemgenix. However, in order to 
avoid a restriction of the indication with this arbitrary cut-off limit based on data from one patient only, 
the CAT was of the view that the investigation of the effectiveness of Hemgenix in a post-authorisation 
efficacy study regardless of the preexisting anti-AAV5 nAb titre (PAES) is the preferred option.  
Minimal or no improvements could be detected in patient reported outcome scales, several of which 
were investigated during the clinical trial (e.g. WPAI, BPI, HAL and EQ-5D-5L). 
The use of corticosteroids for elevation of transaminases was prespecified in the protocol and is 
adequately reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Thirteen out of 53 (24.5%) subjects who received a 
full dose of AMT-061 experienced ALT elevation and 9 (16.9%) subjects were treated with 
corticosteroids. The duration of corticosteroid use for elevated transaminases ranged from 51 to 130 
days. 
In the supportive study CT-AMT-060-01 efficacy was demonstrated by continuously increased 
endogenous FIX activity levels throughout the study duration up to 5 years. Accordingly, the use of FIX 
replacement therapy and mean ABR were reduced after treatment with AMT-060 in both dose cohorts.

Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The final clinical study report including 5 years follow-up of Study CT-AMT-061-01 should be submitted 
no later than June 2024 and is subject to a specific obligation laid down in the MA (SOB-1). 
The final clinical study report including 5 years follow-up of the pivotal Study CT-AMT-061-02 with 
54 subjects should be submitted no later than October 2025 and is subject to a specific obligation laid 
down in the MA (SOB-2). 
A one year follow-up interim analysis report after the first 50 subjects are enrolled in Study 
CSL222_4001 should be provided no later than December 2026 (SOB-3). 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The submitted clinical efficacy data show a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement 
of ABR in the post-treatment period (months 7-24) compared to the lead-in period of at least 6 
months, during which subjects were receiving prophylactic FIX replacement. 
Endogenous FIX activity achieved clinically relevant levels in the majority (52/54) of subjects, with no 
subject showing supraphysiologic FIX activity. Use of exogenous FIX as well as FIX infusion rate fell to 
approximately 3% of values reported during lead-in. 
In order to further elucidate the durability of the response, the applicant was asked to submit the 2-
year efficacy data for the primary and all secondary efficacy endpoints and to develop a quantitative 
pharmacokinetic model that estimates the durability of FIX activity in the general clinical trial 
population, and also in relevant subgroups. Updated efficacy data from 24 months of follow-up from 
pivotal trial AMT-061-02 and 36 months of follow-up from trial AMT-061-01 continue to show 
satisfactory outcomes with regard to clinically relevant FIX activity and a sustained low ABR. The 
durability of the therapeutic effect has been shown to be stable up until 24 months of follow-up in the 
pivotal trial.  
The initially proposed wording of the indication with regard to the threshold for baseline anti AAV5 nAb 
was not accepted by CAT. In order to avoid an arbitrary cut-off limit based on data from one patient 
and taking into account that patients were enrolled into the pivotal study irrespective of their baseline 
nAb titre, this restriction on the indication was removed from the wording of 4.1. 
However, while the two years of follow-up provided show that the expression of FIX activity appears to 
be stable over this duration, the long-term durability of the treatment effect and long-term safety are 
still unknown factors. In addition, since uncertainties regarding the impact of neutralizing anti-AAV 
capsid antibodies on efficacy and safety cannot be comprehensively characterised based on available 
data, a full MA as sought by the applicant was not considered acceptable.  
Due to the limitations of the provided dataset, the applicant agreed to request a conditional marketing 
authorisation. The prerequisites for a CMA according to Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 are 
considered as fulfilled.  
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
- 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of etranacogene dezaparvovec in adult patients with 
severe and moderately severe Haemophilia B (congenital Factor IX deficiency) without a 
history of Factor IX inhibitors, the MAH should submit the final results including 5 years follow-
up of the pivotal Study CT-AMT-061-01.

MAH should submit a 1-year follow-up interim analysis report after the first 50 subjects are 
enrolled in Study CSL222_4001. 
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
- 
In order to further characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of etranacogene 
dezaparvovec in adult patients with severe and moderately severe Haemophilia B (congenital 
Factor IX deficiency) without a history of Factor IX inhibitors, the MAH should submit the final 
analysis report of a study from a registry, according to an agreed protocol. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on clinical efficacy as described above. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
Two clinical studies provide safety data for etranacogene dezaparvovec (AMT-061, human FIXco-
Padua) from in total 57 exposed adult subjects with severe or moderately severe haemophilia B, with 
and without pre-existing nAbs to the AAV5 capsid. 
• 
• 
Study CT-AMT-061-01 is an ongoing, 5-year, phase 2b, open-label, single-dose, single-arm, 
multicenter study (n=3, 3-year post-dose, database lock: 28 February 2022). 
Study CT-AMT-061-02 (HOPE-B [Health Outcomes with Padua gene; Evaluation in Hemophilia 
B]) is an ongoing, pivotal, phase 3, open-label, single-dose, single-arm, multinational study, 
which included a ≥ 6-month Lead-in Period with standard of care continuous FIX prophylaxis 
(n=54, 2-year post-dose data, database lock: 21 April 2022). 
Following an initial data submission, the applicant provided a safety data update upon request, 
including additional 6 months of data (until the above-described cut-off dates). 
Nearly all subjects were exposed to a single dose of 2 × 1013 gc/kg AMT-061, except for one 
participant who received a partial dose (~10%).  
The safety endpoints in both studies are: AEs; Anti-AAV5 antibodies (total [IgM and IgG], nAb); AAV5 
capsid-specific T-cells; Anti-FIX antibodies; FIX inhibitors and recovery; Haematology and serum 
chemistry parameters; ALT and AST levels, and corticosteroid use for ALT and AST increases; Vector 
DNA in blood and semen; Inflammatory markers: interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-6, interferon gamma 
(IFNγ), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1); AFP; Vital signs (including abdominal 
ultrasound). 
Supportive safety data are available from Study CT-AMT-060-01, a Phase I/II open label, uncontrolled, 
single-dose, dose-ascending, multi-center study investigating two dose levels (5 × 1012 gc/kg, 2 × 
1013 gc/kg, n=5 per dose) of AMT-060 (FIX wild type). The final CSR is available (5-year data).

2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Table 17. Completed and Ongoing Clinical Studies with Data Included in the Safety Summary 
All subjects were male, which is acceptable as haemophilia B is an X-linked recessive condition and 
occurs primarily in men. The majority identified as White (n=41, 78.8%). The mean (SD) age at 
baseline of the treated subjects was 41.7 years (15.42) and the median age was 37 years. The mean 
BMI was 27.06 kg/m2, ranging from 21.2 to 51.0 kg/m2. The majority of subjects was in the age group 
between 18-49 years (71.9%, n=41), 15.8% (n=9) were between 50-64 years, and 12.3% (n=7) 
were between 65-75 years of age at baseline.  
At the time of their diagnosis, 47/57 (82.5%) subjects had severe haemophilia B. The remaining 
subjects (17.5%, n=10) were diagnosed with moderately severe haemophilia B. Five (8.8%) 
participants were HIV positive, 9/57 (15.8%) subjects reported a history of hepatitis B, and 34/57 
(59.7%) subjects reported a history of hepatitis C. At baseline, all participants were non-reactive to 
HBsAg and nine (15.8%) were reactive to HBeAg.  
A considerable number of subjects were seropositive for anti-AAV5 nAbs before treatment with AMT-
061 (n= 24, 42.1%).

Table 18. Investigational Product Exposure Duration (ISS Safety Population) 
In total, 57 subjects were followed-up for 1547.5 person-months post dose. Fifty-four participants 
have a duration of exposure >24 months. One subject died on study day 464.  
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events  
Lead-in Period  
Table 19. Overall Summary of Adverse Events in ≥ 2 Percent by Preferred Term - Study CT-
AMT-061-02 (Study Safety Population) 
During the lead-in period (≥ 6 months), the subjects received standard of care continuous routine 
factor IX prophylaxis. Of the 54 subjects who finished the lead-in period (and received treatment with 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 99/149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AMT-061), 37 (68.5%) reported 87 AEs, with nasopharyngitis (n=8, 14.8%) and arthralgia (n=4, 
7.4%) as the most frequently reported AEs. Overall, it appears that many AEs could have been caused 
by background disease (e.g., due to respiratory tract infection) or other pre-existing conditions 
(haemarthrosis).  
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) 
Table 20. Incidence and Number of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (ISS Safety 
Population) 
The incidence and number of adverse events is clearly higher after treatment than during the lead-in 
period. This may partly be due to longer time of follow-up after the treatment compared to the lead-in 
period. Also, some AEs may occur shortly after treatment, which increases the amount of AEs in the 
after-treatment period compared to the lead-in period. The applicant was requested to show and 
discuss, how the AE profile of treated subjects changes during the follow-up period, and to show a 
comparison of 1) AEs of the lead-in period, 2) 0-1 month, 3) AEs of the 0-6 months follow-up period 
after treatment and 4) AEs of the 6-18 months follow-up period after treatment.  
The applicant presented the comparison of the four time frames in tabulated format as requested 
(table not shown here). During the Lead-in period (excluding lead-in discontinuers), 68.5% 
experienced an AE, 85.2% had AEs in the first month postdose and 98.1% had AEs during months 0 to 
6 postdose. Thereafter, the incidence of AEs reduced to 74.1% from months 7 to 18 postdose. 
The higher incidence of AEs during the first 6 months postdose compared with the Lead-in Period and 
the period from 7 to 18 months post-dose can be explained by AEs which reflect an immune response 
against the vector. These AEs include infusion related reactions, flu-like symptoms (including 
headache, fatigue, and influenza like illness), C-reactive protein increased, blood creatine 
phosphokinase increased, and liver enzyme elevations (including ALT Increased, and AST increased). 
No other pattern of TEAEs related to etranacogene dezaparvovec was identified. 
Adverse events expected in this haemophilia B population (such as Hemarthrosis, Arthralgia, or 
Gastrointestinal Haemorrhage, and other events like seasonal infections or comorbidities due to the 
Assessment report

subject’s medical history or age) occurred at a comparable frequency during the 4 periods (Lead-in 
Period, Month 0 to 1, Months 0 to 6, and Months 7 to 18). 
Common TEAEs 
The most commonly reported TEAEs by PT, irrespective of investigator causality assessment, were 
Arthralgia (36.8%), Headache (31.6%), Nasopharyngitis (26.3%), Fatigue (24.6%), and ALT Increased 
(21.1%), as shown below. No trends were discernible in TEAEs based on age, race, ethnicity, or BMI.

TEAEs were adverse events with onset date on or after the date of etranacogene dezaparvovec administration.  
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Related to Study Treatment 
In the ISS Safety Population, 68.4% of subjects experienced treatment-related TEAEs. Most common 
treatment-related TEAEs by PT were headache (9 [15.8%]), ALT Increased (9 [15.8%]), influenza-like 
Illness (7 [12.3%]), and AST increased (5 [8.8%]) as shown in the Table below. No trends were noted 
in treatment-related TEAEs based on age, race, ethnicity, or BMI.

TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event; a Related or possibly related to study treatment. Notes: 
1. Treatment-emergent adverse events were adverse events with onset date on or after the date of etranacogene 
dezaparvovec administration. 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023

2. Preferred terms are presented by descending incidence among subjects in both studies combined and by 
descending incidence in CT-AMT-061-02, then CT-AMT-061-01 for ties. Source: ISS safety update Table 3.4.1.2 
One of the most common treatment-related adverse events was influenza like illness (ILI), which 
occurred in close temporal relationship after IP administration in several patients. The applicant was 
asked to comment whether the Investigators used a certain ILI definition (e.g., WHO, CDC) and to 
discuss a potentially increased risk for infection after administration of gene therapy. It was unclear if 
these reports were alternatively rather events of ‘feeling sick’ with different symptoms. The applicant 
clarified that no certain ILI definitions were used. It was further pointed out that for all events of ILI 
(by PT) the verbatim terms of ‘flu like symptoms’, ‘flu like symptoms without fever’, or ‘feeling fluish’ 
were used. All events were mild, most events occurred in close temporal relationship and resolved 
within 1 to 2 days of onset.  
Part of transaminase increases and CK increases were assessed as related as well as part of arthralgia 
and other kinds of pain. Related increases in ALT, AST and CK were reported for 15.8%, 8.8% and 
7.0% of subjects respectively. Some cases of arthralgia (3 subjects), as well as sporadic cases of pain 
(2 subjects), abdominal pain upper (1 subject), back pain (1 subject), myalgia (1 subject) were 
assessed as related. Even one viral infection was assessed as related as well as sporadic cases of 
diarrhoea, malaise, anaemia, abdominal discomfort etc. However, all related AEs have not been 
mentioned in the tabulated list of adverse events in SmPC section 4.8. The applicant was asked for 
clarification regarding the principle in defining the relationship of adverse events to the study 
treatment and the principle of choosing related adverse events to the list of ADRs in SmPC section 4.8. 
The applicant clarified that after the adverse drug reaction (ADR) selection process was conducted 
(including screening of AEs, expert medical review, and thorough causality assessment), reasonable 
evidence of a causal relationship between several AEs and the IP could not be established for many 
TEAEs commonly reported by the investigators as related or possibly related to etranacogene 
dezaparvovec. Therefore, not all the TEAEs reported by investigators as related have been included in 
the table of ADRs in the SmPC. 
The most common reasons for not including TEAEs in the ADR table are the following: 
•  A robust causal association with etranacogene dezaparvovec could not be established by the 
applicant 
• 
The presence of strong confounding factors or the presence of more plausible alternative 
explanation (eg, underlying hemophilia B and / or its complications) 
•  No plausible explanation of the TEAE based on the known mechanism of action of etranacogene 
dezaparvovec and the pathogenesis of the AE. 
The following TEAEs commonly reported as related by the investigator but not included in the tabulated 
list of AEs in SmPC Section 4.8 (eg, Arthralgia, Pain, Abdominal Discomfort, Back Pain, Myalgia, 
Unconfirmed Viral Infection, Diarrhoea, and Anaemia) met one or more of the reasons chosen by the 
applicant for not including such AEs in the ADR table of the SmPC.  
It should be noted that “Abdominal Pain Upper” was proposed to be included as individual symptom 
under “Infusion-related Reaction” in the ADR table of the SmPC, and the ADR of “C-reactive Protein 
Increased” was subsequently added (as clarified in the response to Question 122). 
In conclusion, it is considered, that the current list of ADRs included in the SmPC is adequate for the 
purpose  of  informing  the  prescriber  of  expected  AEs  that  have  a  reasonable  causal  association  with 
etranacogene dezaparvovec administration.

In the Integrated summary of clinical safety, there were no thrombotic events reported. In the HOPE-B 
study report, there were at least 1 myocardial infarction, one peripheral artery occlusive disease and 
one TIA (transient ischemic attack). According to the AE Listing, the myocardial infarction occurred 
during the lead-in period and the participant did not receive treatment with AMT-061. The applicant 
was asked to list all possible thromboembolic events in both studies and discuss their possible relation 
to study treatment.  
The applicant explained that there were four TEAEs in 3 subjects identified as potentially relating to a 
thromboembolic event in Study CT-AMT-061-02. These were PTs of Angina Pectoris (2 events), 
Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease (1 event) and Transient Ischaemic Attack (1 event). The cases of 
Angina pectoris and Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease were assessed by the investigator as not 
related to IP and 1 serious TEAE of Transient Ischaemic Attack was assessed by the investigator and 
the Sponsor as unlikely related to IP.  
The subject with nonserious TEAE of Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease (Day 547 postdose) was in 
the age group from 65 to 74 years of age and had a relevant medical history of aortic arteriosclerosis 
(from 2014 ongoing), and hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension. 
The subject with nonserious TEAE of Angina Pectoris (Day 220 postdose) had also a serious TEAE of 
Transient Ischaemic Attack (Day 229 postdose). At the time of enrolment to Study CT-AMT-061-02, 
the subject was in the age group from 65 to 74 years of age and had a relevant medical history of 
Transient Ischaemic Attack from 2018, which resolved before enrolment in the study. 
The other subject with a nonserious TEAE of Angina Pectoris (study day postdose not reported) was in 
the age group from 75 to 84 years of age and had a relevant medical history of hypertension for more 
than 25 years, atrial fibrillation and atrial enlargement. The subject later had a fatal serious TEAE of 
Cardiogenic Shock (Day 463 postdose, end date Day 464 postdose) following a nonserious TEAE of 
Urinary Tract Infection that progressed to Urosepsis (Day 463 postdose). 
Additionally, one subject had an SAE of myocardial infarction during the lead-in period and the subject 
was not treated with etranacogene dezaparvovec as he met Exclusion Criterion #8 and was not eligible 
for inclusion in the study. 
The subjects described above had relevant vascular and cardiac medical histories preceding the 
thromboembolic events. Also, these subjects belong to an aging population who are more likely to 
experience cardiac and vascular events. 
With the data update, one additional treatment-related TEAE has been reported (PT: 
Lymphadenopathy Mediastinal) within the additional 6 months of safety follow-up. Upon request, the 
applicant clarified that the TEAE of Lymphadenopathy Mediastinal (moderate in severity, ongoing at the 
time of the 24-month data cut-off) was observed as an incidental finding on a CT scan performed for 
evaluation of the vascular system after an aneurysm of iliac artery was found. The Investigator 
confirmed that the subject did not have overt signs of pulmonary infection / lymphoma; the 
mediastinal nodes were > 15 mm in size and had a benign appearance. The Investigator considered 
that a causal relationship between etranacogene dezaparvovec and the TEAE of Lymphadenopathy 
Mediastinal was at least a reasonable possibility due to the lack of a specific diagnosis of an alternative 
root cause and the unknown long-term effects of a GTMP. The subject is still enrolled in the study and 
will continued to be followed as per the clinical study protocol.

Table  23.  Incidence  of  Treatment-emergent  Adverse  Events  Related  to  Study  Treatment  by 
Maximum Severity (ISS Safety Population) 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) by Anti-AAV5 nAb Status at Baseline 
The 33 subjects in the ISS Safety Population who were seronegative at baseline for anti-AAV5 nAb 
experienced 325 TEAEs; common TEAEs included Headache (12 [36.4%] subjects, 22 events), 
Arthralgia (11 [33.3%] subjects, 22 events), ALT Increased (8 [24.2%], 9 events), Fatigue (9 [27.3%] 
subjects, 11 events), Nasopharyngitis (8 [24.2%], 12 events), COVID-19 (7 [21.2%], 7 events), 
Toothache (6 [18.2%], 10 events), AST Increased (5 [15.2%], 6 events), Back Pain (5 [15.2%], 5 
events), and Hypertension (5 [15.2%], 5 events). Of these 33 subjects, 22 (66.7%) had 57 treatment-
related TEAEs. Most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs by PT experienced by subjects within 
this subject group included ALT Increased (6 [18.2%], 7 events), Headache (6 [18.2%], 7 events), 
AST Increased (4 [12.1%], 5 events), Dizziness (3 [9.1%], 3 events), Fatigue (3 [9.1%], 3 events), 
and Influenza-like Illness (3 [9.1%], 4 events).  
Twenty-four subjects who were seropositive for anti-AAV5 nAb at baseline experienced 288 TEAEs; 
common TEAEs included Arthralgia (10 [41.7%], 15 events), Nasopharyngitis (7 [29.2%], 8 events), 
Headache (6 [25.0%], 13 events), Back Pain (6 [25.0%], 9 events), Pain in Extremity (6 [25.0%], 7 
events), Blood Creatine Phosphokinase Increased (5 [20.8%], 6 events), Fatigue (5 [20.8%], 6 
events), Influenza-like Illness (4 [16.7%], 7 events), Diarrhoea (4 [16.7%], 4 events), Nausea (4 
[16.7%], 4 events), and Oropharyngeal Pain (4 [16.7%], 4 events). Of the 24 subjects who were 
seropositive for anti-AAV-5 nAb at baseline, 17 (70.8%) experienced 38 treatment-related TEAEs. The 
common treatment-related TEAEs by PT experienced by subjects within the seropositive subgroup were 
comparable with those experienced in the seronegative subgroup, including Influenza-like Illness (4 
[16.7%], 4 events), Headache (3 [12.5%], 3 events), ALT Increased (3 [12.5%], 3 events), C-reactive 
Protein Increased (3 [12.5%], 3 events), and Infusion Related Reaction (3 [12.5%], 3 events). No 
increased risk was identified for the 1 subject with a very high anti-AAV5 nAb titre of 3,212. 
Treatment-emergent Elevations in Transaminases and Corticosteroid Use for Elevated Transaminases 
In the ISS Population, 12 participants (21.1%) had 14 TEAEs of ALT Increased and 9 participants 
(15.8%) had 10 TEAEs of AST Increased. Most of these TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity, but 1 
subject had elevations in AST and ALT that were reported as severe. Two subjects (one subject in 
Study CT-AMT-061-01 and one subject in Study CT-AMT-061-02) each had a TEAE with PT of 
transaminases increased; in 1 of the Subjects, the event occurred 218 days after infusion and was 
reported as ‘elevated AST, ALT’ and in the other Subject, the event occurred 740 days after infusion 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 106/149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and was reported as ‘alcohol related transaminase increase’. No subject met the definition of drug-
induced liver injury (DILI). 
Nine subjects (15.8% of the ISS Population) used systemic corticosteroids for transaminase elevations 
in the Post-treatment Follow-up Period of Study CT-AMT-061-02. The mean corticosteroid treatment 
duration for those subjects was 79.8 days [range 51 to 130 days]. These nine subjects received 
steroids as treatment for the liver enzyme elevations of either > ULN (n = 8) or > 2 × baseline value 
(n = 1), including prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone. Five of the subjects receiving 
steroids had an isolated ALT increase and 4 subjects had both an elevation of ALT and AST. All 
transaminase elevations that were treated with steroids had an onset within 3 months post dose, with 
the earliest onset at Week 3. All subjects discontinued steroid use before Week 26.  
All TEAEs regarding elevated transaminase were non-serious and resolved. One subject in study CT-
AMT-061-01 had moderate TEAEs of ALT increased, AST increased, and blood creatine phosphokinase 
increased between Days 787 and 806 that resolved without treatment. 
One subject had a mild AE of bilirubin increased that resolved within 9 days.

Table 26. Summary of Liver Enzyme Elevation Adverse Events 
In relation to treatment of transaminase elevations, AEs Qualifying for Special Notification of Insomnia 
and Lymphocyte Count Decreased were reported. Insomnia occurred 2 days after initiation of 
prednisolone in 1 subject for a TEAE of ALT Increased. Prednisolone was tapered following resolution of 
the transaminase elevation and the TEAE of Insomnia resolved 6 days later. A TEAE of Lymphocyte 
Count Decreased occurred 3 days after initiation of prednisolone in another subject who had been 
treated for a TEAE of ALT Increased; the event of Lymphocyte Count Decreased resolved during 
prednisolone tapering. 
The applicant was asked to clarify why the ALT increase in one subject was considered as not related 
to treatment with AMT-061. The duration of the event (day 36 to 149) and the fact that he received 
prednisone for the duration of 100 days (day 49 to 149) would suggest otherwise. The applicant 
responded that the reported causality assessment is the investigator’s causality assessment, and that 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 109/149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
no sponsor assessment of causality was made. The applicant agreed that time to onset of the AE, 
duration, and clinical course would suggest otherwise.  
A subject experienced a treatment-related TEAE of ALT increased from day 28-44 (grade 1) and was 
treated with prednisone from day 46 to 147. Some months after tapering off the corticosteroid 
treatment, he reported an event of AST increased (day 213 to 247). a) The applicant was requested to 
clarify why this second event of transaminitis was considered as not related. b) With the submission of 
the new data package (24-month data), the applicant was asked comment whether there were cases 
of recurrence of transaminitis.  
a) Regarding the relatively late (Day 213) occurring case of AST increased, the applicant described 
that a slightly increased value was detected by a local laboratory, while the central laboratory values 
were within the reference range. Elevated values for CRP and gamma glutamyltransferase were 
concomitantly detected. Additionally, the subject had isolated ALT/AST and gamma 
glutamyltransferase values greater than the upper limit of normal already during the lead-in study. 
Based on the provided information, it can be agreed that the relatively late event of slightly elevated 
AST might not have been caused by etranacogene dezaparvovec. 
b) The applicant summarised available data for three additional participants with more than one event 
of ALT/AST increased. Based on the provided data, the currently available 2-year data does not raise a 
concern regarding reoccurrence or late onset of transaminitis after treatment with etranacogene 
dezaparvovec. 
It was unclear why the events of ALT and AST increased in one subject were classified as severe, while 
the events in another subject were rated as mild (elevated AST) and moderate (elevated ALT). 
According to the applicant, the only grade 3 event was an ALT elevation 3 weeks post dose. The 
applicant was asked to comment. The applicant clarified that the discrepancies regarding the severity 
rating of elevated transaminases in both subjects were caused by initially discrepant guidance to 
investigators. The protocol was therefore amended in October 2020. The applicant further pointed out 
that the presentation and discussion of the clinical data consider the grading of the investigator. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In the ISS Safety Population, 15 (26.3%) subjects experienced 18 treatment-emergent SAEs. Serious 
AEs with PT blood loss anaemia were reported for 2 (3.5%) subjects; no other SAEs were reported in 
more than 1 subject. No apparent pattern was notable in the SAEs reported. 
No SAE was considered related to treatment. Of note, a SAE of osteonecrosis was reported for a 
participant with a medical history of osteonecrosis (diagnosis of the SAE: worsening of avascular 
necrosis – left hip). 
There were two SAEs of blood loss anaemia, one event occurred in a participant who concomitantly 
experienced the SAE of Diverticulitis Intestinal Haemorrhagic (Preferred Term), while the second 
anaemia developed due to rectal bleeding from haemorrhoids. 
A subject in the age group from 65 to 74 years experienced a transient ischaemic attack. The 
narratives for the participant revealed numerous risk factors and preconditions, including a TIA. The 
FIX activity levels had been stable during the course of the study in the range of 40-45%. Therefore, it 
can be agreed that increased FIX activity unlikely caused the TIA. In the narratives, it is speculated 
that a potentially pre-existing atrial fibrillation (AF) might have contributed to the TIA. However, the 
diagnosis for AF was made on Study Day 567. Overall, the Sponsor’s assessment can be agreed, that 
the SAE of TIA appears unlikely related to AMT-061 due to several significant risk factors and 
preconditions, but a contributory role cannot be excluded. 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 110/149 
 
 
 
Regarding a SAE of chest pain (grade 1, classified as serious due to hospitalisation), the applicant was 
asked to further substantiate why this event was considered as not related. The onset was one day 
after administration of AMT-061 and the subject was treated with nitroglycerin and amlodipine. The 
applicant described that the subject was treated with nitroglycerin and amlodipine, since he also 
experienced elevated blood pressure in addition to the chest pain. An electrocardiogram and chest x-
ray did not identify signs of heart disease or pulmonary embolism. The pain in the chest wall was 
presumed to be thoracic muscle pain related to exercise. No further concerns are raised, although a 
potential relationship of this mild event with etranacogene dezaparvovec treatment cannot be excluded 
based on the close temporal relationship. 
SAEs by anti-AAV5 Neutralizing Antibody Status at Baseline 
Of the 33 subjects in the ISS Safety Population who were seronegative for anti-AAV5 nAb, 6 (18.2%) 
subjects experienced 6 treatment-emergent SAEs. Of the 24 subjects who were seropositive for anti-
AAV5 nAb, 9 (37.5%) subjects experienced 12 treatment-emergent SAEs. The following SAEs were 
reported: 
• 
• 
seronegative at baseline: haemarthrosis, musculoskeletal chest pain, blood loss anaemia, COVID-
19, epilepsy, nephrolithiasis; 
seropositive at baseline: diverticulitis intestinal haemorrhagic, blood loss anaemia, upper 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, complication associated with 
device, cellulitis, jaw fracture, hepatocellular carcinoma, transient ischaemic attack, osteonecrosis, 
peripheral artery aneurysm. 
All severe and the fatal SAEs were experienced by the anti-AAV5 nAb seropositive subjects except 
covid-19, which was experienced by a seronegative subject. The applicant was asked to discuss the 
fact that anti-AAV5 nAb seropositive subjects had twice as many SAEs as anti-AAV5 nAb seronegative 
subjects and all severe SAEs and the fatal SAE were experienced by the anti-AAV5 nAb seropositive 
subjects except Covid-19.  
The applicant argued that five cases of severe SAEs in anti-AAV5 nAb seropositive subjects included a 
Jaw fracture, Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, Hepatocellular carcinoma, Cellulitis and Cardiogenic 
shock.  
The jaw fracture followed an assault, the hepatocellular carcinoma has been evaluated thoroughly in 
other context, and the cardiogenic shock followed an urosepsis in an elderly patient. The Upper 
Gastrointestinal Haemorrhage was experienced by a subject who remained on prophylaxis therapy 
and had the highest titre of preexisting anti-AAV5 nAbs at baseline. There was also another subject 
who remained on prophylaxis with FIX replacement therapy, was anti-AAV5 nAb seropositive and 
experienced a bleeding-related serious (not severe) TEAE of Diverticulitis Intestinal Haemorrhage. It 
can be noted that both of these subjects who remained on prophylaxis had serious TEAEs attributed to 
the underlying disease, adding to the overall higher number of TEAEs in the subgroup of anti-AAV5 
nAb seropositive subjects. 
Based on the evaluation of serious TEAEs, it seems that positive anti-AAV5 nAb status at baseline 
does not raise safety concerns with etranacogene dezaparvovec treatment itself but may contribute to 
the need of remaining on prophylaxis with FIX replacement therapy.   
Deaths 
One death was reported in Study CT-AMT-061-02. One Subject aged between 75 and 84 years with a 
medical history of atrial enlargement, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension, experienced a fatal event of 
Cardiogenic Shock on Study Day 464, following a urinary tract infection. The Investigator considered 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023

the event of Cardiogenic Shock as severe in intensity and unrelated to study medication. The Sponsor 
considered the event of Cardiogenic Shock as unrelated to study medication. 
Of note, another death was reported for a participant of the supportive Study CT-AMT-060-01. 
According to the brief narratives, the patient was in the age group from 65 to 74 years at the time of 
enrolment and the case of death occurred after the (5-year) study period. The investigator assessed 
the relationship between AMT-060 and death as being unlikely related.  
Treatment-emergent Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
One SAE of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was reported in Study CT-AMT-061-02 in a male subject 
aged between 65 to 74 years with multiple risk factors including a history of Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, 
alcohol use, and fatty liver disease. The subject did not show evidence of significant fibrosis / cirrhosis 
or steatosis at screening or before treatment with etranacogene dezaparvovec. Chest computerised 
tomogram (CT) with angiography that included visualisation of the upper abdominal organs 2 weeks 
post treatment and liver ultrasound on Day 84 post treatment revealed no liver abnormalities. 
On study Day 365, ultrasound per study protocol revealed a subcapsular lesion, prompting further 
assessment leading to the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.  
On Study Day 443, surgical excision of the lesion, the surrounding tissue and of a second lesion 
discovered on intraoperative ultrasound was planned. However, the primary tumour was neither 
biopsied nor excised during the surgery due to the complex location, possible morbidity and the 
likelihood that excision would not impact prognosis of multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma. It is 
however noticed that a percutaneous biopsy was performed on Study Day 389.  
The applicant was asked to clarify which lesions where biopsied and analysed. The applicant confirmed 
that specimens from the secondary lesion (in segment 2/3) and adjacent tissues (and not the primary 
tumour in segment 8) were used for integration analysis. 
Results of the integration site (IS) analysis revealed 56 unique ISs in the HCC and 39 unique ISs in the 
HCC-adjacent sample respectively, which indicated that < 0.03% of the cells in the HCC and HCC-
adjacent tissues had adeno-associated virus (AAV) integration. A dominant IS was not identified, as 
would be expected had the AAV vector integrated and led to clonal expansion of the tumour cells. 
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) identified five additional ISs and confirmed the lack of a dominant IS 
in the HCC sample. WGS also revealed genetic alterations on chromosomes 1, 8 and on the X-
chromosome of the HCC sample, typical for HCCs. WGS and RNA sequencing indicated a pattern of 
gene expression in the HCC-adjacent sample more characteristic of a premalignant state than of 
healthy liver tissue. Finally, miRNA analysis identified genes known to be associated with the 
progression and development of HCC. 
The Sponsor with support from an external expert group assessed that mutations in these genes are 
consistent with HCC-risk typical for patients with chronic hepatitis C, which had been present in this 
patient for years until HCV treatment. Based on these results it is concluded that while vector 
integration did occur to a minor degree, it is unlikely to have been causally related to the development 
of HCC in the study subject.  
Regarding this case of hepatocellular carcinoma, the applicant was requested to address a number of 
questions (see the discussion on clinical safety section for more details).   
Adverse Events Qualifying for Special Notification 
Nineteen AEs Qualifying for Special Notification were reported in 12 (21.1%) subjects in the first 18 
months of the Post-treatment Follow-up Period (ISS Safety Population). These 19 events coded to 17 
separate PTs. The System Organ Classes with events that occurred in more than 1 subject were Injury,

Poisoning, and Procedural Complications (2 [3.5%]) and Nervous System Disorders (2 [3.5%]). The 
majority of these AEs were mild or moderate (18/19 events) in severity and considered treatment-
related (14/19 events). 
Seven subjects had TEAEs Qualifying for Special Notification related to IP administration; ie, Infusion 
Related Reaction (2 [3.5%]), Hypersensitivity (1 [1.8%]), Infusion Site reaction (1 [1.8%]), Dizziness 
(2 [3.5%]), Eye pruritus (1 [1.8%]), Flushing (1 [1.8%]), Headache (1 [1.8%]), Abdominal Pain Upper 
(1 [1.8%]), Urticaria (1 [1.8%]), Chest Discomfort (1 [1.8%]), and Pyrexia (1 [1.8%]). Three subjects 
with infusion reactions related to IP required a dose interruption. Five of the 7 subjects were positive 
for anti-AAV5 nAbs at baseline. The applicant was asked to show the titres of anti-AAV5 nAbs of those 
subjects having AEs related to IP administration and discuss whether anti-AAV5 nAbs increase the risk 
of AEs related to IP administration.  
The applicant replied that four of these 5 subjects (positive for anti-AAV5 nAbs at baseline) had mild 
infusion-related reactions and 1 subject had a moderate infusion related-reaction. A higher nAb titre 
did not correlate with increased severity of AEs. Of the two subjects with AEs related to IP 
administration who were negative for anti-AAV5 nAbs at baseline, one had a mild AE and the other one 
had a moderate AE. 
The need for treatment / action for the infusion-related reaction AEs was not predictable based on nAb 
positive status or titre; 1 subject who was negative for anti-AAV5 nAbs required concomitant 
medication and interruption of study drug, whereas the subject with the highest titre for anti-AAV nAbs 
did not require concomitant therapy or interruption of study drug and the subject with the second 
highest anti-AAV nAb titre of 1:678 did not experience an infusion-related reaction at all. 
The applicant is of the opinion that there is currently insufficient evidence that the presence of 
preexisting anti-AAV5 nAbs would increase the risk of AEs related to IP administration as there is no 
correlation between the severity of infusion-related reaction AEs and anti-AAV5 nAb titres, and due to 
the small sample size. The risk of infusion-related reactions will be further characterised as part of 
post-marketing pharmacovigilance activities. This is acceptable. 
One of the 7 subjects had a TEAE of Hypersensitivity. The event occurred during administration of 
etranacogene dezaparvovec and resulted in discontinuation of treatment and receipt of a partial dose 
(approximately 10%). The discontinuation of treatment in this subject occurred under the oversight 
and at the direction of a sub-investigator. A subsequent process review led to a protocol amendment 
which incorporated guidance for study sites on the management of infusion reactions. After 
implementation of the protocol amendment, no further treatment discontinuations occurred. 
Three subjects had TEAEs Qualifying for Special Notification related to the development of any new / 
recurrent cancer. These included TEAEs of HCC (onset 365 days after etranacogene dezaparvovec 
treatment), Prostate cancer (onset: 350 days after etranacogene dezaparvovec treatment), and Basal 
Cell Carcinoma (onset: 550 days post dose), which were all assessed as not treatment-related. One 
subject had gastrointestinal lymphoma. The applicant was asked to justify why this lymphoma was not 
defined as an Adverse Event Qualifying for Special Notification and give more information of this 
subject.  
The applicant clarified that this subject was in the age group between 65 to 74 years and had 2 
findings from a routine colonoscopy on Day 203 postdose: nonserious TEAEs of Polyp and 
Gastrointestinal Neoplasm (nodule at ileocecal valve). On Day 420 postdose, the subject had another 
routine colonoscopy and a nonserious TEAE of Gastrointestinal Lymphoma (worsening of nodule at 
ileocecal valve) was reported. No information was provided about further diagnostic measures or 
treatment of the finding. 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 113/149 
 
 
 
The study site was contacted for follow-up, and the investigator clarified that the subject had a 
diagnosis of Colon Adenoma (tubular adenoma of colon) since 2015 and not a new TEAE of 
Gastrointestinal Lymphoma. This information will be updated in the EDC system and the incorrect 
MedDRA coding will be revised accordingly. 
According to the applicant, the TEAE of Gastrointestinal Lymphoma was a coding error and no 
information indicated that this subject had a recurrent or new cancer. Consequently, this TEAE was 
appropriately not reported as an Adverse Event Qualifying for Special Notification. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Neither serum chemistry nor haematology parameters showed clinically meaningful variations from 
baseline after etranacogene dezaparvovec treatment, except elevated liver parameters in up to 18/57 
(31.6%) patients. Hence, no safety concerns arise from serum chemistry or haematology observations. 
Clinically significant abnormalities regarding liver parameters and CRP and related TEAEs are discussed 
in detail above. Elevated liver parameters were included in section 4.8 of the SmPC and adverse events 
of elevated CRP levels were added upon request as well. 
In the post-treatment period of Study CT-AMT-061-02 the absence of vector DNA shedding, defined as 
3 consecutive samples with vector DNA levels < LOD, was confirmed in 37/54 (69%) and 30/54 (56%) 
subjects in semen and blood, respectively. The median time to absence of shedding was 52.3 weeks in 
blood and 45.8 weeks in semen at 24 months post-dose. Considering also shedding results obtained 
from the final 2 available consecutive samples, a total of 47/54 (87%) and 40/54 (74%) patients were 
identified to have reached absence of vector DNA from blood and semen, respectively, at 24 months 
post-dose. Upon request, the applicant has included a sufficiently detailed description of these 
observations in 5.2 of the SmPC.

treatment Safety Population)

Figure 6. Kaplan-Meier Curve for Time to First Vector Shedding Negative From Blood (Post-
treatment Safety Population)   
In the absence of infectivity assays the duration of recommended contraception should be based on 
the available clinical study data. As the median time to vector shedding negative in semen was 45.8 
weeks (95% CI 34.1, 52.1 weeks) and samples from 9 subjects were still positive for vector DNA at or 
after day 182 (updated Listing 3.8.2), the proposed recommended 6 months of double-barrier 
contraception were not considered sufficient and were extended to 12 months of barrier contraception. 
The applicant was asked to update section 4.6 of the SmPC to reflect that 12 months of barrier 
contraception are recommended. 
Moreover, horizontal transmission is considered as an important potential risk due to declining levels of 
residual capsid and vector fragments shed through body fluids. The SmPC, Healthcare Professional 
Brochure and Patient Card should inform that patients treated with etranacogene dezaparvovec must 
not donate blood or organs, tissues and cells for transplantation. The requested information is 
currently included in 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Levels of inflammatory markers IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1 were generally within the normal range after 
treatment with etranacogene dezaparvovec. Levels of IL-2 were transiently elevated in some patients 
but were below detection limit from Month 4. IFNγ levels were ≥LLOQ for the majority (44/54 [81.5%]) 
of subjects prior to dosing, and all patients had levels ≥LLOQ at least once following treatment. Overall, 
no new safety concerns arise since most inflammatory markers were unaffected or only transiently 
elevated. 
AFP levels appeared unaffected by treatment with etranacogene dezaparvovec. Nevertheless, two 
subjects had elevated AFP: One subject had elevated baseline AFP and post-dose AFP and another 
subject had 1 elevated AFP value at Month 12. Upon request, the applicant provided the rationale why 
it is not necessary to control AFP levels in a yearly manner in all patients treated with etranacogene 
dezaparvovec. It was agreed that AFP levels alone would not provide adequate information, and that it 
is sufficient to recommend regular monitoring of AFP levels along with liver ultrasound screenings in 
patients with pre-existing risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma only (SmPC 4.4). There were only 
minor changes in vital signs, the majority being mild to moderate in severity.  
Shifts in abdominal ultrasound results from normal to abnormal occurred in 14/31 (45.2%). Upon 
request, reasons why some patients (26) had delayed baseline assessment (post-treatment) were not

sufficiently explained and it cannot be excluded that abnormalities observed in 11/26 subjects were 
absent before dosing and evolved/worsened after receiving Hemgenix. Upon request, the applicant 
presented more details for the 11 subjects with delayed or missed baseline ultrasound assessment, 
who had abnormal ultrasound results, in order to assess a possible relationship with Hemgenix. In 
6/11 subjects a causal relationship between abnormalities reported and treatment-related TEAEs was 
ruled out due to the lack of biological plausibility. No treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 4/11 
subjects. In the remaining subject, not clinically significant hepatic steatosis was present at the 
baseline ultrasound scan 37 days post-treatment, and treatment-related TEAE transaminitis was 
reported within the first 47 days post-dose, which is likely attributed to the treatment with 
etranacogene dezaparvovec. It cannot be excluded that the observed not clinically significant hepatic 
steatosis in this patient is also a result of treatment with etranacogene dezaparvovec. During the 
additional 6 months of follow up provided with the updated 2-year CSR, 5 subjects had shifts in 
ultrasound scan results from normal to abnormal, which were all considered not clinically relevant by 
the applicant. Monitoring of hepatic function to mitigate the risk of potential hepatotoxicity is 
appropriately reflected in Section 4.4 of the SmPC.

Not applicable 
2.6.8.6.  Safety in special populations 
No clinically relevant safety differences by age, race, ethnicity, or BMI were noted in the 2 
etranacogene dezaparvovec studies. 
Of the 57 subjects treated with AMT-061, one subject was between 75 and 84 years of age and 6 
subjects were between 65 and 74 years of age. The experience in elderly subjects is therefore limited 
and considered adequately reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Neoplasms were observed in 3/50 (6.0%) patients below 65 years of age (total 4 events) and in 3/7 
(42.9%) subjects ≥65 years (total 7 events). Treatment-emergent SAEs were observed in 9/50 
(18.0%) patients below 65 years of age and in 6/7 (85.7%) subjects ≥65 years. One SAE 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma was reported in one subject ≥65 years of age. 
No unexpected differences in safety outcomes were observed between the age groups. More SAEs and 
neoplasms were observed in the elderly population, which were all considered not related to study 
drug, and may be expected in elderly patients. The SAE of Hepatocellular Carcinoma is described in the 
discussion section. 
All subjects in Studies CT-AMT-060-01 and CT-AMT-060-02 were male. Therefore, no data exists on 
the effects of etranacogene dezaparvovec on pregnancy or lactation in a controlled clinical setting. 
However, 2 pregnancies were reported in partners of male subjects enrolled in phase 1 Study CT-AMT-
060-01, performed with AMT-060, the wild-type FIX predecessor of etranacogene dezaparvovec, 
resulting in viable, healthy offspring. Upon request, the applicant submitted the corresponding 
Development Safety Update Report (DSUR Version 8, reporting period 20-Aug-2020 to 19-Aug-2021, 
date of report 11-Oct-2021).  
Animal studies with mice did not indicate any harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. 
Etranacogene dezaparvovec use has not been studied in breastfeeding women. It is not known 
whether etranacogene dezaparvovec is excreted in human milk. No clinical studies have been 
performed to evaluate the effects of etranacogene dezaparvovec on impairment of fertility. Effects on

male and female fertility have been evaluated in animal studies with mice. No adverse impact on the 
fertility was observed. “Use in female patients” was included as missing information in the safety 
specifications upon request (see the RMP section). 
In absence of available data in females on the non-clinical and clinical levels, the section 4.6 of the 
SmPC was completed upon request, with some amendments suggested (see comment in SmPC). 
Although haemophilia is a rare condition in women, a strategy plan to eventually be able to treat 
women of childbearing potential with haemophilia B with etranacogene dezaparvovec in the future 
would be welcomed.

2.6.8.7.  Immunological events 
Bioanalytical methods 
At the beginning of clinical development the applicant has developed and validated an IgG and an IgM 
specific AAV-5 screening and titre assay. The missing confirmation assay was included into the ADA 
assessment strategy in a second development and assay validation campaign, prior to Phase III 
investigations. In brief, the screening assay consists of an ELISA, where AAV-5 coated to microtitre 
plates interacts with diluted serum. The specific IgG or IgM fraction is detected after a washing step by 
an anti-human IgG- or IgM-HRP conjugated antibody in presence of TMB and hydrogen peroxide. A cut 
point was set to reach a false positivity rate of 5% in the screening assay, based on 35 naïve individual 
human serum samples. Plate specific, floating cut-points were calculated by using a calibrator on each

plate. Positive samples only were further assessed for AAV-5 specific IgG or IgM titres using the same 
assay setup and eight linear dilution levels from 1:50 to 1:109350. Data points were fitted using a 
five-parameter logistic algorithm, and titres corresponded to the inverted dilution factor of the 
extrapolated intersection of the dilution curve with the assay cut-point. Both assays were validated for 
their precision, specificity and robustness, based on predefined acceptance criteria, which seem 
adequate, and which were met. Cut points were determined based on a 5% false positivity rate, which 
is recommended for screening assays. Assay precision, as well as selectivity and robustness were 
analysed and seem suitable for the intended application. Positive and negative controls as well as QC 
samples were properly determined. In 2019, a three tiered ADA assessment concept was adopted by 
implementing a confirmation assay, and all assays were re-evaluated. The presented approach in 
principle is acceptable. 
The applicant has developed and validated a screening and confirmation ELISA for the assessment of 
human FIX specific immunoglobulins in human serum. In the screening assay human FIX coated to 
microtitre plates interacts with 1:50 diluted serum. FIX-specific Ig’s are detected after a washing step 
by an anti-human IgG,A,M-HRP conjugated antibody in presence of TMB and hydrogen peroxide. A cut 
point was set to reach a false positivity rate of 5%, based on a sufficient number of individual human 
serum samples of naïve healthy individuals. The omission of a patient specific and FIX deficient matrix 
was justified by the applicant. Plate specific, floating cut-points were applied based on a human serum 
calibrator assessed on each plate, enabling to discriminate between anti-FIX positive and negative 
serum samples. To confirm positivity, samples which were screened reactive were assessed in the 
same setting, but pre-incubated with human FIX. For this confirmatory assay, a cut-point was defined 
based on 50 serum samples from naïve healthy donors, reflecting a false-positive rate of 1%. The set-
up of both assays and the determination of assays specific cut-points seems appropriate. Both assays 
were initially validated for early clinical assessment, and re-validated in 2019 prior to Phase III studies. 
The chosen assay format lacks suitable human controls and validation was performed in a setting of 
limited relevance. Reported clinical anti-FIX levels were low, and confirmed by data from the anti-FIX 
neutralisation assay. Thus, the suitability of the assay for the intended purpose is supported. The 
validity of the assay was confirmed in human serum matrix. 
The applicant has developed a luciferase- and a GFP-based HEK293//17 cellular neutralizing antibody 
assay, to assess the presence of AAV-5 specific neutralising antibodies. The use of cellular 
neutralisation assays is highly endorsed. Both have shown to detect the same entity, i.e. AAV5-
neutralizing antibodies. Of the two, the luciferase-based assay appears to be the more sensitive, and 
was further applied in clinical trials. It was transferred and outsourced to Charles River, including 
banking of cell stocks. In brief, samples were analysed in seven 1:3 serial dilutions, and relative 
inhibitions were calculated for each dilution level. The calculated IC50 from the fitted relative inhibition 
curve is reported. The assay design including sample dilution, evaluation, positive and negative 
controls is considered state of the art, and seems acceptable. As outcome from an initial feasibility 
study, the assay cut-point was established based on a 1% false-positive rate, using 48 human serum 
samples from healthy donors. In a second validation study, assay performance regarding assay 
precision and reproducibility as well as robustness (including sample storage stability and effects of 
potentially interfering substances like haemoglobin up to 6.7 g/l haemoglobin and lipids) were 
assessed and met pre-defied acceptance criteria. The assay was tolerant to described substances, 
clinical samples were stable for 14 months, and the murine control antibody for 10 months. Eventually 
the assay was evaluated for performance at Precision for Medicine, regarding its selectivity, specificity, 
cross-reactivity, analytical cut-point, range, precision, sensitivity, linearity, carry-over, and sample 
stability. Assay precision was assessed for three individual positive control serum samples at three 
concentration levels and a positive neutralisation control over 6 individual assay runs, by in total three 
different analysts. Validation samples consisted of a murine monoclonal human AAV-5 capsid protein 
specific antibody spiked into immune-depleted human serum, which seems adequate. The assay seems

qualified for the intended semi-quantification of anti-AAV5-specific neutralising antibodies in human 
serum samples. All critical reagents and their provenience were described and cell banking reports 
were provided. 
An IFNy ELISpot Assay was developed and validated for the detection of AAV-5 Specific Cell Mediated 
Immunity. An initial validation of this method was performed with the purpose to ensure that the assay 
performs with adequate reproducibility and specificity, and that it is linear over a defined range. 
Validation of the IFNy ELISpot assay for the detection of immune responses to AAV-5 whole virus was 
performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from two different donors that have 
previously demonstrated a positive response towards AAV-5. The validation parameters included 
linearity, precision (reproducibility) and specificity. Many results did not fulfil the pre-determined 
criteria, especially for the PBMCs of one donor. It was concluded that the assay could still be useful and 
that the donors probably had a low number of precursor anti-AAV5 cells and that resulted in low 
number of SPF that would explain the high variability observed. 
A second generation IFNγ ELISpot validation for AMT-061 with PBMC Lot 13830 was carried out. The 
response of Accucell™ cryopreserved PBMCs previously shown to respond to AAV-5 stimulation (Lot 
13830) was tested for precision, sensitivity, repeatability, and reproducibility. 
This study successfully validated the IFNy ELISpot assay for monitoring the cellular immune response 
to uniQure's adeno-associated virus type 5 (AA V-5) capsid gene therapy candidate AMT-061. The 
stimulation of PBMC Lot 13830 with AMT-061 Lot Al8POOI yielded results that were repeatable within a 
plate, across plates, and across operators. The lowest number of cells that could be plated to precisely 
detect antigen-reactive cells following stimulation was 300,000 cells per well. Accucell™ cryopreserved 
PBMC Lot 13830 yielded a specific response and can be included as a control sample in clinical sample 
testing from trials measuring responses to AMT-061 Lot Al8POOI. 
The method was shown to perform well when used to measure the cellular immune response against 
AMT-061. 
Immunogenicity 
At baseline, in the ISS Safety Population, nearly half [24/57 (42.1%)] of the subjects were positive for 
anti-AAV5 nAbs, with a median titre of 1:39.20. In Study CT-AMT-061-02, by Week 3 post dose, nAb 
levels were positive for all (53/53 [100%]) subjects assessed (median titre: 1:8748 [range: 1:8748, 
1:8748]; upper limit of quantification: titre = 8748) and remained elevated through Month 24 post 
dose.  Upon request, the applicant confirmed that the rapid development of nAbs did not affect 
transgene expression as evidenced by the increase in FIX activity in all subjects regardless of AAV5 
nAbs post dose, and would not be relevant for the safety of patients treated with etranacogene 
dezaparvovec. 
Likewise, all patients converted to anti-AAV5 IgG positive latest 3 weeks post treatment with 
increasing titres, which persisted over at least 24 months. Most patients had transiently increased anti-
AAV5 IgM between 1-3 weeks, with decreasing titres up to 12 months post treatment, when 10/53 
(18.9%) subjects remained positive. At month 24 post treatment, 11/52 (21.2%) subjects were 
positive for anti-AAV5 IgM. As expected, mean FIX activity levels post-treatment were higher in 
patients without pre-existing AAV nAbs compared to patients with pre-existing AAV nAbs. 
In the ISS Safety Population, the majority (56/57 [98.2%]) of subjects tested negative for anti-FIX 
antibodies at baseline before etranacogene dezaparvovec dosing. One subject was positive for anti-FIX 
antibodies at baseline in study CT-AMT-061-01 in the screening assessment, but not in the 
confirmation assessment. Both assessments were negative by month 24. The subject’s FIX activity 
levels were 37.9% at Week 12, 51.0% at Week 26, 50.2% at Week 52 and 41.5% at Month 36, thus 
no considerable reduction in FIX activity levels was observed at any time point. In study CT-AMT-061-
Assessment report

02 one subject tested positive for anti-FIX antibodies prior to dosing and post-treatment to month 6. 
The subject’s FIX levels appeared at the lower end (8.4% at Month 6, 11.4% at both Month 12 and 
Month 18, and 10.1% at Month 24 post-treatment), but was temporally independent of the occurrence 
of anti-FIX antibodies. 
Reassuringly, no FIX inhibitors were observed up to 24 months post-treatment. Subjects with FIX 
inhibitors have been excluded from the studies. The possible occurrence of FIX inhibitors should further 
be monitored for a total follow-up length of 10 years.  
Availability of results on AAV capsid specific T cell responses is limited, since there were missing data 
due to issues related to insufficient number of cells and nonconformance in the analysis. Yet, the 
majority of subjects [39/54 (72.2%) in Study CT-AMT-061-02] had at least one time point with 
detectable T cell response. The highest number of detectable T cell responses occurred at week 6 
[15/38 [39.5%] subjects in Study CT-AMT-061-02], which is slightly earlier than would typically be 
expected from gene therapy products (7-10 weeks). According to the applicant, the majority of T cell 
responses were transient and did not lead to a decrease in FIX activity. 6/39 (15.4%) subjects had 
concurrent TEAEs of ALT Increased and / or AST Increased, and of those 2 received corticosteroid 
treatment. Increased liver enzymes are expected following T cell responses to rAAVs that target the 
liver as expression system. 
2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interaction studies have been performed, as no interactions are to be expected from the 
endogenous protein hFIXco-Padua. However, owing to its mode of action, potential liver toxicity 
following the administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec may occur. Upon request, the applicant 
added detailed information to 4.5 of the SmPC pertaining to monitoring of concomitant medications, as 
well as ALT and FIX activity after etranacogene dezaparvovec treatment. Furthermore, it is advised to 
avoid potentially hepatotoxic medications or other hepatotoxic agents and both, the risk of reduced 
efficacy and an increased safety risk, are highlighted. Prescribers are also made aware of medications 
potentially impacting corticosteroid treatment, as well as potential interactions of vaccines with 
immunomodulatory therapy. 
2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One subject prematurely discontinued from treatment due to a TEAE of Hypersensitivity (received 
partial dose). The subject continued in the study for follow-up. 
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
Not applicable. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database of AMT-061 (etranacogene dezaparvovec) to support a market authorisation to 
treat adults with haemophilia B consists of data from two trials: 3 subjects received AMT-061 in Study 
CT-AMT-061-01 (an ongoing, 5-year, phase 2b, open-label, single-dose, single-arm, multicentre 
study); and 54 subjects received AMT-061 in Study CT-AMT-061-02 (an ongoing, pivotal, phase 3, 
open-label, single-dose, single-arm, multinational study, which included a ≥ 6-month Lead-in Period 
with standard of care continuous FIX prophylaxis).  
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 120/149 
 
 
 
The safety data from these 57 participants were combined in the Integrated Summary of Safety 
(Integrated Summary of Safety [ISS] Population). Of note, one subject received only 10% of his 
designated dose due to a hypersensitivity reaction during infusion. Supportive data with 5-year safety 
follow-up are available from 10 subjects who received the predecessor product AMT-060 (expressing 
WT human Factor IX) during study CT-AMT-060-01. 
Overall, the number of recruited subjects and the safety database are very limited. However, the 
clinical development programme was discussed and agreed by SAWP/CHMP during several EMA 
Scientific Advice (EMA-SA) procedures (e.g., EMA/CHMP/SAWP/301451/2018).  
The study population included in the clinical trials is considered acceptable for the safety assessment of 
AMT-061 in this rare disease. Due to the small sample size, subpopulations like elderly patients or 
patients with HIV are not sufficiently represented to allow any statements regarding a potentially 
different response and treatment of these subgroups. 
In total, 57 subjects were followed-up for 1547.5 person-months post-dose. 54 participants have a 
duration of exposure >24 months. One subject died on study day 464.  
Following an initial data submission, the applicant provided a safety data update upon request, 
including additional 6 months of data. Within the period until the new data cut-off, there have been no 
deaths, no related SAEs, 3 unrelated SAEs, no further reports of cancer, 2 AEs of Transaminase 
Increased (both considered not related to study treatment), no further use of steroids for elevated 
transaminases, and no FIX inhibitors detected. No increased rate of TEAEs was noted (99 new TEAEs 
were reported during the additional 6 months of follow up vs. 514 TEAEs reported during the first 18 
months post-dose).  
Adverse Events 
Lead-in Period 
Of the 54 subjects who finished the lead-in period (and received treatment with AMT-061), 37 (68.5%) 
reported 87 AEs, with nasopharyngitis (n=8, 14.8%) and arthralgia (n=4, 7.4%) as the most 
frequently reported AEs. Overall, it appears that at least some AEs shown in safety tables for the lead-
in period could have been caused by background disease or other pre-existing conditions. Considering 
that the participants received their routine standard of care FIX prophylaxis, some of them most likely 
for many years, the comparability of the safety profile between the lead-in period and the period after 
administration of the gene therapy may be limited (potential underreporting of AEs during the lead-in 
study). In addition, the duration of the lead-in period was also considerably shorter (≥6 months) than 
the follow-up time until after administration of AMT-061, further limiting the comparability. 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) 
All participants in the ISS Safety Population (n=57) experienced at least 1 adverse event and a total 
number of 613 AEs were reported. The highest incidences of AEs were reported for the system organ 
classes (SOCs) of Infections and Infestations (73.7%), Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue 
Disorders (68.4%), General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (56.1%), Gastrointestinal 
Disorders (47.4%), Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (45.6%), Nervous System 
Disorders (43.9%), and Investigations (42.1%). 
The highest subject incidences, irrespective of investigator causality assessment, were reported for the 
following TEAEs (by PT): arthralgia (36.8%), headache (31.6%), nasopharyngitis (26.3%), fatigue 
(24.6%), ALT Increased (21.1%), back pain (19.3%), COVID-19 (17.5%), pain in extremity (15.8%), 
AST increased (15.8%), and Blood Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) increased (15.8%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 121/149 
 
 
 
56 subjects (98.2%) reported 460 mild (grade 1) TEAEs, 39 subjects (68.4%) reported 135 moderate 
(grade 2) TEAEs, and 11 subjects (19.3%) reported 18 severe (grade 3) TEAEs. Serious Adverse 
Events are described in a section below.  
The incidence of adverse events in the SOC of Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (including 
Cysts and Polyps) appears rather high for these small trials (6 subjects [10.5%] with 11 events, events 
described in the results section above). The following events were reported: adenoma benign, basal 
cell carcinoma, benign breast neoplasm, colon adenoma, gastrointestinal lymphoma, gastrointestinal 
neoplasm, hepatocellular carcinoma, meningioma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, prostate cancer, 
and skin papilloma. According to the Investigator, all events were considered unrelated (or “unlikely” 
related) to treatment. The applicant was requested to provide (updated) narratives for all AEs in the 
SOC of neoplasms, also for possible future events. The applicant summarised background information 
for observed TEAEs. Overall, the provided information do not raise a new safety concern. According to 
the applicant, the TEAE of Gastrointestinal Lymphoma was a coding error. The study site was 
contacted for follow-up and the investigator clarified that the subject had a diagnosis of Colon 
Adenoma (verbatim term: tubular adenoma of colon) since 2015 and not a new TEAE of 
Gastrointestinal Lymphoma (verbatim term: worsening of nodule at ileocecal valve). The applicant 
describes that no information indicated that this subject had a recurrent or new cancer.  
The TEAE of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumour (verbatim: Pancreatic lesion, possible neuroendocrine 
tumour) was reported. Upon request, the applicant clarified that a nonspecific nodular focus of uptake 
at the pancreatic body / tail was observed on a PET scan, which was performed to further assess the 
subject’s colon adenoma. Subsequently, a dedicated pancreas CT protocol was performed and 3 follow-
up CT scans did not reveal abnormal findings. Thus, the presence of a Pancreatic Neuroendocrine 
Tumour was not confirmed. 
Treatment-related TEAEs 
Based on the assessment of the Investigator, 95 treatment-related AEs were reported for 39 
participants (68.4%) in the ISS Safety Population. Common treatment-related TEAEs by SOC 
experienced by subjects were General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (19 [33.3%]), 
Investigations (13 [22.8%]), Nervous System Disorders (10 [17.5%]), and Gastrointestinal Disorders 
(8 [14.0%]). The most frequently reported treatment-related AEs (by PT) were ALT increased (9 
subjects [15.8%] with 10 events), headache (9 subjects [15.8%] with 10 events), influenza-like illness 
(7 subjects [12.3%] with 8 events), AST increased (5 subjects [8.8%] with 6 events), Blood Creatine 
Phosphokinase increased (4 subjects [7%] with 6 events), dizziness, fatigue, nausea (each by 4 
subjects [7%] with 4 events).  
The reported treatment-related TEAEs were mostly mild (27 subjects [47.4%]) or moderate (11 
subjects [19.3%]). One subject (1.8%) reported two severe treatment-related events (ALT and AST 
increased). 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) by Anti-AAV5 nAb Status at Baseline 
The applicant presented a comparison of the safety profile between subjects who were seropositive for 
anti-AAV5 nAb at baseline vs. those who were seronegative. If one would simply divide the number of 
events by the number of subjects, this results in a slightly higher rate of AEs per subject in the 
seropositive subgroup (mean 12 AEs per subject vs. mean 9.9 AEs per subject). However, there is no 
difference regarding treatment-related AEs (mean 1.6 per subject [seropositive] vs. 1.7 AEs per 
subject [seronegative]). The incidences for the events of ALT increased and AST increased were higher 
in seronegative subjects. 
Interestingly, all treatment-related AEs of C-reactive Protein increased (3 events in 3 subjects) were 
reported in subjects who were seropositive for anti-AAV5 at baseline. This may indicate an increased 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 122/149 
 
 
 
risk for excessive inflammation in subjects seropositive for anti-AAV5. One event (grade 2) had a 
duration from Day 77 until Day 183 post treatment. The applicant included this event as adverse drug 
reaction in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Overall, no major differences were noted between the groups (seropositive vs. seronegative for 
baseline anti-AAV5 nAbs). However, the sample size is too limited to allow firm conclusions. 
Hepatotoxicity 
In the ISS Population, 12 participants (21.1%) had 14 TEAEs of ALT Increased and 9 participants 
(15.8%) had 10 TEAEs of AST Increased. One subject with a TEAE of AST Increased had an isolated 
event whereas in the remaining 6 subjects, the AST Increased occurred at the time of an ALT 
Increased. Five subjects had an isolated TEAE of ALT Increased. Two subjects each had a TEAE with PT 
of transaminases increased; in one Subject, the event occurred 218 days after infusion and was 
reported as ‘elevated AST, ALT’ and in the other Subject, the event occurred 740 days after infusion 
and was reported as ‘alcohol related transaminase increase’. Most of these TEAEs were mild or 
moderate in severity, but 1 subject had elevations in AST and ALT that were reported as severe. No 
subject met the definition of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). 
Nine subjects (15.8% of the ISS Population) used systemic corticosteroids for transaminase elevations 
in the Post-treatment Follow-up Period of Study CT-AMT-061-02. The mean corticosteroid treatment 
duration for those subjects was 79.8 days [range 51 to 130 days]. These nine subjects received 
steroids as treatment for the liver enzyme elevations of either > ULN (n = 8) or > 2 × baseline value 
(n = 1), including prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone. All transaminase elevations that 
were treated with steroids had an onset within 3 months post dose, with the earliest onset at Week 3. 
All subjects discontinued steroid use before Week 26.  
All TEAEs regarding elevated transaminase were non-serious and resolved. One subject in study CT-
AMT-061-01 had moderate TEAEs of ALT increased, AST increased, and blood creatine phosphokinase 
increased between Days 787 and 806 that resolved without treatment. 
Several questions were raised, including the assessment of severity and/or relatedness of certain cases 
of enzyme elevations, and the potential for recurrence of transaminitis after 24-month follow-up. The 
responses are summarised in the respective AE section further above.  
Transiently elevated liver parameters are expected due to the mechanism of action of etranacogene 
dezaparvovec. Importantly, based on the provided information, the currently available 2-year data do 
not raise a concern regarding reoccurrence or late onset of transaminitis after treatment with 
etranacogene dezaparvovec. Hence, the clinical safety profile regarding potential hepatotoxicity could 
be considered acceptable.  
Serious Adverse Events and deaths 
In the ISS Safety Population, 15 (26.3%) subjects experienced 18 treatment-emergent SAEs. Of the 
18 SAEs reported for the ISS Safety Population, 2 were mild (grade 1) in severity, 8 were moderate 
(grade 2), and 8 were considered as severe (grade 3). No SAE was considered related to treatment. 
According to information provided in the CSR, the Investigator initially considered the events of 
transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and HCC as “possibly related” to treatment. Upon further 
investigations, both events were reassessed as “unlikely related”.  
One death was reported in Study CT-AMT-061-02. This Subject was a White male aged between 75 to 
84 years with a medical history of atrial enlargement, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension, that 
experienced a fatal event of Cardiogenic Shock on Study Day 464, following a urinary tract infection. 
The Investigator considered the event of Cardiogenic Shock as severe in intensity and unrelated to 
study medication. Based on the provided information and considering that the patient experienced 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 123/149 
 
 
 
atrial fibrillation prior to enrolment (since 2019), no objection regarding the Investigator’s assessment 
is made. However, it cannot be excluded that treatment with AMT-061 could have worsened the state 
of the patient.  
Treatment-emergent Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
One SAE of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was reported in Study CT-AMT-061-02 in a male subject 
agreed between 65 to 74 years with multiple risk factors including a history of Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, 
alcohol use, and fatty liver disease. The subject did not show evidence of significant fibrosis / cirrhosis 
or steatosis at screening or before treatment with etranacogene dezaparvovec. Chest computerised 
tomogram (CT) with angiography that included visualisation of the upper abdominal organs 2 weeks 
post treatment and liver ultrasound on Day 84 post treatment revealed no liver abnormalities. On 
study Day 365, ultrasound per study protocol revealed a subcapsular lesion. Upon fine needle 
aspiration, the lesion was subsequently confirmed as HCC.  
Results of an integration site (IS) analysis were briefly described in the patient narratives. The 
applicant describes that numerous integration sites were detected (56 unique ISs in the HCC and 39 
unique ISs in the HCC-adjacent sample respectively), but no dominant IS was identified, which would 
speak against the possibility of clonal expansion of tumour cells. For both HCC and HCC-adjacent 
samples, a high number of vector-vector fusion sequences was detected, demonstrating that 
approximately 1 out of 10,000 vector genomes were integrated in the host genome. Further, it is 
stated that miRNA analysis identified genes known to be associated with the progression and 
development of HCC, consistent with HCC-risk typical for patients with chronic hepatitis C. 
The applicant was requested to provide further information on the case of HCC. Due to a largely 
successful trans-arterial chemoembolisation procedure, no residual primary tumour samples from 
segment 8 were available following explantation of the subject’s liver. Therefore, several randomly 
chosen samples were procured for further analysis. These include vector copy number and FIX-Padua 
mRNA analyses. According to the applicant, no results were available at the time of the submission of 
the responses to the LoOI. The outcome of these analyses will be submitted once available. Additional 
integration site analyses are not planned as no identifiable tumour was present in the provided liver 
samples. 
It was confirmed that specimens from the secondary lesion (in segment 2/3) and adjacent tissues (and 
not the primary tumour in segment 8) were used for integration analysis. The primary lesion was not 
excised due to the complex location of the lesion and procedure-related risk. 
In addition, a comprehensive HCC analysis report was provided. The main messages from this report 
were already correctly presented in the patient narratives submitted with the initial data submission. 
These narratives already mentioned that the HCC sample as well as the HCC-adjacent sample revealed 
mutations in a variety of genes that have been previously associated with HCC, suggesting a 
premalignant state rather than healthy liver tissue. However, further details regarding the observed 
mutations were missing in the initial data package. The provided analysis report describes genomic 
alterations in a plethora of genes which have been associated with HCC. 
Overall, the additional detailed information is considered supportive regarding the assumption that the 
patient’s liver tissue could already have been in a premalignant state. However, it is unknown whether 
the gene therapy could to some extent have contributed to development of HCC. 
Expert reports were also submitted. All three experts describe that the patient was at increased risk of 
developing hepatocellular carcinoma due to several viral and non-viral risk factors. Especially the 
genomic alterations commonly seen in HCC and literature suggesting an increased risk after HCV 
eradication were pointed out. 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023

Additional other concerns were raised with regards to the relevance of published literature (e.g., 
LaBella et al 2020, Dalwadi et al 2020) for AMT-061. The applicant was asked to explain the strategy 
on how to gain further knowledge on the extent of vector integration after administration of AMT-061. 
It is acknowledged that performing liver biopsies only for the purpose of trying to obtain data on 
integration and tumorigenicity would not be justified. It is expected that in case of (hepatic) tumours, 
full genomic sequencing of possible tumours would be performed to substantiate the potential risk of 
integrative events in (hepatocyte) clones. In addition, the applicant was asked to commit to make 
available the option for genomic sequencing to be conducted on (hepatic) tumours if they emerge from 
any patients in the post-authorisation studies. According to the responses, the applicant intends to 
investigate potential cases of HCC in a similar manner as the HCC case during the AMT-061-02 trial 
(provided informed consent by the patients). The observational long-term follow-up study will include 
respective wording. Further, the applicant commits to make available the option for genomic 
sequencing to be conducted on potentially relevant tumours if they emerge from any patients in the 
post-authorisation studies. Adequate information has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The uncertainty regarding carcinogenicity cannot be resolved, since the follow-up duration during the 
trials is too short and the sample size too small. The currently available information suggests that 
there might be a lifelong risk of insertional mutagenesis and subsequently carcinogenesis. Therefore, it 
is of utmost importance that every potential recipient of the treatment is well-informed about these 
risks prior to administration. As included in the RMP, the applicant is expected to prepare a concise and 
well-understandable patient information document that informs about this irreversible risk prior to 
administration of Hemgenix. Additional risk minimisation measures (guide for healthcare professionals, 
patient guide and patient card) are requested in the RMP and Annex II–D. 
Adverse Events Qualifying for Special Notification 
Nineteen AEs Qualifying for Special Notification were reported in 12 (21.1%) subjects. These 19 events 
coded to 17 separate PTs and the majority of these AEs were mild or moderate (18/19 events) in 
severity and considered treatment-related (14/19 events). 
Seven subjects experienced TEAEs Qualifying for Special Notification related to IP administration; ie, 
Infusion Related Reaction (2 [3.5%]), Hypersensitivity (1 [1.8%]), Infusion Site reaction (1 [1.8%]), 
Dizziness (2 [3.5%]), Eye pruritus (1 [1.8%]), Flushing (1 [1.8%]), Headache (1 [1.8%]), Abdominal 
Pain Upper (1 [1.8%]), Urticaria (1 [1.8%]), Chest Discomfort (1 [1.8%]), and Pyrexia (1 [1.8%]). 
Three subjects with infusion reactions related to IP required a dose interruption. Five of the 7 subjects 
were positive for anti-AAV5 nAbs at baseline. One of the 7 subjects had a TEAE of Hypersensitivity. The 
event occurred during administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec and resulted in discontinuation of 
treatment and receipt of a partial dose (approximately 10%). After implementation of a protocol 
amendment, which incorporated guidance for study sites on the management of infusion reactions, no 
further treatment discontinuations occurred. 
The SmPC includes information regarding infusion-related dose interruptions (section 4.8), including 
potential treatment options based on clinical judgement (section 4.4), which is supported. 
An event “drug ineffective” was reported by a participant who had by far the highest anti-AAV5 nAb 
titre at baseline.   
Three subjects had TEAEs Qualifying for Special Notification related to the development of any new / 
recurrent cancer. These included TEAEs of HCC (onset 365 days after etranacogene dezaparvovec 
treatment), Prostate cancer (onset: 350 days after etranacogene dezaparvovec treatment), and Basal 
Cell Carcinoma (onset: 550 days post dose), which were all assessed as not treatment-related (see 
sections above).  
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 125/149 
 
 
 
Risk for thrombosis/thromboembolic events 
There were four TEAEs in 3 subjects identified as potentially relating to a thromboembolic event in 
Study CT-AMT-061-02. These were PTs of Angina Pectoris (2 events), Peripheral Arterial Occlusive 
Disease (1 event) and Transient Ischaemic Attack (1 event). The cases of Angina pectoris and 
Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease were assessed by the investigator as not related to IP and 1 
serious TEAE of Transient Ischaemic Attack was assessed by the investigator and the Sponsor as 
unlikely related to IP. The subjects described above had relevant vascular and cardiac medical histories 
preceding the thromboembolic events. Also, these subjects belong to an aging population above 65 
years who are more likely to experience cardiac and vascular events (see the results section for more 
details). 
Thromboembolic events are considered as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
Laboratory findings 
Currently, no safety concerns arise from serum chemistry or haematology observations. Elevated liver 
parameters, which were observed in up to 18 (31.6%) patients, are discussed in the context of related 
TEAEs and potential hepatotoxicity above.  
Most inflammatory markers were unaffected (IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1) or only transiently elevated (IL-
2, IFNγ). Two subjects had elevated AFP. Regular monitoring of AFP levels along with liver ultrasound 
screenings in patients with pre-existing risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma is recommended 
(SmPC 4.4). Vital signs did not raise any safety concerns. Occurring shifts in ultrasound results from 
normal to abnormal [14/31 (45.2%)] do not raise specific concerns at the moment. 
Vector DNA shedding 
In the post-treatment period of Study CT-AMT-061-02 the absence of vector DNA shedding, defined as 
3 consecutive samples with vector DNA levels < LOD, was confirmed in 37/54 (69%) and 30/54 (56%) 
subjects in semen and blood, respectively. The median time to absence of shedding was 52.3 weeks in 
blood and 45.8 weeks in semen at 24 months post-dose. Considering also shedding results obtained 
from the final 2 available consecutive samples, a total of 47/54 (87%) and 40/54 (74%) patients were 
identified to have reached absence of vector DNA from blood and semen, respectively, at 24 months 
post-dose. Upon request, the applicant has included a sufficiently detailed description of these 
observations in 5.2 of the SmPC. In the absence of infectivity assays the duration of recommended 
contraception should be based on the available clinical study data. As the median time to vector 
shedding negative in semen was 45.8 weeks (95% CI 34.1, 52.1 weeks) and samples from 9 subjects 
were still positive for vector DNA at or after day 182 (updated Listing 3.8.2), the proposed 
recommended 6 months of double-barrier contraception were not considered sufficient and were 
extended to 12 months of barrier contraception. This information was included in section 4.6 of the 
SmPC upon request. In addition, the SmPC appropriately informs that patients treated with 
etranacogene dezaparvovec must not donate blood or organs, tissues and cells for transplantation. 
Safety in Special Populations 
The experience in elderly subjects is limited and considered adequately reflected in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC. From the available data, no unexpected differences in safety outcomes were observed between 
the age groups. More SAEs and neoplasms were observed in the elderly population, which were all 
considered not related to study drug. 
Two pregnancies were reported in partners of AMT-060 (the wild-type FIX predecessor of etranacogene 
dezaparvovec) treated subjects and no clinical sequelae in the mothers or newborns were noted. The 
applicant submitted the Development Safety Update Report (DSUR) upon request. 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 126/149 
 
 
 
There is no clinical data regarding administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec to female subjects. 
Consequently, there is also a complete lack of clinical knowledge regarding fertility in humans or the 
question whether etranacogene dezaparvovec is excreted in human milk. “Use in female patients” was 
included as missing information in the safety specifications upon request (see the RMP section). 
Although haemophilia is a rare condition in women, a strategy plan to eventually be able to treat 
women of childbearing potential with haemophilia B with etranacogene dezaparvovec in the future 
would be welcomed.   
Immunological events 
All patients converted to anti-AAV5 IgG positive and AAV nAb positive at the latest 3 weeks post 
treatment, and most patients had transiently increased anti-AAV5 IgM between 1-3 weeks. As 
expected, mean FIX activity levels post-treatment were higher in patients without pre-existing AAV 
nAbs compared to patients with pre-existing AAV nAbs. Upon request, the applicant confirmed that the 
rapid development of nAbs did not affect transgene expression regardless of AAV5 nAbs post dose, and 
would not be relevant for the safety of patients treated with etranacogene dezaparvovec. 
One subject was positive for anti-FIX antibodies at baseline in study CT-AMT-061-01 in the screening 
assessment, but not in the confirmation assessment. Both assessments were negative by month 24. In 
study CT-AMT-061-02 one subject tested positive for anti-FIX antibodies prior to dosing and post-
treatment to month 6. Both subjects’ FIX levels were temporally independent of the occurrence of anti-
FIX antibodies. No FIX inhibitors were observed up to 24 months post-treatment. The possible 
occurrence of FIX inhibitors should further be monitored in case increased plasma Factor IX activity 
levels are not achieved, decrease, or bleeding is not controlled or returns.  
Availability of results on AAV capsid specific T cell responses is limited due to missing data related to 
insufficient number of cells and nonconformance in the analysis. From the available data, the majority 
of subjects had at least one time point with detectable T cell response, but most were transient and did 
not lead to a decrease in FIX activity. 6/39 (15.4%) subjects had concurrent TEAEs of ALT Increased 
and / or AST Increased, and of those 2 received corticosteroid treatment. 
Drug-drug interactions 
No specific interaction studies for etranacogene dezaparvovec have been performed. However, owing 
to its mode of action, potential liver toxicity may occur. Upon request, the applicant added detailed 
information to 4.5 of the SmPC pertaining to monitoring of concomitant medications, as well as ALT 
and FIX activity after etranacogene dezaparvovec treatment. Furthermore, it is advised to avoid 
potentially hepatotoxic medications or other hepatotoxic agents and both, the risk of reduced efficacy 
and an increased safety risk, are highlighted. Prescribers are also made aware of medications 
potentially impacting corticosteroid treatment, as well as potential interactions of vaccines with 
immunomodulatory therapy. 
Supportive Safety Data from Study CT-AMT-060-01 
The open-label, uncontrolled study CT-AMT-060-01 was conducted with two doses of AAV5-hFIXco 
(AMT-060), the predecessor of etranacogene dezaparvovec, and is therefore considered supportive 
only. The primary objective of study CT-AMT-060-01 was to assess the 5-year safety profile of AMT-
060. Most TEAE were mild or moderate in severity, one SAE of myelopathy was categorised as severe, 
not treatment-related, and resolved by study completion. Three SAEs (hepatic enzyme increased, 
pyrexia, ALT increased) were considered treatment-related. Three TEAE qualifying for special 
notification involving increased liver parameters were reported and treated with corticosteroids. The 
safety data revealed no additional concerns, as increased liver parameters are expected due to the 
Assessment report

mode of action of the IMP. All subjects stopped shedding vector DNA from blood and semen in study 
CT-AMT-060-01.  
One death occurred outside the study period. The patient in the age group from 65 to 74 years was 
found lifeless on the living room floor and was considered to have died from a natural cause and no 
autopsy was requested or planned. The investigator assessed the relationship between AMT-060 and 
death as being unlikely related. 
Overall, the safety and efficacy profile of AMT-060 would support a favourable benefit/risk balance of 
etranacogene dezaparvovec. The CSR for ongoing long-term extension study CT-AMT-060-04 is 
expected in September 2026. 
In summary, based on the (limited) short to medium-term safety data, gene therapy with AMT-061 
was relatively well tolerated by the majority of study participants. The most significant short-term 
safety concern are potential hypersensitivity reactions. Of note, one participant only received 10% of 
his designated dose due to hypersensitivity. Some other patients also reported infusion related 
reactions (e.g., urticaria, eye pruritus, flushing, dizziness, pyrexia), but received the full dose. For 3 
patients the infusion was temporarily paused and resumed at a reduced infusion rate after treatment 
with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids. Considering that only one administration of AMT-061 is 
necessary, the risk of hypersensitivity appears manageable. 
Currently, the most relevant medium-term safety concern seems to be the risk of experiencing 
elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST), which may necessitate treatment with corticosteroids. Intake of 
corticosteroids over an extended period of time poses its own risk of developing adverse events. Of 
note, a nonclinical study suggests that liver injury increases the risk of HCC in mice who received AAV 
gene therapy (Dalwadi et al. 2020). 
The potential risk of malignancy as a result of vector integration will remain an important uncertainty 
that can only be addressed by long-term (over decades or life-long) safety observation of a much 
larger number of patients who received AMT-061. Due to the very limited sample size, uncommon or 
rare events were most likely not captured by the presented clinical studies. This needs to be addressed 
by post marketing surveillance. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Therapy with AMT-061 was relatively well tolerated by the majority of patients. The most relevant 
short to medium-term safety concerns are hypersensitivity reactions during administration and 
elevated transaminases that may require treatment with glucocorticoids in some patients. 
Biopsies from a patient who developed a hepatocellular carcinoma revealed vector integration in the 
tested samples, thereby confirming nonclinical findings. However, the patient had several non-viral and 
viral risk factors, including genomic alterations in several genes which have been associated with HCC, 
which were also found in HCC-adjacent tissues.  
Upon request, the applicant provided a safety update with 6 months additional follow-up. The new 
safety data did not reveal a new safety concern. 
Overall, the safety profile is considered acceptable. Diligent post marketing surveillance is of utmost 
importance to detect potential rare adverse events and to investigate the potential risk of malignancy 
(due to vector integration) on the longer term. Patients must be well-informed about this to receiving 
etranacogene dezaparvovec. In this regard, a warning has been added to the SmPC and package

leaflet to inform on the potential risk of malignancy as a result of vector integration in liver cells and in 
other body cells. 
These aspects are covered in the SmPC and Package leaflet and in the educational materials in the 
RMP, as reflected in Annex II. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on clinical safety as described above.

2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant requested alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 22 November 2022. The new EURD list entry 
will therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request for a translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant proposing that the details listed in Article 54 appear in only one official 
language (English) on all packaging components (vial and outer carton) and the package leaflet. The 
main ground of the justification was the low estimated number of patients treated per country due to 
the low incidence/prevalence of the condition in the EU, and the fact that the medicinal product will 
administered by healthcare professional in a clinical setting. 
The QRD The Group partially accepted this translation exemption request. All Member states agreed to 
have an EN only vial label. For the outer carton, a bi-lingual carton English(EN)/Germany(DE) should be 
provided.  An  English  only  package  leaflet  was  not  accepted.  The  QRD  group  agreed  that  a  printed 
package  leaflet  in  English  is  included  inside  the  secondary  packaging  (outer  carton).  However,  the 
applicant should distribute the translated printed package leaflets in the national language alongside the 
cartons. 
2.9.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Hemgenix (etranacogene dezaparvovec) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as  
• 
• 
• 
It contains a new active substance 
It is a biological product 
It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Hemgenix is for the treatment of severe and moderately severe Haemophilia B (congenital Factor IX 
deficiency) in adult patients without a history of Factor IX inhibitors. 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 136/149 
 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The primary aim of care for patients with haemophilia B is to prevent bleeding. Replacement therapy 
with exogenous FIX provides a temporary correction of the coagulation factor deficiency by increasing 
FIX levels and thereby reducing bleeding. 
Factor IX Prophylaxis 
Prophylaxis with FIX should be considered in all people with severe haemophilia B (including those 
classified as non-severe according to their basal FIX levels but with a severe bleeding phenotype); in 
these HB patients, prophylaxis should be initiated as early as possible (i.e. prior to the onset of joint 
bleeding), and thereafter, treatment should not be interrupted. Both SHL-FIX and EHL-rFIX are 
effective treatment options for prophylaxis and either SHL-FIX or EHL-FIX products can be used to 
offer adequate haemostatic cover for bleeds, surgery and invasive procedures. Dose and frequency of 
prophylactic FIX treatment should be adapted to the clinical phenotype (e.g. bleed rates) and lifestyle 
considerations, and not based exclusively on plasma trough levels. The current treatment options for 
haemophilia B have several limitations. Treatment with prophylactic regular IV injections of FIX is not 
curative and very demanding due to the need for frequent IV infusions and concomitant risk for 
infection and thromboses related to the placement of indwelling catheters. Periodic or regular FIX 
infusion results in peaks and troughs in plasma factor levels allowing for breakthrough bleeding 
episodes. Due to these factors, poor adherence to treatment is a concern and a major contributing 
factor to failure of prophylaxis, associated with increased risk of bleeding and subsequent joint 
damage, thereby adding to the all-cause morbidity and mortality rate. 
There is also a risk of developing neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against the administered FIX. The 
burden of the disease is high, both for the individual subject and their families, and for society. Due to 
(long-term) impairments in mobility and functional status, subjects may not be able to fully participate 
in social activities, such as sports, school, or work. Living with haemophilia can have a substantial 
effect on mental wellbeing, particularly among young people and signs of major depressive disorder 
are not uncommon. The economic burden for the society is significant. 
There remains an unmet medical need in HB since available treatment options require long-term, 
chronic treatments with a high degree of compliance to the prescribed treatment schedule to be 
effective. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical study programme consists of four studies. The initial phase 1 study, CT-AMT-060-01, and 
its long-term extension study CT-AMT-060-04, used the predecessor product AMT-060 and are 
considered supportive. No CSR is available for the LTE study at the present time. The main evidence 
for efficacy and safety derives from the phase 2b trial CT-AMT-061-01 and the pivotal trial CT-AMT-
061-02, in which a combined 57 subjects were enrolled. Two and a half years of follow-up is available 
for the phase 2 study, and 1.5 years for the pivotal study. 
CT-AMT-061-01 is an ongoing Phase IIb trial consisting of a screening phase, a treatment plus post-
treatment follow-up phase, and a long-term follow-up phase. After a maximum 6-week screening 
period, 3 subjects received a single IV dose of 2 × 1013 gc/kg AMT-061. Subjects were monitored for 
tolerance to AMT-061 and detection of immediate AEs for 24 hours (overnight stay) after dosing. The 
dosing of the subjects was separated by a minimum of 14 calendar days to allow for subject safety 
monitoring and to ensure appropriate action could be taken in case any acute reactions were observed. 
CT-AMT-061-02 (Health Outcomes with Padua Gene; Evaluation in Hemophilia B [HOPE B]) is an 
ongoing open-label, single-dose, multicentre, multinational trial, with a screening phase/period, a lead-

in phase/period, a treatment plus a post-treatment follow-up phase/period, and a long-term follow-up 
phase/period. During the lead-in phase, which lasted a minimum of 26 weeks, subjects recorded their 
use of FIX replacement therapy and bleeding episodes in their dedicated e-diary in order to provide a 
baseline of bleeding event frequency and FIX consumption. Of the 67 subjects who entered the lead-in 
period, 13 discontinued and 54 subjects were dosed with AMT-061. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the phase 2b study CT-AMT-061-01, mean FIX activity level at Week 6, the time of the primary 
endpoint read-out, was 30.6 % measured by the one-stage assay. Individual FIX activity levels 
achieved by each subject at Week 6 were 23.9%, 30.0%, and 37.8%. At Week 52, FIX activity level 
was 40.8% measured by the one-stage assay. Individual FIX activity levels achieved by each subject 
at Week 52 were 31.3%, 40.8%, and 50.2%. At Month 36, the mean FIX activity level was 36.90%, 
uncontaminated samples were available for 2 subjects and demonstrated that FIX activity levels 
continued to be elevated, at 32.3% and 41.5%, respectively. 
The average ABR for the 3 subjects, calculated as the total number of bleeding episodes divided by the 
time (in years) at risk, was 0.22 over the period of 3 years (36 months) of follow-up. The ABRs for 
spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes over 3 years (36 months) were both 0.11. There were 
no bleeding episodes between 2.5 and 3 years of follow-up (both bleeding episodes occurred in the 
first 18 months post-AMT-061 administration). These ABR values are low, but as this trial had no run-
in phase specified in the protocol, a comparison to meaningful pre-treatment data is not possible. 
In the pivotal trial CT-AMT-061-02, a significant reduction of unadjusted mean ABR could be shown 
comparing the lead-in period ABR of 4.11 to the post-treatment ABR of 1.08 recorded during months 7 
to 18. The pre-specified NI analysis encompassing a comparison of ABR between the lead-in (4.19) 
and post-treatment (1.51) period estimated from a negative binomial regression model was significant 
and non-inferiority to FIX prophylaxis could be declared. In addition, the secondary outcome of 
superiority over FIX prophylaxis could also be shown. 20.4% of subjects reported joint bleeding 
episodes post-treatment, compared to 59.3% of during lead-in. The number of subjects who did not 
experience any bleeding event more than doubled during month 7-18 [34/54 (63.0%)] compared to 
baseline [14/54 (25.9%)]. With the responses to the D120 LoQ, an ABR analysis for months 7-24 after 
treatment was provided (not adjusted for multiplicity). The unadjusted ABR was 0.99, with the 
adjusted ABR 1.51 (0.83, 4.76). 27 (50.0%) of subjects reported no bleeding episode from month 7-
24. 27.8% of subjects reported joint bleeds between month 7-24.         
FIX activity levels showed clinically relevant values at month 6 (mean 38.95; median 37.30), continued 
to increase until month 12 (mean 41.48; median 39.90) and then declined slightly until month 18 
(mean 36.90; median 35.55) and remained steady at month 24 (mean 36.66; median 33.85). No 
subject recorded values >150%. External factor IX consumption as well as external FIX infusion rate in 
the post-treatment period declined to approximately 3% of the value observed during the lead-in 
period. Fifty-two of 54 subjects remained free from FIX replacement therapy during the follow-up 
period of 24 months. One of the two subjects who had to return to FIX replacement therapy received 
only about 10% of the intended dose of AMT-061 due to hypersensitivity and the second had a high 
anti-AAV5 nAb titre at baseline and did not respond to treatment with Hemgenix. 
In supportive study CT-AMT-060-01, the mean endogenous FIX activity levels in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 
ranged from 2.8% to 8.2% and 4.0% to 10.7% of normal based upon the one-stage (aPTT-based) FIX 
assay, respectively, and remained stable during the post-tapering period (i.e., after discontinuation of 
FIX prophylaxis post-AMT-060 administration) up to 5 years.

EMA/46569/2023  
Page 138/149 
 
 
 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The generalizability of the efficacy results was questioned due to a low number of patients in this single 
pivotal study (n= 54) together with the fact that 19% of the patients in the lead-in period did not 
continue into the actual study.  
One subject with a nAb titre >3000 at baseline was found to be a non-responder to treatment with 
AMT-061, while all other twenty subjects who exhibited anti-AAV5 nAbs at baseline developed clinically 
relevant FIX activity levels and could terminate prophylaxis with exogenous FIX products. These 
subjects were found to have titres up to 678.2 at baseline, and apart from increased FIX activity they 
also reported a statistically significantly reduced annualised bleeding rate compared to the lead-in 
period using their usual FIX prophylaxis. In the context of the conditional marketing authorisation, the 
applicant has committed to conduct further investigation of the effectiveness of Hemgenix regardless 
of the preexisting anti-AAV5 nAb titre in a post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES). 
Some decline of FIX activity could be noticed during the 18 months of follow-up available in the 
submitted interim CSR. Some subgroups achieved appreciably lower levels of FIX activity, therefore 
this decline could lead to the need for a return to factor replacement in the near future. In order to 
further elucidate the durability of the response, the applicant committed in the context of the 
conditional marketing authorisation to submit the final study results, including 5 years’ follow-up, of 
studies CT-AMT-061-01 and CT-AMT-061-02. During long-term monitoring post marketing, safety and 
efficacy parameters will be collected up to 15 years and increase the understanding of the durability of 
the achieved FIX activity. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
All participants in the ISS Safety Population (n=57) experienced at least 1 adverse event and a total 
number of 613 AEs were reported. The majority of events were mild (incidence 98.2%, 460 AEs) or 
moderate (incidence 68.4%, 135 AEs) in severity. Severe events were reported by 11 subjects 
(19.3%, 18 AEs). 
Based on the assessment of the Investigator, 95 treatment-related AEs were reported for 39 
participants (68.4%). The most frequent related AEs were ALT increased (9 subjects [15.8%] with 10 
AEs), Headache (9 subjects [15.8%] with 10 AEs), Influenza-like illness (7 subjects [12.3%] with 8 
AEs), AST increased (5 subjects [8.8%] with 6 AEs), Blood Creatine Phosphokinase increased (4 
subjects [7%] with 6 AEs), Dizziness, Fatigue, Nausea (each by 4 subjects [7%] with 4 AEs). The 
reported treatment-related TEAEs were mostly mild (27 subjects [47.4%]) or moderate (11 subjects 
[19.3%]). One subject (1.8%) reported two severe treatment-related events (ALT and AST increased). 
TEAEs related to IP administration: Seven subjects experienced TEAEs Qualifying for Special 
Notification related to IP administration; i.e. Infusion Related Reaction (2 [3.5%]), Hypersensitivity (1 
[1.8%]), Infusion Site reaction (1 [1.8%]), Dizziness (2 [3.5%]), Eye pruritus (1 [1.8%]), Flushing (1 
[1.8%]), Headache (1 [1.8%]), Abdominal Pain Upper (1 [1.8%]), Urticaria (1 [1.8%]), Chest 
Discomfort (1 [1.8%]), and Pyrexia (1 [1.8%]). One of the 7 subjects had a TEAE of Hypersensitivity 
during administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec and resulted in discontinuation of treatment and 
receipt of a partial dose (approximately 10%). Three subjects with infusion reactions required a dose 
interruption. The infusions resumed at a lower infusion rate with or without additional treatment with 
corticosteroids and/or antihistamines. Section 4.4 of the SmPC already includes a warning statement in 
this regard. 
TEAEs by Anti-AAV5 nAb Status at Baseline: While a slightly higher rate of AEs per subject was 
observed in participants who were seropositive for anti-AAV5 nAbs (mean 12 AEs per subject vs. mean 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 139/149 
 
 
 
9.9 AEs per subject), there was no difference regarding treatment-related AEs (mean 1.6 per subject 
vs. 1.7 AEs per subject). Five of the 7 subjects who reported TEAEs related to IP administration were 
positive for anti-AAV5 nAbs at baseline. The incidence of SAEs was higher in the subgroup of 
participants who were seropositive at baseline (37.5%, 10 SAEs in 26 subjects), compared to 
participants who were seronegative (15.2%, 5 SAEs in 33 subjects). Based on the evaluation of the 
type of reported SAEs, it seems that positive anti-AAV5 NAb status at baseline does not raise safety 
concerns with etranacogene dezaparvovec treatment itself but may contribute to the need of remaining 
on prophylaxis with FIX replacement therapy.  
Hepatotoxicity: Nine subjects (15.8% of the ISS Population) used systemic corticosteroids for 
transaminase elevations after administration of AMT-061. The mean corticosteroid treatment duration 
for those subjects was 79.8 days [range 51 to 130 days]. These nine subjects received steroids as 
treatment for the liver enzyme elevations of either > ULN (n = 8) or > 2 × baseline value (n = 1), 
including prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone. All transaminase elevations that were 
treated with steroids had an onset within 3 months post dose, with the earliest onset at Week 3. All 
subjects discontinued steroid use before Week 26. All TEAEs regarding elevated transaminase were 
non-serious and resolved. One subject in study CT-AMT-061-01 had moderate TEAEs of ALT increased, 
AST increased, and blood creatine phosphokinase increased between Days 787 and 806 that resolved 
without treatment. No additional immunosuppressive treatment (other than corticosteroids) was 
necessary for any patient. 
Serious Adverse Events and deaths: In the ISS Population, 15 (26.3%) subjects experienced 18 
treatment-emergent SAEs. Of the 18 SAEs, 2 were mild (grade 1) in severity, 8 were moderate (grade 
2), and 8 were considered as severe (grade 3). No SAE was considered related to treatment.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The evaluation of the safety profile of Hemgenix is challenging due to multiple factors: lack of a control 
arm, small sample size, limited data on long term follow-up, and potential consequences of non-clinical 
and clinical findings related to integration of AAV. 
Rare/uncommon adverse events: The sample size is too small to detect rare or uncommon adverse 
events. Even some common events may have not been detected.  
Vector integration, potential carcinogenicity and long-term safety: Vector integration was observed in 
nonclinical studies with mice and cynomolgus macaques. The integration site analysis study performed 
on liver biopsies of mice and cynomolgus monkeys showed low level of vector integration. While 
recombinant AAV are not expected to integrate their genome in host cells at high frequency, all 
integration events could potentially contribute to tumoral transformation. 
Vector integration confirmed by human liver biopsies from one participant of the clinical trials. 
Considering the lack of data in other patients (no other human biopsies available), detailed estimations 
regarding vector integration cannot be made. 
One case of hepatocellular carcinoma was observed during Study CT-AMT-061-02. The event was 
considered unlikely related by the Investigator with support from an external expert group.  
Considering the small sample size and the limited follow-up duration, the theoretical risk of malignancy 
due to vector integration cannot be estimated, which remains an uncertainty for the B/R assessment. 
Hepatotoxicity: Some patients required corticosteroid treatment for elevated transaminases. All 
participants were tapered off within the first half year. Until the data cut-off, no participant 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 140/149 
 
 
 
experienced reoccurrence of elevated transaminases. However, due to the limited data, a potential 
reoccurrence of elevated transaminases requiring treatment cannot be excluded. 
Concomitant hepatotoxic medications: There is lack of data regarding the concomitant use of 
hepatotoxic agents. 
Use in patients with liver impairment or active infections: Patients with advanced fibrosis, other hepatic 
disorders like uncontrolled HIV or active hepatitis B/C infections were excluded from the clinical trials. 
Due to the safety profile (elevated transaminases, potential risk of carcinogenicity) and the fact that 
the liver is the target organ for this gene therapy, section 4.3 of the SmPC includes contraindications 
for patients with active infections (either acute or uncontrolled chronic) and for patients with known 
advanced hepatic fibrosis, or cirrhosis. 
Patients seropositive for anti-AAV5 nAbs prior to treatment: While no meaningful differences between 
seropositive and seronegative patients were noted regarding the overall profile of adverse events, the 
(limited) clinical data suggest a trend for an increased risk for infusion reactions (including 
hypersensitivity) in patients who are seropositive prior to treatment. The majority of participants who 
reported TEAEs related to IP administration were seropositive, including the subject who discontinued 
due to a hypersensitivity event. The risk of infusion-related reactions will be further characterised in 
the post-marketing setting. 
Lack of data in patient subgroups: The clinical data in subgroups such as elderly, subjects of different 
ethnicities, or HIV-positive patients is limited. No female haemophilia B patients were recruited. 
Vector shedding and horizontal/vertical transmission: In the absence of respective assays, infectivity of 
the shed material has to be assumed, according to the ICH guideline (EMEA/CHMP/ICH/449035/2009). 
Median time to vector shedding negative in semen was 45.8 weeks (95% CI 34.1, 52.1 weeks) and 
samples from 9 subjects were still positive for vector DNA at or after day 182. Based on the available 
clinical data, a recommendation for barrier contraception for 12 months was included in section 4.6 of 
the SmPC.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The submitted clinical efficacy data show a statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction of 
bleeding frequency, i.e from 4.19 at baseline to 1.51 post-treatment in subjects treated with 
Assessment report

Hemgenix. The ABR recorded during post-treatment months 7-18 was compared to the same subjects’ 
bleeding frequency during the lead-in period of at least 6 months, where the standard of care, 
prophylactic FIX replacement, was administered. 
Endogenous FIX activity achieved clinically relevant levels, i.e. a median of 39.9% at month 12 in the 
majority (52/54) of subjects, with no subject showing supraphysiologic FIX activity. Use of exogenous 
FIX as well as FIX infusion rate fell to approximately 3% of values reported during lead-in. 
Updated efficacy data from 24 months of follow-up from pivotal trial AMT-061-02 and 36 months of 
follow-up from trial AMT-061-01 continue to show satisfactory outcomes with regard to clinically 
relevant FIX activity (mean 36.66; median 33.85) and a sustained low ABR of 0.99 (adjusted 1.51; 
CI:0.83, 4.76).  
The durability of the therapeutic effect has been shown to be stable up until 24 months of follow-up in 
the pivotal trial. In order to further elucidate the durability of the response, the applicant committed in 
the context of the conditional marketing authorisation to submit the final study results, including 5 
years’ follow-up, of studies CT-AMT-061-01 and CT-AMT-061-02. During long-term monitoring post 
marketing, safety and efficacy parameters will be collected up to 15 years and increase the 
understanding of the durability of the achieved FIX activity. 
Subjects were enrolled into the pivotal study irrespective of their pre-existing anti-AAV nAb titre. 
Twenty subjects were found to have titres up to 1:678.2 at baseline, and 33 subjects were negative. 
While overall a numerically lower mean Factor IX activity was observed in patients with pre-existing 
neutralising anti-AAV5 antibodies, no clinically meaningful correlation was identified between patients` 
pre-existing anti-AAV5 antibody titre and their factor IX activity at 18 months post-dose. One patient 
with a titre of 1:3212 at screening did not respond to etranacogene dezaparvovec treatment, with no 
factor IX expression and activity. Further investigation of the effectiveness of Hemgenix will be 
conducted in a post-authorisation efficacy study regardless of the pre-existing anti-AAV5 nAb titre. 
Based on the limited short to medium-term safety data, gene therapy with AMT-061 was relatively well 
tolerated by the majority of study participants. The majority of reported adverse events were mild or 
moderate in severity.  
The most significant short-term safety concerns are potential infusion related (and hypersensitivity) 
reactions. One administration was discontinued and for some patients the infusion was temporarily 
paused and resumed at a reduced infusion rate after treatment with antihistamines and/or 
corticosteroids. Considering that only one administration of AMT-061 is necessary, the risk of 
hypersensitivity appears manageable.  
The most relevant medium-term safety concern seems to be the risk of experiencing elevated liver 
enzymes (ALT, AST), which may necessitate treatment with corticosteroids in some recipients of AMT-
061. Intake of corticosteroids over an extended period of time poses its own risk of developing adverse 
events. Of note, a nonclinical study suggests that liver injury increases the risk of HCC in mice who 
received AAV gene therapy (Dalwadi et al. 2020). 
Vector integration was shown in mice and cynomolgus monkeys, and has been confirmed by biopsies 
from a trial participant who developed a hepatocellular carcinoma during the clinical trial. This may 
indicate a long-lasting, potentially life-long risk of malignancy as a result of vector integration. It is 
very likely that the significant uncertainty regarding carcinogenicity cannot be resolved in the near 
future, since the follow-up duration during the trials is too short and the sample size too small. 
The sample size of the presented clinical trials is too small to detect rare or uncommon adverse events. 
Even some common events may not have been detected. This would need to be addressed by post 
marketing surveillance.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The short- to medium-term magnitude and durability of the demonstrated clinical benefits (i.e. 
clinically relevant levels of endogenous FIX activity, improvement of bleeding frequency over standard 
of care, minimal need for external factor replacement) of treatment with Hemgenix are considered to 
outweigh the observed short- to medium-term safety concerns (i.e. infusion reactions, influenza-like 
illness, headache, transaminitis). 
There are still uncertainties with regard to the durability of the effect and long-term safety (i.e. hepatic 
safety, risk of malignancy as a result of vector integration), which have to be addressed in the context 
of the CMA and by the multi-year follow-up investigations as requested in the Guideline on safety and 
efficacy follow-up and risk management of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (EMEA/149995/2008 
rev.1). 
Overall, the Benefit/Risk is considered positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Comprehensive efficacy and safety data are lacking in the current MAA. 
The sample size of 57 patients is considered very small. While the two years of follow-up provided 
show that the expression of FIX activity appears to be stable over this duration, the long-term 
durability of the treatment effect and long-term safety are still unknown factors.  
Furthermore, uncertainties remain regarding the impact of neutralizing anti-AAV capsid antibodies on 
efficacy and safety and these cannot be comprehensively characterised based on the limited available 
data. 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was 
proposed by the CAT during the assessment and agreed by the applicant. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a seriously debilitating disease. In 
addition, the product is designated as an orphan medicinal product.  
Furthermore, the CAT considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data coming from the ongoing 
studies CT-AMT-061-01 and CT-AMT-061-02 and planned study CSL222_4001. The present 
limitations of the dataset will be addressed with three specific obligations intended to provide 
additional data on the durability of the effect and long-term safety (final CSRs of the phase II and 
phase III trials, SOB 1 and SOB 2) and efficacy in subjects with haemophilia B irrespective of 
baseline anti-AAV5 nAb titre (an interim analysis of the PAES CSL222_4001 after the first 50 
subjects have reached one year of follow-up; SOB 3). The data expected from these specific 
obligations will increase the available follow-up to 5 years, at present 24 months follow-up is 
available for 54 subjects and 36 months for 3 subjects. The 50 subjects to be included in the 
interim clinical study report of study CSL222_4001 will approximately double the available study 
population and are anticipated to allow further insights into efficacy outcomes across a broader 
range of baseline nAb titres. 
Assessment report  
EMA/46569/2023  
Page 144/149 
 
 
 
•  Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as Hemgenix requires a single intravenous administration 
that could free severe and moderately sever haemophilia B patients from therapeutic burden for at 
least 2 years while the available treatment options require a variable number of injections, i.e. 
frequent prophylactic infusion of exogenous FIX, or episodically at the time of a bleeding event. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. As benefit-risk balance on basis of the current data is 
regarded positive, an additional therapy option for severe haemophilia patients is considered 
beneficial. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on conditional marketing authorisation as described above.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Hemgenix is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on Benefit Risk balance as described above  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CAT by consensus is of the opinion that Hemgenix is not similar to Alprolix and Idelvion within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000.  
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on similarity as described above.  
Outcome 
Based on the CAT review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CAT considers by consensus that 
the benefit- risk balance of Hemgenix is favourable in the following indication: 
Hemgenix is indicated for the treatment of severe and moderately severe haemophilia B (congenital 
factor IX deficiency) in adult patients without a history of factor IX inhibitors. 
The CAT therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions:

To inform the patient of the important identified risk of hepatotoxicity and the 
important potential risks of horizontal and germline transmission, development of 
Factor IX inhibitors, malignancy in relation to vector genome integration, and 
thromboembolism, and details on how these risks can be minimised. 
•  Before a treatment decision is made, the healthcare professional should discuss the 
risks, benefits, and uncertainties of Hemgenix with the patient when presenting 
Hemgenix as a treatment option, including: 
Assessment report

o  That Hemgenix use will require in some cases administration of 
corticosteroids to manage the liver damage that this medicinal product might 
induce. This requires adequate monitoring of patients’ liver function and 
avoidance of concomitant use of hepatotoxic medication or agents, to 
minimise the risk of hepatoxicity and a potential reduced therapeutic effect 
of Hemgenix. 
o  That high preexisting neutralising anti-AAV5 antibodies may reduce the 
efficacy of Hemgenix therapy; patients should be assessed for the titre of 
preexisting neutralising anti-AAV5 antibodies before Hemgenix treatment. 
o  That there is a possibility of not responding to treatment with Hemgenix. 
Patients who do not respond are still exposed to long-term risks. 
o  That the long-term treatment effect cannot be predicted. 
o  That there would be no plans to re-administer the medicinal product for 
patients who do not respond or have lost the response. 
o  That the patients should be tested for Factor IX inhibitors to monitor 
development of Factor IX inhibitors. 
o  Reminding patients about the importance to enroll in a registry for follow up 
of long-term effects. 
o  The healthcare professional should provide the patient guide and patient card 
to the patient. 
The Patient/Care-giver Guide key messages: 
• 
• 
Importance to fully understand the benefits and risks of Hemgenix treatment, what 
is known and not yet known about the long-term effects, related to both safety and 
efficacy. 
Therefore, before a decision is made about starting on the therapy the doctor will 
discuss with the patient the following: 
o  That Hemgenix will, in some cases, require treatment with corticosteroids to 
overcome the liver damage that this medicine may produce, and that the 
doctor will ensure that patients are available for regular blood tests to check 
response to Hemgenix and assess liver health. Patients should inform the 
healthcare professional about current use of corticosteroids or other 
immunosuppressants. If the patient cannot take corticosteroids, the doctor 
may recommend alternative medicines to manage problems with the liver. 
o  That high preexisting immunity against the vector may reduce the efficacy of 
Hemgenix therapy; patients are expected to be assessed for the titre of 
preexisting neutralising anti-AAV5 antibodies before the Hemgenix 
treatment. 
o  That not all patients may benefit from treatment with Hemgenix. Patients not 
responding to treatment are still be exposed to long-term risks. 
o  Details how the important potential risks of horizontal and germline 
transmission, development of Factor IX inhibitors, malignancy in relation to 
vector genome integration, and thromboembolism can be recognised and 
minimised by regular monitoring as recommended by doctors, including that:

−  The patient should seek immediate medical advice for any symptoms suggestive of a 
thromboembolic event. 
−  Male patients of reproductive potential or their female partners should use barrier 
contraception for one year after administration of Hemgenix. 
−  That Hemgenix has a viral vector component, and it may be associated with an 
increased risk of malignant tumour. Regular liver monitoring for at least 5 years after 
Hemgenix treatment is needed in patients with preexisting risk factors for 
hepatocellular carcinoma. 
−  Patients should not donate blood, semen, or organs, tissues, and cells for 
transplantation 
o  That the patient will get a patient card that should be shown to any doctor or 
a nurse whenever the patient has a medical appointment. 
o  The importance to participate in the patients’ registry for long-term 
surveillance of 15 years. 
The Patient Card key messages: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
This card is to inform healthcare professionals that the patient has received 
Hemgenix for haemophilia B. 
The patient should show the patient card to a doctor or a nurse whenever they have 
an appointment. 
The patient should seek medical advice for any symptoms suggestive of a 
thromboembolic event. 
The patient should have regular blood tests and examinations as directed by their 
doctor. 
The card should warn healthcare professionals that the patient may undergo 
treatment with corticosteroids for minimising the risk of hepatotoxicity with 
Hemgenix. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on the additional risk minimisation measures.

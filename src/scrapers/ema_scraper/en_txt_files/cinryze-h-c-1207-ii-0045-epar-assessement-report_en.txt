Cinryze (C1 esterase inhibitor [human] or C1 INH) has marketing authorization in 36 countries. The 
intravenous (IV) administration of 1000 U of Cinryze every 3 or 4 days was approved in the US for routine 
prophylaxis against angioedema attacks in adolescent and adult patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE) 
in October 2008. In June 2011, IV administration of Cinryze was approved by the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) for the treatment, routine prevention, and pre-procedure prevention of angioedema attacks 
in adults and adolescents with HAE. 
Mechanism of action 
The primary function of C1 INH is to regulate activation of the coagulation, contact (bradykinin-forming), 
and complement pathways through the formation of pathway-specific complexes that result in inactivation 
of a target protease and consumption of C1 INH. With respect to the coagulation and contact pathways, C1 
INH inhibits factor XIIa, kallikrein, and plasmin, which are factors primarily involved in formation of blood 
clots (factor XIIa), clot dissolution (plasmin), and regulation of bradykinin (kallikrein). Bradykinin primarily 
regulates vasodilation and fluid release, and unregulated activation of bradykinin, which may occur in the 
absence of C1 INH, can lead to uncontrolled swelling or angioedema. C1 INH inhibits the complement system 
by binding C1r and C1s (2 of the active enzyme subunits of the first component of the complement system 
[C1]) in the classical pathway and mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases in the lectin pathway. 
The primary substrate of the activated C1 enzyme is C4; uninhibited C1 results in diminished C4 levels. 
Assessment report  
EMA/873329/2016

Because these pathways are part of enzyme amplification cascades, without C1 INH, spontaneous or 
trigger-induced activation of these pathways can lead to unopposed activation and swelling. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with Article 8(3) and (g) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, and the Guideline on 
Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), an 
Environmental Risk Assessment is not applicable to this Application as Cinryze (C1 esterase inhibitor 
[human]) is a protein.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The HAE Development Program for IV Cinryze supporting marketing approval included 8 clinical studies that 
allowed paediatric subjects to participate. Data was provided in the marketing authorization application 
(MAA) from 46 unique paediatric subjects (2 to <18 years of age) who participated in the Phase 3 studies:  
- 
Study LEVP 2005-1/A was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating Cinryze for the 
treatment of acute angioedema attacks in HAE subjects ≥6 years of age. Fifteen (15) paediatric subjects 
(6-17 years) participated in the study, with 12 subjects having exposure to Cinryze. 
- 
Study LEVP 2006-1 was an open-label study evaluating repeat exposure Cinryze in the treatment of 
acute angioedema attacks in HAE subjects ≥1 year of age. Twenty-four (24) paediatric subjects (2-17 years) 
participated in the study. 
- 
Study LEVP 2005-1/B was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating Cinryze for the 
prevention of angioedema attacks in HAE subjects ≥6 years of age. Four (4) paediatric subjects (9-17 years) 
participated in the study. 
- 
Study LEVP 2006-4 was an open-label study evaluating Cinryze for the prophylactic treatment to 
prevent angioedema attacks and as treatment for acute angioedema attacks in subjects ≥1 year of age. 
Twenty-three (23) paediatric subjects (3-17 years) participated in the study. 
In accordance with Regulation (EC) no. 1901/2006, the sponsor and the EMA agreed on a paediatric 
investigation plan (PIP) for Cinryze for the treatment and prevention of angioedema attacks in adolescents 
and children with C1 inhibitor deficiency. The PIP agreement was comprised of 4 clinical studies, 2 of which 
(LEVP 2006-1 and LEVP 2006-4) were completed and submitted with the original MAA and 2 new 
post-approval studies: 
- 
Study 0624-203 was an open-label, single-dose study of IV Cinryze in paediatric subjects that was 
conducted in the US. The study evaluated the response and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of 
different doses of Cinryze for the treatment of acute angioedema attacks in children ≥2 to <12 years of age 
with HAE. Nine subjects were enrolled and completed the study. 
- 
Study 0624-301 is an ongoing, randomized, single-blind, dose-ranging, crossover study of IV 
Cinryze conducted in the US and Europe. The study evaluates the response of 2 different doses of Cinryze 
(500 U and 1000 U) and 2 consecutive treatment periods (12 weeks) for the routine prevention of 
angioedema attacks in 12 children 6-11 years of age with HAE. In order to fulfill the PIP requirements it was 
agreed that the first 6 completed subjects would be included in an Interim Report.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study 0624-203 
Nine paediatric subjects aged 6-11 years were enrolled in this study. Subjects who could initiate treatment 
within 8 hours after onset of symptoms received Cinryze for treatment of a single acute attack. The IV doses 
Assessment report

of Cinryze evaluated were 500 U and 1000 U in children ≥10 kg to ≤ 25 kg and 1000 U and 1500 U in children 
>25 kg. 
Despite substantial recruitment efforts, subjects were not enrolled 1000 U dose group in the lower weight 
category. Therefore 9 subjects were enrolled and treated: 3 subjects (10-25 kg inclusive) received 500 U, 3 
subjects (>25 kg) received 1000 U and 3 subjects (>25 kg) received 1500 U IV Cinryze. All 9 subjects 
received a single dose of Cinryze and completed the study. It should be mentioned that the study covered 8 
female subjects, aged 6 to 11 years, all of them White. 
All subjects demonstrated an increase in C4 plasma concentrations above baseline at 24 hours post-infusion 
indicating that administration of exogenous functional C1 INH was affecting the downstream complement 
cascade in all subjects. 
Blood samples for PK evaluation were taken prior to Cinryze infusion, 1 hour and 24 hours post infusion. No 
subject agreed to the additional but optional blood sampling necessary to obtain a PK profile for antigenic 
and functional C1 INH levels (additional blood samples collected through 8 hours post-infusion on Day 1, and 
on Days 3, 5, and 8). As a result, no PK parameters were calculated for this study. 
Individual plasma concentrations of C1 INH antigen, functional C1 INH activity, and C4 for all subjects were 
measured (see Table, below). Following the administration of 500, 1000, or 1500 U of Cinryze, all subjects, 
with the noted exception of one subject, achieved increases in C1 INH plasma antigen and functional activity 
above baseline values at 1 hour and 24 hours post-Cinryze infusion. The 1 hour and 24 hours post-dose 
concentrations for this subject are less than the baseline pre-dose concentration. Although no deviation was 
reported by the site and this cannot be corroborated, it appears that this subject’s pre-dose and 1 hour 
post-dose samples were inadvertently switched or mislabeled. 
Six of 9 subjects (67%) achieved functional C1 INH concentrations ≥0.7 U/mL at 1 hour post-injection. It is 
also noteworthy that all subjects demonstrated an increase in C4 plasma concentrations above baseline at 
24 hours post-infusion, indicating that administration of exogenous functional C1 INH was affecting the 
downstream complement cascade in all subjects.

with HAE Following 500, 1000, and 1500 U IV Cinryze Administration – ITT-S Population (Study 0624-203) 
Study 0624-301 
Blood samples were collected for the assessment of antigenic and functional C1 INH (PK), and C4 levels 
(PD), in addition. Samples were taken pre-infusion and 1 hour post- infusion for Dose 1 (week 1), 12 (week 
6), and 24 (week 12) of each treatment period. Changes from baseline/ pre-dose level to 1 h post-dose were 
summarized for C1 INH antigen and C1 INH functional activity. The effect of Cinryze on complement C4 
concentrations was explored, in addition. 
Data Sets Analyzed 
Six paediatric subjects aged 7-11 years were enrolled in this study. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 
treatment sequences (A/B or B/A; A=500 U and B=1000 U), with each sequence consisting of two 12-week 
treatment periods. Subjects had to qualify for randomization by experiencing at least 1.0 angioedema attack 
(moderate or severe or required acute treatment) per month during the study’s 12-week baseline 
observation period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/873329/2016 
Page 10/65 
 
  
  
 
Two subjects were randomized to 500 U/1000 U Cinryze and 4 subjects were randomized to 1000 U/500 U 
Cinryze. All 6 subjects completed treatment (received 500 and 1000 U of Cinryze for 12 weeks each) and 
completed the study. 
The Pharmacokinetic Set included all subjects in the Safety Set who had evaluable pharmacokinetic profiles; 
that is, subjects who had plasma samples drawn and tested for C1 INH in which pharmacokinetic parameters 
could be derived. All 6 subjects were included in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses. 
It should be mentioned that the study covered 6 female subjects, aged 7 to 11 years, 5 white, one Hispanic 
ethnicity, 23-47 kg bodyweight, normal BMI. 
C1 INH Functional Activity Concentrations 
Unadjusted individual C1 INH functional activity 1 h after Cinryze administration by dose number is 
presented, below. A composite statistical value was calculated by averaging the 1 h post dose C1 INH 
functional activity level at Dose 12 and 24 (baseline adjusted by the corresponding pre-dose levels) to 
illustrate the dose response in each subject following Cinryze 500 U and 1000 U IV administration (see 
below). When the Cinryze dose increased from 500 U to 1000 U, the average values of Dose 12 and Dose 24 
functional C1 INH activity increased in the range of 41.5% to 157%.

Effect of Cinryze Treatment on Complement C4 Concentrations 
The effect of Cinryze treatment on the complement C4 levels was evaluated by the difference in complement 
C4 levels between baseline (prior to the first dose of Cinryze in Treatment Period 1) and pre-dose for Dose 
12 and Dose 24 as steady-state (see Table, below). The levels of C4 were fluctuating over the treatment 
periods, suggesting no appreciable effect of Cinryze treatment on the C4 levels.

Effect of Body Weight on C1 INH Functional Activity and C1 INH Antigen Concentrations 
C1 INH functional activity and plasma C1 INH antigen concentrations were assessed for the influence of 
subject’s weight on these levels following Dose 12 and Dose 24 for both 500 U and 1000 U Cinryze. There 
appeared to be a slight trend towards lower systemic C1 INH functional activity and C1 INH antigen 
concentration exposure as body weight increased. 
2.3.3.   PK/PD modelling 
Overview of Studies providing data for Population PK 
The hereditary angioedema (HAE) Development Program for intravenous (IV) Cinryze supporting marketing 
approval included 8 clinical studies for treatment of angioedema attacks and routine prevention 
(prophylaxis) of angioedema attacks in adults (≥ 18 years of age), adolescents (12-17 years of age), and 
children (2-11 years of age). In 2 new studies, 0624-301 and 0624-203 out of these eight studies, the

pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties of C1 INH in HAE paediatric populations for the 
treatment and prevention indications have been investigated. 
The specific objectives of this project were to perform population PK and exposure-response analyses to 
support dosing of IV Cinryze in paediatric patients for the prevention and treatment of HAE attacks.  
Data from table 8 were to be included in the population PK analysis. Table 9 gives an overview of clinical 
studies providing data on the pharmacology of cinryze in the management of HAE in the paediatric 
population. Descriptive statistics of categorical demographic data and continuous baseline characteristics 
are summarized in Table 10.

Table 10.  Summary of Baseline Characteristics – Categorical and Continuous Data 
A total of 278 (out of 354) subjects (unique subject ID) treated with Cinryze were included in the population 
PK dataset. Of the 354 subjects, a total of 165 and 162 subjects were enrolled in studies designed for the 
treatment and prevention of HAE attacks, respectively, and a total of 27 HAE subjects were enrolled in the 
PK study (LEVP 2006- 5).  
Of the 278 subjects included in the population PK analysis, 71.6% were female patients and 84.9% were of 
white origin. The combination of all studies provided a total of 61 paediatric patients (unique subject ID) with 
a total of 3, 32, and 26 subjects in the 2-5, 6-11 and the 12-17 years of age cohorts, respectively. Median 
(range) age and body weight were 35.1 years (2.5-82.7) and 69.6 kg (17.7 - 149.6), respectively. It is 
important to note that some subjects rolled-over in other studies. Baseline characteristics in these subjects 
were presented in the original study that they participated.

Considering the importance of assessing the effect of body weight and age in paediatric patients, the effect 
of missing body weight at baseline was explored. The number of patients with missing body weight at 
baseline is presented in Table 13. 
From 278 subjects (unique subject ID) 3712 samples were assayed for C1INH, resulting in a total of 3617 
measurable concentrations of C1INH included in the analysis. A total of 95 (2.6%) values were set to missing 
since concentrations were BLQ of the assay. 
A comparison of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data in paediatric subjects (<18 years) across the 
treatment and prevention trials are provided in the two tables below (Table 11). 
Table 11.  Range of Observed C1INH functional Activity, C1INH Antigen and C4 Concentrations in Paediatric 
Subjects (<18 Years) in Studies LEV206-001 and 0624-203 (Treatment, left) and LEV206-4 and 0624-301 
(Prevention, right) 
Exploratory analyses were first performed to visually assess concentration-time profiles of C1INH. All studies 
had sparse sampling, with the exception of study LEVP 2006-5 which was a dedicated PK study in HAE 
patients with rich concentration-time profiles.  
Individual concentration-time profiles of C1INH following single and two consecutive doses of Cinryze are 
presented in Figure 5.

Population PK Modeling of Functional C1INH and Model Evaluation 
Pop PK Approach 
A population PK analysis of C1INH was performed based on data collected paediatric patients for the 
prevention (Protocol 0624-301; N=6) and treatment (Protocol 0624-203; N=9) of HAE attacks.  
Assessment report  
EMA/873329/2016 
Page 20/65 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Due to the limited sample size of subject enrolled in younger age cohorts of Protocol 0624-301 and 
0624-203, the dataset was enriched by including PK data collected in paediatric and adult patients with HAE 
enrolled in other clinical studies.  
A one-compartment model, with baseline C1INH levels was used to assess the concentration-time profiles of 
functional C1INH following IV dosing of Cinryze. The population PK models included theoretical allometric 
functions on clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V) of functional C1INH:  
The above allometric function with fixed body weight (WT) effect on CL and V was used to scale PK 
parameters in paediatric subjects. 
The base and final model parameters after inclusion of covariates are presented in Table 12. 
Table 12.  Base and Final Model Including Covariates 
Evaluation of the base and final 1-compartment pop PK model 
Model evaluation and selection were based on standard model diagnostics and goodness-of-fit criteria and 
by looking at pertinent graphical representations of goodness-of-fit (e.g. fitted and observed concentrations 
versus time) as depicted in Figure 6. 
Assessment report  
EMA/873329/2016

The quality-of-fit of the base model was evaluated using standard graphical representations of goodness-of- 
fit (e.g. fitted and observed concentrations versus time, conditional weighted residuals). The following 
diagnostic plots were derived: 
•  Observed data (DV) versus population predicted data (PRED) and individual predicted data (IPRED) 
with a line of unity and a trend line. 
•  DV versus time after first administration (Time) and DV versus time after previous dose (TAD) with 
trend lines for IPRED and PRED. 
•  Conditional weighted residuals (CWRES) versus PRED, versus TAD and versus Time. 
•  Quantiles-quantiles plot of CWRES (QQ plot). 
The final population PK models was additionally qualified using a visual predictive check (VPC) to determine 
whether the model can appropriately simulate concentrations of C1INH within the range of those observed 
in the studies.

Covariate Analyses – Special populations 
A covariate analysis was performed to assess sources of variability in the overall patient population. The 
following covariates were explored: 
• 
• 
Intrinsic Factors:  Body Weight (as per allometric model), Age continuous, after taking into account 
body weight, Age categorical (2-5, 6-11 vs. 12-17 vs. adult), after taking into account body weight, 
Sex, Race, Baseline level of C1INH (as a single measure or average of pre-dose when available), 
Studies Designed for 1. Prevention of HAE 2. Treatment of HAE acute attacks 3. PK/HAE, HAE 
Attacks (Yes, No) 
Extrinsic Factors: Dose, LEVP Study (% activity converted to U) vs. non-LEVP study (U). 
The population PK model was used to derive exposure parameters of C1INH in various paediatric age cohorts 
and sub-populations of interests (race and sex) and ultimately compare exposure to adult patients with HAE. 
Assessment report  
EMA/873329/2016 
Page 23/65 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The relationships between covariates and PK parameters were firstly explored graphically to obtain 
information of covariates likely to affect the PK of functional C1INH. Scatter matrix plots presenting the 
relationships between the individual random effect of CL, V and endogenous C1INH and the continuous 
variables included locally weighted scatter plot smoothing (LOESS), Pearson correlation coefficients, and the 
corresponding p-value for each relationship. Box plots were used to describe the relationship for categorical 
covariates. 
In a second step, covariates were included in the full model based on scientific or clinical interest, 
mechanistic plausibility, a priori knowledge about covariate effects and greatest correlation with post hoc PK 
parameters. Continuous covariates (i.e., observed baseline C1INH, and age) were included in the structural 
model with the following power function: 
where θi is the population value for subjects with covariate equal to Covi, θTypical is the typical value of the 
PK parameter for subjects having the covariate equal to the reference value (Covreference) and θeff is the 
effect values of the covariate on parameter θ. Categorical covariates were introduced into the model using 
an “if statement”. 
Body weight 
Considering the importance of assessing the effect of body weight and age in paediatric patients, the effect 
of missing body weight at baseline was explored. The number of patients with missing body weight at 
baseline is presented in Table 13. 
Overall, a total of 20 paediatrics unique subject ID had missing body weight information at baseline. For 
subjects with missing body weight at baseline, a model-independent approach was used to enrich the 
datasets by imputing median body values in each group. Median values for male subjects in the 2-5, 6-11, 
12-17, 18-64 and >65 years group were 18.2, 33.6, 75.5, 97.5, and 99.8 kg, respectively. 
No body weight values in female subjects were available in the 2-5 years group. Median values for female 
subjects in the 6-11, 12-17, 18-64 and >65 years group were 34.0, 60.7, 69.6, and 68.3 kg, respectively.  
Table 13.  Number of Subjects with Missing Body Weight at Baseline in Each Study 
A sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding patients with body weight imputation. The typical CL and 
V of C1INH were 0.096 L/h and 3.16 L based on the dataset without body weight imputation, respectively. 
Overall, these results suggest that body weight imputation did not affect the population estimates since 
typical population estimates were <10% of those observed without body weight imputation.

Age groups 
Residual effects of age and body weight (after taking into account weight in the model) on the CL, V and 
baseline (BL) of C1INH are presented in the figure below. 
For the BL and V of C1INH, a potential effect of age was observed in younger paediatrics (2-5 and 6-11 
years) patients with HAE. The effect of age as a continuous parameter on V in younger patients was stronger 
than that observed for BL. The effects of age (categorical) on V were formally tested as part of the full model.

Gender and Race 
Residual effects of sex and race on the CL, V and baseline (BL) C1INH are presented in the Figure below. 
Results suggest a potential effect of sex on BL. Furthermore, race did not affect the V of C1INH, with the 
exception of Black (group 1) and Amer.Indian/Native (group 4). Results in Asian and other race should be 
interpreted with caution considering the very small sample size (i.e., 0.7% and 0.7% respectively). The 
effects of sex and race were formally tested as part of the full model.

Positive trends were observed between baseline C1INH levels and V of C1INH. The significance of the above 
covariates on V was formally tested in the full model.

PK and PD Marker  
Blood samples were collected for the assessment of antigenic and functional C1 INH (U/mL, PK) and 
Complement C4 levels (PD) in Study 0624-203 and Study 0624-301 (Table 11). Measurements were taken 
pre-infusion and 1 hour, and 24 hours after the start of the study drug infusion. The pharmacodynamics (PD) 
effects of Cinryze were evaluated in paediatric subjects with HAE, who lack a sufficient quantity or quality of 
C1 INH. This deficiency can lead to a reduction in the inhibition of activated complement component C1, in 
turn causing a decrease in complement C4 levels. Therefore, an increase in C4 levels may be a good 
measure of the PD effect of Cinryze. 
In Study 0624-203, prior to the Cinryze dosing baseline levels of C1 INH functional activity ranged from 
<0.050-0.250 U/mL and C1 INH antigen ranged from <0.029-0.062 g/L. Following IV administration of 500, 
1000, or 1500 U Cinryze, all subjects achieved increases in C1 INH plasma antigen and C1 INH functional 
activity above baseline values at 1 hour and 24 hours post-dose.  
Complement C4 levels fluctuated over the treatment periods, suggesting no appreciable effect of Cinryze 
treatment.

Study 0624-203 - Treatment 
Prior to the Cinryze dosing baseline levels of C1 INH functional activity ranged from <0.050-0.250 U/mL and 
C1 INH antigen ranged from <0.029-0.062 g/L. Following IV administration of 500, 1000, or 1500 U Cinryze, 
all subjects achieved increases in C1 INH plasma antigen and C1 INH functional activity above baseline 
values at 1 hour and 24 hours post-dose (Table 11). 
All subjects demonstrated an increase in C4 plasma concentrations above baseline at 24 hours post-infusion, 
indicating that administration of exogenous functional C1 INH was affecting the downstream complement 
cascade in all subjects. 
An association between increasing dose (in U/kg) of Cinryze and increasing functional C1 INH activity was 
observed (see Figure 10).

500 and 1000 U IV Cinryze – ITT-S Population (Study 0624-301) 
To illustrate the dose response in each subject following administration of 500 U and 1000 U IV Cinryze in 
Study 0624-301, a composite value was calculated by averaging the 1 h post-dose level at Dose 12 and Dose 
24 (baseline adjusted by the corresponding pre-dose levels). When the dose increased from 500 U to 1000 
U, the average values of Dose 12 and Dose 24 for functional C1 INH activity increased in the range of 41.5% 
to 157% (Figure 11). 
At steady state, mean increases in C1 INH functional activity (adjusted by pre-dose levels corresponding to 
the same dose) at 1 h post-dose ranged from 0.262±0.082 U/mL (Dose 12) to 0.298±0.087 U/mL (Dose 
24), and from 0.552±0.111 U/mL (Dose 12) to 0.545±0.129 U/mL (Dose 24), for the 500 U and 1000 U 
doses, respectively. 
For C1 INH antigen, when the Cinryze dose increased from 500 U to 1000 U, the average values of Dose 12 
and Dose 24 increased in the range of 68.5% to 119%. At steady state, mean increases in C1 INH antigen 
concentration (adjusted by pre-dose levels corresponding to the same dose) at 1 h post-injection ranged 
from 0.072±0.014 g/L (Dose 12) to 0.086±0.017 g/L (Dose 24), and from 0.161±0.033 g/L (Dose 12) to 
0.151±0.023 g/L (Dose 24) for the 500 U and 1000 U doses, respectively.  
Complement C4 levels fluctuated over the treatment periods, suggesting no appreciable effect of Cinryze 
treatment. However, no definitive conclusions could be drawn given that C4 levels historically show an 
increase >24 h after Cinryze administration and there was no comparative assessment of C4 levels during 
the baseline observation period. 
Studies LEVP 2005-1/A, LEVP 2006-1, LEVP 2005-1/B and LEVP 2006-4 
The incremental mean increase from baseline in functional C1 INH activity measured 1 hour post-dose in 
children 2 to <18 years of age ranged from 20% to 88% in Study LEVP 2006-1 (treatment) and from 22% 
to 46% in Study LEVP 2006-4 (prevention), compared with 21% to 66% and 25% to 32% in adults, 
respectively. The following figure illustrates the range of median change from baseline (pre- to 
post-infusion) in functional C1 INH in the three paediatric subgroups (ie, 2 to 5 years, 6 to 11 years, and 12 
to 17 years, respectively) compared with adults (≥18 years) in Study LEVP 2006-1 (top) and Study LEVP

2006-4 (bottom). Comparison across subgroups should be interpreted with caution given the small number 
of paediatric subjects investigated and the heterogeneity within each subgroup. 
Figure 12.  Median change in functional C1 INH activity from pre to post infusion by age in studies LEVP 
2006-1 (top) and LEVP 2006-4 (bottom) 
Mean changes in levels of C1 INH antigen at 1 hour post-infusion in subjects <18 years of age ranged from 
6.0 to 20.0 mg/dL in Study LEVP 2006-1 (treatment) and from 6.7 to 15.0 mg/dL in Study LEVP 2006-4 
(prevention). The corresponding ranges in adult subjects were -11.0 to 16.0 mg/dL in Study LEVP 2006-1 
(treatment) and 5.6 to 8.4 mg/dL in Study LEVP 2006-4 (prevention). 
In addition, the increases in antigenic and functional C1 INH activity from pre- to post-infusion were 
generally similar for varying numbers of acute attacks in Study LEVP 2006-1, and were independent of 
duration of study participation in Study LEVP 2006-4, indicating consistent pharmacokinetics over repeated 
Cinryze administrations. 
Complement C4 levels at 1 hour post-infusion were similar to values observed at pre-infusion in Studies 
LEVP 2006-1 and 2006-4, and did not appear to differ between age groups. This was not unexpected as 
previous studies (LEVP 2005-1/A and LEVP 2006-5) showed that C4 levels in HAE subjects do not increase 
appreciably until at least 12 hours and likely peak at around 48 hours post-infusion of exogenous C1 INH; 
therefore, 60 minute post-infusion C4 levels did not differ from baseline.

Exposure-Response Analyses 
Objectives and Methodology 
Exploratory exposure-response analyses for the prevention of HAE and treatment of HAE was to be 
performed based on studies listed in Table 8 with the exception of studies 2005-1/A and 2005-1/B due to the 
unblinded nature of the protocol. 
For the prevention of HAE attacks, exposure-response analyses were performed for the following endpoint: 
1) The probability of response (≤1 HAE attack/month). This response criterion was derived by averaging the 
number of HAE attacks over the study duration. If a subject rolled-over from one study to the next (for the 
prevention of HAE), the total duration was taken into account.  
2) The time to the first HAE attack. If a subject rolled-over from one study to the next, time to the first HAE 
attack was available for each study. For these cases time to first averaged across studies for 
exposure-response analyses. 
The above exploratory analyses were performed by plotting the probability of response as a function of 
exposure metrics of C1INH. The following exposure metrics under steady state were evaluated for the 
prevention program: area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to 4 h under steady state 
conditions (AUC0-4,ss), minimum concentration under steady state conditions (Cmin,ss (predose)), 
maximum concentration under steady state conditions (Cmax,ss), and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2). 
The most predictive parameter was used for the final analysis. 
Based on the above exploratory analysis, a logistic regression model was used to link the appropriate 
exposure metric to the probability of response. The following criteria were used to define responder status 
for the prevention of HAE program: 
•  Responders (subject deemed a “success”): ≤1.0 HAE attack/month 
•  Non-responders (subject deemed a “failure”): >1.0 HAE attack/month 
The relationship between the exposure to C1INH and the probability of response (binary response: 0= 
non-responder and 1= responder) was modeled using a logistic regression model with the following form: 
where F is called the logit and is a measure of the total contribution of all independent variables (exposure 
to C1INH) used in the model. The general functional form of the logit (F) used is: 
In addition, Kaplan-Meier plots were derived for the time to the first HAE attack by quartiles of PK for the 
prevention of HAE attacks. 
Assessment report  
EMA/873329/2016 
Page 31/65 
 
  
  
 
 
 
For treatment of acute HAE attacks, exposure-response analyses were performed for the probability of relief 
of the defining symptom within 4 hours following initial treatment with Cinryze. The probability of response 
as a function of exposure metrics of C1INH was evaluated. The following exposure metrics after single dose 
were evaluated for the treatment of HAE attack program: area under the concentration-time curve from 
time 0 to 4 h (AUC0-4), maximum concentration (Cmax), time to maximum concentration (tmax) and t1/2 
and the most predictive parameter was used for the final analysis. 
• 
The following criteria were used to define responder status for the treatment of HAE program: 
Responders (subject deemed a “success”): relief of the defining symptom within 4 hours of Cinryze 
dosing 
•  Non-responders (subject deemed a “failure”): No relief of the defining symptom within 4 hours of 
Cinryze dosing 
The relationship between the exposure to C1INH and the probability of response (binary response: 0= 
non-responder and 1= responder) was modeled using a similar logistic regression model. In addition, 
Kaplan-Meier plots were derived for the time relief of the defining symptom by quartiles of PK for the 
prevention of HAE attacks. 
Exposure Predictions for Treatment of HAE Attacks 
Using the final population PK model, actual dosing records and plasma concentrations of C1 INH (total 
functional activity, [ie, endogenous levels plus dosing effects of Cinryze]) for individual subjects, predicted 
single dose exposure to C1 INH for each subject following IV dosing with Cinryze as a function of age and 
dose for the prevention of HAE attacks (exposure-response population) was assessed and the results are 
presented in Table 14. For acute treatment of HAE attacks, some subjects (n=58) received a second dose of 
Cinryze at 1 hour after the first dose and exposure to these doses are summarized additionally.

In addition, using all data from both prevention (first dose) and acute treatment trials, the exposure to C1 
INH following a single IV dose of Cinryze as a function of age, dose and body weight for the treatment of HAE 
(PK population) were simulated and are presented in Table 15.

Table 15.  Predicted Exposure to C1INH Following Single Dose of Cinryze as a Function of Age Weight and 
Dose (Combined Indication). 
It is noted that PK data were available for 3 subjects with HAE between 2-5 years, but only 1 of 3 subjects 
was treated for an acute attack, and a second dose of Cinryze for this subject was administered at 1 hour 
after the first dose. The dose-exposure to C1 INH from these 3 subjects was included for the exposure 
assessment to enrich the PK dataset in this age group. 
Exposure measurements (Table 14) were merged with the probability of response (relief of the defining 
symptom within 4 h of Cinryze dosing) as a function of Cinryze dose in studies 2006-1 (n=98 unique subjects 
ID with available response data) and 0624-203 (n=9 unique subjects ID with available response data) was 
explored in a first step. Response data from study 2005-1/A was removed from the exposure-response 
analysis due to the unblinded nature of the study, and the use of placebo. For patients with multiple attacks 
over time in study 2006-1, median time to relief was derived in each patient to determine the responder 
status. The probability of response by total dose is presented in Table 16.

Relief of the defining symptom within 4 h of Cinryze dosing was observed in 100% (3/3) of patients treated 
with a single 500 U dose with a median time to relief of 2.17 h. The only subject who did not show 
improvement within 1 h following an initial 500 U dose (n=1), responded to treatment after receiving an 
additional 500 U dose 1 h after the initial dose, with a time to relief of 3.58 h. 
Relief of the defining symptom within 4 h of Cinryze dosing was observed in 95.2% (79/83) of patients 
treated with a 1000 U dose. For subject who did not show improvement within 1 h following an initial 1000 
U dose (n=57), an additional 1000 U dose of Cinryze resulted in a relief of the defining symptom within 4 h 
of Cinryze dosing in 84.2% of patients (48/57). 
Relief of the defining symptom within 4 h of Cinryze dosing was observed in 66.7% (2/3) of patients treated 
with a single 1500 U dose. 
Exploratory-exposure responses analyses were performed on the responder status (relief of the defining 
symptom within 4 h of Cinryze dosing) and time to relief. Due to the very low rate of failure, no 
exposure-response relationships were observed. 
Exposure Predictions (Prevention) 
Using the final population PK model, actual dosing records and plasma concentrations of C1 INH (total 
functional activity [ie, endogenous levels plus dosing effects of Cinryze]) of individual subjects, predicted 
steady-state exposure to C1 INH for each subject following IV dosing of Cinryze twice weekly as a function 
of age and dose for the prevention of HAE attacks (exposure-response population) was assessed and the 
results are presented in the following Table.

Table 17.  Steady State Exposure to C1INH following Dosing of Cinryze as a function of Age Groups and 
Dose – Prevention of HAE (Exposure-Response Population) 
Individual subject exposures to C1INH derived with the population PK model (AUC0-4,ss, Cmax,ss, and 
Cmin,ss (predose) and t1/2) were merged with the probability of response (≤1 HAE attack/month) in studies 
2006-4 (n=141), 0624-400 (n=19) and 0624-301 (n=6) for an exploratory exposure-response analysis. 
Response data from study 2005-1/B was removed from the exposure-response analysis due to the 
unblinded nature of the study and the use of placebo. Logistic regressions on the probability of response (≤1 
HAE attack/month) versus AUC0-4,ss, Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss (predose) and t1/2 were performed. No 
statistically significant relationships were observed for AUC0-4,ss, Cmax,ss and t1/2. On the other hand, a 
very strong and positive relationship was observed between Cmin,ss (p=0.0004) and the probability of 
response. When refractory subjects enrolled in study 0624-400 were removed from the analysis, the 
response across all Cmin,ss (predose) levels were very high. 
The probability of No HAE attack over time was explored according to various PK parameters of C1INH (by 
tertiles). No exposure-response relationship was observed, with the exception of Cmin,ss (predose). The 
probability of No HAE attacks over time as a function of Cmin,ss (predose) tertiles is presented in Figure 13.

Figure 13.  Probability of No HAE Attacks Over Time as a function of Cmin,ss (predose) Tertiles – Prevention 
of HAE Program (Studies 2006-4, 0624-400 and 0624-301) 
Predose (Cmin,ss) values of C1INH in the 1st tertile (0.097 - 0.290 U/mL) were associated to the lowest 
probability of no HAE attack. Predose (Cmin,ss) values in the 3rd tertiles (0.429 – 0.955 U/mL) were 
associated to the highest probability of no HAE attack over time. Median time to a 50% probability of an HAE 
attack for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd tertiles of Cmin,ss (predose) were 2.43, 9.79, and 15.7 weeks, respectively. 
After removing study 0624-400, exposure-response relationships were observed for all exposure 
parameters. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The mechanism of action of C1 INH for relief of HAE attacks is not clear, yet, and based upon clinical effect 
in respective narrow patient-collective. Relevance of plasma-levels, trough- or peak-levels remains 
hypothetical. 
Study 624-203 
Blood samples for PK evaluation were taken prior to Cinryze injection, 1 hour and 24 hours post injection. No 
subject agreed to the additional but optional blood sampling necessary to obtain a PK profile for antigenic 
and functional C1 INH levels. As a result, no PK parameters were calculated for this study. 
All 3 doses, 500, 1000 and 1500 IU, induced an increase of C1 INH activity and antigen after single-dose 
administration. One (1) of 3 subjects on 500 U and 5 of 6 subjects on 1500 and 1000 U achieved functional 
Assessment report  
EMA/873329/2016 
Page 37/65 
 
  
  
 
 
C1 INH activities ≥0.7 U/ml at 1h p.i. which is assumed to represent an effective level. However, this target 
should be taken with caution as no dose-finding studies are available and the disease presents with 
inhomogeneous symptoms and responses. 
Furthermore, an increase of Complement C4 has been achieved in all patients with a delay of more than 1 
hour p.i. Such C4-increase might be interpreted as a PD effect of Cinryze.  
Study 624-301 
Samples were taken pre-infusion and 1 hour post- infusion for Dose 1 (week 1), 12 (week 6), and 24 (week 
12) of each treatment period. 
Both doses, 500 and 1000 IU, induced an increase of C1 INH activity and antigen. Data illustrate C1 INH 
elevation within a treatment regimen under study conditions but similar to a “prophylaxis regimen” under 
steady state conditions. Mean C1 INH activities 1h p.i. were 0.262-0.298 U/ml for 500 U and 0.5552-0.545 
U/ml for 1000 U. Such numbers point to a dose-dependency, however; with large individual variability. 
Measurement of Complement C4 was chosen as a pharmacodynamics parameter. However, an effect was 
not demonstrated. This might be due to the short interval (24 hours p.i.), the test in place, or the restricted 
database, in general. 
Results from 6 further subjects are awaited from this on-going study (see Section 2.6). 
PK/PD modelling 
Generally, paediatrics subjects are poorly reflected in the current analysis data set, especially children from 
age group 2-5 years of age as no subjects additional to the three already recruited patients were included 
since the initial MAA. For age group 6-11 years of age, 15 additional subjects were recruited; however, only 
sparse sampling data was collected. Full PK profiles are still only available for adult subjects. Nine (9) 
additional subjects have been recruited in study 0624-203 (treatment, receiving 500U, 1000U or 1500U IV) 
and 6 subjects in study 0624-301 (prevention, receiving 500U and/or 1000U BIW IV). 
A population PK model was established to characterize the pharmacokinetics of Cinryze in paediatric age 
group, based on data collected in previous and new studies.  
In total, 227 subjects were included in the analysis population; a total of 3, 32, and 26 subjects in the 2-5, 
6-11, and 12-17 years of age cohorts, respectively. From these subjects, 3617 measurable concentrations 
of C1INH were included in the analysis. The final pop PK parameter suggest a typical 70 kg weighing subject 
to have CL, V and baseline C1INH values of 0.105 L/h, 3.13 L, and 0.346 U/mL, respectively.  Model-based 
simulations for PK and exposure responses were conducted for indication treatment of HAE attacks and 
prevention separately. 
PK exposure predictions are derived from the final pop PK model (one-compartment model with baseline 
C1INH levels) that seems to be miss-specified: Goodness-of-fit plots indicate that the inter-individual 
variability is only moderately captured and high percentage of shrinkage, that was detected for all estimates 
(> 20%, up to ~60%), suggest an over-parameterization. Body weight is structurally included (with fixed 
allometric exponents) and as covariate on volume. Measurement of bodyweight was missing for patients in 
the youngest age group (2-5 years) and partially lacking for all other age groups. Imputation of body weight 
seemed not to have a great impact on PK.  
Comparison across subgroups should be interpreted with caution given the small number of paediatric 
subjects investigated and the heterogeneity within each subgroup. 
Exploratory-exposure responses analyses were performed on the responder status (relief of the defining 
symptom within 4 h of Cinryze dosing) and time to relief. Due to the generally very low rate of failure, no 
Assessment report  
EMA/873329/2016 
Page 38/65 
 
  
  
clear exposure-response relationships could be observed. A slight inverse relationship for 
exposure-response (decrease in percentage responders with increase in dose) could be detected. However, 
there are too few subjects investigated to draw quantitative conclusions.  
Regarding prevention, the probability of No HAE attack over time was explored according to various PK 
parameters of C1INH (by tertiles). No exposure-response relationship was observed, with the exception of 
Cmin,ss (predose). After removing study 0624-400 (Phase 4 Study), exposure-response relationships were 
observed for all exposure parameters.  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Laboratory evaluation from both additionally submitted studies 624-203 and 624-301 demonstrate increase 
of C1 INH activity and C1 INH antigen with a dose-dependent effect. For study 624-203 a delayed increase 
of Complement C4 as a parameter for biologic activity has been demonstrated, in addition. 
A population PK model was established and model-based simulations for PK and exposure responses were 
conducted for each indication treatment of HAE attacks and prevention, respectively. 
Generally, paediatric subjects are poorly reflected in the analysis data set, especially children from age 
group 2-5 years. No new patients below the age of 6 years have been included since the data presented in 
the initial MAA. For age group 6-11 years, 15 additional subjects were sampled; however, only sparse 
sampling data was collected. Full PK profiles are only available for adult subjects. However, the CHMP 
acknowledges that the number of patients is extremely limited in the paediatric age-group due to the rarity 
of the condition, especially the 2-5 years, and, consequently, it will be difficult for the MAH to enrol further 
patients. 
The conclusions on the dosing recommendations are discussed in Section 2.4. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study(ies) 
Study 624-203: Treatment 
Open-label single-dose study to evaluate the response and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of 
different doses of CINRYZE [C1 inhibitor (human)] for treatment of acute angioedema attacks in children 
less than 12 years of age with hereditary angioedema (Protocol 0624-203) 
Methods 
This multicenter, open-label study was conducted at 6 sites in the US. Eligible subjects (2 to <12 years of 
age) who could initiate study drug treatment within 8 hours after onset of symptoms received treatment for 
a single acute HAE attack. Subjects may have been inpatient or outpatient. Qualified subjects received a 
single IV administration of CINRYZE; dosing was determined by subject weight category, as shown below. 
Individual doses could not exceed 100 U/kg.

Within each of the two weight categories, the first 3 subjects treated were to receive the lower dose in that 
category, and the second 3 subjects treated were to receive the higher dose in that category. The study was 
open to enrolment within each of the two weight categories in parallel. 
Beyond the single dose of CINRYZE administered in this study, additional treatment(s) for the HAE attack 
were permitted at the discretion of the investigator based on each subject’s clinical response. However, for 
purposes of PK and efficacy assessments, use of additional medication specifically for treatment of HAE was 
ideally to be avoided through the 4-hour post-infusion assessment period. 
The investigator determined the defining symptom (i.e., anatomical location) and overall severity of the HAE 
attack at baseline and rated the subject’s overall response to treatment every 15 minutes after the start of 
the study drug infusion for a minimum of 1 hour. Assessments of response to treatment continued every 15 
minutes until either the subject achieved relief sufficient to allow discharge from the study centre, or until 4 
hours had elapsed post-infusion, whichever occurred earlier. 
Pharmacokinetic/PD evaluations included assessment of antigenic and functional C1 esterase inhibitor (C1 
INH) levels (PK) and C4 complement levels (PD). Safety was monitored through the recording of AEs and 
changes in physical examinations, vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate), and 
clinical laboratory testing. Investigators actively monitored subjects for possible venous thromboembolism 
(VTE), both deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), via medical history, physical 
examinations (including upper and lower extremity examinations), and laboratory testing. 
Study participants 
Eligible subjects (2 to <12 years of age) who could initiate treatment within 8 hours after onset of symptoms 
received Cinryze for treatment of a single acute attack. The IV doses of Cinryze evaluated were 500 U and 
1000 U in children ≥10 kg to ≤25 kg and 1000 U and 1500 U in children >25 kg. 
Treatments 
CINRYZE was supplied as a lyophilized powder of 500 U (C1 INH)/vial for reconstitution with sterile water for 
injection. For all dose groups, subjects were to receive a single dose of CINRYZE, administered intravenously 
at a constant rate of approximately 1 mL (100 U)/minute, as tolerated. 
Objectives 
The objectives of the study were to evaluate (1) the dose response and (2) the pharmacokinetics 
(PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) of intravenous (IV) administration of CINRYZE for the treatment of acute 
angioedema attacks in children above and below 25 kg and less than 12 years of age with hereditary 
angioedema (HAE); and (3) to determine the safety and tolerability following IV administration of CINRYZE 
in this study population. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS: The investigator determined the defining symptom (i.e., anatomical location) and 
overall severity of the HAE attack at baseline, and rated the subject’s overall response to treatment every 15 
minutes after the start of the study drug infusion for a minimum of 1 hour. Assessments of response to 
treatment continued every 15 minutes until either the subject achieved relief sufficient to allow discharge 
from the study centre, or until 4 hours elapsed post-infusion, whichever occurred earlier. At each 15-minute 
interval, the investigator made an overall assessment of the symptoms/signs of the HAE attack relative to 
the previous assessment as: improved; unchanged; or worsened. The date and time of complete resolution 
of the HAE attack was recorded. 
Assessment report  
EMA/873329/2016 
Page 40/65 
 
  
  
 
SAFETY ASSESSMENTS: Safety was monitored through the recording of AEs and changes in physical 
examinations, vital signs, and clinical safety laboratory testing. Investigators actively monitored subjects for 
possible VTE, both DVT and PE, via medical history, physical examinations (including upper and lower 
extremity examinations), and laboratory testing. 
Statistical methods 
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics: Antigenic and functional C1 INH levels (PK) and C4 complement 
levels (PD) for individual subjects were evaluated using validated analytical methods. Results were 
summarized for each subject for change from pre- to post-infusion. 
Efficacy: The primary efficacy endpoint was the presence of unequivocal beginning of relief of the defining 
symptom within 4 hours following initial treatment with CINRYZE. Secondary efficacy endpoints included 
time to unequivocal beginning of relief of the defining symptom and time to complete resolution of the HAE 
attack. 
Summary statistics were provided for all efficacy endpoints by treatment dose groups and weight categories. 
No statistical test was performed for between treatment differences. Graphical presentations were provided, 
as appropriate. For all efficacy endpoints, the corresponding analyses were performed using the efficacy 
analysis population (ITT-E population). 
Safety: Descriptive statistics (e.g., N, mean, SE, SD, median, range) were reported for baseline, 
post-baseline, and change from baseline values in clinical laboratory and vital signs parameters. Two 
summaries of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were provided: all TEAEs and all TEAEs related to 
study drug. Adverse events were coded using MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) Version 
16.0. 
Results 
Conduct of the study 
Study 0624-203 was initiated in 2010 and conducted at 6 sites in the US. Last patient contact was in 2012.  
Despite substantial recruitment efforts, subjects were not enrolled 1000 U dose group in the lower weight 
category. Therefore 9 subjects were enrolled and treated: 3 subjects (10-25 kg inclusive) received 500 U, 3 
subjects (>25 kg) received 1000 U, and 3 subjects (>25 kg) received  1500 U IV Cinryze. All 9 subjects 
received a single dose of Cinryze and completed the study. 
Nine paediatric subjects with HAE were enrolled and treated with a single IV dose of Cinryze in this study: 3 
subjects (10-25 kg, inclusive) received 500 U Cinryze, 3 subjects (>25 kg) received 1000 U Cinryze, and 3 
subjects (>25 kg) received 1500 U Cinryze. Subjects in the lower weight category were not enrolled in the 
1000 U dose group. All 9 subjects completed treatment and the study. 
Baseline data 
All 9 subjects were white, and 8 of the 9 subjects were female. The median age was 9 years (range: 6-11 
years). 
All 9 subjects had a family history of HAE. During the year prior to study enrolment, these subjects reported 
a median of 0.3 attacks per month (range: 0-4 attacks); the majority of subjects (67%, 6/9) had <1 attack 
per month (2 subjects in each dose group). Overall, the most common historical attack locations were 
gastrointestinal/abdominal (78%, 7/9) and extremity (67%, 6/9); 2 of the 9 (22%) subjects (both 1500 U) 
reported laryngeal attacks within the prior year (did not require intubation). The mean number of 
hospital/emergency room visits necessary for angioedema attacks during the year prior to enrolment was 
Assessment report  
EMA/873329/2016 
Page 41/65 
 
  
  
low across the 3 dose groups, ranging from a mean of 0.3-1.0. The majority of subjects (78%, 7/9) never 
had a laryngeal attack at any time prior to the study. 
At baseline, the investigator determined the defining symptom (i.e., predominant anatomic location) and 
overall severity of the subject’s HAE attack. For the majority (56%, 5/9) of subjects in the intent-to-treat 
efficacy (ITT-E) population, the defining symptom was gastrointestinal (GI)/abdominal: 2 (67%), 2 (67%), 
and 1 (33%) subjects in the 500 U, 1000 U, and 1500 U Cinryze groups, respectively. One (33%) subject in 
each of the 3 dose groups reported extremity symptoms; facial symptoms were reported by the remaining 
subject (1500 U Cinryze).  
Outcomes and estimation 
All 9 (100%) subjects met the primary endpoint of the study, achieving unequivocal beginning of relief of the 
defining symptom within 4 hours of initiation of treatment with Cinryze. As shown in the Table below, median 
time to unequivocal beginning of relief of the defining symptom was 0.5 hours (range: 0.25-2.5 hours): 
1.25, 0.25, and 0.5 hours in the 500 U, 1000 U, and 1500 U Cinryze groups, respectively. The majority 
(67%) of the 9 subjects achieved unequivocal beginning of relief of the defining symptom within 0.5 hours 
(0.25 hours, n=4; 0.5 hours, n=2), including 1 (1000 U Cinryze) of 2 subjects whose defining symptom 
(GI/abdominal) was severe. The median time to complete resolution (from start of Cinryze infusion) of the 
HAE attack for the 9 subjects was 13.6 hours (range: 1.6-102.3 hours): 13.6, 10.0, and 29.1 hours in the 
500 U, 1000 U, and 1500 U Cinryze groups, respectively (secondary efficacy endpoints). 
Of note, for 1 subject (defining symptom: severe extremity attack) in the 1500 U dose group, the time to 
complete resolution of the HAE attack (102.3 hours) was significantly longer than that of other study 
subjects; this subject had an average of 2 HAE attacks per month during the year prior to enrolment as well 
as having a history of laryngeal attacks. It is not unusual for swelling associated within an extremity attack 
to require 4-5 days for complete resolution, especially for severe swelling.

Study 624-301: Prevention 
“A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Single-blind, Dose-ranging, Crossover Study to Evaluate the Safety 
and Efficacy of Intravenous Administration of CINRYZE (C1 Esterase Inhibitor [Human]) for the Prevention 
of Angioedema Attacks in Children 6 to 11 Years of Age With Hereditary Angioedema.” 
Methods 
Subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (A/B or B/A; A=500 U and B=1000 U), with each 
sequence consisting of two 12-week treatment periods of twice weekly infusions (2x24 doses, overall). 
Subjects had to qualify for randomization by experiencing at least 1.0 angioedema attack (moderate or 
severe or required acute treatment) per month during the study’s 12-week baseline observation period. 
Treatments 
Subjects received Cinryze (500 U or 1000 U) IV injection twice weekly (every 3 or 4 days) for 12 weeks in 
two sequential crossover treatment periods. Subjects were to receive both treatments (A=500 U and 
B=1000 U), assigned in random order (A/B or B/A). No placebo or reference product was used in this study. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the relative efficacy of two dose levels of CINRYZE (500 U and 
1000 U) administered by IV injection every 3 or 4 days to prevent angioedema attacks in children 6-11 years 
of age. The secondary and other objectives of the study are to: (1) assess the safety and tolerability of the 
2 dose levels; (2) characterize the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics; (3) assess the immunogenicity; 
and (4) assess the impact of treatment on health status (quality of life) following intravenous (IV) 
administration of CINRYZE in children 6-11 years of age with hereditary angioedema (HAE). 
Assessment report  
EMA/873329/2016 
Page 43/65 
 
  
  
 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint was the number of angioedema attacks, normalized to a 12-week treatment 
period. No statistical comparisons of the Cinryze doses were made due to the small number of subjects. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were Cumulative Attack Severity, Cumulative Daily Severity, and the number 
of angioedema attacks requiring acute treatment during each treatment period. 
Study participants 
All 6 subjects had a confirmed diagnosis of Type I HAE (low levels of C1 INH protein). Five (83%) of the 6 
subjects had a family history (first-degree relative) of HAE. 
During the 3 months prior to screening, the median number of angioedema attacks for subjects was 4.0 
(range: 3-6 attacks). Overall, subjects reported typical angioedema attack locations as gastrointestinal 
(GI)/abdominal (100%), extremity or peripheral (83%), facial (50%). One subject reported a history of 
genitourinary attacks and 1 subject had a history of upper airway attacks. The mean for the average overall 
duration of the angioedema attacks was approximately 2 days for all subjects (range: 1-3 days) and the 
average overall severity of the attacks was moderate for the majority of subjects (83%, 5/6); 1 (17%) 
subject reported attacks of severe intensity.

Sample size 
As planned, a total of 12 subjects will be randomized in this study. Currently 6 subjects have completed the 
study and this interim CSR summarizes the results of the first 6 completers to fulfil the EU PIP commitment 
for CINRYZE. Two of the 6 subjects were randomized to treatment sequence A/B (500/1000 U IV CINRYZE) 
and 4 subjects were randomized to sequence B/A (1000/500 U IV CINRYZE). All 6 subjects were included in 
the Safety Set, Full Analysis Set, and the Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Set for data analyses 
purposes. 
Assessment report

Statistical methods 
A sample size of 12 randomized subjects was considered to be a reasonable target for meeting the study 
objectives, given the limited pool of eligible paediatric HAE subjects who fall within the age range.  
No formal statistical analyses of the data have been performed; rather statistical comparisons of the 
CINRYZE doses will be made when all subjects have completed the study. 
All pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses were performed using the respective Pharmacokinetic 
or Pharmacodynamic Set. Individual subject concentrations of C1 INH antigen, C1 INH functional activity, 
and complement C4 were summarized by treatment using descriptive statistics for each collection time 
point. 
In addition, the change from baseline (prior to the first dose in treatment period 1) to pre-dose levels and the 
change from each corresponding pre-dose level to 1 h post-dose for Dose 12 and Dose 24 in each treatment 
period were summarized for C1 INH antigen and C1 INH functional activity. Individual and summary (ie, 
mean, and SD) figures of plasma concentration-time profiles concentrations were provided. 
All efficacy analyses were based on the Full Analysis Set. Summary statistics were provided for the primary 
endpoint (normalized number of angioedema attacks) and secondary endpoints (cumulative 
attack-severity, cumulative daily-severity, and number of angioedema attacks requiring acute treatment). 
For analyses related to the number of angioedema attacks during treatment (primary endpoint) as well as 
secondary efficacy endpoints, the number of attacks was normalized for the number of days subjects 
participated in a given period and expressed as a monthly frequency. All subjects’ available individual data 
for the number of angioedema attacks during each treatment period were listed using the Safety Set. 
Graphic presentation was applied to view the pattern of angioedema attacks in this crossover study design 
using the Full Analysis Set. 
All safety analyses were based on the Safety Set. The number and percentage of subjects reporting 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were tabulated in the following ways: 
•  By system organ class (SOC), preferred term, and treatment (including absolute count of events) 
•  By SOC, preferred term, and maximum severity 
•  By SOC and preferred term for any serious TEAEs 
•  By SOC and preferred term for TEAEs that in the opinion of the investigator were related to the 
investigational product. 
Treatment-emergent AEs were summarized by dose group and by the time of onset (eg, during 
administration of investigational product or within 24 hours of a completed injection). Adverse events were 
coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA Version 17.0). 
Clinical laboratory test and vital sign measurements were summarized using descriptive statistics. The 
number and percentage of subjects with potentially clinically important values, as determined by 
pre-defined criteria, were tabulated. The results of all immunogenicity testing (ie, antibodies to C1 INH) 
were listed. 
Results 
Conduct of the study 
Study 0624-301 was initiated in 2014 and is currently ongoing, with study sites in the US, EU, and other 
regions. The results for the first 6 subject completing the study are available for this submission.

Baseline data 
The design of this study allowed an evaluation of a subject’s baseline HAE profile. During the study’s baseline 
observation period (12 weeks), subjects were allowed to remain on prophylactic HAE therapy and/or receive 
on-demand HAE therapy for acute attacks. Subjects had to qualify for randomization during this period 
based on the number of attacks experienced (≥1.0 angioedema attacks per month [average] that were 
moderate or severe or required acute treatment). For the 6 subjects who qualified, a total of 41 attacks were 
recorded. The number of attacks for each subject was normalized and resulted in a mean baseline of 2.26 
(±1.62) attacks per month. Other data associated with the attacks (severity, duration, acute treatments) 
were also recorded and the results from the baseline observation period were used to assess the efficacy of 
the 500 U and 1000 U Cinryze doses (ie, by comparing a subject’s response with Cinryze prophylaxis relative 
to their baseline). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Both Cinryze doses showed clinical benefit relative to the baseline observation period (OP) as assessed by 
the primary and all secondary efficacy endpoints. During 12 weeks of treatment with each dose, both 500 U 
and 1000 U of Cinryze (administered twice weekly) reduced the burden of disease by lowering the number 
of angioedema attacks, lessening the severity and duration of attacks, and the requirement for acute 
treatment compared with baseline.  
Table 21.  Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints (Scale Score Normalized per month) 
(Full Analysis Set) 
Fourty-one (41) angioedema attacks were reported during the baseline observation period. With Cinryze 
twice weekly treatment, 6 attacks were reported with the 500 U dose and 6 attacks were reported with 1000 
U dose. Note, two subjects had no angioedema attacks with either the 500 U or 1000 U dose of Cinryze. One 
subject had no attack with 500 U of Cinryze and one subject had no attack during dosing with 1000 U of 
Cinryze. Therefore, 4 of the 6 subjects were attack-free during at least 1 of the two 3-month Cinryze 
treatment periods.

Supportive studies 
In the original marketing authorization application (MAA) 4 studies included information on the efficacy of 
Cinryze in paediatric subjects: 
Study LEVP 2005-1/A 
This study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating Cinryze for the treatment of acute 
angioedema attacks in subjects ≥6 years of age with HAE. Fifteen paediatric subjects (6-17 years) 
participated in the study, with 12 subjects having exposure to Cinryze. Subjects were randomized to receive 
a single dose of study drug (placebo or 1000 U IV Cinryze); those who did not respond to the randomized 
treatment could receive a second infusion of the study drug (placebo or 1000 U IV Cinryze) at 60 minutes

EMA/873329/2016

following the initial treatment. In addition, subjects could be treated with open- label 1000 U IV Cinryze if 
they presented with laryngeal angioedema or if they required emergency or non-cosmetic surgical 
procedures. 
Study LEVP 2006-1  
This study was an open-label study evaluating repeat exposure Cinryze in the treatment of acute 
angioedema attacks in subjects ≥1 year of age with HAE. Twenty-four (24) paediatric subjects (2-17 years) 
participated in the study. Treatment for acute attacks was 1000 U of IV Cinryze with a second 1000 U dose 
60 minutes later if needed. In addition, short-term pre-procedure prophylaxis with 1000 U IV Cinryze was 
permitted during the study. 
Study LEVP 2005-1/B  
This study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating Cinryze for the prevention of 
angioedema attacks in subjects ≥6 years of age with HAE. Four (4) paediatric subjects (9-17 years) 
participated in the study. Subjects were randomized to treatment (placebo or 1000 U IV Cinryze) which was 
administered twice weekly during two 12-week crossover treatment periods (ie, duration of treatment was 
24 weeks). 
Study LEVP 2006-4  
This study was an open-label study evaluating Cinryze for the prophylactic treatment to prevent angioedema 
attacks and as treatment for acute angioedema attacks in subjects ≥1 year of age with HAE. Twenty-three 
(23) paediatric subjects (3-17 years) participated in the study. Subjects received 1000 U of Cinryze every 
3-7 days for the prevention of HAE attacks or as needed for the treatment of acute HAE attacks, for as long 
as the study was in effect. For treatment of acute attack, subjects received 1000 U of IV Cinryze which could 
be repeated after 60 minutes if there was no symptom relief. 
Table 23.  Number of Paediatric Subjects Exposed to Cinryze and Total Infusions by Age Group, Indication, 
and Study – ITT-S Population 
Since the data for efficacy and safety for children below 6 years of age are very scarce and have not been 
expanded compared to the time of marketing authorisation, the MAH provided at the CHMP’s request new 
information on 6 patients 3 to 5 years of age from post-marketing data that were treated off-label with 
Cinryze for prevention or acute treatment of angioedema attacks. 
Assessment report  
EMA/873329/2016 
Page 49/65 
 
  
  
 
Six (6) patients 3 to 5 years were identified from the post-marketing safety database for the reporting period 
01 Jan 1990 through 25 Sep 2016. They received routine prophylactic treatments with IV Cinryze and the 
dose regimens varied from 500 U (1-2 times per week) to 1000 U (1-2 times per week). The safety profiles 
from these post-marketing experiences were consistent with that observed in the clinical development 
program. In most cases these patients were identified when brought to the ER or hospitalized due to 
breakthrough angioedema attacks, which were treated with either Cinryze or Berinert, depending on the 
availability. Five out of these 6 patients continue the use of prophylactic Cinryze treatments currently and 
the status for 1 patient is unknown. 
Table 24.  Treatment of 6 Children from 3-5 years 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The hereditary angioedema (HAE) Development Program for intravenous (IV) Cinryze supporting marketing 
approval included 8 clinical studies for treatment of angioedema attacks and routine prevention 
(prophylaxis) of angioedema attacks in adults (≥18 years of age), adolescents (12-17 years of age), and 
children (2-11 years of age). Two new studies, 0624-301 and 0624-203 out of these eight studies, provided 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data of C1 INH in HAE paediatric populations for the treatment 
and prevention indications. 
Study 624-203 
Nine subjects (age range: 6 - 11) were enrolled and received a single dose of Cinryze: 3 subjects (10 - 25 
kg) received 500 Units; 3 subjects (>25 kg) 1000 Units, and 3 subjects (>25 kg) 1500 Units. All 9 (100%) 
subjects achieved unequivocal beginning of relief of the defining symptom within 4 hours following initiation 
of treatment with Cinryze. Median interval was 0.5 hours (range: 0.25-2.5 hours): 1.25, 0.25, and 0.5 hours 
Assessment report  
EMA/873329/2016 
Page 50/65 
 
  
  
 
in the 500 Units, 1000 Units, and 1500 Units Cinryze groups, respectively. Median interval to complete 
resolution of the HAE attack for the 9 subjects was 13.6 hours (range:  1.6-102.3 hours). The CHMP noted 
that predominantly female subjects were enrolled in the trial. 
For all 3 doses, 500, 1000 and 1500, the primary efficacy endpoint was met by all subjects. For the 
secondary efficacy endpoints, a dose of 1000 U might be faster in its effect for beginning and complete 
resolution of the respective symptoms when compared with the 500 U or 1500 U results. However, patient 
numbers are very low (3 patients in each dosage group) and severity, location, and natural progress of the 
respective symptoms seem to vary considerably. Hence, these results should be taken with caution. 
One (1) of 3 subjects on 500 U and 5 of 6 subjects on 1500 and 1000 U achieved functional C1 INH activities 
≥0.7 U/ml at 1h p.i. which is assumed to represent an effective level. 
Of note, for 1 subject (defining symptom: severe extremity attack) in the 1500 U dose group, the time to 
complete resolution of the HAE attack (102.3 hours) was significantly longer than that of other study 
subjects; this subject had an average of 2 HAE attacks per month during the year prior to enrolment as well 
as having a history of laryngeal attacks. It is not unusual for swelling associated within an extremity attack 
to require 4-5 days for complete resolution, especially for severe swelling.  
Study 624-301 
The aim of the study is to provide further knowledge on the safety and efficacy of Cinryze for the prevention 
of angioedema attacks in children from 6 to less than 12 years of age with HAE. In order to fulfil the PIP 
requirements it was agreed that at least 6 patients would need to be enrolled. The results for these first 6 
subjects completing the study are available for this submission. 
Six paediatric subjects (6 to 11 years of age ) were enrolled and randomized to twice weekly dosing for 12 
weeks in 2 treatment sequences (500/1000 Units or 1000/500 Units). Both doses resulted in similar 
reduction of attack-frequency and showed clinical benefit regarding severity, duration, and requirement for 
acute treatment of attacks. 
Twice weekly administrations of 500 or 1000 U in the sense of a prophylaxis regimen have been 
demonstrated to be effective in 6 of 6 subjects from 7 to 11 years of age with recurrent HAE attacks of 
moderate or severe intensity. Clinically significant reduction in frequency and severity of the attacks 
compared to the observational period was compelling. Benefit of both regimens was similar. 
However, the C4-increase has not been found in study 624-301.  
Data was collected from three subjects in age group 2-5 years only from studies LEVP 2006-1 and LEVP 
2006-4. Nine (9) subjects (treatment) and 6 subjects (prevention) of age group 6-11 years were included 
resulting from the 2 new studies 0624-301 and 0624-203. The combination of all studies provided a total of 
61 paediatric patients (unique subject ID) with a total of 3, 32, and 26 subjects in the 2-5, 6-11 and the 
12-17 years of age cohorts, respectively. 
Since the data for efficacy and safety for children below 6 years of age are very scarce and have not been 
expanded since the time of marketing authorisation, the MAH provided at the CHMP’s request new 
information on 6 additional patients (3-5 years) which have been extracted from the safety database. 
Dose-regimen and respective AE-narratives are available. Cinryze has been used for prophylaxis in all 6 
patients. Only one exposure in one patient was due to an acute treatment. Dose-regimen reflects 1000 IU in 
individual frequency as the “usual” dose – even in the 3 year-old patient. Body weight is not available. The 
narratives mainly identified breakthrough angioedema attacks. No additional risk has been documented.

2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The MAH submitted two additional studies to substantiate efficacy regarding acute HAE treatment and 
prophylaxis in the paediatric population, aged 6-11 years. Both studies are based upon a narrow database 
(9 and 6 paediatric subjects). However, clinically significant response on attack-relief, reduction in 
frequency and severity of the attacks compared to the observational period was compelling. In such rare 
indication, data add significant information on efficacy of Cinryze for treatment of paediatric patients. In 
addition, the CHMP acknowledges that the number of patients is extremely limited in the paediatric 
age-group due to the rarity of the condition, especially the 2-5 years, and, consequently, it will be difficult for 
the MAH to enrol further patients. 
As a consequence, the CHMP endorsed the proposed extension of indication in the following indications: 
• 
Treatment and pre-procedure prevention of angioedema attacks in children (2 years old and above) 
with hereditary angioedema (HAE). 
•  Routine prevention of angioedema attacks in children (6 years old and above) with severe and 
recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE), who are intolerant to or insufficiently protected 
by oral prevention treatments, or patients who are inadequately managed with repeated acute 
treatment. 
In addition, the proposed doses of 500 U (10-25 kg bodyweight) and 1000 U (>25 kg bodyweight) in children 
aged 2 to 11 years in were found acceptable by the CHMP in the treatment and pre-procedure prevention of 
angioedema attacks. However, considering the limited number of patients enrolled in the < 6 years age 
group, the following statement was included in Section 4.2 of the SmPC: “Data supporting dosing 
recommendations in children less than 6 years old are very limited”. 
The proposed dose of 500 U of Cinryze every 3 or 4 days as the recommended starting dose for routine 
prevention against angioedema attacks in children aged 6 to 11 years was found acceptable by the CHMP in 
the routine prevention of angioedema attacks. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety of Cinryze for use in the treatment and prevention of angioedema attacks in paediatric subjects 
with HAE is supported by data from 2 PIP studies. These studies include one Phase 2, open-label, 
single-dosed (0624-203 [Treatment]) and 1 ongoing Phase 3, randomized, single-blind, dose-ranging, 
crossover study (Study 0624-301 [Prevention]. In addition, 4 supportive Phase 3 studies included in the 
original MAA for safety of Cinryze for use in the treatment and prevention of angioedema attacks in 
paediatric subjects with HAE are provided. These studies include two Phase 3, randomized, 
placebo-controlled studies (LEVP 2005-1/A [Treatment] and LEVP 2005-1/B [Prevention]) and 2 larger 
open-label extension studies (LEVP 2006-1 [Treatment] and LEVP 2006-4 [Prevention]). 
Risks of particular interest for Cinryze and other C1 INH products in patients with HAE include 
hypersensitivity, thrombosis, the risk of transmission of infectious diseases, and the development of anti-C1 
INH antibodies. 
Patient exposure 
Study 0624-203 
Nine subjects were enrolled and treated with a single IV dose of Cinryze: 3 subjects received 500 U (10-25 
kg, inclusive), 3 subjects received 1000 U (>25 kg), and 3 subjects received 1500 U (>25 kg). The median 
Assessment report

number (range) of Cinryze units per kilogram of body weight was 22.0 (20.8-28.3), 26.5 (26.0-29.0), and 
31.6 (28.5-51.9) U/kg in the 500 U, 1000 U, and 1500 U Cinryze groups, respectively.

Combined Exposure Data from all Treatment and Prevention Studies 
In the 2 supportive Phase 3 studies for treatment of angioedema attacks (LEVP 2005-1/A and LEVP 2006-1), 
and the 2 supportive Phase 3 studies for prevention of angioedema attacks (LEVP 2005-1/B and LEVP 
2006-4) there were 46 unique paediatric subjects (aged 2-17 years) who received a total of 2,237 infusions 
of IV Cinryze. Altogether, in these 4 studies, there were 26 unique 6-11-year-old subjects, who received a 
total of 1,056 infusions of Cinryze. The majority of infusions used Cinryze doses of 1000 U. 
With the addition of studies 0624-203 (N=9) for treatment of angioedema attacks and 0624-301 (N=6) for 
prevention of angioedema attacks, there are 15 additional paediatric subjects aged  6-11 years old, who 
received a total of 294 infusions of Cinryze. 
Thus, of the total 61 unique paediatric subjects aged 2-17 years who have received Cinryze, 32 subjects 
6-11 years old received a total of 1,350 infusions and 3 subjects 2-5 years old received a total of 49

infusions. Overall across all studies, the 61 unique paediatric subjects (2-17 years of age) received a total of 
2,531 infusions of Cinryze (see Table 26).

Adverse events 
 Treatment Emergent Adverse Events across Paediatric Population 
In all 6 studies, administration of Cinryze to paediatric subjects was generally well tolerated across the 
paediatric population. Most of the reported TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. No clinically 
meaningful trends in the overall incidence of subjects reporting a TEAE considered by the investigator to be 
related to Cinryze were observed within any of these 6 studies, when analyzed by age.

Overall, there were 8 paediatric subjects (six in the 6 to 11 years age group and two in the 12 to 17 years 
age group) with treatment-emergent AEs considered to be related to Cinryze. 
Table 28.  Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Related to Study Drug Among Subjects 
Exposed to Cinryze by Age Group, Indication, and Study- ITT-S Population (Treatment and Prevention 
Studies) 
Study 0624-203 (Treatment) 
Among the 9 paediatric subjects (6-11 years of age) exposed to Cinryze, only 1 paediatric subject (11%) 
who received 500 U Cinryze (28.3 U/kg) for a GI/abdominal angioedema attack, reported 2 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) including mild nausea on Day 1 and mild diarrhea on Day 2, 
both of which resolved without treatment within 1 day. The investigator considered both events to be 
possibly related to study drug and not related to the HAE attack. 
Study 0624-301 (Prevention) 
Among 6 paediatric subjects (7-11 years of age), 55 TEAEs were reported by 5 (83.3%) subjects. 
Twenty-five TEAEs were reported by 4 (66.7) subjects following treatment with 500 U Cinryze, and 30 TEAEs 
were reported by 5 (83.3) subjects following treatment with 1000 U Cinryze. The majority (53/55, 96%) of 
TEAEs experienced by subjects were of mild to moderate intensity; 45 (81.8%) TEAEs were mild, 8 (14.5%) 
TEAEs were moderate and 2 (3.7%) TEAEs were of severe intensity. 
Overall, the most frequently reported TEAEs were angioedema attacks (4 [66.7%] subjects). A similar 
incidence in angioedema attacks were observed for the 500 U and 1000 U doses of Cinryze (3 subjects in 
each dose group reported a total of 6 attacks; that is, during the treatment periods of the study 12 
angioedema attacks were reported as TEAEs). Besides being an endpoint assessment for the study, HAE 
attacks were also recorded as AEs per protocol. 
Other TEAEs frequently reported (by 2 [33.3%] or more subjects overall) were within the SOCs of infections 
and infestations (nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection), general disorders and administrative 
site conditions (fatigue), and psychiatric disorders (irritability). In general, the TEAE profile was similar 
following treatment with 500 U or 1000 U of Cinryze. 
Assessment report  
EMA/873329/2016 
Page 55/65 
 
  
  
 
Thirty-two TEAEs (occurring in 2 [33.3%] subjects at the same site) were considered by the investigator to 
be related to 500 U or 1000 U Cinryze. There were 18 reported TEAEs of fatigue (9 for each Cinryze dose) 
and 14 reported TEAEs of irritability (7 for each Cinryze dose); all TEAEs of fatigue and irritability were 
moderate in intensity that could be considered associated with the investigational product. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths, or SAEs reported in the paediatric population included in the clinical studies, 
0624-203, 0624-301, and LEVP 2005-1/A with Cinryze. 
Eleven non-fatal, treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 4 paediatric subjects in Studies 2005-1/B and 
2006-4. In addition, in Study 2006-1, one subject had 2 non-treatment-emergent SAEs. None of the SAEs 
were considered related to Cinryze. 
No subject in the age range of 2-11 years in the Clinical Development Program experienced SAEs that were 
thromboembolic in nature or related to hypersensitivity, or acquired blood-transmissible infections or 
developed anti-C1 INH antibodies. 
Laboratory findings 
There were no clinically significant safety signals in clinical laboratory parameters or vital signs relative to 
Cinryze administration. 
The immunogenicity of Cinryze was evaluated by an assessment of anti-C1 INH antibodies in the 5 
completed marketing approval studies (LEVP 2005  1/A,   LEVP 2005-1/B, LEVP 2006-5, LEVP 2006-1, and 
LEVP 2006-4). Collectively, the data from these single and multiple-dose studies suggested that there was 
no evidence of clinically relevant anti-C1 INH antibody development following administration of Cinryze in 
subjects aged 2 years and above. 
Based on available data from completed marketing-approval clinical studies, there is no evidence of clinically 
relevant anti-C1 INH antibody development following administration of Cinryze in the age range of 2-11 
years old subjects in the paediatric study population. In Study 0624-203, there was no assessment of 
anti-C1 INH antibody formation following Cinryze administration. The MAH clarified that they didn’t assess it 
since Study 0624-203 was a single dose study. In Study 0624-301, all subjects tested negative for anti-C1 
INH antibodies following 6 months of treatment (2.3 person-years of exposure) with Cinryze. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No studies examining potential drug interactions for Cinryze have been conducted. There are no known drug 
interactions. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No paediatric subject in any clinical studies, 0624-203, 0624-301, LEVP 2005-1/A, LEVP 2005-1/B, LEVP 
2006-5, LEVP 2006-1, or LEVP 2006-4 discontinued study drug (Cinryze or placebo) due to an AE. 
Post marketing experience 
The safety profile from post-marketing experience is consistent with that seen in the clinical development 
program. No new safety issues have been identified in the post-marketing environment for paediatric 
subjects.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Additional safety data were provided by two new studies: Study 0624-203 (treatment) and Study 0624-301 
(prevention). 
Assessment of the safety profile from study 0624-203 (treatment) indicates that IV administration of single 
doses of 500 U (in subjects weighing 10-25 kg, inclusive), and 1000 U and 1500 U (in subjects weighing >25 
kg) of Cinryze was safe and generally well tolerated in children treated for a single acute HAE attack. Only 
one of 9 paediatric subjects reported 2 TEAEs including mild nausea and mild diarrhoea on, which were 
considered possibly related to study drug by the investigator. Of note, this patient was treated for a 
GI/abdominal angioedema attack. A shortcoming of this study is that anti-C1 INH antibody formation 
following Cinryze administration was not assessed. 
Based on available data from completed marketing-approval clinical studies, there is no evidence of clinically 
relevant anti-C1 INH antibody development following administration of Cinryze in the age range of 2-11 
years old subjects in the paediatric study population. 
The safety profile from study 0624-301 correlates with the usual experience in prevention studies. TEAEs 
comprise angioedema attacks, infections of the upper respiratory tract, fatigue and psychiatric disorders like 
irritability. The last two disorders (32 events occurring in 2 patients) were considered to be related to 
investigational product by the investigator. 
Overall, no deaths or other SAEs occurred during these studies, and no subjects had study drug interrupted 
or discontinued due to an adverse event. No new safety issues have been identified. In addition, no subjects 
experienced a TEAE that was thrombotic or thromboembolic in nature during the study. 
There is no evidence for additional safety concerns in the age group 2-5 years based upon information from 
the safety database.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Administration of Cinryze to paediatric subjects was safe and generally well tolerated across the paediatric 
population including the two additional paediatric trials. Most of the reported TEAEs were mild or moderate 
in intensity. There were no apparent differences in the types of TEAEs among paediatric subjects (2-5, 6-11, 
and 12-17 years) compared to adults (≥18 years).

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
The indication of Cinryze is extended in order to include the treatment and pre-procedure prevention of 
angioedema attacks in children (2 years old and above) with hereditary angioedema (HAE) and the routine 
prevention of angioedema attacks in children (6 years old and above) with severe and recurrent attacks of 
hereditary angioedema (HAE), who are intolerant to or insufficiently protected by oral prevention 
treatments, or patients who are inadequately managed with repeated acute treatment. 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 6.5 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated. The key 
messages of educational materials in Annex II, the Labelling and the Package Leaflet are updated in 
accordance. 
For all changes to the Product Information (PI) please refer to the full PI attached in a separate file 
containing all accepted changes together with critical comments and revisions.  
The proposed dose recommendation for children implies changes to Annex A (presentations). A 
consequential update of regional information in eCTD Module 3.2.R has also been submitted. This is 
acceptable. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
Assessment report  
EMA/873329/2016 
Page 59/65 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
- 
Consultation with Target Patient Groups was performed on the English version of the PIL for Cinryze 
500 Units powder and solvent for solution for injection in August and September 2009. The content of the 
current Patient Leaflet has been fully tested and assessed for readability. In 2010 a bridging report was 
submitted when the applicant introduced a Mix2Vial and diagrams to facilitate reconstitution. 
- 
- 
The proposed revisions to the Patient Leaflet are minor: mainly the proposed dose for paediatrics 
Many paediatric patients administering Cinryze are likely to be assisted by carers/parents and the 
Patient Leaflet has already been tested in this population. 
2.8.  Significance of paediatric studies 
The CHMP is of the opinion that studies LEVP 2006-1, LEVP 2006-4, 0624-203, 0624-301, which are 
contained in the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0299/2015, which is completed, and have been 
completed after 26 January 2007, are considered as significant. 
The assessment criteria of the significance of studies, as defined in Section 4.2 of the European Commission 
Communication " Guideline on the format and content of applications for agreement or modification of a 
paediatric investigation plan and requests for waivers or deferrals and concerning the operation of the 
compliance check and on criteria for assessing significant studies” (2014/C 338/01) has been fulfilled, taking 
into account the study type of clinical studies LEVP 2006-1, LEVP 2006-4, 0624-203, 0624-301: 
•  Study LEVP 2006-1: Open-Label Safety/Efficacy Repeat Exposure Study of C1 Esterase Inhibitor 
(Human) in the treatment of acute Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) Attacks. 
•  Study LEVP 2006-4: Open-Label Use of C1 Esterase Inhibitor (Human) for the prophylactic 
treatment to prevent Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) Attacks and as treatment in acute HAE Attacks. 
•  Study 0624-203 was an open-label single-dose study to evaluate the response and 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of different doses of CINRYZE [C1 inhibitor (human)] for 
treatment of acute Angioedema Attacks in children less than 12 years of age with hereditary 
angioedema. 
•  Study 0624-301 was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, single-blind, dose-ranging, Crossover 
Study to evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of intravenous administration of CINRYZE (C1 Esterase 
Inhibitor [Human]) for the prevention of Angioedema Attacks in children 6 to 11 years of age with 
Hereditary Angioedema. 
Those studies make an important contribution to the treatment of children and they are carried out in a 
subset considered particularly difficult to study. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Cinryze is intended for treatment, pre-procedure prevention and the routine prevention of angioedema 
attacks in patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE). Efficacy has been established within the initial MAA 
evaluation and has been confirmed since then. Two additional studies (624-203 and 624-301) have been 
submitted for the current procedure, aiming at extension of the indication of Cinryze for the paediatric 
population in the treatment and pre-procedure prevention of angioedema attacks in children (2 years old 
and above) with hereditary angioedema (HAE) and the routine prevention of angioedema attacks in children 
(6 years old and above) with severe and recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE), who are 
intolerant to or insufficiently protected by oral prevention treatments, or patients who are inadequately 
managed with repeated acute treatment.

Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In line with the results observed as part of the initial MAA evaluation, treatment with Cinryze in study 
624-203 resulted in increases in antigenic and functional C1 INH levels for all 3 doses (500, 100 and 1500 
U) after single-dose administration. All subjects on the respective 3 doses met the primary efficacy endpoint 
(relief within 4 hours). An assumed target level of 0.7 U/ml was achieved for 6 of 9 subjects. C4-increase, 
which might represent a pharmacodynamics-marker for function of the C1-inhibitor, has been found.  
In Study 0624-301, plasma C1 INH antigen and functional activity were measured from 6 patients pre-dose  
and 1h following IV administration of two dose levels of Cinryze (500 Units and 1000 Units) every 3 or 4 days 
for 12 weeks.  Both Cinryze doses resulted in relevant plasma levels of C1 INH antigen and functional 
activity. 
At the CHMP’s request, the MAH submitted data from their safety data-base covering 6 subjects <6 years of 
age and mainly reflecting HAE breakthrough-events. Patients were on prophylaxis and received mainly 1000 
U doses. The efficacy of Cinryze in the age-group 2-5 years of age was confirmed. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The evaluation of efficacy is challenging as the respective disease covers inhomogeneous location, variable 
clinical consequences and differing severities in a narrow patient collective. This assessment is even more 
difficult in the paediatric age-group considering the rarity of the condition.  
Since the initial MAA submission, the MAH has provided additional data for 15 subjects in the age-group of 
6-12 years but the age-group below 6 years remains unchanged (3 subjects included in the inital MAA 
application).  
The presented additional data for 6 patients <6 years at the CHMP’s request derive from the 
safety-data-base. Cinryze has been used for prophylaxis in all 6 patients. Only one exposure in one patient 
was due to an acute treatment. 
PK-sampling was reduced to one pre-dose and two post-dose samples (1 hour and 24 hours p.i.) for study 
0624-203 as no subject agreed to the additional but optional blood sampling necessary to obtain a PK profile 
for antigenic and functional C1 INH levels (additional blood samples collected through 8 hours post-infusion 
on Day 1, and on Days 3, 5, and 8). As a result, no PK parameters were calculated for this study and no 
meaningful PK-evaluation is possible with such truncated data.  
The C4-increase has not been found in study 624-301.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
No new safety issues have been identified in the two additional paediatric studies.  
There is no evidence for additional safety concerns in the age group 2-5 years based upon information from 
the safety data-base submitted during the application. 
The safety profile of Cinryze appears to be similar in the different age groups.  
Based on available data from completed marketing-approval clinical studies, there is no evidence of clinically 
relevant anti-C1 INH antibody development following administration of Cinryze in the age range of 2-11 
years old subjects in the paediatric study population. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In general, the clinical database is narrow for the paediatric population.  
With regard to immunogenicity, anti-C1 INH antibody formation following Cinryze administration has not 
been addressed in Study 0624-203. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The benefits from the therapy with Cinryze have been demonstrated in treatment and prevention of HAE 
attacks. The efficacy of Cinryze in the paediatric population, including the younger age-group, is confirmed. 
The identified unfavourable effects and risks are in general in line with those of other C1 INH products and 
therefore do not raise further concerns.  
The clinical data-base is narrow for the paediatric population especially for children < 6 years of age. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The efficacy in the paediatric population, including the younger age-group, is evident. The safety profile of 
Cinryze appears to be similar in the different age groups.  
Despite the narrow data-base, in such rare indication, the data add significant information on the efficacy of 
Cinryze for treatment of paediatric patients. In addition, the CHMP acknowledges that the number of 
patients is extremely limited in the paediatric age-group due to the rarity of the condition, especially the 2-5 
years, and, consequently, it will be difficult for the MAH to enrol further patients. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Hereditary angioedema is a serious, debilitating, and potentially fatal disease caused by a rare autosomal 
dominant mutation on chromosome 11 that leads to a decrease in C1 INH activity. Attacks range in severity 
from mild to severe, with GI involvement causing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, or may even mimic an 
acute surgical emergency. Laryngeal swelling can be life threatening and these attacks account for the 
mortality risk described for HAE. Hence, HAE attacks require prompt treatment, often in an emergency 
room. Optimal management of C1 INH deficiency should include treatment of acute attacks, short-term 
prophylaxis and long-term prophylaxis in order to minimise the frequency and severity of recurrent attacks. 
The MAH submitted two additional studies to substantiate efficacy regarding acute HAE treatment and 
prophylaxis in the paediatric population, aged 6-11 years. Both studies are based upon a narrow database 
Assessment report  
EMA/873329/2016 
Page 62/65 
 
  
  
(9 and 6 paediatric subjects). However, clinically significant response on attack-relief, reduction in 
frequency and severity of the attacks compared to the observational period was compelling. In such rare 
indication, data add significant information on efficacy of Cinryze for treatment of paediatric patients. 
In conclusion, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit/risk of Cinryze in children with hereditary 
angioedema (HAE) in the treatment and pre-procedure prevention of angioedema attacks from 2 years and 
the routine prevention of angioedema attacks from 6 years is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

Extension of Indication in children with hereditary angioedema (HAE) to include the treatment and 
pre-procedure prevention of angioedema attacks from 2 years and the routine prevention of angioedema 
attacks from 6 years; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 6.5 and 6.6 of the SmPC are 
updated. The key messages of educational materials in the Annex II, the Package Leaflet and the Labelling 
are updated in accordance. In addition, an update of regional information in module 3.2.R due to the 
proposed dose recommendation for children is submitted. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling, Package 
Leaflet and Annex A and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
This CHMP recommendation is subject to the following amended condition:  
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation 
• 
Additional risk minimisation measures  
Prior to launch of the product in each Member State, the Marketing Authorisation Holder shall agree 
the content and format of the educational material with the national competent authority.

Response to treatment 
Any adverse reactions  
It is the responsibility of the prescribing physician to verify that all the necessary skills have been acquired 
by the non-healthcare professional and that Cinryze may be safely and effectively administered at home. 
The existence of a post marketing registry in which health care professionals are encouraged to enter 
patients 
The educational material for non-healthcare professionals should include information on the following key 
elements: 
There are limited data on the use of this medicinal product in home or self-administration.  
For some patients the prescribing physician may decide that Cinryze may be administered at home by a 
non-healthcare professional such as a family member or by self-administration. 
Necessary skills have to be acquired by  non-healthcare professionals before Cinryze may be safely and 
effectively administered at home.  
Their prescribing physician will provide training on the following elements:

Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0299/2015 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
In accordance with Article 45(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, significant studies in the agreed 
paediatric investigation plan P/0299/2015 have been completed after the entry into force of that Regulation. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Cinryze is not similar to Firazyr within the meaning of Article 
3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1

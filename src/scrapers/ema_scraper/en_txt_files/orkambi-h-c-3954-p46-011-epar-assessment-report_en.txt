1.  Introduction 
On 19/03/2018, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Orkambi (Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor), 
in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study titled ‘A Phase 2a, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, 
Incomplete Block, Crossover Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of VX-371 in Subjects Aged 12 
Years or Older With Cystic Fibrosis, Homozygous for the F508del-CFTR Mutation, and Being Treated 
With Orkambi’ (study no: VX15-371-101) is a stand-alone study. 
The abbreviated CSR for Study VX15-371-101 is being submitted under Article 46 of Regulation 
because it involved the use of the authorized medicinal product Orkambi™ as a standard of care 
treatment for all subjects (including pediatric subjects aged ≥  12 to <18 years) participating in the

Study VX15-371-101 was a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, incomplete block, 
crossover, multicenter study in subjects ≥  12 years of age with cystic fibrosis (CF) who were F508del 
homozygous and treated with Orkambi (2 tablets LUM 200 mg/IVA 125 mg administered orally every 
12 hours). All subjects were to receive stable Orkambi treatment for at least 28 days before the first 
dose of inhaled study drug (VX-371 + hypertonic saline (4.2% saline) [HS], HS, VX-371 + placebo 
(1.7% saline), or placebo) and through the Safety Follow-up Telephone Contact or Safety Follow-up 
Visit, which was to occur 28 days after the last dose of study drug. 
The efficacy of Orkambi was not evaluated as part of this study. 
The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment with VX-371 in HS 
compared to HS alone in subjects with CF who are ≥  12 years of age, homozygous for the F508del- 
CFTR 
mutation, and being treated with Orkambi. 
Rationale for this study: 
Mucociliary clearance (MCC) is an important airway defense mechanism that is essential for respiratory 
health. The primary function of MCC is to clear inhaled particles, including inflammatory and infectious 
agents, from the surface of the lung. MCC depends on the coordinated, high frequency beating action 
of the cilia that cover the inner surface of the airways. Efficient ciliary motion is in turn dependent on 
proper regulation of hydration on the epithelial surface. Volume depletion of the airway surface liquid 
(ASL) compromises the efficiency of MCC.11 Inhaled therapies available to improve MCC include 
Pulmozyme (recombinant human dornase alfa, Roche/Genentech), which facilitates expectoration by 
breaking down DNA and decreasing sputum viscosity, and hypertonic saline (HS), which may improve 
airway surface hydration and improve MCC. 
For reasons that are not fully understood, CF is also associated with a paradoxically increased activity 
of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). The resulting combination of inadequate secretion of chloride 
ions and excessive intracellular transport of sodium ions creates an osmotic gradient that results in 
relative dehydration of the secretions in the airway lumen. Inadequate clearance of secretions 
predisposes the airways to bacterial infection. 
When applied topically to the airway, ENaC inhibitors such as amiloride can decrease ENaC activity, 
increase ASL height, and increase MCC.14 While amiloride’s low potency, hyperkalemia, and short half- 
life in the airway make it impractical as a clinical therapy, newer generations of inhaled ENaC inhibitors 
featuring an amiloride pharmacophore have been designed to potently inhibit ENaC function directly on 
the respiratory epithelium, while minimizing exposure to renal ENaC, thereby reducing the risk of 
hyperkalemia and increasing the therapeutic index. 
VX-371 is a new chemical entity belonging to a family of amiloride derivatives referred to as 
pyrazinoylguanidines. VX-371 is a novel ENaC inhibitor that inhibits transport of sodium through direct 
exofacial block of the ENaC. It is hypothesized that the inhibition of ENaC activity with VX-371 will 
increase hydration of airway secretions rendering them more susceptible to MCC and cough clearance 
in subjects with CF.

Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment with VX-371 in HS 
compared to HS alone in subjects with CF who are ≥  12 years of age, homozygous for the F508del- 
CFTR 
mutation, and being treated with Orkambi. 
Secondary objectives included the following: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with VX-371 in HS compared with placebo 
• To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with VX-371 in HS compared with VX-371 in placebo 
• To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with VX-371 in placebo compared with placebo 
• To investigate the pharmacokinetics of VX-371 
Study design 
This was a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, incomplete block, crossover, 
multicenter study in subjects ≥  12 years of age with CF who were F508del homozygous and treated 
with 
Orkambi. All subjects were to receive stable Orkambi treatment starting before the first dose of inhaled 
study drug and through the Safety Follow-up Telephone Contact or Safety Follow-up Visit. 
Approximately 150 subjects were planned to be randomized to 1 of the 4 treatment sequences as 
described in Table 9-1. Each treatment sequence included the following study periods: Treatment 
Period 1, Washout, and Treatment Period 2. 
A schematic of the study design is provided in Figure 9-1. The study included a 28-day Run-in Period 
to ensure all subjects were on a stable Orkambi regimen (Orkambi+) without HS (HS-) before starting 
Treatment Period 1. Subjects who were Orkambi+/HS- at screening did not require a Run-in Period. All 
other subjects had a Run-in Period to become Orkambi+/HS-. Once Orkambi+, all subjects were 
treated with two Orkambi tablets (each containing LUM 200 mg/IVA 125 mg) orally every 12 hours 
(q12h) in the fed state. 
Once subjects were Orkambi+/HS-, they were to progress through Treatment Period 1 (28 days), 
Washout (28 days), and Treatment Period 2 (28 days) based on their randomized treatment sequence 
and were to have a safety follow-up telephone contact at 28 ± 3 days after the end of Treatment 
Period 2. Inhaled study drug was to be administered twice per day (bid) approximately 10 to 12 hours 
apart using a Sponsor-provided nebulizer for oral inhalation.

Safety data were analyzed by inhaled study drug treatment. The Treatment-emergent (TE) Period for 
each treatment was defined as the time from first dose through the safety follow-up or 28 days after 
the last dose, whichever came first. 
Study population /Sample size 
Inclusion criteria: 
Subjects who meet all of the following inclusion criteria will be eligible. 
1. Subject (or subject’s legally appointed and authorized representative) will sign and date an informed 
consent form (ICF) and, where appropriate, assent form. 
2. Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, study restrictions, laboratory tests, 
contraceptive guidelines, and other study procedures. 
3. Willing and able to use the nebulization device as directed by the study manual. 
4. Subjects (male and female) will be aged 12 years or older on the date of ICF or, where appropriate,

5. Subjects with confirmed diagnosis of CF,36 defined as a sweat chloride value ≥  60 mmol/L by 
quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis. A sweat chloride test must be performed at the Screening Visit if 
an eligible sweat chloride value is not available in the subject’s medical records and the Screening Visit 
value is needed to establish eligibility. For subjects using sweat chloride values documented in their 
medical records to establish eligibility, the sweat chloride test at the Screening Visit is optional. If both 
results are available, the result from the Screening Visit will be used to determine eligibility. 
6. Subjects who are homozygous for F508del-CFTR. If the CFTR screening genotype result is not 
received before randomization, a previous CFTR genotype lab report may be used to establish 
eligibility. Note: Subjects who have been randomized and whose screening genotype does not confirm 
study eligibility must be discontinued from the study. 
7. Subjects with ppFEV1 of ≥  40 to <90 percentage points adjusted for age, sex, and 
height  according  to the Global Lung Initiative (GLI)37 at the Screening Visit. 
8. Subjects with stable CF disease as deemed by the investigator. 
9. Subjects who are willing to remain on a stable CF medication regimen through the Safety Follow-up 
Telephone Contact. 
10. Subjects who are willing to discontinue physician-prescribed HS use. 
11. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at the 
Screening Visit. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the 
Day 1 Visit before receiving the first dose of inhaled study drug. 
12.  Subjects of childbearing potential and who are sexually active must meet the contraception 
requirements. 
There were 147 subjects who entered the study, including 55 pediatric subjects aged ≥12 to <18 years 
of age. Of the 147 subjects, 35 were being treated with Orkambi and were not being treated with HS  
at Screening; these subjects proceeded directly to randomization. The remaining 112 subjects entered 
the Run-in Period to either establish a stable Orkambi regimen and/or washout of HS. 
Of the 112 subjects who entered the Run-in Period, 5 subjects discontinued from the study (4 subjects 
were screen failures; 1 subject failed to meet an inclusion criterion) and 107 subjects continued to 
randomization. Thus, 142 subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment sequences 
Exclusion criteria:pertaining to liver, renal dysfunction, transplantations, co morbidities, long QT were 
also defined. 
147 subjects will be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment sequences when they are determined to have met 
all eligibility criteria. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio (VX-371 + 4.2% HS versus 4.2% 
HS; 4.2% HS versus VX-371 + 4.2% HS; VX-371 + placebo versus placebo; placebo versus VX-371 + 
placebo), stratifying for ppFEV1 severity (<70% or ≥70%).

Inhaled study drug (VX-371, 4.2% saline [HS], and 0.17% saline [placebo]) was administered by oral 
nebulized inhalation. Orkambi was administered orally. 
Inhaled study drug was administered bid approximately 10 to 12 hours apart by a PARI eFlow 
nebulizer. The nebulizer device (nebulizer and handset) were provided to the subject for use with the 
inhaled study drug at the Day 1 Visit. This nebulizer has been customized to be used only with the 
inhaled study drug and is not to be used for the inhalation of other treatments. Additionally, it is 
important that the subjects use the provided nebulizer for inhalation of study drug and not use any 
other PARI eFlow devices that they may have. 
Treatments administered to participants randomised to sequences as indicated in table 9.1 
Blinding: The subjects and all site personnel, including the investigator, the site monitor, and the 
study team, were blinded 
Duration of treatment: Excluding the Screening Period, the planned study duration was up to 115 days 
for Orkambi+/HS- subjects and up to 143 days for all other (Orkambi-/HS-, Orkambi-/HS+, and 
Orkambi+/HS+) subjects.

Statistical Methods 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change in ppFEV1 from study baseline to the Day 28 
measurements in each Treatment Period. The null hypothesis to be tested is that the mean change 
from study baseline in ppFEV1 to the Day 28 measurements is the same for VX-371 in combination 
with HS versus HS alone. 
To have a feasible sample size and study duration, this study uses a crossover design. Assuming a 
standard deviation (SD) of 7 percentage points, 50 subjects per sequence are needed to have an 
approximately 81% power to detect a 3 percentage point treatment difference in the mean absolute 
change in ppFEV1 from study baseline at Day 28 between VX-371 + HS and HS alone. The study will 
have an approximately 80% power to detect a 3 percentage point (within treatment) change from 
baseline at Day 28 in ppFEV1 for VX-371. A 2-sided significance level of 0.05 was used in the sample 
size calculations. The sample size also takes into consideration an assumed dropout rate of 10%. 
Summary statistics of the absolute change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(ppFEV1) from baseline at Day 28, and treatment-emergent AEs by pre-specified subgroups (including 
age at screening [≥  12 to <18 years; ≥  18 years]), were provided. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 26 subjects discontinued treatment. During Treatment Period 1, 10 subjects discontinued 
treatment, 7 of whom were due to an adverse event (AE). A total of 7 subjects discontinued during the 
Washout Period. Of the 125 subjects who entered Treatment Period 2, 9 subjects discontinued 
treatment, 5 of whom were due to an AE. Overall, 116 (81.7%) randomized subjects completed both 
treatment periods. 
Efficacy results 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the absolute change from study baseline in ppFEV1 at Day 28 in 
each Treatment Period. There was no statistically significant difference in ppFEV1 at Day 28 between 
any of the following groups: 
• VX-371 + HS versus HS 
• VX-371 + HS versus placebo 
• VX-371 + HS versus VX-371 + placebo 
• VX-371 + placebo versus placebo 
No treatment-related difference for any pre-specified subgroups (based on baseline ppFEV1, age, 
gender, and region) was observed. 
No statistically significant difference between VX-371 + HS versus HS or VX-371 + placebo versus 
placebo was observed in the absolute change in the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) 
respiratory domain score from baseline at Day 28. No clinically meaningful trends between VX-371 + 
HS versus HS or VX-371 + placebo versus placebo were observed for weight, body mass index, or 
pulmonary exacerbations. 
Plasma and urine concentrations of VX-371 were low for both VX-371 + HS and VX-371 + placebo 
treatments.

Safety results 
Overall, treatment with inhaled study drugs was generally safe and well-tolerated. There were no 
deaths and no subject had a life-threatening AE. Twelve subjects had AEs during the treatment 
emergent period that led to study drug discontinuation. The overall incidence of AEs was similar across 
all treatments, and the most common AEs were typical of the clinical manifestations associated with 
CF. There were no clinically meaningful differences in AEs with respect to age, sex, and region. The 
number of AEs was low in each subgroup, and no concerning trends were observed. The incidence of 
subjects with serious adverse events (SAEs) across treatments ranged from 4.4% to 13.0%. No 
evidence of clinically important treatment-related trends was identified from clinical laboratory results, 
vital signs assessments, ECGs, physical examinations, or ophthalmologic examinations. 
Orkambi 
Page 11/13 
 
 
 
 
 
One subject had SAEs of increased alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and blood 
creatine phosphokinase that, in the opinion of the investigator, could have been attributed to Orkambi. 
There were no new safety issues identified for Orkambi 
2.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Study VX15-371-101 was a crossover study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and PK of 
treatment with VX-371 + HS compared to HS alone in subjects with CF who were ≥12 years of age, 
homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, and being treated with Orkambi. Two additional crossover 
treatment sequences allowed for the comparison of VX-371 + placebo versus placebo alone. 
The efficacy of Orkambi was not evaluated as part of this study. Therefore, no additional data related 
to the efficacy of Orkambi was generated from this study, although it was used as baseline treatment 
in all patients. The study did not produce any new safety signals with regard to Orkambi either. 
Main conclusions: 
There was no statistically significant difference between VX-371 + HS versus HS alone, VX-371 + 
placebo, or placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint of absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline at Day 
28. There was no statistically significant difference between VX 371 + placebo versus placebo in the 
absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline at Day 28. 
• There was no statistically significant difference between VX-371 + HS versus HS or VX-371 + 
placebo versus placebo in the absolute change in the CFQ-R respiratory domain from baseline at Day 
28. 
• Treatment with inhaled study drugs was safe and well-tolerated, with most AEs consistent with the 
expected manifestations for CF disease. There were no new safety issues identified for Orkambi. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
This phase 2a study was not intended to evaluate Orkambi but to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and PK 
of treatment with VX-371 + HS compared to HS alone in subjects with CF who were ≥12 years of age, 
homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, and being treated with Orkambi. No new safety issues 
were identified with regard to Orkambi.

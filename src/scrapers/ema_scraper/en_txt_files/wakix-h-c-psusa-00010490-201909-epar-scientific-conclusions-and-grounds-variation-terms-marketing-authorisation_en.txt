Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pitolisant, the scientific 
conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:  
A signal of suicidal ideation was reviewed by the MAH, with a total of 18 cases identified. Based on the 
evaluation of received cases with at least a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship with 
pitolisant, suicidal ideation is added as a new adverse drug reaction in the Product Information. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pitolisant the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pitolisant is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The proposed product is an immediate release film-coated 5 mg and 7.5 mg tablets containing ivabradine 
hydrochloride as active substance. Ivabradine hydrochloride is a chemical substance and the dosage form has 
been developed as generic product to the centrally authorised product Procoralan containing the same active 
substance in the same pharmaceutical form. 
Ivabradine acts by inhibiting the If current, which modulates pacemaker activity in the sino-atrial node, 
providing heart rate reduction. Ivabradine is intended for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina 
pectoris in coronary artery disease adults with normal sinus rhythm and heart rate ≥70 bpm and it is indicated 
in adults unable to tolerate or with a contra-indication to the use of beta-blocker or in combination with 
beta-blockers in patients with inadequately controlled with an optimal beta-blocker dose. Ivabradine is also 
indicated in chronic heart failure NYHA II to IV class with systolic dysfunction, in patients in sinus rhythm and 
whose heart rate is ≥75 bpm, in combination with standard therapy including beta-blocker therapy or when 
beta-blocker therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated. 
Ivabradine was first introduced into the market in Europe eight years ago as Procoralan film coated tablets. 
Current Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) is based on “essential similarity” to the original product in 
accordance with Article 10(1) (a) (iii) of Directive 2001/83/EC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/263015/2017 
Page 10/38 
 
  
  
This MAA is made on the basis that ivabradine film-coated tablets 5/7.5 mg is essentially similar to Procoralan 
5/7.5 mg film-coated tablets marketed by Les Laboratoires Servier, France. The indications sought are the same 
as those for Procoralan 5/7.5 mg film-coated tablets.  
One bioequivalence study comparing ivabradine film-coated tablets 7.5 mg against Procoralan 7.5 mg 
film-coated tablets under fed conditions was conducted and submitted within current MAA and was considered 
pivotal.  
The proposed indications are: 
Symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris 
Ivabradine is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris in coronary artery 
disease adults with normal sinus rhythm and heart rate ≥ 70 bpm. Ivabradine is indicated: 
or 
- 
- 
in adults unable to tolerate or with a contra-indication to the use of β-blockers 
in combination with β-blockers in patients inadequately controlled with an optimal β-blocker dose. 
Treatment of chronic heart failure 
Ivabradine is indicated in chronic heart failure NYHA II to IV class with systolic dysfunction, in patients in sinus 
rhythm and whose heart rate is ≥ 75 bpm, in combination with standard therapy including β- blocker therapy or 
when β-blocker therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated. 
The recommended dose range is 2.5 or 7.5 mg twice daily.  
Symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris 
It is recommended that the decision to initiate or titrate treatment takes a place with the availability of serial 
heart measurements, ECG or ambulatory 24-hour monitoring. The starting dose of ivabradine should not exceed 
5  mg  twice  daily  in  patients  aged  below  75  years.  After  three  to  four  weeks  of  treatment,  if  patient  is  still 
symptomatic, if the initial dose is well tolerated and if resting heart rate remains above 60 bpm, the dose may 
be  increased  to  the  next  higher  dose  in  patients  receiving  2.5  mg  twice  daily  or  5  mg  twice  daily.  The 
maintenance dose should not exceed 7.5 mg twice daily. If there is no improvement in symptoms of angina 
within 3 months after start of treatment, treatment of ivabradine should be discontinued. 
In addition, discontinuation of treatment should be considered if there is only limited symptomatic response and 
when there is no clinically relevant reduction in resting heart rate within three months. If, during treatment, 
heart rate decreases below 50 bpm at rest or the patient experiences symptoms related to bradycardia such as 
dizziness, fatigue or hypotension, the dose must be titrated downward including the lowest dose of 2.5 mg twice 
daily (one half 5 mg tablet twice daily). After dose reduction, heart rate should be monitored (see section 4.4). 
Treatment must be discontinued if heart rate remains below 50 bpm or symptoms of bradycardia persist despite 
dose reduction. 
Treatment of chronic heart failure 
The treatment has to be initiated only in patient with stable heart failure. It is recommended that the treating 
physician should be experienced in the management of chronic heart failure. The usual recommended starting 
dose of ivabradine is 5 mg twice daily. After 2 weeks of treatment, the dose can be increased to 7.5 mg twice

daily if resting heart rate is persistently above 60 bpm or decreased to 2.5 mg twice daily (one half 5 mg tablet 
twice daily) if resting heart rate is persistently below 50 bpm or in case of symptoms related to bradycardia such 
as dizziness, fatigue or hypotension. If heart rate is between 50 and 60 bpm, the dose of 5 mg twice daily should 
be maintained. 
If  during  treatment,  heart  rate  decreases  persistently  below  50  bpm  at  rest  or the  patient  experiences 
symptoms  related  to  bradycardia,  the  dose  must  be  titrated  downward  to  the  next  lower  dose  in patients 
receiving 7.5 mg twice daily or 5 mg twice daily. If heart rate increases persistently above 60 bpm at rest, the 
dose can be up titrated to the next upper dose in patients receiving 2.5 mg twice daily or 5 mg twice daily. 
Treatment must be discontinued if heart rate remains below 50 bpm or symptoms of bradycardia persist. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 5 mg or 7.5 mg of ivabradine (as 
hydrochloride) as active substance. 
Other ingredients of the tablet core are: anhydrous lactose, magnesium stearate (E470b), pregelatinised starch 
(maize) and colloidal hydrated silica. 
Ingredients of the film-coating are: polyvinyl alcohol (E1203), titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol 4000, talc 
(E553b), yellow iron oxide (E172) and red iron oxide (E172). 
The product is available in aluminium/aluminium perforated unit dose blisters, as described in section 6.5 of the 
SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of ivabradine hydrochloride is 
3-[3-({[(7S)-3,4-dimethoxybicyclo[4.2.0]octa-1(6),2,4-trien-7-yl]methyl}(methyl)amino)propyl]-7,8-dimeth
oxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepin-2-one, hydrochloride corresponding to the molecular formula 
C 27H37ClN2O2 and has a molecular weight of 505.05 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1. Chemical structure of ivabradine hydrochloride. 
Assessment report  
EMA/263015/2017 
Page 12/38 
 
  
  
 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of Fourier transform infrared absorption 
spectrophotometry, ultraviolet spectrophotometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry and mass 
spectrometry. A screening of crystalline forms was performed using X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD). 
The active substance is a white to slightly yellow hygroscopic powder, soluble in water, solutions of physiological 
pH and dimethyl sulfoxide. It is freely soluble in methanol and dichloromethane. 
Ivabradine hydrochloride exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. The chiral centre is 
generated under substrate control during the synthetic process. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by 
chiral HPLC in the specifications of the active substance. 
Polymorphism has been observed for ivabradine hydrochloride. Seven crystalline forms have been identified and 
δd-form has been selected for further development. It has been demonstrated that the active substance 
manufacturing process consistently produces crystalline δd-form of the active substance. Polymorphic form is 
controlled in the specifications of the active substance. 
There is no monograph of ivabradine hydrochloride in the European Pharmacopoeia. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the 
ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
One source of the active substance is used although two manufacturers are responsible for different steps of its 
production. 
Ivabradine hydrochloride is synthesized in a two-branch convergent process using two commercially available 
well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. The branches consist of six and four chemical 
synthesis steps respectively, followed by a coupling reaction and purification and salt formation. The starting 
materials were re-defined during the procedure, at the request of CHMP, in order to ensure that critical steps and 
enough of the synthetic process are included in the dossier, thereby ensuring the quality of the active substance 
throughout its lifecycle. As a result of this, a new manufacturer was added to the dossier and the QP declaration 
was updated. An extensive discussion and on impurities with mutagenic potential is presented and followed 
which was deemed acceptable and in line with Guideline ICH M7. Reprocessing is claimed for a part of 
manufacturing process. At the time of opinion the recommended criteria for deciding when the reprocessing can 
be performed and data showing that reprocessing has been validated related to specific reprocessing procedures 
applied was not provided, however it is considered that this minor unresolved quality issue has no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The CHMP recommends that this is addressed in future quality development. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials, and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in transparent polyethylene (LDPE) bag under nitrogen and tightly sealed with 
strip seal. The primary sealed transparent polyethylene bag is packed in second transparent polyethylene bag 
containing activated silica under nitrogen and tightly closed with strip seal. The secondary packed material is 
again packed in transparent polyethylene bag containing activated silica under nitrogen and tightly closed with 
Assessment report  
EMA/263015/2017

strip seal. The finally container is an aluminium can containing activated silica under nitrogen. The primary 
packaging complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, solubility (Ph. Eur.) identification including 
polymorphic δd-form (IR, HPLC, XRD), chlorides (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy 
metals (Ph. Eur.), clarity of solution (ph. Eur.), enantiomeric purity (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), assay 
(HPLC), residual solvents (GC), hydrochloric acid content (titration), palladium content (ICP-OES), particle size 
distribution (laser diffraction) and microbiological examination (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities are all limited to below the qualification threshold as per ICH Q3A. Detailed calculations of purge and 
fate of the different identified potentially mutagenic impurities (PMI) under the conditions of the manufacturing 
process have been provided and the control strategy for PMI was considered acceptable. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. As part of related substances, enantiomeric purity and residual 
solvents method validation, the applicant provides the signal to noise ratio values which are greater than 3. At 
the time of opinion the recommended recalculation of this ratio was not done, however it is considered that this 
minor unresolved quality issue has no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The CHMP recommends 
that this is addressed in future quality development. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on three productions scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
The active substance specifications are based on the active substance critical quality attributes (CQA). 
Stability 
Stability data on six production scale batches and on three laboratory scale batches of active substance stored 
in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market, for up to eighteen months under 
long term conditions at 5±3 °C and for up to six months under accelerated conditions at 25±2 °C / 60±5% RH, 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Results on stress conditions 
including acidic, alkaline medium, with oxidising agent, heat, UV and fluorescent light degradation and humidity 
degradation were also provided on one batch. 
The following parameters were tested: description, identity including polymorphic δd-form, water content, 
clarity of solution, enantiomeric purity, related substances, assay and microbiological examination. The 
analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
Data from long term, accelerated, and photostability studies demonstrate little or no change over time and all 
tested parameters were within the specifications.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 12 months in the proposed air tight container at 
2-8 °C and protected from moisture.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as immediate release film-coated tablets. The 5 mg strength is presented as 
salmon coloured, oblong shaped, approximately 8.50 mm by 4.50 mm in size, scored on both sides film-coated 
tablet and debossed with “FK” on one side and “2” on other side of the tablet. The 7.5 mg strength is presented 
as salmon coloured, triangular shaped, approximately 7.30 mm by 6.769 mm in size film-coated tablet and 
debossed with “FK” on one side and “1” on other side of the tablet. The different strengths of the film-coated 
tablets differ in shape, dimensions, scoring (5 mg film-coated tablets can be divided into equal doses) and 
debossing.  
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. The aim of the pharmaceutical 
development was to develop a generic version of the reference product, Procoralan film-coated tablets, with 
equivalent performance in clinical use and the following Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP): immediate 
release film-coated tablet for oral administration in 5 and 7.5 mg strengths, packed in alu-alu blisters; 
immediate release enabling Tmax in 2 h; bioequivalence to the reference medicinal product; meeting the same 
or compendial or other applicable quality standards and stability of at least 24 months at room temperature. The 
following critical quality attributes (CQA) are defined: physical attributes of appearance, size, scoring and 
friability; assay; content uniformity; degradation products and dissolution. The CQAs were identified based on 
the performed risk-assessments. The formulation development has been evaluated through the use of design of 
experiments. 
Since the active substance is freely soluble across the physiological pH (BCS Class I), control of polymorphic 
form and particle size are not critical to ensure a consistent performance in vivo. The impact of finished product 
manufacturing process on the polymorphic form of the active substance has been studied and it has been 
demonstrated that it remains stable throughout the shelf-life. The active substance particle size is controlled in 
the active substance specifications due to its impact of manufacturability of the finished product. 
The formulation of Ivabradine Accord is based on the formulation of the reference medicinal product. Both 
formulations are qualitatively similar in terms of excipients, with minor differences in the composition of the 
tablet core (the reference medicinal product additionally contains maltodextrin) and film-coating (PVA based in 
Ivabradine Accord and hypromellose based in the reference medicinal product). The differences in the 
formulation were deemed not significant based on the comparative dissolution profiles in different media (0.1N 
HCl, pH 4.5 acetate buffer, pH 6.8 phosphate buffer and purified water. In-line with the reference product, 
Ivabradine Accord 5 mg film-coated tablets have been developed as scored tablets. Study related to subdivision 
of tablets was performed and found acceptable. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards 
and legal requirements. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. A series of binary active 
substance-excipient compatibility studies was performed and the results demonstrated good compatibility. 
The developed dissolution method is in line with Ph. Eur. requirements. To assess discriminatory power of the 
dissolution method, a trial batch was manufactured. The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has 
been demonstrated, as the modified formulation failed to meet specifications. 
Standard direct compression has been selected as the manufacturing process for the film-coated tablets due to 
ease of manufacturing and good compatibility of the ingredients. Blending time, lubrication step, hardness and

coating step were optimised during the development before the scale-up of the process. The manufacturing 
process used to manufacture the clinical batches used in bioequivalence study is the same as the one used to 
manufacture commercial batches. 
A bioequivalence study was performed showing bioequivalence between Ivabradine Accord 7.5 mg film-coated 
tablets and the reference medicinal product. Based on the acceptable study, a request for a waiver of 
bioequivalence study on the remaining strength (5 mg) was submitted and found acceptable an in line with the 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence. A strength biowaiver for 5 mg strength was considered 
justified as the generic product strengths are dose proportional in terms of the film-coated tablet contents, are 
manufactured using the same process and manufacturer, exhibit similar dissolution profiles across the 
physiological pH range and pharmacokinetics of ivabradine is linear over an oral dose range of 0.5 – 24 mg.. 
The primary packaging is alu-alu blisters and/or PPCP container used as bulk transportation packaging. The 
material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and a hold time study for bulk container and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: sifting, blending, compression, coating and packaging. 
A common blend is used for both tablet strengths. The critical steps include blending, compression of the tablets, 
coating of the tablets and packaging operations. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing 
process.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible 
manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and the pharmaceutical 
form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications, shown below for the 5 mg film-coated tablet, include appropriate 
tests for this kind of dosage form and include tests for description, average weight of the tablet (weighing), 
identification (UV, HPLC), water content (KF), dissolution (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), assay 
(HPLC), related substances (HPLC), microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.) and resistance to crushing. The 
specification for the 7.5 mg strength is identical other than the description, average weight of the tablets and 
resistance to crushing. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing 
has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for two commercial scale batches of each film-coated tablet strength 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing.

Stability of the product 
Stability data on two commercial scale batches of each strength of finished product stored under long term 
conditions for 18 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% 
RH, according to the ICH guidelines, were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for the same parameters as for release. The analytical procedures used are the same as 
used for release and are stability indicating. 
No significant changes have been observed under long term or accelerated conditions.  
Forced degradation studies on samples treated under alkaline, acidic, oxidation, water and heat stress 
conditions, UV light conditions have been performed as part of the validation of the analytical methods, 
demonstrating that they are stability indicating. The results demonstrated an increase in impurities under 
alkaline, acidic, oxidation, water and heat stress conditions. No major degradation is observed in UV degradation 
study. 
In addition, samples from one batch of each of the film-coated tablet strengths were exposed to light as defined 
in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. No out of specification 
results was observed in any of the tested parameters (description, assay and related substances), 
demonstrating their photostability. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is 
acceptable. This medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those used 
to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant 
material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal 
Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
No other excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were two minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation: 
The CHMP recommends to complement the dossier by (a) providing criteria for deciding when the active 
substance reprocessing can be performed and (b) evidencing that reprocessing has been validated by real data 
related to specific reprocessing procedures applied. 
The CHMP recommends to recalculate limits of detection of the active substance analytical methods for related 
substances, enantiomeric purity and residual solvents so that the signal to noise ratio equals 3. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate 
additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the 
SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Ivabradine Accord manufactured by Accord Healthcare Ltd was considered unlikely to result in any significant 
increase in the combined sales volumes for all ivabradine hydrochloride containing products and the exposure of 
the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA was expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
This application concerns a generic application and the data submitted are considered relevant and sufficient. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Ivabradine Accord was provided and was 
accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional non-clinical studies were 
not considered necessary.

2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for film-coated tablet containing ivabradine hydrochloride. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted one bioequivalence study with cross-over design under fed 
conditions. This study was considered pivotal study for the assessment. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment the EMA Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (Doc. Ref.: 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr ** ), EMA Note for Guidance on the investigation of bioavailability and 
bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98),  as well as the EMA Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2** ) were of particular relevance.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption  
Bio-waiver for remaining strength (Ivabradine film-coated tablets 5 mg)  
Based on the bio-equivalence study for Ivabradine film-coated tablets 7.5 mg, a request for bio-waiver for the 
remaining strength i.e. 5 mg was placed based on the following general requirements: 
a) All the strengths i.e. 5 mg and 7.5 mg of proposed pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same 
manufacturing process,  
b) The qualitative composition of the Ivabradine film-coated tablets 5 mg is same as that of Ivabradine 
film-coated tablets 7.5 mg. 
c) The composition of both strengths i.e. 5 mg and 7.5 mg are quantitatively proportional i.e. the ratio between 
the amount of each excipient to the amount of active substance(s) is same for all the strengths.  
d) In-vitro dissolution data on all the strengths confirms the adequacy of waiving additional in vivo 
bioequivalence testing. 
It is stated in the EMA Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (Doc. Ref.: CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev. 1/ Corr ** ) that for products where all the above conditions a) to d) are fulfilled and the products show 
linear pharmacokinetics, it is sufficient to establish bioequivalence with only one of the strengths. The proposed 
formulations fulfil all the above criteria, thus 7.5 mg strength has been selected as a BE investigation strength.   
The dissolution profiles comparison of Ivabradine film-coated tablets 5 mg and bio-batch i.e. Ivabradine 
film-coated tablets 7.5 mg showed more than 85% of drug release within 15 minutes, so dissolution profiles are 
considered similar without any mathematical calculation for similarity. Hence, the dissolution profiles can be 
Assessment report  
EMA/263015/2017

acceptable and it proves that test product (5 mg strengths) is similar to the test product (7.5 mg strength, 
bio-batch).   
Linear pharmacokinetics of Ivabradine 
The pharmacokinetics of ivabradine is linear over an oral dose range of 0.5-24 mg (as indicated in the SmPC for 
Procoralan). Also in a study, healthy non-smoking volunteers were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment 
groups based on treatment with 5, 10 or 20 mg of ivabradine. After a single dose, the subjects assigned to the 
3 dose groups received repeated oral doses of ivabradine BID for 6 days. The results show that after the single 
dose, plasma ivabradine Cmax and AUC increased approximately linearly with dosage (Jiang J et al. 2013).    
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study (074-14).

Population studied 
The subjects who participated in the study were non-smoker, healthy, adult, male, in the age range of 18 to 45 
years (both inclusive) living in India. They had a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.5 and 27.0 (both inclusive), 
calculated as weight in kg/height in m2. Body weight should be more than 50 kg. 
A total of 61 subjects (Subject Nos. 1001-1056, 2002, 2020, 2040, X-1 and X-2) were enrolled in Period-I of the 
study. On the day of check-in for Period-I, prior to check-in, Subject Nos. 1002, 1020 and 1040 discontinued 
from the study on their own accord. They were replaced with next available volunteer having ASN 29, ASN 40

and  ASN  64  respectively.  The  subjects  were  then  allotted  Subject  Nos.  2002,  2020  and  2040  respectively. 
Hence, a total of 58 subjects (Subject Nos. 1001, 2002, 1003-1019, 2020, 1021-1039, 2040, 1041-1056, X-1 
and X-2) were checked in for the study. Subject Nos. X-1 and X-2 were checked in for the study, in order to 
compensate  for  any  dropouts  prior  to  dosing  in  Period-I.    After  being  checked-in,  Subject  No.  1047  was 
withdrawn from the study on the grounds of protocol non-compliance. He was replaced with Subject No. X-2 
who was later allotted Subject No. 2047. Subject No. 1054 discontinued from the study on his own accord. He 
was replaced with Subject No. X-1 who was later allotted Subject No. 2054.  
Hence,  as  per  the  protocol,  56  subjects  (Subject  Nos.  1001,  2002,  1003-1019,  2020,  1021-1039,  2040,

3 from the 56 subjects were withdrawn / discontinued from the study in Period II and therefore 3x22=66 
samples were missing 
It appeared that the applicant has performed the standard validations for the analytical method. However, there 
were certain issues that needed to be clarified by the applicant such as the high value of the upper limit of the 
intra-day accuracy (113.3%), the low recovery values for ivabradine (92.6, 90.6 and 90.5% for LQC, MQC & 
HQC standards) in relation with quite higher recovery value of the Internal Standard (97.9%) as well as the 
lower claimed acceptance limit of 30%. In addition the applicant was asked to provide chromatographs with both 
peaks of Ivabradine and IS depicted on them and justify the resolution of the relevant peaks. The questions were 
raised in an effort to clarify and fully identify any potential flaws in the analytical method that could have a 
significant  impact  on  the  results.  In  addition  the  questions  were  raised  to  remove  any  doubts  on  that  the 
sequence effect was a pure chance finding of the study and not a systematic error of the analytical procedure. 
The  responses  of  the  applicant  were  in  accordance  with  the  general  widely  known  practice  and  thus  were 
considered sufficient. 
Pharmacokinetic variables 
Efficacy was primarily assessed by the pharmacokinetic properties of the test and the reference formulations by 
measurement of Ivabradine concentration in plasma.  
The following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated:  
Primary pharmacokinetic parameters:  Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞  
Secondary pharmacokinetic parameters:  Tmax, λz, t1/2 and AUC_%Extrap_obs 
These pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for Ivabradine by non-compartmental model using 
WinNonlin Professional Software Version 5.3 (Pharsight Corporation, USA). 
The pharmacokinetic variables chosen for demonstration of bioequivalence were considered appropriate.

Statistical methods 
Descriptive statistics were calculated and reported for all pharmacokinetic parameters of Ivabradine.  ANOVA, 
power and ratio analysis for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were 
computed for Ivabradine. Using two-one sided tests for bioequivalence, 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of 
the geometric least-squares means between drug formulations were calculated for ln-transformed 
pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for Ivabradine. ANOVA model was to be included 
Sequence, Subject (Sequence), Formulation and Period as fixed effects. Each analysis of variance was to be 
included calculation of least-squares means, the difference between adjusted formulations means and the 
standard error associated with the differences.   
An F-test was to be performed to determine the statistical significance of the effects involved in the model at a 
significance level of 5% (alpha = 0.05). The power of the study to detect 20% difference between test and 
reference formulations was to be calculated and reported for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters 
Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ of Ivabradine. Ratio of geometric least squares means of test and reference 
formulations was to be calculated and reported for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t 
and AUC0-∞ for Ivabradine. Intra-subject variability was to be calculated and reported for ln-transformed 
pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for Ivabradine. Any missing samples (M) or 
non-reportable (NR) concentration values were to be disregarded in pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis.  
Using two one-sided tests for bioequivalence, 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of geometric least squares 
means between drug formulations were to be calculated for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, 
AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for Ivabradine. 
Blinding 
This was an open-label study. Blinding was not applicable.  
Determination of Sample Size 
Based on the available literature data, the intra-subject variability observed for primary pharmacokinetic 
parameter Cmax was found to be ~ 23%, the sample size computation was determined using SAS by 
considering the following assumptions:  
T/R ratio = 90.0-110.0%  
Intra-Subject C.V (%) ~ 23%  
Significance Level = 5%  
Power ≥  80%   
Bioequivalence Limits = 80.00 – 125.00 % 
Based on the above estimates and considering dropouts and/or withdrawals, a sample size of 56 subjects was 
considered to be sufficient to establish bioequivalence between formulations with adequate power for pivotal 
study. 
All statistical analyses for Ivabradine were performed using PROC GLM of SAS® Version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., 
USA). Selection of PK parameters, determination of sample size, statistical evaluation of the PK parameters and 
the acceptance ranges for bioequivalence were in accordance with the EMA Guideline on the investigation of 
bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1 Cor**). The statistical methods chosen were considered 
adequate.

Results 
A tabular summary of the bioequivalence study is given below and a study summary is included at the end of this 
clinical overview. In this study of Ivabradine film-coated tablets 7.5 mg, the 90% confidence interval lay within 
the accepted range of 80.0-125.0 for Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞. Thus, the study has demonstrated that a 
single dose of the applicant’s Ivabradine film-coated ts 7.5 mg is bioequivalent to a single dose of Procoralan 7.5 
mg film-coated tablets.

Based  on  the  above  table,  formulation  effect  is  found  to  be  statistically  insignificant  for  ln-transformed 
pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and   AUC0-∞ of Ivabradine.  
Sequence effect is found to be statistically significant for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, 
AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ of Ivabradine. The cause for significant sequence effect could not be found with certainty. 
Under special circumstances the significant sequence effect can be ignored. The study [1] was a single dose

successfully.  Hence,  it  was  agreed  that  this  sequence  effect  was  just  statistically  significant  and  could  be 
ignored. 
Period effect is found to be statistically insignificant for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameter Cmax but 
it is found to be statistically significant for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ of 
Ivabradine. In the study, clinical conditions were kept identical in both periods of the study, and there were no

pre-dose concentrations observed. The decision of bioequivalence was based on the 90% confidence interval by 
Schuirmann  two  one  sided  ‘t’  test  which  was  within  the  acceptance  criteria  i.e.  80.00  to  125.00%.  It  was 
considered that this significant period effect for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-t and AUC0-
∞ was just statistically significant and could be ignored.  
Subject  (Sequence)  effect  was  found  to  be  statistically  significant  for  ln-transformed  pharmacokinetic 
parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ of Ivabradine. Since each subject was assigned only one sequence, 
subjects were nested within sequence. This Subject (Sequence) effect was tested by the Residual and should be 
highly significant. This significance was an indication that the purpose of using the crossover design has been 
realized in that the between-subject variance was significantly larger than the residual. The above mentioned 
justification  provided  by  the  applicant  was  further  discussed  and  further  justifications  were  required.  The 
statistical  significance  of  the  sequence  effect  for  both  Cmax  and  AUC  was  quite  high  0.004  and  0.002 
respectively. The additional justifications presented by the applicant were considered sufficient. 
Safety data 
One (01) significant AE was reported in Period-II. The AE was reported after administration of Test Product-T. 
The AE was moderate in nature. The causality assessment was judged as unrelated for the AE. The subject was 
withdrawn from the study on medical grounds. He was treated appropriately and followed up until resolution of 
this AE. There was no death or serious adverse event during the conduct of the study. 
This patient reported to the clinical facility with complaint of multiple abrasions over back of thigh and back of 
trunk. He informed that he had fallen down on road at approximately 10:00 hours on 31 July 2015 and had 
complaints of pain and swelling over affected local sites. The adverse event was sudden at onset, occurred as 
single episode and moderate in nature. He was withdrawn from the study on medical grounds. He was treated 
with medication and was followed up until resolution of his AE. His adverse event was resolved at 17:00 hours 
on 05 August 2015. The adverse event was moderate in nature and the relationship of the adverse event to the 
study drug was considered to be unrelated. 
In general, the clinical portion of the study was completed with one (01) significant AE. The investigational 
products were well tolerated by healthy subjects, as a single dose administration.   There were no clinically 
significant findings in the vital signs assessment, ECG recordings or the laboratory tests in any of the subjects in 
the study.

2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Statistical analysis of the bioequivalence (BE) study was performed on the pharmacokinetic data for 53 subjects 
(56 subjects on test treatment and 53 subjects on reference treatment). The applicant presented that the 90% 
confidence interval of the test/reference ratio from the ANOVA of the log-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-∞-, and 
Cmax were within the acceptance criteria of 80.00-125%.  
The CHMP noted also additional publication that has compared the pharmacokinetic profile of ivabradine under 
fasting conditions (Choulwar Amol K*, Mungantiwar Ashish A., Chintamaneni Meena “A comparative, 
Bioequivalence study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of single dose Ivabradine 7.5mg Tablets 
in healthy, adult, human subjects under fasting condition” Research Journal of Pharmacy and Technology Year 
: 2012, Volume : 5, Issue : 5 First page : ( 658) Last page : ( 666) Print ISSN : 0974-3618. Online ISSN : 
0974-360X).  
The SmPC dosing recommendations provide recommendations for administration in the fed state and the 
post-prandial investigation of BE was acceptable.  
However, a strong sequence effect has been observed. The sequence effect could be caused by three 
confounded sources (i.e. the sources cannot be distinguished): (i) the true sequence effect (difference in 
mean of TR- mean of RT), (ii) the differential carry-over effect of the two drugs into the next period: the 
response on the second period depends on the response in the first period and this dependency differs 
depending on which of the two treatments was given during the first period, (iii) the drug by period 
interaction: the difference between drugs is different for the two periods. Therefore, if a significant sequence 
effect is found, the 90% CI for T/R could be biased due to possible differential carry-over effect. A properly 
designed and executed study should lack of differential carry-over effect or product by period interaction. 
When an adequate wash-out period exists, the carry over effects are usually eliminated. When a sequence 
effect is presented, then, the results from the first period only should be analysed. In this case, one-half of the 
data wwould be lost (second period) and there would be less chance to detect bioequivalence. The explanations 
provided initialy by the applicant covered only the case of differential carry-over effect (without excluding the 
validity of bioanalysis).  
The applicant explained that the cause for significant sequence effect could not be found with 
certainty. Therefore under special circumstances the significant sequence effect can be ignored. The study [1] 
was a single dose study [2] was in healthy volunteers, [3] was not comparing an endogenous substance, [4] had 
an adequate washout and [5] used appropriate design and analysis. Moreover, study meets bioequivalence 
criteria successfully. Hence, this sequence effect is just statistically significant and can be ignored." The 
applicant provided further explanations that were accepted by the CHMP.  
The statistical significance of the sequence effect for both Cmax and AUC was quite high: 0.004 and 0.002, 
respectively. A well designed study should not contain a sequence effect. The factors contributing to this can be 
a combination of the three factors mentioned above (i, ii and iii). Since, excluding the carry-over 
pharmacokinetic effect, it was not clear which factor contributed to the effect observed, the results of both, first 
and second periods, should be analysed for demonstration of bioequivalence. 
Subject (Sequence) effect was found to be statistically significant for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic 
parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ of Ivabradine. Since each subject was assigned only one sequence, 
subjects were nested within sequence. This Subject (Sequence) effect was tested by the residual and should 
be highly significant. This significance was an indication that the purpose of using the crossover design has

been realized in that the between-subject variance was significantly larger than the residual. The 
clarifications presented by the applicant were considered sufficient. 
Concerning the validation of the analytical report there were certain issues identified that were further 
discussed and clarified. According to the validation report the intra-day accuracy ranged from 98.1 to 
113.3%. The applicant was requested to justify and discuss the high value of the upper limit (113.3%).  
The recovery values for ivabradine (92.6, 90.6 and 90.5% for LQC, MQC & HQC standards) were low and 
quite lower compared to the respective value of the recovery of the Internal Standard [ISTD] (97.9%).  
In addition the acceptance limits were claimed to be 30-115%. The lower limit (30%) was asked to be 
better justified.  
Also, the ivabradine and IS peaks were presented in separate chromatographs. The applicant was asked to 
provide chromatographs with both peaks of Ivabradine and ISTD depicted on them. In addition taking 
into account the close values of the retention times of the drug and ISTD the applicant was requested to 
discuss the resolution of the relevant peaks, since this could not be identified from the analytical validation study 
report.  
In responses provided the applicant has referred to (1) the entire method validation that was performed 
before start of the subject sample analysis AND (2) the experiments concerning the system suitability 
and the auto sampler carry-over effect that was performed before subject sample analysis (pre-study 
validation). The results of both experiments were well within the acceptance criteria.  In addition, during the 
conduction of the study, required set of quality control samples were analyzed along with each analytical run 
(“in-study validation”) and the relevant results were presented in the bioanalytical report. 20% of 
chromatograms of serially selected subjects (including chromatograms of calibration curve standards and 
quality control samples) have been appended to the bio-analytical report. The applicant has submitted within  
responses 100% of chromatograms of subjects as requested. In addition to that incurred sample 
reproducibility (ISR) experiment was also performed and provided by the applicant. Those data of ISR were 
also considered as “in-study validation”.  
The applicant agreed that the intra-day accuracy of lower limit of quantification of the quality control (LLOQ 
QC) samples for P&A I was slightly on higher side (113.3 %) and therefore results of P&A batch of method 
validation were checked again. The intra-day % accuracy of lower limit of quantification LLOQ QC samples for 
another 2 P&A batches were 96.2 % and 102.1 %. These data revealed that there was no spiking error observed 
(i.e. spiking on higher side). Drug area responses for LOQ QC samples were slightly on higher side, which 
resulted into higher % accuracy. However, it was agreed with the applicant that this does not have any impact 
on final outcome of the results as intra-day accuracy of LOQ QC for P&A I was also within acceptance range of 
85-115 % and also inter-day (Global) % accuracy for LOQ QC samples were 103.8 %. Based on the results of 
entire method validation, it was concluded that there is no issue of accuracy and precision in this method. 
The applicant checked again the results obtained from recovery experiment. The mean recovery of drug and 
IS were 91.2% and 97.8% respectively and both were quite close to each other. The difference between drug 
and ISTD recovery was only around 6-7% which could be considered insignificant considering the fact that 
recovery was generated in biological matrix. The difference in recovery may be attributed to variations due to 
various factors such as complexity of biological matrix, extraction process, endogenous compounds, etc. Further 
the difference might also be attributed to the fact that the internal standard was externally added to the spiked 
QC samples. In addition to above, the applicant confirmed that the back calculated concentrations were 
Assessment report  
EMA/263015/2017 
Page 29/38 
 
  
  
 
calculated based on the peak area ratio of drug and ISTD area response. And if the generated concentrations are 
precise and accurate, the difference in recovery of drug and ISTD should not have any impact. In current case, 
the concentrations generated during the method validation study were precise and accurate, (which was 
reflected in data presented in two tables: Table no. 04 of method validation report # MV(I)-138-15 and Table no. 
03 of bio-analytical report of study #074-14). From the above data, it was confirmed that the minor difference 
in recovery of drug and ISTD (but consistence recoveries) had no impact on the study. This clarification was 
accepted by the CHMP. 
The applicant agreed that the retention time of drug and ISTD were similar i.e. 2.4 minutes. However, it was 
noted that during currently discussed study quantification of drug and ISTD were done using LC-MS/MS (mass 
spectrometric detector). The quantification in LC-MS/MS was purely done on the basis of m/z ratio (i.e. mass 
transitions), which differ from drug to drug (i.e. according to their molecular weight). In current study, Drug and 
ISTD MRM channels were separated based on their parent /daughter masses and hence chromatograms of Drug 
and ISTD were not possible to generate in one channel. Considering the quantification of drug and ISTD were 
done in different MRM channels (for drug : m / z 469.20 > 177.20 and for ISTD m / z 475.20 > 177.20), 
resolution of drug and ISTD peak were not applicable as both peaks were generated in separate channel. 
The CHMP agreed that the responses of the applicant were in accordance with the general widely known practice 
and thus are considered sufficient. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The choice of parameters, fed state and sample size for the bioequivalence demonstration were considered all 
acceptable. However, there were certain issues with the validation of the analytical report identified that created 
concerns and were discussed further. In addition a sequence effect was identified and the initial justification of 
the applicant was not considered sufficient. Therefore, despite the fact that the applicant presented that the two 
products, test and reference were shown to be bioequivalent, this was only considered acceptable after the 
issues related to the sequence effect were resolved. In order to be able to come to a conclusion the CHMP 
requested that the following concerns in the clinical part of the dossier have to be addressed: (1) submission of 
all validation chromatographs (both in-study and pre-study validation chromatographs) in addition to the 
clarifications requested in the analytical methods section AND (2) further discussion on the highly statistical 
significant sequence effect. 
The applicant provided additional clarification and submitted within his responses 100% of chromatograms of 
subjects as requested. The CHMP accepted the clarifications provided by the applicant.  
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Ivabradine Accord was provided and was accepted by 
the CHMP. This was in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional clinical studies were not considered 
necessary.

The bioequivalence study formed the pivotal basis with an  open  label,  balanced, randomized,  two  treatment,  
two  sequence,  two period, single oral dose, crossover design. The study design was considered adequate to 
evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. 
Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. 
Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. The test formulation of Ivabradine Accord met 
the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with the Procoralan. The point estimates and 
their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the 
protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was 
demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product was therefore concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, was of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Ivabradine Accord is favourable in the following indication: 
Symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris 
Ivabradine is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris in coronary artery 
disease adults with normal sinus rhythm and heart rate ≥ 70 bpm. Ivabradine is indicated: 
- in adults unable to tolerate or with a contra-indication to the use of beta-blockers 
- or in combination with beta-blockers in patients inadequately controlled with an optimal betablocker dose.

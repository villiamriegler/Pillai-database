CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
AVONEX is indicated in adults for the treatment of 
•
•
Patients diagnosed with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). In clinical trials, this was 
characterised by two or more acute exacerbations (relapses) in the previous three-years without 
evidence of continuous progression between relapses; AVONEX slows the progression of 
disability and decreases the frequency of relapses.
Patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if it is severe 
enough to warrant treatment with intravenous corticosteroids, if alternative diagnoses have been 
excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple 
sclerosis (see section 5.1).
AVONEX should be discontinued in patients who develop progressive MS.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the 
disease.
Posology
Adults: The recommended dosage for the treatment of relapsing MS is 30 micrograms (0.5 ml 
solution), administered by intramuscular (IM) injection once a week (see section 6.6). No additional 
benefit has been shown by administering a higher dose (60 micrograms) once a week.
Titration: To help patients reduce the incidence and severity of flu-like symptoms (see section 4.8), 
titration can be performed at the initiation of treatment. Titration using the pre-filled syringe can be 
2
achieved by initiating therapy on ¼ dose increments per week reaching the full dose (30 
micrograms/week) by the fourth week. 
An alternative titration schedule can be achieved by initiating therapy on approximately a ½ dose of 
AVONEX once a week before increasing to the full dose. In order to obtain adequate efficacy, a dose 
of 30 micrograms once a week should be reached and maintained after the initial titration period. 
The AVOSTARTCLIP titration kit is designed for use with the pre-filled syringe only. It can be used 
to achieve the ¼ or ½ dose increments. Each AVOSTARTCLIP should be used once and then 
discarded along with any remaining AVONEX in the syringe.
Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised 
to decrease flu-like symptoms associated with AVONEX administration. These symptoms are usually 
present during the first few months of treatment.
Paediatric population: 
The safety and efficacy of AVONEX in children and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years have not yet 
been fully established. Currently available data are described in section 4.8 and 5.1 but no 
recommendation on a posology can be made.
The safety and efficacy of AVONEX in children below 10 years of age have not yet been established. 
No data are available.
Elderly: Clinical studies did not include a sufficient number of patients aged 65 and over to determine 
whether they respond differently than younger patients. However, based on the mode of clearance of 
the active substance there are no theoretical reasons for any requirement for dose adjustments in the 
elderly.
Method of administration
The intramuscular injection site should be varied each week (see section 5.3).
Doctors may prescribe a 25 mm, 25 gauge needle to patients for whom such a needle is appropriate to 
administer an intramuscular injection.
At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Patients should be 
clinically evaluated after two years of treatment and longer-term treatment should be decided on an 
individual basis by the treating physician. Treatment should be discontinued if the patient develops 
chronic progressive MS.
4.3 Contraindications
-
-
Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any 
excipients listed in section 6.1.
Patients with current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
AVONEX should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive 
disorders, in particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and 
suicidal ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in 
3
association with interferon use. Patients should be advised to immediately report any symptoms of 
depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician.
Patients exhibiting depression should be monitored closely during therapy and treated appropriately. 
Cessation of therapy with AVONEX should be considered (see also sections 4.3 and 4.8).
AVONEX should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those 
receiving treatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with 
anti-epileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Caution should be used and close monitoring considered when administering AVONEX to patients 
with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression.
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA): Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have 
been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points during 
treatment and may occur several weeks to several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. 
Early clinical features include thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous 
system symptoms (e.g. confusion, paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings 
suggestive of TMA include decreased platelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
due to haemolysis and schistocytes (erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical 
features of TMA are observed, further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and 
renal function is recommended. If TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering 
plasma exchange) and immediate discontinuation of AVONEX is recommended. 
Nephrotic Syndrome: Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including 
collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), 
membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have 
been reported during treatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time 
points during treatment and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon beta. Periodic 
monitoring of early signs or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is 
recommended, especially in patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic 
syndrome is required and discontinuation of treatment with AVONEX should be considered.
Hepatic injury including elevated serum hepatic enzyme levels, hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and 
hepatic failure has been reported with interferon beta in post-marketing (see section 4.8). In some 
cases, these reactions have occurred in the presence of other medicinal products that have been 
associated with hepatic injury. The potential of additive effects from multiple medicinal products or 
other hepatotoxic agents (e.g. alcohol) has not been determined. Patients should be monitored for signs 
of hepatic injury and caution exercised when interferons are used concomitantly with other medicinal 
products associated with hepatic injury.
Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely 
monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during treatment with AVONEX. Flu-like 
symptoms associated with AVONEX therapy may prove stressful to patients with underlying cardiac 
conditions.
Laboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those 
laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with MS, complete and differential white 
blood cell counts, platelet counts, and blood chemistry, including liver function tests, are 
recommended during AVONEX therapy. Patients with myelosuppression may require more intensive 
monitoring of complete blood cell counts, with differential and platelet counts.
Patients may develop antibodies to AVONEX. The antibodies of some of those patients reduce the 
activity of interferon beta-1a in vitro (neutralising antibodies). Neutralising antibodies are associated 
with a reduction in the in vivo biological effects of AVONEX and may potentially be associated with a 
4
reduction of clinical efficacy. It is estimated that the plateau for the incidence of neutralising antibody 
formation is reached after 12 months of treatment. Recent clinical studies with patients treated up to 
three years with AVONEX suggest that approximately 5% to 8% develop neutralising antibodies.
The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies to interferons limits the ability to compare 
antigenicity among different products.
In post marketing experience, cases of injection site necrosis have been reported (see section 4.8). 
To minimise the risk of injection site reactions, patients should be advised to use an aseptic injection 
technique and rotate the injection sites with each dose.
The procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if 
injection site reactions have occurred. If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be 
accompanied by swelling or drainage of fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to 
speak with their doctor. Whether to discontinue therapy following a single site of necrosis is 
dependent on the extent of necrosis. For patients who continue therapy with AVONEX after injection 
site necrosis has occurred, avoid administration of AVONEX into the affected area until it is fully 
healed. If multiple lesions occur, change injection site, or discontinue therapy until healing occurs.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No formal interaction studies have been performed in humans.
The interaction of AVONEX with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not 
been studied systematically. The clinical studies indicate that MS patients can receive AVONEX and 
corticosteroids or ACTH during relapses.
Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes 
in humans and animals. The effect of high-dose AVONEX administration on P450-dependent 
metabolism in monkeys was evaluated and no changes in liver metabolising capabilities were 
observed. Caution should be exercised when AVONEX is administered in combination with medicinal 
products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome 
P450 system for clearance, e.g. some classes of antiepileptics and antidepressants.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
A large amount of data (more than 1000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing 
experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to 
interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of 
exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use 
was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when pregnancy was detected 
and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very limited. 
Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion.  
The risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be 
evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far.
If clinically needed, the use of Avonex may be considered during pregnancy.
Breast-feeding 
Limited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the 
chemical / physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a 
5
excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are 
anticipated. 
Avonex can be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility
Fertility and developmental studies in rhesus monkeys have been carried out with a related form of 
interferon beta 1a. At very high doses, anovulatory and abortifacient effects in test animals were 
observed (see section 5.3). 
No information is available on the effects of interferon beta-1a on male fertility.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects of AVONEX on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 
Central nervous system-related adverse reactions may have a minor influence on the ability to drive 
and use machines in susceptible patients (see section 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with AVONEX therapy is related to flu-like 
symptoms. The most commonly reported flu-like symptoms are myalgia, fever, chills, sweating, 
asthenia, headache and nausea. Titrating AVONEX at the initiation of therapy has demonstrated a 
reduction in the severity and incidence of flu-like symptoms. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most 
prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency with continued treatment.
Transient neurological symptoms that may mimic MS exacerbations may occur following injections. 
Transient episodes of hypertonia and/or severe muscular weakness that prevent voluntary movements 
may occur at any time during treatment. These episodes are of limited duration, temporally related to 
the injections and may recur after subsequent injections. In some cases these symptoms are associated 
with flu-like symptoms.
The frequencies of adverse reactions are expressed in patient-years, according to the following 
categories:
Very common (≥1/10 patient-years);
Common (≥1/100 to <1/10 patient-years);
Uncommon (≥1/1, 000 to <1/100 patient-years);
Rare (≥1/10, 000 to <1/1,000 patient-years);
Very rare (<1/10,000 patient-years);
Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Patient-time is the sum of individual units of time that the patient in the study has been exposed to 
AVONEX before experiencing the adverse reaction. For example, 100 person-years could be observed 
in 100 patients who were on treatment for one year or in 200 patients who were on treatment for half a 
year.
Adverse reactions identified from studies (clinical trials and observational studies, with a period of 
follow-up ranging from two years to six years) and other adverse reactions identified through 
spontaneous reporting from the market, with unknown frequency, are provided in the table below.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

1Injection site reactions including pain, inflammation and very rare cases of abscess or cellulitis that 
may require surgical intervention have been reported.
2The frequency of occurrence is higher at the beginning of treatment.
3A syncope episode may occur after AVONEX injection, it is normally a single episode that usually 
appears at the beginning of the treatment and does not recur with subsequent injections.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension
Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. 
Events were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with 
interferon beta.
Paediatric population
9
Limited data from literature, clinical trials and postmarketing experience suggest that the safety profile 
in children and adolescents from 10 to less than18 years of age receiving AVONEX 30 micrograms 
IM once per week is consistent with that seen in adults. 
The safety information obtained from the use of AVONEX as an active comparator in a 96 week open 
label, randomised trial in paediatric patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis aged 10 to less 
than 18 years (with only 10% of the overall study population < 13 years) shows that in the AVONEX 
group (n=72), the following adverse events which are common in adult population were reported as 
very common in paediatric population: myalgia, pain in extremity, fatigue, and arthralgia. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported. However, in case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised 
for observation and appropriate supportive treatment given.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Interferons, ATC code: L03 AB07.
Interferons are a family of naturally occurring proteins that are produced by eukaryotic cells in 
response to viral infection and other biological inducers. Interferons are cytokines that mediate 
antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory activities. Three major forms of interferons have 
been distinguished: alpha, beta, and gamma. Interferons alpha and beta are classified as Type I 
interferons, and interferon gamma is a Type II interferon. These interferons have overlapping but 
clearly distinguishable biological activities. They can also differ with respect to their cellular sites of 
synthesis.
Interferon beta is produced by various cell types including fibroblasts and macrophages. Natural 
interferon beta and AVONEX (interferon beta-1a) are glycosylated and have a single N-linked 
complex carbohydrate moiety. Glycosylation of other proteins is known to affect their stability, 
activity, biodistribution, and half-life in blood. However, the effects of interferon beta that are 
dependent on glycosylation are not fully defined.
Mechanism of action
AVONEX exerts its biological effects by binding to specific receptors on the surface of human cells. 
This binding initiates a complex cascade of intracellular events that leads to the expression of 
numerous interferon-induced gene products and markers. These include MHC Class I, Mx protein, 
2’ / 5’-oligoadenylate synthetase, 2-microglobulin, and neopterin. Some of these products have been 
measured in the serum and cellular fractions of blood collected from patients treated with AVONEX. 
After a single intramuscular dose of AVONEX, serum levels of these products remain elevated for at 
least four days and up to one week.
10
Whether the mechanism of action of AVONEX in MS is mediated by the same pathway as the 
biological effects described above is not known because the pathophysiology of MS is not well 
established.
Clinical efficacy and safety
The effects of lyophilised AVONEX in the treatment of MS were demonstrated in a 
placebo-controlled study of 301 patients (AVONEX n=158, placebo n=143) with relapsing MS 
characterised by at least 2 exacerbations in the previous 3 years or at least one exacerbation per year 
prior to entry when the duration of the disease was less than 3 years. Patients with an EDSS of 1.0 to 
3.5 at entry were included in the clinical trial. Due to the design of the study, patients were followed 
for variable lengths of time. 150 AVONEX-treated patients completed one year on study and 85 
completed two years on study. In the study, the cumulative percentage of patients who developed 
disability progression (by KaplanMeier life table analysis) by the end of two years was 35% for 
placebo-treated patients and 22% for AVONEX-treated patients. Disability progression was measured 
as an increase in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 1.0 point, sustained for at least six 
months. It was also shown that there was a one-third reduction in annual relapse rate. This latter 
clinical effect was observed after more than one year of treatment.
A double-blind randomised dose comparison study of 802 relapsing MS patients (AVONEX 
30 micrograms n=402, AVONEX 60 micrograms n=400) has shown no statistically significant 
differences or trends between the 30 micrograms and the 60 micrograms doses of AVONEX in 
clinical and general MRI parameters.
The effects of AVONEX in the treatment of MS were also demonstrated in a randomised double-blind 
study performed with 383 patients (AVONEX n=193, placebo n=190) with a single demyelinating 
event associated with at least two compatible brain MRI lesions. A reduction of the risk of 
experiencing a second event was noted in the AVONEX treatment group. An effect on MRI 
parameters was also seen. The estimated risk of a second event was 50% in three years and 39% in 
two years in the placebo group and 35% (three years) and 21% (two years) in the AVONEX group. In 
a post-hoc analysis, those patients with a baseline MRI with at least one Gd-enhancing lesion and nine 
T2 lesions had a two-year risk of suffering a second event of 56% in the placebo group and 21% in the 
AVONEX treatment group. However, the impact of early treatment with AVONEX is unknown even 
in this high-risk subgroup as the study was mainly designed to assess the time to the second event 
rather than the long-term evolution of the disease. Furthermore, for the time-being there is no well 
established definition of a high risk patient although a more conservative approach is to accept at least 
nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing 
lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least three months after the initial scan. In any case, treatment 
should only be considered for patients classified at high risk.
Paediatric population
Limited data of the efficacy/safety of AVONEX 15 micrograms IM once per week (n=8) as compared 
to no treatment (n=8) with follow up for 4 years showed results in line to those seen in adults, although 
the EDSS scores increased in the treated group over the 4 year follow-up thus indicating disease 
progression. No direct comparison with the dose currently recommended in adults is available.
AVONEX 30 micrograms/0.5 ml solution for injection was studied as an active comparator in 2 
controlled clinical trials in paediatric patients aged 10 to less than 18 years with relapsing remitting 
multiple sclerosis (see section 4.2). 
In an open-label randomised active controlled trial, 150 participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 
ratio to treatment with dimethyl fumarate, administered orally at a dose of 240 mg twice a day, or 
AVONEX, administered at a dose of 30 μg once weekly by intramuscular (IM) injection, for 96 
weeks. 
11
In the ITT population, treatment with dimethyl fumarate resulted in a higher proportion of patients 
with no new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions at Week 96 relative to baseline as compared 
with AVONEX [12.8% versus 2.8% respectively].
In a double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled study, 215 participants were randomly assigned to 
receive either oral fingolimod (0.5 mg once daily or 0.25 mg once daily for patients weighing ≤40 kg) 
or AVONEX 30 μg IM once weekly for up to 24 months.
The primary endpoint, the adjusted annualized relapse rate (ARR) at week 96, was significantly lower 
in patients treated with fingolimod (0.122) compared to patients who received AVONEX (0.675), 
translating into an 81.9% relative reduction in ARR (p <0.001).
Overall, the safety profile in patients receiving AVONEX in the two clinical trials was qualitatively 
consistent with that previously observed in adult patients.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetic profile of AVONEX has been investigated indirectly with an assay that measures 
interferon antiviral activity. This assay is limited in that it is sensitive for interferon but lacks 
specificity for interferon beta. Alternative assay techniques are not sufficiently sensitive.
Following intramuscular administration of AVONEX, serum antiviral activity levels peak between 5 
and 15 hours post-dose and decline with a half-life of approximately 10 hours. With appropriate 
adjustment for the rate of absorption from the injection site, the calculated bioavailability is 
approximately 40%. The calculated bioavailability is greater without such adjustments. Subcutaneous 
administration cannot be substituted for intramuscular administration.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Carcinogenesis: No carcinogenicity data for interferon beta-1a are available in animals or humans.
Chronic Toxicity: In a 26-week repeated dose toxicity study in rhesus monkeys by intramuscular route 
once per week, administered in combination with another immunomodulating agent, an anti CD40 
ligand monoclonal antibody, no immune response toward interferon beta-1a and no signs of toxicity 
were demonstrated.
Local Tolerance: Intramuscular irritation has not been evaluated in animals following repeated 
administration to the same injection site.
Mutagenesis: Limited but relevant mutagenesis tests have been carried out. The results have been 
negative.
Impairment of Fertility: Fertility and developmental studies in rhesus monkeys have been carried out 
with a related form of interferon beta-1a. At very high doses, anovulatory and abortifacient effects in 
test animals were observed. Similar reproductive dose-related effects have also been observed with 
other forms of alpha and beta interferons. No teratogenic effects or effects on foetal development have 
been observed, but the available information on the effects of interferon beta-1a in the peri- and 
postnatal periods is limited.
No information is available on the effects of interferon beta-1a on male fertility.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
AVONEX is indicated in adults for the treatment of 
•
•
Patients diagnosed with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). In clinical trials, this was 
characterised by two or more acute exacerbations (relapses) in the previous three-years without 
evidence of continuous progression between relapses; AVONEX slows the progression of 
disability and decreases the frequency of relapses.
Patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if it is severe 
enough to warrant treatment with intravenous corticosteroids, if alternative diagnoses have been 
excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple 
sclerosis (see section 5.1).
AVONEX should be discontinued in patients who develop progressive MS.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the 
disease.
Posology
Adults: The recommended dosage for the treatment of relapsing MS is 30 micrograms (0.5 ml 
solution), administered by intramuscular (IM) injection once a week (see section 6.6).  No additional 
benefit has been shown by administering a higher dose (60 micrograms) once a week.
15
Titration: To help patients reduce the incidence and severity of flu-like symptoms (see section 4.8), 
titration can be performed at the initiation of treatment. Titration using the pre-filled syringe can be 
achieved by initiating therapy on ¼ dose increments per week reaching the full dose (30 
micrograms/week) by the fourth week. 
An alternative titration schedule can be achieved by initiating therapy on approximately a ½ dose of 
AVONEX once a week before increasing to the full dose. In order to obtain adequate efficacy, a dose 
of 30 micrograms  once a week should be reached and maintained after the initial titration period. 
Once a full dose is achieved patients may begin using AVONEX PEN.  
Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised 
to decrease flu-like symptoms associated with AVONEX administration. These symptoms are usually 
present during the first few months of treatment.
Paediatric population: 
The safety and efficacy of AVONEX in children and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years have not yet 
been fully established. Currently available data are described in section 4.8 and 5.1 but no 
recommendation on a posology can be made.
The safety and efficacy of AVONEX in children below 10 years of age have not yet been established. 
No data are available.
Elderly: Clinical studies did not include a sufficient number of patients aged 65 and over to determine 
whether they respond differently than younger patients. However, based on the mode of clearance of 
the active substance there are no theoretical reasons for any requirement for dose adjustments in the 
elderly.
Method of administration
At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Patients should be 
clinically evaluated after two years of treatment and longer-term treatment should be decided on an 
individual basis by the treating physician. Treatment should be discontinued if the patient develops 
chronic progressive MS.
AVONEX PEN is a pre-filled pen, intended for single use, and should only be used following 
adequate training.
The recommended intramuscular injection site using the AVONEX PEN is the upper, outer thigh 
muscle. The injection site should be varied each week.
For administration of AVONEX via the AVONEX PEN, the instructions in the package leaflet should 
be followed.
4.3 Contraindications
-
-
Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any 
excipients listed in section 6.1.
Patients with current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
16
AVONEX should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive 
disorders, in particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and 
suicidal ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in 
association with interferon use. Patients should be advised to immediately report any symptoms of 
depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician.
Patients exhibiting depression should be monitored closely during therapy and treated appropriately. 
Cessation of therapy with AVONEX should be considered (see also sections 4.3 and 4.8).
AVONEX should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those 
receiving treatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with 
anti-epileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Caution should be used and close monitoring considered when administering AVONEX to patients 
with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression.
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA): Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have 
been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points during 
treatment and may occur several weeks to several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. 
Early clinical features include thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous 
system symptoms (e.g. confusion, paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings 
suggestive of TMA include decreased platelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
due to haemolysis and schistocytes (erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical 
features of TMA are observed, further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and 
renal function is recommended. If TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering 
plasma exchange) and immediate discontinuation of AVONEX is recommended. 
Nephrotic Syndrome: Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including 
collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), 
membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have 
been reported during treatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time 
points during treatment and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon beta. Periodic 
monitoring of early signs or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is 
recommended, especially in patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic 
syndrome is required and discontinuation of treatment with AVONEX should be considered.
Hepatic injury including elevated serum hepatic enzyme levels, hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and 
hepatic failure has been reported with interferon beta in post-marketing (see section 4.8). In some 
cases, these reactions have occurred in the presence of other medicinal products that have been 
associated with hepatic injury. The potential of additive effects from multiple medicinal products or 
other hepatotoxic agents (e.g. alcohol) has not been determined. Patients should be monitored for signs 
of hepatic injury and caution exercised when interferons are used concomitantly with other medicinal 
products associated with hepatic injury.
Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely 
monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during treatment with AVONEX. Flu-like 
symptoms associated with AVONEX therapy may prove stressful to patients with underlying cardiac 
conditions.
Laboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those 
laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with MS, complete and differential white 
blood cell counts, platelet counts, and blood chemistry, including liver function tests, are 
recommended during AVONEX therapy. Patients with myelosuppression may require more intensive 
monitoring of complete blood cell counts, with differential and platelet counts.
17
Patients may develop antibodies to AVONEX. The antibodies of some of those patients reduce the 
activity of interferon beta-1a in vitro (neutralising antibodies). Neutralising antibodies are associated 
with a reduction in the in vivo biological effects of AVONEX and may potentially be associated with a 
reduction of clinical efficacy. It is estimated that the plateau for the incidence of neutralising antibody 
formation is reached after 12 months of treatment. Recent clinical studies with patients treated up to 
three years with AVONEX suggest that approximately 5% to 8% develop neutralising antibodies.
The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies to interferons limits the ability to compare 
antigenicity among different products.
In post marketing experience, cases of injection site necrosis have been reported (see section 4.8). 
To minimise the risk of injection site reactions, patients should be advised to use an aseptic injection 
technique and rotate the injection sites with each dose.
The procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if 
injection site reactions have occurred. If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be 
accompanied by swelling or drainage of fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to 
speak with their doctor. Whether to discontinue therapy following a single site of necrosis is 
dependent on the extent of necrosis. For patients who continue therapy with AVONEX after injection 
site necrosis has occurred, avoid administration of AVONEX into the affected area until it is fully 
healed. If multiple lesions occur, change injection site, or discontinue therapy until healing occurs.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No formal interaction studies have been performed in humans.
The interaction of AVONEX with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not 
been studied systematically. The clinical studies indicate that MS patients can receive AVONEX and 
corticosteroids or ACTH during relapses.
Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes 
in humans and animals. The effect of high-dose AVONEX administration on P450-dependent 
metabolism in monkeys was evaluated and no changes in liver metabolising capabilities were 
observed. Caution should be exercised when AVONEX is administered in combination with medicinal 
products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome 
P450 system for clearance, e.g. some classes of antiepileptics and antidepressants.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
A large amount of data (more than 1000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing 
experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to 
interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of 
exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use 
was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when pregnancy was detected 
and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very limited. 
Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion.  
The risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be 
evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far.
If clinically needed, the use of Avonex may be considered during pregnancy.
18
Breast-feeding 
Limited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the 
chemical / physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a 
excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are 
anticipated. 
Avonex can be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility
Fertility and developmental studies in rhesus monkeys have been carried out with a related form of 
interferon beta-1a. At very high doses, anovulatory and abortifacient effects in test animals were 
observed (see section 5.3). 
No information is available on the effects of interferon beta-1a on male fertility.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects of AVONEX on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 
Central nervous system-related adverse reactions may have a minor influence on the ability to drive 
and use machines in susceptible patients (see section 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with AVONEX therapy is related to flu-like 
symptoms. The most commonly reported flu-like symptoms are myalgia, fever, chills, sweating, 
asthenia, headache and nausea. Titrating AVONEX at the initiation of therapy has demonstrated a 
reduction in the severity and incidence of flu-like symptoms. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most 
prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency with continued treatment.
Transient neurological symptoms that may mimic MS exacerbations may occur following injections. 
Transient episodes of hypertonia and/or severe muscular weakness that prevent voluntary movements 
may occur at any time during treatment. These episodes are of limited duration, temporally related to 
the injections and may recur after subsequent injections. In some cases these symptoms are associated 
with flu-like symptoms.
The frequencies of adverse reactions are expressed in patient-years, according to the following 
categories:
Very common (≥1/10 patient-years);
Common (≥1/100 to <1/10 patient-years);
Uncommon (≥1/1, 000 to <1/100 patient-years);
Rare (≥1/10, 000 to <1/1,000 patient-years);
Very rare (<1/10,000 patient-years);
Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Patient-time is the sum of individual units of time that the patient in the study has been exposed to 
AVONEX before experiencing the adverse reaction. For example, 100 person-years could be observed 
in 100 patients who were on treatment for one year or in 200 patients who were on treatment for half a 
year.
Adverse reactions identified from studies (clinical trials and observational studies, with a period of 
follow-up ranging from two years to six years) and other adverse reactions identified through 
spontaneous reporting from the market, with unknown frequency, are provided in the table below.
19
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

*Class label for interferon beta products (see section 4.4).
┼ Class label for interferon products, see below Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
1Injection site reactions including pain, inflammation and very rare cases of abscess or cellulitis that 
may require surgical intervention have been reported.
2The frequency of occurrence is higher at the beginning of treatment.
3A syncope episode may occur after AVONEX injection, it is normally a single episode that usually 
appears at the beginning of the treatment and does not recur with subsequent injections.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension
Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. 
Events were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with 
interferon beta.
Paediatric population
22
Limited data from literature, clinical trials and postmarketing experience suggest that the safety profile 
in children and adolescents from 10 to less than18 years of age receiving AVONEX 30 micrograms 
IM once per week is consistent with that seen in adults.
The safety information obtained from the use of AVONEX as an active comparator arm in a 96 week 
open label, randomised trial in paediatric patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis aged 10 
to less than 18 years (with only 10% of the overall study population < 13 years) shows that in the 
AVONEX group (n=72), the following adverse events which are common in adult population were 
reported as very common in paediatric population: myalgia, pain in extremity, fatigue, and arthralgia. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported. However, in case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised 
for observation and appropriate supportive treatment given.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Interferons, ATC code: L03 AB07.
Interferons are a family of naturally occurring proteins that are produced by eukaryotic cells in 
response to viral infection and other biological inducers. Interferons are cytokines that mediate 
antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory activities. Three major forms of interferons have 
been distinguished: alpha, beta, and gamma. Interferons alpha and beta are classified as Type I 
interferons, and interferon gamma is a Type II interferon. These interferons have overlapping but 
clearly distinguishable biological activities. They can also differ with respect to their cellular sites of 
synthesis.
Interferon beta is produced by various cell types including fibroblasts and macrophages. Natural 
interferon beta and AVONEX (interferon beta-1a) are glycosylated and have a single N-linked 
complex carbohydrate moiety. Glycosylation of other proteins is known to affect their stability, 
activity, biodistribution, and half-life in blood. However, the effects of interferon beta that are 
dependent on glycosylation are not fully defined.
Mechanism of action
AVONEX exerts its biological effects by binding to specific receptors on the surface of human cells. 
This binding initiates a complex cascade of intracellular events that leads to the expression of 
numerous interferon-induced gene products and markers. These include MHC Class I, Mx protein, 
2’ / 5’-oligoadenylate synthetase, 2-microglobulin, and neopterin. Some of these products have been 
measured in the serum and cellular fractions of blood collected from patients treated with AVONEX. 
After a single intramuscular dose of AVONEX, serum levels of these products remain elevated for at 
least four days and up to one week.
23
Whether the mechanism of action of AVONEX in MS is mediated by the same pathway as the 
biological effects described above is not known because the pathophysiology of MS is not well 
established.
Clinical efficacy and safety
The effects of lyophilised AVONEX in the treatment of MS were demonstrated in a 
placebo-controlled study of 301 patients (AVONEX n=158, placebo n=143) with relapsing MS 
characterised by at least 2 exacerbations in the previous 3 years or at least one exacerbation per year 
prior to entry when the duration of the disease was less than 3 years. Patients with an EDSS of 1.0 to 
3.5 at entry were included in the clinical trial. Due to the design of the study, patients were followed 
for variable lengths of time. 150 AVONEX-treated patients completed one year on study and 85 
completed two years on study. In the study, the cumulative percentage of patients who developed 
disability progression (by Kaplan-Meier life table analysis) by the end of two years was 35% for 
placebo-treated patients and 22% for AVONEX-treated patients. Disability progression was measured 
as an increase in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 1.0 point, sustained for at least six 
months. It was also shown that there was a one-third reduction in annual relapse rate. This latter 
clinical effect was observed after more than one year of treatment.
A double-blind randomised dose comparison study of 802 relapsing MS patients (AVONEX 
30 micrograms n=402, AVONEX 60 micrograms n=400) has shown no statistically significant 
differences or trends between the 30 micrograms and the 60 micrograms doses of AVONEX in 
clinical and general MRI parameters.
The effects of AVONEX in the treatment of MS were also demonstrated in a randomised double-blind 
study performed with 383 patients (AVONEX n=193, placebo n=190) with a single demyelinating 
event associated with at least two compatible brain MRI lesions. A reduction of the risk of 
experiencing a second event was noted in the AVONEX treatment group. An effect on MRI 
parameters was also seen. The estimated risk of a second event was 50% in three years and 39% in 
two years in the placebo group and 35% (three years) and 21% (two years) in the AVONEX group. In 
a post-hoc analysis, those patients with a baseline MRI with at least one Gd-enhancing lesion and nine 
T2 lesions had a two-year risk of suffering a second event of 56% in the placebo group and 21% in the 
AVONEX treatment group. However, the impact of early treatment with AVONEX is unknown even 
in this high-risk subgroup as the study was mainly designed to assess the time to the second event 
rather than the long-term evolution of the disease. Furthermore, for the time-being there is no well 
established definition of a high risk patient although a more conservative approach is to accept at least 
nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing 
lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least three months after the initial scan. In any case, treatment 
should only be considered for patients classified at high risk.
Paediatric population
Limited data of the efficacy/safety of AVONEX 15 micrograms IM once per week (n=8) as compared 
to no treatment (n=8) with follow up for 4 years showed results in line to those seen in adults, although 
the EDSS scores increased in the treated group over the 4 year follow-up thus indicating disease 
progression. No direct comparison with the dose currently recommended in adults is available.
AVONEX 30 micrograms/0.5 ml solution for injection was studied as an active comparator in 2 
controlled clinical trials in paediatric patients aged 10 to less than 18 years with relapsing remitting 
multiple sclerosis (see section 4.2). 
In an open-label randomised active controlled trial, 150 participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 
ratio to treatment with dimethyl fumarate, administered orally at a dose of 240 mg twice a day, or 
AVONEX, administered at a dose of 30 μg once weekly by intramuscular (IM) injection for 96 weeks. 
24
In the ITT population, treatment with dimethyl fumarate resulted in a higher proportion of patients 
with no new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions at Week 96 relative to baseline as compared 
with AVONEX [12.8% versus 2.8% respectively]. 
In a double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled study, 215 participants were randomly assigned to 
receive either oral fingolimod (0.5 mg once daily or 0.25 mg once daily for patients weighing ≤40 kg) 
or AVONEX 30 μg IM once weekly for up to 24 months. 
The primary endpoint, the adjusted annualized relapse rate (ARR) at week 96, was significantly lower 
in patients treated with fingolimod (0.122) compared to patients who received AVONEX (0.675), 
translating into an 81.9% relative reduction in ARR (p <0.001).
Overall, the safety profile in patients receiving AVONEX in the two clinical trials was qualitatively 
consistent with that previously observed in adult patients.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetic profile of AVONEX has been investigated indirectly with an assay that measures 
interferon antiviral activity. This assay is limited in that it is sensitive for interferon but lacks 
specificity for interferon beta. Alternative assay techniques are not sufficiently sensitive.
Following intramuscular administration of AVONEX, serum antiviral activity levels peak between 5 
and 15 hours post-dose and decline with a half-life of approximately 10 hours. With appropriate 
adjustment for the rate of absorption from the injection site, the calculated bioavailability is 
approximately 40%. The calculated bioavailability is greater without such adjustments. Subcutaneous 
administration cannot be substituted for intramuscular administration.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Carcinogenesis: No carcinogenicity data for interferon beta-1a are available in animals or humans.
Chronic Toxicity: In a 26-week repeated dose toxicity study in rhesus monkeys by intramuscular route 
once per week, administered in combination with another immunomodulating agent, an anti CD40 
ligand monoclonal antibody, no immune response toward interferon beta-1a and no signs of toxicity 
were demonstrated.
Local Tolerance: Intramuscular irritation has not been evaluated in animals following repeated 
administration to the same injection site.
Mutagenesis: Limited but relevant mutagenesis tests have been carried out. The results have been 
negative.
Impairment of Fertility: Fertility and developmental studies in rhesus monkeys have been carried out 
with a related form of interferon beta-1a. At very high doses, anovulatory and abortifacient effects in 
test animals were observed. Similar reproductive dose-related effects have also been observed with 
other forms of alpha and beta interferons. No teratogenic effects or effects on foetal development have 
been observed, but the available information on the effects of interferon beta-1a in the peri- and 
postnatal periods is limited.
No information is available on the effects of interferon beta-1a on male fertility.

How to inject AVONEX
1 What AVONEX is and what it is used for
What AVONEX is
The active substance in Avonex is a protein called interferon beta-1a. Interferons are natural 
substances made in your body to help protect you from infections and diseases. The protein in Avonex 
is made up of exactly the same ingredients as interferon beta that is found in the human body. 
What AVONEX is used for
Avonex is used to treat Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Treatment with Avonex can help to prevent you 
from getting worse, although it will not cure MS.
Everyone has their own set of MS symptoms. These can include:
-
Feeling off-balance or light headed, walking problems, stiffness and muscle spasms, tiredness, 
numbness in the face, arms or legs
Acute or chronic pain, bladder and bowel problems, sexual problems and problems seeing 
things
Difficulty in thinking and concentrating, depression.
-
MS also tends to flare up from time to time: this is called a relapse.
-
44
(Notes information)
Avonex works best when you use it:
-
-
-
Do not stop your Avonex treatment without speaking to your doctor.
at the same time 
once a week 
on a regular basis
Avonex can help to reduce the number of relapses that you have and slow down the disabling 
effects of MS. Your doctor will advise you for how long you can use Avonex or when to stop.
How AVONEX works
Multiple sclerosis is linked to nerve (brain or spinal cord) damage. In MS, your body’s defence system 
reacts against its own myelin – the ‘insulation’ that surrounds nerve fibres. When myelin is damaged, 
the messages between the brain and other parts of the body are disrupted. This is what causes the 
symptoms of MS. Avonex seems to work by stopping your body’s defence system from attacking the 
myelin.
2. What you need to know before you use AVONEX
Do not use AVONEX
-
-
If you are allergic to interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6)
If you have severe depression or think about committing suicide.
Talk to a doctor straight away if any of these apply to you.
(Notes information)
Avonex and allergic reactions. Because Avonex is based on a protein, there is a small chance of an 
allergic reaction.
More about depression. If you have severe depression or thoughts about suicide, you must not use 
Avonex.
If you have depression, your doctor may still prescribe Avonex for you, but it's important to let your 
doctor know if you have had depression or any similar problems affecting your moods.
Warnings and precautions 
Depression or problems affecting your moods
Thoughts about committing suicide.
Talk to your doctor before using Avonex if you have or have had in the past:
-
-
Changes to your mood, thoughts about suicide, feeling unusually sad, anxious or worthless, should be 
reported to your doctor immediately.
-
-
-
Epilepsy or other seizure disorders not controlled by medication
Serious kidney or liver problems
A low number of white blood cells or platelets, which can cause an increased risk of 
infection, bleeding or anaemia
45
-
-
Heart problems, which can cause symptoms such as chest pain (angina), particularly after any 
activity; swollen ankles, shortness of breath (congestive heart failure); or an irregular heartbeat 
(arrhythmias).
Irritation at an injection site, which can lead to skin and tissue damage (injection site necrosis). 
When you are ready to inject, carefully follow the instructions in section 7 “How to inject 
AVONEX”, at the end of this leaflet. This is to reduce the risk of injection site reactions.
Talk to your doctor if you have any of these conditions, or if they worsen whilst taking Avonex.
Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could affect 
your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Avonex. 
Your doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your 
kidneys.
Tell your doctor you are using Avonex:
-
If you are having a blood test. Avonex may interfere with the results.
(Notes information)
Sometimes you will need to remind other medical staff that you are being treated with Avonex. 
For example, if you are prescribed other medicines, or if you have a blood test, Avonex may affect the 
other medicines or the test result.
Paediatric population
Avonex is not recommended for use in children and adolescents because there is limited data on the 
use of Avonex in this population. Avonex should not be used in children below 10 years of age 
because it is yet to be established whether it would work for them and whether it would be safe.
Other medicines and AVONEX
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, especially 
those used to treat epilepsy or depression. Avonex may affect other medicines or be affected by them. 
This includes any other medicines including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Avonex can be used during breast-
feeding.
Driving and using machines
If you feel dizzy, do not drive. Avonex makes some people feel dizzy. If this happens to you, or if 
you get any other side effects that could affect your ability, do not drive or use machines.
Important information about some of the ingredients of AVONEX
This medicine is essentially ‘sodium-free’. It contains less than 23 mg (1 mmol) sodium in each 
weekly dose.
46
3.
How to use AVONEX
The recommended weekly dose 
One injection of Avonex, once a week.
Try to use Avonex at the same time on the same day each week.
If you have decided to start treatment with Avonex, your doctor may provide you with an Avostartclip 
titration kit. The Avostartclip attaches to the syringe and enables you to gradually increase your dose 
of Avonex when you first start treatment. This is to limit flu-like symptoms which some people 
experience when they start using Avonex. Your doctor or nurse will help you use the Avostartclip 
titration kit. 
(Notes information)
Starting Avonex
If you are new to Avonex, your doctor may advise you to gradually increase your dose so that you 
can adjust to the effects of Avonex before taking the full dose. You will be provided with an 
Avostartclip titration kit. Avostartclips can be attached onto the syringe enabling a reduced dose of 
Avonex to be injected at the start of treatment. Each Avostartclip should be used once and then 
discarded along with any remaining Avonex. For further details on use, speak with your doctor.   
Injecting yourself
You can inject Avonex yourself without the help of your doctor, if they have trained you to do this. 
The instructions on how to inject yourself are at the end of this leaflet (see section 7, How to inject 
AVONEX).
If you have trouble handling the syringe, ask your doctor who may be able to help.
(Notes information)
There are more details on how to inject Avonex at the end of this leaflet.
Alternate needle:
Your pack of Avonex already includes a needle for injection. It may be possible for your doctor to 
prescribe you a shorter and thinner needle, depending on your body type. Talk to your doctor to see if 
this is appropriate for you.
If you have problems handling the syringe, talk to your doctor about using a syringe grip. This is a 
specially designed holder to help you with injecting Avonex.
How long to use AVONEX
Your doctor will tell you how long you need to keep using Avonex. It is important to continue using 
Avonex regularly. Do not make changes unless your doctor tells you.
If you inject more than you should
You should only have one injection of Avonex, once a week. If you have used more than one injection 
of Avonex in a three-day period, contact your doctor or pharmacist straight away for advice.
47
If you miss an injection
If you miss your usual weekly dose, inject a dose as soon as you can. Then leave a week before using 
Avonex again. Continue injecting on this new day every week. If you have a preferred day for using 
Avonex, talk to your doctor about managing the dose, to get back to your preferred day. Do not use 
two injections to make up for a missed injection.

Effects of the injection
-
Feeling faint: Your first injection of Avonex may be given by your doctor. It may make you 
feel faint. You may even actually faint. This is unlikely to happen again.
Just after an injection, your muscles may feel tense or very weak – as though you are having 
a relapse. This is rare. It only happens when you inject and the effects soon pass. They may 
happen any time after starting on Avonex.
If you notice any irritation or skin problems after an injection, talk to your doctor.
-
-
Flu-like symptoms
(Notes information)
Three simple ways to help reduce the impact of flu-like symptoms:
1. Use your Avonex injection just before bedtime. This may allow you to sleep through the 
effects.
2. Take paracetamol or ibuprofen half an hour before your Avonex injection and continue 
taking it for up to a day. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist about a suitable dose.
If you have a fever, drink plenty of water to keep you hydrated.
3.
Some people find that after injecting Avonex, they feel like they have flu. Signs are:
-
-
-
Headache
Muscle aches
Chills or a fever.
These symptoms are not really flu
You can’t pass it on to anyone else. They are more common when you first start using Avonex. Your 
doctor may provide you with an Avostartclip titration kit which enables you to gradually increase your 
dose at the start of treatment to help limit flu-like symptoms. As you keep using your injections, the 
flu-like symptoms gradually decrease.
Children (10 years of age and above) and adolescents
In clinical trials, some side effects were reported more frequently in children and adolescents than in 
adults, e.g., muscle pain, pain in extremity, fatigue, and joint pain.
Reporting of side effects
50
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine.
In order to improve the traceability of this medicine, your doctor or pharmacist should record the name 
and the lot number of the product you have been given in your patient file. You may also wish to make 
a note of these details in case you are asked for this information in the future.

How to inject AVONEX
You should have had training in how to inject Avonex 
These notes are a reminder. If there’s anything you’re not sure about, check with your doctor or 
pharmacist.
Where to inject
•
•
•
Avonex is injected into a muscle, for example, the upper thigh muscle. Injection of Avonex 
into the buttocks is not recommended.
Use a different injection site each week. This means less risk of irritation to your skin and 
muscle.
Do not use any area of skin that is bruised, sore, or infected, or if there is an open wound.
53
A. Getting Ready
1.
2.
Remove one sealed plastic tray from the refrigerator
-
-
Check the expiry date on the lid of the tray. Do not use it if it is out-of-date.
Peel back the paper lid completely. Check the blister tray contains one pre-filled syringe 
and one injection needle (see picture “Contents of the plastic tray”).
Leave the syringe to warm up
-
Leave it at room temperature for half an hour. This makes the injection more 
comfortable than injecting straight from a refrigerator. 
Tip: Do not use external heat sources such as hot water to warm the syringe.
3. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry them.
4.
Prepare alcohol wipes and sticking plasters (not supplied) if you need them. 
Find a clean, hard surface to lay out the items needed for your injection. Lay the tray down 
on it.
B. Preparing the injection
1
2
Check the liquid in the syringe
It should be clear and colourless. If the solution is cloudy, coloured 
or contains any floating particles, do not use the pre-filled syringe.
Remove the syringe cap
The syringe has a white tamper-evident cap.
Make sure the cap is intact and has not been opened.
If it looks like it has been opened, do not use that syringe.
Hold the syringe so that the white cap is facing up. 
Bend the cap at a right angle until it snaps off.
Do not touch the connection port. 
Do not push on the plunger.
54
3
Fit the needle 
Open needle to expose the connection port. Keep the cover on. 
Press the needle onto the syringe.
Turn it clockwise until it locks into place.
Tip: Make sure the injection needle is firmly attached to the syringe. 
Otherwise it may leak. 
If you have been told to gradually increase your dose of Avonex, 
you may need to use an Avostartclip titration kit provided by your 
doctor.
For further details, speak with your doctor 
Now pull off the plastic needle cover. Do not twist it.
Tip: If you twist the needle cover to remove it, you may accidentally 
remove the needle as well.
C. Giving the injection
1
2
3
Clean and stretch the injection site
If you need to, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection 
site you’ve chosen. Allow the skin to dry.
With one hand, stretch the skin around the injection site.
Relax your muscle.
Make the injection
Insert the injection needle with a quick dart-like thrust at right 
angles to the skin, into the muscle.
The needle must go all the way in.
Press the plunger slowly until the syringe is empty.
If you are using a syringe that has an Avostartclip attached, you will 
receive a lower dose of Avonex. 
The syringe will not empty. 
Pull the needle out 
Keep the skin stretched tightly or squeeze the skin around the 
injection site, and pull out the needle.
If you use alcohol wipes, hold one on the injection site.
Put a plaster over the site of injection if you need to.
Dispose of the rubbish properly
After you have finished each injection, put the needle and syringe into a 
special container (such as a sharps bin), not in ordinary rubbish.
If you have used the Avostartclip, the syringe (and the Avostartclip) 
must be thrown away afterwards.  The unused portion of Avonex must 
not be used.
Waste paper and used wipes can be put in an ordinary rubbish bin.

1 What AVONEX is and what it is used for
(Notes information)
Avonex works best when you use it:
-
-
-
Do not stop your Avonex treatment without speaking to your doctor.
at the same time
once a week
on a regular basis
What AVONEX is
Avonex Pen is used to inject Avonex. The active substance in Avonex is a protein called interferon 
beta-1a. Interferons are natural substances made in your body to help protect you from infections and 
diseases. The protein in Avonex is made up of exactly the same ingredients as interferon beta that is 
found in the human body. 
What AVONEX is used for
56
Avonex is used to treat Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Treatment with Avonex can help to prevent you 
from getting worse, although it will not cure MS.
Everyone has their own set of MS symptoms. These can include:
-
Feeling off-balance or light headed, walking problems, stiffness and muscle spasms, tiredness, 
numbness in the face, arms or legs
Acute or chronic pain, bladder and bowel problems, sexual problems and problems seeing 
things
Difficulty in thinking and concentrating, depression.
-
MS also tends to flare up from time to time: this is called a relapse.
-
Avonex can help to reduce the number of relapses that you have and slow down the disabling 
effects of MS. Your doctor will advise you for how long you can use Avonex or when to stop.
How AVONEX works
Multiple sclerosis is linked to nerve (brain or spinal cord) damage. In MS, your body’s defence system 
reacts against its own myelin – the ‘insulation’ that surrounds nerve fibres. When myelin is damaged, 
the messages between the brain and other parts of the body are disrupted. This is what causes the 
symptoms of MS. Avonex seems to work by stopping your body’s defence system from attacking the 
myelin.
2. What you need to know before you use AVONEX
(Notes information)
Avonex and allergic reactions
Because Avonex is based on a protein, there is a small chance of an allergic reaction.
More about depression
If you have severe depression or thoughts about suicide, you must not use Avonex.
If you have depression, your doctor may still prescribe Avonex for you, but it’s important to let your 
doctor know if you have had depression or any similar problems affecting your moods.
Do not use AVONEX:
-
-
If you are allergic to interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6)
If you have severe depression or think about committing suicide.
Talk to a doctor straight away if any of these apply to you.
Warnings and precautions 
Depression or problems affecting your moods
Thoughts about committing suicide.
Talk to your doctor before using Avonex if you have or have had in the past:
-
-
Changes to your mood, thoughts about suicide, feeling unusually sad, anxious or worthless, should be 
reported to your doctor immediately.
-
-
-
Epilepsy or other seizure disorders not controlled by medication
Serious kidney or liver problems
A low number of white blood cells or platelets, which can cause an increased risk of 
infection, bleeding or anaemia
57
 
-
-
Heart problems, which can cause symptoms such as chest pain (angina), particularly after any 
activity; swollen ankles, shortness of breath (congestive heart failure); or an irregular heartbeat 
(arrhythmias).
Irritation at an injection site, which can lead to skin and tissue damage (injection site necrosis). 
When you are ready to inject, carefully follow the instructions in section 7 “How to inject 
AVONEX PEN”, at the end of this leaflet. This is to reduce the risk of injection site reactions.
Talk to your doctor if you have any of these conditions, or if they worsen whilst taking Avonex.
Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could affect 
your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Avonex. 
Your doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your 
kidneys.
Tell your doctor you are using Avonex:
-
If you are having a blood test. Avonex may interfere with the results.
(Notes information)
Sometimes you will need to remind other medical staff that you are being treated with Avonex. 
For example, if you are prescribed other medicines, or if you have a blood test, Avonex may affect the 
other medicines or the test result.
Paediatric population
Avonex is not recommended for use in children and adolescents because there is limited data on the 
use of Avonex in this population. Avonex should not be used in children below 10 years of age 
because it is yet to be established whether it would work for them and whether it would be safe.
Other medicines and AVONEX
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, especially 
those used to treat epilepsy or depression. Avonex may affect other medicines or be affected by them. 
This includes any medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Avonex can be used during breast-
feeding.
Driving and using machines
If you feel dizzy, do not drive. Avonex makes some people feel dizzy. If this happens to you, or if 
you get any other side effects that could affect your ability, do not drive or use machines.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Avonex
This medicine is essentially ‘sodium-free’. It contains less than 23 mg (1 mmol) sodium in each 
weekly dose.

taking it for up to a day. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist about a suitable dose.
If you have a fever, drink plenty of water to keep you hydrated.

-
-
-
Headache
Muscle aches
Chills or a fever.
These symptoms are not really flu
You can’t pass it on to anyone else. They are more common when you first start using Avonex. As 
you keep using your injections, the flu-like symptoms gradually decrease.
Children (10 years of age and above) and adolescents
In clinical trials, some side effects were reported more frequently in children and adolescents than in 
adults, e.g., muscle pain, pain in extremity, fatigue, and joint pain.
Reporting of side effects
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of

How to inject AVONEX PEN
Avonex Pen (single use)
Pack contents – Avonex Pen, needle and Avonex Pen cover
Avonex Pen – prepared for injection
Avonex Pen – after injection 
(prepared for disposal)
You should have had training in how to use your Avonex Pen. 
These notes are a reminder. If there's anything you're not sure about or you have a problem, check 
with your doctor or pharmacist.
Where to inject
Use a different injection site each week
The best area is the upper, outer thigh muscle. 
Alternate the left and right thighs.
Keep a note of where you have injected each week.
•
•
•
Avonex is injected into a muscle, the best area is the upper, outer thigh muscle as shown in 
the diagram above. Injection of Avonex into the buttocks is not recommended.
Use a different injection site each week. This means less risk of irritation to your skin and 
muscle.
Do not use any area of skin that is bruised, sore, or infected, or if there is an open wound.
65
A. Getting ready
1. Take one Avonex Pen out of the refrigerator
Check the pack contains one Avonex Pen, one needle and one pen cover.
Do not shake Avonex Pen.
Check the expiry date on the Avonex Pen label. 
Do not use if it is out-of-date.
2. Leave Avonex Pen to warm up
Leave it at room temperature for half an hour. This makes the injection more comfortable 
than using straight from the refrigerator. 
Tip: Do not use external heat sources such as hot water to warm Avonex Pen.
3. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry them.
4. Prepare alcohol wipes and sticking plasters (not supplied) if you need them. 
5. Find a clean, hard surface to lay out the items needed for your injection. 
66
B. Preparing Avonex Pen
1 Remove the tamper-evident cap
Make sure the cap is intact and has not been opened. If it 
looks like it has been opened, do not use that Avonex Pen.
• Hold Avonex Pen so that the cap is pointing up.
• Bend the cap at a right angle until it snaps off. 
• Do not touch the exposed glass tip.
Tip: Place the pen down on the table before beginning step 2.
2 Fit the needle
• Avonex Pen has been designed to function only with the 
supplied needle. 
• Peel off the foil from the base of the needle cover.
• Attach the needle by pressing it onto the glass pen tip. 
Keep the pen upright.
• Do not remove the needle cover.
• Gently, turn the needle clockwise until it is firmly 
attached, otherwise the needle may leak. You may not 
get the full dose if it leaks.
Tip: The needle cover will come off automatically during step 3, 
below.
3 Extend the injector shield
• Hold the body of the pen firmly with one hand. Point the 
needle cover away from you and anyone else.
• Use your other hand, and with one quick motion pull up 
the injector shield (grooved area) over the needle until 
the needle is fully covered.
• The plastic needle cover will “pop” off.
Tip: Do not press the blue activation button at the same time.
4 Check the injector shield is extended correctly
• Check the injector shield is fully extended. A small 
rectangular area will be visible next to the oval display 
window. This is the safety lock.
67
C. Using Avonex Pen
5 Check the liquid
• Look through the oval display window. The liquid should 
be clear and colourless.
If the solution is cloudy, coloured or contains any floating 
particles, do not use this pen.
Air bubble(s) are normal.
1 Clean the injection site
If you need to, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection 
site you’ve chosen. Allow the skin to dry.
Tip: The best area is the upper, outer thigh.
2 Place Avonex Pen on the skin
• Hold the body of the pen at a right angle to the injection site with 
one hand. Make sure the windows of the pen are visible.
Tip: Take care not to press the blue activation button too early.
• Firmly press the body of the pen down onto the skin to release 
the safety lock.
• Check the safety lock is released. The small rectangular window 
area will disappear. Avonex Pen is now ready to inject.
Tip: Continue to hold the pen firmly on the skin.
3 Give the injection
• Press the blue activation button with your thumb to start the 
injection.
You will hear a “click” indicating the injection process has begun. 
Do not lift the pen away from your skin.
• Continue to hold the pen on your skin and count slowly for a full 
10 seconds.
• After 10 seconds pull the pen straight out to remove the needle 
from the injection site. 
• Apply pressure to the injection site for a few seconds. If there is 
any blood at the site, wipe it off.
4 Confirm injection delivery
• Check the circular display window. The window will now 
appear yellow when the full dose has been delivered.
• Do not re-use the Avonex Pen. It is for a single use only.
68
5 Disposal
• Place the pen cover on a flat, hard surface. 
Tip: Do not hold the pen cover. You may get a needle injury.
• Insert needle directly into the pen cover. 
• Firmly press until you hear a “click” to seal the needle. You may 
need to use both hands. Once the pen is sealed there is no risk of 
injury.
• Dispose of rubbish properly. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist 
should provide you with instructions on how to dispose of your 
used Avonex Pen, for example into a sharps bin. Always follow 
your local guidelines.

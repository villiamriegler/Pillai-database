3.  Scientific discussion 
3.1.  Introduction 
Prezista (darunavir), co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir is indicated in combination with other 
antiretroviral (ARV) medicinal products for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 
(HIV-1) infection in adult patients. 
Variation(s) requested 
C.I.4 
Variations related to significant modifications of the 
Summary of Product Characteristics due in particular to 
new quality, pre-clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
Type 
II 
The scope of the variation is as follows: 
Extension of indication to add the treatment of antiretroviral experienced patients with no DRV 
resistance associated mutations (RAMs) to Section 4.1 of the 400mg tablet SmPC. Consequential 
changes have been introduced to sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 of the SmPC. Sections 4.4 and 4.5 of 
the SmPC have been updated to include information on interaction with efavirenz. In fulfilment of FUM 
59, editorial changes have been made in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The other strengths are already authorised in ART-experienced adults, including patients with ≥ 1 DRV 
RAMs and patients with no data on genotype and who are PI experienced. 
However, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 5.1 have been updated in line with the changes on 400mg 
tablets. Annex IIB has been updated with a new version of the RMP. The DDPS version number has 
been removed. The PL has been updated accordingly. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an EMA 
decision P/138/2010 for the following condition(s): 
Treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in pediatric patients when 
coadministered with low-dose ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) medicinal 
products in patients from 3 to less than 18 years of age. 
The MAH submitted with this application the EMA/PDCO decision compliance report on this agreed PIP 
which is currently partially completed and the corresponding letter (EMA/17805/2010). 
3.2.  Clinical aspects 
3.2.1.  Rationale for the proposed change 
The MAH submitted an application to add the use of once daily 800 mg darunavir (DRV) + 100 mg 
ritonavir (rtv) for treatment of anti-retroviral therapy (ART)-experienced adults with no DRV resistance 
associated mutations (RAMs). Currently the 800/100 mg once daily regimen is restricted to use in ART-
naïve adults. The application primarily concerns submission of the study report on Week 48 data from 
study TMC114-C229 [ODIN]. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176199/2011  
Page 3/38
 
 
 
 
 
 
It should be noted that the MAH maintains the approved 600/100 mg twice daily regimen for all other 
ART-experienced adults, including patients with ≥ 1 DRV RAMs and patients with no data on genotype 
and who are PI experienced. 
Although the regimen proposed for this application requires the use of the approved 400 mg film-
coated tablet in order to deliver a dose of 800 mg once daily darunavir, this variation also proposes to 
modify the SmPC for all strengths due to the need to reflect the usage in sections 4.1 and 4.2 and to 
update sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 in each case. Corresponding changes are proposed in the PL for 
each of the tablet strengths.  
During the evaluation of this procedure, the CHMP requested the MAH to update the Section 4.5 of the 
SmPC with new information regarding an interaction with efavirenz. 
To support this variation, the MAH submitted a dossier in CTD format including Module 1 (application 
form, proposed product information, information relating to the clinical trial, information relating to 
paediatrics: EMA/PDCO decision compliance report on an agreed PIP partially completed), Module 2 
(clinical overview and clinical summary) and Module 5 (report of study TMC114-C947CPK Bayesian 
analysis of population PK data from study TMC114-C229, report of the 48-week data from study 
TMC114-C229, including population PK data and virological analysis). 
In filing this application the MAH also addresses FUM 059 regarding modification of section 5.1 as 
previously requested by the CHMP.  
3.2.2.  Analysis of data submitted 
Study TMC114-C229 (ODIN) Week 48 report pertains to a randomised (1:1 ratio), open-label non-
inferiority trial comparing DRV/ rtv 800/100 mg q.d versus drv/rtv 600/100 mg b.i.d (both in 
combination with an individually selected OBR consisting of ≥ 2 NRTIs) in treatment-experienced HIV-1 
infected patients with screening genotype resistance testing showing no darunavir RAMs (data up to 
the cut-off date of the Week-48 primary analysis, 27 August 2009). See table 1:

Methods 
This randomised, controlled, open-label multi-centre trial was not blinded due to the non-availability of 
rtv placebo. Additional sensitivity analyses for efficacy were performed to compensate at least partly 
for this lack of blinding. The trial started in September 2007; 113 investigators were involved in the 
sites in the continents mentioned in table 1. 
Forty eight weeks report on the primary analysis is provided for the main phase of the study. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176199/2011  
Page 4/38
 
 
 
 
 
The study included an extension phase to provide DRV/rtv access as a 600/100 mg b.i.d regimen to 
patients who completed the 48 weeks of treatment with DRV/rtv in the main phase of the trial and 
continue to benefit from this treatment, and who live in a region where DRV is not yet commercially 
available, not yet reimbursed by the public and/or private health system or cannot be accessed from 
another source (e.g., access program, government program). The extension phase for this trial is 
ongoing. 
Primary efficacy analyses for this trial were performed when all patients had reached 48 weeks of 
treatment or discontinued earlier (cut-off date of 17-01-2007). 
Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria were: 
  Male or female, aged 18 years or older. 
  Stable treatment with current HAART regimen for ≥ 12 weeks. 
 
Pre-screening and screening plasma HIV-1 RNA > 1000 copies/ml (assayed by RNA PCR standard 
specimen procedure) on current HAART regimen. 
  Screening genotype resistance test results showing none of the following mutations in the protease 
gene V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54L, I54M, T74P, L76V, I84V, L89V, known as DRV RAMs. 
 
In the investigator’s opinion, NNRTIs were not a valid treatment option, because of the subject’s 
ARV treatment history, ARV resistance testing, medication-taking behaviour, safety and tolerability 
concerns, or other subject-related factors. 
  CD4+ cell count > 50 x 103 cells/ml (50 cells/µL). 
Main exclusion criteria were: 
  Active AIDS-defining illness with the following exceptions: stable cutaneous Kaposi’s sarcoma or 
wasting syndrome. [Primary and secondary prophylaxis for an AIDS defining illness was allowed if 
the medication used was not part of the disallowed medication.] 
 
Previous or current use of enfuvirtide (ENF), tipranavir (TPV), or DRV. 
  Use of any non-ARV investigational agents within 60 days prior to screening. 
  Use of disallowed concomitant therapy. 
 
 
Pregnant or breastfeeding. 
Patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of significantly decreased hepatic function or 
decompensation (i.e., liver insufficiency), irrespective of liver enzyme levels. [Coinfected patients 
with chronic hepatitis B or C were allowed to enter the trial if their condition was clinically stable 
and not expected to require treatment during the trial period.] 
  Grade 3 or 4 abnormality as defined by Division of AIDS (DAIDS) grading tables, with the following 
exceptions unless clinical assessment foresaw an immediate health risk to the patient: 
  patients with asymptomatic triglycerides or cholesterol elevations of grade 3 or 4; 
  patients with grade 3 or 4 bilirubin increases who used atazanavir as part of their HAART 
regimen at screening. 
CHMP variation assessment report

Page 5/38
 
 
 
 
 
Previously demonstrated clinically significant allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of 
the study medication DRV or ritonavir. 
  Any active clinically significant disease (e.g., tuberculosis, cardiac dysfunction, pancreatitis, acute 
viral infections), or findings that would compromise the patient’s safety or outcome of the trial. 
Treatments 
During the screening period patients continued HAART regimen (4 weeks). At baseline, patients 
changed their screening regimen. An optimised background regimen (OBR) was initiated and consisted 
of ≥ 2 NRTIs selected by the investigator. Additionally, patients were randomised at baseline in a 1:1 
ratio to receive a new PI regimen consisting of drv/rtv (along with the selected OBR) as summarised in 
table 2:

600/100 mg 
Orally** 600-mg tablet of DRV + 1x100-mg capsule of ritonavir twice daily. 
b.i.d. 
DRV formulation used was F032. 
Treatment period (48 weeks):

DRV formulation used was F030. 
* and if applicable during the extension period. 
** within 30 minutes after completion of a meal, every 12 hours (b.i.d. group) or 24 hours (q.d. group). 
During the treatment period, the disallowed ARVs after the screening period and baseline in both 
treatment groups were as follows: 
 
PIs: All other PIs 
  NRTIs: Investigational NRTIs except tenofovir and emtricitabine 
  NNRTIs: all NNRTIs

Disallowed concomitant non-ARV medications were as follows: 
 
From screening until the end of the treatment period: 
 
investigational agents (from 60 days before screening onwards); 
  experimental vaccines (approved vaccines were allowed if they were given ≥ 4 weeks before a 
viral load measurement). 
 
From baseline until the end of the treatment period: 
 
stimulants: amphetamines, amphetamine derivatives, modafinil; 
  herbal supplements: all products containing Hypericum perforatum(St John’s Wort); 
CHMP variation assessment report

  and many other medications which are contraindicated for use with Prezista or due to clinically 
relevant significant interaction or impact on immune constitution of the patient (e.g. 
immunosuppressants). 
Compliance 
Compliance to DRV/rtv q.d. or DRV/rtv b.i.d. was assessed by 3 different methods: 
 
The Modified Medication Adherence Self-Report Inventory (M-MASRI) questionnaire, 
  Based on DRV plasma concentrations being above or below the detection limit, 
  By pill-count based on the number of pill dispensed and returned. 
Patient-reported adherence rates were transformed to a binary variable using a 95% cut-off to define 
adherent (> 95%) and non-adherent (≤ 95%) patients. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy 
The primary endpoint was virological response, defined as a confirmed plasma viral load of < 50 
copies/ml at Week 48 (using the FDA time to loss of virological response – TLOVR - algorithm).  
The TLOVR algorithm consisted of the following: Response and loss of response had to be confirmed at 
2 consecutive visits and patients who prematurely discontinued were considered as non responders 
after withdrawal. Patients with intermittent missing viral load values were considered responders if the 
preceding and succeeding visits indicated response. In all other cases, intermittent values were 
imputed with non-response. Re-suppression after confirmed virologic failure was considered as failure 
in this algorithm. 
Plasma viral load levels were determined using Roche Amplicor HIV-1 monitor TM test (Version 1.5). 
Secondary endpoints included: 
 
 
 
virologic response defined as a viral load < 400 copies/ml (using the TLOVR algorithm); 
virologic response defined as a change in log10 viral load compared with the baseline value; 
immunologic parameters (CD4+ cell count change from baseline); 
  Comparison of the QoL questionnaire results: the Functional Assessment of HIV Infection (FAHI) 
QoL questionnaire was used. 
Safety 
Safety evaluations included AEs, clinical laboratory tests, biochemistry, haematology, coagulation 
tests, urine analysis, hepatitis, serology/viremia, vital signs (pulse, SBP, and DBP) and ECG readings in 
accordance with ICH E14 (heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval, RR interval, QTc interval). 
Resistance determinations 
The number of all protease (PR) mutations [primary PI mutations, PI RAMs, DRV RAMs, and number of 
all reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations (NRTI RAMs and NNRTI RAMs) as defined by the International 
AIDS Society (IAS)-USA guidelines 2008], were tabulated per treatment group. The incidence of all 
individual protease and RT mutations was also tabulated. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176199/2011  
Page 7/38
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Fold-Change in IC50 (FC) measured by Antivirogram® was analysed, and categorised into 
‘susceptible’ or ’resistant’ based on cut-off values. A drug was considered susceptible if the FC was 
below or equal to the clinical cut-off when this was available (i.e. LPV, TDF, abacavir [ABC], TPV, and 
DRV), or below or equal to the biological cut-off otherwise. 
PK/PD 
Blood samples (sparse sampling) at Weeks 4, 8, 24, 48 (or withdrawal) were analysed. 
PK/PD relationships between the DRV pharmacokinetic parameters AUC24h and C0h versus antiviral 
activity and safety parameters, PK/PD relationships between the rtv pharmacokinetic parameters 
AUC24h and C0h versus the predetermined safety parameters were evaluated. 
All PK/PD analyses were performed by treatment group. In addition, for efficacy as well as for some 
selected safety parameters (see below), a pooled analysis across the DRV/rtv q.d. and DRV/rtv b.i.d. 
treatment groups was performed. 
Sample size 
Assuming a virological response (confirmed viral load < 50 copies/ml) rate of 70% at 48 weeks in both 
treatment arms, 306 patients were required per treatment arm to establish non-inferiority of DRV/rtv 
800/100 mg q.d versus DRV/rtv 600/100 mg b.i.d with a maximum allowable difference (delta) of 
12%, with a 1-sided significance level of α = 0.025 and 90% power. 
A delta of 12 % was considered appropriate, as it was small relative to observed differences between 
DRV/rtv and control PIs. 
Randomisation  
Subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d or DRV/rtv 
600/100 mg b.i.d and according to stratification for screening plasma viral load (< 50,000 or ≥ 50,000 
copies/ml). 
A central randomization system was used. Randomization was done by a predefined randomization list, 
constructed via random permuted blocks to ensure balance across treatments groups in each stratum 
of the 2 stratification factors. 
Statistical methods 
The Intent-to-treat (ITT) and on-protocol (OP) analyses included descriptive statistics, frequency 
tabulations, ANCOVA, general linear mixed model, logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox 
proportional hazards model, Mann-Whitney-U test, Wilcoxon’s matched pairs signed ranks test, Fisher’s 
exact test. 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed when all subjects in this trial reached Week 48 or 
discontinued earlier. All statistical tests were interpreted at the 1-sided 2.5% or equivalently at the 
95% 2-sided significance level, unless specified differently. 
The primary objective analysis was to demonstrate non-inferiority in virological response defined as a 
confirmed plasma viral load of < 50 copies/ml with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d versus DRV/rtv 600/100 
mg b.i.d at Week 48 with a delta/ non-inferiority margin of 12%. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176199/2011  
Page 8/38
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary objectives were to evaluate other virological and immunologic parameters, to compare the 
HRQoL, and to evaluate pharmacokinetics, effects of covariates, and pharmacokinetic / 
pharmacodynamic relationships and safety and tolerability over time.  
Two populations were defined for the analyses: 
 
ITT population: all patients who where randomised and who received at least 1 dose of trial 
medication, regardless of their compliance with the Protocol. 
  OP population: all randomised patients who received trial medication (excluding patients 
noncompliant for the trial medication for ≥ 1 week), and who did not take any disallowed ARV 
medication as described in the Protocol for > 1 week.  
The ITT was considered as the primary population for the efficacy analysis.  A logistic regression model 
including treatment as fixed factor and baseline plasma viral load as a covariate was applied to 
estimate the difference in virologic response rate (defined as a confirmed plasma viral load < 50 HIV-1 
RNA copies/ml) between DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d. and DRV/rtv 600/100 mg b.i.d. For this purpose, 
95% 2-sided confidence intervals (CIs) were derived to compare treatment groups at all time points. If 
at Week 48, the lower limit of this 95% 2-sided CI of the difference between DRV/rtv q.d. and DRV/rtv 
b.i.d. exceeded -12%, non-inferiority of DRV/rtv q.d. to DRV/rtv b.i.d. could be concluded. Additionally, 
a 95% CI of the difference in proportion of response between the 2 treatments was derived by means 
of a normal approximation of the binomial distribution. 
As additional sensitivity analysis, some efficacy analyses were also performed on an OP population 
excluding all major protocol violators. 
The safety analysis was performed on the ITT population. 
In addition, several sensitivity analyses were performed (e.g. observed response defined as a viral load 
< 50 copies/ml (without requiring confirmation of response or loss of response) and NC = F analysis).  
The impact on the conclusions of discontinuation due to patient wish (DCPW; non compliance, 
withdrawal of consent, or lost to follow-up) was assessed by a last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
analysis (i.e. last observed virological response was carried forward to Week 48 for subjects 
discontinuing due to patient wish). 
Functional Assessment of HIV Infection (FAHI) scores (actual data and changes versus baseline) were 
presented descriptively and graphically. To analyze and compare treatments with respect to this QoL 
questionnaire, an ANCOVA was applied including factors for treatment, baseline plasma viral load, 
baseline CD4 counts and baseline FAHI (sub)total as covariate. In addition, a longitudinal mixed effects 
model was used to further describe the QoL changes over time. This model allowed testing for time 
effects, treatment effects, and their interaction. The same factors as in the ANCOVA above were 
included as fixed effects, and an unstructured variance-covariance matrix accounting for serial 
correlation. FAHI response, defined as the proportion of subjects with a clinically meaningful difference 
in Total FAHI score (i.e., a relative increase of 10%) was calculated. 
One non-formal per protocol interim analysis was performed based on continued monitoring and 
assessment of the efficacy and safety in the trial when 50% of all patients had completed the 24-
weeks assessment or discontinued earlier in order to assist the DSMB for human subject protection 
purpose.  The results of this Week-24 interim analysis were confidential and available to only 3 
persons: the Head Biometrics who presented the results to the DSMB, the interim Analysis Statistician 
and the Clinical Programmer supporting the interim analyses. No multiplicity correction was

implemented. 
Results 
Patient disposition 
In this study 590 patients of the planned 612 were randomised and treated, 89 (15%) patients 
prematurely discontinued the study. For disposition of the patients in the ITT and OP populations see 
table 3. The difference between the ITT and OP analysis populations was 55 patients. At the CHMP 
request, the MAH provided a list of the detailed reason for the exclusion of these subjects. They were 
either noncompliant for the investigational medication for > 1 week, either taking any disallowed ARV 
medication for >1 week, either both. Hence, they were excluded from the OP population as these 
events were coded as major protocol deviations in the protocol.

As shown above, the overall discontinuation rate (for any reason) was slightly lower in the DRV/rtv q.d 
than in the DRV/rtv b.i.d treatment group. The majority of discontinuations were due to AE/HIV-
related events, and lost to follow up in both groups in the ITT and OP populations. 
Discontinuations due to virological failure occurred less in < 1% of all patients with no apparent 
difference between the two treatment groups in the ITT and OP populations.  
The rate of discontinuations in both treatment groups remained relatively constant throughout the trial 
period with slightly more discontinuations in the group on the b.i.d regimen past week 8 as compared 
to the q.d regimen. The median (range) duration of exposure for the respective treatment groups was 
48.4 (0.1; 56.0) and 48.4 (0.1; 63.0) weeks. 
Conduct of the study 
GCP 
The MAH declared that the trial was performed in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical 
Practice as outlined in 21 CFR Parts 50, 56 and 312 and the declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent 
revisions, and the European Union Clinical Trials Directive. 
Compliance/ Major Protocol deviations 
  Based on the M-MASRI, 59% of all patients were adherent to the trial medication over the course 
of the treatment period. At all measured time points, the percentage of adherent patients was 
greater in the DRV/rtv q.d group (ranging between 67% and 71%) than in the DRV/rtv b.i.d group 
(ranging between 59% and 65%). 
  Calculated by pill count, the adherence rates were generally lower (56% overall assessment), and 
at all time points, the percentage of adherent patients was also greater in the DRV/rtv q.d group 
(ranging between 58% and 63%) than in the DRV/rtv b.i.d group (ranging between 42% and 59%). 
  Based on DRV plasma concentrations, 85% of all patients were adherent to the trial medication 
overall. The difference in adherence to the trial medication between the treatment groups was very 
small at all time points (DRV/rtv q.d ranging between 86% and 94%, DRV/rtv b.i.d ranging 
between 90% and 96%). 
The apparent differences in the results of the 3 different adherence measures used in trial TMC114- 
TMC114-C229 can be explained by the differences inherent in the data collection methods, and the 
way in which dichotomous levels of adherence (‘adherent’ versus ‘non-adherent’) were derived. The 
results obtained from the 3 different methods should only be compared qualitatively, not 
quantitatively. 
Major protocol deviations were defined as relevant non-compliance with the trial medication, 
disallowed ARV use, violations with respect to inclusion and exclusion criteria, and/or procedures that 
might impact the primary efficacy endpoint at Week 48. Major protocol deviations were noted in 14.6% 
of patients in the DRV/rtv q.d group and 7.8% of patients in the DRV/rtv b.i.d group. The difference 
between the treatment groups was mostly due to the higher incidence of non-compliance with the trial 
medication.

a The on-protocol population comprised 535 patients: 259 and 276 patients in the DRV/rtv q.d. and DRV/rtv b.i.d groups, 
respectively. 
The study groups were generally well balanced with regard to demographic characteristics. The same 
holds for baseline disease characteristics as displayed in table 5. Approximately 11 % of the patients 
were co-infected with hepatitis B or C with relatively more co-infected patients on the b.i.d regimen. 
There were no notable differences between the treatment groups with respect to susceptibility to PIs, 
NRTIs, NNRTIs at baseline, or with respect to the number of susceptible NRTIs in the underlying OBR.

a All currently available PIs = (fos)amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, LPV, nelfinavir, saquinavir, TPV, DRV. 
Overall, the median FC for DRV in the ITT population was 0.5, and the median FC for the other PIs 
ranged from 0.6 (LPV, [fos]amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir) to 0.9 (nelfinavir). There were no 
relevant differences between the DRV/rtv q.d. and DRV/rtv b.i.d. treatment groups with respect to FC 
values. 
In addition to the cases of co-infection with hepatitis B or C, the incidence of other concomitant 
diseases at screening was high in both treatment groups.  This is line with the observation that 65% of 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176199/2011  
Page 13/38
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients had at least WHO clinical stage 2. The most common were dermatologic conditions (21%) and 
conditions related to the GI system (21%). These conditions had similar frequencies in both DRV/rtv 
treatment groups. Other conditions were generally similarly presented in the treatment groups. 
The majority of non-ARV concomitant therapies used during this trial were for the treatment of 
underlying disease. The use of antifungals for dermatologic use was higher in the DRV/rtv q.d group 
(15%) than in the DRV/rtv b.i.d group (9%), while the use of lipid modifying agents and stomatologic 
preparations was lower in the DRV/rtv q.d group (5% and 13% resp.) than in the DRV/rtv b.i.d group 
(11% and 17% resp.). There were no important differences between the DRV/rtv q.d and DRV/rtv b.i.d 
treatment groups with respect to other non-ARV concomitant therapies. 
Discussion on Design, Methods & Demographics 
The general study design is acceptable given that the test regimen was compared against the 
approved twice daily regimen, which is already approved for use in ART-experienced subjects. 
The open label study design is acceptable given that, if the study had been double-blind, the QoL 
assessment could not have taken into account the treatment simplification. 
3.2.3.  Clinical Efficacy 
Primary endpoint 
The percentage of patients with confirmed plasma viral load < 50 copies/ml at Week 48 in the ITT 
population was 72.1% for the DRV/rtv q.d group and 70.9% for the DRV/rtv b.i.d group. Statistical 
comparison using the logistic regression model for the ITT and OP populations is shown in table 6.

The lower limit of the 95% CI of the difference between the treatment groups was > -12% in both 
analysis populations at Week 48; therefore, non-inferiority of DRV/rtv q.d versus DR/rtv b.i.d regimen 
was concluded.

The different sensitivity analyses indicated that the results for virological response defined as the 
percentage of patients with confirmed viral load < 50 copies/ml were robust and consistent across the 
different populations and imputation methods used. Except for the longitudinal mixed model, the lower 
limit of the 95% CI of the difference between the treatment groups was consistently > -12%, 
confirming non-inferiority of DRV/rtv q.d. versus DRV/rtv b.i.d. See table 9. However, the CHMP 
considered that the results obtained from the longitudinal mixed model analysis of virologic response 
should be interpreted with caution given the parameters of this modelling methodology.

b P-value for treatment by subgroup interaction 
It is acknowledged that study TMC114-C229 was not statistically powered for comparative analyses at 
subgroup level. However, the data indicate that this regimen might not be appropriate for patients with 
HIV RNA >100,000 copies/ml and for patients with non-clade B virus. In addition, there are insufficient 
data to determine whether this regimen is appropriate for patients with CD4 counts <50-100 x 106/L 
and for those with virus not susceptible to potentially suitable NRTIs.  
In addition, the data suggest that the 800/100 mg DRV/rtv q.d regimen had variable efficacy in 
comparison to the approved twice daily regimen according to region (e.g. in South America).  
Secondary endpoints 
Virologic response – other parameters 
Week 48 results of main secondary virologic response parameters such as the percentage of patients 
with confirmed plasma viral load < 400 copies/ml, and statistical comparisons between the treatment 
groups at Week 48 for this secondary virologic response parameter (logistic regression model, ITT and 
OP – TLOVR) showed similar patterns as for the primary endpoint. The same holds for the sensitivity 
analyses for virologic response < 400 copies/ml (TLOVR) performed as for the primary virologic 
response parameter. 
Results for patients with a confirmed decrease in plasma log10 viral load from baseline are displayed in 
figure 1.  
Figure 1.  Mean Change in Log10 Viral Load From Baseline (ITT – NC = F) Over Time 
A decrease in log10 viral load from baseline was observed for both treatment groups as early as Week 
4. At all time points, the mean decrease in log10 viral load was similar for the DRV/rtv q.d. and the 
DRV/rtv b.i.d. groups. 
For other secondary virological parameters such as the time to first virologic response: percentage of 
patients achieving <50 copies/ml or <400 copies/ml (FDA-TLOVR algorithm), the time to virologic

failure and decrease of mean viral load difference in average (DAVG) at Week 48 the results were 
comparable for both DRV/rtv treatment groups. 
Immunological response 
Increases in mean CD4+ cell count from baseline were observed for both treatment groups at all time 
points; these increases were similar for both treatment groups except at Week 8 with DRV/rtv q.d 
showing a similar value as for week 4 whereas in group DRV/rtv b.i.d the values showed further 
increase. 
Statistical comparison between the treatment groups at Week 48 (ANCOVA) for the change in CD4+ 
cell count from baseline (ITT and OP – LOCF) is summarised in table 12.

b Confidence limits based on standard error obtained by application of the delta method 
In both groups the increase in CD4 cell count was similar.  The findings for CD8+ cell count and 
CD4+/CD8+ ratio were consistent with those for CD4+ cell count. 
Development of Resistance - Virological Failure 
Analysis of the development of resistance at endpoint (i.e., the last available time point with a 
genotype and/or phenotype during the treatment period) compared to baseline was performed. The 
TLOVR (non-VF censored) algorithm was used for the identification of virologic failures (with HIV-1 
RNA ≥ 50 copies/ml). The virologic failures group consisted of: 
  Rebounders: patients who were still in the trial at Week 12 and first achieved 2 consecutive viral 
load values < 50 copies/ml, followed by 2 consecutive viral load values of ≥ 50 copies/ml, or 
discontinuation with a last observed viral load value on treatment of ≥ 50 copies/ml, 
 
Patients who were never suppressed: patients who were still in the trial at Week 12 and never 
achieved 2 consecutive viral load values of < 50 copies/ml. 
The numbers of rebounders and patients who were never suppressed are displayed in table 13.

* Only 60 and 42 cases in the q.d and b.i.d groups, respectively had endpoint and baseline genotype data. 
The observed small difference between the treatment groups can mainly be explained by a higher 
frequency of early discontinuations (≤ 12 weeks) in the DRV/rtv b.i.d. group (10 patients) compared to 
the DRV/rtv q.d group (3 patients). These early discontinuations (i.e. ≤ 12 weeks) were not counted as 
non-responders, therefore the DRV/rtv b.i.d group contained less non-responder than the DRV/rtv q.d 
group. 
Paired baseline/endpoint genotypes were available for 60 and 42 virologic failure patients in the 
DRV/rtv q.d and DRV/rtv b.i.d groups, respectively.  
  Only 1 patient, in the DRV/rtv q.d group, developed primary (major) PI mutations (V32I, M46I, 
L76V, and I84V), which included 3 DRV RAMs (V32I, L76V, and I84V).  
 
In the virologic failures with baseline and endpoint genotype, 7 (11.7%) out of 60 patients 
developed PI RAMs at endpoint in the DRV/rtv q.d group versus 4 (9.5%) out of 42 in the DRV/rtv 
b.i.d. group. Four (6.7%) and 3 (7.1%) virologic failures developed 1 or 2 NRTI RAMs in the 
DRV/rtv q.d and DRV/rtv b.i.d groups, respectively. 
Phenotypic data (with Antivirogram®) at baseline and endpoint for virologic failures were available for 
59 cases in DRV/rtv q.d group and 41 cases in DRV/rtv b.i.d group.  
In the DRV/rtv q.d group, one patient lost susceptibility to DRV at endpoint (FC changed from 0.4. to 
24.4) and another patient lost susceptibility to 2 PIs.  
Seven out of 59 (11.9%) patients in this group lost susceptibility to an NRTI in the OBR, compared to 4 
out of 41 (9.8%) in the DRV/rtv b.i.d group. Loss of susceptibility to an NRTI in the OBR was 
associated with developing NRTI RAMs in 3 of the 7 virologic failures in the DRV/rtv q.d group. 
Endpoint FC values were just above the biological cut-offs for 3 other patients. Loss of susceptibility to 
an NRTI in the OBR in the 4 virologic failures in the DRV/rtv b.i.d group was associated with developing 
NRTI RAMs in 2 patients. 
Virologic response by adherence/compliance to therapy

As shown above virologic response at Week 48 was greater in adherent patients than in non adherent 
patients (adherence based on the overall assessment). In all subgroups by adherence, virologic 
response was similar in both treatment groups. The response data of the subgroups of adherent 
patients assessed by the 3 different methods supported the non-inferiority of DRV/rtv q.d versus 
DRV/rtv b.i.d regimen. In non adherent patients, non-inferiority in virologic response of DRV/rtv q.d 
was supported when compliance was assessed by pill count and DRV plasma concentrations but not by 
the (M-MARSI) method. 
QoL- FAHI score 
FAHI imputed score at baseline was rather high (124 for the DRV/rtv q.d and 121 DRV/rtv b.i.d 
treatment groups), leaving relatively limited room for improvement. There were no notable statistically 
or clinically relevant differences between the two treatment groups for the slight observed mean 
changes at week 48 compared to baseline values.  
There were also no relevant differences between the DRV/rtv q.d and DRV/rtv b.i.d treatment groups 
in FAHI response. 
Discussion on Efficacy 
The response rates for DRV/rtv q.d regimen in the subgroups such as high viral load > 100000 
copies/ml, CD4 counts at the lowest range <50 even <100 cells (x 106/L), 0 number of susceptible 
NRTIs in the OBR, and clade non-B seems to indicate that in such groups the 800/100 mg DRV/rtv q.d 
regimen might not result in comparable efficacy with the approved 600 /100 mg DRV/rtv b.i.d regimen 
in ART experienced patients, although the number of involved patients are limited.  
Regional differences are also apparent in the presented data: In North America the q.d regimen of 
Prezista was favoured whereas in South America the b.i.d regimen seems to be favoured in the 
comparison. Despite the outcome of the formal test for treatment heterogeneity which indicated no 
significant interaction between treatment group and region (see Table 11), the lower efficacy of the

800/100 mg DRV/rtv q.d regimen in comparison to the approved b.i.d regimen in this relatively large 
subgroup of patients is of concern. 
The long-term efficacy of DRV/rtv q.d regimen is unknown in ART-experienced adult patients with 0 
DRV RAMs. At some time point before or post week 48 a certain proportion of the patients might 
develop resistance to DRV resulting ultimately in failure of DRV/rtv treatment.  
The results for the secondary efficacy endpoints were consistent with the results of the primary 
endpoint for both treatment groups. 
The paired baseline/endpoint genotypes for virologic failure patients are rather limited. The 
comparative results with both DRV/rtv treatment regimens should be interpreted with caution; yet 1 
patient in the DRV/rtv q.d group developed primary (major) DRV mutations lost susceptibility to DRV 
at endpoint based on phenotyping analysis. The latter patient lost susceptibility also to other PIs. The 
development of this resistance was possibly related to previous failure of LPV/rtv treatment. However, 
the patient was compliant according to DRV concentration levels and did not have any structured 
treatment interruptions. This point reveals some of the difficulties and risks to use the proposed once 
daily dosage of DRV/rtv in an appropriate patient-tailored fashion. 
The sensitivity analysis results of adherent versus non-adherent patients by treatment regimen, by 
adherence measurement method and differences between treatment groups confirm the importance of 
the adherence to ART therapy to obtain optimal benefit from the treatment. However, the extent of 
non-compliance/ non-adherence is of concern and it does impact on the global primary outcome of the 
study. Although, the findings in adherent patient groups by adherence measurement method do not 
compromise the robustness of non-inferiority conclusion. In adherent patients, the response rate was 
approximately 10% higher than in the ITT or OP TLOVR populations of the primary analysis. However, 
these results did not reveal clinically relevant difference between the two treatment groups. 
3.2.4.  Population PK/PD data 
Sparse sampling data of 280 patients on the q.d regimen and 278 patients on the b.i.d regimen were 
included in the population pharmacokinetic analysis for DRV. DRV and rtv plasma concentrations were 
analysed by a validated LC-MS/MS method. 
The summary of the available data included in the population pharmacokinetic analysis and the 
covariates are shown in table 15:

The model applied is based upon the model developed before. The parameter estimates from the 
original population PK model used in this analysis are in table 16. 
Table 16.  Parameter estimates from the original population PK model 
For DRV, for the 600 mg BID arm a slight bias for the individual predicted concentrations (IPRED) is 
observed. These are under-predicted at high concentrations and somewhat over-predicted at low 
concentrations. This was also observed for the typical predicted concentrations (PRED). However, the 
less smooth lines for all plots indicate little bias in the structural model as the smooth is similar to the 
expected trend. The weighted residuals (WRES) are approximately normally distributed although there 
is a trend for the WRES to increase for time after dosing (TAD) beyond 20 hrs. However, this may be 
attributed to compliance or inaccuracies in dosing history, as time after dosing in this study would be 
expected to be not greater than 12h. For the 800/100 mg QD arm there is almost no bias for IPRED 
and a slight over-prediction for PRED as concentrations increase. The WRES values are again 
approximately normally distributed. There is no trend for the WRES to increase as TAD increases. The 
distribution of etas on CL/F appears to be approximately normal distributed. The individual random 
effects (ETA) for clearance plotted against age, body weight (WT), creatinine clearance (CRCL), sex, 
race and dose, showed no clear apparent trends. 
For RTV, it appeared that the dependent (DV) vs. PRED plots indicate that the population model cannot 
predict higher concentrations, which was not seen during model development. This can be attributed to 
the fact that for model development Cmax values were lower compared to this study. In addition, the 
WRES are also skewed and not normally distributed. 
The Bayesian estimates of the DRV and rtv pharmacokinetic parameters from the sparse sampling data 
are summarised in table 17.

As expected dosing with DRV/rtv q.d resulted in lower AUC24h and C0h values compared to dosing 
with DRV/rtv b.i.d.  Similar findings were obtained for rtv. Results from this study were consistent with 
findings from studies previously submitted by the MAH. Likewise, the findings with respect to the DRV 
pharmacokinetic parameters by subgroups for gender, age, race, region, and weight are consistent 
with previous pharmacokinetic analyses.  
There were some differences between the treatment groups regarding exposure (AUC) to DRV in the 
above mentioned subgroups. The MAH stated that despite the lower DRV trough and overall exposure 
following DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d, comparable efficacy to the DRV/rtv b.i.d group was observed, 
confirming that adequate DRV exposures were achieved following DRV/rtv q.d dosing in this 
population. 
At the CHMP request, analyses of the numbers of patients with plasma trough DRV concentrations 
(C0h) that exceeded the predefined target trough concentration of 550 ng/ml (based on the EC50 
value for PI-resistant HIV-1 strains when corrected for protein binding) and those who did not achieve 
this target concentration in both treatment groups and subgroups defined by gender, age, race, region, 
and weight were provided. See tables 18 and 19. 
Table 18.  Overview of subjects with DRV C0h below (<) and equal to or above (≥) 550 ng/mL 
overall, and by subgroups for gender, age, race, region, and weight

Table 19.  Summary of the clinical outcome for subjects in both treatment groups (overall) who did 
not achieve a DRV C0h of < 550 ng/mL (corresponding values for baseline viral load, viral load 
change from baseline, and virologic response [HIV-RNA < 50 copies/mL, TLOVR and observed case])  
The number of patients with C0h values below 550 ng/ml is low (8/558) of whom 7 patients were in 
the 800/100 mg qd group vs. 1 in the 600/100 mg bid group. Moreover, 7 out of 8 patients had a 
virologic response at week 48; the only patient not having a response was from the bid group. 
Suboptimal exposure in the 800 mg q.d group associated with suboptimal trough concentrations seems 
to be limited to a minority of the patients. 
The MAH was of the opinion that there were no relationships between the DRV C0h and the change in 
log10 viral load or virologic response defined as plasma viral load < 50 copies/ml from baseline at 
Week 48 were observed in either treatment group. The regression analyses showed no relevant 
relationships between the DRV pharmacokinetics and virologic response at Week 48. Baseline log10 
viral load and number of susceptible NRTIs were predictors of response. 
There were no apparent/consistent relationships between the DRV and rtv pharmacokinetic parameters 
AUC24h and C0h and the occurrence of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of the trial 
medication, or rash-, cardiac-, GI-, liver-, lipid- and glucose-related AEs, or AEs of the SOCs Nervous 
System Disorders, and Psychiatric Disorders or laboratory lipid abnormalities. 
Nevertheless, this target concentration was used by the MAH in support of the PK/PD rationale of the 
DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d regimen. In the present ODIN study the number of patients with trough 
concentration values below 550 ng/ml is low and perhaps too small to detect any relationship between 
the pharmacokinetics of DRV and its efficacy in the absence of studies of prolonged duration. 
Furthermore, the quoted trials in other populations in other studies used the DRV/rtv 600/100 b.i.d 
regimen where this might not be an issue.  The validity of the concern discussed above with regard to 
the risk of suboptimal exposure to DRV/rtv with the once daily regimen is further emphasized by the 
findings of Soon GH et al (2010, see below). Based on the importance of the observations in this study 
on the target trough concentration the MAH accepted to include an appropriate warning in the SmPC. 
A recently published study (Soon GH et al.2010. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 54:2775– 2780) on 
the interaction of very similar dosage of DRV/ rtv (i.e. 900/100 mg once daily regimen of DRV/rtv with 
efavirenz) revealed that efavirenz impacted adversely on the DRV plasma concentrations in healthy 
volunteers.  The trough levels of DRV [by 57% to 1,180 ng/ml (SD: 1,138 ng/ml)] and half-life were 
reduced significantly; the effect on AUC 0-24 was less pronounced (reduced by 14%; see table 20). As 
implied from the large SD value, many individuals will have suboptimal trough levels.

Table 20.  Pharmacokinetics of DRV when 900mg was given once daily with rtv at 100mg once daily, 
before and after administration of efavirenz at 600mg once daily 
The observed effect of 600 mg q.d. efavirenz on DRV trough levels is more pronounced than the effect 
presently described in the section 4.5 of the approved SmPC. Therefore, combination therapy with 
efavirenz and DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d is disputable. 
Of note, in the ODIN trial, no efavirenz was used. 
Discussion on PK/PD data  
The population pharmacokinetic model was adequate to describe the pharmacokinetics for DRV. With 
regard to rtv, the data were accepted earlier for the approved same dosing regimen recommended for 
ART naïve patients.  
The problem of possible suboptimal exposure in the 800 mg q.d group associated with suboptimal 
trough concentrations seems to be limited to a minority of the patients; however, the number of 
patients with suboptimal exposure was higher than in the 600/100 mg bid group. 
The findings from the study from Soon GH et al on the adverse interaction of efavirenz with the PK of 
the very similar dosage of DRV/ rtv (i.e. 900/100 mg q.d) are also based on the importance of this 
target trough level concentration. 
A concentration below 550 ng/ml is one of the factors which may impact on the efficacy. The CHMP felt 
that this point was greater concern for the q.d dosing regimen in ART experienced patients. In 
addition, it may even be further affected by any large decrease in DRV concentrations for instance by 
co-medications. As requested by the CHMP, the MAH included an appropriate warning in the SmPC. 
3.2.5.  Clinical Safety 
The most frequent adverse events (AEs) with at least possibly related to treatment (i.e. adverse drug 
reactions, ADRs) reported in both treatment groups were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and 
rash. See tables 21 and 22 for a summary and display of ADRs in both treatment groups.

* Investigator-Assessed Causality 
Except for diarrhoea and vomiting, which were less frequent with DRV/rtv q.d than with DRV/rtv b.i.d, 
the incidence of all these AEs was comparable between the treatment groups. However, most frequent 
ADRs ≥ grade 2 related to DRV/rtv q.d or DRV/rtv b.i.d, respectively occurred at similar rates in the 
treatment groups and were mainly gastrointestinal and related to nausea (3.7% and 4.4%), diarrhoea 
(3.7% in both groups), and vomiting (2.4% and 3.0%). 
Cardiac-related AEs were reported with similar frequency in the DRV/rtv q.d group (2.7%) and DRV/rtv 
b.i.d group (1.7%). Only 1 cardiac-related AE was considered at least possibly related to DRV/rtv (ECG 
U-wave abnormality) this was a patient in the q.d group. 
The incidence of laboratory abnormalities was low and generally similar in both treatment groups. 
Liver-related AEs were considered at least possibly related to DRV/rtv in none in the DRV/rtv q.d group 
versus 4 in the DRV/rtv b.i.d group (1 hepatomegaly, 3 with increased LFT). 
Overall, hyperbilirubinemia (increase in total bilirubin) was observed slightly less frequently in the 
DRV/rtv q.d group (1.0%) than in the DRV/rtv b.i.d group (3.2%). The small difference between the 
treatment groups in the incidence of hyperbilirubinemia appeared to be driven by hepatitis B or C co 
infection, which was less frequent in the DRV/rtv q.d group (see table 4). Furthermore, in contrast to 
the q.d regimen, the incidence of liver-related AEs was higher in co infected patients than in not co 
infected patients (8.1% versus 2.7%) in the b.i.d regimen. 
Lipid-related AEs were considered at least possibly related to DRV/rtv in 7 (2.4%) in the DRV/rtv q.d 
group versus 14 (4.7%) in the DRV/rtv b.i.d group (mainly cases of hypercholesterolemia, 
hypertriglyceridaemia, hyperlipaemia).  
The incidence of coagulation and haematology laboratory abnormalities was generally comparable 
between the treatment groups. The majority of coagulation and haematology abnormalities in this trial 
were grade 1 or 2. Grade 3 or 4 haematology related abnormalities occurred mostly in only 1 or 2 
subjects in any treatment group. 
The incidence of AEs related to urinalysis was low and similar for both treatment groups. The most 
frequent AEs related to urinalysis were haematuria, reported in 1.4% of patients in both treatment 
groups, and proteinuria (0.7% in both treatment groups). No other AEs related to urinalysis were 
reported in > 1 patient in any treatment group.  
Small mean changes from baseline were observed for vital signs parameters. None of the observed 
mean changes from baseline and no between-group differences for any of the vital signs parameters 
were considered clinically relevant.  
Comparison of the change from baseline in ECG parameters revealed small mean changes, which were 
sometimes statistically significant (Wilcoxon’s matched pairs signed ranks test). None of the observed 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176199/2011  
Page 29/38
 
 
 
 
within-group mean changes from baseline were considered clinically relevant. The incidence of the 
individual QTc interval abnormalities was generally comparable for both treatment groups. 
Treatment emergent QTcF values of > 500 ms were observed in 1.7% and 1.3% of patients in the 
DRV/rtv q.d and DRV/rtv b.i.d groups, respectively. For QTcB values of > 500 ms were observed in 
2.5% and 0.9% of patients, respectively. Isolated increases in QTcF of > 60 ms were observed in 
3.7% and 3.5% of patients in the DRV/rtv q.d and DRV/rtv b.i.d treatment groups; similar rates were 
noted for increases in QTcB. No clinically relevant cases related to QTc prolongation were reported. 
At the CHMP request, the MAH discussed the overall safety and tolerability profile for both DRV/rtv 
dose regimens which were generally consistent with the known overall safety profile for DRV/rtv. 
Smaller incidences were observed for DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d. compared to DRV/rtv 600/100 mg 
b.i.d. for the following AEs or laboratory abnormalities: 
  SAEs (5.4% versus 9.1%); 
  Grade 3 or 4 AEs (7.8% versus 15.2%); 
 
The GI disorders diarrhea (14.3% versus 22.3%) and vomiting (4.4% versus 8.4%); these 
differences were mainly driven by grade 1 events (see Table 23); 
 
Lipid abnormalities (see Table 24).

Discussion on Clinical Safety  
The safety results of the present study are consistent with the known safety profile of DRV/rtv 600/100 
mg b.i.d, with some differences with regard to frequencies. These can be explained by the difference in 
the intensity of prior ART therapy in the studied populations and also by the current knowledge on DRV 
safety.  
The safety profile of the DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d in the present study is similar to that of the b.i.d 
regimen with diarrhoea and vomiting being less frequent with the q.d regimen in the tested patient 
population. The predicted higher rate of gastro-intestinal intolerance after q.d dosage was not clearly 
apparent, with the exception of a few more discontinuations due to ADRs such as nausea and vomiting. 
However, the differences in incidences found in trial TMC114-C229 can not support a generalized claim 
that the safety profile of the q.d. regimen is ”significantly superior” to the b.i.d regimen. Furthermore, 
the safety profile of the q.d regimen is consistent with earlier experience with this regimen in ART-
naïve HIV1-infected patients. This safety profile is adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
3.2.6.  Risk Management Plan 
At the request of the CHMP, an updated version of the RMP: version 10.3, dated 12 January 2011 was

Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration, Section 4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use, and Section 5.2 
Pharmacokinetic properties state that there is limited information 
available in patients above 65 years of age and therefore Section 
4.2 Posology and method of administration and Section 4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use state that PREZISTA 
should be used with caution in this age group.  
 Section 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation of the SmPC 
states that there are no adequate and well-controlled studies 
with darunavir in pregnant women and it is not known whether 
darunavir is excreted in human milk. Therefore, PREZISTA/rtv 
should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit 
justifies the potential risk and, taking into account the potential 
of HIV transmission and the potential for adverse reactions in 
breast-fed infants, mothers should be instructed not to breast-
feed under any circumstances if they are receiving PREZISTA.

Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration states that 
there are insufficient data on the use of PREZISTA with low dose 
ritonavir in children less than 6 years of age or less than 20 kg 
body weight. Hence, in Section 4.2 Posology and method of 
administration and Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions 
for use it is stated that PREZISTA is not recommended for use in 
this group. 
In addition, Section 5.3 Preclinical safety data states that due to 
uncertainties regarding the rate of development of the human 
blood brain barrier and liver enzymes, PREZISTA with low dose 
ritonavir should not be used in paediatric patients below 3 years 
of age.

Section 4.8 Undesirable effects (subsection Children and 
adolescents) of the SmPC states that overall, the safety profile in 
the 80 children and adolescents included in the Phase II DELPHI 
trial was similar to that observed in the adult population. 
Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties (subsection Clinical 
experience) of the SmPC provides information on duration of 
exposure to DRV in respective populations (up to 96 weeks for 
the adult population and up to 24 weeks for the paediatric 
population) 
This version of the RMP does not yet reflect the currently approved SmPC (29/11/2010) nor does it 
take into account the final outcome of the label update related to present submission (e.g., the new 
efavirenz request) since this is not yet finalised. The MAH will submit a complete update of the RMP, 
addressing the approved labelling, with the next PSUR submission which is due 21 February 2011. 
3.3.  Changes to the Product Information 
The following changes are highlighted in the product information in Annex I.

3.4.  Results and Discussion 
3.4.1.  Efficacy Conclusion 
Overall, the 48 week results of study TMC114-C229 in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patients 
with 0 DRV RAMs showed non-inferiority of the efficacy of the newly proposed dosage of DRV/rtv at 
800/100 mg q.d. to the DRV/rtv 600/100 mg b.i.d dosage both in combination with OBR based on the 
primary virologic endpoint (i.e. the percentage of patients achieving confirmed plasma viral load < 50 
copies/ml in the ITT population) at the chosen delta of 12%. The results for the secondary virological 
and immunological response parameters were consistent with the results for the primary endpoint.  
The response rate was 72.1% for the DRV/rtv q.d group versus 70.9% in the DRV/rtv 600/100 mg 
b.i.d group. The sensitivity analyses results concerning adherent versus non-adherent patients 
confirmed the importance of adherence to ART therapy to obtain optimal benefit from the treatment. 
In adherent patients, the response rate was approximately 10% higher than in the overall ITT or OP 
TLOVR populations of the primary analysis. 
However, the response rates for DRV/rtv q.d regimen in the subgroups such as high viral load > 
100000 copies/ml, CD4 counts at the lowest range <50 cells (x 106/L) or even <100 cells (x 106/L), 0 
number of susceptible NRTIs in the OBR, and clade non-B seem to indicate that the 800/100 mg 
DRV/rtv q.d regimen might not result in a comparable efficacy to the approved 600/100 mg DRV/rtv 
b.i.d regimen in ART experienced patients. 
Furthermore, regional differences are also apparent in the presented data: In North America the q.d 
regimen of Prezista was favoured whereas in South America the b.i.d regimen seems to be favoured in 
the comparison.  
Finally, the long-term efficacy of DRV/rtv q.d regimen is unknown in ART-experienced adult patients 
with 0 DRV RAMs. The extension phase for the ODIN trial is on-going. However, DRV/rtv 600/100 mg 
b.i.d is the only regimen used in this phase of the study. Hence, the data from the extension phase can 
therefore be considered only of supportive value. 
Hence, at the CHMP request, the MAH restricted the originally claimed broad indication in “ART 
experienced adults with 0 darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs)” to “a subset of ART 
experienced adults” taking into account the CHMP’s concerns in relation to relevant impacting factors 
e.g. high viral load (HIV RNA >100,000 copies/ml), low CD4 counts (<100 x 106/L) in Section 4.1 of 
the SmPC. In addition, since the long-term data on the efficacy of the DRV/rtv q.d regimen in this 
population is not available, the MAH reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC that the data are derived 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176199/2011  
Page 35/38
 
 
 
 
from a single clinical trial and the long-term efficacy of  DRV/rtv q.d regimen is unknown in the sought 
indication. 
The resistance data in this trial indicated that DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d. based therapy in this 
population results in a low rate of virologic failure and development of resistance. However, at some 
time point before or post week 48 a certain proportion of the patients will develop resistance to DRV 
resulting ultimately in failure of DRV/rtv treatment. Prescribers and patients should be alerted to this 
issue and should be advised to have regular reassessment of the resistance development to DRV 
conducted; and to assess the adequacy of the treatment regimen and to change timely to DRV/rtv 
600/100 mg b.i.d or another appropriate ART combination therapy. At the CHMP request, the MAH 
updated the wording in relation to the reassessment of virologic response and resistance testing in the 
SmPC in Section 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1. In addition, the MAH proposes the twice-daily dose 
DRV/rtv 600/100 mg b.i.d as the recommended dosage in treatment-experienced adults with ≥ 1 DRV 
RAM(s) and “in the infrequent situations where for treatment-experienced patients a genotype is not 
available”. Section 4.2 of the SmPC was updated accordingly. 
Based on the provided population pharmacokinetic data, the MAH claimed that despite lower DRV and 
rtv trough concentrations and overall exposures, adequate DRV and rtv exposures were achieved 
following DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d dosing, as confirmed by the non-inferior efficacy with this regimen 
compared to that with DRV/rtv 600/100 mg b.i.d. Analyses of the numbers of patients with plasma 
trough DRV concentrations (C0h) that exceeded the predefined target trough concentration of 550 
ng/ml and those who did not achieve this target concentration in both treatment groups and subgroups 
defined by gender, age, race, region, and weight were provided by the MAH. These data seem to 
indicate that this risk is limited to a minority of the patients; however, the number of patients with 
suboptimal exposure was higher than in the 600/100 mg b.i.d group. This issue was further discussed 
with MAH based on the recently published study of  Soon GH et al. on the interaction of a very similar 
dosage of DRV/ rtv (i.e. 900/100 mg) once daily regimen with efavirenz. This study revealed that 
efavirenz impacted adversely on the DRV plasma concentrations, especially the trough plasma 
concentration, in healthy volunteers. Hence, at the CHMP request, the MAH updated sections 4.4 and 
4.5 of the SmPC to inform the prescriber of the risks of suboptimal DRV plasma trough concentrations 
and recommend the use of DRV / rtv 600/100 mg b.i.d, instead of DRV / rtv 800mg q.d, when DRV is 
used in combination with efavirenz. 
Overall, the extent of non-compliance/ non-adherence in this study is of concern although the findings 
in adherent patient groups did not seem to compromise the robustness of non-inferiority conclusion. 
These data do not allow an unequivocal conclusion that the q.d regimen provided a clinically relevant 
higher compliance rate versus the b.i.d dosage regimen. 
3.4.2.  Safety Conclusion 
The AE profile of DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d emerging from this Week 48 analysis of study TMC114-C229 
indicates that this dosage for treatment-experienced population with 0 DRV RAMs is at least similar to 
the approved DRV/rtv 600/100 mg b.i.d regimen.  
The envisaged higher rate of gastro-intestinal intolerance after a q.d dosage was not clearly apparent, 
with the exception of a few more discontinuations due to ADRs such as nausea and vomiting.  
Based on this single trial, in a relatively small patient population, the observed small differences in 
gastro-intestinal ADRs and metabolic lipid parameters do not allow the conclusion that the safety 
profile of q.d dosage regimen was significantly superior to the b.i.d dosage regimen in the tested ART–
experienced patient population.  
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176199/2011  
Page 36/38
 
 
 
 
The safety profile for DRV/rtv in this study is in line with the known safety profile for DRV. Differences 
with regard to the frequencies of ADR can be explained by the difference in the intensity of prior ART 
therapy in the studied population. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Regarding the risk of potential overdose and medication errors, the MAH included at the CHMP request 
wording on these risks in Sections 4.2 of the updated SmPC and Section 3 of the Patient Leaflet. In 
addition, these risks were added as potential risk in the RMP.  
At the CHMP request, the MAH also committed to monitor the resistance to DRV and the risk of 
overdose and medication errors and to present them in the PSUR taking into account the dose regimen 
(see Follow Up Measures in Section 4). 
Overall, the clinical safety profile of the DRV/rtv 800 mg strength q.d regimen in ART-experienced 
adult patients with 0 DRV RAMs can be considered acceptable. 
3.5.  Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment  
3.5.1.  Benefit 
The benefit of a simplified treatment regimen with once daily DRV/rtv that provides improved patient 
convenience with enhanced compliance in the proposed treatment-experienced population with 0 DRV 
RAMs would be of appreciable clinical relevance provided that this benefit is unambiguously proven 
throughout the sought indication at large (including patients with increased risk disease 
characteristics). 
Uncertainties concerning the benefit  
The claimed benefit is not unambiguously proven throughout the sought indication at large i.e. patients 
with increased risk disease characteristics such as high viral load > 100,000 copies/ml, CD4 counts at 
the lowest range <50 even <100 cells (x 106/L), 0 number of susceptible NRTIs in the OBR, and clade 
non-B. In response, the MAH restricted the claimed indication in line with the CHMP request.  
The long-term efficacy of DRV/rtv q.d regimen is unknown in the sought target group i.e. ART 
experienced adult patients with 0 DRV RAMs. At the CHMP request, this point is reflected in the SmPC. 
Following discussions with the MAH, the CHMP agreed that the Week-48 data from trial TMC114-C229 
sufficiently support the DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d. indication in the restricted treatment experienced 
population of the revised SmPC and that an additional trial in this population was not deemed 
necessary primarily due to the constrained feasibility and the duration of recruitment for such trial. 
3.5.2.  Risks 
The simplified once lower dosage with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d compared to the approved DRV/rtv 
600/100 mg b.i.d regimen in ART-experienced patients may potentially increase the risk of virologic 
failure due to the development of resistance to DRV and other PIs. Furthermore, a higher single dose 
may induce a higher rate of gastro-intestinal intolerance. 
Uncertainties concerning the Risks 
There is no insurance that the simplified once daily lower dosage with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d, 
compared to the approved DRV/rtv 600/100 mg b.i.d regimen, in ART-experienced patients will not 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176199/2011  
Page 37/38
 
 
 
 
 
increase the risk of virologic failure due to the development of resistance to DRV and other PIs. Hence, 
at the CHMP request, the indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC was restricted. 
At the CHMP request, additional PK/PD data were provided by the MAH. These data seem to indicate 
that this risk is limited to a minority of the patients. However, the number of patients with suboptimal 
exposure was larger in the 800/100 mg q.d group than in the 600/100 mg bid group. Hence, a warning 
in this regard was added in sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC for Prezista. 
The larger number of patients with suboptimal exposure to q.d regimen compared to the 600/100 mg 
b.i.d regimen, which might increase the risk of virologic failure due to the development of resistance to 
DRV and other PIs, remain worrisome. Hence, the RMP was updated accordingly. 
3.5.3.  Benefit-Risk Conclusion 
Based on the review of the clinical efficacy and safety, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk 
balance for the variation application EMEA/H/C/707/II/32 for Prezista (darunavir) is positive for a 
restricted indication for “the treatment of HIV-1 infection in ART-experienced adults with no DRV 
resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs) and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml 
and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l. In deciding to initiate treatment with DRV in such ART-
experienced adults genotypic testing should guide the use of DRV.” 
4.  Conclusion 
On 20 January 2011 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet.

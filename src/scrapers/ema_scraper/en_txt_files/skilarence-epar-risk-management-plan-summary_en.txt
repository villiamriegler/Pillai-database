Summary of risk management plan for Skilarence 30 and 120 mg gastro-resistant tablets 
(dimethyl fumarate) 
This is a summary of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for  Skilarence 30 and 120 mg gastro-
resistant tablets. The RMP details important risks of Skilarence 30 and 120 mg gastro-resistant 
tablets,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about 
Skilarence 30 and 120 mg gastro-resistant tablets's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Skilarence 30 and 120 mg gastro-resistant tablets's Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) 
and its package leaflet give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how 
Skilarence 30 and 120 mg gastro-resistant tablets should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Skilarence 30 and 120 mg gastro-resistant tablets should be read 
in the context of all this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-
language summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Skilarence 
30 and 120 mg gastro-resistant tablets's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Skilarence 30 and 120 mg gastro-resistant tablets are authorised for the treatment of moderate 
to severe plaque psoriasis in adults in need of systemic medicinal therapy (see SmPC for the full 
indication). It contains dimethyl fumarate as the active substance and it is given by oral route of 
administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Skilarence 30 and 120 mg gastro-resistant tablets’s 
benefits can be found in Skilarence 30 and 120 mg gastro-resistant tablets’s EPAR, including in 
its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s  webpage 
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/skilarence). 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the 
risks  
Important risks of Skilarence 30 and 120 mg gastro-resistant tablets, together with measures to 
minimise such risks and the proposed studies for learning more about Skilarence 30 and 120 mg 
gastro-resistant tablets's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  information, such as warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  the  case  of  Skilarence  30  and  120  mg  gastro-resistant  tablets,  these  measures  are 
supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimisation  measures  mentioned  under  relevant  important 
risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Skilarence 30 and 120 mg gastro-resistant 
tablets is not yet available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Skilarence 30 and 120 mg gastro-resistant tablets are risks that need special 
risk management activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product 
can be safely taken. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of  Skilarence 30 and 120 mg 
gastro-resistant tablets. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet 
and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the  safety  of  the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use 
of the medicine);

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Decreases in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts 
Evidence  for  linking  the 
risk to the medicine 
DMF is known to cause reductions in White Blood Cell (WBC) 
count  and  Absolute  Lymphocyte  Count 
(ALC)  values, 
sometimes  below  the  normal  limits  known  as  leukopenia  and 
lymphopenia  respectively.  Significant  ALC  reductions  have 
been  described,  resulting  in grade III  lymphopenia  (ALC  <500 
cells/μL) in approximately 5% of patients [Wright, 2017].

Important potential risk: Malignancies, including renal carcinoma 
Evidence  for  linking  the 
risk to the medicine 
Some  medicines  that  influence  the  immune  system  may 
increase the risk of developing malignancies. This is therefore a 
theoretical  risk  with  Skilarence,  although  currently  there  is  no 
evidence that Skilarence increases the risk of malignancies.

Cancer risk seems to be higher in patients with severe psoriasis. 
Psoriasis  increases  the  risk  for  some  cancers,  such  as  non-
melanoma  skin  cancers  and  alcohol  or  smoking-related 
tumours.  Higher  cancer  risks  in  patients  with  severe  psoriasis 
may be confounded by the effect of systemic treatment [Beyaert, 
2013]. 
Patients  witsh  long-duration  psoriasis  seem  to  be  at  an 
increased risk for kidney cancer [Brauchli, 2009].

renal adverse events, such as acute kidney injury and FS [Balak, 
2016].

risk 
A  number  of  risk  factors  that  predispose  to  chronic  kidney 
disease are especially prevalent in people with severe psoriasis 
including diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease as 
well as use of the nephrotoxic drug, cyclosporine [European S3- 
Guidelines, 2015]. 
Risk factors for drug-induced renal FS include: drug dose and 
duration of therapy, pre-existing renal impairment, reduced renal 
mass,  older  age  or  very  young,  drug  interactions,  low  body 
weight,  volume  depletion  or  underlying  pharmaco-genetic 
factors [Gold, 2014]. Female patients with psoriasis treated long 
term  with  FAEs  seem  to  be  particularly  at  risk  of  FS  [Balak,

Skilarence Post-Authorisation Safety Study in European Psoriasis Registries 
Purpose of the study: 
In  Sept-2017,  Skilarence  obtained  the  Marketing  Authorisation  via  centralised  procedure  in 
Europe,  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  psoriasis.  At  that  time,  there  was  limited 
information on some special populations and with the long term safety use, so the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) requested to obtain data on the long-term safety of 
Skilarence  in  the  post-marketing  setting,  with  a  focus  on  safety  concerns  of  interest  (serious 
infections,  malignancies,  and  all  types  of  renal  injuries)  as  well  as  safety  in  populations  not 
included  in  the  clinical  trials.  Specifically,  Almirall  was  asked  to  explore  different  options  for 
collecting these data and to consider the use of one or more psoriasis-specific patient registers 
to conduct a PASS. 
Retrospective chart review to assess the effectiveness of the Skilarence risk minimisation 
activities in daily practice 
Purpose of the study: 
The aim of this PASS is to assess the effectiveness of risk minimisation measures for Skilarence® 
in  daily  clinical  practice.  The  SmPC  and  an  educational  programme  aim  to  inform  health  care 
professionals about the risk of serious opportunistic infections such as PML, associated with the 
 
 
use  of  Skilarence®  and  to  provide  guidance  on  how  to  minimise  and  manage  this  risk through 
appropriate monitoring of lymphocyte and leukocyte count abnormalities.  
The primary objective of this PASS is:  
•  To  assess  if  physicians  who  prescribe  Skilarence®  follow  the  SmPC  recommendations 
(particularly, laboratory test monitoring according to leukocyte and absolute lymphocyte 
count). 
The secondary objectives of this PASS are:  
•  To  describe  the  characteristics  of  patients  treated  with  Skilarence®  in  routine  clinical 
practice (demographics, disease characteristics, medical history, concomitant diseases, 
concomitant medications). 
•  To assess the average starting dose and the average maintenance dose of Skilarence®. 
•  To assess the incidence of serious infections (including opportunistic infections such as 
PML) in patients treated with Skilarence®. 
•  To  evaluate  the  incidence  of  Adverse  Drug  Reactions  (ADRs)  and  Serious  ADRs 
(SADRs).

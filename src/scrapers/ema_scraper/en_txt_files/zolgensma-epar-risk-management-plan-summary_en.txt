Summary of the risk management plan for Zolgensma® 
(onasemnogene abeparvovec)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Zolgensma. The RMP 
details important risks of Zolgensma, how these risks can be minimised, and how 
more  information  will  be  obtained  about  Zolgensma’s  risks  and  uncertainties 
(missing information).
Zolgensma’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet 
give  essential  information  to  healthcare  professionals  and  patients  on  how 
Zolgensma should be used.
This summary of the RMP for Zolgensma should be read in the context of all this 
information  including  the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-
language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the  European  Public  Assessment  Report 
(EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates 
of Zolgensma’s RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Zolgensma is authorised for the treatment of:
• Patients with 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with a bi-allelic mutation in 
the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene and a clinical diagnosis of SMA 
type 1, or
• Patients with 5q SMA with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene and up to 
3 copies of the survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene. 
It is a gene replacement therapy and it is given by intravenous route. For patients 
who weigh 2.6 to 21.0 kg, the intravenous dosage is determined by patient body 
weight with a nominal recommended dose of 1.1 × 1014 vg/kg.
Further information about the evaluation of Zolgensma’s benefits can be found in 
Zolgensma’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website,

II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterize the risks
Important risks of Zolgensma, together with measures to minimise such risks and 
the proposed studies for learning more about Zolgensma’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct 
use, in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare 
professionals;
•
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so 
to ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(e.g. with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected 
continuously and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment (if applicable) so 
that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as  necessary.  These  measures  constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities.
If  important  information  that  may  affect  the  safe  use  of  Zolgensma’s  is  not  yet 
available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A: List of important risks and missing information
Important  risks  of  Zolgensma  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management 
activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product 
can  be  safely  administered.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or 
potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link 
with the use of Zolgensma. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with  the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this 
association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing 
information  refers  to  information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is 
currently  missing  and  needs  to  be  collected  (e.g.  on  the  long-term  use  of  the 
medicine).

Clinical  trials:  Transient  decreases  in  platelet  counts,  some 
of which met the criteria for thrombocytopenia, were observed 
in onasemnogene abeparvovec clinical studies. In most cases, 
the  lowest  platelet  value  occurred  the  first  week  following 
onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion.
Early  access  programs  and  post-marketing  reports: 
Adverse  events  of  thrombocytopenia  or  decreased  platelet 
counts  are  commonly 
reported  after  onasemnogene 
abeparvovec  administration.  These  events  are  generally  not 
clinically significant.
Post-marketing  cases  with  platelet  counts  < 50  ×  109/L  and 
<25  x  109/L  have  been  reported  to  occur  within  two  weeks 
following onasemnogene abeparvovec administration.

in  23  patients 
Cases  of  TMA  were  reported 
in  the 
post-marketing  setting,  early  access  programs,  and  the 
registry, cumulatively up to DLP 23-May-2022. Of these, in 12 
patients, diagnosis of TMA was supported by available clinical 
details. All 12 confirmed TMA cases were reported within 1-2 
weeks post onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion.
TMA  is  characterized  by  acute  and/or  chronic  uncontrolled 
dysregulation  and/or  excessive  activation  of  the  alternative 
pathway  of  complement,  and  its  etiology  can  be  genetic  or 
acquired, occurring in both children and adults. TMA is a life-
threatening condition, with fatal outcomes reported. In 2020, 
the  incidence  of  TMA  in  children  is  estimated  to  be  three 
cases/million/year. Although the incidence of TMA in children 
with  SMA  is  unknown,  recent  literature  suggests  coagulation 
abnormalities can occur inherently in this population.
A  genetic  predisposition  to  TMA  has  been  associated  with 
mutations  in  the  genes  encoding  complement  factor  H, 
complement factor I, complement factor B, membrane cofactor 
protein,  C3,  and  thrombomodulin,  as  well  as  autoantibodies 
against complement factor H or complement factor I have been 
reported.  In  rare  conditions,  atypical  hemolytic  uremic 
syndrome  is  due  to  mutation  in  diacyglycerol  kinase  ε  or 
deficiency of cobalamin C.
Acquired  TMA  can  occur  in  association  with  a  wide  range  of 
viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections, although it is 
frequently unclear if this is a direct effect of the pathogen, an 
adverse reaction to the treatment of an infection, or a trigger 
that  unmasks  a  latent  complement  defect.  Furthermore, 
encapsulated  organisms  have  been  identified  as  a  trigger; 
capsular  polysaccharide  is  a  critical  virulence  factor  that 
enables immune evasion.
Although an exact mechanism for TMA is unknown, given its 
rarity in the general population, the number of cases reported 
for  the  patients  with  the  rare  disease  (SMA),  and  similar 
pattern of time to onset of TMA, a causal association between 
onasemnogene abeparvovec and TMA is plausible.

Clinical:  Patients  with  AAV9  titres  >  1:50  have  not  been 
studied  in  onasemnogene  abeparvovec  clinical  studies.  After 
administration  of  onasemnogene  abeparvovec,  increases  in 
anti-AAV9 antibody titres were observed. This is considered an 
expected response, and there were no apparent relationships 
between anti-AAV9 antibody titre and safety or efficacy. It is 
not  known  whether  administration  of  the  onasemnogene 
abeparvovec  vector  represents  a  risk  for  patients  with  anti-
AAV9 antibodies at higher titres.

Important potential risk: Dorsal root ganglia toxicity
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Clinical:  No  adverse  events  suggestive  of  ganglionopathy 
were  observed  in  patients  treated  with  onasemnogene 
abeparvovec  from  clinical  trials,  early  access  programs, 
registry  and  post-marketing  clinical  experience  in  whom 
treatment with steroids was administered.
All  available  autopsy  reports  of  fatal  cases  in  the  post 
marketing  setting  are  being  monitored  for  evidence  of  DRG 
toxicity. A limited number of autopsy reports received for the 
post-marketing  cases  until  23  May  2022  did  not  indicate 
histological evidence of DRG toxicity.
Non-clinical: 
i.v. 
In  cynomolgus  monkeys, 
administration  of  onasemnogene  abeparvovec  has  been 
associated  with  clinically  silent  (asymptomatic)  microscopic 
changes  in  the  dorsal  root  ganglia  (DRG)  and/or  trigeminal 
ganglia.  The  findings  in  the  DRG  (at  all  levels)  and/or 
i.t.  and 
trigeminal  ganglia  included  mononuclear  cell  inflammation, 
neuronal degeneration, satellitosis, and/or neuronal necrosis. 
These  non-clinical  DRG  findings  have  not  been  confirmed  in 
patients  from  both  clinical  trials  as  well  as  post-marketing 
experience.
Based on data accumulated so far from the GLP non-human 
primate studies at terminal intervals up to 6 weeks post dose, 
the OAV101-related DRG finding is reclassified from “DRG cell 
inflammation” to “DRG toxicity” given that the microscopic 
findings are generally characterized by mononuclear cell 
inflammation, neuronal degeneration, satellitosis, neuronal 
loss, gliosis and/or axonal degeneration. In addition, 
secondary changes in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves of 
axon degeneration have been observed.

Important potential risk: Tumorigenicity due to 
chromosomal integration
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
There is a theoretical risk of tumorigenicity due to integration 
of AAV vector DNA into the genome. 
Onasemnogene abeparvovec is composed of a non-replicating 
AAV9 vector whose DNA persists largely in episomal form. Rare 
instances  of  random  vector  integration  into  human  DNA  are 
possible  with  recombinant  AAV.  The  clinical  relevance  of

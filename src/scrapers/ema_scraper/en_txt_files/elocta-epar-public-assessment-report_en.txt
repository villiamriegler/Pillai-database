2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Haemophilia A is an inherited sex-linked disorder of blood coagulation in which affected males (very rarely 
females) do not produce functional coagulation FVIII in sufficient quantities to achieve satisfactory 
haemostasis. The incidence of congenital haemophilia A is approximately 1 in 10,000 births. Disease severity 
is classified according to the level of FVIII activity (% of normal) as mild (>5% to <40%), moderate (1% to 
5%) or severe (<1%). This deficiency in FVIII predisposes patients with haemophilia A to recurrent bleeding 
episodes in joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical 
trauma.  
Without adequate treatment these repeated haemarthroses and haematomas lead to long-term sequelae with 
severe disability. Other less frequent, but more severe bleeding sites, are the central nervous system, the 
urinary or gastrointestinal tract, eyes and the retro-peritoneum. Patients with haemophilia A are at high risk 
of developing major and life-threatening bleeds after surgical procedures, even after minor procedures such 
as tooth extraction. 
The development of cryoprecipitate and subsequently FVIII concentrates, obtained by fractionation of human 
plasma, provided replacement FVIII and greatly improved clinical management and life expectancy of 
patients with haemophilia A. Current treatment approaches focus on either prophylactic or on demand factor 
replacement therapy with plasma-derived FVIII or recombinant FVIII products. In the short term, prophylaxis 
can prevent spontaneous bleeding and in the long term, prophylaxis can prevent bleeding into joints that will 
eventually lead to debilitating arthropathy.  
Prophylaxis with FVIII concentrates is currently the preferred treatment regimen for patients with severe 
haemophilia A, especially in very young patients. The majority of patients receiving prophylaxis are treated 
3-times weekly or every other day at a dose of 25–40 international units (IU)/kg (or 15–25 IU/kg in an 
intermediate dose regimen), although an escalating dose regimen is also used. However, on-demand 
treatment is still the predominant replacement approach in many countries. 
The most serious complication in the treatment of haemophilia A is the development of neutralising 
antibodies (inhibitors) against FVIII, rendering the patient resistant to replacement therapy and thereby 
increasing the risk of unmanageable bleeding, particularly arthropathy, and disability.  
ELOCTA (efmoroctocog alfa) is a recombinant human coagulation factor VIII Fc fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) 
consisting of B-domain deleted FVIII covalently attached to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1 
Assessment report

(IgG1) thus aiming at prolongation of plasma half-life. It has been developed as a long-acting version of 
recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes, routine prophylaxis, and 
perioperative management (surgical prophylaxis) in individuals with hemophilia A.  
ELOCTA is formulated as powder for intravenous administration in a single-use vial. Each single-use vial 
contains nominally 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, or 3000 International Units (IU) of rFVIIIFc for 
reconstitution with a solvent (Sterile Water for Injections), which is provided in a pre-filled syringe. 
In 2013, national scientific advice was sought from the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products 
Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Swedish Medicinal Products Agency, and German Paul-Ehrlich-Institute. No 
substantial deviations from the advices provided could be identified. 
On 2 April 2014, the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) of the European Medicines Agency adopted a favourable 
opinion on the modification of an agreed paediatric investigation plan (PIP) (P/0077/2014) and a partially 
completed compliance procedure was finalised on 16-18 July 2014 (EMEA-C1-001114-PIP01-10-MO2). 
Completed studies, Study 997HA301 and Study 8HA02PED, and the initiation of Study 8HA01EXT are 
considered compliant with EMA Decision P/0077/2014. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The active substance of ELOCTA, efmoroctocog alfa, is a recombinant human coagulation factor VIII, Fc 
fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) comprising B-domain deleted (BDD) human FVIII covalently linked to the Fc domain 
of human immunoglobulin G1(IgG1). It has been developed as a long-acting version of recombinant FVIII 
(rFVIII). 
ELOCTA is formulated as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, preservative-free, lyophilized, white to off-white powder to 
cake for intravenous administration in a single-use vial. Each single-use vial contains nominally 250, 500, 
750, 1000, 1500, 2000, or 3000 International Units (IU) of rFVIIIFc for reconstitution with liquid diluent 
(Sterile Water for Injection), which is provided in a pre-filled syringe. 
The finished medicinal product consists of a package containing a rFVIIIFc drug product vial, a pre-filled 
diluent (SWFI) syringe and medical devices (a plunger rod, a vial adapter (used as a transfer device during 
reconstitution), an infusion set, alcohol swabs, plasters and gauze pad for intravenous administration).  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
In summary, the Applicant submitted sufficient information on nomenclature and general properties. 
Structure 
The active substance of Elocta, efmoroctocog alfa, is a recombinant human coagulation factor VIII, Fc fusion 
protein (rFVIIIFc) comprised of a single molecule of B-domain deleted human Factor VIII (BDD FVIII) fused 
to the dimeric Fc region of human IgG1 with no intervening linker sequence.  
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015 
Page 9/132 
  
  
 
 
The rFVIIIFc protein has a molecular weight of approximately 220 kDa.  rFVIIIFc is synthesized as 2 
polypeptide chains, one chain consisting of BDD FVIII fused to the N-terminal of human IgG1 Fc domain the 
other chain consisting of the same Fc region alone.  
The two subunits of rFVIIIFc, FVIIIFc single chain and Fc single chain, are associated through disulfide bonds 
in the hinge region of Fc as well as through extensive noncovalent interactions between the Fc fragments.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturer 
The manufacturing and testing sites of the active substance and the responsibilities of each site were listed in 
the dossier. Valid GMP certificates were presented for all sites.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The description of the active substance manufacturing process is considered adequate. Main production steps 
include fermentation, purification, steps for virus inactivation  and virus removal, concentration, formulation, 
filtration and filling. The batch size was defined. Process flow diagrams for the different steps of the 
manufacturing process were provided.  
Control of materials 
The lists of compendial and non-compendial raw materials used during the production of rFVIIIFc were 
included in the dossier. For non-compendial materials, the control test that have been performed and the in-
house specifications were also submitted. 
No materials of animal origin are used during the cell banking or in the manufacture of the rFVIIIFc active 
substance.  
In general, the description and control of the expression construct is in accordance with guideline ICH Q5B 
(Quality of Biotechnological Products: Analysis of the Expression Construct in Cell Lines Used for Production 
of r-DNA-Derived Protein Products). The origin and the description of coding sequences as well as the cloning 
strategy for the expression plasmid were given.  
A two-tiered cell-banking system is used, consisting of a MCB and a WCB which are both stored at two 
different locations. The documentation provided supports in general compliance with guideline ICH Q5D 
(Quality of Biotechnological Products: Derivation and Characterization of Cell Substrates Used for Production 
of Biotechnological/Biological Products).  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Following early product and process development, a product risk assessment was performed to identify 
Critical Product Quality Attributes (CQA). Once CQAs were identified, initial process and product risk 
assessments were performed and used in conjunction with early manufacturing and development knowledge 
to identify and rank parameters that may potentially affect process consistency and product quality. Based on 
these assessments, a subset of parameters was selected for further evaluation in statistically designed 
process characterization studies using scaled-down models of the manufacturing steps. The results of the 
characterization studies were used to further refine the parameter classification. A control strategy was then 
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015 
Page 10/132 
  
  
 
 
 
developed for parameters based upon their final classification, i.e. critical, key, non-key. Although this 
classification is not in line with ICH terminology, it was considered acceptable for the control strategy of this 
particular product. In addition, the process controls and the acceptable ranges for the operation of critical 
steps in the rFVIIIFc active substance manufacturing process were indicated. 
The selected control parameters for the different cell culture steps were considered appropriate to ensure 
manufacturing process consistency and performance within the expected ranges. 
The control strategy for the different rFVIIIFc purification steps was presented.. In addition, the in-process 
controls and tests for these steps were shown with the action limits and/or in-process specifications. The 
selected control parameters for the different chromatographic steps are considered appropriate to ensure 
manufacturing process consistency. Overall, the control strategy was considered acceptable. 
Process validation 
In general, the active substance manufacturing process is considered sufficiently validated. Process validation 
was comprised of impurity clearance validation, process consistency validation, chromatography and filter 
lifetime validation and the stability evaluation of process intermediates. 
Clearance of process impurities was either directly confirmed by measurement in manufacturing scale process 
intermediates or by measurement in laboratory scale spiking studies or both. 
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process development has been sufficiently outlined. The description and the comparisons 
of active substance manufacturing processes and batch utilization of material used for clinical and nonclinical 
studies were submitted. Operating parameters known to impact process consistency and product quality were 
maintained between the pilot and full scale processes. Comparability of the rFVIIIFc active substance batches 
manufactured using the commercial process and the clinical active substance batches was demonstrated by 
release test results, in-process testing, and a variety of characterization assays.  
Characterisation 
rFVIIIFc was extensively characterised by physicochemical methods in accordance with guideline ICH Q6B. 
The structural characterisation and the physicochemical properties confirmed the expected properties for a 
recombinant FVIIIFc product. In general, the characterization performed was considered appropriate for this 
complex fusion molecule. The panel of tests was comprehensive and covered most of its structural and 
functional attributes. The comparability between representative batches from development and commercial 
manufacture (including process validation batches) as well as with rFVIIIFc reference materials was 
demonstrated. 
The biological activity was analysed by the FVIII one stage clotting assay (activated partial thromboplastin 
time (aPTT)), the FVIII chromogenic assay and the FcRn binding assay. Additional in vitro functional tests 
were performed comprising the binding to von Willebrand factor and the generation of Factor Xa. 
Since it is anticipated that the potency of modified products measured by the one stage clotting assay (aPTT) 
may be dependent on the choice of the aPTT reagent, the ISTH recommends for all new FVIII products to 
perform a study including assay variations (different aPTT reagents) for FVIII testing when using the 
coagulation assay. Respective studies were provided by the Applicant in Module 5 (no significant dependence 
on the aPTT reagent was observed). 
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015 
Page 11/132 
  
  
 
 
In addition, the impurity profile regarding product- and process-related impurities was appropriately 
investigated. Detailed results and discussions regarding the identity and levels of individual impurities as well 
as the safety assessment for the process-related-impurities based on the clearance validation were provided. 
Specification 
The rFVIIIFc active substance specifications used for release and stability testing are considered appropriate 
including adequate tests for integrity, potency, purity and quality. The release and stability parameters and 
their specifications are in accordance with guideline ICH Q6B and seem adequate for the control of the active 
substance as shown with the provided batch analysis data. 
The acceptance criteria for the control parameters are based on historical data including preclinical and 
clinical batches from process development as well as from process validation batches and further commercial 
batches.  
Analytical methods 
The active substance is tested using pharmacopoeia and non-pharmacopoeia analytical methods. Method 
validations were provided.  
Reference materials 
The strategy for establishing and maintaining reference standards for release and stability testing of 
commercial rFVIIIFc active substance and drug product was sufficiently described.   
A primary reference standard (PRS) was established in order to ensure that the quality of the active 
substance remains consistent and to avoid a drift in quality over time. Working reference standards (WRS) 
are established for routine release and stability testing of active substance which are qualified against the 
primary reference standard, and the stability of both reference materials is monitored to assess the suitability 
of these reference standards over their lifetime.   
The potency of PRS was assigned by chromogenic assay to the WHO 8th International Factor VIII 
Concentrate Standard by a statistically valid assay. Thus, traceability to the International Standard was 
considered established and the use of International Units (IU) for potency labelling of rFVIIIFc justified. This 
is in line with CHMP guidance (EMA/CHMP/BWP/85290/2012) and the official communication from the SCC 
(Hubbard, 2013). 
The PRS has undergone release testing and extensive characterization studies A critical criterion for the 
selection of PRS was the consistent specific activity values measured by two distinct assays: activated partial 
thromboplastin (aPTT) coagulation assay and FVIII chromogenic assay. This will allow its use as potency 
calibration standard using either assay. 
Container closure system 
Sufficient information on container closure system of the active substance was submitted.  rFVIIIFc active 
substance is stored frozen in a container made of polycarbonate equipped with polypropylene cap. The 
container closure system has been evaluated by means characterization of extractable and leachables 
substances. All testing performed indicate the container closure is appropriate for use for the storage of 
rFVIIIFc active substance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015 
Page 12/132 
  
  
 
 
Stability 
The applicant submitted sufficient active substance stability data which justify approval of a shelf life of 36 
months at -70 °C ± 10 °C.  
Comparability exercise for Active Substance 
Extensive comparability studies in compliance with the guideline ICH Q5E were performed in order to 
investigate the impact of process changes introduced during development on the product quality. The process 
changes and their rationale were appropriately described. The stability data, the release results, the in-
process testing and characterization of rFVIIIFc clinical and commercial active substance batches indicated 
that these materials are comparable. Therefore, the active substance manufactured by the validated 
manufacturing process intended for commercial production is representative of active substance 
manufactured for clinical use. Furthermore, the process can be considered consistent and reproducible and 
yields active substance of adequate quality.  
New Active Substance 
The Applicant stated that, efmoroctocog alfa, is a biological substance not previously authorised as a 
medicinal product in the European Union and requested that efmoroctocog alfa contained in the Elocta to be 
considered a new active substance (NAS) in itself. 
Efmoroctocog alfa is a fully recombinant fusion protein comprising B-domain deleted (BDD) human FVIII 
covalently linked to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). 
Based on the assessment of the submitted data CHMP concluded that efmoroctocog alfa is a new active 
substance that has not been authorised European Union previously. From a quality perspective, it can be 
regarded as a NAS in itself.  
2.2.1.  Finished Medicinal Product

Pharmaceutical development 
The pharmaceutical development has been sufficiently described.  
Briefly, in the different stages of drug product development material produced at the commercial scale was 
used. . Comparability studies  indicated that phase 1+2 and, in particular, phase 3 clinical trial material and 
commercial product were manufactured by the same process and were of comparable quality. 
A formulation buffer has been developed with components free of human-and animal-derived material. 
Development studies on the lyophilisation process have led to a robust commercial freeze-drying process 
which resulted in a product with consistent quality attributes that were comparable to drug product generated 
at pilot scale.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturer 
The drug product manufacturing, release testing and secondary packaging sites were listed in the dossier and 
GMP certificates were submitted.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The finished product manufacturing process has been adequately described and flow charts submitted. 
Briefly, the manufacturing process covers the following steps: thawing and pooling of active substance, 
compounding of drug product, sterile filtration, filling, lyophilisation, stoppering and crimping, visual 
inspection and bulk packaging (vials), quarantine storage, bulk packaging (finished medicinal product 
assembly) and shipping.  
With respect to process control, the rationale for the classification of process parameters and quality 
attributes appeared reasonable and the action limits or specifications were adequately set. Based on the 
outcome it seems that the entire rFVIIIFc drug product manufacturing can be run under well controlled and 
aseptic conditions to assure a sterile finished product of consistent quality.  
The process hold times for intermediates and finished product have been sufficiently justified based on data 
from the validated full scale process, media fills, and from small scale stability studies. 
Process validation 
Based on knowledge gained during development and early full scale production batches, so-called input 
parameters and output parameters were defined and were classified according to their criticality. This 
criticality is based on a risk analysis with respect to the impact of a parameter on process performance and 
product quality. The approach is in line with ICH Q8(R2) Guideline on pharmaceutical development.  
During process validation the commercial manufacturing process, commercial batches were evaluated for 
process consistency, hold time, and aseptic manufacturing conditions. The applicant has demonstrated that 
the manufacturing process of rFVIIIFc drug product operates within established parameters and performs 
reproducibly under controlled conditions, leading to a product that meets all quality attributes. Therefore the 
presented data provide assurance that the commercial manufacturing process has been successfully 
validated.  
The media fill runs demonstrated that aseptic manufacturing conditions could be maintained, also when 
performing simulated interventions during filling as “worst case” conditions.

Control of excipients 
Only excipients manufactured and tested according to Ph. Eur. are used. No novel excipients or excipients of 
human or animal origin are used for the manufacture of rFVIIIFc drug product. 
Product specification 
The information presented in section Control of Drug Product was sufficiently detailed to provide assurance 
that the quality of the drug product is well controlled. A risk based approach (FMECA) has been applied in line 
with ICH Q9 Quality risk management to define analytical parameters which were considered critical with 
respect to the quality of the drug product. Acceptance criteria for critical quality attributes were derived from 
structure-activity relationship, animal studies, clinical experience, safety considerations, compendial 
requirements, and experience from literature. Based on the outcome of this analysis a set of control 
parameters for drug product release and stability testing was defined. Overall, this set of release tests 
appeared sufficient to assure drug product quality and safety. However, it is recommended that the Applicant 
re-evaluates the protein content specification of the drug product, as soon as data from 30 lots of each 
dosage size are available (see 2.2.6).  
Analytical methods 
All test methods applied during batch release (and stability testing) are compendial or were validated in line 
with ICH Q2(R) recommendations.  
The Ph. Eur. FVIII chromogenic assay was adequately re-validated against the in house reference standard to 
support the applicability of this assay to the rFVIIIFc fusion protein. As an outcome, the parameter linearity 
and all other parameters tested on the drug product passed the validation acceptance criteria, indicating that 
the compendial method can be used in potency determination of rFVIIIFc drug product. 
Batch analysis 
The release test results were considered adequate. All results met the release specifications in place at time 
of testing. 
Reference materials 
The reference standard used for testing of the drug product is the same as the reference standard used for 
testing of the active substance (see above).  
Container closure system 
The container closure system has been sufficiently described. The rFVIIIFc drug product vial for all dosage 
sizes from 250 IU to 3000 IU per vial is a 10 ml Ph.Eur type I glass vial, closed with a chlorobutyl rubber 
stopper, sealed with an aluminium flip-off cap.  
Stability of the product 
Sufficient stability data were submitted to support the shelf life claim given in the SmPC. 
A 36-month shelf life was proposed for rFVIIIFc lyophilized drug product (all strengths:250 through 3000 
IU/vial) when stored at 2 to 8 ºC, with allowance of short-term storage for up to 6 months at room 
temperature (not to exceed 30 ºC) within the proposed 36-month shelf life. 
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015 
Page 15/132 
  
  
 
 
The stability of rFVIIIFc drug product has been investigated in line with ICH Q 5C.  
A stability study to evaluate in use shelf life with vials at the end of shelf life  justifies the proposed in use 
shelf life of 6 h at RT (not to exceed 30°C).  
In line with ICH Q5C photo-stability studies were performed which indicated that the lyophilised product is 
light sensitive, requiring proper storage of the product in its outer carton. Respective information is given in 
the product information. 
Adventitious agents 
TSE compliance 
Compliance with the TSE Guideline (EMEA/410/01 – rev. 3) has been sufficiently demonstrated. The active 
substance is produced in a serum-free fermentation medium. No other material of bovine origin is added 
during fermentation process of rFVIIIFc. The MCB which has been established is free from TSE-risk 
substances. 
Virus safety 
As stated above, the fermentation of rFVIIIFc takes place in a serum-free medium and no other material of 
bovine origin is added during fermentation process of rFVIIIFc. This minimizes a possible contamination for 
adventitious viruses. The cells used for production of rFVIIIFc have been sufficiently screened for viruses. 
These tests failed to demonstrate the presence of any viral contaminant in the MCB of rFVIIIFc.  
There is sufficient capacity within the manufacturing process of rFVIIIFc for reduction of viral particles. The 
purification process of rFVIIIFc includes several steps for inactivation/removal of enveloped viruses. The 
effectiveness of these steps has been sufficiently demonstrated. Studies of reuse of chromatography resins 
have been provided. 
In summary, the virus safety of rFVIIIFc has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
Drug product - Solvent WfI in a pre-filled Syringe 
The drug product solvent is sterilised Water for Injections (sWFI). The container closure system consists of a 
glass vial, a plunger stopper and a closure system of a tip cap with a Luer lock and a tamper-evident seal. 
The information provided in the dossier for the solvent showed that the sWFI is manufactured under GMP 
compliant conditions using a validated process.  
The sWFI in a 3 ml pre-filled syringe (3 ml fill volume) meets E.P. requirements for sterile WFI and has a 
shelf life of 60 month when stored at 2-8°C. Within this 60 months shelf-life, the sWFI may be stored at 
room temperature (not to exceed 30°C) for up to 6 months when packaged with the rFVIIIFc drug product. 
The proposed shelf life conditions were supported by real time stability data. 
2.2.1.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with 
existing guidelines.  
Assessment report

The fermentation, recovery and purification of the active substance, efmoroctocog alfa, are adequately 
controlled and validated. Appropriate active substance specifications have been set. The physicochemical and 
biological characteristics of the active substance have been well characterised using state-of the-art methods.  
The manufacturing process of the drug product has been described and validated in sufficient detail. The 
quality of the drug product is controlled by adequate test methods and specifications. The data presented 
support the shelf-life proposed for the active substance and drug product.  
No excipients or raw materials of human or animal origin are used in the manufacturing process and 
therefore the risk of contamination with viral or TSE agents is considered negligible. 
In summary, the information provided in the application demonstrates consistent batch-to-batch production 
achieving a well-defined quality of the finished medicinal product. 
2.2.2.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of Elocta is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in 
the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance 
on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.3.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:  
1. 
It is recommended that the applicant should re-evaluate the protein content specification of the drug 
product, as soon as data from 30 lots of each dosage size are available. A time line should be specified 
and a re-evaluation report should be sent to the Competent Authority 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical program included pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic, and toxicology studies 
performed in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. 
Pivotal repeat-dose toxicology studies including PK assessments were conducted as GLP studies while primary 
pharmacodynamics, other PK studies and pilot toxicology studies were conducted as non-GLP studies. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The non-clinical pharmacology evaluation of rFVIIIFc focused on the primary pharmacodynamics (PD) of 
rFVIIIFc with the aim to evaluate rFVIIIFc as a treatment for acute bleeding, as well as a long-acting pro-

coagulant agent for prophylaxis therapy. To support drug manufacturing changes, in vivo comparability 
studies were conducted to complement analytical and biochemical evaluation of rFVIIIFc. In addition, a 
purified non-processed single chain isoform of rFVIIIFc (SC rFVIIIFc) was evaluated. 
In vitro pharmacology studies were performed to demonstrate that rFVIIIFc is similar to rFVIII (Xyntha and 
ReFacto) in biochemical activity assays. In vivo pharmacology studies were performed to evaluate the 
clotting activity of rFVIIIFc in HemA mice and dogs, as well as to evaluate the acute and prophylactic efficacy 
of rFVIIIFc in HemA mice bleeding models.  
The fusion of recombinant BDD FVIII to the Fc domain of IgG1 has been shown to decrease the in vivo 
clearance of this protein. rFVIIIFc was characterized in a series of in vitro biochemical binding and activity 
assays using pure proteins, phospholipids, and plasma, which were chosen to correlate with its pro-coagulant 
function in vivo.

Description of single chain rFVIIIFc (SC rFVIIIFc) in rFVIIIFc 
In preparations of rFVIIIFc drug substance (DS), a fraction of the total rFVIIIFc is not cleaved at Arg 1648, 
leading to the generation of the single chain isoform (SC rFVIIIFc). rFVIIIFc contains ≤40% SC rFVIIIFc. In 
order to characterize the single chain isoform of rFVIIIFc, a preparation of 100% SC rFVIIIFc was purified 
from rFVIIIFc. 
In vitro functional characterization (R-FR8-009, R-FR8-010, R-FR8-017, R-FR8-028, R-FR8-029, R-FR8-024-
R2, R-FR8-011 
The potency of rFVIIIFc was measured with both chromogenic and aPTT assays and found to be comparable. 
In order to further characterize the in vitro activity of rFVIIIFc, both rFVIIIFc and SC rFVIIIFc were compared 
to rFVIII in a series of biochemical assays. The thrombin activation profiles for rFVIIIFc, SC rFVIIIFc and BDD 
rFVIII (ReFacto) were similar based on SDS-PAGE and sequence analysis. In activity assays, the affinities 
(Kd) for FIXa during formation of the tenase complex and the Km and Vmax for FX activation by tenase on 
phospholipids or activated platelets were similar for rFVIIIFc, SC rFVIIIFc and BDD rFVIII. The cleavage of 
the A2 domain by APC and inactivation of the active forms of rFVIIIFc, SC rFVIIIFc and BDD rFVIII were 
similar. The results of these biochemical mechanism studies were all consistent with the potency of rFVIIIFc 
in the aPTT and chromogenic activity assays. 
The activities of rFVIIIFc, SC rFVIIIFc and purified processed rFVIIIFc were all similar in the chromogenic 
activity assay and in the aPTT assay in the absence of VWF. However, up to a 60% reduction in activity was 
observed for SC rFVIIIFc in the aPTT assay in the presence of VWF when compared to rFVIIIFc. Therefore, 
studies were performed to compare the interaction of rFVIIIFc, SC rFVIIIFc and rFVIII with VWF. 
The binding of VWF to rFVIIIFc, SC rFVIIIFc and rFVIII was measured by Real-time SPR analysis and was 
compared and the binding kinetics and the affinities (Kd) for VWF all were found to be similar for rFVIIIFc, SC 
rFVIIIFc and BDD rFVIII by SPR (0.34, 0.31 and 0.26 nM, respectively).  
Thrombin cleavage increases the rate of release of FVIII from VWF by up to 160-fold by release of the acidic 
a3 domain. The addition of α-thrombin to rFVIIIFc, SC rFVIIIFc or BDD rFVIII (Xyntha) bound to VWF 
increased the off-rate in a thrombin concentration dependent manner. The release rate of SC rFVIIIFc from 
VWF was found to be 3-fold less responsive than rFVIIIFc and BDD rFVIII to the thrombin concentration. This 
decreased responsiveness of SC rFVIIIFc to release from VWF by thrombin is due to delayed release of the 
acidic a3 domain following cleavage at Arg 1689. Because the site at Arg 1648 is still intact in SC rFVIIIFc, 
the release of the a3 domain requires cleavage at both Arg 1689 and Arg 740 by thrombin. 
The affinity of rFVIIIFc for the extracellular domains of purified human, cynomolgus monkey, mouse and rat 
FcRn were determined. Half-maximal binding was found to be ~50 nM for human and cynomolgus monkey 
FcRn and ~11 nM for rat and mouse FcRn. The finding that rFVIIIFc bound more tightly to murine than 
human and monkey FcRn is consistent with literature reports for human IgG molecules.

Clotting activity in treated HemA mice by WBCT (R-FR8-014 and R-FR8-016) 
Recombinant FVIIIFc was compared for clotting efficacy with ReFacto in FVIII-deficient mice using a single 
intravenous dose of 50 IU/kg (n=6) and measuring whole blood clotting time (WBCT). FVIII-deficient mice 
given rFVIIIFc maintained normal clotting times for over 96 hours with 67% of mice clotting normally through 
115 hours, whereas 100% of mice given ReFacto lost clotting capacity at 42 hours post-injection showing a 
2.7 fold improvement in WBCT with rFVIIIFc compared to ReFacto. 
Similarly, in chromogenic assay studies using a single 50 IU/kg intravenous dose, FVIII deficient mice had 
FVIII activity through 72 hours with rFVIIIFc and no detectable FVIII activity with Advate or ReFacto at 48 
hours. Factor VIII-deficient mice given rFVIIIFc showed a dose response in FVIII activity levels at 50 IU/kg 
and 250 IU/kg. However, mice given 1000 IU/kg had similar FVIII activity levels as mice given the 250 IU/kg 
dose, which may be due to saturation of VWF binding sites at the highest dose with concomitant rapid 
clearance of unbound rFVIIIFc via clearance receptors for FVIII. 
Clotting activity of NP rFVIIIFc was evaluated in study R-FR8-016 in FVIII-deficient mice using chromogenic 
activity assays and WBCT. Using a single intravenous dose of 250 IU/kg, NP rFVIIIFc had similar activity as 
rFVIIIFc DS in chromogenic activity assays. Further, after a single intravenous dose of 50 IU/kg, normal 
clotting activity was maintained for 96 hours with NP rFVIIIFc, which had a similar WBCT profile as rFVIIIFc

DS. Thus, in mice with severe hemophilia A, NP rFVIIIFc and rFVIIIFc exerted similar capacities for reducing 
the time to clot formation ex vivo. 
Clotting activity in treated HemA mice by ROTEM (N-FR8-010-R1 and N-FR8-013) 
rFVIIIFc DP liquid and lyophilized, Xyntha, and Advate had comparable effects on clot formation and stability. 
At 72 and 96 hours, rFVIIIFc DP (liquid and lyophilized) significantly improved clotting compared to Advate 
and Xyntha. Results from a second whole blood clotting study in HemA mice demonstrated in vivo 
comparability of rFVIIIFc from the VLA5 manufacturing process and lyophilized DP from the RVS2 
manufacturing process and Advate, having similar acute activity versus Advate (up to 24 hours) and 
prolonged activity at later timepoints.  
Clotting activity of rFVIIIFc and ReFacto in HemA dogs (N-FR8-003) 
In a crossover design study, 4 dogs with severe hemophilia A were given a single intravenous dose of 114-
120 IU/kg ReFacto and 3 days later a single dose of 125 IU/kg rFVIIIFc. Blood clotting was measured using 
both WBCT and chromogenic activity assays. With rFVIIIFc, WBCT corrected to normal for 72-102 hours, 
whereas ReFacto, supported normalization of WBCT for 48 hours. Chromogenic assay studies show that the 
terminal half-life for rFVIIIFc was 15.4 ± 0.3 hours compared to ReFacto with 7.4 hours. Pharmacodynamic 
profiles of the clotting activity over time for rFVIIIFc and ReFacto correlated well with the concentration of 
rFVIII (ELISA). Overall, in dogs with severe hemophilia A, initially both rFVIIIFc and FVIII similarly reduced 
blood clot formation time, however, rFVIIIFc increased the duration of this effect 1.5-2.1 fold as compared to 
ReFacto. 
Efficacy studies of rFVIIIFc in bleeding models in HemA mice 
The activity of rFVIIIFc in the acute bleeding model was found to be comparable to Advate as anticipated 
from their similar in vitro biochemical activities in coagulation assays. In the prophylactic model, rFVIIIFc was 
observed to result in approximately 2-fold longer protection than Advate, based on the effective dose (ED50) 
for survival, which is consistent with the prolonged whole blood clotting activity in HemA mice. 
Acute efficacy of rFVIIIFc in the tail clip bleeding model of HemA mice (R-FR8-019-R1 and N-FR8-012) 
The acute clotting efficacy of lyophilized rFVIIIFc DP and Advate were compared using a well-established tail 
clip bleeding model. Following an intravenous administration of 24, 72, or 216 IU/kg at 5 minutes prior to the 
tail clip, the blood loss from FVIII-deficient mice treated with rFVIIIFc or Advate was measured 
gravimetrically and the percentage of the protected population was calculated. Both rFVIIIFc and Advate 
treatments result in a significant reduction of blood loss as well as the increase in the percent of protected 
population. Overall, in the dose range (24 – 216 IU/kg) tested, rFVIIIFc and Advate have shown comparable 
efficacy by both measurements. 
A second acute efficacy study in HemA mice was used to compare the efficacy of lyophilized DP from the 
VLA5 and RVS2 manufacturing processes. Animals were given a single IV dose of 0, 25, 50, or 100 IU/kg 
rFVIIIFc DP from VLA5 at the 2000 IU/vial strength or RVS2 at the 3000 IU/vial strength. Mice given either 
DP from VLA5 or RVS2 had reduced blood loss in a dose-dependent manner with significant reductions in 
bleeding at 25, 50, and 100 IU/kg. Statistical analyses comparing the results obtained using DP from both 
processes demonstrated that there were no differences at any of the doses tested. Thus, rFVIIIFc DP from 
VLA5 and RVS2 demonstrated comparable acute efficacy in a HemA mice tail clip bleeding model.

Prophylactic efficacy of rFVIIIFc in a tail vein transection model of HemA mice (R-FR8-022-R1 and R-FR8-
023-R1) 
The HemA mice tail vein transection (TVT) model was used to compare the abilities of rFVIIIFc and Advate to 
prevent bleeding and mortality when administered 1 or 2 days prior to TVT in HemA mice. A single 12 IU/kg 
IV infusion of rFVIIIFc administered 24 or 48 hours before TVT was compared to Advate administered 24 
hours before TVT. Mice were observed for 24 hours post-TVT and scored for both survival and re-bleeding 
following the initial clot formation. Overall, the data showed that a single dose of rFVIIIFc corrects the FVIII 
deficiency and protects against severe bleeding approximately 2-fold longer compared to a single dose of 
Advate. There was no significant difference in re-bleeding rate or survival for HemA mice dosed with rFVIIIFc 
at 48 hours before injury and those dosed with Advate 24 hours pre-TVT. The responses for the high and low 
doses (36 and 4 IU/kg) were similar and both survival and re-bleeding rates were not significantly different 
for rFVIIIFc at 48 hours and Advate at 24 hours. 
The TVT model was also used to compare the prophylactic efficacy of pure SC rFVIIIFc with that of rFVIIIFc 
containing 25.1% of the single chain isoform. The whole blood clotting activity observed for rFVIIIFc and SC 
rFVIIIFc indicated a similar ability of each to correct the clotting deficiency in HemA mice. Both rFVIIIFc and 
SC rFVIIIFc were dosed at 0.46, 1.38 and 4.6 μg/kg at 48 hours prior to TVT injury. For rFVIIIFc, these 3 
doses corresponded to 4.39, 13.2 and 43.9 IU/kg, respectively. A similar dose response was observed for 
both rFVIIIFc and SC rFVIIIFc, based on either the re-bleeding rates or survival (Figure 10). No differences 
were found for either parameter at any of the 3 doses tested.  
Overall, comparison of rFVIIIFc and rFVIII in a prophylactic efficacy model in HemA mice demonstrated a 2-
fold prolonged efficacy for rFVIIIFc versus Advate. Additionally, SC rFVIIIFc is equally efficacious to rFVIIIFc 
and the presence of SC rFVIIIFc in rFVIIIFc contributes fully to the prolonged efficacy observed for rFVIIIFc. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been submitted.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Based on its mechanism of action as a replacement factor to restore coagulation activity, separate safety 
pharmacology studies to investigate possible effects of rFVIIIFc on the cardiovascular, respiratory, or central 
nervous systems were not performed (See discussion on non-clinical aspects). The 2 fusion partners that 
comprise rFVIIIFc are human factor VIII and the Fc domain of human IgG1. Human factor VIII is well 
characterized in the clinic as a replacement therapy in haemophilia A patients. The Fc domain is found on 
many drugs, including dozens of therapeutic antibodies. For these reasons, separate safety pharmacology 
studies were judged to be unnecessary for rFVIIIFc. 
Cardiovascular measurements (ECGs and heart rate) were included in the 4-week repeat-dose toxicology 
studies in monkeys. Effects on the respiratory and central nervous system were indirectly determined from 
clinical observations. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No PD drug interaction studies have been submitted.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Table 8: List of non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies 
Plasma levels of rFVIIIFc were determined by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to 
measure circulating drug based on mass in μg/mL and a chromogenic activity assay based on cofactor 
activity in IU/mL. The presence of anti-rFVIIIFc antibodies in rat or cynomolgus monkey plasma was 
determined using a bridging ELISA method in which anti-rFVIIIFc IgG bridges between a biotin-labeled 
rFVIIIFc and a labeled rFVIIIFc. This anti-drug antibody ELISA was used to measure anti-rFVIIIFc antibody 
formation in GLP repeat dose PK and toxicology studies in rats and monkeys. 
Absorption 
All non-clinical PK evaluations of rFVIIIFc were performed using intravenous (IV) administration, which 
matches the intended route of administration for individuals with haemophilia A. PK parameters of rFVIIIFc 
were assessed in normal, HemA, FcRn-KO, and hFcRn-Tg mice; Sprague Dawley rats; HemA dogs; and 
cynomolgus monkeys. rFVIIIFc was administered either by IV bolus injection (rodents) or by IV infusion (dog 
and monkey).

Normal and HemA mice (R-FR8-014 and R-FR8-018)) 
The PK parameters of rFVIIIFc were compared to those for ReFacto and Advate, all at a dose of 50 IU/kg, in 
HemA mice. In this study, the elimination half-life of rFVIIIFc (11.1 hours) was greater than either ReFacto 
(5.0 hours) or Advate (7.1 hours). The PK parameters of rFVIIIFc were compared at 3 dose levels, 50, 250, 
and 1000 IU/kg, which resulted in a similar elimination half-life (12.6, 14.5, and 12.3 hours, respectively) 
over a 20-fold dosing range of the drug. Overall, the elimination half-life of rFVIIIFc was between 2.22-fold to 
2.90-fold greater compared to ReFacto and between 1.56-fold to 2.04-fold greater compared to Advate in 
HemA mice. 
The PK parameters of rFVIIIFc and Xyntha were also compared at 125 IU/kg in HemA mice. The elimination 
half-life for rFVIIIFc was found to be 12.34 hours, which was 1.63-fold greater than the elimination half-life 
for Xyntha of 7.58 hours. In the same study, PK parameters for rFVIIIFc and Xyntha were compared at 125 
IU/kg doses in normal mice (C57BL/6 strain). The elimination half-life measured for rFVIIIFc was 8.51 hours, 
which was 1.96-fold greater than the elimination half-life for Xyntha of 4.34 hours. 
FcRn-KO and hFcRn-Tg mice (R-FR8-018) 
The PK parameters for rFVIIIFc and Xyntha were compared after a single 125 IU/kg dose in FcRn-KO and 
hFcRn-Tg mice in order to characterize the mechanism of action of the prolonged elimination half-life 
observed in mice. The elimination half-life of the rFVIIIFc and Xyntha were similar in the FcRn-KO mice and 
were determined to be 5.81 hours for rFVIIIFc and 6.63 hours for Xyntha. In contrast, in the hFcRn-Tg mice 
(in which the knocked-out murine FcRn is replaced with human FcRn), the elimination half-life of rFVIIIFc 
increased to 10.65 hours, while the Xyntha elimination half-life was found to be 4.36 hours, which is similar 
to the value in the FcRn-KO mice. In mice expressing human FcRn in the absence of murine FcRn, the 
elimination half-life for rFVIIIFc was 2.45-fold longer than the elimination half-life of Xyntha.  
Overall, these observations show that the addition of the human Fc domain of IgG1 to rFVIII allows binding 
to human FcRn, resulting in a prolonged elimination half-life of rFVIIIFc relative to Xyntha in a mouse model. 
Non-clinical comparability studies in HemA mice (N-FR8-009-R1, N-FR8-007-R2 and N-FR8-011) 
To support the change from the liquid to the lyophilized DP formulation, PK parameters were determined for 
each formulation in HemA mice and in monkeys. HemA mice (2 males and 2 females per time point, 28 
total/treatment group) were administered a single 250 IU/kg IV dose of either rFVIIIFc liquid DP or rFVIIIFc 
lyophilized DP. The PK parameters were comparable for the liquid DP and lyophilized DP, including the 
elimination half-life (18.5 and 19.3 hours), the MRT (23.9 and 22.8 hours), the Cmax (4.73 and 6.06 IU/mL) 
and the AUC0-∞ (90.7 and 123.6 IU•hr/mL), respectively. 
To support the change from the VLA5 to the RVS2 lyophilized process, PK parameters were determined in 
HemA mice for each process. Male HemA mice (4 per time point, 32 total/treatment group) were 
administered a single 200 IU/kg IV dose of each of the 3 DP samples (VLA5 2000 IU/vial from the 10,000 vial 
lot scale, RVS2 2000 IU/vial from the 40,000 vial lot scale, and RVS2 3000 IU/vial from the 40,000 vial lot 
scale). All PK parameters were similar for VLA5 2000 IU/vial, RVS2 2000 IU/vial and RVS2 3000 IU/vial, 
including the elimination half-life (19.4, 18.3, and 18.5 hours), the MRT (21.7, 21.0 and 21.3 hours), the 
Cmax (4.26, 3.99 and 3.75 IU/mL) and the AUC0-∞ (76.8, 76.1 and 70.0      IU•hr/mL), respectively.

PK of single chain rFVIIIFc in HemA mice (R-FR8-008 and R-FR8-016) 
In order to characterize the single chain isoform of rFVIIIFc, a preparation of 100% SC rFVIIIFc was purified 
from rFVIIIFc containing SC rFVIIIFc. The PK parameters of a 250 IU/kg dose of pure SC rFVIIIFc were 
determined in HemA mice and found to be comparable with rFVIIIFc. The elimination half-life of pure SC 
rFVIIIFc was 13.8 hours, which is similar to the average of values for rFVIIIFc in HemA mice (15.7 ± 3.4 
hours). 
Single-dose PK characterization of rFVIIIFc in rats (N-FR8-004) 
The PK parameters of rFVIIIFc were determined in normal Sprague Dawley rats. Animals were administered a 
single IV dose of 1000 IU/kg which was the highest dose proposed to be tested in the repeat-dose toxicology 
studies. The PK analysis was based on the mean values of plasma rFVIIIFc concentration at each time point 
and the elimination half-life was determined to be 8.0 hours. This is longer than the elimination half-life 
reported in the literature for full-length rFVIII in rats which is 5.5 hours for Kogenate. Based on the literature 
value, rFVIIIFc is predicted to have a 1.45-fold longer elimination half-life in rats. 
Single-dose characterization of rFVIIIFc in dogs (N-FR8-003) 
The PK parameters of rFVIIIFc were evaluated in HemA dogs. A single 125 IU/kg IV dose of rFVIIIFc was 
administered to 2 dogs. When the concentration of rFVIIIFc in plasma was measured by ELISA, the 
elimination half-lives were 17.3 and 16.6 hours (average = 17.0 hours). Similarly, when rFVIIIFc was 
measured using the chromogenic activity assay, the elimination half-lives were 15.1 to 15.7 hours (average 
= 15.4 hours). 
Two dogs also received a single dose of BDD rFVIII (ReFacto), 114 IU/kg for 1 dog and 120 IU/kg for the 
other, followed by rFVIIIFc (125 IU/kg) 72 hours later in a crossover design. The elimination half-life 
determined from the ELISA data for ReFacto were 7.0 hours and 6.7 hours (average = 6.85 hours). Similarly, 
when ReFacto was measured by the chromogenic activity assay, the elimination half-life were 7.5 and 7.2 
hours (average = 7.35 hours). The elimination half-lives for rFVIIIFc in the crossover study were 15.7 and 
13.3 hours (average = 14.5 hours) by ELISA and 15.2 and 15.7 hours (average = 15.5 hours) by 
chromogenic activity assay. 
The average elimination half-life of rFVIIIFc for the 4 dogs was 15.7 ± 1.7 hours (ELISA) and 15.4 ± 0.32 
hours (activity). The elimination half-life for rFVIIIFc is 2.10-fold to 2.29-fold longer than ReFacto in HemA 
dogs. The ELISA concentration data was compared with the activity assay data for rFVIIIFc in dogs, by 
dividing the average AUC0-∞ from the activity assay data (25.9 ± 6.5 IU·hr/mL) by the    AUC0-∞ from the 
ELISA data (2.48 ± 0.97 µg·hr/mL). The resulting estimate of the specific activity of the rFVIIIFc circulating 
in vivo (10,450 IU/mg) is similar to the specific activity of the rFVIIIFc used for this study, 9119 IU/mg. 
Based on this calculation, the circulating rFVIIIFc was fully active in this study in HemA dogs. 
Single-dose PK characterization of rFVIIIFc in monkeys (N-FR8-006 and N-FR8-007-R2) 
rFVIIIFc and Xyntha were administered as a single IV dose at 125 IU/kg in a crossover study design in 
cynomolgus monkeys. Three monkeys received Xyntha on Day 0 and rFVIIIFc on Day 3, while 3 other 
monkeys received rFVIIIFc on Day 0 and Xyntha on Day 4. Plasma samples were collected pre-dose and after 
dosing at 0.25, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours for measurement of rFVIIIFc or Xyntha by ELISA and the 
chromogenic activity assay. Unlike the results observed in the other animal models, the plasma concentration 
over time profiles were similar for rFVIIIFc compared to Xyntha. The elimination half-lives were also similar

for rFVIIIFc and Xyntha based on the ELISA (11.9 ± 1.7 and 12.7 ± 4.4 hours, respectively) or the activity 
assay (16.1 ± 6.9 and 12.5 ± 1.7 hours, respectively).  
In a comparability study in cynomolgus monkeys (4 animals per treatment group), the liquid and lyophilized 
formulations of rFVIIIFc were compared with respect to all PK parameters. The animals were administered a 
single 125 IU/kg IV dose of either rFVIIIFc liquid DP or rFVIIIFc lyophilized DP and plasma levels were 
determined using both the ELISA and the capture chromogenic activity assay. All PK parameters were 
comparable for the 2 formulations based on both assays.  
The average elimination half-life in monkeys was 11.82 ± 1.11 and 12.97 ± 0.81 hours (ELISA) and 12.6 ± 
0.7 and 14.8 ± 1.5 hours (activity) for the liquid DP and lyophilized DP, respectively. The ELISA 
concentration data was compared with the activity assay data for the liquid DP and lyophilized DP, by dividing 
the average AUC0-∞ from the activity assay data (47.2 ± 11.5 and 46.7 ± 15.9 IU·hr/mL) by the AUC0-∞ from 
the ELISA data (5.559 ± 1.197 and 6.537 ± 1.334 μg·hr/mL). The resulting estimate of the specific activities 
of the rFVIIIFc circulating in vivo (8491 and 7143 IU/mg) is similar to the specific activities for the rFVIIIFc 
liquid DP and lyophilized DP (10,268 and 8697 IU/mg, respectively) used for this study. Based on this 
calculation, the circulating rFVIIIFc DPs were fully active in this study in monkeys. 
Repeat-dose PK characterization of rFVIIIFc in rats (CN53610) 
In a 4 week GLP toxicology study [CN53610] in Sprague Dawley rats, rFVIIIFc was administered IV every 
other day over a 4 week period for a total of 14 doses at 50, 250 or 1000 IU/kg to evaluate the systemic and 
local effects and the PK of rFVIIIFc. Each treatment group included 3 males and 3 females per time point. 
Blood was collected pre-dose and at the predetermined time points up to 96 hours (0.25, 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 
48, 72 and 96 hours). Plasma samples were analyzed for rFVIIIFc concentration using a validated ELISA 
method. The PK analysis was based on mean values of rFVIIIFc plasma concentrations. Blood samples for 
immunogenicity evaluation were obtained from the same animals, once pre-study and just prior to dosing on 
Days 11, 19, 27 and 57 for plasma analysis of anti-rFVIIIFc antibodies. Anti-drug antibodies were determined 
using a validated anti-drug antibody ELISA method. 
The systemic exposure for rFVIIIFc was evaluated using Cmax and AUC0-∞ values. With a 5-fold and 20-fold 
increase in dose from low to mid- to high dose groups, Cmax was approximately proportional between the 3 
dose groups (5.9-fold and 15.4-fold, respectively), but AUC0-∞ was observed to be less than proportional 
(3.4-fold and 6.1-fold increase in AUC0-∞, respectively). Group mean Cmax and AUC0-∞ values were similar 
between males and females for a given dose, with the exception of the high dose group that had higher Cmax 
and AUC0-∞ values for males. 
Group mean elimination half-life values were 13.5 and 13.4hours for the low dose, 21.3 and 11.5 hours for 
the mid-dose, and 11.8 and 7.95 hours for the high dose, for males and females, respectively. As dose level 
increased, there was a trend toward increased clearance that was most notable at the high dose level (2.6-
fold comparing high dose to low dose levels) and there was also a rise in the volume of distribution as the 
dose level increased (2.6-fold comparing high dose to low dose levels). 
Repeated administrations of rFVIIIFc resulted in a limited number of evaluable data points, due to most 
values being below the limit of quantitation. Therefore, no PK parameters were evaluated for Day 27. Nearly 
all of the animals receiving rFVIIIFc at all dose levels developed antibodies against rFVIIIFc (22/24 in the low 
dose group, 20/24 in the mid-dose group and 22/24 in the high dose group). Therefore, the unmeasurable 
levels of rFVIIIFc on Day 27 in all groups treated with rFVIIIFc were likely due to the development of anti-
rFVIIIFc antibodies.

Repeat-dose PK characterization of rFVIIIFc in monkeys (CN53056 and N110486) 
Two 4-week GLP toxicology studies were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys; one study used the liquid 
formulation of rFVIIIFc and the other study used the lyophilized formulation of rFVIIIFc. In both studies, 
rFVIIIFc was administered IV every other day for a total of 14 dose administrations at 50, 250 and 1000 
IU/kg to evaluate the systemic and local effects and the PK of rFVIIIFc. In both studies, the vehicle and high 
dose groups included 5 monkeys/sex/group, while the low and the mid-dose groups had 3 
monkeys/sex/group. PK profiles were characterized after the first dose (Day 1) and the last dose (Day 27).  
On Day 1, systemic exposure parameters for rFVIIIFc were evaluated using Cmax and AUC0-∞ values. Both of 
these parameters increased with an increase in dose and were approximately proportional for both studies. 
Group mean Cmax and AUC0-∞ values were similar between males and females for given dose. For the liquid 
formulation, the Cmax values for males and females, respectively, were 0.158 ± 0.018 and 0.123 ± 0.001 
μg/mL in the low dose group, 0.873 ± 0.051 and 0.813 ± 0.070 μg/mL in the mid-dose group, and 2.82 ± 
0.160 and 2.82 ± 0.260 μg/mL in the high dose group. The group mean AUC0–∞ values for males and 
females, respectively, were 2.53 ± 0.510 and 1.46 ± 0.020 μg·hr/mL in the low dose group, 10.4 ± 1.90 and 
11.2 ± 2.90 μg·hr/mL in the mid-dose group and 42.5 ± 4.20 and 32.5 ± 4.50 μg·hr/mL in the high dose 
group. Comparable results were observed for the lyophilized formulation. 
For the liquid formulation, individual elimination half-lives ranged from 6.65 to 21.7 hours among all the dose 
groups and averaged 11.7 ± 1.2, 11.2 ± 1.2 and 13.6 ± 1.2 hours for the low, mid- and high dose groups, 
respectively. For the lyophilized formulation, individual elimination half-lives ranged from 9.08 to 18.4 hours 
among all the dose groups and averaged 12.1 ± 2.2, 13.4 ± 2.8 and 11.9 ± 1.9 hours for the low, mid- and 
high dose groups, respectively.  
After repeat doses of rFVIIIFc in monkeys, there were 5 monkeys in each study that had measurable rFVIIIFc 
in the pre-dose samples on Day 27, which is likely due to some drug accumulation. Several of the monkeys in 
the high dose groups and some in the mid-dose groups did not have a sufficient number of data points with 
measurable a plasma concentration of rFVIIIFc to evaluate PK. Overall, Cmax and AUC0-∞ values increased in 
an approximately dose-proportional manner, with the exception of the high dose group that had lower Cmax 
and AUC0-∞ values compared to both the low and mid-dose groups for both studies. In the study using the 
lyophilized formulation, a single male in the high dose group showed a high AUC0-∞, while the AUC0-∞ for the 
other 4 animals could not be calculated due to insufficient data. Compared to Day 1, the low dose groups had 
similar PK parameters on Day 27 in both studies, while the middose groups had a slightly lower Cmax and 
AUC0-∞ values and the high dose groups had markedly lower group mean Cmax and AUC0-∞ values on Day 27. 
In the study using the liquid formulation, 2 of 6 animals in the mid-dose group and 9 of 10 animals in the 
high dose group developed anti-rFVIIIFc antibodies. In the study using the lyophilized formulation, 1 of 6 
animals in the low dose group, 4 of 6 animals in the mid-dose group, and 6 of 10 animals in the high dose 
group developed anti-rFVIIIFc antibodies. The development of antibodies to the human rFVIIIFc fusion 
protein is expected due to species differences. The development of anti-drug antibodies in the mid-and high 
dose groups was considered responsible for the reduced systemic exposure of rFVIIIFc after 4 weeks of 
repeat dosing in both studies.

Distribution 
Single-dose biodistribution of rFVIIIFc in mice (R-FR8-027 and R-FR8-041) 
The biodistribution of 125I-rFVIIIFc was determined in a quantitative whole body autoradiography study 
(QWBA) in mice. Following IV administration, 125I-rFVIIIFc is cleared and degraded in the liver in both HemA 
mice with circulating VWF and in double knockout (DKO) mice with the combined FVIII-KO and VWF-KO 
traits. However, VWF stabilizes rFVIIIFc in the blood and delays liver uptake in HemA mice relative to DKO 
mice. 
Based on the percentage of the initial dose per organ (%ID/organ), rFVIIIFc distributes into the liver to a 
greater extent in the absence of VWF in DKO mice compared to the liver distribution in the presence of VWF 
in HemA mice. The organs with the greatest %ID are blood, liver, muscle, bone, and kidney for both HemA 
and DKO mice. Comparison of the %ID/organ at 5 and 30 minutes in HemA mice (blood: 36.1 and 34.1%; 
liver: 7.22 and 11.1%; muscle: 3.12 and 2.95%; bone: 2.70 and 1.69%; and kidney: 2.04 and 2.10%) to 
the %ID/organ at 5 and 15 minutes in DKO mice (blood: 28.4 and 19.3%; liver: 29.2 and 30.5%; muscle: 
3.59 and 2.57%; bone: 3.64% at 15 min only; and kidney: 1.63 and 2.32%) shows that the liver is the 
major clearance organ. 
Based on the 125I-rFVIIIFc biodistribution, the liver is the dominant clearance organ in both HemA and DKO 
mice. The presence of VWF appears to stabilize 125I-rFVIIIFc in the blood and delays liver uptake in HemA 
mice relative to DKO mice as deduced from the relative lower ratio of 125I-signal in the liver to blood in HemA 
mice when compared to DKO mice.  
In 2 separate studies, 3 or 4 pregnant mice were dosed with either 400 IU of rFVIIIFc or BDD FVIII 
(approximately 13,000 IU/kg), 3 to 4 hours before the fetuses were extracted. FVIII activity could be 
measured in all 9 fetal blood samples from pups removed from mothers dosed with rFVIIIFc. The measured 
FVIII activity was 1.1% ± 0.65% of the FVIII activity found in the maternal circulation after dosing (from 
0.2% to 1.9%). In contrast, no FVIII activity could be detected in 9 fetal blood samples from pups removed 
from mothers dosed with BDD FVIII.

of neonatal Fc receptor in the transplacental transfer of protective IgG molecules frommaternal to foetal 
circulation. In this study, female HemA mice were treated with rFVIIIFc or BDD rFVIII at day 19 of gestation. 
Analysis carried out by the chromogenic activity assay indicated that a small amount of rFVIIIFc was

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Table 9: Toxicology studies  
Single dose toxicity 
Non-GLP single-dose acute toxicology and PK study (N-FR8-005) 
One single-dose toxicology study was conducted with rFVIIIFc in monkeys to determine the single dose 
tolerance and toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys at higher doses of rFVIIIFc (3000, 10,000, and 20,000 IU/kg) 
compared to those used in repeat-dose toxicology studies (50, 250 and 1000 IU/kg). The highest dose used 
in the single-dose toxicology study (20,000 IU/kg) is approximately 300-fold higher than a routine 
prophylactic dose used to treat patients and exceeds the binding capacity of VWF in monkeys. 
Single doses of rFVIIIFc were well-tolerated. There were no effects of these high doses of rFVIIIFc on 
coagulation parameters (fibrinogen, aPTT, and PT), thrombogenic markers (fibrinogen and platelets), 
haematology parameters, or clinical chemistry analyses. There were no effects on organ weights, nor were 
there any histopathological changes attributed to effects of rFVIIIFc. The no observed adverse effect level 
(NOAEL) was defined as the highest dose tested, 20,000 IU/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
rFVIIIFc was evaluated for adverse toxicological effects following repeat dosing in rats and monkeys. Non-
GLP pilot studies were conducted in both species to determine the tolerability of repeat dosing and to assess 
development of antibodies to rFVIIIFc. Based on information from the pilot studies, a 4-week GLP repeat-
dose study was conducted in rats and two 4-week GLP repeat-dose studies were conducted in monkeys.

Non-GLP pilot toxicology studies (N-FR8-004 and N-FR8-001) 
In the repeat-dose, non-GLP study in rats animals were dosed IV at 1000 IU/kg on SD0 to characterize first 
dose PK properties. Subsequent doses were administered every other day from SD5 to SD17. This dosing 
regimen was well-tolerated. The elimination half-life from a pooled plasma profile was 8 hours. By SD27, 9 of 
10 rats had developed antibodies to rFVIIIFc. 4 of 9 rats had antibodies specific to FVIII moiety, and 2 of 9 
rats had antibodies specific to the Fc portion of the test article.  
In a second repeat-dose, non-GLP study in cynomolgus monkeys, a total of 9 cynomolgus monkeys were 
divided into 3 dose groups (50, 250 and 1000 IU/kg) and received 8 IV doses on SD0, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 and 
17. Each animal received its first bolus IV dose of rFVIIIFc on SD0 to characterize first dose PK properties. 
Subsequent IV doses were administered every other day starting on SD5. PK profiles were monitored using 
chromogenic and one-stage aPTT). The use of these activity assays provides support that administered 
rFVIIIFc protein retained its FVIII-specific activity in the circulation. Residual levels of rFVIIIFc (including 
endogenous FVIII) were measured prior to dose administration on SD9, 11, 13, 15 and 17 and post-dosing 
on SD21 and 27 by the one-stage aPTT clotting assay. Anti-drug antibodies were measured using a bridging 
ELISA at selected timepoints during the study.  
Following the first dose on SD0, maximum plasma FVIII activity levels were approximately linear with dose 
using both the chromogenic assay and the one-stage aPTT assay. Individual elimination half-lives based on 
the chromogenic assay ranged from 6 to 19 hours, with a mean value of 13.3 hours. Using the one-stage 
aPTT assay, individual elimination half-lives ranged from 5 to 34 hours, with a mean value of 17.9 hours. 
Results were comparable for both assays. 
Pre-dose levels of FVIII activity (measured using the one-stage aPTT assay) decreased over time, indicating 
the presence of anti-rFVIIIFc antibodies which cross-reacted with endogenous FVIII. By the end of the study, 
antibodies to rFVIIIFc were detected in 7 of the 9 treated monkeys.  
GLP repeat-dose toxicology studies (CN53610, CN53056, N110486) 
rFVIIIFc was evaluated for systemic and local toxicological effects in Sprague Dawley rats in a 4-week repeat-
dose GLP study using the liquid formulation. Rats were selected because they are a standard species used in 
toxicology studies. The highest dose selected for the toxicity studies was 1000 IU/kg. Animals received IV 
doses of rFVIIIFc every other day for 4 weeks (total of 14 doses). The terminal necropsy occurred 2 days 
after the last dose on SD29, and the recovery necropsy was 1 month later (SD57). The dose levels, 50, 250, 
and 1000 IU/kg, were well-tolerated for the 4 weeks of dosing. There were no effects on any in-life 
parameters (clinical observations, body weights, food consumption, ophthalmic examinations), laboratory 
evaluations (haematology, serum chemistry, coagulation), or post-mortem analyses (gross necropsy, organ 
weights, histopathology). There were no effects of rFVIIIFc at the injection site (tail vein). Antibodies to 
rFVIIIFc developed during the 4-week dosing period (which was expected for the fully human protein in these 
nonhuman species); the development was independent of gender and dose level. An increase in aPTT 
(approximately 20% to 25%) was seen in mid and high dose males and in high dose females on SD29. These 
increases may represent cross-reactivity of antirFVIIIFc antibodies with endogenous FVIII, but the magnitude 
of the change in aPTT values was insufficient to cause any adverse clinical signs in the rats. 
Overall, repeat-dosing of rFVIIIFc in rats was well-tolerated for 4 weeks with a NOAEL defined as the highest 
dose tested, 1000 IU/kg. The development of antibodies and corresponding ablation of exposure in most of 
the treated animals precluded longer dosing periods in this species.

A 4-week repeat-dose GLP toxicology study was conducted with the liquid formulation of rFVIIIFc to evaluate 
systemic and local toxicological effects in cynomolgus monkeys. Monkeys were selected as a 
pharmacologically relevant species since the binding of the Fc portion of the molecule to FcRn is most similar 
to human. Animals received IV doses of rFVIIIFc every other day for 4 weeks (total of 14 dose 
administrations). The terminal necropsy occurred 2 days after the last dose (SD29), and the recovery 
necropsy was 1 month later (SD57). 
Toxicology parameters evaluated in this study included in-life observations (clinical observations, body 
weights, food consumption, ophthalmic examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs)), laboratory evaluations 
(haematology, serum chemistry, coagulation), immunogenicity (antibodies to rFVIIIFc), and post-mortem 
analyses (gross necropsy, organ weights, histopathology). Local tolerance was also monitored by gross and 
microscopic evaluations of the injection sites. There were no adverse toxicological findings directly related to 
effects of rFVIIIFc in this study. 
Antibodies to rFVIIIFc developed in a dose-related pattern starting on SD11. Five of 10 high dose animals 
developed antibodies by SD19, and by SD27, 8 of 10 high dose animals were antibody-positive. Two animals 
dosed at 250 IU/kg developed antibodies (one was transiently positive on SD19). Anti-rFVIIIFc antibodies 
were not detected in the low dose animals (50 IU/kg). 
A second 4-week repeat-dose GLP toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys was conducted with the 
lyophilized formulation of rFVIIIFc. The study design was identical to the first 4-week study in monkeys, but 
based on clinical abnormalities seen in the first study, greater care was taken in handling the animals when 
collecting blood for laboratory evaluations as it was possible that some animals could develop antibodies that 
might cross-react with endogenous FVIII and render them susceptible to bleeding (i.e. acquired 
haemophilia). 
As seen in the first toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys, antibodies to rFVIIIFc developed in a dose-
related manner and caused indirect adverse effects. Development of these antibodies altered the PK 
parameters following the last dose on SD27. Increased aPTT values during the dosing period (SD19, 27 and 
29) provided supporting data that that antibodies to rFVIIIFc cross-reacted with endogenous FVIII. 
After eliminating indirect toxicological effects that were considered due to development of antirFVIIIFc 
antibodies formation, there were no direct toxicological effects of repeat dosing with rFVIIIFc in monkeys. 
Body weights, food consumption, ophthalmic examinations, and ECGs were within normal limits for all dose 
groups. Organ weights were not adversely affected by rFVIIIFc. Histopathological observations, with the 
exception of effects associated with SC haemorrhage, were within normal limits for monkeys treated with 
rFVIIIFc. 
Overall, there were no adverse toxicological findings directly related to effects of rFVIIIFc following 4 weeks 
of repeated dosing. SC haemorrhage following blood collections and subsequent adverse events were 
considered due to anti-rFVIIIFc antibodies that cross-reacted with endogenous FVIII in some animals and 
prevented them from regaining haemostasis. Thus, the NOAEL for direct effects of rFVIIIFc was defined as 
the highest dose tested, 1000 IU/kg. The development of antibodies, along with ablation of exposure and 
acquired haemophilia, in most of the antibody-positive animals precluded longer dosing periods in this 
species.

Toxicokinetic data  
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was evaluated in the 4-week repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats and monkeys by gross 
and microscopic examination of the IV injection sites. In comparison to microscopic findings in control 
animals, there were no exacerbated local reactions due to administration of rFVIIIFc. There were no injection 
site reactions in either control or treated rats. In monkeys, all dose groups (including the control groups) had 
microscopic findings of haemorrhage, inflammation, and/or fibrosis, consistent with IV injections. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Two comparative immunogenicity studies were conducted in HemA mice. The first study compared rFVIIIFc 
to ReFacto (rFVIII), while the second study compared rFVIIIFc lyophilized DP from the VLA5 manufacturing 
process (2000 IU/vial from the 10,000 vial lot scale) to rFVIIIFc lyophilized DP from the RVS2 manufacturing 
process (3000 IU/vial from the 40,000 vial lot scale). The route of administration was IV in both studies. 
Non-GLP comparative immunogenicity studies (R-FR8-015 and N-FR8-018) 
A non-GLP repeat dose comparative immunogenicity study was conducted in FVIII-deficient mice (R-FR8-
015). Six doses of rFVIIIFc, or recombinant human FVIII (ReFacto) were administered intravenously twice 
weekly for 3 weeks at 50, 250, or 1000 IU/kg. FVIII chromogenic activity was measured in plasma pre-study 
and 1 hour after the first and sixth doses. After the sixth dose, 3/6 animals receiving 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc and 
all of the animals treated with 50 IU/kg ReFacto had measurable FVIII activity. In the 250 and 1000 IU/kg 
dose groups, results were similar for both rFVIIIFc and ReFacto after the last dose, with the FVIII activity 
below the limit of quantitation for all but 1 animal treated with 250 IU/kg rFVIIIFc. There was a dose-
dependent increase in the incidence and titer of anti-drug antibodies for both rFVIIIFc and ReFacto in this 
study. At the 50 IU/kg dose level, 3/5 mice treated with rFVIIIFc tested positive for anti-drug antibodies and 
1/6 mice treated with ReFacto were positive on Day 32. Treatment with 250 IU/kg rFVIIIFc resulted in 5/6 
animals testing positive for anti-drug antibodies on Day 16 with titers ranging from 50 to 200 and treatment 
with 250 IU/kg ReFacto resulted in 1/6 mice testing positive (titer = 50). However on Day 32, all animals in 
both the rFVIIIFc and ReFacto 250 IU/kg groups were positive for anti-drug antibodies with titers ranging 
from 50 to 800 for rFVIIIFc and 50 to 3200 for ReFacto. Repeated administration of 1000 IU/kg rFVIIIFc or 
ReFacto induced antibody formation in all mice on Days 16 and 32 and with similar titer ranges. 
A second immunogenicity study in HemA mice was conducted to compare rFVIIIFc lyophilized DP from the 
VLA5 manufacturing process (2000 IU/vial from the 10,000 vial lot scale) to rFVIIIFc lyophilized DP from the 
RVS2 manufacturing process (3000 IU/vial from the 40,000 vial lot scale). Vehicle control animals did not 
develop antibodies to rFVIIIFc. One animal in each group dosed with rFVIIIFc developed antibodies (on SD14 
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015

for DP from RSV2 and on SD28 for DP fromVLA5). Thus, the immunogenic potential of rFVIIIFc lyophilized DP 
from the VLA5 and RVS2 manufacturing processes were comparable in HemA mice. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment was submitted. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The specific activity of rFVIIIFc was found to be comparable to reported values for a number of rFVIII 
products by both FVIII-specific aPTT (1-stage clotting assay) and chromogenic assays. Additional in vitro 
characterization assays were performed to examine the function of rFVIIIFc in the coagulation cascade, to 
ensure that the normal function of the clotting factor was not compromised by the presence of the Fc domain 
at the carboxyl terminus. rFVIIIFc was compared to another commercially available rFVIII product for binding 
to vWF, activation by thrombin, interaction with FIXa, phospholipids and platelets, interaction with FXa, and 
inactivation by APC. In all of these assays, the function of rFVIIIFc was comparable to the other rFVIII 
product. 
In vivo clotting activity was measured via WBCT and chromogenic assay in hemophilic mice and dogs. In both 
models rFVIIIFc revealed similar acute clotting efficacy as the comparators, however, rFVIIIFc increased the 
duration of this effect 2.7 and 1.5-2.1 fold as compared to other commercially available rFVIII products, 
respectively. As the pharmacodynamic assays have been performed with liquid DS, a study comparing liquid 
and lyophilized DS material resulted in similar efficacy. The acute clotting efficacy of lyophilized rFVIIIFc DP 
and another rFVIII product were compared using a well-established tail clip bleeding model demonstrating 
comparable efficacy and a 2-fold prolonged efficacy for rFVIIIFc versus comparator. 
Pharmacokinetics 
In all nonclinical PK studies, rFVIIIFc was administered either by IV bolus injection or infusion in order to 
model the route of administration in the clinic. The analytical methods include assays to measure plasma 
concentrations of rFVIIIFc (ELISA) and assays to measure FVIII activity (chromogenic activity assays).  
The PK parameters of rFVIIIFc were assessed in several species (mice, dogs, rats and monkeys). Monkeys 
were chosen as a species in which to test comparability because the affinity of rFVIIIFc for human FcRn and 
monkey FcRn are similar. 
The elimination half-life for rFVIIIFc was found to be a minimum of 1.5-fold to greater than 2.5-fold longer 
than the elimination half-life for full-length rFVIII or BDD rFVIII, by direct comparison (normal mice, hFcRn-
Tg mice, HemA mice, HemA dogs), or by reference to published data (rat). 
Studies in FcRn-KO and hFcRn-Tg mice demonstrated that the prolonged elimination half-life of rFVIIIFc is 
dependent on interaction with the FcRn receptor; both Cmax and AUC0-∞ were shown to be dose proportional 
over a wide dose range in rats and monkeys, while the elimination half-life did not vary with dose in these 
species or in mice (50 to 1000 IU/kg). PK of purified SC rFVIIIFc was similar to the PK of rFVIIIFc. 
Different drug products (liquid and lyophilized) produced by alternative manufacturing process (VLA5 and 
RVS2) used during clinical development were found to be comparable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015 
Page 37/132 
  
  
 
 
A study performed with radiolabeled product showed the blood, lungs, kidneys, myocardium, urinary bladder 
and urine as the tissues where radioactivity was detected. Additional studies in HemA mice and DKO mice 
indicated that VWF is necessary to stabilize rFVIIIFc. 
The role of neonatal Fc receptor in the transmission of rFVIIIFc was shown, indicating that the mechanism of 
transplacental transfer occurs by the FcRn pathway.  
In  line  with  guideline  ICH  S6  Guideline  (1997)  and  Addendum  (ICH  S6(R1),  2012),  metabolism,  excretion 
and pharmacokinetic drug interactions studies are not required for the development of this type of product. 
Pharmacokinetic single-dose studies carried out in dogs (HemA dogs) confirmed the prolonged elimination 
half-life of rFVIIIFc (ELISA average data = 14.5 hours and chromogenic activity assay average data = 15.5 
hours) compared to BDD rFVIII (ELISA average data = 6.85 hours and chromogenic activity assay average 
data = 7.35 hours. 
In the 4-week GLP study carried out in rats administered with rFVIIIFc (50, 250 and 1000 IU/Kg), the half-
lives values were 13.5 and 13.4 hours for the low dose, 21.3 and 11.5 for the mid-dose; and 11.8 and 7.95 
hours for the high-dose (males and females respectively). In the same study, rFVIIIFc repeated dosing 
resulted in the appearance of anti-rFVIIIFc antibodies, which affected the pharmacokinetic parameters.  
In the repeat-dose 4-week study in monkeys the PK was similar in animals that did not develop anti-drug 
antibodies, but a decrease in AUC0-∞ or elimination half-life and an increase in CL were observed in monkeys 
that did develop anti-drug antibodies. The development of ADAs (dose-dependent) was reported, irrespective 
of the manufacturing process. This finding modified the exposure of rFVIIIFc, which produced drug levels that 
were below quantification levels after 4 weeks. 
The study performed with radiolabeled product showed the blood, lungs, kidneys, myocardium, urinary 
bladder and urine as the tissues where radioactivity was detected. The liver clears and degrades rFVIIIFc and 
VWF stabilizes rFVIIIFc in the blood and delays liver uptake based on a biodistribution study with 125I-rFVIIIFc 
in mice. 
The PK parameters of a liquid and lyophilized formulation were found to be comparable in HemA mice and 
monkeys, and the PK parameters of lyophilized DP from 2 manufacturing processes (VLA5 and RVS2) were 
found to be comparable to each other in HemA mice, thus supporting the use of the different formulations 
and manufacturing processes in GLP toxicology studies and clinical studies, and the suitability of RVS2 for 
commercialization. 
In summary, these PK studies demonstrate that rFVIIIFc has an extended half-life and support the potential 
of rFVIIIFc to provide a prolonged protective haemostatic effect with less frequent dosing compared to FVIII. 
Type and amount of non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies are considered sufficient and appropriate to support 
marketing authorisation.   
Toxicology 
The highest dose tested in animals in repeat-dose studies, 1000 IU/kg, is 10 times the highest anticipated 
clinical dose. There were no adverse toxicological findings directly related to effects of rFVIIIFc, either 
macroscopic or microscopic, up to the highest dose tested in the 4-week repeat-dose studies, and up to the 
highest dose tested in the single-dose toxicology study, 20,000 IU/kg. Thus, the NOAEL for non-
immunogenic-related toxicities was considered to be 1000 IU/kg for both rats and monkeys.  
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015 
Page 38/132 
  
  
 
 
The repeat-dose studies showed the appearance of anti-rFVIIIFc antibodies as the main toxicological finding 
occurred in both species (rats and monkeys). In the case of monkey species, the development of anti-
rFVIIIFc antibodies was observed in a dose-dependent manner (50-1000 IU/Kg).The presence of these 
antibodies was also detected after the recovery period at the highest dose, i.e. 1000 IU/Kg, which 
corresponds to a HED value of 324 IU/Kg (safety margin of 6.5-fold to the recommended clinical dose for 
long-term prophylaxis of 50 IU/Kg).  
Local tolerance was evaluated within repeated dose toxicology studies. The Applicant reported microscopic 
findings of haemorrhage, inflammation and/or fibrosis even in control groups, which it was considered 
consistent with IV injections. 
A comparability study between rFVIIIFc and BDD rFVIII, resulted in a similar profile in terms of anti-rFVIIIFc 
antibodies development and the reduction of clotting activity in a dose-dependent manner. This 
immunotoxicological finding was in line with the one occurred in monkeys, in which the appearance of ADAs 
was also reported. Consequently, clotting activity (aPTT increased) and haematological parameters 
(decreases in red blood cells, haemoglobin and haematocrit) were altered in antibody-positive animals. No 
differences were reported between different rFVIIIFc lyophilized drug products (VLA5 and RVS2). 
According to ICH S6 guideline recommendations, the omission of studies on genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and 
reproductive and developmental toxicity is justified. 
According to the “Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medical products for human use” 
substances like amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted from the guideline 
since they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment; Elocta is thereby exempted and an 
environmental risk assessment is not required. 
Overall, the safety of rFVIIIFc has been adequately characterized in animals. No adverse toxicological 
findings directly related to effects of rFVIIIFc, either macroscopic or microscopic, up to the highest dose 
tested have been reported. Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on acute and 
repeated dose toxicity studies (which included assessments of  local toxicity and safety pharmacology). 
Studies to investigate genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, toxicity to reproduction or embryo-foetal development 
have not been conducted. In a placental transfer study, ELOCTA has been shown to cross the placenta in 
small amounts in mice. This information has been included in the SmPC section 5.3. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical development of Elocta was performed in accordance with current guidelines. In general, type 
and amount of pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies are considered sufficient and 
appropriate to support marketing authorisation.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
Determination of FVIII activity of human plasma samples 
The most commonly assay used in clinical laboratories for measuring the activity of FVIII in plasma samples 
is the one-stage clotting assay. An alternative method for determining FVIII activity in plasma is the two-
stage chromogenic assay.  
Immunogenicity assays 
An anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay was designed to quantify both neutralizing and non-neutralizing 
antibodies in treated patients plasma samples designed to detect all immunoglobulin classes, including 
antibodies that are targeted only to the FVIII portion or the Fc portion of the drug product. The assay was 
validated according to international guidelines. 
The Nijmegen-Modified Bethesda Assay (ISTH reference method for factor VIII inhibitor testing) was used for 
quantifying neutralizing antibodies titers. This assay measures the decrease in FVIII activity in a one-stage 
assay when a patient sample containing neutralizing antibodies is mixed with a normal plasma sample. The 
titer of the inhibitor sample is determined from the reduction in FVIII activity compared to a control inhibitor-
free plasma mix. For high titer inhibitor samples, dilutions are tested to arrive at a reduction near 50%, 
which is defined as 1 Bethesda unit (BU). Sample inhibitor titer is expressed as Bethesda Unit BU/mL. In

these clinical studies, a titer of <0.6 BU/mL was reported as “negative.” Titers from ≥0.6 BU/mL to 5 BU/mL 
are considered positive (‘low titer’). Samples with >5 BU/mL are considered ‘high titer’. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
The PK parameters were to be derived from FVIIII activity measured using one stage clotting (aPTT) and 
chromogenic substrate assays: 
-Incremental recovery (K) post-injection 
-Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC 0-INF) 
-Maximum plasma activity (Cmax) 
-Elimination half-life (t½) 
-Mean residence time (MRT) 
-Clearance (CL) 
-Volume of distribution (V) 
To assess the duration of therapeutic effect of FVIII, the following parameters were to be assessed: 
Time to 1% and to 3% above baseline FVIII from completion of injection. 
Statistical analysis 
Summary descriptive statistics were to include the number of non-missing values, mean, geometric mean, 
standard deviation, percent coefficient of variation, minimum, and maximum. These analyses were to be 
repeated for the one-stage clotting and chromogenic assays. 
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with factors for study treatment and subject was to be used to 
compare rFVIIIFc to Advate for the analysis of selected PK parameters including but not limited to t1/2, AUC, 
and time to reach 1% above baseline FVIII activity. The analysis was to be performed for each dose level 
separately. PK parameters were to be log-transformed for these analyses and estimated means, mean 
differences, and confidence intervals on the log-scale were to be exponentiated to obtain estimates for 
geometric means, geometric mean ratios, and confidence intervals, respectively, on the original scale.  
Absorption  
Bioavailability 
No bioavailability studies were submitted (See discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
Bioequivalence  
Two formulations of the rFVIIIFc drug product have been used in the clinical studies. A frozen liquid 
formulation was used in the Phase 1/2a study, and a lyophilised formulation (intended for commercialisation) 
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015 
Page 42/132 
  
  
 
 
was used in the subsequent studies. The comparability of the two drug products was evaluated in vitro as 
well as in the context of non-clinical studies. 
The lyophilised rFVIIIFc formulation from the VLA5 manufacturing process was used in Studies 997HA301 
and 8HA01EXT and from the RVS2 manufacturing process in Studies 8HA02PED and 8HA01EXT. The primary 
difference between the VLA5 and RVS2 manufacturing processes was in drug product scale (change from 
10,000 to 40,000 vials/lot, respectively). rFVIIIFc from the RVS2 manufacturing process is proposed for 
commercial use. 
Distribution 
No distribution studies were submitted (see discussion on Clinical pharmacology) 
Elimination 
No elimination studies were submitted (see discussion on Clinical pharmacology) 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Pharmacokinetics of of rFVIIIFc was evaluated in three of the overall five clinical studies with rFVIIIFc: in a 
single-dose, Phase 1/2a study (998HA101); a multiple-dose, Phase 3 study in adults and adolescents ≥12 
years of age (997HA301); and a multiple-dose, Phase 3 study in children <12 years of age (8HA02PED). In 
studies 998HA101 and 997HA301, PK of rFVIIIFc was compared to Advate. In study 8HA02PED, PK of 
rFVIIIFc was compared to PK of prior FVIII therapy in a subset of subjects. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population  
Study 998HA101 was a Phase 1/2a study to compare PK of escalating single doses of rFVIIIc with Advate® 
in previously treated patients (PTPs) ≥12 years of age with severe haemophilia A. The study population 
included 1 Asian (at Site 200, Hong Kong); all other subjects were white (at US sites). The median age of all 
subjects was 30.5 years (range: 23 to 61 years), and median weight was 78.3 kg (range: 54 to 111 kg). The 
median age and weight were higher in the 25 IU/kg dose group than in the 65 IU/kg dose group: 42 years 
vs. 30 years; and weight 88.3 kg vs. 75.8 kg, respectively. The overall history of exposure ranged from >100 
to 6000 exposure days (EDs). Seven of 16 subjects were using Advate at the time of study entry. Twelve of 
16 subjects were following a prophylaxis regimen, requiring FVIII replacement 2 to 3 times per week. All 
subjects were required to have a minimum 4-day washout period from their current FVIII product prior to 
their initial dose of Advate.  
Dosing was sequential: a single dose of Advate was administered at 25 or 65 IU/kg followed 3 or 4 days 
later, respectively, to ensure a sufficient washout time, by an equal dose of rFVIIIFc. Plasma FVIII activity 
was measured in subjects before rFVIIIFc injection; 10 and 30 minutes; and 1, 3, 6, 9, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 
and 168 hours (7 days) after an injection of 25 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc, with additional samples at 192, 216, and 
240 hours (10 days) after injection for subjects dosed at 65 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc. Plasma FVIII activity was 
measured at the same time points after Advate treatment, through 72 hours for the 25 IU/kg group and 96 
hours for the 65 IU/kg group.  
16 subjects were enrolled: 6 subjects received 25 IU/kg and 10 subjects received 65 IU/kg. All 16 subjects 
were included in the PK analysis of Advate. However, only 15 subjects were included in the PK analysis of 
rFVIIIFc because of incomplete PK sampling for 1 subject.

Results of the PK evaluation are summarised as follows: 
PK Parameters by Chromogenic Assay for rFVIIIFc and Advate Per Dose Group (Study 998HA101, Phase 
1/2a) 
AUCinf = area under the curve from time zero to infinity; CI = confidence interval; CL = clearance; Cmax_OB = maximum 
observed activity, occurring at Tmax (baseline and residual drug subtracted); FVIII = coagulation factor VIII; Geom. Mean = 
geometric mean; IR = incremental recovery; MRT = mean residence time; PK = pharmacokinetic; rFVIIIFc = recombinant 
coagulation factor VIII Fc fusion protein; t½ = half-life; Time 1% = time after dose when FVIII activity has declined to 1 IU/dL 
above baseline; Time 3% = time after dose when FVIII activity has declined to 3 IU/dL above baseline; Tmax = time to maximum 
concentration or activity; Vss = volume of distribution at steady state. 
Estimated means, 95% CI for means, and mean differences were transformed to obtain estimated geometric means, 95% CI for 
geometric means, and geometric mean ratios, respectively. 
Study 997HA301  
Study 997HA301 (See also Clinical Efficacy section) was a Phase 3 study to evaluate the safety, PK, and 
efficacy of rFVIIIFc lyophilized powder administered as an IV injection to previously treated subjects with 
severe hemophilia A. In total, 165 adult and adolescent subjects ≥12 years of age were enrolled. The study 
evaluated an individualized prophylaxis regimen (Arm 1), a weekly prophylaxis regimen (Arm 2), and an 
episodic (on-demand) regimen (Arm 3). 
For all subjects, PK assessments for rFVIIIFc were based on plasma FVIII activity levels that were determined 
by the one-stage clotting (aPTT) assay and two-stage chromogenic substrate assay. 
The PK analysis was performed on FVIII activity versus time data obtained following IV infusion. A 
compartmental analysis and noncompartmental analysis (NCA) were to be conducted.

The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PKAS) was defined as all subjects in Arms 1, 2, or 3 who had completed 
evaluable sampling timepoints (through at least the 48-hour timepoint for the Advate profile or the 72-hour 
timepoint for the rFVIIIFc PK profiling) to allow the acceptable determination of the terminal half-life. 
The Sequential PK Subgroup was defined as subjects who had evaluable PK profiles for both Advate and 
baseline rFVIIIFc and/or evaluable PK profiles for both baseline rFVIIIFc and the repeat rFVIIIFc profile. Prior 
to the first dose of rFVIIIFc or Advate (for subjects in the sequential PK subgroup of Arm 1), all subjects were 
to undergo a washout of FVIII-containing products of at least 96 hours. For adolescent subjects, a 72-hour 
washout was to be allowed;

Pharmacokinetic properties were evaluated in 28 subjects (≥ 15 years) receiving rFVIIIFc at a single dose of 
50 IU/kg of ELOCTA. Pharmacokinetic samples were collected pre-dose and then subsequently at 7 time 
points up to 120 hours (5 days) post-dose.

* Pharmacokinetic parameters in 12 to <18 years included subjects from all the arms in Study I with 
different sampling schemes  
In comparison with adolescents and adults, children less than 12 years of age may have a higher clearance 
and a shorter half-life which is consistent with observations of other coagulation factors. These differences 
should be taken into account when dosing.  
For subjects in study 8HA02PED with PK dosing with both pre-study FVIII and rFVIIIFc, a comparison of the 
PK parameters was performed by calculating the ratio of the rFVIIIFc PK parameter to the prior FVIII for each 
subject.  
In the subset of subjects whose prior therapy was Advate (8 subjects in the <6 years of age cohort and 8 
subjects in the 6 to <12 years of age cohort), the geometric mean of the intra-subject ratio of rFVIIIFc to 
Advate for t½ was 1.749 (95% CI: 1.470, 2.081) and 1.426 (95% CI: 1.191, 1.707) for the <6 years of age 
cohort and 6 to <12 years of age cohort, respectively. 
In subjects whose prior therapy was Helixate/Kogenate (6 subjects in the <6 years of age cohort and 6 
subjects in the 6 to <12 years of age cohort), the geometric mean of the intra-subject ratio of rFVIIIFc to 
Helixate/Kogenate for t½ was 1.798 (95% CI: 1.070, 3.023) and 1.781 (95% CI: 1.048, 3.026) for the <6

In the subset of subjects whose prior therapy was Haemosolvate (6 subjects in the 6 to <12 years age 
cohort), the geometric mean of the intra-subject ratio of rFVIIIFc to Haemosolvate for t½ was 1.837 (95% 
CI: 1.538, 2.193).

Study 8HA02PED (See also Clinical Efficacy) 
Study 8HA02PED was an open-label, Phase 3, multicenter evaluation of the safety, PK, and efficacy of 
rFVIIIFc for routine prophylaxis and control of bleeding in PTPs <12 years of age with severe hemophilia A. 
Sixty subjects were enrolled into the PK subgroup (25 subjects <6 years of age and 35 subjects 6 to <12 
years of age). A washout period with no FVIII treatment was required prior to administration of prestudy 
FVIII and prior to the administration of rFVIIIFc. Eligible subjects underwent a PK evaluation of prestudy 
FVIII (50 IU/kg; unless they were exempt because they had a satisfactory PK assessment performed within 
14 months prior to the Screening Visit), followed by a PK evaluation of rFVIIIFc (50 IU/kg). Blood sampling 
schedules were as follows: 
-Samples for PK assessment of prestudy FVIII were obtained predose and at 30 (±5) minutes and 3 (±0.5), 
24 (±3), and 48 (±4) hours following prestudy FVIII dosing. 
-Samples for PK assessment of rFVIIIFc were obtained predose and at 30 (±5) minutes and 3 (±0.5), 24 
(±3), 48 (±4), and 72 (±7) hours following rFVIIIFc dosing. 
NCA was performed for baseline and for residual drug-corrected FVIII activity data from both the one-stage 
and chromogenic assays using Phoenix WinNonlin software 
Actual sampling times, doses, and injection durations were used for PK analyses. Actual doses were used for 
the analysis of FVIII profiles following rFVIIIFc dosing, whereas nominal doses were used for the PK analysis 
of prestudy FVIII. Nominal sampling times and doses were used for the creation of tables, listings, and 
figures. The key PK parameters estimated included IR, DNAUC, t½, MRT, CL, and Vss. 
Any subject with adequate rFVIIIFc PK data was included in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PKAS).The 
PKAS, defined as all subjects with adequate PK data by either assay, comprised 55 subjects overall. Analyses 
performed for the PK subgroup using both the one-stage aPTT clotting and chromogenic assays included a 
summary of FVIII activity levels for rFVIIIFc at scheduled PK timepoints for the PKAS, a summary of FVIII 
activity levels for prestudy FVIII and rFVIIIFc for subjects who had complete and evaluable PK profiles for 
both prestudy FVIII and rFVIIIFc, a listing of PK parameters derived from NCA for both prestudy FVIII and 
rFVIIIFc for the All-Enrolled Analysis Set, the descriptive statistics of PK parameters of rFVIIIFc for the PKAS,  
a listing of the ratio of rFVIIIFc to prestudy FVIII for select PK parameters for all subjects included in the 
PKAS, the plots of FVIII activity versus time profiles for rFVIIIFc and prestudy FVIII for each subject in the 
PKAS and The mean-activity-versus-time profiles for prestudy FVIII and rFVIIIFc for subjects who had 
complete and evaluable PK profiles for both prestudy FVIII and rFVIIIFc. 
In total, 60 subjects enrolled into the PK subgroup (25 subjects in the <6 years of age cohort and 35 subjects 
in the 6 to <12 years of age cohort). Of the 60 subjects in the PK subgroup, 5 subjects were exempted from 
PK assessment with prestudy FVIII as they had historical data from a prior PK assessment with FVIII                                                                                                                                                                           
As specified in the 8HA02PED protocol, these subjects were still required to complete a PK assessment with 
rFVIIIFc, and only the rFVIIIFc data, if evaluable, were included in the PK summary.  
Two of the 60 subjects in the PK subgroup withdrew following the PK assessment for prestudy FVIII. 
Fifty-three subjects (23 subjects in the <6 years of age cohort and 30 subjects in the 6 to <12 years of age 
cohort) received PK assessments with both prestudy FVIII and rFVIIIFc prior to beginning prophylaxis 
treatment with rFVIIIFc.

A total of 55 subjects (91.7%), 55 subjects (91.7%), and 51 subjects (85.0%) had a complete and evaluable 
PK profile for prestudy FVIII, rFVIIIFc, or both, respectively. 
There were 19 subjects in the <6 years of age cohort and 27 subjects in the 6 to <12 years of age cohort 
with complete and evaluable PK profiles for both FVIII and rFVIIIFc within the same individual as measured 
by the one-stage assay. Using the chromogenic assay, 22 subjects in the <6 years of age cohort and 25 
subjects in the 6 to <12 years of age cohort had complete and evaluable PK profiles for both prestudy FVIII 
and rFVIIIFc within the same individual chromogenic assay. 
Population PK analysis 
Data from studies 998HA101 (phase 1/2a adults), 997HA301 (phase 3 adults) and 8HA02PED (phase 3 
children) were used to conduct a population PK analysis.   
The rFVIIIFc modeling dataset included 16 subjects ≥12 years of age from the Phase 1/2a study, 164 
subjects from the Phase 3 study in adults and adolescents ≥12 years of age, and 69 subjects from the Phase 
3 study in children <12 years of age including subjects (from the Phase 3 studies) with episodic trough and 
peak measurements. 
The Advate modeling dataset included 16 subjects from the Phase 1/2a study and 30 subjects from the Phase 
3 study in adults and adolescents ≥12 years of age. 
Mixed-effects modelling with maximal likelihood parameter estimation methods were used to evaluate the 
population characteristics of rFVIIIFc. Activity data, measured by the one-stage clotting assay (aPTT, LLOQ 
was 0.5 IU/dL), was used as a marker of rFVIIIFc PK.  NONMEM versions 7.1.2 and 7.2 were used for 
population PK analysis with Intel Fortran compiler, version 11.1.048 and version 12.1. Simulations of various 
dosing scenarios for dose regimens that might be used in prophylaxis, for the treatment of bleeding episodes, 
and in perioperative care were presented.  
The simulations from the model using only data from adults and adolescents ≥12 years of age showed that: 
- For prophylaxis: A dose of 50 IU/kg every 4 days would show up to 77.4% of the patients with troughs 
above 1%.  Increasing the time interval to 5 days would decrease this percentage to around 50% of patients.  
- For minor to moderate bleeding, the recommendations of the WFH of having peaks between 40 and 60 
IU/dL would be achieved with initial doses of 20-30 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc.  
- For severe bleeding, considering a target of a peak of 80-100 IU/dL, the starting dose should be 40-50 
IU/Kg of rFVIIIFc. 
- For the perioperative treatment, a single treatment simulation has been performed, and therefore, no 
extrapolation to any dosing regimen could be performed. 
The simulations from the model using only data from paediatrics to adults were similar. 
Study 997HA307  
Additionally to the three studies mentioned above, a further study (997HA307) was being conducted to 
evaluate safety and compare the PK of rFVIIIFc from the 3000 and 1000 IU vial strengths. Interim results –
which were later confirmed by the final PK results- are presented in the following table:

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Subjects at selected sites in the Phase 3 study in adults and adolescents ≥12 years of age (997HA301) had 
global haemostasis assays performed, including an exploratory thrombin generation assay (TGA) and, 
dependent upon the selected sites’ testing capabilities, whole blood rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). 
There were wide inter- and to some extent also intra-subject variances in thrombin generation potential.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In haemophilia, pharmacokinetic data are the most important surrogate endpoints for efficacy of a new factor 
VIII product (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009) and PK is assessed for factor VIII activity (FVIII:C).  
Bioavailability studies are not applicable as per the intravenous route of administration for which 
bioavailability is assumed to be 100%; distribution, elimination and metabolism studies are not required in 
accordance with the guideline for the type of product.  
rFVIIIFc PK investigation was conducted in at least 12 previously treated patients from each of the relevant 
age groups (≥12 years, 6 to <12 years and <6 years of age), fulfilling the minimum patient numbers as 
required by the guideline on clinical investigation of FVIII products. 
The overall PK evaluation of rFVIIIFc shows adequate results for all age groups investigated. 
The chosen primary PK parameters, dose-normalized AUC, IR, t1/2, Vd and clearance, are in line with EMA 
guideline requirements. Dosing for treatment of bleeds and for surgery are based on targeting a specific peak 
FVIII level and maintaining the FVIII activity level above a certain trough level for a specified period of time. 
“Peak” levels are measured in PK studies as the maximal concentration (Cmax). Cmax is most influenced by the 
dose administered. In addition, it was determined the times after dosing when FVIII activity had declined 
until 1 IU/dL above baseline (Time 1%) and 3 IU/dL above baseline (Time 3%) as surrogate measures for 
driving the dosing interval in prophylaxis regimen at the doses of 25 IU/Kg, 65 IU/Kg and 50 IU/Kg in adults 
and children.  
In the PK studies in subjects ≥12 years of age (998HA101 and 997HA301), rFVIIIFc PK was compared to PK 
of Advate where prolongation of half-life and reduction of clearance of rFVIIIFc can be observed. The extent 
and relevant extrapolations from this PK pattern are further discussed under clinical efficacy.  
In the PK studies in subjects ≥12 years of age (998HA101 and 997HA301), rFVIIIFc PK was compared to PK 
of Advate and a more favourable PK profile is stated for rFVIIIFc by the MAA. Compared to Advate, 
prolongation of half-life and reduction of clearance of rFVIIIFc can indeed be recognised. In this context, 
though, a possible imbalance in PK sampling for rFVIIIFc (with a sampling time of at least 120 hours) 
compared to Advate (sampling time 72 hours) has to be discussed. Relatively more sampling time points with 
FVIII activity levels near individual baseline and/or lower limit of quantification (LLQ) of the assay for rFVIIIFc 
than for Advate could have biased the PK analysis. As a response to the List of Questions (LoQ), the applicant 
has provided an additional analysis of the PK subgroup of Study 997HA301, for which results are proposed to 
be depicted in the SmPC. The 120 hours sampling time point of rFVIIIFc was excluded in this analysis, which 
is considered a reasonable approach to account for possible imbalances in PK sampling. Depending on the 
type of analysis (compartmental vs non-compartmental) and assay (with different LLQs), indeed a certain 
impact of in-/ or exclusion of the late 120 hours sampling time point of rFVIIIFc can be recognised.  Resulting 
rFVIIIFc half-life ranges from ~17.5 to ~20.5 hours in Study 997HA301, which, however, is still regarded as 
an acceptable range in view of the variety of PK analysis types that were used. The applicant’s additional 
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015 
Page 52/132 
  
  
 
 
analysis could show that the possible impact of imbalanced sampling in Study 997HA301 is negligible. It has 
however been acknowledged, that already between marketed (r)FVIII products, variance of PK parameters 
exists.  
In the Phase 1/2a Study (998HA101), doses of 25 IU/kg and 65 IU/kg were administered for PK evaluation. 
Under a dose of 65 IU/kg, geometric mean of Cmax is 175 IU/dl and 182 IU/dl for Advate and rFVIIIFc, 
respectively. Elevated factor VIII activity levels >150 IU/dl may constitute a risk factor for (venous) 
thromboembolism (Jenkins et al. 2012). In the proposed SmPC, these doses up to 65 mg/dl and for children 
even doses up to 80 mg/dl are recommended for rFVIIIFc long term prophylactic treatment.  
In the PK analysis in trial 8HA02PED, consistent with the known impact of increased CL of coagulation factors 
in younger patients, a shorter t½ of rFVIIIFc was observed as age decreased. In general, the clearance was 
higher in group of children younger than 6 years than in those between 6 and less than 12 years (3.8600 
ml/h/Kg and 3.0490 ml/h/Kg respectively). DNAUCs was lower in the youngest children (25.90 IU x h/dl per 
IU/ Kg and 32.80 IU x h/dl per IU/ Kg, respectively). The geometric mean t½ for rFVIIIFc for subjects in the 
PKAS was 12.277 (95% CI: 10.988, 13.718) hours in the youngest age cohort and 13.451 (95% CI: 11.445, 
15.808) hours in the group of older children, by one stage clotting assay. IR values were slightly lower in 
children younger than 6 years of age. These data suggest that prophylaxis in children can need another 
dosing interval on the prophylaxis regimen different to the adults. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 
factors for study treatment (pre-study FVIII versus rFVIIIFc) and subject is required to know the 
comparability with pre-study FVIII.  
The repeat PK evaluation after continuous treatment in the pivotal trial 997HA301,after the first injection of 
rFVIIIFc. Results showed similar PK parameters and thus satisfies the guideline requirement of demonstrating 
no decrease in FVIII activity after prolonged use. PK parameters of rFVIIIFc as important surrogates of 
rFVIIIFc efficacy have been explored and are in principle considered satisfactory. Summing up, the IR of 
rFVIIIFc is similar to that of the currently available therapies (approximately 2 IU/dL per IU/kg). The PK 
profile of rFVIIIFc is stable with repeat dosing and the lengthening of the half-life would support less frequent 
intravenous administrations. Consistent with the known impact of increased CL of coagulation factors in 
younger patients a shorter t½ of rFVIIIFc was observed as age decreased.  
Overall PK evaluation of rFVIIIFc shows appropriate results. Also prolongation of half-life and reduction of 
clearance of rFVIIIFc could be shown in the PK analysis. As an important finding is however to be considered, 
that under recommended prophylactic doses of 65 IU/kg, elevated factor VIII activity levels >150 IU/dl were 
observed, since these may constitute a risk factor for thromboembolism especially in elderly patients (See 
Clinical Safety). With these considerations in mind, for long term prophylaxis, the recommended dose in the 
SmPC, is 50 IU/kg every 3 to 5 days. The dose may be adjusted based on patient response in the range of 25 
to 65 IU/kg. In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be 
necessary. (see Clinical efficacy)  
In the SmPC, ELOCTA dosing for treatment of bleeding episodes is recommended as 20-40 (IU/dL) for early 
haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or oral bleeding; 30-60 (IU/dL) for more extensive haemarthrosis, muscle 
bleeding or haematoma; 60-100 (IU/dL) for Life threatening haemorrhages. 
When used in surgery the recommended dosing is 60-100 (IU/dL) in case of minor surgery including tooth 
extraction – daily for at least 1 day, until healing is achievedand 80-100 (pre- and post-operative) in major 
surgery every 8 to 24 hours as necessary until adequate wound healing, then therapy at least for another 7 
days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% (IU/dL).

For children below the age of 12, more frequent or higher doses may be required (see Clinical efficacy).  For 
adolescents of 12 years of age and above, the dose recommendations are the same as for adults.  
Appropriate treatment monitoring by determination of factor VIII levels (by one-stage clotting or 
chromogenic assays) is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated 
injections (see SmPC section 4.4). 
A warning statement is included in the SmPC section 4.4 to inform that when using an in vitro thromboplastin 
time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining factor VIII activity in patients’ blood samples, 
plasma factor VIII activity results can be significantly affected by both the type of the aPTT reagent and the 
reference standard used in the assay. This is of importance particularly when changing the laboratory and/or 
reagent used in the assay. 
There is limited experience in patients ≥ 65 years. 
As the Phase 3 study programme was initiated before the final EMA guideline was issued and the requirement 
to evaluate PK of the highest and lowest product strengths was not included in the published draft guideline, 
a clinical study to compare the PK of the rFVIIIFc 1000 IU and 3000 IU vial strengths (Study 997HA307) was 
initiated. Updated data of the PK part of Study 997HA307, as the final analysis, were provided and only minor 
changes to the preliminary results presented. Comparability of the highest rFVIIIFc strength of 3000 IU to 
the strength of 1000 IU is demonstrated and approval of the 3000 IU vial is supported by the PK data of 
Study 997HA307. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall PK evaluation of rFVIIIFc shows adequate results and compared to Advate where applicable, a 
prolongation of half-life and reduction of clearance of rFVIIIFc can be noted. The overall PK evaluation of 
rFVIIIFc shows adequate results for all age groups investigated. 
Posology recommendations are agreed and appropriately reflected in the SmPC – also in the light of clinical 
efficacy and safety (see later sections).

Treatments 
For subjects in the sequential PK subgroup, the 50 IU/kg dose for rFVIIIFc Day 0 and for rFVIIIFc at Week 
14, or 12 to 24 weeks after rFVIIIFc Day 0, were slowly administered to the subject IV by hand over 5 (±2) 
minutes. For all other clinic administrations and at-home administration (i.e., self-administration), rFVIIIFc 
was to be injected IV over several minutes.  
Arm 1, Individualized (Tailored) Prophylaxis 
Initial twice weekly dosing with 25 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc on Day 1 and 50 IU/kg on Day 4, followed by 
individualized dose and interval modification within the range of 25 to 65 IU/kg every 3 to 5 days to maintain 
a trough level of 1% to 3% (or higher, as clinically indicated) rFVIIIFc activity; further increases to target 
trough level up to 5% as required for bleeding. 
Sequential PK subgroup, at selected sites, for full PK profiling at Day 0 and 12 to 24 weeks after Day 0 
Sequential PK: single dose of 50 IU/kg Advate (Advate Day 0) prior to the first dose of rFVIIIFc, followed by 
single dose of 50 IU rFVIIIFc (rFVIIIFc Day 0) within 8 weeks of Advate dose and following at least 96 hours 
washout from Advate or any other FVIII product. Second single dose of 50 IU rFVIIIFc at Week 14 or 12 to 
24 weeks after rFVIIIFc Day 0 Prophylaxis 
Arm 2, Weekly Prophylaxis 
65 IU/kg rFVIIIFc every 7 days 
Arm 3, Episodic (On-Demand) Dosing 
Initial single dose of 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc followed by 10 to 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc, as required to treat a bleeding 
episode 
Modification of Dose and/or Dosing Interval for Subjects in Arm 1 
For subjects in Arm 1 (individualized prophylaxis), PK data from samples collected following the first dose of 
rFVIIIFc at Day 0 were to be used to estimate the subject’s PK parameters and to guide the appropriate dose 
or interval of dosing.

Bleeding episodes 
From screening to first dose of rFVIIIFc, bleeding episodes were to be treated with the subject’s previous 
FVIII product. After the first dose of rFVIIIFc, if a subject experienced bleeding of any kind (spontaneous or 
traumatic), rFVIIIFc was to be given at 10 to 50 IU/kg. 
Treatment of Subjects in Perioperative Management (Surgery) Subgroup 
In the case of minor surgery, subjects were to be treated with rFVIIIFc, according to local standard treatment 
guidelines for FVIII. Doses higher than 65 IU/kg were allowed in this study in cases of surgery or severe 
bleeding to achieve the required FVIII levels to control and prevent bleeding, while the maximum number of 
daily or every other day doses was not to exceed the Cmax of approximately 150% of normal (normal ranges 
are 50% to 150% FVIII activity).

-  QoL via hemophilia-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire for children and parents 
(Haemo-QoL; for ages 13 to 16 years) or hemophilia-specific HRQoL questionnaire for adults (Haem-A-
QoL; for ages 17 years and above) 
Assessment of response was recorded using the following 4-point scale: 
Excellent: bleeding episodes responded to less than or the usual number of injections or less than or the 
usual dose of rFVIIIFc, or the rate of breakthrough bleeding during prophylaxis was less than or equal to that 
usually observed. 
Effective: most bleeding episodes responded to the same number of injections and dose, but some required 
more injections or higher doses, or there was a minor increase in the rate of breakthrough bleeding. 
Partially Effective: bleeding episodes most often required more injections and/or higher doses than expected, 
or adequate breakthrough bleeding prevention during prophylaxis required more frequent injections and/or 
higher doses. 
Ineffective: routine failure to control hemostasis or hemostatic control required additional agents. 
Surgery Subgroup: 
- 
Investigators’/Surgeons’ assessments of subjects’ response to surgery with rFVIIIFc, using a bleeding 
response scale. 
-  Number of injections and dose per injection required to maintain hemostasis during the surgical period 
- 
Estimated blood loss during surgery  
-  Number and type of blood component transfusions required during surgery  
Assessment of Clinical Response to rFVIIIFc Treatment for Bleeding 
The following 4-point scale was used throughout the study for subjects’ self-assessment of response to 
treatment with rFVIIIFc for bleeding episodes: Excellent, Good, Moderate, and No Response. 
Excellent: abrupt pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8 hours after the 
initial injection 
Good: definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8 hours after a single 
injection, but possibly requiring more than one injection after 24 to 48 hours for complete resolution 
Moderate: probable or slight beneficial effect within approximately 8 hours after the initial injection and 
requires more than one injection 
No response: no improvement, or condition worsens, within approximately 8 hours after the initial injection 
Assessment of Response to Surgery 
The Investigator/Surgeon who completed the surgical procedures was to assess the subject’s response to 
surgery with rFVIIIFc treatment using a 4-point clinical scale as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015 
Page 60/132 
  
  
 
 
Excellent: Intraoperative and postoperative blood loss similar to (or less than) the nonhemophilic patient. 
No extra doses of rFVIIIFc needed and Blood component transfusions required are similar to nonhemophilic 
patient 
Good: Intraoperative and/or postoperative bleeding slightly increased over expectations for the 
nonhemophilic patient, but the difference was not clinically significant. 
Intraoperative blood loss no more than 250 mL greater than expected for a nonhemophilic patient and 
No extra doses of rFVIIIFc needed and Blood component transfusions required are similar to nonhemophilic 
patient 
Fair: Intraoperative and/or postoperative blood loss is increased over expectation for the nonhemophilic 
patient and additional treatment was needed. 
Intraoperative blood loss 250 to 500 mL greater than expected for person without hemophilia or 
Extra dose of rFVIIIFc factor needed or Increased blood component transfusion requirement 
Poor/none: Significant intraoperative and/or postoperative bleeding that was substantially increased over 
expectations for the nonhemophilic patient, required intervention, and was not explained by a 
surgical/medical issue other than hemophilia Intraoperative blood loss >500 mL greater than for the 
nonhemophilic patient or Unexpected hypotension or unexpected transfer to intensive care unit due to 
bleeding or Substantially increased blood component transfusion requirement 
Sample size 
A sufficient number of subjects to assess the efficacy and safety of rFVIIIFc, would be approximately 144 
subjects to be enrolled into 3 treatment arms per the designed allocation. 
A key safety objective for any study of a new FVIII product is the evaluation of inhibitor development. 
Assuming that 2 or fewer subjects experience an inhibitor during the study (i.e., the observed incidence is 
less than or equal to 1.9% when using only the 104 subjects with at least 50 EDs in the denominator), then 
the upper bound of an exact (Clopper-Pearson) 2-sided, 95% CI would exclude 6.8%. Assuming that the true 
inhibitor incidence for the population eligible for this study is no greater than 1.0%, then there is at least 
80% probability of no more than 2 subjects out of 144 developing an inhibitor. 
The hypothesis test to compare the annualized bleeding rate between Arm 1 (individualized prophylaxis) and 
Arm 3 (episodic dosing) has greater than 90% power to detect a 60% reduction in annualized bleeding 
episodes (for example, from 10 to 4 bleeding episodes per subject per year) under the following conditions: 
-The hypothesis test is conducted at the 2-sided 0.05 level of significance. 
-A minimum of 1320 and 400 subject-weeks of follow-up are observed in Arm 1 and 
-Arm 3, respectively. This would be surpassed if, for example, 104 subjects in Arm 1 and 20 subjects in Arm 
3 are followed for bleeding episodes for at least 26 weeks. 
-The true annualized bleeding rate for the population of subjects using episodic treatment is 10 bleeding 
episodes per subject per year or greater. 
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015 
Page 61/132 
  
  
 
 
-To be considered of clinical importance, there must be at least a 50% reduction in the annualized bleeding 
rate. 
Assuming the standard deviation of differences (rFVIIIFc – Advate) for the primary PK endpoints is no more 
than 0.45, then a comparison of log-transformed endpoints using an ANOVA model with factors for study 
treatment and subject will have at least 90% power to detect a 1.5-fold increase (rFVIIIFc over Advate) at 
the 2-sided, 0.05 level of significance. 
Randomisation 
Subjects presenting on an on-demand schedule who do not opt to enter Arm 1 will be randomized on 
enrollment into either Arm 2 or Arm 3. Randomization will be stratified according to the subject’s annualized 
bleeding frequency, calculated based on bleeding episodes reported during the 12 months prior to screening: 
1. 12 to 20 bleeding episodes per year 
2. 21 to 50 bleeding episodes per year 
3. >50 bleeding episodes per year 
Blinding (masking) 
This is an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
The All-Enrolled Analysis Set was defined as subjects who were registered as enrolled by IXRS and assigned a 
unique subject identification number. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of rFVIIIFc. The analysis 
of efficacy was performed in this population. Subjects who received a dose of Advate, but did not receive any 
rFVIIIFc, were not included in this population. 
The Safety Analysis Set was defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of Advate or at least 1 dose 
of rFVIIIFc. The analysis of safety was performed in this population. 
The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PKAS) was defined as all subjects in Arms 1, 2, or 3 who had completed 
evaluable sampling timepoints (through at least the 48-hour timepoint for the Advate profile or the 72-hour 
timepoint for the rFVIIIFc PK profiling) to allow the acceptable determination of the terminal half-life. 
The Sequential PK Subgroup was defined as subjects who had evaluable PK profiles for both Advate and 
baseline rFVIIIFc and/or evaluable PK profiles for both baseline rFVIIIFc and the repeat rFVIIIFc profile. 
Annualized Measurements 
The number of bleeding episodes was annualized for each subject using the following formula: 
Annualized bleeding rate =Number of bleeding episodes during the efficacy period /Total number of days 
during the efficacy period × 365.25 
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015 
Page 62/132 
  
  
 
 
Consumption 
The total annualized rFVIIIFc consumption (IU/kg) was calculated for each subject using the following 
formula: 
Annualized consumption = Total IU/kg of study drug received during the efficacy period/ total number of 
days during the efficacy period × 365.25 
The total amount of rFVIIIFc received was the sum of the nominal IU/kg administered for each injection 
based on the units of rFVIIIFc as recorded from the subject’s EPD and eCRF and his most recent weight. 
Total annualized rFVIIIFc consumption was determined for the efficacy period (i.e., excluding the PK period, 
surgery/rehabilitation periods, minor surgeries, and procedures). Consumption for surgery/rehabilitation and 
minor surgeries or procedures was analyzed separately. 
Handling of Missing Data 
No imputation for missing data was applied for analyses of efficacy endpoints. 
Primary  efficacy  endpoint;  annualized  number  of  breakthrough  bleeding  episodes  (spontaneous  and 
traumatic) during the efficacy period, referred to as an annualized bleeding rate.  
Bleeding episodes classified as unknown were also included in the determination of the annualized bleeding 
rate. The comparison of annualized bleeding rates between Arm 1 (individualized [tailored] prophylaxis) and 
Arm 3 (episodic [on-demand] dosing) was assessed using a Poisson regression model with treatment arm as 
covariate. If the treatment factor in the Poisson regression model failed to show statistical significance at the 
2-sided 5% level, then the study would have failed to demonstrate a difference between the individualized 
prophylaxis regimen and the episodic regimen. If the estimated ratio of annualized bleeding rates 
(individualized prophylaxis:episodic) is less than 0.5 (i.e., greater than a 50% reduction) clinical importance 
of the individualized prophylaxis regimen will have been demonstrated. If no overdispersion was detected at 
the 2-sided 5% level of significance (using the method of Wetherill and Brown [Wetherill and Brown 1991]), 
results from the Poisson regression model were to be used. Otherwise, a negative binomial model, which 
accounts for overdispersion, was to be used. Test results were tabulated by treatment arm along with the 
bleeding rate ratios and their 95% CI.

Table 15 
A total of 153 subjects (92.7%) completed the study, and 12 subjects (7.3%) discontinued the study 
prematurely. The reasons for premature discontinuation were consent withdrawn (4 subjects, 2.4%), other (3 
subjects, 1.8%), AEs (2 subjects, 1.2%), physician decision (due to concerns about patient compliance) [2 
subjects, 1.2%], and death (1 subject, 0.6%) 
Of the 3 subjects who discontinued for other reasons, 1 subject was incarcerated, 1 subject was traveling and 
could not ensure proper temperature conditions for study treatment, and 1 subject was not willing to reveal 
the reason for wanting to complete the early termination visit. 
Of the 2 subjects who discontinued as a result of AEs, 1 subject experienced rash and 1 subject experienced 
a femur fracture. One additional subject experienced an AE (arthralgia) that resulted in discontinuation of 
study treatment; however, the reason for discontinuation was recorded as withdrawal of consent. Another 
subject experienced AEs that may have contributed to the subject’s decision to withdraw consent. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol Amendment 1 mainly introduced an increase to the sample size of Arm 1 from 66 to 104 subjects to 
ensure an adequate number of subjects with 50 EDs to support the evaluation of inhibitor development 
assuming that 2 or fewer subjects experience an inhibitor during the study (i.e., the observed incidence is 
less than or equal to 1.9%). The number of investigational sites was increased from 65 to approximately 75. 
The number of subjects who could be replaced was increased from 30 to 36. 
Protocol Amendment 2 was made to reduce the required washout period from any FVIII product before 
collecting blood samples for PK assessment from 96 hours to 72 hours for adolescent subjects.

Protocol Amendment 3, introduced clarifications on end-of-study definition and criteria for recommending a 
modification of dose or dosing interval for subjects in Arm 1. 
Baseline data 
.  
Table 16 
A total of 153 subjects had a measured FVIII activity of <1% at either screening or baseline. Two additional 
subjects had a measured FVIII activity of <1% during the study period. All other subjects had either a 
genotype associated with severe haemophilia or a documented history of FVIII activity of <1% measured at 
the site. Ten subjects didn’t have on-study FVIII activity of <1%; 2 were in Arm 2, and 8 were in Arm 1. 
At study entry, 78 subjects (47.3%) were on a prior episodic regimen. The median number of bleeding 
episodes reported in the prior 12 months in the subjects on a prior episodic regimen in Arms 1 and 2 was 
similar to the median number of bleeding episodes reported in subjects in Arm 3. Within Arm 1, the median 
number of bleeding episodes reported in subjects on a prior episodic regimen was greater than the median 
number on prior prophylaxis (Table 17).

Protocol Deviations 
Of the 67 subjects with major protocol deviations, 12 subjects (8.5%) were identified as having deviations 
that were considered to have a potential impact on the primary efficacy endpoint 
Numbers analysed 
Of the 164 subjects in the FAS, 1 subject in Arm 2 did not contribute data for the efficacy period since this 
subject withdrew after the PK evaluation and no efficacy evaluations could be made. 
Therefore, efficacy endpoints were analyzed for 163 subjects: 117 in the individualized (tailored) prophylaxis 
(Arm 1), 23 in the weekly prophylaxis (Arm 2), and 23 in the episodic (on-demand) dosing (Arm 3). 
The comparison of PK parameters between Advate and rFVIIIFc was performed using the sequential PK 
subgroup of Arm 1, which contained 29 evaluable subjects. 
PK endpoints were analyzed using the PK Analysis Set, which included 155 subjects: 110 in Arm 1, 23 in Arm 
2, and 22 in Arm 3.

Table 19 
The annualized bleeding rate estimated from the negative binomial model was 2.91 (95% CI, 2.30, 3.68) in 
Arm 1, 8.92 (95% CI, 5.48, 14.51) in Arm 2, and 37.25 (95% CI, 24.03, 57.74) in Arm 3 
The bleeding rate ratios obtained from the model were 0.08 (p<0.001) for Arm 1 versus Arm 3, and 0.24 
(p<0.001) for Arm 2 versus Arm 3, indicating that the annualized bleeding rate was significantly reduced by 
92% (Arm 1) and 76% (Arm 2) by using either the individualized prophylaxis or weekly prophylaxis 
compared with episodic treatment

Subjects’ Assessments of Response to Treatment with rFVIIIFc for Bleeding 
Episodes 
Overall, 77.6% of rFVIIIFc injections were rated by subjects as producing an excellent or good response. 
Responses were similar whether treatment occurred within 8 hours or after 8 hours from the onset of the 
bleeding episode. 
Of a total of 880 injections for a bleeding episode in Arms 1, 2, and 3 during the study, 860 were evaluated 
for response ; 667 (77.6%) injections were rated by subjects as an excellent or good response, 187 (21.7%) 
were rated as moderate, and 6 (0.7%) were rated as no response

Annualized Bleeding Rates by Type and Location of Bleed 
A low annualized bleeding rate was observed for spontaneous, joint, and spontaneous joint bleeding episodes 
in subjects on a prophylaxis regimen. 
Consistent with the overall bleeding rate, the rate of both spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes was 
lower in the prophylactic arms compared to the episodic arm. A median of 0.00, 1.93, and 20.24 
spontaneous bleeding episodes (mean of 1.70, 5.23, and 26.17) and a median of 0.00, 1.69, and 9.25 
traumatic bleeding episodes (mean of 1.17, 3.58, and 10.84) were reported by subjects in Arms 1, 2, and 3, 
respectively. When summarized by location and type, the rate of spontaneous joint bleeding episodes was 
very low in the prophylactic arms, with a median of 0.00, 0.00, and 18.59 spontaneous bleeding episodes 
located in a joint (mean of 1.33, 4.15, and 21.10) reported by subjects in Arms 1, 2, and 3, respectively 
(Table 22).

Number of Injections and Dose per Injection for Resolution of a Bleeding Episode 
Overall, 97.8% of bleeding episodes were controlled with ≤2 injections of rFVIIIFc, with 87.3% controlled by 
1 injection. Per bleeding episode, the median dose per injection required for resolution of bleeding was 27.35 
IU/kg, and the median total dose required was 28.23 IU/kg. 
For resolution of each bleeding episode in Arms 1, 2, and 3, the median dose per injection was 29.94, 21.65, 
and 26.46 IU/kg, respectively, and the median total dose was 32.63, 30.26, and 27.35 IU/kg, respectively 
The number of bleeding episodes requiring a second injection was small (96 bleeding episodes overall for 46 
subjects), with the median interval per bleeding episode of 30.9 hours overall and 27.5, 27.5, and 36.0 hours 
for Arms 1, 2, and 3, respectively

QoL Questionnaires 
For subjects from Arm 1 aged 17 years and older The median change from baseline to Week 28 suggests that 
subjects on a prior episodic regimen reported an improvement in their QoL in the domains of physical health 
(-25.00), feelings (-6.25), and work and school (-6.25) . There was no change in QoL for subjects switching 
from a prior prophylaxis regimen. 
For subjects from Arm 2 and 3 aged 17 years and older 
At Week 14 there was an improvement in QoL for subjects in Arm 2 in the domains of physical health (-
10.00), feelings (-6.25), and sports and leisure (-10.00). These changes were also evident at Week 28, 
although there were fewer subjects who completed the questionnaire at this timepoint. For subjects in Arm 3, 
there was an improvement in the domain of feelings at Week 14 (-6.25) that was not evident at Week 28 
EQ-5D Questionnaire 
The EQ-5D visual analogue scale recorded a response from 0 to 100 representing a subject’s overall self-
rated health state with high scores indicating better QoL. The EQ-5D visual analogue scale was performed at 
Screening and Weeks 14, 28, 38, and 52. 
Across all arms, there was a small increase from baseline in the EQ-5D visual analogue scale that ranged 
from 1.6 to 4.4. Results were similar when summarized by prior regimen. The small magnitude of the change 
across all arms indicates that QoL as recorded by the EQ-5D visual analogue scale remained stable over the

course of the study. These results are consistent with expectations given the short timeframe between 
baseline and end-of-study assessments for most subjects and the fact that the EQ-5D is a general instrument 
and not designed specifically for patients with hemophilia. 
Perioperative Management (Surgery) Subgroup 
Major Surgery 
A total of 9 major surgeries were performed in 9 subjects. 
Hemostasis was rated as excellent or good by the Investigators/Surgeons for 9 major surgeries, indicating 
that intraoperative and postoperative blood loss was comparable to what would be expected for a subject 
who does not have hemophilia. Assessment of hemostasis was to be recorded by Investigators/Surgeons 
approximately 24 hours postoperatively 
Blood loss was estimated for 7 of the 9 surgeries. The median estimated blood loss was 15.0 mL during 
major surgery and 0.0 mL postoperatively (i.e., from the day following the day of surgery until discharge 
from the hospital); the mean estimated blood loss was 166.7 mL during major surgery and 214.3 mL 
postoperatively. A single subject required transfusion during the surgical period. 
Overall, 100% of major surgeries required a single injection of rFVIIIFc to maintain hemostasis, and the 
median dose per injection was 51.4 IU/kg. On the day of surgery, most subjects received 2 injections with 
the total dose ranging from 65.8 to 115.4 IU/kg/day. 
The median rFVIIIFc consumption was 80.55 IU/kg on the day of major surgery, 161.29 IU/kg for the first 3 
days following the day of surgery, 387.10 IU/kg for Days 4 through 14 following surgery, and 539.03 IU/kg 
for the first 14 days following the day of surgery. No subject reported a bleeding episode during the 
postoperative/rehabilitation period

Minor Surgeries 
A total of 17 minor surgeries were performed in 15 subjects during the study: 7 surgeries in Arm 1, 5 in Arm 
2, and 5 in Arm 3. Twelve subjects received rFVIIIFc for perioperative management (surgical prophylaxis) in 
14 minor surgical procedures; the remaining 3 minor procedures were performed prior to the first dose of 
rFVIIIFc. Surgeons’ assessments of hemostasis were collected at least 24 hours following the procedure for 
12 minor surgeries. Hemostasis was rated as excellent for 11 minor surgeries and as good for 1 minor 
surgery. 
Exploratory Endpoints 
Investigators’ Global Assessment of Subjects’ Response to rFVIIIFc 
The Investigators’ global assessment of the subjects’ response to their rFVIIIFc regimen was excellent or 
effective for 99.3% of the subjects’ visits.

During the 5 visits in which data were collected, the Investigators’ global assessment of the subjects’ 
response to their rFVIIIFc regimen was excellent for 69.5% of the visits, effective for 29.8% of the visits, and 
partially effective for 0.7% of the visits. There were no subjects whose response to the rFVIIIFc regimen was 
assessed as ineffective at any visits The assessments remained consistent over the course of the study. The 
global response to the rFVIIIFc regimen was assessed as excellent or effective for 99.4% of subjects (154 of 
155 subjects) at Week 7, for 98.7% of subjects (152 of 154 subjects) at Week 14, for 100.0% of subjects 
(90 of 90 subjects) at Week 28, for 100.0% of subjects (19 of 19 subjects) at Week 38, and for 100.0% of 
subjects (12 of 12 subjects) at Week 52. 
Ancillary analyses 
Summary of Annualized Bleeding Rates by Hemophilia Characteristics 
Subjects were grouped by frequency of prior bleeding episodes, and for all groups there was a lower 
annualized bleeding rate for subjects on a prophylaxis regimen, relative to episodic treatment . Distribution of 
subjects within categories of the number of bleeding episodes was variable across arms. The percentage of 
subjects in Arms 1, 2, and 3 who had the highest pre-study bleeding frequency (>50 bleeding episodes) was 
6%, 13%, and 17%, respectively, and their median annualized bleeding rates were 5.89, 1.93, and 52.09 
(mean rates of 6.13, 3.43, and 51.49), respectively. 
Because the number of bleeding episodes in Arms 1 and 2 in the prior 12 months is dependent on the 
subjects’ previous treatment regimen, change in annualized bleeding rates was evaluated separately for prior 
prophylaxis and episodic treatment. When compared with the number of bleeding episodes in the 12 months 
prior to study start, based on subject-reported historical data, the observed annualized bleeding rates for 
subjects on a prior prophylaxis regimen showed a decrease in their annualized bleeding rates from their prior 
frequency of bleeding. Subjects on a prior episodic regimen had a decrease in their annualized bleeding rate 
when treated with a prophylaxis regimen on study (Table 26).

Among the subjects who participated in the efficacy period, there were 111 with target joints at Screening 
(61.5% of Arm 1, 91.3% of Arm 2, and 78.3% of Arm 3) and 52 with no target joints at Screening (38.5% of 
Arm 1, 8.7% of Arm 2, and 21.7% of Arm 3). The median annualized bleeding rates for subjects with no 
target joints present were 0.00, 20.32, and 28.45 (means of 1.85, 20.32, and 27.04) in Arms 1, 2, and 3, 
respectively. Out of 111 subjects with target joints, 69 subjects had less than or equal to the median number 
(38% of Arm 1, 61% of Arm 2, and 48% of Arm 3), and 42 subjects had greater than the median number 
(24% of Arm 1, 30% of Arm 2, and 30% of Arm 3). The median annualized bleeding rates in Arms 1, 2, and 
3 for subjects with less than or equal to the median number of target joints were 1.50, 3.64, and 45.42 
(means of 2.96, 9.84, and 44.18), respectively; the median annualized bleeding rates for subjects with 
greater than the median number of target joints were 3.68, 2.01, and 32.04 (means of 4.55, 3.48, and 
33.60), respectively. 
Summary of Annualized Bleeding Rates by Age 
Thirteen subjects aged 12 through 17 years (9% of Arm 1 and 9% of Arm 3),149 subjects aged 18 through 
64 years (90% of Arm 1, 96% of Arm 2, and 91% of Arm 3), and 1 subject aged ≥65 years (1% in Arm 1) 
contributed data in the efficacy period. For subjects aged 12 through 17 years, the median annualized 
bleeding rates were 1.92 and 28.85 (mean rates of 2.63 and 28.85) in Arms 1 and 3, respectively. For 
subjects aged 18 through 64 years, the median annualized bleeding rates were 1.44, 3.59, and 33.57 (mean 
rates of 2.88, 8.81, and 38.03) in Arms 1, 2, and 3, respectively

An Open-Label, Multicenter Evaluation of Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of Recombinant Coagulation 
Factor VIII Fc Fusion Protein, BIIB031, in the Prevention and Treatment of Bleeding Episodes in Pediatric 
Subjects With Hemophilia A This study was conducted to assess the PK, efficacy, and safety of rFVIIIFc in 
previously treated pediatric patients <12 years of age with hemophilia A. 
Methods 
Inhibitor History and Testing 
Subjects were tested for inhibitor formation at each clinic visit prior to dosing.  
Testing for inhibitors was conducted within the first 10 to 15 EDs to rFVIIIFc. A Washout Period of at least 48 
hours was required prior to inhibitor testing. A positive result for inhibitor development is any inhibitor (≥0.6 
Bethesda units [BU]/mL) identified and confirmed on 2 separate samples drawn approximately 2 to 4 weeks 
apart. A low-titer inhibitor is defined as ≥0.6 but <5.0 BU/mL that was identified and confirmed on 2 
separate samples drawn approximately 2 to 4 weeks apart. A high-titer inhibitor is defined as ≥5.0 BU/mL 
that was identified and confirmed on 2 separate samples drawn approximately 2 to 4 weeks apart.

Figure 5 
Bleeding and Treatment for Bleeding Episodes 
The occurrence of bleeding in this study was obtained from EPDs and any medical records while the subject 
was receiving study treatment. The clinical sites and monitors ensured that there was consistency between 
the subject’s medical record, source documents, EPDs, and eCRFs. During the clinical visits and telephone 
calls with the subject’s caregiver once a month, the Investigator verified whether or not a bleeding episode 
had occurred and, if so, whether the bleed was “spontaneous” or “traumatic.” If, following this discussion, the 
Investigator judged that the subject’s caregiver classification was incorrect, the Investigator documented it in 
(1) the subject’s medical notes with the rationale for the new classification and (2) the eCRF, documenting 
the new classification of the bleeding episode according to the Investigator and whether or not the subject’s 
caregiver agreed with this new classification. With regard to dose changes, the Investigator’s classification of 
“spontaneous” or “traumatic” was used (if different from the classification recorded in the EPD by the 
caregiver). Data from both spontaneous bleeding episodes and traumatic bleeding episodes were collected. 
Each subject’s caregiver rated the treatment response to rFVIIIFc to any bleeding episodes using the 
following 4-point scale: 
- Excellent: abrupt pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8 hours after the 
initial injection 
- Good: definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8 hours after a 
single injection but possibly requiring more than 1 injection after 24 to 48 hours for complete resolution 
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015 
Page 82/132 
  
  
 
 
 
-Moderate: probable or slight beneficial effect within approximately 8 hours after the initial injection and 
required more than 1 injection 
- None: no improvement or condition worsened within approximately 8 hours after the initial injection 
Response could have also been assessed by the Physician/Investigator for those subjects who were treated in 
the clinic or hospital with rFVIIIFc for major bleeding episodes or postsurgery until discharge from the 
hospital. 
Physician’s Global Assessment 
Investigators recorded assessments of each subject’s response to his assigned rFVIIIFc regimen using the 
following 4-point scale: 
- Excellent: Bleeding episodes responded to less than or equal to the usual number of injections or less than 
or equal to the usual dose of rFVIIIFc or the rate of breakthrough bleeding during prophylaxis was less than 
or equal to that usually observed. 
- Effective: Most bleeding episodes responded to the same number of injections and dose, but some required 
more injections or higher doses, or there was a minor increase in the rate of breakthrough bleeding. 
-Partially Effective: Bleeding episodes most often required more injections and/or higher doses than 
expected, or adequate breakthrough bleeding prevention during prophylaxis required more frequent 
injections and/or higher doses. 
-Ineffective: Routine failure to control hemostasis or hemostatic control required additional agents

6. Current systemic treatment with chemotherapy and/or other immunosuppressant drugs, with the following 
exceptions: use of steroids for treatment of asthma or management of acute allergic episodes, and routine 
immunizations. 
7. Participation within the past 30 days in any other clinical study involving investigational drugs. 
8. Surgery within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit (visit could be rescheduled and subject screened). 
Treatments 
The starting dose regimen for this study was 25 IU/kg on Day 1 and 50 IU/kg on Day 4 rFVIIIFc administered 
twice weekly and was selected based on data from adult subjects who participated in the rFVIIIFc Phase 1 
studyProphylactic dose and interval adjustments were made as follows: 
-The dose was increased or decreased in increments of at least 5 IU/kg. 
-The maximum prophylactic dose that was given was 80 IU/kg/injection. 
-The dosing interval was shortened based on the subject’s rFVIIIFc PK results, FVIII trough level, and clinical 
bleeding profile. The shortest dosing interval allowed was every 2 days if it was necessary in order to 
maintain adequate FVIII activity trough levels and to prevent spontaneous bleeding events. 
The maximum dose used for treatment of bleeding and surgery was expected to be 100 IU/kg. 
In the case of minor surgery, subjects were treated with rFVIIIFc during the minor intervention, according to 
local standard treatment guidelines for FVIII.  
Subjects who underwent major surgery within 2 weeks before the end of study had their End-of-Study Visit 
performed no earlier than 14 days after surgery.

For any major surgery, blood draws were taken at least daily while the subject was hospitalized. 
A blood sample for daily FVIII levels was taken while the subject remained in the hospital. The sample was 
tested at the local laboratory so that monitoring of the subject occurred in real time. 
A duplicate plasma sample was prepared by making a separate aliquot for each blood sample drawn so that 
subsequent analysis at the central laboratory could be performed. Doses up to 100 IU/kg were allowed in this 
study in cases of surgery or severe bleeding to achieve the required FVIII levels to control and prevent 
bleeding.

Statistical methods 
The Full Analysis Set was defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of rFVIIIFc. Analyses of 
efficacy, patient-reported outcomes, and health outcomes were performed in this population. 
The Safety Analysis Set was defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of their prestudy FVIII 
treatment for the purpose of evaluating PK or at least 1 dose of rFVIIIFc. 
Sample size 
The determination of the number of subjects was based on clinical rather than statistical considerations. 
Taking into account recommendations from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use [EMA 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009) 2011], approximately 68 subjects (approximately 34 in each age cohort) 
were dosed with rFVIIIFc to achieve a minimum of 25 subjects with at least 50 EDs in each age cohort (<6 
and 6 to <12 years of age). This allowed for a 25% drop-out rate. 
Results 
Recruitment 
A total of 71 male subjects were enrolled in the study, and 69 of those subjects were treated with rFVIIIFc. A 
subject was considered enrolled if he received a PK baseline dose of prestudy FVIII or the study drug 
rFVIIIFc. The first subject was enrolled in the PK subgroup on 09 October 2012. The first PK dose of rFVIIIFc 
was administered on 01 November 2012. 
Subjects were assigned to the appropriate age cohort (<6 years of age or 6 to <12 years of age) at the time 
of screening. The age cohort assigned at Screening was used in all analyses unless otherwise stated. 
Of the 71 enrolled subjects, 36 subjects were assigned to the <6 years of age cohort, and 35 subjects were 
assigned to the 6 to <12 years of age cohort. The study was conducted at 23 investigational sites in 8 
countries and represented a broad global sampling. The countries with the greatest number of enrolled 
subjects were United Kingdom (20 subjects), US (20 subjects), and South Africa (11 subjects) 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol Deviations 
Of the 38 subjects with major protocol deviations, 2 subjects were identified as having deviations that were 
considered to have a potential impact on the annualized bleeding rate. The first subject took Advate during 
the Efficacy Period; use of any FVIII product except the study drug, rFVIIIFc, was forbidden in the study. The 
Assessment report

second subject had >80% of his prophylactic dosing intervals noncompliant with his prescribed prophylactic 
dosing regimen. 
There were 38 subjects (55.1%) with deviations that were considered major; 24 subjects (34.8%) had 
informed consent issues, 2 subjects (2.9%) took excluded medication, and 22 subjects (31.9%) had 
deviations based on other criteria. Every deviation associated with the completion of the ICF or the process of 
consent was considered major, regardless of whether the deviation was considered to be clinically 
meaningful. The majority of informed consent issues were administrative in nature, such as missing initials 
on individual pages or errors that were corrected prior to any study-specific procedures being performed. 
The major deviations characterized as “other” were cited based on IP compliance criteria, administrative 
criteria, study procedures criteria, Regulatory Agency or Clinical Events Committee approval criteria, or other 
criteria; and included such issues as study-related tasks being performed by staff members not listed as 
delegates, IP shipments improperly documented by the receiving pharmacy, missing PI signature on physical 
examination assessment, incomplete physical examination or physical examination not performed during the 
Screening Visit, and noncompliance with the prescribed dose and/or regimen. 
Baseline data 
All subjects were male. The median overall age was 5.0 years (range, 1 to 11 years); in the <6 years of age 
cohort, the median age was 4.0 years (range, 1 to 5 years), and in the 6 to <12 years of age cohort, the 
median age was 8.0 years (range, 6 to 11 years). The median weight was 17.25 kg (range, 13.0 to 23.8 kg) 
for subjects <6 years of age and 31.35 kg (range, 19.1 to 59.6 kg) for subjects in the 6 to <12 years of age 
cohort. The predominant races represented in the study were white (67.6%) and black or African American 
(12.7%). 
A total of 65 subjects (91.5%) had a measured FVIII activity of <1% at Baseline Screening. In accordance 
with the Study 8HA02PED protocol, FVIII levels of <1% were verified in the medical records of the other 6 
subjects (8.5%).

Baseline physical examination findings were consistent with those expected in a pediatric population with 
severe hemophilia, with abnormalities of extremities/joints reported in 13 subjects (18.3%). The other most 
frequent findings noted during the baseline physical examination were musculoskeletal abnormalities, 
reported in 9 subjects (12.7%), and skin abnormalities, predominantly bruising and ecchymosis, reported in 
9 subjects (12.7%) 
Collectively, the study population demonstrated good joint health, as reflected in the results of the HJHS, 
which was administered to all subjects 4 years of age and older at Screening. In the overall population, the 
median joint score, gait score, and total score were 0.0 (range: 0 to 19), 0.0 (range: 0 to 3), and 1.0 (range: 
0 to 21), respectively 
Prior FVIII Therapy 
For the 63 subjects who were treated prophylactically with FVIII, 3 subjects (4.8%) reported a dosing 
frequency of 1 injection per week, 13 subjects (20.6%) reported 2 injections per week, and 47 subjects 
(74.6%) reported 3 or more injections per week (31 subjects were dosed 3 times per week, and 16 subjects 
were dosed every other day). The distribution of dosing frequencies was similar between both age cohorts. 
Across the entire study population (71 subjects), the majority of subjects (55 subjects; 74.3%) used a 
recombinant FVIII product prior to study entry. The median dose typically used to treat bleeding episodes 
was 25.0 IU/kg (range: 13 to 72) for minor bleeding episodes, 40.0 IU/kg (range: 13 to 72) for moderate 
bleeding episodes, and 50.0 IU/kg (range: 13 to 100) for major bleeding episodes. 
Numbers analysed 
The Safety Analysis Set, including all enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of prestudy FVIII 
treatment for the purpose of evaluating PK or at least 1 dose of rFVIIIFc, was composed of 71 subjects 
(100%). The Full Analysis Set included only those 69 subjects who received rFVIIIFc; 2 subjects received

prestudy FVIII but were not treated with rFVIIIFc There were no subjects in the surgery subgroup, defined as 
subjects who have undergone major surgery after the first dose of study treatment 
The majority of subjects (59 subjects; 85.5%) participated in the study for at least 24 weeks (<6 years of 
age: 74.3%; 6 to <12 years of age: 97.1%). The median time on the study was 26.3 weeks (range: 2 to 31 
weeks) for the overall study population, 26.0 weeks (range: 2 to 28 weeks) for the <6 years of age cohort, 
and 26.3 weeks (range: 22 to 31 weeks) for the 6 to <12 years of age cohort 
A total of 61 subjects (88.4%) had ≥50 EDs (27 subjects [77.1%] in the <6 years of age cohort and 34 
subjects [100%] in the 6 to <12 years of age cohort), while 8 subjects (11.6%) had <50 EDs. All 61 subjects 
with ≥50 EDs had a valid inhibitor test after 50 EDs; therefore, the protocol requirement for assessment of 
inhibitor risk was met. The median number of EDs for the overall safety analysis set was 54.0 (range: 5 to 
72)

Table 31 
Summary of Annualized Bleeding Rates by Prestudy Treatment 
Of the 69 subjects who participated in the Efficacy Period, 7 subjects were on prior episodic dosing, and 62 
subjects were on prior prophylaxis dosing. The median annualized bleeding rate during the study was 2.05 
for subjects on prior episodic dosing and 1.96 for subjects on prior prophylaxis dosing 
Summary of Annualized Bleeding Rates by Hemophilia Characteristics 
Because the number of bleeding episodes in the prior 12 months was dependent on the subjects’ previous 
treatment regimen, the change in annualized bleeding rates was evaluated separately for prior prophylaxis 
and episodic treatment. When compared with the number of bleeding episodes in the 12 months prior to 
study start based on subject-reported historical data, the observed annualized bleeding rates for subjects on 
a prior prophylaxis regimen showed a small decrease in annualized bleeding rates from prior frequency of 
bleeding (Table 32). Subjects on a prior episodic regimen also showed a decrease in their annualized bleeding 
rate when treated with a prophylaxis regimen on study (Table 32).

Overall Dosing 
The median total number of injections per subject was 54.0 for both the <6 years of age cohort (range: 5 to 
76) and the 6 to <12 years of age cohort (range: 52 to 64) . The median number of injections, per subject, 
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015 
Page 93/132 
  
  
 
 
 
for prophylaxis treatment was 52.0 (range: 4 to 66). A median of 0.0 injections (range: 0 to 8), per subject, 
was required to treat spontaneous bleeding episodes  
Prophylactic Dose and Dosing Interval 
The median of the average dosing interval during the Efficacy Period was 3.49 days (range: 2.8 to 3.7 days), 
with no difference in median average dosing interval between cohorts. 
The majority of subjects (62 subjects; 89.9%) made no changes to their prescribed dosing interval over the 
course of the study. The median number of prescribed interval adjustments was 0.0 (range: 0 to 1). 
The median average weekly dose of rFVIIIFc for subjects <6 years of age was 91.63 IU/kg (range: 69.9 to 
158.6 IU/kg) across the study and 101.86 IU/kg (range: 69.2 to 175.2 IU/kg) over the last 3 months of the 
study for those who were in the study for at least 24 weeks. For subjects in the 6 to <12 years of age cohort, 
the median average weekly dose was 86.88 IU/kg (range: 71.4 to 139.2 IU/kg) across the study and 88.97 
IU/kg (range: 67.0 to 151.0 IU/kg) over the last 3 months of the study for those who were in the study at 
least 24 weeks. 
Over half of subjects (53.6%) made no changes to their prescribed starting dose over the course of the 
study, and 30.4% only made 1 dose change during the study. The median number of prescribed dose 
changes per subject was 0.0 (range: 0 to 3).

Annualized rFVIIIFc Consumption 
The median annualized rFVIIIFc consumption during the Efficacy Period was 5146.3 IU/kg (range: 3695 to 
8474 IU/kg) for subjects <6 years of age and 4699.6 IU/kg (range: 3819 to 8230 IU/kg) for subjects 6 to 
<12 years of age. 
The median weekly dose and the annualized consumption are slightly higher and more variable in the <6 
years of age cohort 
Compliance 
A total of 86 bleeding episodes were reported during the Efficacy Period (38 episodes in the <6 years of age 
cohort and 48 episodes in the 6 to <12 years of age cohort). 
These bleeding episodes were experienced by 37 of the 69 subjects (53.6%) who received at least 1 dose of 
rFVIIIFc (17 subjects [48.5%] in the <6 years of age cohort and 20 subjects [58.8%] in the 6 to <12 years 
of age cohort) Overall, 67 of the 86 bleeding episodes (77.9%) were treated within 
8 hours of the onset of bleeding. Of subjects <6 years of age, 58.8% were compliant by treating at least 
80% of their bleeding episodes within 8 hours; this was true in 75.0% of subjects in the 6 to <12 years of 
age cohort  
Prophylactic Dosing 
Overall, the majority of subjects were compliant with prophylactic dosing. The median percentage of doses 
taken within 80% to 125% of the prescribed dose, per subject, was 90.38% (range: 35.8% to 100.0%) for 
subjects <6 years of age and 97.85% (range: 57.7% to 100.0%) for subjects 6 to <12 years of age. 
A total of 21 subjects (60.0%) in the <6 years of age cohort and 31 subjects (91.2%) in the 6 to <12 years 
of age cohort had a dosing compliance rate of at least 80% during the Efficacy Period. The lower level of dose 
compliance in the <6 years of age cohort may be mostly attributable to the impact of the Directions for 
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015 
Page 95/132 
  
  
 
 
 
Handling and Administration (DHA) instructions and the common medical practice of rounding up to the 
nearest vial size in lower weight subjects. 
The median percentage of doses taken within 1 day of the prescribed interval, per subject, was 98.11% for 
subjects <6 years of age and 97.87% for subjects 6 to <12 years of age. A total of 31 subjects (88.6%) in 
the <6 years of age cohort and 33 subjects (97.1%) in the 6 to <12 years of age cohort had a dosing interval 
compliance rate of at least 80% during the Efficacy Period Overall, 48 subjects (69.6%) were compliant with 
both the prescribed dose (80% to 125% of the prescribed dose for at least 80% of their doses) and the 
prescribed dosing interval (within 1 day of prescribed interval for at least 80% of their dosing intervals). In 
the <6 years of age cohort, this was true for 18 subjects (51.4%), and in the 6 to <12 years of age cohort, 
this was true for 30 subjects (88.2%) 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Subjects’ Assessments of Response to Treatment With rFVIIIFc Injections for 
Bleeding Episodes 
Key results for the subjects’ assessments of response to treatment with rFVIIIFc for a bleeding episode are as 
follows: 
- Overall, 89.4% of rFVIIIFc injections were rated by subjects as producing an excellent or good response. 
Of a total of 112 injections administered to treat the 86 bleeding episodes during the study, 104 were 
evaluated for response. Of the 104 injections, 93 injections (89.4%) were rated by subjects as producing an 
excellent or good response, 9 (8.7%) were rated as moderate, and 2 (1.9%) were rated as none (no 
improvement)

Time From Last Injection of rFVIIIFc to Treatment of a Bleeding Episode 
The median time from the last prophylaxis injection of rFVIIIFc to a spontaneous bleeding episode was 
similar when examined on a per subject basis (2.17, 2.55, and 2.27 for <6 years of age cohort, 6 to <12 
years of age cohort, and total, respectively) 
Number of Injections and Dose per Injection of rFVIIIFc Required to Resolve a 
Bleeding Episode 
Overall, 93.0% of bleeding episodes were controlled with ≤2 injections of rFVIIIFc, with 81.4% controlled by 
1 injection. Per bleeding episode, the median dose per injection required for resolution of bleeding was 49.69 
IU/kg, and the median total dose required was 54.90 IU/kg. 
Of the 86 bleeding episodes, analysis per bleeding episode showed that 1 injection of rFVIIIFc was adequate 
to resolve 76.3% of bleeding episodes in the <6 years of age cohort, 85.4% in the 6 to <12 years of age 
cohort, and 81.4% for the total. 
For resolution of each bleeding episode in the <6 years of age cohort, 6 to <12 years of age cohort, and 
total, the median dose per injection was 51.35, 48.15, and 49.69 IU/kg, respectively, and the median total 
dose was 56.40, 53.49, and 54.90 IU/kg, respectively. The number of bleeding episodes requiring a second 
injection was small (16 bleeding episodes overall for 11 subjects), with the median time per bleeding episode 
of 23.88 hours overall and 23.77 hours in the <6 years of age cohort and 24.02 hours in the 6 to <12 years 
of age cohort.

Physician’s Global Assessment of the Subject’s Response to rFVIIIFc Regimen 
During the visits in which data were collected, the Physician’s global assessment of the subjects’ response to 
their rFVIIIFc regimen was excellent for 92.8% of the visits, effective for 6.5% of the visits, and partially 
effective for 0.7% of the visits. There were no subjects whose response to the rFVIIIFc regimen was assessed 
as ineffective at any visits. 
Change in Physical Activity 
Overall, the majority of subjects reported similar or increased physical activity over the course of the study. 
Subjects in both age cohorts reported an increase in physical activity. Four subjects, 2 subjects in each age 
cohort, reported fewer/less physical activities at the end of the study. 
Minor Surgeries 
Although no specific objectives were specified for minor surgeries, information on the type of surgery and the 
hemostatic response was collected in the study. A total of 7 minor surgeries were performed in 7 subjects 
during the study: 2 surgeries in the <6 years of age cohort and 5 in the 6 to <12 years of age cohort 
Surgeons’ assessments of hemostasis were collected at least 24 hours following the procedure. Hemostasis 
was rated as excellent for 5 minor surgeries and as good for 2 minor surgeries. 
Patient-Reported Outcomes 
The CHO-KLAT assessment was completed by subjects ≥5 years of age only and by the subjects’ 
parent/proxy. The CHO-KLAT total score was also analyzed by the most recent prestudy regimen before 
entering the study. Subjects on a prophylaxis regimen before entry into the study remained stable when 
assessed by both the subject  and the parent/proxy. 
The Hemo-Sat Patient Satisfaction Scale questionnaire: Subjects maintained or slightly improved in these 
categories. The analysis was repeated for each prestudy regimen for which there were at least 10 subjects 
with a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline value. Subjects on a prestudy prophylaxis regimen also 
maintained or slightly improved EQ-5D-Y Questionnaire. The analyses were repeated for prestudy regimen 
when there were at least 10 subjects with a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline value. There was a small 
increase from baseline in the EQ-5D-Y visual analogue scale (median of 90.0 at baseline and 95.0 at End of 
Study)

(a) Percentages are based on the number of bleeding episodes. 
(b) n = total number of bleeding episodes with complete information on the dose(s) administered to treat a bleeding episode. 2 
Subjects had incomplete information on the dose(s) administered to treat a bleeding episode so the average dose per injection and 
the total dose for the resolution of those bleeding episodes could not be determined. 
(c) Percentages are based on the total number of bleeding episodes with a response to the first injection to treat the bleed. 
rFVIIIFc efficacy in routine prophylaxis was mainly evaluated through assessment of (annualised) 
bleeding rates and rFVIIIFc consumption, as depicted in the following two tables below:

Across the individualised/tailored prophylaxis arms of the Phase 3 study in adults and adolescents ≥12 years 
of age and both cohorts of the Phase 3 study in children <12 years of age, the median prophylactic dosing 
interval was approximately 3.5 days (IQR: 3.17, 4.43 for subjects ≥12 years and 3.46, 3.51 for subjects <12 
years). The median weekly prophylactic dose for tailored prophylaxis was 91.63, 86.88, and 77.90 IU/kg for 
subjects <6 years of age, subjects 6 to <12 years of age, and subjects ≥12 years of age, respectively. 
The final treatment regimen for the majority of subjects in Arm 1 (82/117 subjects) in Study 997HA301 was 
a regular dosing interval every 3 to 5 days. For these subjects, the median average single prophylactic 
Assessment report

(tailored) dose was 50.41 IU/kg every 3 days, 47.85 IU/kg every 4 days, and 50.61 IU/kg every 5 days; 
please see also Table 37. 
Table 37 
Of the 117 subjects in Study 997HA301, 35 subjects were on a treatment regimen (alternating dosing) with 
twice weekly dosing. 34 subjects were on 25 IU/kg on Day 1 and 50 IU/kg on Day 4, and 1 subject was on 
30 IU/kg on Day 1 and 60 IU/kg on Day 4. The median average tailored prophylactic dose per week was 
77.15 IU/kg, and the median average single dose was 38.83 IU/kg. 
In Study 8HA02PED, for 15 out of 69 subjects the final treatment regimen was a regular treatment 
regimen. Most of these (10/15 subjects) had a dosing interval of twice weekly; the remaining subjects had 
intervals of every 2 or 3 days. The median average single prophylactic (tailored) dose was 57.63 IU/kg every 
2 days, 56.57 IU/kg every 3 days, and 56.17 IU/kg twice weekly. 
The majority of subjects (54/69 subjects) in Study 8HA02PED –remained on a treatment regimen with 
alternating doses. The median average tailored prophylactic dose per week was 87.13 IU/kg and the median 
average single dose was 37.56 IU/kg 3 times weekly (1 subject only) and 43.52 IU/kg twice weekly. 
For efficacy evaluation during perioperative management, a total of 22 major surgeries were 
analysed, including 9 major surgeries in Study 997HA301 and 13 major surgeries in adults in Study 
8HA01EXT. No major surgeries were conducted in Study 8HA02PED.  
In all 22 evaluated major surgeries, haemostasis was assessed as excellent or good.  
Blood loss for the major surgeries ranged from 0 to 1200 mL during the surgery and from 0 to 1100 mL 
postoperatively (i.e., from the day following the day of surgery until discharge from the hospital).  
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015

In total, three subjects (who all underwent joint replacement and/or amputation procedures) required 
transfusions during the surgical period; one of them 1, the other two of them 2 units of red blood cells each.  
In Study 997HA301, in all 9 major surgeries, a single injection of rFVIIIFc (median dose 51.4 IU/kg) was 
administered to maintain haemostasis during surgery. Median rFVIIIFc consumption during the whole 
surgical/rehabilitation period was 763.99 IU/kg. In Study 8HA01EXT, one surgery required two injections of 
rFVIIIFc to maintain haemostatis during the procedure, all others required one (injection dose range: 45.3-
101.6 IU/kg). Total consumption ranged from 132.8-569.6 IU/kg.  
51 minor surgeries in 41 subjects have been performed while on rFVIIIFc treatment. Minor surgeries 
included dental procedures, wound closure, cystoscopy, port placement, port removal, and gastroscopy and 
colonoscopy. In all of the 32 minor surgeries with available assessment of haemostasis, haemostasis was 
assessed as excellent or good. Although no major surgeries were performed in subjects <12 years of age, a 
total of 7 of the 32 evaluable minor surgeries were performed in 7 subjects in Study 8HA02PED: 2 surgeries 
in the <6 age cohort and 5 in the 6 to <12 age cohort. 
Furthermore, post hoc pre-study and on-study comparisons were conducted by the Applicant for those 
subjects, who had already been on prophylaxis before study.  
In the Phase 3 study in adults and adolescents ≥12 years of age (997HA301) who were on prior prophylaxis 
(n = 85), the median annualised bleeding rate pre-study was 6.0 compared to a median annualised bleeding 
rate of 2.32 on-study. In the Phase 3 study in children <12 years of age (8HA02PED) on prior prophylaxis (n 
= 62), the overall median annualised bleeding rate pre-study was 2.0 compared to a median annualised 
bleeding rate of 1.96 on-study. 
Supportive studies 
Supportive efficacy data was provided from the currently ongoing extension study (8HA01EXT). Median dose 
per injection to treat a bleeding episode was in Study 997HA301 29.94 IU/kg in Arm 1 (tailored prophylaxis), 
21.65 IU/kg in Arm 2 (weekly dosing) and 26.46 IU/kg in Arm 3 (episodic dosing) compared to 46.88 IU/kg 
(tailored prophylaxis), 33.19 (weekly dosing) and 26.88 IU/kg (episodic) in the extension study 8HA01EXT. 
In Study 8HA02PED, the median dose per injection to treat a bleeding episode was 49.69 IU/kg compared to 
43.86 and 49.27 IU/kg in the <6 years and 6 to <12 years of age cohorts, respectively, in the extension 
study. 
Cumulative efficacy and safety data from the ongoing extension study (8HA01EXT). 
All subjects that received a weekly dose were evaluated to determine the cumulative weekly dosing 
experience across Study 997HA301 and the extension study (8HA01EXT); 2 subgroups were analyzed: 
•  Subjects who received weekly dose any time (ever) in Studies 997HA301 and/or 8HA01EXT 
•  Subjects who only received weekly dosing in Studies 997HA301 and 8HA01EXT. 
A total of 37 subjects received weekly dosing with rFVIIIFc at some point during Studies 997HA301 and/or 
8HA01EXT. This included the 23 subjects who received weekly dosing in Study 997HA301 and the 14 
subjects who switched from another regimen in Study 997HA301 to weekly dosing in the extension study. 
The ABR for subjects who were on weekly dosing at any time (ever) in Studies 997HA301 and/or 8HA01EXT

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The rFVIIIFc clinical development programme was designed to meet the requirements for pre-authorisation 
studies as set out in the guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived 
FVIII products (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009) such that comprehensive PK, efficacy, and safety data for 
rFVIIIFc were obtained to support approval. Data are provided from clinical studies 997HA301, 8HA02PED 
and 8HA01EXT in previously treated patients (PTPs) with haemophilia A.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Conduct of the clinical investigation of rFVIIIFc follows the EMA Guideline on the clinical investigation of factor 
VIII products (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009): A sufficient number of previously treated patients with 
severe haemophilia A out of the relevant age groups were followed for at least 50 EDs, with also a sufficient 
number of subjects ≥12 years who were followed for at least 6 months for assessment of rFVIIIFc efficacy in 
long-term prophylaxis. Likewise, the requested number of rFVIIIFc response assessments during (major) 
surgical procedures was satisfied.  
Endpoints chosen are regarded appropriate for efficacy assessment of rFVIIIFc treatment and also in line with 
the current FVIII Guidance. rFVIIIFc efficacy was investigated in treatment of bleeds, routine prophylaxis and 
perioperative management by assessment of treatment response rating, rFVIIIFc consumption and 
determination of (annualised) bleeding rates. Presentation of results of response rating was done for all kinds 
of bleeding episodes. Because of the limited number of subjects with severe hemophilia A, the sample size 
was based on clinical rather than statistical considerations, this is in accordance to the guideline.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
For evaluation of rFVIIIFc efficacy in routine prophylaxis, annualised bleeding rates were determined. 
Specifically for Study 997HA301, also statistical comparisons of bleeding rates between the three different 
treatment arms of the trial were made. Comparisons between study arm 1 and arm 2, however, may be 
biased due to systematic differences between the respective patient populations. For patients in treatment 
arm 2 and 3, by contrast, the same eligibility criteria applied and subjects were randomised between these 
two arms. Assessment of differences between arm 2 and 3 show a significant reduction of the annualised 
bleeding rate for weekly rFVIIIFc prophylaxis compared to on-demand treatment. 
When viewed separately for each of arm of Study 997HA301 as well as for Study 8HA02PED, for those 
subjects having received tailored prophylaxis regimen in these both studies, median annualised bleeding 
rates lie within an acceptable range.  
For those subjects in Study 997HA301 with weekly prophylaxis, however, the bleeding rate achieved during 
this regimen cannot be regarded as sufficient, considering that prophylactic treatment would usually aim at a 
marked reduction in breakthrough bleeding frequency. In this context, it should also be noted, that for this 
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015 
Page 107/132 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
weekly dosing regimen, no bleeding episodes were reported for only 17.4% of subjects during the 
observation period (compared to 45.3% and 46.4% for tailored prophylaxis in Study 997HA301 and Study 
8HA02PED, respectively, and 0% for on-demand treatment in Study 997HA301). New analyses of data from 
weekly prophylactic treatment with rFVIIIFc with cumulative ABRs show, that bleeding rates decreased 
during the extension study (8HA01EXT), where dosing changes were allowed (which was not allowed during 
the parent study 997HA301). From these cumulative ABRs it can be seen, that, after all, a highly selective 
patient population does exist, for whom weekly treatment with rFVIIIFc shows a sufficient level of efficacy at 
least over a limited period of time. However, only 37 of an overall of 233 subjects dosed with rFVIIIFc were 
ever - i.e. at any time during the clinical study programme - on weekly prophylaxis with the study product, 
and only 13 subjects remained on weekly prophylaxis during the whole period. This is not considered a 
relevant special population to be reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC, as set out in EC Guideline on Summary 
of Product Characteristics. Weekly dosing as starting regimen is considered an option for all factor VIII 
products in current guidance of e.g. WFH or DHG. It is not deemed specific to rFVIIIFc, since neither clinical 
nor (population) PK data indicate, that a dosing interval >5 days would be a property of the product. It 
should further be taken into account that prophylaxis with FVIII as a therapeutic option is especially 
pertaining to paediatric patients with severe haemophilia A. In paediatric patients <12 years of age, though, 
weekly prophylaxis was not utilised at all. Therefore, a statement in the SmPC regarding a weekly treatment 
regimen, as initially proposed by the applicant, could not be endorsed (See also discussion in Clinical 
pharmacology). 
For the tailored prophylaxis arms of both Phase 3 studies, median prophylactic dosing interval (3.5 days) and 
median weekly prophylactic dose (91.63, 86.88, and 77.90 IU/kg for subjects <6 years of age, subjects 6 to 
<12 years of age, and subjects ≥12 years of age, respectively) were presented by the MAA. Consumption 
data for overall and prophylactic rFVIIIFc consumption show, that for tailored prophylaxis, overall data and 
prophylactic data do not differ substantially, wherefore it can assumed, that for these treatment regimens, 
bleeding rates were mainly achieved by the regimen itself (and not to additional rFVIIIFc administration in 
the context of breakthrough bleeding). 
Prophylactic dosing recommendations in section 4.2 of the SmPC of 50 IU/kg every 3 to 5 days could be 
established by clinical data of patients ≥12 years of age.  
Patients <12 years of age, however, were mostly treated with alternating doses  
As an additional analysis, post hoc pre-study and on-study comparisons are presented by the MAA. 
Comparisons between bleeding rates, number of injections and consumption before and during study 
treatment were only conducted for those subjects, who had already been on prophylaxis before study, which 
is considered appropriate. Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that these comparisons were made to 
retrospective data and therefore have to be interpreted with caution. Considered, however, together with 
results of rFVIIIFc efficacy evaluation in prophylaxis, these analyses suggest that the prolonged dosing 
interval chosen during the clinical investigation of rFVIIIFc is paralleled by an increase of single doses, while 
overall consumption remains unchanged.  
Overall efficacy of rFVIIIFc in the treatment of bleeding episodes could be shown with more than 80% of the 
occurred bleeding episodes having been treated with one injection of rFVIIIFc and median doses within an 
acceptable range in both Phase 3 studies across all treatment arms and age groups. However, in treatment 
arm 2 of Study 997HA301 (weekly dosing regimen), efficacy ratings are not fully consistent with the 
generally low number of infusions needed for the treatment of bleeds. This may suggest that symptom relief 
didn’t manifest as unequivocally as expected by the subject and along with this, it is striking that median 
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015

dose per injection was lower in this study arm (21.65 IU/kg in Arm 2 vs 29.94 and 26.46 IU/kg in Arm 1 and 
Arm 3).  
Regarding on-demand treatment in low-grade haemorrhage and minor surgery, a prolonged injection 
frequency was not sufficiently supported by the clinical data nor are prolonged dosing intervals considered 
reasonable in the treatment of acute bleeds, therefore the time interval for a repeated injection in on-
demand treatment of low-grade haemorrhage was adjusted in accordance with the severity of the bleeding, a 
relevant guidance is given in the SmPC. The calculation of the required dose of recombinant factor VIII Fc is 
based on the empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma 
factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dL so that the required dose is determined as: Required units = body weight (kg) 
x desired factor VIII rise (%) (IU/dL) x 0.5 (IU/kg per IU/dL). The amount to be administered and the 
frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case (see 
SmPC section 4.2 and 5.2). The time to peak activity is not expected to be delayed.  
A sufficient number of major surgeries were evaluated for rFVIIFc efficacy in compliance with the EMA 
Guideline on clinical investigation of FVIII products. In paediatric patients, only minor surgeries were 
performed; however, evaluation of efficacy in major surgery in children is not explicitly requested by the 
current guidance. Assessments of haemostatic efficacy, blood loss, transfusion requirements and rFVIIIFc 
consumption show adequate results for rFVIIIFc efficacy during major surgical procedures. 
In line with EMA guidance, a clinical study (8HA01EXT) has been initiated to collect long-term efficacy and 
safety data in order to extend the initial observations from pre-authorisation studies. Study 8HA01EXT is 
included as a post-marketing study in the Risk Management Plan; interim data from this study are provided 
in this MAA. Also in line with EMA guidance, a clinical study (997HA306) will be conducted to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of rFVIIIFc in PUPs; as this study is planned for initiation in 2015 and data for PUPs are 
not required for initial marketing authorisation, data from this study are not included in this MAA.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of rFVIIIFc was adequately evaluated in the treatment of bleeds, routine prophylaxis and major 
surgeries showing positive results.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
-  Submission of the results from study 997HA306, An Open-Label, Multicentre Evaluation of the Safety and 
Efficacy of Recombinant Coagulation Factor VIII Fc Fusion Protein (rFVIIIFc; BIIB031) in the Prevention 
and Treatment of Bleeding in PUPs with Severe Haemophilia A (PUPs study). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety data is derived from all five rFVIIIFc studies (Studies 998HA101, 997HA301, 8HA02PED, 8HA01EXT, 
and 997HA307).  
The clinically relevant repeat-dose safety data in support of marketing authorisation are from the completed 
Phase 3 studies 997HA301 and 8HA02PED, and from the interim data (as of the cut-off of 06 January 2014) 
for the extension study 8HA01EXT. Data from these three studies were pooled for an integrated presentation.

Data from the Phase 1/2a study are discussed separately because of the relatively small number of subjects 
and study design differences, including single-dose exposure, different visit schedules, and shorter duration 
of observation.

Adverse events 
The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; AEs emerging during treatment 
with rFVIIIFc but excluding AEs emerging during the perioperative management period for a major surgery) 
with an incidence ≥5% were nasopharyngitis (18.9%), upper respiratory tract infection (12.4%), arthralgia 
(11.6%), headache (10.7%), cough (10.3%), fall (7.7%), diarrhoea (6.0 %), pyrexia (5.6%), and influenza 
and vomiting (5.2% each). 
Most subjects had TEAEs that were judged by the Investigator as unrelated to the rFVIIIFc treatment. After 
medical review, a total of 25 AEs were considered as related to study treatment and included as adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs): malaise, headache, arthralgia, and myalgia (2 subjects or 0.9% each), and bradycardia,

abdominal pain lower, chest pain, feeling cold, feeling hot, procedural hypotension, joint swelling, dizziness, 
dysgeusia, cough, rash, angiopathy (vascular pain after injection), hypertension, back pain, hot flush, and 
rash erythematous (1 subject or 0.4% each). 
In the Phase 1/2a study 998HA101, 44 TEAEs were reported by 11 subjects (68.8%), including 4 subjects 
(66.7%) in the 25 IU/kg dose group and 7 subjects (70%) in the 65 IU/kg dose group. Most AEs were 
reported by 1 subject; back pain, dysgeusia, and myalgia were reported in 2 subjects each; nasopharyngitis 
and headache were reported in 3 subjects each. Two subjects in the 65 IU/kg dose group experienced AEs 
considered by the Investigator to be at least possibly related to study treatment. One subject reported

2One adult subject had a positive anti-Factor VIII antibody test result coincident with a single measurement 
of a neutralising antibody titre of 0.73 Bethesda Units/mL at Week 14. The neutralising antibody was not 
confirmed upon repeat testing 18 days later and was negative at subsequent visits. There was an increase in 
clearance (CL) at Week 14 that resolved with continued rFVIIIFc treatment.

Serious adverse events and deaths 
Of the total of 233 subjects treated with rFVIIIFc, 39 subjects (16.7%) experienced a total of 55 serious 
TEAEs. All of the 55 serious TEAEs were assessed by the Investigator as unrelated to rFVIIIFc treatment 
(none were missing an assessment of relationship), and all resolved. 
Two serious TEAEs were associated with a fatal outcome, overdose (polysubstance overdose) and completed 
suicide in 1 subject with a history of depression, substance addiction, and substance overdose. The 
Investigator assessed the overdose and the completed suicide as unrelated to rFVIIIFc treatment. 
A review of AEs of special interest revealed 12 non-serious AEs of allergic reactions, thereof 10 assessed as 
not related to rFVIIIFc and 1 non-serious AEs of thrombotic events, all assessed as not related. 
Of the 22 subjects, who underwent 24 major surgeries, 8 experienced a total of 18 (S)AEs during the 
postoperative period, all assessed by the Investigator as unrelated to rFVIIIFc. 
Most frequently reported were AEs related to postoperative fever/pyrexia (3 subjects) and anaemia/Hb 
decreased (2 subjects). 1 SAE of a post-procedural haemorrhage, following a major surgery of knee revision 
arthroplasty, was reported  in 1 subject); it resolved 1 day after onset, and no action was taken with study 
treatment as a result of the event. 
No deaths and no SAEs occurred during Study 998HA101. 
Laboratory findings 
There were no patterns or trends observed in abnormalities in haematology or blood chemistry parameters. 
However, some discrepant information needs clarification, as outlined in the list of questions. 
Safety in special populations 
The clinical data from the completed studies 997HA301 and 8HA02PED and the ongoing extension study 
8HA01EXT as of the data cut off of 6 January 2014, includes two patients > 65 years of age (2/233, 0.86%). 
 Neither of the patients experienced a serious adverse event (SAE). In total, these patients experienced 12 
non serious adverse events (AEs) throughout the study.  None of these events led to study discontinuation. 
The AEs events reported included the following: Nervous systems disorders (1 event), cardiac disorders (1 
event), infections and infestations (3 events), Injury poisoning and procedural complications (2 events), 
gastrointestinal disorders (3 events), renal and urinary disorders (1 event), and general disorders and 
administration site conditions (1 event).  
Immunological events 
Inhibitor development 
One subject from Study 997HA301 had a low-titre positive neutralising anti-rFVIIIFc antibody test result at 
Week 14 during Study 997HA301, with negative results upon repeat testing of a separate sample taken 18 
days later upon subsequent testing at Week 28 and End of Study (Week 34) during Study 997HA301, as well 
as at Months 6, 12, and 18 during the extension study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015 
Page 114/132 
  
  
 
 
Positive test results for Anti-rFVIIIFc binding antibody (ADA), which is distinguished from neutralising 
antibody (inhibitor), were observed both prior to and following initiation of treatment with rFVIIIFc. 12 
subjects had ADA first detected prior to treatment with rFVIIIFc (5 subjects from Study 997HA301 and 7 
subjects from Study 8HA02PED). 6 subjects with negative results prior to rFVIIIFc treatment had positive 
results during the study (all from Study 997HA301). One of these subjects from Study 997HA301 had a 
positive rFVIIIFc neutralising antibody test result (0.73 BU/mL) at the time he had an ADA-positive result at 
Week 14 without associated AEs. 
Of those subjects, with ADA positive test results prior to initiation of treatment, 1 subject from Study 
8HA02PED had increased clearance of 5.42 mL/h/kg accompanied by slightly higher than normal IR of 3.44 
IU/dL per IU/kg by the one-stage assay.  
Infection 
There may be a theoretical concern that saturation of FcRn with rFVIIIFc might result in increased catabolism 
and reduced half-life of IgG (thereby increasing a subject’s risk of infection). However, the level of rFVIIIFc in 
the circulation after administration is minimal compared with the level of endogenous IgG. Nonetheless, a 
comprehensive data collection and evaluation of total serum IgG and IgG subclass levels was performed in 
the Phase 3 study in adults and adolescents ≥12 years of age (997HA301) revealing no clinically meaningful 
changes. 
Samples for testing of serum immunoglobulin were not collected in Study 8HA02PED or Study 8HA01EXT. 
Furthermore, a comprehensive medical review of event terms relevant to infection was performed for Studies 
997HA301, 8HA02PED, and 8HA01EXT. Of the total of 233 subjects treated with rFVIIIFc, 127 subjects 
(54.5%) experienced at least 1 TEAE in the infections and infestations SOC. The infection TEAEs reported by 
12 or more subjects (≥5%) were nasopharyngitis in 44 subjects (18.9%), upper respiratory tract infection in 
29 subjects (12.4%), and influenza in 12 subjects (5.2%). All of the TEAEs in the infections and infestations 
SOC were assessed by the Investigator as unrelated to rFVIIIFc treatment, including 8 serious TEAEs in the 
infections and infestations SOC, which were reported in 6 subjects (2.6%). The serious TEAEs in the 
infections and infestations SOC included Pericoronitis (wisdom tooth), Appendicitis, Influenza, 
Metapneumovirus infection, Viral Infection, Bacillus infection and Escherichia infection, Croup infectious. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Not applicable 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A total of 5 subjects discontinued or withdrew due to a TEAE: related arthralgia, related rash, unrelated 
femur fracture, unrelated overdose and completed suicide with an outcome of death; blood creatinine 
increased, assessed as related by the Investigator, after medical review as unlikely related to study 
treatment. Additionally, for one subject with multiple related AEs, who discontinued the study, it is unknown 
whether the events contributed to the subject’s decision to withdraw consent. 
Post marketing experience  
rFVIIIFc was approved in the US on 06 June 2014 and became commercially available on 14 July 2014. As of 
31 August 2014, 1 SAE of a high-titre factor VIII inhibitor in an 11-month-old minimally treated patient with 
severe haemophilia A was reported.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient exposure is in accordance with the requirements of the EMA FVIII Guideline for an application for 
marketing authorisation, with a sufficient number of patients out of the relevant age groups exposed over a 
sufficiently long period of time.  
Compared to the current EMA factor VIII core SmPC, considerably higher doses (up to 65 IU/kg in patients 
≥12 years and up to 80 IU/kg in patients <12 years) were proposed for prophylactic treatment. As FVIII core 
SmPC recommendations are based on longstanding clinical experience in haemophilia treatment, there is a 
limitation of the global factor VIII clinical safety database concerning long-term prophylactic treatment with 
such high doses. As already discussed under Pharmacokinetics, for these doses of 65 IU/kg, elevated factor 
VIII activity peak levels >150 IU/dl were observed during study 998HA101, which may constitute a risk 
factor for venous thromboembolism (Jenkins et al. 2012). 
Additional data on rFVIIIFc exposure stratified by dose as well as dose-related AE data support dose 
recommendations in the SmPC up to 65 IU/kg for patients ≥12 years of age at this stage. For patients <12 
years, although exposure to rFVIIIFc to doses ≥65 IU/kg was low, no specific restriction to doses <65 IU/kg 
are considered necessary either. However, the SmPC recommendation to treatment doses up to 80 IU/kg in 
the paediatric population below the age of 12 is not acceptable since not supported by clinical data.  
The clinical safety database of rFVIIIFc is limited with regard to elderly patients, who are at higher risk for 
thromboembolism. None of the study subjects investigated within the rFVIIIFc clinical development 
programme was older than 65 years of age and thus also no dose-related data exist. Although their 
investigation is not strictly recommended by the current factor VIII guidance, this population is of increasing 
importance, since age composition of the haemophilic population has changed over the last years with a 
growing proportion of elderly patients. Individual case reports of elderly haemophilia A subjects experiencing 
thrombotic events under FVIII treatment exist (Lickfett et al. 1998). With regard to this patient population, 
concerns remain. According to the applicant, routine pharmacovigilance activities to assess the safety of 
rFVIIIFc for patients in the age category >65 years will be implemented. The safety profile in patients >65 
years old is stated as missing information in the RMP. Possible dose-related implications in terms of an 
increased risk for TEE are however not addressed by post-marketing measures yet (See RMP). 
As the most important safety aspect of a factor VIII product, inhibitor development has to be taken into 
account. Procedures and definitions regarding inhibitor testing, as conducted in the context of the clinical 
development programme of rFVIIIFc, meet the standards set out in the current EMA FVIII guidance. 
Furthermore, it was tested for anti-rFVIIIFc binding antibodies (ADA), which is considered adequate for a 
novel recombinant factor VIII product. 
One subject from Study 997HA301 had a low-titre (0.73 BU/mL) positive inhibitory anti-rFVIIIFc antibody 
test result at Week 14 during Study 997HA301, with negative results upon multiple repeat testing from 18 
days up to 18 months later. Together with a transiently reduced rFVIIIFc activity and recovery coinciding with 
the Week 14 positive inhibitor test result, this is suggestive of a transient low-titre inhibitor in this subject. 
Additionally, during the post-marketing period in the US, one case of a high-titre inhibitor development (37 
BU/mL at first and 27 BU/mL upon repeat testing) in an 11-month-old minimally treated patient with severe 
haemophilia A was reported. Overall, these findings are not indicative of a higher than expected inhibitor 
incidence under treatment with rFVIIIFc.  
Assessment report  
EMA/671791/2015 
Page 116/132 
  
  
 
 
ADA could be detected in a total of 18 subjects prior or during the study. There was no relationship with 
adverse events or problems with FVIII plasma exposure, except in the above mentioned subject who had an 
increase in CL and only one coincidental positive unconfirmed inhibitor test. According to the applicant, there 
was a possible temporal association of increased bleeding tendency and an increase in CL and Vss with the 
positive ADA results and the transient positive neutralizing antibody test result in this Subject. This is 
considered a justification to include this issue in the SmPC. The physicians should be informed of the 
detection of others antibodies, particularly if these can have PK consequences. 
The theoretical concern, that a subject’s risk of infection might be increased because of saturation of the 
neonatal Fc receptor by rFVIIIFc, was addressed by the applicant. Neither evaluation of serum IgG levels nor 
review of the respective infection event terms showed any results out of the expected ranges.  
Previously untreated patients (PUPs) were not investigated yet. A respective statement, as required by the 
current EMA FVIII guidance, was included under section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Limitations of the clinical safety database for patients >65 years in view of the SmPC dose range  are of 
importance, since the proposed unusual high factor VIII doses might be associated with an increased risk for 
thromboembolic events especially in this patient population. This is addressed in the RMP as additional data 
are expected through routine pharmacovigilance and ongoing studies in the PhV plan. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The clinical safety data as presented by the applicant are not indicative of unexpected findings concerning the 
safety profile of rFVIIIFc and inhibitor incidence under rFVIIIFc treatment.  
No safety concern precluding an approval has been identified, additional safety information will be obtained 
as post-authorisation

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed post-authorisation 
PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.  
The PRAC also considered that the studies in the post-authorisation development plan and participation in the

Section 4.4 of SmPC:

Inhibitors 
The formation of neutralising 
antibodies (inhibitors) to factor 
VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with 
haemophilia A. These inhibitors 
are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII 
procoagulant activity, which are 
quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) 
per mL of plasma using the 
modified assay. The risk of 
developing inhibitors is correlated 
to the exposure to factor VIII, this 
risk being highest within the first 
20 exposure days. Rarely, 
inhibitors may develop after the 
first 100 exposure days. 
Cases of recurrent inhibitor (low 
titre) have been observed after 
switching from one factor VIII 
product to another in previously 
treated patients with more than 
100 exposure days who have a 
previous history of inhibitor 
development. Therefore, it is 
recommended to monitor all 
patients carefully for inhibitor

occurrence following any product 
switch. 
In general, all patients treated 
with coagulation factor VIII 
products should be carefully 
monitored for the development of 
inhibitors by appropriate clinical 
observations and laboratory tests. 
If the expected factor VIII activity 
plasma levels are not attained, or 
if bleeding is not controlled with 
an appropriate dose, testing for 
factor VIII inhibitor presence 
should be performed. 
In patients with high levels of 
inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may 
not be effective and other 
therapeutic options should be 
considered. Management of such 
patients should be directed by 
physicians with experience in the 
care of haemophilia and factor VIII 
inhibitors. 
Section 4.8 of SmPC: 
Patients with haemophilia A may 
develop neutralising antibodies 
(inhibitors) to factor VIII. If such 
inhibitors occur, the condition will 
manifest itself as an insufficient 
clinical response. 
In such cases, it is recommended 
that a specialised haemophilia 
centre be contacted.

Talk to your doctor if you 
think that your bleeding is not

receive, as there can be several 
reasons for this. For example, the 
formation of antibodies (also

is a known complication that can 
occur during the treatment of 
haemophilia A. The antibodies 
prevent the treatment from 
working properly. This would be 
checked by your doctor. Do not

Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Animal reproduction studies have 
not been conducted with ELOCTA. 
A placental transfer study in mice 
was conducted (see section 5.3). 
Based on the rare occurrence of 
haemophilia A in women, 
experience regarding the use of 
factor VIII during pregnancy and 
breast-feeding is not available. 
Therefore, factor VIII should be 
used during pregnancy and 
lactation only if clearly indicated.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
The Applicant’s proposal to implement a combined PL for all 7 strengths is in line with the “Guideline on 
Compilation of QRD decisions on stylistic matters in product information [EMA/25090/2002] Rev. 16, April 
2014” and considered to be acceptable. The applicant's proposal to implement a combined SmPC is in line 
with the criteria as defined in the "Policy on combined Summaries of Product Characteristics (SmPCs)." 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Elocta (EFMOROCTOCOG ALFA) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Efmoroctocog alfa -rFVIIIFc, a recombinant human coagulation factor VIII Fc fusion protein- is efficient as a 
replacement therapy of patients with haemophilia A, as measured by treatment response assessments, factor 
VIII consumption, and, in surgical procedures, also by determination of blood loss/transfusion requirements 
(in line with the EMA clinical factor VIII guideline). Furthermore, annualised bleeding rates during prophylaxis 
can be determined and an every 3-5 day posology for prophylaxis is recommended. PK data serve as an 
important surrogate endpoint.  
In the treatment of bleeds, response was assessed as “excellent” or “good” for more than 80% of first 
rFVIIIFc injections in the tailored prophylaxis treatment arms of both Phase 3 studies as well as the episodic 
treatment arm of the Phase 3 study in subjects ≥12 years of age. More than 80% of the occurred bleeds

were treated with one injection with a median dose of ~25-30 IU/kg in subjects ≥12 years and ~50 IU/kg in 
subjects <12 years of age. Median annualised bleeding rates during tailored prophylaxis are below 2 and 
overall rFVIIIFc consumption does not markedly exceed prophylactic rFVIIIFc consumption. Heamostasis 
achieved in 22 major surgeries was assessed as “excellent” or “good” in all of them. Three subjects required 
transfusions, all underwent joint replacement and/or amputation procedures. Median surgical rFVIIIFc 
consumption was 763.99 IU/kg in the Phase 3 study in subjects ≥12 years; in the extension study, 
consumption ranged from 132.8-569.6 IU/kg.  
In a Study in the of 69 evaluable previously treated male paediatric patients <12 years of age, the median 
dose interval of the individualised prophylaxis regimen was 3.49 (interquartile range 3.46-3.51) days and the 
median total weekly dose was 91.63 (interquartile range 84.72-104.56) IU/kg for subjects <6 years of age 
and 86.88 (interquartile range 79.12-103.08) IU/kg for subjects 6 to <12 years of age. The median overall 
annualised bleeding rate was 1.96 (interquartile range 0.00-3.96). No bleeding episodes were experienced in 
46.4% of paediatric subjects. Of the 86 bleeding events observed, 81.4% were controlled with 1 injection, 
and overall 93.0% of bleedings episodes were controlled with 2 or fewer injections. The median dose per 
injection to treat a bleeding episode was 49.69 (interquartile range 29.41-56.82) IU/kg. The median overall 
dose to treat a bleeding episode was 54.90 IU/Kg (29.41, 71.09). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
In addition to an every 3-5 day posology, Efmoroctocog alfa was also developed with the intention to explore 
a once weekly posology for prophylactic use. Although there is evidence from the PK evaluation for a 
prolonged half-life, posology may not solely be based thereon, and is PK evaluation not considered suitable to 
constitute a generalisable multiplication factor for rFVIIIFc dosing intervals. In on-demand treatment of 
bleeding episodes, broad prolongation of time intervals between repeated injections is not endorsed. In 
prophylactic treatment, dosing intervals >5 days are neither supported by PK nor by clinical data. Therefore 
such considerations could not be made and final SmPC recommendations are appropriately reflecting 
posology recommendations. 
No data are available for previously untreated patients, a trial investigating the safety and efficacy of 
efmoroctocog alfa in PUPs is however currently under way (997HA306). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The nature and frequency of the reported adverse events do not give rise to concern and do not reveal 
unexpected safety signals. Most of the ADRs reported (headache, back pain, dizziness, hypertension, 
bradycardia, hot flush, abdominal pain, rash, arthralgia, malaise, chest pain) occurred only once but as 
database consists of 233 patients, frequency was reported as uncommon.The size of the safety database 
available at the moment is in compliance with guideline requirements.  
Apart from that, the presented data are not indicative of unfavourable effects that go beyond what would be 
expected for a factor VIII product. One adult subject had a positive anti-Factor VIII antibody test result 
coincident with a single measurement of a neutralising antibody titre of 0.73 Bethesda Units/mL at Week 14. 
The neutralising antibody was not confirmed upon repeat testing 18 days later and was negative at 
subsequent visits. There was an increase in clearance (CL) at Week 14 that resolved with continued rFVIIIFc

treatment. Therefore, it can be considered that there was no higher than expected incidence of inhibitor 
development from the results of the clinical studies.  
As the product is approved in the US, from the post-marketing setting 1 SAE of a high-titre factor VIII 
inhibitor in an 11-month-old minimally treated patient with severe haemophilia A was reported. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The clinical safety database is limited with regard to elderly patients >65 years of age, who are at higher risk 
for thromboembolism and therefore considered a critical population especially when treated with higher doses 
>50 IU/kg. Due to the rareness of the disease the safety database is relatively small although in line with 
guideline requirements. Data on long-term safety will be obtained in the post-marketing phase as foreseen 
by the relevant guideline. 
In the PK evaluation, median rFVIIIFc peak levels of 182 IU/dl were observed for single doses of 65 IU/kg; 
however, it could not be ruled out that repeated long term administration of doses up to 65 mg/dl and for 
children even doses up to 80 mg/dl for rFVIIIFc long term prophylactic treatment with consecutive repeatedly 
elevated factor VIII peak levels would put patients at an increased risk for thromboembolic events. This is 
addressed in the RMP. 
A Clinical trial planned as extension study to one of the pivotal trials (8HA01EXT) and a clinical study in PUPs 
(997HA306), post marketing study and the data from a registry (EUHASS) are expected to bring more 
information on the safety in PUPs, occurrence of adverse events of special interest, i.e. development of 
inhibitors, thromboembolic events or hypersensitivity, anaphylactic or allergic reactions and are included in 
the pharmacovigilance plan. Final safety analyses from study 997HA307 will be submitted post authorisation 
and are expected to provide more information on safety aspects such as inhibitor development to FVIII and 
allergic reactions.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Available clinical efficacy data from efmoroctocog alfa, support that it is an efficacious new FVIII product for 
the prevention and treatment of bleeds in previously treated patients with haemophilia A. Beneficial effects 
arising from maintaining of haemostasis in haemophilia A are of obvious importance, since they results in an 
improvement of the quality of life and increased life-expectancy. This could adequately be shown for rFVIIIFc.  
The number of included patients across all clinical trials is in accordance with guideline requirements and the 
safety database is considered sufficient to evaluate the tolerability of efmoroctocog alfa before marketing 
authorisation. The observed adverse event profile is considered similar to that of other licensed FVIII 
products. Inhibitor development has to be regarded as the most important unfavourable effect of factor VIII 
products in general. Importantly, apart from a case of a transient low titre inhibitor, no patients developed 
FVIII inhibitors and no thromboembolic events occurred in the clinical trials; however one case of inhibitor 
development was reported from postmarketing data.. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall, efficacy has been established by the provided clinical data as per the requirements of relevant 
Guidelines. Safety-profile of Elocta is in line with what is expected. The benefits of rFVIIIFc outweigh the 
risks. 
The benefit-risk balance in the indication of the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in paediatric and adult 
patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) is considered to be positive.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
In view of the proposed high treatment doses, doses up to 80 IU/kg in patients <12 years should not be 
recommended in the SmPC either. The possible risk for TEE in elderly patients under high treatment doses 
>50 IU/kg should be addressed in the context of post marketing measures (see RMP). 
Overall, efficacy of efmoroctocog alfa in adult and paediatric patients with haemophilia A covering treatment 
of bleeding episodes, prophylaxis of bleeds and prophylaxis in surgical procedures is adequately supported by 
submitted clinical data according to the currently valid Clinical Guideline. Furthermore, the documented 
safety profile is within the expected range for factor VIII products. Studies detailed in the pharmacovigilance 
plan are expected to update the knowledge on issues of special interest in this class (development of 
inhibitors, hypersensitivity, anaphylactic or allergic reactions, safety in previously untreated patients).

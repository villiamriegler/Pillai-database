1.  Background information on the procedure 
On 19 December 2011 the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) for aliskiren containing medicinal 
products, Novartis Europharm Limited informed the European Medicines Agency of its intention to 
terminate the ALTITUDE study in patients with type II diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular and renal 
events following recommendation by the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).  
The DMC, further to the outcome (of the seventh safety and second efficacy interim review) of the data 
from the ALTITUDE study, on 14 December 2011 recommended the study termination concluding that 
in the study arm of patients receiving aliskiren when added on to conventional treatments for 
hypertension (either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker 
(ARB)), patients were unlikely to benefit from treatment. In addition, an increased incidence of non-
fatal stroke, renal complications, hyperkalaemia and hypotension in this high-risk study population was 
observed. 
In light of the emerging safety data, there was a need to review all safety data on aliskiren and its 
impact on the benefit/risk for the approved indication. 
Therefore, on 20 December 2011, the European Commission (EC) initiated a procedure under Article 
20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for aliskiren-containing products and, referred the matter to the 
CHMP. The EC requested the CHMP to assess all the available data and its impact on the risk-benefit 
balance for aliskiren-containing medicinal products and to give its opinion on measures necessary to 
ensure the safe and effective use of these medicinal products and whether the marketing 
authorisations should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
The CHMP firstly considered the safety issue at its extraordinary meeting on 20 to 22 December 2011. 
Oral explanations were provided by the MAH on 20 December 2011.  
A Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) and a List of Question to the MAH was 
adopted by the CHMP on 22 December. An ad hoc expert meeting on Cardiovasculars was convened on 
13 January 2012 where the MAH gave an Oral Explanation. 
The matter was further considered by the CHMP at its meeting in January 2012. Oral explanations 
were provided by the MAH 16 January 2012. The CHMP adopted a list of outstanding issues on 19 
January 2012. 
After  reviewing  all  the  available  data  submitted  by  the  MAH  to  address  the  concerns  discussed,  the 
CHMP adopted an opinion on 16 February 2012.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Aliskiren is a selective direct inhibitor of human rennin that inhibits the renin-angiotensin system 
(RAAS) blocking the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of 
angiotensin I and angiotensin II.  Whereas other agents that inhibit the RAAS (ACEi and angiotensin II 
receptor blockers (ARB)) cause a compensatory rise in plasma rennin activity (PRA), treatment with 
aliskiren has shown to decrease PRA in hypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%.  
Aliskiren is approved for the treatment of hypertension in medicinal products containing aliskiren only 
and in fixed-dose combination medicinal products containing aliskiren in combination with amlodipine, 
with hydrochlorothiazide, and with amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide.  
The ALTITUDE study (SPP100E2337) was designed to test the hypothesis that the addition of aliskiren 
to the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy would result in improved cardiovascular 
and renal outcomes. The study rationale was based on the results of the AVOID study, a phase 2 study 
which demonstrated an approximately 20 % decrease in urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) in 
type 2 diabetic patients treated with aliskiren, as compared to placebo. These results suggested a 
potential beneficial effect of aliskiren on lowering UACR independent of blood pressure (BP) effects. 
UACR has been extensively supported as a potential surrogate marker for cardiovascular risk in the 
diabetic population. 
Further to the outcome of the seventh safety and second efficacy interim review of the data from the 
ALTITUDE study, the DMC on the 14 December 2011 recommended the study termination concluding 
that in the study arm of patients receiving aliskiren when added on to conventional treatments for 
hypertension (either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker 
(ARB)), patients were unlikely to benefit from treatment. In addition, an increased incidence of non-
fatal stroke, renal complications, hyperkalaemia and hypotension in this high-risk study population was 
observed. 
The CHMP reviewed all data available from the ALTITUDE study, other clinical studies and post 
marketing data which are hereafter being discussed. 
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Clinical studies  
ALTITUDE study 
i. Study design 
The ALTITUDE study is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised study designed to investigate 
the effect of aliskiren on top of optimal cardiovascular treatment including an angiotensin converting 
enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in a specific population of patients with 
type 2 diabetes and renal impairment with at least one of the following inclusion criteria at 
randomisation: 
- macro-albuminuria (UACR ≥ 200 mg/g) and eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73m2 
- micro-albuminuria (UACR ≥ 20 mg/g and < 200 mg/g) and a mean estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73m2 and <60 mL/min/1.73m2 or 
Assessment report for Rasilez 
EMA/139311/2012  
Page 3 
 
 
 
 
 
- Cardiovascular disease (CVD) history and a mean eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73m2 and 
<60 mL/min/1.73m2 were included.  
The primary objective of this study was to determine whether aliskiren, compared to placebo, will 
delay the occurrence of cardiovascular and/or renal complications when added to conventional 
treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular and renal events. 
Occurrence was defined as the time to first event of the following composite primary endpoint: 
Cardiovascular (CV) death, Resuscitated sudden death, Non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), Non-fatal 
stroke, Unplanned hospitalization for heart failure, Onset of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or renal 
death, Doubling of baseline serum creatinine concentration, sustained for at least one month, Onset of 
ESRD is defined as initiation of dialysis, and renal transplantation, or a serum creatinine concentration 
above 6.0 mg/dL (530 µmol/L). 
In total 8606 type 2 diabetic patients were recruited and the patient stratification is reported below in 
Table 1 below.

Amongst the total population 55.4% had no previous CV history and 44.5% did have some previous CV 
disease history.  
Of the 55.4% with no CV disease history 26.5% (15% of the total population) had micro albuminuria 
and 73.4% macro albuminuria (40% of total population).  
Of the 44.5% with CV disease history 34% had no albuminuria (15% of total population), 26% had 
micro albuminuria (11% of total population) and 39% macro albuminuria (17% of total) 
Therefore by adding up these numbers for the patients groups with and without CV disease there were 
overall 15% of patients without albuminuria, 27% with micro albuminuria and 58% with macro 
albuminuria. 
a. Analysis of the interim data of ALTITUDE study  
In December 2011 the 7th ALTITUDE Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) met to review the second 
interim efficacy analysis and the accumulated data related to adverse events, laboratory values and 
physical status.  
Assessment report for Rasilez 
EMA/139311/2012  
Page 4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 1123 adjudicated primary outcome events, constituting 69% of the projected total primary 
outcome events, were tabulated.  There were 581 (13.6%) patients treated with aliskiren vs. 542 
(12.6%) patients treated with placebo who experienced a primary composite endpoint event.  
The hazard ratio (aliskiren vs. placebo) for the secondary renal outcome is 0.93 (CI: 0.76, 1.15) 
suggesting some potential for minimal renal benefit.  There is an increase in indices of renal 
impairment in aliskiren treated patients as evidenced by increased rates of ESRD or renal death (72 in 
aliskiren vs. 60 in placebo) and SAEs of renal concern (i.e. renal impairment, renal failure acute, renal 
failure chronic, renal failure with 201 or 4.7% in aliskiren vs. 142 or 3.3% in placebo; p=0.002).  
There is also an approximately 50% increase in the incidence of SAEs of renal concern within each 
level of severity in the aliskiren-treated group as compared to placebo. 
Based on these results, the study was unlikely to demonstrate a benefit from aliskiren treatment added 
to standard therapy.  The results also suggested a higher incidence of the adverse events of non-fatal 
stroke, renal complications, hyperkalaemia and hypotension of in this high-risk study population in the 
aliskiren arm. Given these concerns, the DMC unanimously recommended that all subjects in the 
ALTITUDE study should cease treatment with aliskiren. 
ii. Baseline patient characteristics and concomitant medications  
A total of 8,606 patients were randomised in this study at time of termination of the trial. The median 
age was 65 years, males (68%) and the majority of patients had known diabetes duration of at least 5 
years (82%). A history of CV disease was present in 47.9%. The baseline characteristics were: blood 
pressure 134.7/74.3 mmHg, HbA1c 7.5%, LDL-cholesterol 2.4 mmol/L, haemoglobin 130 g/L, serum 
creatinine 115 µmmol/L, eGFR 51.7 mL/min/1.73m2, UACR 198.9 mg/g and frequency of micro-
macroalbuminuria 25.7% and 58.2%. 
At the time of randomisation and according to protocol, all patients were treated with either an ACE 
inhibitor or an ARB.  At the time of randomisation, 56.6% of subjects were treated with insulin.  
Biguanides and sulfonylureas were used by 46.2% and 31.9% of subjects respectively (Table 2).  
ACEis was used by 44.2% of subjects and 55.9% used ARBs.  63.2% of subjects used loop/thiazide 
diuretics at baseline.

(1) All estimates are based on Cox regression models stratified by CV disease history and UACR (≥200mg/g) with treatment assignment as 
a covariate. Hazard ratio (HR) is exponential of parameter estimate. Z-value is the Wald test statistic, calculated as parameter estimate 
divided by standard error. The upper boundary is 2.4547 and the nominal α-level is 0.0140. Information is defined the total number of 
patients with primary events in the interim analysis divided by 1620. 
(2) Event date is the first doubling date (event confirmed at least one month after the first doubling date). 
(3) Each component event and all death are analyzed independently. The first of each type of event for each subject is counted regardless 
of whether it was the first event for that subject.  
(4) Deaths submitted for adjudication are included. 
A total of 1123 patients experience a primary composite endpoint as previously defined and the hazard 
ratio (aliskiren/placebo) for the primary composite endpoint was 1.09 (95% CI 0.97-1.22). 
The Kaplan-Meier curves for the aliskiren-treated (A) and the placebo-treated (B) subjects for the 
primary composite endpoint do not separate before approximately 15-18 months. 
iii. Cardiovascular (CV) composite endpoint 
The table below includes a summary of the primary and secondary efficacy analyses from the DMC

(2) Event date is the first doubling date (event confirmed at least one month after the first doubling date). 
(3) Each component event and all death are analyzed independently. 
(4) Events submitted for adjudication are included.  
A total of 840 patients experienced a secondary composite cardiovascular endpoint. The CV composite 
endpoint is defined as the first occurrence of CV death, resuscitated sudden death, non-fatal MI, non-
fatal stroke, or unplanned hospitalization for heart failure (HF). 
The hazard ratio (aliskiren/placebo) for the secondary CV composite endpoint was 1.14 (95% CI 0.99-
1.30). 
Kaplan-Meier curves for aliskiren and placebo treatment groups started to diverge for the secondary 
CV composite after approximately 1.5 years  
iv. Renal composite endpoint 
The previous table includes a summary of the primary and secondary efficacy analyses from the 
interim analysis with the renal endpoints in addition to the CV endpoint already described. For the 
onset of ESRD/renal death 72 (1.7%) of patients in the aliskiren group experienced an adjudicated 
endpoint vs. 60 (1.4%) in the placebo group with a hazard ratio 1.22 (95% CI 0.87-1.72). For the 
doubling of serum creatinine there was a slight benefit in favour of aliskiren with 141 patients on 
aliskiren reaching the endpoint (3.3%) vs. 159 (3.7%) with placebo, hazard ratio 0.90 (95% CI 0.71-
1.12). 
A late separation of the two Kaplan-Meier curves was observed between 20-24 months for the renal 
composite endpoint in favour of aliskiren.

Change in UACR and eGFR 
The UACR continuously goes up over the course of the study in the placebo group as opposed to 
dropping and remaining stable in the aliskiren group.The effect of aliskiren on top of ACE inhibitor or 
ARB treatment in the ALTITUDE trial shows a 20% difference as compared to placebo..

Treatment A = aliskiren; treatment B = placebo 
The figure above shows the changes in eGFR during the course of the study for the two treatment 
groups. As expected there was a greater initial drop in eGFR with aliskiren corresponding to an acute 
hemodynamic effect at the glomerular level.  No long-term benefit was demonstrated because eGFR 
continued to decline in both the placebo and aliskiren treatment groups over time. 
v. Change in Blood Pressure (BP) 
The figure 2 below shows the change in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP) during the 
course of the study. After an initial drop, blood pressure steadily increased by 2-3 mmHg in both 
treatment groups although the mean BP was approximately 1-1.5 mmHg lower for the aliskiren 
treatment group over the time course of the study.

As indicated in the table above, a total of 343 patients experienced a serious renal failure event 
defined as serious adverse events (SAEs) with preferred terms as indicated in the table. These events 
have not been adjudicated.  
Cox regression analyses were performed for this endpoint. There was a statistically significant 
difference between treatment groups. Treatment effect adjusted for all specified covariates in a 
multivariate Cox regression model was: HR (aliskiren vs. placebo) =1.44 (95% CI 1.15-1.81; 
p=0.0018).

Adverse events of concern - namely hypotension, stroke, hyperkalaemia and renal failure are 
presented in the table below. Overall there was an increase in adverse events in the aliskiren group for 
all categories. When looking at the stroke incidence there were more strokes of an ischemic nature 
whereas the strokes of hemorrhagic nature were less frequent. Furthermore, there was an increase in 
the ischemic stokes in the aliskiren group as compared to placebo (table 6).

c. Additional subgroup analyses of ALTITUDE study 
Comparison of patients with or without CV events 
Patient Characteristics  
Out of the total of 4283 patients in the aliskiren treatment group, 444 patients (10.4 %) suffered a 
cardiovascular (CV) event. Of the 4296 patients in the placebo arm, 396 (9.2%) patients experienced a 
CV event. 
Patients who suffered a CV event over the course of the study tended to be older with a mean age of 
67.1 (SD 9.1) as compared to the group of patients who did not have a CV event with a mean age of 
64.3 (SD 9.6) in the aliskiren arm. The incidence of CV events is higher in patients ≥ 65, and ≥ 75 
years old. A similar finding is observed in the placebo arm. 
The incidence of CV events observed is higher in males as compared to females both in the aliskiren 
and in the placebo arm. 
No major imbalances are observed with regard to baseline demographic characteristics between 
patients with CV events vs. patients without CV events in the aliskiren arm. 
With regards to medical history, the sub-group of patients that experienced a CV event during the 
course of the trial included more patients with a history of CV event prior to entry in the study (e.g 
history of heart failure (HF) and prior hospitalization, stenosis ≥ 50 % in a major epicardial coronary 
artery, prior unstable angina, and stable angina, prior Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG), prior 
hospitalization for MI, stroke, transitory ischemic attack, etc.) as compared to those patients that did 
not suffer a CV event in the aliskiren arm. This trend is also observed in the placebo arm, confirming 
the existence of a higher CV risk in patients who have a history of CV events irrespective of the 
treatment assignment. 
With regard to diabetes history, those patients that suffered a CV event compared to patients without 
CV events, tended to have a longer history of the disease (> than 5 years) 86.5 % vs. 81.8 % in the 
aliskiren treated group as well a higher family history of premature atherosclerotic events 20 % vs. 15 
%. 
The difference observed in the placebo group is slightly less marked with regard to the length of the 
disease (history of diabetes >5 years) 83.3 % vs. 82.3%, as well as the history of premature 
atherosclerotic events 16.4 % vs. 15 %. 
No major differences are observed with regard to the previous renal history at baseline in both the 
aliskiren and placebo arms. 
Medication at baseline

Overall, the use of relevant antihypertensive and anti-diabetic drugs at baseline are equally distributed 
between aliskiren and placebo treated patients. The proportion of patient treated with ACEIs and ARBs 
is 45 % and 55 % in the aliskiren arm and 43.4% and 56.8 % in the placebo arm respectively. Patients 
on aliskiren had a lower use of statins compared to placebo (63.7 % vs. 66.3%). With regards to the 
use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, there is a greater use of ACEIs in patients who had a CV end point in 
both groups (aliskiren and placebo) 51.9 % and 50.3 % respectively compared to those who did not 
have a CV event 44.2% and 42.8%. 
With regards to the use of anti-diabetic drugs in patients with CV events, there is a higher frequency in 
the use of insulin as compared to those patients that did not have an event, 65.3 % vs. 53.0 % in 
aliskiren treated patients. This is also observed in the placebo treated patients 57.8 % vs. 53.4 %.  
A similar distribution is observed in the group of patients that had a stroke in the aliskiren and in the 
placebo groups. 
Changes in Blood Pressure  
Overall, the systolic BP (SBP) in patients who had a CV event tended to be stable over time. The mean 
SBP (mSBP) was comparable between the aliskiren and placebo arms.  In the aliskiren arm, the mean 
SBP at baseline is 140.1 mmHg vs. 140.7 mmHg at the last visit (change +0.59). In the population 
treated with aliskiren who did not experience a CV event, the SBP tended to be lower at baseline with 
mean 136.9 mmHg vs. 140 .5 mmHg at the last visit (change +3.58  mmHg). No major fluctuations 
are observed over time during the course of the study. 
A similar trend is observed in the placebo group for msSBP in patients that suffered a CV event. In this 
group the mSBP at baseline is 138.6 mmHg vs. 139.7 mmHg (change +1.10 mmHg). In the population 
without events, the baseline mSBP is 137.2 mmHg vs. 141.6 mmHg (change +4.40 mmHg). 
No major imbalances in demographic characteristics that may identify patients at increased risk for 
renal events within the ALTITUDE study cohort have been identified. The incidence of cardiovascular 
events was greater in men compared to women but this difference is explained by the mean age of 
patients included in the study as cardiovascular events are greater in men than in women until the age 
of 70-75 years.   
The use of background therapy was similar in patients receiving aliskiren or placebo.   
Changes in UACR and eGFR 
With regard to the renal function, eGFR declined over time in both arms but it was more pronounced in 
the aliskiren treated population. With regards to the UACR, the aliskiren treated patients had a 
reduction of the UACR over time of about 20 % as compared to the placebo group.  
Review of Stroke (fatal and non-fatal) 
A total of 200 patients experienced an adjudicated stroke (fatal or non-fatal). The hazard ratio 
(aliskiren/placebo) for all strokes was 1.34 (95% CI 1.02-1.78). The inclusion of fatal strokes in the 
analysis increased the number of events by 3, compared to the non-fatal event analysis. 
The treatment effect adjusted for 25 covariates in a multivariate Cox regression model is similar to the 
unadjusted treatment effect: HR (aliskiren vs. placebo) =1.35 (95% CI 1.01-1.82; p=0.0461). Kaplan-
Meier curves for treatment groups aliskiren (A) and placebo (B) started to diverge after approximately 
1.5 years.  
A statistically significant treatment by covariate interaction (p-value < 5% in univariate Cox-
regression) has been identified, for baseline Calcium Channel Blocker use (p=0.0489). The hazard ratio 
for treatment A (aliskiren) vs treatment B (placebo) was 1.60 (95% CI 1.15-2.24) for patients who 
Assessment report for Rasilez 
EMA/139311/2012  
Page 12 
 
 
 
 
received Calcium Channel Blocker at baseline, while it was 0.85 (95% CI 0.50-1.45) when patients did 
not receive Calcium Channel Blocker at baseline. 
The other factor suggesting covariate by treatment interaction (p-value < 10% in univariate Cox-
regression) was prior hospitalization for stroke (relatively smaller hazard ratio aliskiren/placebo for 
patients with prior hospitalization for stroke; p=0.0957). 
Hypertension 
A slightly higher incidence of history of hypertension was observed in the aliskiren treated patients who 
had a stroke (97%), as compared to the placebo group with stroke (95%), which was not observed in 
the patients who did not have a stroke. No relevant differences were observed in the time since 
hypertension diagnosis. 
Hypotension and hypotension related events 
An increased incidence of hypotensive effects (collapse, hypotension, loss of consciousness, orthostatic 
hypotension, shock, syncope) was observed in the aliskiren treatment group for both patients with and 
without stroke (18.4% and 19.3%, respectively) versus the placebo group (14.6% and 14.0% 
respectively).

Orthostatic hypotension was not observed in the patients on aliskiren who had a stroke (as compared 
to 1 patient in the placebo group with stroke), however, it occurred more often in the aliskiren 
treatment group who did not have a stroke compared to placebo (1.2% versus 1.0%, respectively). 
Hypotension occurred much more frequently in the aliskiren group for both patients with and without 
stroke (11.5% and 11.4% respectively), as compared to placebo (7.5% and 4.7% respectively). 
Prior hospitalisation for MI, stroke, or a prior Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) 
In the overall study population there is a slight numerical imbalance in favour of the aliskiren group in 
the following categories of medical history at baseline prior stroke 439 (10.2 %) vs. 410 (9.5 %), prior 
transient ischemic attack (TIA) 179 (4.2%) vs. 173 (4%), known carotid artery stenosis 282 (6.6%) 
vs. 275 (6.4 %) and prior carotid revascularization (protective factor) 78 (1.8 %) vs. 99 (2.3%). 
An increased incidence of prior atrial fibrillation (AF) was observed in the aliskiren treatment group 
with stroke (7.9%) versus the placebo group with stroke (7.0%), however, for both groups this was 
lower than in the patients who did not have a stroke (8.9% and 8.2%, respectively). 
Assessment report for Rasilez

An increased incidence of prior PCI was observed in the aliskiren treatment group with stroke (18%) 
versus the placebo group with stroke (9%). This was also higher than in the patients who did not have 
a stroke in the aliskiren arm but was lower in the placebo arm (14% and 15%, respectively). 
An increased incidence of prior CABG was observed in the aliskiren treatment group with stroke (13%) 
versus the placebo group with stroke (11%). This was also higher than in the patients who did not 
have a stroke in the aliskiren arm but was lower in the placebo arm (12% in both treatment groups). 
An increased incidence of prior hospitalisation for MI was observed in the aliskiren treatment group 
with stroke (22%) versus the placebo group with stroke (13%). This was also higher than in the 
patients who did not have a stroke in the aliskiren arm but was lower in the placebo arm (16% and 
17%, respectively). 
A lower incidence of prior hospitalisation for stroke was observed in the aliskiren treatment group with 
stroke (18%) versus the placebo group (27%). The incidence of prior hospitalization for stroke was 
higher in patients that have a stroke than in patient that did not have a stroke (10% and 9%, 
respectively). 
A lower incidence of prior transient ischemic attack (TIA) was observed in the aliskiren treatment 
group with stroke (8%) versus the placebo group (9%). This incidence of prior TIA was higher in 
patients which experience a stroke than in the patients who did not have a stroke (4% in both 
treatment groups). 
Peripheral vascular disease as evidence for atherosclerosis 
A higher incidence of intermittent claudication was observed in the aliskiren treatment group with 
stroke (11%) versus the placebo group with stroke (8%). The incidence in the placebo group with 
stroke was similar to the incidence in the patients who did not have a stroke and the incidence in the 
aliskiren group with stroke was higher than in the patients who did not have a stroke (8% in both 
treatment groups). 
A higher incidence of lower limb stenosis as documented by imaging was observed in the aliskiren 
treatment group with stroke (6%) versus the placebo group (5%). The incidence in the placebo group 
with stroke was similar as in the patients who did not have a stroke and the incidence in the aliskiren 
group with stroke was higher than in the patients who did not have a stroke (5% in both treatment 
groups). 
A higher incidence of prior or current foot ulcers was observed in the aliskiren treatment group with 
stroke (11%) versus the placebo group (9%). This incidence of prior or current foot ulcers was higher 
in patients which experience a stroke than in the patients who did not have a stroke (9% and 8%, 
respectively).

Patients who had a stroke (either on aliskiren or placebo treatment) more often had a history of renal 
disease as compared to patients without stroke (84% and 83% for aliskiren versus 77% and 78 for 
placebo). 
Diabetes 
A higher incidence of type 2 diabetes was diagnosed >5 years in the aliskiren treatment group with 
stroke (87%) versus the placebo group (84%). This was both higher than in the patients who did not 
have a stroke (82% in both treatment groups).

No differences were observed for congestive heart failure, prior hospitalization for chronic heart failure 
(CHF), stenosis > 50% in at least one major epicardial coronary artery, stable angina pectoris, prior 
unstable angina pectoris, current Canadian cardiovascular Society (CCS) class, known carotid artery 
stenosis, prior carotid artery revascularization, known renal artery stenosis, prior lower limb 
revascularisation, clinically significant valvular heart disease, prior atrial fibrillation, cardioverter 
defibrillator or pacemaker implanted, second or third degree heart block, life-threatening or 
uncontrolled arrhythmia, or family history of premature atherosclerotic events in both arms.  
Baseline concomitant medications and use of concomitant medications during the study 
Cardiovascular medications 
ACE inhibitors, ARBs, antiplatelets, and beta-blockers (BBs) were equally used within each treatment 
group for both patients who had a stroke and did not have a stroke. 
A larger number of patients on aliskiren with a stroke were also using a calcium channel blockers 
(CCB) (78%), as compared to patients on aliskiren without stroke (61%), patients on placebo with 
stroke (65%), and patients on placebo without stroke (61%). Data are not available on any medication 
changes on-therapy. 
After visit 11 (12 months) for both treatment arms there was increased use of anti-platelets in patients 
with stroke as compared to patients who did not have a stroke.  
Anti-diabetic medications 
Sulfonylureas were equally used within each treatment group for patients who had a stroke and those 
who did not have a stroke. However, fewer patients with a stroke (either on aliskiren or on placebo) 
used insulin (54% aliskiren with stroke, 54% placebo with stroke) as compared to patients without a 
stroke (65% aliskiren without stroke, 61% placebo without stroke). 
Observed changes from baseline 
Baseline mean sitting systolic blood pressure and changes from baseline 
Baseline msSBP in patients in the stroke group on aliskiren was 142.6 mmHg, which is higher than in 
the stroke group on placebo (137.8 mmHg). Both were higher than in patients who did not have a 
stroke (aliskiren 137.1 mmHg and placebo 137.3 mmHg, respectively). 
In patients with stroke on aliskiren, msSBP increased during a time period of 12 months to the 
maximum msSBP of 149.8 mmHg, which is an increase of 6.86 mmHg over baseline (142.94  mmHg), 
after which msSBP dropped again. However, in patients with stroke on placebo, msSBP increased 
during a time period of 3 months to the maximum msSBP of 145.3 mmHg, which is an increase of 8.66 
mmHg over baseline (136.64  mmHg). Therefore, patients with stroke on aliskiren started with a 
higher msSBP, had an increase in msSBP over a longer period of time, and had a remaining increased 
msSBP after 24 months when compared to the patients on placebo. 
In patients without stroke on aliskiren, msSBP gradually increased over a time period of 21 months to 
the maximum msSBP of 140.6 mmHg, which is an increase of 3.57 mmHg over baseline. In patients 
without stroke on placebo, msSBP gradually increased over a time period of 24 months to the 
maximum msSBP of 141.6 mmHg, which is an increase of 4.46 mmHg over baseline. Thus, patients 
without stroke had a much more gradual increase in msSBP over time as compared to patients with a 
stroke. 
Changes in UACR 
Baseline mean UACR in patients in the stroke group on aliskiren was 1145 mg/g, which is slightly lower 
than in patients on placebo in the stroke group (1243 mg/g). Both were much higher than in patients 
who did not have a stroke (aliskiren 716 mg/g and placebo 723 mg/g, respectively).  
Assessment report for Rasilez 
EMA/139311/2012  
Page 15 
 
 
 
 
In patients with stroke on aliskiren, mean UACR increased during a time period of 24 months to the 
maximum mean UACR of 1398 mg/g, after which mean UACR dropped again. A similar pattern was 
seen in patients with stroke on placebo; mean UACR increased during a time period of 24 months to 
the maximum mean UACR of 1282 mg/g. 
In patients without stroke on aliskiren, mean UACR gradually increased over a time period of 18 
months to the maximum mean UACR of 759 mg/g. In patients without stroke on placebo, mean UACR 
gradually increased over a time period of 24 months to the maximum mean UACR of 805 mg/g mmHg. 
Therefore, in patients with stroke on aliskiren, baseline UACR and changes from baseline UACR are 
comparable to those observed in the patients on placebo, and both are much higher than those 
observed in patients who did not have a stroke (both aliskiren and placebo treatment groups). 
Changes in eGFR 
Baseline mean eGFR in patients in the stroke group on aliskiren was 52 mL/min/1.73m2, which is lower 
than in patients on placebo in the stroke group (59.5 mL/min/1.73 m2). It was also lower than in 
patients who did not have a stroke for both arms (57 mL/min/1.73 m2 in both treatment groups). 
In patients with stroke on aliskiren, mean eGFR decreased during a time period of 24 months to the 
minimum mean eGFR of 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, which is a decrease of 11.41 mL/min/1.73 m2 below 
baseline (56.41 mL/min/1.73 m2), after which mean eGFR increased again. However, in patients with 
stroke on placebo, mean eGFR decreased during a time period of 33 months to the minimum mean 
eGFR of 51 mL/min/1.73 m2, which is a decrease of 17 mL/min/1.73 m2 below baseline 
(56.41 mL/min/1.73 m2). Therefore, patients with stroke on aliskiren started with a lower mean eGFR, 
had a decrease in mean eGFR over a shorter period of time, and had a remaining lower mean eGFR 
after 39 months when compared to the patients on placebo who had a stroke. 
In patients without stroke on aliskiren or placebo, mean eGFR gradually decreased over a time period 
of 36-39 months to the minimum mean eGFR of 47 mL/min/1.73 m2 (both treatment groups), which is 
an decrease of 7-8 mL/min/1.73 m2 under baseline. Thus, patients without stroke had a much less 
pronounced decrease in mean eGFR over time as compared to patients with a stroke in both arms. 
d. Other on-going aliskiren studies 
There are four additional ongoing aliskiren studies in adult patients which include data monitoring 
committees to oversee patient safety. The four trials are ATMOSPHERE (SPP100F2301), ASTRONAUT 
(SPP100A2368) in chronic and acute heart failure respectively, APOLLO (SPP100G2301) in elderly 
hypertensive patients and the IVUS study AQUARIUS (SPP100A2366) in patients with coronary artery 
disease. The DMCs of all these 4 studies were provided with the preliminary analysis report of the 
ALTITUDE data and related DMC conclusions and were requested to provide a recommendation on 
whether their studies should continue based upon the results of ALTITUDE. All on going studies were 
recommended to be continued. The CHMP is in agreement. 
e. Other completed aliskiren studies 
In addition to the hypertension studies, 5 clinical trials with aliskiren-based therapy that were 
conducted in other patient populations were included in this review. All studies included in this review 
have previously been submitted to the CHMP.

Data from the completed aliskiren and fixed dose combination clinical trials were pooled into the 
“Alismart dataset”. This dataset includes studies conducted with aliskiren monotherapy and the 
aliskiren fixed dose combinations with amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide and valsartan. Studies are 
divided into those up to 24 weeks exposure short term studies and long term studies lasting longer 
than 24 weeks. Long term data are limited, with only 1968 patients treated with aliskiren monotherapy 
in long term studies included into this dataset, 320 of which were diabetic. Data from ALTITUDE are 
not included in the dataset at this time. 
An analysis of these data has been performed to review relevant data for the risks of acute renal 
failure, cerebrovascular disorders, hypotension, hyperkalaemia, myocardial infarction, Cardiac Failure 
and Death identified in as defined AEs of interest from the ALTITUDE study. These AEs of interest were 
analysed in two populations of the dataset – those that are similar to the ALTITUDE patient population 
(those with diabetes and reduced eGFR at baseline) and those without this baseline medical history. 
In short term trials, no differences were observed between groups treated with aliskiren (as 
monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensives) and placebo (plus background therapy of 
other non-aliskiren antihypertensive agents) with regards to defined AEs of interest. Further subgroup 
analysis did not demonstrate evidence of differential occurrence of defined events of interest in 
subgroups of ALTITUDE-like population (defined as patients with diabetes and eGFR below 
60 mL/min/1.73 m2) vs non-diabetic patients with normal renal function or between patients treated 
with or without concomitant ARB/ACE inhibitor. The patient numbers are however low for all defined 
AEs of interest and the treatment duration is limited (<24 weeks)  
In the long term dataset (26 to 52 weeks treatment duration), the rates of defined AEs of interest 
appear to be higher, although the total number of events is still low, in patients treated with aliskiren 
plus ACE inhibitors and/ or ARB compared to those treated with aliskiren without an ACE inhibitors or 
ARB.  
Whilst this analysis may indicate a potential higher incidence of the “defined AEs of interest” from the 
ALTITUDE trial in both patients with diabetes and renal failure compared those without and those 
treated with an ACE inhibitor/ARB in addition to aliskiren, conclusions may be confounded by the 
merging together of studies conducted in different patient populations. Additionally, studies that make 
up the Alismart dataset are of duration <1 year. 
Assessment report for Rasilez 
EMA/139311/2012

It should be noted that ALTITUDE data reported from the Kaplan Meier curves divergences in time-to-
event after 1.5 years of follow-up (overall). Therefore, results from short-term studies do not add 
relevant findings for assessing the benefit-risk profile of aliskiren. In the long term studies very few 
patients were identified in the ALTITUDE-like population with diabetes and reduced eGFR at baseline. 
Although such results should be taken cautiously, in the “population without diabetics or decreased 
renal function”, the adverse events of interest appear to occur at slightly higher rates in patients 
treated with aliskiren plus ACEi and/or an ARB than patients treated with aliskiren without an ACE 
inhibitor or ARB. 
Review of data from ASPIRE study  
This study has been considered to be of relevance to aid with interpretation of the ALTITUDE findings. 
ASPIRE study 
The ASPIRE study was a 36-week, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aliskiren on the prevention of left ventricular 
remodeling in high risk post-acute myocardial infarction patients when added to optimized standard 
therapy including either an ACEi or an ARB. The primary objective of the study was to test whether 
aliskiren 300 mg, in addition to standard therapy, has superior efficacy compared to placebo in 
reducing the primary index of adverse cardiac remodeling in patients after high risk acute myocardial 
infarction. 
No difference was observed between aliskiren versus placebo in the change in left ventricular systolic 
volume. Furthermore, there were no differences in any of the secondary efficacy variables, including 
the composite of CV death, hospitalization for heart failure or reduction in left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) by greater than 6 points, 29 (7%) vs. 24 (6%), HR 1.06 (CI: 0.60, 1.8) p=0.85, or the 
clinical composite of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, recurrent MI, stroke, or 
resuscitated sudden death, 39 (9%) vs. 34 (9%), HR 1.01 (CI: 0.62, 1.63); p=0.98. All-cause 
mortality was low for this high-risk MI population. However, it was numerically but not statistically 
significantly higher in the aliskiren group, 17 (4%) vs. 8 (2%), HR 1.83 (CI: 0.79, 4.3), p=0.16. 
There were non-significant numerical imbalances between treatment groups for the individual 
components including stroke, in the aliskiren treatment group vs. placebo patients [HR 2.97 (CI: 0.59-
14.86), p=0.1849]. Considering the fact that the number of stroke events was small (N=9; 1.1%) 
overall and that the study was neither designed nor powered to show differences in this endpoint, the 
conclusion at that time was that there was no significant differences between groups. 
Furthermore, the number of patients with hypotension, hyperkalaemia or renal dysfunction during the 
double-blind period was higher in the aliskiren group as compared to the placebo group (26.3% vs. 
13.6%, respectively). The total of hyperkalaemia events was 6.2% for aliskiren vs. 1.5% for placebo. 
The PT of hypotension related events (17.3% for aliskiren vs. 10.3% for placebo) were mainly driven 
by preferred term of hypotension and dizziness. Renal dysfunction (6.6% for aliskiren vs. 2.8% for 
placebo) was mainly driven by renal failure, blood creatinine increased, renal impairment and blood 
urea increased. 
The ASPIRE study does not provide information on long term data. The study shows that aliskiren has 
no effect on Left Ventricular (LV) remodelling while hypotension, hyperkalaemia or renal dysfunction 
during the double-blind period was higher in the aliskiren group as compared to the placebo group 
(26.3% vs. 13.6%, respectively). 
Assessment report for Rasilez 
EMA/139311/2012  
Page 18 
 
 
 
 
 
These results confirm the findings of the ALTITUDE study showing no increase in the occurrence of 
hospitalisations for heart failure. These data suggest a neutral effect of aliskiren on heart failure/left 
ventricular dysfunction, indicating no protective effect. 
2.2.2.  Post marketing data  
The last PSUR for aliskiren has recently been submitted to regulatory authorities and covered the one 
year period from 01 Oct 2010 to 30 Sep 2011 and additionally a review of cumulative data from the 
date of first launch to 30 September 2011 was also submitted. 
The cumulative patient exposure to aliskiren in the post marketing use since launch in March 2007 is 
estimated to be 1,946,000 patient treatment years.  
i. Renal Dysfunction 
The cumulative search, which included all clinical trial reports, reports from post marketing surveillance 
studies and spontaneous reports, identified 852 cases relating to renal impairment, of which 596 were 
spontaneous reports, 10 were literature reports, 80 clinical trial reports, and 166 were PMS reports. 
Only 5 of these reports were from the ALTITUDE trial. 
Of the 852 reports retrieved, there were two hundred and forty cases reporting preferred terms 
representing renal failure/renal dysfunction and 84 cases were reported with laboratory abnormalities 
that were assessed as being consistent with showing renal failure. Five hundred and twenty eight cases 
were not reported as renal failure or serious renal dysfunction and did not have lab information to 
suggest such a diagnosis. 
Out of the 324 cases with evidence of renal failure/ renal dysfunction, pre-existing renal disease was 
reported in 47%, diabetes in 32%, age of ≥65 years in 44% of the cases, use of concomitant ACE 
inhibitors or ARBs in 47%, and concomitant medication with NSAIDs in 16 % of the cases. 
Of the 45 clinical trial cases of serious renal impairment/renal failure, 20 cases were suspected by the 
Investigator to be related to aliskiren.  
Given that most events cited in sufficiently documented cases were from patients with pre-existing 
renal failure or diabetes or were using ACE inhibitors, ARBs or NSAIDs concomitantly, it can be 
concluded that these risk factors potentially predisposed patients to a higher risk of experiencing renal 
AEs as compared to those without these risk factors.  
ii. Hyperkalaemia 
The cumulative search in the latest PSUR identified 358 cases consistent with hyperkalaemia. Of the 
264 spontaneous and literature reports, 132 were identified as cases with higher severity and of these 
132 cases, 104 were confounded with underlying conditions or with concomitant use of medications 
known to increase risk of hyperkalaemia.  
This cumulative analysis suggests that patients treated with aliskiren and other RAAS blockers or 
NSAIDs, or those with pre-existing cardiac disease, renal disease or diabetes are at higher risk than 
general hypertensive population for development of hyperkalaemia. Therefore it was proposed in PSUR 
7 to further strengthen the wording to warn of the higher incidence of hyperkalaemia in high risk 
populations. 
iii. Hypotension 
Assessment report for Rasilez 
EMA/139311/2012  
Page 19 
 
 
 
 
 
The cumulative search in PSUR 7 identified a total of 321 cases of hypotension of which 241 were 
serious cases.  
No specific pattern in time to onset has been identified (58 cases occurred within the first month of 
treatment, with 44 cases reported between 1-3 months, and 51 cases occurring after the third month 
of treatment). However, 10 cases were identified as first dose hypotension. The majority of cases 
defined as “clinically significant” were confounded either by historical/current medical condition or 
concomitant medications. 12 cases were identified with an event of hypotension that was associated 
with collapse or syncope or leading to hospitalization, for which an association with aliskiren was not 
excluded. 
Based upon the occurrence of these events of hypotension in patients treated with aliskiren, the 
proposal to add “hypotension” as an adverse drug reaction has been agreed by the CHMP. 
iv. Stroke 
The analysis of all relevant post marketing reports identified for aliskiren identified 138 reports with 
sufficient documentation for further analysis. The majority of these reports represented ischemic 
stroke as would be expected in a hypertensive patient population. Risk factors in addition to 
hypertension included diabetes, renal dysfunction and carotid artery stenosis. No specific pattern was 
observed with regards to the time to onset of occurrence of event. 
Stroke is an event that occurs at increased rates in patients with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, 
diabetics, smokers and those with hyperlipidaemia. 
3.  Overall discussion and benefit/risk assessment 
Safety aspects 
i. ALTITUDE study  
All the information is based on the interim results of ALTITUDE study which is now terminated.  
ALTITUDE was a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomised trial that enrolled patients with Type 2 
diabetes and nephropathy of approximately 4 years of duration. Nearly half of the patients also had 
significant cardiovascular disease. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension were excluded.  Aliskiren 
was tested against placebo when added to standard therapy including an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or ARB. 
The composite end point consisted of 5 cardiovascular (CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, 
resuscitated sudden death and hospitalization for heart failure) and 2 renal components (doubling of 
serum creatinine, end stage renal disease / renal death). The goal was to demonstrate an overall 
improvement in cardiovascular and/or renal disease progression and outcomes with aliskiren therapy. 
Review of un-blinded data by the data monitoring committee resulted in a recommendation to cease 
study medication and begin to close the ALTITUDE study. The report concluded that the study was very 
unlikely to meet its primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating an improvement in cardiovascular or 
renal outcomes. The data also showed a higher incidence of adverse outcomes in the aliskiren arm 
(non-fatal stroke, ESRD/renal death, hyperkalaemia and hypotension) based on 69% of the projected 
total primary outcome events. 
Assessment report for Rasilez 
EMA/139311/2012  
Page 20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the overall randomized population, the hazard ratio (aliskiren vs. placebo) for the primary CV or 
renal composite endpoint is 1.09 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.22, 2-sided p=0.17). This indicates a potential 
increased risk with aliskiren.  
The hazard ratio for the secondary cardiovascular outcome, consisting of the CV components, is 1.14 
(95% CI: 0.99, 1.30, 2-sided p=0.07), again suggesting a lack of benefit and potential harm. The 
hazard ratio for the non-fatal stroke component within the primary outcome is 1.34 (95% CI: 1.01, 
1.77, 2-sided p=0.044) with absolute rates of 2.6% (112 events) vs. 2.0% (85 events) in aliskiren and 
placebo groups respectively. 
The hazard ratio (aliskiren vs. placebo) for the secondary renal outcome, consisting of the renal 
components is 0.93 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.15, 2-sided p=0.52). Though this suggests the possibility of an 
overall benefit for aliskiren, the result is heavily impacted by the contribution of doubling of serum 
creatinine, HR 0.90 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.12). Importantly, the observed rates of end stage renal disease / 
renal death demonstrate a numerical trend against aliskiren with a HR of 1.22 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.72)). 
Kaplan Meier curves for the above mentioned composites, as well as stroke, show divergence 
beginning approximately 1.5 years into the trial. 
Although the study was conducted in patients with diabetes, a large proportion of patients had 
underlying cardiovascular disease and a sizeable proportion of patients did not have renal disease. The 
incidence of serious cardiovascular events was of relevance in patients with previous cardiovascular 
disease. Although the HR increased similarly in patients with and without CV events, the absolute risk 
of CV events on aliskiren was increased versus placebo in patients with previous cardiovascular disease 
(15.0% and 13.4%, HR =1.12) compared to patients without previous cardiovascular disease (7.0% 
and 6.1%, HR = 1.16). Among patients with previous CV events, the highest HR was observed in 
aliskiren-associated resuscitated sudden death (HR 1.64), and lowest HR was associated with 
unplanned hospitalisation for heart failure HR (HR 0.98). One plausible molecular mechanism 
underlying the observed increased in CV events is the abrogation, in patients previously treated with 
ACEis, of the protective bradichinin-medited CV effect of ACEis due to the up-stream blockade of the 
RAAS pathway by the addition of aliskiren. However the full mechanism of action is still unclear. 
Additional sub-analyses were conducted to further understand the above findings. The subgroup 
analyses are generally consistent with the overall findings regardless of the demographics (age, race, 
regions), haemodynamics (blood pressure), co-medication, (ACEI, ARB, CCBs, beta-blockers anti-
diabetics), or baseline renal parameters (proteinuria, eGFR). No subgroups with a clear benefit or 
particularly increased risk were identified. 
Review of cases of stroke, sudden death, and renal SAEs, showed a numerical excess of events in the 
aliskiren group compared to placebo in the ALTITUDE study. The absolute risk of developing a CV 
event is greater in diabetic patients with previous CV events in the aliskiren group and there are 
concerns on the long-term safety profile of aliskiren in combination with ACEis or ARBs also in non-
diabetic patients with a history of cardiovascular events.   
Based on the results of the ALTITUDE study the benefit-risk balance for aliskiren when used in diabetic 
patients or patients with renal impairment receiving ACEis or ARBs is considered negative.   
ii. Ad-hoc Expert group meeting 
An ad hoc expert group on Cardiovascular was consulted and was of the opinion that, the data from 
ALTITUDE give rise to the concern that the combination with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may increase the 
risk in subjects with diabetes and renal disease (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and/or proteinuria 
particularly in terms of cerebrovascular and possibly cardiovascular events, hyperkalaemia, 
Assessment report for Rasilez 
EMA/139311/2012  
Page 21 
 
 
 
 
 
progression to end-stage kidney disease. As this patient population is frequent among the general 
hypertension population, the group was of the view that the concern regarding the use of the 
combination should be applied also to the current indication. An oral explanation took place during the 
meeting and the experts had the opportunity to pose questions to the MAH representatives.  Based on 
the available data from ALTITUDE, the experts were of the view that no group of patients with a 
positive benefit/risk balance can be identified for this combination treatment in the patient population 
enrolled in the ALTITUDE study.  
The expert group also agreed that the available data suggest that the safety concerns raised for the 
use of aliskiren in combination with ACE inhibitors or ARBs apply also to non-diabetic subjects with 
previous cardiovascular disease or with severe renal impairment and these patients should be carefully 
monitored in clinical practice. The expert group emphasised that all the identified safety concerns will 
have to be re-evaluated once the complete data set and analyses from ALTITUDE become available.  
Based on all the above ALTITUDE study results, analysis of the study data, and the conclusions of the 
expert group the CHMP agreed that the aliskiren containing products should not be used in 
combination with ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment 
(glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and that the combination with ACE inhibitors or 
ARBs is not recommended in all other hypertensive patients. 
iii. Other Studies 
Data from completed aliskiren and fixed dose combination clinical trials were pooled into a dataset. 
This dataset includes studies conducted with aliskiren monotherapy and the aliskiren fixed dose 
combinations with amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide and valsartan.  
One of the completed studies that the CHMP looked at was the ASPIRE study. The ASPIRE was a 36-
week, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of aliskiren on the prevention of left ventricular remodelling in high risk post-acute 
myocardial infarction patients when added to optimised standard therapy. The primary objective of the 
study was to test whether aliskiren 300 mg, in addition to standard therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARBs), 
has superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing the primary index of adverse cardiac remodelling 
in patients after high risk acute myocardial infarction. In the ASPIRE study, hypotension, 
hyperkalaemia or renal dysfunction during the double-blind period was higher in the aliskiren group as 
compared to the placebo group (26.3% vs. 13.6%, respectively). The total of hyperkalaemia events 
was 6.2% for aliskiren vs. 1.5% for placebo. Renal dysfunction (6.6% for aliskiren vs. 2.8% for 
placebo) was mainly driven by renal failure, blood creatinine increased, renal impairment and blood 
urea increased. The CHMP agreed that the safety results of the ASPIRE study compared to placebo also 
concur with the safety data of the ALTITUDE study. 
There are four additional ongoing aliskiren studies in adult patients. These trials are ATMOSPHERE 
(SPP100F2301) and ASTRONAUT (SPP100A2368) in chronic and acute heart failure respectively, 
APOLLO (SPP100G2301) in elderly hypertensive patients and AQUARIUS study (SPP100A2366) in 
patients with coronary artery disease. The safety results from ALTITUDE were provided to the 
respective DMCs of these four studies. The DMCs recommended that these on-going studies continue 
and the CHMP was in agreement. 
iv. Postmarketing data 
The last submitted PSUR 7 for aliskiren was taken into account for the assessment. 
Assessment report for Rasilez 
EMA/139311/2012  
Page 22 
 
 
 
 
 
The events in renal dysfunction were from patients with pre-existing renal failure or diabetes or were 
using ACE inhibitors, ARBs or NSAIDs concomitantly. In that effect it is concluded that these risk 
factors predisposed patients to a higher risk of experiencing renal adverse events. 
In addition the cumulative analysis of hyperkalaemia suggests that patients treated with aliskiren and 
other RAAS blockers or NSAIDs, or those with pre-existing cardiac disease, renal disease or diabetes 
are at higher risk than general hypertensive population for development of hyperkalaemia. Therefore it 
was proposed to further strengthen the warning of the higher incidence of hyperkalaemia in high risk 
populations. 
Hypotension, syncope and stroke were also observed in the post-marketing data especially if 
combining medicinal products that affect this system. Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system (RAAS) by combining aliskiren with an ACEi or an ARB is therefore not 
recommended. 
Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing experience and 
these may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In particular the cumulative analysis of the post-marketing data in 
hyperkalaemia confirmed that most cases with serum potassium above 5.5 mmol/ml were observed in 
patients treated with aliskiren and other RAAS blockers or NSAIDs, or those with pre-existing cardiac 
disease, renal disease or diabetes are at higher risk than general hypertensive population for 
development of hyperkalaemia. Therefore it was proposed to further strengthen the warning of the 
higher incidence of hyperkalaemia in high risk populations. Furthermore the monitoring of the renal 
function including serum electrolytes (including potassium) is considered necessary in such cases. 
Consistent with standard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum 
electrolytes is advised by the CHMP if co-administration is considered necessary.  
Taking into account the above frequencies the CHMP recommended that a relevant warning is put in 
the product information notifying of the possibility of developing the above mentioned adverse events.  
Benefit/risk balance 
In view of the above data the CHMP agreed that the Benefit-Risk balance of aliskiren containing 
medicinal products for hypertension remains positive under normal conditions of use, taking into 
account the restrictions and warnings agreed. 
3.1.  Risk management plan 
At the CHMP for this Article 20 procedure the Risk Management Plan (RMP) has not been requested or 
discussed. Nevertheless the CHMP recommended that an updated RMP should be submitted by the 
MAH that adequately describes all the safety concerns, the pharmacovigilance activities and the 
interventions designed to identify, characterise, prevent or minimise the risks. 
3.2.  Product information 
Following the assessment of all the available data from clinical trials and post-marketing data the 
Product Information of the aliskiren containing products have been amended to reflect the newly 
available safety information. 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)

The main amendments have been in the following sections of the SmPC: 
Section 4.3 “Contraindications”  
The CHMP requested that a contraindication was added against the use of aliskiren in combination with 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) in patients 
with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min). 
Section 4.4 “Special Warnings and precautions for use” 
The CHMP also recommended the addition of a warning that aliskiren and another RAAS agent should 
not be used concomitantly in any hypertensive patient.  
Furthermore, the incidents of hypotension, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and changes in renal function 
(including acute renal failure) have been included as those have been reported in monotherapy from 
the post-marketing observations. 
Section 4.5 “Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction”  
The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEi is being contraindicated in patients with diabetes 
mellitus or  renal impairment (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and is not recommended in other patients 
in accordance with the findings of the recent available data.  
In addition increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing 
experience and these may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or 
by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  The CHMP recommended that monitoring of renal 
function including serum electrolytes should be implemented if co-administration aliskiren with of other 
agents acting on the RAAS or NSAIDs is considered necessary. 
Other changes proposed to the SmPC 
In addition to the changes summarised above, following further review of the ALTITUDE data and in 
consideration of the safety profile of aliskiren in post-marketing experience, the safety information in 
the following sections of the SmPC has been strengthened. 
Section 4.2 “Posology” 
Information on no adjustment of the initial dose has been added to the posology section in patients 
with renal impairment.  A recommendation not to use aliskiren in patients with severe renal 
impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) has been added. 
Section 4.4 “Special Warnings and precautions for use” 
In this section the CHMP recommended the reinforcement of the warning on renally impaired patients 
for exercising caution when aliskiren is given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney 
dysfunction and also reconfirming that the concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS in 
patients with decreased renal function (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) is contraindicated. 
Section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” 
In this section the adverse events of dizziness and hypotension were added, as well the information on 
hyperkalaemia (increased serum potassium) with the concomitant use of aliskiren with either RAAS 
blockers or NSAIDS.

4.  Overall conclusion 
In conclusion the CHMP reviewed all interim data available from the ALTITUDE study, alongside with all 
data from other studies and spontaneous reports of suspected adverse drug reactions. These 
suggested an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes (hypotension, syncope, stroke, 
hyperkalaemia) and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) when aliskiren is combined 
with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, especially in diabetic patients and those with impaired renal function.  
In view of this the CHMP recommended the contraindication of the use of aliskiren containing 
medicines in combination with ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal 
impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min). 
Taking into account the post-marketing experience the CHMP concluded for all other patient groups 
that the use of aliskiren in combination with ACE inhibitors or ARBs is not recommended for the overall 
patient population.  
An initial DHPC letter was agreed by the CHMP in December 2011 to inform the healthcare 
professionals of the termination of the ALTITUDE study and preliminary warnings. 
The CHMP also endorsed the sending out of a Dear Healthcare Professional Communications (in 
February 2012) to communicate the outcome of the present review. 
The CHMP also agreed that the MAH should submit the final results of the ALTITUDE study as soon as 
they are available.

The  CHMP  recommended  the  amendment  to  the  terms  of  the  marketing  authorisation  for  aliskiren 
containing  products  for  which  the  revised  summary  of  product  characteristics,  annex  II  and  package 
leaflet are set out respectively in annexes I, II and IIIB of the opinion. 
The  scientific  conclusions  and  the  grounds  for  the  amendment  of  the  SmPC,  Annex  II,  and  package 
leaflet are set out in Annex IV of the opinion. 
5.  Conclusion and grounds for the recommendation 
Whereas

The Committee considered the procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, for 
aliskiren containing products initiated by the European Commission. 
The Committee considered the interim results of the ALTITUDE study and all available data 
submitted from clinical trials, and safety databases in relation to the overall risk of the treatment of 
hypertension of patients with aliskiren in combination with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. 
The Committee agreed that the ALTITUDE study has not yet been finalised. However and in view of 
this limitation, the Committee concluded that due to the study findings the benefit-risk balance for 
aliskiren when used in diabetic patients receiving ACE inhibitors or ARBs or patients with renal 
impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) is considered negative. 
The Committee agreed however, that the results of the ALTITUDE study provided evidence of an 
increased risk of cardiovascular and renal complications. Considering all the currently available 
data the Committee considered that it is justified to amend the Product Information for all aliskiren 
containing medicinal products in the treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients and patients 
with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2). Therefore the combination of aliskiren with 
ARBs or ACEi is being contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus and in patients with 
decreased renal function. In addition the Committee agreed that dual blockade of the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system by combining aliskiren with an ACE inhibitors or an ARB is 
therefore not recommended in all other patients.  
The Committee agreed that increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in 
post-marketing experience and these may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents 
acting on the RAAS or by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Therefore the 
Committee recommends the monitoring of the renal function including serum electrolytes if co-
administration is considered necessary. 
The Committee concluded that the benefit-risk balance of Rasilez for hypertension is positive under 
normal conditions of use, taking into account the restrictions and warnings agreed. 
In view of the above, the CHMP has recommended the variation to the terms of the Marketing 
Authorisation for Rasilez, for which the relevant sections of the Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Annex II and Package Leaflet are set out in Annex I, Annex II and III B and subject to the conditions 
set out in Annex II.

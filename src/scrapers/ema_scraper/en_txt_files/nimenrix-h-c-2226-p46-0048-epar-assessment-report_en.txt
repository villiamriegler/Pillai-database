Statistical Methods 
•  Study population /Sample size 
The target sample size was 1650 subjects evaluable for immunogenicity (412 subjects per vaccine 
group). Considering that approximately 20% of the enrolled subjects might have withdrawn or not 
been evaluable for immunogenicity, the target sample size to be enrolled was 2060 subjects (515 
subjects per vaccine group). 
The global power to meet all primary objectives considering a sample size of 412 evaluable 
subjects per group was at least 82.3%. 
A total of 2095 subjects were enrolled in this study. 
Six cohorts were defined for analysis: 
1)  Primary Total Vaccinated cohort 
The Primary Total Vaccinated cohort included all vaccinated subjects during the primary phase.  
Thus, the Primary Total Vaccinated cohort for safety included all subjects with at least one dose of 
primary vaccine administration documented and the Primary Total Vaccinated cohort for 
immunogenicity included vaccinated subjects from primary phase for whom data concerning post-
primary immunogenicity endpoint measures were available. The Total Vaccinated cohort analysis 
was performed per treatment actually administered. 
2)  Primary ATP (according to protocol) cohort for safety 
The Primary ATP cohort for safety included all eligible subjects during the primary vaccination 
phase: 
• who met all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria for the study, 
• who had received at least one dose of study vaccine/control according to their random 
assignment during the primary vaccination course, 
• for whom administration site of study vaccine/control was known, 
• who had not received a vaccine not specified or forbidden in the protocol during the primary 
vaccination phase. 
3)  Primary ATP cohort for immunogenicity 
The Primary ATP cohort for immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects from the Primary ATP 
cohort for safety: 
• who did not receive forbidden medications as defined in the protocol; 
• who had no intercurrent medical condition which might have influenced the immune response; 
• who complied with the vaccination schedule for Visits 1, 2 and 3 defined in the protocol; 
• who complied with the blood sample schedule for Visit 4. The interval between vaccination at 
Visit 3 and blood sample at Visit 4 for inclusion in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity was defined 
as 21 to 48 days.

EMA/105851/2016  
Page 17/50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4)  Booster Total Vaccinated cohort 
The Booster Total Vaccinated cohort included all subjects who received a booster dose at Visit 5. 
Thus, the Booster Total Vaccinated cohort for safety included all subjects from the primary phase 
with a booster dose administration documented and the Booster Total Vaccinated cohort for 
immunogenicity included all subjects who received a booster dose and for whom data concerning 
post-booster immunogenicity endpoint measures were available. The Booster Total Vaccinated 
cohort analysis was performed per treatment actually administered in the primary epoch. 
5)  Booster ATP cohort for safety 
The Booster ATP cohort for safety included all eligible subjects during the booster phase of the 
study: 
• who met all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria for the study; 
• who had received three (for the ACWY_3 group) or two (for the ACWY_2, MenCCRM and MenC-TT 
groups) vaccine doses in the primary vaccination phase; 
• who had received the booster vaccine dose; 
• who had not received a vaccine not specified or forbidden in the protocol (subjects who received 
a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol from 30 days before until 30 days after the study 
vaccine dose were eliminated from the Primary ATP cohort for safety if the vaccine not foreseen by 
the protocol was administered before the post-booster vaccination blood sample). 
6)  Booster ATP cohort for immunogenicity 
The Booster ATP cohort for immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects from the booster ATP 
cohort for safety: 
• who did not receive forbidden medications as defined in the protocol; 
• who had no intercurrent medical condition which might have influenced the immune response; 
• who complied with the vaccination schedule for Visit 5; 
• who complied with the blood sample schedule for Visit 6. The interval between vaccination at 
Visit 5 and blood sample at Visit 6 for inclusion in the booster ATP cohort for immunogenicity was 
defined as 21 to 48 days.

Randomisation 
Randomisation was performed at GSK Biologicals, Rixensart, using MATEX, a program developed 
for use in SAS® (Cary, NC, USA) by GSK Biologicals. 
A treatment number uniquely identified the vaccine doses to be administered to the same subject. 
A randomization block scheme was used for creating the randomization list to ensure that correct 
balance between treatments was maintained. 
The transfer of supplies was tracked in the central randomization system. 
The treatment allocation at the investigator site was performed using a central randomisation 
system on internet (SBIR). The randomisation algorithm used a minimisation procedure accounting 
for centre. After having checked the eligibility of the subject, the site staff in charge of the 
vaccination accessed the randomisation system on internet. Upon providing the subject 
identification number, the randomisation system used the minimisation algorithm to determine the 
treatment number to be used for the subject. Each treatment number had to be recorded in the 
eCRF on the Vaccine Administration screen (Randomisation/Treatment Allocation Section). 
Randomisation of subjects to assay subsets 
All subjects were to be tested at post-primary vaccination, pre-booster and post-booster time 
points for the four meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y by rSBA. In addition to this, for 
the other assays and time points, the subjects were randomised so that some assays were 
performed on subsets: 
•  At pre-vaccination, 50% of the subjects in the ACWY_3 and ACWY_2 groups were to be tested 
for rSBA-MenA and rSBA-MenC titres, the other 50% were to be tested for rSBA-MenW-135 and 
rSBA-MenY titres. In the MenCCRM and MenC-TT groups, 50% of the subjects were to be tested for 
rSBA-MenC titres and 25% of them were to be tested for rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-
MenY titres. 
•  At all time points, 50% of subjects of all groups were to be tested for hSBA titres for each of the 
four serogroups present in the MenACWY-TT vaccine. 
•  At all time points, 25% of the subjects of all groups were to be tested for antipneumococcal 
antibody concentrations by ELISA assay. The other 25% were to be tested for antibody 
concentrations/titres against the antigens present in the DTPa-IPV-HBV/Hib vaccine. 
Subjects in each group were randomly allocated to Subset 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, as shown:

• 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open study. A double-blinded design was not feasible due to differences in the 
presentation of the study vaccines and vaccination schedules across the study groups. 
Although this was an open-label study, the laboratory in charge of the laboratory testing was 
blinded to the treatment, and codes were used to link the subject and study (without any link to 
the treatment attributed to the subject) to each sample. 
The serological data, which would lead to the unblinding of the treatment groups, were not 
available during the course of the study to any investigator or any person involved in the clinical 
conduct of the study (including data cleaning). 
CHMP comment: The hierarchical testing strategy is appropriate.  
In theory, the Applicant should have pre-specified both the ATP cohort and the primary total 
vaccinated cohort as co-primary in this non-inferiority study. In practice, both were analysed and 
reached the same conclusion (See Results, below).

All CIs computed were two-sided 95% CI. 
The exact 95% CIs for a proportion within a group were calculated based on the method by 
Clopper [Clopper, 1934]. The standardised asymptotic 95% CI for the group difference in 
proportions were based on the method 6 described in paper by Newcombe [Newcombe, 1998]. The 
95% CIs for GMTs/GMCs were obtained within each group separately. The 95% CI for the mean of 
log-transformed titre/concentration was first obtained assuming that log-transformed values were 
normally distributed with unknown variance. The 95% CI for the GMTs/GMCs were then obtained 
by exponential transformation of the 95% CI for the mean of log-transformed titre/concentration. 
CHMP comment: The statistical methods are acceptable.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
There were 3 amendments to the original protocol dated 27 January 2010. 
1.  Amendment 1 (06 December 2010): administrative changes 
2.  Amendment 2 (25 May 2011): the sample size of the study population was increased by about 
50% to overcome variability in laboratory results for SBA testing; to support the data obtained by 
rSBA testing, hSBA testing was also performed; assays for streptococcus pneumoniae 
opsonophagocytotic activity and antibodies to meningococcal PS were removed based on WHO 
advice. 
3.  Amendment 3 (30 July 2012): to allow administration of MMR or MMRV vaccine throughout the 
study in line with local governmental recommendations to address a measles outbreak in Spain. 
The statistical analysis plan was revised to cater for changes in laboratory testing.  
CHMP comment: the amendments are noted without further comment.

Protocol Deviations leading to elimination from ATP analyses are presented in Table 23: 
CHMP comment: the protocol deviations appear to be balanced across the 4 groups. It is 
considered that the nature and number of deviations would not give rise to any cause for concern 
over study value. 
Withdrawals 
The number of subjects vaccinated, completed and withdrawn and reason for withdrawal is 
presented in the following table: 
Of the 2095 subjects in the Primary Total Vaccinated Cohort, 2042 subjects completed the primary 
epoch. The main reason for consent withdrawal was; not due to an adverse event, followed by 
migration from the study area or loss to follow-up.

Safety results 
Introduction 
All AEs (solicited and unsolicited) starting following administration of each dose of study 
vaccine/comparator were recorded. 
AEs of specific interest for safety monitoring included new onset of chronic illness(es) (e.g. 
autoimmune disorders, asthma, type I diabetes and allergies). 
Occurrences of AEs of specific interest were to be reported up to six months post-booster dose, 
whether or not they were considered to be possibly related to the treatment administration. 
The intensity of each AE and SAE recorded in the eCRF or SAE Report screens, as applicable, was 
to be assigned to one of the following categories: 
The following local (injection-site) AEs were solicited: 
The following general AEs were solicited: 
As a consistent method of soliciting AEs, the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) were asked a non-leading 
question such as: ‘Has your child acted differently or felt different in any way since receiving the 
vaccine or since the last visit?’ 
An 8-day follow-up (Day 0 to Day 7) of solicited AEs was to be performed after each vaccination.

The intensity of the solicited AEs was to be assessed as described in Table 12: 
Assessment of causality 
The investigator was obligated to assess the relationship between the investigational product and 
the occurrence of each AE/SAE. The investigator used clinical judgement to determine the 
relationship. 
All solicited local (injection site) reactions were considered causally related to vaccination. Causality 
of all other AEs was to be assessed by the investigator using the following question: 
Outcome of any non-serious AE within 30 days of vaccination was pro-actively assessed and 
recorded.

Safety analysis is divided in the primary phase and the booster phase. 
Primary phase 
The analysis of safety was performed on the Primary Total Vaccinated cohort. 
Patient exposure 
The number and percentage of subjects who received a vaccine dose is presented in Table 361: 
Of the total number of subjects vaccinated in the primary phase of the study, 96.8% of subjects in 
the ACWY_3 group received all 3 doses of MenACWY-TT and the coadminstered vaccines, 98.7% of 
subjects in the ACWY_2 group received all 2 doses of MenACWY-TT and 98.9% received the co-
adminstered vaccines, 98.6% of subjects in the MenCCRM group received all 2 doses of Menjugate 
and the co-adminstered vaccines and 97.0% of subjects in the MenC-TT group received all 2 doses 
of NeisVac-C and the co-adminstered vaccines.

symptom sheets >98% add to the credibility of the study reports. 
Adverse events 
Overall incidence of adverse events 
Primary phase 
The incidence and nature of symptoms (general v. local) with causal relationship to vaccination are 
presented in Table 365:

CHMP comment: for serious adverse events, respiratory tract infection and gastroenteritis are 
notable though appear to occur in all 4 treatment groups. The number of instances is too small to 
state that these may be more common (or not) upon exposure to the current product.

CHMP comment: for serious adverse events, the pattern described for the EFSU is similar to that 
observed in the primary phase i.e. respiratory tract infection and gastroenteritis. The adverse 
events are noted but the numbers are considered to be too few to draw conclusions. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Primary phase 
Five subjects withdrew due to an AE or SAE during the primary phase of the study. Two subjects 
withdrew due to SAEs and one subject withdrew due to an AE in the ACWY_3 group, one subject 
withdrew due to an SAE in the MenCCRM group and one subject withdrew due to an AE in the 
MenC-TT group. 
The three SAEs leading to withdrawal from the study were due to: 
1) Apparent life threatening illness/Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) 
2) Muscle spasms 
3) Respiratory Syncitial Virus (RSV) bronchiolitis 
None of these symptoms were determined by the investigators to be causally related to any study 
vaccination. 
Booster phase 
No adverse events led to premature discontinuation of the study in the booster phase. 
Comment comment: only 5 subjects withdrew; these withdrawals occurred during the primary 
phase and were adjudged to be unrelated to the current product. The small number of withdrawals 
is not likely to affect the overall interpretation of study outcome.

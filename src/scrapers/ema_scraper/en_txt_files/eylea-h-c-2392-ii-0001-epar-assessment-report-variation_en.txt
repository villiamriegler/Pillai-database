2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Aflibercept is a recombinant produced fusion protein consisting of ligand binding regions of human 
VEGF receptor (VEGFR) extracellular domains, fused to the Fc domain of human IgG1. Specifically, 
VEGF  Trap  comprises  immunoglobulin  (Ig)  domain  2  from  VEGFR1  fused  to  Ig  domain  3  from 
VEGFR2, which in turn is fused to the constant region of a human IgG1.  
VEGF  Trap  binds  multiple  isoforms  of  VEGF-A  and  placental  growth  factor-2  (PlGF-2)  which  are 
members of the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as potent mitogenic, chemotactic, 
and  vascular  permeability  factors  for  endothelial  cells,  producing  pathological  neovascularization 
(NV), excessive vascular permeability, and vascular inflammation.  
Eylea 
Assessment Report

The structure of VGF Trap is in the Figure below: 
Eylea has been formulated for intravitreal (IVT) administration. 
Eylea  was  recently  approved  (22  November  2012)  for  the  treatment  of  neovascular  (wet)  age-
related macular degeneration (AMD) in adults. For wet AMD, Eylea treatment is initiated with one 
injection per month for three consecutive doses, followed by one injection every two months. There 
is  no  requirement  for  monitoring  between  injections.  After  the  first  12  months  of  treatment  with 
Eylea,  the  treatment  interval  may  be  extended  based  on  visual  and  anatomic  outcomes.  In  this 
case the schedule for monitoring should be determined by the treating physician and may be more 
frequent than the schedule of injections. 
This current application is being submitted for the indication of macular edema secondary to central 
retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). 
The initial claimed posology for Macular edema (ME) following CRVO is one injection per month for 
six  consecutive  doses,  followed  by  one  injection  every  two  months  with  no  requirement  for 
monitoring between injections. 
The rationale for this development is supported by both the anti-VEGF effects of Eylea observed in 
the  AMD  preclinical  and  clinical  program  and  literature  data  indicating  a  benefit  of  anti-VEGF 
therapy in RVO: 
Evidence from both clinical and preclinical data supports the role of VEGF in pathological ocular NV.  
Research  with  VEGF  Trap  in  several  different  animal  models  of  ophthalmologic  disorders  showed 
that VEGF Trap can inhibit retinal NV and CNV, and the formation of retinal edema. VEGF Trap-Eye 
interferes  with  the  growth  of  new  blood  vessels  that  lead  to  retinal  edema,  ischemia  and 
hemorrhage in diseases of ocular NV. 
Elevated  VEGF  levels  have  been  documented  in  patients  with  CRVO.  A  variety  of  ocular  diseases, 
including  ME  following  CRVO,  is  associated  with  pathologic  NV  and  vascular  leakage,  and/or  can 
result in thickening and edema of the retina, which contributes to vision loss. VEGF Trap-Eye has a 
high  binding  affinity  for  VEGF  and  can  antagonize  the  VEGF-and  PlGF-mediated  pathologic  retinal 
vascular hyperpermeability, a critical component in the development of ME following CRVO. 
2.2.  Problem statement 
Disease 
Retinal  vein  occlusions  (RVO)  are  common  retinal  vascular  disorders  and  an  important  cause  of 
vision loss, particularly in patients with associated chronic ME. Based on the specific occlusion site, 
retinal vein occlusions are classified as either branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), central retinal 
vein occlusion (CRVO) - the two major categories of RVO- or hemiretinal vein occlusion (HRVO). 
Decreased vision in patients with CRVO may result from retinal ischemia and/or the accumulation 
of fluid within the center of the retina (macular edema). 
The estimated prevalence of CRVO worldwide ranges from 0.1% to 0.5%. 
There are no known differences among sex or ethnic groups.

Retinal  vein  occlusion  is  rarely  seen  in  individuals  younger  than  50  years  of  age;  risk  factors 
predisposing to CRVO include age greater than 65 years (ie the prevalence and incidence of RVO is 
strongly associated with increasing age). 
Both systemic and ocular risk factors have been identified for CRVO. Risk factors for CRVO include 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, higher cardiovascular risk profile, and less physical activity. Other 
risk  factors  include  glaucoma  or  elevated  intraocular  pressure  (IOP),  renal  disease,  dyslipidemia, 
coagulopathy,  and  smoking.  Inflammatory  disease  within  the  eye  may  also  contribute  to 
pathogenesis. 
The  increased  retinal  venous  vascular  pressure  that  results  from  CRVO  causes  transudation  of 
plasma  and  blood,  resulting  in  edema  and  hemorrhages  throughout  all  or  most  of  the  retina. 
Severe edema appears to increase interstitial pressure and compromise arterial perfusion, resulting 
in  variable  amounts  of  capillary  occlusion  and  cotton  wool  patches  (nerve  layer  infarcts).  The 
resulting retinal ischemia leads to the production of inflammatory mediators such as  VEGF,  which 
increase vascular permeability and promote neovascularization, leading to ME. 
Perfusion status:  
The  degree  of  retinal  ischemia  is  one  of  the  major  determinants  of  outcome  in  CRVO.  Central 
retinal vein occlusion is classified as ischemic,  non-ischemic, or indeterminate as assessed by the 
degree of capillary dropout and prolonged transit time observed with fluorescein angiography (FA).  
- The less common is ischemic CRVO : If the vein blockage leads to inadequate oxygen delivery to 
the  sensitive  retinal  tissue,  the  CRVO  is  considered  to  be  of  the  “non-perfused”  or  “ischemic” 
subtype. This subtype is associated with extensive hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, edema of the 
macula  and  optic  nerve  head,  visual  acuity  worse  than  20/400,  afferent  pupillary  defect.  This 
subtype  is  typically  more  severe  and  less  responsive  to  treatment.  The  visual  prognosis  in  ME 
following CRVO is poor in patients with the ischemic subtype. 
-  The  more  common  is  non  ischemic  CRVO  (approximately  75%  of  all  cases):  Blood  flow  and 
oxygen  delivery  is  restored  following  the  vein  blockage  and  the  CRVO  is  considered  to  be  of  the 
“perfused” or “non-ischemic” subtype which is associated with less severe retinal findings, a lack of 
an  afferent  pupillary  defect  and  cotton  wool  spots  and  a  VA  better  than  20/200).    Non-perfused 
CRVO is therefore suggested by vision that is worse than 20/200. 
The Central Vein Occlusion Study (CVOS) classified CRVOs into perfused (<10 disc areas of retinal 
capillary non perfusion) or non perfused (≥10 disc areas of retinal nonperfusion), or indeterminate, 
based  on  the  amount  of  amount  of  retinal  non  perfusion  on  wide-field  intravenous  fluorescein 
angiography (IVFA).    The  designation  of  indeterminate  is  made  when  the  retina  is  obscured  such 
that an ischemia assessment cannot be made. 
Complications and causes of vision loss:  
The  majority  of  vision  loss  associated  with  CRVO  results  from  the  main  complications:  macular 
edema,  vitreous  hemorrhage,  neovascularisation  (NV),  and  neovascular  glaucoma  and  macular 
edema, with or without macular non-perfusion, is the most frequent cause of vision loss in patients 
with RVO.  
The  more  dramatic  complication  associated  with  ME  following  CRVO  is  the  development  of 
intraocular NV. Eyes with ischemic CRVO may develop NV of the iris or angle, which may, in turn, 
lead  to  the  development  of  neovascular  glaucoma.  There  is  a  direct  correlation  between  the 
severity of ischemia and the risk of developing NV. 
Diagnosis: 
Patients  with  RVO  typically  present  with  sudden,  unilateral,  painless  loss  of  vision.  The  degree  of 
vision loss depends on the extent of retinal involvement and on macular perfusion status. 
Retinal vein occlusion has a characteristic appearance on fundus examination (ie extensive retinal 
signs, with dilated and tortuous veins, are seen in all quadrants, often along with optic-disk edema).  
Current CRVO – Management and Treatment 
The  Central Vein Occlusion  Study (CVOS) Group demonstrated that grid laser photocoagulation is 
not  an  effective  treatment  for  decreased  vision  due  to  CRVO-related  macular  edema.  Since 
publication  of  that  report  and  of  treatment  guidelines  for  RVO  by  the  Royal  College  of 
Ophthalmologists, the standard of care for patients with decreased vision due to CRVO-associated 
macular edema was observation.

However, in the past 5 years, several major randomized controlled clinical trials have investigated 
new  therapeutic  modalities  for  the  treatment  of  macular  edema  secondary  to  CRVO  and  progress 
over this time has drastically changed the management of CRVO. 
Intravitreal Anti-VEGF Agents 
In clinical practice, IVT anti-VEGF injections are offered to patients with ME associated with CRVO, 
but  to date, only ranibizumab is approved (in US in 2010 and in  EU in 2011) as a treatment for 
CRVO.  Published  results  of  the  CRUISE  trial  with  ranibizumab  (ranibizumab  have  made  IVT  anti-
VEGF agents a first-line option for the treatment of ME associated with CRVO. 
Ranibizumab  
The  published  CRUISE  study  was  a  randomized,  sham-controlled,  clinical  trial  designed  to 
investigate the efficacy and safety of IVT of ranibizumab in patients with with ME following CRVO. 
392 patients were randomized to receive monthly IVT ranibizumab injections of 0.3 mg (n = 132) 
or 0.5 mg (n = 130), or sham injections (n = 130). Study entry criteria included a best-corrected 
ETDRS  visual  acuity  between  20/40  and  20/320  and  a  mean  OCT-measured  central  subfield 
thickness of ≥250 μm. 
The primary outcome in this study was mean change in best-corrected visual acuity ETDRS letter 
score at 6 months compared with baseline, and patients were followed through to month 12. 
Secondary  outcomes  include  the  proportion  of  eyes  experiencing  ≥15  letters  of  improvement  in 
best-corrected  visual  acuity  and  mean  decrease  in  OCT-measured  central  foveal  thickness  at  6 
months compared with baseline. 
At  the  6-months  primary  endpoint,  mean  change  from  baseline  in  best  corrected  visual  acuity 
(BCVA)  letter  score  was  +12.7  letters  and  +14.9  letters  in  the  0.3  mg  and  0.5  mg  ranibizumab 
groups, respectively, and +0.8 in the sham group (difference in means vs Sham +14.1 letters for 
the 0.5 mg ranibizumab group; p<0.0001).  
The percentage of patients who gained ≥15 letters in BCVA was 46.2% (0.3 mg) and 47.7% (0.5 
mg)  in  the  ranibizumab  groups  and  16.9%  in  the  sham  group  (difference  in  means  vs  Sham 
+30.8% for the 0.5 mg ranibizumab group; prespecified secondary endpoint; p<0.0001). At month 
6,  the  mean  (95%  CI)  change  from  baseline  in  Central  Foveal  Thickness  (CFT)  was  -452.3  µm 
(95%  CI  –497.0,  -  407.6)  in  the  0.5  mg  (n  =  130)  ranibizumab  groups  compared  with  -167.7 
(95% CI -221.5, -114.0) µm in the sham group (n= 129).  
The  average  normal  central  subfield  thickness  is  212  µm.  The  percentage  of  patients  with  CFT 
≤_250 µm at month 6, which was 76.9% (0.5 mg) in ranibizumab-treated patients compared with 
23.1% in the sham group (P<0.0001) (Brown et al; 2010). 
Corticosteroids 
Despite  concerns  about  the  incidence  of  complications  due  to  increased  intraocular  pressure  and 
cataracts, corticosteroids have been developed as treatment of CRVO-ME. 
Ozurdex® (an IVT dexamethasone implant) was first approved by the US FDA for ME secondary to 
CRVO in June 2009 and then received approval in the EU in 2010.  
Dexamethasone (Ozurdex) 
Ozurdex is a dexamethasone IVT implant that was designed to deliver intraocular therapeutic levels 
of dexamethasone for the treatment of ME following BRVO or CRVO. 
Approval  was  based  on  the  results  of  two  simultaneous  phase  III  trials  which    enrolled  1267 
patients  with  BCVA  between  20/50  and  20/200  secondary  to  chronic  intraretinal  edema.  This 
device  produced  significantly  greater  and  more  rapid  improvement  in  vision  compared  with  sham 
treatment.  
Triamcinolone Acetonide (Trivaris) 
The  Standard  Care  vs  Corticosteroid  for  Retinal  Vein  Occlusion  (SCORE)  trial  treated  participants 
with non-ischemic CRVO-ME with either 1 mg or 4 mg IVT triamcinolone injections repeated every 
4 months, or observation alone.  
Laser Photocoagulation 
The  Central  Vein  Occlusion  Study  (CVOS)  Group  demonstrated  that  macular  grid  laser 
photocoagulation  is  not  indicated  for  eyes  with  ME  associated  with  CRVO.  Patients  showed  no 
significant  improvement  in  vision  after  3  years  of  treatment  with  grid  laser  therapy,  although 
fluorescein  angiographic  leakage  was  reduced.  In  the  same  study,  scatter  laser  photocoagulation 
decreased the risk of neovascular glaucoma among patients with iris neovascularization. 
Panretinal  laser  photocoagulation  is  useful  for  the  treatment  of  neovascular  complications 
associated  with  CRVO.  However,  the  CVOS  Group  demonstrated  that  prophylactic  PRP  is  not 
indicated,  and  instead,  PRP  should  be  administered  only  after  the  onset  of  iris  NV  to  prevent 
development of neovascular glaucoma.

•  CHMP guidelines/Scientific Advice 
CHMP Guidance 
There is no CHMP guidance for the development of drugs in this pathology and target population. 
Clinical EU Scientific Advices  
The clinical CRVO development program for Eylea appeared fairly in compliance with the Scientific 
Advices received.  
The  “phase  3  only”  approach  (not  favoured  in  the  Scientific  Advice)  led  to  a  limited  CRVO  safety 
population. Nevertheless, previous AMD and DME data give a substantial additional support to the 
CRVO safety.  
Because  advices  were  given  before  any  anti-VEGF  product  (or  corticoids)  was  registered  as  a 
treatment  of  ME  associated  to  CRVO,  a  design  using  a  “Sham”  as  comparator  was  considered 
appropriate at the time of the advice. Additionally, the AMD development for Eylea was at the very 
beginning and the relevant strength and dosing regimen for Eylea was not yet fixed.  
With  the  recent  EU  registrations  of  ranibizumab,  dexamethasone  and  triamcinolone  as  CRVO 
treatments,  a  direct  comparison  with  an  active  comparator  is  missing  in  the  Eylea  CRVO  clinical 
program. 
•  Significance of paediatric studies 
The  European  Medicines  Agency  has  waived  the  obligation  to  submit  the  results  of  studies  with 
Eylea  in  all  subsets  of  the  paediatric  population  in  CRVO.  The  Opinion  Decision  was  issued  on  17 
June  2011  to  grant  a  product–specific  waiver  (Decision  Number  P/0186/2011)  for  all  subsets  of 
paediatric  population  to  Aflibercept  solution  for  injection,  intravitreal  use,  for  the  treatment  of 
CRVO, on the grounds that the disease occurs only in the adult population. 
•  GCP aspects 
According  to the  sponsor,  all  clinical  studies  were  performed  in  accordance  with  the  Good  Clinical 
Practice,  the  ethical  principles  that  have  their  origin  in  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki,  and  are 
consistent with the applicable regulatory requirements. 
Study  number  14130  (GALILEO  -  Europe  and  Asia/Pacific)  has  been  audited  for  compliance  with 
Good Clinical Practice by GCP Study Audit Management of Bayer Schering Pharma according to the 
current  GCP  guideline.  The  audit  certificate  signed  by  Dr.  Rafael  Rak  on  01  April  2011  (Global 
Development Quality) is provided. 
Study  number  VGFT–OD-0819  (COPERNICUS-United  States,  Canada,  Colombia,  India  and  Israel) 
has  been  audited  for  compliance  with  Good  Clinical  Practice  by  Regeneron.  The  audit  certificate 
signed by William Coogan on 16 May 2011 (GPC Auditing) was provided. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  nonclinical  development  program  of  Eylea  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetic  (PK)  behavior,  and  toxicology  of  VEGF  Trap  in  support  of  the  clinical  intravitreal 
(IVT)  treatment  and  marketing  authorization  for  different  ocular  vascular  diseases  including 
neovascular  (wet)  age-related  macular  degeneration  (current  indication)  and  macular  edema 
following central retinal vein occlusion (scope of this type II variation). 
2.3.2.  Toxicology 
Reproduction toxicity: In the present type II variation, the applicant provided new data regarding 
reprotoxicity,  as  a  combined  early-embryonic  and  embryo-fetal  development  study  in  pregnant 
Himalayan  rabbits  after  subcutaneous  (SC)  administration.  Furthermore,  an  additional  previous 
subcutaneous  range-finding  study  carried  out  in  the  same  species  was  also  provided  by  the 
applicant.

The  applicant  had  provided  data  on  reprotoxicity  previously  in  the  marketing  authorization 
application  for  Eylea  in  neovascular  (wet)  age-related  macular  degeneration.  Fertility  endpoints 
were  evaluated  as  part  of  a  6-month  repeat-dose  intravenous  (IV)  toxicity  study  in  Cynomolgus 
monkeys and a prenatal developmental toxicity study was conducted in New Zealand white rabbits 
after IV administration. 
 
Previous reproductive toxicity studies 
Results  of  the  study  conducted  in  monkeys  treated  with  VEGF  Trap  doses  of  0,  3,  10,  and  30 
mg/kg  administered  once  weekly  for  the  first  15  weeks  of  the  study  and  then  once  every  two 
weeks  for  the  remaining  12  weeks,  showed  that  fertility  was  affected  at  all  doses  in  females 
(absent  or  irregular  menses  associated  with  alterations  in  female  reproductive  hormone  levels, 
ovary weight changes accompanied by compromised luteal development and reduction of maturing 
follicles)  and  males  (decreased  sperm  motility  and  increased  sperm  abnormalities,  but  fully 
reversible  after  the  5-month  treatment-free  phase).  A  NOAEL  for  VEGF  Trap  effects  on  fertility 
parameters  was  not  determined.  Based  on  Cmax  and  AUC0-168h  estimates  for  free  VEGF  Trap  that 
were  determined  at  the  3  mg/kg  IV  dose  (the  LOAEL),  the  systemic  exposure  to  free  VEGF  Trap 
was  4902-fold  and  1546-fold  higher,  respectively,  than  the  systemic  exposure  to  free  VEGF  Trap 
observed in humans after an IVT dose of 2 mg/eye.   
In  the  prenatal  developmental  toxicity  study  conducted  in  White  New  Zealand  rabbits,  animals 
were dosed with 0, 3, 15, or 60 mg/kg/administration of VEGF Trap to mated female New Zealand 
white rabbits once daily 30-minute IV infusions on gestational days (GD) 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18. At 3 
mg/kg and higher, dose-related increases in fetal resorptions, pregnancy disruptions and numerous 
fetal  (external,  visceral  and  skeletal)  malformations  were  observed.  The  maternal  NOAEL  was 
considered  to  be  3  mg/kg,  whereas  the  developmental  NOAEL  was  not  identified.  Comparison  of 
the systemic exposures (based on AUC0.5-72h) observed in this study with exposures to free VEGF 
Trap observed in humans following a 2 mg IVT dose indicate an exposure margin of 678-fold.

Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Aflibercept is exempted from an environmental risk assessment, because it is a protein,  unlike to 
result in a significant environmental risk. Accordingly, it fulfills the criteria mentioned in the EMEA 
guideline  CHMP/SWP/4447/00  (1)  for  substances  exempted  from  an  environmental  risk 
assessment.

Therefore,  no  further  evaluations  of  Afllibercept  regarding  the  environmental  risk  have  to  be 
performed. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
As has been established in all of the toxicity studies conducted in rodents, rabbits, and monkeys by 
measuring the levels of antibodies specifically generated against VEGF Trap, the use of rabbits for 
the assessment of prenatal toxicity is relevant because of the limited formation of anti-VEGF Trap 
antibodies in this animal model. Furthermore, in vitro studies demonstrated that VEGF Trap binds 
with  picomolar  affinity  to rabbit  VEGF-A165  (K D  =  0.775  pM)  with  similar  affinity  to  human  VEGF-
A165 (K D = 0.497 pM). 
The  combined  early-embryonic  and  embryo-fetal  development  study  was  carried  out  in  pregnant 
Himalayan rabbits treated with SC administration of VEGF Trap doses of 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg body 
weight  (b.w.)  on  gestation  day  (GD)  1,  GD7  and  GD13.  These  doses  were  selected  based  on  the 
results of a previous subcutaneous range-finding study carried out in the same species treated with 
single  SC  administration  of  VEGF  Trap-Eye  doses  of  0.1  and  1  mg/kg  b.w.  (Study  N°  I  5175-8, 
VGFT-TX-10035).  Moreover,  the  aim  of  this  study  was  to  investigate  the  effects  of  VEGF  Trap  on 
early embryonic development (exposures during day 1 post coitum (p.c.) and day 6 p.c.) and the 
influence  on  embryo-fetal  development  (exposures  during  day  7  p.c.  and  days  18/20  p.c.). 
Therefore,  the  treatment  periods  (GD1,  7  and  13)  selected  in  this  study,  are  considered 
appropriate. 
In  this  study,  no  impact  on  maternal  toxicity,  gestation  rate,  postimplantation  loss,  placental 
weight,  placental  appearance,  fetal  sex  distribution  or  fetal  weight  was  observed  at  all  doses 
tested.  The overall  rate  of  cardiac  ventricular  septal  defects  (with/without  malformation  of  major 
vessels) and skeletal malformations was slightly higher in VEGF Trap treated than control animals, 
but  showed  no  clear  dose-dependency.  Spina  bifida  was  seen  in  a  single  fetus  from  each  of  2 
different  dams  that  received  0.1  mg/kg  b.w.  during  gestation.  Meningocele  was  seen  in  1  fetus 
from  a  single  dam  that  received  1.0  mg/kg  b.w.  during  gestation.  Based  on  the  results  of  this 
study, the maternal NOAEL was considered to be 1 mg/kg b.w. The developmental NOAEL was not 
identified. 
Comparison of the systemic exposures (based on AUC) observed in this study with mean exposures 
to free VEGF Trap observed in humans following a 2 mg/eye dose indicates an exposure margin of 
approximately 10-fold. Thus, these data support the warning that treatment with VEGF Trap is not 
recommended  during  pregnancy  and  the  SmPC  labelling  in  sections  5.3  and  4.6  was  revised 
accordingly. 
The  submitted  preclinical  data  support  the  warning  that  treatment  with  VEGF  Trap  is  not 
recommended during pregnancy.  SmPC sections 5.3 and 4.6 were revised accordingly. 
As  aflibercept  is  a  protein,  it  is  unlikely  to  result  in  significant  risk  to  the  environment  and  it  is 
exempted from an environmental risk assessment. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  SmPC  wording  provides  adequate  information  to  support  the  fact  that  treatment  with  VEGF 
Trap is not recommended during pregnancy. 
The  updated  data  submitted  in  this  application  do  not  lead  to  a  significant  increase  in 
environmental  exposure  further  to  the  use  of  aflibercept.    Considering  the  previously  submitted 
data, aflibercept is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  VEGF  Trap  were  initially  elucidated  in  patients  with  neovascular  (wet) 
AMD. Systemic concentrations of VEGF Trap were below those expected to elicit a systemic effect. 
The data obtained in this group of patients have been reviewed in the context of this MAA.  
In  subjects  with  AMD,  VEGF  Trap  was  slowly  absorbed  into  the  systemic  circulation  after  IVT 
administration.  Systemic  concentrations  of  VEGF  Trap  were  well  below  those  expected  to  elicit  a 
systemic effect. Consistent with this, no effect of VEGF Trap on blood pressure (BP) was observed 
Eylea 
Assessment Report

after IVT administrations of doses up to 4 mg in the AMD population. As with other large proteins, 
both  free  and  bound  VEGF  Trap  are  expected  to  be  cleared  by  proteolytic  catabolism.  The  data 
collected  in  the  AMD  development  program  provide  relevant  supportive  information  for 
understanding the behavior of VEGF Trap in subjects with ME secondary to CRVO. 
The clinical pharmacology program for VEGF Trap-Eye in subjects with ME secondary to CRVO had 
the  specific  objective  to  characterize  the  PK  and  systemic  exposure  of  VEGF  Trap  after  IVT 
administration  in  subjects  with  CRVO,  and  compare  the  PK  and  the  systemic  exposure  with  that 
observed in subjects with AMD.

To  characterize  the  pharmacokinetics  of  free  and  bound  VEGF  Trap,  data  were  collected  from  the 
GALILEO study using a sparse sampling schedule for all patients and a dense sampling schedule in 
a subset of patients. Sparse VEGF Trap plasma concentration data were used to compare steady-
state  VEGF  Trap  free  and  adjusted  bound  trough  concentrations  across  the  CRVO  subject 
population  and  to  assess  the  effect  of  a  number  of  covariates  on  these  trough  concentrations. 
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  then  calculated  by  non-compartmental  analysis  of  the  dense 
VEGF Trap plasma concentration time data. 
From these investigations the following could be concluded: 
Absorption and Distribution 
After IVT administration of VEGF Trap-Eye in patients with CRVO, the drug is slowly absorbed into 
the systemic circulation. On average, the geometric mean Cmax of free VEGF Trap of 0.046 μg/ml 
(range  0.024  to  0.081  μg/ml)  after  a  2  mg  IVT  injection  occurs  by  the  second  day  (tmax)  after 
dosing.  Following  tmax,  free  VEGF  Trap  concentrations  decline  rapidly,  becoming  BLQ  in  the 
validated analytical assays between days 4 to 5 after dose administration in most patients. 
Exploratory  sub-population  analysis  of  trough  concentrations  of  adjusted  bound  VEGF  Trap  in  the 
plasma revealed no clinically relevant variations in systemic exposure related to age, gender, BMI, 
creatinine  clearance,  hepatic  impairment,  or  patient  populations  in  Europe,  Japan,  or  Asia/Pacific 
(including  Japan).  Because  all  trough  concentrations  of  free  VEGF  Trap  in  the  plasma  were  below 
LLOQ, exploratory subgroup analyses could not be conducted. 
Comparison of systemic exposure to free and bound VEGF Trap following a 2 mg IVT administration 
of  VEGF  Trap-Eye  in  patients  with  CRVO  with  that  reported  in  patients  with  neovascular  AMD 
revealed  only  small  numerical  differences.  Considered  in  totality;  the  PK  data,  the  mean  trough 
concentrations,  and  the  sub-population  covariate  analysis  for  adjusted  bound  VEGF  Trap 
demonstrate  that  neither  the  difference  in  study  population  demographics,  nor  difference  in 
disease-related pathology resulted in any clinically meaningful difference in the systemic exposure 
to free or bound forms of VEGF Trap in the CRVO patients as compared with the neovascular AMD 
patients that were previously studied. 
As  predicted,  based  on  the  systemic  concentrations  of  free  VEGF  Trap  measured  in  patients  with 
neovascular  AMD  after  IVT  administration  of  VEGF  Trap-Eye,  patients  with  CRVO  also  exhibited 
systemic  concentrations  of  VEGF  Trap  that  were  low  and  well  below  the  plasma  concentrations 
needed  to  half-maximally  bind  VEGF  and  cause  a  pharmacologically  relevant  reduction  in 
endogenous systemic VEGF (Consistent with this, there were no observed effects on measured BP 
or  AEs  associated  with  increased  BP  in  either  the  GALILEO  (14130)  or  COPERNICUS  (VGFT-OD-
0819) study. 
Eylea 
Assessment Report 
Page 14/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Anti-drug antibody (ADA) potential was also evaluated in both studies. 
In  both  the  COPERNICUS  (VGFT-OD-0819)  and  GALILEO  (14130)  studies,  VEGF  Trap-Eye 
demonstrated very low immunogenicity; the few positive responses in the ADA assay exhibited low 
titers  and  no  lizing  activity.  There  was  no  apparent  impact  on  PD  or  safety  in  those  patients 
demonstrating  a  positive  response  in  the  ADA  assay.  These  results  are  comparable  to  those 
observed for the AMD development program. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  systemic  exposure  to  VEGF  trap-Eye  in  CRVO  patients is  consistent  with  the  one  observed  in 
AMD  patients.  Low  exposure  was  observed.  Plasma  levels  were  well  below  the  plasma 
concentrations  needed  to  half-maximally  bind  VEGF  and  cause  a  pharmacologically  relevant 
reduction in endogenous systemic VEGF.  
Also, VEGF trap-Eye showed low immunogenicity in CRVO patients. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology data obtained in the CRVO patients studied, including clinical PK 
and  the  ADA  response  indicated  that  the  CRVO  patient  population  tolerates  and  responds  to  IVT 
administration of VEGF Trap-Eye in a manner similar to that observed in neovascular AMD patients. 
Therefore,  the  more  detailed  discussion  of  Clinical  Pharmacology  for  VEGF  Trap-Eye  previously 
presented in the EPAR for AMD patients is also relevant for the CRVO patient population. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development program of Eylea / VEGF Trap-Eye for the treatment of CRVO comprised 
two  phase-3  studies:  Study  VGFT-OD-0819  (COPERNICUS)  and  Study  14130  (GALILEO  –CRS 
A52377). 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
• 
Dose selection rationale 
The  rationale  for  the  final  dose  selection  of  2  mg  IVT  injections  of  VEGF  Trap-Eye  every  4  weeks 
was  based  on  the  safety  and  efficacy  results  achieved  using  the  2Q4  dose  in  the  Phase-2  AMD 
study VGFT-OD-0508 (CLEAR-IT), and on the known disease characteristics of CRVO. As the acute 
critical  phase  of  this  disease  is  characterized  by  a  larger  area  of  leakage  associated  with  higher 
intraocular VEGF levels than in AMD, it was reasonable to expect that meaningful treatment results 
could be achieved within 6 months of treatment using the 2 mg dose at a 4-week interval. 
The  sham  control  reflected  the  current  standard  of  care  at  the  inception  of  the  clinical  program, 
namely observation until progression to anterior segment NV, at which time subjects were treated 
with PRP. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The  COPERNICUS  and  GALILEO  studies  were  conducted  to  assess  the  efficacy,  safety,  and 
tolerability of repeated intravitreal (IVT) administration of 2 mg Eylea / VEGF Trap-Eye in subjects 
with macular edema secondary to CRVO.  
They  were  randomized,  double-masked,  sham-controlled,  using  a  ratio  of  3:2  /  VEGF  Trap-Eye: 
sham,  with  stratification  by  geographic  region  (North  America  vs  Rest  of  World  in  COPERNICUS, 
and Europe vs Asia-Pacific in GALILEO) and baseline BCVA (> 20/200 vs ≤ 20/200). Only one eye 
per subject was designated the study eye and received treatment under the study protocol. 
All  subjects,  regardless  of  treatment  group,  were  allowed  to  receive  pan-retinal  photocoagulation 
if  they  progressed  to  anterior  segment 
(PRP)  rescue  at  any  time  during  the  study

neovascularization elsewhere in the fundus (NVE).In addition to this, it was left to the discretion of 
the investigator to perform PRP treatment according to local- or country-specific guidelines, based 
on  his/her  clinical  judgment  and,  as  appropriate,  as  guided  by  fluorescein  angiography  (FA) 
analysis.

First  24-week  period  (primary  endpoint):  Subjects  received  either  2  mg  Eylea  /  VEGF  Trap-Eye, 
2Q4 for 20 weeks, or sham (false) injections every 4 weeks for 20 weeks.

Then, subjects continued through a second treatment period beginning at Week-24 up to Week-52: 
In contrast to the first period, different study designs were  used in GALILEO and in COPERNICUS 
studies for this second period of treatment: 
→In  GALILEO,  subjects  remained  on  either  active  or  sham  treatment  as  randomized:  subjects  in 
the VEGF Trap-Eye group received either 2 mg Eylea / VEGF Trap-Eye injections or sham injections 
according  to  protocol-defined  retreatment  criteria,  while  subjects  in  the  sham  group  continued  to 
receive only sham injections. 
→I n  COPERN I CUS,  a ll subjects (including subjects from the sham group) were eligible to receive 2 
mg  Eylea  /  VEGF  Trap-Eye  injections  or  sham  injections  in  accordance  with  protocol-defined 
retreatment criteria. 
In the first 52 weeks of the study, subjects were evaluated every 4 weeks for safety and BCVA. 
The final treatment of the 52-week treatment period was administered at Week 48. 
Follow-up periods were carried out up to Week 76 for GALILEO and to Week 100 for COPERNICUS.

investigational agent). 
Systemic: 
Infections,  uncontrolled  hypertension  and  diabetes  mellitus,  cerebrovascular  or  myocardial 
infarction within 6 months prior study and renal failure requiring dialysis or transplant. 
Systemic angiogenic medications 
There  were  differences  between  both  studies  in  exclusion  criteria  for  the  history  of  allergy  to 
povidone iodine and the prior use of anti-angiogenic drugs in the fellow eye.

Treatments 
GALILEO study design 
Sham:  Sham  injections  involved  using  a  syringe,  without  a  needle,  to  exert  pressure  on  the  eye, 
and did not involve intraocular penetration or injection of any substance. 
Starting  at  Week-1  through  Week-24  (first  period  /primary  end  point),  according  to  the 
randomization, subjects received either 2 mg Eylea / VEGF Trap-Eye IVT or Sham false IVT every 4 
weeks (VTE2Q4) for 20 weeks.  
Starting  at  Week-24  through  Week-52,  subjects  were  evaluated  monthly  and  received 
either  2  mg  Eylea  /  VEGF  Trap-Eye  according  to  the  protocol  retreatment  criteria*  or  sham 
injections for 48 weeks. Subjects in the sham group continued to receive only sham injections. 
Starting  at  Week  52  through  Week  76,  all  subjects  in  the  GALILEO  study  were  eligible  to 
continue in a 6-month PRN extension, with  follow-up  visits  every  8  weeks: In the VEGF Trap-
Eye  treatment  group,  subjects  received  either  2  mg  VEGF  Trap-Eye  IVT  injections  or  sham 
injections, according to the retreatment criteria. In the sham group, subjects received 2 mg VEGF 
Trap-Eye at Week 52 unless the masked investigator decided, for medical reasons that study drug 
treatment was not in the best interest of the subject. 
COPERNICUS study design 
Sham: Sham injections using a syringe without a needle, were performed with no active drug and 
without intraocular penetration. 
Starting  at  Week-1  through  Week-24  (first  period  /primary  end  point),  according  to  the 
randomization, subjects received either 2 mg Eylea / VEGF Trap-Eye IVT or Sham (false IVT) every 
4 weeks (VTE2Q4) for 20 weeks.

Starting  at  Week  24  and  through  Week  52,  subjects  were  evaluated  monthly  and  were 
eligible  in  both  treatment  groups  to  receive  according  to  protocol-defined  retreatment  criteria*, 
either VEGF Trap-Eye 2 mg IVT injections PRN or sham injections for 48 weeks. 
Starting  with  Week  52  up  to  Week  100,  all  subjects  were  eligible  to  continue  in  a  1-year 
extension  phase.  In  this  phase,  subjects  were  evaluated  quarterly  and  receive  2  mg  Eylea  / 
VEGF Trap-Eye according to the protocol retreatment criteria (no sham injections are given during 
this phase). Based on the investigator’s opinion, a subject may be dosed as frequently as every 4 
weeks. 
* Retreatment criteria (These were similar in GALILEO and COPERNICUS Studies): 
-Retreatment for deterioration 
As assessed by OCT: > 50 micron increase in CRT compared to the lowest previous measurement; 
New or persistent cystic retinal changes or retinal fluid; Persistent diffuse edema ≥ 250 microns in 
the central subfield;  
Loss  ≥  5  letters  in  BCVA  compared  to  the  best  previous  measurement  in  conjunction  with  any 
increase in CRT; 
-Retreatment for improvement 
Retreatment was to be performed in the case of rapid and substantial improvement of visual acuity 
(defined  as  a  letter  gain  >  5  letters  since  the  last  visit)  in  the  absence  of  retinal  edema  in  the 
central subfield. 
Objectives 
Both  studies  were  designed  to  primarily  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  VEGF  Trap-Eye  over 
sham  injections  (false  injections)  on  best-corrected  visual  acuity  (BCVA)  assessed  by  the  Early 
Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart in subjects with macular edema secondary to 
CRVO..  
The sham control was chosen to represent the standard of care that was in place at the time of the 
initial CRVO clinical development program (i.e. observation until clinical progression and then pan-
retinal photocoagulation (PRP) as needed if neovascularization developed). 
Secondary  objectives  included assessment of (i) the safety and tolerability of IVT administered 
VEGF  Trap-Eye  in  subjects  with  macular  edema  secondary  to  CRVO,  (ii)  the  effects  of  IVT 
administered  VEGF  Trap-Eye  on  central  retinal  thickness  (CRT)  in  subjects  with  macular  edema 
secondary to CRVO  
The PK of free and bound VEGF Trap in a subset of subjects (ie, from the dense or serial sampling 
of at least 24 subjects at selected study sites) was only assessed in GALILEO study. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy  and  safety  variables  were  assessed  for  each  study  individually  (ie,  COPERNICUS  and 
GALILEO) and in an integrated analysis of the pooled 6-month data from the two Phase-3 studies. 
The primary endpoint for both studies was set at Week 24 (i.e. 6-month).  
The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  gained  ≥  15  letters  of  BCVA 
(using the 4-meter ETDRS protocol or 1-meter for low vision) over baseline at Week 24. 
Several approaches of handling discontinued subjects/missing data were used in individual studies. 
In  COPERNICUS,  subjects  who  discontinued  from  the  study  prior  to  Week  24  and  who  had  fewer 
than  five  study  treatments  were  judged  as  non  responders  (otherwise  LOCF/FAS)  whereas,  in 
GALILEO,  all  subjects  who  discontinued  from  the  study  prior  to  Week  24  were  judged  as  failures 
(FAS). 
Secondary  efficacy  variables for each study individually (ie, COPERNICUS and GALILEO) were: 
Change from baseline in BCVA score at Week 24,  
Change from baseline in central retinal thickness (CRT) at Week 24,  
Proportion of subjects progressing to neovascularization by Week 24, 
Change from baseline in the NEI VFQ-25 total score at Week 24.  
GALILEO also included the change in the EQ-5D score from baseline to Week 24.  
The only tertiary  efficacy  variables  assessed  at  Week  24 (FAS) were the changes in the NEI 
VFQ-25 subscores for near activities, distance activities, and vision dependency. 
Eylea 
Assessment Report 
Page 18/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additional tertiary variables were as follows:  
Proportion of subjects gaining 15 or more letters from baseline to Week 52,  
Change from baseline in BCVA score at Week 52,  
Change from baseline in CRT at Week 52,  
Proportion of subjects progressing to neovascularization by Week 52,  
Change from baseline in the NEI VFQ-25 total score at Week 52,  
Changes  in  the  NEI  VFQ-25  subscales  (distance  activities,  near  activities,  and  vision  dependency) 
from baseline to Week 52;   
GALILEO  Study  also  included  the  change  in  the  EQ-5D  score  from  baseline  to  Week  52,  and 
time to first neovascularization by Week 52. 
In  addition,  long  term  results  from  follow  up  periods  (100-week  treatment  duration  for 
COPERNICUS  and  76-week  for  GALILEO) have been provided by the applicant in two specific 
separate reports. Similar variables than at 24 and 52 weeks period have been explored. 
Sample size 
Anticipating a difference of 25% between the two treatment groups in the proportions of subjects 
gaining  at  least  15  letters  (sham  15%,  VTE  2Q4  40%),  it  was  determined  that  a  total  of  150 
subjects  (60  in  the  sham  group  and  90  in  the  VTE  2Q4  group)  would  be  needed  to  detect  this 
difference  with  a  power  of  90%  in  a  two-sided  Fisher’s  exact  test  at  level  5%.  To  account  for  an 
approximate  10%    (9%  in  COPERNICUS)  dropout  rate,  165  subjects  (66  sham  and  99  VTE  2Q4) 
were planned to be randomized and treated. This sample size would provide at least a 90% power 
for the primary analysis using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test. 
GALILEO:  A total of 172 subjects (68 sham; 104 VTE 2Q4) were actually randomized and treated 
in the study. 
COPERNICUS:  A  total  of  189  subjects  (74  sham;  115  VTE  2Q4)  were  actually  randomized  and 
treated in the study. 
Randomisation 
In  both  studies,  subjects  were  enrolled  and  randomized  on  day  1  (visit  2)  according  to  the 
randomization  procedure  in  a  3:2  ratio  to  VEGF  Trap-Eye  or  sham  injection  treatment  regimens, 
respectively. 
A stratification by geographic region (North America vs Rest of World in COPERNICUS, and Europe 
vs Asia-Pacific in GALILEO) and baseline visual acuity (BCVA ≤ 20/200, i.e. letters read <=34 and 
BCVA > 20/200, i.e. letters read >=35) was performed. 
Blinding (masking) 
In  order  to  maintain  masking  of  the  study,  subjects  in  the  control  group  underwent  sham  (false) 
injections at the monthly study visits from Day 1 through and including Week 20. 
Study drug injections and sham injections were performed by an unmasked physician. A separate 
masked physician was assigned to supervise the masked assessment of efficacy, to assess safety 
and  ancillary  study  measures.  Masked/unmasked  roles  were  documented  by  an  affidavit  prior  to 
the start of the study.Switching of masked/unmasked roles was not permitted during the course of 
studies. The study drug was prepared at the studies’ sites by an  unmasked individual qualified to 
prepare drug for IVT injection.  
All  VEGF  Trap-Eye  and  sham  treatments  were  packaged  in  identical  treatment  kits  with  identical 
labeling except for the kit number. 
Populations for analysis 
The  full  analysis  set  (FAS)  included  all  randomized  subjects  who  received  any  study  treatment 
(VEGF Trap-Eye or sham injection) and had a baseline ETDRS score and at least one post-baseline 
ETDRS  score.  It  was  based  on  the  treatment  allocated  (as  randomized).The  FAS  was  the  primary 
efficacy analysis set and was analyzed as randomized. 
The  per-protocol  set  (PPS)  included  all  subjects  in  the  FAS  who  received  at  least  5  study 
treatments and did not have a major protocol violation (ie, a violation that may have affected the 
interpretation  of  the  study  results).  The  PPS  was  also  used  for  the  efficacy  assessments  and  was 
analyzed as treated. 
Eylea 
Assessment Report 
Page 19/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
The safety analysis set (SAF) included all subjects who received any study treatment. The SAF was 
analyzed as treated. 
Statistical methods 
Integrated analyses of the pooled data of both CRVO studies were planned for the 24 weeks and 52 
weeks studies’periods. 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  conducted  on  the  FAS  population.  An  analysis  on  the  PPS 
population was conducted as supportive. 
The robustness of the primary endpoint results from baseline to week 24 was assessed through a 
number  of  sensitivity  analyses  by  using  observed  value  analyses,  dropouts  counted  as  non-
responders analyses and last observation carried forward (LOCF) analyses that were performed on 
both FAS and PPS populations. 
The primary analysis was  a statistical  evaluation  of  superiority  of  VEGF  Trap-Eye  to  sham 
(false)  injections  with  respect  to  the  primary  efficacy  variable  (ie  proportion  of  subjects  who 
gained at least 15 letters at Week 24).  
The  two  treatment  groups  were  compared  using  a  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  (CMH)  test  with 
stratification adjustment for geographic region (Europe vs Asia/Pacific or North america/rest of the 
world depending of the study) and baseline visual acuity (BCVA > 20/200 vs BCVA ≤ 20/200) at a 
two-sided test level of 5%. 
A  logistic  regression  was  performed  as  secondary  statistical  method of  evaluation  for  the  primary 
endpoint. 
Handling of discontinuations:  
In GALILEO, all subjects who discontinued from the study prior to Week 24 were judged as failures 
(FAS). 
In  COPERNICUS,  subjects  who  discontinued  from  the  study  prior  to  Week  24  and  who  had  fewer 
than  five  study  treatments  were  judged  as  non  responders;  otherwise,  missing  values  were 
imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF) analyses. 
All  subjects  were  eligible  to  receive  PRP  at  any  time  during  the  study  if  they  progressed  to  any 
clinically significant ocular neovascularisation: 
In  GALILEO,  a  subject  receiving  PRP  was  to  be  discontinued  from  study  treatment  but  may  have 
remained in the study until Week 76 for safety assessments. 
In  COPERNICUS,  a  subject  who  received  PRP  was  eligible  to  remain  in  the  study  and  continue  to 
receive study treatment until Week 100. 
Secondary efficacy analyses : 
The secondary efficacy analyses were to be conducted with the FAS to test for superiority of VEGF 
Trap-Eye treatment to sham. 
If  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  statistically  significant,  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  to 
be tested by means of a hierarchical sequence of statistical hypotheses testing in order to control 
for  multiplicity  (sequence:  change  in  BCVA  letter  score  at  Week  24,  change  in  CRT  at  Week  24, 
proportion of subjects progressing to any neovascularization at Week 24, change in total NEI VFQ-
25 score at Week 24, and change in EQ-5D score at Week 24). For secondary endpoints, analysis 
of  covariance  (change  in  CRT,  change  in  NEI  VFQ-25  total  scores,  and  change  in  EQ-5D  scores), 
analysis  of  variance  (change  in  BCVA)  or  CMH  procedures  (proportion  of  subjects  progressing  to 
any neovascularization) were used. 
Tertiary efficacy analyses: 
-Variables: 
No  statistical  hypotheses  were  examined  for  the  analysis  of  the  tertiary  endpoints.  Results  were 
summarized using the FAS and PPS populations using the LOCF method. 
Subgroups analyses based on demographics and/or baseline disease characteristics were explored: 
Age  (<  65  years,  ≥  65  to  <  75  years;  ≥  75  years),  sex,  race,  ethnicity,  renal  function  (normal; 
mild,  moderate  or  severe  impairment),  hepatic  impairment,  baseline  BCVA  (>  20/200  and  ≤ 
20/200), geographic region, baseline perfusion status, and duration of disease (≤ 2 months and > 
2 months).

Disposition of all randomized Subjects  
In GALILEO study 
A total of 25 (14.1%) subjects discontinued the study prior to week 24 (15 [21.1%] in the sham 
group  and  10  [9.4%]  in  the  VEGF  Trap-Eye  2Q4  group)  among  whom  3  were  found  to  have  had 
BRVO after having received 2 to 3 injections (PID 760020002, PID 760020003, and PID 760020004) 
and were considered major protocol deviations.  
Moreover, 5 of the 25 subjects who prematurely discontinued from the study before Week 24 had 
not received any study treatment 
Subjects  who  discontinued  study  treatment  were  allowed  to  remain  in  the  study  and  continue  to 
undergo  the  protocol-specified  evaluations.  A  total  of  29  [16.4%]  prematurely  discontinued  study 
drug  before  week  24  (18 [25.4%]  in  the  sham  group  and  11  [10.4%]  in  the VEGF  Trap-Eye  2Q4 
group).  
The primary reasons for premature discontinuation from the study were: 
-in the sham group, “Lack of efficacy” (n=5, 7.0%), and “AE (n=4, 5.6%).  
-in the VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4 group, “Protocol violation” (n=5, 4.7%).

The primary reasons for premature discontinuation from study treatment were: 
-in the sham group, “Lack of efficacy” (n=4, 5.6%), and “AE (n=8, 11.3%).  
-in the VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4 group, “Protocol violation” (n=5, 4.7%). 
In COPERNICUS study 
A  total  of  19  (10.1%)  subjects  discontinued  the  study  prior  to  week  24  and  prematurely 
discontinued study drug (14 [18.9%] sham, and 5 [4.3%] VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4).  
The primary reasons for premature discontinuation from the study or study treatment were: 
- 
- 
in the sham group, “treatment failure” (n=4, 5.4%), and “AE (n=3, 4.1%).  
in the VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4 group, “withdrawal of consent” (2.6% VEGF Trap-Eye). 
Database errata in relation with safety:  
- 
Subject  501-001  was  prematurely  unmasked  during  the  study  as  a  result  of  an  SAE  of 
central retinal artery occlusion which subsequently determined to be a SUSAR. The information was 
entered incorrectly in the eCRF at the study site; the event was only captured in Listing 14.3.2/3 
(Serious  adverse  events)  but  not  in  Listing  14.1.1/4  “Patients  Unmasked  During  the  First  24 
Weeks”. 
- 
Subject  103-003:  One  incidence  of  an  SAE  of  Endophthalmitis  determined  to  be  related  to 
the  injection  procedure,  was  erroneously  captured  in  the  database  as  being  related  to  study 
medication.  
Integrated analysis 
Of the 366 randomized subjects, 44 (12%) were discontinued before Week 24. These included the 
6 subjects who were randomized but not treated. The proportion of discontinuations was higher in 
the sham group (20.0%) than in the VTE2Q4 group (6.8%).  
The most common reasons for discontinuation from study before Week 24 were: 
in the sham group, “adverse events” (AEs; 4.8%) and “lack of efficacy” (3.4%); 
- 
- 
in the VTE2Q4 group,  “withdrawal by subject” (2.7%) and “protocol violations” (2.3%).  
In  both  pivotal  studies,  subjects  may  have  discontinued  study  medication  but  remained  in  the 
study for safety follow-up assessments: 
Of  the  360  randomized  and  treated  subjects,  43  (11.9%)  discontinued  study  medication  before 
Week 24. The proportion of these discontinuations was higher in the sham group (20.4%) than in 
the VTE2Q4 group (6.4%).  
The most common reason for discontinuation of study drug were: 
- 
- 
in the sham group, “AEs” (6.3%); 
in the VTE2Q4 group, “protocol violations” (2.3%).

GALILEO  was  a  Phase-3,  randomized,  double-masked,  multicenter  clinical  study  conducted  in 
Austria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Australia, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. 
The COPERNICUS study was conducted in 55 study  sites in the United States, Canada,  Colombia, 
India, and Israel. 
Baseline data 
In  the  integrated  analysis,  demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  in  the  FAS  were  balanced 
between treatment groups.

Main  baseline  demographics  of  the  study  eye  (GALILEO,  COPERNICUS  and  Integrated 
analysis); FAS 
Demographic characteristics for the PPS were similar to those of the FAS.  
Baseline demographic characteristics 
Overall,  in  the  integrated  analysis,  based  on  the  data  including  both  the  Sham  and  VTE  2Q4 
population, the mean (SD) age of the subjects was 64.0 (13.6) years, with a range of 22 years to 
89  years,  and  slightly  more  subjects  were  male  (56.4%)  than  female  (43.6%),  most  were 
white.The difference observed in race or ethnicity between studies reflects the region were studies 
were  conducted.  Approximately  46%  of  subjects  were  younger  than  65  years  of  age,  and 
approximately  32%  were  between  65  and  75  years  of  age.  There  was  a  greater  proportion  of 
subjects  in  the  ≥75  age  category  in  the  sham  group  (29.1%)  compared  to  the  VEGF  Trap-Eye 
group (17.5%).  
The  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  ≥75  age  category  was  greater  in  COPERNICUS  (29.9%)  than  in 
GALILEO (13.5%).  
Concerning  co-morbidities,  the  rate  of  patient  with  medical  history  of  diabete  mellitus  and 
hypertension  is  higher  in  CRVO  (21.1%  and  57.8%)  than  in  AMD  studies  (12.3%  and  55.5%). 
However,  the  rate  of  patient  with  medical  history  of  cerebrovascular  accident  and  myocardial 
infarction is lower in CRVO (5.1% and 9.8%) than in AMD studies (7.9% and 17.2%). 
As  expected,  mean  age of  patients included  in  CRVO  studies  is lower  than  those  included in  AMD 
studies:  whereas  mean  age  in  the  pivotal  trials  in  AMD  of  patients  was  76  years,  mean  age  in 
CRVO studies was 64.0 years. 
In  GALILEO  study,  a  greater  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  ≥75  age  category  was  observed  in  the 
sham  group  (29.1%)  compared  to  the  VEGF  Trap-Eye  group  (17.5%).  However,  response  in  age 
subgroups is consistent in all categories for BVCA score at 24 weeks (FAS): 
Age group: <65 Sham 5.6 vs VTE 19.7 
Age group: >=65 - <75 Sham 3.0 vs VTE 15.4 
Age group: >=75 sham -0.8 vs VTE 20.1 
Also,  a  greater  proportion  of  subjects  (including  Sham  and  VTE2Q4  groups)  in  the  ≥75  age 
category is observed in COPERNICUS (29.9%) compared to GALILEO (13.5%).  
Eylea 
Assessment Report

However,  as  seen  in  GALILEO,  BVCA  score  at  24  weeks  in  COPERNICUS  study  (FAS)  yielded 
consistent responses in all categories of age subgroups  
Age group: <65 Sham -3.7 vs VTE 19.5 
Age group: >=65 - <75 Sham 1.3 vs VTE 16.5 
Age group: >=75 sham -8.5 vs VTE 14.8 
Finally,  BVCA  score  at  24  weeks  were  all  in  favour  of  VTE2Q4  across  age  subgroups  and  across 
studies. Therefore, the apparent differences between studies in age subgroups are not considered 
as a cause of concern. 
Main  baseline  disease  characteristics  of  the  study  eye  (GALILEO,  COPERNICUS  and 
Integrated analysis); FAS 
Baseline disease characteristics for the PPS were similar to those of the FAS.  
In the integrated analysis, for the overall population, baseline BCVA in the study eye was >20/200 
in  the  majority  of  subjects  (82.4%).  Approximately  75%  of  subjects  had  a  perfusion  status  of 
perfused, and 12% had a non perfused status. Mean BCVA was 51.2 letters, mean retinal thickness 
was  665.7  microns,  mean  baseline  intraocular  pressure  (IOP)  was  15.0  mm  Hg,  and  mean  NEI 
VFQ-25 total score was 78.55. Mean time since CRVO diagnosis was 2.56 months, with 57.5% of 
subjects having been diagnosed within less than 2 months of starting the studies and slightly more 
patients had disease duration < 2 months (61% and 55% for Sham and VTE2Q4, respectively). 
Concerning  co-morbidities,  the  rate  of  patient  with  medical  history  of  diabete  mellitus  and 
hypertension  is  higher  in  CRVO  (21.1%  and  57.8%)  than  in  AMD  studies  (12.3%  and  55.5%). 
However,  the  rate  of  patient  with  medical  history  of  cerebrovascular  accident  and  myocardial 
infarction is lower in CRVO (5.1% and 9.8%) than in AMD studies (7.9% and 17.2%).

Overall,  demographic  characteristics  and  baseline  disease  characteristics  in  the  FAS  by  subgroup 
were balanced between treatment groups.  
In both studies and in both groups, the majority of subjects had a baseline ETDRS score ≥ 20/200 
or 35 letters. 
Nonetheless,  the  table  reporting  the  baseline  disease  characteristics  of  both  GALILEO  and 
COPERNICUS  shows  some  numeric  differences  between  studies  on  baseline  ETDRS  scores  (≤ 
20/200  or  34  letters:  17.6  and  16.5  letters  vs  24.7  and  24.6  letters  for  Sham  and  VTE2Q4,  in 
GALILEO  and  COPERNICUS  studies,  respectively).  This  suggests  a  less  severe  baseline  disease 
level in GALILEO study compared to COPERNICUS study. According to the Applicant, the fact that, 
in GALILEO, sham subjects were required to receive only sham treatment for a full year, may have 
led physicians enrolling somewhat less severe patients. 
Nevertheless, results in GALILEO and in COPERNICUS studies for mean changes in BVCA score at 
24 weeks (FAS) yielded consistent responses in favour of VTE 2Q4 across studies when analysing 
by BCVA strata: 
GALILEO: 
BCVA > 20/200 : Sham  3.0 vs VTE 17.4 
BCVA ≤ 20/200: Sham  4.8 vs VTE 21.1 
COPERNICUS:  
BCVA > 20/200 : Sham -5.4 vs VTE 15.9 
BCVA ≤ 20/200: Sham  0.0 vs VTE 21.9 
In  both  studies  and  in  both  groups,  the  majority  of  subjects  had  a  baseline  perfusion  status  of 
perfused.  
Frequency  of  concomitant  use  of  new  therapies was similar between treatment groups; the 
most common were ophthalmologicals, throat preparations, and systemic antibacterials and cardiac 
therapy drugs. 
Medical and surgical history:  
Similar balanced results were observed in the FAS and in PPS. 
In GALILEO study:  
-The most frequent medical history findings were in the Eye Disorders SOC (retinal vein occlusion 
(170 [98.8%]), macular edema (105 [61.0%]), cataracts (58 [33.7%]), retinal hemorrhage (57 
[33.1%]), papilloedema (34 [19.8%]), and retinal vascular disorder (18 [10.5%]). 
-The  most  frequent  non-ocular  medical  history  findings  were  in  the  Vascular  Disorders,  Surgical 
and Medical Procedures, and Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders SOCs. 
In COPERNICUS study: 
-The  most  commonly  reported  ocular  and  non-ocular  medical  or  surgical  history  findings  at 
baseline  in  the  SAF  consisted  of  Eye  Disorders  (188  [100%]  subjects),  Vascular  Disorders  (141 
[75.0%]  subjects),  Surgical  and  Medical  Procedures  (130  [69.1%]  subjects), and  Metabolism  and 
Nutrition Disorders (105 [55.9%] subjects).  
-The most common medical and surgical history findings in the study eye were RVO (188 [100%] 
subjects),  Cataracts  (95  [50.5%]  subjects),  Retinal  Hemorrhage  (45  [23.9%]  subjects),  Vitreous 
Detachment (36 [19.1%] subjects), and Cataract Operations (36 [19.1%] subjects)  
-The  most  common  non-ocular  medical  and  surgical  history  findings  were  Hypertension  (133 
[70.7%] subjects), Hypercholesterolemia (52 [27.7%] subjects), Drug Hypersensitivity (36 [19.1%] 
subjects),  Gastroesophagael  Reflux  Disease  (33  [17.6%]  subjects),  Depression  (32  [17.0%] 
subjects),  Post-Menopause  (30  [16.0%]  subjects),  Hypothyroidism  (27  [14.4%]  subjects), 
Osteoarthritis  (23  [12.2%]  subjects),  Arthritis  (20  [10.6%]  subjects),  and  Seasonal  Allergy  (19 
[10.1%] subjects).

Sample Size and Efficacy Analysis Sets for GALILEO, COPERNICUS and integrated analysis 
GALILEO analysis set: 
Proportion of subjects included: 
177 subjects were randomized (71 in the Sham group and 106 in the VEGF TRAP group). 
SAF: 172 (97.2%) ie 68 (95.8%) in the Sham group and 104 (98.1%) in the VEGF TRAP group.  
FAS: 171 (96.6%) ie 68 (95.8%) in the Sham group and 103 (97.2%) in the VEGF TRAP group. 
The proportion of subjects included in the SAF and FAS was very similar in both treatment groups. 
Thirty-three subjects from the FAS had major protocol deviations that excluded them from the PPS. 
PPS: 138 (78.0%) ie 51 (71.8%) in the Sham group and 87 (82.1%) in the VEGF TRAP group. A 
higher percentage of subjects in the VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4 were included in the PPS than in the sham 
group. 
Of the 177 randomized subjects, 25 subjects had major protocol deviations (10 in the sham group 
and 15 in the VTE 2Q4 group).  
The  most  common  major  protocol  deviation  was  inclusion/exclusion  error  at  study  entry  or 
excluded  concomitant  treatment,  which  occurred  respectively  with  15  subjects  (6  in  the  sham 
group  and  9  in  the  VTE  2Q4  group)  or  10  subjects  (4  in  the  sham  group  and  6  in  the  VTE  2Q4 
group).  The  3  subjects  in  the  VTE  2Q4  group  found  to  have  BRVO  after  having  received  2  to  3 
injections were discontinued from the study for a protocol violation. 
COPERNICUS analysis set: 
Proportion of subjects included: 
189 subjects were randomized (74 in the Sham group and 115 in the VEGF TRAP group). 
SAF: 188 (99.5%) ie 74 (100%) in the Sham group and 114 (99.1%) in the VEGF TRAP group, in 
this latter group one patient was excluded for lack of treatment.  
FAS: 187 (98.9%) ie 73 (98.6%) in the Sham group and 114 (99.1%) in the VEGF TRAP group. 
The proportion of subjects included in the SAF and FAS was very similar in both treatment groups. 
PPS:  168  (88.9%)  ie  60  (81.1%)  in  the  Sham  group  and  108  (93.9%)  in  the  VEGF  TRAP  group.  
A  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  VEGF  Trap-Eye  2Q4  were  included  in  the  PPS  than  in  the 
sham  group.  Reasons  for  exclusion  from  the  PPS  had  been  either  major  protocol  deviations  or  a 
number of less than 5 injections of study drug or sham. 
The main reason for exclusion from the PPS was “fewer than 5 injections during the first 24 weeks 
of the study” and these were in the majority in the Sham group ie 13 (17.6%) vs 4 (3.5%) for the 
VEGF TRAP group. 
A total of 6 (3.2%) subjects had major protocol deviations, these were also more frequent in the 
Sham  group  ie  3  (4.1%)  vs  3  (2.6%)  for  the  VEGF  TRAP  group.  Reasons  for  major  protocol 
deviations in the VEGF  TRAP group, were equilibrated between “inclusion/exclusion error at study 
entry”,  “treatment  deviation”  and  “procedure  deviation”  [1  (0.9%  for  each,  respectively]  while  in 
Eylea

the  sham  group  the  main  reasons  were  “inclusion/exclusion  error  at  study  entry”  and  “treatment 
deviation” [2 (2.7%) and 1 (1.4%), respectively]. 
Outcomes and estimation 
1. 
Treatment Compliance during the first 24 weeks: 
In GALILEO Study 
The  mean  of  the  compliance  values  was  90.1%  (median:  100%;  FAS)  in  the  Sham  group  and 
96.5%  (median:  100%;  FAS)  in  the  VTE  2Q4  group  with  a  range  of  individual  compliance  from 
17% to 100%. 
During  the  first  24  weeks  of  the  study,  146/171  subjects  (85.4%)  in  the  FAS  received  the  six 
scheduled treatments. A higher proportion of subjects in the VTE 2Q4 group (89.3%) received all 
six scheduled treatments than in the sham group (79.4%).  
A lower proportion of subjects in the VTE 2Q4 group (6.8%) received ≤ 3 treatments than in the 
sham group (14.7%). 
In COPERNICUS Study 
The mean compliance was 98.2% in both dose groups. 
The  percentage  of  subjects  who  received  ≥5/6  injections  was  97.3%  (sham  group)  and  99.1% 
(VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4). 
During  the  first  24  weeks  of  the  study,  89.0%  (sham  group)  to  92.1%  (VEGF  Trap-Eye  2Q4)  of 
subjects received all six planned injections.  
Integrated analysis 
During the first 24 weeks of the study in the FAS, 85.1% (sham) to 91.2% (VTE2Q4) of subjects 
received the six planned injections, and mean compliance was 96.17% overall.  
In  the  PPS,  93.7%  (sham)  to  94.4%  (VTE2Q4)  of  subjects  received  all  planned  injections,  and 
mean compliance was 98.96% overall during the first 24 weeks of the study. 
During the first 24 weeks of the study in the FAS, 81.6% of subjects in the sham group and 94.9% 
of subjects in the VTE2Q4 group received ≥5/6 injections. 
Overall, compliance in the FAS, PPS and the SAF showed a similar trend.

Primary  Efficacy  Variable:  Proportion  of  Subjects  who  Gained  15  or  More  Letters  in  the 
ETDRS Letter Score at Week 24 by Study and Integrated Analysis (FAS) 
GALILEO study - Primary efficacy variables results from baseline to Week 24: 
The GALILEO  study met the primary efficacy endpoint. The proportion of subjects who gained at 
least  15  letters in  BCVA  (considering  discontinued  subjects  before  Week  24  judged  as  failures)  in 
the  VTE  2Q4  group  (60.2%;  FAS)  was  statistically  superior  to  the  proportion  in  the  sham  group 
(22.1%;  FAS),    reaching  a  clinically  relevant  difference  of  38.3%(p<0.0001) in  favour  of  the  VTE 
2Q4 group.  
Results  based  on  the  analysis  performed  in  the  PPS  showed  consistency  with  the  analysis 
conducted  in  the  FAS.  These  results  showed  a  clinically  relevant  efficacy  and  highly  significant 
superiority of VTE 2Q4 group over the sham group as reported below: 
Results  of  the  by-region  analysis  (Europe  and  Asia/Pacific)  and  by  baseline  BCVA  categories 
(BCVA >20/200 and BCVA ≤ 20/200) showed the same trend of superiority of VTE 2Q4 to sham.  
The  robustness  of  the  primary  endpoint  results  from  baseline  to  week  24  was  verified  by  the 
results  of  a  number  of  sensitivity  analyses  performed  both  in  the  FAS  and  in  the  PPS  which  were 
also highly significant.

Results  considering  discontinued  subjects  before  Week  24  with  <  5  injections  as  failures  were 
similar to those obtained when discontinued subjects before Week 24 were judged as failures. 
Categorized  Gains/Losses  in  Vision  at  Week  24:  a  higher  proportion  of  subjects  treated  with 
VTE2Q4  compared  to  sham  gained  ≥  10  letters  (71.8%  and  30.9%,  respectively)  or  ≥  30  letters 
(16.5% and 2.9%, respectively) by Week 24. 
Subgroup analyses of the proportion of subjects who gained 15 or more letters at Week 24, based 
on sex, age, race, renal  function, baseline BCVA, baseline perfusion status, disease duration, and 
ADA status, provided consistent results with those of the overall population.  
Larger  numerical  differences  between  VTE  2Q4  and  sham  were  observed  in  some  subgroups  [ie 
baseline  perfusion  status  of  nonperfused  (64.3%);  Subjects  aged  ≥75  years  (58.9%);  Disease 
duration < 2 months (50.9%); Asian subjects (48.2%)] compared to what observed in the whole 
study population (unadjusted difference between groups 38.1%). 
Similarly, within the treatment groups, the proportion of subjects who gained ≥15 letters at Week 
24  was  higher  for  the  younger  subjects  and  for  subjects  of  VTE  2Q4  group  who  begun  treatment 
within 2 months of diagnosis. 
Study Sites in Japan included 21 subjects in the FAS for the assessment of efficacy: 8 in the sham 
group  and  13  in  the  VTE  2Q4  group):  Results  of  the  analyses  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint 
showed an unadjusted difference between groups (VTE 2Q4 minus sham) of 49.0% (95% CI=14.0, 
84.0) consistent with the other populations. 
Consistency with the previous results is also observed from the logistic regression modeling for the 
probability of gaining at least 15 letters considering treatment, region, and baseline BCVA category 
as  fixed  factors  (secondary  method  of  statistical  evaluation  of  the  primary  endpoint)  with  an  OR 
estimate of 5.38 (95% CI = 2.68 to 10.80; p < 0.0001) in favour of VEGF Trap-Eye vs sham. 
Additional analysis of the primary efficacy variable performed on the PPS yield to consistent results 
compared to the FAS analysis. The applicant has performed a number of sensitivity analyses which 
results are highly consistent with the primary analysis. 
The Logistic regression used as secondary method of statistical evaluation of the primary endpoint 
in  GALILEO  study  confirmed  a  superiority  in  favour  of  the  VEGF  Trap-Eye  group  over  the  Sham 
group [odds ratio estimate of 5.38 (95% CI = 2.68 to 10.80), p < 0.0001]. 
Therefore, the GALILEO study met the primary end point. 
COPERNICUS study - Primary efficacy variables results from baseline to Week 24: 
The  COPERNICUS  study  met  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint.  The  proportion  of  subjects  who 
gained  at  least  15  letters  (considering  discontinued  subjects  before  Week  24  with  <  5  injections 
judged as failures) in BCVA in the VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4 group (56.1%) was statistically significantly 
superior  to  the  proportion  in  the  sham  group  (12.3%)  reaching  a  clinically  relevant  difference  of 
45.4%(p<0.0001) in favour of the VTE 2Q4 group.  
Results in the PPS yielded consistency: 
Results of the by-region analysis showed a same trend of superiority in favour of VTE 2Q4 to sham 
for region “North America”. Results were different for “Rest of the world” but the sample size was 
small.  
The  results  of  the  analysis  by  baseline  BCVA  categories  (BCVA  >20/200  and  BCVA  ≤  20/200) 
yielded consistency between subgroups.

The  robustness  of  these  results  was  confirmed  in  a  number  of  sensitivity  analyses  performed  in 
both  the  FAS  and  PPS:  Sensitivity  analyses  performed  on  the  primary  endpoint  using  observed 
values, using the “pure LOCF” method, using dropouts counted as non-responders provided similar 
results  to  those  in  the  FAS  /LOCF.  Results  considering  discontinued  subjects  before  Week  24  as 
failures were similar to those obtained when discontinued subjects with < 5 injections were judged 
as failures. 
Categorized Gains in Vision (ie, at least 10, 15, or 30 letters) and Losses (ie, less than 0, 10, or 15 
letters)  at  Week  24:  57.9%  of  subjects  in  the  VEGF  Trap-Eye  2Q4  group  gained  ≥15  letters  of 
vision compared to 12.3% of subjects in the sham group. The majority (93.9%) of subjects in the 
VEGF  Trap-Eye  2Q4  group  gained  ≥0  letters  compared  to  52.1%  of  subjects  in  the  sham  group. 
More subjects in the sham group lost ≥5, ≥10 or ≥15 letters than in the VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4 group 
(39.7%, 30.1% and 27.4% versus 4.4%, 1.8% and 1.8%, respectively). 
In  general,  results  of  the  subgroup  analyses  were  qualitatively  consistent  with  the  results  of  the 
overall  population, even  though  several  of  the  subgroups  were  too  small  to  draw  any  meaningful 
conclusions.  
A quantitatively larger difference between VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4 and sham at week 24 was seen in 
subjects with CRVO diagnosis time of ≤2 months (68.8% vs 15.4%, for VEGF Trap-Eye and Sham 
groups, respectively). 
As  seen  in  GALILEO  study,  within  the  VEGF  Trap-Eye  2Q4  group,  the  proportion  of  subjects  who 
gained  ≥  15  letters  at  week  24  was  higher  for  younger  subjects,  those  with  a  baseline  BCVA  of  
20/200 letters, and subjects beginning treatment within ≤2 months of diagnosis.  
Logistic  regression  modeling  for  the  probability  of  gaining  at  least  15  letters  in  BCVA  considering 
treatment, region and baseline BCVA as fixed factors (secondary method of statistical evaluation of 
the primary endpoint), yielded an odds ratio (OR) estimate of 10.656 (95% CI: 4.707 to 24.123, 
p<0.0001) for the VEGF Trap-Eye group versus the  sham Group, indicating approximately an 11-
fold  increase  in  the  probability  of  gaining  at least 15  letters  under treatment with  VEGF  Trap-Eye 
compared to treatment with sham. 
At week 24, more subjects in the sham group had a non-perfused status / ≥10 DA of capillary non-
perfusion (23.3%) compared to the VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4 group (7.9%).  
Some  differences  in  the  behaviour  of  the  sham  group  in  the  two  studies,  with  subjects  in  the 
GALILEO  sham  group  performing  better  than  the  COPERNICUS  sham  subjects,  may  explain  the 
slightly better results observed in COPERNICUS study (45.4%) than in GALILEO study (38.3%) for 
the primary variable. 
The  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  variable  performed  on  the  PPS  supported  the  FAS  analysis.  
The  applicant  has  performed  a  number  of  sensitivity  analyses  which  results  are  highly  consistent 
with the primary analysis. 
The Logistic regression used as secondary method of statistical evaluation of the primary endpoint 
in COPERNICUS study confirmed a superiority in favour of the VEGF Trap-Eye group over the Sham 
group [odds ratio estimate of 10.656 (95% CI: 4.707 to 24.123), p<0.0001].  
Therefore, the COPERNICUS study met the primary end point. 
Integrated analysis - Primary efficacy variables results from baseline to Week 24: 
Monthly  intravitreal  injections  of  EYLEA  /  VEGF  Trap-  Eye,  resulted  in  a  statistically  and  clinically 
significant  improvement  in  visual  acuity  in  patients  with  central  retinal  vein  occlusion  (CRVO) 
compared  with  those  receiving  sham  control  treatment  in  phase  III  GALILEO  and  COPERNICUS

clinical  trials.  In  both  studies,  VEGF  Trap-Eye  was  shown  to  be  superior  to  sham  treatment  with 
regard  to  the  primary  efficacy  analysis,  ie,  the  proportion  of  subjects  gaining  15  or  more  ETDRS 
letters at Week 24 (FAS). To better reflect the results of the primary endpoint, the CHMP suggested 
amending  the  indication  to  “treatment  of  visual  impairment  due  to  macular  edema  secondary  to 
CRVO”. 
In  the  integrated  analysis,  the  primary  efficacy  assessment  used  a  pure  LOCF  approach  whereby 
discontinued  subjects  prior  to  Week  24  were  not  automatically  considered  to  be  failure/non-
responders. 
The proportion of subjects who gained at least 15 letters in BCVA at Week 24 was 60.37% in the 
VTE2Q4 group and 17.02% in the sham group for a difference between groups of 43.6% (95% CI 
=  34.6%  to  52.6%;  p<0.0001).  As  expected,  the  superiority  of  VEGF  Trap-Eye  treatment  over 
sham  when  administered  monthly  in  subjects  with  macular  edema  secondary  to  CRVO  was  also 
confirmed in the primary efficacy assessment of the integrated analysis in the FAS and in the PPS 
but  also  by  the  supportive  analyses  (considering  either  discontinued  subjects  before  Week  24 
judged as failures or considering discontinued subjects before Week 24 with < 5 injections judged 
as failures). 
The robustness of these results was confirmed in all sensitivity analyses performed on both the FAS 
and PPS analysis sets. 
Logistic  regression  modeling  for  the  probability  of  gaining  at  least  15  letters  in  BCVA  with 
treatment group, study, and baseline BCVA as fixed factors, yielded an odds ratio estimate of 7.87 
(95% CI: 4.65% to 13.32%) for the VTE2Q4 group versus the sham group.  In individual studies, 
similarly logistic regressions were favouring the VTE2Q4 group and yielded an odds ratio estimate 
of 5.38 (95% CI=2.68 to 10.8; p<0.0001 for GALILEO and of 10.656 (95% CI: 4.707 to 24.123, 
p<0.0001) for COPERNICUS. 
In  general,  results  of  the  subgroup  analyses  were  consistent  with  the  results  of  the  overall 
population,  even  though  several  of  the  subgroups  were  too  small  to  draw  any  meaningful 
conclusions. 
Historical indirect comparison to the results from the pivotal, sham-controlled CRUISE study which 
was the basis of ranibizumab registration shows consistency with the results  of COPERNICUS and 
GALILEO studies:  
At the 6-months primary endpoint, the percentage of patients who gained ≥15 letters in BCVA was 
47.7% (0.5 mg) in the ranibizumab groups and 16.9% in the sham group (difference in means vs 
Sham  +30.8%  for  the  0.5  mg  ranibizumab  group;  prespecified  secondary  endpoint;  p<0.0001) 
(Brown et al; 2010). 
3. 
Secondary efficacy variables:  
Four secondary variables were explored (change from baseline in BCVA score at Week 24, change 
from baseline in CRT at Week 24, progression to any  neovascularization at Week 24, and change 
from baseline in the NEI VFQ-25 total score at Week 24) 
Secondary analyses were conducted on the FAS and PPS analysis populations to test for superiority 
of  VEGF  Trap-Eye  treatment  over  sham  injection.  At  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  Week  24,  a 
hierarchical  sequence  of  statistical  hypothesis  testing  was  used  to  control  for  multiplicity  (to 
preserve an alpha size of 0.05). The hypothesis was tested only if all the previous null hypotheses 
in the sequence could be rejected. 
Subgroup analysis based on demographic and disease baseline characteristics were conducted.

Secondary Efficacy Variables – Results from Baseline to Week 24 (FAS/LOCF) 
GALILEO study - Secondary efficacy variables results from baseline to Week 24: 
Change in BCVA at Week 24 (ETDRS letter score):  
The LS mean ETDRS letter score in the FAS (based on the LOCF method and the LS mean change) 
increased by 17.7 letters in the VTE 2Q4 group and by 3.0 letters in the sham group. The adjusted 
difference  (VTE  2Q4  minus  sham;  14.7  letters)  between  groups  was  statistically  significant 
(p<0.0001) and was confirmed in the PPS and by all sensitivity analyses using observed values.  
Change in CRT at Week 24 (by OCT):  
Reductions  in  CRT  occurred  in  both  treatment  groups  and  the  adjusted  difference  between 
treatment  groups  (sham  -208.55  µm;  VTE  2Q4  -447.97  µm;  the  treatment  difference  of  -239.42 
µm)  was  statistically  significant  (p<0.0001).  These  results  were  confirmed  in  the  PPS  and  by  all 
sensitivity analyses using observed values. 
Progression to neovascularisation at Week 24 (% of subjects progressing to any NV): 
There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups in the proportion of 
subjects who developed any neovascularization (4.4% in the sham group vs 2.9% in the VTE 2Q4 
group).  
Of  the  three  subjects  treated  with  VTE2Q4  who  developed  any  neovascularization,  one  developed 
NVE and two developed anterior segment neovascularization.  
Of the three subjects treated with sham, two subjects developed NVE and one developed anterior 
segment neovascularization.  
No subject in either group developed NVD.  
Three subjects in the sham group and one subject in the VTE2Q4 group received PRP. 
Change  in  NEI  VFQ-25  total  score  at  Week  24  [NEI  VFQ-25  scores  range  from  0  (worse  possible 
state) to 100 (best possible state)]: 
Greater  improvement  in  the  mean  NEI  VFQ-25  total  score  was  seen  in  the  VTE  2Q4  group  (LS 
mean  change  of  4.5  points;  FAS/LOCF)  than  in  the  sham  group  (LS  mean  change  of  0.3  points); 
but this improvement was not clearly clinically relevant (ie increase ≥ 5 points). The results using 
the  PPS  also  showed  a  greater  quantitative  improvement  in  mean  scores  in  the  VTE  2Q4  group 
than sham. 
Neither group experienced a clinically meaningful change in the mean NEI VFQ-25 subscale scores 
for near activities and distance activities.  
Change  in  EQ-5D  total  score  at  Week  24  [range  from  -0.6  (worse  possible  state)  to  1.0  (best 
possible state)]: 
The VTE 2Q4 group experienced a mean improvement in EQ-5D scores (0.013 points; FAS/LOCF) 
while  the  sham  group  experienced  a  decrease  in  LS  mean  score  (-0.031  points).  Difference  in 
improvements in the EQ-5D scores between groups was not significant. 
In GALILEO, clinically and statistically significant differences in favour of VEGF Trap-Eye treatment 
compared  to  sham  treatment  were  seen  only  for  the  first  two  variables  (change  from  baseline  in 
BCVA score at Week 24 and change from baseline in CRT at Week 24).

The hypothesis testing was stopped after the proportion of subjects in GALILEO progressing to any 
NV showed lack of statistical significant differenc ebetween groups. This failure could be explained 
by the low numbers of subjects in both groups (3 in each group). 
The improvement observed in NEI VFQ-25 total score at Week 24 was not negligible but not highly 
clinically  significant  (ie  increase  of  about  4  points  and  neither  group  experienced  a  clinically 
meaningful  change  in  the  mean  NEI  VFQ-25  subscale  scores  for  near  activities  and  distance 
activities. 
COPERNICUS Study - Secondary efficacy variables results from baseline to Week 24: 
Change in BCVA at Week 24 (ETDRS letter score):  
The  mean  ETDRS  letter  score  increased  in  the  VEGF  Trap-Eye  2Q4  group  (17.3  letters)  and 
decreased  (-4.0  letters)  in  the  sham  group.  The  adjusted  difference  (VTE  2Q4  minus  sham;  21.8 
letters) between groups was statistically significant (p<0.0001) and was confirmed in the PPS and 
by all sensitivity analyses using observed values.  
Change in CRT at Week 24 (by OCT):  
Reductions  in  CRT  occurred  in  both  dose  groups;  however  the  magnitude  of  the  decrease  in  the 
VEGF  Trap-Eye  2Q4  group  greatly  exceeded  that  in  the  sham  group  (mean  decrease  -457.2  μm 
versus  
-144.8  μm,  respectively);  the  treatment  difference  of  -313.25  µm)  was  statistically  significant 
(p<0.0001). 
The analysis performed in the PPS showed consistency with the analysis conducted in the FAS as all 
sensitivity analyses. 
Progression to neovascularisation at Week 24 (% of subjects progressing to any NV): 
There was a statistically significant difference between the VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4 and sham groups in 
the  proportion  of  subjects  who  developed  any  neovascularization  (0  subjects  versus  5  [6.8%] 
subjects,  respectively,  p=0.0059).  All 
five  sham  subjects  developed  anterior  segment 
neovascularization, and four received PRP. 
In the COPERNICUS study, all subjects who experienced a progression to neovascularization did so 
before Week 24. 
The analysis performed in the PPS showed consistency with the analysis conducted in the FAS 
Change  in  NEI  VFQ-25  total  score  at  Week  24  [NEI  VFQ-25  scores  range  from  0  (worse  possible 
state) to 100 (best possible state)]: 
A clinically relevant improvement in the mean NEI VFQ-25 total score (ie increase ≥ 5 points) was 
seen  in  the  VEGF  Trap-Eye  2Q4  group  (mean  change  7.2)  compared  to  the  sham  group  (mean 
change 0.8).  
Clinically  relevant  improvements  were  seen  in  the  mean  NEI  VFQ-25  subscale  scores  (near 
activities, distance activities, and vision dependency) compared to the sham group. 
In  COPERNICUS,  clinically  and  statistically  significant  differences  in  favour  of  VEGF  Trap-Eye 
treatment  compared  with  sham  were  seen  for  all  four  secondary  variables,  supporting  the 
conclusion drawn from the primary variable that treatment with 2.0 mg VEGF Trap-Eye once every 
4 weeks is superior to sham treatment. 
These results are highly consistent with the primary analysis of secondary criteria. 
For  all  secondary  criteria,  analyses  performed  in  the  PPS  as  all  sensitivity  analyses  performed 
showed consistency with analyses performed in the FAS. 
Integrated analysis from baseline to Week 24 
Change in BCVA at Week 24 (ETDRS letter score):  
A  similar  trend  of  results  favouring  the  VTE2Q4  group  over  the  Sham  was  observed  in  the 
integrated analysis for either Change in BCVA at Week 24 (ETDRS letter score) or Change in CRT at 
Week 24 (by OCT) or Change in NEI VFQ-25 total score at Week 24.These results were confirmed 
in  all  sensitivity  analyses  (ie  PPS  (LOCF)  or  FAS  and  PPS  using  observed  values)  that  showed 
similar tendency that for the FAS (LOCF). 
The  VTE2Q4  treatment  group  experienced  an  improvement  in  ETDRS  letter  score  than  began  by 
Week  4  and  continued  over  the  course  of  treatment  up  to  Week  24.  The  difference  in  BCVA 
between the VEGF Trap-Eye group and sham group was 18.26 (LS mean; 95% CI = 15.30 to 21.23, 
p<0.0001).

In the integrated analysis, the proportion of subjects gaining 30 or more letters from baseline was 
higher  in  the  VTE2Q4  treatment  group  (15.2%)  than  in  the  sham  group  (1.4%)  at  Week  24,  as 
were the proportions of subjects gaining 15, 10, or 0 or more letters from baseline to Week 24. 
No  loss  ≥  30  letters  was  observed  in  the  VTE2Q4  treatment  group  while  6.4%  of  subjects  in  the 
sham had loss ≥ 30 letters at Week 24. Loss ≥ 15 letters was observed in 1.5% of subjects in the 
VTE2Q4 treatment group while 14.4% of subjects in the sham had loss ≥ 15 letters at Week 24. 
Change in BCVA from baseline to Week 24 
Historical indirect comparison to the results from the pivotal, sham-controlled CRUISE study which 
was the basis of ranibizumab registration shows similar results:  
At  the  6-months  primary  endpoint,  mean  change  from  baseline  in  best  corrected  visual  acuity 
(BCVA)  letter  score  was  +14.9  letters  in  the  0.5  mg  ranibizumab  groups  and  +0.8  in  the  sham 
group (difference in means vs Sham +14.1 letters for the 0.5 mg ranibizumab group; p<0.0001).  
Change in CRT at Week 24 (by OCT):  
Mean  CRT  values  were  similar  between  treatment  groups  at  baseline  (672.0  µm  in  the  VTE2Q4 
group  and  655.7  µm  in  the  sham  group/FAS).  The  VTE2Q4  treatment  group  experienced  a 
reduction in CRT than began by Week 4 and continued over the course of treatment up to Week 24.  
The  magnitude  of  the  decrease  in  the  VTE2Q4  group  greatly  exceeded  that  in  the  sham  group 
(mean decrease 453.06 µm [LS mean decrease 455.01 µm] versus mean decrease 157.22 microns 
[LS mean decrease 177.31 µm], respectively).  
The  difference  (LS  mean)  in  CRT  reduction  between  the  VTE2Q4  group  and  sham  group  was 
277.70 µm (95% CI = -313.81 to -241.59, p<0.0001).

Progression to neovascularisation at Week 24 (% of subjects progressing to any NV): 
Difference between the VTE2Q4 group and sham group in the proportion of subjects who developed 
any neovascularization was as follows: (3 [1.4%] VTE2Q4 subjects versus 8 [5.7%] sham subjects, 
p=0.0250).  According  to  the  applicant  these  results  must  be  interpreted  with  caution  because  of 
the small number of subjects who developed any neovascularization overall and in each individual 
Phase-3 study and due to the differences in methodology for collecting these data in the GALILEO 
and COPERNICUS studies. 
Five  of  the  subjects  in  the  sham  group  who  developed  any  neovascularization  were  from  the 
COPERNICUS  study.  The  other  three  subjects  in  the  sham  group  and  the  three  subjects  in  the 
VTE2Q4 group who developed any neovascularization were from the GALILEO study. 
In the PPS, three (2.7%) subjects in the sham group and two (1.0%) subjects in the VTE2Q4 group 
developed any neovascularization during the first 24 weeks of the study.  
Change  in  NEI  VFQ-25  total  score  at  Week  24  [NEI  VFQ-25  scores  range  from  0  (worse  possible 
state) to 100 (best possible state)]: 
The  VTE2Q4  treatment  group  experienced  a  clinically  relevant  improvement  from  baseline  in  NEI 
VFQ-25 total score at Week 24 while this was not observed in the sham group (ie mean change of 
7.31  points;  LS  mean  change  of  6.60  points  vs  mean  change  of  2.22  points;  LS  mean  change  of 
1.28 points). The difference in NEI VFQ-25 total score between groups was 5.31 (LS mean; 95% CI 
=  3.23  to  7.40,  p<0.0001).  Clinical  relevance  was  considered  for  an  improvement  of  at  least  5 
points. 
At  Week-24,  both  Phase-3  studies  (GALILEO  and  COPERNICUS)  met  the  primary  endpoint.  The 
integrated  analysis  provided  similar  results.  The  proportions  of  subjects  who  gained  vision  (≥15 
letters)  in  the  VEGF  Trap-Eye  groups  were  60.19%  and  57.89%  in  GALILEO  and  COPERNICUS 
studies,  respectively,  which  was  statistically  significantly  superior  to  the  respective  proportions  in 
the  sham  group  (22.06%  and  12.33%)  with  a  difference  between  groups  of  38.3%  and  45.4%, 
respectively (P<0.0001).  
This highly significant superiority at week 24 of monthly injections of VEGF Trap-Eye over the sham 
groups  was  confirmed  in  the  analyses  in  the  PPS,  in  all  sensitivity  analyses,  and  in  most  of  the 
subgroup analyses. 
The  results  of  integrated  analysis  in  the  FAS  showed  a  similar  trend  and  was  verified  by  several 
approaches  of  handling  discontinued  subjects/missing  data,  including  those  that  were  used  as 
primary  analyses  in  individual  studies  (sensitivity  analyses).  The  MAH  has  appropriately  justified 
the use of LOCF to impute missing data. 
The  secondary  analyses  were  conducted  to  test  for  superiority  of  VEGF  Trap-Eye  treatment  over 
sham  injection,  at  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  Week  24.  A  hierarchical  sequence  of  statistical 
hypothesis  testing  was  used  to  control  for  multiplicity  (to  preserve  an  alpha  size  of  0.05).  The 
hypothesis was tested only if all the previous null hypotheses in the sequence could be rejected. 
In GALILEO, clinically and statistically significant differences in favour of VEGF Trap-Eye treatment 
compared  to  sham  treatment  were  seen  only  for  the  first  two  variables  (change  from  baseline  in 
BCVA score at Week 24 and change  from baseline in  CRT at Week 24), therefore, the  hypothesis 
testing  was  stopped  after  the  proportion  of  subjects  in  GALILEO  progressing  to  any 
neovascularisation  showed  a  lack  of  statistical  significant  difference  between  groups.  On  the 
contrary, in COPERNICUS  study, all tests were significantly in favour of VEGF Trap-Eye treatment 
compared to sham treatment. 
In  the  first  24  weeks,  when  subjects  are  treated  with  the  fixed  monthly  dosing  regimen,  VEGF 
Trap-Eye  treatment  lead  to  a  rapid  improvement  in  BCVA  that  was  seen  as  early  as  the  first 
assessment (Week 4). Mean change in BCVA values improves with VEGF Trap-Eye treatment with a 
gain of about 18 letters over baseline by the end of first 24-week treatment period. In this phase of 
the studies, improvements in VA coincided with consistent and rapid responses in morphology (CRT 
as assessed by OCT) which were also maintained through Week 24. 
Nevertheless, numeric differences between studies in baseline BCVA values were observed and the 
behaviour of the Sham group was different betweeen studies, suggesting that less severe patients 
were  recruited  in  GALILEO  study.  The  applicant  considers  that  this  can  be  due  to  the  fact  that 
patients in GALILEO study the sham group should continue to receive only sham injections during 
one  year  while  in  COPERNICUS  study,  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  were  eligible  to  receive 
according to protocol-defined retreatment criteria VEGF Trap-Eye 2 mg IVT. 
Improvements in vision from baseline were very similar between studies: 
In GALILEO study, Patients treated with EYLEA / VEGF Trap-Eye gained a mean 18 letters of visual 
acuity,  compared  with  a  mean  gain  of  3.3  letters  in  those  receiving  sham  injection,  the  adjusted 
Eylea

difference  between  treatment  groups  was  clinically  and  statistically  significant:14.7  letters; 
p<0.0001).  
Reductions  in  CRT  occurred  in  both  treatment  groups  (sham  -208.55  µm;  VTE  2Q4  -447.97  µm; 
adjusted difference between treatment groups -239.42 µm; p<0.0001).  
In  COPERNICUS,  treated  patients  gained  a  mean  17.3  letters  of  visual  acuity,  compared  with  a 
mean loss of 4.0 letters in those receiving sham injections. The adjusted difference between groups 
was clinically and statistically significant (21.8 letters; p<0.0001).  
Reductions  in  CRT  occurred  in  both  treatment  groups;  however  the  magnitude  of  the  decrease in 
the VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4 group greatly exceeded that in the sham group (mean decrease -457.2 μm 
versus -144.8 μm, respectively, treatment difference :-313.25 µm; p<0.0001). 
The  proportion  of  subjects  progressing  to  any  neovascularizations  was  limited  in  both  studies.  In 
both  studies  and  in  both  groups,  at  baseline,  the  majority  of  subjects  had  a  perfusion  status  of 
perfused. At week 24, no patients were reported to progress to neovascularisation in COPERNICUS 
study  for  the  VTE  2Q4  group  while  in  GALILEO  study,  despites  the  fact  that  the  study  was 
conducted  in  a  less  severe  population  than  in  COPERNICUS  study,  three  subjects  treated  with 
VTE2Q4 developed neovascularisation.  
Clarifications regarding subjects progressing to any neovascularizations have been provided by the 
MAH through the responses provided to CHMP questions: 
i)  76  weeks  Galileo  results  showed  that  progression  to  any  neovascularizations  for  the  VTE2Q4 
group+PRN remained limited with only two cases undergoing PRP. i) The MAH has shown that the 
slight numeric imbalance at baseline observed between the Sham and  VTE 2Q4 groups for retinal 
perfusion status “perfused” (ie 79.4% vs 86.4%, respectively) has no significant implication on the 
results. 
ii) Based on the integrated analysis, difference between the VTE2Q4 group and sham group in the 
proportion of subjects who developed any neovascularization at week 24 was as follows: (3 [1.4%] 
VTE2Q4  subjects  versus  8  [5.7%]  sham  subjects,  p=0.0250).  According  to  the  applicant  these 
results  must  be  interpreted  with  caution  because  of  the  small  number  of  subjects  who  developed 
any  neovascularization  overall  and  in  each  individual  Phase-3  study  and  due  to  the  differences  in 
methodology for collecting these data in the GALILEO and COPERNICUS studies. 
Five  of  the  subjects  in  the  sham  group  who  developed  any  neovascularization  were  from  the 
COPERNICUS  study.  The  other  three  subjects  in  the  sham  group  and  the  three  subjects  in  the 
VTE2Q4 group who developed any neovascularization were from the GALILEO study. 
The  Applicant  has  provided  a  comprehensive  review  of  all  subjects  progressing 
neovascularisation in GALILEO study based on the overall duration of the study (76 weeks). 
to 
iii) In addition, explanations for the differences between the methods applied in GALILEO and in 
COPERNICUS studies for data collection of the subjects’ perfusion status have been provided. 
Statistically significant improvements in quality of life, as measured by the NEI VFQ-25 total scores, 
were seen in both studies for the VEGF Trap-Eye treatment groups. These were more impressive in 
COPERNICUS than in GALILEO study. In Galileo, neither group experienced a clinically meaningful 
change  in  the  mean  NEI  VFQ-25  subscale  scores  for  near  activities  and  distance  activities.  In  the 
other hand, all numeric results from both studies are favouring the active treatment. 
Difference in improvements in the EQ-5D scores between groups was not significant. This test was 
only  done  in  GALILEO  study.  The  MAH  clarified  that  this  test  remains  of  limited  interest  to  test 
vision. 
All  results  reported  for  the  secondary  variables  were  confirmed  in  the  PPS  and  in  the  number  of 
sensitivity analyses performed by the Applicant. 
This superiority was also confirmed by the integrated results of both studies for the four secondary 
variables  which  were  explored  (change  from  baseline  in  BCVA  score  at  Week  24,  change  from 
baseline in CRT at Week  24, progression to any neovascularization at Week  24, and change  from 
baseline in the NEI VFQ-25 total score at Week 24). 
In  both  studies,  with  respect  to  stratification  factors  (geographic  region  and  baseline  VA),  results 
were numerically better for VEGF Trap-Eye than for sham in all strata examined.  
Similar results were obtained from  the integrated analyses, which were stratified by baseline BCVA 
and study. 
The  results  of  the  subgroup  analyses  were  consistent  with  those  seen  in  the  overall  population, 
with subjects in the VEGF Trap-Eye treatment group performing better than sham in all evaluable

comparisons, with the majority of within-subgroup comparisons being significantly better in favour 
of VEGF Trap-Eye. 
Overall,  the  results  provided  for  primary  24-week  phase  of  both  studies  demonstrates  the 
superiority  of  monthly  fixed  injections  of  EYLEA  over  Sham  either  in  visual  criteria  or  in 
morphologic  criteria.  Quality  of  life  tends  to  also  improved.  There  were  few  progressions  to 
neovascularisation.  The  efficacy  results  were  significant  and  no  major  concern  was  reported  from 
the safety data.

Week-52, tertiary efficacy variables 
Week-52 phase, GALILEO study design: 
Subjects in the VEGF Trap-Eye group received monthly injections of 2 mg VEGF Trap-Eye from 
Day  1  through  Week  20.  Thereafter,  subjects  received  EYLEA/VEGF  Trap-Eye  as  often  as  every  4 
weeks  depending  on  the  study  retreatment  criteria  (with  possibility  of  a  sham  treatment  to 
maintain blinding) 
Subjects  in  the  Sham  group: Subjects who  were in the control group during the first 24-week 
phase received sham (ie, pretend) treatments every 4 weeks through Week 52.  
Week-52 phase, COPERNICUS study design 
Starting  at  Week-1  through  Week-24  (first  period  /primary  end  point),  according  to  the 
randomization, subjects received either 2 mg Eylea / VEGF Trap-Eye IVT or Sham (false IVT) every 
4 weeks (VTE2Q4) for 20 weeks.  
Starting at Week 24 and through Week 52, subjects were evaluated monthly and were eligible 
in both treatment groups to receive according to protocol-defined retreatment criteria, either VEGF 
Trap-Eye 2 mg IVT injections PRN or sham injections for 48 weeks.

Week-52 Baseline Disease Characteristics 
A difference in the mean BCVA of the two sham groups at Week 24 was observed, at the beginning 
of  the  active  treatment  course  for  sham  subjects  in  COPERNICUS  (54.3±20.2  letters  in  GALILEO

Categorized Gain and losses in BCVA at Week 52: 
In the integrated analysis, the proportion of subjects gaining 30 or more letters from baseline was 
higher in the VTE2Q4+PRN treatment group (17.51%) than in the sham+VTE PRN group (1.37%) 
at Week 52, as were the proportions of subjects gaining 15, 10, or 0 or more letters from baseline 
to Week 52 (LOCF, FAS). 
Proportion of Subjects Progressing to Any Neovascularization at Week 52 (FAS): 
Results  demonstrate  a  statiscally  and  clinically  significant  superiority  of  VTE2Q4+PRN  over  sham 
(GALILEO)  or  over  Sham+VTE  PRN  (COPERNICUS)  at  week  52  in  Proportion  of  Subjects  who 
Gained 15 or More Letters.  
At week 52, BCVA improvements in the treatment group VTE2Q4+PRN remained highly statistically 
and clinically significant compared to Sham (GALILEO) or to Sham+VTE PRN (COPERNICUS).  
However, some loss in BCVA (approximately 1 letter from the gains achieved at Week 24 in both 
individual studies) was observed in the VEGF Trap-Eye subjects in this second six month phase of 
studies. According to the Applicant this slight decrease in vision in the  VTE 2Q4 +PRN group would 
be highly correlated to the change in dosing regimen at week 24 through the planned switching of 
patients from a fixed monthly 2Q4 dosing (also called proactive) to a PRN as needed dosing (also 
called reactive) based on the study retreatment criteria.  
The  Applicant  moved  directly  into  the  phase  III  CRVO  studies  using  the  very  preliminary  dosing 
scheme  investigated  for  the  AMD  indication  in  mid-2008.  Therefore,  no  specific  approach  for  the 
treatment dosing scheme in CRVO patients was investigated. Subsequently, the one-year phase III 
AMD  clinical  results demonstrated  that,  after the  loading  phase  of  one  IVT  every  month  for  three 
months, the once every two months dosing schedule was non-inferior to a monthly dosing scheme.  
The  second  dosing  regimen  (ie  every  8  weeks,  after  a  three  months  loading  phase)  used  in  the 
AMD  VIEW  studies  issued  from  the  results  of  the  Phase-2  AMD  study  VGFT-OD-0508  (CLEAR-IT) 
was not tested in the CRVO clinical trial program. 
In  both  CRVO  studies,  treatment  was  administered  proactively  every  4  weeks  (2Q4)  for  six 
months.  After  6  months,  patients  received  treatment  only  if  they  met  pre-specified  retreatment 
criteria  (PRN),  except  for  patients  in  the  control  group  in  the  GALILEO  study  who  continued  to 
Eylea

receive sham (control to control) up to week 52. Nevertheless, a monthly monitoring was applied 
in both studies up to week 52. 
Although the initially proposed proactive Q8 regimen represented an “average” regimen that might 
have been suitable for many patients, the post-hoc analysis submitted by the MAH to support the 
bimonthly dosing schedule for long term treatment showed that there is a number of patients who 
may  benefit  from  more  administrations,  and  a  number  of  other  patients  for  whom  fewer 
administrations would be sufficient.  In both cases, the proposed proactive Q8 regimen may be less 
than optimal.  
Verification of the response at 3-month time-point is required. In this way, non-responders will not 
continue  receiving  treatment  after  an initial,  futile 3-month  course.  The  option  to  give  monthly 
treatment until visual and anatomic outcomes are stable for three monthly assessments will reduce 
the probability of under treating patients who would still benefit from monthly injections (including 
covering  those          who  still  gain  benefit  after  3  months  -  see  further  in  the  assessment).  When 
stability is reached, treatment may be discontinued or continued with extended scheduled intervals. 
Therefore the CHMP recommended that the posology should be the following: 
The recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg aflibercept equivalent to 50 microlitres.  
After  the  initial  injection,  treatment  is  given  monthly.  The  interval  between  two  doses  should  not 
be shorter than one month.  
If  there  is  no  improvement  in  visual  and  anatomic  outcomes  over  the  course  of  the  first  three 
injections, continued treatment is not recommended.   
Monthly  treatment  continues  until  visual  and  anatomic  outcomes  are  stable  for  three  monthly 
assessments. Thereafter the need for continued treatment should be reconsidered.  
If  necessary,  treatment  may  be  continued  with  gradually  increasing  treatment  intervals  while 
maintaining  visual  and  anatomic  response.  If  treatment  has  been  discontinued,  visual  and 
anatomic outcomes should be monitored and treatment should be resumed if these deteriorate. 
Usually,  monitoring  should  be  done  at  the  injection  visits.  During  treatment  interval  extension 
through  to  completion  of  therapy,  the  monitoring  schedule  should  be  determined  by  the  treating 
physician based on the individual patient’s response and may be more frequent than the schedule 
of injections.  
As  expected,  in  COPERNICUS  subjects  switching  to  active  treatment  at  Week  24,  BCVA  increased 
slightly but remained limited with a gain of about 4 letters over baseline.  
By  Week  52,  these  subjects  experienced  a  mean  increase  of  3.8±17.1  letters,  which  was  no 
different from the increase seen in the sham subjects of the GALILEO study (3.8±18.1). This could 
be  explained  by  the  difference  observed  in  the  mean  BCVA  of  the  two  sham  groups  at  the 
beginning of the active treatment course for sham  subjects in COPERNICUS (54.3±20.2 letters in 
GALILEO compared to 44.8±23.8 letters in COPERNICUS). 
Change From Baseline in CRT: 
In  the  individual  studies,  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  the  reduction  in  CRT  in  favour  of 
VEGF  Trap-Eye  over  sham  was  seen  in  GALILEO,  where  sham  subjects  received  only  sham 
treatment  through  Week  52,  but  not  in  COPERNICUS,  where  sham  subjects  switched  to  active 
treatment at Week 24. 
Proportion of Subjects Progressing to Any Neovascularization: 
In the COPERNICUS study, all subjects (sham 6.8%; VTE2Q4 0%) who experienced a progression 
to neovascularization did so before Week 24. 
In line with the 24 weeks results, the second part of the question raised about the progression to 
neovascularisation in GALILEO for VTE2Q4+PRN group, is described below:  
In  GALILEO,  a  total  of  six  subjects  in  each  treatment  group  (sham  8.8%;  VTE2Q4+PRN  5.8%) 
progressed to neovascularization by the end of the 52 weeks of the study (three in each treatment 
group  before  Week  24  and  three  in  each  treatment  group  between  Week  24  and  Week  52).  A 
Kaplan-Meier estimate for time to first neovascularization (from baseline) showed that subjects in 
the sham group had developed neovascularization by Day 85 (i.e., within the first 24 weeks), while 
subjects in the VTE2Q4+PRN group had developed neovascularizations only by Day 240 (i.e., once 
they were moved to a reactive PRN treatment regimen) (p = 0.3336).

The  Applicant  has  further  provided  as  clarification  a  comprehensive  review  of  all  subjects 
progressing  to  neovascularisation  in  GALILEO  study  through  the  overall  duration  of  the  study  (76 
weeks). These results suggest that an earlier initiation of treatment with a monthly dosing regimen 
may  contribute  efficiently  to  the  long  term  efficacy  of  VEGF  Trap-Eye  in  the  treatment  of  CRVO, 
even with a switching to a PRN regimen.

GALILEO Study: Overview of Analyses of Efficacy Endpoints through Week 76 (FAS) 
Starting  at  week  52,  all  subjects  were  eligible  to  continue  in  a  6-month  PRN  extension  and  to 
receive  2  mg  VEGF  Trap-Eye  injections  according  to  the  protocol  retreatment  criteria  or  more 
frequently  (monthly)  if  required  according  to  the  investigators’  opinion.  The  visit  interval  was 
extended from monthly to every 8 weeks.  
Proportion  of  Subjects  Who  Gained  at  Least  15  Letters  in  BCVA  From  Baseline  at  Week 
76 (LOCF; FAS): 
Results suggested the superiority of VTE2Q4+PRN over sham+VTE PRN and all analyses showed a 
similar trend. 
-A  logistic  regression  modeling  for  the  probability  of  gaining  at  least  15  letters  from  baseline  at 
Week  76,  considering  treatment,  region,  and  baseline  BCVA  category  as  fixed  factors,  yielded  an 
OR estimate of 3.27 (95% CI = 1.70, 6.30) for VTE2Q4+PRN vs sham+VTE PRN. 
-When other predictive factors (ie baseline perfusion status and duration of disease) are added as 
fixed factors, the analysis yielded similar results [an OR estimate of 3.06 (95% CI = 1.57, 5.95; p 
= 0.0010) for VTE2Q4+PRN versus sham+VTE PRN].

Subjects  with  Vision  Gains  and  Losses  Compared  with  Baseline  Using  the  ETDRS  Letter 
Score by Visit (LOCF; FAS) 
In all categories of vision gain, more subjects in the VTE2Q4+PRN group experienced Vision gains 
compared  with  baseline  than  did  subjects  treated  with  sham+VTE  PRN.  The  table  of  vision  gains 
showed clearly the tendency of decreased vision from Week 24.   
The percentage of subjects with vision loss < 10 or < 15 letters remained fairly stable up to Week 
52 for the VTE2Q4+PRN group.

Proportion of Subjects Developing Neovascularization by Week 76 (FAS) 
Eight of the subjects developing any neovascularization had a baseline perfusion status of perfused 
(sham+VTE PRN n=3; VTE2Q4+PRN n=5) and six had a baseline perfusion status of non perfused 
(sham+VTE  PRN  n=3;  VTE2Q4+PRN  n=3).  The  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  for  time  to  first 
neovascularization  (from  baseline)  showed  that  5%  of  subjects  in  the  sham+VTE  PRN  group  had 
developed  neovascularization  by  Day  85,  while  5%  of  subjects  in  the  VTE2Q4+PRN  group  had 
developed neovascularizations only by Day 240 (FAS; log-rank p value = 0.6815).

Change in total NEI-VFQ-25 score and NEI VFQ-25 near-activities sub-scores at Week 76 
(FAS/LOCF) 
Unadjusted mean changes from baseline increased > 4 points in both groups for the total NEI-VFQ-
25 score or the NEI VFQ-25 near-activities sub-scores with greater improvements observed in the 
VTE2Q4+PRN group vs sham+VTE PRN group. 
Change in EQ-5D score from baseline at Week 76 
Mean EQ-5D scores remained unchanged from baseline at Week 76 
In  the  GALILEO  study,  in  the  VEGF  Trap-  Eye  2Q4+PRN  group  there  was  a  tendency  towards 
deterioration of vision and central retinal thickness throughout the Week 52 – 76 follow up period. 
At  Week  76,  the  mean  gain  of  approximately  14  letters  above  baseline  for  subjects  in  the 
VTE2Q4+PRN group represented a loss of approximately 3 letters from Week 52 and 4 letters from 
Week 24. 
No  improvement  in  BCVA  was  reported  in  the  Sham+PRN  group  with  the  beginning  of  the  active 
PRN treatment.  
COPERNICUS Study: Overview of Analyses of Efficacy Endpoints through Week 100 (Full 
Analysis Set) 
Starting at week 52, all subjects were eligible to continue in a 1-year PRN extension and to receive 
2  mg  VEGF  Trap-Eye  injections  according  to  the  protocol  retreatment  criteria  or  more  frequently 
(monthly) if required according to the investigators’ opinion. The visit interval was extended from 
monthly to quarterly.  
[1] Adjusted difference (%), VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4+PRN minus Sham+PRN and associated 95% CI were calculated 
using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel weighting scheme adjusted by regions (North America vs. Rest of World) and baseline BCVA (BCVA >20/200 and 
BCVA ≤20/200). 
[2] Point estimate and 95% CI and p-value are based on treatment difference (VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4+PRN minus Sham+PRN) of the LS mean changes 
using an ANCOVA model with treatment group, region and baseline BCVA (BCVA >20/200 and BCVA ≤20/200) as fixed factors. These p-values were 
provided for descriptive (exploratory) purposes only.

[3] P-value was calculated using a 2-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted by regions (North America vs. Rest of World) and baseline BCVA 
(BCVA >20/200 and BCVA ≤20/200). These p-values were provided for descriptive (exploratory) purposes only. 
Proportion of subjects with ≥ 15-letter vision gain at Week 100:  
The difference between the VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4+PRN and Sham+PRN groups was 25.8% (adjusted 
difference  26.7%  [95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  =  13.1%  to  40.3%]).  Therefore,  the  VEGF  Trap-
Eye 2Q4+PRN group continued to do better than the Sham+PRN group at week 100.  
For comparison with previous endpoints, 56.1%, 55.3% and 49.1% of subjects gained ≥15 letters 
at  week  24,  52  and  100  in  the  VEGF  Trap-Eye  2Q4+PRN  group.  Thus,  a  treatment  effect  seems 
maintained  with  a  slight  tendency  towards  deterioration  over  the  Week  52  –  Week  100  follow  up 
period.  
Mean change from Baseline in BCVA Score at Week 100:  
The  difference  in  BCVA  between  the  VEGF  Trap-  Eye  2Q4+PRN  and  Sham+PRN  groups  by 
treatment,  adjusted  by  region  and  baseline  BCVA,  were  11.81  (LS  mean)  (95%  CI  =  6.65  to 
16.79). For comparison with previous endpoints, the mean change was 17.3, 16.2 and 13 letters, 
at  Week  24,  52  and  100,  respectively  showing  a  slight  tendency  to  decrease  at  Week  52  and  a 
more prononced decrease from Week 52 to Week 100. From Week 24 through Week 100, the VEGF 
Trap-Eye+PRN group lost -4.3 letters. 
In the sham+PRN group, the mean change was - 4, 3.8 and 1.5 letters, at Week 24, 52 and 100, 
respectively. Therefore, only slight improvements were observed through 24-52 weeks period that 
decreased through the 52-100 period. 
Although the vision in the Sham+PRN group tended to improve after Week 24 with the beginning 
of  the  PRN  treatment,  as  expected,  the  percentages  of  patients  with  vision  gains  by  categories 
(from ≥ 0 to ≥ 15) were higher in the VEGF Trap- Eye 2Q4+PRN.  
Mean changes from baseline in CRT at Week 100:  
For comparison with previous endpoints, the mean difference in CRT between the VEGF Trap- Eye 
2Q4+PRN  and  Sham+PRN  groups  were  -311.9,  -28.44  and  -44.63  µm,  at  Week  24,  52  and  100,

respectively. Nevertheless, in the Sham+PRN group (who received the active treatment after week 
24)  the  meaningful  improvement  in  CRT  reductions  did  not  translate  to  a  comparable  clinical 
improvement in visual function. 
Proportion of Subjects with Dry Status, as Assessed by OCT, in Retinal Fluid at Week 100 (LOCF) 
by Treatment Group (Full Analysis Set): 
The proportion of subjects with dry status in retinal fluid, as assessed by OCT, was greater in the 
VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4+PRN  group than in the Sham+PRN group  at all post-baseline time points. At 
week  100,  the  difference  in  proportion  of  subjects  with  dry  status  in  retinal  fluid,  as  assessed  by 
OCT,  between  the  VEGF  Trap-Eye  2Q4+PRN  and  Sham+PRN  groups  was  11.4  (95%  CI  =  -2.2  to 
25.0) 
Perfusion Status at Week 100: 
Among  the  subjects  with  a  measured  perfusion  status  at  weeks  12,  24,  36,  52,  and  100,  more 
subjects  in  the  VEGF  Trap-Eye  2Q4+PRN  group  (66.7%  to  81.6%)  were  classified  as  perfused 
compared to the Sham+PRN group (46.6% to 64.4%).  
Proportion  of  Subjects  Progressing  to  Any  of  the  Following:  Anterior  Segment  Neovascularization, 
Neovascularization of the Optic Disc, or Neovascularization of the Retina Elsewhere at Week 100: 
Total NEI VFQ-25 Scores at Week 100: 
Clinically  relevant  improvements  in  the  NEI  VFQ-25  total  score  were  observed  in  the  Sham+PRN 
group after Week 24, while the greater improvement in the VEGF Trap- Eye 2Q4+PRN group was 
maintained throughout the study.

Notes 
For primary endpoint evaluation, discontinued subjects before week 24 were 
considered as non ≥15 letter gainers. 
After successful primary efficacy evaluation, a hierarchical test procedure with a pre-
specified order had been used with regard to testing secondary efficacy endpoints. 
* Hierarchical testing procedure could not reject the null-hypothesis of no treatment 
effect for the secondary endpoint related to neovascularizations 
** Resulting from the non-rejection of the secondary endpoint related to 
neovascularizations, secondary endpoints for NEI-VFQ-25 and EQ-5D were not tested 
in a confirmatory sense, but can only be considered as evaluated in an exploratory 
sense. 
^ With regard to CRT, change from baseline change from baseline could be 
calculated for 67 subjects in Sham and 103 subjects in VEGF Trap Eye 2mg group. 
^^ With regard to NEI VFQ 25, change from baseline change from baseline could be 
calculated for 65 subjects in Sham and 96 subjects in VEGF Trap Eye 2mg group. 
^^^ With regard to EQ-5D, change from change from baseline could be calculated 
for 64 subjects in Sham and 95 subjects in VEGF Trap Eye 2mg group.

Notes 
For primary endpoint evaluation, discontinued subjects before week 24 were 
considered as non ≥15 letter gainers, if they had less than 5 injections (LOCF 
otherwise). 
After successful primary efficacy evaluation, a hierarchical test procedure with a pre-
specified order had been used with regard to testing secondary efficacy endpoints. 
All secondary endpoints showed statistical significant results. 
^ With regard to CRT, change from baseline change from baseline could be 
calculated for 65 subjects in Sham and 112 subjects in VEGF Trap Eye 2mg group. 
^^ With regard to NEI VFQ 25, change from baseline change from baseline could be 
calculated for 59 subjects in Sham and 104 subjects in VEGF Trap Eye 2mg group.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Since the 22nd November 2012, Eylea (Aflibercept) has been approved in the EU for the treatment 
of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in adults. The scope of the present 
type  II  variation  is  to  extend  the  therapeutic  indication  to  the  treatment  of  macular  edema 
following central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) using a specific dosing regimen, different from that 
registered for wet AMD. 
Two clinical studies (GALILEO & COPERNICUS) were conducted as support to this claim. 
A  nearly  identical  design  was  used  for  the  first  six  months  phase  of  each  study.  However,  after 
week 24, both studies were carried out with distinct designs for the additional 6-months treatment 
phase and for the long term follow-up periods.  
Both studies were randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled, using a ratio of 3:2 (VEGF Trap-
Eye: sham), with stratification by geographic region (Europe vs Asia-Pacific in GALILEO and North 
America vs Rest of World in COPERNICUS) and baseline BCVA (> 20/200 vs ≤ 20/200). A total of 
240  and  273  subjects,  respectively  received  proactive,  monthly  injections  of  either  2  mg  Eylea 
(VTE2Q4) or sham injections for 20 weeks.  
Both studies were designed to primarily  demonstrate  the  superiority of  Eylea (VTE2Q4) over 
sham  injections  on  the  best-corrected  visual  acuity  (BCVA)  assessed  by  the  ETDRS  chart  in 
subjects with macular edema secondary to CRVO.  
The  sham  control  was  chosen  to  represent  the  standard  of  care  at  the  time  of  the  initial  CRVO 
clinical  development  program  (i.e.  observation  until  clinical  progression  and  then  pan-retinal 
photocoagulation as needed if neovascularization developed). 
Secondary  objectives  Week  24  also  included  an  assessment  of  the  evolution  of  anatomic 
features  to  test  for  superiority  of  VTE2Q4  treatment  to  sham  using  a  hierarchical  sequence  of 
statistical hypotheses testing in order to control for multiplicity as follows: 
1)  Change  in  BCVA  letter  score;  2)  in  CRT;  3)  proportion  of  subjects  progressing  to  any 
neovascularisation;  4)  change  in  total  NEI  VFQ-25  score  and  change  in  EQ-5D  score  for  GALILEO 
only.  
Additional  specific  PK  data  in  CRVO  subjects  were  assessed  in  GALILEO.  The  results  show  a  low 
systemic exposure in CRVO patients consistent with that observed in AMD patients.  
The patient population was overall balanced between individual studies with the exception of race 
which  reflects  the  regions  of  world  where  studies  have  been  conducted.  Nevertheless,  some 
numeric  differences  observed  between  studies  on  baseline  ETDRS  scores,  CRT  or  percentage  of 
perfused  status  suggested  that  GALILEO  patients’  population  was  recruited  with  a  lower  disease 
severity than in COPERNICUS study.  
Compliance  with  the  treatment  regimen  was  good  in  both  studies  as  in  both  treatment  groups, 
with  >  80%  and  90%  of  all  subjects  completing  the  planned  24-week  treatment  period,  for 
GALILEO and COPERNICUS, respectively.

In both CRVO studies, the primary  efficacy  analysis  was set at  week  24  and analyzed in the 
Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS).  The  FAS  comprised  171  and  187  subjects  in  GALILEO  and  COPERNICUS, 
respectively while the PPS comprised respectively, 138 and 168 subjects.  
The  Applicant  moved  directly  into  the  phase  III  CRVO  studies  using  the  very  preliminary  dosing 
scheme  investigated  for  the  AMD  indication  in  mid-2008.  Therefore,  no  specific  approach  for  the 
treatment dosing scheme in CRVO patients was investigated.  
In  both  CRVO  studies,  treatment  was  administered  proactively  every  4  weeks  (2Q4)  for  six 
months.  After  6  months,  patients  received  treatment  only  if  they  met  pre-specified  retreatment 
criteria  (PRN),  except  for  patients  in  the  control  group  in  the  GALILEO  study  who  continued  to 
receive sham (control to control) up to week 52. Nevertheless, a monthly monitoring was applied 
in both studies up to week 52. 
Although the initially proposed proactive Q8 regimen represented an “average” regimen that might 
have been suitable for many patients, the post-hoc analysis submitted by the MAH to support the 
bimonthly dosing schedule for long term treatment showed that there is a number of patients who 
may  benefit  from  more  administrations,  and  a  number  of  other  patients  for  whom  fewer 
administrations  would  be  sufficient.    In  both  cases,  the  initially  proposed  proactive  Q8  regimen 
might  have  been  less  than  optimal.  Individual  and  integrated  analyses  of  both  studies  show  that 
the plateau of the effect has been achieved at around 3 month , but there is approximately 15% of 
subjects gaining further improvement during subsequent monthly injections.   
Verification of the clinical response at 3-month time-point was therefore required by CHMP. In this 
way, non-responders will not continue receiving treatment after an initial, futile 3-month course.  
If  the  clinician  decides  to  continue  treatment,  the  patient  should  receive  monthly  injections  until 
visual  and  anatomic  outcomes  are  stable  for  three  monthly  assessments.  This  will  reduce  the 
probability of under treating patients who would still benefit from monthly injections (including the 
15%  who  still  gain  benefit  after  3  months).  When  stability  is  reached,  treatment  may  be 
discontinued  or  continued  with  longer  intervals.  In  case  of  deterioration,  treatment  should  be 
resumed. 
Efficacy data analyses 
Weeks 0-24: 
At Week-24, both Phase-3 studies (GALILEO and COPERNICUS) met the primary endpoint.  
In both studies, Eylea administered monthly (VTE 2Q4) was shown to be superior over the sham in 
the proportion of subjects gaining 15 or more ETDRS letters,  
i) GALILEO [CMH adjusted difference 38.9% (95% CI=22.7 to 55.0%; p <0.0001];  
ii)  COPERNICUS  [difference  46.7%;  Adjusted  Difference  (95%  CI)  47.4  %  (35.2,  59.5);  P 
<0.0001].  
Analyses conducted on PPS population showed similarly the superiority of VTE2Q4 over sham: 
i) GALILEO [CMH adjusted difference 38.9% (95% CI=22.7 to 55.0%; p <0.0001)], 
ii)  COPERNICUS  [difference  46.7%;  Adjusted  Difference  (95%  CI)  47.4  %  (35.2,  59.5);  P 
<0.0001].  
All sensitivity analyses confirmed the superiority of Eylea 2Q4 over Sham.  
Consistency was observed between the prespecified demographic subgroups and the overall CRVO 
population studied. 
Moreover, when indirectly comparing the responders’ rate with Eylea to the results from the pivotal, 
sham-controlled  CRUISE  study  which  was  the  basis  of  ranibizumab  extension  file  to  CRVO,  the 
percentage of subjects gaining ≥15 letters in the integrated sham group of CRVO program (17.0%) 
was close to what observed in CRUISE study (16.9%) and this percentage was numerically higher 
in the integrated VTE2Q4 group compared to ranibizumab (60.4% vs 47.7%). 
The results of integrated analysis in the FAS showed a similar trend than in individual studies.  
Secondary analyses were conducted to test for superiority of VEGF Trap-Eye treatment over sham 
injection, at the primary efficacy endpoint, Week 24. 
Highly  significant  results  favouring  the  VTE2Q4  group  over  the  Sham  were  observed  in 
COPERNICUS and in GALILEO studies, for the changes in BCVA letter score and in CRT.  
In COPERNICUS, the two other secondary criteria favoured significantly the VTE2Q4 group over the 
Sham  while  in  GALILEO,  there  was  a  lack  of  significance  for  the  difference  between  proportion  of 
patients  progressing  to  neovascularisation  (2.9%  vs  4.4%  in  the  VTE2Q4  and  sham  groups, 
respectively;  p=0.5947).  In  COPERNICUS  these  figures  were,  0  subjects  in  the  VTE2Q4  versus  5

(6.8%)  subjects  in  the  sham  group;  p=0.0059.  Thus,  while  GALILEO  patients  were  apparently 
recruited  with  a  less  severe  level  of  disease,  the  percentage  of  patients  progressing  to 
neovascularisation  was  higher  than  in  COPERNICUS.  On  the  other  hand,  only  few  subjects 
diagnosed to have newly developed NV underwent PRP treatment. 
These results were overall consistent between studies at week 24. The only differences seen were 
as follows: 
Whilst  Copernicus  study  showed  robust  statistical  significance  across  all  visual,  anatomical  and 
functional  endpoints  by  week  24,  and  favourable  changes  in  distance  subscores  and  dependency 
subscores, Galileo study failed to show the difference in the proportion of subjects who developed 
neovascularisation,  in  terms  of  quality  of  life  improvements  as  measured  by  EQ-5D  questionnaire 
(the  latter  has  not  been  utilized  in  Copernicus  study)  and  changes  in  distance  activity  and 
dependency subscores.  
In  the  first  24  weeks,  when  subjects  are  treated  with the  fixed  monthly  dosing  regimen,  VTE2Q4 
treatment led to a rapid improvement in BCVA with a plateau effect achieved at around 3 month. 
Improvements  in  vision  from  baseline  were  very  similar  for  VTE2Q4  group  between  studies, 
patients  gaining  from  baseline  around  17-18  letters.  Consistent  and  significant  decreases  in  CRT 
were  achieved  in  both  studies  for  VTE2Q4  group.  Nevertheless,  numeric  differences  between 
studies in baseline BCVA values were observed and the behaviour of the Sham group was different 
betweeen studies, suggesting that less severe patients were recruited in GALILEO study.  
Statistically significant improvements in the NEI VFQ-25 total scores were seen in both studies for 
the VEGF Trap-Eye treatment groups, although the effect on visual acuity quality of life parameters 
(NEI VFQ-25 total scores) was less prominent in Galileo study at week 24. Whilst Copernicus study 
has  shown  robust  statistical  significance  across  all  visual,  anatomical  and  functional  endpoints  by 
week 24 and favourable changes in NEI VFQ-25 distance and dependency subscores, Galileo study 
has failed to show the difference in the proportion of subjects who developed neovascularisation, in 
terms of quality of life improvements as measured by EQ-5D questionnaire (the latter has not been 
utilized  in  Copernicus  study)  and  changes  in  NEI  VFQ-25  distance  activity  and  dependency 
subscores.  The  proportion  of  subjects  progressing  to  any  neovascularizations  was  limited  in  both 
studies.  
Overall,  the  results  provided  for  primary  24-week  phase  of  both  studies  and  integrated  results 
demonstrate  the  superiority  of  monthly  fixed  injections  of  EYLEA  over  Sham  in  all  visual  criteria 
and  morphologic  criteria.  There  were  few  progressions  to  neovascularisation  and  a  very  limited 
number of PRP treatments. Visual quality of life tends to also improve. 
Weeks 24-52: 
In the second phase of the studies, between 24 and 52 weeks, the monthly proactive dosing 
was switched to a PRN (reactive) dosing based on prespecified retreatment criteria but a monthly 
monitoring was maintained. 
Beginning  at  Week  24,  patients  received  VEGF  Trap-Eye  treatment  only  if  they  met  pre-specified 
retreatment criteria, except for patients in the control group in the GALILEO study who continued 
to receive sham.  
At  week  52,  results  demonstrated  a  statistically  and  clinically  significant  superiority  of 
VTE2Q4+PRN  over  Sham  (GALILEO)  or  over  Sham+VTE  PRN  (COPERNICUS)  in  Proportion  of 
Subjects who Gained 15 or More Letters. BCVA improvements in the treatment group VTE2Q4+PRN 
remained  highly  statistically  and  clinically  significant  compared  to  Sham  (GALILEO)  or  to 
Sham+VTE PRN (COPERNICUS). However, in this second six months phase of studies, a slight (but 
non  clinically  significant)  decrease  of  approximately  1  letter  in  BCVA  from  the  gains  achieved  at 
Week  24  was  observed  in  the  VTE2Q4+PRN  treatment  group  and  in  both  individual  studies.  As 
expected,  in  COPERNICUS,  subjects  switching  to  active  treatment  at  Week  24  increased  slightly 
their BCVA but these gains remained limited to about 4 letters over baseline.  
By  Week  52,  these  subjects  experienced  a  mean  increase  of  3.8±17.1  letters,  which  was  not 
different from the increase seen in the sham subjects of the GALILEO study (3.8±18.1). This could 
be  explained  by  the  difference  observed  in  the  mean  BCVA  of  the  two  sham  groups  at  the 
beginning of the active treatment course for sham  subjects in COPERNICUS (54.3±20.2 letters in 
GALILEO compared to 44.8±23.8 letters in COPERNICUS). 
In  the  individual  studies,  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  the  reduction  in  CRT  in  favour  of 
VEGF  Trap-Eye  over  sham  was  seen  in  GALILEO,  where  sham  subjects  received  only  sham 
Eylea

treatment  through  Week  52,  but  not  in  COPERNICUS,  where  sham  subjects  switched  to  active 
treatment at Week 24.  
Also, PRN treatment in Copernicus could have accounted for a loss of statistical significance in the 
differences  of  NEI  VFQ-25  total  scores,  change  in  near  activity  subscores,  and  distance  activities 
subscores,  which  remained  statistically  significant  in  Galileo.  On  the  contrary,  progression  to 
neovascularisation and the difference in change of EQ-5D was not statistically significant in Galileo 
study.  Overall,  progression  to  neovascularization  in  both  studies  was  very  limited  with  only  few 
patients requiring a PRP treatment. 
Subgroup analyses in both studies showed that there are no restrictions regarding efficacy of VEGF 
Trap-Eye in relation to organ function such as renal impairment, liver function, or diabetes status. 
In  the  individual  studies,  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  the  reduction  in  CRT  in  favour  of 
VEGF  Trap-Eye  over  sham  was  seen  in  GALILEO,  where  sham  subjects  received  only  sham 
treatment  through  Week  52,  but  not  in  COPERNICUS,  where  sham  subjects  switched  to  active 
treatment at Week 24.  
These results suggest that an initiation of treatment with a monthly dosing regimen may contribute 
efficiently  to  the  long  term  efficacy  of  VEGF  Trap-Eye  in  the  treatment  of  CRVO,  even  with  a 
switching to a PRN regimen. 
Follow-up periods were up to Week 76 in GALILEO and up to Week 100 in COPERNICUS. 
In  COPERNICUS  and  GALILEO  studies  regarding  the  VTE  2Q4+PRN  groups,  there  was  a  tendency 
towards  deterioration  of  vision  and  central  retinal  thickness  throughout  the  respective  Week  52-
100 or 52-76 follow up periods. 
In  the  Sham+PRN  group,  improvements  observed  during  the  Week  24-52  period  with  the 
beginning of active treatment, also tended to diminish throughout the follow up period. 
Degradation  in  results  during  the  follow  up  period  of  treatment  may  be  a  consequence  of  the 
extension  of  the  monitoring  intervals  after  week  52.  Section  4.2  of  the  SmPC  specifies  that 
monitoring in this phase might be more frequent than treatment. 
Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
At  Week-24,  both  Phase-3  studies  (GALILEO  and  COPERNICUS)  met  the  primary  endpoint  with 
high statistical significance: in both studies, Eylea administered monthly (VTE 2Q4) was shown to 
be superior over the sham in the proportion of subjects gaining 15 or more ETDRS letters. 
Concerning the secondary variables at 24 weeks, in GALILEO, clinically and statistically significant 
differences in favour of VEGF Trap-Eye treatment compared to sham treatment were seen only for 
the first two variables (change from baseline in BCVA score at Week 24 and change from baseline 
in CRT at Week 24), therefore, the hypothesis testing was stopped after the proportion of subjects 
in GALILEO progressing to any neovascularisation showed a lack of statistical significant difference 
between  groups.  On  the  contrary,  in  COPERNICUS  study,  all  tests  were  significantly  in  favour  of 
VEGF Trap-Eye treatment compared to sham treatment. 
The  integrated  analysis  using  the  pooled  data  from  both  studies  at  Week  24  confirmed  the 
superiority of 2.0 mg Eylea once every 4 weeks over the sham treatment.  
At week 52, results demonstrate a statistically and clinically significant superiority of VTE2Q4+PRN 
over  Sham  (GALILEO)  or  over  Sham+VTE  PRN  (COPERNICUS)  in  the  Proportion  of  Subjects  who 
Gained  15  or  More  Letters.  BCVA  improvements  in  the  treatment  group  VTE2Q4+PRN  remained 
highly  statiscally  and  clinically  significant  compared  to  Sham  (GALILEO)  or  to  Sham+VTE  PRN 
(COPERNICUS).  
The  slight  decrease  in  BCVA  of  approximately  1  letter  from  the  gains  achieved  at  Week  24 
observed in the VEGF Trap-Eye subjects of studies during this second six month phase of studies is 
considered not clinically significant. 
Weeks 52-76 and 52-100:  In both studies, with a different interval for monitoring applied in each 
individual  study,  there  is  a  tendency  towards  deterioration  of  vision  and  central  retinal  thickness 
beyond Week 52. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
Pooled safety data in support of the clinical safety of VEGF Trap-Eye are presented from the Week-
24  (primary  efficacy  endpoints)  and  Week-52  endpoint  of  two  randomized,  sham-controlled,

double-masked Phase-3 CRVO studies (COPERNICUS and GALILEO) that, together, included a total 
of 366 randomized subjects. These CRVO studies were similar and were designed to compare VEGF 
Trap-Eye  to  sham  injections.  Sham  injections  represented  observation,  the  standard  of  care  for 
macular edema secondary to CRVO that was in place at the inception of this  clinical development 
program.   
The  clinical  safety  of  VEGF  Trap-Eye  for  the  treatment  of  macular  edema  secondary  to  CRVO  is 
supported by data in the initial marketing application for VEGF Trap-Eye for AMD, which included a 
large clinical safety database of 2230 subjects (“Pool 3”) who  had received VEGF Trap-Eye  IVT in 
ophthalmology studies of AMD and DME. Data was also provided on an additional 744 subjects who 
had received VEGF Trap intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously in ophthalmology, oncology, PK, and 
PD studies. 
Patient exposure 
In  COPERNICUS  study,  189  subjects  were  randomized  and  188  received  at  least  one  study 
treatment as follows:  74 in the sham group and 114 in the VTE 2Q4+PRN group. The majority of 
subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  completed  the  first  52  weeks  of  the  study;  52  (73.2%)  in  the 
sham group and 91 (85.8%) in the VTE 2Q4+PRN group. 
During the first 24 weeks of treatment, planned  exposure  to  VEGF Trap-Eye  in the  study eye  was 
2  mg  administered  monthly.  Thereafter,  exposure  to  VEGF  Trap-Eye  was  2  mg  administered  as 
needed  based  on  protocol-specified  retreatment  criteria.  Therefore,  during  the  52  weeks,  the 
minimum  exposure  was  6  injections  (12  mg  of  VEGF  Trap-Eye)  and  the  maximum  was  13 
injections (26 mg of VEGF Trap-Eye).  Mean exposure to VEGF Trap-Eye at Week 52 was 16.8 mg 
in  the  VTE2Q4+PRN  group  and  6.3  mg  in  the  sham+PRN  group,  over  a  total  mean  duration  of 
334.5  days.  The  mean  number  of  injections  (including  sham)  received  was  similar  for  subjects  in 
the two treatment groups (10.4 in the sham+PRN group and 12.2 in the VTE2Q4+PRN group.) 
The mean exposure to VEGF Trap-Eye in the VTE 2Q4+PRN group was 16.0 ± 4.7 mg, over a total 
mean  duration  of  333.6  ±  85.7  days.  The  mean  number  of  treatments  administered  was  similar 
between  treatment  groups:  10.5  ±  4.2  in  the  sham+PRN  group  and  11.8  ±  2.8  in  the 
VTE2Q4+PRN  group.  From  Weeks  24  to  52,  the  mean  number  of  active  injections  received  was 
higher in the sham+PRN group (3.9) than in the VTE2Q4+PRN group.  
In GALILEO  study, 177 subjects were randomized and 172 received at least one study treatment 
as follows:  68 in the sham group and 104 in the VTE 2Q4+PRN group. Individual compliance with 
study  treatments  (active or  sham)  was  good  in  both  groups:  the  mean  of  compliance  values  was 
87.8% in the sham group and 93.9% in the VTE 2Q4+PRN group.  
During  the  first  24  weeks  of  treatment,  the  planned  exposure  was  2  mg  VEGF  Trap-Eye 
administered monthly (6 injections, 12 mg). During Weeks 24 through 48, exposure to VEGF Trap-
Eye was 2 mg administered as needed based on protocol-specified retreatment criteria. 
Unlike  the  COPERNICUS  study,  sham  subjects  in  GALILEO  received  only  sham  treatmentd  for  the 
full 52 weeks. 
During  the  52  weeks  of  treatment,  mean  ±  SD  total  exposure  to  VEGF  Trap-Eye  in  the 
VTE2Q4+PRN  group  was  16.0  ±  4.7  mg,  over  a  mean  duration  of  333.6  ±  85.7  days.  The  mean 
number of treatments administered (active and sham) was similar between treatment groups: 10.5 
± 4.2 in the sham group and 11.8 ± 2.8 in the VTE 2Q4+PRN group.

Integrated Analysis – Exposure Week 0 to Week 52 (counting sham injections; SAF) 
At Week-52, the mean total exposure in pooled studies was 6.32 mg over a mean duration of 309 
days for subjects in the sham+VTE PRN group and 16.43 mg over a mean duration of 343 days for 
subjects in the VTE2Q4 group. 
In GALILEO study, during  the 76 weeks of treatment, the total exposure to VEGF Trap-Eye in the 
VTE2Q4+PRN group was 18.3 mg over a mean duration of 450 days. In the sham+VTE PRN group, 
total exposure to active drug was 2.5 mg over a mean duration of 400 days. The mean number of 
treatments  administered  (active  and  sham)  was  slightly  higher  in  the  VTE2Q4+PRN  group  (14.3) 
than in the sham+VTE PRN group (12.7; FAS). 
In COPERNICUS, from baseline to week 100, the mean number of injections (excluding sham) that 
subjects received was higher in the VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4+PRN group (11.8) than in the Sham+PRN 
group (6.4). The VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4+PRN group received over 3 times as much VEGF Trap-Eye 2 
mg  over  the  length  of  the  study  compared  to  the  Sham+PRN  group  (1293  total  number  of  VEGF 
Trap-Eye injections vs. 384 sham injections) 
The mean time between VEGF Trap-Eye PRN injections was shorter in the Sham+PRN group (61.40 
days) than in the VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4+PRN group (87.41 days).  
The  proportion  of  subjects  receiving  re-treatment  at  intervals  of  ≥12  weeks  was  1.7%  in  the 
Sham+PRN group and 14.5% in the VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4+PRN group. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  receiving  re-treatment  at  intervals  of  ≥8  weeks  was  10.0%  in  the 
Sham+PRN group and 25.5% in the VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4+PRN group. 
Long-term  safety  data:  limited  information  is  available  beyond  the  Week-52  endpoint.  Only  a 
line-listing  of  serious  adverse  events  reported  through  the  close  of  the  final  study  databases  are 
provided for both COPERNICUS (data base closed 10 May 2012) and GALILEO (data base closed 02 
May 2012) was provided.  
In  GALILEO,  which  was  a  18-month  study,  the  majority  of  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups 
completed  the  76  week  study;  52  (73.2%)  in  the  sham+VTE  PRN  group  and  90  (84.9%)  in  the 
VTE2Q4+PRN group.

At the end of the 76  weeks of treatment, there was little difference between treatment groups in 
the incidence of injection-related TEAEs (sham+VTE PRN 39.7%; VTE2Q4+PRN 42.3%). The most 
common ocular TEAE in the study eye was macular edema (sham+VTE PRN 25.0%; VTE2Q4+PRN 
39.4%) and most events of macular edema in the VTE2Q4+PRN group occurred after the switch to 
PRN  dosing.  Most  ocular  TEAEs  in  the  study  eye  had  a  maximum  intensity  of  mild  or  moderate. 
Only  7.4%  of  subjects  receiving  sham+VTE  PRN  and  9.6%  of  subjects  receiving  VTE2Q4+PRN 
reported severe ocular TEAEs in the study eye. 
In  COPERNICUS,  which  was  a  100-week  study,  the  majority  of  subjects  in  each  treatment  group 
completed  the  entire  100  weeks  of  the  study  (67.6%  Sham+PRN,  and  88.7%  VEGF  Trap-Eye 
2Q4+PRN). 
From  baseline  to  week  100,  the  overall  incidence  of  ocular  TEAEs  in  the  study  eye  considered  by 
the  investigator  to  be  drug-related  was  low  (5  [6.8%]  Sham+PRN,  and  3  [2.6%]  VEGF  Trap-Eye 
2Q4+PRN).  No  ocular  TEAE  in  the  study  eye  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  drug  related 
occurred in any more than 1 subject in either treatment group. 
From  weeks  24  to  100,  there  were  4  ocular  TEAEs  in  the  study  eye  of  4  subjects  that  were 
considered by the investigator to be drug-related (Cataract, Macular Hole, and Vision Blurred in 1 
subject each in the Sham+PRN group, and Macular Fibrosis in 1 subject in the VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4 
+PRN group). 
From  baseline  to  week  100,  the  number  of  subjects  experiencing  at  least  1  ocular  TEAE  in  the 
study eye was similar between treatment groups (63 [85.1%] Sham+PRN, and 100 [87.7%] VEGF 
Trap-Eye 2Q4+PRN). 
The  most  common  ocular  TEAEs  occurring  in  ≥10%  in  both  groups  were  VA  Reduced  (27.0% 
Sham+PRN, and 28.1% VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4+PRN), Conjunctival Hemorrhage (20.3% Sham+PRN, 
and 19.3% VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4+PRN), Retinal Hemorrhage (16.2% Sham+PRN, and 15.8% VEGF 
Trap-Eye  2Q4+PRN),  and  IOP  Increased  (17.6%  Sham+PRN,  and  12.3%  VEGF  Trap-Eye 
2Q4+PRN).  Eye  Pain occurred more frequently in the VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4+PRN group than in the 
Sham+PRN  group,  and  is  consistent  with  TEAEs  associated  with  the  injection  procedure.  Vitreous 
Hemorrhage,  consistent  with  complications  of  CRVO,  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  Sham+PRN 
group as did Retinal Pigment Epitheliopathy. Other complications of CRVO including Macular Edema, 
Cystoid  Macular  Edema,  and  Retinal  Exudates  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  VEGF  Trap-Eye 
2Q4+PRN group. 
The observed imbalance between treatment groups in Macular Edema and Cystoid Macular Edema 
occurred between weeks 24 to 100. From baseline to week 24, the incidence of Macular Edema was 
similar between treatment groups (1 [1.4%] sham, and 1 [0.9%] VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4. After week 
24, when subjects in the sham group were eligible to receive VEGF Trap-Eye PRN and subjects in 
the 2Q4+PRN switched to a PRN regimen, the frequency of Macular Edema was greater in the VEGF 
Trap-Eye  2Q4+PRN  group  than  in  the  Sham+PRN  group  (2  [3.3%]  Sham+PRN,  and  20  [18.2%] 
VEGF  Trap-Eye  2Q4+PRN);  except  for  1  SAE  of  Macular  Edema  in  the  VEGF  Trap-Eye  2Q4+PRN 
group, all other events of Macular Edema were non-serious, and none in the Sham+PRN group and 
2 (1.8%) in the VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q4+PRN group were considered severe. 
The  follow  up  reports  on  100  weeks  of  treatment  duration  for  COPERNICUS  and  76  weeks  for 
GALILEO  were  summarised,  as  requested  by  CHMP,  including  all  Ocular  and  non-ocular  Drug-
Related TEAEs from the GALILEO and COPERNICUS studies follow-up period (from 52 to 76 weeks 
and  52  to  100  weeks,  respectively).  No  new  signals  emerged  from  the  follow  up  period  data  of 
Copernicus and Galileo studies. 
In GALILEO, the reports of macular edema significantly increased at the end of the follow up period, 
and surprisingly were more frequent  in the VTE2Q4+PRN group (39.4%) compared to sham+VTE 
PRN  group  (25%).  In  COPERNICUS,  the  same  happened;  after  24  weeks,  macular  edema  was 
more frequent in the VTE2Q4+PRN group (18.4%) compared to Sham+PRN (4.1%). 
The applicant explained that this difference occurred between 24 and 100 weeks when all patients 
were  treated  as  needed  (PRN).  Given  that  macular  edema  following  CRVO  is  the  indication 
requested by the applicant, and that the safety results after 24 weeks in both studies showed that 
less events occurred in the placebo group, the continuation of treatment as needed (PRN) after 24 
weeks  remains  questionable.  To  give  a  reassurance  on  this  point,  the  MAH  will  closely  monitor 
these effects in the PSURs. 
Adverse events  
Starting at Week 24 and through Week 48, subjects were evaluated monthly. Safety assessments 
included  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (non-ocular,  ocular  study  eye,  and  ocular  fellow 
eye),  laboratory  variables  (clinical  chemistry,  hematology  and  urinalysis),  vital  signs,  ophthalmic 
safety examinations (including predefined “abnormalities” in IOP) and immunogenicity.

Week 0-Week 24  
The overall incidence of TEAEs (non-ocular and ocular) in the study and fellow eyes, and SAEs was 
similar  between  groups  or  lower  in  the  VTE2Q4  group  (166  subjects  [76.1%])  than  in  the  sham 
group (115 subjects [81.0%]). Most TEAEs were of mild or moderate intensity. 
Week 24-Week 52 
The  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  (non-ocular  and  ocular)  for  the  study  and  fellow  eyes  and  SAEs 
were  slightly  lower  in  the  sham  group  (43  subjects  [75.4%])  than  in  the  sham+VTE  PRN  (49 
subjects [81.7%]) and the VTE2Q4+PRN groups (168 subjects [81.2%]). Most TEAEs were of mild 
or moderate intensity. 
Ocular Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) 
Week 0 - Week 24 
The overall frequency of ocular TEAEs in the study eye was somewhat higher in the sham groups 
(94 subjects [66.2%]) than in the VTE2Q4 group (129 subjects [59.2%]; Table 19). Ocular TEAEs 
in  the  study  eye  were  generally  consistent  with  disease  progression  or  the  expected  adverse 
consequences of the injection procedure. 
The most common (≥5%) ocular TEAEs in the VTE2Q4 group were eye pain (28 subjects [12.8%]), 
conjunctival  hemorrhage  (26  subjects  [11.9%]),  IOP  increased  (17  subjects  [7.8%]),  retinal 
exudates (15 subjects [6.9%]), optic disc vascular disorder (13 subjects [6.0%]), retinal vascular 
disorder (12 subjects [5.5%]), and vitreous floaters (11 subjects [5.0%]). 
IOP increased is an expected consequence of the injection procedure, most were considered by the 
investigator to be injection related (12 subjects [5.5%] of 17 subject in VTE2Q4 group).  
For the sham injections, a syringe without a needle was used and no IVT or intraocular penetration 
was performed. Two reports of IOP increased (1.4%) in the sham groups were considered by the 
investigator to be injection related.  
The only ocular TEAE that occurred more frequently in the VTE2Q4 group than in the sham groups 
(difference of 5% or more) was eye pain, (28 subjects [12.8%] versus 7 subjects [4.9%]. Eye pain 
is  an  expected  consequence  of  the  injection  procedure,  and  most  of  the  TEAEs  of  eye  pain  were 
considered by the investigator to be injection related (5 subjects [3.5%] sham; 24 subjects [11.0%] 
VTE2Q4).  
The incidence of ocular TEAEs in the study eye considered drug-related by the investigator was low 
and  similar  between  treatment  groups  (sham,  4.9%;  VTE2Q4,  3.7%).  Only  three  ocular  drug-
related TEAEs occurred in more than one subject in either treatment group: eye irritation (sham, 3 
subjects [2.1%]; VTE2Q4, 2 subjects [0.9%]) endophthalmitis  (VTE2Q4,  1  subjects  [0.6%]) 
and IOP increased (sham, 6 subjects [4.2%]; VTE2Q4, 6 subjects [2.8%]). Those effects are listed 
in the SPC. 
The Applicant clarified that the slightly higher frequency of ocular TEAEs from Week 0 to Week 24 
in  the  sham  groups  represents  expected  disease-related  events  and  is  not  related  to  the  sham 
injection procedures. 
Only one case of endophtalmitis occurred over a 76/100 week period on a total of 2728 injections 
(without  sham  injections).  The  overall  rate  of  endophthalmitis  was  thereby  0.04%  per  injection, 
which is acceptable. 
Nine subjects (4.1%) experienced macular fibrosis in the VTE2Q4 group compared to 1 subject in 
each group of sham. These cases were not included in Section 4.8 of the SPC as it was considered 
that these rather small numbers, seen at only one time point, are not sufficiently meaningful and 
do not justify the inclusion of this disorder in Section 4.8. To clarify the point, the MAH will closely 
monitor Macular fibrosis events in the PSURs.  
In  the  first  24  weeks,  macular  edema  and  visual  acuity  reduced were  more  frequent  in  the  sham 
groups than in the VTE2Q4 group, as expected. However, the differences between sham groups in 
the two studies are surprisingly large: 16.2% vs 1.4% for macular edema and 10.3% vs 17.6% for 
visual  acuity  reduced.  Even  if  the  number  of  patients  is  limited,  the  homogeneity  of  procedures 
between  the  2  phase  III  studies  is  questioned.  According  to  the  MAH  response  the  difference  in 
incidence  of  TAEs  between  studies  might  have  been  a  chance  finding  and  resulted  from 
methodological differences in trial conduct and collection of AEs. However, due to the small number 
of patients, no further conclusions could be drawn, and macular edema and visual acuity reduced 
will be monitored in the PSURs (see also assessment of week 24-52 below).

Week 24 - Week 52 
The  overall  incidence  of  ocular  TEAEs  in  the  study  eye  during  Weeks  24  to  52  was  lowest  in  the 
sham group (29 subjects [50.9%]) and highest in the VTE2Q4+PRN group (129 subjects [62.3%]); 
the overall incidence of ocular TEAEs in the study eye was 55.0% in the sham+VTE PRN group (33 
subjects) during this time. 
.  A  higher  incidence  of  cystoid  macular  edema,  macular  edema,  vitreous  detachment,  and  visual 
acuity reduced occurred in the VTE2Q4+PRN group than in the sham+VTE PRN and sham groups. 
These changes from the incidence noted in Weeks 0 to 24, especially for macular edema (1.4% to 
21.3%,  respectively)  and  visual  acuity  reduced  (4.1%  to  13.0%,  respectively)  may  reflect  the 
transition from fixed monthly dosing to less-frequent doing under a reactive paradigm at 24 weeks. 
· A higher incidence of conjunctival hemorrhage and retinal pigment epitheliopathy occurred in the 
sham+VTE PRN group than in the VTE2Q4+PRN and sham groups. 
·  A  higher  incidence  of  lacrimation  increased,  macular  cyst,  optic  disc  vascular  disorder,  retinal 
degeneration,  and  retinal  hemorrhage  occurred  in  the  sham  group  than  in  the  VTE2Q4+PRN  and 
sham+VTE PRN groups. 
Eye pain is an expected consequence of the injection procedure and occurred slightly more often in 
the  VTE2Q4+PRN  and  sham+VTE  PRN  groups  than  the  sham  group.  All  of  the  eye  pains  TEAEs 
were considered by the investigator to be injection related.  
Macular  fibrosis  and  retinal  exudates,  both  complications  of  CRVO,  occurred  more  often  in  those 
subjects  initially  treated  only  with  sham  (ie,  the  sham  and  sham+VTE  PRN  groups)  than  he 
VTE2Q4+PRN group. 
Finally,  as  expected,  IOP  increased  was  noted  more  often  for  subjects  receiving  an  actual  IVT 
injection  (ie,  the  sham+VTE  PRN  and  VTE2Q4+PRN  groups)  than  for  those  receiving  a  sham 
injection. 
Six  ocular  TEAEs  were  assessed  as  drug-related:  in  the  VTE2Q4+PRN  group  cataract  subcapsular 
(1  subject  [0.5%]),  macular  fibrosis  (1  subject  [0.5%]),  macular  ischemia  (1  subject  [0.5%]), 
macular edema (1 subject [0.5%]), and IOP increased (2 subjects [1.0%]; in the sham+VTE PRN 
group: 1 cataract (1 subject [0.5%]).

From  24  to  52  weeks,  the  symptoms  of  disease  worsening,  macular  edema  and  visual  acuity 
reduced became significantly more frequent in the VTE2Q4 group than in the sham groups (21.3% 
vs  10.5%  and  0%  for  macular  edema,  and  13%  vs  1.8%  and  5%  for  visual  acuity  reduced, 
respectively). This was unexpected. Moreover these effects were also observed beyond 52 weeks. 
The Applicant has explained that the “imbalance” between treatment groups is a reflection of one 
treatment  group  –  the  VTE2Q4  group  -  experiencing  a  return  of  symptoms  with  reactive  PRN 
treatment and the other group – the sham group from COPERNICUS – experiencing improvements 
in symptoms with the initiation of active treatment. 
To clarify this point further, the MAH will closely monitor macular edema and visual acuity decrease 
in the PSURs. 
Non-ocular Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
Week 0 - Week 24 
The incidence of non-ocular TEAEs was similar between treatment groups (sham, 52.8%; VTE2Q4, 
48.6%) and, in general, reflected the expected comorbidities of the study populations. 
Most  non-ocular  TEAEs  were  associated  with  the  SOC  of  Infections  and  Infestations:  29  subjects 
(20.4%)  in  the  sham  groups  and  42  subjects  (19.3%)  in  the  VTE2Q4  group  (bronchitis  5  cases 
[2.3%], nasopharyngitis 13 cases [6%], influenza 4 cases [1.8%], upper respiratory tract infection 
7 cases [3.2%]). 
The  higher  frequency  in  the  sham  group  of  TEAEs  associated  with  the  Musculoskeletal  and 
Connective  Tissue  Disorders  SOC  primarily  reflected  a  higher  frequency  of  arthralgia  in  the  sham 
groups (6 subjects [4.2%]) than in the VTE2Q4 group (2 subjects [0.9%]). 
The  only  non-ocular  TEAEs  of  interest  occurring  in  more  than  two  subjects  were  carotid  artery 
stenosis (sham, 1 subject [0.7%]; VTE2Q4, 1 subject [0.5%]) and hypertension (sham, 7 subjects

[4.9%];  VTE2Q4,  14  subjects  [6.4%])/blood  pressure  increased  (sham,  1  subjects  [0.7%]; 
VTE2Q4, 2 subjects [0.9%]). 
Week 24 - Week 52 
About half the subjects in all three treatment groups reported at least one non-ocular TEAE during 
Week 24 to Week 52 (sham, 50.9%; sham+VTE PRN 66.7%; VTE2Q4+PRN 56.5%).  
Most  non-ocular  TEAEs  were  associated  with  the  SOC  Infections  and  Infestations:  18  subjects 
(31.6%)  in  the  sham  group,  15  subjects  (25.0%)  in  the  sham+VTE  PRN  group,  and  50  subjects 
(24.2%) in the VTE2Q4+PRN group.  
Collectively,  TEAEs  in  the  SOC  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  were  reported  more  frequently  in  the 
sham+VTE PRN group (9 subjects [15%]) than the sham (5 subjects [8.8%]) or VTE2Q4+PRN (17 
subjects [8.2%]) groups, and Investigations were reported more frequently in the sham+VTE PRN 
group  (17  subjects  [28.3%])  than  the  sham  (3  subjects  [5.3%])  and  VTE2Q4+PRN  (17  subjects 
[8.2%]) groups.  
The  most  common  TEAEs  in  all  treatment  groups  were  nasopharyngitis  (sham,  11  subjects 
[19.3%]);  sham+VTE  PRN,  3  subjects  [5.0%];  and  VTE2Q4+PRN,  14  subjects  [6.8%]), 
hypertension  (sham,  4  subjects  [7.0%]);  sham+VTE  PRN,  3  subjects  [5.0%];  and  VTE2Q4+PRN, 
11  subjects  [5.3%]  and  headache  (sham,  1  subject  [1.8%]);  sham+VTE  PRN,  1  subject  [1.8%]; 
and  VTE2Q4+PRN,  6  subjects  [2.9%].  There  was  a  higher  frequency  of  nasopharyngitis  in  the 
sham group, while hypertension and headache were similar among the three treatment groups. 
Two cases were assessed as drug-related in the VTE2Q4+PRN group (1 hepatic function abnormal 
(0.5%) and 1 increased urine protein/creatinine ratio (0.5%).

Arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs): 
Arterial thromboembolic events are AEs potentially related to systemic VEGF inhibition and there is 
a theoretical risk of ATEs following IVT use of VEGF inhibitors. Arterial thromboembolic events, as 
defined  by  the  APTC  criteria,  include  nonfatal  myocardial  infarction,  nonfatal  stroke,  or  vascular 
death (including deaths of unknown cause). 
Post-hoc  adjudication  of  possible  ATEs  according  to  the  APTC  criteria  was  performed  for  the 
individual studies by masked adjudicators.

COPERNICUS: During the first 24 weeks of treatment, there were no APTC events in the VTE2Q4 
group. Two subjects in the sham group experienced APTC events, acute myocardial infarction and 
arrhythmia. From Weeks 24 to Week 52, one subject in the VTE2Q4+PRN group experienced non-
fatal myocardial infarction (reported as the MedDRA PTs of coronary artery stenosis and myocardial 
infarction; Subject 135-006).  
GALILEO: No potential ATEs reported in the GALILEO study were adjudicated as APTC events. 
Serious adverse events  
Week 0 - Week 24 
The incidence of serious ocular TEAEs in the study eye was higher in the sham groups (15 subjects 
[10.6%])  than  in  the  VTE2Q4  group  (6  subjects  [2.8%]).  Most  serious  ocular  TEAEs  in  the  study 
eye were attributable to progression of disease or to the injection procedure. Serious ocular TEAEs 
in the study eye that were reported by two or more subjects occurred in the sham group only and 
included  vitreous  hemorrhage  (5  subjects  [3.5%]);  glaucoma  (3  subjects  [2.1%]);  and  iris 
neovascularization,  macular  edema,  visual  acuity  reduced,  and  retinal  hemorrhage  (2  subjects 
[1.4%] each). One VTE2Q4-treated subjects experienced a serious event of endophthalmitis. 
Only two subjects experienced serious ocular TEAEs considered to be related to the study drug: 1 
case of retinal artery occlusion and one of macular ischemia (prior to Week 24; VTE2Q4). 
The overall incidence of serious non-ocular TEAEs was similar in both treatment groups (sham, 11 
subjects  [7.7%];  VTE2Q4,  12  subjects  [5.5%];  Table  35).  Pneumonia  was  the  only  serious  non-
ocular TEAEs that was reported by more than one subject (sham group only,  2 subjects [1.4%]). 
Circulatory  collapse  (VTE2Q4  group,  1  subject  [0.5%])  was  predefined  as  a  systemic  reaction 
related  to  immunogenicity.  However,  this  subject  had  negative  results  in  the  ADA  assay.  In  the 
opinion of the investigator, this event was not related to study drug, injection or to study conduct 
procedure but was due to underlying disease of orthostatic dysregulation and hot summer weather. 
Week 24 – Week 52 
The incidence of serious ocular TEAEs in the study eye was 3.5% in the sham group, and 3.3% in 
the sham+VTE PRN group, and 5.3% in the VTE2Q4+PRN group. Most serious ocular TEAEs in the 
study  eye  were  attributable  to  progression  of  disease  or  the  injection  procedure.  Serious  ocular 
TEAEs in the study eye that were reported by two or more subjects occurred in the VTE2Q4+PRN 
group only and included macular edema (4 subjects [1.9%]), vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal vein 
occlusion (2 subjects each [1.0%]). Although the overall incidence of these serious events is low in 
the VTE2Q4+PRN group, they (especially macular edema) may point to a reactivation of disease in 
the  PRN  phase  of  the  study  as  none  was  reported  for  these  subjects  in  the  first  24  weeks  of  the 
study. 
Only  one  subject  experienced  serious  ocular  TEAEs  considered  to  be  related  to  the  study  drug:  1 
case of cataract. 
The  overall  incidence  of  serious  non-ocular  TEAEs  was  similar  among  treatment  groups  (sham,  5 
subjects [8.8%]; sham+VTE PRN, 5 subjects [8.3%]; VTE2Q4+PRN, 13 subjects [6.3%]). Serious-
non  ocular  TEAEs  that  were  reported  by  more  than  one  subject  occurred  in  the  sham  group  only 
and included syncope (2 subjects [3.5%]). One subject in the VTE2Q4+PRN group experienced an 
APTC event of myocardial infarction and was discussed above and one subject experienced hepatic 
function abnormal.

Long-term  study:  limited  information  is  available  beyond  the  Week-52  endpoint.  Only  a  line-
listing of serious adverse events is provided. 
Ninety  nine  (99)  serious  events  were  reported  in  the  extension  phase:  33  in  group  Sham  +  PRN 
and 66 in VTE2Q4 + PRN group. 
Two  Arterial  thromboembolic  events  (myocardial  infarction)  occurred  in  a  64-year-old  female 
patient  with  a  medical  history  of  diabete  mellitus  type  II  (for  22  years),,  hyperlipidaemia  (for  22 
years)    and  hypertension  (for  5  years).  Despite  of  her  past  medical  history  which  is  confounding 
factor of ATE, a causal role of VEGF Trap cannot be excluded.  
Therefore,  ATEs  have  been  added  to  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  and  will  be  closely  monitored  in  a 
PASS study. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
A  total  of  four  deaths  were  reported  in  the  100  weeks  of  the  COPERNICUS  study,  all  of  which 
occurred in subjects randomized to the sham group and were assessed as not related to study drug. 
Complete  narrative  and  CIOMS  form  have  been  provided  as  requested.  Two  subjects  died  before 
Week  24  and  two  died  after  Week  24.  The  first  patient  (126-002)  died  of  esophageal 
adenocarcinoma,  the  second  one  (126-002)  who  had  medical  history  of  hyperlipidaemia, 
hypertension,  heart  disease  and  stent  placement  died  of  arrhythmia,  the  third  one  (145-005) 
suffering  from  atherosclerotic  cardiovascular  disease  died  of  acute  myocardial  infarction  and  the 
last patient (146-003) died of pneumonia. 
Overdose 
No overdoses (including no AEs with the PT overdose) were reported in COPERNICUS or GALILEO. 
However, doses of up to 4 mg/eye in monthly intervals in early AMD clinical trials, and an isolated 
case of overdose of up to 10 mg/eye were generally well tolerated. Overdosing was associated with 
increased  injection  volume  and  subsequently  with  increased  IOP.  Therefore,  when  overdose  is 
associated  with  increased  volume,  IOP  should  be  monitored,  and  if  deemed  necessary  by  the 
treating physician, adequate treatment should be initiated. 
Drug Abuse 
VEGF  Trap-Eye  will  be  administered  by  a  qualified  physician.  The  drug  will  not  be  prescribed  for 
self-administration. In addition, the method of VEGF Trap-Eye administration, IVT injection, is not 
conducive to drug abuse. 
There  has  been  no  evidence  of  psychotropic  properties  associated  with  the  study  drug.  After 
intraocular  injection,  VEGF-Trap  binds  with  VEGF-A  to  form  a  complex.  Free  VEGF  Trap  exits  the 
ocular  space  after  IVT  administration.  Its  release  into  the  systemic  circulation  after  IVT 
administration is slow, reaching low concentrations as described previously. As a protein molecule, 
VEGF-Trap  and  its  complex  are  too  large  to  cross  the  blood-brain  barrier,  which  would  limit  any 
possibility for centrally-mediated effects associated with drug abuse.

Withdrawal and Rebound 
Macular  edema  secondary  to  CRVO  may  become  chronic,  requiring  prolonged  and  indefinite 
treatment  with  VEGF  Trap-Eye.  To  date,  there  has  been  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  rebound 
occurs  in  other  populations.  Subjects  in  these  CRVO  studies  have  been  treated  with  a  fixed  dose 
every 4 weeks up to the week 24 primary endpoint and with PRN dosing for an additional 24 weeks. 
In  the  PRN  phase,  subjects  were  retreated  based  on  changes  (pre-specified  in  the  protocols)  in 
vision and/or morphological endpoints. A considerable proportion of subjects were able to maintain 
the improvements in vision and morphology achieved with 2Q4 dosing with less frequent dosing in 
the PRN phase. These findings support the conclusion that there is no withdrawal or rebound effect 
when  the  dosing  frequency  of  VTE  is  reduced  in  subjects  who  have  reached  stable  disease. 
Additionally, in the extension phase of the study after week 52, subjects were monitored even less 
frequently  (quarterly)  as  well  as  dosed  on  a  PRN  basis.  This  experience  may  allow  for  a  better 
understanding of whether rebound occurs after at least temporary withdrawal of VEGF Trap-Eye in 
subjects with CRVO. 
Between week 24 and week 52, a higher incidence of cystoid macular edema, macular edema and 
visual  acuity  reduced,  which  are  symptoms  of  CRVO,  has  been  reported.  MAH  had  specified  that 
they  (especially  macular  edema)  may  point  to  a  reactivation  of  disease  in  the  PRN  phase  of  the 
study  as  none  was  reported  for  these  subjects  in  the  first  24  weeks  of  the  study.  As  already 
discussed, it has been requested that these effects are closely monitored through PSURs. 
Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Ability 
VEGF  Trap-Eye  is  an  ophthalmologic  preparation  intended  to  treat  visually  impaired  patients. 
Subjects may experience temporary visual disturbances after an IVT injection with VEGF Trap-Eye 
and the associated eye examinations. They should not drive or use machinery until visual function 
has recovered sufficiently. 
Immunological events 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with VEGF Trap-Eye. 
To monitor the potential development of anti-VEGF Trap antibodies, serum samples were collected 
at study-specific time points in both studies and analyzed in a validated ADA assay. 
Of  the  172  subjects  in  the  safety  analysis  set  of  GALILEO,  a  total  of  9  (5.3%)  subjects  were 
positive in the anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay, including Day 1, prior to any treatment; 5 subjects 
(7.4%)  in  the  sham  group  and  4  subjects  (3.8%)  in  the  VTE2Q4+PRN  group.  Of  the  five  sham 
subjects,  one  was  positive  in  the  baseline  sample,  one  was  considered  to  be  transiently  positive, 
and  three  had  persistently  positive  results.  Because  no  VEGF  Trap-Eye  was  administered  to  the 
sham subjects, the results for the sham group are likely due to high background responses in the 
ADA  assay  or  a  pre-existing  immunoreactivity  to  VEGF  Trap-Eye.  Of  the  four  VTE  2Q4+PRN 
subjects, one was positive in the baseline sample, two were considered to be transiently positive, 
and one had persistently positive results. 
Similarly,  of  the  188  subjects  in  the  safety  analysis  set  of  COPERNICUS,  a  total  of  8  (4.3%) 
subjects were positive in the ADA assay, including Day 1, prior to any treatment; 3 subjects (4.1%) 
in the sham+VTE PRN group and 5 subjects (4.4%) in the VTE2Q4+PRN group. The three positive 
assay results in the sham+ VTE PRN group and one positive in the VTE2Q4 + PRN group were all 
positive at baseline and in subsequent samples with no titers exceeding 30. Another subject in the 
VTE2Q4+PRN  group  was  only  positive  at  baseline  with  a  titer  of  30.  The  other  three  positive 
subjects  from  the  VEGF  Trap-Eye  2Q4+PRN  group  were  all  negative  at  baseline,  and  positive  at 
week  52.  These  subjects  (2.7%)  appeared  to  demonstrate  a  treatment-emergent  positive  ADA 
response, but the titers were low with no titer exceeding the minimum of 30.  
None of the samples from subjects with positive ADA results demonstrated activity in a neutralizing 
antibody analysis. 
The safety profiles of VEGF Trap-Eye and sham were evaluated in subjects who had positive results 
in  the  ADA  assay.  None  of  the  samples  from  subjects  with  positive  ADA  results  demonstrated 
activity  in  a  neutralizing  antibody  analysis  and  these  data  did  not  demonstrate  any  clinically 
meaningful difference between subjects with positive or negative responses in the ADA assay. 
Overall, the results from both Week 24 and Week 52 suggest that IVT administration of VEGF Trap-
Eye is associated with a very low / to no risk of immunogenicity. 
Laboratory findings 
Hematology 
Abnormal hematology values occurred with similar incidence between treatment groups. 
Eylea 
Assessment Report 
Page 79/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At  Week  24,  the  most  commonly  observed  abnormality  was  a  decrease  from  baseline  in 
hemoglobin level (decrease of ≥ 20 g/L), which occurred with the same incidence in both treatment 
groups (35.2% sham; 36.0% VTE2Q4). 
At Week 52, similarly, the most commonly observed abnormality was a decrease from baseline in 
hemoglobin level (decrease of ≥ 20 g/L), which occurred at the highest incidence in the sham+VTE 
PRN group. 
Chemistry 
At  Week  24,  the  incidence  of  predefined  laboratory  abnormalities  was  low  and  balanced  between 
the two treatment groups for all clinical chemistry test variables. 
At  Week  52,  the  incidence  of  predefined  laboratory  abnormalities  was  low  and  balanced  between 
the three treatment groups for all clinical chemistry test variables. 
Vital signs 
The  mean  and  median  values  for  systolic  blood  pressure  decreased  slightly  from  baseline  in  both 
treatment groups over the first 24 weeks of the studies, whereas, the mean and median values for 
diastolic blood pressure remained stable over the first 24 weeks  
No  clinically  meaningful  changes  were  seen  over  the  full  52  weeks  in  any  treatment  group  for 
either systolic blood pressureor diastolic blood pressure 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
Sub-group  analyses  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  the  following  demographic  and 
disease variables on safety: Sex; Age (<65 years,  ≥65 years to <75 years, and ≥75 years); Race 
(white and Asian); Renal function (CrCl >80 mL/min [normal], >50 – 80 mL/min [mild impairment], 
≤50  mL/min  or  requiring  dialysis  [moderate  or  severe  impairment;  moderate  and  severe 
impairment  were  pooled  because  of  the  few  subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment]);  Medical 
history  of  the  following  conditions  (Diabetes  mellitus,  Cataracts,  Hypertension,  Cerebrovascular 
disease, Ischemic heart disease). 
The safety sub-groups for history of hepatic impairment and history of proteinuria included too few 
subjects (<10% of overall) for meaningful comparisons.  
Week 0 - Week 24 
Results of the sub-group analyses of all TEAEs followed the trends seen in the overall population for 
the safety variables sex, age, medical history of cataract and hypertension. 
-  Race:  whereas  incidence  in  the  sham  group  was  similar  among  Asian  subjects  and  all  subjects, 
TEAE  incidence  in  the  VTE2Q4  group  was  lower  among  Asian  subjects  (14  subjects  [42.4%]  than 
among  all  subjects  (166  subjects  [76.1%]).  The  lower  TEAE  incidence  among  Asian  subjects 
compared  to  the  overall  subject  population  primarily  reflected  a  lower  incidence  of  non-ocular 
TEAEs  (9  subjects  [27.3%])  versus  106  subjects  [48.6%]  and  ocular  TEAEs  in  the  study  eye  (8 
subjects  [24.2%]  versus  129  subjects  [59.2%].  It should  be  noted,  however,  that  the  number  of 
Asian subjects in the VTE2Q4 group was relatively small (33 subjects). 
- Renal status did not affect the TEAE incidence in the sham group; however, the TEAE incidence in 
the  VTE2Q4  group  was  higher  among  subjects  with  moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment  (CrCl 
≤50  mL/min  or  requiring  dialysis;  21  subjects  [91.3%]  than  among  all  subjects  (166  subjects 
[76.1%]. It should be noted, however, that the number of subjects with moderate or severe renal 
impairment  in  the  VTE2Q4  group  was  relatively  small  (23  subjects).  The  insignificant  systemic 
exposure following treatment with VEGF Trap-Eye suggests these results to be a chance finding. 
- A medical history of diabetes mellitus, CVA/stroke, or MI did not affect the TEAE incidence in the 
VTE2Q4  group.  Sub-group  analyses  of  the  TEAE  incidence  in  the  sham  group  indicated  that, 
compared to the TEAE incidence among all sham-treated subjects (115 subjects [81.0%], the TEAE 
incidence  was  higher  among  subjects  with  a  medical  history  of  diabetes  mellitus  (21  subjects 
[95.5%], subjects with a  medical history of CVA/stroke (7 subjects [100%]),  and subjects with a 
medical history of MI (15 subjects [93.8%]. 
Week 24 – Week 52 
Results of the sub-group analyses of all TEAEs followed the trends seen in the overall population for 
sex,  age,  medical  history of  cataract,  hypertension,  diabetes  mellitus,  CVA/stroke  and  myocardial 
infarction. 
- Race: The total TEAE incidence for Asians (27 subjects [64.3%]) was lower than the total TEAE 
incidence of all treated subjects during Week 24 to Week 52 (260 subjects [80.2%] and was also 
lower than the white group (204 subjects (82.3%). The TEAE incidence in the VTE2Q4+PRN group 
was lower in the Asian group (19 subjects [63.3%]) than the white group (130 subjects [83.9%]). 
Eylea 
Assessment Report 
Page 80/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  lower  incidence  of  TEAEs  among  Asian  subjects  compared  to  the  overall  subject  population 
must be interpreted with some caution because of the relatively small sample size of Asian subjects 
(n=42) compared to the total population (n=290) and white sub-group (n=248). 
- No meaningful effect of renal status was seen on the incidence of TEAEs in subjects with “normal” 
or  “mild  impairment”  renal  function  in  any  treatment  group.  In  the  sham  group,  the  incidence  of 
TEAEs was lower in subjects with “moderate or severe impairment” (50.0%) was somewhat lower 
than  that  in  the  overall  sham  population  (75.4%).  It  is  unlikely,  however,  that  this  represents  a 
clinically  meaningful  difference;  these  results  are  more  likely  a  reflection  of  the  relatively  small 
sample size of subjects in the “moderate or severe impairment” sub-group (n=36 overall; n=5 in 
the sham group). 
Extrinsic Factors 
No extrinsic factors were analyzed in COPERNICUS or GALILEO 
Pregnancy, Lactation and Fertility 
The non clinical aspects have been assessed in the relevant section. 
There are no data on the use of VEGF Trap in pregnant women. The CHMP noted that according to 
the  extension  of  indication,  women  of  childbearing  potential  could  now  be  treated,  however,  the 
prevalence of CRVO increases with age. 
The mean age of subjects enrolled into the Phase-3 VEGF Trap-Eye clinical studies for CRVO (N = 
366)  was  64.0  years.  Of  these  subjects,  166  (46.1%)  were  <65  years  of  age.  The  likelihood  of 
pregnancy  in  this  subject  population  is  low.  Women  of  childbearing  potential  should  use  effective 
contraception  during  treatment.  Should  an  individual  become  pregnant,  VEGF  Trap  is  not 
recommended  during  pregnancy  unless  the  potential  benefit  outweighs  the  potential  risk  to  the 
fetus.  
It is unknown whether VEGF Trap is excreted in human milk. Therefore, risk to the breast-fed child 
cannot be excluded. Use of VEGF Trap is not recommended during breast-feeding. A decision must 
be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from VEGF Trap, therapy. 
An  effect  of  VEGF  Trap  on  intrauterine  development  was  shown  in  embryo-fetal  development 
studies  in  pregnant  rabbits  with  intravenous  (3  to  60  mg/kg)  as  well  as  subcutaneous  (0.1  to  1 
mg/kg) administration. The maternal no adverse effect level (NOAEL) was at the dose of 3 mg/kg 
and 1 mg/kg, respectively. A developmental NOAEL was not identified. At the 0.1 mg/kg dose, the 
systemic  exposures  based  on  Cmax  and  cumulative  AUC  for  free  VEGF  Trap  were  approximately 
17- and 10-fold higher, respectively, when compared to corresponding values observed in humans 
after an intravitreal dose of 2 mg. 
Thus this specific population is taken into consideration in the SmPC and in the risk management 
plan, as a potential risk. 
The  applicant  has  appropriately  modified  the  SmPC  labelling  in  section  4.6,  according  to  the 
guideline  on  Risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  on  human  reproduction  and  lactation:  from 
data to labelling (EMEA/CHMP/203927/2005, adopted in 2008): the recommendation for use in this 
case (with effects detected in non clinical data and no human data but a mechanism of action that 
should  be  regarded  as  potentially  teratogenic  and  embryo/foetotoxic),  should  be  “Although  the 
systemic  exposure  after  ocular  administration  is  very  low,  Eylea  should  not  be  used  during 
pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus”.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with VEGF Trap-Eye.  
Potential Concomitant Treatments 
Individuals  with  CRVO  are  generally  older  and  often  have  concomitant  diseases  that  are 
characteristic  of  an  older  population.  Study  subjects  in  the  VEGF  Trap-Eye  CRVO  clinical 
development  program  (COPERNICUS  and  GALILEO)  had  a  mean  age  of  64.0  years  and  a  medical 
history  that  was  characteristic  of  individuals  in  the  target  CRVO  population.  Concomitant  topical 
medications (topical anesthetic and antibiotic) given prior to and after the injection of VEGF Trap-
Eye  are  not  expected  to  interact  with  this  medication.  Subjects  participating  in  the  CRVO  clinical 
development  program  of  VEGF  Trap-Eye  received  treatment  for  a  variety  of  diseases  common  to 
this study population including diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, glaucoma, end-stage 
renal disease, pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and peripheral artery disease.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Week 0 - Week 24 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of the study drug was higher in the sham group 
(10  subjects  [7.0%])  than  in  the  VTE2Q4  group  (3  subjects  [1.4%]).  No  TEAE  lead  to 
discontinuation of more than one VTE2Q4-treated subject. 
Week  0-Week  24  -  Treatment-Emergent  Adverse  Events  Causing  Discontinuation  From 
the Study Drug (Safety Analysis Set) 
Week 24 - Week 52 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of the study drug was similar in the three groups 
(sham 3.5%; sham+VTE PRN 0%; VTE2Q4+PRN 2.4%). 
The  TEAEs  that  led  to  study  drug  discontinuation  in  the  VTE2Q4+PRN  group  were  iris 
neovascularization,  macular  ischemia,  retinal  vein  occlusion,  vitreous  hemorrhage,  and  hepatic 
function abnormal (1 subject [0.5%] each). 
Week  24-Week  52  -  Treatment-Emergent  Adverse  Events  Causing  Discontinuation  From 
the Study Drug (Subjects who Completed Week 24) 
Over  the  full  52  weeks  of  the  studies,  approximately  6%  of  the  total  subjects  discontinued  the 
studies for a TEAE; 10% of subjects from the sham group, 8.1% from the sham+VTE PRN group, 
and 3.7% from the VTE2Q4+PRN group.

As  expected,  in  the  24-week  phase,  the  rate  of  discontinuations  is  higher  in  the  Sham  group 
compared  to  active  group.  Within  the  52  weeks  period,  among  patients  treated  with  Eylea,  only 
isolate events led to discontinuation. 
Post marketing experience 
The post marketing experience in USA has been reported in the RMP, the main point identified is 
related to twenty cases of endophthalmitis. 
2.6.2.   Discussion on clinical safety 
The  clinical  safety  analysis  is  based on  data  pooled  from  the  two phase  III  studies  (GALILEO  and 
COPERNICUS).  VEGF  Trap-Eye  was  administered  intravitreally  in  275  patients  in  the  studies  to 
support indication. The safety of product was also already assessed in the indication of age-related 
macular degeneration. 
Extent  of  exposure:  overall,  366  patients  were  randomised,  360  received  at  least  one  injection, 
including  68  only  sham-treated  patients.  The  mean  exposure  was  327  days  with  a  total  of  4093 
injections (sham or VTE).  
Long-term  safety  data:  limited  information  is  available  beyond  the  Week-52  endpoint.  No  pooled 
data analysis of adverse events was provided.  
Adverse  events:  With  the  2  safety  studies  pooled,  the  overall  incidence  of  ocular  and  non-ocular 
effects seems to be similar between sham and VEGF Trap eye groups.  
Ocular effects: 
Ocular TEAEs in the study eye were generally consistent with the expected adverse consequences 
of  the  injection  procedure  in  VEGF  Trap  eye  group  (IOP  increased,  conjunctival  hemorrhage,  eye 
pain) or with disease progression (macular edema, visual acuity reduced).  
- In the  first 24 weeks, macular edema and  visual acuity reduced are more frequent in the sham 
groups than in the VTE2Q4 group, as expected.  
- From 24 to 52 weeks, these symptoms of disease worsening became significantly more frequent 
in the VTE2Q4 group than in the sham groups.  
-  After  52  weeks,  the  events  of  macular  edema  were  still  significantly  more  frequent  in  the 
VTE2Q4+PRN  group  compared  to  sham+VTE  PRN  group  in  both  studies.  As  this  may  point  to  a 
reactivation of disease in the PRN phase of treatment (as none were reported for these subjects in 
the  first  24  weeks  of  the  study),  the  CHMP  and  PRAC  requested  that  these  events  will  be  closely 
monitored in the PSURs. 
One  case  of  endophthalmitis  was  reported  on  a  total  of  2728  injections.  The  overall  rate  of 
endophthalmitis was thereby 0.04% per injection which was considered acceptable. 
Few  ocular  adverse  events  were  considered  by  the  investigators  to  be  drug-related  in  the  VTE 
group: eye irritation, cataract subcapsular, macular fibrosis, macular ischemia, and macular edema; 
and in the sham+VTE PRN group: 1 case of cataract. 
The  relationship  between  the  study  drug  and these  effects  has  not  been  firmly  established  based 
on the CRVO data, but will be closely monitored in the PSURs.  
Non-ocular events: 
In general, non-ocular TEAEs were similar between the treatment groups.  
The  most  common  TEAEs  in  both  treatment  groups  were  nasopharyngitis,  hypertension  and 
headache. Those adverse effects were already reported in data of the initial marketing application 
for VEGF Trap-Eye for AMD.  
Concerning  arterial  thromboembolic  events,  the  incidence  was  similar  between  the  groups.  Only 
one  subject  in  VTE  group  experienced  myocardial  infarction  and  two  subjects  in  sham  group. 
Taking  into  account  the  potential  role  of  VEGF  in  the  systemic  cardiovascular  events,  a  possible 
relation  between  myocardial  infarction  and  VEGF  Trap  eye  cannot  be  excluded.  During  the  initial 
marketing  application  for  VEGF  Trap-Eye  for  AMD,  the  arterial  thromboembolic  events  were 
identified as important potential risk and are currently monitored in the PASS study. 
Immunogenicity: The risk of immunogenicity reported in CRVO studies appears to be low.

Discontinuations: As expected, in the 24-week phase, the rate of discontinuations is higher in the 
Sham group compared to active group. The most common ocular TEAEs leading to discontinuation 
in the full 52 weeks were glaucoma, iris neovascularization, retinal neovascularization, and vitreous 
hemorrhage. 
2.6.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of aflibercept in CRVO indication appears to be similar to the data provided in the 
already approved AMD indication. 
However, the size of the safety database is limited (275 patients treated) and is therefore not able 
to  detect  rare  adverse events.  Extension phase  data  have  been  provided  as required  and  no  new 
signal emerged. 
Concerns  were  raised  on  a  higher  incidence  of  macular  edema  and  visual  acuity  reduced  in  the 
Eylea  groups  compared  to  Sham  groups  after  the  24  weeks  of  treatment  and  change  to  PRN 
injections  (as  needed).  These  will  be  monitored  in  the  PSURs,  as  they  might  point  out  to  a 
reactivation of the disease. 
Only one case of ATE (Arterial thromboembolic events) has been reported during the CRVO studies, 
but  these  remain  in  principle  a  safety  concern  for  the  anti-VEGF  class,  and  are  monitored  in  the 
already requested PASS study.  
2.6.4.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The next data lock point will be 30 Nov 2013.  
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.  
2.7.  Risk management plan 
The  MAH  submitted  an  updated  Risk  Management  Plan  within  this  variation  procedure  in  order  to 
include the data on integrated analysis of two phase III studies GALILEO and COPERNICUS. 
2.8.  PRAC advice 
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 10.0, the PRAC considers by 
consensus that the risk management system for aflibercept (EYLEA) in the treatment of  
• 
Neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in adults 
and the proposed indication of 
• 
Visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion 
(CRVO) in adults 
is acceptable.  
The following minor points should be taken into account in the next update of the RMP (v.11.0), to 
be submitted with the closing sequence of the procedure: 
• 
Part VI, table 1.3 should remain empty. 
Part III, table 5.1 should mention the safety concerns medication error and off-label use 
• 
addressed by the observational PASS to evaluate patient and physician knowledge. 
Advice on conditions of the marketing authorisation  
The PRAC considers that changes to the conditions of the Marketing Authorisation are necessary 
and advises that the following should be conditions of the Marketing Authorisation.

Section 4.9 Overdose: 
In clinical trials doses of up to 
4 mg in monthly intervals 
have been used and isolated 
cases of overdoses with 8 mg 
occurred. Overdosing with 
increased injection volume 
may increase intraocular 
pressure. Therefore, in case of 
overdose intraocular pressure 
should be monitored and if 
deemed necessary by the 
treating physician, adequate 
treatment should be initiated.

visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.6 and 14 of 
the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
A full readability test was conducted in March 2011 on the PL for Eylea 2 mg Solution for injection 
vial PL (“parent”). The results of this parent user test applied equally to the 2 mg prefilled syringe 
presentation.  
As  a  result  of  the  type  II  variation  submission  for  the  new  central  retinal  vein  occlusion  (CRVO) 
indication  for  Eylea  in  the  prefilled  syringe  and  vial  presentations  (“daughter”  PLs),  no  full  user 
consultation but only a focussed testing report was required by EMA. The methodology of the focus 
test conforms to European recommendations and the results are satisfactory. The focus test report 
submitted by the applicant is acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The  clinical  CRVO  development  program  for  Eylea  was  in  compliance  with  the  Scientific  Advices 
received, at a time before any anti-VEGF product (or corticoids) was registered as a treatment of 
ME  associated  to  CRVO.  Therefore,  a  design  using  a  “Sham”  as  comparator  was  considered 
appropriate  at  the  time  of  the  advice.  With  the  recent  EU  registrations  of  ranibizumab, 
dexamethasone  and  triamcinolone  as  CRVO  treatments,  a  study  with  an  active  comparator  is 
missing in the Eylea CRVO clinical program, allowing no direct comparison between the two drugs.  
Two clinical studies (GALILEO & COPERNICUS) were conducted as support to this application. 
Both studies were designed to primarily  demonstrate  the  superiority of  Eylea (VTE2Q4) over 
sham  injections  on  the  best-corrected  visual  acuity  (BCVA)  assessed  at  week  24  by  the  ETDRS 
chart in subjects with macular edema secondary to CRVO.  
Both the COPERNICUS and GALILEO trials met their primary endpoint, and many of the secondary 
endpoints reached statistical significance. 
In  the  GALILEO  study  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  gained  at  least  15  letters  in  BCVA 
(considering  discontinued  subjects  before  Week  24  judged  as  failures)  in  the  VTE  2Q4  group 
(60.2%;  FAS)  was  statistically  superior  to  the  proportion  in  the  sham  group  (22.1%;  FAS),  
reaching a clinically relevant difference of 38.3%(p<0.0001) in favour of the VTE 2Q4 group.  
In  COPERNICUS,  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  gained  at  least  15  letters  in  BCVA  in  the  VEGF 
Trap-Eye  2Q4  group  (56.1%)  was  statistically  significantly  superior  to  the proportion  in  the  sham 
group (12.3%) reaching a clinically relevant difference of 45.4% (p<0.0001) in favour of the VTE 
2Q4 group. All sensitivity analyses confirmed the superiority of Eylea 2Q4 over Sham. 
Secondary  efficacy  analyses  at  Week  24  were  conducted  to  test  for  superiority  of  VTE2Q4 
treatment to sham using a hierarchical sequence of statistical hypotheses testing in order to control 
for multiplicity as follows: 
1)  Change  in  BCVA  letter  score;  2)  in  CRT;  3)  proportion  of  subjects  progressing  to  any 
neovascularisation;  4)  change  in  total  NEI  VFQ-25  score  and  change  in  EQ-5D  score  for  GALILEO 
only.  
Whilst  Copernicus  study  showed  robust  statistical  significance  across  all  visual,  anatomical  and 
functional  endpoints  by  week  24,  and  favourable  changes  in  distance  subscores  and  dependency 
subscores, Galileo study failed to show the difference in the proportion of subjects who developed 
neovascularisation,  in  terms  of  quality  of  life  improvements  as  measured  by  EQ-5D  questionnaire 
(the  latter  has  not  been  utilized  in  Copernicus  study)  and  changes  in  distance  activity  and 
dependency subscores.  
Some  differences  in  the  behaviour  of  the  sham  group  in  the  two  studies,  with  subjects  in  the 
GALILEO  sham  group  performing  better  than  the  COPERNICUS  sham  subjects,  may  explain  the 
slightly better results observed in COPERNICUS study (45.4%) than in GALILEO study (38.3%) for 
the primary variable.

In the second phase  of the studies, between 24 and 52 weeks, the monthly proactive dosing was 
switched  to  a  PRN  (reactive)  dosing  based  on  prespecified  retreatment  criteria  but  a  monthly 
monitoring was maintained. Results demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant superiority 
of  VTE2Q4+PRN  over  Sham  (GALILEO)  or  over  Sham+VTE  PRN  (COPERNICUS)  in  Proportion  of 
Subjects  who  Gained  15  or  More  Letters.  However,  in  this  second  six  months  phase  of  studies,  a 
slight  (but  non  clinically  significant)  decrease  of  approximately  1  letter  in  BCVA  from  the  gains 
achieved  at  Week  24  was  observed  in  the  VTE2Q4+PRN  treatment  group  and  in  both  individual 
studies.  Overall,  progression  to  neovascularization  in  both  studies  was  very  limited  with  only  few 
patients requiring a PRP treatment. 
Subgroup analyses in both studies showed that there are no restrictions regarding efficacy of VEGF 
Trap-Eye in relation to organ function such as renal impairment, liver function, or diabetes status. 
Follow-up periods were up to Week 76 in GALILEO and up to Week 100 in COPERNICUS: 
In  COPERNICUS  and  GALILEO  studies  regarding  the  VTE  2Q4+PRN  groups,  there  was  a  tendency 
towards  deterioration  of  vision  and  central  retinal  thickness  throughout  the  respective  Week  52-
100 or 52-76 follow up periods. 
In  the  Sham+PRN  group,  improvements  observed  during  the  Week  24-52  period  with  the 
beginning of active treatment, also tended to diminish throughout the follow up period. 
Degradation  in  results  during  the  follow  up  period  of  treatment  may  be  a  consequence  of  the 
extension of the monitoring intervals after week 52. 
The  posology  was  extensively  discussed:  beyond  Week  24,  with  the  PRN  dosing  scheme,  visual 
acuity gains were largely maintained up to Week 52 although a not clinically significant degradation 
of vision (about 1 letter) was observed in both studies for the VTE 2Q4+PRN groups. Although the 
proposed  proactive  Q8  regimen  represents  an  “average”  regimen  that  may  be  well  adapted  to 
many  patients,  the  post-hoc  analysis  submitted  by  the  MAH  to  support  the  bimonthly  dosing 
schedule for long term treatment showed that there is a number of patients who may benefit from 
more  administrations,  and  a  number  of  other  patients  for  whom  fewer  administrations  would  be 
sufficient. In both cases, the proposed proactive Q8 regimen may be less than optimal.  
Verification of the clinical response at 3-month time-point was therefore required by CHMP. In this 
way, non-responders will not continue receiving treatment after an initial, futile 3-month course.  
If  the  clinician  decides  to  continue  treatment,  the  patient  should  receive  monthly  injections  until 
visual  and  anatomic  outcomes  are  stable  for  three  monthly  assessments.  This  will  reduce  the 
probability of under treating patients who would still benefit from monthly injections (including the 
15%  who  still  gain  benefit  after  3  months).  When  stability  is  reached,  treatment  may  be 
discontinued  or  continued  with  longer  intervals.  In  case  of  deterioration,  treatment  should  be 
resumed. 
The  final  agreed  wording  for  section  4.2  is  considered  relevant  for  clinical  practice,  allowing 
discontinuation  of  treatment  in  patients  who  would  not  benefit  or  have  reached  stabilization,  and 
an  extension  of  the  treatment  interval  for  patients  who  are  stable  and  still  under  treatment.  The 
CHMP  considered  that  the  revised  posology  fits  well  with  the  current  clinical  practice  and  allows 
adaptation  of  treatment  for  all  patients,  hence  avoiding  as  much  as  possible,  over  or  under-
treatments. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
A higher incidence of “macular edema and visual acuity reduced” in the Eylea groups, compared to 
Sham  groups,  was  observed  after  the  24  weeks  of  monthly  treatment,  with  the  change  to  PRN 
dosing  injections  and  in  the  extension  phase.  Macular  edema  and  visual  acuity  reduced  are 
themselves symptoms of CRVO disease, and could point to a worsening of the disease. Therefore, 
these will be further monitored through PSURS. 
For  historical  reasons,  this  program  did  not  include comparative  data  to  ranibizumab  since  it  was 
not  registered  for  CRVO  before  2010.  A  direct  comparison  with  an  active  comparator  (ranizumab 
EU  CRVO  registration  was  in  2011)  is  therefore  lacking  in  the  present  CRVO  clinical  program, 
preventing any direct comparison on potential differences between the two drugs.

Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
Based  on  the  data  pooled  from  the  two  phase  III  studies  (GALILEO  and  COPERNICUS)  submitted  
as support to the extension of indication to patients with macular edema linked to CRVO, the safety 
profile  of  EYLEA  assessed  for  the  275  CRVO  patients  appears  consistent  with  the  safety  profile 
previously  reported  from  the  safety  AMD  data  base.  Moreover,  pooled  safety  data  from  CRVO 
clinical  studies,  also  show  a  similar  overall  incidence  of  ocular  and  non-ocular  effects  when 
comparing  sham  and  Eylea  groups.  However,  the  size  of  the  safety  database  for  the  claimed 
indication remains limited, which precludes any detection of rare adverse events.  
Ocular treatment emergent adverse events 
The  most  common  adverse  reactions  reported  were  conjunctival  haemorrhage,  increased 
intraocular pressure and eye pain, and were related to the injection procedure.  
Only  one  case  of  endophtalmitis  has  been  reported  on  the  76/100  weeks  period.  Since  2728 
injections of VEGF Trap eye have been reported on CRVO trials, the overall rate of endophthalmitis 
was  0.04%.  Several  cases  of  Macular  fibrosis  were  reported.  This  adverse  event  is  not  currently 
listed in the SPC and the MAH was requested to closely monitor it in the future PSURs. 
A higher incidence of “macular edema and visual acuity reduced” in the Eylea groups compared to 
Sham  groups  was  observed  after  the  24  weeks  of  monthly  treatment,  with  the  change  to  PRN 
dosing  injections.  Those  effects  were  also  observed  in  the  extension  phase.  Macular  edema  and 
visual acuity reduced are symptoms of CRVO disease and could point to a worsening of the disease. 
Therefore, these will be further monitored through PSURS. 
Non-ocular treatment emergent adverse events 
The  most  common  TEAEs  in  both  treatment  groups  were  nasopharyngitis,  hypertension  and 
headache , already reported in AMD studies.  
Arterial  thromboembolic  events  (ATEs)  were  rarely  reported  in  CRVO  patients  and  the  incidence 
was similar between the groups. Since ATEs are identified as class safety concern for all anti-VEGF 
products,  and  they  were  identified  as  an  important  potential  risk  during  the  initial  marketing 
application for VEGF Trap-Eye for AMD, the ATEs have been added to section 4.8 of the SmPC and 
will be monitored in a PASS study. 
The  immunogenicity  was  low,  and  no  sample  demonstrated  activity  in  a  neutralizing  antibody 
analysis. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There are no new safety concerns identified for Eylea when administered to patients with CRVO. 
Nevertheless,  previously  a  concern  was  raised  regarding  potential  anti-VEGF  therapies  used  in 
CRVO to induce retinal ischemia. The proportion of non-perfused subjects was low in both studies 
with  VEGF-Eye-Trap,  however  there  was  no  reported  exacerbation  in  retinal  ischemia.  On  the 
contrary,  the  treatment  has  showed  trends  in  improved  capillary  perfusion  in  at  least  one  study. 
The  observation  in  Copernicus  study  may  suggest  that  VEGF-Trap  could  have  some  favourable 
effect on perfusion status. However this finding has not been replicated in Galileo study (in which 
neovascularisation  events  have  occurred).  To  what  extent  this  finding  is  attributed  to  a  different 
patient population enrolled into VEGF-Eye-Trap program or whether it could have been linked to a 
low  proportion  of  non-ischemic  patients  in  both  studies,  it  remains  unknown.  It  is  also  unknown 
whether  findings  from  VEGF-Trap-Eye  program  may  alleviate  concerns  over  anti-VEGF-associated 
risk of retina ischemia exacerbation. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Both  the  COPERNICUS  and  GALILEO  trials  met  their  primary  endpoint  with  high  statistical 
significance, and many of the secondary endpoints reached statistical significance. 
The approved posology reflects clinical practice and will reduce the probability of continuing to treat 
patients  who  will  not  benefit,  while  avoiding  under  treating  patients  who  would  still  benefit  from 
monthly injections.

For  historical  reasons,  this  program  did  not  include  comparative  data  to  an  active  comparator  or 
other CRVO treatments, as these were not registered before 2010.  
No  new  safety  concerns  were  identified  for  Eylea  when  administered  to  patients  with  CRVO 
whereas  a  highly  significant  efficacy  has  been  demonstrated  in  both  pivotal  studies  in  the  initial 
phase of the studies. In both studies, despite certain differences between studies in the severity of 
patients  recruited,  efficacy  tends  to  decline  with  the  long  term  treatments.  The  reason  for  such 
decline  over  time  may  be  explained  by  the  extension  of  the  treatment  interval  and  the  lack  of  a 
sufficiently strict rhythm for monitoring. 
Balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Patients with CRVO typically present with sudden, unilateral, painless loss of vision. The degree of 
vision loss depends on the extent of retinal involvement and on macular perfusion status. Published 
data indicate that if untreated, one third to three quarters of patients may improve their VA over 2-
3 years, but a limited proportion of subjects gains > 10 letters of VA (<20% year1 to <40% year 
3) and a significant proportion (>20%) of subjects ends up with a poor VA (<20/200) after 3 years. 
If treated with laser, there are no major short-term benefits with regards to an improved vision in 
CRVO.   
The  primary  endpoint  evaluation  carried  out  at  6  months  with  monthly  dosing  and  monitoring 
demonstrated  highly  statistical  significance  and  clinically  relevant  outcome  at  24  weeks.  The 
submitted  data  showed  a  15  letter  gain  or  more  in  58.5-61.2  %  of  patients  after  6  months  and 
55.3-58.3%  of  patients  at  12  months  with  monthly  monitoring.  Overall,  the  treatment  effect  was 
sustained up to week 52. Additional post hoc analyses considering also the week 76/100 data PRN 
data tend to show that the decline of vision was enhanced from Week 52 onwards when the every 
4 weeks monitoring interval was extended to every 8 or 12 weeks.  
No  major  safety  concerns  precluding  the  extension  of  the  marketing  authorisation  of  Eylea  to 
patients with CRVO have been identified by the CHMP.  
Post-hoc  analysis  of  the  proportion  of  responders  suggests  that  subjects  who  demonstrate  a 
positive slope during initial 3 months will exhibit improvement, and those who exhibit decline will 
show further decline.  
Thus, a  verification of the response at 3 month time-point was requested in the posology. In this 
way,  non-responders  will  not  continue  receiving  treatment  after initial  futile 3  month  course.  
The approved posology will also reduce the probability of  under treating patients who still benefit 
from monthly injections (including covering those 15% who still gain benefit after 3 months). This 
dosing  scheme  reflects  the  current  clinical  practice  and  allows  an  adaptation  of  treatment  for  all 
patients, hence avoiding as much as possible, over or under-treatments. 
No  new  and  unexpected  adverse  events  emerged  as  compared  to  those  identified  for  AMD.  
The pharmacovigilance plan was adapted to include the CRVO indication. 
4.  Recommendation  
 The application for Eylea in the treatment of CRVO is approvable since all other concerns and 
major objections have been resolved. 
Based  on  the  above  data,  the  CHMP  recommends  for  approval  the  extension  of  the  indication  of 
Eylea to: 
Visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) (see 
section 5.1) 
Revisions  to  the  proposed  product  information  as  recommended  by  the  CHMP  has  been  also 
implemented (See Annex). 
The CHMP has recommended also revisions to the proposed product information.

Final Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable 
and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning 
the following change: 
Variation accepted 
C.1.6 a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - 
Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification 
of an approved one 
Type 
II 
Extension of indication for the treatment of visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to 
central retinal vein occlusion.  
As a consequence, update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC in order 
to add information relevant to the new indication. Annex II and the Package Leaflet are updated 
accordingly. 
Additionally the MAH took the opportunity to correct typographical mistakes throughout the PI. 
The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet.

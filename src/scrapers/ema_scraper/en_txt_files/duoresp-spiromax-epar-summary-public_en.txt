DuoResp Spiromax (budesonide / formoterol) 
An overview of DuoResp Spiromax and why it is authorised in the EU 
What is DuoResp Spiromax and what is it used for? 
DuoResp Spiromax is a medicine that contains the active substances budesonide and formoterol. It is 
used to treat asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and above for whom a combination 
product is considered appropriate. It can be used in patients whose disease is not adequately 
controlled with other asthma medicines called corticosteroids and ‘short-acting beta-2 agonists’ taken 
by inhalation, or in patients whose disease is adequately controlled with corticosteroids and ‘long-
acting beta-2 agonists’ (such as budesonide and formoterol) taken by inhalation.  
DuoResp Spiromax is also used to relieve the symptoms of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) in adults who have had exacerbations (flare–ups) of the disease in the past despite 
regular treatment. COPD is a long-term disease in which the airways and air sacs inside the lungs 
become damaged or blocked, leading to difficulty in breathing. 
DuoResp Spiromax is a ‘hybrid medicine’. This means that it is similar to a ‘reference medicine’ 
containing the same active substances, but DuoResp Spiromax is given using a different inhaler. The 
reference medicine for DuoResp Spiromax is Symbicort Turbohaler. 
How is DuoResp Spiromax used? 
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription. It is available as an inhalation powder in a 
portable inhaler device, and each inhalation provides a fixed dose of the medicine. DuoResp Spiromax 
160/4.5 microgram (160 micrograms of budesonide and 4.5 micrograms of formoterol) can be used for 
the regular treatment of asthma and when needed as a reliever. It can also be used for the treatment 
of COPD symptoms in adult patients. The higher strength, DuoResp Spiromax 320/9 micrograms 
(320 micrograms of budesonide and 9 micrograms of formoterol), can only be used for the regular 
treatment of asthma and for the treatment of COPD symptoms. 
For the regular treatment of asthma, the recommended dose is 1 to 4 inhalations twice a day, 
depending on the strength being used, age and the severity of the asthma. As asthma reliever 
therapy, patients can take 1 or 2 additional inhalations of DuoResp Spiromax 160/4.5 microgram only 
to relieve their symptoms. If patients need to take more than 8 inhalations per day, it is recommended 
they speak to their doctor to have their asthma therapy reconsidered.

How does DuoResp Spiromax work? 
The two active substances in DuoResp Spiromax are well known and are present in several medicines 
used to treat asthma and COPD, either alone or in combination with other medicines. 
Budesonide belongs to a group of anti-inflammatory medicines known as corticosteroids. It works in a 
similar way to naturally occurring corticosteroid hormones, reducing the activity of the immune system 
by attaching to receptors in various types of immune cell. This leads to a reduction in the release of 
substances that are involved in the inflammation process, such as histamine, thereby helping to keep 
the airways clear and allowing the patient to breathe more easily. 
Formoterol is a long-acting beta-2 agonist. It works by attaching to receptors known as beta-2 
receptors found in the muscles of the airways. When it attaches to these receptors, it causes the 
muscles to relax, which keeps the airways open and helps with the patient’s breathing.  
How has DuoResp Spiromax been studied? 
Studies on the benefits and risks of the active substances in the authorised uses have already been 
carried out with the reference medicine, Symbicort Turbohaler, and do not need to be repeated for 
DuoResp Spiromax.  
As for every medicine, the company provided studies on the quality of DuoResp Spiromax. The 
company also carried out studies that showed that it is ‘bioequivalent’ to the reference medicine. Two 
medicines are bioequivalent when they produce the same levels of the active substance in the body. 
What are the benefits and risks of DuoResp Spiromax? 
Because DuoResp Spiromax is a hybrid medicine and is bioequivalent to the reference medicine, its 
benefits and risks are taken as being the same as the reference medicine’s. 
Why is DuoResp Spiromax authorised in the EU? 
The European Medicines Agency concluded that, in accordance with EU requirements, DuoResp 
Spiromax 160/4.5 microgram and 320/9 micrograms have been shown to have comparable quality and 
to be bioequivalent to the corresponding strengths of Symbicort Turbohaler. Therefore, the Agency’s 
view was that, as for Symbicort Turbohaler, the benefit outweighs the identified risks and it can be 
authorised for use in the EU.  
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
DuoResp Spiromax? 
Recommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe 
and effective use of DuoResp Spiromax have been included in the summary of product characteristics 
and the package leaflet. 
As for all medicines, data on the use of DuoResp Spiromax are continuously monitored. Suspected side 
effects reported with the medicine are carefully evaluated and any necessary action taken to protect 
patients.

2  Scientific discussion 
2.1  Introduction 
Levetiracetam  Actavis  is  a  generic  medicinal  product  containing  levetiracetam  as  active  substance. 
Four strengths have been developed; 250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg and 1000 mg film-coated tablets. The 
reference medicinal product Keppra has been centrally authorized on 29 September 2000 and exists as 
film-coated tablets of 250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg and 1000 mg and as oral solution (100 mg/ml) and as 
concentrate for solution for infusion (100 mg/ml).  
Levetiracetam is a chemical entity related to piracetam, a nootropic drug. Initial research was directed 
primarily  towards  indications  where  piracetam  and  piracetam-like  compounds  had  shown  to  be  of 
potential benefit (cognition, anxiety disorders). When the particular antiepileptic profile of the drug was 
recognised, its development was oriented towards epilepsy as a new indication in 1991. 
The exact mechanism by which levetiracetam acts to treat epilepsy is unknown, however, the drug 
binds to a synaptic vesicle protein, SV2A which is believed to impede nerve conduction across 
synapses. Levetiracetam is indicated for the treatment of Epilepsy.  
The  efficacy  and  safety  of  levetiracetam  has  been  demonstrated  in  several  well-controlled  studies.  A 
summary of these studies can be found in the EPAR of the reference product Keppra.  
According  to  the  legislation  the  applicant  shall  not  be  required  to  provide  the  results  of  pre-clinical 
tests  and  clinical  trials  if  he  can  demonstrate  that  the  medicinal  product  is  a  generic  of  a  reference 
product, which is authorised for 6/10 years in a EU member state or in the Community. Bioequivalence 
to the reference product Keppra was demonstrated by one bioequivalence study at single dose under 
fasting  conditions.  The  studies  were  performed  in  healthy  volunteers.  One  study  was  performed  with 
the 1000 mg tablets.  
The  indication  proposed  for  Levetiracetam  Actavis  is  identical  to  the  indication  of  the  reference 
medicinal product.  
The therapeutic indication of Levetiracetam Actavis is: 
Levetiracetam Actavis is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or 
without secondary generalisation in patients from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy. 
Levetiracetam Actavis is indicated as adjunctive therapy 
• 
• 
• 
in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, 
children and infants from 1 month of age with epilepsy. 
in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with 
Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy. 
in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 
12 years of age with Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy. 
Levetiracetam Actavis is presented in packs of 20, 30, 50, 60, 100, 120 and 200 film-coated tablets for 
each strength; 250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg and 1000 mg and in bottles of 30, 100 and 200 film-coated 
tablets  for  each  strength.  The  proposed  pack  sizes  are  consistent  with  the  dosage  regimen  and 
duration of use.  
2.2  Quality aspects

2.2.2  Active  Substance 
The INN name of the active substance is levetiracetam and the chemical name (S)-2-(2-oxopyrrolidin-
1-yl)butanamide. The molecular formula of active substance is C8H14N2O2 its relative molecular mass 
170.2 and its structural formula is shown below. 
Levetiracetam  appears  as  a  white  to  off-white  non-hygroscopic  powder,  very  soluble  in  water  and 
soluble in methanol and in acetone. The pKa of levetiracetam is < -2 and can not be determined with 
accuracy due to the chemical instability of the protonated form. 
It  has  an  asymmetric  centre  with  S-configuration  and  it  is  controlled  by  the  test  for  specific  optical 
rotation. The R- isomer is controlled by HPLC test. 
Levetiracetam  produced  by  the  proposed  active  substance  supplier  is  of  crystalline  form.  The 
consistency of the form has been established by XRD on three consecutive batches. 
Manufacture 
The  active  substance  is  supported  by  an  ASMF.  The  manufacturing  process  has  been  described  in 
sufficient  detail  and  yields  the  desired  crystal  form.  If  required,  reprocessing  of  any  intermediate  or 
drug substance batch is foreseen in accordance with ICH Q7A guideline by repeating all or part of the 
related process step. 
Sufficient information has been presented regarding the critical steps and intermediates, including in-
process controls (IPC). 
Sufficient  information  regarding  the  carry  over  of  related  substances  including  the  impurities  with 
potential genotoxic alert has been presented and suitable specifications are proposed. 
Specification 
Levetiracetam is described in the last edition of the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.). The Ph. Eur. 
monograph  specifications  have  been  implemented  by  the  finished  product  manufacturer,  where 
applicable, to control of the active substance. The specification includes tests and limits for appearance 
(visual),  solubility  (Ph.Eur.),  appearance  of  solution  (Ph.Eur.),  identification  (IR),  enantiomeric  purity 
(Ph.Eur.), specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), sulphated ash 
(Ph.Eur.),  heavy  metals  (Ph.  Eur.),  water  content  (Ph.  Eur.),  residual  solvents  (GC)  and  particle  size 
(laser diffraction). 
In-house analytical procedures have been described and validated. Impurities have been evaluated and 
found to be acceptable from the safety viewpoint. 
The certificates of analysis of three consecutive commercial scale batches manufactured by the active 
substance manufacturer were enclosed to the Open Part of ASMF. The batch analysis results obtained 
according to the updated proposed specifications will also be provided by the applicant when available. 
Stability 
Stability studies were performed on three commercial scale batches for up to 24 months at long-term 
conditions (25°C/60%RH) and for six months in accelerated conditions (40°C/75%RH). Supportive 
data for another three smaller scale batches stored for 60 months at long-term conditions and for six 
months in accelerated conditions have also been presented. The data submitted support the proposed 
re-test period.

2.2.3  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Levetiracetam is  an  antiepileptic  drug  available marketed  as  250  mg,  500  mg,  750  mg  and  1000  mg 
tablets. 
The  aim  of  the  formulation  study  was  to  develop  immediate-release  product  lighter  and  smaller,  but 
with  similar  quality  as  the  reference  product  on  the  market  Keppra.  All  the  strengths  are  dose 
proportional.   
The  particle  size  of  the  active  was  found  to  have  a  considerable  influence  on  disintegration  and 
dissolution. The finer particle size gives faster disintegration/dissolution at all time points compared to 
the coarser material.  
The  formulation  was  modified  to  ensure  better  manufacturability  to  improve  dissolution  rate  and  to 
improve pharmacotechnical characteristics. The wetting was adjusted, a different grade of disintegrant 
was  used,  the  amount  of  lubricant  was  optimised.  These  changes  improved  the  disintegration  time 
significantly. 
Active substance from two sources has been used initially and based on stability results and technical 
properties the most favourable material and supplier was selected. 
The  excipients  used  in  the  tablet  formulation  as  proposed  for  marketing  are  well  known  and  widely 
used in the pharmaceutical industry and except for tablet coating agent Opadry II, all other substances 
are  described  in  the  European  Pharmacopoeia.  No  incompatibilities  between  them  and  the  drug 
substance are known. 
In-vitro dissolution profiles of the biobatches at three different pH values and in water were presented. 
The  results  revealed  that  there  is  no  critical  difference  between  the  dissolution  of  the  test  and 
reference products at all 3 buffers tested as levetiracetam is very soluble at these pH values. 
The manufacturing method is a standard wet granulation method. 
The proposed packaging materials are Al/PVC blisters and HDPE container with LDPE cap. 
Adventitious agents 
There are no excipients of human or animal origin in Levetiracetam Actavis tablets. 
Manufacture of the product 
The method of manufacture is wet granulation, followed by drying and mixing and tablet compression. 
The  final  step  is  coating  of  the  tablets.  The  manufacturing  process  has  been  described  in  sufficient 
detail.  
The  process  validation  schemes  of  the  drug  products  were  presented  and  the  manufacturing  process 
will  be  validated  according  to  the  process  validation  protocol  on  first  three  consecutive  production 
batches of each strength. 
Product Specification  
Adequate release and shelf-life specification have been presented for the finished product and include 
tests  and  limits  for:  appearance  (visual  examination),  identification  (levetiracetam  HPLC,  UV), 
dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.),  Disintegration  (Ph.  Eur.),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (HPLC), 
related substances (HPLC), microbial test (Ph. Eur.), resistance to crushing (Ph. Eur.), average weight 
(Ph. Eur.) and identification of colorants. 
Analytical procedures are described and validated.  
Batch data has been provided for two pilot scale tablet batches of each of the four strengths (including 
the biobatches). Batch analysis results are conforming to specifications.

Stability of the product 
The  formal  stability  program  consists  of  two  pilot  scale  batches  of  each  strength,  packed  in  the  two 
proposed packaging materials. Thirty-six months results at 25±2°C/60±5% RH, twelve months results 
at  30±2°C/65±5%  RH  and  six  months  results  at  40±2°C/75±5%  RH  are  available  for  the  pilot  scale 
batches manufactured with drug substance from the proposed active substance supplier and packed in 
the two proposed packaging materials.  
Stability in bulk 
A  bulk  stability  study  was  conducted  for  6  months.  The  formal  stability  program  consists  of  one  pilot 
scale  batches  of  each  strength.  The  purpose  was  to  monitor  the  stability  of  the  product  in  bulk 
container (plastic bags inside a 15 L bulk container for 15 L container for 6 months, tested at 0, 3 and 
6 months time points. The same analytical methods were used in the stability program as for release. 
The shelf-life specification was followed in this study. 
Stability of the open bottle packaging 
Tablets  were  stored  in  HDPE  bottle  for  6  months  at  25°C/60%RH,  tested  up  to  6  months.  The  same 
analytical  methods  were  used  in  the  stability  program  as  for  release.  The  shelf-life  specification  was 
followed in this study. No significant changes or out of specifications results were observed. 
Photostability studies  
In  order  to  assess  the  stability  of  Levetiracetam  Actavis  tablets  against  degradation  by  light  a 
photostability test according to the current ICH Q1B Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Active 
Substances and Medicinal Products has been carried on. Provided data have been found sufficient. 
Based on the overall data it can be concluded that the proposed shelf life and storage conditions of the 
finished product in the packaging described can be accepted. 
2.2.4  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.2.5  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the  MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
Drug substance 
The batch analysis results obtained according to the updated specifications should be provided when 
available. 
Drug product 
Process validation report for commercial batches of the finished product will be finalised by the end of 
August 2011 and the report should be submitted as soon as available.

2.3  Non- Clinical aspects   
2.3.1  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.3.2  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Levetiracetam Actavis is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the 
combined sales volumes for all Levetiracetam containing products and the exposure of the 
environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. The 
CHMP agreed with the applicant’s justification for not providing an ERA. 
2.4  Clinical Aspects  
2.4.1  Introduction 
This is an abridged application for film-coated tablets containing Levetiracetam. To support the 
marketing authorisation application the applicant conducted 1 bioequivalence study with cross-over 
design under fasting conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment. 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as efficacy and safety of Levetiracetam based on published literature; this was considered 
acceptable. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the reference product. 
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical 
assessment Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1 in its 
current version is of particular relevance. 
GCP 
The Clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trial conducted outside the 
community was carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Exemption  
Four different strengths of Levetiracetam tablets (250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg, 1000 mg) have been 
developed by the MAH. The application for all the dosage strengths is based on one bioequivalence

The final report is dated 17/11/2006. 
Biostatistician and biostatistical institute: Mr. Mani Kandasamy, Lotus Labs Pvt. Ltd.   
Food and fluid intake: Subjects were housed in the clinical facility at least 13 hours before drug 
administration until 24 hours after drug administration. Study drug was taken after an overnight fast 
with 240ml water. The first meal was served 4 hours after drug administration; following meals were 
served at appropriate time thereafter. Water was not permitted 1 hour before until 2 hours after drug 
administration.  
Sampling schedule: 19 blood samples were collected for the assessment of Levetiracetam 
concentrations as follows: 1 hour before dosing (0, pre-dose) and at 0.17, 0.25, 0.33, 0.50, 0.67, 0.83, 
1.0, 1.33, 1.67, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 12.0, 16.0, 24.0 and 36 hours after administration of study 
drug.  
The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and GCP. Study sites have 
been recently inspected for GCP/GLP compliance by several international authorities. 
The CHMP considers the study design appropriate and in line with pharmacokinetic properties of 
Levetiracetam; the sampling time schedule and wash-out period is adequate taking into account the 
elimination half-life of the drug. 
Test and reference products  
Levetiracetam Actavis 1000 mg film-coated tablets  manufactured by Actavis Group PTC ehf (batch No. 
94445, batch size: 100 000 tablets, manufacturing date 13/02/2006; retest date: 08/2006) has been 
compared to Keppra 1000 mg film-coated tablets marketed by UCB Pharma S.A., Belgium (Batch No: 
0000015921, exp. date 11/2008). 
The CHMP considers that Keppra 1000 mg film-coated tablets, the reference product, is the 
appropriate choice, since it is a well-known medicinal product authorised within EU community.  
Population(s) studied   
28 healthy Indian (South Asian) male volunteers (age 18-35 years) were planned and enrolled in the 
study. 27 volunteers completed both study phases and were included in the pharmacokinetic and 
statistical analysis. No major protocol deviations were reported. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
presented and were acceptable for a bioequivalence study and for the product under investigation. 
Drop outs: Subject No.24 did not check in for Period II. 
The CHMP considers that the population was chosen according to the scientific guidelines and the 
sample size is found adequate.

Analytical methods   
Plasma concentrations of Levetiracetam were determined using a validated LC-MS/MS method.  Study 
drug was isolated from plasma by solid phase extraction. Imipramine was used as the internal 
standard.  
The calibration curve ranged from 0.7059 to 101.2009μg/ml and the LLQ was 0.7049μg/ml for 
Levetiracetam in plasma. 
The quality control samples contained 0.7270, 1.9808, 33.6871 and 76.5615μg/ml of Levetiracetam in 
plasma. 
The plasma samples were stored at -20°C until analysis in 24 analytical sequences. Within study 
validation was shown based on back-calculated concentrations of quality control (QC) samples. Long 
term stability of Levetiracetam in plasma was shown at -20°C for 85 days covering the real storage 
time of study samples (i.e. 57 days).  Analytes stability at various conditions during storage, sample 
preparation and analysis was shown according to the requirements for bio-analytical method 
validation. 
76 (~7.3%) out of the 1045 samples in the study were reanalyzed because 2 analytical sequences 
(Subjects No.3 and No.11) for Levetiracetam did not meet the SOP acceptance criteria.  
All concentration values below limit of quantification were set as zero for PK analysis.  
The CHMP considers that the analytical part of the study was performed in accordance with GLP 
principles. The handling of samples has been described in a comprehensive manner and the relevant 
SOPs were provided.  
The analytical method had been sufficiently validated (pre-study and within study) in order to 
determine the plasma levels of Levetiracetam. 
Pharmacokinetic Variables and Statistical methods  
Pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t, AUC 0-∞, AUC 0-t/AUC 0-∞, Tmax, T1/2 and K el were 
determined.  
Prima y variables were considered AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and C max.   
r
AUC 0-t was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. Non-parametric analysis of Tmax on 
untransformed data was performed using the methods of Koch. PK parameters for each individual were 
tabulated and graphically presented. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the WinNonlin 
4.1. The mean percentage of extrapolated area under the curve was lower than 20% for both test and 
reference product a
nd for all study subjects. None of the pre-dose samples contained detectable levels 
of Levetiracetam. 
Statistical analysis of the log-transformed data was performed on SAS 9.1 software using GLM 
procedure. ANOVA model included sequence, period and treatment as fixed effects and subjects nes
ted 
within sequence as random effect. Ratio of the means and 90% CI of the ratio for Cmax, AUC 0-t and

For both, AUC0-t and C max, the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of test/reference for the population 
means derived from logarithmically transformed data should lie within the conventional 80-125% 
limits. 
The CHMP considers that the pharmacokinetic parameters calculated are justified and statistical 
methods appropriate for a single dose study. Standard bioequivalence criteria are proposed for AUC0-t 
and C max.

applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3  Benefit-Risk Balance  
This application concerns a generic version of levetiracetam film coated tablets. The reference product 
Keppra is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without 
secondary generalisation in patients from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy. 
Keppra is indicated as adjunctive therapy 
- 
in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, 
children and infants from 1 month of age with epilepsy. 
- 
in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with 
Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy. 
- 
in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 
years of age with Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this generic application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient. 
One bioequivalence study under fasting conditions constitutes the basis for this application. The study 
design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with 
the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well 
as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and 
statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Levetiracetam Actavis met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with the Keppra. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters 
AUC 0-t,, AUC0-, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range 
e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrat
ed. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information.

Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Zytiga 
abiraterone acetate 
On 12 October 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Zytiga. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Janssen-Cilag International NV. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows:2 
“Zytiga is indicated with prednisone or prednisolone for: 
• 
• 
• 
the treatment of newly diagnosed high risk metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer 
(mHSPC) in adult men in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (see 
section 5.1) 
the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in adult men who are 
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation therapy in whom 
chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated (see section 5.1) 
the treatment of mCRPC in adult men whose disease has progressed on or after a docetaxel-based 
chemotherapy regimen.” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

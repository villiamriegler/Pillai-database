Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a major public health care issue worldwide and one of the principal causes 
of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is 
easily transmissible through perinatal, percutaneous, and sexual exposure. Following acute HBV 
infection, 5% to 10% of adults and up to 90% of children fail to produce an immune response 
adequate to clear the infection; these individuals become chronic carriers of the virus. Individuals who 
develop CHB are at substantial risk of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and HCC, which will afflict 
15% to 40% of patients with CHB in the absence of effective treatment. The World Health Organization 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155784/2023  
Page 6/83 
 
 
 
 
(WHO) estimates that 296 million people were living with CHB infection in 2019, with 1.5 million new 
infections each year. In 2013, an estimated 686,000 deaths were due to HBV infection, placing it 
among the top 20 causes of mortality worldwide. 
Management 
The goal of anti-HBV therapy in children, as in adults, is to improve long-term survival and quality of 
life by reducing disease progression to cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and HCC. The aim of 
oral antiviral treatment for CHB infection is to achieve and maintain suppression of viral replication to 
prevent or reduce the development of these complications.  
Most children aged 2 to < 18 years have persistently normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values 
and high levels of HBV DNA, consistent with the immune-tolerant phase. However, immune activation 
does occur in a minority of children in whom antiviral therapy can provide benefits with regard to 
halting disease progression and its complications later in childhood or during young adulthood. All 
current guidelines suggest that antiviral therapy be considered in HBeAg positive children who have 
both elevated ALT and HBV DNA levels with the goal of achieving and maintaining viral suppression 
and producing sustained HBeAg seroconversion. Although HBeAg negative CHB is less commonly seen 
in children, it is generally accepted that long-term treatment is required in the absence of confirmed 
HBsAg seroconversion in HBeAg negative children with elevated ALT and HBV DNA levels. 
Treatment options for children are similar to those for adults. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), a 
nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor with antiviral activity against both HBV and HIV, 
and entecavir (ETV), a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor, are both recommended as 
first line treatment in all major guidelines for adults with CHB. Similarly, all major guidelines updated 
since approval of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) in 2016 also list this agent as a first-line treatment in 
adults. While ETV is effective in HBV treatment-naive patients, including children aged 2 to < 18 years 
with CHB, reduced response rates are seen in patients with prior lamivudine (LAM) treatment or LAM 
resistance. Although TDF is approved for use in children and adolescent patients aged 2 to < 18 years 
with chronic HBV, bone and renal toxicities, including proximal tubulopathy and Fanconi syndrome, 
have been reported with TDF. The negative effects of TDF on bone metabolism, especially in 
adolescents and children who have not attained peak bone mass, are clinically concerning. Tenofovir 
alafenamide is currently only approved in adolescents (aged 12 years and older with body weight at 
least 35 kg) and adults. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Vemlidy 25 mg film coated tablets contain Tenofovir alafenamide as active substance. 
TAF is a phosphonamidate prodrug of tenofovir (TFV) that is more stable in plasma than TDF, and 
provides higher intracellular levels of the active phosphorylated metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate 
(TFV-DP), to target cells (e.g., HBV-infected hepatocytes and HIV-infected lymphoid cells) with 
approximately 90% lower circulating levels of TFV relative to TDF at therapeutically active doses. The 
distinct metabolism of TAF is responsible for the improved safety profile of this novel TFV prodrug 
when compared with TDF. In Studies GS-US-320-0108 and GS-US-320-0110, at Weeks 48 and 96, the 
efficacy of TAF was non-inferior to that of TDF in participants with CHB with no documented resistance, 
and TAF treatment was associated with improved bone and renal safety compared with TDF.  
TAF is currently approved for use in adult and adolescent patients with CHB weighing at least 35 kg in 
the European Union (EU) and other regions.

This application is being submitted for Vemlidy in order to expand the age range for the treatment of 
CHB to include use in paediatric patients at least 6 years of age and older weighing at least 25 kg. 
In support of the application, results from 1 clinical study (study GS-US-320-1092) in the agreed 
paediatric investigation plan (PIP) has been submitted. Study GS-US-320-1092 is an ongoing double-
blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of the safety, tolerability, PK, and antiviral activity of TAF 
administered once daily in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced adolescents and children with 
CHB. The data presented are from the interim, primary endpoint analysis for safety, efficacy, and PK, 
which was conducted when all participants in Cohort 1 (adolescents 12 to less than 18 years of age 
and weighing at least 35 kg) and Cohort 2 Group 1 (paediatric participants 6 to < 12 years of age and 
weighing at least 25 kg) had completed their Week 24 (i.e., primary endpoint) visit or prematurely 
discontinued from the study. 
2.1.3.  General comments on compliance with GCP  
The MAH has provided a statement that study GS-US-320-1092 was conducted (largely in countries 
outside the European Union) under local regulatory requirements and in accordance with recognised 
international scientific and ethical standards, including but not limited to the International Conference 
on Harmonization guideline for Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) and the original principles embodied in 
the Declaration of Helsinki. These standards are consistent with the requirements of the European 
Community Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. A full ERA 
was provided to support this extension of indication. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A full environmental risk assessment (ERA) has been provided in accordance with the Guideline on the 
Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human use [EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00]. 
Tenofovir alafenamide is a pro-drug which is rapidly converted into the active moiety tenofovir after 
absorption. Consequently, the ERA was performed with tenofovir.

Regarding the environmental risk assessment of tenofovir, since PECsurfacewater is above 0.01 μg/L, 
a Phase II assessment has been performed. Results from Phase II Tier A studies do not indicate any 
risks for the surfacewater, groundwater, STP and sediment compartments. Based on the log Kow 
value, tenofovir is not considered PBT nor vPvB. However, according to the transformation study in 
water/sediment systems, tenofovir has to be classified as very persistent in sediments. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable by the 
Committee. A full ERA was provided to support this extension of indication; the CHMP is of the view 
that Vemlidy is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

Participants in Cohort 1 were stratified based on age (12 to < 15 years and 15 to < 18 years). 
The double-blind period will be followed by the open-label extension period for up to an additional 216 weeks (through Week 240) where 
all participants will receive TAF 25 mg daily. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical method 
Concentrations of TAF and TFV in human K2EDTA plasma were determined by QPS, LLC (Newark, US) 
using protein precipitation (TAF) or solid phase extraction (TFV) followed by LC-MS/MS. Both methods 
(QPS 60-1578 for TAF and QPS 60-1368 for TFV) have already been assessed during marketing 
authorisation application of Vemlidy (EMEA/H/C/004169). Two further amendments have been 
included in method QPS 60-1368 since 2016: 
•  Amendment 3 (18 Feb 2021): 
-  Added hemolysed and lipemic plasma tests and updated validation summary table 
-  Changed the Principal Investigator and Scientific Reviewer 
-  Updated Compliance Statement in Section 2 
•  Amendment 4 (10 Jun 2021): 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155784/2023  
Page 10/83 
 
 
 
-  Added whole blood stability test 
All study samples were analysed within the established long-term stability of 988 days at -70°C for 
TAF and 1092 days at -70°C for TFV. 
Absorption 
Study GS-US-320-1092 
The steady-state PK of TAF and its major metabolite TFV were evaluated in adolescents (Cohort 1, 12 
to <18 years of age weighing ≥ 35 kg) and children (Cohort 2 Group 1, Part A 6 to <12 years of age 
weighing ≥ 25 kg). Subjects in both cohorts were administered TAF 25 mg once daily with food. For 
detailed study description see section 5.4.2. 
Blood samples were collected to determine the PK profile of TAF and TFV. A single PK measurement 
was collected from all study participants at Weeks 8, 16, and 24. PK samples (15 min to 4 h post-
dose) were collected at Week 4 from subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 and at Week 12 in all subjects. For 
subjects who provided specific additional consent to participate in the intensive PK substudy (optional 
for Cohort 1 and mandatory for Cohort 2, Part A), an intensive PK evaluation at the Week 4 visit was 
conducted, with PK samples collected pre-dose and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 h post-dose. 
These subjects also underwent a steady-state PK assessment of TAF and TFV at either Week 4, Week 
8, Week 12, Week 16, or Week 24. 
Results: 
The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the PK of TAF and confirm the selected dose of 25 mg once 
daily. Serial PK data from 13 adolescents in Cohort 1 and 5 children in Cohort 2 were included in the 
analysis. 
The steady-state PK parameters are presented in Table 3 for TAF and TFV.  
TAF Cmax (mean 387.7 ng/mL) occurred at 0.5 hours post-dose for subjects in Cohort 2 and was twice 
as high compared to Cmax of Cohort 1 (187.8 ng/ml) at 1 h post-dose. Cmax of TFV was comparable 
between cohorts (15.3 ng/ml vs. 17.4 ng/ml).  
AUCtau was slightly higher in Cohort 2 compared to Cohort 1 for both TAF (254.3 ng*h/ml and 312.5 
ng*h/ml, respectively) and TFV (202.8 ng*h/ml and 246 ng*h/ml).

Population pharmacokinetic modelling 
An existing TAF and TFV PopPK model using data of n=337 paediatric HIV patients was updated with 
data of n=59 paediatric HBV patients. For TAF n=1709 samples of HIV patients vs. n=321 samples of 
HBV patients were included. For TFV n=3176 samples of HIV patients were included vs. 429 samples 
of HBV patients. 
In studies GS-US-292-0106, GS-US-292-1515, GS-US-311-1269, GS-US-380-1474 paediatric HIV 
patients were treated with different fixed-dose combinations including TAF. Five Phase 2/3 studies 
were included in this analysis to evaluate the PK and safety of TAF and TFV. A summary of the study 
design, including study population, treatment, and PK sampling strategies can be found in Table 4. 
The covariates to be tested included age, sex, WT, race, BSA, BMI, P-gp inhibitors, background 
therapy, disease status (HIV-1 vs. HBV) and renal function as described by BCLCRSW. Covariates that 
yielded a significant decrease in −2 times the Log of the Likelihood function and resulted in a 
significant decrease in the Log Likelihood ratio test were retained for further analysis. A stepwise 
forward addition (all significant covariates at p < 0.01 with difference in OFV were retained) and 
backward elimination strategy (the least significant covariate that do not reach the p < 0.001 level of 
significance > 10.83 was dropped from the model) was then used to identify the final PopPK model.

TAF PopPK Analysis 
New data available in 59 HBV infected paediatrics patients from Study GS-US-320-1092 were used to 
further improve the TAF PopPK model, with particular focus on the IIV model structure. Based on the 
2020 TAF PopPK analysis, a 1-compartment structural model with sequential zero-first-order 
absorption and first-order elimination was used as a starting point. This model included fixed allometric 
scaling on clearance and volume of distribution and booster effects on relative bioavailability of TAF 
(F1). In addition, the M3 method was implemented given the large proportion of BLQ samples. The 
model was found to describe well the TAF PK data across available studies and TAF regimens but was

limited in the ability to adequately quantify IIV given the reproducibility and robustness issues. First, 
the inclusion of a COBI/RTV booster effect on D1 showed a significant reduction in OFV (delta OFV or 
dOFV of −33.6 points) and further improved the characterization of TAF absorption in the presence of 
booster therapy. 
The plasma concentrations of TAF were best described by a 1-compartment model with sequential 
zero- first-order absorption and first-order elimination. Effects of WT on CL/F and Vc/F were included 
using fixed allometric exponents of 0.75 and 1, respectively. In addition, COBI was found to affect F1 
(163.6% increase). Interindividual variability was included on D1. A combined error model was used to 
characterise residual variability (RV), with the inclusion of interindividual variability on the proportional 
error term. Table 5 provides the final parameter estimates and SEs associated with the final PopPK 
model.  
For a 38-kg paediatric patient receiving unboosted TAF, the CL/F for TAF was 112 L/h. The typical Vc/F 
value was 57.3 L. The ka was 1.99 h-1, and D1 was 0.116 h. The t1/2 was calculated as 0.35 h. 
Standard GOF plots for the final TAF PopPK model are shown in Figure 1. The pcVPC of TAF plasma 
concentration-time profiles stratified by WT and booster groups are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3.

TAF steady-state exposures (AUCtau and Cmax) were simulated in paediatric patients using the Bayesian 
post hoc PK parameters and presented across applicable covariates in the paediatric population. The 
observed exposures presented in the sensitivity analysis (extrapolated range) were normalised to the 
baseline scenario (25 mg Unboosted TAF) for comparison purposes; this resulted in extrapolated 
exposures that are not representative of clinical settings. The isolated influence of statistically 
significant covariates on the expected steady-state exposure of TAF in paediatric patients was 
evaluated in a sensitivity analysis. The AUCtau and Cmax of TAF were computed for each of the scenarios 
based on the final PopPK model. 
The sensitivity analysis showed that within paediatric patients, the effect of COBI was the most 
influential covariate with an increase in TAF exposures of +192%. This was followed by WT effects with

a percent change in TAF exposures ranging from approximately −40% to +91.9% (relative to the 
median exposures) for patients with extreme covariate values, respectively (Figure 4).

Sequential TAF-TFV PopPK Analysis 
A sequential 1-compartment TAF model and 2-compartment TFV model with first-order elimination was 
found to best describe the TFV paediatric data. A parallel absorption compartment with first-order 
process was introduced in the model to describe TFV data in the presence of the LPV/R booster. The 
estimated effect on TFV F was 209.5% increase. The WT effects were included on CLM/F, QM/F, VcM/F, 
and VpM/F using fixed allometric exponents of 0.75 and 1, for clearances and volumes of distribution, 
respectively. In addition, BCLCRSW was found to significantly affect CLM/F. Interindividual variability 
was included on CLM/F, QM/F, VcM/F, and VpM/F; and a combined proportional and additive error 
model was used to characterize RV (Figure 5). The final model parameter estimates for this model can 
be found in Table 6. 
For TFV, the updated TAF PopPK model was used as input for the sequential analysis. Given the 
adequacy of the previously developed model to characterise TFV PK, the focus was primarily on the 
ability of the model to describe TFV data in the HBV infected patients. The impact of previously 
identified covariate effects was confirmed and repeating a full covariate analysis was not deemed 
necessary.

boosted, or LPV/R-boosted TAF, the CLM/F for TFV was 130 L/h. The typical VcM/F, VpM/F, and QM/F 
values were 2790 L, 5280 L, and 1590 L/h, respectively. The ktfv was 0.138 h-1. The terminal t1/2 was 
calculated as 44.6 h.

Discussion: 
The population PK model used for justification of the 25 mg dose in paediatric HBV patients (≥6 years 
and ≥25 kg) is based on data from n=396 paediatric patients in total, from which n=59 were HBV 
patients and 337 were HIV patients. Plasma concentrations of n=12 paediatric patients of the intended 
patient population (≥6 – <12 years and ≥25 kg – 35 kg; HBV infection) were included, from which 
only n=5 had intensive PK sampling (for quantification of TAF and TFV). Mean weight in these n=12 
patients was 37.9 kg. For HIV patients more subjects with lower weights were included. 
Firstly, an updated PopPK model for TAF was submitted describing TAF PK as a 1-compartment model 
with lag-time and sequential zero- and first-order absorption and first-order elimination. Allometric 
exponents were fixed to 0.75 and 1 for weight effects on CL/F and Vc/F, respectively. Comedication 
with cobistat affected F1 (192% increase) and COBI and LPV/r were found to influence D1 (slower 
absorption). Interindividual variability was included on CL/F and Vc/F. 
Secondly, a combined sequential model for TAF and TFV was developed using post hoc PK parameters 
of the final TAF PopPK model as input. A two-compartment TFV model with first-order elimination was 
found to best describe the TFV PK data. A parallel absorption compartment with first-order process was 
introduced in the model to describe TFV data in the presence of the LPV/r booster (225.1% increase) 
in HIV patients. Weight effects were included on CLM/F, QM/F, VcM/F, and VpM/F using fixed allometric 
exponents of 0.75 and 1, for CL and V. In addition, the magnitude of the BCLCRSW effect on CLM/F was 
confirmed in the updated analysis. Interindividual variability was included on CLM/F, QM/F, VcM/F, and 
VpM/F. It was stated that the impact of previously identified covariate effects was confirmed and 
repeating a full covariate analysis was not deemed necessary. Patient status (HIV or HBV patient) was 
not found to be a significant covariate in the paediatric PopPK model whereas it was found to be a 
significant covariate on volume in the adult PopPK model (which also combined HIV and HBV data). 
This is probably due to lack of sufficient data in the paediatric population to show a significant 
difference. Since indication did not influence clearance values, it is considered acceptable not to include 
this covariate since it will not influence maintenance dosing. 
Only few data are available in paediatric HBV patients and the proposed dose (25 mg as in adults) for 
paediatric HBV patients ≥ 6 years of age and with a body weight between 25 and 35 kg is mainly 
based on the PopPK model. In order to evaluate whether the model is qualified for the intended 
purpose, the following issues were adequately addressed by the MAH, at the request of the CHMP: 
- The requested GOF plots have been provided and are considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
- The requested plots have also been provided for TAF and TFV. The CHMP is of the view that pcVPCs 
show that, overall, observed concentrations are well captured by the model, with only a slight 
underprediction around Cmax for HIV-COBI boosted patients. The issue was therefore considered 
resolved by the Committee. 
Section 5.2 of the SmPC was amended accordingly, introducing pharmacokinetics data of tenofovir 
alafenamide and its metabolite tenofovir in paediatric patients aged 6 to < 18 years and adults as 
compared to that in adolescents and adults. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
PK/PD analyses, i.e., exposure-response relationships for efficacy and safety and maximum increase 
from baseline in serum creatinine (sCR) at week 24, were evaluated using PK parameters derived from 
popPK modelling. Please see section below.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Extrapolation concept and extrapolation plan were discussed during the procedure. In general, it is 
expected that a similar exposure (AUCtau and Cmax) is demonstrated between paediatric CHB patients 6 
to < 12 years of age weighing at least 25 kg and adults based on PK data and popPK model to allow 
for an extrapolation of efficacy and safety data from adults to the paediatric population. The MAH was 
requested to address this concern. The CHMP considered that the related data provided by the 
Company indicated that the popPK model reasonably well captured the observed TFV concentrations in 
paediatric HBV patients. AUC and Cmax values in younger patients were comparable to those in adults. 
Hence, extrapolation of efficacy and safety data from adults to children 6 to < 12 years of age and 
weighing at least 25 kg was generally considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
However, Ctau was clearly lower in younger HBV patients compared to adults with HBV. The clinical 
impact on the lower trough concentrations with regard to efficacy and resistance development in 
younger HBV patients was discussed also based on available data from adolescents (e.g., literature 
data) for which Vemlidy is already approved but in which Ctrough is even lower than in HBV patients 
aged 6-12 years according to the submitted popPK data. The MAH submitted the required updated 
analysis of the exposure in paediatric patients as compared to adults. Particularly for Ctrough, a 
considerable proportion of paediatric patients had lower exposures as compared to adults. The 
underlying reason of this finding was unclear, in particular as flat dosing of 25 mg QD was used for 
paediatric and adult participants, which raised the question if the presented data on TAF and TFV 
exposure in paediatric CHB patients were correct. According to the MAH’s position, the efficacy 
response rate was not dependent upon the Ctrough concentration. The CHMP was in agreement with the 
above-mentioned approach.  
Section 4.2 of the SmPC was amended accordingly, reading as follows: 
Posology 
Adults and paediatric patients at least 6 years of age and older weighing at least 25 kg: one tablet 
once daily 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP is of the view that the PopPK model is qualified to confirm the 25 mg dose in the intended 
age group, based on extrapolation of the adult’s efficacy and safety data. The PK/PopPK data are 
therefore considered sufficient to justify the 25 mg dose for the treatment of children 6 to <12 years of 
age weighing ≥ 25 kg. Section 4.2 of the SmPC was amended accordingly.

Title of Study 
GS-US-320-1092, ‘A Randomised, Double-Blind Evaluation of the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and 
Antiviral Efficacy of Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF) in Children and Adolescent Subjects with Chronic 
Hepatitis B Virus Infection’ 
Methods 
Study GS-US-320-1092 is an ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of the safety, 
tolerability, PK, and antiviral activity of TAF administered once daily in treatment-naive and treatment-
experienced adolescents and children with CHB. Participants were randomised to receive either blinded 
TAF 25 mg tablets or placebo tablets once daily through Week 24, and the primary efficacy endpoint 
was the percentage of participants who achieved HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL at Week 24. Following double 
blind treatment for 24 weeks, all participants were eligible to roll over to receive open label TAF for up 
to an additional 216 weeks (through Week 240). 
The data presented are from the interim, primary endpoint analysis for safety, efficacy, and PK, which 
was conducted when all participants in Cohort 1 (adolescents 12 to less than 18 years of age and 
weighing at least 35 kg) and Cohort 2 Group 1 (paediatric participants 6 to < 12 years of age and 
weighing at least 25 kg) had completed their Week 24 (i.e., primary endpoint) visit or prematurely 
discontinued from the study. 
Figure 10 and Figure 11 show the study schemes for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively.

Cohort 1: At least 69 male and female adolescent participants (12 to < 18 years of age weighing  ≥ 35 
kg) were planned to be enrolled and randomised to receive either the blinded TAF 25 mg tablet or 
placebo-to-match (PTM) tablet once daily through Week 24. Randomisation was stratified by age (12 
to < 15 and 15 to < 18 years of age). 
Cohort 2: At least 75 children were planned to be enrolled in Cohort 2 of the study. Cohort 2 is divided

divided into 2 parts: Part A (mandatory intensive PK to confirm the dose) and Part B (identical to part 
A in design but no intensive PK sampling). 
The duration of double-blind treatment for both cohorts was 24 weeks. After completing the double-
blind  phase, all Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1 participants were eligible to roll over to receive 
open-label TAF 25 mg once daily for up to an additional 216 weeks (total planned duration of study 
treatment is 240 weeks). The interim analysis was performed when all participants in Cohort 1 and 
Cohort 2 Group 1 had completed their Week 24 visit or prematurely discontinued from the study.

Treatments 
Regimen: 
Paediatric participants (children and adolescent) with CHB aged 6 years old and above weighing at 
least 25 kg were treated with the approved adult dose of TAF, i.e., 25 mg tablet once daily or placebo.  
Duration: 
The duration of the double blind phase was 24 weeks. After completing the double-blind phase, all 
participants were eligible to roll over to receive open label TAF 25 mg once daily for up to an additional 
216 weeks. 
Justification of dose and duration of treatment: 
For adolescent participants (12 to < 18 years) with CHB weighing ≥ 35 kg, the already approved dose 
of TAF 25 mg was proposed for evaluation.  
Children 6 to < 12 years old weighing ≥ 25 kg also received the adult/adolescent dose of TAF (25 mg). 
This dose was based on allometric scaling of adult exposures from the Genvoya and Biktarvy 
development programs for TAF, and from the TAF development program in participants with CHB for 
TFV exposures, considering correlations between body weight and clearance capacity (liver 
volume/size for TAF, and renal capacity for TFV).

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint for Study GS-US-320-1092 was the proportion of participants with 
plasma HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL at Week 24. The primary cut-off of HBV DNA was < 20 IU/mL to reflect 
the current HBV DNA assay LLOQ.  
An endpoint of HBV DNA suppression is widely recognised as a useful marker for the assessment of 
antiviral activity in patients with CHB, is a standard measurement for evaluating the antiviral activity of 
a drug in adult and paediatric patients with CHB, and was the basis for Vemlidy approval in adults (i.e., 
proportion with HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL at Week 48). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included additional analysis of HBV DNA and analyses of ALT, 
noninvasive changes in liver fibrosis (i.e., serum FibroTest), HBeAg and HBsAg serology, virological 
resistance, and acceptability/palatability analysis. 
Sample size 
Approximately 144 participants were planned to be enrolled with a randomization ratio 2:1 to TAF or 
matching placebo in 2 cohorts.  
Cohort 1 was planned to enrol at least 69 adolescent participants. This sample size was expected to 
provide 91% power to detect a 32% difference in the proportion of participants with HBV DNA < lower 
limit of quantitation (LLOQ) at Week 24 based on a 2-sided Fisher’s exact test at a significance level of 
0.05. This calculation assumed a response rate of 3% in the placebo arm and 35% in the TAF arm. The 
assumptions were derived from the TAF adult study, GS-US-320-0110 (HBeAg positive participants), 
based on the proportion of participants in the TAF arm with HBV DNA <LLOQ using a missing = failure 
(M = F) approach. 
Cohort 2 in children enrolled approximately 75 participants into 2 parts. A minimum of 27 participants 
were enrolled in Part A, including 6 participants (6 to < 12 years and ≥ 25 kg), 9 participants (6 to 
<12 years and ≥17 kg to < 25 kg), and 12 participants (2 to < 6 years and < 17 kg). With a 2:1

randomization ratio, 4, 6, and 8 participants were expected to be randomized to receive active TAF in 
this study Cohort, respectively. Comparing with population PK data for TAF in 539 participants derived 
from E/C/F/TAF HIV Studies GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111, the sample sizes were expected 
to provide 39%, 51%, and 61% power, respectively, to conclude equivalence of TAF AUCtau in children 
age 2 to < 12 years in each dosing group versus adult participants, assuming the expected geometric 
mean ratio is 1, equivalency lower boundary is 70%, one-sided test performed at an alpha level of 
0.05, and the SD of AUCtau is 0.52 ng•h/mL (natural-log scale). The samples sizes in this study was 
considered to provide sufficient assessment of the analysis given that PK data for TAF in children living 
with HIV (6 to <12 years weighing ≥ 25 kg) is already available, which was used to further support 
dose confirmation in this group. 
The sample size of at least 75 participants in Cohort 2 was expected to provide 91% power to detect a 
32% difference in the proportion of participants with HBV DNA < LLOQ at Week 24 based on a 2-sided 
Fisher’s exact test at a significance level of 0.05. This calculation assumed a response rate of 3% in 
the placebo arm and 35% in the TAF arm. The assumptions are derived from the TAF adult study, GS-
US-320-0110 (HBeAg positive participants), based on the proportion of participants in the TAF arm 
with HBV DNA < LLOQ using a M = F approach.  
Cohort 2, Group 1 participants were combined with Cohort 1 participants to provide a summary of 
available efficacy, safety, and PK results for all participants under treatment with TAF 25 mg. Cohort 2, 
Groups 2 and 3 will be summarized separately in a future analysis and will enrol approximately 63 
participants to ensure sufficient statistical power.  
Randomisation 
A centralised randomisation procedure via an interactive web response system (IWRS) was used for 
this study, whereby study treatment was assigned to participants according to the randomisation 
schedule. A unique participant number was provided during randomisation. Eligible participants (n = 
150) were randomised 2:1 to receive either blinded TAF or placebo for 24 weeks. Participants in Cohort 
1 were stratified based on age (12 to < 15 years and 15 to < 18 years). Cohort 2 consisted of 3 
groups with Group 1 including participants 6 to < 12 years of age weighing ≥ 25 kg, Group 2 including 
participants 6 to <12 years of age weighing ≥17 kg to < 25 kg and Group 3 including participants 2 to 
< 6 years of age weighing < 17 kg. 
Blinding (masking) 
The Clinical Pharmacology team was unblinded when there was a need to review the PK data in 
adolescent participants and children for dose selection and dose confirmation. Unblinded information 
was kept confidential.  
Before the study was formally unblinded at the Week 24 analysis, HBV DNA results were blinded to 
investigators, participants, and Gilead personnel involved in the clinical conduct of the study from 
baseline to Week 36. The only exception was in the case of ALT flare, considering a situation of 
medical need, when serial HBV DNA values from baseline through time of event was made available to 
the investigator. Additionally, Gilead Global Patient Safety (GLPS) was provided with unblinding 
information upon request for expedited reporting of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions.  
The study was unblinded to a limited number of Gilead study team personnel at the time of the 
primary end point analysis at Week 24 for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1 once all participants in 
Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1 completed the Week 24 visit or prematurely discontinued prior to Week 
24.

Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was conducted after the last randomised participant reached Week 24 or 
discontinued study drug prematurely. The primary efficacy analysis used the Full Analysis Set (FAS), 
which included all participants who were randomised into the study and received at least 1 dose of 
study drug. The purpose of the primary efficacy end point analysis was to evaluate the difference 
between treatment with TAF and placebo in the proportion of participants with HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL 
(by missing equals failure [M = F] analysis) at Week 24. 
A P value testing the superiority of TAF over placebo for the proportion of HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL was 
calculated using the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test. The analysis of the proportion of 
participants with plasma HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL at Week 24 was repeated within each subgroup. 
The analyses for the secondary efficacy end points were conducted using the FAS, unless otherwise 
specified.

temporary halt of enrolment (1 participant) or withdrawal of consent (2 participants). Of the 161 
participants screened, 88 were randomised (Cohort 1 TAF 47 participants, placebo 23 participants; 
Cohort 2 Group 1 TAF 12 participants, placebo 6 participants). The 88 participants were randomised 
and treated at 36 study centers in the following countries/regions: 1 in Belgium, 2 in Hong Kong, 12 in 
India, 1 in New Zealand, 5 in Romania, 17 in Russia, 8 in South Korea, 8 in Taiwan, and 34 in the US. 
All participants who were randomised received study drug or placebo and were included in the Full 
Analysis Set (59 TAF participants; 29 placebo participants).  
All 88 participants who were randomised completed the double-blind study treatment. No participant 
discontinued study drug or the study during the double blind phase.

Table 10 provides a categorical summary of important protocol deviations that occurred during the 
study up to the data cut-off date. Protocol deviations were documented during routine monitoring 
visits and reviewed by the study team prior to study unblinding. 
A total of 106 important protocol deviations occurred in 53 participants during the study, of which 65 
occurred in 35 participants in the TAF group and 41 occurred in 17 participants in the placebo group. 
In addition, 2 unintended unblinding events occurred with 9 investigators and 3 Gilead personnel, 
respectively, during the conduct of the study. 
None of these important protocol deviations affected the overall quality or interpretation of the study 
data.

Baseline data 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally similar between the TAF and placebo groups, 
with no statistically significant differences between the groups at baseline. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 11. The median age in Cohort 1 
was 15 years (range: 12 to 17 years) in both TAF and placebo groups and Cohort 2 Group 1 was 10 
years (range: 7 to 11 years) in the TAF group and 8 years (range: 7 to 9 years) in the placebo group. 
The median (Q1, Q3) weight for participants in Cohort 1 was 54.6 kg (46.2, 61.1) for the TAF group 
and 55.8 kg (50.4, 64.3) for the placebo group, and for participants in Cohort 2 Group 1 was 37.1 kg 
(30.7, 43.7) for the TAF group and 32.2 kg (25.6, 34.5) for the placebo group. The majority of 
participants were Asian (65.9%); 25.0% and 5.7% of the participants, respectively, were White and 
Black or African American. The majority of participants were from Europe or North America (64.8%).

Baseline disease characteristics are summarised in Table 12. Overall, baseline disease characteristics 
were similar for the 2 treatment groups, except baseline proteinuria tox grade. The median (Q1, Q3) 
baseline HBV DNA value was 8.1 (7.8, 8.6) log10 IU/mL, and median (Q1, Q3) HBsAg was 4.5 (4.2, 
4.9) log10 IU/mL. Moreover, 68.2% participants had HBV DNA ≥ 8 log10 IU/mL, characteristic of the 
paediatric population.  
Nearly all participants (98.9%) were HBeAg positive at baseline, and all (100%) participants were 
HBsAg positive at baseline. One participant in the TAF group in Cohort 1 was HBeAg negative and 
HBeAb positive at baseline (also at screening). 
By HBV genotype assessment at baseline, genotype D was most commonly seen (43.9%), followed by 
genotypes C (24.4%) and B (23.2%).  
Overall, 64.8% of participants had baseline ALT > 1.5 × ULN based on central laboratory criteria, and 
the median (Q1, Q3) baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by the Schwartz formula was 
153.5 (138.0, 170.5) mL/min/1.73 m2.  
For 71.6% of participants, a response of ‘No’ was given for ‘Previous hepatitis B medication’, with 
78.4% of participants naive to prior HBV treatment, and participants who had received prior HBV 
treatment primarily treated with interferon alpha (IFN-α) and/or lamivudine (LAM).  
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics are representative of the diversity of paediatric 
patients with CHB.  
Notably, Cohort 2 Group 1 had a numerically higher proportion of participants with genotype D HBV 
infection as well as high baseline viral load (i.e., HBV DNA ≥ 8 log10 IU/mL), and a lower mean (SD) 
ALT at baseline compared to participants in Cohort 1.

Numbers analysed 
The analysis sets used for data evaluation are shown in Table 13. Overall, 88 participants (TAF 59 
participants; placebo 29 participants) who were randomised and received at least 1 dose of treatment 
were included in the Safety Analysis Set and the FAS for the Week 24 analysis. Of these, Cohort 1 
comprised 47 participants in the TAF group and 23 participants in the placebo group and Cohort 2 
Group 1 comprised 12 participants in the TAF group and 6 participants in the placebo group.

In total, 5 participants (TAF 4 participants; placebo 1 participant) were excluded from the Week 24 
Per-Protocol Analysis Set. 3 participants were excluded because of less than 80% adherence to the 
study drug in the double-blind phase, 1 participant was excluded because of premature discontinuation 
and/or missing HBV DNA assessment at Week 24 and 1 participant was excluded for receiving ongoing 
therapy with a prohibited drug listed in the study protocol. 
The primary analysis set for efficacy analysis was the FAS, defined as all randomised participants who 
received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Table 13: Analysis sets (Randomised Analysis Sets) 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The results of the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, i.e. the percentage of participants with 
plasma HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL at Week 24, are presented by treatment group (TAF and placebo) in the 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) in Table 14. The percentage of participants with plasma HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL 
at Week 24 was significantly greater in the TAF group (18.6% [11/59 participants]; 95% CI: 9.7% to 
30.9%) compared with the placebo group (0% [0/29 participants]; 95% CI: 0.0% to 11.9%) (P = 
0.0137). The difference in proportion between the TAF and placebo groups was 18.5% (95% CI: 5.4% 
to 31.6%). Additionally, 8 participants (13.6%) in the TAF group and no participant in the placebo 
group had HBV DNA between 20 to < 69 IU/mL by Week 24. 
Similar results were observed when the primary efficacy endpoint analysis was repeated using the 
missing = excluded (M = E) approach (TAF: 19.0% [11/58 participants]; placebo: 0% [0/27 
participants]; P = 0.0150) and for the PP Analysis Set using the missing = failure (M = F) approach 
(TAF: 18.2% [10/55 participants]; placebo: 0.0% [0/28 participants]; P = 0.0163).  
Overall, the results demonstrate a superior antiviral response with TAF treatment compared with 
placebo for the primary efficacy endpoint of proportion with HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL at Week 24.

Subgroup Analysis  
The consistency in antiviral treatment response was explored by evaluating the proportions of 
participants achieving the primary efficacy endpoint of plasma HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL at Week 24 by 
pre-specified subgroups. 
Overall, the proportions of participants achieving HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL were statistically significantly 
higher in the TAF group than the placebo group for those with baseline ALT > 1.5 × ULN (TAF 20.8%; 
placebo 0.0%; P = 0.0117 [AASLD] and TAF 28.6%; placebo 0.0%; P = 0.0062 [central laboratory]), 
baseline HBV DNA levels < 8 log10 IU/mL at Week 24 (TAF 45.0%; placebo 0.0%; P = 0.0278), and 
participants who were treatment-naive at baseline (TAF 20.0%; placebo 0.0%; P = 0.0149). In 
addition, there were statistically significant treatment effects noted for participants who were Asian 
(TAF 24.3%; placebo 0.0%; P = 0.0123), enrolled in sites in North America/Europe (TAF 22.0%; 
placebo 0.0%; P = 0.0431), and with genotype B or C infection (TAF 36.0%; placebo 0.0%; P = 
0.0130). The differences were not statistically significant for the following subgroups: age at baseline 
(6 to < 12 years; 12 to < 15 years; 15 to < 18 years), baseline ALT ≤ 1.5 x ULN (by both central 
laboratory and AASLD criteria), race (non-Asian), region (Asia), sex (male; female), baseline HBV DNA 
≥ 8 log10 IU/mL, treatment-experienced, or other genotype (i.e., non-genotype B or C). The limited 
numbers of participants in some of these subgroups likely contributed to the lack of difference between 
TAF and placebo. 
The subgroup with high baseline viral load (≥ 8 log10 IU/mL), representing the majority of participants 
in the study (68.2%), showed a lower response with TAF treatment overall (HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL: TAF 
5.1%, placebo 0.0%; HBV DNA 20 to < 69 IU/mL: TAF 12.8%, placebo 0.0%; P = 0.3228). Given this, 
the impact of baseline viral load was further assessed within the 2 treatment cohorts (Cohort 1 and 
Cohort 2 Group 1 for TAF and placebo). Of note, participants in Cohort 2 Group 1 had a numerically

higher proportion with baseline HBV DNA levels ≥ 8 log10 IU/mL compared to participants in Cohort 1 
(Cohort 1 [TAF 63.8%, placebo 69.6%], Cohort 2 Group 1 [TAF 75.0%, placebo 83.3%]). No 
participant with baseline HBV DNA levels ≥ 8 log10 IU/mL in Cohort 2 Group 1 had yet achieved plasma 
HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL by Week 24.  
In Study GS-US-320-1092, the highest proportion of enrolled participants were those with HBV 
genotype D (43.9%) infection; notably, in comparison to overall results, TAF participants in Cohort 2 
Group 1 showed an even higher proportion with genotype D at baseline compared to TAF participants 
in Cohort 1 (Cohort 1 [39.5%] vs Cohort 2 Group 1 [58.3%]). Genotype D has been previously shown 
to impact the rate of viral suppression in adults. In order to further explore this imbalance, an ad hoc 
analysis of treatment responses by baseline HBV genotype was performed for genotypes A through D 
using an M = F approach. A numerically lower response rate with TAF treatment was observed in 
participants with HBV genotype D infection. No participant with genotype D had achieved plasma HBV 
DNA < 20 IU/mL by Week 24; however, there were 3 participants (12.5%) in the TAF group with 
genotype D with HBV DNA between 20 to < 69 IU/mL (Cohort 1: 1/17 [5.9%]; Cohort 2 Group 1: 2/7 
[28.6%]). Similar results were observed when the primary efficacy endpoint analysis for participants 
with genotype D was repeated using the M = E approach (no participant with HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL; 
20 to < 69 IU/mL: TAF: 3/24 [12.5%]; placebo: 0/10 [0.0%]). Previous subgroup analyses in adults in 
Studies GS-US-320-0108 and GS-US-320-0110 had identified lower response rates (proportion of 
participants with HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL at Week 48) in participants with genotype D infection 
compared to other genotypes with both TAF and TDF treatment.  
Taken together, these additional analyses support that the lower response rates observed with TAF 
treatment in this study in comparison to results in the Phase 3 study in HBeAg positive adults (GS-US-
320-0110) are likely due to higher proportions of participants in Study GS-US-320-1092 with both high 
baseline HBV DNA levels (≥ 8 log10 IU/mL), as well as a higher proportion of participants with HBV 
genotype D infection. As seen in adults, a longer duration of treatment is likely required in order to see 
more participants achieve full viral suppression (i.e., HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Secondary efficacy endpoints of Study GS-US-320-1092 included additional analysis of HBV DNA and 
analyses of ALT, noninvasive changes in liver fibrosis (i.e., serum FibroTest), HBeAg and HBsAg 
serology, virological resistance, and acceptability/palatability analysis. 
Virologic Suppression 
Proportion of participants with plasma HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL over 24 weeks 
Figure 12 presents the proportion of participants with plasma HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL over 24 weeks by 
treatment group (TAF and placebo) for the FAS using the M = F approach for missing data. Overall, a 
consistent increase in the number of participants with HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL was observed in the TAF 
group after Week 8, while no change was observed in the placebo group over the 24-week period. Of 
the participants with plasma HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL at Week 24, HBV DNA was not detected in 2 
participants (3.4%) in the TAF group.

Change from baseline in HBV DNA levels 
Figure 13 presents the change in HBV DNA (log10 IU/mL) by visit. Significant decreases in HBV DNA in 
the TAF group compared with the placebo group were observed from baseline at all measured time 
points (P < 0.0001 from Week 4 to Week 24). 
The mean (SD) change at Week 24 overall and in individual cohorts was as follows: 
• 
Total: TAF −4.98 (1.520) log10 IU/mL versus placebo −0.10 (0.636) log10 IU/mL (P < 0.0001) 
•  Cohort 1: TAF −5.04 (1.544) log10 IU/mL versus placebo −0.13 (0.689) log10 IU/mL  
•  Cohort 2 Group 1: TAF −4.76 (1.466) log10 IU/mL versus placebo 0.00 (0.346) log10 IU/mL 
Taken together, these results indicate progressively improving rates of viral suppression over 24 weeks 
with TAF treatment compared with no change in those receiving placebo.

Biochemical Analyses 
ALT normalisation 
The proportion of participants with baseline abnormal ALT that had achieved normalised ALT 
(i.e., ALT > ULN at baseline but within the normal range at the postbaseline visit) by Week 24 is 
presented in Table 15. Overall, a consistently higher percentage of participants in the TAF group 
compared with the placebo group achieved ALT normalisation (central laboratory criteria: TAF 67.3% 
versus, placebo 3.7%; P < 0.0001; AASLD criteria: TAF 44.6%, placebo 0.0%; P < 0.0001). 
The percentage of participants achieving ALT normalisation was also consistently higher in the TAF 
group compared with the placebo group (assessed by both central laboratory criteria and AASLD 
criteria) in both Cohort 1 (central laboratory criteria: TAF 66.7% versus placebo 4.8%; AASLD criteria: 
TAF 43.5%, placebo 0.0%) and Cohort 2 Group 1 (central laboratory criteria: TAF 70.0% versus 
placebo 0.0%; AASLD criteria: TAF 50.0% versus placebo 0.0%). 
The results obtained using the M = E method were generally similar to those obtained using the M = F 
method.

Figure 14 and Figure 15 display the proportion of participants with ALT normalisation by visit during 
double-blind study treatment according to central laboratory and AASLD criteria, respectively. The 
proportion of participants with ALT normalisation progressively increased in TAF-treated participants 
and was statistically greater for the TAF group compared with the placebo group at all assessments 
from Week 12 to Week 24 by central laboratory and AASLD criteria. 
This was observed across Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1 and therefore consistently demonstrates 
efficacy that is clinically important across the study population.

Change from baseline in ALT 
For the TAF groups, ALT decreased from baseline during 24 weeks of double-blind treatment. The 
decreases from baseline in ALT were significantly greater for the TAF group compared with the placebo 
group from Week 4 to Week 24. At Week 24, overall results (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1) for the 
median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline in ALT for each treatment group were: 
• 
TAF: −32.0 U/L (−65.0, −7.0 U/L), placebo: −2.5 U/L (−15.0, 22.0 U/mL); P = 0.0002 
Serological Analysis 
HBeAg loss and seroconversion 
Overall, at Week 24, 4 of 58 participants (6.9%) in the TAF group and 1 of 29 participants (3.4%) in 
the placebo group had experienced HBeAg loss/seroconversion; the between-group difference was not 
statistically significant (P = 0.5242). 
In 3 of the 4 participants in the TAF group who had HBeAg loss, the loss occurred early (i.e., at 
Week 12) and was maintained through Week 24, and all 4 of these participants had confirmed HBeAg 
seroconversion at Week 24. The one participant in the placebo group who had HBeAg loss by Week 24 
also achieved seroconversion at this same time point. 
The proportions of participants with HBeAg loss and seroconversion were also analysed by visit using 
the M = E method; results using the M = E method were generally similar to those using the M = F 
method. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155784/2023  
Page 44/83 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HBsAg loss and seroconversion 
No participant in the TAF and placebo groups had HBsAg loss or seroconversion by Week 24 using both 
the M = F or M = E approaches. 
Change from baseline in serum HBsAg levels 
Overall, at baseline, the mean (SD) HBsAg level was 4.43 (0.576) log10 IU/mL in the TAF group and 
4.58 (0.545) log10 IU/mL in the placebo group. Mean decreases from baseline in serum HBsAg levels 
were observed in both the TAF and placebo groups over 24 weeks. Overall, the median (Q1, Q3) 
change from baseline in serum HBsAg levels was small but significantly higher in the TAF group 
compared to placebo at Week 24, with a −0.18 (−0.36, −0.02) decrease in the TAF group compared to 
0 (−0.20, 0.02) in the placebo group (P = 0.0309). 
Fibrosis Analysis 
At Week 24, the mean (SD) change in FibroTest scores from the baseline value was very small in each 
group, with a −0.01 (0.09) decrease in the TAF group and +0.03 (0.111) increase in the placebo group 
(P = 0.1257). As the anti-fibrosis response with oral antiviral therapy typically takes longer to develop 
than a reduction in necroinflammation, which appears early in treatment (as reflected in ALT 
normalization results), the minimal fibrosis response with TAF treatment at Week 24 was not 
unexpected. 
Analysis of Palatability and Acceptability 
The majority of participants in the study had a neutral or positive acceptability response at baseline up 
to Week 24 in the palatability and acceptability assessment. Overall, 46% of participants reported 
being able to taste the drug, while 50% reported not being able to taste the drug at Week 24. Of those 
who responded as being able to taste the drug, 33.0% responded “Neither dislike or like”, 1.1% 
responded “Dislike moderately” and 3.4% responded “Dislike very much”, with the remainder having a 
more positive opinion of drug taste. 
Clinical virology 
Clinical virology analyses were performed for paediatric participants with CHB 6 to < 18 years old, 
weighing ≥ 25 kg who received TAF in Study GS-US-320-1092. Resistance analyses were performed 
on populations with HBV isolated from serum for all participants who met pre-specified criteria. 
Resistance surveillance was conducted in participants receiving TAF only, as those randomised to 
placebo did not receive active antiviral therapy.  
Resistance analysis was evaluated at Week 24 using the HBV DNA quantification assay cutoff of 20 
IU/mL and the HBV sequencing assay cutoff of 69 IU/mL.  
Sequence analysis was conducted on Week 24 samples for TAF on-treatment participants with HBV 
DNA ≥ 69 IU/mL at Week 24, including participants with virologic breakthrough, virologic blip, and 
viremia, and their corresponding baseline samples.  
Virologic breakthrough was defined as ≥ 1 log10 IU/mL increase from nadir in HBV DNA or, confirmed 
HBV DNA ≥ 69 IU/mL if HBV DNA was previously < 69 IU/mL for 2 consecutive visits. If a participant 
met one of these criteria at only 1 visit, the participant was classified as having a virologic blip. Viremia 
was defined as having persistent HBV DNA levels above 20 IU/mL over the course of treatment. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155784/2023  
Page 45/83 
 
 
 
 
 
Phenotypic analysis was conducted for participants who developed an emerging amino acid substitution 
at a conserved site (versus a polymorphic site) of the HBV polymerase/reverse transcriptase (pol/RT), 
regardless of whether the participant experienced virologic breakthrough and for participants who 
developed changes at polymorphic residues in the HBV pol/RT if the changes were observed in more 
than one participant. 
The results of the baseline genotypic analyses are summarized in the table below. Of the HBV 
genotypes, genotype D (40.9%) was the most commonly observed followed by genotype C (22.7%), 
then genotype B (21.6%). Notably, participants in Cohort 2 Group 1 included a numerically higher 
proportion with genotype D compared to participants in Cohort 1: Cohort 1 (TAF 36.2%, placebo 
34.8%), Cohort 2 Group 1 (TAF 58.3%, placebo 66.7%). Additionally, 6 participants were identified 
with genotype A virus (6.8%), 1 participant was mixed genotype (1.1%), and 6 participants were not 
able to be genotyped (6.8%). 
Table 16: Summary of Baseline Genotypic Analyses 
In this resistance surveillance analysis from Study GS-US-320-1092, out of a total of 88 paediatric 
participants with CHB who were randomised and treated with TAF 25 mg once daily in Cohort 1 (n = 
47; placebo, n = 23) and Cohort 2 Group 1 (n = 12; placebo, n = 6) for 24 weeks, 39 (44%) TAF-
treated participants qualified for viral sequence analysis. Out of these, 2 patients qualified for 
phenotypic evaluation. Results of phenotypic evaluation are summarised in the table below. Samples 
with a fold-change in the EC50 greater than 2-fold indicate reduced susceptibility to TAF. 
In Cohort 1 TAF group, 30 participants qualified for sequence analysis with majority of participants 
(27 of 30, 90%) being viraemic with HBV DNA ≥ 69 IU/mL at Week 24. One participant in Cohort 1 
qualified for phenotypic analysis due to a unique conserved site change. No HBV pol/RT amino acid 
substitutions associated with resistance to TAF were detected through 24 weeks of treatment.  
In Cohort 2 Group 1 TAF group, 9 participants qualified for sequence analysis with majority of 
participants (8 of 9, 88.9%) being viraemic with HBV DNA ≥ 69 IU/mL at Week 24. One participant 
qualified for phenotypic analysis due to a unique conserved site change. No HBV pol/RT amino acid 
substitutions associated with resistance to TAF were detected through 24 weeks of treatment.

Table 17: Phenotypic Evaluation of 2 Qualified Participants in the TAF Group 
Overall, the relatively high proportions of participants in this study who qualified for sequence analysis 
was not unexpected due to the short (24 week) treatment duration, high baseline viral loads, and the 
high proportion of subjects with genotype D chronic HBV in the study population.  
The majority of participants (n = 35) that qualified for sequence analysis were persistently viraemic in 
the absence of virologic breakthrough. 
Virologic breakthrough was infrequent (n = 2) and was not associated with sequence changes in 
pol/RT. 
Sequence analysis showed that the majority of participants had no sequence change from baseline.  
No HBV amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to TAF were detected through 24 weeks of 
double-blind treatment.

Antiviral Efficacy of Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF) in Children and Adolescent Subjects with 
Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection 
Study identifier 
Design 
GS-US-320-1092 
This is an ongoing, randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter study of the safety, tolerability, PK, and antiviral activity of TAF 
administered once daily in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced 
adolescents and children with CHB. This study included an interim analysis 
for adolescent participants aged 12 to < 18 years weighing ≥ 35 kg (Cohort 
1), and children aged 6 to < 12 years weighing ≥ 25 kg (Cohort 2 Group 1), 
who are receiving the adult dose of TAF 25 mg once daily. 
Cohort 1: At least 69 male and female adolescent participants (12 to < 18 
years of age) were planned to be enrolled and randomized to receive either 
the blinded TAF 25 mg tablet or placebo-to-match (PTM) tablet once daily 
through Week 24. Randomization was stratified by age (12 to < 15 and 15 to 
< 18 years of age). 
Cohort 2: At least 75 children were planned to be enrolled in Cohort 2 of the 
study. Cohort 2 is divided into 3 dose groups (Groups 1, 2, and 3) by age 
and weight, with enrolment into each dose group divided into 2 parts: Part A 
(mandatory intensive PK to confirm the dose) and Part B. 
The interim analysis was performed when all participants in Cohort 1 and 
Cohort 2 Group 1 had completed their Week 24 visit or prematurely 
discontinued from the study. 
Duration: 
The duration of double-blind treatment was 
24 weeks. After completing the double-blind  
phase, all Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1 
participants were eligible to roll over to 
receive open label TAF 25 mg once daily for 
up to an additional 216 weeks (total planned 
duration of study treatment was 240 weeks).

Notes 
Of the 47 participants receiving TAF in Cohort 1, 10 participants (21.3%) 
reached the primary endpoint but only 1 participant (8.3%) of the 12 
participants receiving TAF in Cohort 2 Group 1 reached the primary 
endpoint. 
Suppression rate at Week 24 in HBeAg-positive adults treated with TAF 25 
mg once daily in the Phase 3 Study GS-US-320-0110 was 34.6% (201/581 
participants had HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL).   
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies  
Study GS-US-320-1092 is an ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of the safety, 
tolerability, PK, and antiviral activity of TAF administered once daily in treatment-naive and treatment-
experienced adolescents and children with CHB. The primary efficacy endpoint for Study GS-US-320-
1092 was the proportion of participants with plasma HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL at Week 24. The primary 
cut-off of HBV DNA was < 20 IU/mL to reflect the current HBV DNA assay LLOQ. Secondary efficacy 
endpoints included additional analysis of HBV DNA and analyses of ALT, noninvasive changes in liver

fibrosis (i.e., serum FibroTest), HBeAg and HBsAg serology, virological resistance, and 
acceptability/palatability analysis. A total of 161 participants were screened and a total of 88 eligible 
participants were randomised (47 Cohort 1 TAF participants, 23 placebo participants; 12 Cohort 2 
Group 1 TAF participants, 6 placebo participants).  The data presented are from the interim, primary 
endpoint analysis for safety, efficacy, and PK, which was conducted when all participants in Cohort 1 
(adolescents 12 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 35 kg) and Cohort 2 Group 1 
(paediatric participants 6 to < 12 years of age and weighing at least 25 kg) had completed their Week 
24 (i.e., primary endpoint) visit or prematurely discontinued from the study. 
TAF is currently approved for use in adult and adolescent patients with CHB weighing at least 35 kg in 
the EU and other regions. Therefore, in particular the data from Cohort 2 Group 1 are relevant for this 
application to extend the indication to CHB-infected children from 6 years and older and weighing at 
least 25 kg. 
The study population and inclusion/exclusion criteria are acceptable to the CHMP. Only paediatric 
patients with CLcr ≥ 80 mL/min/1.73m2 using the Schwartz formula were eligible for the study (TAF is 
renally excreted). In consequence, there is no information on efficacy of TAF in paediatric patients with 
impaired renal function. The MAH therefore proposed to include the sentence “No data are available to 
make dose recommendations in children aged less than 12 years with renal impairment” in section 4.2 
of the SmPC. This is considered acceptable. 
The justification of the dose and duration of treatment used for Study GS-US-320-1092 is in principle 
agreed. For further discussion of the adequacy of the TAF dosage of 25 mg for use in CHB patients 6 to 
< 12 years weighing ≥ 25 kg, please see sections PK and popPK. 
The duration of double-blind treatment for both cohorts was 24 weeks. After completing the double-
blind  phase, all participants were eligible to roll over to receive open label TAF 25 mg once daily for up 
to an additional 216 weeks, which is agreed. 
The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of participants with plasma HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL 
(the current limit of detection) at Week 24. Primary analysis was originally planned to be at Week 48. 
However, amendment 1 of the study protocol included a change to Week 24. This was accepted by the 
PDCO after consultation with the IDWP. The IDWP considered that 24 weeks for the double-blind, 
placebo-controlled phase is acceptable, but that 48-week data are necessary for the benefit/risk 
evaluation, particularly for the assessment of efficacy and resistance data. This interim analysis only 
contained data covering 24 weeks of treatment, which was considered to be insufficient to conclude on 
comparable efficacy of TAF treatment in CHB-infected children aged 6 to 12 years and weighing ≥ 25 
kg and adults. Given that the last subject finished the double-blind phase on 12 August 2021, data 
covering 48 weeks of treatment was available for the participants who received TAF in the double-blind 
phase. To enable adequate assessment of efficacy, the applicant provided 48-week data for the 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints delineating the respective overall efficacy as well as efficacy 
in the individual cohorts. Corresponding data from studies in CHB-infected adults were also provided 
for comparison. 
Although more participants from Cohort 2 Group 1 reached the primary endpoint of HBV DNA < 20 
IU/mL at Week 48 (3/12 (25%)) than at Week 24, the proportion was still lower than in Cohort 1 
(19/47 (40.4%)). Furthermore, a lower proportion of participants from Cohort 1 (44.7%) and Cohort 2 
Group 1 (41.7%) than adult participants (63.9%) reached the endpoint of HBV DNA ≤ 29 IU/ml. 
Importantly, however, mean declines in HBV DNA from baseline were similar also at Week 48 for all 
cohorts, with mean (SD) log10 IU/mL of -5.65 (1.78) for Cohort 1, -5.88 (0.86) for Cohort 2 Group 1 
and -5.75 (1.31) for adults. Thus, although there were considerable differences in the proportions of 
participants reaching HBV DNA ≤ 20 IU/mL (or 29 IU/mL), mean declines in HBV DNA from baseline 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155784/2023  
Page 51/83 
 
 
 
were similar. The CHMP is of the opinion that this indicates similar efficacy of TAF treatment in this 
respect.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the CHMP is of the view that viral suppression, ALT normalisation and change from baseline as 
well as HBeAg loss and seroconversion (further) improved from Week 24 to Week 48 and to a largely 
similar degree in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1 and as compared to adult participants. Also, 
considering that the additional data provided for the PopPK model indicate comparable exposure of TFV 
(AUCtau/Cmax) between CHB-infected adults and children aged 6-12 years and weighing ≥ 25 kg and 
that, hence, an extrapolation of the adult CHB efficacy data to the paediatric patients aged 6 to <12 
years is possible, it is overall concluded by the Committee that the efficacy data from study GS-US-
320-1092 are regarded as sufficient to support this extension of indication. 
Section 4.1 of the SmPC was amended accordingly: 
Vemlidy is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in adults and paediatric patients 
6 years of age and older weighing at least 25 kg (see section 5.1). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
In support of this application for extension of indications, the MAH presented safety data from the 
following clinical study: 
Table 19: Overview Study GS-US-320-1092 
Patient exposure 
All randomized participants received at least 1 dose of study drug and were included in the Safety 
Analysis Set. All 88 participants who were randomized completed the double-blind study drug. No 
participants discontinued study drug or the study during the double-blind phase. 
Overall, the majority of participants in each treatment group (TAF and placebo) had received blinded 
study drug at the time of the Week 24 data cutoff (TAF 98.3%, 58 of 59 participants; placebo 96.6%, 
28 of 29 participants). Overall exposure was similar between the 2 treatment groups, with a median 
(Q1, Q3) exposure of 24.1 (24.0, 24.4) weeks for participants who received TAF and 24.1 (24.0, 24.6) 
weeks for participants who received placebo.

Adverse events 
Summary of Adverse Events 
An overall summary of AEs by treatment group during the double-blind phase of Study GS-US-320-
1092 are presented in the table below. Overall, the incidence of AEs was similar between TAF and 
placebo treatment groups. In total, 59.3% (35 participants) in the TAF group and 55.2% (16 
participants) in the placebo group experienced at least 1 AE during double-blind treatment. 
The majority of the AEs in both TAF and placebo groups were Grade 1 (mild) in severity and were 
considered unrelated to study drug by the investigator. More participants in the TAF group (16.9%, 10 
participants) compared with the placebo group (10.3%, 3 participants) experienced an AE considered 
by the investigator to be related to study drug. Two participants in the placebo group experienced a 
Grade 3 (severe) AE. No Grade 3 AEs occurred in the TAF group, and no participant in either treatment 
group experienced a Grade 4 (life threatening) AE. The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was 
higher in the placebo group compared to the TAF group. None of the SAEs were considered to be 
related to TAF. 
No deaths occurred during the double-blind phase of the study, and no participant experienced an AE 
that led to premature study drug discontinuation.

Overall, 10 participants (16.9%) in the TAF group and 3 participants (10.3%) in the placebo group had 
AEs that were assessed by the investigator as related to study drug. Overall, headache was the most 
commonly reported study drug-related AE in participants who received TAF, reported in 8.5% (5 
participants). Other study drug-related AEs that occurred in > 1 participant who received TAF were 
nausea (5.1%, 3 participants), abdominal pain upper (3.4%, 2 participants), and fatigue (3.4%, 2 
participants). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events 
Overall, 3 participants, all in Cohort 1, experienced an SAE during the double-blind phase, 1 participant 
in the TAF group and 2 participants in the placebo group.  
•  One participant (TAF) experienced an SAE of Grade 2 scarlet fever from Day 106 to Day 110; 
considered not related to the study drug; no action was taken with study drug as a result of 
the SAE.  
• 
Two participants (placebo) experienced an SAE: Grade 3 ankle fracture (Day 7, trauma 
related); and Grade 3 ALT increased (Day 27, considered related to study drug).  
Deaths 
No deaths occurred during the double-blind phase of Study GS-US-320-1092.

Analysis of Adverse Events of special interest 
Bone Safety 
Bone Mineral Density 
The table below presents the mean and median percentage change from baseline in spine and whole 
body BMD at Week 24. At baseline, overall mean spine BMD values were similar for the TAF and 
placebo groups. At Week 24 of double-blind treatment, overall mean spine BMD had increased in both 
the TAF and placebo groups; no statistically significant differences were noted between treatment 
groups. The mean (SD) percent increase from baseline in spine BMD at Week 24 was +1.6% (5.13%) 
for the TAF group and +1.9% (2.80%) for the placebo group (P = 0.7672). Median spine BMD values 
for both treatment groups in Cohort 2 Group 1 were similar, indicating the negative mean value of 
1.2% (TAF) was driven by an outlier in this small sample size of 11 participants. 
At baseline, overall mean whole body BMD values were similar for the TAF and placebo groups. At 
Week 24 of double-blind treatment, mean whole body BMD had increased in both the TAF and placebo 
groups; no statistically significant differences were noted between treatment groups. The mean (SD) 
percent increase from baseline in whole body BMD at Week 24 was +1.9% (2.64%) for the TAF group 
and +2.0% (2.55%) for the placebo group (P = 0.8274; table below).

24 (Observed Data) (Spine and Whole Body DXA Analysis Sets, Double-blind Phase) 
Categorical Distribution of Percentage Change From Baseline in Bone Mineral Density 
Overall, differences between TAF and placebo in the categorical percent change from baseline were not 
statistically significant at Week 24 for either spine BMD (P = 0.8885) or whole body BMD (P = 0.6864).  
The cumulative incidence of ≥ 4% decrease from baseline in spine and whole body BMD at Week 24 
was assessed. In total, 4 participants (all in the TAF group, Cohort 2 Group 1) had a ≥ 4% decrease in 
spine BMD (3 participants) or whole body BMD (1 participant). No participant experienced both ≥ 4% 
decrease from baseline in spine and whole body BMD at Week 24. By BMD Z-scores, a clinically 
relevant marker, all 4 participants remained within normal range for their age and gender.  
Spine and Whole Body Bone Mineral Density Z-Scores 
Spine and whole body BMD was also assessed using available BMD Z-scores. The Z-score for any BMD 
value is the number of standard deviations it lies below or above the mean BMD of an age, sex, and 
race matched control group, and is dependent upon the DXA machine used (ie, Hologic or Lunar). A Z-

score ≤ −2.0 is  below the expected range for age and is considered to reflect a clinically relevant 
degree of low body mass or BMD, while a Z score > −2.0 is within the expected range for age. Overall, 
there was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups in shifts from baseline in 
spine or whole body BMD Z scores at Week 24 (P = 0.5105 and P = 0.1137, respectively). 
Spine and whole body BMD Z-scores were similar for the TAF and placebo groups at baseline. For both 
treatment groups, observed mean spine and whole body BMD Z score values were within the normal 
range for the participant population from baseline through 24 weeks of double blind treatment. 
Most participants in both treatment groups had spine and whole body BMD Z-scores > −1 at baseline 
and at Week 24. 
Overall, 3 participants (2 participants in Cohort 1 and 1 participant in Cohort 2 Group 1) who received 
TAF had a spine or whole body BMD Z-score ≤ −2 at Week 24 that also had a BMD Z score ≤ −2 at 
baseline. 
Fracture Events 
Fracture events during the double-blind phase of the study occurred in 3 participants, all within the 
placebo group. All fracture events were trauma-related, considered by the investigator to be unrelated 
to study drug, and did not result in study drug discontinuation. 
Fracture events included Grade 1 hand fracture, Grade 1 ankle fracture, and Grade 3 fibula fracture 
and ankle fracture. No action was taken with study drug for any of these trauma-related fracture 
events. All 3 of these participants had spine and whole body BMD Z-scores within the expected age 
range. 
Bone Events 
No participant had a bone event other than fractures described above, and no participant had an AE of 
BMD decrease during double-blind treatment. 
Bone Biochemical Markers 
The table below presents median percentage change from baseline in serum markers of bone turnover, 
including serum markers of bone formation (osteocalcin, procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide 
[P1NP]) and bone resorption (C-telopeptide) at Week 24. At baseline, overall median levels of 
biomarkers were similar between TAF and placebo groups and there were no statistically significant 
differences between groups in median changes of bone biomarkers (including serum parathyroid 
hormone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D) from baseline at Week 24.

Renal Adverse Events 
One participant in TAF Cohort 2 Group 1 experienced non-serious, Grade 1 proteinuria on Day 2 of 
double-blind treatment. The AE was considered not related to study drug and no action was taken in

Renal Laboratory Parameters 
At baseline, median (Q1, Q3) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was not significantly different 
for the TAF and placebo groups (TAF 154 [137, 169] mL/min, placebo 149 [143, 180] mL/min). Slight 
fluctuations in median eGFR were noted for both treatment groups over time. At Week 24, a greater 
decrease in median eGFR was noted in the TAF group compared with placebo (TAF −9 (−19, 2) 
mL/min; placebo −1 (−7, 7) mL/min; P = 0.0303; table below), while median eGFR remained within 
normal range at Week 24 in both groups and at no time point during double-blind treatment did any 
participant in either treatment group have an eGFR value that dropped below the normal range cutoff 
of 90 mL/min/1.73m2. 
Table 25: GS-US-320-1092: Median (Q1, Q3) Change From Baseline in eGFRSchwartz (mL/min) at 
Week 24 (Safety Analysis Set, Double-blind Phase) 
At baseline, mean serum creatinine levels were similar for participants in the TAF (0.65 mg/dL) and 
placebo groups (0.65 mg/dL) overall. Serum creatinine remained similar to baseline during the double-
blind phase for both the TAF and placebo groups, with mean increases from baseline of +0.05 mg/dL 
and +0.01 mg/dL, respectively, at Week 24. When evaluated by treatment cohort, at Week 24, a 
greater increase in mean serum creatinine was noted in the TAF groups compared with placebo 
(Cohort 1 mean increase from baseline of 0.04 mg/dL and 0.02 mg/dL for TAF and placebo, 
respectively; Cohort 2 Group 1 mean increase from baseline of 0.05 mg/dL and a mean decrease 0.01 
mg/dL for TAF and placebo, respectively.  
No graded creatinine abnormalities were noted during the double-blind phase. 
Confirmed renal abnormalities were defined as an increase from baseline in creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL, an 
increase from baseline in creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dL, occurrence of serum phosphorous below 2.0 mg/dL, 
eGFRSchwartz < 50 mL/min, or eGFRSchwartz < 70 mL/min at 2 consecutive postbaseline visits. No 
participant had a confirmed renal abnormality through Week 24, after receiving double blind 
treatment.

All 88 participants had at least 1 postbaseline urine protein value. Of these, the majority of participants 
in each treatment group did not have any treatment-emergent proteinuria, as assessed by dipstick 
analysis. Most of the occurrences of proteinuria by dipstick were Grade 1 (TAF 22.2%, 13 of 59 
participants; placebo 10.3%, 3 of 29 participants); no participant in either treatment group had Grade 
3 proteinuria by dipstick. When evaluated by treatment cohort, a similar proportion of participants had 
Grade 1 proteinuria in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1. 
At Week 24, median (Q1, Q3) percentage decreases from baseline occurred in both the TAF and 
placebo groups for the renal biomarkers of urine retinol-binding protein to creatinine ratio and urine 
beta 2 microglobulin to creatinine ratio; these between-group differences were not statistically 
significant (P = 0.5681 and P = 0.6300, respectively). Similar results were seen when evaluated by 
study cohort.  
Laboratory findings 
The majority of participants had a postbaseline graded laboratory abnormality during the double blind 
phase, with a higher proportion occurring in the placebo group (74.6% of participants who received 
TAF and 96.6% of participants who received placebo). The graded abnormalities in both treatment 
groups were mainly Grade 1 or 2. A similar percentage of participants in each group had Grade 3 or 4 
laboratory abnormalities (TAF 11.9%, 7 participants total; placebo 13.8%, 4 participants). 
A Grade 3 hematology abnormality of decreased platelets was noted in 1 participant (TAF, Cohort 1) at 
Week 12 (49 ×103/uL) (normal range 140-400 × 103/uL). This participant had a low platelet level at 
baseline (51 ×103/uL) and platelet levels fluctuated at Grade 1 and Grade 2 toxicity through double-
blind treatment. 
Grade 3 or 4 chemistry abnormalities included increased ALT (TAF 6.8%, 4 participants; placebo 6.9%, 
2 participants) and increased AST (placebo 6.9%, 2 participants). Urinalysis Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities 
included occult blood (1 participant in each group, Cohort 1), and hematuria (TAF 9.1%, 3 participants, 
placebo 6.3%, 1 participant). 
Alanine aminotransferase elevation and ALT flare were evaluated during the double-blind phase as 
follows: 
Elevation of ALT was defined as serum ALT > 2 × baseline value and > 10 × upper limit of normal, 
with or without associated symptoms. All treatment emergent ALT elevations, including confirmed ALT 
elevations (referred to as an ALT flare, which was defined as elevated ALT at two consecutive 
postbaseline visits) were summarized for the double-blind phase. 
During double-blind treatment, 1 participant (1.7%) in the TAF group and 2 participants (6.9%) in the 
placebo group met criteria for ALT elevation. Two participants (both in the placebo group) experienced 
an ALT flare, one of which was reported as an SAE. Both of the participants with ALT flare had graded 
elevations in ALT at baseline, total bilirubin values remained normal, neither had an increase in HBV 
DNA; and both remained HBsAg positive. Both of the participants were also HBeAg positive at the time 
of ALT flare and one of the two participants experienced HBeAg loss at Week 24.  
Overall, fasting lipid parameters remained stable during double-blind treatment, with no major 
between-group differences at Week 24. Median (Q1, Q3) changes from baseline at Week 24 for fasting 
lipid parameters in each treatment group were as follows: 
• 
• 
Total cholesterol: TAF −3 (−9, 11) mg/dL; placebo −2 (−9, 13) mg/dL 
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol: TAF 1 (−8, 10) mg/dL; placebo 0 (−9, 16) mg/dL

Page 61/83 
 
 
 
•  High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol: TAF 0 (−6, 3) mg/dL; placebo 0 (−6, 7) mg/dL 
• 
• 
Total cholesterol to HDL ratio: TAF 0.0 (−0.2, 0.3) mg/dL; placebo 0.0 (−0.1, 0.3) mg/dL 
Triglycerides: TAF −1 (−16, 17) mg/dL; placebo −5 (−26, 9) mg/dL 
Median (Q1, Q3) changes from baseline at Week 24 for fasting glucose were:  
• 
TAF 1 (−3, 4) mg/dL; placebo 1 (−2, 3) mg/dL  
No participant in either treatment group had a Grade 3 or 4 abnormality in any fasting metabolic 
parameters. 
Tanner Staging 
As expected for the study population of Cohort 1 (adolescent participants aged 12 to < 18 years), the 
majority of males and females were categorized at Tanner Stage 3 through 5 through Week 24 and for 
the study population of Cohort 2 Group 1 (children aged 6 to < 12 years weighing ≥ 25 kg), the 
majority of males and females were categorized at Tanner Stage 1 to 2 (prepubertal) through Week 
24. 
Body Weight, Height, and Body Mass Index 
Body weight, height, and BMI at baseline were similar between the treatment groups. Median (Q1, Q3) 
changes in body weight, height, and BMI from baseline at Week 24 were similar for TAF and placebo. 
During double-blind treatment, the median change from baseline in Z scores for body weight, height, 
and BMI at Week 24 was not statistically different between TAF and placebo. 
Safety in special populations 
No additional safety analyses for intrinsic or extrinsic factors were performed in Study GS-US-320-
1092. Therefore, no new findings relevant to intrinsic and extrinsic factors are submitted with this 
update to the initial application. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug interaction studies with TAF have been conducted in paediatric participants with CHB 6 to <18 
years old. No new findings relevant to the co-administration of TAF with other drugs are submitted 
with this update to the marketing application. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No participant prematurely discontinued the double-blind phase of the study due to an AE. 
Post marketing experience 
No post marketing safety data were submitted.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The MAH submitted safety data from Study GS-US-320-1092 in support of this application of extension 
of indication. Vemlidy is already approved in adolescents aged 12 years and older with body weight at 
least 35kg, which corresponds to Cohort 1 of Study GS-US-320-1092. For the population applied for in 
this extension of indication application (paediatric patients between 6 and 12 years of age and 
weighing at least 25 kg), safety data were limited to 12 patients who received TAF during Study GS-
US-320-1092 (Cohort 2 Group 1). This was considered acceptable by the CHMP since the popPK 
modelling indicates that exposure (AUCtau and Cmax) is comparable between paediatric patients aged 6 
to 12 years and weighing ≥  25 kg and adults with CHB infection.  
The safety data of Cohort 2 Group 1 are in principle comparable to safety data from Cohort 1 
(adolescents) and adults. For a more profound comparison, the MAH provided week 48 interim safety 
data from Study GS-US-320-1092, which included data from patients who received TAF over 48 weeks 
in the double-blind (DB) and OL phases for participants in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1, and patients 
in the PBO group who crossed-over to TAF (PBO-TAF) at Week 24 and entered the OL phase. 
Furthermore, a comparison of these data to week 48 data from adult studies (GS-US-320-0108 and 
GS-US-320-0110) was presented. Overall, it was concluded by the Committee that Vemlidy was well 
tolerated during paediatric Study GS-US-320-1092 until week 48 and no new safety signal was 
identified.  
The MAH further committed that long-term data from open-label phase will be provided as soon as 
possible. 
Serious adverse event and deaths 
Serious Adverse Events 
During double-blind phase of Study GS-US-320-1092, SAEs were reported in three patients. One 
patient in the TAF group (Cohort 1) experienced an SAE of Grade 2 scarlet fever considered not related 
to study drug. The other two SAEs were observed in the placebo group (ankle fracture, Grade 3 ALT 
increased). No SAEs were observed in the target paediatric population (paediatric patients between 6 
and 12 years of age and weighing at least 25 kg). Overall, no safety signal could be identified. 
Deaths 
No deaths occurred during the double-blind phase of Study GS-US-320-1092. 
Analysis of Adverse Events of special interest 
Bone Safety 
Regarding the provided information from Study GS-US-320-1092 week 48 data about bone safety, 
overall, 3 patients in the TAF group (1 in Cohort 1 and 2 in Cohort 2 Group 1) and 2 patients in the 
PBO-TAF group (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1, one each) had ≥ 4% BMD decreases from baseline in 
spine and whole body BMD at Week 48 and 3 additional patients (1 from Cohort 1 and 2 from Cohort 2 
Group 1) had a ≥ 4% decrease in BMD at spine or whole body after Week 48, while a ≥ 4% decrease 
was transient for 3 out of these 8 patients and all 8 patients had normal Z-scores for their age at Week 
48 and subsequently recorded study visits. For both treatment groups, observed mean spine and 
whole body BMD Z-score values were within the normal range from baseline through Week 48. 
Fracture events were reported in 2 patients during the OL phase (patella fracture [Cohort 1 TAF group] 
and tibia fracture [Cohort 2 Group 1 PBO-TAF group]). Both fracture events were trauma-related, 
considered by the investigator to be unrelated to study drug.

Overall, the MAH included specific information about changes in bone mineral density in Study GS-US-
320-1092 into Section 5.1 of the SmPC. Specifically, a table was included with information about bone 
mineral density decreases of 4% or greater for paediatric patients at weeks 24 and 48, which is agreed 
by the CHMP. Furthermore, the MAH adapted the warning on BMD in section 4.4 and the information in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC in this regard, as follows: 
Section 4.4 
Paediatric population 
Reductions in BMD (≥4%) of the spine and of total body-less-head (TBLH) have been reported in some 
paediatric patients aged between 6 and <12 years who received Vemlidy. There are uncertainties 
associated with the long-term effects of bone and renal toxicity on the growing bone, including the risk 
of fracture. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is recommended to decide the appropriate 
monitoring during treatment. 
Furthermore, the following paragraph in Section 4.8 of the SmPC was amended as follows: 
Section 4.8 
Paediatric population 
The safety of Vemlidy was evaluated in 88 HBV infected treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced 
paediatric patients aged 12 to < 18 years weighing ≥ 35 kg (TAF group N=47, placebo group N=23) 
and 6 to < 12 years weighing ≥ 25 kg (TAF group N=12, placebo group N=6) through Week 24 in a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study GS-US-320-1092. In this study no new 
adverse reactions have been described in paediatric patients aged 6 years and older living with CHB as 
compared to adult subjects. After 24 weeks of treatment with Vemlidy, reductions in BMD of the spine 
and of whole body BMD ≥ 4% have been reported in 33.3% (4/12) and 8.3% (1/12) of children aged 6 
to < 12 years weighing at least 25 kg (see section 4.4). 
The warning on BMD in section 4.4 of the SmPC was also implemented in section 2 of the PL as follows 
(marked in bold): 
2. What you need to know before you take Vemlidy 
… 
Warnings and precautions 
… 
Children and adolescents              
Do not give this medicine to children who are under 6 years old, or weighing less than 25 kg. It has 
not been tested in children aged less than 6 years old, and or weighing less than 25 kg. 
Bone problems. Reductions in bone density have been reported in some paediatric patients 
who received Vemlidy and long-term effects on growing bone, including the risk of 
fractures, are uncertain. Your doctor will carefully decide how to monitor this possible risk. 
Tell your doctor if any bone pain or fractures occur.   
In addition to the precautionary statement concerning the bone safety in children 6 to < 12 years 
weighing ≥ 25 kg, the CHMP is of the view that these events in children and adolescents should be 
monitored in upcoming PSURs. Furthermore, it shall be noted that the SmPC of Vemlidy (and of the 
other medicinal products containing TAF) will be subject to further revisions/amendments when more 
data becomes available.

Renal Safety 
Overall, one renal Adverse Event was reported in one patient in the TAF group from Cohort 2 Group 1 
(non-serious, grade 1 proteinuria, considered not related to study drug). 
The median change from baseline in eGFRSchwartz (mL/min) at Week 24 was more pronounced in TAF 
treated patients in Cohort 2 Group 1 (-14) compared to adolescents in Cohort 1 (-6) and higher as in 
the placebo group (-1). At Week 24, a greater increase in mean serum creatinine was noted in the TAF 
groups compared with placebo (Cohort 1 mean increase from baseline of 0.04 mg/dL and 0.02 mg/dL 
for TAF and placebo, respectively; Cohort 2 Group 1 mean increase from baseline of 0.05 mg/dL and a 
mean decrease 0.01 mg/dL for TAF and placebo, respectively). No graded creatinine abnormalities 
were noted during the double-blind phase. No patient had a confirmed renal abnormality through Week 
24, after receiving double blind treatment. Most of the occurrences of proteinuria by dipstick were 
Grade 1 (TAF 22.2%, 13 of 59 participants; placebo 10.3%, 3 of 29 participants); no participant in 
either treatment group had Grade 3 proteinuria by dipstick. When evaluated by treatment cohort, a 
similar proportion of participants had Grade 1 proteinuria in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1. No 
significant differences in week 24 median percentage decreases from baseline for the renal biomarkers 
of urine retinol-binding protein to creatinine ratio and urine beta 2 microglobulin to creatinine ratio was 
observed between TAF groups and placebo groups and between cohorts. 
As outlined in the SmPC of Vemlidy (section 4.4), a potential risk of nephrotoxicity resulting from 
chronic exposure to low levels of tenofovir due to dosing with tenofovir alafenamide cannot be 
excluded. It is recommended that renal function is assessed in all patients prior to, or when initiating, 
therapy with this treatment and that it is also monitored during therapy in all patients as clinically 
appropriate. In patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function, or evidence of 
proximal renal tubulopathy, discontinuation of this medicinal product should be considered. In addition, 
the paragraph “Paediatric population”, as requested above, should be added to address the 
uncertainties on the impact of long-term exposure of TAF in children on the growing bone in terms of 
fracture risk associated with renal toxicity. Furthermore, the SmPC of Vemlidy (and of the other 
medicinal products containing tenofovir alafenamide) could be subject to further 
revisions/amendments when more data becomes available. 
In addition, the MAH should continue to monitor renal safety with Vemlidy in paediatric patients and 
adolescents via routine Pharmacovigilance. 
Laboratory findings 
Overall, no differences in laboratory findings could be identified between TAF group and placebo group 
and between Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1. No safety signal could be identified. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No participant prematurely discontinued the double-blind phase of the study due to an AE. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, Vemlidy was well tolerated during paediatric Study GS-US-320-1092. Specific information 
about changes in bone mineral density were introduced into sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 9.1 in the framework of a variation procedure to extend  
the indication to include treatment of chronic hepatitis B-infected children from 6 years and older and 
weighing at least 25 kilograms for Vemlidy, based on the interim results from Week 24 clinical study 
report (CSR) for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1 and supporting modular summaries for the category 3 
study GS-US-320-1092, ‘A Randomized, Double-Blind Evaluation of the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and 
Antiviral Efficacy of Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF) in Children and Adolescent Subjects with Chronic 
Hepatitis B Virus Infection’.  
The MAH submitted safety data from Study GS-US-320-1092 in support of this application of extension 
of indication. Vemlidy is already approved in adolescents aged 12 years and older with body weight at 
least 35kg, which corresponds to Cohort 1 of Study GS-US-320-1092. Safety data for this extension of 
indication application (paediatric patients between 6 and 12 years of age and weighing at least 25 kg) 
are limited to 12 patients who received TAF during Study GS-US-320-1092 (Cohort 2 Group 1) for 24 
weeks. 
However, considering that the last subject finished the double-blind phase of Study GS-US-320-1092 
in August 2021, the CHMP requested the MAH to provide 48 week safety data for the patients who 
received TAF in the double-blind phase. These safety data, together with longer-term data from open-
label phase are necessary to allow for a more in-depth safety assessment and comparison with 
available data for adults. Therefore, a further interim submission of Week 96 safety data for study GS
US
320
1092 was considered appropriate. Of note, a 96w cut off analysis to evaluate the open-label 
safety of TAF given once daily in adolescents and children with CHB is already planned according to 
‐
‐
Study 1092 Protocol.   
‐
As requested by CHMP and PRAC the Applicant planned to submit the long-term (Week 96) safety data 
(Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1) from Study GS-US-320-1092 in Q3 2023 as outlined in the updated 
EU RMP v 9.1. 
The revised RMP v 9.1 has been integrated with the outcome of the approved 
EMEA/H/C/004169/II/0038 procedure. 
As also recommended by CHMP, the MAH should present, in upcoming PSURs, bone related events in 
children and adolescents.  
2.7.  CHMP conclusion on Safety Specification and Safety Concerns  
The MAH submitted a Risk Management Plan updated to version 8.2, dated 17 May 2022.  
The MAH was requested to provide an integrated updated RMP version; version 9.1 was provided 
accordingly (i.e. version containing the approved outcome of EMEA/H/C/004169/II/0038 procedure

2.8.2.  Overall conclusions on the PhV Plan  
The Committee, having considered the data submitted, is of the opinion that the proposed post-
authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product. 
Submission of long-term (Week 96) safety data (Cohort 1, and Cohort 2 Group 1) from Study GS-US-
320-1092 in Q3 2023 has been outlined in the updated EU RMP v9.1. RMP Table Part III.1. Ongoing 
and Planned Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities has been updated accordingly.   
2.9.  Plans for post-authorisation efficacy studies  
There are no planned or ongoing post-authorization efficacy studies.

2.10.  Risk minimisation measures 
2.10.1.  Routine Risk Minimisation Measures 
Only routine risk minimization measures are in place for Vemlidy. 
Vemlidy is subject to restricted medical prescription, whereby therapy should be initiated by a 
physician experienced in the management of chronic hepatitis B 
Table Part V.1: Description of routine risk minimisation measures by safety concern 
With this submission, no changes to the RMMs are proposed. Missing information “Long-term safety 
information in adults and adolescents” has been reformulated in “Long-term safety information in 
adults and children 6 years of age and older weighing at least 25 kg” according to proposed 
amendments in RMP Part II. This is endorsed by the Committee. 
2.10.2.  Additional risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimization activities as described in Part V Section V.1 are considered sufficient to 
manage the safety concerns of the medicinal product.  
2.10.3.  Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures 
The Committee, having considered the updated data submitted, is of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures remain sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed 
indications.

2.12.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
The changes to the RMP are considered acceptable to the Committee.  
2.13.  Update of the Product information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are being updated to 
extend the indication to include treatment of chronic hepatitis B-infected children from 6 years and 
older and weighing at least 25 kilograms. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the 
wording in section 4.6 of the SmPC related to breastfeeding and pregnancies. The Package Leaflet (PL) 
is updated accordingly. 
Changes are also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template version. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in Romania in the PL is being revised. 
2.13.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
Paediatric patients aged 6 years and older and weighing at least 25 kilograms will receive the currently 
approved strength and pharmaceutical form for Vemlidy (i.e. 25 mg tablets) and no significant changes 
have been made to the package leaflet of the authorised strength of Vemlidy with the addition of the 
new indication. Paragraphs concerning the paediatric population are added. Design, layout, and format 
are continued. Key messages concerning safe use are not affected. Therefore, the Consultation with 
Target Patient Groups (eCTD 0002) that was provided within the initial marketing authorisation 
application can be used to demonstrate that the leaflet meets the requirements of article 59(3) of 
Council Directive 2001/83/EC.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a major public health care issue worldwide and one of the principal causes 
of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is 
easily transmissible through perinatal, percutaneous, and sexual exposure. Following acute HBV 
infection, 5% to 10% of adults and up to 90% of children fail to produce an immune response 
adequate to clear the infection; these individuals become chronic carriers of the virus. Individuals who 
develop CHB are at substantial risk of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and HCC, which will afflict 
15% to 40% of patients with CHB in the absence of effective treatment. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) estimates that 296 million people were living with CHB infection in 2019, with 1.5 million new 
infections each year. In 2013, an estimated 686,000 deaths were due to HBV infection, placing it 
among the top 20 causes of mortality worldwide. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The goal of anti-HBV therapy in children, as in adults, is to improve long-term survival and quality of 
life by reducing disease progression to cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and HCC. The aim of 
oral antiviral treatment for CHB infection is to achieve and maintain suppression of viral replication to 
prevent or reduce the development of these complications.  
The majority of children aged 2 to < 18 years have persistently normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
values and high levels of HBV DNA, consistent with the immune-tolerant phase. However, immune 
activation does occur in a minority of children in whom antiviral therapy can provide benefits with 
regard to halting disease progression and its complications later in childhood or during young 
adulthood. All current guidelines suggest that antiviral therapy be considered in HBeAg positive 
children who have both elevated ALT and HBV DNA levels with the goal of achieving and maintaining 
viral suppression and producing sustained HBeAg seroconversion. Although HBeAg negative CHB is less 
commonly seen in children, it is generally accepted that long-term treatment is required in the absence 
of confirmed HBsAg seroconversion in HBeAg negative children with elevated ALT and HBV DNA levels. 
Treatment options for children are similar to those for adults. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), a 
nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor with antiviral activity against both HBV and HIV, 
and entecavir (ETV), a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor, are both recommended as 
first line treatment in all major guidelines for adults with CHB. Similarly, all major guidelines updated 
since approval of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) in 2016 also list this agent as a first-line treatment in 
adults. Although TDF is approved for use in children and adolescent patients aged 2 to < 18 years with 
chronic HBV, bone and renal toxicities, including proximal tubulopathy and Fanconi syndrome, have 
been reported with TDF. The negative effects of TDF on bone metabolism, especially in adolescents 
and children who have not attained peak bone mass, are clinically concerning. Tenofovir alafenamide 
currently is only indicated for adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older with body weight at 
least 35 kg).

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study GS-US-320-1092 is an ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of the safety, 
tolerability, PK, and antiviral activity of TAF administered once daily in treatment-naive and treatment-
experienced adolescents and children with CHB. Participants were randomised to receive either blinded 
TAF 25 mg tablets or placebo tablets once daily through Week 24, and the primary efficacy endpoint 
was the percentage of participants who achieved HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL at Week 24. Following double 
blind treatment for 24 weeks, all participants were eligible to roll over to receive open label TAF for up 
to an additional 216 weeks (through Week 240).  
The data presented are from the interim, primary endpoint analysis for safety, efficacy, and PK, which 
was conducted when all participants in Cohort 1 (adolescents 12 to less than 18 years of age and 
weighing at least 35 kg) and Cohort 2 Group 1 (paediatric participants 6 to < 12 years of age and 
weighing at least 25 kg) had completed their Week 24 (i.e., primary endpoint) visit or prematurely 
discontinued from the study. In response to the RSI, the MAH also provided 48-week efficacy and 
safety data for the participants from the TAF groups who received TAF for an additional 24 weeks 
during the open label phase and a comparison with data of HBeAg-positive adults treated with TAF 25 
mg once daily in the Phase 3 Study GS-US-320-0110. 
TAF is currently approved for use in adult and adolescent patients with CHB weighing at least 35 kg in 
the EU and other regions. Therefore, in particular the data from Cohort 2 Group 1 are relevant for this 
application to extend the indication to CHB-infected children from 6 years and older and weighing at 
least 25 kg. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The provided data indicate that the popPK model reasonably well captured the observed TFV 
concentrations in paediatric HBV patients. The boxplots comparing exposure metrics (AUC, Cmax and 
Ctau) of younger patients to the 90% prediction interval of adult exposure showed that median AUC of 
the younger patients was below the median of adult values but the 25% to 75% interval was still 
comprised in the adult 90% prediction interval. Therefore, AUC values can be considered comparable 
between adults and younger patients with HBV. Cmax values in younger patients were also similar to 
adult Cmax. Hence, extrapolation of efficacy and safety data from adults to children 6 to < 12 years of 
age and weighing at least 25 kg is generally considered acceptable. 
The percentage of participants with plasma HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL at Week 24 was significantly higher 
in the TAF group (18.6% [11/59 participants]; 95% CI: 9.7% to 30.9%) than in the placebo group 
(0% [0/29 participants]; 95% CI: 0.0% to 11.9%) (P = 0.0137). Thus, the primary efficacy endpoint 
was met. 
Furthermore, treatment with TAF resulted in rapid, progressive and substantial mean declines in HBV 
DNA levels over time. A similar mean decrease in HBV DNA levels was observed for participants in 
Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1 and adult participants from study GS-US-320-0110. Thus, while 
achievement of virologic suppression below HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL was more common in Cohort 1 than 
in Cohort 2 Group 1 (21.3% for Cohort 1 and 8.3% for Cohort 2 Group 1 at Week 24 and 40.4% for 
Cohort 1 and 25% for Cohort 2 Group 1 at Week 48), virologic suppression with respect to reduction in 
HBV DNA levels over time was similar. Moreover, a similar rate of ALT normalisation over time was 
observed for participants in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1 (for both Central Lab and AASLD criteria; 
although ALT normalisation following AASLD criteria was lower in Cohort 2 Group 1 than in Cohort 1 at 
early time points, it was similar at Week 24 and Week 48) and adult participants from study GS-US-
320-0110. These supportive data suggest largely similar efficacy of TAF treatment in paediatric 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155784/2023  
Page 72/83 
 
 
 
participants 6 to < 12 years of age weighing at least 25 kg, adolescents 12 to < 18 years of age 
weighing at least 35 kg and adults. 
No HBV amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to TAF were detected in clinical isolates 
from paediatric patients. As part of the response to the RSI, the MAH submitted the Week 48 Virology 
Study Report for Study GS-US-320-1092 (Report No. PC-320-2022). One participant qualified for 
phenotypic analysis due to a conserved site change (V112V/I). This is the same subject who had a 
conserved site change (V112V/I) at week 24. Phenotypic analysis showed that there was no change in 
sensitivity to TAF compared to the baseline isolate at week 24 and week 48. Analyses regarding 
polymorphic site change N118N/T indicated that there is no association with reduced susceptibility or 
resistance to TAF. Overall, the clinical virology data of study GS-US-320-1092 do not indicate a higher 
risk for the development of resistance in paediatric subjects from 6 to < 18 years of age receiving TAF 
25 mg once daily after 48 weeks of treatment.   
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Ctau was clearly lower in younger HBV patients compared to adults with HBV, even the upper whisker 
boundary was below the 5th percentile of the adult 90% prediction interval. Since the applied dose for 
HBV patients aged 6 to 12 years is the same as for adults, a higher TAF dose for treatment of younger 
patients was considered questionable for safety reasons. The MAH submitted an updated analysis of 
the exposure in paediatric patients compared to adults. Particularly for Ctau, a considerable proportion 
of paediatric patients had lower exposures as compared to adults. The underlying reason of this finding 
remains unclear, in particular as flat dosing of 25 mg QD was used for paediatric and adult 
participants, which raises the question if the presented data on TAF and TFV exposure in paediatric 
CHB patients are correct. Thus, the safety concerns regarding the question where the remaining drug 
might be distributed and how it is metabolised were not fully addressed. However, the MAH argued 
that the efficacy response rate was not dependent upon the Ctau concentration, which is agreed.  
In the population PK model used for evaluation of the PK in the paediatric population of Biktarvy and 
Vemlidy, no impact of indication (HIV versus HBV) on clearance in the paediatric population was found. 
This is seen to be in contradiction to the observed exposures differing between the two indications 
(lower exposure in paediatric HBV patients as compared to paediatric HIV patients), which indicates 
potential differences in clearance, as also mentioned by the MAH. This limits the credibility of the 
model. The MAH provided additional VPCs and exposure boxplots and argued that differences between 
CHB and HIV patients in the former results may have occurred due to the limitations of a non-
compartmental PK analysis. No VPC stratified by weight was submitted (all weights ≥ 25 kg 
bodyweight were presented in one summarised plot). 
In Study GS-US-320-1092, suppression rates at Week 24 (18.6% for all participants, 21.3% for Cohort 
1 and 8.3% for Cohort 2 Group 1) were generally lower than those observed at Week 24 in HBeAg-
positive adults treated with TAF 25 mg once daily in the Phase 3 Study GS-US-320-0110 (34.6% 
[201/581] participants had HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL). In particular, of the 12 participants receiving TAF in 
Cohort 2 Group 1, only 1 participant (8.3%) reached the primary endpoint. Thus, the 24-week data are 
not sufficient to conclude on efficacy of TAF treatment in this population. Of note, primary analysis was 
originally planned to be at Week 48. However, amendment 1 of the study protocol included a change 
to Week 24, which was accepted by the PDCO after consultation with the IDWP. The IDWP considered 
that 24 weeks for the double-blind, placebo-controlled phase is acceptable, but that 48-week data are 
necessary for the benefit/risk evaluation, particularly for the assessment of efficacy and resistance 
data. In response to the RSI, the MAH provided the requested 48-week efficacy data and a comparison 
with adult data: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155784/2023  
Page 73/83 
 
 
 
The primary endpoint of HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL was reached by 10/47 (21.3%) participants from 
Cohort 1 at Week 24 and 19/47 (40.4%) at Week 48. Of the participants from Cohort 2 Group 1, 1/12 
(8.3%) had reached the primary endpoint at Week 24 whereas 3/12 (25%) did so at Week 48. Thus, 
although more participants from Cohort 2 Group 1 reached the primary endpoint at Week 48 than at 
Week 24, the proportion was still lower than in Cohort 1. As mentioned before, possible explanations 
for this are the higher proportion of participants with high baseline viral load (75% versus 64% with 
baseline HBV DNA level ≥8.0 log10 IU/mL) and a higher proportion of the participants with HBV 
genotype D (58.3% versus 39.5%) – both factors that have been associated with a slower rate of viral 
suppression. Furthermore, it needs to be considered that only 12 patients were investigated in Cohort 
2 Group 1 of study GS-US-320-1092. Therefore, the significance of the efficacy data from Cohort 2 
Group 1 is too limited to draw any firm conclusion. 
For comparison with adult data from study GS-US-320-0110, the threshold for HBV DNA had to be 
adjusted to the LLOQ at that time of ≤ 29 IU/ml. Under these conditions, 21/47 (44.7%) participants 
from Cohort 1, 5/12 (41.7%) participants from Cohort 2 Group 1 and 371/581 (63.9%) adult 
participants reached the endpoint. Thus, a lower proportion of participants from Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 
Group 1 than adult participants reached this endpoint. Possible explanations, also in this case, are the 
higher proportion of paediatric participants with high baseline viral load (66% vs 47% with baseline 
HBV DNA level ≥8.0 log10 IU/mL) and a higher proportion of the participants with HBV genotype D 
(44% versus 23%). 
Importantly, mean declines in HBV DNA from baseline were similar at Week 48 for all cohorts with 
mean (SD) log10 IU/mL of -5.65 (1.78) for Cohort 1, -5.88 (0.86) for Cohort 2 Group 1 and -5.75 
(1.31) for adults. Thus, although there were considerable differences in the proportions of participants 
reaching HBV DNA ≤ 20 IU/mL (or 29 IU/mL), mean declines in HBV DNA from baseline were similar. 
This indicates comparable efficacy of TAF treatment in this respect.  
Subgroup analysis confirmed that the subgroup with high viral load (≥8.0 log10 IU/mL) at baseline, 
representing the majority of the paediatric participants (66.1%), still showed a less robust treatment 
response at Week 48. However, there was notable improvement in HBV DNA levels as compared to 
Week 24. Moreover, the proportion with HBV DNA ≤ 20 IU/mL increased from 6.7% at Week 24 to 
26.7% at Week 48 for Cohort 1 and from 0.0% to 22.2% for Cohort 2 Group 1. Thus, also in the 
subgroups with higher viral load, viral suppression improved over time and to a similar degree. 
Of the participants in the respective TAF groups, 39.5% from Cohort 1 and 58.3% from Cohort 2 
Group 1 had HBV genotype D at baseline. No participant with genotype D had achieved plasma HBV 
DNA ≤ 20 IU/mL at Week 24. At Week 48, 3/17 (17.6%) participants from Cohort 1 and 1/7 (14.3%) 
participants from Cohort 2 Group 1 with genotype D had achieved HBV DNA ≤ 20 IU/mL. An additional 
2/17 (11.8%) participants and 2/7 (28.6%) participants achieved HBV DNA between 20 and 69 IU/mL, 
respectively. Thus, also in the subgroup of participants with HBV genotype D, viral suppression 
improved over time and to a similar degree. 
Of note, the progressive increase in ALT normalisation over the 48-week treatment period suggests 
that the proportion of participants with normalised ALT may even further increase over time with long-
term treatment. The persistence of ALT normalization on long-term treatment trends will be monitored 
through Week 240 in the open-label extension phase of the study. 
The proportion of participants with abnormal ALT at baseline that had achieved normalised ALT was 
similar or larger for participants of Cohort 1 and Cohorts 2 Group 1 than for adult participants at both 
Week 24 and Week 48 and for both Central Lab criteria and AASLD criteria. 
Median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline in ALT at Week 48 was similar for participants in Cohort 1 and 
Cohort 2 Group 1 with -38.0 U/L (-70.0, -12.0) and -30.0 U/L (-82.0, -2.5), respectively. In adult 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155784/2023  
Page 74/83 
 
 
 
participants, ALT decrease was larger with -55.0 U/L (-106.0, -25.0). However, as mentioned above, 
median (Q1, Q3) ALT at baseline also was higher for adult participants (85 U/L (61, 139)) than for 
paediatric participants (65 U/L (50, 109)), which relativises this difference.  
Consistent with early serological outcomes in paediatric studies with TDF (GS-US-174-0144 and GS-
US-174-0115), the impact of TAF treatment on serological endpoints (HBeAg loss/seroconversion and 
HBsAg loss/seroconversion) was not different to placebo at Week 24. At Week 48, similar proportions 
of participants from Cohort 1 (7/46 (15.2%)) and Cohort 2 Group 1 (3/12 (25.0%)) and adult 
participants (13.8%) showed HBeAg loss. Furthermore, similar proportions of participants from Cohort 
1 (6/46 participants (13.0%), Cohort 2 Group 1 (2/12 participants (16.7%)) and adult participants 
(10.3%) achieved HBeAg seroconversion. HBsAg loss and seroconversion were achieved by no 
paediatric participants and only very few adult participants (4 participants (0.7%) and 3 participants, 
respectively) until Week 48. Longer term treatment is needed to more fully assess the impact of TAF 
on serological outcomes. There was only minimal fibrosis response after 48 weeks of treatment. 
Longer term treatment is needed to more fully assess the impact of TAF on fibrosis response in this 
population. The MAH committed to provide long-term data from the open label phase as soon as 
possible.    
Overall, viral suppression, ALT normalisation and change from baseline as well as HBeAg loss and 
seroconversion (further) improved from Week 24 to Week 48 and to a largely similar degree in Cohort 
1 and Cohort 2 Group 1 and as compared to adult participants. The differences in the proportions of 
participants achieving HBV DNA ≤ 20 IU/mL (or 29 IU/mL) between Cohort 2 Group 1 and Cohort 1 as 
well as compared to adult participants can largely be attributed to baseline characteristics (relatively 
higher proportion of participants with high baseline viral load and higher prevalence of HBV genotype 
D). The differences in absolute changes in ALT levels between paediatric and adult participants can 
similarly be attributed to the higher baseline ALT levels in adults. Also, considering that the additional 
data provided for the PopPK model indicate comparable exposure of TFV (AUCtau/Ctau) between CHB-
infected adults and children aged 6-12 years and weighing ≥ 25 kg (see Q1 above) and that, hence, an 
extrapolation of the adult CHB efficacy data to the paediatric patients aged 6 to <12 years is possible, 
it is overall concluded that the efficacy data from study GS-US-320-1092 are regarded as sufficient to 
support this extension of indication. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The MAH submitted week 24 safety data from Study GS-US-320-1092 in support of this application of 
extension of indication which included data from Cohort 1 (adolescents aged 12 years and older with 
body weight at least 35kg, already approved) and Cohort 2 Group 1 (paediatric patients between 6 and 
12 years of age and weighing at least 25 kg, applied for in this application of extension of indication). 
Safety data from the target population is limited to 12 patients who received TAF during Study GS-US-
320-1092.  
Overall, the rate of AEs in Study GS-US-320-1092 was slightly higher in the TAF group (59.3%) 
compared to the placebo group (55.2%). The rate of AEs was slightly lower in the target population 
Cohort 2 Group 1 (50%) compared to Cohort 1 (61.7%). Furthermore, the rate of patients 
experiencing grade 2, 3 or 4 AEs was higher in Cohort 1 (14.9% vs. 8.3%).  
When comparing frequently reported AEs in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1 (reported in more than one 
patient), abdominal pain (Cohort 1: 8.5% [n=4] vs. Cohort 2 Group 1: 25% [n=3]) and nausea 
(Cohort 1: 4.3% [n=2] vs. Cohort 2 Group 1: 16.7% [n=2]) were more frequently registered in the 
target group of Cohort 2 which are already labelled adverse reactions. In general, the reported AEs in 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155784/2023  
Page 75/83 
 
 
 
the TAF groups are in line with the AEs reported during the adults Studies GS-US-320-0108 and GS-
US-320-0110 (week 48 and data beyond). 
Overall, for more patients in the TAF group (16.9%, n=10) AEs were considered as related to study 
drug compared to the placebo group (10.3%, n=3). No differences in reporting of related AEs was 
observed between Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1. 
SAEs were reported in three patients. One patient in the TAF group (Cohort 1) experienced an SAE of 
Grade 2 scarlet fever considered not related to study drug. The other two SAEs were observed in the 
placebo group (ankle fracture, Grade 3 ALT increased). No SAEs were observed in the target paediatric 
population.  
No deaths occurred during the double-blind phase of Study GS-US-320-1092. 
No patient prematurely discontinued the double-blind phase of the study due to an AE. 
As requested, the MAH provided week 48 interim safety data from Study GS-US-320-1092, which 
included data from patients who received TAF over 48 weeks in the double-blind (DB) and OL phases 
for participants in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1, and patients in the PBO group who crossed-over to 
TAF (PBO-TAF) at Week 24 and entered the OL phase. Furthermore, a comparison of these data to 
week 48 data from adult studies (GS-US-320-0108 and GS-US-320-0110) was presented. 
Overall, the rate of AEs in Cohort 2 Group 1 in Study GS-US-320-1092 until week 48 was slightly lower 
compared to the rate in Cohort 1 (66.7% [n=8] vs. 74.5% [n=47]). When comparing to adult week 48 
data the rate of AEs was comparable (70.2%, n=608). A slightly higher rate of patients in Cohort 2 
Group 1 developed grade 2, 3 or 4 AEs until week 48 compared to Cohort 1 of Study GS-US-320-1092 
and adult data (33.3% [n=4] vs. 25.5% [n=12] vs. 25.5% [n=221]). However, due to the very limited 
number of patients in Cohort 2 Group 1 no conclusion can be drawn based on this minor difference. 
The overall incidence of AEs at Week 48 for participants who switched from PBO to TAF at Week 24 
(PBO-TAF) group was 55.2% (16/29 patients), which was the same as PBO participants at Week 24. 
The most common AEs in the overall TAF group in Study GS-US-320-1092 at 48 weeks were headache 
(18.6% [11/59 patients]), nasopharyngitis (15.3% [9/59 patients]), upper respiratory tract infection, 
pyrexia, and abdominal pain upper (11.9% [7/59 patients]) each, and vitamin D decreased, cough, 
nausea, and diarrhoea (10.2% [6/59 patients]) each. 
Similar AEs were reported most commonly in adults, however, in a lower rate compared to Study GS-
US-320-1092: nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection (9.9% [86/866 patients]) each, 
headache (9.5% [82/866 patients]), cough (6.4% [55/866 patients]), and nausea (5% [43/866 
patients]).  
Nevertheless, the reported AEs between Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1 in Study GS-US-320-1092 
were comparable and considering the limited number of paediatric patients treated, it can be 
concluded that these data are in general in accordance with the reported AEs in adults. 
Most common AEs in paediatric patients treated with TAF for 24 weeks after 24 weeks on PBO were 
nasopharyngitis (13.8% [4/29 patients]), and vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis and epistaxis (6.9% 
[2/29 patients]) each. 
The rate of related AEs was higher in Study GS-US-320-1092 (Cohort 1: 31.9% [n=15], Cohort 2 
Group 1: 25.0% [n=3]) than reported in adult studies (14.2% [n=123]). However, most commonly 
reported drug-related AEs in paediatric patients were known labelled ADRs for TAF (which may have 
led to the reporting as adverse reaction), such as headache (10.2% [6/59 patients]), nausea and 
abdominal pain upper (5.1% [3/59 patients] each), abdominal pain (3.4% [2/59 patients]) and fatigue 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155784/2023  
Page 76/83 
 
 
 
(3.4% [2/59 patients]). The incidence of drug-related AEs was slightly lower for the patients in Cohort 
2 Group 1 (25.0% [3/12 patients]) versus Cohort 1 (31.9% [15/47 patients]) for which Vemlidy is 
already approved. Furthermore, in Cohort 2 Group 1 only single cases of related AEs were reported. 
In the OL phase, 17.0% (15/88 patients) experienced drug-related AEs (18.6% [11/59 patients] in the 
TAF group and 13.8% [4/29 patients] in the PBO-TAF group). None of the drug-related AEs occurred in 
> 1 patient in the PBO-TAF group after switching from placebo to TAF. 
No SAEs occurred in Cohort 2 Group 1 through Week 48 who received TAF. However, it should be 
considered that only 12 paediatric patients were investigated in Cohort 2 Group 1, which limits the 
significance of the safety data.  Information about reductions in bone mineral density (BMD ≥ 4%) of 
the lumbar spine and of whole body have been included in sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC which 
is agreed.   
Overall, Vemlidy was well tolerated during paediatric Study GS-US-320-1092 until week 48 and no new 
safety signal was identified. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Safety data of the target population (paediatric patients between 6 and 12 years of age and weighing 
at least 25 kg) are limited to 12 patients who received TAF over 24 weeks during Study GS-US-320-
1092 (Cohort 2 Group 1). This is in general acceptable since the popPK modelling indicate that 
exposure (AUCtau and Cmax) is comparable between paediatric patients aged 6 to 12 years and weighing 
≥ 25 kg and adults with CHB infection and an extrapolation of the adult safety data to the paediatric 
population is possible.  
The MAH further committed that long-term data from open-label phase will be provided as soon as 
possible.   
When comparing PK data in patients with CHB between adults, adolescents and the target population 
paediatric patients between 6 and 12 years of age and weighing at least 25 kg measured during Study 
GS-US-320-1092 (limited data), in children between 6-12 years, Cmax and AUCtau of TAF are 
significantly higher compared to adults, in case of TFV the exposure is lower in children while Cmax is 
comparable with adult data (see section PK). Safety parameter Cmax of TAF was twice as high in Cohort 
2 Group 1 (387.7 ng/mL) compared to adolescents (187.8 ng/mL) and adults (177.6 ng/mL). 
However, TAF is metabolised rapidly (t1/2 0.5h) and metabolite TFV is considered as mainly responsible 
for efficacy and safety. Cmax of TFV was comparable between patients of different ages (Cohort 1: 15.3 
ng/mL, Cohort 2 Group 1: 17.4 ng/mL, adults: 17.2 ng/mL).  
Bone Safety 
To analyse the impact of TAF on bone mineralization in children and adolescents aged 6-<18 years old, 
the MAH provided information about bone mineral density, fracture events, bone events and bone 
biochemical markers evaluated during blinded 24 weeks treatment of TAF vs. placebo of Study GS-US-
320-1092. Data from the target paediatric population (paediatric patients between 6 and 12 years of 
age and weighing at least 25 kg) is limited to 12 patients who received TAF in Cohort 2 Group 1.  
Furthermore, the MAH provided information from Study GS-US-320-1092 week 48 data about bone 
mineral density, fracture events, bone events and bone biochemical markers. 
Overall, 3 patients in the TAF group (1 in Cohort 1 and 2 in Cohort 2 Group 1) and 2 patients in the 
PBO-TAF (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1, one each) group had ≥ 4% BMD decreases from baseline in 
spine and whole body BMD at Week 48 and 3 additional patients (1 from Cohort 1 and 2 from Cohort 2 
Group 1) had a ≥ 4% decrease in BMD at spine or whole body after Week 48, while a ≥ 4% decrease 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155784/2023  
Page 77/83 
 
 
 
was transient for 3 out of these 8 patients and all 8 patients had normal Z-scores for their age at Week 
48 and subsequently recorded study visits. For both treatment groups, observed mean spine and 
whole body BMD Z-score values were within the normal range from baseline through Week 48. 
Fracture events were reported in 2 patients during the OL phase (patella fracture [Cohort 1 TAF group] 
and tibia fracture [Cohort 2 Group 1 PBO-TAF group]). Both fracture events were trauma-related, 
considered by the investigator to be unrelated to study drug. 
Overall, the MAH included specific information about changes in bone mineral density in Study GS-US-
320-1092 into Section 5.1 of the SmPC. Specifically, a table was included with information about bone 
mineral density decreases of 4% or greater for paediatric patients at weeks 24 and 48, which is 
agreed. Furthermore, the MAH adapted the warning on BMD in section 4.4 and the information in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC in this regard to the agreed wording in the EU SmPCs of Genvoya and 
Biktarvy. The warning on BMD in section 4.4 of the SmPC was also implemented accordingly, in section 
2 of the PL.

3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The data from study GS-US-320-1092 presented here are from the interim, primary endpoint analysis 
for safety, efficacy, and PK at Week 24. Moreover, in response to the RSI, the MAH also provided 48-
week efficacy data for the participants from the TAF groups who received TAF for an additional 24 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

weeks during the open label phase and a comparison with data of HBeAg-positive adults treated with 
TAF 25 mg once daily in the Phase 3 Study GS-US-320-0110. 
The provided data indicate that the popPK model reasonably well captured the observed TFV 
concentrations in paediatric HBV patients. The boxplots comparing exposure metrics (AUC, Cmax and 
Ctau) of younger patients to the 90% prediction interval of adult exposure showed that median AUC of 
the younger patients was below the median of adult values but the 25% to 75% interval was still 
comprised in the adult 90% prediction interval. Therefore, AUC values can be considered comparable 
between adults and younger patients with HBV. Cmax values in younger patients were also similar to 
adult Cmax. Hence, extrapolation of efficacy and safety data from adults to children 6 to < 12 years of 
age and weighing at least 25 kg is generally considered acceptable.  
However, Ctau was clearly lower in younger HBV patients compared to adults with HBV, even the upper 
whisker boundary was below the 5th percentile of the adult 90% prediction interval. Since the applied 
dose for HBV patients aged 6 to 12 years is the same as for adults, a higher TAF dose for treatment of 
younger patients is not considered reasonable for safety reasons. The MAH submitted an updated 
analysis of the exposure in paediatric patients compared to adults. Particularly for Ctau, a considerable 
proportion of paediatric patients had lower exposures as compared to adults. The underlying reason of 
this finding remains unclear, in particular as flat dosing of 25 mg QD was used for paediatric and adult 
participants, which raises the question if the presented data on TAF and TFV exposure in paediatric 
CHB patients are correct. The MAH argued that the efficacy response rate was not dependent upon the 
Ctau concentration. However, safety concerns regarding the question where the remaining drug might 
be distributed and how it is metabolised were not addressed.  
The primary efficacy endpoint of study GS-US-320-1092 was met (percentage of all 88 participants in 
the FAS with plasma HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL at Week 24 in TAF group vs. placebo group). However, the 
primary analysis population mainly consisted of adolescents aged 12 years and older with body weight 
at least 35 kg, for who Vemlidy is already approved, but only few children aged 6 to 12 years and 
weighing ≥ 25 kg were investigated, who are the population of interest for this application regarding 
extension of indication to paediatric patients 6 years of age and older weighing at least 25 kg. 
Treatment with TAF resulted in rapid, progressive and substantial mean declines in HBV DNA levels 
over time. A similar mean decrease in HBV DNA levels was observed for participants in Cohort 1 and 
Cohort 2 Group 1 and adult participants from study GS-US-320-0110. Thus, while achievement of 
virologic suppression below HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL was more common in Cohort 1 than in Cohort 2 
Group 1 (21.3% for Cohort 1 and 8.3% for Cohort 2 Group 1 at Week 24 and 40.4% for Cohort 1 and 
25% for Cohort 2 Group 1 at Week 48), virologic suppression with respect to reduction in HBV DNA 
levels over time was similar. Moreover, a similar rate of ALT normalisation over time was observed for 
participants in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1 (for both Central Lab and AASLD criteria; although ALT 
normalisation following AASLD criteria was lower in Cohort 2 Group 1 than in Cohort 1 at early time 
points, it was similar at Week 24 and Week 48) and adult participants from study GS-US-320-0110. 
These supportive data suggest largely comparable efficacy of TAF treatment in paediatric participants 6 
to < 12 years of age weighing at least 25 kg, adolescents 12 to < 18 years of age weighing at least 35 
kg and adults. 
However, suppression rates at Week 24 in this study (18.6% for all participants, 21.3% for Cohort 1 
and 8.3% for Cohort 2 Group 1) were generally lower than those observed at Week 24 in HBeAg-
positive adults treated with TAF 25 mg once daily in the Phase 3 Study GS-US-320-0110 (34.6% 
[201/581] participants had HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL). Importantly, of the 12 children aged 6 to 12 years 
and weighing ≥ 25 kg receiving TAF, only 1 participant (8.3%) reached the primary endpoint. Thus, 
the 24-week data are not sufficient to conclude on efficacy of TAF treatment in this population. In 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

response to the RSI, the MAH provided the requested 48-week efficacy data and a comparison with 
adult data: 
The primary endpoint of HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL was reached by 10/47 (21.3%) participants from 
Cohort 1 at Week 24 and 19/47 (40.4%) at Week 48. Of the participants from Cohort 2 Group 1, 1/12 
(8.3%) had reached the primary endpoint at Week 24 whereas 3/12 (25%) did so at Week 48. Thus, 
although more participants from Cohort 2 Group 1 reached the primary endpoint at Week 48 than at 
Week 24, the proportion was still lower than in Cohort 1. Furthermore, a lower proportion of 
participants from Cohort 1 (44.7%) and Cohort 2 Group 1 (41.7%) than adult participants (63.9%) 
reached the endpoint of HBV DNA ≤ 29 IU/ml. Importantly, however, mean declines in HBV DNA from 
baseline were similar also at Week 48 for all cohorts with mean (SD) log10 IU/mL of -5.65 (1.78) for 
Cohort 1, -5.88 (0.86) for Cohort 2 Group 1 and -5.75 (1.31) for adults. Thus, although there were 
considerable differences in the proportions of participants reaching HBV DNA ≤ 20 IU/mL (or 29 
IU/mL), mean declines in HBV DNA from baseline were similar. This indicates similar efficacy of TAF 
treatment in this respect.  
The proportion of participants with abnormal ALT at baseline that had achieved normalised ALT was 
similar or larger for participants of Cohort 1 and Cohorts 2 Group 1 than for adult participants at both 
Week 24 and Week 48. Of note, the progressive increase in ALT normalisation over the 48-week 
treatment period suggests that the proportion of participants with normalised ALT may even further 
increase over time with long-term treatment. The impact of TAF treatment on serological endpoints 
(HBeAg loss/seroconversion and HBsAg loss/seroconversion) was not different to placebo at Week 24. 
At Week 48, similar proportions of participants from Cohort 1 (7/46 (15.2%)) and Cohort 2 Group 1 
(3/12 (25.0%)) and adult participants (13.8%) showed HBeAg loss. Furthermore, similar proportions 
of participants from Cohort 1 (6/46 participants (13.0%), Cohort 2 Group 1 (2/12 participants 
(16.7%)) and adult participants (10.3%) achieved HBeAg seroconversion. There was only minimal 
fibrosis response after 48 weeks of treatment. Longer term treatment is needed to more fully assess 
the impact of TAF on these parameters. The MAH committed to provide long-term data from the open 
label phase as soon as possible.  
Overall, viral suppression, ALT normalisation and change from baseline as well as HBeAg loss and 
seroconversion (further) improved from Week 24 to Week 48 and to a largely similar degree in Cohort 
1 and Cohort 2 Group 1 and as compared to adult participants. Also, considering that the additional 
data provided for the PopPK model indicate comparable exposure of TFV (AUCtau/Ctau) between CHB-
infected adults and children aged 6-12 years and weighing ≥ 25 kg (see Q1 above) and that, hence, an 
extrapolation of the adult CHB efficacy data to the paediatric patients aged 6 to <12 years is possible, 
it is overall concluded that the efficacy data from study GS-US-320-1092 are regarded as sufficient to 
support this extension of indication. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
TAF is currently approved for use in adult and adolescent patients with CHB weighing at least 35 kg in 
the EU and other regions. Therefore, for this application to extend the indication to CHB-infected 
children from 6 years and older and weighing at least 25 kg, in particular the data from Cohort 2 
Group 1 of study GS-US-320-1092 are relevant. The data presented here are from the interim, 
primary endpoint analysis for safety, efficacy, and PK at Week 24.  
The provided data indicate that the popPK model reasonably well captured the observed TFV 
concentrations in paediatric HBV patients. AUC and Cmax values in younger patients were comparable 
to those in adults. Hence, extrapolation of efficacy and safety data from adults to children 6 to < 12 
years of age and weighing at least 25 kg is generally considered acceptable. However, Ctau was clearly

lower in younger HBV patients compared to adults with HBV. The underlying reason for this finding 
remains unclear, in particular as flat dosing of 25 mg QD was used for paediatric and adult 
participants. The MAH argued that the efficacy response rate was not dependent upon the Ctau 
concentration. However, safety concerns regarding the question where the remaining drug might be 
distributed and how it is metabolised were not addressed.  
The primary efficacy endpoint of study GS-US-320-1092 was met (percentage of all 88 participants in 
the FAS with plasma HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL at Week 24 in TAF group vs. placebo group). However, the 
primary analysis population mainly consisted of adolescents aged 12 years and older with body weight 
at least 35 kg, for which Vemlidy is already approved, but only few children aged 6 to 12 years and 
weighing ≥ 25 kg, who are the population of interest for this application regarding extension of 
indication to paediatric patients 6 years of age and older weighing at least 25 kg. 
A similar mean decrease in HBV DNA levels was observed for participants in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 
Group 1 and as compared to adult participants from study GS-US-320-0110. Moreover, a similar rate 
of ALT normalisation over time was observed for participants in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1 and as 
compared to adult participants from study GS-US-320-0110. These supportive data suggest largely 
similar efficacy of TAF treatment in paediatric participants 6 to < 12 years of age weighing at least 25 
kg, adolescents 12 to < 18 years of age weighing at least 35 kg and adults. 
However, suppression rates at Week 24 in this study (18.6% for all participants, 21.3% for Cohort 1 
and 8.3% for Cohort 2 Group 1) were generally lower than those observed at Week 24 in HBeAg-
positive adults in the Phase 3 Study GS-US-320-0110 (34.6% [201/581] participants had HBV DNA < 
29 IU/mL). Importantly, of the 12 children aged 6 to 12 years and weighing ≥ 25 kg receiving TAF, 
only 1 participant (8.3%) reached the primary endpoint. Thus, the 24-week data are not sufficient to 
conclude on efficacy of TAF treatment in this population. In response to the RSI, the MAH provided the 
requested 48-week efficacy data and a comparison with adult data: 
Although more participants from Cohort 2 Group 1 reached the primary endpoint of HBV DNA < 20 
IU/mL at Week 48 (3/12 (25%)) than at Week 24, the proportion was still lower than in Cohort 1 
(19/47  (40.4%)). Furthermore, a lower proportion of participants from Cohort 1 (44.7%) and Cohort 
2 Group 1 (41.7%) than adult participants (63.9%) reached the endpoint of HBV DNA ≤ 29 IU/ml. 
Importantly, however, mean declines in HBV DNA from baseline were similar also at Week 48 for all 
cohorts with mean (SD) log10 IU/mL of -5.65 (1.78) for Cohort 1, -5.88 (0.86) for Cohort 2 Group 1 
and -5.75 (1.31) for adults. Thus, although there were considerable differences in the proportions of 
participants reaching HBV DNA ≤ 20 IU/mL (or 29 IU/mL), mean declines in HBV DNA from baseline 
were similar. This indicates similar efficacy of TAF treatment in this respect.  
Overall, viral suppression, ALT normalisation and change from baseline as well as HBeAg loss and 
seroconversion (further) improved from Week 24 to Week 48 and to a largely similar degree in Cohort 
1 and Cohort 2 Group 1 and as compared to adult participants. Also, considering that the additional 
data provided for the PopPK model indicate comparable exposure of TFV (AUCtau/Ctau) between CHB-
infected adults and children aged 6-12 years and weighing ≥ 25 kg (see Q1 above) and that, hence, an 
extrapolation of the adult CHB efficacy data to the paediatric patients aged 6 to <12 years is possible, 
it is overall concluded that the efficacy data from study GS-US-320-1092 are regarded as sufficient to 
support this extension of indication. 
Hence, extension of indication from adult and adolescent patients with CHB weighing at least 35 kg to 
CHB-infected children from 6 years and older and weighing at least 25 kg is approved by the 
Committee.

Extension of indication to include treatment of chronic hepatitis B-infected children from 6 years and 
older and weighing at least 25 kilograms for Vemlidy, based on the interim results from Week 24 
clinical study report (CSR) for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Group 1 and supporting modular summaries for 
the category 3 study GS-US-320-1092, ‘A Randomized, Double-Blind Evaluation of the 
Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Antiviral Efficacy of Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF) in Children and 
Adolescent Subjects with Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection’. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 
4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.  
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the wording in section 4.6 of the SmPC related to 
breastfeeding and pregnancies exposed to TAF, and to update the list of local representatives in the 
Package Leaflet.  
An updated RMP version 9.1 has been provided. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended.

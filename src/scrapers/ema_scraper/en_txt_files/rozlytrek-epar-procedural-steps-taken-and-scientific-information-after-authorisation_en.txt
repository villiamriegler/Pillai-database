The CHMP, having reviewed the available information on 
the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations and 
having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, is of the 
opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this 
medicinal product continue to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore recommends the 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Update of sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order

SmPC, Annex 
The pharmacokinetics of entrectinib were studied in 
to update the pharmacokinetic information based on 
II and PL 
subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B) 
final results from study GP411174 listed as an 
additional pharmacovigilance activity in the RMP; this 
is a Phase I, non-randomized, single-dose, open-
label study to investigate the effect of impaired 
hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics of 
entrectinib in volunteers with different levels of 
hepatic function. The RMP version 4.1 has also been 
agreed. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
in Annex II section C and to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, relative to 
subjects with normal hepatic function. Following 
administration of a single oral dose of 100 mg entrectinib, 
the combined AUClast of entrectinib and M5 showed no 
relevant change in the hepatic impaired groups compared 
to the normal function group. The AUClast geometric mean 
ratio (90% CI) was 1.30 (0.889, 1.89) for the mild, 1.24 
(0.886, 1.73) for the moderate, and 1.39 (0.988, 1.95) for 
the severe hepatic impaired groups compared to the 
normal hepatic function group. For the unbound entrectinib 
and M5, the AUClast (fu) geometric mean ratio (90% CI) 
was 1.91 (1.21, 3.02) for the mild, 1.57 (1.06, 2.31) for 
the moderate, and 2.34 (1.57, 3.48) for the severe hepatic 
impaired groups compared to the normal hepatic function 
group. Although the effect of hepatic impairment on 
unbound PK parameters generally followed a similar 
direction as total PK parameters, due to the high non-
specific binding in buffer and high variability, results should 
Page 2/7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be interpreted with caution.  
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild, 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Patients with 
severe hepatic impairment should be carefully monitored 
for hepatic function and adverse reactions.

Product Characteristics.

Congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported in less 
cardiac risks, listed as a category 3 study in the RMP, 
in order to fulfil MEA/003. This is an integrated 
safety analysis report to assess cardiac risks based 
on GO40782 [STARTRK-2], CO40778 [STARTRK-NG], 
and BO41932 [TAPISTRY] studies (PAESs). Section 
4.4 of the SmPC has been updated to better reflect 
the cardiac safety findings. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
than 5% of patients across clinical trials with Rozlytrek. 
These reactions were observed in patients with or without a 
history of cardiac disease and resolved in 70% of those 
patients upon institution of appropriate clinical 
management and/or Rozlytrek dose reduction/interruption.

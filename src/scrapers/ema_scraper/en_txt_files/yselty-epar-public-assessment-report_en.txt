Notice on text identified as “*Additional information”: 
The CHMP had initially adopted an opinion on 16 December 2021 but during the decision-making 
process further information was brought to the attention of the CHMP. The US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) informed EMA of potential different versions of the Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) 
for the pivotal studies, apparent discrepancies in treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and  
some miscoding of reasons for treatment discontinuation/trial withdrawal. In view of the potential 
seriousness of these concerns, in particular in relation to safety, on 28 January 2022 the European 
Commission returned the pending Opinion to the CHMP in order to allow the Committee to assess the 
possible impact of the findings on the marketing authorisation application.  
Upon request the applicant provided clarity on various pivotal study CSR updates that occurred, and 
tracked versions and explanations for all of the updates to the CSRs (v1.0 to v2.0) were submitted. 
The applicant also provided more detailed data and re-analysis relating to the subjects that 
discontinued treatment. EMA also performed a GCP inspection of the sponsor in February 2022, 
GCP/2022/003.  
Arising from the assessment of these additional data there have been some updates or additional 
detail added to some sections of this report, specifically those sections relating subject 
disposition/discontinuation, adverse events, and GCP; these updates are highlighted in this EPAR as 
“*Additional information”.  
The benefit risk assessment of Yselty remained positive, and no product information updates were 
required following assessment of this additional information.

2.  Scientific discussion 
 Problem statement 
 Disease or condition 
Uterine fibroids are benign, monoclonal, hormone-sensitive, smooth muscle tumours of the uterus that 
occur during women’s reproductive years (Borahay, 2017). The primary symptoms are chronic heavy 
menstrual bleeding (which may be described as “gushing”-type bleeding [Wegienka, 2003]), 
abdominal and pelvic pressure, pelvic pain, bowel and bladder dysfunction including urinary frequency 
and incontinence, and abdominal protrusion. Fibroids are also associated with infertility, recurrent 
miscarriage, and for women with fibroids who attain pregnancy, impaired pregnancy outcomes 
including preterm delivery, breech presentation and low birthweight infants are increased (Shavell, 
2012; Lam, 2014; Parazzini, 2015). Anaemia is a common consequence of fibroid-related heavy 
bleeding, and for women with severe fibroids, can be life-threatening (Donnez, 2016; Stewart, 2015). 
Once women enter menopause, fibroids typically shrink and become inactive. However, it is not 
uncommon for women to experience worsening of symptoms and fibroid growth during the 
perimenopausal years as hormone levels fluctuate.  
Women with fibroids experience worse health-related quality of life than women without fibroids 
(Spies, 2005). In addition to causing substantial chronic and persistent physical morbidity, uterine 
fibroids are a frequent cause of significant long-term impairment of a wide range of aspects of quality 
of life (QoL), including self-image, interpersonal relationships and sexual function (Marsh, 2018; Borah, 
2013). The major risk factors for uterine fibroids are increasing age and black race. Black women have 
approximately a 2-3-fold increased risk compared to White women (Stewart, 2017). The prevalence of 
fibroids increases with until menopause (Drayer, 2015); for example, women in the UK aged over 40 
years were four-times more likely to have uterine fibroids than women under the age of 40 (Stewart, 
2017). Other risk factors include early menarche, delay of pregnancy, and time since last delivery 
(Donnez, 2016; Stewart, 2015). An association has been reported between alcohol and caffeine intake 
(Wise, 2016). Increased parity decreases the incidence of fibroids (Wise, 2016).  
Fibroids are highly sensitive to circulating oestradiol and progesterone, which are considered to be the 
major promoters of fibroid growth (Maruo, 2004). 
 Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Uterine fibroids are the most common tumour of the female reproductive tract in premenopausal 
women, affecting approximately 40% of women between 35 and 55 years (Parker, 2007). For many 
women with uterine fibroids, symptoms begin in the twenties and progress over time with increases in 
fibroid number and size and associated increases in heavy bleeding, and by age 35, about 40% of 
Caucasian women and 60% of Black women will have uterine fibroids (Baird, 2003). By the time they 
reach 50 years of age, nearly 70% of White women and more than 80% of Black women will have had 
at least one fibroid. Consistent with these estimates, an ultrasound study of women in Finland with a 
mean age of 43 years demonstrated a prevalence of 66% (Luoto, 2000).  
 Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
About 30-40% of women with fibroids are symptomatic, although there is evidence that symptomatic 
fibroids are underdiagnosed, including in European women (Luoto, 2000; Marsh, 2018). While many of 
these women will have mild symptoms, severe symptoms requiring treatment develop in 15 to 30% of 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 9/155 
 
  
 
 
 
women affected with fibroids, and for these women the condition has serious consequences (Bulun, 
2013).  
Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is one of the most disabling symptoms of uterine fibroids, and has 
been associated with physical, social and financial implications (including lower employment rates, 
more frequent absence from work, and loss of earnings). In a survey of European women with 
confirmed uterine fibroids and undiagnosed bleeding, more than 33% of women with a confirmed 
diagnosis reported absenteeism from work, and 27-38% reported lost productivity at work (Downes, 
2010). In the US, the total associated costs (including annual care, direct health care and indirect work 
loss costs) are estimated to be 2.6 times higher for women with uterine fibroids than for controls 
(Cote, 2002). Overall US fibroid-related costs have been estimated at up to $34 billion (Cardozo, 
2012). 
 Management 
Current Treatment  
The principal objective in treating uterine fibroids is symptom relief, including reduction in HMB and the 
numerous associated symptoms reported by women with the condition. Because of the lack of 
available effective medical therapies that can be used long-term, current treatment options for women 
with HMB due to uterine fibroids are mainly surgical (Al-Hendy, 2017). For women who wish to 
preserve fertility, there are a number of procedures that can be considered. Mainstays of conservative 
surgical treatment are hysteroscopic or abdominal (laparoscopic or open) myomectomy, uterine artery 
embolization, and ultrasonic ablation.  
Unfortunately, recurrence of symptoms following conservative surgical treatment is common; for 
example, at least 25% of women who have undergone myomectomy require additional treatment 
(Marret, 2012). Because of this, combined with the lack of effective long-term medical therapy, many 
women with fibroids ultimately undergo hysterectomy, which according to European survey 
information, is the most common surgery for uterine fibroids (Donnez 2016; Downes, 2010). Overall, it 
is estimated that hysterectomies account for almost three quarters of all fibroid procedures, with rates 
varying according to geographic region (Stewart, 2015). 
Hysterectomy ends fertility, and while for many women quality of life improves following permanent 
treatment of fibroids, the procedure can result in long-term adverse outcomes (Stewart, 2015), 
including pelvic floor disorders such as urinary incontinence and vaginal prolapse, impaired body 
image, and sexual dysfunction (Dallenbach, 2008; Flory, 2005). Furthermore, surgical procedures, in 
particular myomectomy and hysterectomy, are associated with potential serious complications, 
including high blood loss, pelvic abscess, abdominal ileus or bowel obstruction, and vaginal cuff 
complications (Lonky, 2017). One study showed an up to 28% risk of medical or surgical complications 
(major blood loss, wound complications, febrile episodes) and a 10% risk of transfusion (Gliklich, 
2011).  
Considering the risks of surgery and the high potential for recurrence with fertility-sparing procedures, 
the need for effective alternatives to surgical intervention is very real, especially for women seeking to 
preserve their fertility. 
Current medical therapies for uterine fibroids are generally aimed at suppression of serum oestrogen, 
the major stimulant of fibroid growth, via inactivation of pituitary GnRH receptors. Injectable GnRH 
agonists such as leuprorelin acetate fully suppress oestradiol (E2) levels via desensitisation of the 
pituitary GnRH receptor without the possibility of partial suppression (Lethaby, 2001; Stovall 1995). As 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 10/155 
 
  
 
 
 
a result, leuprorelin is highly effective in the reduction of fibroid-related bleeding, reduces fibroid and 
uterine volume, and corrects anaemia when given concomitantly with iron therapy. Despite its efficacy, 
leuprorelin use has been relatively limited due to its suboptimal side effect profile related to an initial 
flare effect often associated with transient worsening of bleeding and other fibroid-related symptoms, 
followed by hypoestrogenic symptoms such as hot flushes, vaginal dryness, and emotional lability. 
Furthermore, GnRH agonists such as leuprorelin have a negative impact on bone mineralization, with 
an estimated loss of 3% in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) after 3 months of treatment, 
which increases to approximately 6% after 12 months of continuous use (Hornstein, 1998). Due to its 
effects on BMD, the use of leuprorelin is generally limited to up to 6 months for the preoperative 
management of fibroids, although there is no harmonised label in Europe.  
Drugs that modulate progesterone action on the uterus have also been developed for management of 
uterine fibroids. Esmya (5 mg ulipristal acetate), a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM), 
was approved in Europe in 2012 for intermittent treatment of women with fibroid-associated HMB who 
were not eligible for surgery. On September 4, 2020 the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) safety 
committee (The Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC)) recommended revocation of 
its marketing authorisation due to on-treatment cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). After 
assessment by the CHMP, the indication of Esmya for the treatment of uterine fibroids was restricted. 
This further underscores the need for well-tolerated and effective medical treatments for uterine 
fibroids.  
Other medical treatments, including oral contraceptives and progestins, are often used, but there is 
limited evidence for their long-term efficacy in patients with heavy menstrual bleeding due to fibroids 
(Stewart, 2015). The levonorgestrel-releasing IUD effectively decreases menstrual bleeding, but its 
effectiveness may be limited in women with a distorted endometrial cavity due to submucosal fibroids; 
furthermore, its use is contraindicated in women with severe uterine cavity distortion. Rates of IUD 
expulsion are also higher in women with fibroids (Zapata, 2010). 
Development of Oral GnRH receptor antagonists  
In 1992, the Barbieri oestrogen threshold hypothesis was introduced based on multiple observations 
that suggested that endometriosis and uterine fibroids are oestrogen-sensitive, and that E2 
concentrations in the range of 10-20 pg/mL typically result in atrophy of endometriotic lesions and 
fibroids, vasomotor symptoms, and loss of trabecular bone. Barbieri also observed that E2 
concentrations greater than 60 pg/mL were often associated with growth of lesions.  
The hypothesis suggested that oestrogen concentrations in a “therapeutic window,” i.e., an optimal 
range, could partially prevent bone loss while reducing disease symptoms. By using hormonal add- 
back therapy in combination with full suppression GnRH analogue doses, this window could potentially 
be achieved with an optimal benefit/risk ratio, treating symptoms while limiting BMD loss (Barbieri, 
1992). This concept was further supported with a semi-mechanistic model that showed that E2 
concentrations >20 pg/mL are expected to minimize BMD loss while achieving symptom relief when E2 
concentrations are in the ~20-60 pg mL range (Riggs, 2012).  
In the following years, a new class of GnRH analogue, the oral GnRH receptor antagonists, was 
developed. These have the unique ability to dose-dependently reduce serum E2. Based on Barbieri’s 
hypothesis, there are two ways to achieve optimal E2 levels with a GnRH antagonist i.e (i) to 
administer a high dose of GnRH antagonist associated with hormonal add-back therapy or (ii) to 
administer a low dose of GnRH antagonist which partially suppress E2 hence will maintain sufficient 
endogenous E2 to prevent long term adverse impacts of hypoestrogenism. Hormonal add-back therapy 
is used to minimize or prevent the hypoestrogenic side effects of full oestrogen suppression with GnRH 
analogues, and in addition to bone protection, is known to improve QoL and adherence to treatment. 
The use of an exogenous source of oestrogen ensures systemic E2 concentrations remain in a range 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 11/155 
 
  
 
 
that effectively manages fibroid-associated symptoms while minimizing the risk of BMD loss and 
avoiding bothersome vasomotor symptoms. A progesterone such as norethisterone acetate (NETA) is 
added to prevent the potentially negative effects of unopposed oestrogen on the uterine endometrium, 
in particular endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. 
Orally active, non-peptide GnRH receptor antagonists have been developed for the treatment of 
endometriosis and uterine fibroids.  
Another oral GnRH receptor antagonist, relugolix, has been developed with a high dose (40 mg once 
daily) combined with hormonal ABT for management of HMB due to uterine fibroids, (Rocca, 2020). 
Relugolix/E2/NETA was approved in Europe on 16 July 2021. Both of these full suppression regimens 
require and are co-formulated with hormonal ABT (both used E2 1 mg + NETA 0.5 mg) for prevention 
of BMD loss and vasomotor symptoms, which means that women treated with either product will be 
limited to combination therapy with both the GnRH antagonist and ABT. Of note, ABT was approved in 
the EU in 1998 as Activelle, which is indicated as hormone replacement therapy for oestrogen 
deficiency symptoms in postmenopausal women with more than 1 year since last menses, and for 
prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of future fractures who are intolerant 
of or contraindicated for other medicinal products approved for the prevention of osteoporosis.  
ABT alleviates the adverse consequences of prolonged hypoestrogenic state but has its own specific 
safety profile. The European label for ABT (Activelle SmPC) includes obesity, uncontrolled 
hypertension, and dyslipidaemia as contraindications to ABT due to association of these factors with 
higher risks of thrombotic, stroke and cardiac events. Given the rising rates of obesity and associated 
conditions in European women, the availability of a GnRH receptor antagonist for management of 
uterine fibroids that can be used long term at high doses with ABT in addition to low doses with and 
without ABT is therefore important for uterine fibroids patients who have a contraindication and women 
who prefer to avoid hormones. To address the needs of these women, linzagolix has been developed 
with both a full suppression dose with ABT and a partial suppression dose to be used with and without 
ABT.

If the intent is to use 200 mg dose long-term (beyond 6 months), it is recommended that patients take 
concomitant hormonal ABT (Estradiol “E2”1 mg + Norethisterone acetate “NETA” 0.5 mg) from the 
initiation of treatment to prevent bone mineral density loss.  
The 200 mg dose is for short-term (up to 6 months) for shrinkage of uterine fibroids and uterine 
volume. 
The 100 mg dose is recommended for use by women in whom ABT is contra-indicated or not 
recommended and by women who prefer to avoid hormonal therapy. 100 mg also indicated with 
concomitant ABT, see approved SmPC.

 Type of application and aspects on development 
This procedure is subject to a centralised procedure. No request for an accelerated assessment, 
conditional marketing authorisation or approval under exceptional circumstances was made. 
Linzagolix was discovered and initially developed by Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Kissei, Japan) for 
the treatment of endometriosis. In 2015, ObsEva SA acquired the license to develop, register and 
commercialize linzagolix in Europe and the USA.  
Phase 1 and 2 studies have evaluated single (from 12.5 mg to 700 mg) and repeat doses (from 100 
mg to 400 mg once daily for 7 days).  
The Phase 3 program in uterine fibroids comprised two pivotal trials, PRIMROSE 1 and PRIMROSE 2.

The product is available in PVC-PVDC/aluminium blisters as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
 Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of linzagolix choline is 2-hydroxy-N,N,N-trimethylethanaminium 3-{5-[(2,3-
difluoro-6-methoxyphenyl)methoxy]-2-fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl}-2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-
tetrahydrothieno[3,4-d]pyrimidine-5-carboxylate corresponding to the molecular formula 
C22H14F3N2O7S.C5H14NO. It has a relative molecular mass of 508.42 g/mol (free base) or 611.59 g/mol 
(choline salt) and the following structure: 
The chemical structure of linzagolix choline was elucidated by a combination of 1H, 13C, and 19F NMR 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, infrared spectrophotometry, UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and

elemental analysis. The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by 
thermogravimetric analysis, differential thermal analysis, gravimetric vapour sorption and x-ray 
powder diffraction (XRPD). 
The active substance is a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic crystalline powder. It exhibits pH-
dependent solubility, being practically insoluble in acidic aqueous media, slightly soluble in water, and 
soluble in alkaline aqueous media. Due to the low solubility in physiologically relevant media, the 
active substance is milled to increase its dissolution rate. Linzagolix is achiral. 
Different polymorphic forms have been observed during development. However, only one form is 
thermodynamically stable. This form is routinely produced by the proposed commercial manufacturing 
process.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and are considered 
acceptable.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. An extensive discussion on mutagenic impurities was provided, including 
those potentially introduced through raw materials upstream of the starting materials. The presented 
information to control impurities in the active substance is adequate. Overall the defined control 
strategy is satisfactory. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the 
development is considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in double LDPE bags placed within a fibre drum. The primary packaging 
complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The finished product manufacturer’s active substance specification shown in Error! Reference source 
not found. includes tests for description, identity, impurities, residual solvents  water content, 
sulphated ash, choline content, assay, particle size distribution  and microbiological examination. In 
addition, the ASMF holder tests for polymorphic form. 
Limits for impurities are set according to ICH Q3A. Limits for PSD were added as the result of a major 
objection from CHMP, having originally only been included in the ASMF. The analytical methods used 
have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 3 production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. Additional compliant batch data from 
multiple additional active substance batches was provided in the ASMF. 
Stability 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 14/155 
 
  
 
 
Stability data from 5 pilot scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers stored in 
the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) 
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. Samples were tested for description, impurities, water content, choline content, assay, 
PSD, microbiological examination and polymorphic form. No significant changes to any of the 
measured parameters were observed and the data are consistent across manufacturing sites. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch. Linzagolix choline is 
not photosensitive. 
Forced degradation studies were carried out under conditions of heat, high humidity (solid phase) and 
in aqueous acid, alkali and with an oxidant (in solution). The active substance is stable in the solid 
phase and in acid solution but degrades in solution in the presence of an oxidant and to a greater 
extent, in alkali. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 48 months without 
particular storage conditions in the proposed container. 
 Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets for oral administration containing 100 mg or 
200 mg of linzagolix (as choline salt) as the active substance. The 100 mg tablet is a round biconvex 
shape with 10.0 mm diameter and engraved on one face with “100”. The 200 mg tablet is an oblong 
shape of 19.0 mm by 9.0 mm and engraved on one face with “200”. 
The composition is quantitatively proportional between strengths, the formulation being manufactured 
from a common blend. 
The aim of development was an immediate release oral formulation of linzagolix choline as defined in 
the quality target product profile (QTPP). This allowed identification of potential critical quality 
attributes (CQAs) of the finished product which were then investigated during development studies. 
Linzagolix is highly permeable but poorly soluble in the physiological pH range (BCS class 2). 
Accordingly, polymorphic form and particle size are controlled in the active substance. The active 
substance is generally stable and has been shown to be compatible with the selected excipients. 
Functional attributes of the excipients have been adequately described. All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. or other relevant standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included 
in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.4.1 of this report. Lactose is an excipient with a known 
physiological effect and is thus also listed in section 2 of the SmPC. 
The applicant provided information about the evolution of the formulation throughout clinical 
development, including data on bridging between clinical formulations. A biowaiver was proposed to 
bridge to both strengths of the commercial formulation. The CHMP did not initially accept the data and 
requested further justification. The applicant was able to provide further comparison of in vitro 
dissolution profiles across the physiological pH range, such that CHMP accepted the biowaiver. 
The development of the QC dissolution method was described. Discriminatory power was investigated 
with respect to batches manufactured with different process parametersThe CHMP raised a major 
objection because the applicant’s proposed specification was too wide In response, the applicant 
tightened the limits. This was deemed acceptable. 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 15/155 
 
  
 
 
Guided by the QTPP, risk assessments were carried out to evaluate potential critical process steps. 
Based on the outcome of this evaluation, further development studies were conducted on individual 
unit operations to gain knowledge of critical process steps on small scale. Additional studies during 
scale up allowed determination of parameter set-points and ranges, identification of the required in-
process controls and definition of an appropriate commercial scale control strategy. 
The primary packaging is PVC-PVDC/aluminium blisters. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  five  main  steps:  granulation  followed  by  drying  and  milling; 
blending  with  extra-granular  excipients  including  lubrication;  tableting;  film-coating;  packaging.  The 
process  is  considered  to  be  a  standard  manufacturing  process.  Stability  data  justify  bulk  holding  of 
tablets in LDPE bags under warehouse conditions. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been investigated during development and scale-up. It 
has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. An acceptable validation scheme has been submitted 
and the process will be validated on 3 consecutive production scale batches prior to commercialization. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
including appearance, identification, assay, impurities, uniformity of dosage units, water content, 
dissolution, microbiological examination. 
Limits for impurities are set in line with ICH Q3B and were tightened at the request of CHMP. The limit 
for dissolution was tightened significantly during the procedure in line with the biobatch data to ensure 
a discriminatory test. The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product was 
assessed following a risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. 
Based on the risk assessment, it can be concluded that no specific controls for elemental impurities are 
required in the finished product specification. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product was 
submitted considering the suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and 
the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). A risk was identified in the active 
substance but initially-submitted batch data was not generated using a sufficiently sensitive analytical 
method. Furthermore, all components of the finished product had not been considered resulting in a 
major objection. In response, the applicant provided batch data using a more sensitive method, 
demonstrating that NDEA is not formed to any appreciable level. Furthermore, the risk assessment was 
supplemented with additional information. Based on the information provided, it is accepted that there 
is no risk of the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished 
product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
EMA/266814/2022

Batch analysis results are provided for multiple batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. Of these, 
some are pilot or production scale, manufactured from production scale batches of common blend. The 
finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional finished product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from multiple batches of finished product using a bracketing approach covering 100 and 
200 mg strengths, and manufactured with active substance, stored for up to 36 months under long 
term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH), up to 24 months under intermediate conditions (30ºC / 75% RH)  
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and 
were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. The data is considered sufficient, given 
the bracketing approach and on-going stability program. 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, impurities, water content, dissolution and microbiological 
examination. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No significant trends to any of the 
measured parameters were observed, except a significant increase in water content at early time-points. 
All parameters remained within their specification limits. There are no observable differences between 
batches,  irrespective  of  their  scale  of  manufacture,  further  indicating  that  the  bracketing  approach  is 
acceptable. 
In  addition,  a  batch  of  each  strength,  as  well  as  a  batch  of  tablet  powder,  were  exposed  to  light  as 
defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The finished 
product is not photosensitive. 
In further month-long transport stability study, it was demonstrated that the final tablets are not 
significantly affected by variations in temperature between -20 and 50oC. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months without any specific storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
 Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The major objections 
relating to the representativeness of the biobatch and the strength biowaiver have been satisfactorily 
resolved. In relation to issues with the dissolution method and its discriminatory power, the 
specification has been sufficiently tightened and a 3-tier limit for PSD added to the active substance 
specification. The nitrosamines risk assessment and additional batch data using a sufficiently sensitive 
analytical method were provided to demonstrate that there is no risk of nitrosamine contamination 
from the process.

 Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
 Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
 Non-clinical aspects 
 Introduction 
The non-clinical programme which was conducted established the pharmacodynamic properties of 
linzagolix and provided safety pharmacology information (in vitro, rat and monkey) and toxicology 
data from single-dose studies (rat, dog and monkey), repeated-dose studies (up to 3 months in 
mouse, 6 months in rat, 1 month in dog and 9 months in monkey), genotoxic, carcinogenic and 
reproductive toxicity studies. Radiolabelled [14C]-linzagolix was synthesized and pharmacokinetic 
studies conducted in vitro and in mouse, rat and monkey to investigate the absorption, distribution, 
metabolism and excretion of radiolabelled material. Since no metabolite exceeded 10% of the total 
drug related exposure, no stand-alone toxicology metabolite studies were performed. In vitro studies 
were performed to investigate the potential of linzagolix to induce or inhibit cytochrome P450 
enzymes, to interact with solute carrier transporters, and to address potential interactions with calcium 
or iron ions or the plasma protein binding of linzagolix and other plasma protein bound drugs. In 
addition, in vitro and in vivo mechanistic toxicology studies were performed in hepatocytes, bile, mice, 
dogs and monkeys to address specific findings, such as elevated plasma transaminases without 
histological correlates in the liver and modified gall bladder content. Furthermore, mechanistic studies 
were conducted in rats to characterize the effects of linzagolix on dopamine, prolactin and serum 
estradiol and progesterone levels. 
 Pharmacology 
 Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Linzagolix was shown to be a competitive GnRH receptor antagonist exhibiting a high and equipotent 
affinity for human (Ki 27.4 nM) and cynomolgus monkey (Ki 75.2 nM) GnRH receptors, and to a lesser 
extent to the rat GnRH receptors (Ki 274 nM). Therefore, both monkey and rat are considered as 
suitable models for pharmacokinetic and toxicological assessment of linzagolix.  
Linzagolix showed concentration-dependent antagonist action on human GnRH receptors with IC50 
value of 36.7 ± 1.10 nM, which was comparable to active control cetrorelix (19.9 ± 1.39 nM). 
Binding affinity of KP017, a major in vitro linzagolix metabolite, to the human GnRH receptor was 4.4 
times lower than that of linzagolix (Ki 121 nM vs. 27.4 nM, respectively). In vivo, KP017 and all other 
linzagolix metabolites are minor metabolites with plasma exposures below 10% total drug related 
exposure and not required in further non-clinical assessments.  
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 18/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
In vivo, linzagolix supressed LH secretion in a dose-dependent manner in male rats and castrated male 
as well as ovariectomized female monkeys. Similarly, E2 secretion was dose-dependently inhibited in 
pro-oestrus female rats. The most complete assessment of primary pharmacodynamics of linzagolix 
was made in intact female monkeys, in which linzagolix supressed LH and E2 secretion with a 
consequent influence on menstrual cycle patterns. The cyclic hormone surges and menstrual cycles 
were completely suppressed in 1/4, 3/4 and 4/4 animals treated with 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg BID 
linzagolix, respectively. All animals treated with linzagolix showed recovery of the hormone secretion 
and regular menstrual cycles immediately after the administration period. It was demonstrated that 
the extent of the hormone surge suppressions and menstrual cycle arrest were correlated to serum 
linzagolix concentrations, and more than approximately 20 μg/mL of serum linzagolix in Clast was 
needed for complete inhibition of ovarian function. In a rat endometriosis model, linzagolix significantly 
reduced the volume of endometrial implants at 50 mg/kg BID, confirming its mechanism of action 
through significant reduction of circulating sex hormones. 
 Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The potential inhibitory activity of linzagolix was assessed against a battery of human and non-clinical 
receptors, ion Channels and transporters. The angiotensin AT2 receptor demonstrated the highest 
degree of inhibition (29%) at this concentration (which is significantly in excess of free drug 
concentration observed clinically ≈0.6 µM). The adenosine A2A receptor demonstrated 32 % inhibition 
at a concentration of 1 µM. However, as there were no adverse effects noted in the observational 
safety pharmacology study conducted in rat or adverse observations on behavioural or cardiovascular 
parameters noted in the safety pharmacology study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys it is accepted 
that this is unlikely to be clinically relevant. A specific study was performed to examine inhibition 
targets known to be associated with abuse potential which again found no significant inhibition 
associated with linzagolix at concentrations of 10 µM.  
Since the binding affinity below 30% at 10 μM represents about 360 times the Ki value for human 
GnRH receptor, it can be concluded that linzagolix shows no off-target activity.  
 Safety pharmacology programme 
A thorough in vitro evaluation of the potential for linzagolix to affect cardiac function has been 
submitted. Linzagolix did not affect hERG tail currents in a GLP compliant in vitro assay study at 
concentrations of up to 100 µM. The potential for linzagolix to affect cardiac action potentials was 
further characterised in an in vitro GLP-compliant study in isolated guinea pig papillary muscle which 
demonstrated no effect of linzagolix at concentrations up to 100 µM. Non-GLP studies investigating the 
potential for linzagolix inhibition of other cardiac ion channels did not report significant inhibition at 
concentrations up to 100 μM.  
The effects on linzagolix on in vivo cardiovascular and respiratory safety pharmacology parameters 
were assessed in a dedicated GLP-compliant oral administration study in conscious female cynomolgus 
monkeys fitted with a telemetry system. Single oral doses of up to 1000 mg/kg were not associated 
with any changes in cardiovascular or respiratory parameters. No TK data were taken in this study. 
However, TK data from female monkeys administered single oral doses of 1000 mg/kg (also 
formulated with 0.5 % methylcellulose) were acquired in a GLP-compliant single dose toxicity study 
and these data are used for human exposure margin comparisons. This approach is considered 
acceptable.  
Linzagolix did not have any effects on rat behaviour in a GLP compliant study utilising an Irwin test 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 19/155 
 
  
 
 
 
following single oral doses of up to 2000 mg/kg.  
Exposure margin calculations for both linzagolix and primary metabolite KP017 from NOAELs defined in 
safety pharmacology studies to clinical steady state exposures at 200 mg are provided and are 
considered adequate. 
 Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have not been conducted. However, in view of the results of 
the studies conducted and the intended clinical doses of linzagolix, any drug interaction with one of the 
receptors, channels or transporters of this screen is considered unlikely to occur. The lack of 
pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies is therefore considered acceptable. 
 Pharmacokinetics 
Linzagolix absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and drug interactions were investigated in in 
vivo and in vitro studies using linzagolix and Carbon-14 labelled linzagolix, [14C]linzagolix. Non-clinical 
pharmacokinetic studies were performed using mainly female rats, female monkeys considering clinical 
applications. The administration route in in vivo studies was mainly oral administration under fasted 
conditions except when investigating effects of feeding or excretion in milk. 
Methods of analysis 
The methods of analysis used in pivotal studies have been appropriately validated in terms of 
selectivity, accuracy, precision, stability, linearity and limits of quantification. Some minor deviations to 
normal acceptability ranges were noted in some measures but these are unlikely to affect the 
interpretation of results generated via these methods. The methods of analysis are considered 
acceptable. 
Absorption 
Linzagolix is reported as highly permeable and not a p-gp substrate in a standard in vitro permeability 
assay utilising Caco-2 cell monolayers. The applicant has submitted a number of dedicated PK studies 
assessing PK in monkey and rat for single dose IV and oral administration. A study investigating the site 
of GI absorption in rat reported widespread absorption across the GI with the duodenum and jejunum 
identified as the primary sites in this species with slower absorption from the stomach relative to lower 
GI noted.  
In rat, single dose PK were assessed in terms of plasma radioactivity following oral and IV administration 
of  [14C]linzagolix,  linzagolix  and  primary  human  metabolite  KP017.  Radioactivity  and  Cmax  increased 
dose proportionally following oral administration of [14C]linzagolix to rats, absorption was relatively fast 
with  Tmax  reached  within  2-hours.  The  volume  of  distribution  was  300  ml/kg.  Radioactivity  was 
subsequently  eliminated  with  a  T1/2  of  36.3-41.4  hours.  Bioavailability  in  terms  of  radioactivity  was 
reported as higher in females relative to males (93 and 61 % respectively). There was a mild food effect 
evident with a longer Tmax (1.9-fold), lower Cmax (0.7 fold) and higher AUC0-inf (1.4 fold) evident in fed 
female rats. Elimination was biphasic following IV administration. PK of linzagolix were also reported as 
dose proportional and following biphasic distribution when directly measured in a dedicated PK study in 
rat.  
When a single oral dose of linzagolix (1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg) was administered to fasted female rats, 
exposure in terms of Cmax and AUC0-inf increased dose-proportionally though there was a trend towards 
Cmax plateauing at 30 mg/kg. When directly assessing Linzagolix PK in rat, Tmax for the parent was < 1 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 20/155 
 
  
 
 
 
hour. T1/2 ranged 9.8-14 hours. A food effect was again evident with a ratio of 0.5 for Cmax, 2.5 for Tmax 
and  0.7  for  AUC0-inf  reported  in  fed  female  rats  relative  to  fasted.  Slightly  lower  exposure  in  males 
following oral dosing was evident. This is associated with higher KP017 exposures in males relative to 
females. T1/2 for KP017 ranged from 5.8 to 17.3 hours.  
Both total radioactivity as well as linzagolix and KP017 concentration were assessed following oral and 
IV administration of 14C labelled linzagolix to female cynomolgus monkeys. Bioavailability was reported 
as 86%. Absorption was reported as rapid with Tmax reached within 2 hours following oral administration. 
Exposure to KP017 was less than 1% that of the parent. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of linzagolix (5, 20, and 100 μg/mL) ranged from 97.9% to 99.0% in mice, from 
99.3% to 99.6% in rats, from 94.7% to 95.3% in rabbits, from 95.7% to 96.9% in monkeys and from 
99.0% to 99.4% in humans. The plasma protein binding of primary metabolite KP017 was also shown 
to be high across species (96% +). Plasma protein binding for [14C] labelled linzagolix was shown to be 
comparable with a major role of albumin in the human protein fractions. Human red blood cell association 
values of [14C]linzagolix at 5, 20, and 100 μg/mL assessed in vitro were low, ranging from 1.9% to 3.7%. 
Dedicated  in  vivo  distribution  studies  were  carried  out  following  linzagolix  and  [14C]linzagolix  oral 
administration  to  pregnant  and  non-pregnant  female  rats  and  were  supported  by  autoradiography 
studies. 
Distribution studies conducted in female long-Evans pigmented rats reported that linzagolix distributed 
to melanin containing tissues but did not accumulate with eye and skin tissue concentrations determined 
to be dependent on plasma concentration. The ratios of radioactivity concentrations ranged from 0.56 
to 0.59 for the blood, from 0.02 to 0.05 for the eye and from 0.27 to 0.31 for the skin. 
No significant sex related differences in distribution were noted between non-pregnant female and male 
rats.  The  highest  radioactivity  was  observed  in  plasma  following  oral  dosing  of  rats  with  3  mg/kg  of 
[14C]linzagolix. Initially (0.25 hours) following oral dosing highest concentrations were observed in the 
stomach  and  liver.  The  majority  of  radioactivity  was  observed  in  blood  at  all  other  time  points  with 
trachea, skin, ovaries, urinary bladder and lung exhibiting significant radiation at later time points (168 
hours). Studies in pregnant rats demonstrated distribution to the uterus, mammary gland, placenta and 
foetus. The ratios of uterine, placental and mammary gland radiation to plasma were reported as 1.55, 
1.04,  and  0.2  respectively.  Foetal  exposure  was  characterised  by  slower  distribution  and  elimination 
relative  to  maternal  exposures  as  evidenced  by  lower  exposures  relative  to  maternal  tissues  at  early 
time points and higher at later timepoints. At the final timepoint foetal exposures were reported as higher 
than maternal plasma concentration with ratios of up to 3.45-fold maternal plasma reported in foetal 
blood and 2.15 in the whole body.    
Linzagolix was shown to be excreted in the milk with a Cmax, Tmax, T1/2 and AUC0-inf of 0.1, 4.9, 0.9 and 
0.2-fold that of the maternal plasma parameters. Relevant information is included in section 4.6 and 5.3 
of the SmPC. 
Metabolism 
In  in  vitro  studies,  no  human  specific  metabolites were  detected  following  culturing  of  linzagolix  with 
cryopreserved hepatocytes from mice, rats, monkeys and humans. Of note, primary human metabolite 
KP017 was detected following incubation with hepatocytes from all non-clinical species. Incubating with 
human liver microsomes reported that metabolism was primarily CYP mediated with CYP2C9 identified 
as  the  primary  isoenzyme  mediating  formation  of  primary  human  metabolite  KP017  (demethylation 
product)  and  CYP2C8,  2C9,  and  3A4  primarily  responsible  for  the  formation  of  metabolite  KP046 
(demethylation product).

In vivo, studies examining plasma, urine and faeces after a single oral administration to fasted mice, 
rats and (female) cynomolgus monkeys with 3 mg/kg of [14C]linzagolix were conducted. Samples were 
analysed  via  HPLC  with  a  radioactivity  detector.  In  addition,  the  structure  of  each  metabolite  was 
estimated using mass spectrometry. 
In mice, unchanged linzagolix was the primary component of plasma associated radioactivity (≈85-88 % 
at  8  hours),  with  small  amounts  of  KP017  (demethylation  product),  KP046  (demethylation  product), 
KP018  (dealkylation  product),  and  KP050  (glucuronide  of  KP017)  detected.  In  faeces  unchanged 
linzagolix was the primary component of radioactivity for both male and female mice. In contrast, sex 
related  differences  in  urine  metabolite  profiles  were  evident  with  KP017,  an  unknown  metabolite  M2, 
KP018, the primary components of urine radioactivity in males whereas KP018, KP017 and unchanged 
linzagolix were the primary components of urine radioactivity in females. Unchanged linzagolix was the 
primary component in the kidney and liver tissue of mice with KP017 also detected.  
In rats, unchanged linzagolix was observed as the main component of the radioactivity in both male and 
female  rats  (≈53-65  %  at  8  hours),  small  amounts  of  KP018  and  KP048  (sulphate  conjugate  of  the 
demethylation product KP046), KP049 (sulphate conjugate of KP018), KP017, and KP046 also detected. 
In faeces, unchanged linzagolix was observed as the main component of the radioactivity in both male 
and female mice, followed by KP017, M6, and KP018. Again, sex related differences in urine metabolite 
profiles were evident with KP018 and KP049, followed by KP048 were observed as the main component 
of  the  radioactivity  in  male  mice  while  KP018  and  unchanged  linzagolix  were  observed  as  the  main 
component of the radioactivity in female mouse urine. Unchanged linzagolix was the primary component 
in the kidney and liver tissue of mice with KP018 was also detected. 
In  female  Monkey,  unchanged  linzagolix  was  the  major  component  (≈97  %  at  8  hours),  followed  by 
KP018 and KP017. In urine and faeces, unchanged linzagolix was the primary component followed by 
KP018. 
Excretion 
Two dedicated studies examining excretion in rats and monkey following administration of a 3mg/kg oral 
dose of [14C] linzagolix were conducted. In rat, excretion was primarily via faeces (≈ 73% at 168 hours) 
with a smaller proportion via urine (≈ 14-17 % at 168 hours) and no significant sex related difference. 
Data from bile duct cannulated female rats indicates excretion is primarily via bile (≈ 58 % at 48 hours) 
with a smaller proportion in faeces (≈ 10 %) and urine (≈ 4 %). A separate study in which a bile sample 
from female bile-duct cannulated rats administered a 3 mg/kg dose of [14C]linzagolix was administered 
intraduodenally  indicates  that  linzagolix  undergoes  significant  enterohepatic  circulation  (≈  80%).  In 
female cynomolgus monkeys, following oral administration excretion was also primarily via faeces (≈ 73 
% at 168 hours) with a smaller proportion via urine (≈ 27 % at 168 hours). 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
An  extensive  assessment  of  the  potential  for  linzagolix  to  be  the  perpetrator  or  victim  of  drug-drug 
interactions (DDIs) was submitted. 
In  vitro  studies  utilising  human  hepatocytes  indicate  that  linzagolix  may  be  a  CYP3A4  inducer,  but 
induction only occurred at concentrations significantly in excess of free drug concentrations anticipated 
clinically.  In  vitro  studies  examining  the  CYP  inhibitory  activity  of  linzagolix  reported  that  it  had  both 
direct and time-dependent inhibitory activity of CYP2C8 activity (KI = 3.34 μM).  
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 22/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
A number of in vitro studies were conducted to assess the role of linzagolix as a substrate and inhibitor 
of human transporters. Inhibition studies were conducted with appropriate substrates at concentrations 
of linzagolix. Linzagolix is reported as a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OAT3, but not for MDR1, 
OAT1, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K. It appeared to be a substrate for BCRP at high concentrations (300 
µM), but not at lower (still significantly in excess of predicted clinical) concentrations. Linzagolix inhibited 
OATP1B1-,  OATP1B3-,  OAT1-  and  OAT3-mediated  uptake  amount  of  the  typical  substrates  in  a 
concentration-dependent manner. No in vivo investigation of the potential clinical relevance of OATP1B1 
inhibition has been submitted. The applicant has confirmed that the observed IC50 value is < 25-fold 
the calculated hepatic inlet concentration. As such, in line with the EMAs ‘Guideline on the investigation 
of drug interactions’ (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2**), the applicant has committed to conduct a 
clinical study to assess the potential clinical relevance of OATP1B1 inhibition in the post-authorisation 
setting and update the product information. Linzagolix was shown not be an inhibitor of p-gp or BSEP 
(IC50 > 300 and 100 µM respectively). 
The effect of linzagolix on the plasma protein binding of several known highly bound drugs and the effect 
of  potential  perpetrator  drugs  on  linzagolix  protein  binding  were  assessed  in  vitro.  Linzagolix  at 
concentrations  up  to  100  µg/ml  did  not  significantly  affect  the  plasma  protein  binding  of  warfarin  (3 
µg/ml),  diazepam  (15  µg/ml),  digoxin  (0.05  µg/ml),  ibuprofen  (20  µg/ml),  diclofenac  (0.5  µg/ml)  or 
loxoprofen (ratio % unbound to control ≈ 1).  
In vitro data do not suggest that linzagolix will interact with iron sulfate. 
In vitro studies suggest a low risk of chelation and the formation of insoluble with iron or calcium ions 
or precipitates with calcium affecting the absorption of linzagolix. 
 Toxicology 
 Single dose toxicity 
In single dose toxicity studies, linzagolix was administered orally to rats, dogs and monkeys. Rat and 
monkey  studies  were  conducted  to  GLP  and  TK  data  were  acquired  in  all  studies.  Linzagolix  was  well 
tolerated in these studies with no toxicological findings reported in any species following single oral doses 
up to 2000 mg/kg. 
 Repeat dose toxicity 
Twelve oral repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys to investigate 
the sub-acute and chronic toxicity of linzagolix. Three non-GLP compliant studies were dose-range finding 
studies  intended  to  supply  information  about  the  systemic  toxicity  of  linzagolix  and  the  doses  to  be 
selected  for  subsequent  formal  GLP-compliant  toxicity  studies.  Linzagolix  was  administered  orally  via 
oral gavage in 0.5% methylcellulose vehicle in all repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Mouse 
A non-GLP 4-week repeat dose toxicity DRF study was conducted in CB6F1 mice to assess the suitability 
of conducting a carcinogenicity study in CB6F1-Tg-rasH2 mice. Animals in this study were administered 
oral doses of up to 1500 mg/kg. At the top dose in this study, two mortalities were noted in the female 
group  on  day  17  and  10,  while  one  male  in  the  750  mg/kg  group  was  euthanised  on  day  6  due  to 
deteriorating condition. No histopathological findings were associated with the two female mortalities, 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 23/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
the euthanised male exhibited a small spleen which was considered related to the deteriorating condition 
of the animal. Increased liver weights were noted in all animals from 750 mg/kg which was considered 
related to metabolic induction of the test-article. 
In  a  13-week  study,  3  unscheduled  mortalities  were  noted,  two  were  considered  likely  related  to  the 
test-article and associated with liver toxicity findings post-mortem. The reproductive organs were the 
primary  target  in  line  with  the  pharmacology  of  linzagolix  with  dose  dependent  decreases  in 
epididymides,  testes,  prostate  and  ovary  weights  which  were  associated  with  tissue  atrophy.  Dose 
dependent  incidence  of  tissue  atrophy  was  also  noted  in  the  oviducts,  uterus,  cervix,  vagina  and 
mammary  glands.  Liver  (centrilobular  hypertrophy),  kidney  (tubular  basophilia)  and  spleen 
(extramedullary  haematopoiesis)  were  also  identified  as  target  organs.  The  lowest  dose  tested  (40 
mg/kg) was identified as the NOAEL in this study, it should be noted that even at this dose there was a 
high incidence of ovarian atrophy. Although this is in line with the anticipated pharmacological activity 
of linzagolix, this cannot be considered non-adverse and as such this should be considered a LOAEL.  
Rat 
One GLP-compliant 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. This 
was followed by a non-GLP 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study in Wistar rats to compare toxicity endpoints 
and TK and support continued GLP-compliant (pivotal) 13- and 26-week toxicity studies conducted in 
Wistar  rats.  No  treatment  related  mortalities  were  reported  in  any  of  these  studies  (several  animals 
died/were  euthanised  prior  to  study  completion  which  were  considered  related  to  the  administration 
method, this is endorsed). Sex-related effects on weight were noted in rat studies in line with the primary 
pharmacology of linzagolix. 
Reproductive organs were the primary toxicological targets in all rat studies in line with the pharmacology 
of linzagolix. This was characterised in males by dose dependent atrophy in testes, prostate, seminal 
vesicle epididymides which correlated with decreased weight, and in females by dose dependent atrophy 
in the ovaries, uterus and vaginal epithelium. Atrophy to the mammary glands in both sexes was also 
observed.  Effects on the kidneys were also noted which were characterised by basophilia and dilation in 
the renal tubules in both sexes. In some studies (4 and 13-week, not observed in 26-week study), minor 
changes in urinalysis suggest kidney findings may have functional effects, but this is not considered a 
significant  safety  concern  based  on  non-clinical  data.  Increased  thymus  weights  in  males  were  also 
observed in the 4-week study, which was considered secondary to effects on gonads. In the 13-week 
study, a biphasic effect on pituitary gland weights were noted in females in this study with decreased 
pituitary gland weights reported at higher doses in both sexes but increased pituitary gland weights at 
150 and 500 mg/kg. These findings occurred in the absence of histological correlates. The NOAEL in this 
study was set at 150 mg/kg/day in males and 500 mg/kg/day in females. 
In the 26-week study, increases in dilated thyroid follicles were observed in both sexes at high dose, this 
was not associated with a qualitative effect of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) immunohistochemistry 
in the pituitary. Increased pituitary gland weight were also reported at 50 and 200 mg/kg, but not in the 
high dose (1000 mg/kg) group in this study, again this was in the absence of histological correlates. The 
NOAEL was set at 50 mg/kg in males and 200 mg/kg in females in this study. 
Following 10-weeks recovery in the pivotal 26-week study most findings had resolved, with the exception 
of small prostate and seminal vesicles in several males from the high dose (1000 mg/kg) group.  
NOAELs  defined  in  these  studies  again  exclude  effects  on  reproductive  organs  which  are  considered 
related to the primary pharmacological activity of linzagolix and are defined based on effects on body 
weight and thyroid follicles in 26 week study and body weight and effects of kidney and thyroid in the 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 24/155 
 
  
 
 
13-week study. Although it is accepted that effects on reproductive organs are in line with the anticipated 
pharmacology of linzagolix, it is not accepted that these are NOAELs and are considered LOAELs. 
Dog 
A 2-week non-GLP study and a 4-week GLP repeat-dose toxicity study with a 4-week recovery period 
were conducted in beagle dog. The liver, gall bladder and reproductive organs were identified as target 
organs in these studies. Liver findings included increases in liver weight (and size in females) in the high 
dose group which was associated with an increase in serum ALP, glutamate dehydrogenase, triglycerides 
and  cholesterol  (increased  bilirubin  and  ALT  reported  in  the  2-week  study).  These  findings  had  no 
histopathological correlates and were not evident in recovery animals. Dark particles observed in the gall 
bladder in high dose groups, this may be related to precipitation of the test article and this finding was 
further explored in mechanistic studies (see other toxicity studies below). Small testes, epididymides, 
prostate in all treated male groups and thin uterus in all treated female groups was also reported. Again, 
these findings were without histopathological correlates and most were not evident in recovery animals. 
The NOAEL in the 4-week study was set at 100 mg/kg. 
Monkey  
The  toxicity  of  linzagolix  following  oral  administration  of  doses  up  to  1000  mg/kg  was  assessed  in 
cynomolgus monkey in 4, 13 and 39-week studies. No test-article related mortality was reported in any 
of these studies. Incidences of premature mortalities in 2 studies attributed to drug administration errors 
were reported, it is accepted these were not treatment related. Primary target organs identified in all 
studies  were  again  reproductive  organs  in  line  with  the  pharmacology  of  linzagolix.  These  findings 
included testicular atrophy and fibrosis in males and endometrial, cervical and vaginal atrophy in females. 
In the pivotal 39-week study which included a 20-week recovery period, all treatment related adverse 
effects on these organs were resolved. Females exhibited a dose dependent prolongation of menstrual 
cycle  and  cessation  of  menstrual  bleeding  in  high  dose  animals  again  as  could  be  anticipated  via  the 
pharmacology  of  linzagolix.  These  findings  were  observed  to  resolve  within  4-weeks  of  treatment 
cessation. 
Liver  was  also  identified  as  a  target  organ  with  increased  liver  to  body  weight  ratios  observed  study 
which were associated with an increase in serum ALT and glutamate dehydrogenase. There were however 
no histopathological correlates of these findings, and such findings were not evident in recovery animals 
in the 39-week study. 
 Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity has been assessed in line with option 1 of the standard battery of genotoxicity testing 
outlined in ICH S2 (R1). In addition, a test assessing linzagolix induced unscheduled DNA Synthesis in 
Rat Liver has been conducted. All tests were conducted appropriately. Lingzagolix was negative for 
mutagenicity in a standard Ames test in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. At high 
concentrations (≥ 0.5 mg/mg) in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay linzagolix induced 
chromosomal aberrations both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. However, these 
effects were only observed at concentrations in which there was significant inhibition of cell growth (> 
50% relative to control) indicating significant cytotoxicity. In line with ICH S2 (R1), it is accepted that 
positive results in a mammalian cell assays associated with significant growth inhibition are of 
questionable clinical relevance. No findings were reported in an in vivo assessment of the induction of 
bone marrow micronuclei in rats following a single oral dose of up to 2000 mg/kg. The applicant 
conducted an additional study to assess the potential for linzagolix to induce hepatic unscheduled DNA 
synthesis following administration of a single dose of up to 2000 mg/kg to SD rats. Linzagolix was 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 25/155 
 
  
 
 
negative in this assay. It is accepted that the data presented are sufficient to conclude that linzagolix is 
not genotoxic. 
 Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of linzagolix daily oral administration of doses of up to 500 mg/kg was 
assessed in a GLP-compliant full life (104-week) carcinogenicity study conducted in Wistar rats. 
Linzagolix administration was not associated with any change in survival rate. The top dose in this 
study was based on adverse effects seen at higher doses in 13 and 26-week toxicity studies conducted 
in Wistar rats and this is endorsed. TK analysis confirmed adequate exposure to the test article and to 
primary metabolite KP017. Non-neoplastic findings in this study were limited to increased incidence of 
vacuolation of ovarian interstitial cells and dose dependent increase in severity and incidence of 
mammary gland degeneration in females.  
Neoplastic findings which met statistical significance in either pairwise comparisons to control or via a 
trend test were an increased incidence of endometrial and mammary gland adenocarcinomas observed 
in female treated groups. Several hypotheses to explain these observations were discussed, including 
the  potential  effect  of  the  vehicle  in  initiating  or  promoting  a  tumorigenic  effect.  It  was  noted  that 
linzagolix  was  not  genotoxic  in  a  standard  battery  of  tests,  there  was  no  apparent  pharmacological 
mechanism to explain these effects, and no carcinogenic findings were observed in a 26-week study in 
mice. However, the totality of the data presented were not conclusive and the clinical relevance of these 
findings  remains  unknown.  As  such,  the  risks  of  uterine  endometrial  and  mammary  gland 
adenocarcinoma were included in the RMP as a potential risk based on the non-clinical data. The SmPC 
section 5.3 reflects the observed results accordingly. 
A 26-week oral administration carcinogenicity study was conducted in CB6F1-Tg-rasH2 mice. In this 
study groups of 25 male and female mice were administered linzagolix in 0.5 % methylcellulose via 
oral gavage at doses of 15, 50 and 250 (male) or 500 mg/kg/day (female). Doses used in this study 
were based on the 4-week toxicity study conducted in non-Tg rasH2 mice. TK data confirm adequate 
exposures to the test article, with higher exposures in females relative to males at the same dose 
levels and higher exposures at the high (500 vs 250 mg/kg in females and males respectively) dose 
level also. There was no apparent effect of treatment on survival rates at any dose level in either sex. 
While there was an increased incidence of blood vessel tumours identified as the cause of death in the 
male high dose group (2 of 25, vs 1 of 25 in the saline control group), no dose response was evident 
and it is accepted this is likely a chance finding. There were no treatment-related palpable masses or 
gross lesions in either sex. Positive control animals treated with N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) 
exhibited squamous cell tumours in the forestomach and malignant lymphoma supporting the validity 
of the study. Non-carcinogenic toxicological findings primarily related to effects on reproductive organs 
in line with linzagolix pharmacology and previously characterised in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. It 
is accepted that linzagolix was not carcinogenic following 26-weeks administration to CB6F1-Tg rasH2 
mice. 
 Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
The effect of linzagolix administration at daily doses of up to 100 mg/kg on fertility and early 
embryonic development when administered for 4 weeks prior to and up the day of copulation and the 
reversibility of any such effects following a 4-week withdrawal period were assessed in SD rats. Doses 
in the pivotal study were supported by a thorough, DRF study. Treatment with the high dose (100 
mg/kg) was associated with an increase in the duration and decrease in frequency of oestrous cycles. 
During the withdrawal period, the duration of oestrus cycles was not statistically significantly different 
form controls, but decreased frequency and increased incidence of irregular cycles was maintained in 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 26/155 
 
  
 
 
the high dose group. Treatment was not associated with any effects on copulation, but a dose 
dependent decrease in fertility index which was statistically significant relative to controls at the high 
dose was observed. This was associated with ovarian changes characterised by a decrease in the 
number of large sized follicles and potentially indicative of inhibition of ovulation in the high dose 
group. Decreased implantations associated with a decrease in live embryos was observed at the high 
dose. No adverse effects on copulation, fertility or early embryonic development were observed in the 
withdrawal group suggesting recovery following cessation of treatment. 
A second study examined the effect of initiating linzagolix treatment after copulation (Day 0-7). Higher 
doses used in this study (up to 1000 mg/kg) were supported by a dedicated DRF study. Maternal BW 
was decreased in the mid and high dose groups. There were no significant differences in the number of 
corpora lutea, the number of implantations, the implantation index, the number of live embryos and 
the post-implantation loss in treated groups. Smaller conceptuses were observed in 7/20 high dose 
animals indicating embryotoxicity. The NOAEL for female reproductive function and early embryonic 
development was set at 300 mg/kg/day and this is endorsed.  
Males were not treated in these studies and therefore data on the functional effects of linzagolix 
administration on male fertility are not available. Based on target organs in repeat dose toxicity 
studies, effects on male fertility can be expected. Based on the proposed indication of the product, this 
is considered acceptable. 
The effects of linzagolix on embryofoetal development were assessed in pivotal GLP-compliant studies 
in pregnant female SD rats and NZW rabbits. Doses in the pivotal studies were supported by dedicated 
DRF studies in each species. TK data in pregnant animals were acquired in both studies and 
demonstrated adequate exposure to the test article.  
In rat, daily oral administration with linzagolix at doses of 300 mg/kg was not associated with maternal 
toxicity but was associated with total litter loss in 3 of 24 dams and a tendency to increased embryo-
foetal mortality and decreased numbers of live foetuses. Linzagolix was non-teratogenic with no 
treatment related visceral anomalies reported. The NOAEL for embryofoetal development was set at 
100 mg/kg and this is endorsed. 
In the pivotal rabbit study, a number of mortalities were observed in control and treatment groups, 
none were attributed to the test-article and this is endorsed. Treatment daily oral administration with 
linzagolix at doses of 30 mg/kg was not associated with maternal toxicity, but was associated with a 
dose dependent increase in the incidence of non-pregnant animals (1, 4, 2 and 14 of 22 in the control, 
0.3, 3 and 30 mg/kg groups, respectively). It is suggested that this finding is likely related to linzagolix 
induced inhibition of implantation. Linzagolix was not associated with teratogenicity at doses used in 
the rabbit study, but an increased incidence of retarded ossification of the pubis was reported in the 30 
mg/kg group. The NOAEL for embryo-foetal development was set to be 3 mg/kg and this is endorsed. 
It should be noted that exposures at NOAELS in the Rabbit study are significantly lower than predicted 
total exposures anticipated clinically. This is considered acceptable given the proposed contraindication 
in pregnancy included in section 4.3 of the SmPC.  
The effects of linzagolix on pre- and post-natal development were assessed in SD rats administered 
doses of 0, 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg/day from gestation Day 6 to lactation Day 20. Doses used in the 
pivotal study were supported by two dose range finding studies in which a dose dependent increase in 
total litter loss was observed at doses in excess of 300 mg/kg. Of note, a maternal mortality was 
observed at the 300 mg/kg dose level in both DRF studies, no mortality was observed in the pivotal 
study at any dose level. Decreased body weight was observed in high dose animals from GD6-20. Total 
litter loss was noted in 3 of 22 dams in the 300 mg/kg group. No external abnormalities were noted in 
any F1 newborns. No effects on F1 viability were noted at any dose level. No dose dependent 
differences in F1 newborns in terms of external differentiation, sensory and reflex functions, or in an 
EMA/266814/2022

open field or water maze test. A significant decrease in the number of oestrus was noted during the 
observation period in the 30 mg/kg/day group as compared to the control group but it was considered 
that this change was an incidental fluctuation since the change was not observed in the 100 mg/kg/day 
or more dose groups. This is accepted. No difference in F1 copulation or fertility index was observed. 
No treatment related macroscopic abnormalities were evident in any of the F1 animals. The NOAEL for 
maternal and F1 toxicity was 300 mg/kg while the NOAEL for reproductive performance was 100 
mg/kg due to increased litter loss at 300 mg/kg and are endorsed. 
 Toxicokinetic data 
In mouse studies, TK data for linzagolix and KP017 show a sub-dose proportional increase in 
exposures. Linzagolix is rapidly absorbed following oral administration to mice with Tmax = 0.5 hours. 
Of note, Tmax for KP017 was also ≈ 0.5 hours in the 4-week study in CB6F1 mice and ranged from 2-6 
hours in the 13-week study in CD1 mice indicating rapid (first pass) metabolism. Only mild 
accumulation was evident following 4-week administration in both sexes (AUC0-24h accumulation ratio 
≈ 1.2), slightly higher in the 13-week study (AUC0-24h accumulation ratio ≈ 1.7). Females also 
exhibited higher exposures for linzagolix relative to males (1.5 and 1.2-fold higher in terms of AUC0-
24h at high dose in 4- and 13-week studies respectively), this was slightly more pronounced in CB6F1 
relative to CD1 mice. 
TK data for linzagolix were acquired in both Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar rat strains. An initial 4-
week repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted in SD rats. Linzagolix was absorbed rapidly with a 
Tmax ranging from 4-2 hours, Tmax at steady state was lower (=0.5 hours). Linzagolix was relatively 
rapidly metabolised to KP017 (Tmax = 2-6 hours). Exposures to linzagolix following dosing from 20-
2000 mg/kg increased in a less than dose proportional manner. No sex-related differences in exposure 
or accumulation were evident following 4-weeks administration. Males exhibited higher exposure to 
metabolite KP017 relative to females (≈ 2-fold in terms of AUC0-24h at week 4). A subsequent non-
GLP study was conducted to examine toxicity endpoints and TK in Wistar rats. In general TK acquired 
in this study were comparable to those in the SD rats. Tmax was rapid (0.5-2 hours), with exposures 
increasing in a less than dose proportional manner. Only minor sex related differences in linzagolix 
exposure were noted with males again exhibiting higher exposure to KP017. This study supported 
further toxicity studies to be conducted in Wistar rats. Similar results were reported in the 13 and 26-
week studies. Exposures increased in a sub dose proportional manner and linzagolix Tmax ranged from 
0.5 to 2 hours. In the 13-week study, no significant sex related differences in linzagolix exposure 
(slightly higher male exposure) were evident, whereas in the 26-week study higher exposures in 
females at week 26 were evident (1.5-fold in terms of AUC0-24h). Decreased exposure in terms of 
AUC0-24h was evident at 13 and 26 weeks indicating increased clearance. Of note, decreased 
exposure to KP017 was also noted in both sexes at later timepoints relative to day 1 suggesting this 
increase in clearance may not be related to metabolism. Linzagolix was detected in all control samples 
at week 13 in the 13-week study, the cause of this was not ascertained, but in vivo contamination 
could not be ruled out. It is accepted this does not significantly impact on the interpretation of data 
from this study. 
In dog studies, absorption was less rapid than rat with a Tmax ranging from 1.3 – 5 hours, no 
accumulation was evident following 14 days treatment and exposures to both linzagolix and KP017 at 
higher doses in the pivotal 28 day study were lower on day 28 than day 1. Exposures again increased 
in a non-dose proportional manner. It should be noted that linzagolix was detected in 6 samples in the 
control group week 4 samples in the 28-day study. This was at low levels, but the cause of this finding 
was not established.  
EMA/266814/2022

TK data were acquired in 4, 13- and 26-week studies in monkey. Linzagolix was absorbed quickly 
following oral administration with Tmax ranging from 2-4 hours. Exposure increased in a less than 
dose proportional manner. In the 4-week study, higher exposures to linzagolix and KP017 in males at 
high dose relative to females were evident (1.6-fold in terms of AUC0-24). Exposures were lower 
following 4-weeks exposure relative to day 1. In the 13-week study, Tmax for both linzagolix and 
KP017 were within the range of 2-5 hours. Exposures were lower at week 13 than on day 1 in line with 
previous studies. However, there were no significant sex related differences in exposure evident in the 
13-week study. In the 39-week study, there was no apparent sex related difference in exposure to 
either linzagolix or KP017, exposures to linzagolix at the end of the treatment phase were slightly 
lower than on day one (≈0.78 for males in terms of AUC0-24h). 
The applicant has presented exposure comparisons based on NOAELs defined in pivotal NC studies to 
those anticipated at steady state following daily 200 mg dosing. Exposure margins are presented in 
terms of absolute exposures as well as free drug. In terms of absolute exposures, margins to NOAELs 
in monkey studies defined relative to effects observed on the liver based on organ weight changes and 
increases in serum liver enzymes are less than 1. However, these are ≈ 3-fold in terms of free drug. 
From a non-clinical perspective risks related to hepatotoxicity identified in the monkey 13- and 39-
week studies are addressed via risk minimisation measures (wording in SmPC regarding liver 
enzymes).  
The presented data suggest sufficient exposure margins to findings in NC species. 
 Local Tolerance  
No local tolerance studies have been conducted as these are not applicable given the intended clinical 
use. The lack of dedicated local tolerance studies is thus considered acceptable. 
 Other toxicity studies 
Hepatotoxicity mechanistic studies 
A number of mechanistic studies were conducted, to further characterise the potential hepatotoxicity of 
linzagolix based on the increases in serum liver enzymes and liver weight in the absence of 
histopathological effects observed in dog and monkey repeat-dose toxicity studies. Linzagolix and 
KP017 exhibited low toxicity to human hepatocytes from a female donor in an in vitro assay (IC50 > 
600 μM and 300 μM for linzagolix and KP017 respectively). In contrast, IC50s for cell viability were 
much lower for hepatocytes sourced from a male donor (222 μM and 53 μM for linzagolix and KP017 
respectively). When the experiment was repeated using hepatocytes sourced from a new male donor 
and the original donor, no significant cytotoxicity was evident at the top concentrations tested. It is 
accepted that neither linzagolix nor KP017 exhibited significant hepatotoxicity in this in vitro assay.  
Additional mechanistic studies were conducted on samples obtained from 4-week repeat-dose toxicity 
study in beagle dogs. An analysis of altered metabolism post treatment suggested that linzagolix 
administration in dogs may be associated with altered cholesterol metabolism and reduced excretion of 
cholesterol and bile acids in the gallbladder, another purported finding was an increased activity of 
serum glutamate dehydrogenase, which was suggested as related to decreased allosteric inhibition by 
sex hormones. Linzagolix administration at doses up to 1000 mg/kg to beagle dogs was associated 
with liver enzyme induction in terms of activity and mRNA expression found no effect. Linzagolix and 
its metabolites were detected in both bile and abnormal contents in the gall bladder of the treated 
animals. 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 29/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
In a 4-week toxicity study conducted in cynomolgus monkey to further investigate the cause of the 
increases in serum liver enzymes observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in this species, 
elevations in serum ALT and GLDH were again observed (though no differences in liver weight were 
recorded). There was a mild increase in liver ALT activity recorded in this study (4.5-fold relative to 
control in female high-dose group), with no difference in GLDH activity reported. Increased liver mRNA 
expression of ALT2 and GLDH was reported in the female high dose group (2.5- and 2.7-fold control 
respectively), with decreased GLDH expression reported in treatment males. Minor liver 
histopathological findings including mononuclear cell infiltration and focal hepatocyte necrosis were not 
considered treatment related due to low incidence, severity and lack of dose response. This is 
endorsed.  It is also plausible that the increases in serum liver enzymes which were noticed to be 
related to enzyme induction rather than leakage from damaged hepatocytes. 
Mechanistic studies examining adverse effects on biliary system 
Additional in vitro and in vivo studies were submitted, to further investigate the cause of the abnormal 
gallbladder contents observed in mouse and dog repeat-dose toxicity studies. A non-GLP study 
examining the solubility saturation in mouse, dog, monkey and human bile revealed that at high 
exposures in the mouse and dog studies the bile concentration of linzagolix was in excess of saturated 
solubility. A GLP compliant study was performed to examine saturated solubility in bile sourced from 
several human volunteers, the worst case scenario in this study (i.e. lower end of the range) was 2700 
µg/ml, which was significantly in excess of the estimated human bile concentrations based on human 
plasma concentration data and bile to plasma ratios from non-clinical species. Therefore, it is accepted 
that these data do not suggest a significant risk of precipitation of linzagolix in human bile. 
Two 4-week administration in vivo studies in ICR mice were conducted to further characterise the 
effects of linzagolix administration on the biliary system in this species. Following 4-weeks daily 
administration of up to 1500 mg/kg linzagolix orally biliary sand was observed in the gall bladder of 
several animals. This was not associated with tissue injury. When analysed, the composition of this 
biliary sand contained only a small proportion of linzagolix and metabolite KP018 (0.0046 and 0.0034 
% respectively), this does not support the contention that this finding is primarily related to 
precipitation of linzagolix in bile. An additional in vivo study in ICR mice assessed linzagolix 
concentrations in plasma and bile following 7-days oral administration of doses of up to 750 mg/kg. 
The concentration in bile was found to be in excess of the saturation solubility of linzagolix, the 
applicant contends that these data suggest that the biliary sand is likely precipitated linzagolix. 
However, as stated previously, it appears that linzagolix and detectable metabolites represent only a 
small proportion of biliary sand per weight, with total protein representing the highest proportion.  
An additional two-week oral administration study was conducted in beagle dog administered doses of 
up to 1000 mg/kg/day to further characterise this finding in that species. Linzagolix was found to be 
the primary component in bile in this study and was present at a concentration in excess of the 
saturated solubility in bile in this species in both 100 and 1000 mg/kg groups. Choleliths were 
observed in the gall bladder of one animal at 100 mg/kg and one animal at 1000 mg/kg in this study. 
Protein was the primary component of these choleliths. Linzagolix was detected at 0.664 and 0.250 % 
dry weight of the choleliths from the 100 and 1000 mg/kg animal respectively.  
As such, while it is accepted that linzagolix precipitate is present in the observed biliary sand in both 
affected species, it does not appear to be the primary component. It is possible that this triggers 
additional precipitation, the mechanism for this apparent effect remains to be elucidated. An additional 
study conducted assessing PK parameters in monkey and dog following 7-days oral administration 
found suggested choleliths formation was related to bile linzagolix exposure and was no choleliths were 
evident in monkey. Given these findings and the previously calculated exposures in human bile 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 30/155 
 
  
 
 
discussed above, it is accepted that based on the totality of the data, this finding is unlikely of clinical 
relevance. 
Mechanistic studies examining the effects on sex hormones 
An additional series of studies were conducted in sexually mature female  and aged female Wistar rats 
to further examine the effect of linzagolix treatment of prolactin, E2 and P4 levels to determine if 
treatment induced alterations in these sex hormones could be related to the observed increase in 
incidence of uterine adeno carcinomas observed in the pivotal 2-year rat carcinogenicity study. 
E2 levels were increased in sexually mature rats in the mid dose (50 mg/kg/day) (52258) but were not 
increased in aged rats at any dose. In sexually mature rats (3 months of age), oestrous cycle was 
slightly prolonged, but the ovary and uterus were not atrophic at 500 mg/kg/day and below.  
In sexually mature Wistar rats, increased levels of E2 and E/P ratio were observed in the mid dose 
group (50 mg/kg) with decreased E2 and E/P ratio in the high dose group (2000 mg/kg). It is noted 
that a biphasic effect of pituitary gland weight was noted in rat repeat dose toxicity studies with 
increased weight at mid doses and decreased weight at high doses. Organ weight and histopathology 
showed reproductive organ atrophy at doses in excess of 50 mg/kg. In aged Wistar rats, treatment 
related decreases in E2 and P4 resulted in no change in E/P ratio. It is accepted that these studies do 
not suggest the increased incidence in endometrial adenocarcinomas in the pivotal carcinogenicity 
study in Wistar rats were mediated via increases in E2.  
Phototoxicity 
Phototoxic potential of linzagolix was assessed in a GLP-compliant in vitro and in vivo study. Linzagolix 
was reported as positive for phototoxicity in a standard in vitro assay utilising Balb/c 3T3 mouse 
fibroblasts. A GLP-compliant in vivo study in pigmented long-Evans rats was then performed to further 
characterise this risk. Animals were dosed with single oral doses of up to 1000 mg/kg and then 
exposed to UV radiation 8 hours following this. Rats received a UVR dose of 0.5 MED. An appropriate 
positive control (8-MOP) confirmed the validity of the study. 
In general, this was an appropriately conducted study. Of note, although no linzagolix was detected in 
the vehicle formulation, linzagolix was detected at levels over the LLOQ in plasma from 3 of the 4 
vehicle control animals. The cause of this contamination is not clear, but may have been at the 
analytical stage. Given the detected levels were significantly lower than those at the lowest dose level 
tested (≈500-1000 fold), it is accepted this is unlikely to affect the results of the study. Exposure to 
KP017 was also demonstrated. No phototoxic response was observed in this test. As in vivo results are 
considered to supersede in vitro results in line with ICH S10 recommendations, linzagolix can be 
considered as non-phototoxic. 
 Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Log Kow was assessed over a range of pH using the shake flask method in a GLP-compliant OECD 107 
(method A) study. Log Kow ranged from 1.8 to -0.378 between environmentally relevant pH 5-9, with 
a value of 1.8 at pH 5 the highest recorded. The study appears to have been conducted appropriately 
and it is accepted that linzagolix does not trigger further PBT assessment. 
The refined Fpen was in excess of the trigger value. The applicant has stated that as linzagolix is an 
endocrine active substance a tailored phase II risk assessment has been completed. 
The Sorption characteristics of linzagolix were characterised in 3 soil and 2 sludge types via a GLP-
compliant OECD 106 study. Adsorption was relatively low in all soil and sludge samples tested and did 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 31/155 
 
  
 
 
not trigger terrestrial compartment assessment. Linzagolix was not readily biodegradable in a GLP-
compliant OECD 301F test. 
Toxicity studies with aquatic organisms were conducted including growth inhibition in 
Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and reproduction in Daphnia magna. Linzagolix demonstrated relatively 
low toxicity in both studies with no significant toxicity evident in either study and the highest 
concentration assessed (100 mg/L and 10 mg/L respectively) identified as the NOEC. Linzagolix did not 
exhibit significant toxicity to microorganisms in STP activated sludge at any of the concentrations 
tested in an activated sludge respiration inhibition test.  Validity criteria were met for all studies and 
results are considered valid. Following the application of the appropriate assessment factors, PEC/PNEC 
comparisons do not indicate Linzagolix as posing a threat to the environment. 
As linzagolix is an endocrine active substance, the applicant has not conducted a fish early-life stage 
toxicity and instead a Medaka extended one generation reproduction test will be conducted and 
submitted in the post-authorisation setting.  
As per the current guidance in place (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr. 21*), an OECD 308 test needs 
to be included as part of Phase II tier A assessment for substances which are not readily 
biodegradable. This was not provided, but the applicant has committed to performing an OECD 308 
Aerobic Transformation in Aquatic Sediment Systems study post-authorisation. This is acceptable to 
the CHMP. 
As there are no data on the transfer of linzagolix to sediment available, the applicant has conducted an 
OECD 218 study to assess the effects of linzagolix on sediment dwelling organism Chironomus riparius. 
This study met its validity criteria. Toxicity of linzagolix to sediment dwelling organisms appears low 
with the highest concentration (360 mg/kg) tested identified as the NOEC in this study. Following 
calculation of normalised PECsed and PNECsed, it is accepted that linzagolix does not appear to pose a 
risk to sediment dwelling organisms.

 Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Proof of concept has adequately been demonstrated via in vitro receptor binding and inhibition studies 
and in vivo studies examining effects in female rats and monkey. In vitro binding studies were 
presented, assessing the affinity and Ki values of linzagolix against GnRH receptors from humans as 
well as rat, dog and monkey, but without data on binding in mouse or rabbit. It is accepted that 
atrophy to reproductive organs in these species demonstrates appropriate pharmacological activity. 
Pharmacokinetics 
An extensive characterisation of the pharmacokinetics of linzagolix in non-clinical species was 
submitted, as well as a comprehensive investigation of the potential for linzagolix to act as the victim 
or perpetrator of PK DDI. These studies identified that linzagolix is an inhibitor of OATP1B1. It was 
further clarified that the IC50 for linzagolix at the OATP1B1 transporter is < 25-fold the hepatic inlet 
concentration.  
Argumentation was provided that a clinical study to assess the potential clinical relevance of the 
observed in vitro inhibition of OATP1B1 is not required based on the marginality of the in vitro IC50 
relative to the 25-fold the hepatic inlet concentration threshold. It was also argued that no clinical 
study is needed based on the lack of accumulation of linzagolix (itself an OATP1B1/B3 substrate). Even 
as no adverse reactions were reported to be associated with concomitant use with other OATP1B1 
substrates during the phase 3 trials, the dataset was considered too limited to draw any conclusions 
regarding the clinical relevance of such interactions. 
As such, in line with the EMAs ‘Guideline on the investigation of drug interactions’ 
(CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2**) the applicant has committed to conduct a clinical study to 
assess the potential clinical relevance of OATP1B1 inhibition and update the product information. The 
CHMP agreed that this can be followed-up in the post-authorisation phase.

Toxicology 
An evaluation of the potential toxicological effects of linzagolix in rats, mice, monkey and dog was 
provided. Primary toxicological effects were in line with the predicted pharmacology of linzagolix. 
NOAELs were defined in rat and mouse studies at levels at which there were adverse effects on 
reproductive organs. These are considered LOAELs. NOAELs for monkey studies were below 1 and the 
applicant was requested to discuss this issue, correlate findings of increased levels of ALT and GLDH 
and increased liver weight found in monkeys at 100 mg/kg with human situation.  
In the rat 104-week carcinogenicity study, a dose dependent increase in the incidence of uterine 
endometrial adenocarcinoma was observed. Furthermore, an increase in mammary gland 
adenocarcinoma was seen in the mid-dose group. The data are not currently sufficient to conclude on 
the possible clinical relevance of these findings. However, it is accepted that from a non-clinical 
perspective, all issues are appropriately addressed through the relevant information which was 
included in the SmPC. 
ERA 
The applicant has committed to submit an OECD 308 study to assess aerobic transformation in water-
sediment system in line with the current ERA guidance (Doc. Ref. EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 
21*).  
As a result of the above considerations, the available data do not allow to conclude definitively on the 
potential risk of linzagolix to the environment.  
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation: 
1. in line with the EMA “Guideline on the investigation of drug interactions” (CPMP/EWP/560/95/rev. 1 
corr. 2), the applicant will conduct a clinical study to assess the potential clinical relevance of OATP1B1 
inhibition identified in-vitro and inform the product information. 
2. in line with the EMA “Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for 
human use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr. 2), the applicant will submit an OECD 308 study to 
assess aerobic transformation in water-sediment system. 
 Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical package submitted is considered sufficient to support a marketing authorisation for 
linzagolix.

A number of major findings were identified in the inspection which may have impacted on the quality 
of data and GCP compliance. In relation to the quality of data, major findings MA01 (equipment), 
MA06 (safety reporting), MA07 (IMP, including maintaining the integrity of the blind), MA08 (clinical 
data management) and MA09 (clinical study report) had particular relevance, and all major findings 
potentially impacted on GCP compliance. Notwithstanding areas identified where further actions 
relating to CAPAs are required overall the CAPAs have addressed the findings, and thus, components

 Clinical pharmacology 
 Pharmacokinetics 
Linzagolix, also called OBE2109 or KLH-2109, is a new orally active, non-peptide gonadotropin 
releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist.  
Throughout the clinical development program, several linzagolix immediate release film-coated tablet 
formulations have been used. These included a formulation, which was used during Phase 1 studies, 
and a formulation A which was used in the uterine fibroid confirmatory Phase 3 program. An immediate 
release film-coated tablet formulation B is the intended to-be-marketed formulation. Formulation B is 
homothetic tablets containing 100 mg or 200 mg linzagolix. 
Bioanalytical methods 
Bioanalytical methods were developed and validated for the determination of linzagolix and its 
metabolite KP017 and other analytes in various matrices (plasma, ultrafiltered plasma, urine and 
serum). The method validation reports provide data pertaining to selectivity; lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ); characterisation of potential matrix interference; intra- and inter-assay accuracy 
and precision; dilution integrity; carryover and analyte stability. The inter- and intra-run precision 
(%CV) and accuracy (%RE) of each method was evaluated in calibration standards (CS) and quality 
control (QC) samples and found to be within ±20% of the nominal value at the LLOQ, and ±15% for all 
other concentration levels above the LLOQ. The dilution integrity of linzagolix was demonstrated from 
50000 ng/mL and 111000 ng/mL. Pre-dilution of study samples was used during analysis and 
discussed in the relevant study plans. 
Bioanalytical Assessment of Samples  
During the analysis of participant samples, spiked CS and QC standards were measured for 
determination of the concentration of each analyte and the assessment of accuracy and precision. The 
samples from all but two of the clinical studies were analysed within the validated stability period and 
the exceptions were discussed. The overall precision and accuracy of CS and QC samples assessed for 
each study was found to be within ±20% of the nominal value at the LLOQ, and ±15% for all other 
concentration levels above the LLOQ. Incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) was employed to demonstrate 
reproducibility of the sample analysis methods. The percentage difference between the initial 
concentration and the concentration measured in the ISR samples was not greater than 20% in at 
least 67% of the samples.

Absorption  
In the mass balance study KLH1103, following a single administration of 200 mg [14C]linzagolix oral 
solution to healthy subjects, linzagolix was rapidly absorbed, with a median Tmax of 2.50 hours (range 
1.25 to 4.00 hours).  
The absolute bioavailability of linzagolix has not been determined. 
A first in human, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single centre, phase 1 study has 
investigated single and multiple doses, with sequential dose escalation. The study was performed in 
two parts, a single ascending dose (SAD) part in post- and pre-menopausal Caucasian women and a 
multiple ascending doses (MAD) part in pre-menopausal Caucasian and Japanese women. 
The results of this study demonstrated that linzagolix and its metabolite KP017 exposures increased in 
a dose-dependent manner. Peak concentrations of linzagolix were generally achieved between 1-4 
hours. The half-life of linzagolix was about 15–18 h. There was no relevant difference in PK between 
post- and pre-menopausal or between Caucasian and Japanese women. After multiple dosing, the PK 
of linzagolix and KP017 were linear over the dose range 100–400 mg daily and there was no significant 
accumulation. 
Another phase I, single-centre, randomised, open-label study investigated the bioequivalence, with a 
two-period cross-over design and with a single administration of two formulations of OBE2109 in 20 
healthy female participants. 
The participants were randomised to either of the following 2 sequences of treatment: 
•  OBE2109 2x100 mg formulation A / OBE2109 2x100 mg formulation B; 
•  OBE2109 2x100 mg formulation B / OBE2109 2x100 mg formulation A. 
The reference formulation A was an immediate release film-coated tablet which was used in the uterine 
fibroid confirmatory Phase 3 program. The test formulation B was an immediate release film-coated 
tablet which is the intended to-be-marketed formulation . The highest common strength of both 
formulations (i.e. 100 mg tablets) was used to establish bioequivalence. A 200 mg (2 x 100 mg) dose 
of linzagolix was used in this study as it was the highest anticipated therapeutic dose. 
Treatments were administered in the fasting state. Each administration was separated by a 7-day 
washout period. A total of 15 blood samples per period were drawn for PK assays over 72 hours. 
The design of this bioequivalence study was acceptable, and the results of this study demonstrate 
bioequivalence between 2 x 100 mg linzagolix formulation A tablets (clinical phase 3 formulation) and 
2 x 100 mg linzagolix formulation B tablets (to-be-marketed formulation). It was agreed that the slight 
delay in Tmax observed with the formulation B was not clinically relevant. 
The proposed biowaiver approach for the 200 mg strength was also acceptable, since the 
pharmaceutical products were manufactured by the same manufacturing process, the qualitative 
composition of the different strengths is the same and the composition of the strengths are 
quantitatively proportional. Moreover, further dissolution data at 4 different pH media over the 
physiological range have been provided, comparing the dissolution profiles of one tablet of 100 mg vs. 
one tablet of 200 mg each from a validation batch representative for the commercial drug product. 
Dissolution profiles have been compared also with the results obtained in pivotal BE study. General 
biowaiver criteria were thus fulfilled.  
The influence of food was evaluated in two separate studies. Overall, the results demonstrated no food 
effect for linzagolix and its metabolite (KP017) in terms of the extent of bioavailability 
(AUCfed/AUCfasted). There was a delay and decrease in Cmax after administration with a high fat

meal, however this is not of clinical relevance in the context of chronic daily administration of linzagolix 
and the clinical effect being due to sustained suppression of GnRH receptors. Linzagolix can be taken 
with or without food. 
Distribution 
In vitro, the major binding protein for linzagolix was albumin. In vivo, the unbound linzagolix fraction 
in plasma ranged between 0.075% (CV: 8%) and 0.099% (CV: 23%) in healthy female volunteers in 
two studies.  
An in vitro blood partitioning study showed that linzagolix does not partition into red blood cells. This 
observation was confirmed in vivo: Levels of total radioactivity were approximately 50% lower in whole 
blood compared to plasma. 
The volume of distribution was consistent among the linzagolix PK studies at approximately 11 L with 
mean values ranging from 6 L to 19 L. Being lower than total body water indicates low distribution into 
peripheral tissues in accordance with the plasma protein binding records. 
Elimination 
The mean T1/2 of linzagolix was consistent among the different PK studies and was approximately 17 
hours, ranging between 7.9 and 24.1 hours.  
An open-label, single oral dose study was designed to determine the absorption, metabolism and 
excretion of radioactivity in 6 healthy female subjects following a single oral administration of 200 mg 
[14C]linzagolix under fasted conditions. 
The total recovery of the administered dose (data combined for the urinary and faecal excretion) was 
90.0% over the 240 hour-period after dose administration. Renal excretion was the main route of 
elimination of linzagolix. Unchanged linzagolix was the major component in urine and faeces. 
Linzagolix and up to 7 oxidative metabolites were distinguished across plasma, urine, and faeces. The 
predominant component in plasma was unchanged linzagolix. All plasma metabolites were present at 
less than 10% of the total drug related exposure. According to results of the mass balance study, 
exposure to KP017 metabolite was 5% of the total plasma exposure. 
The major route of biotransformation of linzagolix is the oxidative O-demethylation to the main 
metabolite KP017. The affinity of KP017 to human GnRH receptors is approximately 4.4 times lower 
than for linzagolix. 
In a mass balance study, following a single 200 mg dose of linzagolix, the median Tmax of KP017 was 
3.00 hours (range 2.02 to 4.00) and the geometric mean t1/2 was 19.8 hours (range 16.7 to 22.6 
hours). The geometric mean (CV%) AUC0-∞ and Cmax for KP017 were 19500 ng.h/mL (66.5%) and 
1280 ng.mL (86.8%), respectively, and were approximately 4% of those for linzagolix. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Linzagolix and metabolite KP017 Cmax and AUC0–inf increased in a dose-dependent manner following 
single doses ranging from 12.5 to 400 mg, and multiple doses ranging from 100 to 400 mg. 
There was no significant accumulation of linzagolix at any of the 3 dose levels. The accumulation ratios 
for Cmax and AUCτ were 1.1–1.3 and 1.2–1.5, respectively. Similarly, there was no significant 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 38/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
accumulation of KP017 at any of the 3 dose levels. The accumulation ratios for Cmax and AUCτ were 
1.1–1.3 and 1.3–1.4, respectively. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
A phase 1, non-randomized, open-label, single-dose study was conducted  to evaluate the effect of 
varying degrees of impaired renal function (i.e., mild, moderate, severe renal impairment [RI], and 
end-stage renal disease [ESRD] on haemodialysis) on the PK, safety, and tolerability of linzagolix and 
its major metabolite, KP017.  
Healthy female subjects were matched to female subjects with RI for age (± 10 years) and body mass 
index (BMI) (± 20%). All subjects received a single dose of 200 mg linzagolix. 
Overall, RI had no major effect on total plasma linzagolix PK. A tendency for higher total plasma 
linzagolix exposures was observed in moderate RI, severe RI and ESRD subjects. In addition, the half-
life of total plasma linzagolix tended to increase in the RI cohorts compared to matched healthy-control 
subjects. 
The mean unbound fraction of linzagolix was increased in the mild RI, moderate RI, severe RI, and 
ESRD cohorts by approximately 10%, 43%, 41%, and 74%, respectively, compared to matched 
healthy-control subjects.  
Total KP017 exposure (AUC0-inf) increased in mild RI, moderate RI, severe RI, and ESRD cohorts by 
20%, 90%, 93%, and 144%, respectively, compared to matched healthy-control subjects. Cmax 
increases were less pronounced at 7%, 21%, -3%, and 20%, respectively. 
The mean unbound fraction of KP017 was increased in the mild RI, moderate RI, severe RI, and ESRD 
cohorts by approximately 1.6%, 2.5%, 24.7% and 60.9%, respectively, compared to matched healthy-
control subjects. Unbound KP017 exposure (AUCu0-inf) increased in mild RI, moderate RI, severe RI, 
and ESRD cohorts by 19%, 95%, 139%, and 285%, respectively, compared to matched healthy-
control subjects. Cmax increased by 7%, 24%, 20%, and 89% across the RI/ESRD cohorts. 
Mild RI had no major impact on the amount of linzagolix and KP017 excreted in urine compared to 
matched healthy-control subjects. The amount of linzagolix excreted in urine for moderate RI, severe 
RI, and ESRD subjects was decreased by approximately 41%, 83%, and > 99%, respectively, 
compared to matched healthy-control subjects. Similarly, the amount of KP017 excreted in urine for 
moderate RI, severe RI, and ESRD subjects was decreased by approximately 21%, 82%, and > 99%, 
respectively, compared to matched healthy-control subjects. 
A new PK analysis was performed when renal function groups were reclassified based on absolute GFR 
(mL/min), in line with the EMA guideline, calculated using Cockcroft-Gault (C-G) equation. The 
reanalysis concentrated on subjects with mild and moderate RI compared to matched control subjects 
with normal renal function (healthy subjects were not reclassified). Reanalysis was not performed on 
subjects in the severe or ESRD cohorts as it only impacted one severe RI subject who was reclassified 
as moderate, and the SmPC recommendation remains the same i.e., use of linzagolix should be 
avoided in patients with severe RI and ESRD diseases.  
The overall conclusions of the study remained unchanged. Regardless of how the GFR is calculated, the 
effect of mild renal impairment on linzagolix exposure (total and unbound) was not clinically 
meaningful. The effect of moderate RI patient on linzagolix total exposure is minimal but mean 
unbound total exposure (AUCu0-inf) increased by approximately 50%.  
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 39/155 
 
  
 
 
 
As in the other studies, in severe RI and ESRD subjects an increase in the mean extent of unbound 
exposure (AUCu0-t) of around 2-fold was demonstrated (i.e. GMR of 198.36% and 188.72%, for 
severe RI and ESRD, respectively), and as the higher bound CI of almost 300% was observed for both 
groups, the conservative approach was chosen to recommend that Yselty should be avoided in women 
with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease. 
In subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment the relative change of unbound fraction is 
marginal, and extent of exposure AUCu0-t was increased by 30% (GMR= 131%) and 50% (GMR = 
151%), respectively with a higher bound CI of about 200%. Given the above, no dose adjustment is 
necessary in subjects with mild renal impairment (eGFR = 60-89 mL/min), however monitoring for 
adverse reactions is recommended in the SmPC. 
An increase in unbound linzagolix exposure in subjects with moderate RI is about the same as in 
subjects with severe RI and ESRD, and therefore the same conservative approach was taken to advise 
that treatment should be avoided in patients with moderate renal impairment. This has been reflected 
accordingly in the SmPC. 
Impaired hepatic function 
This was investigated during a phase 1, non-randomized, open-label, single-dose study on the effect of 
varying degrees of impaired hepatic function (i.e., mild, moderate, and severe) on the PK, safety, and 
tolerability of linzagolix and its metabolite, KP017. 
Healthy female subjects were matched to female subjects with HI for age (± 10 years) and body mass 
index (BMI) (± 20%). All subjects received a single dose of 200 mg linzagolix. 
Overall, HI (mild, moderate, and severe) had no relevant effect on total linzagolix PK. Total linzagolix 
t1/2 in HI subjects was shorter than in healthy controls and, thus, accumulation beyond that observed 
in healthy women is not expected in a clinical setting. 
Mean unbound fraction (%) was 0.099, 0.097, 0.110, and 0.250 for healthy matched control subjects, 
mild HI, moderate HI, and severe HI, respectively. Overall, mild and moderate HI had no relevant 
effect on unbound linzagolix PK while severe HI had a significant effect. 
Total KP017 AUC0-inf decreased mild HI, moderate HI and severe HI cohorts by approximately 4%, 
18%, and 23%, respectively, compared to matched healthy controls. Cmax decreases were 
approximately 4%, 27%, and 56%, respectively. 
The mean unbound fraction of KP017 was 0.58%, 0.52%, 0.59%, and 0.94% for healthy matched 
control subjects, mild HI, moderate HI, and severe HI subjects, respectively. Unbound KP017 exposure 
(AUCu0-inf) decreased in mild HI and moderate HI cohorts by 13%, 18%, respectively, but increased 
by 24% severe HI. Cmax decreased by 13%, 26% and 30% across the HI cohorts. 
The results indicated that mild and moderate hepatic impairment has no relevant effect on total and 
unbound plasma linzagolix PK. Thus, it was agreed that linzagolix can be used in these subjects and no 
dose adjustment is warranted. 
Severe hepatic impairment had a minor effect on total plasma linzagolix PK, with exposures slightly 
increased compared to healthy controls. However, there was a marked effect on unbound linzagolix 
exposures. As a result, it was decided that Yselty should be avoided in women with severe hepatic 
impairment. Section 4.2 of the SmPC was aligned with the results of these studies. 
Race, age and weight 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 40/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
In one study, mean plasma linzagolix concentrations were generally found to be slightly higher in 
Japanese compared to Caucasian subjects.  
A population PK analysis to evaluate the effects of demographic factors (age, race and weight) on 
linzagolix PK was conducted. Additionally, results of the subgroup analyses from phase 3 studies were 
provided to test whether covariates identified had a clinically relevant effect on linzagolix 
efficacy/safety. The developed pop PK model is deemed adequate for the purpose of evaluating the 
effect of different covariates on linzagolix CL/F as outlined below: 
• 
• 
In the linzagolix clinical studies, the age of women ranged from 20 to 80 years (n=493, 
population PK dataset) with a median of 40 years. The population PK analysis did not 
demonstrate any clinically relevant impact of age on linzagolix exposure. 
The PopPK analysis showed that black subjects had a 22.5% decrease in CL/F relative to white 
subjects. A potential increase in linzagolix exposure in black subjects could be associated with 
an increase of AEs, such as risk of higher BMD loss. The analysis using the pooled safety 
analysis set did not indicate significant difference in BMD loss between black and non-black 
patients, although some limitations of this analysis were noted in the D80 Clinical AR. The 
potential increase in linzagolix exposure in black patients was not considered clinically relevant 
and it can be agreed that no dose adjustment is needed based on race/ethnicity.  
• 
In the population PK dataset, body weight was ranging from 42.5-144 kg, with median weight 
of 70.8 kg. A typical individual weighing 52.7 kg (5th percentile of BW distribution) is predicted 
to have 19.2% decrease in linzagolix CL/F compared to reference (70 kg) subject and potential 
for increased linzagolix concentrations and AEs. A sub-group analysis was performed for 
PRIMROSE 1 to assess changes in BMD by weight quartiles and by BMI quartiles. Both analyses 
did not show a clear impact of weight/BMI on BMD loss, although some limitations of this 
analysis were noted in the D80 Clinical AR.  
•  At 95th percentile, individual weighing 112 kg is predicted to have 42% increase in clearance 
with potential decrease in linzagolix concentrations and effect on efficacy. A subgroup analysis 
was done to assess reduction in HMB by weight quartiles and by BMI quartiles. The response 
rates for each treatment group were similar in each weight/BMI category. It can be agreed that 
no dose adjustment is needed in patients with low/high body weight or BMI. 
Elderly 
Linzagolix is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult 
women of reproductive age and, therefore, would not be used in elderly patients. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
• 
In vitro 
Drugs known for binding to serum albumin did not affect the plasma protein binding of linzagolix; 
conversely, linzagolix did not affect the plasma protein binding of other drugs. 
An in vitro CYP induction study indicated that linzagolix could induce CYP3A4/5 expression at high 
concentrations. No induction potential was observed for CYP1A2 and CYP2B6. 
In vitro inhibition studies of major CYP isoforms showed that linzagolix has direct and time-dependent 
inhibitory effects on CYP2C8 activity. No relevant inhibition was observed for CYP1A2, CYP2A6, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5. 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 41/155 
 
  
 
 
 
Linzagolix inhibited OATP1B1-, OATP1B3-, OAT1- and OAT3-mediated uptake with IC50 values of 11.2, 
32.7, 99.9, and 0.964 μmol/L, respectively. Linzagolix is not an inhibitor of OCT2, BCRP, BSEP, MATE1, 
and MATE2-K. Linzagolix was a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OAT3, but not a substrate of 
MDR1 (P-gp), OAT1, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K. 
There is no drug interaction potential between linzagolix and iron in vitro and in vivo or between 
linzagolix and calcium in vitro. There is also no drug interaction potential due to formation of chelate 
complexes between linzagolix and iron or calcium. 
• 
In vivo 
Linzagolix as a victim 
An open-label, two-period, single-sequence DDI study to investigate the effect of an OATP1B1/1B3 
inhibitor rifampicin on the PK of linzagolix was conducted in 12 healthy female subjects. 
A single dose of 200 mg linzagolix was administered alone on Day 1. After a wash-out of 7 days, a 
single dose of 200 mg linzagolix was administered concomitantly with a single dose of 600 mg 
rifampicin. 
Slight increases in linzagolix Cmax, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf (+14%, +19% and +19%, respectively) 
were observed when co-administered with rifampicin. No significant difference in tmax of linzagolix was 
observed. The slight differences in the PK profile of linzagolix when co-administered with rifampicin are 
not considered to be clinically meaningful. No clinically relevant interactions are expected between 
linzagolix and OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitors. 
Linzagolix as a perpetrator 
One open-label, single sequence, cross-over drug-drug interaction (DDI) study was performed to 
investigate the effect of multiple oral doses of linzagolix 200 mg on the PK of a single dose of the 
CYP3A4 substrate midazolam and the effect of food on the PK of linzagolix (reported above under 
influence of food) in 22 healthy women of childbearing potential. 
Each subject received a single oral dose of 2 mg midazolam on Day 1. On Day 2, each subject received 
a single oral dose of 200 mg linzagolix after a high-fat breakfast. From Day 6 the subjects received 
daily oral doses of 200 mg linzagolix (fasted) for 7 days. On Day 13, each subject received a single 
oral dose of 2mg midazolam and an oral dose of 200 mg linzagolix (fasted). 
The statistical analysis showed that all 90% CIs for GM ratios of Cmax, AUC0-24, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ 
fell entirely within the bioequivalence range of 80%-125%. Thus, the absence of an effect of linzagolix 
on the PK of midazolam and its main metabolite (and the absence of CYP3A4 induction by linzagolix) 
was concluded. 
Another DDI study investigated the effect of linzagolix on the PK of CYP2C8 substrate repaglinide in 18 
healthy female subjects. 
A single oral dose of 0.5 mg repaglinide was administered alone Day 1. After a wash-out of 2 days, 
200 mg linzagolix was orally administered once daily for 6 days from D3 to D8 with co-administration 
of a single oral dose of 0.5 mg repaglinide on D8. 
A significant increase of Cmax and AUC0-last (1.3 and 1.9-fold, respectively) was observed when 
linzagolix was co-administered with repaglinide. A significant delay in tmax of repaglinide (0.25 h) was 
also observed. The SmPC recommends avoiding the use of Yselty in patients using CYP2C8 sensitive 
substrates of a narrow therapeutic index and recommends monitoring for adverse reactions with other 
co-administered CYP2C8 substrates. 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 42/155 
 
  
 
 
In an open-label, single-sequence, DDI study investigating the effect of linzagolix on the PK of OAT3 
substrate benzylpenicillin in 15 healthy female subjects, a single IM dose of 600 mg benzylpenicillin 
was administered alone on Day 1. After a wash-out of 2 days, 200 mg linzagolix was administered 
orally with coadministration of a single IM dose of 600 mg benzylpenicillin. 
No modification of benzylpenicillin PK parameters (Cmax, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf) was observed when 
linzagolix was co-administered with benzylpenicillin (Table 9). No significant difference in tmax of 
benzylpenicillin was observed. No clinically relevant interactions are expected between linzagolix and 
OAT3 substrates. 
 Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamic effects of linzagolix were studied in Study KLH1101. Two dedicated PK/PD 
studies assessed the effects of linzagolix alone and in combination with oestradiol/norethisterone add-
back hormone replacement therapies. The cardiovascular effects of linzagolix were investigated in a 
series of three different studies (17-OBE2109-001, 18-OBE2109-005 and 19-OBE2109-002). 
Mechanism of action 
Linzagolix is an orally administered, non-peptide gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist. 
Linzagolix binds competitively to pituitary gland GnRH receptors and suppresses the secretion of the 
luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which leads to a decrease in serum 
oestradiol (E2) levels. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Study KLH1101 
The suppressive effects of linzagolix on gonadotropins (LH and FSH) and E2 were investigated in this 
first in women study.  
In the MAD part, 16 healthy pre-menopausal women participated in Cohort 1 (100 mg) and fourteen 
14 healthy pre-menopausal women were enrolled in Cohorts 2 (200 mg) and 3 (400 mg). Each subject 
started with an initial dose on Day 1 that was followed by a wash-out period of 48 hours. Thereafter, 
the participants were administered linzagolix once daily from Day 3 – 9. Treatment started on the 3rd 
or 4th day of the menstrual cycle. 
LH levels 
Following daily administration of linzagolix to pre-menopausal women, a suppressive effect was 
observed with a reduction in LH levels of approximately between 77% and 86% on Day 1. The 
maximum suppressive effect was observed between 6- and 8-hours post-dose and the LH level steadily 
returned to baseline levels by 48 hours post-dose for the 100 mg and 200 mg doses. The 400 mg dose 
provided a prolonged reduction in LH levels up to 48 hours post-dose. On Day 9, the LH levels were 
low following steady state concentration of linzagolix, and LH levels were similar to those at 24 hours 
post-dose on Day 1. 
FSH levels 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 43/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Daily administration of linzagolix resulted in a reduction in FSH levels of approximately 16% to 40% on 
Day 1. The maximum suppressive effect was observed dose-dependently between 6- and 24-hours 
post-dose. Following the intra-day suppressive effects of the 100 mg dose on Day 1 and Day 3, FSH 
levels returned to baseline or placebo control values within 24 hours of dosing during the repeat dosing 
period. Treatment at the 200 mg and 400 mg dose levels resulted in gradually decreasing trough FSH 
levels during the repeat dosing period. 
E2 levels 
Daily administration of linzagolix at 100, 200 or 400 mg/day resulted in a reduction in E2 levels of 
between 37% and 60% on Day 1. The E2 nadir was observed between 12- and 24-hours post-dose on 
Day 1. E2 returned to baseline levels within 48 hours post-dose at 100 mg/day and remained 
decreased at 200 and 400 mg/day. During the repeat dose period, E2 through levels remained 
constantly and dose-dependently reduced from Day 4 to 10 at 100 and 200 mg/day and from Day 4 to 
11 at 400 mg/day. 
Study 16-OBE2109-011  
This was a phase 1, randomised, open-label study to investigate the effect of linzagolix alone or in 
combination with add-back therapy (ABT) on estradiol (E2) PK in 76 healthy women of childbearing 
potential. 
After synchronising menstrual cycles with norethisterone therapy for 10 days, subjects were 
randomised to one of the following treatment regimens for 42 days: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Treatment regimen 100 mg: linzagolix 100 mg once daily,  
Treatment regimen 100 mg/LD: linzagolix 100 mg once daily & ABT low dose (E2 
0.5mg/norethisterone acetate [NETA] 0.1 mg) once daily, 
Treatment regimen 100 mg/STD: linzagolix 100 mg once daily & ABT standard dose (E2 
1 mg/NETA 0.5 mg) once daily, 
Treatment regimen 200 mg: linzagolix 200 mg once daily, 
Treatment regimen 200 mg/STD: linzagolix 200 mg once daily & ABT standard dose (E2 
1 mg/NETA 0.5 mg) once daily. 
E2 levels 
Trough E2 concentrations over the treatment period presented a dose-dependent E2 reduction, with an 
almost complete E2 suppression after treatment with daily dosing of 200mg linzagolix. All ABT 
regimens had median E2 values between 25 and 40 pg/mL, with 200 mg/STD being associated with 
the lowest levels and 100 mg/STD being associated with the highest levels. On Day 55, 2 weeks after 
the end of linzagolix treatment, all groups presented E2 levels indicating resumed ovarian activity, with 
minimal values of 40 pg/mL in all women. The highest proportion of women between the preferred 
range of 20 to 50 pg/mL was observed with the 100 mg/STD regimen.

Progesterone levels 
Progesterone remained at anovulatory concentrations (≤10 nmol/L) over the 6-week dosing period for 
all regimens with the exception of one woman at 100mg and one woman at 100mg/LD. These women 
were also noted to have increases in E2 and experienced bleeding. 
Menstrual Bleeding Pattern 
Administration of linzagolix alone (100 mg and 200 mg) promptly stopped vaginal bleeding. By Day 6, 
>50% of women were in amenorrhoea and by day 15, >85% were in amenorrhoea and remained so 
for the last 4 weeks of treatment. Similarly, 86% and 100% of women at 100 mg and 200 mg, 
respectively, were either in amenorrhea or had only spotting from Day 4 onward. The addition of ABT 
to the linzagolix regimen somewhat reduced the suppressive effects of linzagolix on vaginal bleeding in 
a regimen-specific manner. Amenorrhea was observed during the last 4 weeks of treatment in 21%, 
53%, and 33% of women in the 100 mg/LD, 100 mg/STD, and 200 mg/STD groups, respectively; and 
57%, 93%, and 67% had either amenorrhea or spotting only. 
Bone Turnover Biomarkers 
For bone formation markers, mean bone specific alkaline phosphatase and procollagen 1 N-terminal 
propeptide showed decreasing values and no obvious estradiol concentration related pattern. 
For the markers of bone resorption, the mean deoxypyridinoline/creatinine ratio increased by 47% and 
34% in the 100 mg and 200 mg linzagolix alone groups, respectively and by 25%, 18% and 17% in 
the 100 mg/LD, 100 mg/STD, and 200 mg/STD groups. Similarly, C terminal-telopeptide showed a 
trend towards higher increases in the linzagolix alone groups (68% and 89% for 100 and 200 mg, 
respectively) and lower increases when ABT was co-administered (44%, 31% and 24% in the 100 
mg/LD, 100 mg/STD, and 200 mg/STD groups, respectively).

Study 17-OBE2109-008 
This was an open-label, randomised, parallel-group, PK/PD study investigating the effect of linzagolix 
and concurrent or delayed add-back therapy administration on vaginal bleeding pattern, E2 and 
progesterone (P) levels in 32 healthy adult female subjects.  
After synchronising menstrual cycles with norethisterone therapy for 10 days, subjects were 
randomised to one of the following treatment regimens: 
•  Combined-ABT: 200 mg linzagolix co-administered with 1 mg E2/0.5 mg NETA QD for 70 days.  
•  Delayed-ABT: 200 mg linzagolix QD for 28 days, then 200 mg linzagolix co-administered with 1 
mg E2/0.5 mg QD for 42 days. 
Bleeding pattern 
In the “Delayed-ABT” group, linzagolix 200 mg alone promptly reduced bleeding, leading to 
amenorrhea in all subjects by week 5. When ABT was started in week 5, spotting (0.50 to 0.80 
days/week/subject) and bleeding (0 to 0.53 days/week/subject) occurred with spotting/bleeding being 
markedly more frequent compared with the “Combined-ABT” group (0.07 to 0.36 and 0.07 to 0.21 
days/week/subject, spotting/bleeding respectively) during treatment weeks 6 to 10. In the “Combined-
ABT” group, some spotting (0.38 to 0.69 days/week/subject) and occasional bleeding (0.06 to 0.25 
days/week/subject) occurred during the first half of the treatment period with a tendency to further 
decrease during the second half.

Notes:  Summary  representation of bleeding  category data:  Panel A  represents  the  mean  number of  spotting  days  per  week  and 
subject, Panel B represents the mean number of bleeding days per week and subject. Treatment days 1-7 (Week 1) results were 
excluded since following menses synchronization, linzagolix unrelated withdrawal bleeding occurred. Bleeding category “heavy 
bleeding” was not shown since it only occurred during the withdrawal bleeding period. Bleeding category “no bleeding” is the 
assumed default value and is therefore not shown. Red line: 200 mg Linzagolix + 1 mg E2/0.5 mg NETA QD (Days 1-70); Blue 
line: 200 mg Linzagolix QD (Days 1-28) and 200 mg Linzagolix + 1 mg E2 / 0.5 mg NETA QD (Days 29-70). 
During at least the last 4 weeks of treatment, for the “Combined-ABT” group, ~80% of women were in 
complete amenorrhea and ~85% were in amenorrhea or had spotting. For the “Delayed-ABT” group, 
~45% of women were in complete amenorrhea and ~75% were in amenorrhea or had spotting.

Linzagolix alone rapidly reduced E2 to reach a median level of 3.7 pg/mL in week 2 and of 4.1 pg/mL 
in week 4. Median E2 after combined linzagolix/ABT ranged between 35 and 42 pg/mL for the 
“Delayed-ABT” group (weeks 6 to 10) and between 24 and 32 pg/mL for the “Combined-ABT” group 
(weeks 2 to 10), respectively. 
At Week 4 end, 12 (75%) subjects were within the E2 category 20-50 pg/mL for concurrent ABT 
whereas 15 (93.8%) subjects were within the lower E2 category < 20 pg/mL for delayed ABT. From 
Week 6 through Week 10 following the start of co-administration of E2/NETA, a similar proportion of 
E2 values within the 20-50 pg/mL category was observed for both treatment groups. 
Progesterone (P) levels 
Throughout the entire study, most subjects had progesterone levels less than or equal to 10 nmol/L, 
indicating an absence of ovulation, with only 1 subject (7.1%) on Day 57 (concurrent ABT) and 1 
subject (6.7%) on Day 84 (delayed ABT), two weeks after treatment stop, with levels > 10 nmol/L.  
Secondary pharmacology 
Study 17-OBE2109-001 (TQTc study) 
This was a 2-part, double-blind, randomized study. Part 1 was a placebo-controlled, 1-period study and 
Part 2 was a placebo- and active-controlled, 4-period, crossover study. Subjects participated in only 
one part.  
In Part 1, the safety, tolerability, and PK of a single dose of 700 mg linzagolix was assessed to 
determine if the planned supratherapeutic dose level to be used in Part 2 of the study was well 
tolerated in 8 healthy adult female subjects. 
In Part 2, 48 healthy, adult, female subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment sequences. On Day 
1 of each period, subjects received a single oral supratherapeutic dose of linzagolix (Treatment C; 700 
mg), a single oral therapeutic dose of linzagolix (Treatment D; 200 mg), a single oral dose of placebo 
(Treatment E), or a single oral dose of moxifloxacin (Treatment F; 400 mg). Cardio-dynamic 
recordings and PK samples were collected pre-dose and over a period of 24 hours following each 
dosing. There was a washout of 7 days between dosing of each period. 
To determine the supratherapeutic dose, the Cmax accumulation factor of 1.17 was applied to the 
highest clinical dose (i.e., 200 mg per day) to obtain the clinical single dose of 234 mg. The highest 
possible Cmax for this dose was estimated at 100000 ng/mL. Based on single dose exposure data and 
assuming dose linearity, a single 700 mg dose Cmax should be 112208 ng/mL. 
Results 
A prolongation of the heart-rate corrected QT interval of < 2 ms beyond the 10 msec threshold was 
identified. Mean placebo-corrected change from baseline QT (ddQTcF) for the 2 linzagolix dose groups 
revealed upper bounds of the 90%, 2-sided CI of 10.23 and 11.81 msec for the 200 mg and 700 mg 
dose at 3 hours after administration, respectively. 
Heteroscedasticity was observed in the initial by time point analysis and a post-hoc analysis accounting 
for heteroscedasticity showed upper bounds of the 90%, 2-sided CI of 9.91 and 11.55 msec for 200 
mg and 700 mg linzagolix doses, respectively. 
Assay sensitivity was confirmed with the moxifloxacin arm of the study. 
The categorical data for QTcF showed no values greater than 480 msec and no changes greater than 
30 msec following the supratherapeutic and therapeutic doses.

A linear mixed model was used to assess the placebo-corrected changes from baseline in QTcF 
(ddQTcF) versus plasma linzagolix and KP017 concentrations. A positive relationship between was 
observed. The predicted effect at the geometric mean Cmax of linzagolix for the 700 mg dose was 7.90 
ms (CI 6.86 to 8.94 ms). However, the presence of hysteresis was observed. Therefore, linear 
concentration-QT modelling may not be valid; non-linear modelling may be more appropriate. The 
predicted effect at the geometric mean Cmax of KP017 for the 700 mg dose was 7.989 msec (6.959, 
9.020). Hysteresis was not observed.

Additional concentration-response modelling was performed using a range of different models.

Among all models fitted, none were without limitations. All linear models as well as the direct Emax 
models using both moieties or linzagolix alone had significant intercepts, which is not plausible. Only a 
direct Emax model based on the concentration of KP017 had a non-significant intercept.  
The QT effect prediction (upper limit of the 90% 2-sided CI of the predicted ddQTcF at Cmax) for all 
models except one, which was the least plausible one, were below the regulatory 10 ms threshold.

19-OBE2109-002 (J-Tpeak assessment) 
To address the discrepancy between the TQT study results and the in vitro ion channel data, an 
assessment of the heart rate corrected J-Tpeak interval based on the data of study 17-OBE2109-001 
was performed. 
Overall, the mean placebo-corrected change from baseline (ddJ-Tpeakc) ranged from 1.25 to 6.89 
msec for 200 mg linzagolix and from 0.80 to 6.89 msec for 700 mg linzagolix over the 24-hour 
assessment period. The observed slight J-Tpeakc prolongation was not dose-dependent and plateaued 
between 1- and 6-hours post-dose. The upper confidence limits of the 90%, 2-sided CI of ddJ-Tpeakc 
were below the proposed level of concern. Based on a linear mixed model, there was no relationship 
between ddJ-Tpeakc and plasma linzagolix or KP017 concentrations. Hysteresis was detected which 
may be due to the absence of an exposure-response relationship or be an artifact of the high-
variability max J-Tpeakc at 5.5 – 6 hours. The J-Tpeakc assessment indicated that the observed QTc 
prolongation is not clinically relevant. 
 Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical methods 
All bioanalytical method validation reports, and associated data analysis reports, were assessed in the 
context of the EMA guideline on method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 rev. 1 corr. 2**). 
Certificates of analysis for reference standards, statements on GLP compliance, quality assurance 
statements and SOPs were provided. 
In general, all validation reports provide sufficient data pertaining to the appropriateness of the LC-
MS/MS methods used to determine linzagolix, KP017, repaglinide, midazolam, norethindrone, estradiol 
and penicillin G in human plasma, serum and urine. For each method validation report submitted, data 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 50/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
were presented to confirm CC performance, specificity, the absence of significant carry-over and the 
absence of any significant matrix effect interfering with the determination of each analyte. Intra- and 
inter-assay performance were determined within accepted limits. 
The bioanalytical reports provided, exhibit acceptable CC and QC sample performance. The within 
study precision and accuracy were acceptable in all studies. Reproducibility was demonstrated based 
on incurred sample reanalysis. Throughout the clinical program, the observed Cmax of linzagolix was 
above the validated calibration curve range of 10 – 10000 ng/mL. Therefore, pre-dilution of plasma 
samples was applied during some studies. Precision and accuracy of the dilution factor was found to be 
within accepted limits for the relevant studies.  
The stability of linzagolix and its metabolite KP017 in female human serum was demonstrated for up to 
365 days at -24°C±6°C and for up to 484 days at - 75°C±10°C.  
Bioequivalence 
The results of the dedicated studies demonstrated bioequivalence between the formulation A(used in 
pivotal Phase 3 studies) and formulation B (intended for the market). It is agreed that the slight delay 
in Tmax observed with the formulation B is not clinically relevant. 
Influence of food  
Based on the results of the studies described in the pharmacokinetics section above, it is agreed that 
linzagolix can be taken with or without food. 
Elimination  
Both urinary and faecal routes of elimination were shown to be important in the elimination of 
linzagolix and its metabolites. A slightly greater proportion was eliminated in urine (51.5%) compared 
to 38.4% eliminated in faeces. Unchanged linzagolix was the predominant component in plasma, urine 
and faeces. All plasma metabolites were present at less than 10% of the total drug related exposure.  
PK in the target population 
The PK objective of the phase III study PRIMROSE 1 was to assess the population PK of linzagolix in 
premenopausal women suffering from heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. Inter-
individual variability of linzagolix and KP017 was relatively low in healthy pre-menopausal women but 
relatively high in the target population. This was attributed to differences in study design, protocol 
execution, and patient oversight. Overall, the median trough concentrations from PRIMROSE 1 study 
are comparable to previously published data from healthy women (Pohl et al., 2018) and PK in target 
population is expected to be similar to PK in healthy women.  
Renal impairment 
The design of the dedicated renal impairment study was acceptable; however, the renal function 
groups were initially defined using GFR normalised to a body surface area of 1.73 m2. This was not in 
line with the EMA Guideline (EMA/CHMP/83874/2014), which specifies that renal function groups 
should be defined based on absolute GFR (mL/min). Therefore, reclassification of subjects was done, 
and results based on absolute GFR in mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault equation were presented. It is 
acceptable that the reanalysis was not performed in subjects in severe or ESRD cohorts since the 
recommendation in the SmPC to avoid linzagolix in these subjects was unchanged.  
Using the C-G classification, the results were similar to those using the original MDRD classification for 
total linzagolix exposure metrics. Overall, there were small increases in total linzagolix concentrations 
in subjects with mild or moderate RI compared to matched healthy controls. 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 51/155 
 
  
 
 
Increases in unbound linzagolix exposure metrics using C-G classification in subjects with mild or 
moderate RI were more marked, ranging between ~30-33% higher in subjects with mild RI and ~28-
53% higher in subjects with moderate RI. Of note, the increases in unbound linzagolix exposure were 
higher (by ~12-17%) in subjects with mild RI based on the C-G classification. Whereas the increases 
in unbound linzagolix exposure were lower (by ~9-13%) in subjects with moderate RI based on the C-
G classification. 
Considering the overall conclusions of the reanalysis effect of mild RI on linzagolix exposure (total and 
unbound) does not warrant a dose modification. However, since there is approximately 30% increase 
(with upper bound of 90%CI of around 2-fold) in the unbound exposure in this group, and some 
adverse reactions (such as BMD loss, increases in LFT parameters, increases in lipid metabolism 
parameters have shown dose-dependency), the SmPC wording has been updated appropriately to 
reflect that caution (i.e. monitoring for adverse reactions) is recommended in patients with mild RI.  
On the other hand, AUC0-t,u in the moderate RI group was similar to the extent of exposure in severe 
RI and ESRD groups. Due to potential safety concerns over a longer term of use at higher unbound 
exposures, a recommendation to avoid use of linzagolix in subjects with moderate renal impairment is 
considered warranted. The SmPC has been updated appropriately to recommend the avoidance of use 
of linzagolix in women with moderate RI, as well as severe RI and ESRD. 
Hepatic impairment 
The design of the dedicated hepatic impairment study is acceptable. 
Severe hepatic impairment had a minor effect on total plasma linzagolix PK, with exposures slightly 
increased compared to healthy controls. However, there was a marked effect on unbound linzagolix 
exposures; Cmaxu and AUCu were 2- to 3-fold higher. This is consistent with a 2.5-fold increase in the 
unbound fraction observed in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. Sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the 
SmPC state that linzagolix should be avoided in these subjects.  
Mild and moderate hepatic impairment appear to have minimal effects on total and unbound plasma 
linzagolix PK. The SmPC contains relevant information in section 4.2 for these patients and a short 
presentation of study results was provided in section 5.2. 
Drug interactions 
In vitro and in vivo drug interaction studies were conducted, and the results are described in the 
dedicated pharmacokinetics section. 
No dedicated study to investigate potential effect of linzagolix on the PK of add-back therapy E2/NETA 
(estradiol and norethisterone acetate) and vice versa was performed. 
E2/NETA is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. Since the absence of linzagolix effect on CYP3A4 
was demonstrated, it is not expected that linzagolix could influence CYP3A4 metabolism of E2/NETA.  
Linzagolix is not significantly metabolized by a single CYP pathway and is not a sensitive substrate for 
major drug transporter proteins, it is not likely that linzagolix PK will be influenced by the co-
administered E2/NETA. 
No studies were performed to evaluate linzagollix potential effect on sulfotransferases or 
glucoronyltransferases. Since E2 and NET levels were in accordance with expected/published values, it 
is not expected that potential linzagolix effects on the conjugation processes by SULTs or UGTs would 
be clinically relevant.

Pharmacodynamics 
Primary pharmacology 
Study results generally support the expected pharmacodynamic properties of linzagolix ±add-back 
therapy. Overall, linzagolix at 100 mg and 200 mg rapidly reduced E2 to the levels below 20 pg/mL. 
Obtained E2 profiles showed constant dose-dependent suppression and rapidly resulted in controlled 
uterine bleeding. Add-back therapy partially impaired bleeding control; the best bleeding control was 
obtained with E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) add-back regimen. E2 levels were correlated with the observed 
occurrence of hot flushes, with the overall incidence being higher with higher doses of linzagolix and 
lower doses/absence of add-back therapy. 
Regarding the exploratory bone markers, there were global non-treatment specific decreases in bone 
formation markers. In regard to markers of bone resorption, the addition of ABT seemed to mitigate a 
linzagolix-related rise in deoxypyridinoline/creatinine ratio and Type I Collagen CTelopeptides 
suggesting reduced bone resorption. 
The optimal range of E2 levels for the treatment of endometriosis while minimizing bone mineral 
density (BMD) loss is between 20-50 pg/mL. For the 200 mg linzagolix alone regimen, 100% of 
subjects had E2 levels below 20 pg/mL at Week 4. For the 200 mg linzagolix/ABT regimen, around 
30% of subjects had E2 levels below 20 pg/mL at Week 4. For the 100 mg linzagolix alone regimen, 
50% of subjects had E2 levels below 20 pg/mL.  
Secondary pharmacology 
The clinical relevance of potential QT effects is unknown in patients with risk factors for QT 
prolongation or concomitant use of medicinal products known to prolong the QT, both of which were 
exclusion criteria in the PRIMROSE studies. The risk should also be monitored in women who may have 
higher exposures of linzagolix due to underlying conditions as described in Section 5.2. As such, 
section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated accordingly and sections 5.1 contains relevant information 
for healthcare professionals on cardiac electrophysiology. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
No clinical PD interaction studies were conducted. Given the mechanism of action of linzagolix and the 
observed effect of linzagolix on the QT interval, PD interactions are considered likely. Therefore, 
section 4.4 of the SmPC contains information regarding use of linzagolix with medications known to 
prolong the QT interval and sections 4.4 and 4.6 of the SmPC recommend use of effective non-
hormonal contraception to mitigate the risk of PD interactions with hormonal preparations.  
 Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the CHMP agreed that the PK and PD of linzagolix has been investigated to a satisfactory 
extent.  
 Clinical efficacy 
 Dose response study 
Study KLH1202 was a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled study in women with 
endometriosis. Approximately half of these subjects were also diagnosed with concurrent uterine 
fibroids. Analyses on this subgroup were performed to evaluate the efficacy of linzagolix in the control 
of bleeding. 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 53/155 
 
  
 
 
 
107 subjects were randomized to one of 4 treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio for placebo, linzagolix 
50 mg, linzagolix 100 mg or linzagolix 200 mg. Of these, 51 had concomitant uterine fibroids, which 
allowed for assessment of endpoints relevant to treatment of uterine fibroids.  
• 
Efficacy assessments relevant for the UF indication included:  
•  Bleeding assessments (assessed for the entire trial population as well as in the subgroup with 
uterine fibroids):  
• 
• 
• 
Presence/absence of menstruation during the treatment period  
Proportion of bleeding days at the end of treatment  
Time to amenorrhea  
•  Serum estradiol (E2)  
Randomised subjects had a mean ± SD age of 35.5 ± 6.6 years, weight of 54.1 ± 6.7 kg and BMI of 
21.2 ± 2.5 kg/m2. 
In the total population (with and without uterine fibroids), the 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg doses 
suppressed menstruation in 8 of 29 (27.6%), 19 of 26 (73.1%), and in 27 of 28 (96.4%) subjects, 
respectively compared to 0 of 24 in placebo.  
In women with uterine fibroids, the 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg doses suppressed menstruation in 1 of 
12 (8.3%), 8 of 12 (66.7%), and in all 13 (100%) subjects, respectively compared to 0 of 14 in 
placebo.  
In women with uterine fibroids ≥ 3 cm, the 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg doses suppressed 
menstruation in 1 of 4 (25%), 2 of 4 (50%), and in all 7 (100%) subjects, respectively compared to 0 
of 5 in placebo.  
Linzagolix dose-dependently reduced the proportion of uterine bleeding days at the end of treatment in 
subjects with fibroids. The mean proportion of bleeding days was 23.8% with 50 mg, 11.3 % with 100 
mg and 2.2% with 200 mg compared to 29.6% with placebo.  
These data demonstrated that a dose of 100 mg or higher would be required to adequately suppress 
fibroid-associated HMB and that better efficacy was achieved with a dose of 200 mg than 100 mg. 
Consequently, doses of 100 and 200 mg were chosen for testing in Phase 3 trials.

LGX = linzagolix 
The product was initially developed for the treatment of endometriosis. Doses of up to 400mg 
administered once daily for 7 days were investigated in premenopausal Japanese women. Tolerability 
was confirmed and plasma concentrations increased in a dose dependent manner at the dose range of 
100-400mg. No PK changes were demonstrated as a result of repeat daily dosing. A suppressive effect 
on pituitary gonadotrophins LH & FSH was demonstrated with a resultant reduction in estradiol levels. 
Based on the PK/PD results of the study, doses of 50mg to 200mg were further investigated in study 
KLH1202. There were 107 women in the dose finding study of which 51 had fibroids with 20 of them 
having fibroids of greater than 2 cm in size.  
Overall, the doses chosen for phase 3 appear appropriate based on the data from the PK/PD studies 
and this dose finding study in Japanese women with endometriosis. The clinical & PD endpoints in the 
dose finding study are appropriate. They show as indicated in the tables above, 100% & 50% 
amenorrhea in subjects treated with 200mg & 100mg respectively and a decrease in uterine volume.  
However, there were limitations to the study. There was a limited population of only 51 subjects with 
approximately 10 subjects in each dose group. The analysis was a retrospective sub-group analysis. All 
subjects were Japanese, had a normal BMI or low weight and had co-existent endometriosis not 
reflecting the subjects treated in the pivotal trial or the target population of women with uterine 
fibroids presenting for treatment in Europe.  This is being discussed in the efficacy section below. 
There was no data available concerning the uterine site of fibroids in women in the dose finding study. 
Data regarding NSAID use in the clinical trial programme was submitted, and it demonstrated that 
there was no impact of NSAID use on the primary efficacy endpoint.  
Selection of Hormonal Add-back Therapy  
With selection of a full oestradiol suppression dose (200 mg) for phase 3 evaluation of linzagolix in 
uterine fibroids, the need for hormonal add-back therapy to allow for treatment beyond 6 months was 
recognized. The dose and type of hormonal add-back therapy was assessed in dedicated studies. The 
best control of bleeding was achieved with the estradiol (E2 1 mg)/norethisterone acetate (NETA 0.5 
mg) dose and thus this regimen was selected for the phase 3 studies. 
 Main studies 
There were two phase 3 studies conducted to support the proposed indication.

Screening or Day 1 (prior to first dose).  
•  Treatments 
Once the screening central laboratory results and MBL volume measured by the AH method were 
received, all inclusion and exclusion criteria were to be reviewed. If eligibility was confirmed, the site 
was to contact the subject to confirm her willingness to continue in the study. If the subject confirmed, 
she was to be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to one of five treatment groups using an interactive web 
response system (IWRS):  
•  Placebo (placebo linzagolix + placebo E2/NETA)  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Linzagolix 100 mg (linzagolix 100 mg + placebo E2/NETA)  
Linzagolix 100 mg+ABT (linzagolix 100 mg + E2 1 mg/NETA 0.5 mg)  
Linzagolix 200 mg (linzagolix 200 mg + placebo E2/NETA)  
Linzagolix 200 mg+ABT (linzagolix 200 mg + E2 1 mg/NETA 0.5 mg)  
In order to maintain the blind, all subjects not receiving ABT were to receive a matching placebo.  
In the PRIMROSE 1 study: at the Week 24 visit, half of the subjects from the Placebo linzagolix + 
Placebo E2/NETA arm will to be switched to the linzagolix 200 mg with ABT (E2 1 mg/NETA 0.5 mg) 
group while the other half will remain on placebo (placebo linzagolix+placebo E2/NETA). This allocation 
was determined as part of randomization, hence the 1(0.5, 0.5):1:1:1:1 ratio.  
In the PRIMROSE 2 study: at the Week 24 visit, all subjects from the placebo arm were to be switched 
to linzagolix 200 mg+ABT (linzagolix 200 mg + E2 1 mg/NETA 0.5 mg) and all subjects from the 
linzagolix 200 mg without ABT arm were to receive linzagolix 200 mg+ABT. Subsequently, all subjects 
were to continue treatment for a further 28 weeks (up to 52 weeks). 
From the Week 24 visit of both studies, all subjects in the linzagolix 200 mg without ABT group were to 
receive linzagolix 200 mg with ABT.  
Treatment was to continue up to Week 52, and all subjects were to be followed up for 24 weeks after 
the end of treatment to assess persistence of treatment effect, safety, and BMD recovery.

Safety Endpoints 
BMD assessed by DXA for femoral neck, hip, and spine at weeks 24, 52 and 76.  
•  Frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).  
•  Any clinically significant changes from baseline in clinical laboratory assessments: 
haematology, coagulation parameters, chemistry, lipids, and serum hormones.  
•  Any pathological changes from baseline in the endometrium as assessed by histology from 
endometrial biopsies performed at Weeks 24 and 52.  
•  Change from baseline in any other safety parameter including weight, vital signs, ECG, 
gynaecological assessment, breast assessment and endometrial thickness.  
Pharmacokinetic endpoints 
•  Values for the PK parameters of linzagolix including the apparent clearance (CL/F), and 
volume of distribution (V/F), may be determined using a population pharmacokinetic 
approach. Individual linzagolix exposure (maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the 
curve (AUC)) will then be estimated.  
•  Sample size 
The planned sample of approximately 500 subjects was based primarily on the total number of 
exposed subjects required for drug registration. In terms of the primary efficacy endpoint, under the 
assumption of a 30% response rate in the placebo arm and a 70% response rate in an active arm, a 
conservative 64 subjects per treatment group would be required to obtain at least 90% power for 
rejecting all of the linzagolix group vs. placebo group comparisons, each tested separately using a 
Bonferroni corrected type I error of 0.0125 (0.05 divided by 4). The assumptions are considered 
reasonable. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Once eligibility was confirmed, subjects were randomized to one of the five treatment groups in a 1 
(0.5, 0.5):1:1:1:1 ratio using a centralized IWRS.  
The allocation of subjects in a 1(0.5,0.5):1:1:1:1 ratio was determined as part of the randomization 
process because at the Week 24 visit, half of the subjects from the Placebo linzagolix + Placebo 
E2/NETA arm were switched to the linzagolix 200 mg with add-back (E2 1 mg/NETA 0.5 mg) group 
while the other half remained on placebo.  
A computer-generated randomization list using random allocation of treatment according to a 
permuted block randomization stratified by race was used for randomization. Randomization was 
stratified by race to ensure an equal representation of black women in all treatment arms.  
Treatment allocation was to remain blinded for the Investigator and the subject up to the final week 76 
database lock. The Sponsor was unblinded at week 24. Randomization was not to be postponed if the 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 62/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
results of the screening endometrial biopsy were not available; however, the subject was to be 
withdrawn immediately if results of this biopsy indicated a clinically significant abnormality.  
The randomization number of a subject who withdrew from the study after randomization was not to 
be re-allocated, regardless of whether or not the subject had received study treatment. 
This study was double-blinded.  
Placebos were used for both the test drug (linzagolix) and the add-back therapy (E2/NETA). Placebo 
was also used to maintain the blind for linzagolix dose levels: subjects randomized to linzagolix 200 
mg received 2 linzagolix tablets at each administration while those randomized to linzagolix 100 mg 
received one placebo tablet and one linzagolix tablet and those randomized to placebo received 2 
placebo tablets.  
Placebo tablets (to match linzagolix) and capsules (to match E2/NETA) were identical in appearance to 
the corresponding active medications and were packaged in the same manner; packaging and labelling 
did not identify whether a package contained active medication or placebo.  
The randomization list was to be secured in a computer file with access restricted to designated 
personnel only, including those responsible for labelling and handling the study medication, until the 
study database was locked and ready to be unblinded.  
Full analysis of the week 24 data was to be performed after all subjects completed week 24 or 
terminated the study.  
The study blind was to be broken for an individual subject only in the case of an emergency when 
knowledge of the assigned treatment was essential for the clinical management of the subject. The 
Investigator could break the blind for a subject by using the IWRS, which permitted immediate 
unblinding. In case of doubt as to whether emergency unblinding was necessary, the Investigator was 
to contact the Sponsor prior to breaking the study blind.  
•  Statistical methods 
Individual active vs placebo efficacy comparisons were conducted at 24 weeks using a 0.0125 
significance level to account for multiplicity of four active treatment groups. The primary endpoint was 
analysed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) tests, with adjustment for the stratification factor of 
race, in order to test the null hypothesis of no treatment effect for each linzagolix group versus 
placebo. Odds ratios were estimated from the CMH test together with the associated 95% CI and 
corresponding p-values. Proportions per treatment arm were displayed with exact Clopper- Pearson 
95% CIs as well as differences in percentages with corresponding 95% Newcombe-Wilson confidence 
intervals. Homogeneity of the odds ratios was confirmed using the Breslow-Day test.  
The ranked secondary endpoints were analysed sequentially in ranked order within each linzagolix 
treatment group. An endpoint was only claimed to be statistically significant if the resulting p- value for 
that endpoint and all endpoints higher up the testing order (for a given treatment arm) were less than 
0.0125. The additional secondary endpoints were tested at the 0.0125 with no further adjustments for 
multiplicity. 
The primary analysis population for the 24-week efficacy analyses was the FAS, defined as follows:  
All randomized subjects who received at least one dose of double-blind study drug, irrespective of the 
treatment received, and who did not fail exclusion criteria 19 or 20 (concerning osteoporosis or other 
metabolic bone disease and liver function test results, respectively) prior to first administration of 
double-blind study drug. Subjects were analysed according to randomized treatment.  
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 63/155 
 
  
 
 
 
For logistical reasons, results of some baseline assessments, including BMD and blood chemistry, were 
available only after Day 1, when subjects had already been randomized and started treatment: the 
baseline DXA scan could be performed up to 10 days after Day 1, and baseline blood samples were 
taken at Day 1 prior to first administration of study drug. Subjects who failed exclusion criteria 19 or 
20 based on assessments performed prior to the first administration of study treatment but who had 
already received study drug were excluded from the FAS but included in the Safety Analysis Set. 
However, subjects who failed these criteria based on assessments performed after Day 1 were not 
excluded from the FAS, so that exclusion would not be due to a post-treatment assessment. 
The primary efficacy analysis used alkaline hematin data only. Two sensitivity analyses on the primary 
endpoint were performed to assess the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis results under 
alternative assumptions for days on which there were no data from the AH method. The first was 
conducted by imputing daily bleeding data based on the eDiary responses for days when no sanitary 
products were returned but bleeding had been reported in the eDiary. The second was performed 
following a request from MEB, the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board, by assigning subjects who 
discontinued early or who did not return any sanitary protection tools and had missing bleeding 
information in the eDiary as non-responders.  
The PRIMROSE 2 52-week efficacy analyses were conducted in the Week 52 FAS population, which 
includes all subjects who continued treatment after week 24. Efficacy was assessed in both the 
individual studies and in pooled analyses of data from both studies. In response to the day 120 
assessment report, 52 week data was submitted for the PRIMROSE 1 study.

•  Conduct of the study 
There were substantial number of protocol amendments for both pivotal trials. Some important 
changes were introduced such as: subjects who were found to fail exclusion criteria 19 (risk of 
osteoporosis, or history of osteoporosis or other metabolic bone disease) or 20 (ALT, AST, GGT, or 
total bilirubin >2 × ULN) were systematically discontinued from the study, as they did not meet the 
study’s eligibility criteria; ECG monitoring was introduced; subjects who were found to be ineligible 
based on BMD z-scores from Day 1 were discontinued from treatment, as were subjects for whom BMD 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 67/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
z-scores from repeat scans at Week 24 were ≤-2.5; subjects were to complete the End of Treatment 
questionnaire. However, those were accepted as not influencing the trials’ outcomes. 
•  Baseline data 
Subjects enrolled in the Phase 3 studies were representative of the target population of adult women 
with uterine fibroids.  
The patient populations differed in terms of some key baseline characteristics as they were 
representative of different geographical areas. PRIMROSE 1 was conducted exclusively in the US; 63% 
of subjects were Black, 33% were White and 4% were ‘other’. PRIMROSE 2 enrolled patients in Europe 
(91%) and the US (9%). Subjects in PRIMROSE 2 were 5% Black and 95% White. Along with the 
substantially higher percentage of Black subjects, the PRIMROSE 1 study population had a higher mean 
weight [±SD] (88.4 kg [±19.5] vs 74.1 kg [±]15.9) and BMI [±SD] (32.7 kg/m2 [±6.9] vs 27.0 
kg/m2 [±5.6]), reflecting current differences between US and European populations. Mean age (±SD) 
was similar in the two trials, and for the pooled population was 42.3 years (±5.6).  
The rate of anaemia at baseline was high in both studies. A higher percentage of PRIMROSE 1 subjects 
were anaemic compared to the PRIMROSE 2 population (Hb<12 g/dL) (74% vs 56%), had moderate to 
severe anaemia (Hb<10 g/dL) (32% vs 18%), and correspondingly a lower mean Hb level (10.7 g/dL 
vs. 11.5 g/dL) despite having a lower mean MBL (198.5 mL vs. 216.5 mL) at baseline compared to 
those in the PRIMROSE 2 study.  
Overall in the two studies, the most common symptoms reported by subjects at baseline were heavy 
menstrual bleeding (97% of subjects), abdominal pain (68%), abdominal pressure (53%), 
menstruation lasting longer than usual (50%), lower back pain (50%), increased urinary frequency 
(35%) and pain during intercourse (28%). Along with higher baseline MBL, uterine/fibroid volume, and 
higher rates of anaemia, the PRIMROSE 1 study population had higher mean pain and UFS-QoL 
severity scores and lower UFS-QoL total health-related quality of life. Approximately 50% of patients 
were potential candidates for surgical intervention, including hysterectomy, if they were not entering a 
clinical trial.  
Overall, taken together, the self-reported symptoms and the baseline characteristics of the combined 
population, including mean age, mean MBL of about 200 mL per cycle, mean total fibroid volume of 50 
to 60 mL, and high rates of anaemia reflect the typical characteristics of patients with symptomatic 
uterine fibroids and is representative of the profile of patients who would be expected to receive the 
treatment when it is marketed. 
•  Numbers analysed 
All analyses were based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which was defined as follows:  
All randomized subjects who received at least one dose of double-blind study drug, irrespective of the 
treatment received, and who did not fail exclusion criteria 19 or 20 (concerning osteoporosis or other 
metabolic bone disease and liver function test results, respectively) prior to first administration of 
double-blind study drug. Subjects were analysed according to randomized treatment.  
For logistical reasons, results of some baseline assessments, including BMD and blood chemistry, were 
available only after Day 1, when subjects had already been randomized and started treatment: the 
baseline DXA scan could be performed up to 10 days after Day 1, and baseline blood samples were 
taken at Day 1 prior to first administration of study drug. Subjects who failed exclusion criteria 19 or 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 68/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
20 based on assessments performed prior to the first administration of study treatment but who had 
already received study drug were excluded from the FAS but included in the Safety Analysis Set.  
•  Outcomes and estimation 
All doses of linzagolix were efficacious in the reduction of HMB in the individual studies. The primary 
efficacy results for PRIMROSE 1 and PRIMROSE 2 and pooled data are displayed for the 100 mg, 200 
mg+ABT and placebo groups in Figure 8 below.  
PRIMROSE 1 responder rates were 35.0%, 56.4%, 66.4%, 71.4% and 75.5% in the placebo, 100 mg, 
100 mg+ABT, 200 mg and 200 mg+ABT groups, respectively, with corresponding odds ratios (95% CI, 
p-value) compared to placebo were 2.43 (1.36; 4.33, p=0.003), 3.81 (2.15; 6.75, p<0.001), 4.65 
(2.58; 8.36, p<0.001), 5.64 (3.09; 10.32, p<0.001).  
Responder rates in PRIMROSE 2 were 29.4%, 56.7%, 77.2%, 77.7% and 93.9% in the placebo, 100 
mg, 100 mg+ ABT, 200 mg and 200 mg+ABT groups, respectively. The corresponding odd ratios (95% 
CI) compared to placebo were 3.14 (1.74; 5.64,), 9.72 (4.97; 18.99), 7.95 (4.29; 14.75), and 35.11 
(14.06; 87.68), respectively (p<0.001 for all comparisons to placebo).  
The responder rates across the two studies were generally similar, with a larger difference between the 
studies for the 200 mg+ABT dose. Indeed, there are differences in the demographics and baseline 
characteristics between the two studies that could potentially have contributed to a difference in 
response; for example, a higher proportion of Black women, higher mean weight and BMI in the 
PRIMROSE 1 population compared to the primarily white population in PRIMROSE 2. Furthermore, 
dropout rates were higher in PRIMROSE 1 compared to PRIMROSE 2, which may have affected the 
responder rate. The potential of different responses by race and in different weight and BMI sub-
populations were explored. Responder rates for Black women were somewhat lower than for non-Black 
women, but still statistically better than placebo; no clear differences were observed for the other 
subgroups. Overall, the similarity of responder rates in the other 4 treatment groups across the two 
studies did not suggest a systematic difference in responder rates between the two study populations.  
Pooled responder rates (95% CI) were 56.5% (49.2; 63.7), 71.6% (65.0; 77.7), 74.5% (68.0; 80.3), 
and 84.5% (78.7; 89.2) in the 100 mg, 100 mg+ABT, 200 mg, and 200 mg+ABT groups respectively, 
compared to 32.2% (25.8; 39.1) in placebo. The corresponding odds ratios (95% CI) compared to 
placebo were 2.75 (1.82; 4.16), 5.69 (3.70; 8.74), 5.99 (3.92; 9.15), and 10.77 (6.66; 17.42), for the 
100 mg, 100 mg+ABT, 200 mg and 200 mg+ABT groups, respectively (p<0.001 for all comparisons to 
placebo).

•  Ancillary analyses 
Comparison of Results in Sub-populations  
Sub-group analyses were performed for primary endpoint of reduced menstrual blood loss on the 
pooled PRIMROSE 1 and 2 population including the following:  
•  By race  
 Black or African American  
•  By weight categories, based on baseline weight quartiles for the pooled Safety Set. 
•  By CDC BMI categories: < 18.5 kg/m2, (18.5 - < 25 kg/m2), (25 - < 30 kg/m2), ≥ 30 kg/m2  
•  By age categories, based on baseline age quartiles for the pooled Safety Set.  
•  By cycle length 
• 
Excessively heavy menstrual bleeding 
•  One or more fibroid with FIGO classification of 0,1 or 2 at baseline 
The responder rates across the two sub-groups in all subpopulations analysed were generally similar, 
except in the 200 mg with ABT arm where the response rate of 74.2% (95% CI 62.0; 84.2) in the 
Black sub-group was somewhat lower than the response rate of 89.6% (83.1; 94.2) observed in the 
non-Black subgroup. This pattern was similar to that observed between the two trials PRIMROSE 1 and 
PRIMROSE 2 reflecting the fact that PRIMROSE 1 included mostly (63%) Black subjects, whereas 
PRIMROSE 2 was almost completely non Black (95%). 
Sensitivity analysis 
The results of sensitivity analyses using imputed alkaline hematin bleeding data for days where there 
was no alkaline haematin bleeding data but the daily eDiary indicated bleeding or heavy bleeding (or 
was not completed) as well as the results of a completer analysis support the finding of significantly 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 70/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reduced menstrual blood loss in each active treatment group compared to placebo. In both studies, for 
subjects who completed the first 24 weeks of treatment, the responder rates were higher than for the 
general population, suggesting that the higher dropout rates in PRIMROSE 1 did affect the primary 
analysis responder rates. These analyses support the finding of significantly reduced menstrual blood 
loss in each active treatment group compared to placebo.  
In both studies, the responder rates were numerically higher in the linzagolix with ABT groups 
compared to the corresponding linzagolix alone groups.  
PRIMROSE  1 and PRIMROSE 2 results at 52 weeks showed sustained reduction in HMB in all active 
treatment groups; the proportions of subjects with reduced MBL was maintained or increased 
compared to week 24. Subjects who switched from placebo to 200 mg+ABT after 24 weeks, had a high 
responder rate consistent with the primary endpoint results at 24 weeks. A PASS (post-authorisation 
safety study) is planned to assess the long-term safety, in particular bone mineral density, in the 
subjects treated.

Ranked Secondary Endpoints  
Results for the ranked secondary endpoints showed statistically significant improvements over placebo 
for all doses in both studies except for improvement in haemoglobin in the 100 mg dose in PRIMROSE 
1.  
Time to reduced MBL  
Total blood loss (mL) was calculated for every 28-day rolling interval from Study Day 1 up to Week 24 
that is, for Day 1 to Day 28, Day 2 to Day 29, Day 3 to Day 30 etc. Time to reduced menstrual blood 
loss was defined as the number of days from Study Day 1 to the first day of the first 28-day period in 
which the definition of reduced MBL (MBL ≤ 80 mL and ≥ 50% reduction from baseline) was reached 
and maintained up to 24 weeks.  
Time to reduced MBL was significantly shorter in all active treatment groups compared to placebo 
(p≤0.002 for all comparisons). In the pooled population, the probability (95% CI) of achieving reduced 
menstrual blood loss by 4 weeks was 0.23 (0.18; 0.30) in the 100 mg group, 0.59 (0.53; 0.66) in the 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 71/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
100 mg with ABT group, 0.58 (0.52; 0.65) in the 200 mg group, and 0.68 (0.62; 0.75) in the 200 mg 
with ABT group, compared to 0.08 (0.05; 0.12) in the placebo group .  
It important to note that the definition of time to reduced MBL for this assessment included not only 
reaching reduced MBL but also maintaining it up to 24 weeks. Moreover, the assessment was 
performed in rolling 28-day intervals (Day 1 to Day 28, Day 2 to Day 29, Day 3 to Day 30 etc.) up to 
Day 168, (~140 times) for each treatment group. With this approach, patients who had reduced MBL 
but were not amenorrhoeic were likely to have a subsequent 28-day period in which MBL was not 
reduced, particularly at the earlier timepoints; therefore, the analysis of menstrual blood loss over 
each (non-overlapping) 28-day period and the percentage of subjects achieving reduced MBL for these 
28-day periods may be more informative on actual time course to reduced menstrual blood loss.  
The percentage of subjects achieving reduced menstrual blood loss was assessed for each 28-day 
period from Day 1 to Week 24, namely Day 1 to Day 28, Day 29 to Day 56 etc. The results are 
presented by study in Figure 10. In the first 28-day period, 62% (95%CI 51; 72) and 56% (95% CI 
46; 67) in the 100 mg group had achieved reduced MBL in PRIMROSE 1 and 2, respectively; this was 
maintained up to Week 24. In the other treatment arms, these percentages were 56% (45; 66)/47% 
(37; 58) for 100 mg with ABT, 61% (51; 71)/61% (51; 71) for 200 mg, 53% (43; 63)/63% (53; 73) 
for 200 mg with ABT, and 28% (19; 38)/21% (14; 30) for placebo in PRIMROSE 1 and 2. These 
percentages increased to 80% and 90% in the second 28-day period for PRIMROSE 1 and 2, 
respectively, and were maintained up to Week 24.

interval; LGX= Linzagolix 
Actual menstrual blood loss was also assessed for each 28-day period up to Week 24 for both studies. 
The mean ± SD MBL was 199 ± 114 mL per cycle in PRIMROSE 1 and 217 ± 135 mL per cycle in 
PRIMROSE 2. In the 100 mg group, the mean percentage decrease in MBL was about 60% for the first 
28 days and this change was maintained until Week 24. In the other linzagolix treatment groups, the 
mean percentage decrease in MBL was between 45 and 70% for the first 28 days, increasing 
substantially to 80-94% by Week 8, and maintained up to Week 24.  
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 72/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Reductions in MBL were maintained up to 52 weeks in all active treatment arms, and subjects who 
switched from placebo to 200 mg+ABT had a similar mean change from baseline MBL as subjects who 
were on this dose from Day 1. 
Amenorrhea and Time to Amenorrhea 
In both studies, rates of amenorrhea were significantly higher in the active treatment arms compared 
to placebo, with the highest rates observed in the 200 mg dose arms. This dose-response is consistent 
with the observed dose-response for reduced MBL as well as the differences in E2 suppression between 
the doses.  
Analysis of the pooled PRIMROSE 1 and 2 data showed a significant proportion of subjects with 
amenorrhea in all active treatment groups compared to placebo (p<0.001). The proportions (95% CI) 
of subjects with amenorrhea were 36.1% (29.3; 43.4), 52.4% (45.4; 59.4), 65.4% (58.5; 71.8) and 
69.0% (62.1; 75.3) in the 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT, 200 mg and 200 mg with ABT groups 
respectively, compared to 16.6% (11.8; 22.4) in placebo. The rates of amenorrhea in the different 
treatment groups were generally similar between the 2 studies with some variability between studies 
but no consistent trend of higher amenorrhea rates in one study compared to the other. There was no 
consistent effect of ABT on amenorrhea rates.  
Time to amenorrhea was defined as the number of days from Study Day 1 to the first day for which 
the subject did not have bleeding (based on the alkaline haematin method) for at least 35 days and 
without showing bleeding after this period of 35 days up to the time point for analysis. As with time to 
reduced MBL, time to amenorrhea was significantly shorter in all active treatment arms compared to 
placebo (p≤0.008 for all comparisons).  
In the pooled population, the probability (95% CI) of achieving amenorrhea by 4 weeks was 0.15 
(0.10; 0.21) in the 100 mg group, 0.31 (0.25; 0.38) in the 100 mg with ABT group, 0.49 (0.43; 0.56) 
in the 200 mg group, and 0.48 (0.41; 0.55) in the 200 mg with ABT group, compared to 0.04 (0.02; 
0.08) in the placebo group (Table 2.7.3-12).  
The percentage of women with amenorrhea was maintained or increased in all active treatment groups 
at Week 52 compared to Week 24. In women who switched from placebo to 200 mg+ABT after 24 
weeks, 79% (74; 90) were amenorrhoeic at Week 52, consistent with the results at Week 24 and 
supporting the high efficacy of the 200 mg dose in inducing amenorrhea in women with HMB due to 
uterine fibroids. 
Number of Days of Uterine Bleeding  
The number of days of uterine bleeding (assessed by the Alkaline Hematin method) was summarized 
for the last 28 days prior to Week 24. There were significant reductions compared to placebo in the 
mean number of days of uterine bleeding in all active treatment groups (p≤0.001 for individual and 
pooled analyses). Compared to placebo, there were fewer subjects with 1-5 or > 5 days of uterine 
bleeding in all treatment groups, with the greatest reductions in the 200 mg and 200 mg with ABT 
groups.

Haemoglobin Levels in Anaemic Subjects  
Changes in haemoglobin levels in a subset of anaemic subjects (baseline Hb < 12 g/dL) were assessed. 
Following 24 weeks of treatment with linzagolix, there was significant improvement compared to 
placebo in Hb levels by Week 24 (p<0.001) in all treatment groups in both studies except for the 100 
mg group in PRIMROSE 1 (p=0.019). In the pooled analysis, all active treatment groups were 
significantly improved compared to placebo (p≤0.002). The effect was more pronounced with both of 
the 200 mg doses (with and without ABT).  
At Week 52, increased Hb levels were maintained or further increased compared to Week 24), 
supporting the durability of the treatment effect of linzagolix in improving anaemia in women with HMB 
due to uterine fibroids.

Additional Secondary Endpoints  
Additional secondary endpoints, including reduction in pain, reduction in uterine volume, reduction in 
fibroid volume, and improvement in quality of life (QoL) were assessed, and further support the 
efficacy of linzagolix across a range of clinically relevant endpoints for women who may seek medical 
treatment for uterine fibroids. 
Pain  
Overall, the results of PRIMROSE 1 and 2 demonstrate that at both the 100 mg and 200 mg doses, 
linzagolix significantly decreases pain due to uterine fibroids, with the largest effects in the 200 mg 
doses, with and without hormonal ABT.  
The overall mean ± SD baseline score in the pooled population was 5.7 ± 2.8 (0-10 numeric rating 
scale). At 24 weeks, there were significant reductions in pain scores in all linzagolix groups compared 
to placebo (p≤0.002) in both studies and in the pooled population. The proportions of patients with a 
baseline score of at least 4 (moderate to severe pain) who had a score of 0 or 1 (none to very mild 
pain) at Week 24 were assessed based on Dworkin’s recommendation that an assessment of chronic 
pain typically requires a minimum of 4 on a numeric rating scale (Dworkin, 2010). At Week 24 the 
proportions were similar across both trials and showed significant differences versus placebo (p<0.001 
for all comparisons in the pooled population). 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 75/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Analysis of pain scores as categorical changes (Categories: None – 0, Mild – 1 to 3, Moderate – 4 to 6, 
Severe – 7 to 10) also showed similar proportions of subjects across both studies who had a decrease 
of at least 1 category or at least 2 categories at Week 24, and showed significant differences versus 
placebo. In the pooled population, 61.8% (95% CI 53.6; 69.6) of subjects in the 100 mg group, 
62.1% (54.1; 69.6) in the 100 mg with ABT group, 77.5% (70.2; 83.7) in the 200 mg group, and 
68.0% (59.8; 75.5) in the 200 mg with ABT group had decreased pain by 1 or more categories, 
compared to 36.7% (29.2; 44.7) in the placebo group. Similarly, the proportions of subjects with a 
decrease of 2 or more categories in the pooled population were 29.0% (21.4; 37.6) in the 100 mg 
group, 36.7% (28.7; 45.3) in the 100 mg with ABT group, 53.0% (44.2; 61.8) in the 200 mg group, 
and 46.2% (37.0; 55.6) in the 200 mg with ABT group, versus 12.0% (6.9; 19.0) in the placebo 
group.  
Supporting the durability of the efficacy of linzagolix in reducing pain, reductions in pain were 
maintained up to Week 52 of treatment. Subjects who switched to 200 mg+ABT from placebo showed 
similar reductions in pain as observed in subjects receiving this dose in the first treatment period. 
Uterine and Fibroid Volume  
Overall, the uterine and fibroid volume changes observed across the PRIMROSE trials demonstrate that 
the 200 mg dose of linzagolix results in significant and clinically relevant reductions in uterine and 
fibroid volume.  
The median (Q1, Q3) baseline uterine volume in the pooled population was 241 mL (160; 396). Median 
uterine volume was higher in PRIMROSE 1 (297 mL [192; 496]) compared to PRIMROSE 2 (203 mL 
[139; 308]). Median baseline fibroid volume in the pooled population was 53 mL (22; 128) and was 
also higher in PRIMROSE 1 (60 mL [21; 140]) compared to PRIMROSE 2 (50 mL [23; 114]).  
Marked and consistent reductions in uterine and fibroid volume were observed in the 200 mg dose 
arms of both studies, with approximately 40% reduction in uterine volume and 48% reduction in 
fibroid volume in the pooled population compared to no change in either endpoint in the placebo arm. 
Smaller reductions in uterine volume of approximately 15% were seen in the 200 mg with ABT and 
100 mg arms, with no meaningful changes in the 100 mg with ABT. Reductions in fibroid volume of 
approximately 35%, 15% and 22% were observed in the 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT, and the 200 mg 
with ABT groups. In PRIMROSE 2, between 24 and 52 weeks of treatment, no additional reductions in 
uterine or fibroid volume were observed. Notably, following the switch from 200 mg to 200 mg+ABT, 
subjects experienced a lessening in the treatment effect, however both uterine and fibroid volumes 
remained lower than baseline. 
Quality of Life  
As described earlier, women with uterine fibroids describe substantial negative impact on many aspects 
of quality of life including sexual function. Taken together, the results from PRIMROSE 1 and 2 show 
that treatment with linzagolix results in meaningful improvements in quality of life in a typical 
population of women with uterine fibroids.  
UFS-QoL: HRQL, Symptom Severity, Domain Scores and Sexual Function  
The mean ± SD baseline HRQL total and symptom severity scores were 40.3 ± 21.8 and 57.7 ± 19.6, 
respectively in the pooled population. There were marked increases at 24 weeks in the HRQL scores 
and decreases in the symptom severity scores in the linzagolix groups compared to placebo in both 
studies which were maintained at 52 weeks in the PRIMROSE 2 population, demonstrating that all 
linzagolix dose groups significantly improved quality of life and reduced symptom severity in women 
with uterine fibroids compared to placebo.  
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 76/155 
 
  
 
 
All 6 sub-domains of the UFS-QoL (Concern, Activities, Energy/mood, Control, Self-consciousness, 
Sexual function) showed greater increases compared to placebo in all linzagolix treatment groups. 
These increases were most pronounced in the concern and activities domains and tended to be higher 
in the 200 mg and 200 mg+ABT groups.  
The mean ± SD baseline sexual function domain score was 45.8 ± 29.6 in the pooled population. 
There were moderate increases (improvements) in this score in the linzagolix groups compared to 
placebo in both studies, which were more pronounced in the 200 mg and 200 mg with ABT groups. 
Estimated mean (95% CI, p value) differences from placebo were 5.6 (-1.0; 12.2, p=0.096) with 100 
mg, 1.1 (-5.4; 7.6, p=0.740) with 100 mg+ABT, 9.7 (3.2; 16.1, p=0.003) with 200 mg, and 8.3 (1.9; 
14.8, p=0.012) with 200 mg+ABT. Importantly, these effects were maintained at 52 weeks. 
PGI-I  
The PGI-I was completed by subjects at Week 24. The proportion of subjects reporting their menstrual 
bleeding status as “much better” or “very much better” was substantially higher in linzagolix groups 
compared to placebo in both studies.  
In PRIMROSE 1, the proportion of subjects reporting being “much better” or “very much better” was 
50.8% in the 100 mg group, 72.6% in the 100 mg with ABT group, 77.9% in the 200 mg group, 
75.8% in the 200 mg with ABT group compared to 29% in placebo. The corresponding odds-ratios 
were all greater than 1 with p<0.001 for all comparisons except the 100 mg dose (p=0.011). In 
PRIMROSE 2, the proportion of subjects reporting being much better or very much better was 48.7% 
in the 100 mg group, 73.5% in the 100 mg with ABT group, 75% in the 200 mg group, 86.4% in the 
200 mg with ABT group compared to 33.3% in placebo. The corresponding odds-ratios were all greater 
than 1 with p<0.001 for all comparisons, except 100 mg (p=0.047). 
EQ-5D-5L  
For each dimension, of the EQ-5D-5L, patients rated the difficulty of accomplishing tasks in that 
dimension according to 5 levels of difficulty (from 1 to 5). An index score based on the individual 
dimensions was calculated. The results were also tabulated by response level for each individual 
dimension (level 1 to level 5) for each visit. The VAS score was summarized in terms of actual value 
and change from baseline at each visit and was displayed over time in a figure for the FAS. At Week 
24, there were small increases in the EQ-5D-5L index values and the VAS score in all groups including 
placebo. There were no noticeable differences between linzagolix groups and placebo.

The primary analysis set was the Full Analysis Set (FAS), defined as all 
randomized subjects who received at least one dose of double-blind study drug, 
irrespective of the treatment received, and who did not fail exclusion criteria 19 
or 20 (concerning osteoporosis or other metabolic bone disease and liver 
function test results, respectively) prior to first administration of double-blind 
study drug. Subjects were analysed according to randomized treatment.

 Clinical studies in special populations 
Linzagolix is highly plasma protein bound (>99%, mostly to albumin) leading to a low volume of 
distribution. It is the predominant component in plasma; all plasma metabolites were present at less 
than 10% of the total drug related exposure. Unchanged linzagolix was also a major component in 
urine and faeces, and was eliminated in urine (52%) and, to a lesser extent, in faeces (39%) . Intrinsic 
factors (e.g., age or race) have not been shown to impact the PK profile of linzagolix. Administration of 
linzagolix is not recommended for women with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) since 2- to 3-
fold unbound mean exposures can occur in these subjects.  
Yselty should be avoided in women with moderate (eGFR = 30
59 mL/min), severe renal impairment 
(eGFR < 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease, see Clinical Pharmacology Section.  
‐
There were no studies in older women as after the menopause menstruation stops. There were no 
studies in children as the Applicant got an exemption from the PDCO. The pharmacokinetics of 
Linzagolix are further discussed in the PK section of this report. 
 In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy 
Not applicable. 
 Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The pooled analysis was done according to a statistical analysis plan written after the 24-week results 
from PRIMROSE 1 and 2 were available. This summary includes up to 24 weeks of treatment for 
PRIMROSE 1 and 2 and 52 weeks of treatment for PRIMROSE 2.  
The pooled results confirmed a significant reduction in the proportion of subjects with reduced HMB in 
all active treatment groups compared to placebo (p<0.001). The proportions (95% CI) of subjects with 
reduced HMB were 56.5% (49.2; 63.7), 71.6% (65.0; 77.7), 74.5% (68.0; 80.3) and 84.5% (78.7; 
89.2) in the 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT, 200 mg and 200 mg with ABT groups respectively, compared 
to 32.2% (25.9; 39.1) in placebo (Table 14).  
In both studies, the observed response rates in the 200 mg without ABT groups were consistently 
higher than the 100 mg without ABT groups. Overall (in the pooled population), the response rate was 
74.5% (95% CI 68.0; 80.3) with 200 mg compared to 56.5% (95% CI 49.2; 63.7) with 100 mg. 
Overall (in the pooled population), the response rate was 74.5% (95% CI 68.0; 80.3) with 200 mg 
compared to 56.5% (95% CI 49.2; 63.7) with 100 mg. This dose response is consistent with the 
observed difference in E2 suppression between the doses and with the dose-response observed for 
suppression of menstruation in Japanese patients   
Also, for both 100 and 200 mg doses, there was no evidence that concomitant ABT decreased efficacy. 
In both studies, the response rates were numerically higher in the linzagolix with ABT groups 
compared to the corresponding linzagolix alone groups. In the pooled population, the response rate 
(95% CI) was 56.5% (49.2; 63.7) in the 100 mg group compared to 71.6% (65.0; 77.7) in the 100 
mg with ABT group. Similarly, the response rate in the 200 mg group was 74.5% (68.0; 80.3) 
compared to 84.5% (78.7; 89.2) in the 200 mg with ABT group. This is an interesting observation 
because the administration of E2/NETA ABT increases serum oestradiol levels, especially with the 200 
mg linzagolix dose and this might be expected to counteract the efficacy of linzagolix to reduce heavy 
menstrual bleeding to some extent. However, these data do not suggest such an effect. This may in 
part be due to a stabilizing effect of NETA.

In the pooled population, the probability (95% CI) of achieving reduced menstrual blood loss by 4 
weeks was 0.23 (0.18; 0.30) in the 100 mg group, 0.59 (0.52; 0.65) in the 100 mg with ABT group, 
0.58 (0.52; 0.65) in the 200 mg group, and 0.68 (0.62; 0.75) in the 200 mg with ABT group, 
compared to 0.08 (0.05; 0.12) in the placebo group . 
In the pooled population, the probability (95% CI) of achieving amenorrhea by 4 weeks was 0.15 
(0.10; 0.21) in the 100 mg group, 0.31 (0.25; 0.38) in the 100 mg with ABT group, 0.49 (0.43; 0.56) 
in the 200 mg group, and 0.48 (0.41; 0.55) in the 200 mg with ABT group, compared to 0.04 (0.02; 
0.08) in the placebo group. 
In the pooled PRIMROSE 1 and 2 population, there was a significant reduction in the mean number of 
days of bleeding in all active treatment groups compared to placebo (p≤0.001). The mean number of 
days of bleeding were 2.3, 1.9, 1.1 and 1.5 days in the 100 mg. 100 mg with ABT, 200 mg and 200 
mg with ABT groups respectively, compared to 3.8 days in placebo. Compared to placebo, there were 
fewer subjects with 1-5 or > 5 days of uterine bleeding in all treatment groups with the greatest 
reductions in the 200 mg and 200 mg with ABT groups. Analysis of the pooled PRIMROSE 1 and 2 data 
confirmed a significant increase proportion of subjects with amenorrhea in all active treatment groups 
compared to placebo (p<0.001). The proportions (95% CI) of subjects with amenorrhea were 36.1% 
(29.3; 43.4), 52.4% (45.4; 59.4), 65.4% (58.5; 71.8) and 69.0% (62.1; 75.3) in the 100 mg, 100 mg 
with ABT, 200 mg and 200 mg with ABT groups respectively, compared to 16.6% (11.8; 22.4) in 
placebo .  
In both studies, the observed rates of amenorrhea were consistently higher in the 200 mg without ABT 
groups compared to the 100 mg without ABT groups. In the pooled population, the amenorrhea rate 
was 65.4% (95% CI 58.5; 71.8) with 200 mg compared to 36.1% (95% CI 29.3; 43.4) with 100 mg. 
In the pooled population, the probability (95% CI) of achieving amenorrhea by 4 weeks was 0.15 
(0.10; 0.21) in the 100 mg group, 0.31 (0.25; 0.38) in the 100 mg with ABT group, 0.49 (0.43; 
0.56)in the 200 mg group, and 0.48 (0.41; 0.55) in the 200 mg with ABT group, compared to 0.04 
(0.02; 0.08) in the placebo group.

Persistence of Efficacy and/or Tolerance Effects  
The persistence of efficacy was assessed in PRIMROSE 1 and PRIMROSE 2 in subjects who continued 
treatment after 24 weeks up to 52 weeks of treatment. Persistence of efficacy could be directly 
assessed in the 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT and 200 mg with ABT groups as these subjects continued on 
the same dose between 24 and 52 weeks. Results from the group who started on placebo or 200 mg 
daily for 24 weeks and then changed to 200 mg with ABT daily from 24 to 52 weeks are also included 
for information.  Post-24-week data is presented below for the W52 FAS, which includes all subjects 
who continued treatment after Week 24. Of the 501 subjects included in the FAS, 424 (84.6%), 
completed week 24, 419 (83.6%) continued treatment and were included in the W52 FAS and 337 
(67.3%) completed the study up to Week 52. The baseline characteristics of the W52 FAS were very 
similar to the FAS.

Reduced menstrual blood loss at 52 weeks  
The proportion of subjects with reduced menstrual blood loss was maintained or increased at Week 52 
compared to Week 24. At Week 52 the proportion (95% CI) of subjects with reduced menstrual blood 
loss was 53% (42; 65), 91% (83; 96) and 92% (83; 97) in the 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT and 200 mg 
with ABT groups respectively. In the subjects who switched from 200 mg to 200 mg + ABT at 24 
weeks, the proportion of subjects with reduced MBL was also maintained; 85% (76; 92) at Week 52 
compared to 78% (68; 85) at Week 24 (Figure 2.7.3-18). In the subjects who switched from placebo 
to 200 mg with ABT at 24 weeks, the proportion (95% CI) of subjects with reduced MBL was 83% (74; 
90) at Week 52.

Amenorrhea  
The proportion of subjects with amenorrhea was maintained or increased at Week 52 compared to 
Week 24 (section 2.7.3.3.3.3). At Week 52, the proportion (95% CI) of subjects with amenorrhea was 
43% (32; 55), 83% (72; 90) and 87% (78; 93) in the 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT and 200 mg with ABT 
groups respectively. In the subjects who switched from 200 mg to 200 mg + ABT at 24 weeks, the 
proportion of subjects with amenorrhea was also maintained; 78% (68; 87) at Week 52 compared to 
71% (61; 79) at Week 24.  
In the subjects who switched from placebo to 200 mg with ABT at 24 weeks, the proportion of subjects 
with amenorrhea increased to 79% (69; 87). This is consistent with the proportion of 81% (71; 88) 
observed at 24 weeks for subjects randomized to 200 mg with ABT. 
Mean menstrual blood loss over time  
The reductions in menstrual blood loss observed at 24 weeks were maintained up to 52 weeks in 
subjects who continued treatment after 24 weeks in the 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT and 200 mg with 
ABT groups as well as the 200 mg group who switched to 200 mg with ABT at 24 weeks .  In the 
subjects who switched from placebo to 200 mg with ABT at 24 weeks, MBL decreased by about 200 mL 
from baseline, similar to the decrease observed in the subjects who continued on 200 mg + ABT from 
the beginning. 
Pain scores  
Pain scores were reduced by Week 12 and this reduction was maintained through to Week 52. As 
expected, pain scores at 36 and 52 weeks also decreased in the placebo subjects switching to 200 mg 
with ABT after Week 24. 
Uterine volume  
Mean uterine volumes were only markedly decreased at 24 weeks in the 200 mg without ABT group 
(see section 2.7.3.3.3.9). This effect was reduced after 24 weeks after the switch to 200 mg with ABT 
but mean uterine volume did not return to baseline. 
Fibroid volume  
As with uterine volume, there was good evidence of reduced fibroid volume at 24 weeks with the 200 
mg group compared to placebo but not with the other linzagolix groups.  
At 52 weeks, there was no evidence of any further change in the 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT or 200 mg 
with ABT groups. With the 200 mg group that switched to 200 mg with ABT there was also no clear 
evidence of any further change, but mean fibroid volume remained lower than baseline. 
UFS-QoL Symptom Severity  
Improvements in UFS-QoL symptom severity score observed at 24 weeks were maintained at 52 
weeks in the 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT, 200 mg with ABT as well as the 200 mg group who switched 
to 200 mg with ABT after 24 weeks. In subjects who switched from placebo to 200 mg with ABT at 24 
weeks there was a marked improvement by 52 weeks similar to that observed in the subjects who 
continued on 200 mg with ABT from Day 1 until 52 weeks. 
PRIMROSE 2 study Z-scores at Week 52 
Baseline Z-scores for BMD were generally comparable across treatment groups in the Week 52 Safety 
Analysis Set and median baseline z scores were >0 in all treatment groups. 
At Week 52, the 200 mg/200 mg+ABT group showed less CfB than at Week 24, while the groups 
continuing the same treatment after Week 24 showed slowing of BMD changes. Despite the observed 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 98/155 
 
  
 
 
decreases, median BMD Z-scores at Week 52 were >0 in all treatment groups, ranging from 0.10 to 
0.45 for the lumbar spine, from 0.50 to 0.70 for the total hip, and from 0.10 to 0.40 for the femoral 
neck. As at earlier time points, some individual low values were observed at Week 52. Minima were 
below -2.0 for the 100 mg, 200 mg/200 mg+ABT, and 200 mg+ABT groups for the lumbar spine (-2.4, 
-2.2, and -2.5 respectively; minima were -1.5 for placebo/200 mg+ABT and -1.0 for 100 mg+ABT); 
for the total hip and the femoral neck, minima were above -2.0 in all treatment groups. 
 Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The product was initially developed for the treatment of endometriosis and the dose finding study was 
conducted in this population. A suppressive effect on pituitary gonadotrophins LH & FSH was 
demonstrated with a resultant reduction in estradiol levels. Based on the PK/PD results of the study, 
doses of 50mg to 200mg were further investigated in study KLH1202. There were 107 women in the 
dose finding study of which 51 had fibroids with 20 of them having fibroids of greater than 2 cm in 
size. Women with fibroids of greater than 2cm were included in the phase 3 pivotal trials. 
The doses chosen for phase 3 were appropriate based on the data from the PK/PD studies and this 
dose finding study in Japanese women with endometriosis. They showed 100% & 50% amenorrhea in 
subjects treated with 200mg & 100mg respectively and a decrease in uterine volume.  However, there 
were several limitations to the dose finding study. There was a limited population of only 51 subjects 
with approximately 10 subjects in each dose group. The analysis was a retrospective sub-group 
analysis. All subjects were Japanese, had a normal BMI or low weight and had co-existent 
endometriosis not reflecting the subjects treated in the pivotal trial or the target population of women 
with uterine fibroids presenting for treatment in Europe. Subjects were allowed to take non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory analgesics during the dose finding and pivotal studies, but it was demonstrated that 
NSAID use did not impact the primary efficacy endpoint.  
Both pivotal trials were double blind randomised controlled trials. Both trials were superiority trials 
where placebo was used as a comparator which is appropriate, as there are no medications approved 
for this indication in Europe. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical for both trials. The trial 
design is considered appropriate.  
One trial was conducted in the United States, the other in Europe with some sites in the United States. 
The population of both trials differed. For the trial conducted in the USA, there were more black 
subjects with a higher mean BMI included than there were for the European study. The population for 
treatment is premenopausal women with heavy menstrual flow and uterine fibroids of at least 2cm but 
no larger than 12 cm. Larger fibroids were excluded as they are mainly treated surgically. Subjects 
with subserosal fibroids were excluded as they are not associated with menorrhagia.  
Women with regular menstrual cycles and heavy menstrual flow/menorrhagia were included (defined 
as >/= 80ml per cycle for 2 cycles measured by the alkaline hematin method). This is the accepted & 
appropriate definition of heavy menstrual loss. A menstrual blood loss (MBL)of 80mls or more is 
accepted as excessive heavy menstrual loss that requires treatment. A reduction of 50% or more in 
MBL from baseline menstrual loss is considered a significant improvement in MBL. The primary and 
ranked secondary endpoints are powered, the additional endpoints are exploratory. The chosen 
endpoints were appropriate. Hormonal contraception was not allowed, but subjects used non-hormonal 
contraception. Women will still need to use effective contraception whilst on treatment.  
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 99/155 
 
  
 
 
 
The Applicant has updated sections 4.4. and 4.6 of the SmPC to advise that Yselty does not provide 
contraception and that effective non-hormonal contraception should be used whilst on treatment. 
The alkaline hematin method to measure MBL is recognized as the most objective technique with which 
to measure MBL. 
The primary endpoint was measured at 24 weeks and subjects continued treatment to 52 weeks. More 
data submitted during assessment supported the findings in the pivotal trial and provides follow-up 
BMD data to week 76.  
The majority of subjects screened in both the USA & the EU did not satisfy the criteria for 
randomisation, but it was clarified that the strict inclusion criteria was to ensure a homogenous trial 
population. In the USA trial (008), one hundred and sixty-five (32.3%) subjects in the FAS 
discontinued treatment. The withdrawal rate was much lower for the European trial 15.4 % compared 
to the USA trial. Details of the reasons for withdrawal from the clinical trials and dropout rates were 
provided. Details of the adverse reactions reported in the placebo group which led to withdrawal were 
also provided. For more information on the breakdown of reasons for subjects discontinuing treatment, 
see Safety Section 2.6.8.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Primary endpoints 
In PRIMROSE 1 USA trial, the proportions (95% CI) of subjects who met the requirements of the 
primary efficacy endpoints were 56.4% (45.8; 66.6), 66.4% (56.6; 75.2), 71.4% (61.8; 79.8) and 
75.5% (66.0; 83.5) in the 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT, 200 mg, and 200 mg with ABT groups, 
respectively, compared to 35.0% (25.8; 45.0) in placebo. All subjects achieved a decrease in 
menstrual loss over 2 cycles and a reduction of MBL of at least 50% over baseline. 
In the Primrose 1 trial compared to placebo the percentage of additional subjects who responded to 
treatment was 21.4%, 32.3%, 36.4% & 40.5% treated with 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT, 200 mg, and 
200 mg with ABT groups, respectively. For the 100mg dose the lower boundary of the 95% CI overlaps 
with the upper boundary of the 95% CI for the placebo group.  
The highest percentage of responders was achieved in subjects treated with 200mg plus ABT. 
In the Primrose 2 mainly EU trial, the proportions (95% CI) of subjects with reduced HMB were 56.7% 
(46.3; 66.7), 77.2% (67.8; 85.0), 77.7% (68.4; 85.3) and 93.9% (87.1; 97.7) in the 100 mg, 100 mg 
with ABT, 200 mg, and 200 mg with ABT groups respectively, compared to 29.4% (20.8; 39.3) with 
placebo. 
In the Primrose 2 trial compared to placebo the percentage of additional subjects who responded to 
treatment was 27.3 %, 47.8%, 48.3%, 64.5% treated with 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT, 200 mg, and 
200 mg with ABT groups, respectively.   
There were 2 sensitivity analysis conducted using imputed alkaline hematin bleeding data based on 
eDiary and the other imputing non-responders for early discontinuers and subjects without bleeding 
data.  
These analyses confirmed the primary analysis finding of significantly reduced menstrual blood loss in 
each active treatment group compared to placebo. 
The responder rates across the two studies were generally similar, except in the 200 mg with ABT arm 
where the response rate of 93.9% (95% CI 87.1; 97.7) in PRIMROSE 2 was somewhat higher than the 
response rate 75.5% (95% CI 66.0; 83.5) observed in PRIMROSE 1. There are some differences in the 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 100/155 
 
  
 
 
 
baseline characteristics between the two studies, sub-group analysis of race confirmed a difference in 
response between Black and non-Black subjects.  
Median absolute changes from baseline in Z-scores for the lumbar spine at week 24 were -0.20 for 100 
mg, -0.20 for 100 mg+ABT, -0.40 for 200 mg, and -0.10 for 200 mg+ABT versus 0.00 for placebo. For 
the total hip, median changes from baseline were -0.10 for 200 mg and 0.00 for all other groups, and 
for the femoral neck, median changes were -0.20 for 200 mg, -0.10 for 100 mg and 200 mg+ABT 
groups, and 0.00 for placebo and 100 mg+ABT groups. 
Median BMD Z-scores at Week 24 remained ≥0, with the exception of a median of -0.10 in the 200 mg 
group for the lumbar spine: medians at Week 24 ranged from -0.10 to 0.45 for the lumbar spine, from 
0.40 to 0.70 for the total hip, and from 0.0 to 0.40 for the femoral neck. 
In PRIMROSE 1, the mean (lower 95% CI) % CfB in the lumbar spine was -2.0% (-3.3%) in the 100 
mg arm and -3.2% (-3.9%) in 200 mg. The addition of ABT mitigated these losses: mean (lower 95% 
CI) % CfB was -1.2% (-2.4%) for 100 mg+ABT- and -0.8% (-1.6%) for 200 mg+ABT. In PRIMROSE 2 
trial in the linzagolix groups without ABT, mean (lower 95% CI) % CfB in the lumbar spine was -2.1% 
(-2.6%) for 100 mg and -4.0% (-4.7%) for 200 mg. The addition of ABT mitigated these decreases, 
with mean (lower 95% CI) % CfB of -1.0% (-1.6%) for 100 mg+ABT and -1.4% (-2.0%) for 200 
mg+ABT. 
Subjects were excluded or withdrawn from the pivotal clinical trial if their BMD was decreased. The 
proposed posology allows treatment with 200mg alone regardless of the subject’s baseline BMD or risk 
factors for reduced BMD. Patients with low BMD or risk factors for reduced BMD were not advised to 
use ABT with treatment. Clarification was sought whether a BMD measurement is required after 6 
months in high risk subjects treated with 200mg without ABT. After provision of the outstanding data 
up to week 72 after treatment, the product information has been updated to recommend BMD 
measurement: annually (Yselty 100 mg) and frequency determined by the treating physician based on 
the woman’s individual risk and previous BMD assessment (Yselty 100 mg with concomitant ABT and 
Yselty 200 mg with concomitant ABT). 
The posology was updated in section 4.2 of the SmPC where 200mg plus ABT is the starting dose 
except in patients where ABT is contraindicated or where the patient does not want to take ABT. In this 
case, a dose of 100mg without ABT can be used. A dose of 100mg can also be used, with concomitant 
ABT. A dose of 200mg may be used for certain clinical indications e.g. when a reduction in fibroid 
size/volume for a limited period of no longer than 6 months is clinically indicated.  
The proportion of subjects with reduced menstrual blood loss was maintained or increased at Week 52 
compared to Week 24. At Week 52 the proportion (95% CI) of subjects with reduced menstrual blood 
loss was 53% (42; 65), 91% (83; 96) and 92% (83; 97) in the 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT and 200 mg 
with ABT groups respectively. In the subjects who switched from 200 mg to 200 mg + ABT at 24 
weeks, the proportion of subjects with reduced MBL was also maintained; 85% (76; 92) at Week 52 
compared to 78% (68; 85) at Week 24. In the subjects who switched from placebo to 200 mg with 
ABT at 24 weeks, the proportion (95% CI) of subjects with reduced MBL was 83% (74; 90) at Week 
52.  
Secondary endpoints 
The ranked secondary endpoints were supportive of the primary endpoint. Similar results for reduction 
in bleeding days, achievement of amenorrhoea, improvement in quality of life, reduction in pain and 
increase in haemoglobin was achieved in subjects treated with 100mg plus ABT, 200mg and 200mg 
plus ABT.  
EMA/266814/2022

Improvement in time to achievement of reduced menstrual loss, percentage of subjects who achieved 
amenorrhoea, reduction in number of days of menstrual bleeding was less in subjects treated with 
100mg. But results were consistent across both pivotal trials at this dose. There was no improvement 
in haemoglobin level in anaemic patients compared to placebo by 24 weeks in subjects treated with 
100mg, 
Pain and quality of life improved at all doses. Fibroid volume and uterine volume were reduced 
markedly and consistently in subjects treated with 200mg. 
 Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
This GNRH antagonist was developed for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with 
uterine fibroids. Two phase 3 double blind randomised placebo-controlled trials of over 1,000 subjects 
were submitted in support of the indication. Two doses were explored in the pivotal trials 100mg and 
200mg with and without hormonal add back hormonal therapy (ABT). All doses met the primary 
efficacy endpoint where a responder was defined as a woman who achieved a reduction in monthly 
menstrual blood loss (MBL) to less than 80ml and a 50% reduction in MBL from baseline. The 100mg 
dose is recommended for women who do not want or cannot take hormonal add back therapy. The 
responder rate was highest in the 200mg plus ABT group. Response was similar in subjects treated 
with 200mg and this dose achieved a higher reduction in fibroid size. However, reduction in bone 
mineral density was highest in the group treated with 200mg alone. Responder rate was also higher 
compared to placebo in women treated with 100mg plus ABT than in patients treated with 100mg 
alone. Data to week 52 also indicate a greater response in subjects treated with 100mg plus ABT & 
200mg plus ABT.  
The starting dose should be 200mg plus ABT, or 100mg plus ABT, 100mg could be used in women with 
a contraindication to or who are unwilling to take ABT. Two hundred milligrams may be used for up to 
6 months in clinical situations a reduction in fibroid size is indicated.  
If long term treatment with 100mg linzagolix is to be considered, patients should have BMD 
measurement after 12 months. Thereafter, depending on the prescribed dose of Yselty, BMD 
assessment is recommended annually (Yselty 100 mg) or at a frequency determined by the treating 
physician based on the woman’s individual risk and previous BMD assessment (Yselty 100 mg with 
concomitant ABT and Yselty 200 mg with concomitant ABT). The SmPC was updated taking in 
consideration the clinical efficacy results. 
 Clinical safety 
 Patient exposure 
2194 subjects have been exposed to different daily doses of linzagolix (12.5 mg- 700 mg). Over 900 
women have been treated in PRIMROSE 1 and 2 combined for 24 weeks for the intended indication, 
with 598 at the higher 200mg linzagolix dose (+/- ABT), and the rest at the 100mg dose (+/- ABT). 
Over 603 patients have been treated in PRIMROSE 1 and 2 combined for 12-month weeks for the 
intended indication, with 315 at the higher 200mg linzagolix dose (+/-ABT), and the rest at the 100mg 
dose (+/- ABT). A smaller number of women with endometriosis (n=195) received 100mg or 200mg 
linzagolix up to week 24, with only 32 receiving linzagolix at 52 weeks (at the 100mg strength only).  
There were differences between the two PRIMROSE studies in terms of race, baseline weight and BMI.  
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 102/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Black subjects represented 63.1% of the patient population in PRIMROSE 1 but only 4.9% in 
PRIMROSE 2. In the Pooled Safety Analysis Set approximately 61-66% were white women, and the 
remainder 33-36% were Black or African American, and the treatment groups overall were balanced in 
this regard. Asian and other races are represented only with minimal numbers of patients (only 3 Asian 
women only out of 1037). The race profile of the Pooled Safety Analysis Set was not exactly matching 
the disease profile, as black women are more likely to have heavy menstrual bleeding caused by 
uterine fibroids than white women. Conversely white women have a higher underlying risk for 
osteopenia/osteoporosis.  
Subjects in PRIMROSE 1 had a higher mean weight (88.4 kg vs 74.0 kg) and mean BMI (32.7 kg/m2 
vs 27.0 kg/m2) compared to those in PRIMROSE 2. A higher percentage of PRIMROSE 1 subjects were 
anaemic. Correspondingly PRIMROSE 1 subjects had lower mean haemoglobin level (10.7 g/dL vs. 
11.5 g/dL) compared to those in the PRIMROSE 2 study.  
In the Pooled Safety Analysis Set, the mean age is similar across all treatment groups, 42 years to 
42.5 years, and this can be considered sufficiently reflective of the intended population.

 Adverse events 
General view of adverse events 
In the Phase 1, single dose studies, headache and nausea were the most commonly reported TEAEs, 
where doses up to 700mg linzagolix were given to healthy volunteers. 
In the multiple dose studies, as would be expected the most commonly reported TEAEs were related to 
the intended antioestrogen effect caused by GnRH receptor antagonism, hot flushes, night sweats etc 
and appeared to be dose dependent. Headaches were also common in the multiple dose studies. 
Anaemia was also commonly reported in the clinical trials treating patients with HMB and fibroids, as 
would be expected.  
Overall, the AE profile was similar for the 100 mg without ABT and the 200 mg+ABT regimens, with a 
higher incidence of oestrogen suppression-related TEAEs, such as hot flushes and decreases in bone 
mineral density, reported with the 200 mg dose. 
In a phase 2 study (EDELWEISS) conducted over 52 weeks, the most commonly reported TEAEs 
overall were headaches and hot flushes. Other commonly reported TEAEs, reported by at least 5% of 
the Treatment Extension Analysis Set (N=176), were nasopharyngitis (39 events in 28 subjects 
[15.9%]), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (17 events in 15 subjects [8.5%]), sinusitis (10 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 103/155 
 
  
 
 
 
events in 9 subjects [5.1%]), and urinary tract infection (10 events in 9 subjects [5.1%]). There was 
no apparent relationship between the incidence of these TEAEs and linzagolix dose.  
For the phase 3 studies, a summary table of the TEAEs reported in PRIMROSE 1 and PRIMROSE 2 
studies between Day 1 and Week 24 (Pooled Safety Analysis Set) is provided in Table 19           and 
Table 20 below.   
Overall TEAEs were common in all treatment groups including placebo. The linzagolix 200mg 
monotherapy arm had the highest number of TEAEs (63.3% of subjects), followed by the linzagolix 
100mg monotherapy arm(57.8%), followed by the linzagolix 200mg+ ABT arm(55.3%) and then by 
the Linzagolix 100mg+ ABT arm(50.7%), with placebo group at 49.3%. In terms of all TEAEs there is a 
slight dose exposure relationship for both monotherapy and with ABT therapy.  
Severe TEAEs on the other hand were not common, and did not show a clear dose exposure response, 
and in fact there were fewer severe TEAEs (versus placebo, 5.3%) in all arms with the exception of the 
linzagolix 200mg monotherapy arm (7.1%).  
Hot flushes were the most common TEAEs with 132 events in 12.7% of patients, and headache was 
the next most frequently reported TEAE at 7.2%, followed by anaemia in 6.2%. Headache was 
approximately twice as frequent in the linzagolix 200mg monotherapy group (11.9%) compared to the 
other arms including placebo (5.7%), which could suggest that there may be a dose exposure 
relationship with respect to oestradiol depletion.  
Anaemia is an AE which would be expected in this disease population, and in fact would be expected to 
occur less in all the linzagolix treated arms. There is no very clear relationship with respect to 
linzagolix dose however in relation to the anaemia TEAEs, however the lowest incidence was in the 
linzagolix 200mg group. 
Of note, mood swings appear in the list of TEAEs reported >2% in at least one arm but was not 
reported more frequently in the linzagolix treated groups versus placebo. However, as a group 
psychiatric disorders were approximately twice as commonly reported in the linzagolix 200mg 
monotherapy group (7.6%) versus all the other arms including placebo. See later discussion.  
Hyperhidrosis appears in the list of TEAEs reported >2% in at least one arm, and occurred most 
frequently in the linzagolix 200mg arm, as might be expected (3.3% versus 0% in both with ABT arms, 
and 0.5% in placebo). Additionally, when taken together, the terms hyperhidrosis and night sweats 
occur more commonly in the linzagolix 200mg monotherapy group (4.7%) versus 0-1.5% in all of the 
other group including placebo.  
LFT rises (specifically GGT, ALT and AST) are listed as these occurred at >2% in at least one study 
arm. When all 3 parameters are taken together there was a slight increase in the rate in the linzagolix 
arms overall versus the placebo group, but no obvious dose relationship. GGT rises in the linzagolix 
arms overall do not appear to be greater than placebo. When AST/ALT are considered together all 
linzagolix arms had slightly higher rates than placebo, and while no definite dose relationship can be 
seen, the highest rates are at the 200mg and 200mg + ABT arms. See later discussion.  
CK elevations had a similar frequency in placebo and treatment arms (0.5% to 1.4%), with the 
exception of the linzagolix 200mg+ ABT arm where there was a frequency >2% at 2.9%. See later 
discussion. 
Hypertension was reported as TEAE at > 2% in all treatment arms, (versus 1.9% in placebo) but no 
clear dose effect. The highest rate was in the 100mg+ ABT arm at 4.3%.

*Additional information: 
The applicant provided a post hoc re-analysis of the reasons for subject discontinuation in the 
PRIMROSE trials whereby subjects listed as discontinued due to reason ‘other’ were re-categorised in a 
more meaningful way. Subjects that had discontinued treatment due to meeting BMD discontinuation 
criteria, or LFT discontinuation criteria that had been listed as discontinuing due to reason ‘Other’ were 
re-categorised as discontinuing due to Adverse Event. It is important to state that all of the women 
who stopped treatment due to meeting BMD stopping criteria or LFT stopping criteria by week 24 had 
already been accounted for and discussed in detail by the applicant in the relevant BMD and liver 
safety sections of the dossier. For the week 0-week 24 period, the impact of any change on Table 19  
is minimal, see ‘post manual recording’ line based on the additional information. While the updated 
discontinuation rates due to AEs are more accurate, the table is not changed to any significant degree. 
The discontinuation rate due to AE ranges from 7.0%- 11% across the arms, with 8% in the placebo 
arm, and 11% in the 200mg only arm.

As to the TEAEs beyond Week 24, the Pooled Week 52 Safety Analysis Set (N=757) included all 
subjects from the Safety Analysis Set who received at least one dose of double-blind study drug after 
Week 24 and was the main safety analysis set for the second treatment period (Week 24 to Week 52). 
For the phase 3 studies, a summary table of the TEAEs reported in PRIMROSE 1 and PRIMROSE 2 
studies between week 24 and Week 52 (Pooled Safety Analysis Set) is provided below, Table 21, 
updated.

*Additional information:  
Arising from a post hoc review of the subjects that discontinued treatment a small number of 
additional adverse events were identified, and for a small number of patients the arising action with 
respect to drug related causes (drug interrupted, drug permanently withdrawn etc) was corrected. The 
updated TEAE rates are shown in the updated summary Table 21 of TEAEs for PRIMROSE 1 and 2, 
week 24-52 as ‘post manual recording’. The updated discontinuation rates due to AEs are more 
accurate, and reflect more clearly that the original 200mg arm had the highest rate of discontinuation 
due to TEAE. It is important to state that all of the women who stopped treatment due to meeting BMD 
stopping criteria or LFT stopping criteria from week 24-52 had already been accounted for and 
discussed in detail by the applicant in the relevant BMD and liver safety sections of the dossier.  
Incidence of TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation was lowest in the linzagolix 200 mg+ABT 
group (1.9%) and highest in the linzagolix 200 mg/200mg+ABT group (11.2%).

information section above.  
Overall, less TEAEs were reported in the 24-52 week time period versus 0-24 weeks, even though all 
patients had moved to active therapy after 24 weeks. The overall incidence of TEAEs was fairly 
consistent across the week 24-52 study arms, and no apparent dose dependency in terms of TEAE 
rates was observed. Similar to the 0-24 week data, most of the TEAEs were mild to moderate. Only 28 
of the 512 TEAEs (reported by 24 subjects overall [3.2%]) were graded as severe. The incidence of 
severe TEAEs was highest in the 100 mg+ABT group (5.5%). 
The  incidence of  TEAEs  considered related to  linzagolix ranged from  3.2%  (placebo group)  to 
14.9% (100mg) for linzagolix-related TEAEs and from 3.2% (placebo group) to 9.8% 
(placebo/200mg+ABT) for ABT-related TEAEs.

17 subjects (2.2%) reported SAEs during the second treatment period; two of these SAEs were 
considered possibly related to linzagolix and 3 SAEs were considered possibly related to ABT. 
No fatal TEAEs were reported in any treatment group. 
In the second treatment period, week 24 to 52 weeks, TEAEs were reported most frequently (>5% of 
subjects) in the SOCs of Infections and Infestations, Reproductive system and breast disorders, and 
Investigations. 
In the category Infections  and infestations  (most  frequently  nasopharyngitis)  T E A E s   were 
reported  in  10.7%  of subjects overall, with the highest incidence (16.1%) reported in the placebo 
group. 
Reproductive system and breast disorders (most frequently vaginal haemorrhage) were reported in 
8.1% of subjects overall. Events in this SOC were reported more frequently in the groups that 
switched treatments at Week 24 (e.g., placebo/200mg+ABT [9.8%] and 200 mg/200 mg+ABT 
[16.1%]) than in the other groups. 
Investigations (most frequently bone density decreased, and blood CPK increased) were reported in 
7.1% of subjects overall; incidence was lowest in the 100mg+ABT group (5.5%) and highest (9.8% in 
the placebo/200mg+ABT group). 
Overall, hot flushes and headaches were reported as TEAEs much less frequently in the dataset from 
week 24 to week 52.  
Anaemia was reported more frequently among subjects in the placebo group who started receiving 
linzagolix 200 mg+ABT at Week 24 compared to the subjects in all other groups who received 
linzagolix from Day 1 (7.3% vs.≤3.2%, respectively). Vaginal haemorrhage was  most frequent in  the 
200mg/200mg+ABT group  (4.3%) and least frequent (0.6%) in the 200mg+ABT group with no 
reports in the placebo group. Uterine haemorrhage was most common in the Placebo/Linzagolix 200mg 
+ ABT group at 3.3.%, vs < 0.7% in all other groups.  
Hypertension was reported more frequently in the linzagolix 100 mg groups (4.8% and 2.8%, with 
and  without ABT,  respectively) than  in  the  200  mg  ±ABT groups  (1.9%)  and  was  not reported in 
the placebo group. 
Bone density decreased ranged from 0.6% for the 200mg+ABT group to 3.2% for the placebo group. 
Specific adverse events of interest 
(i) Bone Mineral Density 
Reduction in BMD was an anticipated important risk AE for linzagolix, based on the mechanism of 
action, and hence is an AE of particular interest.  It is known that this GnRH antagonist works on 
fibroids by suppressing oestradiol in a dose dependent manner, with complete suppression (<20 
pg/ml) at the 200mg dose when given alone. When the 100mg and 200mg doses are given with ABT, 
oestradiol levels are expected to be in the range of 37.00-48.00pg/ml, which is still lower than normal 
levels but not entirely suppressed. The effect of oestradiol reduction on bone mineral density is key to 
appraising the benefit risk.  
TEAEs relating to BMD loss  
The breakdown of these AEs is provided in Tables 22 and 23 below. While the numbers or BMD related 
AEs are small overall, it is noted that there were twice as many such AEs after week 24 versus week 1-
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 108/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
24. This would generally make sense given the timing of DEXA monitoring, and the fact that effect on 
bone will be slower on onset and not be noticed. While the numbers are very small and clear trends 
cannot be identified, it is noted that more reduced BMD events were reported from week 24-52 in the 
linzagolix 200mg/linzagolix 200mg + ABT arm (4.3%) versus the other arms, with the same trend also 
seen in the follow up week 52-76 period.

Arising from a post hoc review of the subjects that discontinued treatment a small number of 
additional BMD related adverse events were identified that had not been reported as AEs by 
investigators, and hence are not reflected in Tables 22  and 23 above. These AEs were all in PRIMROSE 
2, and concerned ‘BMD decrease’ (meeting BMD stopping criteria) at week 24; one patient was in the 
100mg arm, and 4 were in the 200mg/ 200mg+ ABT arms. However, these cases of BMD loss were 
already documented and included in the percent change in BMD from baseline tables and in the 
categorical analyses of BMD change that were originally presented. 
There were four non road traffic accident fractures reported in the trial, of which only 2 had received 
an active therapy. Both occurred before 24 weeks, and while not entirely clear, it is assumed that 
treatment continued. One was a toe fracture for a patient in PRIMROSE 1 on 200mg linzagolix, and the 
other was also a foot fracture in a patient on linzagolix 100mg + ABT in PRIMROSE -2. Neither met the 
discontinuation criteria based on week 24 DEXA.

Categorical analysis of BMD change from baseline for the Pooled Safety Analysis Set up to week 52 
were provided and are summarized in table 25. Consistent with the mean % CfB data, BMD 
changes >3% were more frequent among subjects treated with linzagolix without ABT, particularly at 
the 200 mg dose, compared to the corresponding dose groups with ABT. At the total hip and femoral 
neck, BMD changes >3% were dose dependent as well in the linzagolix groups without ABT. In the 100 
mg group at Week 52 BMD changes of >8% from baseline at any site were observed in 12 subjects 
(12.6%) compared to 2 (10.5%) subjects in the placebo group. For the groups that received ABT, 0 
subjects had losses > 8% in the 100mg+ABT group versus 9 (9.8%) subjects in the 
200mg/200mg+ABT group.

percent category in the pooled analysis of the PRIMROSE 1 and PRIMROSE 2 studies (Pooled 
Week 52 Safety Analysis Set) 
Proportion of subjects with worst value at any bone site at Week 52 by 
Follow up data (Week52-Week 76 off treatment) was available for a relatively small subset of the 
PRIMROSE participants, who had a further BMD assessment after being 24 weeks off linzagolix 
therapy. Looking at the pooled data (Table 26 below) in all groups a trend to reversibility is seen, but 
not complete reversibility- none of the groups have returned to baseline BMD. Focussing on the lumbar 
spine, (considered to be the most sensitive), the slowest to recover group is that which did not receive 
ABT at all i.e. the 100mg group, -2.381 % CFB at week 52, and -1.901% at week 76. By contrast the 
100mg + ABT group was -0.909% at week 52 and -0.772% at week 76.

As to the phase 2 studies, only 2 measured BMD: the EDELWEISS study and the phase 2 Study 
KLH1204.  
In the EDELWEISS study, at 24 weeks, there was a -1.365% reduction in BMD at the lumbar spine site 
for the 100mg group, and a larger effect on BMD of -2.602% for the 200mg group   
The numbers per group are especially small by week 52, but the 100mg dosed arm had further, but 
slower reductions in BMD with a reduction at the lumbar site of -1.399% at week 52, and the patients 
who moved from 200mg to 100mg after week 24 had a mean change from baseline at the lumbar 
spine of -2.188%, with signs of some recovery after moving down the dose.  Some follow-up (off 
therapy) analyses, suggest some recovery at some of the site measurements of the BMD lost during 24 
or 52 weeks of therapy by week 76, however the numbers are too small to draw any firm conclusions.  
In the phase 2 Study KLH1204, there was a dose-dependent decrease in BMD in the linzagolix groups 
at the end of the 24-week treatment. The mean percent change (lower bound 95% CI) for the lumbar 
spine was -3.54% (-4.26%) in the 100 mg linzagolix group, compared with -4.42% (-5.16%) in the 
leuprorelin group.  
(ii) Effect on liver function, and CK 
Linzagolix in non-clinical studies (in dogs and monkeys), showed an increase in serum liver enzyme 
activity, and increase in serum lipid parameters with associated increase of liver weight. Also, 
elevations in liver function tests (LFTs) have been observed with other oral GnRH antagonists such as 
elagolix and relugolix and may be a class effect of GnRH analogues. Therefore, there was close LFT 
monitoring in the pivotal trials. Alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), gamma-
glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total and indirect bilirubin were assessed from 
blood samples taken at Screening, Day 1 and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 28, 32, 36, and 52, and will be 
taken during follow-up at the Week 64 visit. Subjects  with  ALT,  AST,  GGT  or  total  bilirubin  ≥2  times 
ULN at baseline were excluded.

Overall, no subjects met the criteria for Hy’s law (i.e., no subject had ALT or AST ≥3×ULN with 
concomitant total bilirubin ≥2×ULN or INR>1.5) at any time point during linzagolix treatment, and in 
most cases any increases seen were reversible on treatment.  
In the pooled analysis of PRIMROSE 1 and PRIMROSE 2 studies (N=1037) up to Week 24, 4.8% (50 
subjects) reported TEAEs of LFT increases. Most were considered as related to linzagolix, but none 
were considered serious. Overall GGT rises reported seem to be at a similar rate in the placebo group 
and each of the linzagolix groups. However, AST and ALT rises when combined are slightly more 
frequent in the treatment arms (with the exception of the 100mg + ABT arm) versus the placebo 
arms, with no very clear dose relationship.  
LFTs increases of >3x Upper Limit Normal (ULN) up to Week 24 were observed in fewer than 1% 
(0.76%; 6/794) in linzagolix groups and 0.48% in placebo (1/209). None were associated with a 
bilirubin increase > 2ULN and/or INR (International normalized ratio) increase > 1.5 ULN.

ALT/ALT: no changes were observed in the placebo group, while slight dose dependent increases in 
ALT were noted in the linzagolix groups without ABT at Week 12 and 24 and no changes were noted in 
the groups with ABT. 
Bilirubin: no change observed in the placebo group, while slight dose- dependent increases were 
noted in all linzagolix groups, particularly in the linzagolix doses with ABT.  
Alkaline phosphatase: there was no meaningful change in ALP in the placebo group while slight 
increases from baseline were noted in the linzagolix groups without ABT at Week 24 and no changes 
were noted in the groups with ABT. 
GGT: there were no changes in the mean GGT values in the placebo and linzagolix+ABT groups, 
however, there small steady increases were observed in mean GGT values up to Week 12 in the 
linzagolix 100 mg and 200 mg groups

Transaminase data were available at Week 24 for 997 subjects in the Pooled Safety Analysis Set. Up to 
Week 24, transaminase increases >3×ULN were infrequent (≤1% per group); 7 subjects experienced 
Grade 2 (>3×ULN) or higher elevations of ALT and/or AST, all but one during linzagolix treatment, for 
an overall incidence in the linzagolix groups of 0.76% (6/794). Grade 3 (>5×ULN) elevations were 
seen only in 3 subjects who were receiving either 200 mg (2 subjects) or 200 mg+ABT (1 subject)  
There were no Grade 4 elevations in any treatment groups up to Week 24.  
There were no clinically relevant changes over time in group values for ALT, AST, bilirubin, GGT, and 
alkaline phosphatase between Week 24 and Week 52 in the PRIMROSE studies.  Slight increases that 
had been seen in the linzagolix 100mg group at week 24 were partially reversed by week 52. In the 
linzagolix 100mg arm only, there was a small further rise from baseline alkaline phosphatase, from + 
7.0 U/L at week 24 to + 9.3 U/L at week 52.  
A further 9 subjects experienced Grade 2 or higher elevations of ALT and/or AST between Week 24 and 
Week 52. For 3 of these 9 subjects, alternate diagnoses were responsible for these transaminase 
increases. None of the affected subjects had elevations of total bilirubin >2 × ULN or INR >1.5.  
Grade 3 (>5×ULN) elevations or greater in AST or ALT were seen only in 4 subjects, and these were 
receiving 200 mg + ABT (4 subjects).  
These resolved in all subjects except for one subject with hepatitis C.  
None of the subjects in the Pooled Week 52 Safety Analysis Set met the definition of Hy’s law (i.e., 
subjects with any elevated ALT or AST of >3×ULN, ALP <2×ULN, and temporally associated with an 
increase in bilirubin ≥2×ULN or INR >1.5).  
Data from the Phase 1 and 2 studies largely support the findings form the pivotal studies.  
Based on the pooled dataset, Grade 4 elevations of creatine kinase (>10×ULN)were observed in 9 
subjects (0.9%) in the phase 3 studies (1 in placebo, 2 receiving 100 mg +/-ABT, and 6 receiving 200 
mg +/-ABT). In all cases the CK rises were asymptomatic, some were clearly related to exercise (or 
suspected to be muscular), or herbal remedies, and all resolved either on continued treatment, or after 
treatment discontinuation, so that there is no apparent signal of concern with respect to CK.  
(iii) Effect on lipid metabolism 
Changes in serum lipids are known to occur with decreases in serum oestradiol, and hence were an 
anticipated potential AE based on linzagolix’s mechanism of action.  
In PRIMROSE 1 and 2 there were increases in LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides which 
were evident at Week 12, and overall lipid parameters had stabilised by week 52. Increases in HDL are 
considered favourable, while increases in triglycerides and LDL are unfavourable.  
On-treatment increases in LDL occurred more frequently in the linzagolix groups (the 200mg 
group >100mg group) compared to placebo, and more frequently in the linzagolix without ABT 
compared to the corresponding groups with ABT. The addition of ABT seemed to attenuate the 
increases in lipid parameters. At Week 24, there was an approximately 5% increase in HDL cholesterol, 
22% increase in LDL cholesterol, 15% increase in total cholesterol, and 29% increase in triglycerides in 
the 200 mg arm.  
The changes in lipid parameters up to week 24 in the Pooled Safety Analysis Set are displayed below in 
the table below.

Increases in the percentages of subjects in these LDL cholesterol categories ≥160 mg/dL (≥4.14 
mmol/L) and ≥190 mg/dL (≥4.91 mmol/L) were seen in all treatment groups in the first treatment 
period, but they were most prominent in the 100 mg and particularly the 200 mg/200 mg+ABT 
groups. During  the second treatment period these percentages further increased for  the placebo/200 
mg+ABT group  and  the 100  mg+ABT group, while the other treatment groups remained relatively 
stable. 
With regard to the off treatment, week 64 follow up of lipid profiles, it is agreed that there are signs 
of reversibility for the various lipid parameters in all groups by week 64, however lipid levels still 
remained slightly elevated versus baseline after 12 weeks off therapy.  
Overall, in the phase 2 studies, there were no clinically significant changes or just small increases in 
total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL or LDL cholesterol. 
(iv) Depression and mood disorders, including suicidality 
There have been no SAEs associated with depression/anxiety /suicidality/mood reported in the clinical 
programme to date. Depression/suicidality has been reported with other GnRH antagonists and hence 
is of interest. 
In the period up to Week 24, depression was reported in 3 subjects, one each in the 100mg, 200mg 
and 200mg + ABT groups, and depressed mood was reported in 1 subject, 2 events.  
7 subjects (0.7%) reported anxiety, and of these 4 (1.9%) were in the linzagolix 200mg group.  
Other TEAEs, such as mood swings, mood altered, irritability, emotional disorder etc. were all reported 
infrequently at 0.2% or less, i.e. 2 patients or less.   
EMA/266814/2022

For the 24-52 week treatment period, less events under Psychiatric Disorders were reported versus 
the first treatment period. 
In the phase 2 trials, the most common TEAE in the SOC Psychiatric disorders was mood swings, 
reported with a higher frequency in the placebo arm (9%) than linzagolix groups (<4%) up to Week 
12.  
In one phase 1 trial, one subject was discontinued for the AE of severe altered mood, reported after 30 
days of 200mg linzagolix + concurrent ABT. The event which was attributed to E2/NETA treatment.  
Overall, there were low incidences of low mood, depression and anxiety reported through the program 
as a whole, and all cases were not severe, with no deaths/suicides or SAEs reported. However, the 
data suggest that there may be a slight increase in these events in linzagolix treated arms versus 
placebo, especially in the earlier stages of treatment. It also needs to be considered that ABT may also 
be a contributing factor in some cases as estrogen/progesterone have been reported to cause low 
mood or aggravation of depression. An increase in mood related disorders would also be consistent 
with the mechanism of action and warnings in other GnRH agonists and antagonists.  
There is an overall trend to increased mood disorders in the linzagolix treated groups versus placebo 
when the broader term mood disorders is considered, i.e. including mood swings, affect lability, 
emotional disorder, anxiety, depression, depressed mood, irritability and affect altered. Therefore, 
mood disorders as an umbrella term is listed in Section 4.8 for each linzagolix regime, with a common 
frequency in each case. The applicant has also added a paragraph to 4.4 on the possibility of mood 
disorders and advising caution in the case of women with previous depressive illness/or suicidality.  
(v) Hot flushes, night sweats and insomnia 
Hot flush was the most common TEAE reported in the linzagolix clinical program to date, which is 
consistent with the mechanism of action of linzagolix (i.e. dose-dependent oestradiol suppression). In 
the Pooled Safety Analysis Set, 132 subjects (12.7%) reported 141 events of hot flushes.  
The incidence of hot flushes was not only dose-dependent but seemed to wane with time: few reports 
of hot flushes after Week 24 (≤2.4% after week 24 in the 100 mg and various 200 mg+ABT groups). 
The incidence of night sweats and insomnia was generally low, reported in ≤2% of subjects in both 
100 mg and 200 mg+ABT groups, and also waned with time.  
The rates of hot flushes were lower in the fibroid phase 3 trials (33% with 200 mg, 10% with 100 mg 
and 200 mg+ABT) versus the phase 2 endometriosis EDELWEISS trial.  
(vi) Thromboembolic disorders and vascular disorders 
Thromboembolic disorders are particularly of interest due to the addition of ABT, which in itself can 
predispose women to thrombosis.  
There were no clinically meaningful changes in the coagulation parameters (PT INR, PT, a PTT) in any 
linzagolix groups in PRIMROSE 1 and 2, up to week 24, and up to 52 weeks.   
Thromboembolic events were rare. Of the 2194 subjects exposed to at least one dose of linzagolix, 3 
subjects (0.1%) treated with linzagolix  had  thromboembolic  events, and these were in the phase 2 
and 3 studies and were reported as SAEs.  
 (vii) Alopecia 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 118/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the reported incidences of alopecia were low, 0.5% in the pooled safety analysis set. Most of 
these events were reported during the first 24 weeks of treatment. Four of the total 6 cases were 
attributed to linzagolix (including one subject in the placebo group) and in 5 of the 6 cases the event 
was resolved or resolving while under treatment. The cases reported did not result in stopping therapy.  
(viii) Endometrial changes 
The potential for endometrial hyperplasia was assessed with endometrial biopsies and transvaginal 
ultrasound (measuring endometrial thickness) at baseline and at Weeks 24, 36, 52, 64 (ultrasound 
only) and 76 (biopsy only) in both PRIMROSE trials. One case of pre-existing endometrioid 
intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) was noticed and assessed as unlikely to be related to linzagolix or ABT. 
Among all other subjects, only a single case of simple hyperplasia (1.0%) was observed in the 
linzagolix 100 mg group at week 24; no other “non-benign” endometrial effects were observed at any 
other timepoint of the studies. 
Consistent with the histological evidence from the endometrial biopsies, there was also no evidence of 
endometrial thickening observed on ultrasound testing during the trials; a decrease in endometrial 
thickness was observed at all linzagolix doses; at Week 52, median thickness was 5 and 4 mm for the 
linzagolix 100 mg + ABT and linzagolix 200 mg + ABT. 
Overall, the updated review of endometrial safety as provided is acceptable, and it is agreed that from 
a clinical perspective there is not a signal with respect to endometrial safety. However, given the 
preclinical findings, endometrial safety was maintained as an important potential risk in the RMP.

 Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Overall, the incidence of SAEs (including death) in the entire programme was low, at no more than 
2%.   
The incidence of SAEs was low in the PRIMROSE 1 and PRIMROSE 2 trials (approx. 2% overall) with a 
similar incidence reported in the 100 mg and 200 mg+ABT groups during the first and second 
treatment periods. Across both pivotal trials there was only one death which had a clear non-
association with the trial.  
During the first 24 weeks of treatment, 15 subjects (1.8%) treated in any linzagolix arm reported 
SAEs compared to 4 subjects in placebo (1.9%), as such SAEs were quite evenly balanced across the 
placebo and treatment groups.  Approximately half of the SAEs reported in linzagolix groups were 
conditions common in the patient population with uterine fibroids, such as anaemia, pelvic pain, 
uterine haemorrhage, and uterine leiomyoma, which could indicate disease rather than drug treatment 
aetiology. With the exception of 2 SAEs of anaemia and 2 SAEs of uterine haemorrhage, all other SAEs 
occurred only once, and no trends can be identified.  
For the week 1-24 dataset, a significant proportion of the SAEs would appear to have a clear potential 
link to the disease profile and its symptoms, and as such could reasonably not be related in the patient 
population concerned; for example 7 of the 15 SAEs in the linzagolix arms were described as anaemia, 
uterine haemorrhage, pelvic pain, uterine leiomyoma (fibroid). In each of these cases the investigator 
considers the SAE to be not related to linzagolix +/- ABT.  
Some SAEs potentially of interest, across both studies, from week 1-24, excluding placebo SAEs: 
•  Chest pain - reported as unrelated.  
•  Bilateral pulmonary embolism - considered by the investigator to be unrelated to linzagolix, 
but possibly related to ABT. 
•  Metastatic breast cancer - reported as nonrelated to linzagolix 
•  Hypertension presenting with headaches - reported as reasonable possibility of causality by 
the investigator, but without reasonable possibility by the sponsor. 
•  Pelvic pain - reported as not related.  
•  Pyelonephritis and sepsis - reported as not related  
•  Anaemia - reported as not related.     
There were no SAEs that might indicate BMD loss. 
From Week 24 to Week 52, a total of 19 SAEs were reported in 17 subjects (2.2%). There is a similar 
frequency of SAEs across all the linzagolix arms.   
5 of the 19 SAEs for the week 24 to week 52 period could be reasonably considered disease/fibroid 
related by category, or indeed as treatment failures.  
•  2 SAEs of menorrhagia (both occurred while on linzagolix 200mg + ABT) - investigator 
considered these events as related to linzagolix (and to ABT), but in both cases fibroids or 
bleeding were cited as alternative aetiologies. 
• 
• 
one of vaginal haemorrhage (occurred while on linzagolix 200mg + ABT)  
one of anaemia (linzagolix 100mg + ABT) - investigator considers the event unrelated to 
linzagolix or ABT 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 120/155 
 
  
 
 
• 
one of haemoglobin decreased (linzagolix 100mg) - investigator considered the SAE as 
unrelated to linzagolix or ABT.   
In terms of other SAEs considered related to ABT (the cases of menorrhagia and vaginal haemorrhage 
have been described) and there was also an SAE of endometrial adenocarcinoma in a patient that 
had received 25 weeks of linzagolix 100mg + ABT, and who retrospectively was found to have 
endometrial changes at the time of screening; and the investigator considered this unrelated to 
linzagolix but related to/aggravated by ABT.  
The SAEs of hypoaesthesia and thyroid mass occurred in the same patient. Upon investigation, both 
events were listed by the investigator as unrelated to linzagolix or ABT.  
SAEs of femur fracture and joint dislocation occurred in the same patient, and happened because of a 
serious road traffic accident, thus unrelated to Linzagolix 200mg + ABT treatment.  
One subject had an SAE reported as a hypertensive crisis, of severe intensity, which required hospital 
admission to stabilise. The investigator considered the event to be unrelated to either linzagolix or 
ABT.   
Other SAEs that may be of interest:  
•  Deep vein thrombosis in one subject - reported as unrelated to linzagolix or ABT, but 
sponsor considered related to ABT.   
•  Breast cancer, estrogen receptor positive, progesterone positive in a patient that had 
received placebo and then linzagolix 200mg + ABT for approximately 19 weeks at the time of 
the event, in a patient with a history of breast nodules - reported as unrelated to either 
therapy.   
SAEs beyond Week 52 in PRIMROSE 1 and 2, week 52-week 76:  
There was a total of 8 SAEs reported in the off treatment, week 52-76 follow up period in PRIMROSE 
1(1 SAE) and PRIMROSE 2(7 SAEs). 
Of the 8 SAEs, 6 related to gynaecological bleeding/fibroids or anaemia, and in each case were in 
patients treated to week 52 with linzagolix + /-ABT and were considered not related to treatment by 
the investigators.  
2 of the SAEs in the follow up period relate to malignancy and were considered by the investigator to 
be unrelated to linzagolix. 
In the phase 2 studies, of the 852 subjects exposed to at least one dose of linzagolix, 16 subjects 
(1.9%) reported SAEs while on treatment and 5 (0.6%) reported SAEs during post-treatment follow-
up.  So overall the incidence was low and at approx. 2% which is similar to that seen in the phase 3 
studies.  
 Laboratory findings 
Haematology parameters:  
There were no meaningful trends in coagulation parameters in PRIMROSE 1 and 2 nor in the phase 1 
or phase 2 studies. That said, a dose-dependent decrease in platelet count is observed in linzagolix 
arms in the first treatment period, with greater losses at Week 24 compared to Week 12. Although 
platelet counts remained within normal reference range, the losses at 24 weeks in linzagolix arms are 
between -19.2 and -34.8 x109/L while platelet count in placebo arm remained unchanged. With further 
exposure (from week 24 to week 52), slight further decrease in mean platelet count was observed in 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 121/155 
 
  
 
 
the majority of linzagolix treated groups, namely -2x109/L (in 200/200mg+ABT arm); -6x109/L in 
200mg+ABT and -10x109/L in 100mg+ABT arm. These further decreases are quantitatively small and 
therefore not clinically relevant. Overall, the group receiving linzagolix 100mg had a mean change from 
baseline -20.0×109 at Week 24 and -15.0×109/L at Week 52. The group receiving 200 mg+ABT group 
had a mean change from baseline -32.3×109/L at Week 24 and–37.3×109/L at Week 52. Although a 
numerically small decrease from baseline in the mean platelet count is observed with linzagolix 
treatment, it was generally transient and not related to adverse events; therefore, this decrease does 
not appear to be of clinical relevance. 
With respect to FBC, consistent with the mechanism of action for linzagolix (lowering oestradiol levels 
and its effect on the reduction in menstrual blood loss) subjects in the linzagolix groups had 
improvements in haemoglobin levels, haematocrit, and erythrocyte counts at the end of the 24-week 
treatment. Improvements were dose dependent and the highest in the 200 mg+ABT group. 
AEs related to haematology and coagulation were infrequent; none of the AEs were serious or led to 
treatment discontinuation or interruption. 
Chemistry parameters: 
Of note liver profile, lipid profile and creatinine kinase are covered separately under specific AEs of 
interest.  
Overall, AEs related to other chemistry parameters were infrequent and had a similar overall incidence 
between treatment groups. There were no meaningful trends seen in PRIMROSE 1 and 2 nor in the 
Phase 1 or Phase 2 studies.   
Ferritin: Of note, while no increases in ferritin from baseline were observed in the placebo group, 
slight increases from baseline were noted in all linzagolix groups (mean change from baseline ranging 
from +7.3 µg/L to +16.5 µg/L) at Week 24, and further increases up to week 52.  This effect is 
consistent with intended effect in women with fibroids and heavy menstrual bleeding.  
Calcium: Overall there were no meaningful trends to increased calcium. There were no TEAEs reported 
relating to calcium that resulted in treatment discontinuation. However, individual on-treatment 
fluctuations and rises >ULN 2.58 mmol/L occurred in all treatment groups and with a similar frequency 
(<7%) in the placebo, 100 mg and 200 mg+ABT groups, and slightly higher frequency in the 200 mg 
group (12%). If needed, calcium supplements or study treatment were interrupted.  
Vitals signs:  
Overall, no meaningful changes from baseline or proportions of patients with abnormal vital sign 
measurements were observed in any treatment group. 
Blood pressure: 
In the Pooled Safety Analysis Set from the pivotal studies (N=1037), up to week 24, the PT of ‘blood 
pressure increased’ as a TEAE was reported by 6 subjects (0.6%) overall, with 2 subjects each in the 
linzagolix 100 mg and 200 mg groups (1.0% for each), and 1 subject each in 100 mg+ABT and 
200 mg+ABT groups (0.5% for each). The PT of ‘hypertension’ was reported by 29 subjects (2.8%) 
overall, with a slightly higher incidence in the 100 mg+ABT group (9 subjects; 4.3%) and similar 
incidence between placebo (4 subjects; 1.9%) and all other linzagolix groups: 5 subjects (2.5%) in 
100 mg, 6 subjects (2.9%) in 200 mg, and 5 subjects (2.4%) in 200 mg+ABT groups.  
Between Week 24 and Week 52, the PT of ‘hypertension’ was reported by 18 subjects (2.4%) in the 
Week 52 Safety Analysis Set: 0 subjects in the placebo group; 1 (0.8%) subject in the 
placebo/200mg+ABT group; 4 (2.8%) subjects in the 100 mg group; 7 (4.8%) subject in the 
100mg+ABT group; 3 (1.9%) subjects in the 200mg/200mg+ABT group; and 3 (1.9%) subjects in the 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 122/155 
 
  
 
 
200 mg+ABT group and the PT of hypertensive crisis was reported in 1 (0.1%) subject in the 200 
mg+ABT group.  
There were no clear trends towards the development of hypertension. Minor fluctuations in mean 
values were observed, with no dose-dependency, and are generally comparable to those observed with 
placebo. These minor variations in blood pressure were not considered to be clinically meaningful. 
Overall, there were 2 SAEs with respect to high blood pressure.  
ECG:  
In a phase 1 study, an early positive QTc prolongation signal was observed, in healthy participants, at 
both the therapeutic (200 mg) and supratherapeutic (700 mg) doses. The 700 mg and 200 mg 
linzagolix doses, at 3 hours post-dose, were found to prolong QTcF in this study up to 9.92 msec (90% 
CI 8.03 - 11.81) and to 8.34 msec (90% CI 6.44 - 10.23), respectively. Additional post-hoc by-time 
point analyses accounting for heteroscedasticity also produced borderline results for linzagolix 700 mg 
of 9.92 msec (90% CI 8.28 - 11.55) and values of 8.27 msec (90% CI 6.64 – 9.91 msec) for linzagolix 
200 mg, both at 3 hours post-dose.  
Hysteresis for linzagolix was observed, which indicated that the linear concentration-response 
modelling was not optimal. Thus, non-linear concentration response modelling was attempted. These 
models produced borderline results. 
In a phase 2 study (50mg group) one participant experienced QT prolongation. The event was noted 
on a single ECG 29 days after starting treatment and was considered mild in severity, resolving 18 
days after the onset, and after treatment discontinuation.  The baseline QT interval and the extent of 
the QT prolongation is not known.  
In the EDELWEISS study, no concerning QTc prolongation was observed in those who had ECGs 
performed.  
Cardiac TEAEs in Phase 3 studies (PRIMROSE 1 and 2): 
The rates of the cardiac and vascular TEAEs were presented up to week 24, and for PRIMROSE 2 
patients up to week 52, and no specific trends or signals are evident that might relate to QT 
prolongation. Additionally, one subject in the 100 mg group experienced 1 event of syncope; this 
subject’s QTcF values were ≤453 ms at all assessments. 
As ECG screening was introduced as part of protocol amendments, and was not required in the initial 
stages of the studies, in the Pooled Safety Analysis Set (N=1037), QTcF data were available for only 
556 subjects (53.6%) at baseline, and for only 516 (49.8%) to 581 (56.0%) subjects overall at 
subsequent time points. 
After the amendments local 12-lead ECG readings of QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) were 
performed at screening, Day 1 (prior to first dose), Week 4, 12, 24, 36, and 52 visits. 
Subjects with clinically significant abnormal ECG, or ECG with QTcF > 470 msec at screening or Day 1 
(prior to first dose) were excluded from participating in the studies. 
Shifts in QTcF for the Pooled Safety Analysis Set 
There were no subjects with on-treatment QTcF interval prolongation ≥500 ms. 
Otherwise, no subject had an on-treatment absolute QTcF interval prolongation ≥480 ms as measured 
at Weeks 4, 12, and 24. 
Increases in QT relatives to baseline 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 123/155 
 
  
 
 
Increases of ≥60 ms relative to the highest pre-treatment value were seen in 2 subjects, both treated 
with linzagolix alone. 
Several increases of ≥30 ms relative to the highest pre-treatment value were observed, including in 
the placebo group. Increases of ≥30 ms from the highest pre-treatment value did not appear to be 
dose-related and did not show a clear temporal pattern.  
It should be noted that of the 3 subjects who had persistent or recurrent increases, 2 subjects had 
relatively low baseline values. 
Considering both treatment periods in the PRIMROSE 1 and the PRIMROSE 2 studies, increases of ≥30 
ms relative to the highest pre-treatment value were transient in approximately half of the subjects 
experiencing such increases.

The effects of linzagolix on pregnancy were considered as an important potential risk. Due to its 
mechanism of action, in preclinical studies linzagolix prevented conception and reduced implantation in 
rats and resulted in embryo-foetal mortality, total litter loss or abolished pregnancy in rat and rabbit 
embryo-foetal studies. There were no teratogenic effects and no adverse effect on the pre- and 
postnatal development of the offspring that survived. Linzagolix is therefore contraindicated during

pregnancy and a warning has been raised for women of childbearing potential at risk of pregnancy and 
not using contraception.  
It is important for women to realise that linzagolix (or linzagolix + ABT) is not a contraceptive, and 
hence effective non hormonal contraception will be needed to avoid pregnancy. Hormonal methods of 
contraception are not recommended. The need for contraception with linzagolix, and the fact that 
linzagolix with or without ABT does not provide contraception is reinforced by inclusion in section 4.4 
and 4.6 of the SmPC.  The SmPC states that women of childbearing potential at risk of pregnancy 
should be advised to use effective non-hormonal contraception while on treatment with YSELTY and 
that if a patient becomes pregnant while taking YSELTY, therapy should be discontinued.  
Further, women will need to be aware that pregnancy may not be easily identified as linzagolix may 
induce amenorrhoea. Given that the potential effects of linzagolix on pregnancy is an important 
identified risk, it is also relevant that treatment with linzagolix may have effects on menstrual 
bleeding, for example amenorrhoea, such that a women may not realise that she is pregnant, and a 
warning in this regard is made clear in the product information.   
In line with national Scientific Advice received, as part of the off- treatment follow up of PRIMROSE 1 
and 2, return to menses in women who had been amenorrhoeic was investigated. By 12 weeks after 
the end of treatment 87% and 90% of subjects had recommenced uterine bleeding in PRIMROSE 1 and 
2 respectively, and estradiol levels were no longer suppressed.   
Breastfeeding 
In preclinical studies tissue distribution of radiolabelled linzagolix was widespread; and radioactivity 
was also detected in foetal tissues and milk. Breastfeeding women were not included in the clinical 
development plan. Because breastfeeding is a contraindication for Yselty, breastfeeding is not listed as 
missing information for the purposes of the RMP.  
Age  
Age is less of a variable factor in this population/indication, as women will be pre-menopausal, 
menstruating, and likely will be in their 30s and 40s. There is no safety (or efficacy data) for use in 
adolescent girls and this is outlined in the product information; however, it would be a very rare 
circumstance for women in this age bracket to be affected by HMB caused by uterine fibroids. The 
applicant has provided an analysis of the week 24 lumbar spine BMD changes from baseline for the 
following age categories, <39 years, 39 to <43 years, 43 to <46 years, ≥46 years. The overall trends 
are generally the same across the age brackets, in that the 200mg group showed the greatest loss of 
BMD, followed by the 100mg group, followed then by the 200mg + ABT group and the 100mg ABT 
group. Based on the figures provided, the 2 younger cohorts appear to show a greater loss from 
baseline than the 2 older cohorts with the 200mg dos.  However, because the subgroups are small, 
and given that there is also a high rate of missing BMD data the ability to draw conclusions is limited.   
Race 
It is known that white women are generally more at risk of BMD loss/osteoporosis than black women.  
The applicant has provided an analysis of the week 24 BMD changes from baseline in the Pooled Safety 
Analysis Set for black versus non-black, at the 3 sites.  Although there was missing data for an 
accurate interpretation, the numbers as presented do not indicate a significant difference in BMD 
reduction in black versus white patients.  
Weight/BMI 
Women with low body weight are known to be more at risk of BMD loss/osteoporosis. The applicant 
has provided an analysis of the week 24 BMD changes from baseline in the Pooled Safety Analysis Set 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 126/155 
 
  
 
 
for 4 different weight brackets (<66.9kg, 66.9 to <77.6kg, 77.6 to <94.2kg and ≥94.2kg) and 4 
different BMI brackets (<24.6kg/m2, 24.6 to<28.9kg/m2, 28.9 to <34.4kg/m2 and ≥34.4kg/m2). 
While there is some variability to be seen across the weight/BMI brackets, for example higher 
reduction in the lowest weight/BMI bracket, no conclusions can be drawn, as this observation could be 
explained by the small number of measurements per bracket.  
Liver impairment 
The applicant performed a hepatic impairment study. Overall, HI (mild, moderate, and severe) had no 
relevant effect on total plasma linzagolix PK following administration of 200 mg linzagolix. The 
unbound fraction of linzagolix was not affected by mild and moderate HI compared to heathy subjects. 
However, following administration of 200 mg linzagolix to severe HI patients, Cmax u and AUCu were 
2- to 3-fold higher compared to healthy matched control subjects. For this reason, linzagolix should not 
be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment. See discussion in the Clinical Pharmacology 
Section. 
Renal impairment 
A renal impairment study was performed. See discussion in the Clinical Pharmacology Section. Use in 
moderate, severe renal impairment or end-stage renal impairment is to be avoided.  
 Immunological events 
Not applicable 
 Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
While contraception is important in all women of childbearing potential taking any of the 4 regimes of 
linzagolix, it is important to note that hormonal contraception is not suitable to take with linzagolix, 
and hence the SmPC advises non hormonal contraceptive methods. There are no data to rule out 
pharmacodynamic reactions between linzagolix and the various hormonal contraceptive methods, both 
oestrogen/progesterone based, and progesterone only based, including hormonal IUDs.  
 Discontinuation due to adverse events 
TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation up to Week 24 in PRIMROSE 1 and PRIMROSE 2 studies 
(Pooled Safety Analysis Set) 
In the pooled analysis safety set of PRIMROSE 1 and 2, there were 90 subjects that had a TEAE that 
resulted in discontinuation, which is approximately 9% of patients in the dataset. Overall, these 
patients are balanced fairly evenly across the 5 treatment arms, with no apparent dose relationship, 
7.5-11% in each arm stopped therapy due to a TEAE. 
The most frequent TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were: 
• 
• 
• 
headache (11 subjects; 1.1%) 
hot flush (11 subjects, 1.1%) 
bone density decreased (6 subjects; 0.5%), + related PTs osteopenia in 2 subjects + 
osteoporosis in 1 subject= Overall 9 subjects, 0.9% 
•  GGT increased (9 subjects; 0.9%) 
• 
nausea (7 subjects, 0.7%) 
•  migraine (5 subjects; 0.5%) 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 127/155 
 
  
 
 
The rates of discontinuations due to specific TEAEs were generally comparable between placebo and 
linzagolix groups, with some few exceptions: 
•  Hot flush and nausea, both of which are listed as TEAEs more slightly more often in the 
linzagolix 200mg arm versus the other linzagolix arms and placebo.  
•  Anxiety as a TEAE leading to discontinuation only occurred in the linzagolix 200mg arm (3 
patients) and the Linzagolix 200mg+ ABT arm (1 patient).  
•  Also, of the 9 cases of BMD decreased, 2 cases were in placebo, with 4 in the linzagolix 
100mg+ ABT arm, 2 in the 200mg arm and one in the linzagolix 200mg + ABT arm. 
In general, otherwise, many of the TEAEs that resulted in stopping therapy occurred only once, and as 
such no trends are possible to identify.  Of note, in relation to the GGT rise TEAE in 9 subjects overall, 
4 of these were actually in the placebo group.  
Between Week 24 and Week 52 in the PRIMROSE 2 study- Week 52 Safety Analysis Set 
In the second treatment period, a total of 49 of the subjects (6.5%) experienced TEAEs that led to 
permanent discontinuation of study treatment. Incidence of TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation 
was lowest in the linzagolix 200 mg+ABT group (1.9%) and highest in the linzagolix 
200 mg/200mg+ABT group (11.2%). During the second treatment period (Week 24 to 52), the most 
common TEAEs leading to discontinuation were related to BMD loss (i.e., PTs of bone density 
decreased): 16/757 (2.1%) and vaginal haemorrhage (4/757, 0.5%) while most other TEAEs leading 
to discontinuation were reported by no more than two subjects in any treatment group.  
*Additional information:  
The applicant provided a post hoc re-analysis of the reasons for subject discontinuation in the 
PRIMROSE trials whereby subjects listed as discontinued due to reason ‘other’ were re-categorised in a 
more meaningful way. Subjects that had discontinued treatment due to meeting BMD discontinuation 
criteria, or LFT discontinuation criteria had been listed as discontinuing due to reason ‘Other’ were re-
categorised as discontinuing due to Adverse Event. It is important to state that all of the women who 
stopped treatment due to meeting BMD stopping criteria, or LFT stopping criteria were already 
accounted for and discussed in detail in the original assessment.  
The main impact of this post hoc re- analysis is on the week 24-52 subject disposition tables, and the 
updates  are  displayed  in Table  31  below.  Using  the  post  hoc  analysis of  the week  24-52  period,  the 
discontinuation rate due to AE is higher across all treatment arms, and most of these additional subjects 
listed  as  discontinuing  due  to  AE  are  those  who  met  BMD  stopping  criteria  at  week  24.    While  the 
linzagolix 200mg/Linzagolix 200mg + ABT group rate of discontinuation of 12.4% is almost twice that 
of other groups, this is not unexpected as the 200mg group is the one expected to have the most impact 
on BMD, given that this group had the higher 200mg dose from week 0-24 without the protection of 
ABT.

 Discussion on clinical safety 
Disease profile, mechanism of action of therapy, and likely anticipated toxicities  
Linzagolix is a GnRH antagonist which is targeted to reduce the size of uterine fibroids and reduce 
associated heavy menstrual bleeding. It works by binding competitively to pituitary gland GnRH 
receptors and is inhibiting receptor activation by endogenous GnRH, leading to a rapid suppression of 
LH and FSH, which then leads to dose-dependent reduction in serum oestradiol and progesterone 
levels, Therefore it would be anticipated that a significant part of the safety profile should relate to 
effects of reduction of estradiol and progesterone. Anticipated potential toxicities included hot flushes, 
hypertension, mood changes, reduction in bone mineral density, endometrial effects, changes in 
menstrual bleeding including failure to identify pregnancy, liver enzyme changes, lipid parameter 
changes, hair loss, thromboembolic disorders, and these have been specifically investigated in the 
linzagolix clinical programme.  
Studies presented, and approach to pooling and datasets 
The safety analysis presented in the current application is based primarily on the results of two phase 
3 clinical trials, PRIMROSE 1 and PRIMROSE 2 and is supported by the safety data from 5 phase 2 
clinical trials in patients with endometriosis, and 12 Phase 1 trials in healthy female volunteers. 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 129/155 
 
  
 
 
 
The applicant’s approach to pooling of the safety data is to pool the safety data from PRIMROSE 1 and 
PRIMROSE 2.  There are 2 main pooled analysis sets: (1) The (Week 24) Pooled Safety Analysis 
Set of 1037 subjects in the phase 3 studies is defined as all randomized subjects in the two phase 3 
studies PRIMROSE 1 and PRIMROSE 2, who received at least one dose of double-blind study drug 
irrespective of the treatment received. (2) The (Week 52) Pooled Week 52 Safety Analysis Set 
(N=757) which included all subjects from the Safety Analysis Set who received at least one dose of 
double-blind study drug after Week 24.  
Overall, this approach to pooling is acceptable given that the study designs are essentially identical, 
even though the patient demographics are quite different with respect to race, and somewhat different 
with respect to weight, BMI. No pooling has been applied to the phase 2 and 1 data.  
Patient population and exposure 
To date, 2194 subjects have been exposed to different daily doses of linzagolix (12.5 mg- 700 mg). 
Over 900 women have been treated in PRIMROSE 1 and 2 combined for 24 weeks for the intended 
indication, with 598 at the higher 200mg linzagolix dose (+/- ABT), and the rest at the 100mg dose 
(+/- ABT). Over 603 patients have been treated in PRIMROSE 1 and 2 combined for 12-month weeks 
for the intended indication, with 315 at the higher 200mg linzagolix dose (+/-ABT), and the rest at the 
100mg dose (+/- ABT). A smaller number of women with endometriosis (n=195) received the 2 
proposed doses without ABT up to week 24, with only 32 receiving linzagolix at 52 weeks (at the 
100mg strength only).  
Overall, the exposure is deemed acceptable to evaluate the safety profile of linzagolix which is 
intended for the treatment of heavy bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. There are no on-
treatment efficacy or safety data beyond 52 weeks, and section 5.1 of the SmPC was informed 
accordingly.  
There were differences between the two PRIMROSE studies in terms of race, baseline weight and BMI. 
Black subjects represented 63.1% of the patient population in PRIMROSE 1 but only 4.9% in 
PRIMROSE 2. In the Pooled Safety Analysis Set approximately 61-66% were white women, and the 
remainder 33-36% were Black or African American, and the treatment groups overall were balanced in 
this regard. Asian and other races are represented only with minimal numbers of patients (only 3 Asian 
women only out of 1037). The race profile of the Pooled Safety Analysis Set is not exactly matching 
the disease profile, as black women are more likely to have heavy menstrual bleeding caused by 
uterine fibroids than white women. Conversely white women have a higher underlying risk for 
osteopenia/osteoporosis.  
Subjects in PRIMROSE 1 had a higher mean weight (88.4 kg vs 74.0 kg) and mean BMI (32.7 kg/m2 
vs 27.0 kg/m2) compared to those in PRIMROSE 2. A higher percentage of PRIMROSE 1 subjects were 
anaemic. Correspondingly, PRIMROSE 1 subjects had lower mean haemoglobin level (10.7 g/dL vs. 
11.5 g/dL) compared to those in the PRIMROSE 2 study.  
In the Pooled Safety Analysis Set, the mean age is similar across all treatment groups, 42 years to 
42.5 years, and this can be considered sufficiently reflective of the intended population.  
Adverse events  
In the Week 24 Pooled Safety Analysis Set linzagolix 200mg monotherapy arm had the highest rate of 
TEAEs reported (63.3%), followed by the linzagolix 100mg monotherapy arm (57.8%). Only 4.9% 
overall reported severe TEAEs with the highest rate of severe TEAEs in the 200mg monotherapy arm. 
Hot flushes were the most common TEAE at 12.7% of patients overall, followed by headache at 7.2% 
overall, followed by anaemia at 6.2%. Headache was approximately twice as frequent in the linzagolix 
200mg monotherapy group (11.9%) compared to the other arms including placebo (5.7%), which 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 130/155 
 
  
 
 
could also suggest a dose exposure response with respect to oestradiol depletion. Anaemia was also 
common (overall 6.2%) but would be an expected AE in this population, but there is no very clear 
relationship with respect to dose. TEAEs reported at approximately 2% overall, and without any clear 
dose or treatment response include GGT/ALT/AST rises (see separate section on liver enzymes), 
nasopharyngitis (2.4%), hypertension (2.8%), pelvic pain (2.6%), vaginal haemorrhage (1.9%), and 
arthralgia (2.2%). Nausea was reported in 2.6% overall but was most common in the 200mg arm 
(5.2%). Overall, the AE profile was similar for the 100 mg without ABT and the 200 mg+ABT regimens, 
with a higher incidence of the more immediate oestrogen suppression-related TEAEs, such as 
vasomotor symptoms, hot flushes, hyperhidrosis, and vulvovaginal dryness etc, reported with the 200 
mg dose.  
Compared to week 0-24, a considerably smaller proportion of subjects overall reported TEAEs from 
week 24-52 (35.9% vs 54.8%). From week 24-52 all patients were on linzagolix in some form, and the 
incidence of TEAEs was fairly consistent across the study arms, and there was no apparent dose 
dependency.  Overall, hot flushes and headaches were reported as TEAEs less frequently in the dataset 
from week 24 to week 52. The most commonly reported TEAEs (reported in ≥2% of subjects in at least 
one active arm were anaemia (20 subjects, 2.6%), hypertension (18 subjects 2.4%), nasopharyngitis 
(17 subjects, 2.2%), and bone density decreased (15 subjects, 2.0%). 
In the phase 2 studies the TEAE profile of linzagolix is largely consistent with the phase 3 studies, with 
the exception being that headache was the most frequently reported TEAE in the EDELWEISS study 
rather than flushes: however flushes were reported at a higher frequency in the 200mg arm versus 
that seen in the pivotal studies.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Overall, the incidence of SAEs is low, approx. 2% in phase 3, and similar in phase 2, and 0% in phase 
1, and overall did not occur with increased frequency in the linzagolix/ABT arms. There have been no 
deaths that can be attributed to linzagolix. Many of the SAEs could reasonably be attributed to the 
patients underlying disease, particularly PV bleeding, anaemia, pelvic pain.  
Among the SAEs in phase 3:  
The SAEs of chest pain and hypertension which occurred on linzagolix 200mg+ ABT and linzagolix 
100mg respectively were not convincing for being related to study therapy, and in each case resolved 
with minimal intervention even while therapy continued.  
The 2 SAE cases of venous thromboembolism for the phase 3 studies are not convincing enough to 
attribute causality to linzagolix.  
There was also an SAE of endometrial adenocarcinoma in a patient that had received 25 weeks of 
linzagolix 100mg + ABT, and who retrospectively was found to have endometrial changes at the time 
of screening; and the investigator considered this unrelated to linzagolix but related to/aggravated by 
ABT.  
Among the SAEs in phase 2:  
There was one VTE SAE reported, a pulmonary embolism in a woman treated with 200mg linzagolix, 
that was reported as not related by the investigator; considering the background rate of VTE in this 
population this does not necessarily in itself constitute a concern. There was also one breast cancer 
reported within 4 weeks of starting a low dose 50mg linzagolix regime, which in itself does not sound 
suspicious for causality, and that is reaffirmed by the fact that mammography had picked up a right 
breast lesion 3 months prior to starting linzagolix. There was also one subarachnoid haemorrhage, 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 131/155 
 
  
 
 
 
which resolved with no intervention in a woman treated with over 2 months of linzagolix low dose 
25mg.  
Adverse events of special interest  
Bone mineral density 
Overall, there is a trend of dose dependent BMD loss in the PRIMROSE 1 and 2 studies, with ABT 
attenuating some of the loss.  
At 24 weeks the greatest reduction was in the linzagolix 200mg group at -3.697%, followed by the 
Linzagolix 100mg group at approx. -2%, and with the smallest reduction(of similar magnitude) in the 
Linzagolix 200mg + ABT, and Linzagolix 100mg + ABT groups (- 1.129% and -0.963% reduction 
respectively). 
BMD measurements at 52 weeks for pooled data from PRIMROSE 1 and 2 indicate that a slower rate of 
bone loss occurs after 24 weeks. This points towards the possibility of reversibility.  
In terms of the z score analyses at Week 24 similar trends were seen.  
The same dose dependent loss of BMD trend, with mitigation by the addition of ABT is also reflected in 
the analyses at 24 and 52 weeks looking at numbers of patients with more than a 3% loss in BMD and 
more than 8% loss in BMD. 
It is noted that there is a high rate of missing BMD measurements at week 24 and at week 52, for both 
pivotal studies is due to the dropout rate. The clinical characteristics, as well as baseline BMD of the 
subjects missing week 24 BMD data and those with week 24 BMD data are very similar. 
There are follow up, off treatment week 76 BMD results available from PRIMROSE 1 and 2 (after 
women stopped therapy at 52 weeks) which point to a partial recovery of the BMD lost up to week 52, 
however the numbers involved are small. Focussing on the lumbar spine, (considered to be the most 
sensitive), the slowest to recover group is that which did not receive ABT at all i.e. the 100mg group. 
Similarly, looking at proportions with BMD loss in the > 3% CFB category at week 76, the 100mg dose 
had the highest number of patients with CFB > 3%. For the > 8% category by week 76 there were 
only 3 patients, one in the placebo/200mg+ ABT group, and 2 in the 100mg group.  
Further, the applicant has calculated ‘partial recovery’ and ‘complete recovery’ percentages at week 76 
for those women who completed all their BMD assessments. A subject was considered to have a 
complete recovery of BMD if her Week 76 measurement was equal to or greater to her baseline 
measurement. Again, complete recovery is higher in the + ABT groups, and lowest in the 100mg alone 
group.  
Follow-up BMD assessment for the women that had to leave the PRIMROSE studies on account of 
meeting the BMD loss discontinuation criteria was also presented, where DEXA was performed 6 
months after stopping therapy. While this is a small dataset, and it is understood that BMD 
measurements have inherent variability, nonetheless the data do suggest a trend of reversibility or 
partial reversibility by 6 months after stopping trial therapy. Approximately 30% had recovery up to -
3% BMD loss, and another 50% had a more partial recovery by 6 months. While 5/17 (30%) women 
did not show any recovery, 2 of these women were in fact on placebo.  
In the pivotal studies women were excluded at baseline if they had a significant risk for or history of 
osteoporosis, and thus the study population may reflect a group less susceptible to bone loss than the 
real-world population. Therefore, the product information specifies that a baseline DEXA is required for 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 132/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
any woman with a higher baseline risk for BMD loss, before starting any linzagolix regime, as these 
women may experience greater bone loss than seen in the pivotal studies.  
In terms of the impact of ethnic group on linzagolix induced BMD loss, the Japanese late phase 2 
endometriosis study (n=455) shows a more significant decrease in BMD at 24 weeks than seen at the 
same dose in the pivotal studies. No difference could be found in the PK or PD of linzagolix in Asian 
women vs other ethnic groups, even though Asian women tend to have a lower BMI. There are limited 
data from Asian women in the PRIMROSE trials, only 3 in total participated. Overall, the wording in 
SmPC 4.4 is sufficient to alert the prescriber to assess each woman’s individual risk comprehensively, 
and the key risk factors are listed.  
Revised dosing options and warnings in the product information with respect to BMD monitoring have 
been agreed. It has been agreed that a DEXA after 12 months therapy is required for all women. The 
100mg dose will require yearly BMD assessment thereafter, and the 200mg + ABT dose, and the 
100mg + ABT dose will need BMD follow up assessment at a frequency to be decided by the physician 
based on the woman’s individual risk and previous BMD results. It has also been agreed that Yselty 
should be prescribed in the specialist setting only.  
Effect on liver function 
Overall cases of hepatic enzyme increase, particularly transaminases, were common, and it is 
important to note that in most cases the women were asymptomatic. It is also important to consider 
that women were excluded from the PRIMROSE studies if they had a raised baseline LFT more than 
twice the ULN for any parameter.  
Looking at liver enzyme TEAEs of any grade in the pooled analysis of PRIMROSE 1 and PRIMROSE 2 
studies (N=1037) up to Week 24, 4.8% (50 subjects) reported TEAEs of LFT increases. The majority of 
these were low grade rises, and none were recorded as an SAE.  
Overall, liver enzyme increases were common in a population of women with near normal baseline 
LFTS, especially ALT/AST, but the rises generally seemed to resolve. The product information has been 
updated with warnings with respect to the possibility of liver enzyme changes. Women with known 
baseline hepatic impairment or LFT elevations should be treated with caution and should have a 
baseline LFT as well as further regular monitoring.  
Cardiac safety, with a focus on QT prolongation 
QTc prolongation was observed in the TQT study. Mean placebo-corrected change from baseline QT 
(ddQTcF) for the 2 linzagolix dose groups revealed upper bounds of the 90%, 2-sided CI of 10.23 and 
11.81 msec for the 200 mg and 700 mg dose at 3 hours after administration, respectively. Further 
concentration-response models predicted QTc effects close to but below the 10ms threshold, these 
predictions are not considered reliable given that all models had limitations. 
Although a trend for QT prolongation has not been demonstrated in the clinical studies this remained a 
concern. Section 4.4 of the SmPC was updated accordingly. 
Hypertension 
There were no meaningful changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure among treatment groups up 
to Week 24 or up to week 52.  It is appropriate that rises in blood pressure are listed as potential AEs, 
especially given that independently ABT may also increase the risk of blood pressure rises.  
Effect on lipid profile 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 133/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Linzagolix does seem to influence the lipid profile, with increases across all the lipid/cholesterol 
parameters including HDL, LDL, triglycerides and total cholesterol. While these increases are likely not 
of clinical significance in women with healthy lipid profiles, they could be of significance for women with 
an already elevated lipid profile, particularly if treatment is over an extended over years. A warning 
has been added to section 4.4 of the SmPC to advise that lipid profile parameter rises are possible, and 
that monitoring might be considered for women with known hypercholesterolaemia. Lipid profile 
changes generally appeared to stabilise in the second treatment period.     
Depression and mood disorders, including suicidality 
Overall, there were low incidences of low mood, depression and anxiety reported through the 
programme as a whole, and all cases were not severe, with no deaths/suicides. However, the data 
suggest that there may be a slight increase in these events in linzagolix treated arms versus placebo, 
especially in the earlier stages of treatment. It also needs to be considered that ABT may also be an 
independent contributing factor in some cases as estrogen/progesterone have been reported to cause 
low mood or aggravation of depression. Therefore, mood disorders as an umbrella term is listed in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC for each linzagolix regime, with a common frequency in each case. A 
paragraph has been added to SmPC section 4.4 on the possibility of mood disorders and advising 
caution in the case of women with previous depressive illness/or suicidality. An increase in mood 
related disorders would be consistent with the mechanism of action and warnings in other GnRH 
agonists and antagonists.  
Hot flushes, night sweats and insomnia 
Hot flush was the most common TEAE reported in the linzagolix clinical program, which is consistent 
with the mechanism of action. The incidence of night sweats and insomnia was generally low, reported 
in ≤2% of subjects in both 100 mg and 200 mg+ABT groups. 
Thromboembolic disorders and vascular disorders 
Overall thromboembolic and vascular disorders were rare (0.1%), and no substantial changes in 
coagulation parameters was noted.  There is no signal that there is any increase in venous 
thromboembolism over the baseline risk for women of this age from the linzagolix development’s data.   
Alopecia 
Overall, the reported incidences of alopecia were low, 0.5% in the pooled safety analysis set.  
Safety in special populations  
Pregnancy/Breastfeeding 
Pregnancy is an important potential risk based on the pre-clinical findings:  linzagolix prevented 
conception and reduced implantation in rats and resulted in embryo-foetal mortality, total litter loss or 
abolished pregnancy in embryo-foetal studies. These findings fit with the intended MOA of linzagolix 
therapy, which is oestradiol suppression, and therefore linzagolix is appropriately contraindicated in 
pregnancy and breastfeeding. The clinical data of pregnancies reported on linzagolix is understandably 
very limited and is not enough to downgrade the important potential risk given the MOA of linzagolix.  
Linzagolix has been shown not to reliably inhibit ovulation, and further women will need to be aware 
that pregnancy may not be easily identified as linzagolix may induce changes in menstrual patterns 
including amenorrhoea. There are no data to rule out pharmacodynamic reactions between linzagolix 
and the various hormonal contraceptive methods, both oestrogen/progesterone based, and 
progesterone only based, including hormonal IUDs, Therefore, non-hormonal contraception will need to 
be in place for all WOCBP taking linzagolix and the SmPC was informed accordingly.

Age 
Age is less of a variable factor in this population/indication, as described in the section on the special 
population. The overall trends seen in the clinical studies are generally the same across the age 
brackets, in that the 200mg group showed the greatest loss of BMD, followed by the 100mg group, 
followed then by the 200mg + ABT group and the 100mg +ABT group. 
Race 
It is known that white women are generally more at risk of BMD loss/osteoporosis then black women  
An apparent increased BMD loss in Asian women in the Japanese phase 2 study has already been 
discussed.   
BMI/weight 
Women with low body weight are known to be more at risk of BMD loss/osteoporosis. No conclusions 
can be drawn from the available data, as there was only a small number of measurements per bracket.  
Treatment discontinuation due to AEs 
Overall, the rate of discontinuations due to TEAEs was low in both the 0-24 week, and the 24-52 week 
periods.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
 Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Generally, linzagolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids was 
well tolerated by women. Few serious adverse events occurred and very few were considered related 
to linzagolix. The most common adverse reported are in keeping with the intended mechanism of 
action of linzagolix (i.e. oestrogen suppression) such as flushes, night sweats and bone mineral density 
bone loss, and are attenuated by the addition of ABT. Other adverse events such as elevations in liver 
function tests, lipid profile, mood changes are also consistent with the drug class, and generally could 
be manageable with appropriate labelling and monitoring.  
The risk of bone mineral density loss for women is not insignificant for each of the 4 possible regimes, 
with the 200mg dose having the most notable effect on BMD, followed by the 100mg dose. 
Importantly, the risk and rate of bone loss with continued use has not been fully characterised as on 
treatment data beyond 52 weeks was not available for evaluation. Hence, the product information 
provides clear advice and warnings with respect to BMD monitoring and specifically the need for a 
DEXA scan after 12 months therapy for all women. There is also a 6-month restriction, and restricted 
indication for the 200mg dose without ABT. Specialist prescription is also required given the relatively 
complex posology with 4 possible dosing options, and the need for careful risk assessment of and 
monitoring for BMD loss.  
Submitted safety studies support the clinical safety of linzagolix for the treatment of moderate to 
severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety:

A category 3, post-authorisation safety study will be conducted, with its main objective to collect data 
on BMD and to assess safety during long term (>12 months) use for linzagolix 200mg (with ABT) and 
100mg (with and without ABT) dosing regimens. 
In addition, a long-term follow-up study to assess bone mineral density in subjects with uterine fibroids 
from the completed phase 3 studies of linzagolix is on-going (PRIMROSE 3). 
 Risk Management Plan

 Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
 Product information 
 User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
 Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Yselty (linzagolix choline) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
 Therapeutic Context 
 Disease or condition 
Uterine fibroids are benign, monoclonal, hormone-sensitive, smooth muscle tumours of the uterus that 
occur during women’s reproductive years (Borahay, 2017). The primary symptoms are chronic heavy 
menstrual bleeding (which may be described as “gushing”-type bleeding [Wegienka, 2003]), 
abdominal and pelvic pressure, pelvic pain, bowel and bladder dysfunction including urinary frequency 
and incontinence, and abdominal protrusion. Fibroids are also associated with infertility, recurrent 
miscarriage, and for women with fibroids who attain pregnancy, impaired pregnancy outcomes 
including preterm delivery, breech presentation and low birthweight infants are increased (Shavell, 
2012; Lam, 2014; Parazzini, 2015). Anaemia is a common consequence of fibroid-related heavy 
bleeding, and for women with severe fibroids, can be life-threatening (Donnez, 2016; Stewart, 2015). 
Women with fibroids experience worse health-related quality of life than women without fibroids 
(Spies, 2005). In addition to causing substantial chronic and persistent physical morbidity, uterine 
fibroids are a frequent cause of significant long-term impairment of a wide range of aspects of quality 
of life (QoL), including self-image, interpersonal relationships and sexual function (Marsh, 2018; Borah, 
2013). 
The age-specific incidence and prevalence of fibroids is higher in Black women compared to women of 
other races (Stewart, 2017). Black women also typically develop more serious disease with heavier 
bleeding and larger and higher number of uterine fibroids. Women of African origin living in Europe 
also have more severe fibroid-related symptoms and have surgical interventions at younger ages 
compared to women of other races (Donnez, 2016). Thus, their morbidity from not only the disease 
but also from treatments including surgery tends to be greater overall compared to whites. 
 Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Uterine fibroids remain a challenging condition to treat. Although a number of medical approaches are 
used to treat symptomatic women, there is still a lack of effective therapies that can be used long 
term. Oral contraceptives and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are often used for treatment of 
uterine fibroids but are generally ineffective in reducing heavy bleeding. IUDs are often effective but 
have a high expulsion rate in women with fibroids and are contraindicated in women with substantial 
uterine cavity distortion. GnRH agonists (e.g., leuprorelin) are highly effective in reducing fibroid-
related bleeding, correcting anaemia, and reducing fibroid as well as uterine volume (Lethaby, 2001; 
Giuliani, 2020), however their use is limited to 6 months of treatment due to BMD loss. Esmya (5-mg 
ulipristal acetate), an effective SPRM has been associated with DILI and CHMP has recommended a 
change to its indication for use on this basis. Because of the lack of availability of long-term effective 
medical therapies, current treatment options for women with symptomatic uterine fibroids remain 
primarily surgical, and hysterectomies are still common in the EU. Safe and effective long-term medical 
therapies are needed.

 Main clinical studies 
 Favourable effects 
Primary endpoint 
In both phase 3 trials the primary endpoint was met. Subjects who met the primary endpoint had a 
menstrual blood loss of <80mls and >= 50% reduction in menstrual loss from baseline over the last 
28 days prior to week 24. 
In the pivotal clinical trials, at all doses (200mg and 100mg with and without add back therapy), there 
was a clinically relevant reduction in menstrual blood loss demonstrated. 
In PRIMROSE 1 USA trial, the proportions (95% CI) of subjects who met the requirements of the 
primary efficacy endpoints were 56.4% (45.8; 66.6), 66.4% (56.6; 75.2), 71.4% (61.8; 79.8) and 
75.5% (66.0; 83.5) in the 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT, 200 mg, and 200 mg with ABT groups, 
respectively, compared to 35.0% (25.8; 45.0) in placebo. All subjects achieved a decrease in 
menstrual loss over 2 cycles and a reduction of MBL of at least 50% over baseline. 
In the PRIMROSE 1 trial compared to placebo the percentage of additional subjects who responded to 
treatment was 21.4%, 32.3%, 36.4% & 40.5% treated with 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT, 200 mg, and 
200 mg with ABT groups, respectively. For the 100mg dose the lower boundary of the 95% CI overlaps 
with the upper boundary of the 95% CI for the placebo group.  
In the PRIMROSE 2 mainly EU trial, The proportions (95% CI) of subjects with reduced HMB were 
56.7% (46.3; 66.7), 77.2% (67.8; 85.0), 77.7% (68.4; 85.3) and 93.9% (87.1; 97.7) in the 100 mg, 
100 mg with ABT, 200 mg, and 200 mg with ABT groups respectively, compared to 29.4% (20.8; 
39.3) with placebo. 
In the PRIMROSE 2 trial compared to placebo the percentage of additional subjects who responded to 
treatment was 27.3 %, 47.8%, 48.3%, 64.5% treated with 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT, 200 mg, and 
200 mg with ABT groups, respectively.   
The highest percentage of responders was achieved in subjects treated with 200mg plus ABT. 
The responder rates across the two studies were generally similar, except in the 200 mg with ABT arm 
where the response rate of 93.9% (95% CI 87.1; 97.7) in PRIMROSE 2 was somewhat higher than the 
response rate 75.5% (95% CI 66.0; 83.5) observed in PRIMROSE 1. 
Secondary endpoints 
The secondary endpoints were supportive of the primary endpoint. 
Reduction & maintenance of reduction in MBL  
In PRIMROSE 1, in the first 28-day period, the proportion of subjects achieving reduced menstrual 
blood loss was 62% (95% CI 51; 72) for 100 mg and this proportion was approximately maintained 
until Week 24. In the other treatment groups, these proportions in the first 28 days were 56% (45; 
66) for 100 mg with ABT, 61% (51; 71) for 200 mg and 53% (43; 63) for 200 mg with ABT. 
These increased to about 80% in the second 28- day period and they were maintained up to week 24.  
In PRIMROSE 2, in the first 28-day period, the proportion was 56% (95% CI 46; 67) for 100 mg and 
this proportion was approximately maintained until week 24. In the other treatment groups, the 
proportions in the first 28 days were 47% (37; 58) for 100 mg with ABT, 61% (51; 71) for 200 mg 
and 63% (53; 73) for 200 mg with ABT.  
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 142/155 
 
  
 
 
These increased to about 90% in the second 28- day period and they were maintained up to week 24. 
Amenorrhoea 
In PRIMROSE 1, the proportions (95% CI) of subjects with amenorrhea were 38.3% (28.5; 48.9), 
42.1% (32.6; 52.0) , 60.0% (50.0; 69.4) and 57.8% (47.7; 67.6) in the 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT, 
200 mg and 200 mg with ABT groups respectively, compared to 21.4% (13.9; 30.5) in placebo.  
Similarly, in PRIMROSE 2, the proportions (95% CI, p value) of subjects with amenorrhea were 34.0% 
(24.7; 44.3), 63.4% (53.2; 72.7), 70.0% (61.1; 79.4) and 80.6% (71.4; 87.9) in the 100 mg, 100 mg 
with ABT, 200 mg and 200 mg with ABT groups respectively, compared to 11.8% (6.2; 19.6) in.  
For both 100 and 200 mg doses, there was no consistent effect of adding ABT on the rate of 
amenorrhea. 
Number of days of uterine bleeding 
In PRIMROSE 1, there was a significant reduction in the mean number of days of bleeding in all active 
treatment groups compared to placebo (p≤0.001). The mean number of days of bleeding were 2.2, 
2.2, 1.2, and 2.0 days in the 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT, 200 mg and 200 mg with ABT groups 
respectively, compared to 3.6 days in placebo. 
A similar pattern was observed in PRIMROSE 2, with a significant reduction in the mean number of 
days of bleeding in all active treatment groups compared to placebo (p≤0.001). The mean number of 
days of bleeding were 2.4, 1.6, 1.1 and 0.9 days in the 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT, 200 mg and 200 
mg with ABT groups respectively, compared to 4.1 days in placebo. 
Haemoglobin levels in anaemic subjects 
In subjects who were anaemic (Hb < 12 g/dL) at baseline (74% of subjects in PRIMROSE 1 and 57% 
of subjects in PRIMROSE 2), the mean baseline Hb level was about 10 g/dL across both studies. The 
magnitude and pattern of Hb increase in the linzagolix groups was similar across both studies. 
Mean ± SD increases in Hb levels after 24 weeks were 1.36 ± 1.64 g/dL in the 100 mg group, 1.88 ± 
1.56 g/dL in the 100 mg with ABT group, 2.16 ± 1.66 g/dL in the 200 mg group and 2.13 ± 1.52 g/dL 
in the 200 mg with ABT group compared to 0.34 ± 1.62 g/dL with placebo. 
There was a significant improvement compared to placebo in Hb levels by Week 24 (p<0.001) in all 
treatment groups in both studies except for 100 mg in PRIMROSE 1 (p=0.019). In the pooled analysis, 
all active treatment groups were significantly improved compared to placebo (p≤0.002). 
Pain 
Pain was assessed for the previous 4-weeks using a 0–10 numerical rating scale at the Week 12 and 
24 site visits 
The mean ± SD baseline pain score was 6.5 ± 2.6 in PRIMROSE 1 and 4.8 ± 2.8 in PRIMROSE 2. There 
were reductions in pain scores in all linzagolix groups compared to placebo (p≤0.002) in both studies 
and the pooled population. 
Fibroid volume 
The estimated mean (95% CI) ratio of volume at Week 24 to baseline was 0.52 (0.45; 0.59) in the 
pooled population indicating an approximately 48% reduction in fibroid volume at 24 weeks. 
In PRIMROSE 1, the mean ratio was 0.55 (0.45; 0.68) and in PRIMROSE 2, it was 0.51 (0.41; 0.63).  
There were smaller reductions in fibroid volume in the 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT and 200 mg with ABT 
groups. The estimated mean (95% CI) ratios in the pooled population were 0.75 (0.65; 0.87), 0.85 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 143/155 
 
  
 
 
(0.73; 0.98) and 0.78 (0.67; 0.90), respectively, corresponding to an approximately 35%, 15% and 
22% reduction in fibroid volume at Week 24, respectively.  
There were no meaningful changes in fibroid volume in the placebo group.  
Quality of Life  
There was a marked increase in the HRQL total score in the linzagolix groups compared to placebo in 
both studies. In the pooled population, the estimated mean (95% CI) increase was 21.9 (18.1; 25.6) 
in the 100 mg group, 28.1 (24.4; 31.7) in the 100 mg with ABT group, 32.1 (28.5; 35.6) in the 200 
mg group and 31.5 (27.9; 35.2) in the 200 mg with ABT group compared to 13.0 (9.4; 16.6) in the 
placebo group. 
Persistence of Efficacy 
The persistence of efficacy was assessed in PRIMROSE 2 in subjects who continued treatment after 24 
weeks up to 52 weeks of treatment. Persistence of efficacy could be directly assessed in the 100 mg, 
100 mg with ABT and 200 mg with ABT groups as these subjects continued on the same dose between 
24 and 52 weeks. 
The proportion of subjects with reduced menstrual blood loss was maintained or increased at Week 52 
compared to Week 24. At Week 52 the proportion (95% CI) of subjects with reduced menstrual blood 
loss was 53% (42; 65), 91% (83; 96) and 92% (83; 97) in the 100 mg, 100 mg with ABT and 200 mg 
with ABT groups respectively. In the subjects who switched from 200 mg to 200 mg + ABT at 24 
weeks, the proportion of subjects with reduced MBL was also maintained; 85% (76; 92) at Week 52 
compared to 78% (68; 85) at Week 24 (Figure 2.7.3-18). In the subjects who switched from placebo 
to 200 mg with ABT at 24 weeks, the proportion (95% CI) of subjects with reduced MBL was 83% (74; 
90) at Week 52.  
 Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
One of the advantages of the product is that it can be used without hormonal add back therapy in 
women who do not want to take hormonal therapy or who have a contraindication to add back 
hormonal therapy. However, the best response to treatment (i.e. the greatest number of responders 
who achieved the primary efficacy endpoint) with the lowest risk of bone loss due to treatment was in 
the group treated with 200mg and ABT.  
Approximately 30% of the placebo group met the primary efficacy endpoint. A placebo effect of 30% 
was assumed for the sample size estimates based on previous studies.There was a statistically 
significant difference in treatment effect for all groups treated compared to the placebo group but the 
confidence interval for the lower bound of % responders for the 100mg dose overlaps with the upper 
bound of the percentage responders in the placebo group in the PRIMROSE 1 trial and is close to the 
lower limit of the CI in PRIMROSE 2.  
It is unclear given the mechanism of action, why the responder rate is different for Black subjects in 
the PRIMROSE 1 trial. The responder rates across the two studies were generally similar, except in the 
200 mg with ABT arm where the response rate of 93.9% (95% CI 87.1; 97.7) in PRIMROSE 2 was 
somewhat higher than the response rate 75.5% (95% CI 66.0; 83.5) observed in PRIMROSE 1.  
Based on the data provided, there may be a limit to the length of time patients can be treated due to 
the potential bone loss with prolonged treatment.  
While all doses and treatment groups met the primary endpoint, the effect of treatment on Fibroid size 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 144/155 
 
  
 
 
 
was limited and was greatest for the 200mg dose. The effects on fibroid size of the 200mg dose were 
reversed when ABT was added after 6 months Treatment with 200mg without ABT leads to reduction in 
BMD and treatment should be limited to a maximum of 6 months.   
 Unfavourable effects 
In general, the safety profile is in keeping with predicted toxicities for a GnRH antagonist, and overall 
was tolerated well; few SAEs were reported, and discontinuations due to AEs in all arms were low. 
Toxicities that are linked to oestrogen suppression, such as flushes (and night sweats etc), bone 
mineral density loss are seen in all linzagolix based regimes, but show a clear dose dependence and an 
ABT attenuation effect, with the highest effects seen in the 200mg dose. Up to week 24, the linzagolix 
200mg monotherapy arm had the highest rate of TEAEs reported (63.3%) as well as the highest rate 
of severe TEAEs (7.1%), and the highest rate of AE related discontinuations (10.5%). Less subjects 
reported TEAEs between week 24 and week 52, when all patients were on linzagolix in some form, and 
when most also were receiving linzagolix with ABT (apart from the linzagolix 100mg arm).  
Hot flushes was the most common TEAE at 12.7% of patients overall in the first treatment period and 
there was a clear dose exposure response and ABT attenuation effect: 33% in the linzagolix 200mg 
arm v 9.6% in the linzagolix 200mg + ABT arm, and a comparable 10.1% in the linzagolix 100mg 
monotherapy arm (approx. 5% in both the linzagolix 100mg + ABT arm and placebo arms). Of note, 
hot flushes may ease with time, as this was reported much less frequently from week 24.  
Headache was approximately twice as frequent in the linzagolix 200mg monotherapy group (11.9%) 
compared to the other arms including placebo (5.7%), which could also suggest a dose exposure 
response with respect to oestradiol depletion. Headache was also much less common after 24 weeks 
(<1%).  
Bone Mineral Density loss was seen in all linzagolix treatment arms patients, and there is a trend of 
dose dependence, with ABT attenuating some of the loss. At 24 weeks the greatest reduction was in 
the linzagolix 200mg group at -3.697%, followed by the Linzagolix 100mg group at approx. -2%, and 
with the smallest reduction(of similar magnitude) in the Linzagolix 200mg + ABT, and Linzagolix 
100mg + ABT groups (- 1.129% and -0.963% reduction respectively). This supports the rationale of 
the optimal regime being a regime with ABT, i.e. the 200mg linzagolix + ABT regime. BMD 
measurements at 52 weeks indicate that a slower rate of bone loss occurs after 24 weeks. It was also 
noted that patients who were treated for 24 weeks on 200mg, and then moved to 200mg + ABT 
appear to regain some of the BMD lost, approximately 1% was regained by week 52. There are follow-
up, off treatment week 76 BMD results available from PRIMROSE 1 and 2 (after women stopped 
therapy at 52 weeks) which point to at least a partial recovery of the BMD lost, in a majority of the 
women, however the numbers involved are small. A separate small dataset of follow up BMD 
assessment is available for the women that had to leave the PRIMROSE studies on account of meeting 
the BMD loss discontinuation criteria (DEXA was performed 6 months after stopping therapy). The data 
suggest a trend of reversibility or partial reversibility by 6 months after stopping trial therapy. 
Approximately 30% had recovery up to -3% BMD loss, and another 50% had a more partial recovery 
by 6 months. While 5/17 (30%) women did not show any recovery, 2 of these women were in fact on 
placebo.  
Hepatic enzyme increases, particularly transaminases, were common; up to Week 24, 4.8% 
reported TEAEs of LFT increases, of any grade. Generally, the rises were reversible, either on stopping 
therapy, or conservative monitoring. The majority of these were low grade rises. There were also no 
cases of Hy’s law.

Lipid parameters 
Linzagolix does seem to influence the lipid profile, with increases across all the lipid/cholesterol 
parameters including HDL, LDL, triglycerides and total cholesterol; with the most significant increases 
in the 200mg group. At Week 24 there was an approximately 5% increase in HDL cholesterol, 22% 
increase in LDL cholesterol, 15% increase in total cholesterol, and 29% increase in triglycerides in the 
200 mg arm.  
Depression and mood disorders, including suicidality 
Overall, there were low incidences of low mood, depression and anxiety reported with no 
deaths/suicides or SAEs. There is an overall trend to increased mood disorders in the linzagolix treated 
groups versus placebo when the broader term mood disorders are considered, i.e. including mood 
swings, affect lability, emotional disorder, anxiety, depression, depressed mood, irritability and affect 
altered. It also needs to be considered that ABT may also be an independent contributing factor in 
some cases as estrogen/progesterone have been reported to cause low mood or aggravation of 
depression. 
Failure to recognise pregnancy 
Linzagolix may induce changed bleeding patterns, including amenorrhoea, which may limit a woman’s 
ability to detect pregnancy; this is particular relevance as there are important potential risks to a 
pregnancy/foetus for linzagolix, and given that linzagolix by itself will not satisfactorily guarantee 
contraception.  
Potential for QT prolongation   
QTc prolongation was observed in the TQT study. Mean placebo-corrected change from baseline QT 
(ddQTcF) for the 2 linzagolix dose groups revealed upper bounds of the 90%, 2-sided CI of 10.23 and 
11.81 msec for the 200 mg and 700 mg dose at 3 hours after administration, respectively.  
 Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Missing BMD data 
It is noted that there is a high rate of missing BMD measurements at week 24 and at week 52, for both 
pivotal studies. It has been clarified that much of the missing measurements are in fact due to the 
dropout rate rather than data being missing per se. For example, across both studies 367/1037 of 
week 24 BMD assessments were missing (lumbar spine) and of these 252/367 (68.7%) were due to 
patient withdrawal, and as such are not truly missing data, rather a reflection of the dropout rate. The 
clinical characteristics of the subjects missing week 24 BMD data and those with week 24 BMD data are 
very similar. Baseline BMD measurements in the ‘missing data group’ are similar to those who do have 
valid week 24 measurements. It is also agreed that the ‘missing’ data does not seem to occur more 
frequently in any one treatment arm. Overall, while the fact that we have a considerable number of 
patients without follow-up DEXA is not ideal, the main reason is due to the dropout rate.  
Longer term treatment  
Safety data for continued (> 52 weeks) linzagolix treatment at any dose/regime was not available at 
the time of the assessment. This was particularly a concern due to the effect of linzagolix on BMD. 
While it was acknowledged that there appears to be some slowing of the rate of bone loss in the 24-52 
week period, the rate of continued BMD loss with treatment for > 52 weeks is not known, and it cannot 
EMA/266814/2022  
Page 146/155 
 
  
 
 
 
 
be assumed that no further deterioration will occur. Sustained loss of BMD even at a slow rate may 
become significant over a number of years, and women with baseline risk for BMD loss, and those 
unable to take ABT (i.e. on the 100mg dose) are most at risk. The effect of longer-term treatment on 
other important outcomes such as venous thromboembolism, other thrombotic events, malignancy, 
endometrial changes etc. is also unknown. The long-term safety profile will be further characterised 
through category 3 safety studies planned for the post-authorisation setting. 
BMD loss in women with baseline low BMD or risk factors for BMD 
In the pivotal studies women were excluded at baseline if they had a significant risk for or history of 
osteoporosis, and thus the study population may reflect a group less susceptible to bone loss than the 
real-world population. It is not known if women with a low BMD baseline or with risk factors for BMD 
loss may experience greater bone loss than seen in the pivotal studies. In this context it is noted that 
in the Japanese phase 2 endometriosis study, women with baseline low BMD or risk factors were not 
excluded, (and Asian women are known to be at increased risk of BMD loss) a more significant 
decrease in BMD at 24 weeks was seen than in the pivotal studies: -3.54% at the 100mg dose, at the 
lumbar spine. Low body weight, use of steroids, malabsorption, smoking, family history, and ethnicity 
(Asian and Caucasian women) are all factors known to increase a woman’s risk of osteoporosis.  
Reversibility of BMD loss 
There are some data to suggest at least partial reversibility of BMD lost in most women at 24 weeks 
after stopping treatment, however the numbers involved are small. It is also notable that in all 
treatment groups the mean BMD did not return to baseline after 24 weeks off treatment, and the 
100mg dose in particular showed the least recovery. It is currently unknown if all women will regain 
the BMD lost, and how long that might take.  
Potential for QT prolongation   
QTc prolongation was observed in the TQT study. Mean placebo-corrected change from baseline QT 
(ddQTcF) for the 2 linzagolix dose groups revealed upper bounds of the 90%, 2-sided CI of 10.23 and 
11.81 msec for the 200 mg and 700 mg dose at 3 hours after administration, respectively. This 
concern was further compounded by the apparent high rate of missing ECG data, which was later 
explained. The concern regarding QTc prolongation observed in the TQT study has been addressed in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC.

 Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
 Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Linzagolix was evaluated in the pivotal trial at two doses, 100mg and 200mg, with or without ABT (add 
back hormonal therapy). 
The highest responder rate in both pivotal trials was in the group treated with 200mg plus ABT. This 
was supported by the findings in the analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoints where this dose 
resulted in a greater reduction in mean menstrual blood loss and number of days of bleeding.  The 
SmPC posology has been updated to clarify the starting dose could be 100mg or, if needed, 200mg 
plus ABT. Section 4.2 also outlines the indications and restrictions for prescribing a dose of 200mg, 
and 100mg. 
It is clear from the 52 weeks of data available that all doses of linzagolix have the potential to 
negatively impact BMD. The rate of continued BMD loss with treatment for > 52 weeks is not known, 
and it cannot be assumed that no further deterioration will occur with longer term treatment. 
Sustained loss of BMD even at a slow rate such as 1-2% per annum may become significant for some 
women over a number of years, and particularly for women with other risk factors for BMD loss. The 
full extent of the reversibility of the BMD loss effect is also currently unknown.  Therefore, the agreed 
product information makes very clear this risk, and provides clear dose specific guidance on how to 
monitor for bone loss, and how to manage those with additional risk factors for developing 
osteoporosis.  
Aside from bone safety, overall linzagolix with and without ABT was generally well tolerated, and the 
toxicities in the main is considered manageable.

 Balance of benefits and risks 
The relevant SmPC sections describe the concerns related to the BMD loss, and warnings and 
monitoring recommendations. There is an uncertainty as to the rate and extent of BMD loss with 
continued use (> 12 months), as there are no on treatment data beyond week 52. However, given that 
the rate of BMD loss did seem to slow from week 24-52, and given that the use of linzagolix is 
recommended for specialist use,  the benefit risk of the 4 proposed dosing regimens are positive for 
the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) associated with uterine fibroids in adult women of 
reproductive age.   
 Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
In the pivotal 2-year rat carcinogenicity study conducted, a statistically significant increase in the 
incidence of uterine endometrial adenocarcinoma was detected by trend test in the mid (50 mg/kg; 
4 % incidence) and high (500 mg/kg; 16.7 % incidence) dose and was also statistically significant in 
pairwise comparison relative to the saline (0 % incidence) (but not methylcellulose vehicle; 4% 
incidence) control group. A statistically significant increase in the incidence of mammary gland 
adenocarcinoma was evident in the mid-dose group (28.3 %) by pairwise comparison to the both 
control groups (10 and 11 % for saline and vehicle control respectively). This was in excess of the 
range of historical control data for the test facility (range of 7-20 %). A separate dedicated report was 
provided, discussing possible mechanistic reasons for these findings (see non-clinical toxicology 
discussion).  While there is no signal with respect to endometrial adenocarcinoma or breast cancer in 
the clinical data, the significance of these animal findings is not certain, and this risk has now been 
added to the summary of safety concerns. 
 Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Yselty is positive.   
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the  benefit-risk  balance  of  Yselty    is  favourable  in  the  following  indication:  Yselty  is  indicated  for  the 
treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation  subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription.  
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation.

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that linzagolix choline is to be 
qualified as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union. 
Refer to Appendix on new active substance (NAS).

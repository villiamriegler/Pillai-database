CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Cablivi is indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents of 12 years of age and older weighing 
at least 40 kg experiencing an episode of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP), in 
conjunction with plasma exchange and immunosuppression. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Treatment with Cablivi should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the 
management of patients with thrombotic microangiopathies.  
Posology 
First dose 
Intravenous injection of 10 mg of caplacizumab prior to plasma exchange.  
Subsequent doses 
Daily subcutaneous administration of 10 mg of caplacizumab after completion of each plasma 
exchange for the duration of daily plasma exchange treatment, followed by daily subcutaneous 
injection of 10 mg of caplacizumab for 30 days after stopping daily plasma exchange treatment. 
If at the end of this period there is evidence of unresolved immunological disease, it is recommended 
to optimise the immunosuppression regimen and continue daily subcutaneous administration of 10 mg 
of caplacizumab until the signs of underlying immunological disease are resolved (e.g. sustained 
normalisation of ADAMTS13 activity level).

In the clinical development program, caplacizumab has been administered daily for up to 71 days 
consecutively. Data on re-treatment with caplacizumab are available (see section 5.1).  
Missed dose 
If a dose of Cablivi is missed, it can be administered within 12 hours. If more than 12 
hours have passed since the dose was to have been given, the missed dose should NOT be 
administered and the next dose should be administered per the usual dosing schedule. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).  
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). See section 4.4 
for special considerations in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Elderly 
While experience with the use of caplacizumab in the elderly is limited, there is no evidence to suggest 
that dose adjustment or special precautions are needed for elderly patients (see section 5.2).  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of caplacizumab in the paediatric population have not been established in 
clinical studies. The posology of Cablivi in adolescents of 12 years of age and older weighing at least 
40 kg is the same as in adults (see section 5.2). No recommendations can be made on the posology of 
Cablivi for paediatric patients below 40 kg of body weight.  
Method of administration  
The first dose of Cablivi is to be administered as an intravenous injection. Subsequent doses are to be 
administered via subcutaneous injection in the abdomen.  
Injections into the area around the navel should be avoided and consecutive injections should not be 
administered in the same abdominal quadrant. 
Patients or caregivers may inject the medicinal product after proper training in the subcutaneous 
injection technique.  
For instructions on reconstitution of Cablivi before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

Bleeding 
Cablivi increases the risk of bleeding. Cases of major bleeding, including life-threatening and fatal 
bleeding have been reported in patients receiving caplacizumab, mainly in those using concomitant 
anti-platelet agents or anticoagulants. Caplacizumab should be used with caution in patients with 
underlying conditions that may predispose them to a higher risk of bleeding 
In case of clinically significant bleeding, treatment with Cablivi should be interrupted. If needed, the 
use of von Willebrand Factor concentrate could be considered to correct hemostasis. Cablivi should 
only be restarted upon the advice of a physician experienced in the management of thrombotic 
microangiopathies. If Cablivi is restarted, monitor closely for signs of bleeding. 
In the setting of concomitant use of oral anticoagulants, anti-platelet agents, thrombolytic agents or 
heparin  
The risk of bleeding is increased with concomitant use of Cablivi with other medicinal products 
affecting hemostasis and coagulation. Initiation or continuation of treatment with oral anticoagulants 
(e.g., vitamin K antagonists or direct oral anticoagulants [DOAC] such as thrombin inhibitors or factor 
Xa inhibitors), anti-platelet agents, thrombolytic agents such as urokinase, tissue plasminogen 
activator (t-PA) (e.g. alteplase) or heparin requires careful consideration and close clinical monitoring.  
In patients with coagulopathies 
Due to a potential increased risk of bleeding, use of Cablivi in patients with underlying coagulopathies 
(e.g. hemophilia, other coagulation factor deficiencies) must be accompanied by close clinical 
monitoring. 
In patients undergoing surgery 
If a patient is to undergo elective surgery, an invasive dental procedure or other invasive interventions, 
the patient must be advised to inform the physician or dentist that they are using caplacizumab and it is 
recommended to withhold treatment for at least 7 days before the planned intervention. The patient 
must also notify the physician who supervises the treatment with caplacizumab about the planned 
procedure. After the risk of surgical bleeding has resolved, and caplacizumab is resumed, the patient 
should be monitored closely for signs of bleeding. 
If emergency surgery is needed, the use of von Willebrand Factor concentrate is recommended to 
correct haemostasis. 
Severe hepatic impairment 
No formal study with caplacizumab has been conducted in patients with severe acute or chronic 
hepatic impairment and no data regarding the use of caplacizumab in these populations are available. 
Use of Cablivi in this population requires a benefit/risk assessment and close clinical monitoring. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
No interaction studies evaluating use of caplacizumab with oral anticoagulants (e.g. vitamin K 
antagonists, direct oral anticoagulants [DOAC] such as thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors), 
antiplatelet agents, thrombolytic agents such as urokinase, tPA (e.g. alteplase) or heparin have been 
performed (see section 4.4 In the setting of concomitant use of oral anticoagulants, anti-platelet 
agents, thrombolytic agents or heparin).

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There are no data on the use of caplacizumab in pregnant women. Studies in guinea pigs showed no 
effect of caplacizumab on the dams or foetuses (see section 5.3).  
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Cablivi during pregnancy. 
Breastfeeding 
There are no data on the use of caplacizumab in breastfeeding women. It is unknown whether 
caplacizumab is excreted in human milk. A risk to the child cannot be excluded.  
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or to abstain/discontinue from therapy, 
taking into account the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
The effects of caplacizumab on fertility in humans are unknown. In animal toxicology studies, no 
impact of caplacizumab on male and female fertility parameters was observed (see section 5.3).  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Cablivi has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
4.8 
Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Bleeding  
In clinical studies, bleeding events occurred in different body systems, independent of treatment 
duration. In the postmarketing setting, cases of major bleeding, including life-threatening and fatal 
bleeding have been reported in patients receiving caplacizumab, mainly in those using concomitant 
anti-platelet agents or anticoagulants. In case of clinically significant bleeding, consider actions 
outlined in sections 4.4 and 4.9.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
In case of overdose, based on the pharmacological action of caplacizumab, there is the potential for an 
increased risk of bleeding. Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of bleeding is recommended. 
(see section 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other antithrombotic agents, ATC code: B01AX07. 
Mechanism of action 
Caplacizumab is a humanised bivalent Nanobody that consists of two identical humanised building 
blocks (PMP12A2hum1), genetically linked by a three-alanine linker, targeting the A1-domain of von 
Willebrand factor and inhibiting the interaction between von Willebrand factor and platelets. As such, 
caplacizumab prevents the ultra large von Willebrand factor-mediated platelet adhesion, which is 
characteristic of aTTP. It also affects the disposition of von Willebrand factor, leading to transient 
reductions of total von Willebrand factor antigen levels and to concomitant reduction of factor VIII:C 
levels during treatment. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Target inhibition 
The pharmacologic effect of caplacizumab on target inhibition was assessed using two biomarkers for 
von Willebrand factor activity; ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA) and ristocetin cofactor 
(RICO). Full inhibition of von Willebrand factor-mediated platelet aggregation by caplacizumab is 
indicated by RIPA and RICO levels dropping below 10% and 20%, respectively. All clinical studies 
with caplacizumab demonstrated rapid decreases in RIPA and/or RICO levels after the start of the 
treatment, with recovery to baseline levels within 7 days of discontinuation. The 10 mg subcutaneous 
dose in patients with aTTP elicited full inhibition of von Willebrand factor-mediated platelet 
aggregation, as evidenced by RICO levels of < 20% throughout the treatment period. 
Target disposition 
The pharmacologic effect of caplacizumab on target disposition was measured using von Willebrand 
factor antigen and factor VIII clotting activity (factor VIII:C) as biomarkers. Upon repeated 
administration of caplacizumab, a decrease of 30-50% in von Willebrand factor antigen levels was 
observed in clinical studies, reaching a maximum within 1-2 days of treatment. Because von 
Willebrand factor acts as a carrier for factor VIII, reduced von Willebrand factor antigen levels 
resulted in a similar reduction in factor VIII:C levels. The reduced von Willebrand factor antigen and 
FVIII:C levels were transient and returned to baseline upon cessation of treatment. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of caplacizumab in adults experiencing an episode of aTTP were established 
in 3 randomised, controlled studies: Phase III study ALX0681-C301 “HERCULES”, Phase III study 
ALX0681-C302 “Post-HERCULES” and Phase II study ALX-0681-2.1/10 “TITAN”.  
Efficacy 
Study ALX0681-C301 (HERCULES)  
In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with an episode of aTTP were randomised 1:1 
to receive either caplacizumab or placebo in addition to daily plasma exchange and 
immunosuppression. Patients received a single intravenous bolus injection of 10 mg caplacizumab or 
placebo prior to the first plasma exchange on study. This was followed by daily subcutaneous 
injections of 10 mg caplacizumab or placebo after completion of each plasma exchange for the 
duration of the daily plasma exchange period and for 30 days thereafter. If at the end of this treatment 
period there was evidence of persistent underlying disease activity (indicative of an imminent risk for 
recurrence), treatment could be extended weekly for a maximum of 4 weeks, together with 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
optimisation of immunosuppression. If a recurrence occurred while on study drug treatment, patients 
were switched to open-label caplacizumab. They were again treated for the duration of daily plasma 
exchange and for 30 days thereafter. If at the end of this treatment period there was evidence of 
ongoing underlying disease, open-label treatment with caplacizumab could be extended weekly for a 
maximum of 4 weeks, together with optimisation of immunosuppression. Patients were followed for 1 
month after discontinuation of treatment. In case of recurrence during the follow up period (i.e. after 
all study drug treatment had been stopped), there was no re-initiation of study drug and the recurrence 
was to be treated according to the standard of care. 
In this study, 145 patients experiencing an episode of aTTP were randomised (72 to caplacizumab and 
73 to placebo). Patient age ranged from 18 to 79 years, with a mean of 46 years. Half of the patients 
were experiencing their first episode of aTTP. Baseline disease characteristics were typical of aTTP.  
The median treatment duration with caplacizumab in the double blind period was 35 days. 
Treatment with caplacizumab resulted in a statistically significant reduction in time to platelet count 
response (p<0.01). Patients treated with caplacizumab were 1.55 times more likely to achieve platelet 
count response at any given time point, compared to patients treated with placebo.  
Treatment with caplacizumab resulted in a 74% reduction in the composite endpoint of the percentage 
of patients with aTTP-related death (0/72; placebo 3/73), exacerbation of aTTP (3/72; placebo 28/73), 
or at least one major thromboembolic event during study drug treatment (6/72; placebo 6/73) 
(p<0.0001). There were no deaths in the caplacizumab group and 3 deaths in the placebo group during 
the study drug treatment period. 
The proportion of patients with a recurrence of aTTP (exacerbation or relapse) in the overall study 
period (including the 28 day follow-up after discontinuation of study drug treatment) was 67% lower 
in the caplacizumab group (9/72; relapse : 6/72) compared to the placebo group (28/73; relapse 0/73) 
(p<0.001). 
No patients treated with caplacizumab (0/72) were refractory to treatment (defined as absence of 
platelet count doubling after 4 days of standard treatment and elevated LDH) compared to three 
patients treated with placebo (3/73).  
Treatment with caplacizumab reduced the mean number of days of plasma exchange, the volume of 
plasma used, the mean length of Intensive Care Unit stay and the mean length of hospitalization 
during the study drug treatment period.

Study ALX0681-C302 (Post-HERCULES) 
The Post-HERCULES study was a Phase III, 36-month follow-up study from HERCULES (parent 
study) to evaluate the long-term outcomes as well as the safety and efficacy of repeat use of 
caplacizumab in patients who experienced a recurrence of aTTP. Overall, 104 out of 108 patients who 
completed the parent study (75 who received caplacizumab in HERCULES, of whom 49 did not have 
aTTP recurrences prior to the enrollment in Post-HERCULES, and 29 who had received only standard 
8 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of care (SoC) in HERCULES) entered the Post-HERCULES study in which patients attended twice 
yearly visits. Patients could receive open-label (OL) caplacizumab for the treatment of an aTTP 
recurrence along with SoC. 
Overall, 19 patients had at least 1 recurrence of aTTP and six patients had a 2nd recurrence. For 
patients treated with caplacizumab for a recurrence, all events of aTTP from the first recurrence 
episode were resolved or were resolving at the end of the study.  
The overall safety profile of caplacizumab re-treatment was consistent with that observed in other 
clinical studies of aTTP. 
Immunogenicity 
In clinical studies, up to 11% of patients developed treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA). 
No impact on clinical efficacy was observed and no serious adverse events were found to be 
associated with these ADA responses. 
Paediatric population 
See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use and section 5.2 for results of modelling and 
simulation studies for paediatric patients. There are no clinical data for paediatric patients. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
The pharmacokinetics of caplacizumab have been investigated in healthy subjects after single 
intravenous infusions and after single and repeated subcutaneous injections. Pharmacokinetics in 
patients with aTTP were investigated upon single intravenous and repeated subcutaneous injections.  
Pharmacokinetics of caplacizumab appear as non-dose proportional, as characterized by target-
mediated disposition. In healthy volunteers receiving 10 mg caplacizumab subcutaneously once daily, 
the maximum concentration was observed at 6-7 hours post-dose and steady-state was reached 
following the first administration, with minimal accumulation.  
Absorption 
After subcutaneous administration, caplacizumab is rapidly and almost completely absorbed 
(estimated F> 0.901) in the systemic circulation. 
Distribution 
After absorption, caplacizumab binds to the target and distributes to well perfused organs. In patients 
with aTTP the central volume of distribution was estimated at 6.33 L. 
Biotransformation/Elimination 
The pharmacokinetics of caplacizumab depend on the expression of the target von Willebrand factor. 
Higher levels of von Willebrand factor antigen, such as in patients with aTTP, increase the fraction of 
drug-target complex retained in the circulation. The t1/2 of caplacizumab is, therefore, concentration- 
and target level-dependent. Target-bound caplacizumab is assumed to be catabolised within the liver, 
whereas unbound caplacizumab is assumed to be renally cleared. 
Characteristics in specific groups 
The pharmacokinetics of caplacizumab were determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis 
on pooled pharmacokinetic data. Body weight was allometrically included in the model. Differences in 
the different subpopulations were investigated. In studied populations; gender, age, blood group and 
race did not affect the pharmacokinetics of caplacizumab.

Renal or hepatic impairment 
No formal study of the effect of hepatic or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of caplacizumab 
has been conducted. In the population PK/PD model, renal function (CRCL) had a statistically 
significant effect resulting in limited increase in predicted exposure (AUCss) in severe renal 
impairment. In the clinical studies of patients with TTP, those with renal impairment did not show 
additional risk of adverse events.   
Paediatric population  
Based on data pooled from clinical studies in adults, a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) 
population model was developed, describing the interaction between caplacizumab and von 
Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag), in different adult populations following intravenous and 
subcutaneous administration of caplacizumab at various dose levels. For children aged 2 to below 18 
years of age, simulations were performed based on this PK/PD model predicting that exposure and 
suppression of vWF:Ag are expected to be similar to those in adults when 10 mg/day is used in 
children with a bodyweight of ≥40 kg, and when 5 mg/day is used in children with a bodyweight of 
<40 kg.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Consistent with its mode of action, toxicology studies of caplacizumab have shown an increased 
bleeding tendency in guinea pigs (haemorrhagic subcutaneous tissue at the injection sites) and 
cynomolgus monkeys (haemorrhagic subcutaneous tissue at the injection sites, nose bleed, 
exaggerated menstrual bleeding, haematoma at sites of animal handling or experimental procedures, 
prolonged bleeding at injection sites). Furthermore, pharmacology-related decreases of von 
Willebrand factor antigen, and consequently factor VIII:C, were noted in cynomolgus monkeys and, to 
a lesser extent for factor VIII:C, in guinea pigs. 
An embryo-foetal development study was conducted in guinea pigs, with no reported signs of toxicity. 
A follow-up toxicokinetic study in pregnant guinea pigs assessed exposure of caplacizumab in the 
dams and foetuses. The results indicated exposure to caplacizumab in dams and, to a much lesser 
extent, foetuses, with no reported effects on foetal development. Foetal exposure to caplacizumab in 
primates and humans remains uncertain, as proteins lacking an Fc portion are not thought to freely 
pass the placental barrier. 
No studies have been performed to evaluate the mutagenic potential of caplacizumab, as such tests are 
not relevant for biologicals. Based on a carcinogenicity risk assessment, dedicated studies were not 
deemed necessary.  
Dedicated animal studies assessing the effects of caplacizumab on male and female fertility have not 
been performed. In repeat-dose toxicity tests in cynomolgus monkeys, no impact of caplacizumab on 
fertility parameters in male (testicular size, sperm function, histopathological analysis of testis and 
epididymis) and female (histopathological analysis of reproductive organs, periodic vaginal cytology) 
animals was observed.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Cablivi is and what it is used for  
Cablivi contains the active substance caplacizumab. It is used to treat an episode of acquired 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in adults and adolescents of 12 years of age and older 
weighing at least 40 kg. This is a rare blood clotting disorder in which clots form in small blood 
vessels. These clots can block blood vessels and damage the brain, heart, kidneys, or other organs. 
Cablivi prevents the formation of these blood clots by stopping platelets in the blood from clumping 
together. By doing so, Cablivi reduces the risk of experiencing another episode of aTTP soon after the 
first.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Cablivi  
Do not use Cablivi 
• 
if you are allergic to caplacizumab or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
Warnings and precautions  
Tell your doctor if you:  
• 
bleed excessively or experience unusual symptoms such as headache, shortness of breath, 
tiredness, or fainting which may indicate serious internal bleeding. Your doctor may ask you to 
stop the treatment. The doctor will say when you can start your treatment again. 
are using medicines that prevent or treat blood clots such as warfarin, heparin, rivaroxaban, 
apixaban. Your doctor will decide how you should be treated.  
are using anti-platelet agents such as aspirin, or low molecular weight heparin (which prevent 
blood clots). Your doctor will decide how you should be treated.  
have a bleeding disorder such as haemophilia. Your doctor will decide how you should be 
treated. 
have severely reduced liver function. Your doctor will decide how you should be treated.

or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Treatment with Cablivi is started by a doctor experienced in blood disorders.  
The recommended treatment is 
• 
first dose 
- 1 vial injected into a vein by a healthcare professional  
- the medicine will be given before starting plasma exchange. 
• 
subsequent doses 
-  1 vial once daily as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin of the belly)  
-  the subcutaneous injection will be given after each daily plasma exchange   
-  after the daily plasma exchange finishes, your treatment with Cablivi will continue for at least 
30 days with injection of 1 vial once daily  
-  your doctor may ask you to continue daily treatment until the underlying signs of your disease 
are resolved. 
Your doctor may decide that you or your caregiver may inject Cablivi. In this case, your doctor or 
healthcare provider will train you or your caregiver on how to use Cablivi. 
Instructions for use  
The first injection of Cablivi into your vein must be given by a healthcare professional. Instructions 
for healthcare professionals on how to inject Cablivi into your vein are at the end of the leaflet. 
For each injection, use a fresh kit package to prepare the injection solution. Do not try to inject Cablivi 
until you have been taught how to do so by a healthcare professional. Never use the kit for another 
injection. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 1 - Cleaning  
•  Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. 
• 
• 
Prepare a clean flat surface for placing the kit package. 
Make sure you have a disposal container at hand. 
Step 2 - Before use  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Make sure the kit package is complete. 
Check the expiry date. Do not use if the expiry date has passed.  
Do not use the kit if the packaging or the items in it are damaged in any way. 
Place all components of the kit on the clean flat surface.  
If the kit was not stored at room temperature, allow the vial and the syringe to reach room 
temperature (15°C – 25°C) by letting them stand at room temperature for a few minutes. Do not 
warm them up in any other way. 
Step 3 - Disinfect the rubber stopper  
• 
Remove the plastic flip-off cap from the vial. Do not use the vial if the green plastic cap is 
missing. 
Clean the exposed rubber stopper using one of the alcohol pads provided and allow it to dry for 
a few seconds. 
After cleaning, do not touch the rubber stopper or allow it to touch any surface.  
• 
• 
Step 4 - Attaching the adapter  
• 
Take the packed vial adapter and remove the paper cover. Leave the adapter in its opened 
plastic packaging. Do not touch the adapter itself.  
• 
• 
Place the adapter over the vial, while keeping the adapter in its plastic packaging. 
Press down firmly until the adapter snaps into place, with the adapter spike going through the 
vial stopper. Leave the adapter attached to the vial, still in its outer packaging. 
31 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Step 5 - Prepare the syringe  
• 
• 
Holding the syringe in your hand, break off the white cap with your other hand.  
Do not use the syringe if this white cap is missing, loose or damaged. 
• 
• 
Do not touch the syringe tip or allow it to come into contact with any surfaces. 
Place the syringe on the clean flat surface.  
Step 6 - Connect syringe with adapter and vial  
• 
• 
Take the vial with the attached adapter. 
Remove the plastic packaging from the adapter by holding the vial with one hand, pressing the 
sides of the adapter packaging with your other hand, and then lifting the packaging upwards. 
Take care that the adapter does not come away from the vial. 
• 
• 
Hold the adapter with the attached vial with one hand. Place the tip of the syringe on the 
connector part of the vial adapter.  
Gently lock the syringe onto the vial by turning it clockwise until resistance is felt. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 7 - Prepare the solution  
• 
• 
Keep the vial standing vertically on the surface with the syringe pointing downwards. 
Slowly push the syringe’s plunger down until the syringe is empty. Do not remove the syringe 
from the vial. 
•  With the syringe still connected to the vial adapter, gently swirl the vial with connected syringe 
until the powder is dissolved. Avoid foaming. Do not shake the vial. 
• 
• 
Allow the vial with connected syringe to stand on the surface for 5 minutes at room temperature 
to allow the solution to completely dissolve. The plunger may rise up by itself again - this is 
normal.  
Go to step 8 immediately after these 5 minutes. 
Step 8 - Draw up solution  
• 
• 
• 
•  While keeping it vertical, slowly pull the plunger to transfer all the solution into the syringe. Do 
Check the solution for particles. All powder must be dissolved and the solution must be clear. 
Slowly press the syringe’s plunger fully down.  
Turn the whole - vial, adapter and syringe - upside down. 
not shake it. 
Step 9 - Prepare the syringe for administration  
• 
• 
• 
Turn the whole - vial, adapter and syringe - right-side up (with the syringe at the top). 
Disconnect the filled syringe from the adapter by holding the adapter in one hand and gently 
turning the syringe counter-clockwise. 
Put the vial and the attached adapter into the supplied disposal container. 
Do not touch the syringe tip or allow it to touch the surface. Place the syringe on the clean flat 
surface. 
33 
 
 
 
 
• 
Go to step 10 to inject caplacizumab under the skin of the belly. Instructions for healthcare 
professionals on how to inject Cablivi into your vein are at the end of the leaflet. 
Step 10 - Attach the needle  
• 
Unpack the needle by tearing the paper cover off the needle packaging and removing the needle 
with protective cap.  
•  Without removing the needle cap, attach the needle to the syringe by turning clockwise until 
• 
• 
resistance is felt.  
Pull back the needle safety shield. 
Check the content of the syringe. Do not use the medicine if you see any cloudiness, clumps 
or anything else that looks abnormal. Contact your doctor or nurse if this happens. 
Step 11 - Prepare injection site for injection under the skin  
• 
• 
Select a suitable place (‘injection site’) on your belly for injection under your skin. Avoid the 
area around the belly button. Select a different injection site from the one you used on the 
previous day to help the skin to recover after the injection.' 
Use the second alcohol pad to clean the injection site you have chosen. 
Step 12 - Administration  
• 
Carefully remove the needle protection cap from the needle and throw it away. Make sure the 
needle does not touch anything before the injection. 
Hold the syringe at eye level with the needle pointing upwards. 
Remove any air bubbles by tapping the side of the syringe with your finger to make the bubbles 
rise towards the tip. Then, slowly push the plunger until a small amount of liquid comes out of 
the needle. 
Gently pinch the cleaned skin between your thumb and forefinger to make a fold.  
• 
• 
• 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
Hold this skin fold during the entire injection. 
Insert the full length of the needle into the skin fold at an angle as shown in the illustration. 
Press the plunger down as far as it goes. 
• 
Pull out the needle at the same angle you inserted it. Do not rub the injection site. 
Step 13 - After administration  
• 
Immediately after the injection, move the needle safety shield over the needle, until it clicks into 
place. 
• 
Put the syringe with the needle in a disposal container. 
If you use more Cablivi than you should 
An overdose is unlikely since one vial contains only a single dose. Tell your doctor if you think you 
have had an overdose.  
If you forget to use Cablivi 
If you miss a dose you should still take it if it is within 12 hours of the scheduled time. If more than 12 
hours have passed since the dose should have been given, do not take the missed dose, but inject the 
next dose at the usual time. 
If you stop using Cablivi 
To get the most benefit from your treatment, it is important to use Cablivi as prescribed and for as long 
as your doctor tells you to use it. Please talk to your doctor before you stop the treatment because 
stopping it too early can cause your condition to come back. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
The intravenous bolus injection of Cablivi given at the start of the treatment must be administered by a 
health care professional. Preparing a dose of Cablivi for intravenous injection should be done in the 
same way as for a subcutaneous injection (see Instructions for Use, step 1 to 9, in section 3). 
Cablivi can be intravenously administered by connecting the prepared syringe to standard Luer locks 
of intravenous lines or using a suitable needle. The line can be flushed with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml 
(0.9%) solution for injection.

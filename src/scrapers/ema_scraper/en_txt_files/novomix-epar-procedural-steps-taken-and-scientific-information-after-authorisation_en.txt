PSUR, the PRAC concludes that anaphylactic reactions 
should be added to section 4.8 of the SmPC for Fiasp, in 
line with the SmPC for NovoRapid and NovoMix.  Following 
7 new reported cases of medically confirmed systemic 
allergic reactions for Fiasp and the already established 
evidence suggesting a causal relationship between insulin 
aspart and anaphylactic reactions, the updates to the 
section 4.8 of SmPC for Fiasp are justified.

The PhVWP was requested to consider whether the

Further to a CHMP request based on the 
recommendations from PhVWP, the Product 
Information (Summary of Product Characteristics 
section 4.4 and Package Leaflet section 2) is updated 
by adding a warning on an increased incidence of 
heart failure when pioglitazone is used in 
combination with insulin, especially in patients with 
predisposing factors.  
In addition to the above the MAH took the 
opportunity to update annex IIB "Other conditions"

announcment regarding the Pharmacovigilance 
II and PL 
increased risk of fluid retention and exacerbation of heart 
failure with the concomitant use of pioglitazone and insulin 
should apply to all centrally authorised insulin products. 
After the review of the available evidence, during its 
October 2010 meeting the PhVWP has concluded this 
review with a recommendation to the CHMP on the need to 
harmonise the SmPC and PL for all insulin products by 
including appropriate warning. The CHMP endorsed this 
recommendation, and in this context the Committee agreed 
that all centrally authorised insulin containing products 
should include warning on increased cardiac failure when 
pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin, especially 
in patients with predisposing factors in the in the section 
4.4 of the SmPC and section 2 of the PL.

connected with the SPC (Art. 61.3 Notification) 
(1707, 1325, 1554 and 2174) that studied three times daily 
regimen with NovoMix 30. From an efficacy point of view, 
the CHMP did not consider that the data submitted supports 
the TID regimen in type 2 diabetes patients with advanced 
diabetes who have failed to achieve good metabolic control 
on oral antidiabetics. However, the TID regimen may have 
a potential to lower the frequency of hypoglycaemias in 
patients requiring high doses of insulin. The CHMP 
therefore considered that the wording"If twice daily dosing 
with NovoMix 30 results in recurrent daytime 
hypoglycaemic episodes, the morning dose can be split into 
morning and lunchtime doses (thrice daily dosing)." is 
supported by the data and therefore is acceptable.

variation three main clinical trials (studies 1240, 1073 and 
PL 
1459) evaluating the efficacy and safety of NovoMix 30 in 
children and adolescents  (6 to 17 years of age) with type 1 
diabetes. The MAH also submitted a retrospective trial 
(study 1676) which provides data from children and 
adolescents treated with insulin aspart (IAsp) over a period 
of 30 months.  
Upon evaluation of the submitted data, the CHMP was of 
the view that the use of premixed insulin may be beneficial 
for some children as it reduces the number of injections. 
However, based on the results from the submitted studies, 
the efficacy of NovoMix 30 in the treatment of children 
younger than 10 years could not be considered as 
sufficiently established.  
There were no unexpected safety signals in the submitted 
studies, and there were indications that NovoMix 30 may 
be associated with less weight gain and less hypoglycaemia 
compared to human insulin. However, long-term safety 
data in children and adolescents are missing. 
Thus, the CHMP concluded that the product information for 
NovoMix could be updated with data on the use of children

extend the use of Novomix 30 in combination with any OAD 
for which the combination with insulin is authorised, the 
MAH submitted the results of studies investigating Novomix 
30 in combination with either metformin + sulphonylurea, 
or pioglitazone, or metformin + pioglitazone. Overall, the 
addition of Novomix 30 to ongoing treatment with 
metformin, pioglitazone or a combination of these 
compounds resulted in clinically relevant reductions of 
HbA1c.  
Incidence of weight gain and oedema was higher with the 
regimen of NovoMix 30 and thiazolidinedione (TZD) 
together than with TZD, TZD-OAD combinations or NovoMix 
30 alone. In the litterature the use of this combination has 
also been associated with an increased incidence of cardiac 
failure. Therefore, patients should be observed for signs 
and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema 
when NovoMix 30 is used in combination with pioglitazone.

dosing guideline outlined in section 4.2 of the SPC, the 
mean reduction in HbA1c was 2.8% with NovoMix 30 
(mean at baseline = 9.7%). With NovoMix 30, 66% and 
42% of the patients reached HbA1c levels below 7% and 
6.5%, respectively, and mean FPG was reduced by about 7

individual needs of people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. 
Except for the limited number of points, which can be

The pivotal study demonstrated that a BIAsp three times

acceptable glycaemic control and that postprandial blood 
glucose elevations can be reduced if such a regimen is 
compared with a BHI 30 twice daily regimen. The efficacy 
of these new compositions has been sufficiently well

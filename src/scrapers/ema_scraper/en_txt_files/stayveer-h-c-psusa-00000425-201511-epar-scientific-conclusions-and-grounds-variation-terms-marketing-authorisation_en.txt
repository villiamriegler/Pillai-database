Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSURs for bosentan, the scientific conclusions 
of the CHMP are as follows:  
Literature suggests a physiologic role of endothelin in ocular blood flow regulation. Blurred vision is 
listed in the product information of ambrisentan (selective Endothelin receptor type A (ETA) 
antagonist) as an adverse drug reaction and it is considered as an ongoing signal for macitentan (both 
ETA and ETB antagonist). In addition, a well-documented case with positive rechallenge of a direct 
effect of bosentan in accommodation (although the ophthalmologist suggested that the event appeared 
to have affected ocular motility rather than vision) was noted. Even if blurred vision appears to be a 
symptom of systemic hypotension in most reported cases, the PRAC considers that systemic 
hypotension induced by bosentan may have a functional impact on eyes. Prescribers and patients 
should be adequately informed about this risk.  
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information of medicinal products containing bosentan were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for bosentan the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal products containing bosentan is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisations should be varied.

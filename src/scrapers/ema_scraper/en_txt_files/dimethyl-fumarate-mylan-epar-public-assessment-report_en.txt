DMF and MEF are esters of fumaric acid. DMF is pre-systemically hydrolysed by ubiquitous esterases to 
its major active metabolite monomethyl fumarate (MMF), which is further degraded to fumaric acid (FA). 
Likewise, MEF is metabolized by esterases to FA.

In investigations provided under the MAA of Tecfidera, MEF salts were tested in the range of 0 – 12 µg/ml, 
which encompasses its known peak plasma concentrations in humans. Of note, the median Cmax of MEF 
in  psoriasis  patients  receiving  two tablets  of  Fumaderm  was  5.2 µM,  which  equates  to  approximately 
0.75 µg/ml (Rostami-Yazdi et al., 2010). However, plasma concentrations may not accurately reflect the 
exposure to MEF in certain tissues and locally in the intestinal mucosa, which would be expected to be 
in rats. In addition, DMF significantly diminished excitotoxic lesions and improved neuronal survival as 
well as functional outcome evoked by the mitochondrial toxicant malonate in rats. 
Moreover,  DMF  and  MMF  demonstrated  anti-inflammatory  activity  by 
the  suppression  of

The study authors concluded that DMF/MEF combinatorial treatment was significantly superior to DMF 
monotherapy.  
Evaluation comment  
Moreover, mild topical corticosteroid was allowed during the study. However, no further information 
about the topical treatment was provided. No information about statistical analysis was found. Taking 
into consideration the evaluation of psoriasis, usage of topical corticosteroid might have distorted the 
results of the study. There are critical flaws in the study methods and statistical analysis, therefore no 
conclusion can be drawn from this study. 
There is no information on demographics and patients’ disease features (e.g. severity of psoriasis, 
disease duration, previous treatment) across the groups. In the absence of randomization or any other 
method to control for baseline unbalance (the article established that the choice of the therapy was 
determined by a patient´s insurance), this is a critical shortcoming that prevents the interpretation on 
causal effects.

combination  over  DMF  was  shown  (after  24  months,  55%  of  patients  continued  on  DMF/MEF  salt 
combination therapy, compared to 16% of patients on DMF). Moreover, in the DMF group the percentage 
of sufficient responders declined from 32% to 18% during the 24-month study, while in the DMF/MEF 
salt  combination  group  the  percentage  remained  unchanged.  However,  there  were  significant 
shortcomings in this study, including the fact that the amount of DMF in the DMF/MEF combination was 
twice of the amount of DMF in the monotherapy arm. Therefore, patients in the DMF monotherapy group 
may have been treated with doses which were not sufficient for all patients and it is therefore difficult to 
assess any additive effects of the MEF esters.

Study IV: comparative study of 720 mg MEFAE-Na compared with 240 mg MEFAE-Na. This dose  finding 
study was performed because the daily 240 mg dosage of MEFAE was ineffective. It was performed in 
20 patients, 12 women and 8 men: 10 had been treated with 240 mg MEFAE and 10 with placebo in 
the previous 4 months. The first group was given 720 mg daily, the latter 240 mg. The observation 
time was 3 months. 
Furthermore, longer dose titration scheme was used in the DMF/MEF combination group compared to 
DMF group. Finally, differences in formulations (galenical formulation of the DMF/MEF combination and 
semienteric-coated DMF capsules) preclude the comparison of efficacy and safety of both products.   
Study  II:  controlled  study  with  MEFAE  sodium  (Na).  In  a  double-blind  study  240  mg  MEFAE-Na  was

There was no difference between the numbers of improved, unimproved, or deteriorated cases in 
both groups. The average final score was the same in both groups, and so were the average final 
scores of each factor. Only the itching score showed a greater drop in the MEFAE-Na group than 
in the placebo group.

While  the  subscores  for  extent  of  the  eruption,  the  redness  and  the  thickness  were  not  different 
between  720  mg  –  and  240  mg  –  treated  patients,  differences  in  favour  of  MEF-NA  at  the  dose  of 
720mg – treated patients were observed in the final scores of  scaling and itching in the study. The 
authors claimed these differences were statistically significant (p<0.05) and thus could be interpreted 
as  supporting  clinically  relevant  effects  of  MEF-Na.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  average 
psoriasis severity score, established as efficacy endpoint in the section of methods in the article, was 
not different between both groups. Subscores were not presented as endpoints in this study and there 
was no evidence of adjustment for multiplicity. Therefore, the claim on statistical significance on scaling 
and itching scores could not be agreed. The small sample size is an additional limitation of the study.  
No difference was seen between the 720 mg versus the 240 mg regimen with regard to the number of 
improved patients. The  average final scores of the  total groups and the extent of the eruption, the 
redness and the thickness were the same, but significant differences (p < 0.05) were noted between 
the final scores of scaling and itching of both groups. 
Treatment with MEF-Na at the dose of  720mg  or 240  mg daily  resulted in  comparable considerable 
improvements  (>50%  n=3  in  both  groups).  Indeed,  the  same  number  of  patients  showed  an 
improvement > 50% of the global score in both groups.  
No difference between MEF-Na at the dose of 240 mg daily and placebo was observed in Study II. 
Evaluation comment  
Therefore, no conclusions on MEF-Na efficacy in psoriasis can be made based on this study. Moreover, 
no direct comparison to DMF was performed in these studies.

The aim of this double-blind, 16 week trial was to assess the  therapeutic effect of DMF monotherapy 
An ad hoc statistical analysis of Nieboer 1989 comparing the 240 mg Na-MEF data of Study IV, the 
720mg MEF data of Study IV and a group including 240mg – and 720mg MEF data to the combined 
placebo  data  of  Studies  II  and  III  was  also  taken  into  account.  The  patients  in  these  groups  were 
categorized as follows:  “responders” who achieve at least 25% improvement, and “non-responders” 
who  achieve  less  improvement  or  deterioration.  The  rate  of  response  between  the  groups  was 
compared using Fisher’s Exact test (FET) or a chi-squared. Additionally, ordered logistic regression was 
applied considering 4 categories (“deteriorated,” to < 25% improvement, to 25 to 50% improvement, 
and to > 50% improvement). In the context of that ad hoc statistical analysis, it was submitted that 
individually  underpowered  studies  (Nieboer  1989)  of  the  effect  of  MEF  in  the  absence  of  DMF 
demonstrates  statistically  significant  efficacy  on  the  improvement  of  a  psoriasis  severity  score 
compared  to  placebo  when  results  are  pooled  to  increase  statistical  power  in  an  ad  hoc  statistical 
analysis.  
While Nieboer 1989 used a global psoriasis score different than the one that is currently considered as 
a standard  (PASI), it should be noted that in  both cases  the response  is scored as a percentage of 
improvement with respect to the baseline value. In this regard, a 75% reduction in the PASI score with 
respect to baseline is the current standard of response assessment used for primary endpoints in most 
clinical  trials  of  psoriasis.  Lower  level  of  responses  (e.g.  50%  reduction)  have  also  been  used  as 
endpoints.  However,  responses  below  50%  are  not  considered  as  an  acceptable  demonstration  of 
treatment response. This is in line with the CHMP guideline on clinical investigation of medical products 
indicated for the treatment of Psoriasis (CHMP/EWP/2454/02 corr).

Patients 
Randomization into two groups was made between 45 patients. 25 female, 20 male. Aged between 18 
and 70 years. 22 were treated with DMFAE-E C. 23 with FAC-EC. At the end of the study 33 patients 
could be evaluated. 18 had been treated with DMFAE-EC and 15 with FAC-EC. At least 10% of the body 
surface was affected. At the beginning of the study 22 of these 33 patients showed the plaque type; 10 
the macular type; and 1 the guttate type of psoriasis. 11 patients had joint complaints, 6 in the DM FAE-
EC group and 5 in the FAC-EC group.  
In both groups 4 patients (18 and 15%) showed a full clearance. Considerable improvement occurred in 
15 out of 22 (68%) patients with the plaque type and in 4 out of 10 (40%) of those with the macular 
type. The patient with the guttate type showed a full clearance after a treatment of 2 months with FAC-
EC,  but  had  an  extensive relapse  1  month  later  even  though  the  therapy  had  been  continued.  For  5 
patients (22%) in the DMF AE-EC group and 1 patient (4%) in the FAC-EC group the psoriasis did not 
show any reaction to the therapy. The observed differences between the two groups appeared to be not 
significant. Deterioration, that is an increase of the score up to more than 125%, was not observed in 
either of the groups. 
The  individual  results  are  shown  in  Table  5.  Compared  to  the  initial  population  score,  a  considerable 
improvement (i.e. score more than halved) was observed in 45% of the patients treated with DMFAE-
EC and in 52% of the treated with FAC-EC. This improvement was statistically significant. 
Group 2 (n=23) received max. 480 mg DMF/day  +  380 mg MEF  salts (max.  4 tablets/day  of  120 mg 
DMF + 87 mg Ca2+-MEF + 5 mg Mg2+-MEF + 3 mg Zn2+-MEF per tablet) for 4 months. 
Group 1 (n=22) received max. 480 mg DMF/day (max. 4 tablets/day of 120 mg each).

after 4 months: 18 in the DMFA E- EC group and 15 in the FAC-EC group. The total average score in the 
DMFAE-EC group dropped from 9.7 to 4.1 and in the FAC-EC group from 10.5 to 4.1. The course of this 
score in both treatment groups was not significantly different at any time point (1- V). Subsequently, 
the separate parameters, too, did not show a significant difference in time course. The results after 4 
months were not statistically different. 
The joint complaints of the 6 patients in the DMFAE EC group showed considerable improvement for 2 
patients, and some improvement for 1, and deteriorated or remained unchanged for the other 3. In the

The aim of this double-blind study was to assess the therapeutic effect of DMF monotherapy compared 
to  DMF/MEF  using  the  same  DMF  dosage.  There  was  a  numerical  difference  in  favour  of  DMF/MEF 
compared to DMF monotherapy in regard to the improvement of the psoriasis severity score. However, 
as acknowledged by the authors of the study, the difference is not statistically significant. Higher rate of 
discontinuations were observed in DMF/MEF group compared to DMF group. Overall, the evidence of this 
study is limited due to its small sample size, the short duration of treatment, and the absence of control 
As shown in Table 6, the anti-psoriatic effect, i.e. improvement of PASI with 240 mg DMF monotherapy 
was  less  pronounced  than  with  480 mg  DMF  resp.  480 mg  DMF/MEF,  which  was  administered  in  the 
Nieboer study (1990). This means, the DMF dose applied in the Nieboer 1989 studies (III and IV) was 
quite low (probably too low to achieve convincing results).

The objective of the BRIDGE study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a new formulation of DMF 
(LAS41008), compared with placebo and Fumaderm, in adults with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque 
psoriasis. 
In  this  Phase  III,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  noninferiority  trial,  patients  were  randomized  to 
receive LAS41008, Fumaderm, or placebo (2:2:1) for 16 weeks, up titrating to a maximum daily DMF 
dose of 720 mg, depending upon individual response. 
The co-primary endpoints were the percentage of patients achieving ≥ 75% improvement in Psoriasis 
Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) and the percentage achieving a score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ in 
the Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) at Week 16. Secondary endpoints included PASI 75 at Weeks 
3 and 8, PASI 50 and PASI 90 at Week 16, and scores of 0 to 1 in the PGA at Weeks 3 and 8 and BSA 
at weeks 3, 8, and 16. 
Statistical analysis 
The sample-size calculations were based on PASI 75 response rates of 50% and 10% for LAS41008 and 
placebo, respectively, and ‘clear’/’almost clear’ PGA response rates of 40% for LAS41008 and 10% for 
placebo. For the non-inferiority test of LAS41008 vs. Fumaderm® regarding PASI 75 at week 16, a 
zero difference was assumed and a noninferiority margin of 15% was set. An alpha level of 0.05 was 
defined and a dropout rate of 15% was factored into the calculations. A total of 690 patients (276 per 
active group and 138 in the placebo group) provided a power of > 99% for the two superiorities 
tests of LAS41008 vs. placebo, and 90% for the non-inferiority test of LAS41008 vs. Fumaderm.

Based on the above results, the Authors concluded that the study has demonstrated the efficacy and 
safety of LAS41008 (DMF) for adults with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, showing it to be 
significantly superior to placebo and noninferior to the approved combination of FAEs (Fumaderm).

There was a small numerical difference in favor of Fumaderm in regard to the co-primary endpoints and 
most of the secondary endpoints. As stated in the EPAR “The effects in regard to the co-primary endpoints 
were numerically slightly lower in the Skilarence group compared to Fumaderm although this could be 
due to variability, a limited PD and the efficacy effect of MEFs in Fumaderm may also be contributing to 
an anti-psoriatic effect”. Therefore, these differences although suggesting an additional therapeutic effect 
of MEF in Fumaderm may also appear due to variability or a limited PD. More importantly, it should be 
noted that this study was aimed to demonstrate superiority of DMF versus placebo and non-inferiority 
versus DMF/MEF. Consequently, the design of this study does not allow to demonstrate superiority of 
DMF/MEF versus DMF.  
The coprimary endpoints were the percentage of patients achieving ≥  75%  improvement  in Psoriasis 
Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) and the percentage achieving a score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ in 
the Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) at Week 16. Secondary endpoints included PASI 75 at Weeks 
3 and 8, PASI 50 and PASI 90 at Week 16, and scores of 0 to 1 in the PGA at Weeks 3 and 8 and BSA 
at weeks 3, 8, and 16. In total, 671 patients were randomized and included in the full analysis set.  
The objective of this double-blind placebo-controlled study was to assess the efficacy and safety of DMF

Figure 14: Number of patients related to the duration of continuous FAE therapy that they 
received before switching from the FAE mixture to the DMF product (n = 40) 
A total of 40 patients (24 male, 16 female) were prospectively and consecutively recruited to the study 
and underwent a check-up after switching treatments. The age of adult patients ranged from 18 to 74 
years with a mean age of 46 years. One patient was 13 years old and received treatment off-label.  
This was a prospective observational trial in patients who were treated with the FAE mixture. Patients 
whose psoriasis had improved and who could tolerate treatment with the FAE mixture were recruited. 
Treatment with the FAE mixture was switched to the DMF product without any interruption on the basis 
of the current DMF dose in the FAE mixture. Patients were then scheduled for the next regular check-up 
three months later. To assess psoriasis severity, the PASI index (psoriasis area and severity index) was 
used. When presenting for their first check-up after switching, patients were handed a questionnaire to 
investigate their views about tolerability and efficacy and to provide a global judgment of the switch.

Efficacy as assessed with the PASI was equal or better in 34/37 patients, while 3/37 had a higher PASI

Most patients were treated with a daily DMF dose between 120 mg and 480 mg and had previously been 
treated with the FAE mixture for one to five years.  
In general, the patients regarded the outcome of the switch to the DMF product as neutral or positive

improvement percentage (i.e. a psoriasis severity score more than halved) was 55 % in the DMF group 
and 80 % in the DMF/MEF group. However, this complete case analysis may be biased. Except for the

•  Clinical Safety 
For  the  purpose  of  assessing  whether  MEF  has  a  clinically  relevant  therapeutic  contribution  within 
Fumaderm from a safety standpoint, the following four publications have been reviewed.

continued for about half an hour mainly localized in the face, arms and the upper part of the body. This 
symptom was not constantly present and in the course of the treatment its frequency decreased. More

which were registered in the blood most generally were: leukopenia(< 3.0 x 109/1), lymphopenia (< 
15%) and eosinophilia (> 5%). The former two developed in the course of the 3rd and 4th months. The 
eosinophilia usually began in the first 2 months and disappeared spontaneously in most of the cases.

Lymphopenia was reported in 28 patients (10.0%) in the LAS41008 group, with three patients (1.1%) 
considered severe (< 0.5 x 109 cells L.1), and in 30 (10.6%) patients in the Fumaderm group, with two 
patients (0.07%) considered severe. Proteinuria was reported in four patients (1.4%) in the LAS41008 
group and in six patients (2.1%) in the Fumaderm group. Overall, the frequency and type of the reported 
TEAEs were very similar and did not differ significantly between the LAS41008 and Fumaderm groups 
(Table 9). 
Laboratory investigations 
At week 16 or upon early treatment discontinuation, the mean total lymphocyte counts had decreased 
from baseline by 0.52 x109 cells L_1 in both the LAS41008 and Fumaderm groups, and by 0.08 x 109 
cells L_1 in the placebo group. 
Twenty-three  serious  TEAEs  were  reported  in  22  patients  (3.2%,  2.8%  and  3.6%  of  patients  in  the 
LAS41008, Fumaderm and placebo groups, respectively). Only four of these serious TEAEs, occurring in 
three patients randomized to Fumaderm, were assessed by the investigator as related to 
treatment (erosive gastritis, gastritis, gastric ulcer and gastroduodenitis). 
One  death  considered  unrelated  to  the  medication  was  reported  in  a  patient  receiving  Fumaderm 
(subendocardial ischaemia). No relationship between blood abnormalities and the onset of infections was 
detected. 
Similarly, the mean leucocyte counts had decreased from baseline by 0.73 x109 and 0.69 x 109 cells L_1 
in the LAS41008 and Fumaderm groups, respectively, compared with 0.04 x 109 cells L_1 in the placebo 
group. Lymphocyte counts below 0.7 x 109 cells L_1 were observed during the trial in 22 patients in the 
LAS41008 group (7.9%), 21 patients  in the Fumaderm  group (7.4%) and one  patient in the  placebo 
group (0.7%). Based on the available follow-up data, white blood cell counts progressively recovered 
after treatment with either LAS41008 or Fumaderm was stopped.

Falkvoll S et al. 2019  
The safety profile was evaluated based on data of 699 patients. Comparable frequency of adverse 
events was observed in DMF and Fumaderm groups. Most of adverse events were considered mild in 
severity. Lymphopenia was reported in 10% of patients treated with DMF and 10.6% of patients from 
Fumaderm group.  
Overall,  no  significant  differences  in  AEs  and  overall  tolerability  were  observed  after  switching  from 
DMF/MEF to DMF. 31/40 and 26/40 patients did not notice differences between DMF and DMF/MEF with 
respect to gastrointestinal symptoms and flushing, respectively.  
The majority of patients (27/40) did not experience any difference in GI complaints after switching from 
the  FAE  mixture  to  the  DMF  product.  Gastrointestinal  tolerability  was  judged  as  better  for  the  DMF 
product by 7/40 patients and worse by 2/40 patients. No GI complaints were reported with either drug 
product by 4/40 patients. Flushing was unchanged in 24/40 patients, 8/40 reported less flushing and 
6/40 reported more flushing. Flushing did not occur with either drug product in 2/40 patients. Regarding 
the  question  of  overall  tolerability,  28/40  patients  reported  similar  tolerability,  8/40  reported  better 
tolerability with the DMF product and 4/40 said that tolerability was worse after switching. In answer to 
the question about skin status in general, 27/40 patients reported that it was unchanged after switching 
from the FAE mixture to the DMF product, patients, 7/40 reported that it was better and 6/40 said it was

Additionally, no information has been provided about how the entity addressed the inflation of the type 
I error rate as a result of multiple testing (multiplicity). In absence of a pre-specification of a primary 
endpoint and information on control of multiplicity, a conclusion on statistically significant effect cannot 
be reached and the statistically significant claims submitted for the aforementioned differences cannot 
be accepted.   
Second,  the  results  from  the  non-clinical  study  mEAE-012  were  taken  into  account.  These  results 
stemmed  from  an  experiment  conducted  in  an  experimental  autoimmune  encephalomyelitis  (EAE) 
model, which was designed to compare the impact of treatment with DMF or MEF monotherapy with a 
combination of DMF+MEF on clinical and histopathological characteristics. Of note, neither the literature 
reference nor the study report was provided and as such details of the study are not available. 
The interested entity has neither provided a study protocol nor a statistical analysis plan. In the absence 
of  this  information,  it  is  unclear  whether  this  is  a  therapeutic  non-clinical  exploratory  study  or  a 
therapeutic non-clinical confirmatory study.  
Altogether considered, these results are considered exploratory and difficult to interpret. Consequently, 
clear conclusions could not be made based on the presented histopathological examination results.  
However, a number of shortcomings were identified in relation to the usefulness of this pre-clinical 
study.  
However, the definitions of the primary and secondary endpoints for this study have not been provided.  
Moreover, it is not clear how the doses used in mice correspond to the doses used in humans.  
In  conclusion,  although  the  available  non-clinical  data  could  suggest  a  different  impact  of  DMF+MEF 
combination  on  progression  of  EAE  in  mice,  compared  to  DMF  monotherapy,  taking  into  account  the

presented results and the above-described limitations, this data cannot be relied upon to establish the 
non-clinical efficacy of MEF within Fumaderm.  
In light of all of the above and having taken into account all the available evidence (including the above-

described  non-clinical  study),  the  additional  observations  submitted have  not demonstrated  that  MEF 
The relevance of these non-clinical findings (either alone or in combination with the other elements of 
evidence presented) is limited in the context of the overall assessment, as these findings (account being 
taken of their above-outlined shortcomings) cannot suffice to establish the clinically relevant therapeutic 
contribution of MEF in the combination treatment. In that regard, the claim that MEF has an additive, 
synergistic effect within Fumaderm has not been demonstrated.  
Without prejudice to the above, it also bears noting that, while it is true that (an) active substance(s) 
within a fixed combination medicinal product may have additive or synergistic effects, it is expected that 
clinical data is presented for the purpose of establishing its contribution to the overall effect in terms of 
efficacy.  In  particular,  compelling  mechanistic  (in  vitro  data),  preclinical  and  pharmacodynamic  data 
could be adduced to support a claim of improved efficacy within the fixed combination medicinal product. 
That being so, improved efficacy over (an) individual active substance(s) that have established efficacy 
in the targeted indication (namely, DMF) needs to be shown. The design of the pivotal clinical studies 
should be according to specific clinical guidance, where placebo or standard of care  – instead of those 
individual active substances - may be acceptable as comparators. A direct comparison against individual 
active substances with established efficacy in the targeted indication would  however still be expected. 
More specifically, for the treatment of psoriasis, a three-armed, parallel-group studies with the active 
agent, placebo and comparative active treatment would be expected. Although the BRIDGE Study did 
take into account DMF, DMF+MEF and placebo, improved efficacy over DMF was not demonstrated.

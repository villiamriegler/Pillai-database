The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/138/2010. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Prezista (darunavir, DRV) is a protease inhibitor.  
Darunavir, administered twice daily (b.i.d.) in combination with low-dose ritonavir (rtv) and with other ARV 
agents, is currently indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced adults and 
treatment-experienced paediatric subjects aged ≥ 3 years and ≥ 15 kg body weight.  
Darunavir, administered once daily (q.d.) in combination with low-dose rtv and with other ARV agents, is 
currently indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults who are either treatment-naive or 
treatment-experienced with no darunavir resistance-associated mutations (RAMs), who have plasma 
HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml, and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l.  
These dosing regimens have been established based on the results of the Phase 3 studies TMC114-C211 
(ARTEMIS, Phase III Randomized, Controlled, Open-label Trial to Investigate the Antiviral Activity, 
Tolerability and Safety of DRV/rtv in Treatment- Naive HIV-1 Infected Patients; application X/016, opinion 
adopted 20/11/2008) and TMC114-C229 [ODIN, randomised (1:1 ratio), open-label non-inferiority trial 
comparing DRV/ rtv 800/100 mg q.d versus DRV/rtv 600/100 mg b.i.d (both in combination with an 
individually selected OBR consisting of ≥ 2 NRTIs) in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patients with 
screening genotype resistance testing showing no darunavir RAMs; application II/32, opinion adopted 
20/01/2011], respectively. 
Assessment report  
Page 5/33 
 
  
  
 
The paediatric clinical development program of DRV/rtv included the following studies: 
• 
• 
Trial TMC114-C212 in treatment-experienced paediatric patients from 6 to < 18 years of age 
(application II/0025, opinion adopted 23/04/2009), 
Trial TMC114-C228 in treatment-experienced paediatric patients from 3 to < 6 years of age 
(application X/0041/G; opinion adopted 19/07/2012). In addition, after at least 32 weeks of 
treatment with the twice daily regimen, the pharmacokinetics of a DRV/rtv once daily (q.d.) regimen 
was evaluated in a subset of TMC114-C228 patients after a 2 week once daily treatment period. The 
pharmacokinetics data are presented within this report. 
Finally, the use of DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily in treatment-naïve adolescents between 12 to < 18 
years of age has been investigated in TMC114-C230. 
The indication proposed by the MAH as part of the present application was as follows: 
“PREZISTA, co-administered with low-dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult patients as well as antiretroviral therapy 
(ART)-experienced paediatric patients from the age of 3 years and at least 15 kg body weight 
and ART-naïve paediatric patients from the age of 12 years and at least 40 kg.” 
This proposed indication was supported in the present application by the Week-48 pharmacokinetic, 
efficacy and safety data from the Phase II study TMC114-C230 and extrapolation of efficacy data from 
adults and the known safety profile of DRV/rtv b.i.d. in subjects aged 3 to < 18 years. 
Study TMC114-C230 results were previously submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No1901/2006 to the CHMP (P46-64 with a second round for assessment of the responses P46-66; 
concluded in September 2012). The CHMP concluded that the product information should be updated with 
the results of this study. In addition, a few points were left for clarification during the variation procedure. 
An extrapolation of the data to the treatment-experienced adolescents aged 12 to 17 years and weighing 
more than 40kg with no DRV RAMs and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA <100,000 copies/mL and CD4+ cell 
count ≥ 100 cells x 106/L was proposed as part of this application. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
Since DRV is already approved by oral route, as film-coated tablets, no additional non-clinical studies have 
been performed to support this application. This was acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
For type II variations, the evaluation of the environmental impact should be made if there is an increase in 
the environmental exposure e.g. a new indication may result in a significant increase in the extent of the 
use (Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 1). 
The new indication is not expected to increase on the total environmental exposure. Hence, the MAH didn’t 
submit an updated Environmental Risk Assessment with this application. 
The CHMP agreed with the MAH that no increase in the environmental exposure was expected. 
2.3.  GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Union were

2.4.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects  
2.4.1.  Analysis of data submitted 
The use of DRV/rtv in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adolescents between 12 to < 18 years of age and 
weighing ≥  40 kg has been evaluated in the 48-week, Phase II, open-label trial TMC114-C230, involving 
12 subjects (male and female). See Section 2.5 for further details on the study design. 
Methods 
During the first 2 weeks of the study, DRV/rtv had to be taken in the morning to facilitate the rich 
pharmacokinetic 24-hour sampling for all subjects at Week 2 (Day 14 and 24-hour sample at Day 15). 
After completion of the 24-hour intensive pharmacokinetic sample collection at Week 2, subjects had the 
choice to take the DRV/rtv dose in the morning or in the evening. In case a subject preferred to switch to 
dosing in the evening, they had to do so minimally 2 weeks before the next sparse blood sampling day. At 
the time of switching to dosing in the evening, drug administration took place within 30 to 36 hours after 
the last morning dose of DRV/rtv. 
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inducers were not allowed from 14 days prior to baseline until the end of the 
treatment period and CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index were not allowed from baseline 
until the end of the treatment period. 
At Week 2, pharmacokinetic blood sampling was performed at 6 time points over 24 hours for evaluation 
of the pharmacokinetics. At Week 4, 24, and 48, 2 plasma samples were drawn for assessment of DRV 
population pharmacokinetics. Two samples were drawn at least 1 hour apart from each other. 
Bioanalytical analyses 
Plasma concentrations of DRV and rtv were determined using a validated liquid chromatographic – mass 
spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method.  
Assessment report  
Page 7/33 
 
 
  
  
 
Empirical Bayesian estimates for AUC24h, average steady-state plasma concentration (Css,ave), C0h and 
CL/F were obtained for each subject at each visit, and the median estimate determined within each 
subject. 
Population pharmacokinetics 
A population pharmacokinetic model for darunavir in adults was already available. The PK model has 
previously been adjusted to accommodate the difference in exposure after administration of the clinical 
trial and the commercial tablet formulation and further adjusted to accommodate data from children 
between the ages of 3 to <18 years old treated b.i.d. This adjusted model was based on richly sampled 
plasma concentration profiles obtained in studies TMC114-C228, TMC114-C212, TMC125-C206 and 
TMC125-C216 (studies submitted with the original marketing authorisation application). It is a 
two-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption with apparent oral clearance 
dependent on the concentration of alpha1- acid glycoprotein (AAG) and body weight; and the apparent 
volume of the central compartment is dependent on body weight. 
The model was updated after inclusion of the data after once daily intake in the TMC114-C228 sub-study 
and in the TMC114-C230 trial. This update was implemented by pooling the richly sampled data from the 
children aged 3 to <6 years in TMC114-C228 and from the children aged 12 to <18 years in TMC114-C230 
together with the data that were used for the previous model adjustment accounting for DRV/rtv b.i.d. 
intake in children aged 3 to <18 years. 
The dataset for the TMC114-C228 q.d. sub-study consisted of 10 individuals, with 59 observations after 
two weeks of treatment. The dataset for TMC114-C230 consisted of 12 individuals, with 71 observations 
after two weeks of treatment. The overall dataset for the parameter estimation consisted of 659 
observations from 102 subjects (72 children and 30 adults). The 6 trials included in the dataset are 
summarized in Table 1.

The pharmacokinetic parameter values for darunavir were estimated in NONMEM using the paediatric 
population PK model, i.e. a two-compartment model with a first-order absorption (parameterized as KA 
and fixed to the previously obtained value). The distribution compartment was parameterized in terms of 
Assessment report  
Page 8/33 
 
 
  
  
 
apparent volume (V3/F) and apparent inter-compartmental clearance (Q/F). Both V3/F and Q/F values 
were fixed. 
The parameter estimates obtained from the model update are shown in Table 2. Only slight changes in the 
parameter estimates are observed for CL/F and V2/F, compared to the model developed for children from 
3 to ≤ 18 years old after b.i.d administration. The influence of body weight on CL/F and V2/F was 
unchanged. The major impact of the model adjustment was the increase of V3/F and Q/F. Due to the once 
daily dosing; more information was gathered on these parameters, allowing their estimation. 
Intra-individual variability (IIV) on V2/F and V3/F on the other hand were too small to be properly 
estimated compared to the previous model. The goodness-of-fit plots for the adjusted model showed that 
the bias in the individual prediction versus the observation is minimal. 
The distributions of the individual estimates for the random effects of clearance, inter-compartmental 
clearance and absorption rate constant appeared normal with a median value close to zero. Almost no 
shrinkage is detected for the distribution of the individual CL/F parameters. However for KA and Q/F, a 
relative high value of shrinkage is observed, which may be explained by the fact that parameters are 
estimated at steady-state, giving less information on the distribution of KA and Q/F. 
Table 2.  Darunavir population PK parameters after update. 
2.4.2.  Results 
The pharmacokinetics obtained for darunavir and ritonavir at week 2 are shown in tables 3 and 4. One 
subject had higher plasma concentrations at 24h after administration compared to 12h after 
administration. This sample was not taken into account as it was presumed that the sample was taken after 
the next intake. In addition, for another subject the 24h sample was not taken. Therefore AUC and Cl/F was 
calculated for 10 subjects.

Population pharmacokinetics 
Substudy TMC114-228 q.d. dosing 
Individual darunavir pharmacokinetic parameters for subjects involved in the TMC114-C228 q.d. substudy 
were derived during the population pharmacokinetic analysis described before. Simulation records were 
added to the dataset to obtain an estimation of the darunavir plasma concentrations at the trough where 
plasma concentration was assessed. 
The goodness-of-fit plots from the model adjustment but containing only the data from the TMC114-C228 
q.d. substudy subjects indicated that the model predictions appeared to be accurate, with no detectable 
bias present for individual predictions. 
The arithmetic mean darunavir exposure was 120 µg.h/ml (see table 5) which represented 129% of the 
target (exposure arithmetic mean of 93.0 µg.h/ml in TMC114-C211). The geometric mean darunavir 
exposure was 115 µg.h/ml which represented 128% of the target geometric mean (exposure geometric 
mean of 89.7 µg.h/ml in TMC114-C211 study). 
Table 5.  Summary statistics of the median individual pharmacokinetic parameters in the TMC114-C228 
q.d. sub-study. 
The fact that the mean exposure is on the upper side of the target may be explained by two individuals 
having a high exposure. These two subjects exhibited high AAG values and low body weight; therefore, low 
clearances and high exposures were expected.

Study TMC114-C230 
The model described above was applied to darunavir plasma concentrations from the TMC114-C230 trial 
up to 48 weeks of treatment to provide individual empirical Bayesian estimates for AUCtau, Css,ave, C0h and 
apparent oral clearance (CL/F). 
The geometric mean AUC24h for DRV exposure was 77.8 μg.h/mL at Week 24 and 80.7 μg.h/mL at Week 
48, which represented 86.7% and 90.0%, respectively, of the geometric mean of the target DRV exposure 
in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults in the substudy of trial TMC114-C211 (89.7 μg.h/mL). 
The summary of the population pharmacokinetic analysis is shown in table 6.  
Table 6.  Summary of the population pharmacokinetic analysis at week 2, 4, 24 and 48. 
Based upon the population pharmacokinetics, one subject had DRV C0h plasma concentration values 
ranging from 478 ng/ml (week 4) to 751 ng/ml (week 24).  Another subject had C0h values ranging from 
771 (week 48) to 1122 ng/ml (week 2 and 4). All other subjects had DRV C0h values above 1000 ng/ml. 
The DRV AUC24h was compared to the AUC24h in adults (target exposure was between 80% to 130% of the 
geometric mean adult exposure of 89.7 μg.h/ml achieved with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d.) as determined in 
study C211 (see table 7 for the descriptive statistics at week 48).

Week 24 analysis and Bayesian feedback study TMC114-C230 
The dataset for the empirical Bayes estimation at week-24 contained 115 observations from 12 children in 
trial TMC114-C230. No observations were excluded from the darunavir plasma concentration-time 
analysis. 
Simulation records were added to the dataset to obtain an estimation of the plasma concentrations at the 
trough for each visit where a plasma concentration was assessed. For the determination of CL/F, the body 
weight at the visit was used, which was carried forward if no value was available at a later visit. Similarly, 
the AAG value was interpolated between visits, or carried forward if no value was available at a later visit. 
The goodness-of-fit plots for the feed-back analysis indicate that the model predictions appear to be 
accurate, with no detectable bias present for individual predictions. 
The overall summary statistics of pharmacokinetic parameters of darunavir, showed a geometric mean of 
darunavir exposure of 77.8 µg.h/ml which represents 86.7% of the target geometric mean (exposure 
geometric mean of 89.7 µg.h/ml in TMC114-C211 study).  
Week 48 analysis study TMC114-C230 
The model that was used to provide Bayesian estimates of individual pharmacokinetic parameters at Week 
48 was the same model used for the Week 24 analysis. This model was based on Week 2 richly sampled 
data combined with previous data in both adults and children. The model is not time-dependent, so the 
results presented in the Week 24 report are valid for any steady-state evaluation. Therefore, simulation 
data at Week 48 was not performed as it would be the same as the results in the Week 24 report. 
2.4.3.  Discussion 
The bioanalytical method and the pharmacokinetic model used by the MAH were considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
The data from study TMC114-C230 indicate that the applied dose of 800/100 mg DRV/RTV in 
treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adolescents resulted in an exposure at week 24 and at week 48 in the 
target range of adult patients. The results at week 2, 4 and 24 were comparable to those obtained at week 
48. 
In conclusion, the pharmacokinetic results support the dose of 800/100 mg DRV/RTV once daily in 
treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adolescents. The weight limit applies as patients enrolled in study C230 
had a weight of at least 40kg. 
Treatment-experienced adolescents with no DRV RAMs and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA <100,000 
copies/mL and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/L 
The objective in study TMC114-C230 was to determine a dosing regimen in adolescents that would provide 
a comparable exposure to that achieved in HIV-1 infected adults when treated with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg 
once daily. The targeted exposure was to be within 80% to 130% of the geometric mean exposure of 89.7

μg.h/mL as observed at steady-state in treatment-naïve adults treated with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once 
daily in study TMC114-C211. 
In the population pharmacokinetic analyses for the Phase 2 study TMC114-C230 in HIV-1 infected 
paediatric subjects aged 12 to <18 years and weighing ≥ 40 kg, the DRV/rtv dose of 800/100 mg once 
daily appeared to be adequate, resulting in a geometric mean exposure of 77.8 μg.h/mL, which represents 
86.7% of the target adult exposure of 89.7 μg.h/mL. The median (range) predose plasma concentration 
(C0h) values in study TMC114-C230 and study TMC114-C211 were also comparable. 
The DRV exposures and trough concentrations observed at steady-state in the population pharmacokinetic 
analyses for study TMC114-C229 in treatment-experienced adults with no DRV RAMs receiving DRV/rtv 
800/100 mg once daily were similar to those observed in the population pharmacokinetic analyses for 
study TMC114-C211 in treatment-naïve adults. The median (range) DRV area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve from time of administration to 24 hours after dosing (AUC24h) and C0h values in 
these 2 study populations were: 
- TMC114-C211: AUC24h: 87.9 (45.0 - 219.2) μg.h/mL, C0h: 2041 (368 - 7242) ng/mL; 
- TMC114-C229: AUC24h: 87.8 (45.4 - 236.9) μg.h/mL, C0h: 1896 (184 - 7881) ng/mL. 
In line with the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV 
infection (EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02), based on the identification of suitable dose regimens and the 
expectation that PK/PD relationships are the same in children as in adults, an extrapolation of efficacy data 
obtained in adults to children may be accepted. The exposure of the once daily regimen (800 mg) in 
adolescents was within the target range of adult patients. Hence, it was concluded that the approved dose 
of 800/100 mg DRV/RTV once daily in adults with prior exposure to antiretroviral medicinal products but 
without DRV RAMs could be extrapolated, with the same restrictions, to the adolescents from the age of 12 
years and at least 40 kg. 
2.5.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
2.5.1.  Analysis of data submitted 
TMC114- C230 (DIONE): phase II, open-label trial, to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety, 
tolerability and antiviral activity of DRV/rtv once daily in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected 
adolescents aged between 12 and < 18 years. 
Subjects were considered treatment-naïve if they had never received treatment with an ARV drug, 
including both investigational as well as commercially available ARVs indicated for the treatment of 
HIV-infection and ARVs for the treatment of hepatitis B infection with anti-HIV activity (e.g., adefovir, 
lamivudine (3TC), emtricitabine, entecavir). 
The study consisted of 3 phases: 
•  Screening phase of 4 weeks. 
•  Treatment phase of 48 weeks. 
•  Follow-up period of 4 weeks to follow up on any AEs or laboratory abnormalities until resolution or 
stabilization.

Methods 
Study Participants  
Main inclusion Criteria 
•  Male or female subjects, aged between 12 and < 18 years at screening. 
•  Subjects with a documented HIV-1 infection. 
•  Body weight of ≥ 40 kg at screening. 
•  Screening plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 1000 copies/mL. 
•  Subjects qualified for treatment initiation based on the investigator's assessments and/or according to 
treatment guidelines. 
Main exclusion Criteria 
•  Subjects with presence of any currently active conditions included in the listing of WHO Clinical Stage 
4. 
•  Any condition (including, but not limited to, alcohol and drug use), which, in the opinion of the 
investigator, could compromise the subject's safety or adherence to the study protocol. 
•  Previous or current use of ARVs (including both investigational as well as commercially available ARVs 
indicated for the treatment of HIV-infection and ARVs for treatment of hepatitis B infection with anti- 
HIV activity, e.g., adefovir, 3TC, emtricitabine, entecavir). 
•  Primary or acute HIV infection. 
Treatments 
In the TMC114-C230 study, the same once-daily dose schedule of DRV/rtv, as recommended for 
treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults, was investigated, i.e., DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d, in combination 
with an investigator-selected background regimen for 48 weeks. The investigator-selected background 
regimen was either zidovudine (AZT)/3TC or abacavir (ABC)/3TC, whichever was approved and marketed 
or considered local standard of care for subjects aged between 12 and < 18 years in a particular country. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy 
of DRV/rtv administered at 800/100 mg q.d. in combination with an investigator selected background 
regimen over a 24-week treatment period in ARV treatment-naïve HIV 1 infected adolescents. 
The secondary objectives were: 
• 
• 
to evaluate long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d. (in combination 
with an investigator-selected background regimen) over a 48-week treatment period in this 
population; 
to evaluate immunology, resistance characteristics, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacokinetic/ 
pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships over 48 weeks of treatment with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d. 
(in combination with an investigator-selected background regimen) in this population. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
•  Primary efficacy parameter: virologic response defined as percent of subjects with confirmed plasma 
viral load < 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL at Week 24 (TLOVR algorithm). 
Assessment report  
Page 14/33 
  
  
 
•  Major secondary efficacy parameters were the proportion of subjects with confirmed plasma viral load 
< 50 copies/mL at other time points, and the proportion of subjects with confirmed plasma viral load 
< 400 copies/mL, change in log10 plasma viral load, time to virologic response, time to loss of 
virologic response, and change in CD4+ cell count over 48 weeks. 
Sample size 
The sample size of 12 was chosen because of PK calculations using adult data. Assuming a true response 
rate of 75% at Week 24 (primary parameter: plasma viral load < 50 copies/mL, ITT-TLOVR), this sample 
size of 12 subjects would result in a 2-sided 95% confidence interval for virologic response of [49%; 
100%]. 
Statistical methods 
Intent-to-treat analysis, descriptive statistics, frequency tabulations, Wilcoxon matched-pairs 
signed-ranks test, nonlinear mixed effects modelling were applied. 
Results 
Recruitment 
TMC114-C230 was initiated in August 2009 and the last visit of the last patient in the study took place on 
31st March 2011. The 12 adolescents were included in 6 countries: France, UK, Italy, Spain (each one 
subject), Ukraine (6 subjects), USA (2 subjects). 
Baseline characteristics 
From the 12 subjects 8 were females. The mean age of the group was 14.6 years; 7 were white and 5 black 
or Afro-American. All were treatment naïve. Mean duration of HIV infection was 3.8 years, median (range) 
1.7 (0.1; 12.9). Five from these 12 had vertically transmitted HIV that only required treatment after a 
prolonged period at this age > 12 years. Most were not severely ill. At baseline median CD4+ cell count was 
282 x 106/L (range 204; 515). One patient has concurrent chronic Hepatitis B infection, and was allowed 
to enter according to the inclusion criteria that spelled that chronic Hepatitis B infection that did not require 
treatment during the study, could be included. 
None of the subjects had primary protease inhibitor (PI)-mutations. The median number of PI RAMs was 4 
(range 1 - 6). None of the subjects harbored NRTI RAMs. Also phenotypically by use of Antivirogram: all 
subjects were susceptible to all commercially available PIs and NRTIs. 
Concomitant ARVs were either AZT/3TC 6 (50.0%) or ABC/3TC 6 (50.0%). ABC could not be administered 
in those subjects where HLA-B*5701 was tested positive to prevent hypersensitivity reactions to ABC.

Numbers analysed 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population was defined as the set of all subjects who were enrolled and who had 
taken study medication, regardless of their compliance with the Protocol. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy parameter: 
Viral load < 50 copies/mL (ITT - TLOVR) increased progressively over time up to 24 weeks: 
•  Week 24: 11 out of 12 subjects (91.7%);  
•  Week 48: 10 out of 12 subjects (83.3%) had a confirmed virologic response.  
The results were confirmed by other sensitivity analyses, such as the FDA snapshot analysis.  
Confirmed plasma viral load < 400 copies/mL was present  
•  At Week 24 in 12 subjects (100%),  
Assessment report  
Page 16/33 
 
  
  
 
•  At week 48 in 11 subjects (91.7%). 
The mean plasma viral load decreased during the study. At Week 24, the mean change (SE) in log 10 viral 
load from baseline was -3.03 (0.172) log 10 copies/mL, at Week 48 this change was -2.98 (0.182) log 10 
copies/mL from baseline. 
The median time to virologic response defined as < 50 copies/mL (TLOVR) was 16 weeks; to < 400 
copies/mL (TLOVR) was 4 weeks; and to ≥ 1 log10 decrease in plasma viral load versus baseline was 2 
weeks. 
The CD4+ cell count increased during the study: 
•  at Week 24, the mean (SE) change in CD4+ cell count from baseline was 175 (19.5) x 106/L,  
•  at Week 48 this was 221 (22.4) x 106/L. 
Lack of suppression and resistance 
The 2 subjects that did not have viral load < 50 copies/ml at week 48 were 1 never-suppressed subject and 
1 rebounder. The never-suppressed subject was non-adherent based on pill counts and questionnaire. 
Although this subject had a treatment-emergent primary PI mutation (M46I), he remained susceptible to 
all commercially available PIs (including DRV) and NRTIs, including the ARVs in the subject’s background 
regimen (i.e., ABC and 3TC). The rebounder’s viral load returned to undetectable (< 50 copies/mL) at 
Week 48, after rebound at Week 40, without non-adherence as measured by self-reported adherence or 
based on pill count . The subject had a treatment-emergent NRTI RAM (K219Q). The subject remained 
susceptible to all commercially available PIs and NRTIs included in the background regimen (i.e., AZT and 
3TC). 
Adherence 
Treatment adherence to DRV/rtv was analysed based on pill count and on the results of the Study 
Adherence Questionnaire for Caregivers and Teenagers developed by the PENTA. 
Based on pill count, 7 subjects (58.3%) were > 95% adherent to both DRV and rtv and 5 subjects (41.7%) 
were < 95% adherent to DRV/rtv over the course of the treatment period. 
Based on the PENTA Study Adherence Questionnaire for Caregivers and Teenagers, the proportion of 
subjects classified as adherent to DRV/rtv (i.e., subjects who did not miss any dose of DRV and rtv 
cumulatively up to the time point of interest) was 100% until Week 8 and 83.3% (10 subjects) at Week 48; 
and adherence to the ARVs in the background regimen was 100% until Week 16 and 91.7% (11 subjects) 
at Week 48.

2.5.2.  Discussion 
A total of 12 male and female antiretroviral (ARV) treatment-naïve subjects were included in this Phase II 
study. Subjects received the recommended dose of DRV/rtv for treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults, 
i.e., 800/100 mg q.d., in combination with an investigator-selected background regimen for 48 weeks. The 
investigator-selected background regimen was either AZT/3TC (n=6) or ABC/3TC (n=6). Statistical 
analyses were performed at Week 24 (primary analysis) and at Week 48 (final analysis). The study 
methods were found acceptable by the CHMP. 
Eight (8) of the 12 subjects were females. The mean age of the group was 14.6 years; 7 were white and 5 
black or Afro-American. All were treatment naïve. Mean duration of HIV infection was 3.8 years, median 
(range) 1.7 (0.1; 12.9). Concomitant ARVs were either AZT/3TC 6 (50.0%) or ABC/3TC 6 (50.0%).  
The Primary efficacy parameter [Viral load < 50 copies/mL (ITT - TLOVR) at week 24] was met for 11 out 
of 12 subjects (91.7%). The results were confirmed by other sensitivity analyses, such as the FDA 
snapshot analysis. 
One of the main secondary parameter [Viral load < 50 copies/mL (ITT - TLOVR) at week 48] was met for 
10 out of 12 subjects (83.3%) at week 48. Confirmed plasma viral load < 400 copies/mL was present at 
Week 24 in 12 subjects (100%) and at week 48 in 11 subjects (91.7%). The CD4+ cell count increased 
during the study as at Week 24, the mean (SE) change in CD4+ cell count from baseline was 175 (19.5) x 
106/L and at Week 48 this was 221 (22.4) x 106/L. 
Adherence was meager, since 5 subjects (41.7%) were < 95% adherent to DRV/rtv. However, efficacy in 
this small sample size was comparable to that in treatment-naïve adults (83.7% in the TMC114-C211 
trial). Incident viral load increases did not result in resistance mutations that could compromise treatment 
with the prescribed medication or alternative ARVs. 
In conclusion, the efficacy results support the dose of 800/100 mg DRV/RTV in treatment-naïve HIV-1 
infected adolescents from the age of 12 years and at least 40 kg. 
Treatment-experienced adolescents with no DRV RAMs and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA <100,000 
copies/mL and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/L 
The efficacy of DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults was established in 
Phase 3 study TMC114-C211 and in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adults with no DRV RAMs in 
Phase 3 study TMC114-C229. 
The primary Week-48 analyses of study TMC114-C211 showed robust and sustained virologic and 
immunologic benefits of DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily, in combination with a fixed background regimen 
of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine, over 48 weeks. In addition, DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once 
daily was proven non-inferior to lopinavir/rtv 400/100 mg twice daily or 800/200 mg once daily. The 
resistance analyses confirmed the high genetic barrier to the development of resistance to DRV. 
The primary Week-48 analysis of study TMC114-C229 demonstrated that virologic efficacy with DRV/rtv 
800/100 mg once daily was non-inferior to that observed with DRV/rtv 600/100 mg twice daily (both in 
combination with background regimen of ≥ 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors 
[NRTIs]). DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily was associated with similar rates of virologic failure and similar 
low rates of emergence of resistance (to DRV and other protease inhibitors, and NRTIs in the optimized 
Assessment report  
Page 19/33 
 
  
  
 
background regimen) as DRV/rtv 600/100 mg twice daily in treatment-experienced patients with 0 DRV 
RAMs. 
The Week-48 results of study TMC114-C230 were in line with those of study TMC114-C211. The efficacy 
data showed that DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily, in combination with zidovudine/lamivudine or 
abacavir/lamivudine, was effective in the studied population, and there were no relevant differences in 
virologic response to DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily between the treatment-naïve paediatric population in 
study TMC114-C230 and treatment-naïve adult population in study TMC114-C211. 
Background therapy in the adult C229 study did include tenofovir + emtricitabine, which was not approved 
for adolescents at the time of the study C230. Consequently, only AZT+3TC and ABC+3TC were used as 
background therapy in the adolescents enrolled in study C230. However, the selected background therapy 
in adolescents does not contribute to changes in exposure of DRV/rtv. 
In line with the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV 
infection (EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02), based on the identification of suitable dose regimens and the 
expectation that PK/PD relationships are the same in children as in adults, an extrapolation of efficacy data 
obtained in adults to children may be accepted. The exposure of the once daily regimen (800 mg) in 
adolescents was within the target range of adult patients. Hence, it was concluded that the results obtained 
with the once daily dose of 800 mg DRV/rtv in treatment-experienced adults patients in the C229 study can 
be extrapolated to adolescent patients who have been exposed to antiretroviral therapy previously with 
similar restrictions as in adults. 
2.6.  Clinical Safety aspects 
2.6.1.  Analysis of data submitted 
Patient exposure 
Mean Exposure to DRV was 49.6 weeks. 
Adverse events 
Table 10.  AEs: summary table 
The most frequent AEs were vomiting (4 subjects, 33.3%), anemia and nausea (3 subjects each, 25.0%). 
Diarrhea, pyrexia, furuncle, sinusitis, and cough were reported in 2 subjects each (16.7%).  
Grade 3 GI AEs were reported in 1 subject, who experienced grade 3 diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. None 
of these events were considered related to DRV. None of the 4 hematologic AEs were considered related to 
DRV. 
Laboratory findings 
The overall incidence of laboratory abnormalities of interest was low. There was a trend for an increase 
from baseline in the mean values of lipids over time. No clinically relevant mean changes from baseline 
Assessment report  
Page 20/33 
 
  
  
 
were observed for any other laboratory parameter. Most laboratory abnormalities were grade 1 or 2 in 
severity. Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities were only observed for haematology laboratory 
parameters: grade 4 decreased haemoglobin was observed in 2 subjects (16.7%), who were both also 
receiving AZT. One (8.3%) of these 2 subjects also had grade 4 decreased neutrophils and grade 3 
decreased WBC count. 
As part of the evaluation of the Article 46 procedure (P46-66), the MAH was requested to discuss the 
metabolic effects of DRV in the present application. The MAH clarified that lipid- and glucose-related 
parameters were assessed under fasting conditions. Grade 2 abnormalities for total cholesterol were 
reported in 4 subjects (33.3%) and for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in 3 subjects (25.0%). Grade 2 
hyperglycemia was reported in 1 subject (8.3%). One subject had a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level 
above normal and 1 subject below normal. There were no laboratory abnormalities for triglycerides. 
However, there was a trend for an increase from baseline in the mean values of lipids over time. 
Hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia are listed ADRs in the Product Information and should be 
monitored and treatment initiated according to generally accepted recommendations for the treatment of 
lipid abnormalities. The metabolic influences of DRV on growth, lipodystrophy/fat abnormalities, 
hyperlipidemia, bone turnover and cognitive development in this age group need to be further 
documented. In addition, the long-term clinical consequences of DRV-associated increase in lipids are 
unknown and long-term follow-up is required to assess the true risk of hyperlipidemia on the development 
of cardiovascular disease. 
Since the assessment of the long-term consequences of the metabolic influences of DRV requires 
long-term follow-up, the MAH proposed to address it in a long-term study in collaboration with Paediatric 
European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA) (see below and section 2.7 RMP). The CHMP endorsed 
this proposal. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Treatment was not discontinued. 
Cardiovascular Results  
No clinically relevant mean changes from baseline were observed for vital signs or ECG parameters. There 
were no treatment-emergent vital signs related events or ECG abnormalities. 
Other Safety Parameters  
There were no unexpected safety findings from the physical examinations and no findings suggestive of 
delayed sexual maturation. 
Growth and Development  
As part of the evaluation of the Article 46 procedure (P46-66), the MAH was requested to discuss the 
effects of DRV on growth parameters in the present application. The MAH clarified that the within-group 
comparison for the changes from baseline (absolute values) at Week 48 showed an increase versus 
baseline for height (3.8 cm) and weight (2.8 kg). The changes for height during the study were statistically 
significant at the 0.05 level (Wilcoxon signed rank-test) and the changes for weight were not statistically 
significant. Changes in BMI were small during the study (0.1 kg/ m2 at Week 48) and were not statistically 
significant. 
After the start of treatment with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d., subjects in TMC114-C230 continued to grow, 
relative to what was expected, but did not clearly catch up from the growth retardation at baseline.

Since the assessment of the effects of DRV on growth parameters requires long-term follow-up, the MAH 
proposed to address it in a long-term study in collaboration with Paediatric European Network for 
Treatment of AIDS (PENTA) (see below and Section 2.7 RMP). The CHMP endorsed this proposal. 
Pharmacovigilance study on the safety and use of DRV in HIV infected children and 
adolescents in Europe  
The MAH is undertaking, in collaboration with PENTA, a post authorisation safety study (PASS) to define 
the long-term DRV/rtv safety profile in HIV-1 infected children and adolescents in Europe. This 
observational study involves the pooled analysis of individual patient data using merged datasets from 
prospective cohort studies participating within the European Pregnancy and Paediatric HIV Cohort 
Collaboration (EPPICC). (see Section 2.7 RMP) 
The overall aim of this study is to collect long-term safety data on DRV/rtv use in paediatric patients with 
HIV infection in a “real world” setting in Europe and neighbouring countries. 
Primary objective: 
•  To define the safety profile of DRV/rtv with long-term use in HIV-infected paediatric patients aged 
6-18 years, under “real-world” conditions of use in Europe. Paediatric patients are defined as being 
children from 6 to < 12 years of age or adolescents from 12 to ≤ 18 years of age. 
Secondary objectives: 
•  To describe the clinical characteristics of HIV-infected paediatric patients aged 6-18 years and treated 
with DRV/rtv in Europe, 
•  To describe off-label use of DRV/rtv in paediatric patients <6 years of age (excluding in utero 
exposure). 
The following relevant parameters are systematically collected: 
•  complete antiretroviral therapy dosing history from start to stop with DRV; 
•  weight and height from 3 months before starting with DRV; 
•  total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides for the 12 months prior to starting DRV up to present; 
•  viral load; 
•  any adverse events, with special attention to adverse events possibly related to the drugs. 
The Year 2 report of the EPPICC observational study became available at the end of September 2012, and 
was reviewed by the CHMP as part of follow-up measure 051.5. This report included cumulative data of 
children reported to EPPICC cohorts up to the end of 2011, i.e., 157 patients ever on DRV with follow-up 
time outside of clinical studies: 
•  36 patients were aged 12 to < 18 years and weighed ≥  40 kg and were taking the DRV/rtv 800/100 
mg q.d. dose (the currently proposed dosage of the present application),  
•  64 patients were aged 6 to < 18 years and were taking the licensed b.i.d. dose, 
• 
the remaining patients either were taking unlicensed or unboosted doses, were aged < 6 years or had 
important data missing. 
Clinical events considered by the treating physician to be causally related to DRV were reported for only 3 
patients, all on the b.i.d. dose (abdominal pain [non serious, n=1], and cholesterol increase [serious, 
n=2]). The overall rates of grade ≥  3 laboratory abnormalities were 1 per 100 patient-years (95% 
confidence interval 0-6) for increased total cholesterol, and 2 per 100 patient-years (95% confidence

interval 0-7) for increased triglycerides, with no discernible trend by duration of exposure to DRV (although 
confidence intervals were relatively wide). Only 2 patients taking the DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d. dose 
discontinued DRV/rtv, both for patient-related reasons and not because of dyslipidemia. 
The CHMP noted that only three patients experienced a possibly DRV associated AE. These AEs are included 
in the current SmPC as common AEs. However, the CHMP was of the opinion that the number of paediatric 
patients is too low to draw firm conclusions, in particular regarding children 6<18 years old on unlicensed 
doses (n=21) or children <6 years of age (n=3). 
As the long-term clinical consequences of DRV-associated increase in lipids are unknown, input from the 
PENTA database is regarded essential. The database should also provide data on growth parameters. 
These data are awaited within the next submission of the annual PENTA report (September 2013). 
As a result of the assessment of the present application, the Pharmacovigilance Plan of the RMP has been 
updated to state that the EPPICC study will address the following safety concerns: “children 3 to< 6 years 
of age (limited data are available from Phase 2 trial), and long-term safety data in children from 3 to 17 
years of age” and also “growth abnormalities in the paediatric population”. See section 2.7 for further 
details on the RMP. 
2.6.2.  Discussion 
There were no new clinically relevant findings compared with the known DRV/rtv safety profile in HIV-1 
infected adults and in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected subjects between 12 and < 18 years in the 
twice daily dosage. Considering the fact that the once daily dosage of 800 mg DRV can also be proposed in 
treatment-experienced adolescents with similar restrictions on specific DRV-RAMs, viral load and CD4 
count as have been imposed in adults, this known safety profile can be expanded to treatment-experienced 
adolescents as well. 
Grade 2 abnormalities for total cholesterol were reported in 4 subjects (33.3%) and for low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) in 3 subjects (25.0%). Grade 2 hyperglycemia was reported in 1 subject (8.3%). One 
subject had a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level above normal and 1 subject below normal. There were 
no laboratory abnormalities for triglycerides. However, there was a trend for an increase from baseline in 
the mean values of lipids over time. 
Hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia are listed ADRs in the Product Information and should be 
monitored and treatment initiated according to generally accepted recommendations for the treatment of 
lipid abnormalities. However, the metabolic influences of DRV on growth, lipodystrophy/fat abnormalities, 
hyperlipidemia, bone turnover and cognitive development in this age group need to be further 
investigated. In addition, the long-term clinical consequences of DRV-associated increase in lipids are 
unknown and long-term follow-up is required to assess the risk of hyperlipidemia on the development of 
cardiovascular disease. 
After the start of treatment with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d., subjects in TMC114-C230 continued to grow, 
relative to what was expected, but did not clearly catch up from the growth retardation at baseline.  
Much in the same line as for the lipid abnormalities, the multifactorial causes of growth impairment in HIV 
infected children need to be further evaluated to appreciate the potential contribution of DRV. 
Larger sample sizes than the study C230 (which included 12 treatment-naïve adolescents) are required to 
assess the long term effects of DRV on lipid abnormalities and growth parameter. The on-going PASS study 
“Pharmacovigilance study on the safety and use of DRV in HIV infected children and adolescents in Europe” 
will provide this information (see Section 2.7 RMP). Annual reports from the on-going PASS study are being 
submitted to the CHMP -the next submission being due in September 2013. In addition, the MAH will

initiate a study to compare of the data on growth from children treated with darunavir and other ART 
products (see Section 2.7 RMP). 
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
2.7.1.  PRAC advice 
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan. 
PRAC Advice 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP (version 17.1) with the responses to the RSI. In this update, the MAH 
have included the following changes which have been endorsed by the PRAC: 
• 
• 
The risk of lipid abnormalities in paediatric patients has been included under the heading of the 
already included risk of lipid abnormalities and was addressed adequately throughout the RMP. 
The risk of Growth Abnormalities in the Paediatric Population has been included as an important 
potential risk and addressed adequately throughout the RMP. 
The MAH was requested to provide a comparison of the data on growth from children treated with 
darunavir and other ART products. A study to assess growth abnormalities in the paediatric population 
using PREZISTA for comparison with like data in EPPICC or elsewhere in children on other ART products will 
be conducted. The final protocol is planned for December 2013. The final study results are expected by 
August 2015.

2.8.  Update of the Product Information 
The MAH submitted a proposal for an update of the SmPC for the oral suspension, the 400mg and the 
800mg film-coated tablets formulations with a new indication in ART-naïve paediatric patients (12 to 
17 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg). The recommended dose regimen was 800 mg once daily 
with ritonavir 100 mg once daily taken with food. Consequential changes were introduced in the product 
information of the 75mg, 150mg, 300mg and the 600mg film-coated tablets formulations. The Package 
Leaflets were updated accordingly. 
During the procedure, the following additional amendments were introduced in the Product Information: 
An extrapolation of the data to the treatment-experienced adolescents aged 12 to 17 years and weighing

more than 40kg with no DRV RAMs and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA <100,000 copies/mL and CD4+ cell 
count ≥100 cells x 106/L was found acceptable by the CHMP. The product information of the 100mg/ml 
oral suspension, the 400mg and the 800mg film-coated tablets formulations were updated with this 
indication. 
Consequential changes were introduced in the product information of the 75mg, 150mg, 300mg and the 
600mg film-coated tablets formulations. The Package Leaflets are updated accordingly. 
User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the CHMP for the following 
reasons: 
• 
full user testing in compliance with the legislative requirements was performed (n=37 participants) 
on the initial patient leaflet for Prezista 300 mg film-coated tablets, that was approved on 12 
February 2007; 
•  with the additional update to the indication for treatment-naïve paediatric patients, no new route of 
administration is proposed; 
•  no additional safety issues have been identified; 
•  new proposed text is in line with currently approved text; 
•  no other changes are introduced. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In line with the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV 
infection (EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02), based on the identification of suitable dose regimens and the 
expectation that PK/PD relationships are the same in children as in adults, an extrapolation of efficacy data 
obtained in adults to children may be accepted. 
A total of 12 male and female antiretroviral (ARV) treatment-naïve subjects were included in this Phase II 
study TMC114-C230. Subjects received the recommended dose of DRV/rtv for treatment-naïve HIV-1 
infected adults, i.e., 800/100 mg q.d., in combination with an investigator-selected background regimen 
for 48 weeks. Statistical analyses were performed at Week 24 (primary analysis) and at Week 48 (final 
analysis). 
The data from study C230 indicate that the applied dose of 800/100 mg DRV/RTV in treatment-naïve HIV-1 
infected adolescents resulted in an exposure at week 24 and at week 48 in the target range of adult 
patients. The results at week 2, 4 and 24 were comparable to those obtained at week 48. 
Hence, study C230 demonstrated that the once-daily dose schedule of DRV/rtv, as recommended for 
treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults i.e., DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d., in combination with ≥ 2 NRTIs could 
be extrapolated to treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adolescents from the age of 12 years and at least 40 kg. 
The weight limit applies as patients enrolled in study C230 had a weight of at least 40kg. 
Assessment report  
Page 30/33 
  
  
 
From an efficacy perspective, the Primary efficacy parameter [Viral load < 50 copies/mL (ITT - TLOVR) at 
week 24] was met for 11 out of 12 subjects (91.7%). The results were confirmed by other sensitivity 
analyses, such as the FDA snapshot analysis. 
One of the main secondary parameter [Viral load < 50 copies/mL (ITT - TLOVR) at week 48] was met for 
10 out of 12 subjects (83.3%) at week 48. Confirmed plasma viral load < 400 copies/mL was present at 
Week 24 in 12 subjects (100%) and at week 48 in 11 subjects (91.7%). The CD4+ cell count increased 
during the study as at Week 24, the mean (SE) change in CD4+ cell count from baseline was 175 (19.5) x 
106/L and at Week 48 this was 221 (22.4) x 106/L. 
Incident viral load increases did not result in resistance mutations that could compromise treatment with 
the prescribed medication or alternative ARVs. 
The exposure of the once daily regimen (800 mg) in adolescents was within the target range of adult 
patients. Hence, in line with the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the 
treatment of HIV infection (EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02), it was concluded that the results obtained with the 
once daily dose of 800 mg DRV/rtv in treatment-experienced adults patients in the C229 study can be 
extrapolated to adolescent patients who have been exposed to antiretroviral therapy previously with 
similar restrictions as in adults. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Despite the supportive PK/PD data and the good virological and immunological response rates, the design 
of study C230 presents some limitations (e.g. open label trial, small number of patients enrolled). 
However, in line with the provisions of the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal 
products for the treatment of HIV infection (EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02), the CHMP was of the opinion that 
the study design was adequate for an antiretroviral agent that has been shown to be efficacious in adults 
as it is the case for darunavir and that the results are sufficient to support an extrapolation from adults to 
the paediatric population. 
Adherence was meager, since 5 subjects (41.7%) were < 95% adherent to DRV/rtv. However, efficacy in 
this small sample size was comparable to that in treatment-naïve adults. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
There were no new clinically relevant findings compared with the known DRV/rtv safety profile in HIV-1 
infected adults and in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected subjects between 12 and < 18 years.  
Lipid abnormalities and growth impairment were identified as potential risks related to the use of darunavir 
in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adolescents and are being addressed in the RMP. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Larger sample sizes than the study C230 are required to better assess the long term effects of DRV on lipid 
and growth parameters. The on-going PASS study “Pharmacovigilance study on the safety and use of DRV 
in HIV infected children and adolescents in Europe” will provide this information. Annual reports from the 
on-going PASS study are being submitted to the CHMP. The next submission is due in September 2013. In 
addition, the MAH will initiate a study to compare of the data on growth from children treated with 
darunavir and other ART products. Please refer to Section 2.7 RMP. 
Assessment report

Benefit-risk balance 
As stated in the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV 
infection (EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02), provided that reliable pharmacokinetic data support robust dose 
recommendations, an extrapolation of efficacy data obtained in adults to children may be accepted.  
Study C230 demonstrated that the once-daily dose schedule of DRV/rtv, as recommended for 
treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults i.e., DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d., in combination with ≥ 2 NRTIs could 
be extrapolated to treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adolescents from the age of 12 years and at least 40 kg. 
This is supported also by the satisfactory virological and immunological response rates in Study C230.  
In addition, the safety data in the paediatric population do not give rise to any new clinically relevant 
findings compared with the known DRV/rtv safety profile in HIV-1 infected adults. Lipid abnormalities and 
growth impairment were identified as potential risks related to the use of darunavir in treatment-naïve 
HIV-1 infected adolescents and adequate measures have been put in place to monitor those. 
Overall, the similar DRV exposures in adolescents (observed and estimated) versus adult subjects after 
DRV/rtv once daily administration, the favourable safety profile with DRV/rtv once daily and twice daily 
regimens in paediatric subjects, the favourable long-term safety profile in adults, together with the efficacy 
results after DRV/rtv once daily administration observed in treatment-naïve adolescents in study 
TMC114-C230, treatment-naïve adults in study TMC114-C211, and treatment-experienced adults with no 
DRV RAMs in study TMC114-C229, all together support a dosing regimen of DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once 
daily in combination with other ARV agents and with food for use in paediatric subjects aged 12 to <18 
years and weighing ≥40 kg who are treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced with no DRV RAMs and 
who have plasma HIV-1 RNA <100,000 copies/mL and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/L. 
For treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects with 1 or more DRV RAMs, and for 
treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects for whom genotypic testing should not feasible, 
the currently approved DRV/rtv twice daily dosing recommendations will be maintained. 
As a consequence, the CHMP concluded that the benefit /risk balance is favourable for use of darunavir 
800/100 mg QD in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adolescents and adolescents with prior exposure to 
antiretroviral medicinal products but without DRV RAMs and who have plasma HIV 1 RNA < 100,000 
copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l from the age of 12 years and at least 40 kg. 
4.  Recommendations 
Final Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends, the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation requested

who have plasma HIV 1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l. As a 
consequence of these changes, sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of SmPC of the 75mg, 150mg, 300mg and 
the 600mg film-coated tablets formulations have been updated. Editorial changes were made in the 
section 4.5 of all the presentations. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/138/2010 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

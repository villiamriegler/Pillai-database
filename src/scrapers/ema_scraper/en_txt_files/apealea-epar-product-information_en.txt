Dose adjustments and delays during treatment 
Patients who experience neutropenia (neutrophil count < 1.5 × 109/L), febrile neutropenia or 
thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100 × 109/L) during treatment should have the next treatment cycle 
delayed until neutrophil counts recover to ≥ 1.5 × 109/L and platelets recover to ≥ 100 × 109/L. For 
Apealea, dose reductions of initially 50 mg/m2 and additionally 25 mg/m2 should be considered for 
subsequent courses (see Table 1).  
The recommended dose of Apealea is 250 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) given as an intravenous 
infusion over 1 hour followed by carboplatin every three weeks for six cycles. The recommended dose 
of carboplatin is AUC = 5–6 mg/mL×min. 
Apealea in combination with carboplatin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with first 
relapse of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube 
cancer (see section 5.1). 
Apealea should only be administered under the supervision of a qualified oncologist in units 
specialised in the administration of cytotoxic agents. It should not be interchanged with other 
paclitaxel formulations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
In the case of febrile neutropenia or low platelet count (< 75 × 109/L), the dose of carboplatin should 
be reduced by 1 AUC unit in the treatment cycles following recovery. For appropriate use of 
carboplatin, the prescriber is advised to consult the prescribing information for carboplatin as well.

a Grade of the adverse reaction is defined according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE). 
b The dose of carboplatin should be reduced by 1 AUC unit for treatment cycles following the 
occurrence of febrile neutropenia or low platelet count (< 75 × 109/L). 
For patients with moderate to severe impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 to ≤ 5 × ULN and 
AST ≤ 10 × ULN), a 20% reduction in dose is recommended. The reduced dose may be escalated to 
the dose for patients with normal hepatic function if the patient is tolerating the treatment for at least 
two cycles (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1 to ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) and 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 10 × ULN) may be treated with the same doses as patients with 
normal hepatic function.  
For patients with total bilirubin > 5 × ULN or AST > 10 × ULN, there are insufficient data to permit 
dose recommendations (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Withhold treatment until 
symptoms resolve to 
grade ≤ 1 
Renal impairment 
Patients with mildly or moderately impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
89−60 mL/min or GFR 59−30 mL/min, respectively) may be treated with Apealea without a dose 
modification. Patients with severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min) should not be treated with 
paclitaxel (see section 5.2).

Elderly 
No additional dose reductions, other than those for all patients, are recommended for patients 65 years 
and older.  
Method of administration 
Apealea is for intravenous use. 
Of the 391 patients with ovarian cancer in the randomised study who received Apealea in combination 
with carboplatin, 13% were between 65 and 74 years old. In this limited number of patients, anorexia, 
fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and diarrhoea were observed more 
frequently compared to patients younger than 65 years. Limited data are available on use in patients 
≥ 75 years (2% of the patients in the study). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of paclitaxel in the paediatric population for the indications of epithelial 
ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube cancer. The safety and efficacy of 
Apealea in children and adolescents aged 0−17 years has not been established. 
Non-Caucasian patients 
There are limited data of Apealea in non-Caucasian patients and current data is insufficient to 
recommend additional dose adjustments (see section 4.4). If neuropathy is observed, follow dose 
reduction recommendations in Table 1. 
After reconstitution of the powder, the solution for infusion is a clear, greenish-yellow solution. The 
solution should be administered by an intravenous infusion over approximately one hour 
(120−140 drops/min). Administration sets containing a 15 µm polyamide fluid filter should be used. It 
is important to flush the infusion set and catheter/cannula before and after the administration using the 
solution for reconstitution in order to avoid accidental administration into the surrounding tissue and to 
ensure administration of the complete dose. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Paclitaxel causes myelosuppression (primarily neutropenia). Neutropenia is a dose-dependent and 
dose-limiting adverse reaction. Therefore, frequent complete blood cell counts should be performed 
during treatment with Apealea. In the pivotal study, about a third of the patients received granulocyte 
colony stimulating factor (GCSF) to treat neutropenia and clinicians should consider whether 
individual cases could benefit from GCSF. Patients should not be treated with subsequent cycles until 
neutrophils recover to ≥ 1.5 × 109/L and platelets recover to ≥ 100 × 109/L. Patients with low 
neutrophil count should be made aware of the increased risk of infections. The risk of 
myelosuppression is increased due to the combination use with carboplatin. Dose recommendations 
for Apealea as well as for carboplatin in the case of myelosuppression should be followed (see section 
4.2). 
Severe hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see 
section 4.4).

Neuropathy 
Peripheral sensory neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy are very common adverse reactions. For 
CTCAE grade ≥ 2 sensory or motor neuropathy withhold treatment until resolution to < grade 2, 
followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Gastrointestinal symptoms 
Infusion-associated reactions 
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions are very common. If patients experience nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhoea following the administration of Apealea, they may be treated with antiemetics and/or 
antidiarrhoeal agents. Premedication may be considered in patients who have previously experienced 
gastrointestinal symptoms when being treated with cytotoxic medicinal products. 
Patients with hepatic impairment have not been studied with Apealea but may be at increased risk of 
toxicity, particularly from myelosuppression. Administration in patients with hepatic impairment 
defined as total bilirubin > 1 to ≤ 5 × ULN and AST ≤ 10 × ULN (see section 4.2) should therefore be 
performed with caution and they should be closely monitored with regard to increased liver 
impairment and myelosuppression. Patients that have total bilirubin > 5 × ULN or AST > 10 × ULN 
should not be treated with paclitaxel. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Local reactions at the infusion site are very common during Apealea infusions. The infusion site 
reactions observed include pain, phlebitis, discolouration, redness, oedema and rash. These reactions 
are more common on the first infusion and may be improved by slowing the rate of infusion. Patients 
who experience severe pain or other reactions to the infusion of Apealea are recommended to be 
considered for a central venous catheter. Care should be taken to avoid accidental administration into 
the surrounding tissue during intravenous administration. If any sign of extravasal injection occurs, 
take immediate action: terminate the infusion, aspirate fluid from the catheter/cannula before the 
needle is withdrawn, infuse the affected area with sterile saline or lactated or acetated Ringer’s 
solution and closely monitor the area. To avoid accidental administration into the surrounding tissue 
and to ensure intravenous delivery of the complete dose, flush the infusion set and catheter/cannula 
before as well as after the administration. 
Most hypersensitivity reactions related to Apealea are mild to moderate and mainly occur as skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions, but serious 
hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic shock have been reported. Minor symptoms such as 
flushing or skin reactions do not require interruption of therapy. Moderate cases may require 
premedication with corticosteroids, antihistamines and/or H2 antagonists for the following treatment 
cycles. Severe reactions, such as hypotension requiring treatment, dyspnoea requiring bronchodilators, 
angioedema or generalised urticaria require immediate discontinuation of paclitaxel and initiation of 
symptomatic treatment. Patients experiencing severe reactions should not be re-challenged with 
paclitaxel. Patients should be observed closely during treatment, particularly those patients who 
previously suffered hypersensitivity reactions with any taxane formulation. 
The true incidence, severity and time to onset of hypersensitivity reactions due to Apealea could not 
be established during clinical development due to the combination treatment with carboplatin. Delayed 
reactions related to paclitaxel occurring during or after infusion of carboplatin cannot be excluded. 
Hypersensitivity 
Alopecia 
Alopecia is a very common adverse reaction and occurs early in treatment. It can have a marked 
impact on the patients’ self-image and quality of life and patients should be counselled about the 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
likelihood of this adverse effect and on what measures might be available to mitigate it, for example 
the use of cold caps. In studies with Apealea, 45% of patients reported alopecia during therapy. 
Cardiotoxicity 
4.5 
Race 
Excipients 
Patients 65 years and older 
There are limited data on the use of Apealea in non-Caucasian patients. However, studies in breast 
cancer patients treated with paclitaxel-containing regimens indicate a possible increased risk of 
neuropathy in non-Caucasian patients (see section 4.2). 
There was no marked difference in overall tolerability between the 65–74 age group and younger 
patients. Limited data are available on use in patients ≥ 75 years. In view of this, and of the potential 
for frailty and co-morbidities, elderly patients should be carefully monitored. 
When reconstituted, this medicinal product contains up to approximately 1.6 g sodium per dose 
(0.9 g/m2 BSA; 3.6 mg per mL), equivalent to 80% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake 
of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
Heart failure has been observed in some patients receiving Apealea. In some of the cases, the patients 
had previously been exposed to cardiotoxic medicinal products such as doxorubicin or had underlying 
cardiac history. These patients should be vigilantly monitored by physicians for the occurrence of 
cardiac events. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed, in part, by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and 
CYP3A4 (see section 5.2). Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering paclitaxel 
concomitantly with medicinal products known to inhibit either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (e.g. 
ketoconazole and other imidazole antifungals, erythromycin, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, clopidogrel, 
cimetidine, ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir) because toxicity of paclitaxel may be 
increased due to higher paclitaxel exposure. Administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicinal 
products known to induce either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, 
efavirenz, nevirapine) is not recommended because efficacy may be compromised because of lower 
paclitaxel exposures. 
Apealea contains a mixture of two retinoic acid derivatives as excipients. In vitro studies using human 
microsomes have shown these derivatives to have inhibitory activity on CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
and to a lesser extent on CYP2D6. In the absence of in vivo studies addressing inhibition of CYP2B6 
and CYP2C9, the concomitant use of Apealea and substances metabolised primarily by these CYP 
enzymes should be exercised with caution. 
Apealea is indicated to be used in combination with carboplatin (see section 4.1). Apealea should be 
administered first, then carboplatin. Based on literature data, no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic 
interaction between paclitaxel and carboplatin is expected. 
No studies have been performed to evaluate drug-drug interactions between Apealea and other 
medicinal products. 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction has been observed between paclitaxel and cisplatin. 
When paclitaxel is given before cisplatin, the safety profile of solvent-based paclitaxel is consistent 
with that reported for single-agent use. When solvent-based paclitaxel was given after cisplatin, 
patients showed a more profound myelosuppression and an approximately 20% decrease in paclitaxel 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clearance. A similar effect can be anticipated for Apealea (paclitaxel micellar). Patients treated with 
paclitaxel and cisplatin may have an increased risk of renal failure as compared to cisplatin alone in 
gynaecological cancers. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Fertility 
Pregnancy 
Breast-feeding 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception 
Studies in animals being treated with paclitaxel have shown decreased fertility (see section 5.3). 
Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and for six months 
afterwards. 
Paclitaxel is excreted in human milk. Because of potential serious adverse reactions in children being 
breast-fed, Apealea is contraindicated during lactation. Breast-feeding must be discontinued for the 
duration of therapy. 
There are very limited data on the use of paclitaxel in pregnant women. Paclitaxel is suspected to 
cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Paclitaxel should not be used during pregnancy unless the 
clinical condition requires this treatment.

The frequency of undesirable effects listed in Table 2 is defined using the following convention: 
very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare 
(≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), very rare (< 1/10 000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the 
available data). 
The most common clinically significant adverse reactions associated with the use of Apealea are 
neutropenia, gastrointestinal disorders, peripheral neuropathy, arthralgia/myalgia, and infusion site 
reactions. Approximately 86% of patients experienced adverse reactions. 
Apealea has moderate influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Apealea may cause adverse 
reactions such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (common) that may affect the ability to drive or 
use machines. Patients should be advised not to drive or use machines if they feel tired or dizzy. 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
In comparison to the patients receiving solvent-based paclitaxel, there were more patients in the group 
receiving paclitaxel micellar who experienced haematological toxicities with grade 3 and 4. 
Neutropenia occurred in 79% and 66%, leukopenia in 53% and 34%, thrombocytopenia in 18% and 
10%, and anaemia in 24% and 14% of the patients in the treatment arms receiving either paclitaxel 
micellar or solvent-based paclitaxel, respectively. 
In the pivotal clinical study, patients were either treated with Apealea (paclitaxel micellar) at a dose of 
250 mg/m2 in combination with carboplatin or with solvent-based paclitaxel at a dose of 175 mg/m2 in 
combination with carboplatin (N = 391 in each arm). Overall, there were higher rates of serious 
adverse reactions with paclitaxel micellar (41%) than with solvent-based paclitaxel (27%). In both 
groups, the majority of the serious adverse reactions were haematological toxicities. There were no 
differences in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score between the two 
study groups at any time during or after treatment (mainly score 0 or 1). 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Almost all patients treated with Apealea had neutropenia of some grade, 79% of the patients had grade 
3 or 4. Neutropenia as a serious adverse reaction occurred in 29% of the patients and febrile 
neutropenia occurred in 3% of the patients. Neutropenia resolved to ≥ 1.5 × 109/L before the next 
course of treatment. Almost all patients experienced anaemia, decreased platelet count and decreased 
white blood cell count of any grade during the treatment period (98%, 93% and 98%, respectively). 
Anaemia as serious adverse reaction occurred in 5% of the patients, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia 
in 3% and 6% of the patients, respectively. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Nervous system disorders 
Peripheral neuropathies (including the preferred terms neuropathy peripheral, peripheral motor 
neuropathy, peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy, polyneuropathy, and 
polyneuropathy in malignant disease) were reported in 29% of the patients and were mostly (98%) 
mild to moderate (CTCAE grade ≤ 2). The average time to onset was 53 days from the first dose. 
Peripheral sensory neuropathy represented the most common reaction and was reported in 16% of 
patients. Other associated reactions were reported in 10% of the patients and were mostly (98%) mild 
to moderate (CTCAE grade ≤ 2). Paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia were the most common ones. During 
the course of the pivotal study, 46% of the peripheral neuropathies as well as the majority (78%) of the 
associated reactions resolved. The dose-dependency of frequency and severity of neurotoxicity was 
not studied for Apealea, but has been observed for other paclitaxel formulations in other indications. 
Further, it has been demonstrated that peripheral neuropathies can persist beyond 6 months of 
paclitaxel discontinuation. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Nausea (38%), vomiting (22%) and diarrhoea (15%) were among the most commonly reported 
adverse reactions in the study. 
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multi-organ failure, 
has been reported. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Most hypersensitivity reactions related to Apealea were mild to moderate (see section 4.4). The 
frequency of paclitaxel-related hypersensitivity reactions was similar in both groups (5% of the 
patients receiving paclitaxel micellar and 7% of the patients receiving solvent-based paclitaxel), 
whereas a higher frequency of carboplatin-related hypersensitivity reactions was observed in the group 
receiving paclitaxel micellar (12% vs 7%). As a result of the combined treatment, it is not possible to 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
determine whether this observation is due to Apealea or to other factors, and delayed reactions related 
to paclitaxel cannot be excluded. 
Additional experience from clinical studies 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Alopecia was observed in 45% of patients and was abrupt in onset. Pronounced hair loss of ≥ 50% is 
expected for the majority of patients who experience alopecia. 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
Arthralgia occurred in 19% of patients and myalgia in 10%. 
There were more reports of infusion site pain in the group receiving paclitaxel micellar as compared to 
the group treated with solvent-based paclitaxel (8% and 1%, respectively). 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Asthenia and fatigue were very common and occurred in 23% and 11% of patients, respectively. 
Infusion site reactions, such as pain, phlebitis, and erythema, were seen in 12% of patients (see 
section 4.4). 
Apealea has been given as monotherapy in a total of 132 patients at doses ranging between 90 mg/m2 
in a 3-week regimen to weekly doses of 250 mg/m2 for various indications. Based on the combined 
data from monotherapy studies, very common adverse reactions and those of special interest were the 
following: neutropenia (45%), fatigue (37%), leukopenia (33%), alopecia (30%), nausea (27%), 
infusion site reactiona (23%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (20%), diarrhoea (17%), asthenia (15%), 
pyrexia (12%), constipation (12%), arthralgia (12%), paraesthesia (11%), pain (11%), vomiting (9%), 
myalgia (9%), peripheral motor neuropathy (5%), neuropathy (5%), neuropathy peripheral (5%), 
thrombocytopenia (4%), febrile neutropenia (2%), sepsis (2%), tachycardia (2%), phlebitis (2%), 
thrombosis (2%).

Mechanism of action 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers 
and stabilises microtubules by preventing depolymerisation. Stabilisation results in the inhibition of 
the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and 
mitotic cellular functions. In addition, paclitaxel induces microtubule bundle formation throughout the 
cell cycle and induces microtubule aster formation during mitosis. 
In the clinical study, the proportion of patients receiving six treatment cycles was 81% in the group 
treated with paclitaxel micellar and 87% in the group receiving solvent-based paclitaxel. The 
corresponding median number of cycles (min;max) for the two groups were 6 (1;12) and 6 (1;9), 
respectively. 
Patients were stratified based on relapse (first or second) and CA125 values. The proportions of 
patients treated at first or second relapse were then equal in both treatment groups (76% were treated 
at first relapse and 24% at second relapse). Patients who had pre-existing neuropathy of grade ≥ 2 or 
serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems were not allowed to enter the 
study. The mean age was 56 years of age in both treatment groups (range 26–81). Most of the patients 
enrolled in the study had ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (≥ 96%), in similar proportions between 
the treatment arms. Only a few patients had ECOG performance status of 2.  
An open, randomised, multicentre study was conducted in 789 women with recurrent epithelial 
ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube cancer to compare Apealea (paclitaxel 
micellar) in combination with carboplatin with solvent-based paclitaxel in combination with 
carboplatin. Patients were treated every three weeks for six cycles, either with Apealea 250 mg/m2 
given as a 1-hour intravenous infusion (N = 391) or with solvent-based paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 given as 
a 3-hour infusion (N = 391). The paclitaxel infusion was followed by carboplatin after an interval of 
30 minutes in both treatment arms.

In the study, 35% of the patients in the paclitaxel micellar group and 30% of the patients in the 
solvent-based paclitaxel group, respectively, received GCSF to treat neutropenia. The median number 
of cycles with paclitaxel/carboplatin treatment for patients receiving GCSF was 6 in both groups. The 
median number of cycles with administration of GCSF was 3 (1;6) and the mean value 3.1, each in 
both groups.

Table 4. Non-inferiority analyses on PFS and OS in a randomised trial in patients with recurrent

There was no statistically significant difference in PFS or OS between the two treatment arms. A 
non-inferiority analysis was conducted for PFS in the per-protocol (PP) population with pre-specified 
non-inferiority margin. The non-inferiority criterion was met for PFS with the upper bound limit of the 
one-sided 97.5% confidence interval (CI) for the associated hazard ratio being less than 1.2. The 
non-inferiority criterion was met for OS in the PP population with the upper bound limit of the 
one-sided 97.5% CI for the associated hazard ratio being less than 1.185 (Table 4; Figures 1 and 2). In 
the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (n = 789), the hazard ratios for PFS and OS were 0.85 (95% CI: 
0.72;1.00) and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.85;1.22), respectively. Thereby, non-inferiority was shown in the ITT 
population for PFS, but not for OS. At the time of analysis of the OS data, death had occurred in 56% 
of the patients in the group treated with paclitaxel micellar compared to 60% in the group treated with 
solvent-based paclitaxel (ITT population).

In the ITT population, the hazard ratios for PFS in the subgroups of patients with first relapse and 
second relapse were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.66;0.97) and 1.04 (95% CI: 0.74;1.47), respectively. The hazard 
ratios for OS in patients with first and second relapse were 0.98 (95% CI: 0.79;1.21) and 1.18 
(95% CI: 0.79;1.75), respectively. Thus, the results in the subgroup of patients with first relapse are 
consistent with the results in the overall population and in addition, there was an indication of PFS 
benefit for Apealea.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Distribution 
Paclitaxel is distributed equally between plasma and blood as described in published in vitro data. The 
mean unbound fraction of paclitaxel (fu) varied between 5.2% and 4.3% over time after Apealea 
infusion. This was in agreement with the mean fu after albumin-bound paclitaxel infusion which 
varied between 5.5% and 4.5% over time. 
Binding of paclitaxel to both albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein has been reported, but other binding 
proteins such as lipoproteins might be important. There are no reports of active substances able to 
displace protein-bound paclitaxel, nor is paclitaxel a likely candidate as a displacer of other active 
substances given its low molar concentrations in plasma. Based on the published literature, in vitro 
studies indicate that the presence of cimetidine, ranitidine, dexamethasone, or diphenhydramine does 
not affect protein binding of paclitaxel. Paclitaxel has been shown in vitro to be a substrate for the 
influx transporter proteins OATP1B3 and OATP1A2. 
When Apealea (paclitaxel micellar) is administered intravenously, its pharmacokinetic profile suggests 
that the formulation immediately releases paclitaxel into the blood. The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel 
were studied in 22 patients with solid tumours after 1-hour infusions of Apealea (dose levels of 90 to 
275 mg/m2). In addition, a study with a crossover design compared total and unbound paclitaxel 
concentrations in plasma after a 1-hour infusion of Apealea 260 mg/m2 with those after a 1-hour 
infusion of albumin-bound paclitaxel at the same dose. Total plasma levels of paclitaxel were similar 
after infusion of the two formulations. The plasma levels of unbound paclitaxel, i.e. the concentration 
that represents pharmacologically active paclitaxel in the body, were demonstrated to be bioequivalent 
(Cmax and AUC) after administration of albumin-bound paclitaxel and Apealea. Based on limited data, 
Cmax and AUC increased with dose after 1-hour infusions of Apealea in doses ranging from 150 to 
275 mg/m2. Dose-linearity could not be ascertained since a large inter-individual variability was 
observed. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
The biotransformation and elimination of paclitaxel have been reported in published studies; paclitaxel 
is mainly eliminated by hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion. The main metabolite of paclitaxel is 
6α-hydroxypaclitaxel. Other metabolites are 3’-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α,3’-p-dihydroxypaclitaxel. 
The formation of these metabolites is catalysed by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. No pharmacologically 
active metabolite has been found. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that paclitaxel is a 
substrate for the efflux protein P-glycoprotein. The major route of excretion of paclitaxel-derived 
material in humans is the faeces, where 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel constitutes the main material. Renal 
excretion accounts for a minor part, less than 15% of the dose. 
During and after infusion of Apealea, paclitaxel rapidly leaves the plasma compartment with a 
distribution half-life of about 0.6 hours. Thus, the distribution phase is essentially complete at 2 hours 
after the end of infusion. The tissue distribution is extensive, with a volume of distribution on the 
terminal elimination phase of about 155 L/m2 corresponding to about 280 L for an average patient 
with a body surface area of 1.8 m2. Thus, only about 1% of the paclitaxel in the body is located in 
plasma during the elimination phase. 
The terminal half-life of paclitaxel after Apealea infusion varied about 5-fold between the subjects,  
5–23 hours. Likewise, total plasma clearance varied about 5-fold from 8 to 41 L/hour. The high 
interindividual variability in clearance is believed to be a consequence of variability in hepatic enzyme 
activity.

Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
No clinical studies in patients with hepatic impairment have been undertaken with Apealea (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). A population pharmacokinetics study with albumin-bound paclitaxel 
demonstrated that patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1 to ≤ 1.5 × ULN) have an 
elimination rate in the normal range. In contrast, patients with moderate hepatic impairment (total 
bilirubin > 1.5 to ≤ 3 × ULN) and severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 to ≤ 5 × ULN) had a 
22% or a 26% reduction in paclitaxel elimination rate, respectively. Compared to patients with normal 
hepatic function, hepatically impaired patients with total bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN have an increase in 
mean paclitaxel AUC of approximately 20%. Hepatic impairment has no effect on mean paclitaxel 
Cmax. Pharmacokinetic data for patients with total bilirubin > 5 × ULN are not available. 
Renal impairment 
No clinical studies in patients with renal impairment have been undertaken with Apealea (see 
section 4.2 for dose recommendations). Since renal elimination is a minor pathway for paclitaxel, 
increased plasma levels are not expected in this patient group. A population pharmacokinetics study 
with albumin-bound paclitaxel demonstrated that patients with mild and moderate renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance ≥ 30 to < 90 mL/min) have an elimination rate similar to that of patients with 
normal renal function. Information is lacking for patients with severe renal impairment 
(GFR < 30 mL/min). 
Effects of age, gender, race and body size 
No analysis of the effect of age, gender or body size on the elimination of Apealea has been 
undertaken. However, a population pharmacokinetics study of 168 patients (86 males and 82 females) 
treated with solvent-based paclitaxel has been reported. On average, the paclitaxel elimination rate 
was 20% higher in males compared to in females. With regard to age, the population model indicated 
an approximate 5% decline in paclitaxel elimination rate for each 10-year increase in age compared to 
the median age of 56 years of the study. This amounted to a 14% decline in an 86-year-old patient 
compared to one aged 56. Further it has been shown that the rate of paclitaxel elimination increased 
with increasing body size. The model indicated that a 0.2 m2 increase in BSA would lead to a 9% 
increase in the elimination rate. There is very little information available on whether the elimination of 
paclitaxel differs between races.

In vitro studies using different cell systems have shown paclitaxel to be clastogenic inducing 
chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei and DNA damage. Chromosomal aberrations have also been 
detected in in vivo studies in mice and monkeys. Paclitaxel was devoid of mutagenic activity in the 
Ames test or the Chinese hamster ovary/hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase 
(CHO/HGPRT) gene mutation assay. The carcinogenic activity of paclitaxel has not been studied. 
However, paclitaxel is potentially carcinogenic based on its mechanism of action and demonstrated 
genotoxic activity. Paclitaxel at doses below the human therapeutic dose was associated with low 
fertility and foetal toxicity in rats. Repeat dose toxicity studies have shown non-reversible, toxic 
effects on male reproductive organs.

Take the desired number of vials from the refrigerator. The powder should be greenish-yellow 
to yellow. In case of discolouration (orange), discard the vial. To reach room temperature, let 
the vials stand protected from light for approximately 15 to 20 minutes not above 25 °C. 
Due to negative pressure in the vial, pressure must be equilibrated by a needle before and during 
injection of the solution for reconstitution. Using a sterile syringe, inject 60 mL of solution for 
reconstitution per vial. The solution should be injected during approximately one minute 
towards the inner wall of the vial and not directly onto the powder as this will result in foaming. 
Swirl the vial in an upright position for approximately 20 seconds. To keep the generation of 
foam to a minimum, do not shake the vial. 
Protect from light and allow the vial to stand for three to five minutes. 
Swirl the vial again in upright position for approximately 20 seconds, then gently invert it five 
times. Do not shake.  
Continue to swirl the vial until the powder is completely dissolved., Alternatively, the vial may 
be placed on a shaker and rotated for up to 20 minutes, while being protected from light (orbital 
shake pattern; 200–250 rpm). Steps c and to f should not be more than 30 minutes. 
The solution should be clear and greenish-yellow without visible particles or precipitates. If 
particles, precipitates, discolouration (orange) or opalescence are observed, the solution should 
be discarded. 
Inject the required amount of reconstituted Apealea into an empty, sterile ethylene-vinyl acetate 
(EVA) bag. Ensure that the solution is clear and place a light-protective bag over the EVA 
infusion bag. 
Compatibility with administration sets made of DEHP-free PVC (i.e. polyvinyl chloride without the 
plasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate) has been demonstrated. However, compatibility with 
DEHP-containing administration sets has not been demonstrated. Administration sets containing a 
15 µm polyamide fluid filter should be used. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Administration precautions 
Paclitaxel is an antineoplastic medicinal product and as with other potentially toxic compounds, 
caution should be exercised in handling Apealea. The use of gloves, goggles and protective clothing is 
recommended. If the solution contacts the skin, the skin should be washed immediately and 
thoroughly with soap and water. If it contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed 
thoroughly with water. Apealea should only be prepared and administered by personnel appropriately 
trained in the handling of cytotoxic agents. Pregnant and breast-feeding staff should not handle 
Apealea. The reconstituted product should not be diluted. 
 Medicinal product no longer authorised
Reconstitution of the medicinal product 
Apealea is supplied as a sterile powder for reconstitution before use. After reconstitution, the solution 
contains 1 mg/mL of paclitaxel formulated as micellar nanoparticles. The reconstituted solution for 
infusion is a clear, greenish-yellow solution. 
-  sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution suitable for infusion; 
-  lactated Ringer’s solution suitable for infusion; 
-  acetated Ringer’s solution suitable for infusion. 
Protect from direct and/or bright light throughout the preparation process. The (reconstituted) product 
can only withstand short-term handling in absence of light protection. 
The pH of lactated or acetated Ringer’s solution must be in the range of 5.0 to 7.5 and acceptable ion 
concentrations of calcium and magnesium are listed below (Table 1). 
Only reconstitute Apealea using one of the following commercially available solutions for 
reconstitution:

Apealea should be reconstituted using either one of the three suitable solutions for reconstitution and 
according to the following steps: 
* Solutions containing both Ca2+ and Mg2+ should have a total (combined) concentration of Ca2+ and 
Mg2+ within the range of 1.0 to 3.5 mmol/L. 
Take the desired number of vials from the refrigerator. The powder should be greenish-yellow 
to yellow. In case of discolouration (orange), discard the vial. To reach room temperature, let 
the vials stand protected from light for approximately 15 to 20 minutes not above 25 °C. 
Due to negative pressure in the vial, pressure must be equilibrated by a needle before and during 
injection of the solution for reconstitution. Using a sterile syringe, inject 60 mL of solution for 
reconstitution per vial. The solution should be injected during approximately one minute 
towards the inner wall of the vial and not directly onto the powder as this will result in foaming. 
Swirl the vial in an upright position for approximately for 20 seconds. To keep the generation of 
foam to a minimum, do not shake the vial. 
Protect from light and allow the vial to stand for three to five minutes. 
Swirl the vial again in upright position for approximately 20 seconds, then gently invert it five 
times. Do not shake. 
Continue to swirl the vial until the powder is completely dissolved. Alternatively, the vial may 
be placed on a shaker and rotated for up to 20 minutes, while being protected from light (orbital 
shake pattern; 200–250 rpm). Steps 3 to 6 should not be more than 30 minutes. 
The solution should be clear and greenish-yellow without visible particles or precipitates. If 
particles, precipitates, discolouration (orange) or opalescence are observed, the solution should 
be discarded. 
Inject the required amount of reconstituted Apealea into an empty, sterile ethylene-vinyl acetate 
(EVA) bag. Ensure that the solution is clear and place a light protective-bag over the EVA 
infusion bag. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Intravenous administration  
Compatibility with administration sets made of DEHP-free PVC (i.e. polyvinyl chloride without the 
plasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate) has been demonstrated. However, compatibility with 
DEHP-containing administration sets has not been demonstrated. Administration sets containing a 
15 µm polyamide fluid filter should be used. It is important to flush the infusion set and 
catheter/cannula before and after the administration using the solution for reconstitution in order to 
avoid accidental administration into the surrounding tissue and to ensure administration of the 
complete dose. 
Shelf life after reconstitution 
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C in lactated 
and acetated Ringer’s solution and for 4 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
solution when protected from light. From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of 
opening and reconstituting precludes the risks of microbial contamination, the product should be used 
immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the 
user.

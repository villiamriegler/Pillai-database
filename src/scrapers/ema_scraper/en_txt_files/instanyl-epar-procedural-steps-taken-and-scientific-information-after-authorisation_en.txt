Reviewing the efficacy and safety data available for

Instanyl since the granting of the marketing authorisation 
and PL 
revealed no new major safety concerns. From the clinical 
perspective, the CHMP considered that the overall benefit-
risk balance of Instanyl remained unchanged and was 
positive. However, an additional five-year year renewal was 
required based on pharmacological grounds mainly driven 
by the high level of off label use, for which the safety 
profile remains uncertain.

The results of the nasal tolerability study do not impact the 
FT-1301-032-SP (Nose-400). In this study the nasal 
tolerability of all dose strengths of Instanyl was 
investigated.

According to the results from the nasal tolerability study, a 
very few number of patients were reported with mucosa 
signs or abnormalities worsening. However, due especially 
to the low number of patients included in that study, a risk 
of local effect and nasal perforation with the product could 
not be excluded. Therefore nasal tolerability remains of 
concern and the MAH should continue to monitor cases of 
nasal effects and should seek to identify risk factors 
associated to nasal effects and the delay to onset of these 
effects.
